WOW! Super-fantastic! We LOVED this chicken dish! I used marinated artichokes and chopped them fine (I believe they added to the overall flavor). I used 1.5t minced garlic and a dash of salt and pepper in place of the garlic pepper (I didn't have any). I completely drained the artichokes but still ended up with some liquid in the pan (I'm puzzled where it came from), but it may have helped to flavor the chicken. Company-worthy or a nice change of pace for everyday fare. Excellent post!

01/10/05 - Made this AGAIN and realized that the water is definitely coming from the artichokes. I squeezed them before chopping and extracted a lot more liquid. You simply got to use marinated artichokes to capture that extra flavor! We also sliced the chicken breasts into strips, and added 5 pieces of precooked bacon (heated & crumbled) to the artichoke mixture. Simply FANTASTIC! I've NEVER rated a recipe twice - this is that good!! Just drain and squeeze the artichokes and your water problem will disappear!

I hate to change my prior five-star rating to a four-star, but the first time I made this I subbed half the mayo with sour cream. I just made this as-writte, with the full amount mayo, and it's really really oily, and leaves an aftertaste.  I still love this recipe and will  make it again, but you really need to swap out some of the mayo for sour cream. With that change, it's fabulous. Once again, thanks for sharing :)

This was so good! I did make a few changes: I was cooking for 6 and used 8oz fat free sour cream, 1/2c light Hellmans mayo, 1c shredded parm. I also sauteed in 1 Tbs. butter: 3 large garlic cloves (minced) with an 8oz jar of mushrooms (drained and chopped.) I let the mushroom mixture cool and then mixed the ingredients as in recipe. I did use marinated artichokes as others suggested. I also sprinkled a little Italian Bread Crumbs over the top and then sprayed with Butter cooking spray to get it to "crisp the top" I baked mine for 40 minutes in a 375 oven. I served the chicken on top of whole wheat egg noodles. Juicey, Tastey....no left overs!!!!

This was fantastic.
We caramelized 1/2 onion in 3 tbsps of olive oil and a 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes. We removed the onion and then sauteed a 1/2 pound of fresh sliced mushrooms with 3 cloves of minced garlic. We halved  two chicken breasts thickness wise to make four breast servings. We buttered a shallow glass baking dish and layered the bottom of the dish with a bag of pre washed baby spinach. We placed the halved breast on top of the layer of spinach and topped each breast with caramelized onions and mushrooms. We drained two 12 oz. jars of marinated artichokes reserving a 1/4 cup of the marinade. We drizzled the reserved marinade over the spinach, breasts, caramelized onions and mushrooms. We then covered each breast with the recipe mixture of mayo, parmesan cheese, marinated artichokes and garlic pepper. Lastly, we VERY LIGHTLY sprinkled cayenne pepper over the dish. Baked at 375 for 50 minutes or until the topping is golden. OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!

I've been making this recipe for years, having gotten it from my mom. I don't change a thing and can't imagine why anyone would want to. It has never failed to receive rave reviews and my guests think I spent hours in the kitchen. There is so much flavor that it needs to be served with a simple salad with a light tasting dressing like Newman's olive oil & vinegar, and some fresh asparagus and yum, yum, yummo. I've used the powdered parmesean in a pinch and it's still good. If you're needing all that change, perhaps it's your choice of mayonnaise. The salt/pepper should go directly on the chicken before pouring over the topping.

Used half sour cream half RF Miracle Whip and marinated artichoke hearts. Turned out moist and full of flavor. Made half this way, and the other half with 10 oz. thawed spinach and sauteed portobello mushrooms. Yum!

This is a standby for me. Everyone loves it. You can also make it with frozen artichoke hearts for a little less sodium. Sprinkle a few capers on top. Top with a little paprika or cayenne. Use boneless chicken thighs for the dark meat lovers.

I thought this recipe was very good.  Its not real appetizing when it comes out of the oven.  I would definitely sprinkle it with breadcrumbs next time and some paprika....or maybe put it under the broiler for a couple minutes to brown it up a bit.  My husband liked it alot.  I did use lite mayo.   I would definitely make it again.  It was super easy!!!  I made steamed asparagus with it and couscous.... YUM!

This was really good.  I did take the advice of others and use half sour cream and half mayo.  I also browned the chicken first in some olive oil.  I also had a small bit of shredded mozzarella cheese leftover in the fridge so I threw that in too. My family liked it, so I will make again!

mmmm...delicioso! Make this all the time. Sometimes I just use cheddar or even monterey jack if I don't have feta. If I'm short on time, I will cook pasta at the same time the artichoke mixture is cooking and then drain pasta and stir it on in to make a huge pan of creamy goodness.  THANKS for the recipe!

I got a similar recipe a couple of years ago from Taste of Home magazine and it is fabulous. My neighbor/friend loves to be invited to dinner when I make this. I pound the chicken before topping it with the artichoke mixture. This not only tenderizes the chicken but it increases the surface for all the yummy topping. I use garlic powder instead of garlic pepper. And don't forget to season the chicken with salt and pepper before putting the topping on. Give this recipe a try. You’ll love it, especially if you like artichoke dip.

10/10 stars more like it! We LOVED it!!! Only changes I made was I used 1/2 mayo 1/2 greek yogurt with a tsp of lemon juice. I also only used two chicken breasts but left the rest of the ingredients the same and used what sauce I had left as dip by just putting it in the broiler for 10 minutes the next day and used celery sticks to lap it up!!!!

I did everything as stated except I used light mayo and about 1/2 cup of chopped spinach. It didn't come out oily or greesey at all. I also sprinkled with paprika to give it more color contrast.  baked for 25 minutes then under the broiler for 5.  This came out amazing, one of those recipes that made me look like I worked all day in the kitchen but only took a few minutes!  A+++

A little on the rich side.  But that didn't stop me from enjoying it.  I just had to eat it in a smaller dose than usual!  It was a great foundation recipe, but for my tastes it needed some doctoring up. First, I knew straight mayo would be a little much for me so, just as I do with my artichoke dip,  I cut it back a little and mellowed it out by replacing some of the mayo with softened cream cheese.  I also prettied it up with some chopped, wilted fresh spinach, finely chopped red bell pepper and mushrooms, and added just a teeny bit of minced garlic, Worcestershire and hot sauce. The additions gave it some much needed pizzazz and dimension in flavor as well as color, and contributed greatly to a nice presentation. Baking time was just right for perfectly cooked and deliciously tender meat.  Not sure I'd make this again, however, as it was a little heavy and rich for me and as written needs some work to elevate it above "just average."

Ok, I had to review this because DH actually asked for the leftovers!! He is not big on leftovers, but was disappointed I hadn't sent the rest to work the next day (I didn't think it would microwave well). I did as others suggest and used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream. I also added mushrooms and black olives, and used 1/2 cup Parmesan and 1/2 cup of a shredded Italian cheese blend. I used chicken breast tenders, next time I think I'll brown the chicken before adding the sauce just for looks, may try spinach also. Served once with brown rice and again with whole wheat spaghetti. UPDATE: I now saute the chicken strips 1st in olive oil and garlic, then top witht he sauce, to which I've added spinach to and use 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream. I top it with bread crumbs mixed w/ olive oil! Looks great and DH loves it! A regular on my menu!

This chicken is good.  I made this because my boyfriend and I love artichoke and we had a jar of the marinated stuff in the fridge to eat up.  I halved the recipe as it was just him and I and served with rice and caesar salad (with the bf's homemade dressing).  I made the following changes: 1) marinated artichokes, drained and squeezed and diced. 2) powdered parmesan (it's all I had) and a little bit of grated jalepeno-havarti for flavour 3) miracle whip brand mayonnaise (reduced calorie) 4) a little salt, pepper and garlic spice directly on the chicken before the mixture.  Cooking time was slightly longer but my chicken breasts might have still been a bit frozen.  Sprinkled with cayanne and paprika like some people recommended.  Overall meal was nice for a change.  I wouldn't give it 5 stars even without the changes only because I wouldn't call it the MOST FLAVOURFUL chicken of my life.

This was wonderful!  Rich, warm and tender.  I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream, instead of the 3/4 cup mayo.  I also added 1/8 tsp. ground pepper and 1/4 tsp. garlic powder.  Turned out great.  I will definately make this again!

This was SO flavorful. I used marinated artichoke hearts instead, and egg noodles as well, and it was one of the best home cooked meals we've had in awhile.

Made this for dinner last night and my guests loved it. Tweaks included minced garlic and capers in sauce. Topped with paprika which provided nice color after baking. Chopped the artichoke in my VitaMix which generated sauce and chunks of artichoke. Great taste and very moist chicken. Served on top of Italian orzo (with sun dried tomatoes), broccoli, All Recipes Cheese Biscuits I, and mixed greens salad with fresh strawberries, thinly sliced onion, crumbled blue cheese, toasted almonds, all tossed with garlic olive oil dressing. Several asked for recipe.

I am going to be one of "those" people that pretty much changed the whole recipe and then rates it... but it was delicious!  We had about a cup of alfredo sauce left over from another dish earlier in the week so rather than the parm. and mayo we used that, added a bit of garlic powder and the artichoke hearts... DELICIOUS!!!  Even our picky son liked the chicken (with the artichokes removed.) Wonderful recipe, so easy, and totally delicious!

A nice evening's dinner choice that, interestingly enough, made the most impact on our 6 year old who gobbled it down and pronounced it delicious. He has never called chicken delicious before so that was a rather interesting aside. We made no substitutions because I have always had great luck cooking chicken in mayonaise.  The sauce/topping was very good and worked well with the mildness of the chicken.  The only problem was the timing given (30 Minutes) is IMPOSSIBLE-it just cannot be correct unless you have parboiled the chicken first. We cooked ours for 1 hour 15 minutes and the chicken was still a ligh pink in areas.  My thought here is that there is a significant enough mass used as a topping that 30 minutes was just not nearly enough time to cook the chicken properly.  Keep this in mind! At 30 minutes, our chicken was completely raw underneath the artichoke.

This recipe was excellent, I also subsituted 1/2 cup light sour cream and 1/2 cup light mayo, I used Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb seasoning in the mix and mushrooms.  It was amazing!  I also added mozarella cheese on top and broiled it for 5 minutes at the end to melt the cheese. Very wonderful, will make again!

Everyone has heard of the delicious hot artichoke dip with equal parts artichoke hearts, mayo, and parmesan cheese.  Well, this is the same recipe just spread on top of chicken breasts.  FABULOUS!  I wish I had added capers like other reviewers suggested - - that would have put it over the top.  Brown rice and salad made this a meal fit for company!

Delish but made a few changes.  I added 1 tablespoon of lemon juice to the mayo mixture and I browned the chicken breasts first in a pan, adding a bit of vinegar 1-2 Tbsp. to the pan to deglaze it after they were brown.  I added this glaze to the mayo and baked uncovered until the surface started to turn golden.

This was a wonderful recipe. A great change from ordinary baked chicken. I used the marinated artachoke as someone suggested, it was just the right seasoning. Will be making this again.

I made this with 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream and almost a cup of Parmesan. First, I sautéed about 4oz button mushrooms in butter until brown. Then added drained and chopped artichoke hearts and 2 cloves minced garlic and sautéed for another minute. I let this cool quite bit before stirring it into the mayo/sour cream/cheese mixture. I cut my chicken breaks into strips and put them into a casserole dish that was just the right size so they were touching and salted and peppered them. Then I spread the artichoke mixture on top. I crushed some crackers and mixed with melted butter and sprinkled on top. Baked at 375 for 30 minutes. Served chicken and sauce over linguine. Fantastic!

This is really very good and quite easy! I used Reese's marinated quartered artichoke hearts which I drained and then squeezed out the excess liquids. I had only shredded parmesan (rather than grated) on hand, used Duke's mayo from Central Market (I think it's the best) and substituted sour cream for half of the mayo. I used 1 clove of garlic (about 1.5 teaspoons), and some pepper in lieu of the garlic pepper. With it being only the two of us, I used 2 large chicken breasts which I cut into 2" strips lengthwise and for a prettier presentation (and also for taste), I dredged the strips in flour and browned them slightly in olive oil before baking. I thought the artichoke mixture was a perfect amount for 2 chicken breasts.  I served this atop capellini with a small side salad. What a quick and delightful meal! Thank you Amanda!

Very good!  Used everyone's suggestion to cut back mayo by using 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup mayo and used marinated artichokes too.  I had thinly sliced chicken breasts so I actually rolled the artichoke spread inside which worked great! Then I covered them with seasoned breadcrumbs. YUM.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Great recipe, especially if you like artichoke dip.  Would recommend sprinkling with paprika and/or broiling for a few minutes to brown the top. Delish!!

I followed others recommendations of 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  The flavor it great, it just seems very thick/rich for chicken and I prefer something a little saucier.  That being said, I have a friend who uses the same ingredients except with a few garlic cloves and spreads it over a loaf of french bread (halved of course) and then bakes it until the cheese bubbles a bit...that is FABULOUS and makes an excellent appetizer!

I read the reviews first. I added fresh garlic, 1/2 mayo 1/2 sour cream and added some cayenne pepper. It was good. My husband loved it and said make it again. Next time I will throw some chopped jalapeno's on it. Definitley worth trying.

I make this recipe quite often and love it! Occasionally I change it up a bit and add a can of diced green chilies.  Wonderful! Also I make a double recipe and freeze half for a meal later on. It freezes and heats very well.

This was really a good recipe.  Next time, I'll make a few changes though.  I think it would be better if the chicken was cubed and cooked in a little olive oil on the stove, then simmered in the artichoke mixture.  I may also serve it over pasta that way.  It had such a great flavor and texture, I just really wanted more of it!  Thanks for the recipe!

Recipe as-is deserves 4 stars, 5 stars with recommended changes from reviewers.    The first time I made this recipe, it was as instructed.  The chicken came out perfectly cooked and the topping was delicious, but i felt it wasn't living up to it's full flavor potential.  The second time I made this recipe I used marinated artichoke hearts, reserving the liquid to use as a marinade for the chicken (marinated about 30 mins, but more would be great), used regular pepper and chopped garlic (1-2 cloves) instead of garlic pepper, and used half sour cream/half mayo.  I also drizzled the chicken and topping with a few tablespoons of the reserved artichoke marinade just before popping in the oven and lightly sprinkled everything with cayenne pepper.  30 minutes was the perfect cook time for me using regular boneless chicken breasts.  I did hit them with the broiler for about 2 minutes at the end to add some nice color.    These changes really packed a powerful flavor punch and the dish was a hit with my family.  The artichoke mixture was actually a hit immediately after it was mixed up as my father tasted some on crackers and said it would be a fabulous dip.    This recipe was also super simple to mix up and was in the oven in less than five minutes, after marinating time.  Everything could easily be made up ahead of time and combined just before cooking.  Really delicious.  A must try that is good for family and company.    Recipe doubles very well.

Despite the good reviews, we found this recipe very disappointing.  Followed the recipe exactly as written, except for the cooking time.  Cooking as directed would've resulted in undercooked chicken.  The artichoke layer had good flavor, but it did not add any flavor to the chicken.  Will not be making this recipe again.

Thanks so much for this recipe. So easy and tasty. Next time I'll go 1/4 Mayo and 3/4 Sour Cream. I added bread crumbs, paprika and parsley on top. Flavours meld together very well. Loved it!

At first I was skeptical since this looked so incredibly simple but it truly is excellent and one of the simplest dishes to prepare. I used garlic powder instead of garlic pepper and added panko breadcrumbs on top as someone suggested. Yum!

I don't know why this had such rave reviews.  I love artichokes and chicken but this recipe was not good!!  Maybe i did somthing wrong. I couldn't even eat it.  I wouldn't serve it to my boyfriend.  I threw it all away and made somthing else.  The taste was in my mouth all night after that I had to keep chewing gum.  I thought this was really bad.  Sorry.

It is hard for me to give 5 stars, but this one deserves it.  This is a very yummy recipe.  My husband loves artichokes and loved this recipe.  The changes:  1. cut back on the mayo to 1/2 C per recipe  2. Double the artichoke mixture (yum).  I used frozen artichoke (defrosted).  Came out great.

Fast to prepare; rich and flavorful finished dish--but I wouldn't die for it.  I reduced the amount of mayo to a half-cup to cut the fat and would feel comfortable cutting it down even more if I make this again.  I also used a clove of garlic crushed through a press and fresh ground pepper.  My husband thought this dish was good and he'd not a big fan of chicken, so I'll likely make it again in the future.

I cube up the chicken breasts and brown first, then follow up with the rest of the recipe.   I serve this as a starter spooned over toasted french bread (garlic and olive oil of course).

WOW!!!  I was hoping this would be this good but it was even better than that!  Hubby loved it and the kids (13 & 15) were singing its praises before they knew about the hearts.  Did the chicken sauteed with garlic and 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream also.  Then I turned on the broiler for the last 3-4 minutes, browns the top nicely for some color.  I will probably double the "sauce" next time because left overs would have been nice!  EDIT: Added mushrooms to the saute chicken :)

Great recipe! I added 1/2cup of frozen spinach to it. I also grated swiss cheese over the top which made a cheesy crust which was delicious! My boyfriend said it was the best thing I've ever made.

In an attempt to tidy up my recipe box I realized there are some recipes that I have overlooked. That's what happens when your recipe box is bursting with more than a couple of thousand saved items. So, I finally made this chicken dish served with Garlic Spinach (AR) and it made for a delicious meal. There is absolutely no exaggeration in the quoted 35 minute prep and cook time, allowing this dish to be enjoyed any day of the week. I used marinated artichokes and used half mayo/sour cream. A reviewer had suggested toasting some Panko crumbs and sprinkling them on top. I might add that the next time. I was very careful to drain and even press excess liquid from the artichokes but still had a small amount of water in the baking dish described by some reviewrs. I say "just never mind" as it in no way took away from the taste and texture. I would suggest that the Parmesan cheese be of the best brand affordable or at least freshly grated. I'm pointing this out as the flavour of the cheese comes through in just the most perfect balance and therefore this might be where to spend a little extra if possible. At first I cringed at the price of a fairly small piece but it really lasts when stored correctly. Thanks for posting a great recipe.

I decided to make this one night for my boyfriend and a couple of guests...WOW! So delicious!! I used marinated artichoke hearts, half sour cream and topped it off with Italian breadcrumbs. I definitely recommend this for an easy to make filling meal and served with a light side (I made caprese salad) it is a perfect meal for entertaining guests and impressing your loved ones! :) definitely will be making this a million more times! (already going on three...haha)

I have been making this for years now...I don't use measurements, just make it according to how many chicken breasts I use. The only change I made was to use real minced garlic rather than the garlic pepper.  I like a stronger garlic taste and I add parsley for color. Like another reveiwer, I can't imagine changing this recipe beyond a little personal tweeking since it's 1st rate as it's written. I get rave reviews and get asked for the recipe all the time and I make this at least once a week. I've also used this sauce over boneless pork chops which turn out awesome as well.  Hghly recommend.

We absolutely love this easy and simple, yet tasty recipe. The only change we made was the mayo....we used sour cream instead. Thanks

Very easy and delicious!  I read the other reviews and used 1/2 c. light mayo, 1 c. parm. shredded cheese, and 8 ox. sour cream.  I sautéed mushrooms and put them on the side.  Would definitely make again!

DELICIOUS!  It's always a good thing when I can please my husband and 4 year old with one meal.  Based on reviews and our preferences, I made the following modifications:  substituted sour cream for half the mayo; doubled the "sauce";  added 1tbsp. minced garlic; added a few tablespoons of milk to make the sauce easier to spread and a bit more moist; sprinkled chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder (didn't have garlic pepper).  Also, I cubed the chicken instead of using whole breasts since I find that easier to eat and serve.  I used regular canned artichoke hearts (drain and squeeze dry!) but might try marinated next time. I also might try adding in some diced roma tomato for color.

Since I have been on bedrest during my pregnancy, hubby decided to make this dish.  It was actually pretty good.  I think there was just a little too much of the artichoke topping, but otherwise it was great.  Thanks for the post.

This was "wonderful". Added things as other posters said. Did half real mayo/half sour cream, added two chopped garlic cloves, couple blashes of white wine, cubed the chicken breasts, browned bread crumbs for top. Forgot to squeeze out the water in the artichokes, will next time. Will also add a sm. can of mushrooms. Served over linguine. This is a keeper.

Loved the taste of this recipe! Will probably use less mayo next time as it turned out a little oily. I cut up the chicken and sauteed it with a little(very little) olive oil before adding artichoke mixture. Be sure to pat the chicken dry if you use this method. We will be making this again Thanks!

I added a few things to the original recipe and it came out delish!  1/4 cup sour cream, two cloves minced garlic, 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice, 3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, black ground pepper to taste and a sprinkle of breadcrumbs on top.. broil for a minute or two to brown, after chicken is finished baking.  I served the artichoke chicken with linguine and steamed vegetables.

Great!  I seasoned the chicken breast w/ S&P and fresh lemon juice & browned them.  Quickly sauteed white sliced onions and put them in the bottom of the baking pan & put chicken on top. I also added sliced mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, fresh lemon juice and used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic pepper in the artichoke mix and served over rice with a crusty bread for the yummy juice.

great start for a recipe. We took this and ran with it, added sauteed shiitake mushroom and spinach with fresh garlic, marinated artichoke hearts, kalamata olives and feta cheese. We used just enough mayo to moisten the mixture, but will definitely try the sour cream for a fuller creamy taste. We also pan seared the chicken coated in flour to seal in the moisture, sprinkled with paprika and cooked for 25 minutes. Amazing.

I made this for dinner last night and I was very pleased with the results. I used 1/2c light mayo and 8oz plain greek yogurt, which was perfect, and served it over cheese tortolini. The only problem that I ran into was that it took almost an hour for the chicken to cook. I checked after 40 minutes and it was still very pink.

Wonderful recipe. I didn't have 15 ounces of artichokes only 6 ounces so I halved the topping and the recipe was still great. I will be making this one again. Thank you.

Deeeelicious! I added some bread crumbs to the mixture and only used about 1/2 cup mayo, put sauteed mushrooms on top of chicken along with some shredded cheese. Turned out awesome. Will be making this again soon and probably for my entire family.

i used 3 chicken breasts and cut them into thirds. i browned them a bit in a skillet in oil and salt/pepper and italian seasonings. one other modification i made was 1/3 mayo and 1/3 sour cream and also added garlic herb bread crumbs on top and it was delicious. my husband loved it.. in fact he said, 'when i open my pub, i want this on the menu'.
that good, huh! ;)

edit: i used marinated artichoke hearts. (drained)

This dish was incredibly easy to get in the oven and the chicken was tender and juicy.  However, I felt the mayo taste was a bit strong.  I can't wait to make it again with half mayo and half sour cream.

Just finished eating this and had to sit down and say how delicious this recipe turned out! I added 1 minced shallot, some sliced, fresh mushrooms, and even a few sliced black olives that I wanted to use up, all around and over the chicken. I added salt-free chicken seasonings and a quick dash of sage to the mayo/cheese mixture, and for the cheese, I used half parmesan and half romano. The breasts I cooked were fairly thick, so it took about 40-45 minutes. (the last 3-4 minutes I broiled the dish to make the topping a nice golden brown) The end result was so good, my boyfriend asked for it again as soon as possible...a rarity! Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe. :)

I got this from the Recipe of the Day yesterday and made it for dinner the same night.  It was really good!!!  I did change some things though.  I used 1/2 Mayo and 1/2 Sourcream, just adds some oomph!! And also used Italian Shredded Cheese which is a mixture and also Asiago Cheese, yummm.  Also chopped up the artichokes after draining. I cooked it for an hour and then took the top off and cooked it for another 20 minutes to brown the tops.  All in all, I didn't know what to make for dinner last night and this helped me along my way.  Hubby LOVED it and I will make it again!!!

I NEVER thought I would love an artichoke dish! I was shocked at how delicious the end product was!! The sauce is absolutely to die for. I throw all of the ingredients in the slow cooker and let it cook for 6-8 hours (depending on whether the chicken was frozen). The dish is so creamy and so flavorful -- one of my absolute favorites!

I really like this but my husband hated it, so I have to give it three stars.  It does not make enought sauce to serve this over rice.   I guess my husband thought it was too bland, he like spicy food.

Easy and very tasty! I used organic mayo, frozen artichoke hearts (boiled before using), and grana padano in place of parmesan (a less expensive alternative here in Italy), mixed in garlic powder and black pepper since I don't have garlic pepper. I also decided to add a small can of sliced black olives, which I have to say was what did it for me. YUM. Served with cous cous and mixed veggies on the side. Not the healthiest dish available, but very flavorful. I can't wait to eat the leftovers...Thank you!

So good!!  Loved it!  Followed another fan's advice, and used marinated artichokes (actually bought them by accident!)... make sure they are SQUEEZED out and chopped up good!  My family loved it, even my 10-year-old!

My husband loved this.  I didn't care for it too much.  Don't get me wrong it was good but if my husband didn't like it so much I probably wouldn't make again.  Maybe I don't like artichokes.  It was my first time to eat them other than included in a spinach dip.  3 stars from me, 5 from my husband to make it a 4 star dish.

I had mixed feeling on this. First off its easy and pie to make, very simple and I love that. I used half mayo / half reduced fat sour cream because I don't like mayo...to heavy and fatty for me. I kind of wished I would have used miracle whip but I was scared to deviate from the recipe too much but the mayo was very heavy, veryyyyyy heavy even with only half. My boyfriend who loves heavier eating even said it was a bit much. But it was GOOD. We did both devour it, the heaviness kinda hits you after though. I also used frozen artichoke hearts, which was yummy. I would make this again but I would do a bit differently, it was wayyy to bland so I would season the chicken first and do 80 / 20 sour cream and mayo. A keeper, but needed doctoring for us...

I thought this was terrible.  I couldn't even eat it and I will eat just about anything.  I intended to follow other reviewers' advice and use sour cream for mayo but I was out.  Big mistake.  It might have been better with the sour cream but I am not willing to risk it.  Thanks anyway.

Excellent recipe! Easy and delicious. I took another rater's advice and used 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 mayo. I also added a little salt/pepper and pinch of garlic salt.

This had good flavor but was not one of our favorites. It was very garlicky, which normally we love, but it seemed overwhelming in this.

I love this!! I can't make enough of it. I serve it with wheat pasta! Yum!

Updated 2010 Review:
Ok time is important, so I used a large skillet to cook my chicken, then I put 1 cup Parm, 1 Cup Mayo and 1 Cup Cream, Then add in Artichoke, I double it. For my own flavor... I add a can of mushrooms, a can of corn drained, and 1 Tbsp of Lemon Pepper with 1 Tbsp of Garlic Pepper and 1 Tbsp of Lemon juice. I don't fully drain the artichoke. For more color, I add shredded carrots about 1/2 cup. Minus Chicken for Vegatarians! Serve with pasta and bread.

2008 review:
My slight differences... I cubed up my chicken breasts (they were frozen, so I thawed them in the micro and then cubed them raw). Other feedback mentioned a lot of liquid so I used about 2 tsp of soya granules (equivalent to bread crumbs). I also used about 3-4 tsp of garlic pepper and then 1-2 tsp of lemon pepper and maybe a 1-2 tsp more of parmesan. I used half mayo and half sour cream and even extra sour cream. I think – since my oven is gas and does NOT have a temp gauge – I cooked mine hotter and longer than the recipe. Also, I did squeeze the artichoke of its excess liquid. Enjoy!

This recipe is absolutely fantastic! I've made it a few times now and everyone that has eaten it has asked me for the recipe.

Now, being that I've made it quite a few times, I've come to add my own personal touches.

*1/2 mayonnaise and 1/2 sour cream (like most users have suggested, this really cuts down on the greasy feel)
*A few cloves of garlic, peeled and chopped
*A small, drained, and chopped can of sliced mushrooms
*A handful of pistachios, chopped (these add a little bit of crunch which is wonderful)
*A few cracker crumbs on top (I use honey wheat crackers; this also gives a crunch on top)

Overall, it is a wonderful recipe, revisions or not!

This was very good, but a little on the rich side. I knew that before I started cooking so I follow what other said and substituted 1/2 of the mayo for sour cream. I also added mushrooms to the mixture. Thanks for the recipe!

This is wonderful with great flavor. I make it with just enough mayonnaise to make the mixture moist. Served with rice or egg noodles.

This was really good. My husband and I liked it a lot. My kids, not so much. But then they are very picky and their idea of gourmet is homemade chicken nuggets.That said, I did tweek this recipe a little bit. I added half a jar of capers cause capers and artichokes just go so well together. I also added fresh chopped garlic and used less mayo. About 1/2 cup rather than 3/4 cup. Very good. I served with veg fettucine pasta with a light tomato basil sauce, and bruscetta and a salad. Opened a bottle of red wine and yumo! Delicious meal. I plan to make this for company next time. Definitely a meal to impress your guests!

I made this again with a different spin. I added some chopped fresh spinach and of course, minced garlic. Also, I sliced the chicken in half, flattening it out in the pan to cook faster. This is one of those recipes that just keeps getting better!

This recipe is a good one, with only a few modifications. I seasoned the chicken breasts with garlic powder and pepper, then browned them in olive oil and butter. For the topping I used 1/2c ea. of mayo and sour cream. I also used diced garlic from the jar, and fresh black pepper. I used the same 3/4c parmasean cheese called for. I served the chicken over some spinach rice I made. The rice was just boiled with chicken broth. To the broth I added pepper, garlic power, and dried onion. When the rice absorbed the liquid. I tossed in fresh baby spinach and a little parmesean cheese and butter. The heavy artichoke chicken went great over the light simple spinach rice. I will make this again for sure!

Would recommend that the mayo be reduced by half and throw in some bread crumbs to make more substantial.

This was awesome, and we enjoyed it immensely.  I used marinated artichoke hearts (because that's what I had here) and the dish was just superb.  I don't know if it would have been quite as good with water-packed artichokes.  Either way, this was great, easy to prepare, yet something I would gladly serve to guests.  Perfect for do-ahead, prepare all the way up to the baking, refrigerate, so all that's needed is to pop it in the oven later on.

This is absolutely fabulous! It's also incredibly easy to prepare. The only change I made was to use a couple of cloves of fresh garlic (pressed) and freshly ground black pepper instead of the "pinch of garlic pepper. I will prepare this dish often. If you keep a can of artichokes in your pantry, this would be very impressive for unexpected company. YUMMMMM!

Without any rating or review, I decided to try this because hubby is a big fan of chicken and artichokes. I don't eat artichokes, but thought I would try it. I thought it was a bit salty, so when I make this again, I think I would cut up the chicken into smaller pieces and maybe add some pasta and make it into a casserole.  He left for work so he hasn't tried it yet...maybe I'm wrong.

I made half of this dish exactly as written and used half mayo/half sour cream on the other half for comparison.  It does taste better with sour cream.  However, either way, it tasted disgusting.

Made this last night for the first time - it was awesome!!!!!
I did use chicken thighs and added some roasted red peppers chopped and after placing on the chicken I added panko bread crumps mixed with butter.  I can hardly wait to have leftovers tonight (I'm only one person so I have a couple meals out of this).  Next time I'll cut the recipe in half.  You could also use this mixture put into phylo cups or puff pastry cups and bake till mixture is warm and serve for appetizers.

I loved this.  But I love artichokes.  I browned the chicken first then placed on top of some fresh spinach.  I used the marinated artichokes and followed the rest of the recipe.  So good.  Thank you.

The fact that this recipe uses canned artichokes and mayonnaise did not sound appetizing at all, but since the reviews were so high and I love artichokes (not normally canned), I decided to give it a try.  This was shockingly good!  My husband was very disappointed that I didn't make more.  I made it exactly as is, but my chicken took about 20 more minutes to cook.  I owe that to the thickness of the chicken.  Other than that, this recipe is outstanding and a must try.

We really enjoyed this. I followed other reviews and used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream and topped with Italian bread crumbs. I also seasoned the chicken. My chicken breasts were huge so it took longer to cook, which was fine. The chicken turned out moist and the sauce was very flavorful. Served with steamed asparagus.

Fantastic!  My husband said it was restaurant quality, and it was so easy to make.  I did use marinated artichoke hearts, and I also used 1.5t minced garlic and a dash of salt and pepper in place of the garlic pepper.  Turned out great, and I will be making this again.

This is really good but I use less mayo than what is required. I cut it by about thirty percent. If not it just is not as good to me. Other than that I use fresh garlic because I don't ever buy garlic powder. The chicken comes out very rich and moist. It is really a good dish.

Yummy! I put bread crumbs on the top before baking and it was a hit. I have already passed this on to a few friends whose families have rave reviews as well.

I love artichokes and was looking for something different to do with chicken and really enjoyed this recipe. It was easy to make and turned out perfect. I ended up using thin sliced chicken breasts in a 8" square baking dish, layering the slices and then spreading the artichoke mixture on top and it was great. Chicken was tender and flavorful. Will definitely make this again.

this was pretty good! i seasoned the chicken so don't do that with this recipe. too much salt ;.) 
lots of juice but still really good. id like to top this with a cheddar cheese or something next time to make the top more crispy/bubbly.

This recipe was AWESOME!!!  Not only did the house smell wonderful.... but the whole family loved it.  My husband has requested I cook the chicken this way from now on.  I added more garlic because we love garlic and split the mayo in half and used sour cream to make the 3/4 cup.  Will definitely make again. THANKYOU for sharing!!!

I was really looking forward to trying this, but for some reason it didn't work out as anticipated.  I love artichokes and I love mayo, but the artichokes had a funky texture and the taste of mayo was too overpowering.

Another delicious dish from AllRecipes! Like many of the others...did half reduced fat sour cream, half light mayo. Also used marinated artichoke hearths and drained and squeezed out extra water. The recipe calls for 15oz can, the biggest can I could find of the marinated hearts was 12oz...didn't seem to make a difference, seemed plenty. Also topped with seasoned bread crumbs. My advice is you don't need much - I think when you sprinkle too much on top, it doesn't quite brown like I had hoped for. Sprayed spray butter on top to enable it to brown and it seemed to do the trick. 

My husband was in heaven...licked his plate clean. Served with seasoned green beans and parmesan cous cous. Delicious!

This Artichoke Chicken dish was unbelievable! I doubled it and served it to guests last night. It was a big hit. I could not wait to eat the leftovers today. I followed previous reviewers' advice about not using just mayo. I used 1/2 Dukes light mayo and 1/2 low fat sour cream. I also flattened the chicken breasts just a little bit b/c they were real thick at one end. Also, I really squeezed out the artichoke juice as suggested. I had to cook the dish longer than 30 minutes to get the chicken done (checking with a thermometer), probably 40 minutes. It may have been because I had two pans in the oven. Awesome recipe! Thanks for sharing. I'm emailing this link to friends right now.

Always looking for new ways to prepare chicken.  This was great! I used 1/4 c sour cream and 1/2 c light kraft mayo.  I used the grated parm that comes in the plastic container and garlic pepper.  ( I love garlic pepper, Sams sells a brand made by "Tones"  I put it on just about everything).  Seasoned the breasts with a little salt and ground pepper.  Sprinkled a little bread crumbs and paprika before baking at 375 for 35 min.   My husband loved it..  Will make again.  I might try using freshly grated parm next time, but this was super quick and easy

This is decent.  I'm not sure I'm thrilled with the flavors completely, but I do like artichoke and I do like the tang.  Bf liked this a bit more than I did, I think.  It's quite easy and is something you can make up the night before (which is exactly what I did--bf just heated it up for dinner).  I chopped the artichokes in the food processor, which made it even more easy--just pulse a few times to get the right chopping consistency.  I think I pulsed a few more times than is ideal.  I used half greek yogurt and half mayo since I can't stomach that much mayo, and it worked out fine.  There was liquid in the bottom of my pan as another reviewer noticed--it's easily drained out.  Thanks for the recipe!

I read others' reviews and used 1/2 the amount of mayo and substituted the other half with sour cream.  I also had marinated artichokes on hand, so they were used. We both had seconds.

The only suggestion I have is to add some chopped, fresh tomato. It doesn't change the flavor much, but it adds a beautiful splash of color to an otherwise bland looking dish. I just mix in 2 or 3 chopped Romas to the artichoke/mayo/cheese mix. This dish always goes over well with my family. The kids even enjoy the moist chicken (with the artichoke mix scraped off).

This was great, I added some panko bread crumbs with a little pram cheese to the top and put it under the broiler for a few minutes. This added a little crunch and golden color.

I am not a huge fan of artichokes but when my boyfriend is on his no carb diet, this is the perfect dish to make him! It actually tastes even better reheated over the next couple of days once the mayo has absorbed all of the flavor.

This was a hit with my company & hubby. Per other reviews I used 1/2 cup sour cream with 1/4 mayo. Garlic powder rather than garlic pepper. Topped with panko bread crumbs. When done baking I popped it under the broiler to brown. Leftovers were great nuked, then popped under the broiler once again. Hubby also enjoyed the chicken cold on a flour wrap for lunch, with a little additional parmesan.

This was so easy and tasty; thank you Amanda!  I followed other's suggestion and used 1/2 sour cream & 1/2 mayo ( low-fat worked just fine for me).  I also used 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of powder because I prefer the taste.  I tried this recipe for my daughter because she is a huge fan of hot artichoke dip; she LOVED this dish :)

This was really good.  I did make some changes that is why I have a 4 star review.  This is a great base recipe.    The changes I made are as follows.  I added 1/2 cup of fresh chopped spinach, I used just 1/4 cup of Mayonnaise (helmans light) and the rest light sour cream.  I added salt and black pepper and garlic powder to the mixture (just to taste not sure on the amounts).  I also added two tablespoons of panko bread crumbs for texture to the mixture.  I also seasoned my chicken with salt and pepper before adding topping.  After adding topping on chicken I sprinkled panko bread crumbs on top of each breast to add a little crunchiness to the topping.  Loved it!!!

This is to die for! I've made this many times. No need to change a thing...except for maybe light mayo to cut down on some calories! SUPER easy & perfect to make the night before or hours ahead of time & put in fridge. I'm making it tonight in fact with a side of couscous & veggies! Can't wait!

Artichokes are my girlfriends favorite.  She had a hard day, so I made it for her.  She said it was the best tasting dish I've ever made!  (and we cook a lot)  I did do the half and half as well as pan seared them first.  Also added crispy crumbled bacon to the mix.  It couldn't get any better.  :)

Really good. My substitutions: I made mine with non fat plain yogurt instead of mayo to cut the calories. I added 3 cloves of fresh garlic to the artichoke mixture and I also used marinated artichoke hearts that I squeezed completely dry so that there was no extra liquid in the pan. I pan seared my chicken first with salt, pepper and garlic powder and then topped with artichoke mixture to bake. Looked pretty and tasted great. I will be putting it in our regular rotation.

This receipe is great!  I did use the half mayo, half sour cream suggestion and I also added mushrooms and garlic.  The flavors blend together beautifully.  I will up the amounts for the sauce ingredients next time so that I can serve it over pasta.  It was such a hit that there were no leftovers!

Phenomenal!  So effortless and so delicious.  I took other reviewers' suggestions and used marinated artichokes, half light sour cream and half light mayo, added 4 cloves minced garlic and cooked and crumbled 4 strips of bacon.  Using chicken breast tenders makes for easy serving for larger crowds.  Great as leftovers too!

After reading reviews, I used 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream.  I also finely chopped onion and added that and some crushed garlic to the mix.  Another reviewer suggested breading the chicken first, so I tried that as well.  I pounded my chicken breasts flat, dredged in a flour, salt, pepper mixture, then dipped in a beaten egg, followed by a panko bread crumb, grated Parmesan mixture.  I allowed the breading to sit on the chicken for about 20 minutes in the fridge before I fried in 2 T. of olive oil on the stove top until crispy.  Then I topped with the artichoke mixture, and a bit more grated Parmesan and baked at 350 degrees for 25 minutes. Yum!

This was incredible! I gave it 5 stars even though I only made it once and changed the recipe. My husband did not agree but, he's not an artichoke fan and you have to like artichokes to like this. I think that's a given. 
I took the advice of other reviewers and used a mixture of sour cream & mayo, with just a little more sour cream than mayo. I cut the chicken into 2 inch pieces & I also added about 1/2 cup chopped sun dried tomatoes and that was perfect. I can't wait to make this again.

I did what others reccomended and used half a cup of sour cream and half a cup of mayo. I added broccoli, spinach, cooked onions, and garlic, along with some simple spices. It turned out wonderful and I look forward to baking this again.

Great!  I didn't have enough parmasean (only 1/2 cup) and I added lots of garlic (b/c we love it!) and oregano.  Delicious!  I just did lite mayo and it turned out great. Sour cream wasn't needed.  I did add bread crumbs like suggested and cooked for 40 minutes to brown.  I also used whole wheat spaghetti noodles under.  There wasn't a lot of sauce, but it added to the meal and felt very light.  We loved this...it will become a staple.  Very quick, easy meal and delicious! I plan on wowing guests at our next dinner party. Thank you for sharing!!

I also used 1/2 sour cream & 1/2 mayo. I put marinated artichokes (you *need* the marinated ones), parm, mayo, sour cream in the blender and mixed it all up into a whip. Cut up chicken into pieces, put in pan. Added mixture, plus one bag of frozen spinach, some salt and pepper and topped with shredded mozz. cheese, then bread crumbs.
AMAZING!! 
SO easy, fast. Will make often.

This was excellent with many modifications!  I had some leftover grilled portabello mushrooms from this website and diced them up added to the very well drained marinated 7.5 container of artichokes.  I,too, used half of sour cream and half of olive oil infused mayonnaise.  I also added 2 fat  cloves of garlic.  No added salt or garlic powder, I figured the parmesan cheese would add plenty of salt.  Next time I would probably use real grated parm, I didn't have any on hand,just the shake on type.  Other than that, I cooked at 30 minutes, turned off and let it bake in the juices.  Delicious, easy, served with butter herbed rice, this is FANTASTIC!  Not asthetically pretty, but no worries, it smells delicious while cooking, tastes even better, and super easy clean up!

The best part of this recipe was the artichokes. I used marinated artichokes and if I had'nt it wouldnt have any flavor at all. The cooking time was WAY off.  I ended up cooking it for 45 minutes instead of 30 minutes.    I know this recipe has gotten great reviews but I must say that my family just didnt like it. I wont be making this dish again.

This was delicious. I made it as-is except for seasoning the chicken with S&P and garlic powder before-hand. The 2nd time I made it I added some chopped spinach to the mixture and that was really good as well.  The only thing I highly recommend doing is baking it for 20min,checking it, then baking it more if needed. The 1st time I made it I baked it for exactly 30 min and the chicken was overdone!  The next time I found 20min or so to be perfect.  This was a great alternative to the same ol' chicken, thanks!

I must say that with a few alterations this rocked!  I added spinach, onion, asiago cheese, roasted garlic and used 1/2 lite sour cream & 1/2 low fat mayo.  My son who said I'm not going to like that, loved it!

Yummy! Just made this for me and DH. We both loved it. Used 1/2 light mayo and 1/2 greek yogurt--to save on calories. It was excellent. Didn't have garlic pepper--so used dried garlic/parsley  and some fresh ground pepper. We ate half tonight. I chopped the leftovers  and plan on using it as a topping for whole wheat angel hair for dinner tomorrow night. Glad for the extra juice in pan as it will work with tomorrow nights pasta.

Gave this a three star only because of it lacking in flavour and had to do changes in it This was a good basic recipe to start. Seeing the reviews and noticing that it lacked flavour, I mixed can cream of mushroom soup and a touch of milk with the halved mayo and added the other half sour cream, sprinkled the top with grated marbled cheese and parmesian then topped with broken garlic seasoned croutons. Did add garlic and seasoning salt to the sauce. Also added sauteed onions over the chicken before adding the sauce. It was delicious this way. I don't really like artichokes so the next time I've decided to use cauliflower and broccoli or frozen mixed veggies to simplify it. Served it over rice because the sauce really goes well with it. Yumm. (I actually got the idea from a recipe my sister in law gave me to make pheasant devine.)

This chicken was quick and easy!  I did follow others' recommendations and did half sour cream and half mayo. Pair with rosemary roasted potatoes and green beans for a complete meal.

Great flavor! This is a dish I get hungry for so I make it often.  I also use half mayo and half sour cream.  I like that consistency.

This recipe was really really good. I love Artichoke dip so I thought I would give this a try. I used half Miracle Whip and half light sour cream mixed with the parmesan cheese. I also added 1.5 tsp minced garlic with a sprinkle or salt & pepper. Even though I did squeeze out my artichokes I did still have a clear liquid in the baking pan. It was easy enough to just drain the pan a few times while the chicken was cooking. I had to adjust the oven once and ended up cooking the chicken on 170 forced-fan oven for 40 mins in total. The top browned nicely and overall I thought the recipe was a great find. We had the chicken with a summer salad topped with craisins, slivered almonds, grated light tasty cheese and a light salad dressing. I also served fresh garlic bread and it was a great meal. Thanks again for the recipe.

This was wonderful!  I took other's suggestions and sauteed plain can of artichokes in italian dressing.  I pan seared the chicken and poured the mixture on top. for the mixture i doubled the amount and used half mayo/sour cream, added @2 teaspoons capers,  and dusted with paprika.  I covered and refrigerated, then cooked the next day.  This was a huge hit!  I will make this again.  Wonderful!!!

Definitely not a home run for me.  The artichoke topping was almost separate from the chicken as they really don't combine to make anything.  My oldest scraped the topping off and ate it instead of eating the chicken at all.  This recipe definitely was not worth the calories and isn't something I'll make as it is again.  I know that sounds so brutal, but if I'm going to splurge with this type of caloric and fat content, I want it to be as decadent as the calories and fat say it should be.  I might try it again but would perhaps go with chicken tenders or maybe even bake it as a caserole with cubed chicken so they don't seem like two separate components (you had chicken and then you had topping, but they weren't one dish together).  I might also be tempted to stir in some cream of celery soup, cream cheese or something to make it creamier. I'm sorry that this wasn't a home run for us, but it just didn't live up to our expectations.  We love artichokes and love artichoke dip too so we were hopeful that this would be a great answer for our artichoke cravings.

Yummy! Just like the dip but now its a meal!  Did as someone suggested and cut chicken up, mixed it all together and served over pasta.  This way only had to use 2 chicken breasts.  Delish!

So good! I used more chicken ( 4 full breasts and 4 fillets) because I had so much of the topping. Instead of garlic pepper I used 5 cloves of crushed garlic and fresh ground pepper. I also S&P'd the chicken before topping it. It was great using half a cup of mayo and a quarter of a cup of sour cream. This recipe is going in my regular rotation for sure.

I was out of mayonnaise and no time to run to store so I substituted low-fat cream of chicken soup and it was fabulous!   Next time I will substitute low-fat cream of mushroom soup.

Fabulous, wonderful recipe! Used 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream, and sauteed 3 diced cloves of garlic in a little olive oil, then mixed with chopped marinated artichokes.  Poured over chicken, baked for 30 minutes, then tossed it all with penne pasta and spinach- it was AWESOME and my husband simply loved it. This is going to be a favorite at my house.  :) Thanks!

I made some changes per the suggestions here, but this is really a nice, flexible recipe - the best kind! I did swap out some of the mayo for sour cream, and diced the chicken up and sauteed w/mushrooms.  Then I stirred in the other ingredients and put it in the oven.  The top got nice and brown, and it was very tasty.  Served with white rice and green beans.

I loved this recipe!!!  I did follow everyone else's idea and used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo.  It was NOT oily at all!  I also spread some bread crumbs on top of the chicken and artichoke mixture previous to cooking.  It helped the chicken stay moist and the mixture on the chicken.  I did add some capers and mushrooms.  I also boiled some pasta and put some frozen green peas in with it and it made it delcious!  My boyfriend said it was the best meal I may have made yet!  Will absoultly make this again!  Thanks!

Very good and easy to make! I too chose to use part reduced fat mayo and part reduced fat sour cream. I also used a 4 cheese blend (asiago, fontina, parmesan, provolone) which really added flavor! For a nice twist I added a small amount of white wine into the bottom of the baking dish...this really kept the chicken moist and added flavor! Not just for adults..my 8yr old loved it! This one's a keeper!

This is a great chicken dish!  We loved it.  I added some fresh basil to the mixture and I also used marinated  artichokes, drained. I think if some had problems with it being watery, it may be due to the type of artichoke use.  I have had similar experiences with sourness but not with this. Try marinated for extra   flavor!   It was heavenly.

This was good but not great.  Next time, I will make some changes.  I will pound out the chicken and cook it in a skillet with some olive oil to brown.  I think this will really improve the flavor! Lastly, I would place the artichoke mixture over the chicken and put it under the broiler until brown and bubbly.  Oh yes, and I would use more parmesan cheese.  I couldn't really even taste the parmesan like I had hoped and I used a really good quality parmesan.  By the way, I wouldn't use canned parmesan for this recipe. By making these changes, I think this dish would be really tasty!

Chicken was good, but it needed salt. Chopped spinach mixed in the artichoke mix may be good also.  I'm going to try that next time.

Outstanding! I made this tonight and made two minor changes... shredded Parmesean for the grated and fresh, diced garlic for the garlic pepper. Split the recipe in half for my boyfriend and I, and, WHAT A DISH! Accompanimant: penne with tomatoes, spincah amd mushrooms tossed in a garlic infused olive oil. Will make again and again.

FANTASTIC!  And unbelievably easy.  I  squeezed the excess liquid out of the chopped artichoke hearts, added lemon juice as another reviewer suggested, used fat free mayo and sliced the chicken breasts before baking.  Wonderful!  Definately a keeper.

This was absolutely fantastic! We all loved it and it was a cinch to prepare! I did let it cook for closer to 45 minutes and served it with angel hair pasta and asparagus--I used lowfat mayo to reduce the fat a bit--and I added a clove of fresh garlic (I looked high and low for garlic pepper and couldn't find it anywhere!)--Definetely a keeper!

Very good, but I expected it to be spectacular.  When I read the recipe I knew it would be high in fat, but the layer of grease left on my plate was un-appetizing.  (And I used part low-fat sour cream, part regular mayo.)  I added 3 chopped garlic cloves.  Served with fettucine pasta.  I made the "dip" mixture the day before and really enjoyed eating that with some chips! I might try making this again.  Hubby loved it.

Fantastic!  Like, my eyes rolled back in my head, it was so incredible!  Smelled heavenly.  It was very easy and quick.  I used a jar of marinated artichoke hearts (drained) because that't what I had; used Hellman's Light mayo; added 2 cloves fresh minced garlic; a little dried parsely for color; and sprinkled the top with seasoned breadcrumbs which toasted up nicely and created more of a crusty topping.  Served with sauteed broccoli, onions & roasted red peppers; and Honey Wheat Bread from this site.  Wowee!!!

This was incredible!  I used shredded Parmesan and a little bit of garlic salt and press ground pepper in place of the garlic pepper. I also added a tiny bit of red pepper flakes. I will make this all the time!

Delicious with a few personal touches! I subbed about half the mayo with sour cream, added about a TSP of onion powder, and a bit more garlic powder/pepper than a pinch. I also used 2 halved breasts and seasoned each with S&P.

Never in my life have I had baked chicken turn out so moist and tender.  Never.  When I told DH we were having Parmesan Couscous and Artichoke Chicken for dinner, he make strange gagging sounds and tried to convince me he had a prior engagement with his dentist and couldn't make it home in time for supper.  After much rolling of eyes and literally holding his nose like a 6 year old while trying to get him to take the first bite (I mean really - it's not a pretty dish straight out of the oven), he finally broke down ... and ended up having three plates.  I did use a marinated artichokes, a combo of mayo & sour cream and sprinkled the top with bread crumbs for the last 10 minutes of cooking to brown it up some.  Oh - and now I understand what others meant when talking about water forming on the bottom of the pan - but it was no big deal and I simply drained it off.  Great great recipe - thank you so much for sharing.  UPDATE:   See http://allrecipes.com/customrecipe/64354331/artichoke-chicken/detail.aspx (she added spinach & mushrooms ... sounds good)

Good stuff! I used half mayo and half cream cheese. I also added about a half a package of knorr leek soup mix so basically it was an artichoke dip topped chicken. My husband liked it a lot but said next time to use thinner breasts. I chopped up the leftover chicken  and mixed it with some egg noodles and the leftover artichoke topping. Hubs liked it much better that way.

We loved this.The only thing I did different was add panko breadcrumbs on top of the mixture and spray with butter flavor cooking spray to get it golden brown....delish:)

I have made this several times and it is one of my favorites!  So creamy and so much flavor.  I use skinless, boneless thighs still rolled up as they come from the package (I don't flatten them).  I slice some fennel and onions and then put the thighs on top with the mayo, parm mixture. It takes way more than 30 min.  Maybe 1hr 15 min.

Excellent!  Followed recipe except use chicken tenders instead and season it beforehand.  I've made it with big  chicken breasts and not as good.  I guess the tenders just cook perfectly and more flavorful.

**EDIT**  I have made this several times and tonight got in a hurry and forgot to substitute half of the mayo with the sour cream. Ended up with a bunch of liquid in the pan and not near as good.  So the extra liquid people are experiencing is from the mayo! **EDIT**

Wow, this was great!  I forgot how much I love artichokes.  Definitely salt and pepper the chicken.  Also I substituted over half of the mayo with sour cream per the reviews, used light mayo (could possibly get rid of the mayo all together??), marinated artichokes (squeezed them out a bit before chopping,)and my dish turned out perfect... not too watery or greasy in any way!  I would say if you don't like artichokes you won't like this.  I loved it!

I LOVED this recipe. My daughter, who is very picky ate this also! I thought it had just enough flavor-I followed the recipe but took advantage of the comments to use the sour cream, yogurt, and mayo to equal the mayo amount. I used fresh garlic also. I will make this again-very easy. I sauteed spinach and put the chicken on it-served rice on the side...fantastic. I heard some substitutions for MARINATED artichokes and my sister made that and the marinade made it strange tasting..just my opinion.

This was amazing, simple and quick.  I used light mayo & shredded parm and slopped it on the chicken in the morning for a quick toss into the oven after work.  Huge hit with the family, and the (very few) leftovers were just as good the second night.

Sorry for the mediocre rating but I found this recipe really bland ..... and I thought it read like an absolute winner for me. I followed the recommendation for splitting the mayo with sour cream as I thought the full mayo would be oily and a bit sweet. The cooking time really didn't fully cook the chicken cut as described so I had to cook it a bit longer. I may try it again with several changes to put a bit of "pop" to it.

So good! I used marinated artichoke hearts and it really made the dish! I'm definitely trying the sour cream next time only because the mayo produced a lot if oil but other than that....amazing!

Made this last night.  One large breast was enough for the two of us.  Served it with steamed veggies and toasted asiago bread.  Subbed Greek yogurt for the mayo and used marinated artichokes.  Had no garlic pepper so used pepper and garlic powder.  It was declared company worthy.  The chicken was tender and juicy with a nice tang from the artichoke spread.  Planning to slice a breast and serve it on toasted bread as a sandwich today.

This was delicious!  I took others' advice and sautéed a few mushrooms and fresh minced garlic in a Tbs of butter and added it to the artichoke mixture.  Plus, I mixed light mayo, light sour cream and plain greek yogurt instead of all mayo (about 1/4 cup each to make the 3/4 cup).   It turned out amazing!  Will make again.

Just made this tonight for husband and myself.  I had to make a few substitutions based on what we had on hand. I did not realize that the artichokes we had were in water and not in a marinade. I added a few splashes of red wine vinegar (what I had) and could not find garlic pepper, so added a few cloves of chopped garlic.  Also, I substituted sour cream for most of mayonnaise, since we don't like mayo so much. Still, with these changes, hubby loved chicken. Oh, I also browned the chicken first in a little olive oil since we prefer browned chicken.  This is a very flavorful dish and I will make again since hubby is a artichoke fanatic!  Thanks so much for this recipe. It is truly delicious.

This was yummy! I used half sour cream and half mayo, as others suggested. I ended up having to cook it for about twice as long as the recipe suggested, but it was delicious when it was finally done! Simple, easy, and great tasting!

I made this when my friend and her 2 1/2 year old son came over for dinner. Big hit. Easy and tasty. Served with salad and bread. I actually mixed up the topping the night before and just put it together and stuck it in the oven when I got home from work. I didn't have garlic pepper and used 1/2 tsp minced garlic and some white pepper instead. I used all mayo and thought it tasted great. It was kind of watery as another reviewer said, but I used a slotted spatula and it was fine. If you are curious about what it tastes like, it's like artichoke dip on chicken. And you can't go wrong with either of those!

This was really good after making a few changes.  First, because my breasts were really large, I sprinkled them with garlic salt and pepper and quickly browned them in EVOO.  For the mixture, I used canned artichoke (drained & chopped), fresh shredded parmesan, only 2/3 cup light mayo, and a little oregano and parsley. I put that mixture over the chicken and topped that off with Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I then baked it for 35 minutes and then switched it to broil for the last 5 to brown the topping.  So good!  I served it with buttered parsley egg noodles and sauted fresh spinach with pressed garlic in EVOO.  I will be making this one again.  I might try half sour cream/mayo as suggested by others, but after the changes I already made, that might not make it any better.

Made mostly as is, used the 1/2 mayo 1/2 sour cream thing. Hubby really liked it...really liked it, but he likes to tweek. He said maybe next time make it thinner (the sauce)...maybe add some feta cheese and serve over egg noodles. Just his suggestion in case anyone wants to try it.....oh, and my picky 9 year old even liked it...I was expecting to hear yuckies out of him...but he agreed with his dad that it was really flavorful.....btw...the picky 9 year old is demanding that I erase that last comment...sorry kid, I speak only the truth

Parmesan a little strong, but I prefer no sour cream as others have suggested for less creaminess. My picky 9 year old who only eats strawberry waffles for dinner actually preferred this over waffles, and was happy that she was able to trade them away. Shocking. Definitely keep.

Good and easy.  I easily covered 5 medium to large chicken breasts with the mayo/artichoke mixture.  I cooked mine for 45 minutes at 375.  They were most and flavorful.  I did crack some sea salt on my chicken before putting mixture on top.  I also added buttered panko bread crumbs that also had basil flakes mixed in, on top....This added a nice golden color to the top and additional flavor.  I will make this again.

I followed M. Howland's suggestion in cutting the mayo in half and substituting the other half with sour cream.  Also, I added a tablespoon or two of heavy cream, as I was going to serve it on rice.  My husband loved it and proclaimed it expensive restaurant food.

This recipe was incredibly easy to make.  I added a bit too much mayonnaise, but even then it was still very good.  Definitely will make again.

Absolutely delish!  I took the advice of a few of the other reviewers & used equal portions of mayonnaise and sour cream to make up the 3/4 c. instead of just mayonnaise.  I also sauteed minced garlic instead of using garlic pepper and just seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper.  I used the marinated artichokes as suggested.  They were so delicious, I used 2-12 oz. jars of them instead of 1-15 oz. can.  Everyone in my house loved this recipe, even my hubby, who is not a big fan of chicken or artichokes.  Thank you for sharing this recipe and thank you to everyone for their excellent suggestions.

Loved this! Tweaked a lil for taste and came out super yummers. Used 1 small jar of marinated artichokes drained & chopped, 1 container of fresh sliced mushrooms sauteed, the parm and mixed with about half the mayo suggested (really just added/mixed till it had a good consistency). Placed the mix on the chix then topped with a light sprinkling of Italian bread crumbs (makes the final result look as good as it is). Baked for 30 minuted, let cool for 5 then devoured :)

I made as directed and it was pretty good but my chicken turned out tough for some reason.  The flavor of the sauce was good though.  My husband said it tasted like artichoke dip.  I may try it again.

Adding to my review to say that this has become a standby recipe in our house. We love it and it is an easy and delicious weekday dinner!

Wow! This chicken is to die for. I know a good recipe when I get that "Oh my god!" response from my husband when he takes his first bite. Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, this made AWESOME leftovers the next day! I will definitely be making this again and again, and would consider cooking this for special occasions, it tastes that great! Like something you can get only at a fancy restaurant!

This was really good and super easy.  Make sure to rinse and drain canned artichokes really well as the brine is super salty.  I might try adding mushrooms next time.

I gave the recipe 5 stars for being delicious and super easy. I did make a few modifications because I'm trying to lose weight. Instead of 3/4 cup of mayo I used 1/2 cup of low fat sour cream and 1/4 cup of fat free mayo. The artichokes I used were marinated, simply because that is what I had on hand. I seasoned the chicken with salt and freshly ground black pepper. I added 2 cloves of fresh garlic and a splash of white wine to the artichoke mixture. Some italian seasoned Panko bread crumbs would be really good on top, but I didn't try it because of the added calories. Thanks so much for such a simple and tasty recipes!

I just made this chicken for the first time. My 16 year old daughter helped with the 10 min prep. We were amazed with the simplicity of such a wonderful dish! Everyone in the family loved it, and had seconds. This is a recipe that I will keep forever, and I'm sure my daughter will make it for her family, when she grows up as well!

Good fast recipe that taste wonderful. We used 1/2 sour cream and miracle whip, real garlic, and added mushrooms. Served it over pasta.  Chicken was not done in 30mins and had to cook it an additional 20.

Very moist, tender chicken. I had only a little regular mayo left in the jar, so I topped it off with the new mayo made with olive oil.  I don't know if that made a difference or not, but the chicken got raves from my family.

With embellishments such as spinach and mushrooms, and definitely using half sour cream, this was a 5 star recipe. Next time I think I'll try substituting plain yogurt instead of sour cream even!

Great starter recipe! I used one can of artichoke hearts, used 1/2 cup plain greek yogurt and 1/4 cup lite mayo as some suggested. I added a minced garlic clove to the artichoke sauce as well. I also put one small container of sliced mushrooms on top of the chicken/artichoke mix, topped with breadcrumbs and drizzled with olive oil. Yum!

Absolutely delicious!  I took some of the suggestions of previous posters and made it with 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo.  I also added mushrooms, onions and cracker crumbs on top.  I served it with rice and it was fantastic.

A little too heavy even though I used half-fat mayo.  Nice tender chicken though just the topping was too much.  I added two large garlic gloves and still bland.

Very tasty. I added garlic and used frozen artichokes and substituted half the mayo with sour cream which gave it a nice zing. Topped it with breadcrumbs and paprika. And put under the broiler for a few seconds.

this was pretty tasty, and very moist, however I try to cut fat wherever I can...so I used plain non-fat greek yogurt (a substitute staple in my house for mayo and sour cream) instead and crushed one garlic clove and a pinch of pepper. dee-lish!

So good.  I actually only used 2 chicken breast halves, so there would be extra artichoke sauce to put over rice.  My husband said this is the best thing I've ever made.

This was a very good recipe.  I also took the recommendation of others and used half mayo and half sour cream.  I added 3 cloves chopped garlic and about 1 cup grated mozz. cheese to the artichoke mixture.  Seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper and garlic powder.  Sprinkled with seasoned bread crumbs.  Very tasty.

I have had this recipe in my recipe box forever. Kept on putting off making it but i should have made this a long time ago. My husband went on all night long about this chicken. He loved it. I used low fat mayo inseat and i think i will use reduced fat parmezan cheese for next time. There will be a next time i am sure. it was so easy. took zero effort and made my hubby happy :)

I followed the suggestion of 1/2 sour cream & 1/2 mayo, and also added some sauted spinach. It was quick, easy and delicious. I will be making this again.

Fantastic!! Restaurant quality! Husband got home late and ate 3 pieces cold and he raved about it. Modified for dairy allergy, and also, did not have everything on hand, but still turned out amazing. Used 1/3 cup mayo, 1 packet walden farms ranch dressing and 1/2 cup yodeling goat gouda cheese and only 7.5 oz can of artichokes. Substitutions made only because that's what I had on hand, plus son can't have parmesan cheese,  but truly  fantastic, so would be even better I'm sure, as written!!

Great dish! Very easy to make low fat. Decreased the amount of mayo and cheese to 1/3 cup, used only 2 breasts and used low fat products. Came out delish!! This will be part of the rotation in our house for sure!

Loved this.  Did as others and used 1/4 mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  I had thick pieces of chicken, so it took longer than 30 minutes, about 1 1/4 hour for the chicken to cook through. Next time I will pound the chicken a little thinner to cut down on the cooking time.

I was thinking only four stars, but the fact that I kept going back and eating more of the topping off the chicken, I guess I got to give it five :-)  I used lite mayonnaise, but followed the directions otherwise!

GREAT basic recipe!  But like all cooks I tweaked it and I think it's even better with pesto substituted for half the mayo and 1/4 tsp salt added.  I also have thrown in onion slices, mushrooms etc & subbed thighs for the breasts since I prefer them.  It's wet in the bottom but I just drain the juice out & pour it over the dog's breakfast the next day!  One of my FAVORITE 'net recipe finds, thank you Amanda Bibb!

I used the suggestion of others doing 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 mayo and sprinkled with paprika and cayenne.  I also used marinated artichoke hearts because that’s all I had in my pantry.  It was delicious, will def make again.  The only problem I encountered was that it took more like 50-60 mins to cook, not 30!!

Easy, quick and delicious. Good for a quick family meal and worthy for dinner guests. Recipe is great as is... I have also added some jarred crushed garlic. This will become a staple recipe. Have passed it on to many friends and always rave reviews to follow! Enjoy!

This was pretty good. At first I was going to give it 4 starts because I didn't think it was spectacular, but the boyfriend seemed to like it and I really did too. I use half mayonaisse and half sourcream mixt because I don't like using a ton of mayonaisse for things. Overall really good and I wil make this again.

Excellent, unique flavor. Moist chicken. Definite crowd pleaser. Very easy and quick to prepare. Finished in the broiler for a couple minutes to add a bit of brown - must watch carefully to avoid burning.

It was ok.  Nothing stellar as the reviews suggested.  Kind of oily even with the substitution of the sour cream.  All in all it was a super easy dish that sort of fell flat. Great if you are in a rush or are a beginner in the kitchen.   I actually don't think I would make it again.  Not good enough to be a keeper.

This was delicious.  I took some advice and did half mayo/half sour cream.  I doubled the sauce and was going to add mushrooms - I will next time for sure.  I also put panko crumbs on top and broiled for last five minutes.  We loved the crunch!

I made this tonight and baked it on top of a bed of baby spinach and added chopped bacon into the artichoke mixture. Very easy and incredibly flavorful! I highly recommend these variations. =] Enjoy!

Not as flavorful as I expected. I will make again but next time I will use artichokes sold in jars that are marinated in oil and vinegar...so flavorful. My aunt makes artichoke dip using jarred artichokes, she drains all the oil off and all of us can't get enough of her dip. I should of done that with this recipe but I wanted to stay true to the instructions. The dish was bland and really not worth all the work and rich ingredients.

Delicious, melt in your mouth chicken.  I give this 5 stars after some minor adjustments.  The first time I made this recipe I followed everything exactly as it was written. It turned out good, but was a little greasy. I think this was the mayo, so when I made it for the 2nd time last night I substituted half the mayo with light sour cream.  I also added a couple cloves of crushed garlic and some frozen, chopped spinach (thawed and drained), and increased the garlic pepper to 3/4 of a teaspoon.  Wow! I will definitely be adding this recipe to my regular rotation. My 15 year old son LOVED it, spinach, artichokes and all.

Excellent recipe.  I took the suggestions of others and, to make it lower fat, I used 2/4 low fat mayo and 1/4 cup of light sour cream.  I had reduced fat parmesan cheese and used minced garlic.  of course, I did season my chicken with salt and pepper and thyme.  Delicious!!!

This dish is so delicious and so super easy.  It works great as written and there's plenty of opportunity to play around with it.  I like to add some minced garlic, a squirt of lemon juice, maybe some diced Kalamata olives.  It's really makes a restaurant quality dish. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Where has this recipe been all my life!??  It was so so so good.  I wanted to lick the plate afterward!  I substituted half light sour cream and half reduce fat mayo in place of the full amount of mayo to make it a touch healthier.  I also did not have garlic pepper, so I used a tablespoon of minced garlic (the kind you get in a jar), plus a pinch of salt and pepper.  I will make this again and again!

Definetely took everyone's advice and swapped some of the mayo. Didn't have sour cream but swapped it for strained yogurt. Did 1/4 mayo,  and 1/2 cup yogurt.  Was very good. Would definetely make it again.

Love this!! Used half mayo/half sour cream and it was really tasty.  I would probably use a little less cheese next time, but it was still really good as is.  I also broiled it the last few minutes for a crispy topping- yum!!

Really great easy recipe with ingredients on hand. Only two changes: I used a jar of marinated artichokes and drained the juice to cook chicken in.  I also halfed the called for amount of mayo and used half sour cream instead.  Put it in a cassarole dish with al dente penne pasta and baked with grated parm on top until bubbly.  Delish!

I did not care for this.  Kind of a big, sloppy, mayonnaise mess.    My husband agreed.    Kind of a bummer, because it was so easy, but we didn't like the way it tasted or looked.

Pretty good. I did 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream and added sauteed mushrooms. It did need a little seasoning before serving, but overall good.

Great versatile recipe!  I normally sub half sour cream and mayo, only because i am not a huge fan of mayo.  Also, usually use dried parm.  I normally make it as a pasta sauce (double mayo, sour cream, artichokes, parm) and chop up the chicken over penne.  Have added bacon, sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms (in any combination) and it's delicious.

This recipe caught my husband off-guard.  He went on and on about how great it was!  I substituted sour cream for the mayonaise (I'm not a fan of hot mayonaise).  I used marinaded artichokes (I squeezed them dry), and covered the dish with panko bread crumbs.  This dish was quick, easy, and delicious.  That's worth 5 stars in my book!

Amazing!  And dont forget easy.  I made this for a church function for 60 people and the program ran long so I had to put it back in to reheat and it is a very forgiving recipe.  The chicken breast were still moist even after being cooked for probably an hour too long. My family and friends love it and now they all have the recipe.   30 minutes and dinner is ready!

I really liked this recipe. However, I almost messed it up. I grabbed lemon pepper instead of garlic pepper and didn't notice until I put it in the over. I sprinkled some garlic powder over the top and was really worried that I had ruined dinner, but knowing that artichoke and lemon go well, I went ahead with the altered recipe. I also made it with half mayo, half sour cream. It was 5 star delicious! I'm going to make as per the recipe next time, though I can't image it could have been any better. Served with rice. Very fast and easy to pull together and looks elegant and tastes so good.

Very delicious. Instead of 3/4 c. mayo, I used approximately 1/3 c. olive oil mayo and 2/3 c. light sour cream. Sautéed some mushrooms and garlic and served all over pasta.

Great recipe! The family loved it and it was quick and easy. Like others I used sourcream with the mayo, used marinated artichokes, added a couple of chopped mushrooms, and some mozzarella cheese. I also sprinkled bread crumbs on top. It's a great recipe thats easy to adjust to your liking. I'll be making this for our next dinner party! Thanks!

Absolutely the most juiciest and flavorful chicken! I was hoping to add sour cream as other reviewers have suggested, but didn't have any, so I added a squeeze of ranch dressing and a squeeze of dijon mustard to give the sauce more flavor. The artichokes were nicely tangy and covered the chicken wonderfully. I served this with fully loaded baked potatoes and my family and I were pleasantly stuffed afterwards. :)

This was a very good meal. It was a little salty and I did not add the extra salt to the chicken. So maybe leave that out.

I've made this recipe a half dozen times already since January and each time it has gotten better and better with little tweaks. I use a can of marinated artichoke hearts, chopped fine, 1/2 a red onion diced,2 pressed cloves of garlic, salt and pepper and sour cream and mayo. I found that 2 parts sour cream to one part mayo ratio makes it creamy and not oily but still adds that rich flavor. Ive used both chicken tenders as well as breasts and prefer the tenders. I coat the chicken in the mixture and set in the pan, then spread the rest of the mixture over the chicken. I've also sprinkled the parm or mozz cheese is I was out of parm over the top about 5 minutes before it was done.  It has come out great everytime!!

This was a really easy recipe and had a nice flavor!  I used a low-fat mayo and sour cream mix as other reviewers had suggested.  Instead of garlic pepper I used fresh garlic and black pepper.  I also had to cook it a little longer than the recipe said to.
Good base recipe.  Even though I liked it a lot I thought it could use a little something more.  Not sure what though.  I will definitely make it again as is or maybe try it with some new additions!

Not our favorite.  Would suggest pureeing the artichoke hearts and then pouring it on the chicken before baking.  Straight from the can the artichoke hearts were kind of a strange texture when finished.

This is my first review ever on all recipes, actually on any recipe site. I love this recipe! It's so easy. I substituted half non fat plain yogurt for the half of the mayo. My family loves this! I love it.

How does something that easy taste that good?  I followed other reviewers' advice and used 1/2 mayonnaise and 1/2 low fat sour cream.  I also marinated the artichokes in italian dressing and minced garlic overnight and then squeezed them out before adding to the mixture.  I doubled the sauce overall so that I could toss it with linguine.  What a great dish!  It would be easy to add chopped spinach, mushrooms, or squash to this and get a full meal.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent .... would give it more stars, if I could.  I used 1 large garlic clove (minced) and ground pepper.  There was a lot of sauce.  I served it over rice = YUM. Next time, I will try the 1/2 mayo + 1/2 sour cream combination and maybe cut down on the amount of sauce.  I cannot wait to make this again, and again, and again.  Thanks so much!!

WOW!  This is incredibly easy and incredibly delicious! I had 5 chicken breasts and sliced them into strips before cooking for easier serving and faster cooking. I also increased the topping ingredients some to accomodate the extra chicken.  To lighten this up some, I used 1 cup Reduced Fat Parmesan, and a ratio of 1/4 cup mayo to 3/4 cup Light Sour Cream for the mayo (thanks to suggestions from other reviewers!).  I had no garlic pepper, so I sprinkled garlic powder and a little fresh cracked pepper on the chicken and in the topping.  I also added some minced onion to the topping.  I added NO additional salt; this was plenty salty from the artichokes, parmesan, etc.  I sprinkled a little 2% shredded 4-cheese blend on the top for the last 15 minutes.   Total cooking time was about 40 minutes and the chicken was perfectly cooked and very juicy.  Rave reviews from my 3.5 yr old and my parents, and neither my father or my child is a fan of artichokes!  I will definitely make this regularly!

This recipe was absolutely delicious!!!
My husband loved it as well. I also did half sour cream instead of all mayonaise. Besides that, I wouldn't change a thing.

Yet another great simple weeknight dinner! I serve this with a salad and it makes a great meal. I also add 10oz. of spinach to the mixture, which I highly suggest...it is almost like adding chicken to spinach and artichoke dip, so good!

I was not thrilled with this.  I thought I would be after reading reviews and I love artichokes.  My husband did say it was delicious, but I was disappointed.  I guess I thought the topping would melt down some and it didn't.  It was very thick on the chicken.  I pounded the chicken as other reviewers suggested, so the chicken was on the thin side and the topping overwhelmed it.  It was like taking a big bite of sour cream and mayo (I did do 1/2 sour cream and half mayo as other reviewers suggested).  I scraped half of it off my chicken and spread the rest really thin and then it was better, but I still ended up leaving half of it uneaten and was not impressed.  It did look and smell great as it came out of the oven and I thought I had a new dish for when company came over, but after eating it I've decided I won't be making this again.  Maybe if it was made more like a spinach artichoke dip like other reviewers suggested....

My husband was skeptical, but ended up loving this! Because of earlier reviewers, I used mixed Miracle Whip and sour cream, and threw in some crumbled feta I had in the fridge.  I used canned artichokes, and chopped them on paper towel, but next time I'll squeeze the water out better, although it wasn’t too bad.  Worried about blandness, I put in some basil paste, a bit of asiago/parmesan/olive oil tapenade I had in the fridge, and topped the mixture-covered chicken with a bit of Parmesana Reggiano I had leftover from grating.  I used a pinch of garlic powder and fresh cracked black pepper, no salt because of the salty cheeses.  I served it with steamed asparagus topped with a lemon-dill sauce.  Very nice flavour, and 30 minutes at 350 in my convection oven was perfect.

Wonderful!  Husband thought it was good, but rich.  I didn't - I thought it was perfect!  I wanted a 2nd serving so badly, but decided to save it for the next days lunch.  Cut the chicken up in cubes, tossed with remaining sauce/juices and places over plain noodles.  Yum!  I made this as written, except with Light Mayo - worked just fine!

I used the marinated artichoke hearts as suggested by other reviewers. I also used a combo of light sour cream and mayo to cut some fat. The end result was fantastic! Everyone loved it and the leftovers were scrumptious. Thanks!

My mom slightly baked and chopped up the chicken beforehand, sort of like in a casserole. We took people's advice and used some sour cream, some mayonnaise. We didn't use a whole can of artichoke hearts, because honestly, they smell weird and don't have the best taste, yet my parents love them. The artichoke hearts were easy to cut because they're in layers (like onions!). We forgot the garlic powder and paprika someone suggested, but it still tasted good! We'll be sure to remember it to add more flavor next time!

My family LOVED this recipe. My husband does not usually like chicken breasts but he called this recipe "heavenly" chicken and ate at least two servings. I did pound the chicken breasts flat so that they would cook evenly and actually be done in the 30 minute cooking time. That was the only variation that I made and everyone raved about the dish. It was so simple I almost felt guilty accepting the compliments.

I'd give this dish 6 stars if I could! It's savory, rich, and definitely a cook-again recipe!  I did add some sauteed button mushrooms and red pepper to the final product. I also upped the amount of sauce and used marinated artichokes + cnned artichockes; I also followed the half mayo-half sour cream advice... THIS DISH IS REALLY GOOD.

This is an excellent recipe! I used frozen artichoke hearts instead, they have a lot more flavor, I just cooked them according to the package and drained them really good first. I also used minced garlic and pepper instead of the garlic pepper! Awesome, my husband really loved this. It's really elegant for company but is soo easy to prepare. This is the second time I have made this! Thanks for the great post!

Delicious!  I think I cooked mine a little too long, as it got a little dry, but it got rave reviews from everyone there, including my picky husband.  I put it on a bed of spinach (which unfortunately cooked down to just about nothing), put sauted onions on top, then the dressing, then some bacon.  It was delicious!  I served it with tri-color rotini and a salad.  Fantastic!

This was an excellent recipe! I used a can of artichokes from Trader Joe's and used Best Food's Mayo.  I did squeeze out excess juices from the artichokes.  I also used lots of garlic powder and black pepper in the mixture.  I sliced up 2 small italian squash into circles and lined a glass casserole dish.  I chopped up 1 more squash into small squares and sprinkled them on top of the mayo mixture after I layered it on the chicken.  I increased the cooking time by an extra 10 minutes, then turned off the oven, and let it sit for another 15 minutes to allow the squash to brown.  Once it was done, I sprinkled crushed red pepper on top for color.  It was beautiful, tasty and absolutely easy to make.  I would recommend this for everyone.  After searching high and low for the perfect side dish to go with recipe, I decided on a green salad made with romaine hearts, tomatoes and topped with dressing.  Very filling and yummy!

I adored this recipe! Like others recommended, I used half fat-free mayo and half lite sour cream, added a couple shakes kosher salt.I also used fresh garlic (2 cloves, I love garlic) and I think that it makes the mixture.Oh! And I squeezed the artichokes by hand,I didn't want the dish to be watery. I seasoned the chicken breasts with adobo (dry caribbean/puertorrican seasoning),sliced them in half and browned them in a little olive oil.I put breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese on top. The smell was wonderful! I baked it for 40 minutes and broiled it for 2-3 minutes.Next time, I may add spinach!

So quick & easy to prep, after I put it in the oven I went to re-read the recipe twice more to make sure everything was actually done! FH and I LOVED this! He had seconds. I used marinated artichoke hearts (well drained), half mayo & half sour cream, 5 cloves of fresh garlic (chopped). Dashed a small bit of cajun seasoning onto the chicken breasts before adding artichoke mixture on top. Next time will try adding 1 tbsp non-pariel capers to mix. Very flavorful. Baked in a 9x13 baking pan at 375 for 25 mins. Served with white rice but will add a salad next time or even make bruschetta. Definitely a keeper! I can see it would be a wonderful mix for dip, too. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband took one bite and said that this was a definate keeper. Delicious and really easy. The only change I made was substituting sour cream for 1/2 the mayo as per the other reviews. I also topped it off with bread crumbs and served it over fettucine. Yum!

This is a great recipe that I've used for quite some time.  To add flavor, however, I always add 1-2 Tsps curry powder (depending on your taste).  I also sprinkle fresh grated Parmesan on the top to give it a bit of a crust.

There are no words to describe how great this meal is. I listened to the other reviews and used half mayo half sour cream. My boyfriend LOVED it! I will definitly cook this again sometime SOON. I might add chopped up spinach next time.

This was fabulous! I used 1/2 cup of light mayo and 1/4 cup of fat free plain yogurt. I don't have any "garlic pepper", so I used a pinch of garlic powder and a dash of lemon pepper. I topped the casserole with a sprinkling of buttered breadcrumbs. I also reduced the heat to 350 and added about 8 minutes to the baking time. I could smell the yummy aroma almost immediately, and thought maybe it was cooking too hot. The whole family thought this was delicious, even the kids who at first said they'd never eat artichokes!

I really enjoyed making this dish. I had the stuff I needed already, and didn't have to run out for anything... I did do some substituting, though... I did as some other reviewers said about the 1/2 cup of mayo and the 1/4 cup sour cream. For the garlic pepper, I used 5 cloves of minced garlic and lots of fresh ground pepper. I rinsed the artichokes to remove some of the oil. I did have some shredded parmesan cheese leftover, so I sprinkled it on top before baking. I served it with buttered egg noodles and honey wheat rolls. I bet it would go good with white or brown rice as well. Thanks so much for this quick and easy delicious recipe I can add to my list!

so easy, so yummy! I served it with asparagus and mashed potatoes and it was a hit! I did end up using half mayo/half sour cream and it was awesome. I also seasoned the chicken with salt & pepper and pressed garlic into the breasts before spreading the artichoke mixture on top.

the first time I made this I cut back on the mayo, the chicken was dry.. the second time I made it I used more cheese and the correct amounts but I added chopped fresh mushrooms. it was one of the best chicken breast recipes I have ever tasted... you could serve this to any guest and they would love it.

This was so fast and easy. After reading the other reviews I used half light mayo and half regular sour cream. It was still rich and creamy without being oily. Served with angel hair pasta and baby spinach.Awesome!

Amazing, and amazingly bad for you at the same time. Don't eat this more than once a month even though you'll want to eat it everynight. I have to fight the urge to make it again tonight. Cooking time was exact!

It wasn't bad.  The artichokes and parmesean did add a little extra flavor to the chicken and it was easy to prepare.  I think, however, would it have been better stuffed in the chicken?  I didn't rate 3 stars because anything was bad in this.  Just was a pleasant change to the pace, but really.  nothing more.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I was just looking for a dish to make with the can of Artichoke Hearts in my pantry. I was so surprised at how much I really enjoyed this dish. Thats never happened before!!! Husband was a little scared becuase of the way it looked/smelled but he really enjoyed it to. Chicken was very very moist. I will be making this again for sure. Excellent meal for a weeknight quick dish.

This was so-so to me.  I was surprised because it sounded really good.  It certainly may be an individual thing, because I don't like alot of mayonnaise, and the artichokes were still a bit too briny.  Maybe with some adjustments it would be better, but I just didn't care for it as much as I'd hoped.

Super fast and easy.  Great "fancy" weeknight meal.  I cut my chicken into strips so it would cook faster.  The only thing I added were a few shakes of celery salt.  YUM.

This is by far the easiest recipe I have ever tried. Takes about 10 minutes to put together. I followed the recipe to the letter (although I did salt and pepper the chicken before I put the artichoke mixture on). YUMMY! YUMMY! YUMMY! I have forwarded the recipe to friends and family so they can try it too.

Very flavorful.  Used half mayo and half sour cream and added bread crumbs on top per suggestions here.  Should have cut the chicken breasts into strips to speed cooking time and more evenly distribute flavor.   ..I had really huge  chicken breasts

I was not crazy about this. Maybe it was the artichokes I used, they were rather briney. I followed the sour cream suggestion and it probably helped but I just didnt think this was super flavorful.

Based on other reviews, I used 1/2 Mayo and 1/2 sour cream, and also tossed some italian breadcrumbs on the top. This turned out great! My husband, who is not a big fan of chicken, loved it.

Excellent!  The first time I made it, I thought it had too much of a mayo flavor so the next time, I used 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream.  I also added about 1 tbsp of horseradish.  Much better the second time.  One of our favorites!

I had artichokes left over from a previous meal and was looking for just the right recipe. This was it! I loved  it and the fact that it took literally 10 mins. to put together was another plus. I didn't make any changes..followed it exactly. Will definitely make again.......soon.

I love this recipe and make it all the time.  I've even given it to friends.  I make it with the flash-frozen chicken breasts that come in the big bags and I cook for 40 minutes.  I serve over penne.  We love it.

Delicious & low carb, but a little greasy... I've made this several times - the last time was the best. Here are a couple of tips: use half sour cream & half mayo, the last 10 minutes turn the oven up to 400-450 to brown the top and drain off some of the juices after pulling it out of the oven. I also added 3 cloves of garlic, sliced water chestnuts, 1 tbs djion for added zip, 1/2 a red onion finely chopped and a little more cheese.  My parents can't get enough of this one. Presto a greasy, flavorful masterpiece!

I made this recipe and was out of real mayonaise.  I used Miracle Whip which tasted horrible.  Just wanted to warn others not to make the same mistake.

SUPER good! I cut up the chicken into slices when I made it, but next time I will cut up the pieces even smaller (bite size) to make serving easier. The "sauce" was soooo good. I think I will double that next time. I added fresh mushrooms to it and ended up with quite a bit of water in the dish after cooking. I don't know if it came from the mushrooms or the artichokes, so next time I will sautee the mushrooms first. Important to squeeze out as much excess liquid from the artichokes as you can. Really easy recipe & really really good! Will make over & over.

I used a full 14 oz. bag of frozen artichokes, more chicken and added 1/2 cup feta cheese as someone recommended for added flavor.  It was delicious and even better reheated after being refrigerated all night!

OK, I was totally surprised I didn't care for this much, since I love artichokes and it's similar to the "Broiled Tilapia Parmesan", which I make all the time.  I think it would help to grill or brown the chicken first as some reviewers did and maybe to broil the chicken a bit at the end.  My topping did not get brown or crusty, just seemed to make my chicken greasy and unappetizing.

3 stars for the recipe as is, but 5 stars after making the following changes: decrease mayo to 1/2 cup, add 1/4 cup sour cream (to thin out the sauce) and add some capers. It was much better after making these changes. Everyone I served it to loved it!

This was so good.  I did brown the chicken first in a bit of olive oil with italian seasonings.  The sauce is so good.  Even my 13 year old son loved it.  It is on the rich side, I only used 3 chicken breasts and cut them in 1/3's.  We still have two pieces left for a yummy snack.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made a couple of changes of my own.  I used 1/2 cup of Gruyer cheese and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan, which created a very nice melted top.  I also topped the artichoke /cheese mixture with some seasoned bread crumbs that added a nice crunchy texture after broiling it for a couple of minutes at the end. Great recipe!

This recipe is the greatest!  So easy and delicious!  I have made this four or five times since I found the recipe.  My husband who isn't a big fan of chicken requests this and licks his plate clean.  A great use of artichoke hearts.

This was pretty good...I used fat-free mayo and marinated artichoke hearts because it was all that i had.  The fat-free mayo turned out fine, but i didn't really like the marinated artichokes...too sour in this dish!!  So next time I will definitley try the water packed ones.  I also may try adding some spinach to the topping (I love spinach and artichoke dip, so why not?)...and maybe some fresh tomatoes at the end for color.  I used fresh garlic, and then added some garlic powder at the end when there wasn't enough of a garlic flavor.  I also scaled this dish down to one chicken breast (it was all that I had and I was the only one eating), but doubled the topping and served it over pasta.  This was definitley the way to go!!  I may make this again

Good!  I also took the advice of other reviewers and added 1 clove pressed garlic.  Also used the sour cream with the mayo.  My kids didn't like the artichokes, but ate the chicken.  The grown ups loved the meal and there were no leftovers.

This recipe is great--I've eaten the chicken 2 nights in a row, and still keep thinking about it!  I used low-fat mayo, which worked great.  I made the artichoke sauce per instructions, however, then sprinkled shredded motzerrella/parmesan cheese on top of sauce.  Then sprinkled Italian bread crumbs over cheese & sprayed with Pam.  This made a crunchy crust, which added nice texture.

Thanks so much for this recipe--I will be making this often!

For an unbelievably easy recipe, this one sure tastes good!  Just to add a little more interest I added a teaspoon of dried herbes d' provence.  Another good options would be basil.  Serve with steamed broccoli to use up sauce on the plate.  YUM!

This was wonderful! I used 2 small cloves of minced garlic and fresh pepper. Next time I will substitute some sour cream for the mayonaise and maybe add a little white wine to thin it out. I want to have more of a sauce so that I can serve this with pasta. Will make this over and over!

Very good recipe, especially if you love, like we do, the infamous Artichoke Dip. I used a large can and a small jar of artichokes, which I whirled in the food processor with only about two heaping tablespoons of the mayo. I also added garlic and onion powders, black pepper, a squeeze of lemon juice and extra parm on top which I broiled for a minute or two once the dish was out of the oven. My kids had been bugging me to make the dip, so this was the perfect dinner solution. Thanks so much Ardrury!!

This recipe is a keeper. My husband loved it. I used only 1/2 c parmesan, and 1/2 c of hellman's light mayo and it came out great. Also, I threw in about 1/4c of coarsely chopped kalamata olives (because my husband loves them). This recipe made plenty of topping - so I served over brown rice - delicious. Thanks for the recipe.

What a great chicken recipe.  This was so easy and quick to make.  I also added a large clove on minced garlic and used 1/3 cup mayo and 1/3 cup sour cream.  I did not have on hand fresh parmesan cheese so I substituted an "Italian Blend" of shredded cheese.  I would not hesitate to serve this for a dinner party.  My husband loved it!

Based on some excellent reviewers suggestions, I made some minor modifications.  First, used boneless, skinless thighs because I had them.  Used light Kraft mayo and substituted fat-free sour cream for half the mayo.  Also sauteed a shallot and two cloves of minced garlic to add to mayo/sour cream mixture.  I baked this at 375 degrees for 45 minutes and it was not quite done.  I recommend adding another 5 minutes.  Overall, the taste was very nice and I would make again.

Great for the whole family. This is that ubiquitous artichoke dip from the '60s baked over the top of chicken breasts. As with the dip, I added 2 large cloves of garlic and about 2 tbsp fresh parsley. For the kids, I scraped off the topping to remove the toxic flavoring ;-) after baking and they loved it!

This was wonderful.  I used 3 chicken breasts, split.  My husband browned them with salt and pepper in oil.  I used 2   12 3/4 oz artichoke hearts (small) in water as we do not like the marinated ones,(too much oil, but love artichoke.)) To the mixture, I added the chopped artichoke hearts, 3/4 cup of grated Parmesan, 1/3 cup shredded pepper jack,  1/2 cup mayo, 1/4 cup light sour cream,  3 chopped
Green onion and 4-5 chopped spinach leaves. 
After we topped the chicken breasts with the artichoke mixture, I sprinkled the chicken breasts with garlic bread crumbs and then some paprika.  We baked for 45 mins at 375. Wowza!!  We loved the flavor.  I served this with cilantro lime rice- as the chicken is  rich in flavor, I wanted something lighter as a side.  It was wonderful!!

I make dish often, as it’s easy and delicious with the following changes:  I cut up the chicken breasts into 1/2 inch cubes.  Also, I add 15 minutes to total cooking time, and raise oven temperature to 400 for those last 15 minutes.

This is easy and delicious.  People think you worked hard preparing a gourmet dish and it is really so easy.  Even people that didn't know it had artichokes and didn't like them ate it at a baby shower and loved it.  Go for it!  Thanks Amanda for this amazing dish!

I've made the topping as a dip many times, only with a few teaspoons of fresh squeezed lemon juice in the mix.  So, when I made this recipe, I did the same.  I used the entire topping amount on only two boneless, skinless breasts.  I was nervous about the 375 for 30 minutes being enough, so I put three long, vertical slices deep in each breast before topping them.  My husband showed me how he was able to cut through the breast (big, too) with only his fork!  He asked for this again and to NOT change a thing.  I served with chicken stock-cooked white rice and lemon roasted cauliflower.  Now the husband wants to have this topping on a good piece of fish.  Stay tuned.

Very good and the chicken was very moist. I did use half mayo, half sour cream like many reviews said, plus I squeezed my marinated artichokes a bit but I still ended up with some liquid in my dish. I would also make sure that people you serve this to like artichokes, obviously.

Excellent dish, and so easy.  I used a half cup of mayo and a half cup of sour cream--a little more than the recipe calls for because I also added a large half bag of thawed frozen spinach--and I subbed out the mozzarella for mild cheddar and added red pepper flakes.  I only used two large chicken breasts and cut them into cubes rather than leave them whole, to make it more of a casserole dish, and did not brown them first, I don't think this step is necessary.  It did take longer to cook than what the recipe states, about 45 minutes.   Delicious!

This was very easy, and tasted good. I used marinated artichoke hearts but I'm not convinced the extra flavor was needed. I had more than enough to coat both sides of all 4 breasts, and still had to throw a significant amount away. Next time I may try doing half mayo, half sour cream, just for variety. I chopped the artichokes up finely in my food processor.

So I decided to do the half mayo, half sour cream, then I added cream cheese too. I also omitted the garlic spice and added chopped garlic, plus some fresh spinach. I guess I was craving spinach artichoke dip.  After I mixed everything up, I noticed some ritz crackers near me and dipped them in the mix, boy was it delicious. The hubby and daughter started eating it with the crackers too, and I had to stop them to remind them this was for the chicken. I baked the chicken for about 35 mins and broiled it for 2 mins. Chicken tasted somewhat sour, think I'll try marinated artichokes next time. I would rate this a 3.5 but since I altered it, I'll give it a 5. Was a little heavy and I preferred it as a dip.

This was fantastic!  Super easy to make, barely any prep time or dirty dishes.  It tasted great, very yummy.  I had to bake for almost twice as long, but the chicken breast I used was pretty large, which is probably why.  It also tasted great the next day for lunch after warming up in the microwave.

This was a pretty easy dish to make. I was searching for something that I could make with the ingredients I already had and came across this.  I made it exactly as the recipe written here but next time may tweak it a little.

it's pretty good, however despite the fabulous smell whist it cooked, it isn't that flavorful of a dish.
I always look at the reviews thus I did the 1/2 mayo 1/2 sour cream bit, added onion and garlic in the mixture. lastly I added paprika and cayenne (just a smidge!) on the top.
it is definitely a tasty meal! but needs another hit of spices -- I'm just not sure what ones!

Oh my goodness was this good! I added one clove crushed garlic, 1 tsp dried basil and a few tablespoons of sundried tomatoes. I also subbed lowfat yogurt for about a third of the mayo. I prepared this in advance and left it sit in the fridge for about 90 minutes while I ran an errand. I ended up having to bake this a lot longer than the 30 minutes specified in the recipe. I baked it for 30 minutes with a foil lid and another 20 minutes without the foil.

I will try it again since I love all the ingredients.  I would go with either less mayo or substitute with sour cream or mix the two. I love mayo but it was too much.

I  make it in an 8x8 dish with half the chicken amount,  but everything else followed exactly.  I  love sauce.   When I need a chicken fix, this is my  go-to  recipe

I have made this twice.  The first time made by the original recipe and even though I liked it my husband did not stating it was very bland and greasy.   A couple weeks later I decided to make it again using reviewers reccomendation of marinated artichokes and half sour cream with the mayonnaise.   It was far superior with the slight changes.  My husband raved about and did not realize it was even the same dish I had previously made.  I am always looking for new recipes to serve guests and family and I  plan to serve this at my next dinner party.

The topping was good, but no flavor really reached into the chicken.  Next time I will marinate the chicken beforehand.

Do a few tweaks, and this will be really good.

Use 1/2 sour cream & 1/2 Miracle Whip instead of mayo. Marinated artichokes, drained, squeezed free of liquid and chopped  fine adds incredible flavour. Slice chicken into strips. Use 1.5 tsp. minced garlic plus salt & pepper to taste vs garlic pepper. Sprinkle top with cayenne or paprika before baking. VARIATION: Incorporate 10-15 oz. thawed spinach and 1 c sautéed portobellos into the dish. And 4-6 slices of crumbled bacon added to the artichoke mix is a Wowie! OR THIS from another reviewer:  FANTASTIC! Caramelize 1/2 onion in 3 tbsps of olive oil & a 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes. Remove  the onion and sauté a 1/2 pound of sliced/halved mushrooms with 3 cloves of minced garlic.. Butter a shallow glass baking dish. Layer the bottom of the dish with a bag of pre washed baby spinach. Place breasts on top of the layer of spinach and top each breast with caramelized onions and mushrooms. Drain two 12 oz. jars of marinated artichokes reserving a 1/4 cup of the marinade. Drizzle the reserved marinade over the spinach, breasts, caramelized onions and mushrooms. Cover each breast with the recipe mixture of mayo, parmesan cheese, marinated artichokes and garlic pepper. Lastly, VERY LIGHTLY sprinkle cayenne pepper over the dish. Bake at 375 for 50 minutes or until the topping is golden. OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!

Don't tell my husband, but I lightened it a bit by using half regular mayonnaise and half lite mayonnaise.   We both loved it.  The chicken was very moist and tender; could cut it with a fork.

This was absolutely delicious, and very quick and easy. I added some sun-dried tomatoes to mine, and a touch of mozzarella cheese. Everyone loved it! It felt like we'd gone out to a fancy restaurant. Will definitely be adding this to my rotation!

This was excellent.  It was flavorful and the perfect topping to dress up chicken.  I did modify per other reviews by using marinated artichokes and draining them well along with the combo of half mayo and half sour cream.  I added salt, pepper, dried minced garlic and red pepper flakes.  One other suggestion is to use chicken tenders or halve the chicken breasts because the chicken took a bit longer to cook and I was worried the artichoke topping would dry out.  Overall I will definitely be making this again.

My husband loved this recipe and ate almost all of it. 

I thought it was okay but a little overwhelmng. I used half mayo/half sour cream after reading all the reviews and I thought the mayo flavor was still VERY strong and a bit overwhelming.

Made this as written,  but with marinated artichokes.  After the 30 minute cooking time the chicken was nowhere near cooked.  I  cooked it for an hour in total to ensure the chicken was fully cooked.  Although I love artichoke dip,  I was not a big fan of the finished dish  - do not plan to make it again.

All I can say is.... AMAZING!!!  It is hard to believe that such rich and decadent flavor, and moist chicken, can be achieved with so little effort.  It is such an easy and quick meal and the creamy cheesy sauce is to die for!  I followed the recipe exactly, and wouldn't change a thing!  Thanks for sharing. :)

This dish is superb! Instead of mayonnaise, cream cheese, our sour cream, I used plain yogurt. It tasted fantastic. I also added fresh spinach. I'm going to try it with hummus instead of yogurt soon!

DE-LISH!! I went with the suggestions of others and cute the mayo in half and used sour cream in its place. I also lightly seasoned my chicken before adding the mixture. 

Two thumbs WAY UP!!!

After cooking for 30 min at 375 F, I still had raw chicken.  We cooked for 50 min to get it fully cooked.  Otherwise, great recipe.  Subbed 1/2 the mayo for sour cream as others recommended.

This recipe was good but I made a few changes that made it wonderful and mouth watering! My husband was so in love with this dish and even my 5 year old was loving it!! As I read in previous reviews, I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 miracle whip. Also I used fresh mushrooms and topped it all off with Italian style bread crumbs. Next time I make this dish I will serve it over egg noodles I think. It should be quite yummy! My hubby has requested this as a regular meal and I couldn't be happier since it was so easy and quick with such an awesome flavor.

This was absolutely delicious.  Only change is: I placed the chicken & sauce right on top of salt & peppered fresh green beans, mini carrots & a few sliced shallots. Baked @ 425 x25minutes. Delicious dinner all in one pan.

I think this recipe needs a few tweaks, but it's a tasty and easy starting point. After reading a few reviews, I did replace half the mayo with sour cream, and I think it would have been too greasy if I hadn't. Mine came out kind of runny and soupy though, and after reading more reviews, I think next time I'll not only drain the artichokes, but pat them dry as much as possible too. I may also add more parmesan next time, as we REALLY like our parmesan cheese. The flavor of this was great, so I really want to try it again and make it perfect!

I absolutely love this recipe! Even my husband enjoys this and he is not a fan of chicken breast! I do as others have suggested and carefully squeeze out excess liquid from artichokes. I also use only 1/2 cup mayo and 1/4 cup sour cream and put all ingredients in my food processor for a smooth blending.  Wonderful, wonderful flavoring and always tender and moist.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!!

This is a definite repeat recipe. I used some seasoned salt on the breasts before putting on the topping. Make sure you squeeze as much water as you can out of the artichokes. I used a large clove of minced garlic and black pepper in place of the "garlic pepper." I used a big spoonful of sour cream and the rest mayo. I also added a small can of mushrooms. We all had seconds. I was able to cover 6 breast halves with the topping instead of just 4 and cooked for 45 minutes. The chicken was so moist and juicy.

Love, love, love!  I subbed 1/2 sour cream and added the bread crumbs for topping which added texture.  Also, I've found that chicken cutlets are more moist for baking than the whole breast.

This is one delicious chicken dish and so easy, too!  I make it at least once a week.  I like adding 2 cloves of chopped garlic to the artichoke mixture, and instead of regular mayonnaise I use Best Foods mayonnaise with olive oil.

Easy and delicious,  I think the left overs will be even better as they sit with the flavors longer. I cooked a large family pack of chicken.

This chicken was amazing! I did make a few changes. I substituted half of the mayo for fat free sour cream and added a couple strip of bacon on top of each breast. My 4 year old son and husband loved it!

i added red chili pepper flakes, thyme, 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup mayo and made this for 6 chicken breasts. I did squeeze out the artichokes, but there was a small amount of water in the bottom. I do agree this might be better with marinated artichokes, but I didn't have those on hand. 4 cloves shredded garlic and some salt and pepper instead of garlic salt. YUM. Served with sauteed kale.

Very easy, tasty and a big hit with guests.  Next time I will cut the mayo and Parmesan by 1/3, however.  I think it will have the same big taste with a little less calories.

Did not have 3/4 C of mayo and that was okay it was still plenty creamy.  I used way more than a pinch of garlic pepper and fresh grated parmesan cheese; the flavor was fantastic!

Absolutely delicious out of the oven, and even better the next day.  As suggested by others,I halved the mayo with sour cream to lighten it up a bit.  This is a Keeper!

I was excited to try this recipe after all the positive reviews. However, I didn't like it and felt it tasted more like an appetizer than the main meal. I did use marinated artichokes rather than the plain and did slice the chicken into strips as many readers stated it took awhile for the chicken to cook. My husband enjoyed it but I will not be making this again.

One great recipe!!  I've made it several times and have loved it.  The only thing I did different was to substitute 1/2 of the mayo with sour cream.  I found that I had to cook it a bit longer than the 30 minutes, but that might have to do with the size and thickness of the breasts.  Recipe is easy, little hands-on and hard to miss - highly recommend!

This is a delicious and easy way to prepare chicken.  We enjoyed it very much.  I did sort of mash the artichokes instead of chopping them.  The chicken was very moist and I am sure I will make this again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Amanda Bibb.

My family loved it! I used 3 cans of artichoke hearts (drained, pressed to take out the extra juice, then chopped), 15 oz. shredded parmesan, 1/2 c cream cheese, 1/2 c sour cream, 1 t garlic pepper, and 2 pressed garlic cloves. I used convection baking for 35 minutes and it turned out perfectly! The house smelled lovely. Because of the reviews raves about leftovers, I made extra and everyone said they wanted it for lunch the next day. Thank you for the recipe!

I have made this recipe twice and I love it, but both times I had to cook it A LOT longer than 30 minutes. I even cut the chicken breasts in half and it still doesn't cook that fast. I wonder if I'm doing something wrong or if this is a common observation. I will try it next time with half sour cream as many of the other reviewers suggest, but I like it just as (but fully cooked!).

Added a good helping of crushed garlic, chopped mushrooms, did 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream, and added bread crumbs to the top. Went well with egg noodles although penne would be better. Reminded me of beef stroganoff - only with chicken. Delightful!

Delicious! I made this exactly as the recipe indicated and it was delicious and filling, and the chicken stays nice and tender and juicy. I paired it with another recipe on the site for "Low-Carb Mashed Cauliflower" and roasted asparagus. Great meal! Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I am not a big recipe reviewer because I usually modify a recipe after using something as a base to build off of.  However with this recipe I had never cooked with artichokes and wanted to reduce the possibility of something coming out screwed up, so I made the recipe basically as it states.  OH GOOD LAWD!  My wife and I love it, my only change would be to use sour cream (I didn't this time) and I cut the mayo out bit with some horseradish and Dijon mustard.  Also I used marinated artichokes. 

Will definitely make again!

I used 1/2 sour cream and half light mayo.  Visually, it looks a little blah so I broiled the top at the last minute to brown the cheese.  I wish I had remembered one reviewer's suggestion to add caramelized onions on top...that would have been a nice touch.

I made this recipe for a big family dinner. I asked my family's honest opinion, and the general consensus was that it's fattening, heavy, and not in keeping with the new way of cooking - lighter, cleaner, more healthy ingredients with flavour provided by herbs instead of heavy sauces.  I won't make it agai.

If a recipe wows my 14-year old son and is easy and quick to make- It's a winner in my home. I use Veganaise instead of "real" mayo, perhaps that is why it isn't as oily as some of the other reviewers have experienced. As Is for us!

This is one of my new favorites. My husband and I just started the Paleo diet and although the Parmesan cheese isn't allowed it is worth the cheat. I made my own Paleo mayo (found on Youtube). I made this once before following the recipe to a "T" I thought next time, instead of using whole chicken, I cut it up into bit size pieces. It was fabulous! I mixed everything in a casserole dish, cooked it for about 20 minutes and broiled for about 5 minutes. Served it on a bed of fresh spinach greens and raw zucchini "fry's" on the side. YUM-O!!

Served this for a Valentine's day dinner along with balsamic roaster cauliflower, and a spring lettuce, pear, avocado salad - was very good.  Made just one adjustment.  Along with the 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream suggestions, I added two pressed garlic cloves to the mixed artichoke hearts, Parmesan cheese and mayo/sour cream mixture.  Will make this again.

Simple, quick and delicious.  I tried this on some leftover chicken that also had tomatoes in it--the tomatoes blended very nicely with this recipe.  Served it over rice.

Other reviews made a good suggestion sour cream in place of mayonnaise, or a blend.  I went with the former because I rarely have mayonnaise on hand.  Still turned out great.

Have made this many times in the past and now have tweaked it a bit.
I sub Greek Yogurt for the mayo. Have used both marinated artichokes or artichokes in water. I always cook it on a bed of spinach (as others suggested) which makes the chicken a bit more moist and provides additional vegetables. Super easy to make, and always a hit.

Wow!! So tasty! I followed the recommendations of others, did half sour cream, half mayo and used the marinated artichokes. This is going to become a staple in my home and have even passed it on to other. Great recipe!!!

I followed Jim F's advice and sauteed onion and mushrooms in butter, a pinch of red pepper flake, and garlic, spinach on bottom followed by seared chicken breast, topped with onion/mushroom mix, marinated artichoke (which I chopped fine), then sprinkled with cooked and chopped bacon and then I topped with mayo/parm mix and some italian breadcrumbs.  The meat-eaters loved it (can't speak for myself as I am vegetarian) but my guests have very good taste.
Thank you for the recipe :)  This one is a keeper!

This was very tasty! I had 5 breasts, so I used a cup each of parm and mayo, about 1 tsp each fresh minced garlic and cracked pepper, and a little squirt of lemon juice. I was actually going to use half sour cream, but I forgot to do so. Will try it that way next time and update my review to note any differences. By the way, my chicken breasts were quite large, so the cook time for me was about 40-45 mins. Thanks for the recipe!

This has become my go-to dish for luncheons for friends. I split the chicken breasts lengthwise, to make smaller servings possible, though everyone can have whatever they want (I double the sauce, for 8 servings). I use half real mayo and half reduced fat sour cream. (I don't like "lite" mayo.) My husband also likes it, though I don't make it as often for the two of us, as it is rich. I'm serving it to a circle of friends this week, three of whom I had served it to last year, and requested it again!

I was really looking forward to making this. The first few bites were slightly better than ok, but then it became too overwhelming and I couldn't finish it. The thought of eating that much warm mayo made my stomach turn. My family didn't enjoy it at all, so we won't be making this again.

Made this tonight for dinner. Delicious! Very easy to prepare and had almost everything on hand. I didn't have garlic pepper, but did add a few chopped cloves of garlic. Would definitely make again!

This is a favorite in our house.  I, like others, only use half of the mayo.  For the other half, I use plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  VERY similar in flavor, but no fat! I also add a box of frozen chopped spinach (thawed), a second can of artichokes with a little of the juice, and some mozzarella cheese (I figure since the yogurt has no fat I can afford the extra cheese) to the mixture.  I also brown the chicken, seasoned with salt and pepper, first; it gives it more flavor and it just looks more appetizing. In addition to the cheese in the mixture, I top the whole dish with a little extra parm and mozz before baking. With these minor tweaks to the original recipie, it becomes a 5+ star dish :)

This has cooked perfectly every time we have made it.  My kids hate artichokes and they eat this up every time it is cooked.  Something in this recipe tenderizes the chicken because it is always really tender and juicy.  Those of you who do not like artichokes need to give this a try it totally changes their flavor and it will quickly become one of your favorites.

Yum! Just made this for dinner. I was going to replace 1/2 the mayo with sour cream like others had recommended, but my sour cream had gone sour so I just used the mayo, 1 tablespoon fresh minced garlic, parmesan cheese, & well chopped drained- dried marinated artichoke hearts. I browned the chicken breasts on both sides in a pan with a tbs of butter and salted and peppered to taste (my husband likes a little kick). This came out awesome. My husband said this is his favorite chicken recipe ever other than Cajun chicken, Highly recommend.

Oh my goodness this is amazing!  I did use half mayo, half sour cream but otherwise followed to a T!  I left in the oven for 35 minutes and it browned nicely on top.  We'll be keeping this recipe and using again!  Thanks for sharing.

It was ok. I used marinated artichoke hearts instead of canned and I think that made it better. I only eyeballed the amounts of everything--2 "thwacks" of mayo and 1 of sour cream, a tbsp of minced garlic (I love garlic), and a few dashes of pepper. I added one dash of cayenne but you couldn't taste it so I think I'll add more for next time.

I also think this would be better if you made the chicken separately and made the rest into a sauce. Next time I'll cook the chicken in a skillet and I'll mix up the mayo mixture in a pot, and maybe add some milk or something to make it more saucy to go with pasta. 
Overall I was happy with the flavor.

Super easy and very tasty. Everyone loves it and it's a great dish to bring to someone who needs a meal! I tend to use less mayo (maybe 1/2 a cup) to keep the extra liquid down, and maybe a bit extra parmesan. I have substituted Greek yogurt for some or all of the mayo to keep calories down. Also, if the chicken is thick, I pound it to a uniform thickness so it cooks evenly and doesn't get dried out.

This chicken was so delicious and so easy! I liked it best using half lite sour cream and half lite mayo. The shredded parmesan cheese makes it very tasty and I LOVE artichokes! It's an easy meal for just my husband and I, but will also be a wonderful company dish. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Awesome!  I made the recipe exactly, but there was a lot of water left in the casserole dish.  Some other reviewers said to squeeze the artichokes first, but i just took the chicken out of the dish as soon as it was finished baking and it was wonderful.  Will definatley make again!!!

This was wonderful and going in my regular rotation of nightly family meals! I took the advice of others and used more sour cream than mayo to make it a tad healthier. My son and I added sun dried tomato after we tasted it and will add that next time in cooking. Great easy way to dress up boring chicken!!

My boyfriend and I loved this! I did make my own changes though. 
I cooked up some rice and added that under the chicken breasts. 
I mixed a small amount of lemon juice into the rice
I butterflied two breasts to make four smaller ones. 
I used just a few marinated artichoke hearts (I have a huge jar from Costco). 
I added minced fresh garlic and fresh italian seasoning.
I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream with just a bit more of the lemon juice.
Browned the top at the end and WALA! Heaven!

I made this last week, following the recipe as close as I could. (I didn't have chicken breast halves, only tenderloins). It was outstanding. My wife, who doesn't eat a lot of meat, told me she thought that this was the best meal I have ever made. Served it with wilted garlic spinach ..

I now want to try this with fish... looks like that will be what I do today..

Thanks for the recipe.

Loved it ....mjust the way it is! Didnt change a thing and it was a big hit. I cut the pieces of chicken breast into tender sized portions just to cook faster and would be eaiser to serve over the egg noodles. Loved it

This dish was very flavorful like the review before me had said. One thing that I found was that you have to really eat the chicken and artichoke mix together. It surprised me how great they went together. There were a few adds and changes i did with this recipe.  I added paprika and breadcrumbs, did half and half of sour cream and mayonnaise. 2 pinches of garlic pepper. I also squeezed the artichokes after draining. but there was still water in the dish.. which in all honesty it didn't matter. I would totally recommend this to anyone. thanks for the tips by the reviews before me:)

Read many reviews before making and thought since I benefitted from others' tips and hints re: this dish, I would ace the recipe.  Wrong-BLAND!  I used half mayo/half sour cream, Parmesan cheese and chopped Marinated Artichokes, drained well.  I added 1 clove finely minced garlic, and 1/2 small can of diced green chiles. It was okay, but BLAND AS HECK! we had one breast left over and today I added some Basil Pesto to the mayo topping and reheated.  Excellent!  I will try again using Pesto, that made it delish.

4 star for potential.  Only thing I did different was I used a little garlic powder instead of the garlic pepper.  Still needs a little something, maybe season the chicken with a little salt first?  And the topping was a little bit too creamy for me, if I make this next time, might try to lower the mayo down to 1/2 cup.

This was so easy and tasty! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it was a little too heavy. I did substitute 1/2 of the 3/4 of mayo with sour cream, but it was still heavy. Overall it was super yummy and I'll be making it again.

I love artichoke dip and really enjoyed this dish.  My husband and boys thought it was ok.  Probably due to them not liking artichokes.  I will still make it again though.

This was Delicious!  A few adjustments I made:  I used 1/2 the amount of marinated artichoke hearts, I Roasted some fresh garlic & used about 4-5 cloves of roasted garlic, pinch of lemon pepper, paprika,  that I mixed in with the Mayo, parmesan cheese mix.  I then sprinkled just a touch of seasoned bread crumbs on top of the chicken & mixture.  
I served it over garlic mashed potatoes, and sweet corn.  I will definitely make this again.   
Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked the idea of this dish. I did tweak it a little bit. I used 1/2 c mayo and 1/2 c sour cream, i also added some minced garlic and cayenne to the mixture. I don't know if I didn't mix it up well enough or what but I thought the parm cheese was overwhelming, it was all I could taste. I think next time I make this I will sub shredded pepper jack for the parm and then sprinkle parm on top before I put it in the oven. But overall a great recipe!

Truth in advertising! The best chicken ever! Yummy, yummy, yummy. Used reduced fat mayo and sour cream. Squeezed out the liquid in the artichokes as recommended by others. Sooooooooo easy. Everyone loved it. Will be a staple!!!

The first time I made this it turned out perfect!!  I've made it a couple of times since then and it's still good but not as good - it's kinda watery.  Don't know what I'm doing different (maybe miracle whip vs. mayo??).  Either way, it's super easy and really delicious!!

The recipe, as originally posted, is not a good guide, as I learned after I had to dump the results of my first attempt. For one thing, 30 minutes in the oven is just not long enough. The second time, I followed suggestions from others and it was great: pounded the chicken thinner; used marinated artichoke hearts (drained); and used 1/3 cup each of light sour cream and light mayo.

Omg!!! Amazing! I added a bit of cajun spices and used 1 cup of mayo, + 1 cup parmesan + 2 14oz cans of artichokes chopped well. I also coated the bottom of pan with the mix and then coated the chicken. Served with rice for a deliciously simple meal. This recipe will be added to the short list for weekly meals. Next time I'll try half sour cream/mayo. Sure that it will still be awesome. Yum Yum Yum!

This is part of the best meal I have ever made. I cooked this exactly as stated along with parmesan basil orzo (with added olives) from this site for a little mediterranean theme and they go great together. I'm sure this chicken would go great with a lot of different things though! My new favorite chicken dish. Even better... the boyfriend cleaned his plate!

I found it to be very heavy with as much mayo as called for, altho still very tasty

for our second time, we seared the chicken first and used the pan searings for gravy, less mayo and added breadcrumbs over the top. servered with biscuts and veggie medly.

This is great.  I use half mayo and half sour cream, make a little extra sauce, cut the chicken into bite size pieces and brown in olive oil.  I then add fettucini cooked al dente, cover and bake.  Very good.

I made this last night for dinner - this was awesome I seasoned the chicken breast with salt/pepper slathered the top of the chicken with the artichoke/mayo mixture sprinkled with bread crumbs turned the breasts over and repeated on the other side - I baked mine for 40 min since the chicken breast were large - the flavors where great and the chicken was so moist - served over wild rice - thanks this is so so easy and a keeper in my house.

This was super easy and tasty!  I followed the advice of others and used 1/3 cup sour cream and 1/3 cup mayo.  I think if I would have used all mayo it might have had too tangy of a taste.  This recipe makes a lot of topping.  I didn't have garlic pepper so I just added some minced garlic and it tasted just fine!

Great recipe, I used a mix of the recommendations. I used fat free sour cream and fat free mayo. I also cut out the Parmesan cheese. Added garlic powder and pepper along with Italian bread crumbs on top. This lower fat/calorie option was still great and will be making it again.

Super easy to make. I used minced garlic instead of powder and cooked it on the stovetop (which took about 15 minutes total), added a bit of sour cream and lemon juice. It turned out surprisingly delicious albeit the aesthetics; it basically looked like mush. I can see myself making this later on in life. Next time I will bake it.

Very good!  The topping had so much flavor.  I would make this again.  I kept everything the same, except I substituted the regular mayonnaise for light mayo and reduced it from 3/4 c to 1/2 c.  I still had plenty of topping to cover the chicken and had some left over!

This was soo good! I took everyones advice and did half sour cream and mayo, I also added a 1/4 cup of canned jalapenos to give it a little kick. The result was moist and flavorful, I will definitely make this again!

This is the first time I've made this. It was really delicious, but there was a lot of oil flowing.  I simply drained the oil, and all was good!  A definite keeper!

The flavor was outstanding, especially served with rice... however my chicken was not done in 30 minutes, maybe more like 45 mins needed.   Also I substituted half sour cream for half of the mayo.

This was good, but it didn’t wow me like I was hoping it would.  I used marinated artichokes squeezed of excess moisture in a paper towel, fresh pressed garlic and freshly ground pepper.  I made half the recipe cutting back on the parmesan to 1/4 cup and used 2 T. each of mayonnaise and sour cream.  I still had plenty of the artichoke mixture to spread on the chicken breasts covering them totally.  Sprinkled it with lightly buttered panko, hoping to help it crisp up, and that probably helped, but it still wasn’t as crispy as I would have liked.

Hubby said this is his fravorite new recipe.  I did make some changes...used fresh cracked pepper, one garlic clove, marinated the chicken in the artichoke juice, added mushrooms and breadcrumbs.  I only had garlic and herb mayo so i used that.  Used that, sour cream, and alfredo sauce, was not oily or greasy at all.  Also added frech chives from the garden.  Results were awesome!

Good as is, better with these changes:  ahead of time, fry 5 slices of thick sliced bacon, let cool and then crumble and add to the mixture.  Increase mayonnaise (or mayo/sour cream combo) to 1¼ cups.  Boil four potatoes for about 10 minutes, let cool and cut into cubes and place around the chicken before covering all with the mixture.

This recipe was sooo rich and heavy. I dont think I'll be making it again, but my boyfriend enjoyed it. I followed others and used 1/2 cup mayo and 1 cup sour cream...also added fresh mushrooms and breadcrumbs.

I'm giving this recipe four stars on taste because the chicken was really good (although I had to cook it for a while longer than the recipe called for). However, the chicken was a little too greasy for my liking but it was really easy and fast to make on a lazy Sunday evening though. :)

This was SO good! I did the half sour cream and half mayo- both lite, plus added some spinach to it! It did make it a bit thicker, so I'll probably cut the chicken into chunks next time and serve over pasta... this dish was amaaazing!

I love artichokes, so almost anything that has them I love.  This was good,  it was just not quite "IT".  maybe the sour cream as suggested.  It will be good as leftovers, chopped up and tossed with pasta

I make this frequently.  It's super easy and very yummy.  My husband hates mayonnaise, but never realizes this has mayo in it.  When you put the whole can of hearts in the dish, it looks like you're drowning the chicken, but when it cooks down, it's just the right amount. If you like artichoke hearts, you'll love this!!!

It was good, different, and really easy. I think I will  try what many other reviewers suggested the next time I make it, to sub half the mayo for sour cream. I also used marinated artichokes.

Good stuff. I did half sour cream, half light mayo. In the oven it smelled like my famous artichoke dip cooking, which we ONLY WISH we could just eat as a meal, so we loved this.

I made exactly as is with the exception of adding about 2T of milk so that it would spread easier. I used the juices to flavor some eggnoodles and served with asparagus. Next time, I think I'll try marinated artichoke hearts and maybe less mayo to cut down on the fat.

I pressed some garlic into the casserole, used a little bit of minced onion in the mayo/cheese mix, & sprinkled seasoned bread crumbs on top.  This is an EXCELLENT weeknight dish.   Easy, quick, tasty.  It will become one of my regulars!

Great flavor, moist and tender chicken.  So easy to prepare.  Goes well with rice, but the plate needs some color then.  A spinach salad and a bright colored garnish would help the presentation.

Totally yummy!!  I think all of the mayo makes it not as healthy as I'd like, but it was a yummy change for the family.  My daughter's very picky and she LOVED it.  She's not a mayo person either, I didn't tell her it was a huge part.    Definitely a recipe to keep and make later!!

This is SO DELICIOUS.  As written, I thought the chicken wasn't very tender--even though it tasted simply divine.  I'm wondering if a few hours on low in a crockpot would make it more tender, and therefore perfect!!! Also, per suggestions I did half mayo, half sour cream.  My favorite canned artichokes are "365" brand from Whole Foods--superior quality, and makes this meal sooooo good!

Quick and easy recipe. My three year old helped me make it. After my husband and I took a bite of it, we both agreed it was a bit bland. I added a little salt, lemon pepper and paprika, and then it was wonderful.

I thought this was wonderful.  I only thing different I would do is make sure that the chicken is very dry before placing in the pan and cooking.  My picky eater loved it.  thank you for the great recipe!

This was good. I like how it was fast and different.  Next time I am going to try hald mayo and half sour cream like the others suggested.  It was a little greasy with all mayo. It kind of tasted like the artichoke dip that is on allrecipes too. Yum!

Would HIGHLY recommend marinated artichokes. Drain whole, chop, then squeeze by handfuls. I'd also adding recommend 1/2 t salt to the topping, as well as salt and pepper to the chicken breasts.

YUM! I've made this several times now! So tasty and so easy and quick to prepare! Very savory and comes out deliciously crispy on top, though that could be because my oven is a bit hotter than it says. The only problem I have with it is the sauce can come out quite watery. I'm going to attempt to remedy this next time with the tips from the other reviewers, by squeezing out the artichokes well (which I thought I had done but I will try again) and adding a bit of sour cream to the sauce. Great with asparagus and a salad, yummy!

I added a package of frozen spinach to the mixture as well as following the advice to use 1/2 mayo 1/2 sour cream, and I used way more than a pinch of the garlic peper but I like heavy flavor. mmm mmm goood. I also sprinkled more shredded parm on top to give it a cripsy brown crust on top. It was great. my friends loved it! thanks!

This was great. Full of flavor (definately go for the marinated hearts) and a nice creamy sauce.

I too loved this dish and did mince the artichoke hearts as I am not a fan of chunks of artichoke, plus I split the may with sour cream and added spinach to make it more of a "chicken spinach & artichoke dip" style. The chicken is so juicy when baked with the mayo and sour cream it is just to die for! Another idea is to slice the chicken into strips rather than leave it as halves to make it even more juicy when baked. MMmmm Mmmm good!

This is one of my go-to recipes. I usually add in some chopped red bell pepper for color, but other than that I pretty much leave everything else the same. We like to serve this with cooked spinach as a side, sort of like artichoke-spinach dip.

I gave this 5 stars, 4 for taste and an extra one for ease of preparation.  I needed a quick dinner for a busy night and had all these ingredients on hand.  Didn't think my husband would like it but he and all the boys loved it.  I did the half sour cream, half mayo thing like others, I also flattened my chicken and cooked it for an hour, 30 minutes didn't seem long enough.  Yay, a new, quick dinner for busy days.

Delicious! I have made this twice, the 1st time w/ half sour cream.  We liked it a lot better when made as written (all mayo).  The chicken was moist and tender.  All I did different was add sauteed mushrooms.  Yummy!

Delicious!  I got an appetizer recipe from this site with the same filling rolled in crescent dough and these were just as fantastic.  My husband who is NOT a fan of artichokes even went back for more, and the picky 8 year old ALMOST admitted that he liked it.   Thank you for sharing!

My 10 year old grand daughter has been "bugging" me to make this recipe.  I've made it several times and my family loves it!  I will cut back on the mayo and add the sour cream this time for less grease. Great way to get even kids to eat artichoke!  Fabulicious!

A new favorite.  Following reviewers, I omitted most of the mayo and subsituted fat free sour cream instead, and used garlic salt instead of garlic pepper.  I flattened the chicken breasts and pan fried on the stove first, then put them in the oven with the topping.  I put them under the broiler for the last few minutes and they came out crisp and brown on top.  Great for when you are bored eating the same chicken recipes over and over!

I really thought this was going to be a GREAT recipe  based on all the reviews.  I followed the directions precisely as written and was very anxious to cut into this new dish.  My husband went first and just gave me one of those looks that instantly told me it was not very good.  When he got up and reached for the bbq sauce, I knew something was very wrong.  I tasted it, and while it was very tender and moist, it was pretty bland. We both thought it was a bit salty, but the only thing I could figure that contained salt was the cheese.  I thoroughly drained the artichoke hearts and I've used them numerous times, so I know that wasn't it.  Needless to say, we were very disappointed in this one.

I loved the simplicity of this recipe! However, did not like the oily-ness that many others commented on  on.  Will take the suggestions to use half sour cream as a substitute by other raters.

This was really great.  I was hesitant at first because I don't usually cook with mayo.  I used half mayo and half sour cream like others suggested.  I also add lots of black pepper, paprika and granulated garlic to the mix.  I seasoned the chicken before  topping with the artichoke mixture.  I served this over mashed potatoes.  The hubby loved it!  Will definitely make again.

Not bad.  I used marinated artichoke hearts and used half sour cream/half light mayo.  I also breaded the chicken breasts and pan-fried them before topping with artichoke and putting in the oven.  Nice for a change.

This is such a great recipe.  I use large bone-in chicken breasts and bake in single serving clay dishes.  If you have had bad luck with large chicken breasts being dry- try this recipe, you won't be sorry!

This was a great recipe. My husband said it's the best thing I've ever made. I did change a few things...I used half mayo, half sour cream and also added chopped mushrooms. Also, I had about half a cup of leftover five cheese blend which I used in addition to the parmesean. I will definitely make again but will try with just mayo to see which we like better.

Mine turned out pretty good, baked it at 375 for about 40 mins.  I did the half sour cream/half mayo to make it less greasy and I also used the marinated artichokes.  It gave the chicken a tangy flavor, which was only ok.  I might use the non marinated artichoke hearts (with garlic salt added) next time for a more savory taste over a tangy one. I will make this recipe again.

Very easy and delicious dinner. I had my boys fighting over the 2 extra breasts of chicken :-). I followed the advice of 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream and it turned out well. I also tried to get as much water out of the artichoke before and after chopping it up and had almost no extra water when baking. I baked for more than the 30 minutes listed - cooked for more like 45 minutes at 375. I highly recommend this recipe!

My family loved this recipe!  I made the topping the night before, and kept it in the refrigerator until it was time to bake the chicken, cutting the prep time to about 1 minute.

WOW!  Tried this after having something similar at a catered wedding reception that I thought was good. This was WAY better!!!  I followed the recipe exactly using plain artichoke hearts, and I did add 2 cloves of garlic to it.  I have to say that my family are vocal of likes and dislikes, and this one went over with them ALL as a hit!  Very simple to make and very impressive to serve to guests!  Great recipe!

This recipe is awful.  If you like a greasy dish this is it! Not to mention the flavor is bland and boring.  If you must make it, add mushrooms and some more spices.  Perhpas adding breadcrumbs to the top would soak up some of the grease that the mayo and parmesan cheese creates in this dish.  Big thumbs down.

Loved this recipe!  My chicken breast were pretty thick, so I had to bake it for atleast 10 minutes longer.  I buy the large jar of artichokes from COSTCO, so I used a ton!  I also grated the parmesan myself and added some to the top after baking.  It was delicious... and not greasy at all like some reviewers had stated.

These were super easy- yet lots of flavor so it seemed more complicated!  Loved it!  A great way to dress up a chicken breast, and using low fat mayo makes it very low fat!!

Did not give 5 stars only because I swapped half the mayo for sour cream, and added chopped garlic. Great flavor! Excellent dish! Will make it again.

This isn't terrible, but the cheese and mayo are somewhat overwhelming.  The baking instructions resulted in exquisitely tender chicken.

This goes into the rotation for sure!  Easy, no hassle meal that is husband approved.  I followed previous reviews and did 1/2 lite mayo, 1/2 non-fat sour cream and also added a little extra garlic powder to the mix.

It wasn't bad, but no one went back for seconds, and the leftovers just sat in the fridge until I finally cut the chicken up and put the whole mixture into a greek style wrap with olives, spinach, feta and sun-dried tomatoes. If I hadn't done that, I don't think the leftovers would have been eaten at all. I will not make this recipe again.

I really didn't like this recipe.  I love artichokes and was really looking forward to this.  I didn't think the mayo made a good dressing.  Next time I would probably marinate the chicken and just add the artichokes in some sort of lemon butter on top of the chicken.  The flavor was just not good.

I didn't eat this personally (i'm a vegetarian) ...but i can tell you it smelled AMAZING and my 4 year old son and husband went nuts for it! I used Romano cheese rather than parmesan because thats what I keep in the house.

I loved this!  I served it with cheese tortellini, there is plenty of sauce on the chicken to mix with the pasta.  I did take the suggestion to used half sour cream and browned the chicken first.  It was so fast and easy, I will be making this regularly from now on.

My family loved this recipe.  The first time I made it, I used the marinated artichokes and half mayonnaise and half fat free sour cream.  When I made it tonight, I used plain artichoke hearts (canned), 1 tsp of minced garlic and half mayonnaise and half greek yogurt.  I think when I make it again (and I will make it again!) I will use just the greek yogurt (or maybe just a 1/4 cup of mayo and the rest yogurt).  It was awesome!

Delicious! I subbed 1/4cup fat free sour cream and 1/2cup light mayo for the 3/4c mayo.  Then added 1 can of diced chili's and 3 cloves diced garlic in addition to adding a light spice rub to the chicken breasts about 20min before putting it in the oven.  1/4 cup each of fat free sour cream, light mayo, light miracle whip.  Squeezed out artichoke hearts really well, added 5 cloves garlic, added 1t chipotle powder,

My husband loved this (and found that he liked artichokes!).  The chicken does come out extremely moist and tender.  I did use shredded parm as opposed to grated - to me there's a huge difference in taste.  Also, I cooked 10-15 minutes longer than recipe stated - to achieve a beautiful golden brown on the top.  (Certainly didn't dry them out!)  Hubby will likely request this again and again.

WOW!!! My husband is not a big eater nor is he a chicken lover but he does like artichokes and all he kept saying throughout dinner was how good it was. He usually always eats light on Monday nights because he goes to a soup fellowship after dinner but went back for seconds and took leftovers for lunch the next day. Not to mention my kids cleaned their plate which is also very rare. I don't think I have ever had chicken come out so moist,even looked beautiful and delicious when it came out of the oven. I cooked slightly longer due to large pieces of chicken breasts but did follow the recipe exactly and will be making often!

I liked this.  I did as other commenters suggested and used 1/2 (fat free) sour cream and 1/2 (olive oil) mayo instead of all mayo.  I also used half feta cheese and half parmesan and added a can of very-well drained spinach.  It took about 45 minutes for the chicken to cook all the way through, but it was really good.  It tasted like having spinach and artichoke dip baked onto the chicken!

This chicken was great. I was looking for a way to use up my artichokes, and I'm glad I chose this recipe. As most people suggested, I used mayonnaise and sour cream. I also added a few fresh mushrooms to the sauce. I had some extra sauce so I warmed it up the next day and used it as an artichoke dip with pita chips.

My family loves this recipe.  I make it a little bit different than the original recipe.  First, I only use 2 large chicken breasts.  I pound them down until I can cut them into 4 equal pieces.  The I make the artichoke mixture with fresh parm. cheese.  It makes a big difference in the taste compared to store bought parm.  I have done both just depends on what I have in my fridge.  Then I let it bake for 25 minutes.  I take it out, cover the top with 1/4 c. original bread crumbs and 1/4 c. parm.  Then I bake it for another 10 minutes.  It has a wonderful crust on top.  Wonderful :)  My whole family eats this dish.  Even my picky eaters!

Wonderful special occasion chicken dish. Fresh garlic and substituting 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 may for the mayo makes it very tasty. I put all ingredients in my food processor and fold in the fresh grated parmesan by hand at the end. Its a keeper!

This is wonderful!!  My husband who usually says everything is "good" or "OK" said it was "really good" I did add a couple of things as follows.  Didn't have any parn cheese so I used the ricotta cheese on hand, instead of 3/4 c mayo I used 1/2 c mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  Also added 1 t. worchestshire sauce, 1 t. lemon juice, 1 t. minced garlic, 1/2 t crushed red peppers, 1/2 t salt, 1/2 t pepper & a pinch of ginger.  I wanted a little pick but not hot.  It was perfect!  I serverd it with whole wheat penne pasta and sauted asparagus.  YUM!

Carly G said the recipe needed a little something extra, try dicing up some Jalepeno Peppers (to taste) and add to mixture or maybe a dash of Caynne Pepper....just a thought.

This is an excellent recipe prepared as is, but a warning: it's very important to use high quality chicken.  When I make this recipe, I purchase organic chicken.  Because the recipe's focus is on the meat, and not the other flavors, one bad bite can ruin the dish.

Yum. I, too, substituted some plain yogurt for half of the mayonnaise, then served it over thin spaghetti.

I made this using half mayo/half sour cream, and marinated artichoke hearts as others suggested.  It was really good and tasted like a chicken breast smothered in artichoke dip.  Even my boyfriend who claimed to hate artichokes went back for seconds of this.

Great recipe!  I used 1/4 c. light Miracle Whip and 1/2 c. light sour cream in lieu of the mayo.  I also added some frozen chopped spinach (thawed and squeezed) and used marinated artichokes.  My hubby (who doesn't like artichokes!) loved this recipe.  Will definitely make again!

Not great. Used 1/2 sour cream & 1/2 mayonaise & turned out a little to sour. Also used marinated artichokes.  Was a little to much of a flavor explosion in the wrong direction. Needs some fine tuning & downgrading.

Used 1/2 sour cream and added small can of green chilies to the artichoke mixture. Chicken was so moist and flavorful. Excellent recipe. Also great over fish.

I really enjoyed this chicken!  I took the advice and used more sour cream than mayo (I halved the recipe and used 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/8 cup mayo).  I recommend using shredded Parmesan cheese.

This was good, but it was basically baked chicken with artichoke dip on top.  I would have rather had some artichoke dip with bread for an appetizer and some grilled chicken for dinner.

Phenominal...will make as often as possible.  I also added garlic and sliced chicken sausage to the mixture, and breadcrumbs in the end.  It was a huge hit.

This dish was amazing.  I cannot beleive what a little bit of mayo can do.  I seasoned my chicken with garlic salt and onion poweder and let it sit in the olive oil that I greased the pan with.  After spreading the mixture across the top I sprinkled some italian seasoned bread crumbs and paprika, it was delicious.

Fabulous. I gave it four stars only because I made slight chages. Used half mayo/half sour cream, added just a touch of finally chopped roasted red pepper. Brown the chicken slightly in a skillet first, and topped with Italian cheese blend the last few minutes of baking. It was out of this world. My guests raved. Thanks for sharing!

I recommend the half sour cream and half mayo change.  We also added mushrooms and fresh spinach last time we made this dish, and it was out of this world good.  I am going to use both versions to keep it from getting boring, but it was a hit with my family and company as well.  SUPER moist and tasty.

I thought it was great! We used half of 3/4 of ranch instead of mayo and it tasted just like the artichoke dip we make...but with chicken!

We thought this was great! My daughters don't like a heavy mayonaise flavor so I used the sour cream/mayo combination others suggested. I used canned artichoke hearts-no marinade and it was delicious. Definitely can't wait to make this again.

I made this for Sunday dinner and it turned out great.  My husand is an artichoke fan and loved it.  I did follow the recipe fairly close.  I followed others advice and added 1 1/2 tsp. minced garlic to the mayo mix. Also, I sprinkled the chicken with garlic powder and salt and pepper.  I also, did as another suggested and checked the chicken after 20 min. I used artichoke hearts packed in brine and squeezed the juice out really well. Use real shredded parmesan cheese not the kind you shake out of the can.  I used a meat thermometer to make sure it wasn't overdone. (At 145 degrees the juices were clear) That is the key!!! It was like something out of a restaurant!  I did only use a little over half of the mayo mix as it is quite rich and the chicken came out perfect!

I made this for an impromptu dinner party and it was so scrumptious my guests were scrambling to get the last morsels.
Changes I made: Reduced mayo by 1/2 and then added 1 part cream cheese and 1 part sour cream; I added 3 cloves minced garlic and about 1/2 c chopped spinach; I sauted the garlic, spinach, and artichoke hearts prior to baking; I used a 3-cheese blend of fresh parmesan, asiago, and romano cheeses.
Served on a bed of long grain brown rice cooked in chicken broth and with roasted broccoli, cauliflower, and red peppers.

This has become a staple at our house.  Love it!  I usually buy the bags of frozen chicken breasts, they are huge, so I just throw them while still frozen on a jelly roll pan lined with aluminum foil and spread the ingredients over the top.  The hard part is waiting.  Thanks for this recipe!!!

This chicken is GREAT!!  Only changes I made were I halved the mayo and subbed sour cream, I used chicken breast tenders, and in half of the cheese mix, I added fresh spinach. (I chopped the spinach, cooked in microwave for 1 min or til wilted, then I drained and squeezed out excess liquid).  This was so good....reminded me of spinach artichoke dip...my favorite!!  I will definately make this recipe again! Thanks Amanda for submitting!!

I am actually pleasantly surprised. Everyone ate it, everyone liked it - anything that isn't complained about is a five star in my book!! I took other's advise did the half mayo/sour cream route. Sauted my chopped up marinated artichokes, some mushrooms and roasted red peppers, thought this would take away the "watery" problem some talked about, it didn't, but the watery thing didn't matter. I also added chopped up cooked bacon, and lighty sprinkled the top of the chicken with steak seasoning. I also cut the parm down to 2/3 a cup because I was afraid it would taste too salty. It was not appealing at all as I put it on top of the chicken, and even tasting the mixture didn't seem too good. It smelled great cooking, and like I said, it was actually very good. Wont make it very often just because it is a rich meal, but it will be made again!! Thanks!!

Incorporating others' suggestions, I went with marinated arrtichokes, fresh garlig and a sour cream/mayo blend. My twist on this (inspired by my favourite dip) was to use Asiago cheese. This is now one of our favourites - and couldn't be easier!

Easy enough that my kitchen-challenged husband could do it.  Prepared as written but we blotted the grease off the top of the dish after baking.  Served with brown rice and fresh green beans.

This was not well liked by my family. My husband and I just thought is was "so-so" and my 17 year-old hated it. I thought it would be better when looking at the ingredients...just was kind of dissapointing.

This chicken is wonderful!!  I did use merinated artichokes, but may try it with plain artichoke hearts the next time.  Only change I made was to top with bread crumbs before cooking.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious.  Followed other suggestions and used fresh spinach, fresh mushrooms and used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  Did have slightly too much of a mayo flavor even with adjustment so will probably increase the sour cream next time.

We liked this recipe a lot. Not only because it was very easy to cook but because it was a very simple tasting dish. The picky boyfriend went back for seconds and asked me to save the leftovers! (A rarity for him). CHANGES: I used 1/2 cup of fat free sour cream 1/2 cup of Miracle Whip and added a few cloves of minced garlic. I also didn't have garlic pepper so substituted garlic salt. Also, next time I think I'll either cut up the chicken into cubes or pound it thinner.

Ok, I have tried this recipe twice, because of all the good ratings, because I love artichoke dip and I really wanted to like this dish because it looked fast and easy. Once, exactly as written and once, using the suggestions of others (ie: marinated artichokes, half sour cream half mayo, garlic).The way it's written is bland and the suggested way is not that good either. The marinated artichokes give the chicken a sour taste.  Plus, no matter how long you drain the artichokes you end up with the chicken swimming in liquid.  It also did not brown on top and just did not look appealing to the eye.  I would not make this dish again.

Yum, I used 1/2 lowfat sour cream 1/2 light mayo. Also placed sliced muenster cheese on each chicken breast before adding artichoke topping. I chopped up leftovers and served over nachos with a little extra parm cheese.

This was sooo good! My family loved it! Next time though I will use fresh grated Parmesan, I used regular Kraft in the bottle, and it came out a little to salty for my taste. I also used artichoke hearts marinated in olive oil, which indeed added to the flavor. This one was surely a winner, and easy to make!

this was amazing with a few additions: i followed the hints by Jim F.,in his review i added the onions, mushrooms and spinach. i used the marinated artichoke hearts and it was absolutely fantastic! the marinade gave it the right amount of flavor that it needed. I also did 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup of mayo and the whole dish with everything again was really great! thanks again.

We loved this chicken dish! I used the marinated artichokes. 2 jars equals about 1 can of the regular canned artichokes. I drained them very well as suggested. I also used low fat mayo which worked just great. This is a dish that is quick for weeknights, but I wouldn't hesitate to serve it to company. this is a keeper!

I got a lot of "yum" "yum" from my husband.  Did take the suggestions to use half mayo, half sour cream and marinated artichokes.  Added some garlic powder and a little more of the garlic pepper than the recipe called for.  Cooking time was more like 45-50 minutes but the chicken was well done and not dry.  Will make this again.

Tasted great and super easy to make! No problems with liquid and added sliced portabellos. Yum! The only thing I didn't like was the briny flavor of the marinated artichoke hearts. Will try with artichokes canned in water next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I don't know if it was just me, but the cook time was way off and I had to increase the cooking time twice beacuse the chicken was still red. The artichoke substance was runny and most of it was in the pan. It did have a good taste but just didn't turn out right.

I'm certainly an anomaly amongst those who have tried this recipe, but my husband and I did not care for it at all. He enjoys eating artichokes, but this was a bit strange. It also lacked flavor.

I rated this a 4 star because of all the changes I made based on previous reviews. I put artichokes in food processer with several thick slices of onion, about 1 tsp of chopped garlic and processed.  I mixed 1/2 cup mayonnaise and 1/2 cup sour cream along with 3/4 cup parm. cheese and added the chopped mix.  I did not have marinated artichokes so I brushed a robust italian dressing on my chicken prior to adding the topping.  I also baked longer - 50 min.  The result was very good however next time I will used the marinated artichokes.  Will def. make again.

If you like capers, they are a great addition to this recipe!  Like many others suggested, I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  I added 1 6 oz jar of marinated artichokes, 1 small can of muchrooms (finely chopped), and 2 Tbsp of capers to the mix and sprinkled paprika on top.  Very good stuff

This was really good. My Husband loved it. I am glad I used half sour cream half mayo, since it still tasted a smitch to mayo like.  I also cooked 10 more minutes, since it was a little pink after just 30 minutes.  Will make again soon.

I thought this was really good. Not great for your waste line but yummy. I used 1/2 cup light sour cream and 1/4 cup lit mayo. I didn't have the marinated artichoke and only had the kind in a can with water. So I sautéed them in garlic and olive oil (be sure you squeeze all he water out of them) and then cut them up. I didn't use any seasoning except what the recipes said and it was good. My six year old loved it. Thanks!

This recipe was really good! I cooked it at 350 for a bit longer til it was golden crispy.  My 11 year old son even ate it without complaining (He always complains). I also used a little less mayonaise than the recipe called for. I will definetly make it again!

Really Easy.  I made this for a dinner with friends and it was met with rave reviews.  Such a great way to use artichokes.

I agree, way too rich with the mayo. Next time I'm thinking I will only use a few tablespoons and the rest sourcreme. Otherwise the chicken was perfectly cooked and tender!

This is delicious!  I pounded the chicken breasts beforehand so they would bake evenly in the oven-- the baking time was perfect.  I also made some extra topping and used it as an artichoke dip for another meal, it works well!

Liked this original recipe but it was a bit tangy...so I took the advice of previous posters and switched to 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  I also use marinated artichokes that I squeeze to get most of the juice out.  Then I add chopped roasted red peppers to the mix as well.  Just before the dish is finished I top it with shredded mozzarella and bake until it's browned.  Fabulous...my husband asks for it again within days!

This is an excellent recipe as is.  I plan to serve it for company with some light sides as it is pretty rich.  I like to "adjust" recipes to my taste but this one needs no improvement!

loved this recipe.  Very easy to make and it tastes great.  I took the advice of others and used half lite sour cream and half LF mayo and it was even better (not to mention it cut a LOT of calories).

Made this with 1/2 c. light mayo and 1/2 c. light sour cream with some garlic herb sprinkle.  (No garlic pepper here.)  Lovely creamy sauce.  It made enough to smother 6 or even 8 chicken breasts, though I only used 4.  Then again, the sauce with wild rice is yummy all on its own.  We had no trouble making it disappear.  My 8 year old liked it, though she wouldn't normally go near an artichoke.  My 5 year old did not care for it, true to form.  Will make this again.  Thanks!

I LOVE this recipe!  Since everyone in my house refuses to eat artichokes, I end up making a dish for myself when I get the urge, and then eat on it for a few meals. Mainly because of this, I usually end up buying the little strips of chicken instead of whole breasts (or I cut up breasts). I serve it (to myself ha) over rice and end up mixing it all up anyway.  I haven't tried it over pasta, but I'm sure it would be great. I think its a little strong to eat by itself, but that might be just my taste. I also end up using more than a pinch of garlic pepper, and totally think it makes the dish and wouldn't substitute. Great and easy recipe!

I replaced the 3/4 cup mayonnaise with 1/2 cup mayo, half cup fat free Miracle Whip mixture. I also added a little sour cream, and a tablespoon each of mustard, horseradish sauce, and lemon juice. A really EXTREMELY good and easy to make dinner.

EXCELENT!! I followed the advice of others and added 3/4 - 1 cup of sour cream along with the mayo. I like extra sauce. I also made spinach on the side. It went very will with the chicken.

A nice blend of flavors. I used 1/2 reduced fat sour cream and 1/2 mayo as suggested by other reviewers. I also sprinkled the chicken with salt, pepper, and a little oregano before adding the artichoke mixture.

Not bad.  I liked the idea of the sauce (because I had mayo & s. cream on hand!)  Other than that... it was pretty much nothing like the recipie. I sauteed the chicken & seasoned it, then chopped it up. Did not have artichokes -- but rather used a variety of veggies -- sauteed zucchini, onion, muchrooms, peppers, asparagus. Mixed veggies & chicken into mayo/s. cream/parm. cheese mixture, baked for 20 min @ 350, topped w/ shredded mozzrerela. Quick & easy! And pretty darm tasty!

Soooo easy, Soooo tasty!  My husband absolutely loved this and wants me to make it for his family next time we visit them!  This is definitely a good, quick, different and soooo tasty family meal. Pairs great with a cold chardonnay, too!  BTW- I used 1/2 cup reduced fat sour cream and 1/3 cup mayo, put some lemon pepper + minced garlic into the topping, and broiled at the end with some mozarella cheese on top (as mentioned by a previous reviewer).  Yummmy!

This recipe is really great and I've made it for several small dinner parties!  I did make a couple of changes the 2nd time I made it though...used fresh chopped garlic, added a 1/4 cup dry white wine and threw in a can of sliced mushrooms.  Served over white rice with a sprinkle of parsley.  Very simple but elegant.

This hit the spot one night when I wanted something fast for dinner for myself.  It is OK.  It seems to be missing something. I put in some crushed red pepper for some more flavor.  If you like artichoke, its worth a try!

I took a reviewer's advice and browned my chicken first after pounding it out a bit to help speed up the cooking process. The sauce is a bit thick, but not a problem. I also added minced garlic and capers as another reviewer had suggested. The next time I make it I will try it with mushrooms and frozen spinach. My family of picky eaters (four children under 6) and my husband loved this dish. I plan on making it a regular menu item. It's so easy!

this is my favorite to eat.  Let me tell you, this was the first time I ever tasted artichokes and now I'm the biggest fan.  The chicken was perfect and flavor was incredible.  I suggest eating it with pasta... linguine was great with it... it's more of a pasta type of dish because of the rich flavor... 1 thing that bothers me is the oiliness of the dish, but if I were to skimp on the mayo for the sake of the oil and ruin the flavor, I'll just keep to the recipe with the linguine.

This is basically hot artichoke dip on chicken.  I used about 1/2c mayo and 1/4c sour cream; didn't have garlic pepper so added in a fresh minced garlic clove.  My dear stepdaughter LOVED it and rated it a 5; I'm thinking more like 3.5.  Thanks for the recipe, ARDrury.

We both loved this chicken and artichoke recipe. I will make sure that next time  after I rinse off my chicken then I will pat it with paper towels to remove any extra water. Just wondering if browning first would be good. It really is wonderful almost melts in you mouth tender.

I'll definitely make this recipe again, I just tweaked a few things to suit my tastes.  I would definitely recommend marinated artichokes instead of plain canned ones.  When I just used canned ones I added 2 tsp. dried dill.  Also, spend the extra $1 and get the higher quality artichokes (instead of storebrand), otherwise you may get a few tough choke tips.  I drained the artichokes to solve the water problem and to make it a little more heart friendly I used 1/4 cup light mayo and 1/4 light yogurt.  I love artichoke dip and now I love artichoke chicken!

Very moist and tender!  I followed other suggestions and sprinkled the chicken with paprika and fresh garlic.  Then I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  I also used marinated artichoke hearts, which I think caused the dish to be a little salty for us.  Next time I will try plain ones to see if it cuts down on the saltiness.

Made this last night (with some changes) and hubby and I liked it a lot.  Chicken was very moist & the topping was delicious.  Picky 5-yr old & 2-yr old sons actually ate the artichokes while our adventurous-eating 6-yr old daughter scraped them off - go figure!  
To reduce baking time, I pounded the chicken breasts to make them thinner, and I put them in the oven for the 5-10 minutes it took me to assemble the topping, to give them a head start on cooking.  
To reduce the fat content, I used less than 1/2 cup of light mayo & about 1/4 cup of Parmesan plus lots of garlic powder, a generous squirt of fresh lemon juice, and some pepper.  We did not find the mayo taste overpowering, maybe because I used less & it allowed the artichoke flavor, enhanced by the lemon juice, to come through.  Also mixed some bread crumbs with a little olive oil and sprinkled that on top for a nice crust.  
Fast & easy to prepare on a worknight and will definitely go into our rotation.

wow, this was delicious!! i also used half sour cream and half mayo, rather than all of the mayo, but other than that followed recipe exactly. the only things i'll probably do different next time are to sear the chicken a bit for added texture and top with a sprinkle of fresh parmesan cheese for a crispy topping. hubby raved about this and i find myself craving it again already!

This was good but for my personal tastes, not the best.  A little too greasy tasting.  My husband loved it though, so I'll probably make it again.  I did substitute more than half the mayo with sour cream and used minced garlic and salt and pepper instead of garlic pepper.  I think next time I will substitute sour cream for all of the mayo and cut the amount in half - just use maybe 1/4 cup.  The marinated artichokes and cheese should carry enough flavor for the dish.  It took close to an hour to cook in my oven!  And my oven is not typically slow like that - I think it was due to the large amount of topping on the chicken breasts - be aware that this could take much longer to cook in your oven.  I would probably use less topping next time anyway.

The whole family enjoyed this one! The chicken was juicy and tender, and the sauce was very delish(Although, I found it too salty). After reading the other reviews, I used only 1/4c.fat-free sour cream, and 1/2c mayo(Next time will try less mayo, more s.c.). Will certainly make again!

KILLER! I'm the one who says it is not fair to rate the recipe any lower than 5 stars IF you don't follow it exactly.
With that in mind I did use half mayo & a quarter sour cream, added a quarter tsp. crushed garlic & dried parsley & sprinkled paprika on top. It was GREAT!
Thanks!

I am only giving this recipe four stars as written but with changes i give it five stars. I did as others suggested and used half mayo and half sour cream (both low fat). Also i added in some crushed garlic, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and sprinkled the top with some chopped jalepenos for some heat. My husband raved about this recipe!! It will be a staple quick and easy dinner in our house.

This recipe is great! I made a few amendments to the original recipe. I substituted Delallo's marinated artichokes for ordinary artichokes. Also, to ensure that the dish wasn't "runny", I completely drained the artichokes and even squeezed the excess moisture out of each of the artichoke hearts. I also recommend adding a dash of white pepper and sprinkling some garlic salt into the dish. This dish took a bit longer than 30 minutes to cook...use a thermometer to check the temperature of the poultry after 30 minutes in a 375 degree oven. Enjoy!

This recipe is great. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it is quite rich. However, if you simply make just the artichoke mixture and bake it on its own, you have a fabulous artichoke dip as well! We definitely will make this one again.

THIS IS AWESOME!!  I also used half sour cream half mayonaise due to other comments and also some minced garlic but other than that I followed the recipe.  Served on a bed of pasta with a side salad this is a fast, great weeknight meal but would also be excellent for company.

Very good - I took the advice of other reviewers and used half mayo and half sour cream.  One of my chicken breasts was a little large so I needed to bake a little longer than the recipe called for.  Very tasty with pasta!

This was really great.  I did 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup mayo, but other than that I followed the recipe.  My kids and husband, who can sometimes be picky, loved it, and right after I finished eating it I couldn't wait to have it again.  It will definitely be added to my main meal rotation!!  Thanks!

Excellent taste.  I added 1 cup of fresh mushrooms and substituted half the mayonnaise with half low fat sour cream.  This will go in my normal rotation.  Nice work.

Chicken was very moist, but you have to like the flavor of mayonnaise for this dish.  I did use half mayo and half light sour cream.  If I try this again, next time I will probably use all sour cream, since I am not a mayo fan at all.  Served over fettuccine noodles.

I liked this. I used a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of mayo, because I really hate mayo. It tasted  delicious and was a good substitute. I also added some red, yellow and orange cut up peppers to the mixture before putting it on the chicken. Do make it have more veggies.

I was really excited about making this dish... I love artichoke dip and thought the addition of chicken sounded great... 
well, i was very wrong... I did exactly as the recipe read... just did not taste good... also had to cook it a good 20 min longer.  will not be making this again.

A friend made this for me while I was visiting this past Christmas, and I loved it!!  It has a very satisfying flavor, and the sauce that coats the chicken tastes great  with rice and broccoli.  It's also easy because it requires so few ingredients!  Thanks Elisabeth for introducing me to it!  I'll be making it at home.  One other note:  my 12-year-old son, who doesn't care for sauces, liked this, so try it with your kids, even though it has artichokes in it.  They'll never know if you don't tell!

I really liked the chicken, I would have given it 4 & 1/2 stars, but my husband thought the artichoke topping was too rich & ended up scraping off.  He did eat the chicken as it was very moist under the artichokes.  I did add 1/2 cup sour cream as suggested by other reviewers.  So, even if my husband isn't nuts about this it's going to have to growon him because I thought it was really tasty will make this again!

I love this recipe!  It's easy.  I use a small jar of marinated artichokes and use a little of the marinade in the sour cream/mayo mixture.  I also sprinkle with Italian bread crumbs prior to baking.  I serve it with spaghetti with a little bit of olive oil.  My teenage daughter won't eat it because it has artichokes (even though I don't really care for artichokes).  It's delicious and easy.  I don't think you will be disappointed.

Very flavorful and different than any chicken dish I've made.  Using low-fat mayo helped to take away some of the mayo taste as my husband does not like mayo.  I love this dish and make it often.  Thank you so much!

I've made this a few times, and it is rich but amazing...also do the part lite sour cream/part lite mayo...tonite seasoned the chicken breasts with a little adobo seasoning first, mixed sauted fresh spinach and garlic in with the sauce mix, and for the last 5 min. placed under the broiler with a sprinkling of shredded Swiss cheese..best version yet!

Okay I was super excited about this recipe. I love artichokes, artichoke dip, chicken, mayo - I love it all... But I did not love this dish at all. I did do the half sour cream half mayo and everything else was right as the recipe said... Oh, and I had to cook it about 20 minutes longer than it said. Won't make again.

I LOVED this! I love mayo and artichokes though so put them together and I'm in heaven! I served with plain couscous and it was fantastic! Next time, I may add some drops of hot sauce for a little kick.

I thought this was an interesting recipe. After reading some of the reviews I used nonfat sour cream and lite mayo for the 3/4 cup. I also sauted onion, mushrooms, frozen spinach, Tbsp of capers with the artichokes. I cut the chicken into piesces and added several Tbls of lemon juice w/salt,pepper, garlic,tyme..I also put bread crumbs on top and baked it until brown. YUMMY! My husband and I almost ate the whole dish which was enough for four! I will make this again!

This recipe definitely fell short of my expectations.  I think I would have called it mayonnaise chicken because it definitely drowned out the flavors of the parmesan and artichokes.  The chicken WAS really moist and had a great flavor, but I think if I made this again I'd try it with some cream of chicken or cream of mushroom soup instead of the mayo.

Great recipe.  I used thinly sliced chicken breast, fresh garlic, ground pepper, and substituted 1/2 the mayo with sour cream.  Will make again!

This was absolutely wonderful.  I did stray from the recipe a little by substituting fresh garlic and fresh ground pepper for the garlic pepper, but everyone loved it including my 9 year old niece and 2 year old daughter.  We served it over some white rice and it was perfect.

Tastes just like my favorite artichoke dip, only as a main dish!  The kids even asked for seconds!  The chicken breasts took a long time to cook all the way through, so next time I will pound them out to make them thin to cook faster.  Would be tasty with some spinach added to the topping too.

This dish was divine and the chicken was very tender!  I also used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream and I sauteed chicken in some olive oil and garlic before baking.  I threw some minced garlic into the sour cream misture and topped it all off with bread crumbs!  Great dish and fast and easy to make!

Terrific! Like spreading artichoke dip over chicken. Used lemon pepper instead of garlic pepper, and shredded Parmesan instead of grated. Will add diced jalapeno next time.

I LOVE artichokes and chicken is a staple in my family. I'm always trying to find new ways to prepare chicken. This was GREAT! My husband doesan't care for artichokes but he gobbles this dish up. His plate was clean before I started on mine. The only thing I did different was use 2 big tablespoons of light miricle whip and added bread crumbs and as a side dish boiled some noodles and garlic bread, it was delish, the entire family enjoyed it.

When I started making this meal, I was starving after a long day of running errands.  I put a little bit of the artichoke mixture in the microwave and did a dip with pita chips - wonderful!!  I did half mayo and sour cream as others suggested.  We were tired of chicken so I used cod (fish) filets instead.  Delicious!  I used half marinated artichoke hearts because it's what I had on hand.  I liked the taste of half marinated and half not. my family (4 teens, 3 adults) would have liked less Parmesan cheese in the artichoke mixture - too cheesy for them.  But other than that we will make this again.  I may even use it as a dip for the Holidays!!

I have never cooked with artichokes and chicken before and my Hubby and I thought this receipt was so yummy!  We both love Mayo and the only thing different I used, was I put a little bit of garlic powder since I did not have any garlic pepper. This was very easy and I will try this again using half the mayo and half lowfat sour cream to see how it taste per what the other reviews said.  My husband has never eaten artichoks cooked and he loved it!
Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent and so easy!  This makes a great weekday meal.  Since I'm only cooking for two, I substituted egg noodles (cooked) for two of the chicken breasts, which made it a great all in one meal.  I also did the 1/2 sour cream substitution recommended in many of the reviews.

This was excellent, but because I didn't realize that I didn't have mayo until I was already going, I really changed it up.  I cut up 4 chicken breast and sauteed it with the garlic pepper in the olive oil, then mixed together the artichokes with 1 can cr. of chicken soup and 1 cup of sour cream and 3/4 c. parmesan cheese.  I sprayed my casserole dish and covered the bottom with egg noodles, then the chicken, then the artichoke mixture.  I topped it with mozzarella cheese and cooked at 375 for 30 minutes - turned out yummy!  I have mayo on my grocery list to try it the right way next, but just in case you did what I did, this recipe is still great!

Although this is very fatty, we love it.  I have made this a couple of times and have found that the cook time for us is more like 50 minutes.  Maybe it is just our oven.  Great recipe, though!

I made a few changes. I used 1/2 cup lite sour cream and a 1/4 cup of  mayo.  I also added a handful of baby spinach and topped with panko.  I used 2 breasts with the same amount of topping.  It turned out really good! I think next time I would cut the chicken into chunks.

Not so good.  Even after scraping the topping off, not a single one of my three kids would even touch the chicken.  Finally, I had to relent:  this just was not a good meal.  Sorry!

My husband and I love this recipe!  I added about 1/4t salt.  It took over 45 minutes for my chicken to cook thoroughly because they were large pieces.

This is REALLY GREAT!  It seemed too simple to be so good, but it was wonderful!  Don't let the simnplicity fool you!  I made it during Grandma's visit and we each LOVED it!  We served it with white rice, like a gravy!  FABULOUS!!  Thanks for sharing!

This is soooo good!  The only thing I changed was make enough topping for 6 chicken breasts.  This was a huge hit with my kids too.  I served it with Angel  hair pasta with a little olive oil and some garlic seasoning and french bread.  Thanks!

Pretty good.  The cook time was a little too long and made the chicken a little dry.  It was great with a little whole wheat pasta with alfredo sauce.

This is easy to prepare and very tasty.
If using large chicken breasts you will have to adjust the baking time. Definitely will make again.

Made this for dinner with friends and it was a huge hit. The top was crunchy and the chicken was tender. Didn't tell hubby what was in it since he's not a huge artichoke fan, he loved the tangy flavor. Made au gratin potatoes from the site to go with and it was a nice compliment.

Very good, actually similar to an artichoke dip recipe that is a family favorite.  I left out the garlic pepper and just sprinkled fresh ground pepper on the top before baking and used asiago instead of parmesan.

This recipe is awesome! There wasn't a bite left after I served it to my family! I actually put the ingredients in the food processor so it made sort of a paste that I spread that over the chicken (I used tenders - they cook faster). Thank you for the recipe - can't wait to serve it again to friends!

I was really looking forward to trying this recipe, but was a little diappointed.  I'm not sure why....I love artichokes, artichoke dip, chicken.  But something about this wasn't right.  I'd definitely broil it if I decided to give it another try.

Five stars does not do this justice. 
I used chicken tenders instead of breast. I also mashed the artichoke mixture with a potato masher until it was a paste and covered the entire chicken with the mixture. For a little extra flavor, I added sauted onions and mushrooms to the top of the paste five minutes before I took it out of the oven. My wife said this was by FAR the best chicken she had ever eaten!! I don't think I could ever tire of this recipe and I can't wait to make it again! Thank you Ardrury for the best chicken recipe ever!

This is great!  It is quick and easy too!  I made a few alterations to the recipe.  I browned the chicken and chopped it up in small pieces as other reviewers suggested.  For the artichokes, I drained them and used a paper towel to squeeze out the excess liquid in the artichokes.  I couldn’t find garlic pepper at the store so I minced 1 fresh garlic clove and added some pepper.  I mixed it with the cheese and mayo, put it on top of the chicken and then I baked it.  My mother who doesn’t like artichokes even liked this!  She took a small bite and said,  “Oh, this is good!  It has a really good flavor.  Can I have some more?”  I couldn’t have said it better myself!

This recipe is fantastic! I find it works better to use chicken tenderloins (small strips) instead of breasts. They cook more evenly, and are very tender! Hubby loves it.

Best chicken you can make without excessive measuring of ingredients.  I was surprised how thoroughly cooked the chicken ends up without having to turn over.  I suppose the creamy topping keeps the heat over the chicken well.  I put the chicken on a sheet of foil over a flat rack on a baking sheet so any liquid runs off.  Great for low-carb diets!

It turned out that this was one of the best things I ever cooked. I wasn't even sure if I'd like it when I read the recipe. I used frozen artichokes, low-fat mayo, low-fat parm and 2 fresh chopped garlic cloves and fresh ground pepper. Served it with angel hair pasta. Thank you for this recipe! Awesome!

This recipe was great. It took almost no time at all to throw together. I added 3 tbsp of pine nuts just to add a little something extra. I also had to cook for longer than the 30 minutes before the chicken was done. It turned out so tender and juicy.

I just wanted to say thanks for such a great recipe.  My husband said this is the best dish that I've ever made.  He actually wants me to make it for an upcoming dinner party.  I actually didn't have any Parmesan Cheese on hand so I used Feta Cheese instead it turned out awesome.

Thanks Again,
Sheila

The chicken recipe is GREAT!!!  I did change the recipe a bit, though.  I sprinkled the chicken breast lightly with garlic powder and then added 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil to a skillet and seared both sides before putting them in the pan.  It added a lot of good flavor.  I also took other's advice and used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  I didn't have any garlic pepper, so I used the same garlic powder that I used on the chicken breast in the artichoke mixture.  I will definantely be making this dish over and over again.

Simple and delicious - I followed the advice of others and scaled the 3/4 cup of Mayo to l/4 cup Mayo, l/4 cup Sour Cream and I added a minced clove of garlic.  I followed the recipe for "4" but only used 2 chicken breasts and I"m glad I did.  The artichoke mixture is wonderful and I would have been wanting more if I had scaled that back to 2.  Sprinkled paprika on it before baking so that it came out golden without having to broil it.  Thanks submitter.

I thought this was pretty good, but my husband felt it was a little on the rich side.  Had I had some sour cream, that might have lightened it a bit.  I  did cut the mayo to 1/2 cup as suggested and used fresh pressed garlic and fresh shredded parmesan.  I baked it at 500 degrees for 15 minutes and it came out really moist!  I broiled it at the end to give it a little more color as well.  This is a quick and easy way to bake chicken that I use whenever I'm rushed for time (and with a 3 year old constantly tugging at me - that's all the time!!)  If I make this again, I'll try 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 mayo.

For being new to the cooking world, this was a great recipe to use.  I followed the advice of others and changed the mayo to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I also added garlic powder and mushrooms.  The husband loved it and was impressed :-) This is a keeper! Thanks for the recipe.

This was really good and easy.  I did add the can of mushrooms for added interest, used one clove of crushed garlic, freshly ground pepper, and cut the mayo down to 1/2 cup.  I found it took an hour to cook regular unpounded boneless chicken breasts, so I had to cover it with foil half way through.

Not bad.  I was impressed that my husband actually ate this and said he would eat it again.  That fact alone bumped it from 3 stars to 4.  My husband ate artichokes??  I still can't believe it.

The only thing I did differently was to use 2 gloves of crushed garlic in place of the garlic pepper...we love garlic, though and I pounded the breasts a bit.  This is absolutely delicious.  DH and I both LOVED it!

I took this recipie, and made it a completely different dinner........I found that I didn't have enough chicken stir fry pieces to feed the whole family, so I took the artichokes and whisked them with the mayo in the food processor, and on the side I sauteed the chicken pieces in some olive oil until golden brown.  Then I put the artichoke mixture on top of pizza dough, topped with the chicken and mozz/parm cheese.  Very good, and a quick save for a dinner to feed all of us!

This was very tasty. I used 1/2 mayo and will probably try adding some sour cream next time. I used way more than a pinch of garlic pepper - yum. I added a few splashes of lemon juice and some mushrooms and I cut up each chicken breast into four pieces. Served over rice. My husband and I loved it. I will make this again!

I made this for dinner for my husband (who claims to not like artichokes) and myself.  It was wonderful.  I used low fat mayo and reduced fat parmesan and omitted the garlic.  I had to cook it a little longer due to the thickness of the chicken breasts.  We both loved it.  We'll definitely be having this again in our home.

Made this for dinner this evening. Fabulous. I used half fat free sour cream and half smart beat mayo instead of all mayo and used one ounce of fresh grated parmigiano/reggiano cheese. I baked for 45 minutes since the breasts used were thick. Next time I made this, I think I'll reduce the mayo/sour cream a bit. There was more than enough. Thanks for the easy delcious recipe.

This went over like gangbusters, and I was feeding a picky eater and two pregnant women, so that's saying something.  I subbed minced garlic and fresh ground pepper for the "garlic pepper", and went a little lighter on the mayo. That's an awful lot of mayo.  But overall, very tasty, great over rice.

I thought this recipe was really, really good! I love artichoke dip, and the flavor was similar. The coating was crunchy and declicious. I used large chicken breast pieces with the bone and cooked it for an hour. The meat was very moist. My family loved it and they kept picking at the bone when all was eaten - a sure sign of approval. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe!

I ran across this recipe about 2 years ago.  It is WONDERFUL!  My husband never cared for artichokes until I made this dish.  After a few times making it I switched to artichoke bottoms.  They really work better.  Just made this 2 nights ago for company and it was a hit!

This dish was quite delish!  I used the suggestions that the previous rating made, (adding lemon juice to the mixture, browning the chicken and then deglazing and adding that to the mixture) and it came out great.  Moist and FULL of flavor!  This is definitely a keeper!!

Maybe you really have to love artichokes, but I did not like this recipe.  Very sour tasting.  Maybe a half can of artichokes would be better.

So good!! I added a bit more garlic powder-
Maybe about 1.5 tbsp. Also added salt and pepper  to mix. Only used 3 Lg chix breast instead of 4. Didn’t make a difference! More topping! Can’t wait to make again.

Absolutely love this dish.  I've made it more then several times and I even would take the leftovers and add pasta or make a Hot sub sandwich (artesian french bread) with it.

I thought this dish was okay but not great. I followed the recipe closely with the exception of taking others advice and used half mayo and half sour cream. The chicken itself wasn’t very tender. Perhaps it was the quality of the. Chicken. The artichoke mixture is similar to the baked dip version which I love. Since my husband did not like it, I scraped it off and ate it later as a dip with bagel chips.

This was excellent!  Just like restaurant quality!  Easy, and common in-the-frig ingredients too!  I paired it with bowtie pasta and used the juice in the bottom of the casserole dish to put on the pasta instead of butter.  Yummy!  It looked just as good as the picture.

WOW. This recipe exceeded my expectations. I did add some fresh minced garlic to the mayo/artichoke mixture per my families preferences, but other than that I made it exactly as written. Even my picky toddler loved it. I will definitely be making this again

I have made this a couple times, once exactly as written and it was okay.  The other time I substituted fat free Greek yogurt for the mayo and it was AMAZING.   I will definately make it again with yogurt,  I also threw a little blue cheese in the second time I made it, that is a great touch too if you like that flavor

Amazing and easy!! I’m honestly an awful cooking. This is easy and super tasty!!  I added a ton more garlic and I used the artichokes that are soaked in oil and seasonings. I didn’t have enough chicken but I put the rest of the sauce over wild rice. Unbelievable. I will make this over and over!!

Absolutely amazing!!! Unfortunately I must have bought chicken breast that came from an “older” chicken because the chicken itself was stringy and very difficult to cut even with a serrated knife. I even covered and baked for an additional 35 min! But making it again with chicken breast tenders and hopefully it will be much better! But the flavor was awesome! I used Kirkland signature artichoke hearts marinated in oil from Costco!

We love this recipe!! So quick and easy. The artichokes give it a bit of tang and the creamy mayo/cheese makes a nice sauce. It’s our go to now for a “fancy” chicken dish!

Such a SIMPLE dish to make!
Our family & friends finish it every time I make it (eg. no leftovers).
I topped it off with some extra grated parmesean cheese and a small amount of Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing as a topping this time and it did NOT disappoint. Cheers!

So yummy!!  Best chicken dish ever!!  I add one can of Ortega chilies, scallions, and use 2 cans of artichoke bottoms!  Using the bottoms you never have to deal with tough artichoke leaves, and doubling  the amount of artichokes saves me the need for adding another side vegetable.

This was really good, easy to make, and different. We don’t like chicken breasts so I used boneless thighs and followed others advice and used 1/2 sour cream.   I will definitely make it again.

Love this dish! I did follow some wonderful recommendations in the reviews. One thing I did was pound and marinate the breasts for about 6-8 hours in Italian dressing. Because I used 5 rather large breasts I increased the recipe using 20 ounces of marinated artichoke hearts well drained and chopped, 1/2 cup of mayo, 1/2 cup of low fat sour cream, a dash of lemon pepper and a dash of garlic powder.

Making this for second time in like a week my husband and I liked it so much.  Only change I made was I did marinate the artichokes, added some fresh herbs from my garden, basil. chives and parsley and a little lemon-- and used 1/2 c. of avocado mayo and 1/4 cup Hellmanns.  OH and a little panko on top to make it crispy. So good!

This was really good. I added some mushrooms chopped up to the topping mixture, and I added some shredded cheddar cheese on the top and the end of the baking time and baked it for another 5 minutes until it was melted. So good!

Made it with half sour cream & half mayo like a review recommended, and topped it with a layer of bread-crumbs. Solid meal and I'd definitely make it again.

This was super tasty, and possibly one of the easiest recipes I've ever made. Minor changes: I used chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts, and garlic powder + ground pepper because I didn't have any garlic pepper. The flavors of the mayo and artichoke hearts work well together.

Next time I think I'll try a little bacon and mushrooms, as well as the marinated artichoke heart suggestion. 

Easy, easy, super easy and tastes fancier than it is. Served on a bed of tri-color quinoa.

No changes, perfect as is.  Everyone loves this!

I had to make a second casserole just for my grandchildren because they are Gluten and Dairy (Casein) Free!  I substituted their ingredients and they loved it.

Although my artichoke-skeptic husband would have rated this lower, I thought this was absolutely tasty and will make it again.  There is a lot of potential for this to be a GREASY recipe if followed to a T, so be sure to make the edits needed for your personal tastes.

I followed the recipe as is. It was quick and easy and I had all of the ingredients on hand. Next time I make it I will half the amount of Parmesan cheese. It was a little bit too salty for our tastes. It also reheats nicely the next day as a lunch.

Followed the recipe plus major suggestions (drain artichokes well and do half mayo & half sour cream).   Husband said chicken was moist - but really bland.   I won't be making this again.

Very good. I used marinated artichokes, 1/2 cup mayo & a 1/4 sour cream. Not sure if i had to change up the 3/4 mayo or not but next time I will probably use a little minced garlic. Also needed longer cooking than 30 minutes.

Very nice change from the usual meals here. I did use marinated  artichoke, minced garlic and added mushrooms to the mix  (it just seemed right) . I think I'll add some sour cream next go as some have suggested.  Nice dish, I enjoyed it thoroughly.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this quick and easy delicious meal.  I did brown my chicken before assembling the dish.  The chicken was moist and really tender and so very good with that cheese and artichoke topping.  I forgot to get a picture.

Delicious! I made it with chicken tenders and was afraid the chicken who have dried out, but it was perfect. I put it under the broiler when it was done to crisp up the top. My husband was very impressed. I told him how easy it was, and he was even more impressed. I might try making it with yogurt next time for a healthier option. Thoughts ?

I'm surprised by how good this recipe is!  Some changes can be made to suit your tastes, (a little less mayo, for instance), but it's not necessary.  Definitely try it as written first.

This dish is easy, quick and quite delicious.  It's a guy's kind of recipe!  I did as so many suggested and used 1/2 cup of sour cream and only 1/4 cup of mayo - and I liked the way it turned out.  I also toasted some Panko bread crumbs which I sprinkled on top of the dish before I put it into the oven. Not needed but it is a nice extra touch.

I changed nothing.  This was one of the very few recipes that my partner rated as "Excellent."  The chicken breasts were juicy and full of flavor.  I'll definitely be making this one again (and again).

Not sure if I did something completely wrong here...it looked and smelled great. But was exactly like eating artichoke dip dumped on some chicken. Waaay to rich for a full dinner, maybe if there was much more chicken diced up and sautéed first. I will not be making this again. Waste of my artichoke hearts(they taste better right out of the jar).

I did half mayo half sour cream. I used marinated artichokes and squeezed the juices out. It was delicious and my husband is asking for it again. Next time I will be sure to tenderize and thin the chicken since it ended up taking a long time to cook all the way through.

My family loves this recipe! It is one of our favorite dishes and we make it all the time. It is quick, easy, and requires few ingredients, but is still delicious! The only modification we made was the addition of about half of a full slice of bacon, so that it adds just enough bacon flavor without overpowering the dish.

I love artichokes so I was going to love this no matter what. A bit more bland than I expected, but I will definitely make again and add mushrooms and maybe more spices. I used mayo and sour cream as suggested by others. Chicken was very moist. If you like artichokes I suggest you try this dish.

As other reviewers have suggested, I made this with marinated artichoke hearts with the water squeezed out, added 8 oz of mushrooms drained and chopped, and replaced 3/4 cup of mayo with 1/2 cup of mayo and added in 1/2 cup of sour cream.  This was absolutely delicious and so very easy.

This was incredible!!! I followed another reviewer idea and added panko breadcrumbs the last 10 min. I also put half a piece of provolone over each chicken breast before adding mixture. (Not needed but good) Used half sour cream and half hellmans mayo. My husband and I ate every bite!!!

Excellent. Easy, simple, fast. Mine took a little longer to cook through than 30 minutes. Next time I may pound the chicken to an even thickness.

Didnt think they would go for the mayo, but it was a success!

This was super easy! I used thin chicken breasts and layered them with the sauce. Since it was so rich I just made a nice salad and bread to go with it.

This recipe is amazing! It's quick and easy, tastes amazing! I made it for two of us, used 2 chicken breasts (boneless/skinless), 1/3c parmesan, 1/2 jar of marinated artichokes (spooned out of jar) + a small spoonful of marinade, instead of 1/3 cup mayo, I used half mayo, half low-fat sour cream. (Omitted garlic pepper). Served with rice and spinach. WOW! Will make again and again!

Wonderful recipe. I use frozen artichokes. The other night, I added lemon, capers (instead of salt), minced garlic, chopped onions, and I usually do half mayo and half yogurt. Depends on what I have on hand. I have added wilted greens on the chicken before the artichoke mixture.

I made this for the second time.  I made the suggested change of cutting mayo in half and adding sour cream.  I thought it was just OK.  It needs some thing to pep it up and, although I am not afraid to experiment, I couldn't think  of anything.  My wife likes it so I will likely make it again but not very often.

It was delicious!!! I added sautéed mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, used a “divan” type sauce of Miracle Whip and sour cream.  I took a hint from another review and served over a bed of spinach and it was divine!

I sautéed chopped onion and mushrooms, before adding it to the artichoke mix. Subbed half the mayo with sour cream. Pounded the chicken breasts flatter. (I can see why others have browned the chicken before cooking, it's very white under the spread.) In fact the final dish will look pale, so before the 30 minutes are up, put it under the broiler to improve color. Note to self: try adding spinach or at least serving on the side. 2ND Review: I added thawed (squeezed dry) spinach as a bottom layer, then chicken and artichoke mix.  The last ten minutes I sprinkled on bread crumbs, extra Parmesan and paprika. Final meal was delicious, hearty and colorful.  Win win.

Have made this multiple times- the entire family likes it; even those who don't like artichokes. We substitute plain yogurt for the mayo or use half plain yogurt/ half mayo with good results. This recipe can also handle the addition of veggies, we use thawed and drained frozen spinach 1-2 packages depending on how many are in the freezer -just mix in with the cheese mixture and bake as directed.

I use a digital meat thermometer and took it out of the oven a few degrees before to rest.  We were VERY disappointed in this recipe.  We could not believe how flavorless this was.  The chicken was not happy with this combination.  I have enough for a second meal so I will simmer in a marsala sauce to moisten it up and maybe salvage it.  I will have to delete this recipe from my favorites.

I did enjoy this with some changes - I subbed 1/2 cup nonfat Greek yogurt for some of the mayo and only used 1/2 cup parmesan.  Those changes brought the calories down to just over 300 and the fat to 16 g per serving. I liked the tang that the yogurt gave it.

We make this about once a month.  It's important to well drain the artichoke hearts if they are in olive oil.  Also, personal preference is that this is one of those meals that are best made, cooled, then reheated to eat to allow flavors to set up and reduce some of the "wateriness" of the dish when it's right out of the oven.  We also altered sprinkling additional garlic pepper over the top prior to be baking that adds a nice textural note.

This was pretty good. A tad too rich for me, I'm interested how it would have been with half sour cream like many other folks suggested.

But overall good (which is fortunate because I have a lot left!)

I used 3 large chicken breasts. Split horizontal and then in half; generously sprinkled with salt & pepper and lastly with paprika.  Added topping and covered with Panko bread crumbs.  Convection oven  baked at 350 degrees approximately 50 minutes, removed foil and baked additional 15 minutes at 375 degrees,  Delicious.  We will definitely use this recipe many times in the future.

Love this recipe.  I have made it twice  and both times everyone loved it.  I did use marinated artichoke and I squished out as much of the juice from the artichokes as possible before adding them to the recipe.  Highly recommend the recipe.

Excellent! Easy, easy recipe!!  Followed reviews by replacing half of mayo with sour cream. My husband said "this is a keeper", It is REALLY good! "
That settles it in our house & I love artichokes!

My husband really liked it and most importantly my 2 year old ate the entire serving. Like others, I sautéed some garlic and added it to the dish. I also added Italian breadcrumbs which gave it a crunch. I played it on fettuccine noodles and it paired deliciously.

Loved this dish! I needed a recipe for ingredients I had in hand and this was awesome! I browned the chicken in olive oil and salt then covered the breasts with the mixture and baked until bubbly and browned. Delish!!

This is one of the best recipes I have found for chicken!  I didn't have the garlic pepper, so I used 6 Pepper seasoning that I had on hand. I can't stop talking about this recipe to my family. I am insisting they all try it!! Of course I'll make it again! It's now my special recipe!!

Absolutely loved it!  From now on, I will keep a can of parm. cheese and artichokes handy for when I need a really "splendid" meal in a jiff.  It's a dish that is definitely going to impress your guests AND so very easy to throw together.

Family seemed to love this, all plates were licked clean! I used 6 chicken breasts (for 6 people) and just doubled the sauce for simplicity (to use 2 cans artichoke hearts). Pounded the chicken breasts and sprinkled with salt and pepper before putting in pan. (I didnt have garlic pepper so added garlic powder to sauce) I assumed it would need to bake longer since I basically doubled the recipe, but I think I baked a little too long... shouldve baked about 40-45 min. Served with orzo and sliced tomatoes (spinach wouldve been a nice addition as they did in the video). Will definitely make again! May try a jar of marinated artichoke hearts next time (and then leave out garlic powder?)

It was great,  and a hit with my son and husband.  I used one jar of marinated artichoke hearts drained and I think I"d do 2 next time.   And   I think I"ll try a lighter  Mayo and maybe grate some fresh parmesan.   I added some bacon pieces which was good, but the recipe doesn't really need any added salt if done this way so I'd leave that out next time.

2nd run: Scant 1/2 C mayo, heaping 1/4 C Sour cream, liberal California garlic powder, 2/3 C grated parm , some shredded parm on top...Still rich but way better and still eye popping!!
1st run: Easy to make and so tasty...my brother taster went crazy over this recipe! I mean his eyes popped out and noises came from his throat...ha ha! It was a bit rich for me but I only had 3 chix breasts so maybe there was too much artichoke mixture on each. I will try using less mayo next time out and YES...this dish definitely qualifies for multiple runs in my kitchen!

This is simply delicious! What a wonderful twist to ordinary chicken breast. The flavors are so unique. Must use marinated artichokes, and half and half mayo and sour cream. Also, I seasoned the chicken with “season-all” and garlic powder. I added a diced Serrano pepper and 2 diced garlic cloves to the artichoke mixture. So easy to make and so delicious! Win, win!

I have made this recipe many times and it is always great. I always double up on the topping. The last time I made this, I substituted riced cauliflower for the parmigiana cheese, to make it dairy free. Added two minced portobello mushrooms, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powders to taste. It was fantastic and the whole family loved it.

I've made this several times and it is delicious.  The only things I do differently is add spinach and some red pepper flakes.  Squeeze a little lemon on top before serving - yum yum.  It is a bit watery, but it doesn't really bother us.  I suppose squeezing the liquid out of the artichokes as one reviewer recommended would solve that issue.

Unless you really like the tangy taste, don't use Miracle Whip - it really masked everything else. But everyone cleaned their plates so 5 Stars!

Draining and drying the artichokes didn't work at all. Still ended up with the whole thing sitting in water. I will next bake it on a rack. Flavor was good. Extra garlic, half sour cream and half mayo, paprika.

Delicious and very easy to make. I used skinless, boneless, free range chicken thighs and served over white rice. Best dinner this week. I will definitely make this again. Thank you allrecipes.com and Amanda Bibb for sharing.

This wasn't too bad, definitely way too much mayo (will sub out for sour cream in the future like others suggest). Could also use more spices.

Easy. I served it on fettuccine noodles and grated more fresh parmesan cheese. I had to cook it for 10 minutes more to ensure the chicken was at the correct temp before serving.

My husband says I cook too much chicken so I was looking for something different.  We both thought this  was delicious!  I did use half sour cream, half mayo and topped with seasoned bread crumbs.  Will make this again!

This is so good!! I have also added chopped sundried tomatoes and sauteed onions, mushrooms & garlic.  I think it would also be good to add some baby spinach leaves.  The possibilities are endless.  I brown the chicken first, then mix in the sauteed vegies and chopped artichoke hearts.  Then I put it in a casserole dish and top with the sauce and bake at 375 for about 30 minutes.  DELISH and so easy!  Thanks for the post!

The topping was great no complaints, it was just basic artichoke dip. I did use sour cream as other reviewers suggested. The chicken was incredibly bland which just made the entire dish bland. I think next time I'll chop the chicken into smaller pieces and marinate it for awhile before hand.

I added mozzarella cheese as well. Cooked to 175. About an hour and a half. Very tasty but next time I will rinse the artichokes then press to get as much moisture out as possible. Easy to make. With nice flavor.

This was so easy and so delicious! I did use light mayo and added seasoned breadcrumbs on top, with butter spray for crispness. Was the perfect topping to compliment this already wonderful dish!

I cut the chicken into 2-3" pieces and bake for 15 minutes, then drain the juices. It keeps it from being runny at the bottom of pan. Delicious!

Excellent.  I didn’t have Parmesan cheese (used mild cheddar).  It was a little oily so next time I will try the sour cream idea mentioned in the comments.

So this came out ok. I used marinated artichokes and crumbled bacon per another reviewer. My only issue was the parmesan cheese, next time I will cut the amount in half, I like parmesan cheese but thought it was to overpowering. My significant other on the other hand seemed to like it just fine. I will try this again.

I've been making this recipe for over 10 years when I came across it in an old cook book I own. Every single time I fall in love. It's just delicious! Just make sure you're draining the artichokes well and the watery "sauce" won't be a big deal. I love reading some of the ways others have altered the recipe. I'll have to try that next!

Really enjoyed this, having incorporated changes (sour cream, add shredded spinach, consider tossing in some mushrooms and definitely butterfly the breasts to increase their surface).  High points for easy and company-worthy.

This was very good and easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly and chicken came out very moist.  I used very large breasts and good quality finely shredded parmesan cheese.  I baked it in convection oven at a 25 degree reduced temp for the recommended time.  Browned nicely and looked appealing.  I will make it again.

I added chopped spinach, mushrooms, and Montreal seasoning to the topping. Used a sour cream and mayo combo (50/50) and also covered with foil for the first 25-30 minutes so the chicken was tender. Baked for last 10-15 minutes uncovered for a slight crisp.

Delicious.  I used half mayonnaise and half sour cream as others suggested, mostly because I had it on hand.  I used minced garlic, salt and pepper instead of garlic pepper, and topped it with capers and paprika.  I served it with pasta that I dressed with the oil from the marinated artichokes.

A fantastic recipe .. I just prefer to marinate the chicken beforehand so as not to be bland, using salt, pepper and garlic powder. I dis it many times and everyone just loves it.

Love this meal, but prefer it best with a few changes: I season the chicken breasts with garlic powder, salt and cracked pepper. To the artichoke mixture, I add in some fresh garlic, scant cayenne pepper, and pearl onions. 15 minutes into baking, I top it with a mixture of Panko, garlic powder, cracked pepper and a little melted butter (mix and sprinkle on top of and return to oven). This recipe is fantastic this way, and still very easy.

Excellent. Reminded me of spinach artichoke dip. Husband even ate 2nds which is very rare. I did only change recipe from others reviews by doing 3/4 cup total of half mayo and half sour cream bc i didn’t want it to turn out greasy and taste it. I cut up a large chicken breast into 4 so it would cook in a reasonable amount of time. I never cooked artichoke before so I cheated and bought can artichoke that was quartered already and drained it. It was delicious and I will make again and pass recipe along

Super fantastic! I made some adjustments just due to my preferences and recommendations, I sautéed onions and fresh mushrooms to add to the mixture. I also used marinated artichokes. I used half mayo and half sour cream. I topped with mozzarella and provolone cheese since I had it and needed to use it.  Definitely will be making this again. Think I will add spinach next time. This would definitely go great over egg noodles as some have suggested.

Well, I followed the recipe plus a couple of tweaks (real garlic, a bit of paprika).  It was bland.  It was edible, but not anything like the rave reviews.

OMG, This was phenomenal!!!!!!
My hubby loved this, and is in my rotation for sure.

For the cheese mixture, I did half mayo (cains) and half sour cream... with the Parmesan.  I bought a marinated jar of artichoke hearts.  Adds a lot of flavor to the sauce.

After mixing the cheese mixture well,  I added some capers, (about 2 TBLspoons, sautéed (1) small vidalia onion, and button mushrooms to the mixed cheese sauce. 

 Sprinkled the chicken breasts with some paprika.

I cooked it covered to keep it moist.

Served with a side salad and white rice.

Yum Yum!!!!!

Awesome recipe as is but this time I wanted to get rid of stuff in my fridge and so I entirely substituted the mayo for french onion dip.  Maybe even better than the original recipe! 

So, don't be afraid to substitute refrigerated dips for the mayo!

This was delicious! I will make it again but next time I'm going to try chicken tenders instead of breasts. I think the breasts were too big and the ratio of chicken to artichoke topping was not unequal. I also had added about 1/4 cup of spinach to the artichoke mixture and it was very tasty.

I liked this very much. I used light mayo and that was fine. I didn't have any rice so made it with couscous. Delicious. I'm going to try the half sour cream next time.

I went out on a limb and made this for a dinner party. Knowing my daughter and I both love artichokes. It was delicious and easy to make. I paired it with crinkle cut steamed carrots glazed in a light dill , lemon and honey sauce. And a beet, asparagus and cherry tomato salad. Will make this quick dish again.

Definitely use marinated artichokes. It adds a lot to the dish.  I used 1/2 sour cream 1/2 mayo, added minced garlic and 1/2 teaspoon dry rub seasoning.  My husband went back for seconds!!

This was okay, but the mayonnaise was overpowering (and I used only 2/3 of what was called for). I recommend mixing the mayo with cream cheese or sour cream.

This recipe is awesome!  I pretty much stuck to the recipe except for reducing the mayo to 1/4 cup and adding 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I also added a bit more parmesan cheese but I do that on all recipes that ask for parmesan.  I will absolutely be making this recipe again and will add it to our regular line up.  Next time I make it I will double it because it was just as good as leftovers.  Thank you for such a great recipe!

Made this last night and it's a keeper! Adjusted ingredients for two breasts. I cut my breasts in half lengthwise, used 1/ 4 cup each mayo and light sour cream, heaping 1/4 cup parm and 1/2 12 oz jar of marinated artichoke hearts, and didn't squeeze the juice out of them. Added garlic powder and shook some Montreal Steak seasoning and panko crumbs on top, too.  Baked about 35 minutes at 375. Served with jasmine rice and fresh green beans. Delicious! Thank you for a great recipe!

This is a definite do-over at our home.  Great flavor, very tender & easy.  There's plenty of the  artichoke/cheese mixture for 5 or 6 chicken breasts.   The cheese has sufficient salt in it, so no additional salt was needed.  I didn't change the recipe at all - it sounded great the way it was written, & it was.

Very easy to make with excellent results! My husband said it was delicious.  I did not tell him there were artichoke hearts in it before he tasted it.  He was convinced how great it was served over rice.

I like others had a lot watery of juice ,i expected more of a creamy sauce, could be that i used frozen  chicken, but i did defrost it completely and squeezed the artichokes after draining as some one said to do. I was disappointed as i am looking for some good one dish company recipes. I did change the topping to 1/2 mayo 1/2 greek yogurt as someone suggested also.

I made this for Father's Day, as we had  a small crowd. Read every single review and thank you all, as it helped me to tweak this until I was happy. I put the artichokes on a paper towel and squeezed-perfect! So then...I used the mayo as written, but added a half can of cream of mushroom soup and a tablespoon of bottled ranch dressing,plus some water until it was the consistency I wanted. I added the parmesan, with the addition of shredded colby-pepper jack.  Then I added seasoned salt, dill, parsley and garlic powder to taste. I pre-cooked the chicken but not to brown, just  until done.  Once assembled, I sprinkled it with parmesan cheese and liberally with seasoned panko breadcrumbs. Baked it for forty two minutes, until golden brown  and served it with artisan rolls with fresh butter and a salad with ranch and dried cranberries and other goodies. It was just great! We ALL loved it and it has been requested again.

Made with spinach, mushrooms, & caramelized onions per other suggestions.  Used 1/2 lite mayo & half lite sour cream.  Very moist chicken! Company worthy!

I made this last night for my husband who loves artichokes and he loved it!  I did a few of the suggestions (1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream and some cayenne as well as giving the garlic a saute in butter before adding them to the sauce).  I don't care for artichokes or I would have given this a 5 as my husband LOVED it!  He was still talking about it this morning!  I will definitely make it again for him.

Very good.  I took the advice from other posts and added a dash of Worchestershire and a dash of Tabasco.  Since I'm a lover of all things Southwestern, I also added a can of diced green chilis.   Loved the flavor, and the chicken was perfectly cooked but moist.  Will make again for sure.

The title of this recipe states:  "most flavorful chicken you will have in your life".  Lies! 

I really wanted to like this because of all the great reviews.  I followed the recipe as is and honestly, it tasted like artichoke dip spread on boring chicken.  I LOVE artichoke dip.  But eating it over chicken was not the way to go.  I do not recommend and I won't be making this ever again.

I followed the base recipe exactly and followed one of the reviews where the chicken was placed on a bed of spinach with sautéed onions and mushrooms.  It was excellent and hubby said it is a repeat recipe.  The one thing I would do is pound my chicken to tenderize it a bit, but not making it to thin.

This was a nice change up to baked chicken.  I will definitely make it again.  Artichokes are one of my new found culinary loves.  Though, I wish I could find something a bit healthier to use instead of mayo.

I love this recipe!  It's easy and the kids live it. I've made it a million times but the last time I added a bag of frozen broccoli. I also cut half of the mayo and use half a cup of greek yogurt.

I thinly sliced 3 potatoes and put them on the bottom of the pan.  I also added some oregano and lemon to the potatoes and chicken before topping with the artichoke mixture.  Overall, very good.

This came out really good, although it would almost be better as a chicken casserole with the chicken cubed into small pieces so the flavor could mix into the chicken. With the artichoke topping on top, the chicken itself was a bit bland. That's the reason for 4 stars vs 5. But the topping was incredible!! I added mushrooms and only put in a tiny bit of mayo. I subbed the rest of the mayo with some sour cream and cottage cheese puréed into a smooth mixture. It really was delicious!

I made no changes, but just didn't like this.  It ended up very greasy, because of the mayo I guess?  I usually love anything with artichokes, but I guess I didn't like the mayo/cheese combo.

LOVED THIS CHICKEN!! I used half mayo, half sour cream based on other reviews. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. So good!!!! Chicken was moist and tender. Hubby said wow after his first bite. Will definitely make this again!

Super easy to prepare on a weeknight. I substituted non-fat Greek yogurt for part of the mayonnaise to make it a little healthier. The recipe calls for chicken breasts but I'm sure it would work just fine with thighs as well. I will definitely be making this again.

A simple and delicious dish that can feed the family inexpensively. 
I used chicken quarters as they were on sale. I added chopped yellow onion which made the sauce that much better. I also used light mayo which kept the sauce from becoming greasy as some have said. If I'd had more time I would have deboned and marinated the chicken. Next time I plan to add mushrooms, green onion, dill and bake the chicken on a bed of wild rice or stuffing

This was pretty good but it needs something. I always like to try a recipe exactly like it reads the first time. I think next time I will take other reviewer's suggestions and us half sour cream and half mayonnaise.

This was really tasty. I lined my baking dish with spinach as a reviewer suggested, and added some of the artichoke marinade, but it was still too much liquid. I will try it again using less or no liquid. It's still a keeper!

Very good! I did do the 1/2 sour cream 1/2 mayo that many others suggested and used marinated artichoke hearts but otherwise left as is. I think it would have been too oily/mayonnaise-y if the change hadn't been made. I served it with roasted asparagus which was a good accompaniment.

Cooked on bed of spinach. Used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream. Used chopped garlic and pepper instead of garlic pepper. Added carmelized onions on top of chicken, then bread crumbs mixed with cayenne on top of artichoke mixture.

Did not like this.  While it sounded fabulous (although I was a little worried about the taste of the mayo), I did not like this dish at all.  I like mayo on my sandwiches however, this was just way too much.  Yuck.

no real changes- accidently got sidetracked and didn't hear the timer. Still tasted amazing! Used reg. mayo, didn't have garlic pepper so I salted and peppered the chick and added minced garlic to the artichoke mixture- superb in my opinion.

This was amazing.  I was a little concerned that this would not have any flavor, but it was very good.  My only change would be to make more of the sauce next time as my family likes to swirl the chicken in it.  I also would cut the chicken in smaller pieces too,  I did as another reviewer said to do which was to cut the chicken in strips.  Overall a fast easy recipe that you could prepare at a moments notice.  I may try adding some spinach or mushrooms just to add some more color.  A great dish all on its own and I highly suggest you try it.  My grandson even ate it which is a miracle.

I used both sour cream and mayonnaise and mozzarella cheese.   This was the best chicken I've ever made.  Will make again!

Should have read other reviews before I made it. All we could taste was mayo. Will find a different recipe next time.

This was a delicious hit with my family!  I carmelized  onions  and crumbled  bacon on a bag full of baby spinach before placing  the chicken on top..  I may double the spinach next time because it almost disappeared after baking.  I will be making this again soon!

If you like artichoke dip, you will like this.  For mayonnaise I sub a mixture of sour cream and yogurt (I use a honey vanilla greek yogurt by Greek Gods) and I Love It!  I usually double the recipe to serve over rice or noodles (or as a dip!!!).

I made this recipe exactly as stated except the garlic pepper (I didn't have it) and I used 3 chicken breasts instead of 4. I used a pinch or garlic powder, pinch of pepper, and pinch of salt to replace the garlic pepper.  I used 3 organic skinless boneless chicken breasts. As far as flavor, the artichoke topping on the chicken is AWESOME. However, eaten as a whole, I wanted more salt on mine. Following the baking instructions, my chicken turned out rubbery and stringy. The only way to make it palatable for me was to shred it and mix it with rice. My 3 year old LOVED this, and she can be very picky. So, I consider it a good recipe. However, in the future I will either bake the chicken at 450 for 15-20 minutes alone and then add the topping and broil it for 5 minutes or so. Or, I will cook the chicken in a pan till almost done then pop it in the oven on broil with the artichoke topping.

I made it with the suggested substitute of 1/2 sour cream for 1/2 the mayonnaise.  We thought it was OK but nothing special.

I give this 5 stars for how easy it was but I thought the flavor was just okay. Good for when you need a fast easy recipe. Everyone said they liked it. I just didn't think it had the wow factor.  Serve with rice and a veggie.

This is excellent as is but I added some sun-dried tomatoes for some color and a little extra flavor.  Amazing!  I thought the dish would be really rich with the mayonnaise but it really isn't.  I used boneless chicken breasts but at 12oz each, I had to increase the baking time to 45 minutes.

This was so delicious and easy to make.  In my opinion, It does not need sour cream! I used Helman's mayo and I used marinated artichokes like others suggested which absolutely made a difference. I drained the artichokes but there was still some liquid in the bottom so will have to do a better job of making sure they are very dry next time. The chicken was very moist. I added jarred sliced mushrooms drained and last ten minutes of baking topped with fried onions. My husbands loved it. It is a very flavorful dish and will definitely be making again!

OMG soooo good. I’ve made an artichoke dip which is the same ingredients as this topper for chicken. Never thought to place it over chicken. So quick and easy and delicious. Served it over brown rice along w steamed broccoli.

I have been making this recipe for well over a year and it's about time I comment on it. My husband requests it constantly. The flavor of the artichokes is strong and so lovely. We don't change anything, besides using a little less mayo and leaving out the garlic pepper (it's amazing with or without). We have tried numerous other recipes with artichokes and can find none that have that lovely bold flavor. Most recipes tend to cook out the flavor of the artichokes but not this one.

I took the other reviewers advice and subbed the mayo with sour cream. I also added some shrimp into the topping to make it similar to a dish I had at a nearby restaurant. It is one of my absolute favorite recipes!

This was delicious!  The chicken was moist and flavorful--I used the thin fillets and added lemon pepper and garlic powder to the chicken prior to topping it with the artichoke mixture.  We will definitely make this again!

When I took this out of the oven the chicken was still pink. I had to increase the cooking time. I also cut up and added sun dried tomatoes to the artichoke mixture, yet somehow the flavor was still lacking.

Delicious as written!  Try it like this and then adjust to your liking.  I've added swiss cheese a few times - very good!  I've mixed half mayo/half sour cream as others have suggested - also very good.  I've used both plain and marinated artichokes and I do like the marinated better.  However you make it, use this base recipe as your guide and you can't go wrong!

I have prepared this  many times and passed the recipe on to my daughter. I use half Greek yogurt in the mayonnaise with a little squeeze of lemon. We never tire of this dish. It is so tasty.
It is wonderful with a Greek salad.

This was delicious!! I did change a few things.....used light sour cream and spinach dip (like tostitos dip) instead of mayo, added shredded parmesan as well as grated (we love cheese!!),  added a sprinkle of panko and Italian bread crumbs on top before baking. WOW!!! It was soo good....I am by no means a gourmet chef  and my boyfriend commented numerous times that this was the best thing I've ever made......and it was super easy!!!!  I will definitely be making this again :-)

A lot of people commented that they substituted 1/2 the mayo for sour cream which is probably good but I never have. I love this dish just the way it is, but today I'm adding 1/8C capers and 1/2C sundried tomatoes. I'll let you know how it turns out. If you make it with full amount of mayoniy

I made this 2 times today. I found this quick to prepare and yummy. I don't not make as much as suggested since I live alone. 
I made one with a raw chicken breast and second with cooked shredded chicken that i had in the freezer. Both were yummy would make again 
Thank you for the recipe.. 
It is quite high in calories so will be eating much lighter tomorrow

Fabulous! I took others suggestions on half mayo and half sour cream.. added a Tbs. of minced garlic.. squeezed out water from artichokes.. used only 3 chicken breasts so more topping per breast.. Very, very good!

Yum! This quickly became a weeknight fave. For a kid-friendlier (& even quicker) option, I dump the ingredients in the food processor to create a thick, creamy sauce to spread over the chicken breasts. My kid does not like chunks of artichokes.

I loved it! I did add spinach and used half the mayo and substituted the other half with sour cream. I also had to add extra time because I used thick chicken breasts. Creamy, tangy, a little sweet. All around delicious.

Full of flavor!  I took others suggestions and made this using 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo and it came out with a wonderful flavor, and very moist chicken.  Will definitely add this to weekly dinner recipes, as it was super quick and easy to put together on a busy school/work night.  Can definitely see adding some spinach to this.

Next time I might broil it for 30 seconds just to brown.

Good recipe to make since it's easy, quick, with minimal ingredients. This recipe also offers a good change if you find yourself making the same things over and over during your busy week. I "followed" recipe but I was apprehensive that it was going to taste bland so I added a number of small cubes of cream cheese on the top before putting in the oven and then sprinkled some panko over the top. It was watery at the bottom so make sure you drain the artichokes well. I will make again and I have added the recipe to my pile.

Fantastic!  I don't like to change recipes right off the bat, but i didn't have enough (marinated) artichokes, so also added an equal amount of marinated asparagus spears.  I had to cook my chicken for almost an hour to make sure it was done. I really like this recipe because it's so easy yet the meal has a lot of flavor.  I would serve this to company and will keep the recipe.  Thanks!

I did this recipe with a twist. I added spinach, bacon, and cut how much mayo should be used. I also used mozzarella instead of parmesean. I used 2 tablespoons of mayo. After cooking the bacon, I chopped it up in bits and added it to the mixture of artichoke, spinach, and cheese. I also stuffed the chicken as well as put it on top. Finally, I used the bacon grease on the bottom of the baking pan that the chicken cooked in to give it some more flavor.

This is a good dish, I've made it twice now. The first time I found it just a tad bland (even with sufficient spices). Here is how I spruced it up and really took it to the next level!

Use half mayo & half sour cream 

Use half Parmesan and half shredded mozzarella

Add chopped baby Bella mushrooms to the mixture.

Once the mixture is on top of the chicken add chopped sun dried tomatoes (the sweetness really complements the salty dish well).

For some kick I diced fresh Serrano peppers 

sprinkle some crispy bacon to add a little crunch.

A last sprinkle of Parmesan that will crisp up nice in the broiler after baking will give it a beautiful finish.

Toss some smoked paprika on top of it all for color and a bit more subtle flavor

I like to garnish the pan around the chicken with full Bella mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes 

Fin!

Very quick and easy and most important, it was delish!  Only change I made was adding a dash of cayenne just because every dish needs a dash of cayenne.  It will definitely be in the dinner rotation.

Husband asks for this about once a week! Definitely use fresh parmesan. Made it once with Kraft pre-grated without telling anyone. My husband noticed difference on first bite.

Really simple and really delicious!  Not super healthy but there are easy substitutions you can make to make it more healthy.  10 mins prep 30-40 mins cook time - great for a weeknight quick meal that doesn't taste "quick."  Suggestions - 1) put a rack in the dish and bake the chicken on that, otherwise your chicken will be sitting in liquid by the end even if you squeeze out the artichokes.  I spooned out liquid about 2/3 way in then continued baking 2) i baked at a bit higher temp for 20-30 mins, then broiled for 2 mins to brown the top. 3)  I sprinkled some bread crumbs (panko) on to for some crunch.

This has quickly become one of my favorite easy dinners! 
I slightly alter it by doing 1/2 cup Mayo + 1/2 cup Sour Cream for (in my opinion) better flavor. I don't have garlic pepper, so I add 2 cloves of fresh garlic, and some fresh cracked pepper to taste. I also add some marinated chopped sun-dried tomatoes to the mix, and YUM!

EASY!!!  I made it exactly as the recipe was written, but I sprinkled a garlic, salt and pepper mixture I bought for steaks directly on the chicken while I made the topping.  EXCELLENT.  A keeper for sure

Super easy and very tasty!  I used the frozen artichoke hearts from Trader Joes and just defrosted them because they are amazing and I like them so much more than canned ones.  I cut the chicken in strips so there was more sauce on the surface of the chicken pieces and so it would cook quickly.  My 6 and 9 year olds helped make this dish it was that easy!  The entire family loved it,  will definitely be making this again. I love how I usually have most of the ingredients on hand so it's a good last minute dinner idea.

This was truly wonderful.  The only change I made was to add minced garlic (the kind in a jar).  It is very rich and looks just like the photo attached to the recipe.  Good enough for company and was a snap to make.

The only change I made, was that I used a jar of grilled, marinated artichokes (which I drained and rinsed) because that's what I had on hand. I also halved the recipe since I cook for one. It was fabulous!! Quick. Easy. Looked exactly like the picture. Can't wait to make it again.

DELICIOUS!  Definitely a KEEPER!  I'll be making this often and it's definitely company-worthy.  

I used marinated artichokes, and added bacon as per another review.  Only had 1/4 cup of shaved Parmesan cheese on hand which concerned me, but it turned out not to be a problem.  Also, did not have garlic-pepper on hand - never even heard of it - so I added 1 tsp of garlic powder and 1/4 tsp of pepper.

I didn't tell my husband what I was making.  He took a bite and after a few chomps on his food, he  sat straight up and froze for a sec, then said, "ARTICHOKES!"  He was quite delighted and cleaned his plate.  =D

I served the chicken over a bed of buttered egg noodles with a side of steamed broccoli.  It was excellent!

used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo...it was still way too rich and heavy for hubby and I....If I could think of a way to tweak it more, I may make it as a cracker dip/spread.

This was excellent.  I added some capers to the mayo mixture, and browned the chicken first.  I baked for only 15 minutes for 3 thin breasts, but broiled for an additional 5 minutes to get the top nice and browned.  A keeper!

It hardly seems fair to rate and review a recipe that I have adapted so much, but! It is such a fantastic inspiration and starting point for a meal that has become a family favorite that I do hope you will try it as it is written or with your own special twists.
I followed Jim's advice and do a bed of caramelized onions and mushrooms on the bottom of the baking dish. I also substitute the mayo with Greek yogurt and 2 TBSP of extra virgin olive oil, add the juice from half a lemon, a whole bunch of crushed garlic cloves, and thyme to the sauce and bake as directed. I serve this lovely symphony over the top of fresh baby spinach.
TRY IT! It's a dish fit for company and kings!! Do Amanda's original or any of the multitude of other suggestions here. This is truly a spectacular dish.

Made it with fresh garlic, sour cream, marinated artichokes and egg noodles as other suggested and this was a win! Very easy to make and very delicious. I would just make more of the artichoke topping next time to fully coat the chicken, since the chicken tastes a little bland without a good heap of the topping to go with.

Made it last evening for dinner.  Was absolutely delicious! But I love artichokes!  I knew I was going to like this as it has the same ingredients as a dip I make.  I used mayo just as it called for (do not use low fat when cooking with mayo).  I diced a little roasted red pepper to mix in for color.  After baking 40 minutes I placed in the broiler for 2 minutes and sprinkled on some finely chopped green pepper stems for color.  I will definitely be making this again and agree it would work well for company.  I served with Indian green beans.

I made this as written except I used garlic powder instead of garlic pepper. I used Hellman's mayo and it was delicious. The only thing I'll do differently next time is pound the chicken breasts. Great recipe!

I will definitely cut the amount of mayo in half if I make this dish again. I too used marinated artichoke hearts and it was quite tasty. I also needed to broil the top for a minute to brown the top.

My mom made a similar dish about 20 years ago and I LOVED it. I had been trying to find the recipe for a few years, and this one is pretty close! Even my incredibly picky eater devoured it, I just had to be sure there were no artichokes on his.

We loved it.  Very easy.  I made a few changes.  I used 1/2 c sour cream and 1/4 c mayo for the mayo.  I didn't have marinated artichoke hearts so I added some chopped red and green peppers and some chopped onion.  It was very flavorful.

I couldn't make this and not add garlic so I chopped up a bit of onion, garlic and peppers and added it into the mix. Instead of topping the chicken breasts I cut pockets into them and sort of stuffed the filling in. I used a bit of mayo but also a bit of natural Greek yogurt which I like to substitute when I can. I would only ever use the jarred artichokes for this.. for what you get in the end there is no reason to go through the hassles of cutting out the fresh hearts and the jarred ones add to the flavour anyways.

Very yummy and I'll definitely make it again.

This is really, really easy to make and it kind of tastes phenomenal.  I added mushrooms and used Adobo instead of garlic pepper because I didn't have any, but all in all, this was really good.

Really good and so easy to make!  Added some garlic powder to mix in addition to garlic cloves.  Might try to mix some cream cheese in next time and cut down on mayo.

I used frozen artichokes (defrosted & drained) and a combination of mayonnaise & sour cream. Very easy to make, tender & tasty.

Awesome!  Really easy recipe to prepare. I served it with steamed broccoli and angel hair pasta. Really rich flavor...  Not something 'Lite' but when you are in the mood for something hearty. Yum!!!!

Really good, but some modifications.  Used half of the mayo called for in the recipe and subbed sour cream for the other half.  Also used marinated artichokes, which I don't think come in as large of a can as the regular artichokes.  Nice, quick weeknight recipe!

Loved this. I followed other reviews and split mayo in half and added half sour cream. It was delicious. I used olive oil mayo to cut some of the fat and couldn't tell the difference

Marinated artichokes is the way to go. We bake it on a bed of rice. It takes longer to cook but it was a big winner.

Very Good.  I think a lot of the water in the pan is juices from the chicken.  I just drained some out before the chicken was done and put it back in the oven.  Nice change to chicken breast will definitely make again.  Great recipe.
Thanks

I will definitely make this one of my go-to dishes, it was fabulous! I made one addition per other reviewers' suggestions: I added bacon (5 pieces, which was what I had on hand) and it was fantastic! My husband described this as "stupendous" and I couldn't agree more! Also per other reviewers, I made sure to squeeze as much water out of the artichokes as I could before combining them with the other topping ingredients. Don't skip that step! Give this recipe a try, you won't be disappointed.

This really was delicious. I did add a sprinkling of panko breadcrumbs on top before baking because I wanted a little crunch.  The flavor was outstanding, just like the artichoke dip you get in restaurants.

I made this with the modification suggested by other reviewers, of using half mayo/half sour cream instead of all mayo. I used light sour cream to reduce the calories, and it turned out delicious. It's like having a yummy hot artichoke dip spooned over baked chicken. I used marinated artichoke hearts which gave great flavor. There was a good amount of artichoke sauce for topping four chicken breasts, they all had a generous amount of topping.

My family really enjoyed this chicken dish. I made a couple of changes: I substituted sour cream for the mayo (my daughter is allergic to egg) and added a couple tablespoons of Italian bread crumb (the mixture looked a little too loose ). I will be making this again soon! Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely Fabulous!!  I also used marinated artichoke hearts and squeezed out the excess marinate before chopping.  I addition, I used 1 cup of plain Greek yogurt instead of the mayo or sour cream to help make it a little more healthy.  Fresh ground salt and peppered the chicken before topping with the mixture, and added about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder to artichoke mixture instead of garlic pepper.   I also added about 1 cup fresh chopped spinach. Extremely quick and easy to make. Will definitely be my new fav!

A super-easy recipe.  I pretty much followed the recipe as written. I did season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and garlic powder before topping with the artichoke mixture.  My chicken breasts may have been thicker than usual as well. It took about 45 minutes to get done.  The family loved it though!

I've made this several times and it has never disappointed.  Super easy and just seems a little fancier than a typical baked chicken.  I used jarred artichoke hearts instead of the canned.  I also didn't have any garlic pepper but it still turned out great.  I am sure it would also be good with 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream or Greek yogurt instead as some others have suggested.

I followed the recipe, and we both loved it.  Not sure if using a jar of marinated artichokes in garlic made a difference, but this recipe was outrageous.  I think next time I will puree the artichoke mixture in the Vitamix for a creamy smooth texture, then and add a little chopped parsley, and extra pepper.

This is a keeper, family loved it! Made the modifications others suggested - adding sautéed onions and mushrooms w/garlic; instead of mayo, used half sour creme&half miracle whip. I used marinated artichokes    I used chicken tenders. This came out beautiful,  fully cooked in the alloted time of  30 minutes.

Used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts.  Topped with breadcrumbs (more for presentation than flavor).  Incredibly easy and everyone loved it!

Made the recipe as is.  Quite tasty!  I used marinated artichokes and squeezed as much liquid as I could get out of them (they hold quite a bit).  There was just a bit of liquid in the pan, which I discarded and served the chicken over a bed of rice.  I also sliced the breasts into strips so that they would cook quicker.  Would make this recipe again!

AMAZING! The whole family loved it! The only things I did differently were using the marinated artichoke hearts (and squeezing them to remove excess water), and using 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo. I salted/peppered the chicken breasts before applying the artichoke mixture. The end result was tender, moist chicken with out-of-this-world flavor! Will be making again and again!

This dish is  great! I did add garlic and a few red pepper flakes also I did not have sour cream so I added 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/4 cup of ricotta. I did sauté the chicken in the artichoke juice and added salt and pepper to flavor the chicken a bit. I also will try with goats cheese.

Tastey! Super Easy! My tip, squeeze the water out of the artichokes otherwise the nice creamy sauce will become thin and watery. I used 2/4 cups  light mayo and 1/4 cups light sour cream as suggested in reviews,  but I know the recipe  with full mayo, would be just as good! I used the 3/4 cups bagged pre- shredded Parmesan cheese, mmmm.  I gave 5 stars for ease of making this recipe, someone with little skill and little time can make this and pull off a meal that will wow them.  Also 5 stars for  taste to recipe as written,   for the ease of making it, and the  few inexpensive easy to get type of  ingredients from any store. For such an easy recipe it is really good. No reason to buy frozen, or ready made meals, or buy from a drive through when you have this quick recipes like this on hand. I look for easy recipes as we do not dine out nearly as often,  and cook 99 percent of all meals at home. So if you are busy try this one. I added some red chilli peppers on mine for a little kick, and  a sprinkle of black freshly ground pepper. My husband loved it. I squeezed the water out if the artichokes to keep the water down in the cream sauce. I used dehydrated garlic and garlic power, and freshly ground pepper as that is what I have on hand. The only thing I added was some sautéed mushrooms because I love them in a creamy sauce with chicken,  and we don't often get to eat a creamy sauce like this one. I used chicken thighs cut up. Pretty much all the same as original ingredients, j

Loved it and my husband did too. Didn't have garlic pepper so used garlic powder instead, tasted delicious. I also added black pepper and a little salt. Everyone thing else I did exactly to the recipe. Mayo was fine, didn't need sourcream. And non-marinated artichokes were great too. Thank you!

amazing!!!
I replaced half the mayonnaise for low fat Greek yogurt and grated extra fresh parmasan cheese to make a tasty crust.  I ended the cooking time with a round of broiling to make everything a nice golden brown.  An incredibly easy recipe that impressed my husband and mother in law.  This is definitely going in my regular recipes.

Love this recipe first time making it and turned out amazing. I looked at other reviews and put 1/2 Mayo and 1/2 sour Cree. I found that was a bit watery, probably because I didn't pat the artichokes dry I just strained. Still turned out amazing! Will make again!!!

I added crushed Parmesan croutons on the top to add a tasty crunch, plus I added lots of pepper, garlic powder and greek seasoning to the Mayo mix. I used Krafts Parmesan, Romano Asiago cheese. I baked for about 45 minutes to get a good browning effect on the croutons, I cant imagine making this without a tasty crunch on top but it was great!

This was good.  Basically it was an artichoke dip on top of chicken.   I doubled it to feed my larger family, and didn't have enough artichokes, so I used a package of well-drained (cooked) spinach.   Yummo.  Also, to finish, I transferred the chicken to a new dish (to rid it of the liquid), and cooked for another 7 minutes.  Worked well.  Let it sit for a few minutes before serving.  That helps with any mushiness.

I made it with chopped garlic, pepper, 2 heaping spoon fulls of mayo (because I wanted just enough for the artichoke to stick but not make it too creamy) and crumbled cooked turkey bacon. I also sprinkled seasoned bread crumbs and parmesan  on top for crisp and cooked and extra 5 minutes. It was delicious and my family loved it! Definitely adding it to my monthly mix. Thanks!

I added a few steps but it greatly added to the flavor.  I first sautéed the artichoke with a tablespoon of garlic and shallots with butter for about 30 seconds.  I also added roasted red and scallions.  I then put them in a mixing bowl and mixed with a little mayo, sour cream, Dijon mustard, and Feta cheese in addition to the Parmesan and garlic pepper in the recipe.  After topping the chicken I also sprinkled with panko bread crumbs.  I baked the chicken for 30 min., then turned on the broiler and finished under the broiler for 4 min. creating a toasted brown crunch over the juicy chicken.  

I know this is a lot of adaptation it came out great!  I highly recommend it.

LOVE this, as does my family. However I do change it up a bit. Like others have recommended, I do half mayo and half sour cream. I also make sure to chop up the artichokes really well before mixing in. REALLY good

Only made 2 breasts with the whole topping amount.  Did 1/4 cup light mayo, 1/4 cup sour cream. Everything else was the same.  I ended up with big globs of topping on my chicken and it was the perfect amount to taste the chicken and artichokes. I wonder how much the rating depends on the quality of marinated artichokes. Mine are not a very salty brand so it worked out well.

I made this, with the half light Miracle Whip and half light sour cream.  I was careful to season the chicken breasts, so the flavor was well-balanced but not wonderful.  It wasn't the amazing experience I was hoping for.  Perhaps the marinated artichoke hearts would have been better.  I will make this again, and I will try using regular mayo to see if I can get a deeper flavor array.

This was very good. I ran out of mayonnaise trying to make it so I filled what I didn't have with Greek yogurt. It was full of flavor. I will be making this again.

This was SO GOOD. I made it over pasta and used shredded parm and butter and it was a perfect dinner for two with plenty of leftovers. Next time I would make extra artichoke mix to also cover the pasta because it was THAT tasty. May also sub some sour cream as others have mentioned to cut down on oil and calories but all in all we were very satisfied!

I made this exactly as written. I wouldn't change a thing, as it was delicious, and the chicken was very tender. I served it with rice, and a salad. The dinner was yummy, flavorful, and REALLY easy to prepare. I'm going to try this topping on fish, too. Thanks for an easy, delightful recipe.!

My chicken took a lot longer than 30 minutes to cook. Next time, I think I'll pan sear the chicken first and then put it in the dish. That way it will have a nice crust and have a better chance of baking all the way through before the topping is done!

Did half sour cream and half mayo. Did notice there was some liquid -- not really a sauce -- under the topping after cooking. Will squeeze chokes with a towel or will sauté them first next time.

This Chicken is so delicious I did use half mayo and half sour cream as suggested by another review but left everything else as is. Also sprinkled a little paprika on top just for color so so so yummy. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this with mayo and sour cream.  I also used the marinated artichokes. Overall the family liked it.  I tasted a slight tang that didn't thrill me.  Although I like marinated artichokes,  perhaps with the mayo and sour cream, it seemed I liked the idea of this recipe more than the actual execution. Still,  was good enough to re-visit and try again.

I doubled the amount of artichoke, added a tiny bit of spinach, and used light mayo. Turned out pretty good! Easy to follow recipe, few ingredients, cooks quickly.

I thought the texture was very one-noted, very much like the taste. Needs something for a crunch. That being said it is basically hot artichoke dip on chicken. I'd say it's missing some roasted red peppers and green chilies.

This was great!  I used freshly grated parmesan cheese and freshly pressed garlic (3 cloves) in the mayo/artichoke mixture.  The fresh parmesan gave it a LOT of flavor, more so than the prepackaged stuff on the shelf.  The fresh garlic also adds more flavor to the dish. I served it over Jasmine Rice.  I know that others mentioned that it was too much mayo but I didn't have that issue.  I used Hellman's so maybe that's the difference?

Made it just as written and we really enjoyed it. We both wanted more of the topping so I'll scale that up next time. I plan to add some capers for a little zing.

I will say the chicken breasts came out very tender and juicy, and were perfectly cooked... but that's the only positive note. Mayonnaise was sour, Parmesean was musty, and articholes were too vinegary.

Not something I'd make again without some changes, although I don't know what that would be.  It needs something to tone down the richness.

Made this for my wife as I'm not a fan of artichokes. My wife loved it. I chopped the artichokes fairly small for my liking, and wound up loving the dish as well. I did pound my chicken breast when halved, not a fan of thick chicken. Excellent recipe, no alterations needed, timing was perfect, thanks so much!

Pretty delicious! I used half low fat mayo and half low fat sour cream. Used chicken thighs (didn't have any breasts).  I sprinkled a little red pepper flakes on top and then 2 minutes before it was done, I topped with with onion straws (the ones used in green bean casserole) and broiled. Very yummy.  I'll definitely make again.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and the chicken is good but its a little bland for my taste.  Something is missing.  I think if I make it again I will used marinated artichoke hearts, add sour cream and maybe something to make it a little spicy.

Fantastic recipe & so easy.  Didn't change anything except to use light Mayo and replacing Parmesan cheese with Romano (due to allergies).  Served over bed of Saffron long grain rice & a side of salad.  This recipe is so impressive that can be served to guests or any special occasion.  One great thing is, I always have the ingredients on hand, as for frozen boneless chicken breasts & canned artichoke hearts. Thank you so much for sharing your love of cooking with us all.

An awesome recipe! we used chicken thighs and it took much longer than 30 minutes. So be prepared for more like 45 mins - 1 hr if you're planning on using thighs.

Great, quick meal. My husband isn't a chicken eater but loves this. Just make sure you spread the mixture over the chicken easily. If you take a bite without the topping...its just plain chicken and not very tasty.

This was delicious. I tweaked it a little.  I sprinkled the chicken with a little bit of salt and Italian seasoning.  After reading reviews, I made the mix 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup mayo. I also added black pepper. Most definitely will make again!

Threw in some crushed red hots & baby spinach leaves until wilted at the end. The juices should allow you to cut back on the mayo a little.

Fiancé and I both loved it, I did add a layer of bread crumbs before putting in the oven, but followed the rest of the recipe.

Very good recipe that was quick and easy for a weeknight dinner. Had to extend cooking time to about 35 minutes as it was still a bit pink at 25 minutes when I cut open one of the pieces. I added some cayenne pepper into the artichoke mixture to give it a kick and also some chopped green onions for  added color and flavor. If you've ever had the artichoke dip that is very popular, this is basically that on top of your cooked chicken breast. Served it with the Orzo and roasted vegetables recipe I found on here and it was a nice accompaniment to this entree.

This was really good, and I didn't find it to be too rich as other reviewers commented. I did use marinated artichokes and used a bit more than the recipe called for. I also used a mix of low fat sour cream and mayo and it turned out great. Total bake time was 40 minutes with four large breasts. I will definitely make this dish again as it was a big hit with my family.

I loved how easy this was to make, and everyone enjoyed the flavor.  Kind of like artichoke dip with chicken.   I did, however, make two adjustment that did not work: I cubed the raw chicken, and I added fresh spinach to the bottom of the dish as another reviewer had. The problem was with the increased surface area of the chicken and likely the addition of the fresh spinach,  too much juice was released, so there was about 1/4 of watery mess in the bottom of the pan.  The spinach just looked unappetizing.  I would do this again, but I would precook the cubes, and I would add a package of frozen chopped spinach (thawed and squeezed dry) to the artichoke mayo mix.  This is a definite flavor feast if you like artichokes dip!

This was rich, yummy and melt in your mouth delish as well as beautiful presentation... as there were only 2 of us for dinner, halved recipe and cut the 2 chicken breasts in half - -  there still would have been plenty for 4 servings.  Served with roasted potatoes and asparagus.  As others suggested, used chopped marinated artichoke hearts and half mayo/half sour cream.  Next day made creamy soup with the extra potatoes, asparagus and the chicken - was really good use of leftovers!

Yum! I added a few spices to my mixture (oregano, chili flakes, paprika). My chicken took closer to 45 mins to be fully cooked.

I made this recipe exactly as directed and it was fabulous. No changes necessary. What I hate on this site are the reviewers who rate the recipe based upon the changes that they made. Honestly, if this site has an administrator they should eliminate all of those reviews where the recipe has been completely altered by some well meaning wannabe chef, who should just submit their own recipe. I know I'm not alone here.

This was very good! I am not a big fan of chicken breast, as it always seems to be dry and bland no matter what I do. The chicken was very tender and there was a lot of flavor. I pounded the chicken a little bit and put salt and pepper on before putting the artichoke mixture on the top. I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 plain greek yogurt (to save some fat and calories) and fresh, minced garlic and cracked pepper. I also sprinkled Italian bread crumbs on the top and put under the broiler for 5 minutes after baking. Definitely drain and pat dry the artichokes, otherwise you can get a lot of liquid after baking. I am going to try to carmelize some onions and add it to the mix next time. Thanks for sharing!

Like others I made some changes: 1/2 c olive oil mayo, 1/2 fat free plain Greek yogurt instead of 3/4 mayo. 2/3 c Parmesan & 1/4 c feta instead of all Parm.  I added 3 cloves of minced garlic to mix and directly generously sprinkled the garlic pepper to chicken. I used the artichoke hearts in water.  I also sprinkled 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper over the top & sprinkled paprika over the top to give it more zing.  Turned out FANTASTIC!!  I served over a bed of brown rice & baby spinach. Can't wait to make it again!

This is so good! It might be the best recipe I have tried from this site and I have tried many.  Chicken was very juicy. Artichoke sauce is so flavorful. Served it with rice and brussel sprouts. Will make often. Thanks for sharing.

Really yummy and super simple. I took the advice of other reviews and swapped some of the mayo for sour cream, the mayo combined with the juiciness of the artichokes resulted in needing to drain the dish after cooking so I will most likely use only sour cream next time. I also cooked it a little longer than called for to try and crisp up some of the top. It's a really great base recipe and I will be using it again for the whole family.

Really enjoyed this recipe. Very easy.  I used a red pepper, garlic salt, parsley  and cut up a string cheese of mozzarella into the mix.  I would definitely make it again,  but I think I'll try it with marinated artichoke hearts like some other reviewers.  My husband absolutely loved this recipe.

This was really good!  
The changes I made, based on reading reviews: 
-Use half mayo & half sour cream; 
-Add some of the artichoke marinade to the mix;
-Add a carton of chopped cremini mushrooms and half a container of french fried onions;
-Put a fresh bag of spinach on top of the chicken (cover w/ foil while cooking to steam the spinach)
Thanks for sharing! (& thanks everyone for commenting with your changes - it always helps!) :-)

Healthy Changes with fantastic results. I replaced the Mayo with Plain Yogurt and added about 4 shakes of Grill Mates Montreal Chicken Seasoning - left everything else as written baked for 50 minutes. My husband loved it and it was only after he raved that I shared that I used yogurt. Will definitely make this again.

When prepared following the posted recipe, this dish is almost inedible. The fact that I was able to choke down one of the chicken breasts earned it 2 stars instead of 1. To be fair, I guess I should've read the comments first to see that most people subbed sour cream for some of the mayo.
As it's written, the name of this recipe should be changed to Hot Mayo Chicken. If eating hot mayo sounds good to you, then you should give it a shot.

I feel like the Lone Ranger on this one, but, here it goes...i made this exactly as written. The chicken turned out quite moist & that's the reason this is getting at least 1 extra star. Otherwise, my family found this chicken to be mediocre at best. Dear daughter didn't like it at all.  Won't be making again.

I used low fat mayonnaise and it was outstanding!  So delicious!  If you like artichoke dip, you will love this chicken!

It was yummy and the chicken was moist.  Next time I want to try increasing the toppings so there's more sauce.

Wow, this was really good and incredibly easy to make. I served it with some Israeli couscous. The only change I made was to add some chopped frozen bell pepper and onion mix, but it would have been good without that. Next time I think I'll add some sauteed mushrooms and perhaps some crumbled bacon. Quite tasty, even my picky son ate it all up, raving all the while.

1st time cooking with Artichokes-It was excellent! I double checked the recipe before shopping only bought "plain" not marinated (which are less expensive)canned artichokes. I followed the recipe exactly and used Hellman's mayonaise (is there any other??) I had about 1/3 parm cheese that I grated and the remaining was from my cannister.  This took a little longer to cook as my trimmed breasts were large - I also drained out the extra clear liquid from the pan just before they were done cooking. My husband, who was apprehensive about the artichoke loved it! When it came out of the oven browned and bubbly - very nice! I used garlic powder and black pepper and no salt - parmesean cheese makes it salty enough.  The chicken was so tender and juicy - the sauce rich and full of flavor - light accompaniments are all that is needed with this entree!

Delicious indeed! Per the reviews, I cut the mayo with some plain yogurt and a little Caesar dressing - fabulous!!Hubby said next time, he would like more sauce on top so I may double the recipe. Going into the rotation!

This was super easy and I will be putting this in the regular rotation. HANDS DOWN the best chicken I have ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly (except for doing half sour cream and half mayo) and the chicken was tender, juicy, and sooooo good.

This was essentially just plain chicken with amazing artichoke dip on the top. I think it would be better to use a different recipe for the chicken and then have this baked artichoke dip on the side with pita chips.

Followed some of the review suggestions, added canned chopped mushrooms. As I can't stand Parmesan, I used Mozzarella instead, and added some spices - no garlic pepper but fresh and powdered garlic, dill, oregano. I chopped to artichoke hearts and mushrooms in a food chopper, quick and easy, made the topping a nice texture. Couldn't believe how easy this was to make, how good it tasted and how quick!

This is good especially if you take some reviewers suggestions about layering spinach in bottom of dish, adding caramelized onions, red pepper flakes and bacon to the artichoke mixture.  But....it still didn't measure up to an old artichoke chicken I've been using for years that everybody loves and is often requested.  Still, this is good and would have no problem making it again just for a change.

It was completely delicious! My kids devoured it and my husband said it had to be added to our regular recipes. Like other posted, I subbed half the mayo with sour cream, and used a mix of grated and shredded parm. Added some garlic powder for a little more flavor, and it was a total winner.

Wow. This was really easy to make and came out super yummy!!! Made it as written except I didn't have garlic pepper so I used garlic powder and some black pepper.

I have to admit, when this came out of the oven it didn't look like it was going to be a hit with the family, especially with the kids! However, the taste was surprisingly good and the kids gobbled it up.  I used my Pampered Chef chopper to make sure the artichokes were chopped small enough to pass the "picky eater test" and I added fresh spinach to the bottom of the dish before baking for added greens.  I served this with brown rice and some roasted asparagus.

Very good and quick recipe.  I sauteed some onions to add to the mixture before coating the chicken.  I will try the sour cream recommendation next.

I did the half mayo/half sour cream mix.  The artichoke part tasted great, but it really didn't get through the chicken all that well.  I would like to try this again, but maybe some sort of presentation where you cut the breasts in half then butterfly them and stuff them, then panko bread... that would help with the texture issue (this is very loose and a little chewy) as well as the appearance (not very pretty to look at in this rendition -- I agree that some bread crumbs on top would be good.)  Definitely something to work with though, the artichoke/mayo/sour cream is a keeper.

Very tasty. As per other reviews, I substituted half of the mayonnaise with sour cream. Also, I used marinated artichokes, which added some flavor.

This dish was so wonderful that my husband licked his plate!  Based on other reviews, I made the following changes.  1. Used 1.5 lbs of chicken tenders, seasoned with garlic pepper, browned in light virgin olive oil to add color and to make sure chicken was cooked thoroughly  2. added 1 lb of sliced mushrooms sauteed in light olive oil seasoned with garlic pepper and onion powder  3.  substituted 1 can reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of roasted garlic mushroom soup for mayo because I don't like mayo  4. used marinated artichoke hearts  5. added frozen, baby sweet peas.  I mixed shredded parmesan cheese with the peas, artichoke hearts, soup, and a little milk in the pan with the sauteed mushrooms.  Placed the chicken in bottom of glass pan and covered with the stuff from the pan.  Served with chicken flavored rice pilaf and fresh baked french bread.  It was delicious, just wish I had used .5 lbs more chicken tenders.

I tried this recipe tonight and we both loved it.  The only reason I gave a 4 is that I changed slightly.  Based on other reviews I used 1/2 C mayo and 1/2 C light sour cream.  I also added about 3/4 cup thawed and paper towel dried spinach and diced the marinated artichoke.  I would have never even thought to try something like this if not for the recipe.  Thanks so much Amanda!

This was totally amazing.  You must use top quality mayonnaise (I always use Hellman's).  I used shaved Parmesan, not the powdered stuff in a plastic shaker bottle. I reduced the mayo by 1/3, and replaced it with sour creme.  I added 2 thinly sliced green onions and 3 strips of crumbled bacon.  Mix the topping up the night before and stored in refrigerator.  The next day, simply top the chicken breasts, and slide it in the oven!  Delicious.  I may try adding a few chopped olives next time.

I listened to other reviews and used marinated artichokes which was needed. I omitted half of the mayonnaise for sour cream and have come to this conclusion... get rid of the mayonnaise all together and use a 50/50 blend of room temp cream cheese and sour cream. I mixed minced garlic cloves in this as well. diced jalepenos would be delicious as well. I rate this 3 stars because it needs to be completely redone for a smooth creamy flavorful result.

incredible! I added more sour cream than mayo and it was an amazingly flavorful recipe. I had to keep the chicken in the oven for much longer than 30 minutes maybe about an hour because the cutlets were too thick,

Delish, the family loved it. I did use 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo as recommended by other reviews. I also just used pepper and garlic powder so season the artichoke mix and seasoned the chicken lightly with salt.

Actually, this is the first I have seen this recipe on here. I have been doing this for over a year now. I don't mix the ingredients first though. I do marinate the chicken breasts over night. Put them in a baking dish, spread mayo over the chicken breasts then add the artichokes on top. I also use two cans of artichoke hearts so there are extra.

I made it as written with the exception of using marinated artichoke hearts. It did end up a bit oily but I just drained a little. I really liked the flavor. My husband said it was OK but he doesn't care for parmesan cheese. I will likely go with part sour cream next time.

This has become one of my new favorite recipes.  I wouldn't change a thing!  It comes out very juicy and delicious!  I am not the greatest cook and I'm always looking for something new (and easy) to try.  This recipe is an absolute hit!  Super easy and very good!

Using 3-4 FRESH artichoke hearts makes a world of difference to this recipe. It's a hassle, I know.  But it's much like the difference between fresh garlic and garlic powder, which is huge.

Needs a little more flavor.  I will probably try again but add a little garlic. I drained the artichokes for quite a while but there was a lot of liquid in the end.

Okay I have not tried this yet but that is my recipe for artichoke dip that we use with bread and it is WONDERFUL.  It only makes sense that putting it on chicken would make it even better. Will be making this week.

I used half Miracle Whip Light and half sour cream instead of the mayo. It is basically chicken with artichoke dip on the top. I loved it and one of my kids loved the topping and tolerated the chicken while another loved the chicken and tolerated the topping.

Enjoyed it.  Was very moist.  I used the half sour cream and half olive oil mayo.  Also used frozen artichoke hearts and a couple of butter pats on top.  I also added some chicken broth at the end of the cooking time to make more "gravy".  I was cooking only two chicken breasts but also cooked it for about 10 more minutes than the 30 min noted in the recipe.  Will cook it again.

I used this recipe for dinner tonight, and it was delicious! Paired with a baked potato and angel hair pasta. I'm a big fan of artichoke. The sauce was a little thick for my taste, though, so I might try to thin it some next time. Also had to cook it for 35min, rather than 30. But, overall, it was great!

Wonderful! I used thinly sliced chicken breasts and covered the entire chicken in the artichoke/mayo mixture for several hours to marinate and tenderize.

I also took the advice of others and used jarred/marinated artichokes. They are more tender and flavorful than canned. 

If you use marinated artichokes, give them a rinse and use less salt than called for. Otherwise, you will have a salty mess on your hands.

Definitely wouldn't have done without substitutions.  I put more parmesan than was called for (maybe a full cup - sprinkled on the top a bit) and also changed the mayo for plain greek yogurt and it was GREAT!  I also added probably 2T of minced garlic.

I LOVED this recipe. My whole family did too!! I used thighs instead of breast though. Good alternative if your not  that fond of chicken breast.  Really tender and juicy. Awesome flavor! I made this with a side salad with spinach and artichoke with red wine vinegar and olive oil dressing. Would be really good with mash potatoes too. ??

I used 2 chicken breasts but the whole recipe for the topping.  We used all the topping!   My changes:  I used 1/2 Miracle Whip Light and 1/2 light sour cream.  I used marinated artichokes.   After topping the chicken with the artichoke topping, I sprinkled bread crumbs topped with paprika and drizzled oil over top.  It was very good and a nice change.  Next time I will try smoked paprika, a little more pepper, Italian bread crumbs, maybe a little more Parmesan cheese &  maybe some chopped jalenpenos.  Will make again!

I found, for my taste, the mayo flavor overpowered the dish. I liked the idea of the recipe. I entertain a lot, especially when the Green Bay Packers are playing, and make a hot spinach & artichoke dip. I always keep some aside for this dish. I use the same directions for baking it, but use the hot spinach & artichoke dip instead of the mayo based topping. Toss some seasoned bread crumbs on top and it steps this dish up to perfection. There are many easy recipes for the dip. Allrecipe's has the one I use, "Artichoke & Spinach Dip Restaurant Style." The ingredients are staples for me, and takes no time to throw together.

Absolutely delicious!  My family demanded that I make this on a regular basis.  I followed everything in the recipe, seasoned the chicken as well, then broiled for about 5 minutes to brown the top.

I thought with so many reviews this was going to be rather amazing. It was OKAY, but I think the flavor came from the cheese, the artichoke was hardly noticeable. There was no WOW to this dish at all, very disappointed.

Very delicious. Only added half a sauteed onion. It needs to be cooked at higher temperature though. 450° for about 50 mins.  It gets more brown on the top and cooks faster than 375°. I cooked it for 50 mins on 375,and it was still pink.

This is a great way to prepare chicken.  I did use 1/2 light mayo and 1/2 light sour cream to reduce the calories.  My adult children love it.

Quite yummy! I used marinated artichokes too, as many have suggested. The rest of the dish I prepared as written. It's a very creamy yet savory  chicken recipe that gives a lot of flavor for little effort.

Yum, we liked this chicken.  It is very simple to put together, but is really loaded with flavor.  I didn't have garlic pepper, so I used garlic salt and fresh ground pepper in its place.  The two chicken halves I used were pretty thick so I cut them in to two pieces each.  They took 40 minutes to reach the internal temp of 180°.  Served this with 'Out of the Hat Rice' and 'Airport Bob's Green Beans', both AR recipes.

We LOVED this.  It was really good.  I took the advice of everyone else and used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  To that I added a generous sprinkle of Good Seasons Italian dressing mix, some lemon pepper, two cloves of garlic and the Parmesan and chopped/drained marinated artichoke hearts.  I also added some diced red bell pepper and a couple of shakes of cayenne.

Very lightly salted the chicken and spread the mixture over all.  When there were 5 minutes left in the cooking time I sprinkled with bread crumbs, sprayed with Pam and broiled.

Seriously these were so good.  My mom could not stop exclaiming over it and eating it, and she can be picky.

This is excellent! I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream and used marinated artichoke hearts. I also added about 1 cup thawed/squeezed dry spinach to the mixture and it was so yummy! I sprinkled a little paprika on top for color and it turned out perfect--just like the main picture on the recipe. My husband loved this. It's totally a keeper!

I've been making this for years.  Basically using my MIL's artichoke dip on top of chicken.  I personally think the trick to keeping it from being so oily is to add just enough mayo to make the other ingredients "stick".  I also add garlic to give it some "umpfh".

Oh yum! We loved this, and we are not even particularly fond of artichoke. I made no changes and yes, it is very rich, but that's ok if you expect it to be. Easy recipe with a feel good factor. Good for showing off or just comfort food.

I think this is a good start but it lacks some zing!  I would sauté some onion and garlic with pancetta and add to the mayo mixture.  I love Jim F's idea about adding some spinach to the dish also. In addition, 30 mins is not long enough for most breasts these days.  I would either cut them in half or add some cooking time! Mel B

This is a winner! Made it last night and my husband loved it. I added salt, pepper and garlic powder to the mixture though. I couldn't stand the thought of mostly mayo. I also sprinkled extra Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs on the top to help it brown and finished it under the broiler.

Delicious! Came out excellent! I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I would change is to add some extra black pepper for more flavor and while it's baking sprinkle extra Parmesan cheese on top for it to crisp up a tiny bit. Will definitely make this recipe again!

I used two cans of artichokes instead of one, and I'm glad I did, because otherwise I think it would have been more like "Mayonnaise Chicken" instead. Mine needed about 10-15 more minutes in the oven than the recipe states to finish up browning the top, but still, pretty tasty and easy dinner.

This was amazing!  Per reviewers, I salt & peppered chicken (cut in strips), used half mayo, half sour cream, and added 1/4 of a packet of good seasons italian dressing.  Outstanding with rice to soak up the juices!  Rave reviews from family!

AWESOME.  easy to assemble.  tasty.  tender.  presented well. Grate your own cheese, not canned. My only issue, I needed more time in the oven, (50 to 60 min) maybe because I had them so jammed in an 8 x 8 pan or my breasts were meatier. I'm a recipe follower.  it worked, this was a bell ringer, WINNER.

I didn't find it as tasty as the other reviewers.  The flavor of the topping didn't go into the chicken and I would have preferred a little more texture variety... something crunchy on top

A dear friend gave me this exact recipe many yeas ago and I have served it to family & friends over years with many repeat requests for it. I use 1/3 cup light mayonnaise and 1/3 cup lite sour cream and have added sauteed onions & sliced mushrooms but I most often make it just as written. Why  change something that's so easy & delicious!

This recipe wasn't bad, but I went a different approach and used 3/4 cup Greek yogurt and 1/4 cup mayo. Lower the fat content a bit. I also threw in some crushed chili's to give it a lil kick.

Superb Flavor. Used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 miracle whip and marinated artichokes. I only had 12oz. Of artichokes on hand and I think the additional oz. are needed., so don't skimp on the artichokes. Used chicken tenderloins, family preference and also added some capers. Thank you for sharing.

This tastes not unlike a chicken breast topped with artichoke dip, which just so happens to be delicious.  Used half mayo and half sour cream at others suggestions. :)

This was fantastic!  Left it in the oven longer, took almost twice as long as suggested for the chicken to be done, but the artichoke mix had a wonderfully tasty and browned crust on top.  Will definitly add to my recipe box!

very good. this is the recipe I have used for 20 years only as a dip with fritos.  I used Duke's mayo and squeezed the extra marinade out of artichokes and used extra chokes as well.  5 mins before I added parm. cheese on top.  My hubby doesn't care too much for artichokes but ate an extra piece of chicken tonight (no leftovers for dinner tomorrow now!) and said I didn't think the artichokes would taste this good.  Will make again but next time I will play around with recipe.  Maybe add some bacon and bread crumbs on top.

Very good.  Used both sour cream and mayo.  Didn't have marinated artichokes- sautéed mush, butter, garlic & italian seasonings, then added that to the mix. Used garlic powder & pepper.  Served with wild rice and asparagus and make a wonderful meal!

Made this recipe with one change: I used fresh artichokes instead of canned. It was delicious. My 2 children (age 8 and 5) loved it and I actually didn't make enough. Everyone wanted seconds and all I had was 6 chicken breasts. I made garlic mashed potatoes as my side with some boiled kale. Very good.

I had only a 7.5 jar of marinated artichokes, less than 1/2 cup of light mayo, and only two pieces of chicken and a boneless piece of pork loin chop.  So, I added enough sour cream to make 3/4 cups and mixed with the 3/4 cup of Parmesan and slathered the mixture on top of the chicken and the pork chop.  The result is fabulous - chicken and the pork chop!  I will definitely be making this more often!

Easy and delicious! Made both chicken and veggie-chicken versions. Replaced half the mayo with sour cream as other reviewers advised, not sure if it was necessary. I'm not a very experienced cook so I love how easy this was.

Loved the artichoke topping...but found the chicken breast itself flavorless as the flavor did not permeate the chicken.  It would have been better I think if the topping was mixed with cubed or sliced chicken and then baked. I didn't have garlic pepper so I substituted a little garlic powder and fresh ground pepper. Adding just a hint of shredded cheddar 5 minutes before removing from oven is nice as well.  I am going to try this topping when baking mild, flaky white fish.

Loved this dish! The chicken was so moist and the flavor delicious.  I used marinated artichokes because that's what was in the pantry but otherwise I followed the recipe.  Will definitely make this on a regular basis.

So good and tasty. I took some tips from other reviews like switching out part of the mayo for sour cream, and using some minced garlic, salt, and pepper in place of the garlic pepper (since I didn't have garlic pepper). It came out absolutely divine.

Very good, and I made extra "sauce" because I wanted to be sure there was some to add to the Egg Noodles.  Made Broccoli to go with this too.  I added some bacon bits, and Panko Bread Crumbs to the top.  Used Salt, Pepper, and Garlic Powder because I didn't have Garlic Pepper, but I next time I'll skip the Salt.

UPDATE on 8/12/14: I sliced the chicken into strips, seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  Placed in greased baking dish, then sprinkled chopped ham lunchmeat all over it.  For the topping I made a little extra including adding sour cream, used regular Artichoke Hearts (not marinated), and added fresh Spinach that needed to be used up.  Spread topping all over chicken/ham and then topped it with Panko.  It was VERY Good!!!  Served with Quinoa.

This turned out very nicely. I added spinach on the bottom like other reviews suggested and I loved the taste it added. I also used 1/2 greek yogurt and 1/2 mayo, rather than all mayo. I am almost tempted to try all yogurt next time. Poured juices from the artichoke over top of the chicken as well and added bread crumbs, as suggested. Yummy!

I made this last night, substituted .5 cup of the mayo for light sour cream because my husband and I need to watch our growing waist lines...
It's excellent, really put chicken on a while different level.

My husband liked it, I thought it was OK.  Too much mayo/sourcream/cheese, even though I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup mayo.  It was easy to make but not something I'd make again.

This is a keeper!! Really good, moist, flavorful chicken is the result! The only thing different I did was substitute a little less than half of the mayo with sour cream because of another reviewer and it's WOW!! Oh and I actually substituted provolone for the Parmesan because that's all I had. Next time I'm going to try adding some chopped roasted red peppers (well drained) and some spinach to the mixture! :)

I pounded the chicken breasts with Mrs. Dash seasoning which tenderized them. This was an easy recipe that can be made ahead of time for a large crowd.

After reading the reviews, I changed it up a little.  I cut the mayo in 1/2 with sour cream, and added planko bread crumbs mixed with a little butter on top before putting in the oven.   Next time I will split the chicken in 1/2 because I had to cook it a little longer & some of the chicken was a little dry.  Other than that it was a nice change.

I used some marinated artichokes that I had on hand and substituted garlic salt and black pepper for the garlic pepper that I don't have.  I liked it and she didn't.  I may do this again if canned artichoke goes on sale.  Thanks.

I prefer using cream of mushroom soup with chicken broth instead of the mayo.  I also add salt/pepper/ garlic powder and onion powder to the soup mix for extra flavor.  Also, I use the marinated artichokes for more flavor.

Pretty darn good. I love artichokes and this recipe is simple to prepare, a must for anything I will make regularly. I decreased the mayo to 1/2 cup and used light mayo to cut some calories. I also added some crumbled bacon and sprinkled the top with paprika to make it look pretty.

I liked this a lot, but did make changes to make it healthier for us, plus did not want to waste mayo. I used 4 chick breasts, 2 T of mayo and 2 T of sour cream mixed together. I smeared the mayo/sour cream mixture over chicken and sprinkled with garlic salt/Mrs. Dash (had no garlic pepper).  Then I put Parmesan and chopped artichokes over the top and baked.

I tried the recipe because of the amount of positive reviews and it seemed easy. I made it exactly as instructed and couldn't eat it. I never hated mayonnaise before but I do not care for it after eating a few bites of this chicken. It was so salty and saturated with the mayo that I couldn't get through even one piece. Maybe try subbing some of the mayo with sour cream as another reviewer suggested. Good luck and happy cooking!

This recipe is so simple and absolutely delicious! It has become my husband's favourite! I made one small change by sprinkling the chicken with seasoned panko crumbs and then putting the artichoke mixture on top. Artichokes are now a staple in my pantry!

OK, not exceptional made as directed. Probably would have been better to make with 1/2 sour cream as other reviewers suggested. If I try this recipe again I will try it with sour cream.

I would agree all mayo is oily great with substitution of 1/2 sour cream.  This is a great week day meal easy and tasty and up for interpretation of taste will for sure make again maybe with a can of crab meat. This topping would also be wonderful on a shrimp scampi. Or spice it up with red pepper or jalapeño.

We eat a lot of chicken and I'm always looking for something new to try.  This was really good and flavorful.  The only issue was that chicken turned out a bit dry.  Definitely go by clear juices and cutting a piece open rather than time to ensure chicken is moist.

Bland Bland Bland. I do not understand the tastes of the people on this site. I liked the main ingredients so I thought, let's try it people seem to like it. I added mushrooms cooked in OO and garlic to the mix, marinated artichoke hearts, and 1/2 sour cream 1/2 mayo. I also added way more than pinch(!) of garlic pepper. I tasted it at that point and was afraid of a bland mixture. I added lots of cayenne pepper and couldn't even get a pepper kick with all of that other stuff!

I will finish this dish but I almost do not want to. I think I will need some hot sauce to drown the blandness. Maybe next time I would add seasonings directly to the chicken as well, or marinate it too as the chicken was just lacking flavor. It tasted only OK if I got a bite with some of artichokes as those had some flavor.

I couldn't help myself. First I sautéed sliced mushrooms in evoo and butter. Then I added horseradish-1 good tbsp-and capers to the mayonnaise mixture. I also added some favorite spices. I just layered the mushrooms over the chicken then spread the mayonnaise  mixture and baked. Yum!

I seasoned chicken with Morton Seasoned Salt and garlic powder. I used 1/2 the mayonnaise and the whole jar of artichokes. I also put more garlic powder and pepper in the mayonnaise mix.  Was very good.

Delicious! I read the reviews and made the following changes to the original recipe: I used boneless breasts and thighs (I like dark meat, it has more flavor); coated the chicken in flour, salt and pepper and lightly browned on both sides in EVOO and fresh garlic; used frozen artichoke hearts (a lot less salty); used half mayo/half sour cream mix; sprinkled bread crumbs on top. My daughter raved about it, asked for the recipe :)

I very much enjoyed this! I didn't really measure the mayo or parm cheese, just dumped it in a bowl with diced artichokes and spread over the chicken. I was afraid it was too dry, so I added a little water in the bottom of the pan and bakes for 50 minutes at 375! Made with yellow rice. Yum!

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  I seasoned my chicken with the garlic pepper and sea salt.  Make sure to use good quality mayo, such as Duke's or Hellman's.  I probably used about 1/2 cup mayo versus 3/4, and I added a clove of minced garlic.

This is good comfort food. I subbed in Tzatziki sauce for the mayo and mixed in a little honey too. I used my potato masher to get the artichokes nice and pulpy. I also sprinkled a little shredded asiago on top of each fillet to get a better brown on top than the parm could have done by itself. It comes out very moist and with a pleasingly tart yet mild flavor. This isn't going to beat out Chicken Piccata for my favorite chicken recipe, but I like it a lot and will probably make it again.

I wasn't impressed. I didn't feel like I was eating chicken, instead I felt like I was eating a jar of mayonnaise. If I ever made this again, I would use 2/3 greek yogurt and 1/3 mayonnaise.

I subbed sour cream for about 1/4 cup of the mayo, but hubby thought it that it was still too heavy on the mayo. Too rich. I did pound the chicken breasts flat and used some "Italian blend" cheese instead of Parmesan because that's what I had. Overall, it was really good. Next time, I'll use more sour cream (or potentially Greek yogurt) and I think we'll like this even more.

My husband and I loved this.  I would probably give it 5 stars if my kids had loved it as much.  They liked it, and it was extremely easy to make which is a huge bonus for me on weeknights.  I did alter the recipe a little by adding some swiss cheese to the mixture to make it like our favorite artichoke dip.  I will definately make it again

This was just ok, nothing special. I didn't use the marinated artichokes so maybe that was my problem. I did use 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream and we could still really taste the mayo. Not one for my recipe box.

Tried this last night with one substitution: used greek yogurt instead of mayo. The result? It worked fairly well. The yogurt did curdle, which sounds gross, but it didn't affect the look or taste of the dish. The dish was slightly more acidic than if it had been mayo, but it was not heavy or gross the way mayo can make you feel after eating in a casserole.

This is one of my best finds on this site.  And it's so amazingly simple.  I've cooked it for a quick weeknight meal and for company.  Even people who don't like artichokes rave about this when I serve it.

I loved that it was easy and quick to make.  I usually don't modify a recipe on the first time, but I had to use a jar of marinated artichoke hearts that I had on hand.  It really gave it a nice kick!  Also, Dukes Light mayo is my choice in the mix.

I browned the chicken breasts in some olive oil first as some reviewers suggested.  Served with a spinach side salad.  There were only three of us for dinner, so I have one leftover to take for lunch.  This was so easy to prepare and was a hit for all of our taste buds !  Thank you for sharing, Amanda Bibb !!

A weekly recipe at my house now.  I love the flavors in this chicken.  I do use sour cream occasionally but I think the mayo is my favorite.

Loved this recipe!  I made the following changes:  I cut the chicken in strips, used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream, both low fat, used marinated artichokes and added fresh mushrooms.  I put the chicken in a baking dish, put sliced mushrooms over the top and spread the artichoke sauce over the muchrooms and baked it for 30 min  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the chicken was slightly dry.

The entire family loves this!  I add canned spinach and some diced tomatoes to give it more veggies and color. Also, I usually end up doing the entire thing in the crock pot, mix it with spiral noodles and serve in bowls. Great dish!!

This is an excellent recipes- works equally well for a weeknight dinner or for having friends over on the weekend.  Based upon prior reviews, I was concerned about excess liquid, so I used frozen artichokes and let them defrost in a colla Der and then microwaved for 4 minutes.  I alsosubstituted half of the mayonnaise with plain yogurt in order to reduce calories.  Lastly, I added two cloves of garlic to the yogurt/mayonnaise mixture.  We used boneless skinless chicken thighs and it came out great. Next time, I may just use yogurt and forgoe the mayonnaise altogether

This just didn't do it for me.  I read the reviews and the top contributors and made all the changes and it really didnt have a great flavor.  It left me flat.  I used marinated artichoke hearts, I split the mayo and added sour cream and I added sun dried tomates as per one reviewer.  The chicken did come out nice and moist and there was alot of water in the pan as expected, but I just drained it out.  I guess it just didnt have a flavor we liked.

YUM. I followed the first review's advice by using marinated artichokes and bacon. I also added a little cream cheese (which adds to the calories). I will make this for guests next time, and I am not a casserole person.

I loved this recipe.  I added capers (2 TBSP) and also some mozzarella cheese.  I was low on mayo so added half milk.  I put the dish together in the morning and let it sit in the refrigerator all day.  Took it out an hour before putting it in the oven to bring it to room temperature.  I think this made the chicken so tender.  I will definitely make this again.

My boyfriend, who hates chicken, absolutely loved this dish.  He was actually mad that he was too full to eat a second piece.  I didn't really care for it too much, there seemed to be something off about it.  But I did eat a piece for lunch the second day and it tasted much better.  The chicken turned out very moist.  The kid, who did not like the mixture on top, took it all off and ate the chicken plain and thought it was the best chicken she ever had.  Due to the mixed reviews, I probably won't make again.

This is certainly very easy and was well-liked by my husband and son (who is 6, and picky).  For me, it was a bit lacking in complex flavor as far as chicken dishes go.  I think I have issues with it because there's so little pepper and not any other herbs.  I also used parmesan from a can.  I usually use fresh parmigiano-reggiano in Italian dishes and I didn't really care for the taste of the cheaper parm.  And finally, when chicken's not browned, grilled or broiled, you lose that savory "umami" flavor that adds so much to a dish.

This was very good and not difficult to make, but you'd better be an artichoke fan.  My husband is not and didn't like this much, but I am and it's now a favorite recipe of mine--when he's not home.

Awesome flavor!  I made this for the first time today & served it with Jasmine Rice & a side salad.  Did not like the liquid left in the dish, however, and it missed the visually appealing mark!  I'll work on that, since we eat with our eyes first!!

I thought is would be a nod to artichoke dip but it wasn't anything close, bland and lacking flavor. I used 1/2 mayonnaise and 1/2 sour cream as was suggested in the reviews.  I can't imagine it being any better with all mayonnaise though. I would not try this again unless I was to add more seasoning and was to puree the artichoke.

This is so good and easy.  I had really large chicken breasts so I cooked it longer until the temp was 160.  I used half mayo, half sour cream and I did spinkle with Paprika.  Yum

This one is definitely a favorite in our household, and my husband frequently requests it. I usually use curry powder instead of garlic pepper but otherwise make it as written. Either way, it's yummy!

This is the most delicious and addictive chicken I have ever had!  (I wish I didn't dislike low-fat mayo so much so I'd feel less guilty eating this). My only change was to use 1/4t minced garlic rather than than the garlic pepper.  Thanks for an easy and tasty recipe, Amanda!

It was good but I have to admit I was a tad disappointed. I make an artichoke dip that uses the same ingredients so I was really anticipating it to be like the dip on top of the chicken. For my personal taste the artichoke was a little too much. The family liked it so it wasn't a fail

This was really good!  I altered it slightly ... subbed nonfat plain yogurt for about two thirds of the mayo (to try to lower the fat count some), added chopped fresh spinach to the sauce, and sliced mushrooms between the chicken and sauce.  It was delicious!

This was very good, and very easy. I made it just as it's written, and served with Zucchini Alfredo. We'll have this again.

My family and I really enjoy this recipe.  I've tried it with the mayo and sour cream mixture and I've also done it with plain yogurt.  My family prefers the plain yogurt they said it tasted better and it's healthier.  I think next time I will try it with plain Greek yogurt.  Thanks for a great recipe :)

I cannot get enough of this dish!  It's incredibly simple, but really impressive.  I usually serve it with a simple salad and some fruit.

Quite good.  I used marinated artichoke hearts and it gave quite a tart flavor to the topping - my kids did not care for this taste.  Next time I may try the un-marinated variety.  I pounded out my chicken breasts to an even thickness and then based on previous reviews, I floured and browned them in olive oil, then sprinkled with paprika.  For the topping, I used 2/3 cup greek plain yogurt (may have also added to the tart flavor) and 1/3 light mayo, added a couple of minced garlic cloves and remember to squeeze out the excess juice in your artichokes.  After topping the chicken breasts with the artichoke mix, I sprinkled a thin layer of panko bread crumbs and drizzled with a teeny bit of olive oil and baked for 20 minutes (because they were thinner and pre-cooked with the browning)...

This recipe is such a lifesaver!!!  It takes basically no time to prep and the taste is AMAZING!!!  I generally use less mayo and more Parmesan with some Panko!!  I also triple the recipe because it is wonderful for leftovers!!!

Wow, I'm pleasantly surprised.  I wasn't sure how this would turn out.  It almost seemed too simple.  But it is very tasty.  As another poster mentioned, it doesn't really look too good coming out of the oven (looks very bland) but it's moist and flavorful.  I only added 1/2 cup of mayo (thought 3/4 would be just too much) and it was delicious.  I will make this again.

So easy! Nice flavor! Kids gobbled it up! I took the suggestion of broiling for a few minutes at the end of the cooking time to brown the top and that worked out great. A keeper!

Pretty good.  I followed other reviewers advice and used 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 mayo.  That worked well.  Should have followed other reviewers advice and put some bread crumbs on top--think that would have been a nice finishing touch!

My husband loved this and I thought it was good not great.  It was a little on the salty side and I didn't add any salt.  It all went though.  I used fat free sour cream and light mayo and didn't miss the calories or fat.  I'd make it again.

This is soooo good. If you have ever had hot artichoke dip and you loved it, you will love this dish. My 2 year old ate it all up in minutes she didn't touch her sides till it was gone. Great recipe and super easy, will make again and again!

I don't give 5 stars very often, but this dish is delicious AND very quick and easy.  You can change it up based on what you have available--for instance I didn't have parm, so I used pepper jack.  I've also used feta and left over kalamata olives.  The chicken is VERY moist and tender.  I don't think the mayo needs to be cut with sour cream.  I use olive oil mayo, and it turns out perfect.

YUM.  The only change I made was to use 1 clove of fresh minced garlic and ground pepper instead of the "garlic pepper".  Served it over angel hair pasta and everyone enjoyed it! Will definitely make again.

OK- so im knocking off a star because i changed it around a bit and it turned out AMAZING. first, i substituted a little over half of the mayo for light sour cream (i also used light mayo).   I added onion powder, minced garlic, and black pepper to the mixture before baking  and finally, i topped it with some plain breadcrumbs and broiled for a few minutes at the end to make them nice a browned. it looked and tasted beautiful!!

I sub half the mayo with sour cream and top with bread crumbs. I also cook pasta and serve this over the pasta. It's a rich and creamy dish. Perfect comfort food. Also, if you don't have Parm you can sub with mozzarella and it still turns out delicious.

Fabulous Dish. We make this often with Fat Free Mayo and you can't tell a difference. We cube the chicken, we feel it makes the chicken more moist and cooks faster this way.

I was in a pinch and used a mixed cheese blend instead of Parm that i didn't have on hand.  I also used half mayo, half sour cream instead of all mayo.  The chicken was very moist and had a pretty good flavor.  I broiled it at 500 for a couple of minutes to make it brown and pretty on top.  I served it with rice and on a bed of spinach.  It was good, but it still wasn't great.  Based on the cost of a can of artichokes ($4), I didn't think this was worth repeating.  I

Be sparing on the artichoke topping if you don't want the chicken overpowered. The chicken comes out fantastically moist in this recipe though, definitely a keeper with some adjustments.

I literally cannot cook a  thing to save my life, but I was somehow able to pull this off relatively well without setting off any fire alarms! The chicken retained a lot of flavor and moisture, and although some are still baking because the chicken breasts were different sizes, it came out deliciously. I used a little less mayo and a little less cheese than specified in hopes of cutting some of the calories and it still tasted good! I cannot wait to make this again!

Very good. Took other reviewers advice and used 1/2 sour cream, also added breadcrumbs and browned the chicken first. Served it on top of pasta and got a thumbs up from my picky husband. Will make this awesome dish again!

I have cooked maybe 15 meals in my entire life. I just cooked this recipe for my wife and in-laws for mother's day. Everyone raved about the meal. I used half mayo and half sour cream like so many suggested. It was so easy to make and very delicious. I would recommend this to anyone who can or cannot cook well.

This is a really tasty recipe, didn't wow me, but was liked by the whole family, so it will go into the meal rotation. I followed other reviewers advice and used part mayo, part sour cream, along with marinated artichokes. The thing I liked the most, is that it is simple and quick to prepare!

This is a good recipe. Maybe 3.5 for flavor (as is) but  definitely a 5 for ease, and probably a 4.5 for versatility. After I made it as is (I feel you should make the recipe before changing & rating) I felt it a bit bland and a bit too much greasy liquid left in the pan. I subbed 1/3c sour cream; used a large clove of fresh garlic, minced; and put some grill marks on the chicken b4 baking for added plate appeal. I served it on a bed of Purple Chard which I left the stems on & lightly steamed in a 1/4" of water and sprinkled w/Kosher salt. The added color and texture was just what it needed! This is a solid recipe i.e. if you keep the measurements the same, you can do endless variations and they will all turn out great!!

Yummy!  4 stars for the recipe as is.   If you have a few extra minutes, make it 5 stars by quickly browning the chicken first (on the stovetop with a little olive oil), reduce the baking time to 20-23 minutes, then broil for the last 2 minutes. Browning the chicken first seals in the juices and broiling adds a nice color.  After cooking, there's a lot of liquid in the pan & I usually just pour most of the excess liquid out.

I give it five starts for ease of preparation, but three stars for taste.  I need to figure out how to jazz it up.  Maybe I'll add spinach and mushrooms next time.  I did use half sour cream and half mayo as advised by other reviewers, a well as adding some buttered bread crumbs on top and broiling for five minutes, after baking for 35.  The chicken was very moist and tender, but it was just kind of blah.

We liked this. I pounded my chicken thin and sprinkled it with black pepper. I followed another reviewers suggestion of squeezing the artichokes to get the extra water out. I think this did the trick. Otherwise I think there would have been a sloppy mess in the pan. I did part mayo part sour cream like others suggested. I did more mayo than sour cream though because I understand the mayo is necessary for the moistness of the chicken. I put in 1 tea minced garlic. Then I lightly covered the sauced chicken with 4C seasoned bread crumbs. Baked for 30 min. Broiled for 3-5 until brown. I feel this last step is a MUST. Good recipe! Will DEFINITELY make again!!

I loved this dish.  It was so easy.  I also did 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream as others suggested.  I also did not have canned artichoke hearts on hand, so I used the artichoke tapenade I had and it gave it a great flavor.

I made this as is and it was wonderful.  Next time I will put a cooling rack on top of a cookie sheet and put the chicken on top of that to bake instead of using a baking dish.  It had a lot of liquid in the bottom of the dish which didn't help to make it look too appetizing.  Once we got over that, though,  the flavor is terrific.

Been using this recipe for years! Love it!  If you are trying to cut down on fat, you can substitute up to half of the mayo with FF sour cream without sacrificing too much flavor.

used skinless, boneless chicken breasts 2 cups sour cream 2 cups crushed cornflakes cereal 1 teaspoon Italian-style seasoning for seasoning of chicken. Made this 2x and it came out better when you put the artichoke dressing when chicken is 1/2 way cooked

This recipe just doesn't match my family's tastes.  I added seasoning right away, because I knew it wouldn't be flavorful enough on it's own.  What I added was not enough.  Years ago, I tasted an amazing artichoke & chicken dish.  I wasn't able to get the recipe and this is NOT the recipe for which I'm looking.

I took the advice of other reviews; instead of using mayo alone, I used half fat free mayo and half low fat sour cream so the chicken wouldn't be too oily.  I also added garlic powder, italian seasoning, and rosemary (about 1/2 tsp of each) to the mayo/sour cream mix before coating my chicken and it gave it a great flavor.  I also used regular artichoke hearts since that's what I had at the house and the chicken tasted great!  The chicken was so moist!

TThe artichokes gave it a horrible taste.  Perhaps there is a difference in brands.  We used Trader Joe's brand.

I liked this, my family wasn't so thrilled.  I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo.  I thought the dish needed something crunchy on top, such as bread crumbs or almonds.  If I made this again, I would definitely add something for a crunch factor.

I cooked this last night. I don't know if I just wasnt in the mood for artichokes, but I wasnt really a fan of this dish. It smelks amazing and looks very yummy. Chicken was very flavorful and moist. My boyfriend , when he got home, reheated this and was amazed! Couldnt believe I knew of to cook like that! So since he loved it, I give it 5 starts.

Tasty but with a bit of a strange after taste (which may have been due to the marinated artichokes).  I didn't have garlic pepper and used garlic powder, salt, and pepper instead.

This was just OK for me.  I thought the artichoke mixture would give it an outstanding taste.  But it just didn't do much for me.  Maybe my "taster" was off this night.

This is my new favorite way to make chicken. So easy! I marinated my own artichokes in EVOO, garlic, fresh dill, parsley, basil, salt, lemon juice and a little wine vinegar. I salted the chicken first then added the sauce (1/2 mayo 1/2 sour cream)over it. I then put some paprika and a little crushed red pepper and italian bread crumbs on top! Baked for 45 minutes!

WOW!! AMAZING,... Only changes I made were to use the food processor (or blender) to make the artichoke mixture more of a sauce. I leave the artichokes in their juice for a moister dish. This has become a family favorite.

I made this dish tonight. It was really good. I followed some of the users suggestions and sauteed the artichokes with portobella mushrooms and garlic. I also used half mayo and 1/2 plain yogurt and put breadcrumbs on top. The kids liked it, so this one is a keeper.

I love this recipe so much, I double the topping ingredients. Instead of using so much mayonnaise, I cut it by half and replace with Greek yogurt. It's still creamy and delicious, but without so much fat. I like to fix this at least 3 times a month. Hopefully we won't get burned out on it.

Good! Used non-marinated artichokes & all mayo(Hellmann's light), no sour cream, and we didn't find it too greasy at all.  I seasoned the chicken on both sides and added chopped mushrooms, slivers of red onion, and dried parsley to the top before popping it in oven.   Very tasty..

I love this recipe, I used the full amount of light mayo and the same amount of light sour cream.  This  made more sauce which my family likes.  I also used two cans of artichokes.  We serve this over rice and it is excellent@

There was something off about this recipe. The artichokes had an overpowering flavor that dominated the whole recipe. Also, 30 minutes of baking made the chicken breasts chewy and dry. Maybe at 350 degrees at that time would have worked better. Or grilling the breasts and then baking the entire dish just long enough to heat through.

This is a very easy recipe. I don't even like mayonnaise, but this recipe was delicious. I did not have garlic pepper, so I used 2tsp. minced garlic and sprinkled salt and pepper. I also cooked the chicken for 50 minutes because it was not ready at 30 minutes.

I have made this recipe quite a few times. I love mayo, so I didn't change anything except for adding 2 cloves of chopped garlic. Used the marinated artichokes, drained, and my picky, mayo hating husband gobbled it up. Will pass this recipe onto many people. Marcie

This was great!  I took the advice of some other reviewers and used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo, I added extra cheese (because you can always use more cheese :) )  and put some breadcrumbs on the top about 20 mins before I took the chicken out.  It was great!  It went great with the egg noodles and green beans I served w/it. Will definitely make again, but I think I will season the chicken a little more.  It was kinda bland without the topping...

My family didn't love it. In fact, I can bet they won't ask for it again, so I had to give it 3 stars. I really like the cheesy artichoke flavor, but feel it would be more appropriate on a pasta or something other than chicken.

This recipe was a great way to use some of the artichokes I purchased in an industrial size.  I am not a mayo fan, so I was going to substitute non-fat yogurt, but it was past its due date.  So I ended up substituting the mayo with cottage cheese.  It was really creamy and complemented the artichokes well.  This dish was quick and delicious, and an easy way to liven up chicken.

This is delicious the way it is; however I was really short on time one day and decided to use some asiago artichoke dip from the deli that was sitting in my fridge instead, and it turned out just as well.  All I did was sprinkle a little garlic salt on the chicken, spoon some dip on top, and add a little extra grated Parmesan (took about 3 minutes!) and popped it in the oven. No fuss, no muss, no bother! Great flavour, easy and fast - too bad it isn't lower in fat then I'd make more often. My picky 2 year old likes it too.

REALLY TASTY! I didn't want to use all mayonaise, so I secretly substituted half of the mayonaise with sour cream. Still tasted great! The only problem I had was that it took much longer to cook than expected (to get the chicken to a safe temperature).

Was easy to make, tasted pretty good.  I like artichokes and artichoke dip (which is basically what is going on top of the chicken) but felt it was lacking in something needed to balance out the artichoke flavor more.

I did what the others did below, and used 1/2 fat free sourcream and 1/2 miracle whip. I also added a little red pepper to the mix to give it a little kick! I added italian bread crumbs on the top, and 5 minutes before i took it out of the oven I added 2 tablespoons of cilantro for extra color and taste. It tasted soo good and I will for sure make this dish again! mmMMMM YUM!

I know this recipe received many good reviews, but I did not like this at all.  It made me nauseous (too much mayo perhaps?) and was totally bland.

Excellent recipe!  The three ways I hacked it were to add 1/4 cup chopped onion, half sour cream/half mayo, and then I sprinkled paprika on top.  It looked great.  Oh and I used frozen chicken (defrosted in the micro) and that worked out too.  Will definitely be adding this one to the Rolodex. Oh and my husband said he loved it more than spinach and artichoke dip!

Next time I will season the chicken. The chicken seemed a bit flavorless.  However, the artichoke and other ingredients together worked well.

I'll hang onto this recipe because it was super easy and relatively tasty - but it was a bit too oily (i used marinated artichokes) and didn't need to be in the oven as long because I sliced the breasts in half. I also added sundried tomatoes to the topping, and that was a nice addition.

great recipe! scaled it down to 2 for just me and my sister. i browned the chicken in olive oil and garlic first and made my mixture almost all sour cream and a dollop of mayonnaise. i put bread crumbs on the chicken and paprika on top of the mixture. my very picky sister loved it!

This was okay on chicken but a little too much artichoke for our tastes.  It dominated everything else.  However, I mixed the leftover artichoke topping with about a half a package of cream cheese and heated it up as a dip and it was Wonderful!  We dipped tortilla chips into it and it was much better than the first night on the chicken.  If I made this again, I'll just make it as a dip and skip the chicken.

I'm rating this 5 stars because my dh, 6 year old daughter, and 13 month son all devoured it, and when I can get all of them to eat it, it's a keeper!! I on the other hand didn't find it all that flavorful. I will definitely make again, but saute some garlic into it. I also added some cooked bacon in it, which added a nice flavor.

Really good recipe.  I used 9 chicken tenders instead of the whole breast, and ended up using a little less mayo per the other reviews..  The topiing was good, and I still had plenty left over (probably had more to do with my chicken size though..) I will definitely make this again because we all ate it (including my 3 yr old - which is always HUGE!!)and really enjoyed it.  I especially liked how EASY it was to throw together!

Flavor is great (make sure not to use marinated artichokes though).  Not the prettiest of chicken dishes to offer to company but still it's the taste that matters and this is the only artichoke chicken recipe I use anymore.

I did not like the flavor of this dish at all. Others may enjoy it though. If you are going to make it, I would use less mayo. The consistency was to gooey for me.

Amazing!!  I highly recommend this recipe.  Best chicken recipe I've ever personally cooked.  The portions I made were gigantic but my girlfriends and I gobbled them all up.  This is definitely going to be a repeat at my place.  I didn't change a thing with the recipe.  I don't know if I'll bother doing so next time, either.  It was fantastic as is, for me.

Loved this recipe. However, I used half light sour cream and half mayo. I cooked the chicken on a pan first, then added the artichoke mix, and baked for about 45 minutes. I loved it!!!

This is easy and yummy.  I took the suggestions of using marinated artichoke hearts and 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream.  I made up the mix and let it sit for an hour before putting it on the chicken and in the oven.  It gave the flavors a chance to develop.  I'll make this again but will season the chicken before putting on the topping.  **UPDATE:  I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder and black pepper 24 hours prior to making this.  Turned out muuuuuch better then the first time!  YUM!

I thought this was a pretty easy and tasty recipe.  Although, I used Veganaise, instead of mayo and I used real parmesan cheese.  I served it on Gluten-free brown rice pasta shells and it was fabulous!!

I am giving this recipe its rating based on making it as the recipe stated, only thing is i added some chopped roasted red peppers, just because I had some.  Now, back to the recipe...as for the flavor, it was very good.  The only issue is that while cooking...the mayo and cheese melted into about 2 cups worth of oil leaving a wierd slime on top of the chicken.  It was very upsetting.  I plan on making this again except I will substitute some of the mayor with sour cream, in hopes of ending out with a sauce, and not artichokes floating in oil.  Hopefully this will be better.

Good recipe...I used marinated artichokes and added a can of mushrooms to it..and topped it off with some capers..did need some pepper to add some flavor. Good overall..served over noodles because there was plenty of sauce leftover.

Ok I modified the recipe, but it was awesome. I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup alfredo sauce instead of the 3/4 cup mayo called for in the recipe. I topped it with mozzerelo cheese, and boy was this an awesome meal. I will make again and again!

I made this last night for company, and everyone loved it!  I had thawed out a whole 3 lb. bag of chicken breasts, so I doubled the artichoke mixture, put it in a 9 x 12 baking dish and cooked it 10 minutes longer than recipe stated.  I didn't have garlic pepper or marinated artichoke hearts like others suggested, so I chopped up regular canned artichoke hearts and mixed in a couple teaspoons of garlic from a jar, some garlic salt, and a good bit of black pepper and let it sit in that for a few hours before I mixed in the other ingredients.  I also used 1 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of sour cream, (both light) and it worked out great.  I drained and squeezed the artichokes before chopping so I wouldn't have a watery sauce.  Also, I put paprika on top before baking and it was a beautiful color.  Will make again and again!  Thanks for a different twist on chicken, Amanda!

This was delicious. I followed a reviewer's suggestion by using 1/2 of the mayo and added the sour cream...not oily at all.  I also added the Italian bread crumbs...nice touch. I'll be making this again.

I was pleasantly surprised how well this turned out. Even my kids (4 and 3) ate it. I followed many of the suggestions, and here's what I did: I used chicken tenderloins and lightly sprinkled both sides with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. For the sauce, I used about a 1/2 cup of light mayo, and about 10-12 ounces (eying what's left of my 16-oz carton) of light sour cream. I'm not a big measuring type person, so I sprinkled in more onion powder, garlic powder, cajun seasoning, crushed red pepper, and salt and pepper, all to taste. I also added a handful of frozen, chopped spinach and the jar of drained, marinated artichoke hearts. I pureed all of this to even out the texture for my kids.  Over the chicken I first put a layer of Parmesan and mozzarella cheese till lightly covered. Then I poured the sauce over the chicken and topped with more Parmesan and mozzarella cheese. I baked it as indicated and served with fettuccine noodles and white rolls (for sopping up the rest of the sauce). It's not a very healthy meal, but it was very tasty!

I made this dish a couple of nights ago.  After reading through the other reviews I decided to use 1/4c each of sour cream and mayo.  I also used 1/2t each garlic powder and pepper (I never buy mixed spices, so I didn't have garlic pepper).  My husband and our 4 kids really liked this dish.  I thought it was good, but didn't enjoy it as much as they seemed to.  All in all, I'll make this dish again and enjoy it, but it's not one of my personal favorites.

This is delicious and easy!  My boyfriend made it for me initially and I loved it.  We have since tried different variations with it. These variations have included adding ritz to the top, bread crumbs and just omitting the artichoke altogether.

This recipes is so fast, so easy to prepare and so delicious.  I only made one slice change.  Instead of using garlic pepper I added a teaspoon of minced garlic from my fridge.  This one is a keeper.  I plan to serve it at my next dinner party.

This has become a family favorite.  The only difference I made was to bread and fry the cutlets first.  My family just doesn't like the chicken plain. I then just top the cooked chicken with the artichoke mixture and put it in the oven for about 15 minutes to heat up the topping. Absolutely delicious!

My husband and I thought this was very tasty, but the kids didn't care for it.  They found the mayonaise taste a bit overpowering.

The family really enjoyed this one. I didn't have sour creme so I used Miracle Whip, added some Italian seasoning and seasoned the chicken with salt/pepper before covering with the artichoke mixture. Served it with egg noodles. I'll make it again for sure.

Great Recipe! Was a Hit With the Family! It was lacking a little flavor in the Chicken, so i would recommend seasoning the chicken first with a little salt & pepper. I used fresh garlic & also used 1/4 cup Miracle whip & 1/2 cup of sour cream and added a little breadcrumb & paprika on top, so it would crisp up. Would recommended this quick under 30 mins recipe!

My husband, who HATES chicken, rated this one as very very good.  I also did half mayo (olive oil mayo has half the fat naturally) and sour cream.  The only thing i didn't love was the artichoke seemed to firm too firm.  I might cook it longer in lower heat then broil next time.

I made this recipe last night, and it was really great!  I did substitute the mayo for 1/2 sour cream (non fat) and half low fat Mayo.  In the mix I also added a dash of Cajun spice and two garlic cloves.  Gave it a bit of a kick, and that is how I normally make my food.  Paired this up with grilled vegetables and some Chardonnay, and it made for a fantastic dinner.

THUMBS UP! This recipe came out very very good! I am not a hugely creative cook so I followed some advice from others that I thought sounded good and it worked out great. I used 1/2c reduced fat sour cream and 1/2c lite mayo...I am not a fan of heavy cream sauces so I figured this would work out well and it did! I also put breadcrumbs on the top (which was the best idea I borrowed) and sprinkled paprika as well. I used the marinated artichokes and squeezed the juice out of them, I was amazed as to how much juice came out! I also added fresh pepper and minced two cloves of garlic, but you could have done none or one clove if you don't like garlic too much. And lastly I chopped up some portobello mushrooms...which are good, but not necessary. I served it with linguine. I will make this again :)

AWESOME! I changed some stuff to appeal to my family: 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream. 1/2 parm cheese, 1/2 mozzarella. A little more seasoning, and I salt/peppered the chicken before putting the sauce on. I also did bread crumbs on top, and let it brown up real nice. A keeper for sure!

This recipe has made it in to the weekly rotation because it's so fast, easy, and delicious. I make it low fat with FF sour cream, LF mayo, and alittle less parm than called for. Thinking about adding spinach to the mixture next time.

Too much mayo - those that said sub or halve with sour cream are right.  This is sort of like having that artichoke dip (usually with spinach) cooked on top of chicken - very good!  I used marinated artichokes (drained) and put an extra can of artichoke hearts in water (drained - squeeze extra water out) all around the edges (just cause I'm an artichoke maniac!).   Everything else was to the letter.  I'm only putting 4 because the mayo was a bit overpowering - wish there was a 4.5.  I hate it when people change the recipe and then rate it - but I will say the big difference was there was too much mayo in the original - that was the only thing from the recipe I didn't like.  My family did say "make it again!"  :)

Fabulous! I followed all of the measurements exactly, but I used marinated artichoke hearts as others suggested (and squeezed the extra juice out of them), and also sprinkled the tops with bread crumbs and a little paprika. I served this on top of linguine noodles.

This was absolutely delicious,very juicy, very flavorful. I only had 1/4 cup of mayonaise left, so I used light blue cheese dressing to round it out. I used frozen artichokes and grated cheese and added a splash of lemon juice and a dash of garlic powder. I will make this again, it is a delicous but quick and easy entree for a busy night. I would recommend serving with a green salad and warm rolls for mopping up every drop of the delicious sauce. :)

My husband gave this a 5. I gave it a 3 so it came out a 4. I'm not a fan of parmesan cheese at all. I was hoping everything else would drown out the taste but it didn't. This would be sooo good if I didn't use the parmesan cheese. Next time I will try Mozzarella chesse instead of parmesan. I did take others advice & use 1/2 mayo & 1/2 sour cream. The sauce was to die for. I also took others advise & used the marinated artichokes and I don't think I will use them again. Tasted too much like Italian dressing it was marinated in & I'm not a fan of that either. So next time I make this, I will stick to the recipe but swap the parmesan cheese out with moss. cheese. Thanks so much for the recipe. Those who like the marinated artichokes & parmesan cheese must like real Italian food because that is what it tasted like.

Made it according to the recipe and no one in the family liked it. Bummer I had high hopes from reading the ingredients. Probably just me because there are a lot of excellent reviews.

The topping was great, I added a can of mushrooms just because I like them. However, next time I make it I will cube the chicken and mix it up, casserole style. I was only dissappointed that the artichoke topping didn't cover all parts of the chicken when poured on top. Otherwise awesome.

This chicken is so good! My husband is not a fan of mayo, so I subbed half for sour cream, and he loved it! I also used marinated artichokes for a little more flavor,and it turned out great. The chicken was very moist and flavorful!

Based on the other reviews we also wanted to dilute the mayo. To go even lower-cal we used 1/4 cup nonfat plain ypgurt. I don't think it affected the outcome too much. This recipe does have a bit of a funny aftertaste though.

This was ok, and has potential.  It was very salty for my taste.  The leftovers were inedible because of the strong flavor.  Perhaps that's from the Parmesan and the artichoke marinade.  I may try this again, but I would use cream cheese instead of the Parmesan.

Yummy!  My entire family loved this recipe.  I'll be making it again.  After reading the review, I substituted half of the mayo for sour cream, but left the rest of the recipe alone.  I plan to add some portobella mushrooms to it next time for even more flavor. Thanks for sharing!

This must be one of the quickest recipies to make in a pinch, and goes great with all sorts of pasta. (I put it with a basil penne). I go very heavy on the parmeasean cheese just because I love the taste, but that is completely up to the palate of the cook.

It was good, I did change things (like used some sour cream and real garlic) but I'm sure that my changes improved things, if I didn't have to change things I"d give it 4 stars for taste. It didn't blow my mind my husband said it was good and shurged (not special). I recommend serving it with mashed potatoes or something with a very mild flavor. I may make it again if I have artichokes to use up but I don't think it's special.

I used fat free mayo and found it a little heavy for my taste, but I have to give this a 5 for being one of the moistest chicken dishes I have prepared.  It also lends itself well to substituting the artichoke hearts with other veggies like broccoli, mushrooms or spinach etc.  I am sure by using half sour cream and half mayo it will solve the problem of the dominant taste of mayo.

My 10 year old daughter & I made this for dinner together tonight. It was easy to do and we both loved it.  We did the 1/2 sour cream & 1/2 olive oil mayo.  We had it with cheesy rice. I am looking forward to the leftovers.  Great to make with your kids.

This is so simple and so tasty.  I baked the chicken in 275 degrees for 2 hours and it was very tender with golden topping.  My 2-year-old triplets gobbled it all up.  Thanks.

This was a really great and unusual chicken recipe! I made some adjustments based on other reviewers: I used 1/2 cup fat free sour cream and 1/4 cup reduced fat mayo; instead of garlic pepper I used pepper and garlic pepper. I also sprinkled bread crumbs over the top. Thanks to all for your great sugestions - It made for a fabulous dinner. My husband loved it!

I thought this was good, my husband loved it. I think it was missing a little something- maybe just marinated artichokes. I also added canned  mushrooms to the sauce. I will make again for sure and add some more things to it!

MADE IT A SECOND TIME- added marinated artichokes, mushrooms, sundried tomatoes and it was yummy!

This tasted pretty darn good! I mixed the artichokes, parmesan cheese, and garlic pepper with a mixer and the mixture came out nice and creamy. It's a good base for pasta too.

Very good meal. If you want a healthier side I understand why people want to substitute sour cream for mayo, but its just as great with mayo.  I am a sophomore in college and made this for my roommate and me, couldn't be much easier for us to make.

This was great!! My kids even ate it!! I did it a little different. I cut up the chicken and mixed it in with the mixture, put it in the baking dish and put bread crumbs on top of it. Didn't have garlic pepper, so I put in a little pepper, garlic salt, and garlic powder. Oh and I did the 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 mayo. It was fast and easy.

My whole family enjoyed this dish and it was really easy to make.  I've made it couple times and I cut down on the mayo the second time so that it's not so creamy (also it's healthier with less mayo).

I really liked this recipe!! Even my 9 year old liked it.. I would make again. I did like others and used 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream and I added some shredded monteray jack (all I had) the last 5 minutes. YUM!!

This was a really tasty, easy recipe. My husband (who doesn't like rich, creamy dinners OR artichokes) ate it without complaint and even said it was good! The only change I made was to add real garlic to the sauce (instead of garlic pepper)and I added salt and pepper to the chicken prior to putting on the sauce. It is pretty rich, and I don't think I'll add to my rotation, but I will make it every now and then for something different.

My husband and I thought this was wonderful chicken! I used a whole can of artichokes but made it with only three chicken breasts.  I used half sour cream, half mayo and topped it off with some mozzarella cheese and a dash of paprika.  Very, very good!

I've made this a few times now. As written, it was pretty good. Substituting half the mayo with sour cream added a lot to it. Doing that, plus taking out garlic pepper and replacing it with minced garlic and black pepper and topping it with mozzarella and parmesan plus adding paprika on top would make it five stars in my opinion.

Oh man, so good! I used half mayo and half sour cream, as suggested. I love, love, love artichokes so I definitely added a little bit more to the mixture. I used about 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder and added a pinch of pepper. Everyone loved this and devoured it!

This was a great dish.  The chicken was very moist and juicy.  Just make sure the artichokes are drained well, it will be watery after cooking.  I used half mayo/sour cream in the mixture, as others suggested.  I also added some fresh minced garlic, as I did not have any garlic pepper.

This recipe was excellent. The chicken comes out perfectly most and the artichoke mixture on top is quite yummy.  Husband loved it and so did I!  We will be having this again.

I accidently used mirical whip, which I hate. So when I baked it I added bacon on top. When it was done I poured ranch and jalopinos on top also. That really worked I didn't taste the mirical whip. When I had seconds I added some chedder cheese and mixed everything with stuffing. It was amazing good. When I make this again I will make it into a casserole with the stuffing mixed in it.

I didn't have sour cream on hand as others suggested so I used cream cheese, since this sauce sounds like artichoke dip, I decided to add a bunch of chopped fresh spinach I had on hand and it was very good. I think slicing the chicken into smaller pieces allows it to absorb more flavor from the sauce while cooking.

I know I changed this recipe and only gave it a 4, but I believe my changes only added to the recipe.  I used half fat free sour cream and half light mayo for the 3/4 mayo part.  I also used marinated artichokes and chopped them up.I chopped the chicken up as well and added bread crumbs on top.  Good but not great. I will probably make this sometime in the distant future but I don't really think this recipe is worth the calories.

It was very delicious, and it is a good comfort food because of its richness and cheesiness. I followed the recipe, but instead of the garlic pepper I added a bit of garlic powder to the artickoke mix and salt and pepper to the chicken. The chicken came out perfect, very juicy. My tips are that I squeezed out the excess juice from the artichokes, added a bit of olive oil to the bottom of the pan, and added only a pinch of salt or else it comes out salty.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly and it was a huge hit! Everyone loved it.  The second time I diced and browned 6 slices of bacon and sauted 1/2 box of frozen spinach with 1/2 diced onion and added 1 tsp lemon zest.  I also only used 1/2 cup mayo and added 1/2 cup sour cream. I then mixed all of this with the artichokes and cheese and placed on top of chicken cutlets.   This was wonderful!

I make this recipe all the time, it's very easy.  I find that the chicken usually takes up to an hour to cook completely so watch out for that.  Steamed vegetables are good on the side.

my family LOVED this.  i was only making a couple of chicken breasts, so i spooned the remaining artichoke mixture into a dish and baked it alone.  It was so good served as a dip with pita chips.  also, i added a few dashes of tabasco to the mix, to give it a little kick.

Delicious, tender chicken. Great flavor with only the ingredients listed. My dish turned out a little oily. I cubed the chicken and used the canola mayo, so maybe that was why. I served with whole wheat pasta. Sooo good!

Ridiculously good!!  I added finely chopped fresh baby spinach leaves, and it was super yummy.  I also substituted almost all of the mayo for nonfat yogurt.  It was till rich and delicious from the parmesan cheese.  Definitely a keeper!

I have made this twice now, and everyone has raved over it... I did crush some garlic in the mixture. I used marinated artichokes.. a must for me. Then to add color for presentation I sliced some black olives and added petite diced tomatoes to the top after it was baked. absolutely delish!

Good, not great chicken.  I liked that it was something different, but it was also very rich.  I could only eat about a half a piece of chicken.  Serve over white rice to suck up all the juices.

ok, but not fabulous in my opinion. There are other chicken recipes on this site with better flavor. Was a decent dinner but most likely will not make again. Followed recipe as written.

My kids loved it and so did the hubby! So this is a keeper. I did like others suggeseted. I squeezed the artichokes out and I used half miracle whip and half sour cream. The only thing I may add next time is about 10 minutes before I take it out of the oven I would add some shredded cheese to the top...yummy!

I made this recipe last night, but I found it in a Taste of Home Cookbook.
I used chicken tenders (breasts cut in half length-wise would work well). The thinner, smaller chicken pieces made it faster to cook, more tender, and easier to serve and eat. Also, I used reduced-fat mayo since that's all I ever purchase. I like more garlic flavor in my artichoke dip, so I used about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, next time I'll up that amount as well.
Mine didn't brown very much and I couldn't broil it since I was using my glass casserole dish. I think baking it on an upper oven rack would have solved that problem.
The biggest surprise was that my artichoke hating family had no idea what they were eating and they LOVED it! DH had 2 servings before he decided to stop before exploding. Served with brown rice and green beans.

Very easy and quick to make. I used garlic powder instead of garlic pepper and artichoke bottoms. My husband who usually does not like mayo-based sauces loved it too.

This was so easy and so good.  I used chicken breast tenders instead of big breasts and sprinkled the chicken with a little garlic powder before putting the "topping" on.  Really good.

Very good recipe!!  Chicken was sooooo tender and delicious.  The only things I did differently was using Hellman's Mayo with canola oil (it tastes just like their regular mayo, only no cholestrol), and I used a big clove of garlic chopped because I didn't have garlic pepper.  Just a tip..the articoke hearts have plenty of sodium in them, so I wouldn't recommend using any salt, only pepper.  This recipe stays in the rotation!!!

I used to make a dip with this topping and loved it, so this wa so wonderful and moist. I used reduced fat Mayo, and took a reviewers advice and replace half the mayo with sour cream, only I used the fat free.  I would have used the reduced fat if I had any but it was still great and will make it the same way again. I can't wait till the next time I have company to serve this. It looks and tastes like a company dish.

This is so yummy. I double the artichoke topping because that is the best part. The topping keeps the chicken moist. I do recommend what others say about squeezing the hearts in paper towel before mixing in to avoid excess water in the cooking pan. I use sour cream with the mayo (at about 1-3 ratio). My finace' loves this so much he asks for it at least once a week.

Made this dish for some friends, but I only used one dessertspoon of mayonaise and made up the quantity with greek yoghurt, plus of course, the chopped artichokes and parmesan cheese.  Everybody loved it and it probably had fewer calories!

This was SO EASY.  I had frozen breasts, and I cooked them with this recipe, still frozen. I used a baking stone (9x9) and baked for about 45 minutes (partly because I got distracted).  They were moist, very flavorful, cooked well and a BIG hit.  I also used the 1/2 mayo 1/2 sour cream mix, and fresh minced garlic. Yum

Great & EASY! Drain the artichoke hearts really well after dicing them really fine to avoid the "watery" bottom of the dish. My husband who doesn't normally go for artichoke thought this was pretty good!

This has gone right to the top of my list of favorite chicken recipes. I followed nfl's suggestion and used a combination of mayo and sour cream, and I loved the result -- will continue to make it this way.

This was pretty good.  I followed the recommendations and did 1/2 mayo and 1/2 light sour cream.  The only problem was that I had to bake it for 1 hour instead of 30 minutes as directed.  Besides that it was great!  Served with warm french bread and a simple salad with olive oil and vinegar.

This recipe was easy and so flavorful! I had to make a few changes based on what I had on hand...1 pinch garlic powder instead of garlic pepper,a dash of garlic & herb flavor "Mrs. Dash", light mayonnaise, and marinated artichoke hearts. I stirred in 1 teaspoon of the artichoke oil from the jar just to get it to spread easier. I'm glad I did not add any salt, as it would have been way too salty! I also pounded the chicken nice and thin, it cooked fast and was tender.
I will make this again! Thanks so much

This is a home run in our household!  I, too, used marinated artichokes, chopped fine, and also threw in a few red pepper flakes because we like spicy.  It was delicious...no leftovers!

Been using this recipe base since 2008! Ive since switched some ingredients around.. I use lemon pepper, powdered garlic and marinated artichokes. 1/2 mayo 1/2 sour cream and I add 1c chopped sautéed spinach and top it with 1/2c Motzerella cheese. I like to prep it in a dish before work so I get home and can throw it in the oven. Sometimes I add fresh basil from the garden. Either way you play with it, this is a fantastic base recipe and has become standard rotation in my house :)

This recipe was not a favorite for our family. The chicken was moist but the overall dish was not very flavorful.  It might just be a matter of taste. Our family may just like foods with more seasoning and spices.

This chicken was just okay. I pounded the chicken a little to tenderize and cook quicker but it was no where close to being done in 30 minutes. The flavor from the artichoke mix was good but did not penetrate the chicken, leaving it a bit dry tasting. Would not make again.

This would have been a 5 if I had heeded others' advice and used half mayo and half sour cream. Never the less, my wife and I enjoyed it.

Easy, easy, easy!!  I did use the sour cream as half of the base, and loved it. My husband is not a fan of parm cheese, so it won't be a requested item, but worth making again for myself!!

SO delish! Made this for the first time the other night and like other reviewers, used minced garlic & black ground pepper as I had no garlic pepper, sour cream & mayo, and squeezed out as much liquid from the artichokes (not marinated). This will definitely go into my menu rotation.

this was so delicious.  We all love artichokes, so I used one can, squeezed the water out and chopped, one small jar of marinated, used the juice, and one can hearts of palms chopped and added this all.  What a flavourful chicken dish.  Last 15 mins. I sprinkled on top some breadcrumbs and I baked for 55 mins. as I had huge chicken breasts from Costco.  Excellent taste and very easy to make.

My husband and guests rated this an 8 out of 10, but I didn't like it as much. I did use a bit more Parmesan then the recipe called for and I think that that was the problem.

My husband LOVED this and said its a recipe to do again.  The chicken was so moist.  I read other reviews and followed some of their advice.  The changes I made were: ADDED 5 stips pre-cooked bacon and tore them into pieces, 1 can mild green chilies, 1/4 C sharp shredded cheddar cheese, 1 bud garlic,  seasoned with garlic salt, pepper and lots of paprika.  OMITTED: garlic pepper as I did not have any.

This was a great recipe sooooo easy. My husband said he thought that it was restaurant quality. I used 3/4 mayo, 3/4 sour cream, 1 cup parmesean, 1 sm cn mushrooms, 1 cn artichoke hearts, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. It gave me a milder taste of the mayo as athers had suggested and a little extra sauce for the noodles. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

The only thing that was great about this dish was the smell of it cooking. However it was very bland. I have made a similar baked artichoke dip that is excellent with French bread, but not on chicken. Sorry.

I used half sour cream and half mayo as others suggested. I think I will use all mayo next time. My husband does not like artichokes, but he raved about this dish.   pounded the thick parts of the chicken to cook more evenly.

I wasn't impressed with this. It was easy enough to prepare, but the flavor was bland. My family loves artichokes and didn't care for this. I doubt I will make it again without majorily changing the recipe.

Yikes! I should have cut the artichokes MUCH smaller than I did. A big bite of artichoke is just too much. (Especially if you want the kids to eat it) Also, I used tenderloins instead of breasts and should have used a few more. (used 8) I wound up with too much topping, and not enough meat. I think with some tweaking, I could get it right next time and it will be really good. It WAS easy prep though, and good flavor.

This recipe was great, I pounded the chicken which I do to all chicken breast anyway. I then sprinkled then with Kickin Chicken seasoning. I used freshly ground parmsean cheese and added a few sun dried tomatoes. Everyone loved it.

Excellent recipe, used thighs and was great. I had this same concoction (minus chicken)in a recipe to use on English muffins..only difference is crab is used in it. I may add that next time. Also, marinated artichokes is a must, I think that may be the big difference with everyone's opinions.

oh my gosh this was amazing my son and I do a cook think once a week and we chose this just cause we love artichokes and chicken and it was so easy, but we couldnt keep going in the kitchen snacking on it, and we got chicken breast tenders only cause that was what was on sale, but we had no liquid problems and we used dryed minced garlic, just a sprinkle and fresh ground pepper, only cause we didnt have garlic pepper  and I am asumming the mayo is what keeps the chicken moist and tender...its wow, the best

MADE THIS ONE NIGHT WHEN WE WERE DOING OUR KITCHEN RENO. VERY EASY TO MAKE WITH LITTLE EFFORT AND FEW INGREDIENTS. FOLLOWED OTHER REVIEWS AND USED NO FAT SOUR CREAM AND HALF MAYO, WORKED OUT FANTASTIC AND WAS YUMMY AND MOIST ASLO. HUBBY LOVED IT AND HE HATES ARTICHOKES. LOL

This chicken was pretty basic tasting.  I did follow suggestions and cut mayo with some sour cream, it helps cut the fat but not so much for the flavor.  It made it a little bland even for me. My husband loved this dish and said it was even better the next day for lunch..I just wasn't that into it I guess.  I don't think I liked the  Marinated Artichokes I used because I swear they tasted exactly like olives and I am not a fan of them. I would use artichokes that are NOT MARINATED like the recipe says, because they will have the distinct taste of olive oil and olive taste since that is what they are marinated in. I did season the chicken with S&P  and some paprika as was suggested, it did help the chicken.  Also I like to pound the chicken breast out a little bit whenever I bake them, it makes them super moist. Also I found that the Parmesean cheese did not melt that well so I suggest a better melting cheese next time, Mozzarella or maybe some slices of Muenster laid under the mayo/artichoke mix would be delicious.  All in all great recipe to help expose cooks to new flavors and ideas. Thanks!

Definitely not low fat, but a worthwhile indulgence. Used half sour cream, half mayo like recommended and loved the flavors. I will be making this again!

Was ok.  I had to add a lot to it to make it ok though.  I guess I am in the minority on loving this recipe.  I did add about 1/2 cup of crished croutons to the top for crunch and added about 1 cup of 6 cheese blend of italian shredded cheese to the mixture to make it cheesier.  I also added about 1 tsp paprika, 1 tsp garlic and 1 tsp onion powder but everything still lacked good flavor.

Very good.  Used half sour cream, half mayo, both reduced fat, as others suggested.  Sprinkle some paprika, garlic powder, and pepper on the chicken prior to topping with mixture.  It disappeared quickly!  Thanks.

Very easy and good, but very rich! I served over speghetti noodles and sprinkled some paprika over the top of the dish.  I will make it again, but next time I would use 1/2 sour cream 1/2 mayo.  The mayo taste was a little overwhelming.

Good and easy, but rich and not for the calorie conscious. I'm glad I took other reviewers' recommendations and cut the mayo with sour cream.

Very good -- have tried as written and with some recommended changes (spinach, shallots, garlic, mushrooms, mayo/sour cream mix) and this is pretty tough to mess up.

Made this for dinner tonight.  Took suggestions from others and use half mayo and half sour cream.  It was really very delicious!  It was very rich, too.  I used marinated hearts which I think added to the flavor.  I'll be making this again (but it won't be in the regular rotation because of the richness).

This was very flavorful and moist.  I did do half sour cream half mayo and used 2 cloves fresh garlic, minced.  I also only used 1/2 can of artichoke hearts.  I will definitely make this again.  I had some extra sauce that I didn't put on the chicken and popped it in the oven and ate it with tortilla chips...very good.

Very good!  As others suggested, I did half mayo/half sour cream. I also used 2 cloves of fresh garlic in lieu of garlic pepper.  I also added about 1/4-1/2 tsp. of dried thyme.  My fiance LOVED it.  I loved it too, but by the end thought that it was too rich.  I think toning down the cheese and maybe adding something else to make the topping creamier (maybe just starting the whole thing with a roux, or using some lemon-based sauce) would help make this dish a little more delicate (which was what I was looking for).  But definitely a keeper!

Really enjoyed this recipe. The chicken gets the flavor of the artichoke and it gets very creamy.
My husband (who loves artichokes!) couldnt believe how tasty and delicious it was!
I'll make it again for sure.
Thanks for this lovely recipe!

I used others' suggestions and did half mayo/half sour cream.  The flavor got old toward the end of the meal.  My family thought it was just ok.

I agree that this is a great recipe. Like many others I changed the proportions to half light mayo & half light sour cream, as well as adding some garlic. It was delicious!

Fantastic. I used the recommended half sourcream half mayonaisse and it was perfect. The texture and the aroma and the taste...I got great compliments as I had this for a dinner party - around the horn was a unanimous "WONDERFUL" for the dish!!

This was good. It gets 4.5 stars in my book. The marinated artichokes are good if you're putting the chicken and sauce over pasta. By itself it's too overpowering, so if you're planning on not putting it with pasta or rice, use the artichokes packed in water instead.

This is very good especially if you like artichoke dip (which we do!). I would say that you could really spread out the topping over several pieces of chicken. It's very flavorful and too much can really drown the chicken. Overall, an excellent recipe that looks like it came from a restaurant!

This was good, and very easy.  I'd make it again...I used about 1/4 c light mayo and 1/2 cup light sour cream so it wouldn't be horribly bad for my diet.

My husband loves this! The only thing I did different was marinate my chicken first (although I am funny about always having to mariate).  I marinated my chicken with a few drops of soysauce (for moisture), a few shakes of texmex and a tiny shakes of italian spice.

Yummy and quick. Just a tip, be sure to squeeze the juice from the artichokes first or the mixture will separate.

This was great!  I pounded the chicken 1st, it was easier to cook the thinner breasts.  I followed others advice and used 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream.  I also added a little extra garlic powder (actually garlic salt), red pepper flakes, and pepper.  This was incredible, will definitely make it to my list of dinners we have on a regular basis.  I served it with a side dish of spinach and couscous.

This was very good and liked very much by the both of us.  I don't like thick chicken breasts, so I opened them up a bit and pounded them out in a plastic back.  I added additional frozen quartered artichokes on top for appearance and added artichoke flavor, we love artichokes.  Thank you for the recipe. Update - I made this again using catfish fillets and added lemon pepper... what an excellent alternative to replace chicken.  It got 5 stars from my freinds and we will no longer be using chicken, only fish now.  WOW, super great!

This is a wonderfully easy and tasty meal. I always keep a can of artichokes in my cupbord now, just in case I get home late and need to make a quick and tasty meal. I would have given it 5 stars...  it is a wonderful recipe as it is, but I usually add some garlic and sun dried tomatoes to give it a bit more flavor.

This was great! I only had the small jar of the marinated artichokes, so I decided to chop up the chicken and emptyed out the marinade from the artichoke and used that (plus some salt and lemon pepper) to marinade the chicken pcs for about 5 mins while I got everything else together. I used half sour cream and half mayo plus added a T of minced garlic. I spread that mixture directly over the marinading chioken pcs and then baked for about 15-20 mins. I served with sauteed spinish with garlic  and mushrooms over egg noodles. My boyfriend couldn't stop saying how great it tasted. I would really love the leftovers for breakfast!! lol Thanks for a great recipe!!

SO GOOD! WOW! I made this for dinner and it was so yummy! I added mushrooms and onions, and I did half LF mayo and half LF sour cream - about 1/2 cup each. I also used some lemon juice and oregano. I just topped with cheese before baking, instead of putting it in the mixture. I paired it with some good garlic mashed potatoes, pesto flat bread, and a nice wine and it was perfect. My husband said "it was better than any restaurant would make!"

The chicken cooked up very moist. I'm a big fan of artichokes anyway but I thought this one was really good. I also added some fresh, sliced mushrooms along with a little extra Parmesan cheese.

excellent and easy dinner dish. the aroma was fantastic and the perfect "welcome home" after my husband's long business trip. i used garlic powder instead of garlic pepper and would definitely use at least 5 chicken breasts the next time i made this dish, however, the extra sauce was great over the bed of spaghetti.

This was great! As suggested, I used half sour cream and half mayo; I also cubed the chicken instead of using whole breasts and, per my husband's request added a few sliced mushrooms and roasted red peppers. We had it served over wheat spaghetti- and it was awesome! Even my 3 year old ate it, much to my surprise. We will definitely make this again.

After so many reviews do you need another "this is a great recipe". Flavorful, easy will definitely make this again next time I'll try sour cream instead of the mayonnaise and maybe a few chopped black olives.

I followed the other reviews and used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup mayo. The final dish tasted like hot artichoke dip on top of bland chicken. The chicken needs some seasoning (not salt, the mayo is plenty).  Maybe next time will add spinach and chop the chicken into bite size pieces and serve as a dip.  For the leftovers - I ate the topping with chips and tossed the chicken. This is not a main dish in my book. 2/8/07 - I made again by exact recipe. The idea of this is better than the taste. Still the same effect - hot artichoke dip with bland chicken.

Like another reviewer, I thought there was an awful lot of liquid in the bottom of the dish after this baked.  However, the flavor was very good, and it was very quick and easy to make.  Next time, I plan to brown the chicken first, squeeze out all liquid from the artichokes, and possibly add a little spinach to the topping mixture.  Also like another reviewer, I used half mayo and half sour cream.

So delicious and simple! I've used hints from other reviewers, and used 1/2 mayo (low-fat) and 1/2 sour cream (non-fat). I also use a combination of canned artichokes and marinated ones. My favorite addition to the recipe is about 1/4 cup of sliced black olives. Another trick: if you grill the chicken breasts first, then you can just top them with the artichoke mixture and heat in the microwave. It's just as yummy (and it adds that "cooked chicken color" so the result is not quite so "blond"). This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This recipe was wonderful. Very simple & easy. The mayo gave it the extra little punch. I cut up my chicken into bite size & only added 3/4 can of artichokes. Served it over pasta.

VERY good. Since my family is often on the run, this is simply a wonderful recipe to throw together and stick in the oven!

Good recipe, but it didn't blow me away. I made the changes recommended - 1/2 c. sour cream and 1/3 cup mayo, added minced garlic to the topping, and used garlic salt instead of garlic pepper, since that's what I had on-hand. I also used marinated artichokes and squeezed the juice out of them, and added mozzarella to the top. My mother really liked it, and wants the recipe - I might make it again, will add mushrooms this time.

This was good, but not great - although I only had sour cream on hand so I didn't use mayo...it just didn't have that 'oomph' that I would like and also seemed to drown in the thick 'sauce.'

You'd have to be a big fan of artichoke hearts for this one. The flavor is pretty powerful in this recipe. My family didn't mind it, but I wouldn't make it again.

Ohmigod - died and went to heaven.  The only downside was the calorie count but every once in a while...  I did brown the chicken first to give it colour but that's the only change I made.  Try this - you won't be disappointed

It's a wonderful dish, I will make it again. I used half sour cream and half mayo, I think it has a better favor than just mayo.

I followed directions and was sadly dissappointed. I felt it was too creamy and bland tasting.  It reminded me of the artichoke dip except with chicken.  I won't make this again unless I have no other alternative.

This was okay, but not fabulous. The only chicken I had on hand was garlic and herb seasoned chicken breasts, and it just didn't go that great with the artichoke mixture.  The artichoke mixture was delicious though, so if I make this again I'll just use plain chicken breasts.

My family really likes this recipe.  Only changes that I make is to chunk up the chicken breasts before baking.  Sometimes I have to strain off the extra liquid before serving.  Excellent over a bed of wild/white rice.

This was really good, even my husband who always tells me he doesn't like chicken enjoyed it.  I used a combination of mayo and sour cream as suggested, and added some minced garlic to the sauce.  Very easy and tasty, thanks!

This chicken is easy to make and so yummy!  My husband who doesnt typically eat chicken nor does he eat artichokes LOVED it.  My 6-year old son could not tell me enough how much he liked this chicken!  I will definetely make this again.

Followed the directions exactly and I am so impress with how moist the chicken was.  I have found it difficult to cook moist chicken, but this topping is great.  I will definitely make this again.

This chicken is so moist.  My family loved it.  I did brown it first before putting it in the pan.  I also threw in some asparagus.  It was so good!!  Enjoy.

This recipe was really easy and very good.  Great recipe to serve to guests as it can look fancier than it is.  I actually did half artichoke hearts and half broccoli tops.  I added black pepper and garlic powder and shook bread crumbs on top which I thought added color and tasted good.  Also, I did the half sour cream and half mayonaise.  I did have a lot of liquid around the whole thing in the pan, but I just lifted everything minus the liquid and served it on a plate.  Very good! Thank you for the recipe.

My husband commented that this meal was better than a restaurant! If you want to impress, this is the one. I added 3 garlic cloves, cut down on the mayo and added more sour cream. Be careful though not to use fat free sour cream; it makes it too runny. I cut the chicken into chunks and serve with rice. Fantastic!

WOW! This one is definitely a keeper.  I only changed two things (which is why I can only give it 4 stars) - I used 1/2 cup light sour cream and 1/2 cup light mayo, and added extra garlic powder and black pepper.          Also salted and peppered the chicken before I put the sauce on top.  This was absolutely delicious!  Be sure to squeeze all of the moisture out of the artichoke hearts before you add them.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I added a little garlic and put some bread crumbs on the chicken breasts because the first time I made it, it was very watery. Add the bread crumbs did not change the delicious flavor.

Wonderful recipe! This has just become one of my new favorites. Very flavorful, is great served with rice or noodles. I followed recipe then added 2 Tbsp of sour cream to make a bit more creamy and to cover the chicken completely. Excellent recipe, super quick and very easy!

When I first saw this recipe in a book I have called 2003 Quick Cooking Annual Recipes, I was iffy and made it one night because it is cheap. Everyone LOVED IT! The chicken is so juicy and the saucy is tart. It is a keeper for sure!!

Good flavor, but the chicken was rather rubbery though cooked as directed.  I think this would make a great topping on grilled chicken if placed on top and stuck under the broiler for a few minutes rather than cooking the chicken with the mixture.  Excellent taste to the topping though.

DH loved this dish but I think with a few modifications to your specific taste it could be superb. I used a variety of cheeses since I was trying to use it up and also halved mayo and sour cream. I didn't have garlic pepper so I added in minced garlic. Oh, and I mixed in some capers as well. I can't wait to try this with mushrooms!

Excellent recipe.  I didn't have garlic pepper so I used a little black pepper and garlic powder.  My wife told me not to lose that recipe.

Excellent Recipe, very tasty.  I took the advice of other reviewers, and used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo.  I also used marinated artichoke hearts, rather than the canned ones.  My only problem was that it was so white!  Next time I will run it under the broiler to adda little color before I serve it.

I thought this was pretty bland yet very salty. I rinsed and drained my artichokes but it was still very watery.  The chicken was moist but didn't really have any flavor but salt. I don't think I will make this again.

If you like hot artichoke dip, you'll love this chicken recipe.  I added fresh garlic and light mayo, but there is nothing light about this recipe.  It was very rich.  My kids would not eat it with the sauce on it.

This was good!  I used reduced fat mayo and replace half of it with reduced fat sour cream.  I also used freshly grated parmesan cheese and added 3 cloves of minced garlic instead of the garlic pepper.  I used the food processor to chop my artichokes and combine the sauce ingredients.  Next time I think I'll add the artichokes last so they're chunkier.  Also, it took about 1 hour to cook the chicken breasts.  Next time I'll pound them thin and saute in a little EVOO to give them a little extra flavor and color.  Overall, a great dish.  I served with rice.

This is SO EASY to make and tastes delicious! Like others I used half mayonnaise and half sour cream, and I also squirted a little lemon juice on the breasts before putting them in the oven. My best friend raved about this all night. Yum.

Like some mentioned it did get very watery. I also just let the water in the baking pan.  We really loved the taste. And the chicken stayed very moist.  I only used 1/2 cup mayo to 1 sour cream that made it not so much of a mayo taste.   I doubled the recipe next time I will only double the chicken not the topping there was a little too much topping making it rather too rich, I had to scrape a little off.  But my DIL & son loved it just as it was.

I didn't like this recipe at all. I had very high hopes for it but to no avail. It was too watery, and I used only a 6 oz can, and the mayonnaise was far too strong.

Different. Husband liked it, but he likes anything! I won't make it as much as I will everything else I have gotten from this site, but definately something to try! If you are skeptical about making it, don't use two cans of artichokes.

YUM!  I used light mayo, a liberal hand with the garlic pepper and an extra sprinkling of parm over the top.  I had large chicken breast halves, so gave it 40 minutes...I might even go 45 next time to give more time for the topping to brown.  The chicken threw off a lot of liquid...I just left the watery stuff in the pan and served the chicken with the stuff on the top.  Super easy and very immpressive.

The taste of this dish was FANTASTIC!  I increased some ingredients (1 cup light mayo and 2 cans artichokes) and also added about 1/2 c sour cream.  The only problem I had was the amount of liquid in the bottom of the pan.  Next time I will not only drain the artichokes, but will gently squeeze them in a paper towel to cut down on the liquid even more.  Either that or try them on a broiler pan.  My kids didn't like artichokes, so they didn't care for it.  But if you like artichoke dip, you'll LOVE this!

After much deliberation my DH and I have decided to give this a 5star.  It's very tasy but the ease of the recipe pushes it into the top notch.  I used half mayo (light) and half sour cream (light) and it was PLENTY creamy and rich enough.  I'll most definitely add this to the rotation!

I wouldn't say this was amazing, but I think it was b/c of the mayo.  It had this layer of grease on the bottom of the dish.  I added some sun-dried tomatoes, which was good, and am pondering how to tweak it for next time, since I like the idea of it, but wasn't totally thrilled with this one

I agree with using half mayo and half sour cream.  My family was very skeptical at first but all it took was one bite to change their minds.  When I told my husband I was making it again tonight i heard him say, "MMMM".

This was absolutely delicious!!! Very easy to make too.  I made more sauce by using 1/2 cup of mayo, 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1 cup of parmesan cheese.  I also seasoned the chicken first before placing it on the baking dish.  Accompanied it with steamed broccoli and garlic & olive oil couscous.  This is definitely a keeper!  Will be making it often.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

Good recipe but, as another mentioned, it needs just a little tweaking.  The sauce is a bit thick so I will try adding a bit of milk and maybe some canned chopped green chiles.

Quick, easy and tasty! I chose to use 1/4 sour cream and 1/2 mayo. Great suggestion!! My husband loved it--- He made a seperate "tomorrow's lunch" plate. I do recommend draining the artichokes throughly.. I didn't and it came out a little watery.

My husband and I loved this recipe. It's fantastic. We cut the amount of chicken in half since it's just the two of us, but used the same amount of artichokes, etc, leaving us with a little extra topping, which we enjoyed.

I thought this was very good.  I forgot the garlic, which was too bad because I found this a little bland.  Next time I think I'll actually sprinkle the chicken liberally with garlic powder and pepper and then I think it will be perfection!  Like others, I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup mayo.  Tasted great!  Took an hour to cook.

Wonderful. I used 1/4 cup of light mayo and 1/2 cup light sour cream. I also added breadcrumbs/butter to the top. I cooked for an hour and 15 minutes in a glass dish. It came out very moist. This is a keeper!

Very good.  Had this for dinner tonight.  I cut up the chicken pieces(boneless skinless thighs) and precooked them with some chopped onion, garlic, salt and pepper.  The using a slotted spoon, removed the chicken from the pan and mixed with the other ingredients (with some more garlic), put into a baking dish and baked for 30 minutes.  My husband and I really liked it.  My kids, well...  Thanks so much!

I may try it again but with very little mayo.  It was so overpowering.  I don't like mayo, but my husband does, and he still didn't like it.  He was nice enough to eat it, though.

I think this would have been better if I cubed or shredded the chicken breasts.  Overall, the topping was terrific with the artichoke/mayo/sour cream/parm cheese combo. I also added marinated roasted peppers (chopped) to the topping.  My picky kids thought it was just o.k.

I BRIEFLY grilled the chicken breasts just to sear the outside before putting them in the dish, thinking this would give it even more flavor. I also added roasted garlic to the mixture, but it still lacked the "wow" factor I was looking for.  This really is no big deal.

I made this for my husband, because we both LOVE artichokes. We ate it for two nights in a row for dinner. Then, we had an impromptu birthday dinner for my brother and his wife. So, we served it for night #3. It was so delicious and I will make this time and time again. It was perfect.

Great recipe!  I also used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 fat free sour cream, but added bread crumbs to the artichoke mix and baked it with smaller chicken strips like a casserole.  A favorite!!!

This is very nice and tasty. I used marinated artichokes, as another reviewer suggested and it was yummy. My husband and 2 year old daughter loved it. And my husband was certainly leery of the name, but plates were cleaned, even my daughter's and she's not much of a meat eater.

Unfortunately, this recipe is something I will never try again.  I made this dish with half sour cream and half mayo as recommended and my DH and I both found it terribly lacking.  One problem for us is that we are both used to eating highly flavored foods, and this recipe seemed to lack anything except the taste of mayo.  For those who like healthy meals, even with the adjustments I made including light ingredients, veer away. We were quite disappointed.

Yum!!   I liked this a lot, but my husband liked it even more.  His only suggestion was to make more sauce next time.  I did as others suggested and halved the mayo and added sour cream, then served on rice.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a really delicious and moist way to prepare chicken. I modified the advice of other reviewers and used mostly light sour cream with only about three tablespoons of mayonnaise. I used two small jars of artichoke hearts for a total of 13 ounces. I heeded others' advice and rinsed them off to remove the oil, using a strainer, before incorporating them into the recipe. I also used a package of chicken tenders because I didn't have any chicken breasts on hand. Finally, I forgot to add the lemon pepper, but it was just right in terms of salt.

I have to agree with others it was good the first few bits.  My family really didn't care for the sour taste. I don't think I will be making it again.  Maybe I would use the recipe for a dip by adding mozzerella cheese and chopped spinach.

This was good for the first couple of bites, but WAY WAY WAY too rich for me to continue to enjoy. It would have tasted better as a dip. My boyfriend seemed to like it so I am giving it higher stars than I would if I were rating it on my own.

Listen to the reviews.  Definately half the mayo.  I followed the recipe exactly and the taste was not very desirable.  I will try again halfing the mayo and using sour cream.

I loved this recipe!  I also used half sour cream and half mayo as suggested by others.  It tasted like Artichoke dip, which I love!!

Loved the salty texture the canned artichokes gave the recipe.  Beware....If you are watching your sodium intake be careful with this recipe.

This is a great dish, I took the advice of some of the other users and made it to my liking (even though it was great as is).  I figured out you could pretty much add whatever you want and it will still taste great!

EASY and YUMMY!  Thanks so much!!  I followed advice of others and did 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream in the artichole mixture b/c I am not a big mayo fan.  I also added about 1 lb chopped fresh mushrooms to the artichoke mixture as well.  My husband already asked when we're going to have this again!  :)

WOW!  This is sooo moist.  I gave this recipe to a chef friend and she raves about it.  I use low or no fat ingredients instead of the regular and it still is wonderfully moist.  The artichoke hearts are rinsed in warm water to reduce the oils.

I made this for dinner last night. It was good. I substituted the mayo w/ 1/2 fat free mayo and 1/2 fat free sour cream. I also used fresh garlic and fresh ground pepper instead of garlic pepper and added a little squeeze of lemon juice.
It's low cal and low fat and has a lot of flavor. I served it w/ white rice.
The chicken did need to be cooked longer than 30 minutes though. I'd say about 40 minutes with 2 small but thick breasts.

My husband was not looking forward to having this - He said it does not even sound good.I had to bake it longer because he was not ready to eat.I had left over artichoke dip I had made a couple days before and used that. It was so tender with very good flavor. Three times while my husband was eating he said "WOW this is really good".This is one way I would have never thought of to make chicken. 
Thanks for sharing your recipe

Very tasty.  I misread the directions and used garlic powder (a few shakes)instead of garlic pepper.  Still came out great.  Just needed a little salt when done.

While a good simple recipe, it was one my family didn't like bacause it was so rich.  I also messed a bit with it to give it some more flavor.  I put some lemon pepper directly on the chicken breast and added more than a pinch to the artichoke mixture.  While baking, I put lemon slices on top and that gave it a nice tangy flavor.  Not something I would make often, but once in a while for company.

I thought it was so special that I served it when Grand-son and his fiance came to dinner. I froze the leftovers and that turned out well also.  This recipe goes into my "Serve Often" collection. It is so great to have a recipe that I can assemble early in the day and bake later.

Only 3 stars because I over cooked the chicken, it was dry and the chicken was thinner than I should have made it. Otherwise, loved the flavor of the topping...reminded me of artichoke dip ontop of chicken. I did use a large jar of drained marinated artichokes which give more flavor. Used a little less that 1/2 c. mayo and about 1/2 c. of parm. Will try this one again.

I made this and it was a hit! The only thing I added was some mozarella & provolone cheese because I wanted to  use it up. I gave it to a friend and she said it was a hit too. I also put the mixture on haddock and added some capers and fresh lemon and it was another hit! Thanks for a quick and fabulous meal!

Easy and good. It came out well although I forgot the garlic pepper. Cook time was longer than stated for proper chicken internal temp, but the chicken I bought was pretty thick. Overall, my husband and I liked it.

I dont eat meat so I didnt try it myself, but my husband didnt care for it. It did smell delicious though. And, it looked very good too. Turns out just like the picture shows. My husband probably would have liked it though if I didnt tell him there were artichokes in it...he is afraid to try new vegetable. Easy to make though.

We always love artichokes, but as a whole dish, this one lacked something. The mayo seemed to not be quite the right binder somehow.  We always take a vote around the table on whether a new recipe is "box worthy." One out of four wants this dish again, but she qualified it with needing a few changes.  Sorry. We'll keep looking.

Terrific, easy recipe.  I used LIGHT mayo and just sprinkled the pepper directly onto the chicken before spreading the mixture on to cook. Excellent recipe, low cal and you can make it lower in fat if you use a light mayo!  Extremely good, my husband LOVED this!

This was yummy but I did make some changes.  I added some frozen spinach and did like the other reviews advised--I used sour cream with the mayo to measure the 3/4 cup.  Very good.  I will making this again.

Very Good! I used less mayo and sour cream...I would definitely brown the chicken first next time as my hubby commented that the chicken was bland compared to the topping!!

This was a huge hit at our house.  It is simple to make, uses few ingredients (which are always on hand) and is on the table in 40 minutes.  I have shared this recipe with several others and they have all enjoyed it.

This is just like another recipe I make - same ingredients minus the artichoke hearts.  It really makes the chicken moist and flavorful.  I like the addition of artichokes, as I'm a arti. freak!

This was just Ok for me.  It looked better than it tasted.  Followed  directions and other reviewers suggestions about substituting sour cream for some of the mayo, and to saute the chicken first.  It is not something I would make again.

A confusing meal. Artichoke dip atop chicken breasts - we wanted to eat it with crackers. It tasted fine, no one in our family would want me to make it again though. The chicken took a long time to cook through. I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream as recommended by others. An interesting idea, just not our style.

I didn't really like this that much.  Maybe I'm just not really fond of artichokes that much (strong flavor).  I ate it, but I won't be making it again (just not my type of recipe).

I work at an appliance store. Once a month a woman comes in to demonstrate a convection oven. She always uses recipes from allrecipes.com. Last month she cooked Artichoke Chicken. Everyone loved it. I tried it at home and it was just as delicious! Success at home!

My husband loved this. I used 1/2c mayo and 1/4c sour cream and added bread crumbs to the top. The topping was thick, but we liked it! I served it over pasta.

This recipe was fantastic!  I had to kick my husband under the table to have him stop talking about the ingredients, because my kids were tearing through the meal. They never would have willingly eaten artichokes.  My whole family loved it.  Also, it was so easy.  It took maybe 5 minutes to prepare and the rest was oven time.  Loved it, loved it, loved it!  Totally company worthy.

I love this recipe!  I generally cut the chicken into small, bite sized pieces and layer them into the bottom of the dish, then cover with remaining ingredients.  My husband really doesn't like my cooking, but he enjoys this dish.  The next time I cook this, I plan to try the sour cream version recommended by others.

Wow!  This was better than I had expected.  So simple, moist, and flavorful!  I used artichoke bottoms, shredded parmesan, and light mayonnaise.  It wasn't greasy at all as others had reported.  Maybe the light mayonnaise made the difference.

A bit thick,.. a little too much mayo flavor and I did cut it back with sour cream,.. tender and juicy but the topping was too much for my liking. My husband and daughter wouldn't eat it.

I really like this recipe...I did however make a huge mistake while making it...I put pasta on the bottom first and it soaked up all the juices.  I won't do that again...I used marinated artichokes and I did 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  My husband really like this dish..I will make it again.

I have had alot better chicken recipes.  I did as others suggested and used 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 mayo.  and it was O.K.   If they say that is better than just mayo. I couldn't imagine what it would be like.  Will not make again.

Was sent this recipe by a friend.  I tried it tonight.  It was not a big hit with my son.  However, since spinach is loved by everyone in the house, I'm going to try adding some spinach sauteed in olive oil and onions and use that instead of the artichokes.  (Artichokes are not the most loved vegy around here.)  Will keep you posted on the spinach version

Per previous reviews, I used half sour cream and half mayo.  Other than that, I stuck with the recipe.  My husband loved it as did I - my children, who are 8 and 10 did not.  I will make it again, but only for adults.

Fantastic success with this recipe! I have served it for a group of 12 and just for 2. It is a consistent success that inspires one to request a doggie bag when unable to finish.

I made this chicken tonight for the first time. I don't know why it received so many stars...it was just ok. There was nothing that was "WOW" about it. My 14 year old son enjoyed it though...until I told him I put mayo in it! Will I make this again? Probably not. But thanks for the recipe...it was different.

Wow - this was sooo good.  I did take others advice about 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  I did go a little heavy with the garlic pepper - I can never get enough of that stuff.  Thanks so much for a great recipe.

I choose to make the recipe using 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream and topped with seasoned bread crumbs as suggested by others and was very disappointed in this dish.  The chicken was dry and the "sauce" was too thick.  The only flavor you could taste were the artichokes. This was not a keeper for family.

Came out really yummy.  I used 1/4 c. lite Miracle whip and 1/2 c. lite sour cream instead of all sour cream.  I also baked it in a pampered Chef stone dish, which took almost an hour, but it comes out juicier.  Thanks so much, I'll be making this again!

Very good! I followed the advice of the other reviewers and used half mayo and half sour cream. I sauteed the chicken in butter and added mushrooms to the artichoke mixture. Marinated artichokes are the way to go..it would have been bland otherwise. I added paprika and tarragon and covered the whole thing with bread crumbs, baked it for 45 mins. wow..was it good!! definitely give this dish a try..you can vary it however you like!

Wow!  What a lot of reviews.  These kind of recipes are always worth trying I find.  I used half mayo, fat reduced, and half sour cream with 1 tbsp. flour stirred smoothly into the mixture so it wouldn't curdle and become watery.  I rinsed the artichokes well and gently squeezed out more liquid with my hands (clean!).  Used fresh garlic, fresh basil, freshly grated Parmesan as directed and sprinkled with smoked paprika for colour.  I don't like 'pale' food.  Served a side dish of pasta.  De-lish!  Thank you for this great, easy recipe that is ideal for a family or company dinner.

This did not turn out as expected.  The artichokes gave a very sour taste to the dish and even though they were drained, it made the dish very watery.

I've been looking for a way to use a large jar of marinated artichokes- this recipe will help me out!
We liked the recipe and tried it over penne pasta like someone suggested but there wasn't enough sauce.  The chicken did taste good though

Added a small bit of lemon juice and squeezed the juice out of the artichokes. It was really good but I have to admit I liked the sauce better than I liked the flavor of the chicken.

Yummy with a nice variety of greens as the side!  It was very moist with juices and a bit oily, but at the last 10 minutes removed half the juices/oils.  The last ten minutes really browned the top, as well.  I used crushed garlic/ginger combo.  I, also, used just 1/2 cup of parm cheese.  I will try low-cal mayo next time.  I can't wait for lunch today!

PS: Shred the chicken before hand ... use it as a dip!!  AND the recipe made enough for 6 servings (I fed this to two kids: 12 and 13 if that tells you anything about portions!)

This was absolutely delicious.  The chicken was very moist and tender.  Paired very nicely with the Orzo with Wilted Spinach and Pine Nuts.  Will definitely make again but I think I might try making it with light mayo to cut down on the fat and cholesterol.

Good flavor and it has potential, but the chicken was tough. Next time I will bake it longer, covered for a while, to see if that helps.

We loved this recipe!! The chicken turned out very tender even though we had to defrost it in the microwave because we forgot to do it prior to cooking. (Sometimes that dries out chicken) The only thing I would change is I would use less mayonnaise as it made it very rich and I would add more cheese. My boyfriend and I have a recipe box together of meals we love and this will definately be going in! Thanks!!

This recipe is really, really good.  I only had 2 chicken breasts so I reduced the mayo/parmesan cheese and it turned out perfect.  Will definitely make again - it is sooo easy to make - 5 mins to mix up the ingredients and into the oven for half an hour.  My husband absolutely loved it and wants it to become a regular ... :)  Thanks.

I love artichokes but I didn't care for this recipe at all!  It was way too rich for my stomach.  The chicken meat was bland unless you had a bite of the overly-rich artichoke mixture on top of it!

This chicken was delicious!!!  I had some friends over for dinner and needed to make something that was quick and easy.  My friends said that they have never had chicken taste so good, not even from a restaurant.  I will definately be making this again.

It was okay.  I took other's advise and used 1/2 mayo & 1/2 sour cream.  I also added capers.  It was very rich - basically chicken cooked in artichoke dip.  The chicken did come out very tender, but it is a little rich for my taste for just a simple chicken dinner.  It was also a little heavy handed with the artichokes.  I doubt it is something I'll do again.

This was a good chicken recipe. I also used 1/2 sour cream. Next time I think I will double the artichoke mixture to top the chicken with.

My husband likes it but it was just okay for me.  I used half sour cream and half mayo as other reviewers suggested and marinated artichokes.  Maybe that was the problem.  The artichokes were so overpowering.  Also added paprika on top.  I just think it would be better as a dip.  It was still good but I wouldn't make it again.

Easy recipe, but very heavy on the artichokes. I tried the recipe a second time with fewer, drier artichokes and found the recipe more interesting.

Used a garlic clove instead of garlic pepper and it turned out well.  Great idea for a recipe and I can see why a lot of people love it.  However, not something I liked well enough to cook again.

I love this as an artichoke dip, but was a little disappointed with how it came out on the chicken.  A litte too watery for my tastes.  Perhaps if we had put it over pasta that would have helped.  Next time I'll have the hubby grill the chicken and make the dip separately and put it on afterwards.

WOWEE!!! Like getting to eat an appetizer as your main course! This is delicious. I didn't have any "garlic pepper", so I used garlic powder & regular pepper- just a little each. The only other change was to bake for 40 minutes. This is low carb, too, if anyone cares!!! And so easy. Thanks so much for submitting!

This recipe was well-received and I would definitely make it again. The chicken breasts I had were very thick so I coated them in flour first and browned them in oil before I put them in the oven. I did notice that the artichoke mixture WAS a little thick and gloppy so I will try the sour cream next time to see if that helps. The Parmesan cheese added a nice touch because the topping got all nice and crunchy - really added a nice texture. Very flavorful, can't wait to make it again!

This was a bit rich for our taste, but very delicious. It was so easy and would make a nice presentation for a company meal.  My husband, who says he does not like artichokes, gobbled it up.

Like the artichokes & Parm cheese.  Added minced garlic.  Don't make the mistake of using light mayo or light miracle whip.

This recipe is very quick- and it was a big hit with the whole family.  I also used 1/2 mayo and half sour cream, and I also used 8 chicken tenderloins.  Served it over noodles.  Next time I may try to thin out the mixture a little.  This recipe is so rich I won't make it too often, but it's still a keeper.

This recipe was great!  Instead of using all mayonnaise, I used 50% mayo and 50% sour cream and it turned out so rich and delicious.  Also grated fresh parmesan which added to the flavor.  Will make again!  Quick and easy.

Very good!  took others suggestions and used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/4 cup sour cream.  I also added sliced mushrooms.  I pounded my chicken fairly thin so they did not take as long to cook, only about 20 minutes.

This recipe is really really good!  The chicken was very tender and the topping is great!  I asked my babysitter to put this together for me one night, and by mistake she used the entire package of breasts (8) instead of just 4.  It was still good, so if you have more than 4 breasts you can use them, it's still good.  One thing though... I was confused by "chicken breast halves."   I'm not sure if I was supposed to cut the breasts as they come in the package in half or not.  We didn't, but we did up the baking time to a full hour at 375.  It was still delicious and the breasts, even the big ones, were cooked to perfection.
