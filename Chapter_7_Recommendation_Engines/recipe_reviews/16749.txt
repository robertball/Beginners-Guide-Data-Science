Great recipe.  Very simple, tasted great!  I wanted another way to use my sweet sourdough starter and now I have one.
Everyone in the family (hubby and kids) loved them.  There were none left!
Thanks!

Enjoyed this very much.  Has a great flavor.  For some added flavor I added diced apples and cinnamon.  Also used Bisquick instead of buttermilk mix because that is what I had.  I think any pancake mix would work great. Wonderful!

I thought these were great.  Yes, they tasted a bit like sourdough, and they were light enough it was difficult to flip them, but we all loved the lightness and the sourdough flavor.  In fact, my 5 kids thought they tasted so good they didn't want syrup or jam on their pancakes.  This is a wonderful bonus...much less sticky!!  Now I'm going to go look for a homemade buttermilk mix recipe.

These were good pancakes... I don't know what everyone's problem is with them. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out great. Can't say much for the "butter" and "syrup" that was available to me at the time, but the pancakes themselves were quite good. My only problem was flipping them and they burn easily... but it was the first time I've made pancakes in years so that could be from lack of experience. We ate them all :)

Maybe it was the pancake mix I used, but I was expecting these to be a lot better.  The outside was tough and hard to cut and the inside was so airy that you didn't feel like you were getting enough bang for your buck.  The flavor was minimal, and I have a great sourdough starter.  The best pancakes are somehow light and fluffy and dense at the same time, and these weren't it.

I made these for supper the other night, and had mixed reveiws. I liked them, and so did my mother and father, but my younger brother and sister said that they were "gross". Whatever that means. I guess it just depends on personal taste. I will scale this recipe to serve just one though, and make it for just myself. I liked them quite well.

My family all loved these pancakes.  They have a slightly sweet and sour flavor, but not overpowering.  They melt in your mouth, and are slightly cake-like in texture.  I used a cup of my friendship bread starter on day 10.  I also used Bisquick.  I will make these AGAIN, for sure!

This is a good recipe for sourdough panckaes but I'm not a fan of sourdough pancakes and this recipe has not changed my mind.  Not bad tasting but certainly not good or great.  Sourdough bread is often heavy and likewise these pancakes are sort of dense and heavy...... not light and fluffy like normal pancakes..... and they have the characteristic yeasty/but sourdoughy taste which I don't think goes over too well in a pancake.  For pancakes lovers I'd stick with regular or buttermilk but I don't like sourdough.

These weren't very good. The batter was so thin it was hard to flip the pancakes. I won't make these again. Thanks anyway.

These were great! We added a dash of cinnamon to the batter. Little thin, maybe next time less water.

Oops, I didn't use the amish friendship bread starter.  I used sourdough starter II.  That could be the reason for lack of flavor.  These were ok. I like buttermilk pancakes better. My 2 1/2 year old son gobbled them up! The texture was kind of gummy inside. They did rise and seemed kinda blah tasting, even with butter and syrup.

I added cinnamon to the batter.  What a great way to use up friendship bread batter.

I have been a sourdough for years. I've never considered mixing starter with pre-made pancake mix. It was a wonderful marriage. I used Krustez. I will be making these again!

Very good, fluffy pancakes with a lovely sourdough taste. I added 1 tablespoon sugar and a couple of teaspoons of vanilla extract. It wasn't enough to make it taste like cake (unlike many pancake mixes) but just enough to smooth out the sourdough starter. Will definitely make again.

I used my regular sourdough starter and modified the quantities to make 4 pancakes  (2 people).  2/3 cup buttermilk pancake mix, 1/3 cup sourdough starter and aprox 1/2 cup water.  Turned out very good.
