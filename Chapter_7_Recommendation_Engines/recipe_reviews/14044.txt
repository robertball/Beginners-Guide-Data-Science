The first time I tried this I thought it was quite bland. The next time, I substituted salsa for the stewed tomatoes and loved it. I also doubled the stuffing ingredients for 3 large peppers, to make them more substantial. A great vegetarian main dish.

This recipe was really good, although it needed more spices. I changed some things but I think I kept the recipe essentially the same. First, I used regular rice and so I started cooking it on the stove a bit before I added in the tomatoes. I didn't use a microwave at all, but instead heated the peppers in the oven. I also added a little bit of garlic, black pepper, and cayenne pepper to the rice mix. This recipe was really really easy to make yet tasty... I am definitely going to make it in the future for company as a main dish. It's really hearty because of the beans, too!

This was my 1st time for stuffed peppers. They turned out great. I used 1 14oz can crushed tomatoes and 1 14oz can kidney beans. Then I changed rice to 2/3 cup. I also added a few dashes of Frank's red hot sauce. I used microwave to cook peppers, beans and corn. Cooked rice on stovetop and added all together. I baked in the oven at 325 for about 10 minutes then added cheese. I turned oven to warm until wife came home. She loved it. We froze remainder and looks like enough for 4 halves. Great easy recipe. Thanks Jen!!! Shady B

I was skeptical as I was preparing this meal, and surprised that it really was delicious.  It was hearty enough without meat.  I will make this again when I'm deciding to eat "meatless" but will make more of the filling per pepper.

This were really good and quick! I would have given this 5 stars, but I tasted the mixture before stuffing it into the peppers and thought it needed a little more flavor. So, I added a little cumin, black pepper, and paprika. They turned out great! I will be making these again. Also.. using red/orange/yellow peppers makes all the difference. My fiance who normally hates stuffed peppers, liked these Thanks for the recipe.

As a previous review said, the recipe was good, but DOES need a bit more herb/spice.  It's a great and tasty basic recipe with lots of room for improvisation.  Adding salsa would give it a little oomph and depth of flavor without complicating the recipe.  As it says- quick and easy.  Healthy and tasty.  Great for summer's garden surplus.  And busy families.

It was OK, other than the kidney beans not being cooked all the way.  It was missing some spices though, kind of bland.  Next time I will cook the beans longer and add some basil or something. Other than it was good.

Yumyum and so easy to prepare!  This recipe provided two "firsts" for me:  1)making stuffed peppers and 2)actually COOKING something in the microwave!  Fantastic dish and a wonderful source of fiber and alternative form of protein with the combination of beans, rice, and cheese.  I'm looking forward to sharing this recipe with friends and family.  Thanks for sharing it, Jen

This recipe is delicious, but it was the super simple microwave preparation process that pushed it up to 5 stars for me.  My only suggestion would be to use a larger glass baking dish and cook 4 peppers.  I had a lot of unused beans, corn, and tomatoes....four peppers would use up all the other veggie ingredients nicely.    

Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It's now my favorite stuffed pepper recipe and will be used frequently.

Very good!  I added a dash of cumin and seasoned salt.  I had to cook the brown rice, tomato, water mixture longer than the directions said.

These were delicious, but so hard to get cooked right in my low-watt microwave. Once it was done, however, the flavors blended and it was sweet and hearty at the same time. My husband didn't even complain about eating vegetarian! If there's any leftover stuffing, it tastes great as its own dip for tortilla chips, and I wager would taste good as a vegetarian burrito filling, too.

I changed this recipe. I cooked the peppers in the oven at 350. while the peppers heated up, i made the rice in the tomato liquid with water, to equal a cup. i mixed the tomatoes, cumin, garlic powder, salt pepper, onions, beans, red pepper flakes..i kept the peppers whole, just cut the tops off. i cut the extra pepper from the top and added that to the filling too. i put back in the oven with cheddar cheese and they turned out amazing :)

Quick and easy way to make stuffed peppers during the summer if you don't want to heat up the house w/ the oven (and live in NYC w/ no access to a grill).  Used leftover brown rice from another meal, used white onion instead of green, which added a lot of flavor, used diced tomatoes bc that's what we had, frozen corn, black beans instead of kidney, and chopped up a couple jalapenos we had sitting around.  It did need some more flavoring like some of the others mentioned, so I threw some cayenne pepper in, some red pepper flakes, chili powder, and some seasoning salt to taste.  Only had lite mexican shredded cheese, which worked perfectly.  My boyfriend loved it and we'll definitely be keeping this one around!

I really enjoyed this recipe! i was looking for a meat-free, but still filling and nutritious meal for a friday during lent. this was definitely a great choice. my mom's always made stuffed green peppers, which i'm not a fan of, but the red peppers were awesome!! i used some kind of canned italian diced tomatos with onions to kick up the flavor a little. this was a quick and easy meal that i'll definitely make again!

1st off, lil disclaimer: I didn't exactly follow the instructions/ingredients!  But I still feel qualified 2 rate this 5 stars bcuz I wouldn't have had the idea if this recipe wasn't here! I was looking 4 a quick meal while @ lunch break, couldn't use anything canned bcuz we don't have can opener @ wrk. So I used lentil soup (in a box), frozen spinach & marinated artichoke hearts. I topped them with a lil hummus & feta cheese. OMG, so so good!

I thought it was pretty good.  My husband, who is a very picky eater, wasn't too thrilled with it though.  He would have liked the addition of meet.  I used green bell peppers from my garden instead of red.

I have made this using Rotel type tomatoes and adding a package of shredded pre-cooked chicken (from HEB grocery meat case).  Left out the beans and corn.  The meat was already seasoned and the tomatoes gave it a bit of a kick.

Used salsa insted of stewed tomatoes, and used a couple cajun sausages insted of the kidney beans.  I also used left over white rice and baked in the oven not the microwave.  They were great, best stuffed peppers I've had (I usually hate them)

Delicious as written. But I made it a 2nd time with a few changes. I used canned diced tomatoes with chillis. i boiled the rice in a mixture of low sodium chicken broth and the juice of the canned diced tomatoes. I also fried onions in garlic and added to the rice mixture. Along with black beans instead of kidney beans and added 1 shredded chicken breast.  Black pepper and some cayenne pepper to taste. 
I pre cooked peppers in microwave for a couple of minutes or until soft as suggested. I then stuffed my peppers then put in oven at 350 for 25 minutes added the Parmasean and a slice of provolone cheese and put it back in the oven until cheese is melted. Great easy recipe!  Thanks Jen!

I was skeptical at first, for the simple fact that I don't generally like peppers, but these turned out surprisingly tasty!  They were super quick and easy to throw together after work, and very healthy/inexpensive.

I only rate the 4 stars though because the beans were not quite cooked through ("microwave times may vary", after all) and I added a few spices based on other reviews/my own assertion that the combined flavors might seem a bit bland.  Still, a great jumping off point to adjust to suit your own tastes and preferences.

Great yummy and easy dinner.  I too didn't use the microwave, but did everything in the oven and stovetop. I used real brown rice instead of instant. Instead of stewed tomatoes I used diced tomatoes with chipotle chiles. I think that added tons of great flavor. I omitted the corn since I don't like it and corn is not that healthy.  I also added fresh garlic and extra green onions.

I love these!  They are so easy and tasty and always a hit.  I roast the peppers in the toaster oven instead of the microwave.  I also use white rice instead of brown (just because that's what I always have around), and I use spicy salsa instead of tomatoes.  It's great!

very quick and easy.  But my wife did not feel the stuffing blended well with the taste of the pepper.  She also wanted some sort of sauce in the stuffing.

This was a quick and easy receipe to prepare, and it was delicious. You can easily add precooked/leftover beef or chicken in the final microwave stage to make this a hearty meal!

too spicy and too much kidney beans.  Other than that it was decent.  I won't use it as a main dish either.

This was my meatless meal for this week. I love the fact that this dish comes together so quickly and is made completely in the microwave. I will make it again, but I will add salt to the peppers as well as to the tomato/rice mixture. I will also increase the red pepper flakes and perhaps add some garlic.

This was super yummy once I tripled the spices because Flavor was the middle name I deserved but my family never gave me. However, red peppers apparently make everyone burp all night... not cute.

Great recipe.  I decided to do it the stove top/oven way.  Used basmatti rice, petite cut stewed tomatoes (garlic and olive oil) and chickpeas.  Added salt as well and both my mom and enjoyed them!!  Next time will try a "Mexican" twist with a salsa base.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Very good! I had to adjust the microwave times a little (I microwaved for less time than the recipe calls for), but it was quick, cheap and nutritious! I will definitely be making this on a regular basis.

I made this as a quick dinner after a long day and must say that it was excellent! I didn't use a can of stewed tomatoes, but instead - Rotel Tomatoes and Green Chilies to give it an extra kick. I prepared everything on the stovetop and baked the peppers in the over instead of microwaving them, then when I comnbined everything I placed it in my steamer with some fresh spinach leaves on the side. Turned out really nice!

Very good recipe, we substituted the kidney beans for left over black beans - great way to use our leftovers. As mentioned before, instead of stewed tomatoes we used salsa for more flavor. I think we will make this again.

Really really yummy. I made a few little changes, added some chopped mushrooms, salt and pepper and used Asiago cheese instead of Parm because that's what I had. I also used lower fat mozzarella. Really tasty, easy and I've never used the microwave to make a meal like that before. I will be adding this to my permanent recipe box. Thanks for posting it!

Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe!  My husband and I are always quite busy, and this is a healthy meal we can make quickly.  When making, I always add a little more of each ingredient that is in the filling so we have plenty to satisfy us.

Loved this recipe, use it weekly...made a few changes.  Used pre cooked brown rice, and combined the beans and rest of the ingredients on the stovetop (or microwave, depends on how lazy I am) and heated through.  Added chilli powder, cumin, garlic and onion powder.  Used mexican cheese blend and put the stuffed peppers in the oven/toaster oven for a few minutes.  You can also tailor this recipe to be more italian depending on the spices.

My daughter loved these. I did add in some garlic powder but otherwise stuck to the recipe. A very quick and easy meal that I can see me using a lot. Plus I get to use my microwave for something other than melting butter. Many Thanks.

Thank you for this recipe!  I didn't have any kidney beans in the kitchen, and it still turned out great.  It makes an excellent side dish, but could be used as a main course if you added meat.  I usually only use the microwave to heat things up, and this recipe allowed me to try microwaving veggies.

Really tasty, and quick. Thanx jen, this is some seriously pukka grub... I had to a adapt the recipe a bit for the normal, smaller sized peppers, by halving the amount of ingredients for the filling. I also used wiener sausages (sorry) instead of kidney beans which made it even yummier, along with a touch of oregano. I have never known anything so nice to come out of the microwave before.... nice one!

This is wonderful:  quick, easy and delicious!  I found I had to cook the quick-cooking brown rice longer than suggested, however; it was too chewy.  I will definately make this again!

These were the best stuffed peppers i've ever had!  And to be able to do it all in the microwave in no time - WOW - you can't beat that!  Thanks for this recipe!

Turned out great!!! I decided to bake it at the end because the peppers weren’t soft enough for my family.  Made some with rice and beans and the other ingredients and some without rice and beans.

Followed recipe except for adding Rotel instead of stewed tomatoes to kick it up a notch - like spicy. Will make again!

I will definitely make this again, possibly even later this week. My husband, a carnivore, really liked it. I keep trying to find tasty meatless dishes that he'll like but I'm rarely successful. He said he wouldn't have noticed it was meatless if I wouldn't have confessed when we sat down to eat. I stuck pretty closely to the recipe except for using salsa instead of tomatoes and added mushrooms to the rice. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

I loved this recipe. Following another member's suggestion, I added a Mexican twist. I used canned tomatoes with Mexican spices, chopped Cilantro, and a 2% milk shredded Mexican cheese blend. I topped it with sour cream. My husband loved it too.

The first time I made it, I liked it. But the second time- I LOVED IT! I added a little salsa(1/4 Jar) and used frozen mixed veggies. Then finished it by topping it with mozzarella cheese and bread crumbs then broiled it just enough to melt it. It tasted so "meaty" just packed full of flavor and the leftovers where even better!

These were ok. The peppers were a little to hard for me. I think they should have been nuked a few more minutes. I appreciated the quick version of this since I was in a rush and pressed for time but I think that I rather do these in the crock pot and have them super soft and delectable! So,I will make again when in a bind but with more adjustments to the time the cook in the microwave.

Very good, though I tried to keep the peppers whole and it did not work as well. Next time I will try to add some cheese to the stuffing as well as top them with cheese before baking.

I tried it and it was WONDERFUL.  I discovered after doing steps one and two that my can of kidney beans was really black beans.  They were very tasty!

I didn't like this recipe at all.  Yes, it was easy, but it was so bland.  This was one of the first meals I cooked for my boyfriend and we still laugh.

This is such an easy tasty reccipe!  It is a great side (just one half) and when my vegetarian friends come over for dinner, they love it as a main course!

the flavors didn't blend together as well as I hoped.  I don't know if I would continue the microwave method, I would prefer the oven.

I used red and orange peppers and they were a bit sweet so sticking to green might be a good idea
