I made this delicious salad 3 times in the past week, once for 50 people, once for 20 people, and once for my family. To a person, they all raved about it, and I had MANY requests for the recipe.  I did coarsely chop the pecans to make them more evenly distributed in the salad.  Even my 20 month old granddaughter couldn't get enough!

A nice easy but delicious green salad! I followed the advice of other reviews and tossed the pecans with some butter and brown sugar in a pan. I used a raspberry vinegar that I made and didn't find it to be bitter at all. I also only used 4 tbsp of olive oil and added a splash of lemon juice. I will definately be making this one again!

This was an absolutely delicious salad. I had many requests for this recipe at the pot luck I brought it to. If I could have given more stars, I would have. On a side note, I don't believe reviewers should knock a recipe down because "of the high fat content". If that were the case, all pastry,cookie,salad dressings etc would have to be downgraded. We don't need nutrition police in the reviews, we are perfectly capable of checking out the nutritional guide ourselves. Now I will step down from my soapbox :-)

This has become a family favorite. I use less oil--4 T and I ALWAYS put the feta cheese on last.  I put it on before the dressing once and it doesn't taste as good.

I've used this recipe mulitple times in the last few weeks for different gatherings and it is a major hit every time.  Everyone asks for the recipe.  I used balsamic raspberry vinegar and goat cheese since that's what I had on hand and it was delicious.

Really delicious but I had to give 4 stars, not 5, due to the very high fat/calorie content.  This is a great recipe for special occasions :-)  I did modify the dressing to include some garlic powder and lemon juice (two essential elements for any dressing to remove some of the oil taste).  I think you could also stretch out the lettuce needed to 10 cups or so.  I used candied pecans (skillet fry pecans with spray butter and brown sugar) and blue cheese.. Delish!

I have served this salad, made with Greek feta, twice in one week and received rave reviews both times.  Everyone seems to love it.  What does it mean when, at the end of a sumptuous meal, people are still talking about the salad?

I absolutely love this salad and have served it many times at gatherings.  Although fond of raspberry, I prefer to use just a basic homemade vinegrette

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  I used a lite bottled raspberry vinaigrette and added julienned granny smith apples for some sweet tartness.  I would go easy on the red onions next time (maybe use 1/4 an onion?).  I also used candied pecans.  This salad is a nice balance of sweet, tart, tangy, and savory.  It was a great start to a heavy meal.

Pecans can be toasted with brown sugar in saucepan on stove over low heat, stirring frequently.  We live in TX so always looking for ways to leave the oven OFF!  We use craisins/red onions or green onions/reduced fat feta/sugared pecans.  We don't like dijon mustard so we use balsamic dressing (purchased or make own with a pinch of salt, pepper, balsamic vinegar, and light oil such as almond or safflower).  We eat green salad every night for dinner and sometimes get in a rut for toppings. This is always a nice refresher.

This was a nice salad.  The combination of cranberries, pecans, red onion and feta with the raspberry dressing was very good.  I cut back on the salt and increased the sugar a little.  I also thought the oven temperature of 400 for toasting the pecans was too high.  I always do mine at 350 for the same amount of time, 8-10 minutes.  At 400 they could easily burn.

Lovely salad. I used baby spinach and romaine and I used shallots instead of red onion. I thought the dressing was a little too salty, so I would recommend decreasing to just a pinch. Toasting the pecans is a "must," they are so delicious.

This is a restaurant quality salad.  It's worth the extra trouble to toast the pecans.  I used balsamic vinegar because I didn't have raspberry vinegar on hand, and it was excellent.

One of the first recipes I'd ever used from this site and it came out great.  However, watch the warming time on the pecans!  I found they were ready much faster.

Absolutely wonderful! Very indulgent toss!  Eye and palet pleasing too; a real star on the table!  You can play with this recipe, just make sure you keep an even balance of sweet and savory flavors!  Throw some shelled pumpkin seeds and golden raisins in too.  I made my own rasberry vinegrette, but again just make sure you have an even balance of flavors as it can easily come out too sweet!  Now watch it disappear!

I made this salad for the first time for a company luncheon. The presentation was beautiful and the salad was a big hit. Very flavorful. I mixed the salad dressing a day ahead and it was even more delicious the next day as I poured it over the salad right before mealtime. Absolutely delicious!

A family favorite of ours and passed around all the families that ever try it. We use a high cal version with caramalized pecans. Soaking the dried cranberries into the oil helps too I think.

Great Salad.  I did cut the oil in half though, and added some garlic powder to the dressing.  I also made candied pecans.  Very good, easy salad.

I have made this for Christmas parties and families reunions. I made it exactly according to the recipe. It is ALWAYS a hit and I always have to share the recipe. One family is now hooked on cranberry salads as a result.

I love the mixture of the ingredients in the salad, but the dressing was a little too tart for me. Next time I'll add some extra sugar.

I thought this was great! I agree that it has too much of an oil taste with the olive oil, and in the future I will leave it out and add extra raspberry vinaigrette instead.

I made one change to this recipe and that is to add 3 tsps of sugar rather than one to the dressing. The salad is one of my favorites!

I've made this salad 3-4 times now.  It's so easy to make with packaged washed greens.  Toasting the nuts enhances their flavor.  I would recommend serving the dressing on the side unless you anticipate that the salad will be eaten at one sitting.  Otherwise, the greens become kind of limp.  I have used feta and blue cheese and like the feta better.  Because I make this frequently, the last time I quadrupled the dressing so I will have it on hand.

How easy and simple this one is! Tastes great, looks beautiful and can be put together quickly. I like to vary between feta and blue cheese but like the feta just a bit more. Also, I chop up the nuts so they are easily distributed.

I've been making this recipe for years and everyone, especially me, loves it!  Sometimes I use just spinach and add fresh strawberries in season, and other times I use a power greens mix.  Delicious!

Excellent salad. No changes made to the recipe. In the future we will be making again and try some other cheeses such as goat or blue cheese for variety but enjoyed immensely as is.

This was a very tasty, refreshing salad.  I just used some store-bought raspberry vinaigrette from the refrigerated section since I was running low on time, but it worked just fine.  I would recommend this as a light dinner salad.  Very tasty!

This is a wonderful salad!  I put the feta on the side for the people who aren't fond of feta.  My mother, who generally only likes bagged iceberg lettuce salad, loved this, so that says a lot!

A great salad - company fare for sure. I took the advice of other reviewers and candied the pecans, and used less oil (4 tbsp). I did use the feta cheese, and next time will try the goat cheese recommended by others. just for a different taste.

This came out great for me. I used candied pecans (and chopped them per other reviewers advice), craisins, and raspberry balsamic vinegar (all my market had). Was very good and got many compliments - even my husband liked it and he does not like sweets. Thanks!

Yum! I used red wine vinegar instead of raspberry. Will make again because it's fast!

This salad is great as it is but I have added chopped pears and a few chopped strawberries.  I think an avocado would be good as well.
I thought the raspberry infused vinegar was perfect, but if you would like something a little stronger, add 1-2 Tbsp of frozen Cranberry Juice Cocktail concentrate.

Delicious recipe, flexible/forgivable as well!
I didn't have raspberry vinegar so I used white wine vinegar and some raspberry jelly, omitted the additional sugar. Added goat cheese, avocado and praline pecans - yum! Served it on mixed greens with a piece of salmon

Such an easy and fast salad that tastes so great.  I couldn't find raspberry vinegar so purchased Renee's Ravin Raspberry Vinaigrette.  Soaked the craisins in the vinaigrette as someone else suggested and made candied pecans from the recipe on this site.  Great salad - thanks.

Substitute 1 Tbs vinegar + 1 Tbs raspberry jam for the raspberry vinegar in this recipe. Super yummy mix!

Salad is great, but oil-to-vinegar ratio of 6:2 is too much oil. I used 6:6 and it turned out much better. Though ingredients in the salad can be interchanged, which is nice.

I turned bitter undesirable mixed greens into a hit with this recipe.  Thank you! Instead of the walnuts I used pumpkin seeds and it still came out great.  Also found most of the ingredients at Big Lots for all the thrifty shoppers out there like me.

The dressing was too strong on the vinegar. Had a bitter taste to it. I doubt I will make it again.

I've made this many times over. Everyone always loves it. I use crumbled goat cheese instead of feta.
