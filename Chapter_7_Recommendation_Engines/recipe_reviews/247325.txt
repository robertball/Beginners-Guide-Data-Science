I absolutely loved this dessert! It can be tricky to find desserts without refined sugar or dairy. I did cut the spice down to half to satisfy my guests however, I plan to make it for myself as written. For the compote, I used frozen fruit. For the cream, I used 1 tsp of vanilla extract in place of the beans, added 1 tsp of fresh lemon juice and I will most likely use maple syrup in place of the honey because it didnâ€™t want to blend. I garnished with a sprinkle of homemade granola. This could easily be used as a jam and would be a wonderful topping for ice cream or granola or anything. Thanks for sharing!
