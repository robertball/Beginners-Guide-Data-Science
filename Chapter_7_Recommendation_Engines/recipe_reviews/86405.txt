I followed the recipe completely except we couldn't find the kikomans sauce so I used KC Masterpiece Honey Teriyaki marinade.  It was great! I have filed this recipe in our family favorites.

This recipe is what I see as a good jumping off point for a great dish. The changes I made were to give it more flavor and a bit of a spicy kick. When cooking the chicken I added about 1/2 tbs. of chili paste, 2 tsp. of crushed garlic, and a few squirts of Siracha. Then when frying the rice I used Yoshidas Sweet Teriyaki sauce, about 2 tbs. of soy sauce, and then added a little bit more Siracha. The result was a fabulous flavor.

This dish turned out a little bland for me.  I was expecting more flavor...I added a lot more Garlic Teriyaki sauce that the recipe called for and still found it lacking in flavor.  It would have been better with chili paste.  I'm not sure if I'll use this same recipe again.

This was alright. Nothing too exciting. We made more chicken than it called for and therefore added more sauce. We also added another egg. I used jasmine rice which worked fine.

This is a good base recipe. You'll probably want to add more teriyaki or soy sauce because it's a little bland with only 3 TB of flavoring to 4 cups of rice + meat/veg. If the taste isn't quite right to you, you may want to consider adding: sesame oil, oyster sauce, soy sauce, Sriracha, ginger, black pepper. These are all flavors that show up variously in fried rice across the board and everyone's used to something different :)

We thought this was a delicious meal.  Follow the advise from the other reviews.  Alittle more teriyak needed,  I added ginger, fresh garlic ( I didn't have garlic teriyaki, just teriyaki, actually didn't know of the other) and red pepper flakes.  Turned out great, alittle sweetness from the teriyaki and alittle spice from the red pepper flakes,  YUM !!  Oh yeah, also added frozen peas when chicken was cooking, added great flavor.   Rice should be cold, in a hurry, spread on a cookie sheet and put in fridge while cooking meal.

This was good, and as I am a vegetarian I used tempeh that I had marinated in teriyaki sauce instead of the chicken with good results. I agree that a little extra teriyaki could be added to the rice to give more flavor.

This was a nice fried rice.  I added a little more of the teriyaki, and served it with soy sauce.

My family loved this and ate every bit. I used brown rice and a "30-minute" type of teriyaki marinade.  The marinade added a nice flavor.

Did not like. The marinade gave it a bad taste. Next time I will do as I always do and use soy sauce.

This was really quite good. I doubled the amount of chicken so doubled almost everything else too. I only had 3 green onions so I used half of a yellow onion too.  I used two eggs, about 4 tablespoons of (olive) oil, a clove of minced garlic and about 4 tablespoons of sauce too. Next time I think I would season the chicken before stir frying for a little more flavor. All in all, a keeper. Thanks!

We made this last night as a side dish.  I substituted 1/4 of an onion for the green onions, added 1 stick of celery, and didn't add egg or chicken.  It was still yummy!!

I was surprised to see how good it was. And not only that but also really simple to make. I added in more vegetables like peas and spinach and added A LOT more sauce than the recipe called for. Next time id like to try it with fish or shrimp.

I doubled the recipe & used avocado oil. I also used a tablespoon of garlic mixes into the teriyaki. I also used a regular onion, not green & added dried ginger.

Fast, easy, tasty.  Perfect meal.  I use brown basmati rice.  Enjoy.
