This recipe is the best.  It looks like a lot of ingredients, but it goes fast. It appears to be a lot like another recipe however this is the perfect combination of creamy and smooth. There’s a hint of cinnamon making it rather mysterious.  My husband loved it so much he requested another, and this never happens with sweets for him!  I still can’t get over the perfect taste of the crumb topping with the creamy smooth muffin and liquid popping blueberries.  I wouldn’t change a thing.

They were nice but I used gluten free flour and they were a bit dry, I will be making them again but I will use all purpose flour.
