This is so freaking good, I ate it for lunch and dinner. The recipe is flawless. There is nothing to tweak, change or fiddle with. It's perfect as is. All the flavors are a perfect blend and the textures just hit the spot. Thank you for the recipe.

We thought this was a GREAT breakfast today!  We had extended family over, and we all thought it was very good and that the tomato mixture along with the guacamole made it!  I did use a package seasoning to marinate the steak before grilling it but thought it actually needed a bit more flavor than what that mix imparted.  I'd be tempted next time to visit the nearest Mexican restaurant to pick up some meat!  I had to forego the red pepper flakes because of family members' needs.  This was perfect!  Thanks, b.d.weld!

Another great recipe provided by Brian Weld for our Hunt's Campaign.  This was amazing.   The only thing I added was a little salt.  Great job Brian
