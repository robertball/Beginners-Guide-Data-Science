These were amazing. We really liked these. We loved the jalapeno cream cheese. I made it as written and will be making these again for football snacks. Loved it!

The recipe sounded interesting, but turned out amazing. They had much better flavor then I expected.  My husband raved over how tasty they were. I made a couple of changes. I used plain cream cheese and finely chopped fresh jalapenos instead of the jalapeno-cream cheese.  I used a mixture of black beans and roasted corn to replace the chicken. The cream cheese, the Borden cheese, and the fresh jalapenos really made these stand out. I will definitely be making these again.

Delicious and superclass. I made no changes at all. Next time, I will fry them as that is just our preference.  As is, great!!

These were a nice afternoon snack. Very easy to make and very tasty. I really like the fact that they are baked and not fried. I added some fresh rosemary to the mixture before adding it to the wontons for some flavor. I did not use the soy sauce for dipping but that is just a personal preference as even the low sodium is quite salty to me. Next time I would flip them to brown them on both sides about 7 minutes in. They took 14 minutes to bake.

Delicious and so easy to make! Substituted lobster for the chicken and still fantastic. The cheese mixture is perfect. A must try and a must keep. Thanks for the recipe!

While this isn't my favorite recipe, with a few changes I think it could be. I don't like the mushiness of the filling. It needs more texture, like not using the food processor, but instead, shredding the chicken & then add other ingredients by just hand mixing them. I would also add just a little bit of sugar to the cream cheese for flavor. Just didn't have much flavor to me.  Sorry!
