I have used this recipe for years, but there is one little difference. I add a scant teaspoon of salt. It helps the taste of the crust.

The title says it all...awesome.  I used the butter flavored shortening like another reviewer suggested.  Worked perfectly.  Thanks for the post.

Thank you! Thank you!
I didn't grow up in North America and was therefor not familiar with making pies. Since I married a Canadian an am living in Canada I tried repeatedly to master the pie crusts. Usually my pie crusts didn't turn out so great, so I usually used the pre-made frozen or the Pillsbury one, which is not too bad. Yesterday I tried out this recipe with Chicke pot pie and this has been the yummiest crust. Even my 6-year old ate 2 pieces of the pie and the crust, which she used to leave behind on the plate. It really worked for me. Now I feel I can finally make a pie that is completely homemade and I feel this is a great achievement. Thanks a million, it went into my keeper box.

Nice recipe with an accurate proportion of ingredients...except for the salt.  Unfortunately, then, while the egg gave it richness and the vinegar (I used vodka) flakiness, it lacked taste.  I think it could use a teaspoon of salt instead of the 1/4 teaspoon called for.

This is a great no fail pie crust. I went on the advice of another reviewer and used butter flavored shortening and it turned out great.  This is now my stand by pie crust!  Thanks so much for sharing!

Excellent Recipe!  I used butter flavor shortening for a little more richness and color, and it turned out beautifully.  (Gets raves!)  Also, as reported it is enough for a double crust pie and an additional single (I used the extra to make a quiche.)

Also my mother's favorite - easiest crust I've ever made.  Best if you chill the crust before baking.

I would give this recipe 10 stars if possible!!  There is simply no way to screw up this recipe.  It is the best EVER pie crust recipe I have ever made.  I make quite a few pies at a time and this is so simple.  I use the butter flavored shortening and it gives the best flavor.

This was very good and easy to do. That says a lot because though I am a good and experienced cook, pie crusts was an art I failed in over and over again. It was simply embarrassing. I've made this a couple of times and the only thing I decided to do differently was add a bit more salt, which is odd coming from me. If you read all my reviews, I usually say I eliminated the salt because I don't like it. It just had an odd flavor to it, and when I added 1/2-1 tsp it tasted much better. For meat pies anyway. I used this for a chicken pot pie recipe that is to die for and this crust is perfect for it. Thanks Lenn for sharing!

This was my first pie crust ever.  Of the myriads of recipes, I chose this one because I had the shortening sticks already in 1 cup measures!  It turned out well.

This was the best recipe for pie crust I have ever used. The only thing I changed is I substituted butter instead of shortening and it came out so flaky! :)

I have used this pie crust since I was a member of the Young Homemakers of Texas.  My recipe was always good, but this one is the best.  It is truly a NO FAIL pie crust.  It keeps for months in the freezer.  I keep ready rolled crusts for quick deserts.  I highly recommend for inexperienced bakers.

I'm so glad I tried THIS one as it's title is true to its words.. it didn't fail me! Made this to go with the Creamy Pineapple Pie from this site and it was excellent. Rolling out between two pieces of waxed paper is key - otherwise, the dough kept tearing on me. Thanks for posting!

So easy to make and it tasted delicious. Do make sure to refrigerate it a bit before you try rolling it, or it will be a sticky mess. Also it says it makes 3 pie crusts, but I got only 2 out of it. That was fine because it was what I needed.

For me, pie crust has always seemed daunting.  This one was so simple to make! I used butter flavored shortening which worked wonderfully and I was impressed by how easy it was to cut the flour into it (butter always gives me issues).  I usually hate crusts and this one I loved! It was a bit hard to roll out but I just had to flour the surface a bit more to keep it from sticking.  Overall, I am super satisfied and will be using this recipe forever!

A bit more difficult to work with than my usual recipe (without vinegar).  The taste was good, however I had difficulty achieving the proper elasticity.

Excellent recipe!  Tip - do not over mix the dough (any pie crust recipe) or it will be tough.   Try this with King Arthur Flour, it increases the flakiness. (I didn't believe flour made a difference till I tried it)  You can add 1/2lb of butter to this dough, and roll out dough and cut into 4" squares. Dab a bit of raspberry jam in the center of each square, fold corners up and lightly seal. Sprinkle with sugar and bake at 350 till brown. Delicious raspberry tarts.

While visiting my daughter and family in Misawa Japan, we decided to make an apple pie.  They have wonderful apples here, very large and flavorful and crispy.  Just right for a really good apple pie.  So not having my recipe here I used this one and found it to be easy to make up and roll out. Made plenty for a large 2 crust pie and was very flaky and and tasty.  I will make it again when I get home.  I was extreemly wet here as we had a typhoon just east of us for 3 days.  So it will work in all tempertures and wet conditions.

I have never made pie crust from scratch before and was totally intimidated by the concept. I read a variety of recipes and discussions on what fat to use, water vs vinegar, etc, and finally settled on this one as it was the most straightforward. I made it as written except I used half shortening and half butter, and I put the fats in the freezer for an hour before cutting them into the flour and salt. The crust was amazing- very flaky and light, yet sturdy enough to stand up to a hearty apple pie recipe. I will use this as my go-to crust for sweet AND savory pies from now on.

I found this recipe in a magazine in the 70s and have been making it ever since.  The recipe I use says to put 1 egg in a 3/4 cup, add vinegar (I vary between 1tsp and 1 tbsp) and fill with cold water.  I started using butter flavored shortening when that came out.  I use about a tsp salt in my recipe.  I add 1-2 Tbsp sugar if making a fruit pie.  It browns nicely and is crispy on top.  I have won a number of 1st prizes for my pies and it's always this crust.

I LOVE this piecrust recipe! My mother was widely admired for her wonderful piecrust, but I have never been able to duplicate it successfully. When I found this recipe about eight years ago, I knew I had found a keeper! I just made three huge pumpkins pies for Thanksgiving with this by doubling the recipe ... Three very large, deep crusts plus a leftover large piece. I follow the recipe strictly but I don't chill it - I use it immediately. It rolls like a dream! I'll never try any other piecrust recipe!

I am a pie crust snob - I didn't expect this to work at all, or stand up to my standard pie crust,  which I've been making for over 10 years. I was tired though and looking for something that might be easier, although with little hope of the results. I made it exactly as the recipe states although I did roll it out between sheets of parchment paper as it was more wet that I'm used to making - it was easy to make and tasted great. This will be the one I use from now on!

I can't imagine what I did wrong but it turned out like pizza dough instead of a pie crust. I followed the directions exactly. I guess the rain must have had something to do with it. Chess pie will have no crust because I wasted an hour trying to fix this one.

Thank you!! I used to fail with pie crust, until I found this recipe! This dough is very easy to work with on floured surface after refrigerating 30-60 minutes. It's my new go-to recipe, with a couple minor changes. I mix in 1 tsp. of salt with egg, water & vinegar.  And I use butter flavored shortening, it just tastes better in my opinion.

Used this recipe for a chicken pot pie this afternoon and it was very flaky. The color was rich and layered; not flat. I should have added a little more salt as one reviewer did but I try really hard not to use salt if my pie has been salted. Also, I had to add a tbls more water to get the ball formation. Easy to shape and roll out. A beautiful crust with great texture. I am going to use this again for a cherry pie and see how it goes with fruit.

Good recipe. I used it to make beef and vegetable pies once and also to make sausage rolls. Actually it is a perfect dough for sausage rolls. 1 recipe is enough for 1lbs of sausage meat.

Definately an easy first-timer pie crust.  Used it to make Chicken Pot Pie IX from the site.  Was great.  Turned out flaky and had nice golden color to match.  Dough was very easy to work with.

Came out badly, did not roll out well & mult. cracks & tears! Very disappointing. I followed all instructions and hints. Used Crisco butter flavor, tho1 cup seemed excessive; It felt fine until kneading, then it seemed not enough flour in mix. Maybe water was too cold, or not enough water - latter is diagnosis according to cooking site & book. I've never made such a torn up ugly crust + not big enough for the dish! I'm known for excellent hand made pie crust & pies, so this is a real setback. Also think, if you are using an acid, orange juice or tangerine would make crust taste better than white vinegar. I used the 1 tsp. of salt as many suggested. Searching for new pie crust recipe again!

This pie crust was easy to make and perfectly flakey. I agree with other reviewers that it needs a full teaspoon of salt instead of a quarter. I baked one pie crust right away and refrigerated the other half of the dough four days before baking. The second crust was just as good and flakey as the first.

I was surprised how easy it was to make.  The only change I made was using the Kitchen Aid to stir the dough, rather than the recommended fork.  It worked great.  Easy! :)

I will be making this again and again. I read all the reviews and so I added 1/2 tsp of salt instead of 1/4th tsp of salt.  I really like it. The dough came out flaky and tasty. I had vegan butter so I used the vegan butter mixed with the oil filling the gaps of the measuring cup, if that's understandable. I'm making this pie crust from now on.

Made a scratch blueberry pie using this crust. Now, I cooked for years, and the only use for my pie crust was resolving flip flops. it was leathery and solid. My pie was incredibly delicious. My wife, the ex cook, and my in-laws almost passed out it was so good!! I used coconut oil as shortening along with all organic flour eggs and vinegar. it was light, short, and wonderfully crisp. Tomorrow, I'm making chicken pot pies with it. expecting a marvelous experience. Took a whole fifteen minutes to make four crusts (not rolled yet). And tools all rinse clean for the dishwasher!! If there were ten stars, I'd use them all.

This recipe is almost exactly like my mom's.  I don't know how she did it, but she could get four crusts from one batch.  Paper thin and sooooo flaky and delish.  Someday I hope mine is as good as hers, but in the meantime, I keep plugging away at this recipe because none come close.

One kick butt pie crust recipe.  I followed it exactly as written except used apple cider vinegar because I didn't have white.  It was so flaky.  Next time I'm going to try the butter flavored shortening just to see if that makes any difference.

This turned out perfect and was so easy to work with! I've been nervous about pie crust for years and decided to try it out this year. Couldn't be happier!

I tried this tonight because I did not have butter in the house, it was good. I think it would be better with butter flavored shortening as other reviewers stated. It had a great flakiness too!  Will use this recipe again.

I have used this crust for lemon meringue pie, minus the meringue, and it was great, I've also used it for a sweet potato pie, and it was also great. I think my search is finally over. This truly is a nice, and easy labor free pie recipe...thanks

I never thought I could make a decent pie crust, but this was a hit with our dinner guests AND my husband, who loves pie! A couple changes I made - we only use whole wheat flour, plus I used real butter (unsalted) and we only had apple cider vinegar in the house. It was still a hit - and our elderly neighbor lady said she was jealous of my pie crust!!!!!! :-) Definitely a keeper!

Easy, nice flaky crust, although why I made the full recipe is beyond me.  I wanted it for the steak and ale pie with mushrooms I made for the bf and I only used half of it for that.  Oh, well, I will find some other use for the rest.  I like the taste but am not so keen on the fork method--using my hands always works the best for me (barring the cutting in the butter part--the pastry blender is one of my favorite kitchen tools!), and indeed, I gave up on the fork and just mixed it by hand there at the end.  This recipe calls for more shortening than I'm used to, but it does end up nice and flaky.  thanks for the recipe!

I found this recipe many, many years ago in a newspaper since I had never had any luck making a good pie crust (my daughter made a really good one). I thought I would try this one. The thing I liked best about it was the fact it was so easy to work with and it alway came out nice and flakey. It is a wonderful recipe. Enjoy.............

I had never baked a pie before, let alone made my own pie crust, so I was somewhat apprehensive going in, but I had fresh strawberries and rhubarb from the local farmer's market, and figured, why not try?  And this recipe lives up to its name!  If I couldn't screw it up, nobody can!  I even thought, vinegar?  How odd.  But it turned out flaky and delicious.  Even my mom, who bakes pies all the time, was impressed, and my dad raved over it.  I used butter flavored shortening, too, for added flavor.  I will definitely make this again.

This pie crust was just okay. It didn't want to roll out for me after refrigeration, and then it was way too crumbly. I had a hard time getting the dough to roll out smooth and not crack and separate.  I think I will just stick to my own pie crust.

This is a delectable pie crust.  My co-workers said it is the best pie crust they have ever had.  I think it is the vinegar.  Easy to roll out, easy to work with.  I tried it with a pecan pie-which has a longer bake time-and it didn't get overly golden.  Made it with a sour cream apple pie with less bake time, and that was great too.

Took forever to fork into a ball. Maybe because I took the butter straight from the freezer. Refrigerated overnight and rolled out next day. Came out great. Hubbs loved the crust.

Tasted great!  However, it doesn't have any directions for baking.    I had to add water, as it was crumbly without more.  It also was a huge stretch to use for three pies.  I would say perfect for two.  Lastly, they shrunk lower than the rim of the pan.

I have used this recipe for 40 years and I am always asked to bring the pies for occassions. I use Crisco shortening, but I substitue part of shortening with softened real dairy unsalted butter  because it tastes better than the flavored stuff.  In addition, I use a circular zippered clear plastic case to roll the crust as thinly as I can without it losing its integrity. Wax paper works also, but the thinner crust bakes to perfection and helps the waistline.  I also brush the crust with milk using a pastry brush. An unused  chip brush for painting works also.

I'm getting a head start on Thanksgiving pies and tried this recipe. It is very, very easy and comes out light and flaky. I absolutely will make this my "go to" recipe from now on. Note: I got two deep dish crusts from this recipe.

Made it exactly as recommended with a tsp. of salt as suggested by several cooks who used this recipe. Very easy. Made two shells. I used it for Pumpkin pie which shall be tested within the hour. 

Both my husband and I remarked that the crust was "un special" taste wise. By day two, it tasted like old crisco. It sure held up well, given that the pie was pumpkin. I'd use it for a savory pie but not for a fruit pie. Sorry.

I love this recipe!
It was flaky,  easy to work with and had a wonderfully light flavor. 
Made it with butter flavored crisco.

Yep! No fail indeed, and it freezes very well. To make it vegan I replace the shortening with coconut oil and replace egg with 1 tbsp ground flax and 3 tbsp water. Love this recipe!

This was the best pie crust I have ever made! It was flakey and very good tasting.  My husband and son also thought it was very good. Thanks for the recipe. I was skeptical about the egg and vinegar, but it was great!

Beautifully flaky and easy to work with crust. The only change I would suggest would be to increase the salt to at least 1/2 teaspoon because there is no flavor in shortening. With that change, I think this is my new favorite. My previous favorite has been a similar recipe that I've made for years, but is a five-crust recipe. This recipe is great to make a one or two crust pie now and then have only one or two to freeze for the future.

This recipe is fantastic! It has been many years since I have made a pie crust and this was the perfect recipe for a "last second" baker. Thank you to everyone who suggested upping the salt content, this crust was delicious! I would have added a picture but the pie did not last long enough to turn on the camera on my phone.

The shortening or water or something is like half the amount it should be. As a result the dough is ridiculously crumbly and fragile to the point of being nearly impossible to work with. I even had trouble rolling it out because it refused to stay round. I got it into the pan, took one look at it and threw it out. Worst crust recipe I've ever tried by far.

this is the only pie crust I know how to make actually and learned it from my mom when she taught me how to bake at eight years old and have been using it ever since for everything. I don't know of any other pie crust that worked for me but this one. like my Mom used to say stick to what you know best that is tried and true and this is it for me.

I used 1/2 cup softened butter & 1/2 cup refrigerated Crisco... rolled 1 crust & froze it for my cherry pie, then balled the other & cooled while making pumpkin pie filling then rolled it out. It turned out GREAT!!! Was even able to make 6 large stars to cover my cherry pie along with the 2 crusts.

I'd almost given up baking pies and resorted to the refrigerated crusts for years as I couldn't replicate my grandmother's flaky crusts.  Tried this one on a lark and am hooked.  Haven't had pie crust this flaky anywhere since my grandmother quit making pies over 40 years ago.  This one's a keeper.  Even the bottom crust of fruit pie was flaky and my non-pie loving husband came back for more.

This pie crust was perfect and simple. Only suggestion is not to use an extra large egg. I made pies at home with a large size egg and the crust turned out flaky and was perfect for slicing. When I used an extra large egg, it turned out too mushy and was not suitable for rolling out. One other suggestion is that I was able to roll out the dough (with the large size egg) between two sheets of waxed paper. Using the waxed paper prevents from having to flour the surface where you are rolling the dough, so dough does not get so tough or dry.

It was very easy to follow specially when I'm not experienced in baking. I used butter instead of shortening ( I didn't have any on hand, and I saw other crust recipes that used butter instead) it was also a bit sticky for me (I've read that it shouldn't be, if it's too sticky, not enough flour) I added about 1/4 cup while mixing and it worked perfectly.

I love this crust! I can even make it with my vegan margarine and I it turns out perfectly! I agree with adding just a bit more salt, but that is personal preference. I generously flour my counter and rolling pin. This is perfect for tourtière. Thanks so much for sharing!

I made this recipe using gluten-free flour from Krusteaze(sp?). I used organic Spectrum vegetable shortening and a tad more salt than the recipe called for. I read the reviews that said the dough wasn't elastic or didn't roll out right. I didn't even try to roll this dough out because I had a (I thought) brilliant Idea! Since I was making a pumpkin and sweet potato pie that needed no top crust, I just took the dough, molded it into the bottom of my pie pans, covered with cling wrap, and refrigerated until I was ready to fill and bake. It was SO easy and really good! I recommend trying it this way.

It went together in a snap.  I didn't have lard so I used half butter and half bacon fat (it was a savory pie).  This also helped with the salt issue.  Yum.  I have never successfully made a pie crust until now.  Thank you!

I eat gluten free and have had a hard time making a piecrust that's any good.   I used this recipe subbing in a gluten free flour and using butter flavored shortening.  It was really excellent, a light flaky crust like I haven't had in years.  This will be my go-to recipe from now on.

I made this twice: once for a chicken pot pie, once for a mango pineapple pie.   Both times it turned out great!  I did sub out butter flavored shortening because that's what I had.   I will use it again, many times, I'm sure, but for fruit pies will add a little sugar.  Kudos for an easy, reliable recipe!

When I saw the words "no fail pie crust," I accepted that as a challenge.  My pie crusts are bad.  You can break a piece off off of one and stab people with it.  Just think: the perfect murder weapon. :)

This recipe works.  It must be the egg and vinegar that do the trick.  I substituted two sticks of "vegetable oil spread" (low grade imitation margarine) and the recipe still worked.  The crust was good and tender,  and a great complement to the strawberry filling I used.

I made the recipe exactly as written except to use a whole teaspoon of salt.  And it's the lightest,  flakiest crust I've ever made.  In almost 20 years of baking pie from scratch.  It's going to be my crust recipe from now on.  Awesome!

This recipe said "no fail", and I've never made pie crust from scratch before so I decided to try it. When I was making the dough, it turned out really well, but was very greasy. It made plenty of dough for a good pie. I baked it with apples. After taking it out of the oven, I let it cool and tried to take a slice out and the whole slice fell apart. It tasted pretty good, how pie crust should taste. Overall, I probably would make this again, but adjust some things:
 I hope this can fix your problems. When you're rolling out the dough, don't use too much flour, or it will get really dry. And if it's crumbling, just sprinkle on some flour to hold it together while you roll.

If I can make it, it must be fool proof. So simple I was amazed. I had given up on homemade crusts years ago and resorted to refrigerated ones. Now I feel comfortable making my own with this recipe.

Perfect crust recipe!  My husband gave me the best compliment ever... He said, "usually crust is just something to hold the pie together. .. But YOURS are really really good! I look forward to the pie AND the crust."  I'll never use another crust recipe... :-)

What can you say about the first really good pie crust you've ever made?  Over the years I've tried to emulate my mother's wonderful pies and failed miserably. This is the first one that hasn't been an embarrassment. It wasn't as pretty as I would have liked, but that isn't the fault of the recipe. I just have to bake more pies to hone the technique.

Always do this one and it works better if you use golden Crisco shortening.

This is the best recipe I have ever used.  When I used a regular pie method "shortening,water,and flour" my crust would always end up tough, dry, and hard. With this pie crust my peach pie came out perfect.  Thank you so much. I will forever use this recipe.

The only things I changed is - In sweet pie I substituted lemon juice for the vinegar and it comes out perfectly every time. When using for meat or savory dishes I add more salt and use a wine vinegar or herbed vinegar that compliments the filling. Careful on the salt if using cooking wine as it will already contain salt.

I am a novice baker and frankly mildly intimidated by some of the baking recipes I see but this was so simple! It turns out really great every single time.  

Now, if only I could learn to make a proper lattice, I would be happy.

This is exactly the recipe my grandma & great grandma used and is the BEST pie crust I have ever made.  Has NEVER let me down and is SO flaky, light and flavorful you will never need another.  Lard works as well as shortening. May substitute butter flavored shortening depending on what the crust is used for.  Especially good with pot pies!!

I have made this crust twice following the recipe exactly. The crust rolls out nicely and was good although the edges were not flaky; they were a bit hard. Both times I had trouble incorporating all the dry ingredients and had to stir and work the dough a lot. I think this may be why the crust was hard. I would suggest adding a bit more water - maybe use 1/3 cup or possibly more.

This was so flakey!  I used half butter and half shortening, and upped the salt to almost a teaspoon.  I agree with other reviews that it was lacking in flavor, however, I followed one suggestion to use vodka instead of the vinegar, and that may be the flavor difference.  I will try again with the vinegar, because it was out of this world flakey.

I have never made a pie crust before. I followed this recipe and my first attempt was stellar. Easily made by hand and the result is a wonderfully flaky crust. I cut a few tsps of butter into the shortening, not sure what effect that had. As a novice baker, I was very pleased with this recipe.

I didn't have shortening and subd butter. I've never made a crust before but it worked well. I took another users advice and rolled the crust between saran wrap. Best trick ever-No mess. I used the crust for Grandma Ople's Pie. The whole thing was amazing. I plan to try this crust w/pot pie too.

I have never made a pie crust, made fun of my mom for spending hours in the kitchen making her own... I tried this recipe last year (and a couple others) and I will NEVER buy another pre-made.  I was the one who always ate the pie filling and never the crust - not with this one - it is amazing, flaky, tasty (you can't tell there's vinegar!).  And it freezes well for future use (my own quick and easy premade without the cost!)  This is a must try for anyone

This is the recipe I have used for years.  Sometimes it is a little too crumbly, a little more water by drops helps. I am going to use butter as it is at least natural. When I make pumpkin pie I roll out the dough put it in the pie dish and brush the bottom and sides with egg white with a little water beaten in. Chill again and them put in the pumpkin pie mixture. Helps the crust to seal and no soggy bottom.

The result was good but the quantity of shortening indicated it resulted too much for two cups and a half of flour, i had to put more flour . Probably because i used lard instead of vegetable shortening?

This is the most forgiving pie crust to roll out and tastes equally as wonderful.  It freezes well and seems to do best after you let it "rest" and chill for at least 2 hours.

I substitute sweet butter (no salt) for half of the shortening called for in the recipe.
I add 1 tsp of salt, also.

This really is a "no fail" pie crust!  I have made it twice, and both times was PERFECT!  The only adjustment I made was taking the advice of the other readers and put a tad more salt in the crust.  Wonderful recipe!!

I halved the recipe and added 1/2 tsp. salt which gave it nice flavor. I substituted half butter, half coconut oil for the shortening, which is made from toxic cottonseed oil. I was worried it wouldn't be flakey because it seemed too watery, but it turned out great for my German chocolate pie.

I have been using a recipe simular to this from the Crisco package, but they went and changed it! This has always worked perfectly for me though and dont see any reason to change.

I have never been able to make a decent pie crust...this works every time!  I don't know if it's the vinegar that does the trick, but it's worked for me!  THANK YOU!!!!!

Best pie crust i've used.  I doubled it and saved two balls of dough for next time.  Defrosted slightly in the microwave and the dough still rolled out wonderfully.  Used this crust for pies and for a chicken pot pie.

This pie crust is truly "no fail" and very tasty.  It was the perfect crust for the fresh peach cobbler I made today.  I can't wait to try it again!  Thanks!

I tried this recipe, the pastry was certainly crisp and flaky but I found the fat to flour ratio too high. Perhaps I was using the wrong sort of shortening(we don't have much choice in NZ!). My husband loved it but I found it a bit greasy.

This is a very good, basic pie crust. Though I do prefer the butter pie crust, from this site. All in all, very good though :)
