Love your idea of a chocolate grilled sandwich but cooked this way it would be dry and rather boring. You simply must coat the grill sides of the bread with butter or extra virgin olive oil and triple or quadruple that chocolate, Michele! ;-) 

Also, if you're in an adventurous mood add about a tablespoon of mascarpone cheese. If mascarpone is too expensive for the budget you can blend one tablespoon cream cheese and one teaspoon of whipping cream together instead :-)

YUMMY! I USED REGULAR WHOLE WHEAT BREAD TWO TBLS OF SEMISWEET CHOCOLATE CHIPS AND BRUSHED THE OUTSIDE OF THE BREAD WITH COCONUT OIL ( I DEFINATELY RECOMEND DOING THAT WITH EITHER BUTTER OR COCONUT OIL) SO GOOD WITH A COLD GLASS OF MILK.

I followed some other reviewers suggestions. I used coconut oil on the outside, cream cheese & chocolate chips on the inside. Yummy!!

Absolute genius! With either white or dark chocolate, this is a winner. Thanks for the recipe.
