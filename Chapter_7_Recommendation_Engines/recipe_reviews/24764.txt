i've made this recipe twice so far with different results.  The first time I made it I had to wing it with a few of the ingredients (I was short on brown sugar), and I also used raw kielbasa instead of pre-cooked (smoked??) like hillshire farms or the like.  When I made it the first time, it was good but didn't make me rave over it.  I decided to give it another go for my superbowl party and this time I made sure I had all of the ingredients on hand (I also tripled the recipe to accomodate the amount of guests I had).  I used hillshire farms kielbasa this time and WOW what a difference it was!  This is a fantastic recipe and I will most definitely be using it again and again and again.

Wow, this stuff is fantastic (and I'm not normally much of a Kielbasa fan).  I used 14 oz of ketchup and doubled the amount of Kielbasa as suggested by others - I had plenty of sauce and enough yummy Kielbasa to feed an army!  I knew I'd be rushed for time on the day that I wanted to make this, so I browned the onion, made the sauce, and sliced the kielbasa the night before, placed it all in a gallon size zipper bag and stored it in the fridge overnight.  In the morning I just dumped everything in the crock pot and turned it on low for 5 hours.  I suppose I could have used a crock pot cooking bag instead of a zipper bag, but I didn't have any on hand.  Anyway, I used regular kielbasa and I have to mention that there was about an inch of rendered fat on top of the sauce when the kielbasa finished cooking, but it was easily removed.  The sauce is so tasty that I plan to serve the leftovers over rice.

I was confused at first. Is it 1/2 of a 28 oz. bottle of ketchup or is it 1/2 of a larger bottle (in other words 28 oz.) of ketchup. I figured 28 oz. would be way to much ketchup. 14 oz. was just right as far as flavor goes and I'm sure this must be what the recipe meant. It was pretty good although, I still had way to much sauce and probably could have added another sausage or cut the sauce in half.

This was so good!  I tripled it and took it to a potluck luncheon.  It was completely gone!  Two people asked me for the recipe, too.  I did halve the ketchup, because the first time I made it, it seemed that was all you could taste.  And it smelled Great! while it was cooking.  Thanks!

I took this to an office party and out of all the dishes brought, this is the only one that there were no left overs!!! The only thing different I did was add bell peppers in with the onions and pineapple tidbits. Will definately be making it again!

Great alternative for serving Kielbasa or summer sausage!  I added sliced bell pepper to the onions...it was delicious served over basmati rice.  I'll definately make this again!

Did a trial run last night to see if I liked this enough to make it for a superbowl party...and the answer is no.  I followed the advice of others and only used 8 oz ketchup and 1/2 the amount of brown sugar.  Girl likes her ketchup, but this was way too ketchupy, sweet and vinegary, all at the same time.  Not a good mix of flavors, IMHO.  Thanks anyway!

Everyone loved this!  It drove my boss crazy because it smelled so good and I was cooking it at work for an early evening pot-luck meeting and when she finally got to taste it - her reaction was great.  My husband also deemed the recipe a "keeper" and not one piece was left at the dinner.  The only modification I made was to use half ketchup and half bbq sauce (I ran out of ketchup!).  It does make a lot of sauce.  Since we were using a homemade kielbasa, I'm not sure how much we used but I'd guess it was at least double what the recipe calls for.

Very good.  Both my kids ate it, and my husband really liked it, so I'll make it again.  I did it in a skillet on the stovetop- browning the sausage and onions, then stirring in the sauce ingredients (which I halved)and simmering for about 10 minutes. I only used 8 oz of ketchup and thought it was plenty.  Any more than that and I think the ketchup taste would've been overwhelming.

GREAT recipe!!   I could gobble it all up :)    I browned the Kielbasa then I did as the recipe said and saute the onions and I added bell pepper.   I mixed a bottle of bbq sauce and cut the ketchup down to a cup, and then added the other ingredients and poured over the Kielbasa in the Crock.  I also added a can of chunk pineapple partly drained.   cooked on Low for 5hrs and served over rice!!   soooo good!!

This is a tremendous amount of sauce for one pound of sausage. I did use two packages of Hillshire Farms Turkey kielbasa that are 130z. each. and still had quite a bit of sauce. This really did taste amazing and I will make this again. Just will reduce the amount of ketchup a bit so not so much sauce. I think this would be really good with some green bell pepper and pineapple chunks. We served over rice.

Really left something to be desired. I wasn't crazy about this at all, neither was my husband. Followed the recipe exactly, minus the butter in the beginning because I couldn't justify adding all that unneccesary fat. Served over brown rice..and it was just bland. We were picking the sausage out and leaving the rest. Not making it into my recipe binder unfortunately! =(

I made this and everyone ate it, but when my husband said “oh hot dogs and beans” my mouth dropped. He was right that is what it tasted like. Not what I was looking for but I made 6lbs for a party and most was eaten.

This was really good. Needed something different for Kielbasa and this was nice. Pan seared the keilbasa with some garlic and onions, made the sauce (eyeballed amounts to taste)omitted hot pepper and used cayenne. Slow cooked for about 3.5 hrs on low, served over rice,  really good.

I did everything to recipe except i halved the sauce and kept the sausage amont the same and cooked the sausage with the onions. We ended up realizing it tasted better after simmering for 20 min rather than after being in the crock pot for 5 hours. Wish we would have ate it for lunch rather than dinner. But still even then, I would probally not make it again, it was just ok to our taste buds.

I doubled the meat both out of that is what was needed to feed my family & most recommended by other reviewers. I also went ahead & browned it up a bit to avoid the extra grease you can get from sauce cooking down in a crock pot. I caramelized my onions in the brown sugar & butter then mix the rest of the ingredients just to heat it up but added as others recommended some pineapple & peppers. Then just poured it all in over the meat & let it go on low for about 5 hours or so & YUMMY! Oh & yes I do not ever use ketchup in a recipe like this. I added a real nice tomato sauce until I got the consistency I liked. We served it over a nice jasmine rice & a VERY picky family of 5 gave it 2 thumbs up & 10 stars if they could!

The sauce on this is a little too sweet and not enough sour for our family. The kielbasa didn't work for us, either. Next time, I'm reducing the brown sugar by 1/4 cup and increasing slightly the vinegar, spicy mustard and Worcestershire. I'm also going to brown up some meatballs made of ground pork, panko, salt and pepper to put in it instead of the kielbasa. The kielbasa ended up a little too smoky and overcooked tasting for the sauce to us. Some pork meatballs (or even ground turkey) will be a welcome change.

10 stars! wow my whole family loved this! I actually made it for a work 'pot luck' and it went over very well, but after everyone at home smelled it cooking for hours I had to let them sample it, and we really loved it! I didn't alter it too much, I did add a 2nd kielbasa as many reviews recommended and there was still a lot of 'sauce', and I also added a 20oz can of pineapple chunks. With the confusion of the ketup amount I went with the 14oz, plenty! We'll be making this from time to time (just worried how much my husband loves it because he's diet-controlled diabetic).

I had my doubts but this stuff is GOOD.  Myself and my boyfriend boh devoured it.  I used white onions for a milder onion flavor.  Also I did not have cider vinegar so I used 2 T. white vinegar and 1 T. malt vinegar.  I cooked in a dutch oven for a quick meal.  However, this recipe made about 2x more sauce than what is needed.  Next time I will probably double the meat or more.  The sauce was very good, hated to throw tht much away.

My husband had one bit and proclaimed, "Wow." This is definitely a repeat, and it was so simple - something new to do with all the sausage we get sucked into buying at Costco. I following the ingredients exactly (estimating measurements), but I cooked it low and slow in the oven with foil on top instead of using the slow cooker. I took the foil off the last 15ish minutes before serving. Great potluck item.

AWESOME, I made this sweet and sour kielbasa the same way the recipe called for and it was delish. The sweet and sour sour sauce was the best I ever ate. There was so much sauce I cooked up rice and poured the sauce over it. This recipe can be used for sweet and sour chicken over rice by adding pineapple, peppers and carrots to it. Thank you for sharring.

Great for a slow cooker recipe.  I usually try to make it the way the recipe states but some of the ratios just seemed to far off.  I used no butter but a little olive oil to saute onions and peppers and brought sauce to a boil in the skillet.  I kinda think this whole step (saute in the skillet) is unnecessary in a slow cooker and will try it by just dumping it all in next time.   Although I do enjoy sausage when its been browned up.   Here's what I changed no butter(without all that butter it'll be much fewer calories and much healthier), just about a tablespoon of olive oil, half a cup of sugar, 14oz of ketchup, an added green and yellow peppers and a can of pineapple and used half of the juice.  Very much happy man or kid food.  Its not gourmet but it is very tasty comfort food.  Served over rice.

I made this for a potluck and had many positive remarks about this. "Phenomanel!" Many asked for the recipe.  I added sliced peppers, pineapple chunks, and 1/3 of the juice from the pineapple.  Many asked for the recipe.  I also did not have the worcestershire sauce and did not use it, so even without that, it was awesome.

We really enjoyed this. I did as other reviewers recommended and cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup. The only other thing I 'changed' was to not add the hot sauce. The kielbasa was so tender. I served it over rotelle and it was very filling.

I used cocktail links and did this in a casserole dish on the stove. I recommend tasting the sauce as you are cooking. I cut the amount of ketchup and it was still all I could taste..so I added about 1/2 c. of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and it was fantastic!

This was super easy and very good.  Great meal on a budget.  Our wal-mart sells the 1 pound kielbasa for like $2.58 and then I served over rice and a side of green beans.  I think the whole thing cost maybe $4.50.  Tastes delicious.  I ran short on time so did everything on the stove top and just simmered for about 2 hours.  I will definitely take this to pot-lucks and the like.

Great recipe.  I took it to a potluck at work last week and it went over very well.  I took some other people's advice and added some sauerkraut and pineapple.
If I made this at home, I'd definitely serve it over plain rice - it's very rich and tangy.

Made this for a 4th of July party--had a few little pieces left.  Lots of some of the other appies left tho, so I think this was a hit.  Very easy, just put it in the crock pot and let it go.  Didn't need to change a thing.  Thanks!  Will definitely use again.

Made this for my Chrismukka party and it was the first thing to disappear off the buffet table!  I followed the recipe as is except I increased the kielbasa (I used turkey kielbasa) to 2 pounds and there was still so much sauce left over.  Used only 1 tsp Tabasco. Making it again tonight for supper!

Wow, this is a delicious recipe! I made no changes to the recipe, except that I used almost 2 lbs. of kielbasa. This was served over rice and broccoli.

This is a great recipe for a large number of people. I just use 2 cups ketchup. I usually make it with 2 packages of Kielbasa. I also add Red and Green bell pepper and a can of drained chunk pineapple and serve over steamed Jasmine rice. Sometimes with more people, we will make one crock pot of Kielbasa and one crock pot with Chicken breasts.

Another variation is I throw everything into the crock pot stir it up and let it cook. No stovetop necessary.

Oh my.. just fantastic. I only used 1tsp of the hot pepper sauce because I am not a fan of "hot" stuff, other than that I followed directions exactly. So very very good. Kept sampling all day while cooking. I will make it again for sure.

I brought this to a pot luck luncheon which themed soups and stews- all around winter comfort foods. These bites were well received - they complimented the other offerings.  Easy to prepare. Easy to place it all in the crockpot and serve when everyone else is ready. The sauce is very pretty too. I will increase the spicier ingredients next time. (for my own taste) I used a very heavy hand with this first preparation -but this recipe can easily handle it.  I tripled the recipe for this luncheon and my crockpot could have still accommodated another sausage maybe two. I would not increase the sauce though. The sauce thins as it cooks through the day with the lid on.

This is a great recipe, the only changes I made was 1/2 the ketchup and 1/2 the brown sugar, doubled the hot sauce, added 3 cloves of garlic, and some green bell pepper. This is wonderful for dinner over pasta with a salad, or just sit it out on game day! Thanks for a great new way to make kielbasa!

It was okay after I changed it around a lot.  For instance, I used about half the amount of ketchup called for and about half of the vinegar.  I also gave it a couple of dashes of BBQ sauce.  Otherwise it would have been completely inedible...just a ton of ketchup over some sausage.   After I altered it a lot, my kids thought it was okay, and my husband loved it.   It's okay to base off of, but it needs a LOT of adjusting.

I made this for a party that I went to. I am always hesitant to bring something I have never made before, but this was a hit.I did read the reviews and the only thing I did change was by using less ketchup and adding pineappple tidbits. It was one of the last dishes brought in and one of the first ones to be emptied. thank you.

This made the skinless (YUK!) kielbasa my husband bought palatable.  It was great with brown minute rice made with a chicken boullion cube, dried parsley and a shake of Molly McButter.  Looking forward to eating the leftovers!

This is a great recipe. would be a 5 however there was a lot of onions, next time i will cut it by half. I cooked it for 2 hours on high, had to let it sit for a minute to thicken. I also served it over biscuits and rice! Great flavor. Will make again.

This may go up to a 3 if it reheats well...I was expecting more.  I used a 7 blend high quality brown rice, and the sauce works wonderfully with that. However, I don't think the sauce matches the kielbasa very well.  I used polish kielbasa, so maybe that was an issue.  This was edible and not horrible, and it might be really good with a different kind of meat.  Probably won't make again.

This recipe is fabulous.  I didn't follow the amount of ingredients to a "T", but kinda went with my gut. I think i added a little more Brown sugar, and a little extra hot sauce.  They are sweet at first, but have a little kick to them in the end.  FABULOUS!  Will be making these again!

I had never made kielbasa in the slow cooker before, but will be from now on. I did sear the sausage in the pan prior to cooking the onions, and would highly recommend you do as well. The char on the meat really added great flavor! I used sweet onions, and once they were browned, I deglazed with a splash of white wine and put it all into the slow cooker. As far as the sauce, I used this recipe as a base, and also added about a tablespoon of horseradish, salt, fresh ground black pepper, a pinch of red pepper flake, and a splash of JD Old No. 7. After about 4 hours in the cooker, all I can say is WOW! The most tender kielbasa I've ever had, and the most incredible sweet and tangy sauce with that caramelized onion. Oh yeah....we'll be having this again.

I am shocked that anyone would think this recipe was anything other than FANTASTIC!! I loved it. I used pre-cooked Kielbasa. The brand I used was Ellliots. Elliots fully cooked Polska Kielbasa. It was mouthwatering!! I followed the recipe almost exactly, but added a half teaspoon more of spicy brown mustard. I plan on tripling this recipe and making it for my next church potluck!! The recipe was exceptionally easy and very flavorful. UPDATE: Because I used fully cooked Elliiots Kielbasa, this meal only needed two to three hours on LOW in the crockpot. My eleven year old daughter LOVED it and had seconds!! FABULOUS!!!

Excellent!   I used 8oz ketchup, omitted hot sauce and doubled kielbasa and added sweet peppers also.  Served over jasmine rice.  So delicious!  It's a keeper!

We really liked this.  I also cut the amount of ketchup in half and there was plenty of sauce.  I cooked it in the slow cooker on low for about 6 1/2 hours and that was to long.  The sauce tasted a little burnt.  Next time I will only cook it for about 4 hours.  I taste tested it a that time and it was great.  We put it over a bed of white rice and it was very good.

As suggested by another reviewer, I made this as a main dish, added green pepper near the end, and served over rice.  It was just ok... I would not eat it like this again.  It would be much better served as an appetizer.  If I made ti again, I'd probably use little smokies rather than kielbasa.

i used a 15 ounce bottle of tabasco flavored ketchup, half the amount of brown sugar, half the amount of onion, only 2 tablespoons of the cider vinegar, added some jalapenos, used 2lbs of the little smoked sausages, and kept everything else the same. took this dish to a bbq at a friends and it was a hit!!

I thought it was so so.  Reviewers used this recipe for I a main dish so I tried it that way too serving the sausage over buttered noodles.  I wouildn't serve it that way again.  This recipe tasted similar to one for mini weenies as an appetizer that I like better.  Far too tart for main dish.

Great recipe...very easy to put together.  Only changes I made were due to what I had on hand: 28oz tomato sauce instead of ketchup soy sauce instead of worcestershire regular white vinegar instead of cider  It's a great starter recipe..that like my changes above...you can modify to your liking or what you have on hand :)

Wow - super simple and super yummy! Of course after reading all the previous reviews I made a few adjustments to the recipe:  2lb meat, 10oz ketchup (or 1 heaping cup), 1 large onion - sliced, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce, 2 tablespoons mustard, 6 tablespoons butter and chopped garlic.   I first cooked the meat with butter and garlic in slow-cooker on low for 30 minutes. Then added in onions along with ketchup, etc for 2 hrs, then for the last hour threw in sauerkraut (drained).   Total duration 3.5 hrs and all in one pot. And everyone loved it.

This was so good!  I will definitely make it again.  Normally I don't eat Kielbasa, but the sauce was so good, my husband has asked me to do other meats like chicken or meatballs using this sauce.

My husband made this for dinner and it was so great! He made it with Turkey Keilbasa and it did not dry out, although it only cooked in the crock pot for 1.5-2 hrs on high. The second time I made it, it was for work. I didn't realize that the onions were suppose to be cooked before putting in the crock pot. I had no choice but to cook everything for 4 hrs, and by then the turkey keilbasa was a little on the dry side. I didn't think it was even half as good as when my honey made it. The people at work didn't seem to mind though. It was gone within the hour and it was a double batch. By the way...it smells so great when its cooking!!!

Great! The only modifications I made were to sub olive oil for butter and to do it completely on the stove top. I didn't simmer for hours and hours, only about 20 minutes and it came out fantastic! I served it over boiled/stewed potatoes (little more Polish than rice...hubby's Polish :) )

Tasty.....I used almost 2lbs. of turkey kielbasa cut into coins, and cut the brown sugar in half. I did sautee my onion in a little evoo first and simmered on low in the crockpot for about 3 hours. Hubby liked it, but couldn't eat too much. I think this would be better as an appetizer rather than a meal. Will make again as an appetizer. Thanks!

Good recipe. The final product was tasty, although for my personal tastes some minor adjustments are needed. However, all in all, a good recipe that allows you to do something different with kielbasa. Thanks!

I didn't care for this. The ketchup is completely overpowering, even when reduced to 1/4 of what's called for.  You might as well heat up the kielbasa, onions, and pepper and just squirt ketchup on it.  That's what this tastes like.  Would not recommend.

It was delicious.  Lot of sauce, so add more kielbasa and I used red wine vinegar because I didn't have any cider vinegar.  I used the extra sauce over Zita.

I made two big mistakes with this recipe--coooked a little too long and used Turkey Polska Kielbasa--ick.  I think you need the "full fat" version to get the right result--my sausage came out really dark and dry.  The sauce, however, was really good.  I'm sure if I used the right sausage this would be a real winner!

We enjoyed the wonderful flavor of this easy dish very very much. I took some of the other reviewers suggestions and added green bell pepper slices and extra hot sauce plus I used 1 1/2lbs. of keilbasa and served it over rice. You could use 2lbs. if you were to take this dish to a potluck event.

Thumbs up from my 2 year old, my husband and me! I cut the sauce by half and it was just right. I used smoked chicken apple sausage instead of kielbasa, because it was what I had. I also used balsamic vinegar, beacuse that is what I had. The sauce was delicious. And the sausage was leaner than kielbasa. Yummy!

I doubled this recipe and ended up with way too much sauce!  The dish was excellent though.  Next time will tweak back the sauce ingredients and add even more kielbasa!  Good flavor!

I was looking for a new recipe for kielbasa and I thought this would be good and easy.  I was disappointed.  It smelled great, but the sauce was way too tangy and did not taste right with the flavor of the sausage.  I would not try this again.

This is one of the most amazing sauces I have ever tasted. Everything blends to perfection. I am allergic to Worcester sauce, so I substituted soy sauce and a dash of dark chocolate coco power. Amazing.

I served this at a euchre party and EVERYONE raved about it.  So delicious. However, the ketchup amount is too confusing. Just say 2 cups instead. And I  added 3 smoked kielbasa  and there was plenty of sauce. Will definitely make this again.

This was a big hit when I brought it to a work party.  I did tweak the recipe slightly per other raters suggestions (i.e. used less ketchup and added some colorful peppers in addition to the onions).

I am in the process of making this dish and I followed the recipe to the letter.  I just bought the kielbasa and date is fine.  I think it might be the vinegar but not sure.  Did anyone else experience this?  I hope it tastes better than it smells.

I changed this recipe quite a bit. I used two onions, 2 green peppers and 2 cloves of garlic in the saute. Then I ended up doubling the sauce recipe and added 26oz of kielbasa and 13oz of sausage. I also added a 20oz can of pineapples and the juice and instead of the hot pepper sauce I used a deseeded jalapeno pepper. I used the full amount of ketchup used but the pineapple juice made it sweet instead of ketchupy. I cooked it on low in the crock pot for 9 hours and it was AWESOME!!!

My hunny couldn't seem to get enough of this. I made it excatly as stated above. We served over rice and right before adding the meat and sauce we added a bag of spring mixed veggies and made it like a true all in one stir fry. I used ectra hot chili sauce so the heat was nice for us but I would recommend cutting back on it a bit if you don't like spicy food or are serving kids

The kids asked for seconds before their plate was clear!  I omitted the butter and hot sauce.  Also, I only had dijon mustard to use.  The second time I made this, I doubled recipe to make sure everyone had their fill.  One of my kids even dribbled the sauce on her baked potato, it was so good.  A new weekly favorite.

This burned in the crockpot the first time I guess because it wasn't full enough (I have a 6 qt).  The second time I just did it on the stovetop and it was great! I used 2 lb. Turkey Kielbasa instead of 1 and brown sugar/Splenda blend.  It was a little hot w/ 2 tsp hot sauce so I will cut back next time.  My kids don't like rice very well but did not mind eating it with this on top! Quick and easy recipe!

Way too sweet.  It did taste good and I'm sure as an appetizer, having 1 or 2 pieces, it would be wonderful but to eat it as others have suggested (which is how we had it) on rice we all thought it was way too sweet.  I had read the reviews saying it was too sweet and others saying it was perfect so instead of the whole cup I used 3/4c brown sugar.  I will make this again but with 1/4c brown sugar to be eaten as a meal and maybe 1/2c as an appetizer.

I followed the directions on this perfectly and it BURNED in my slow cooker on low heat for four hours!   When I remade it in the pan it came out fine, although a bit too sweet for my tastes. I wouldn't advise putting this in the crock pot unless you'll be there all day to watch it.  I may make again but less brown sugar.

Ok so, I'm kind of on the fence with this one. I expected jubilation and fireworks from the family based on the high ratings of this recipe but what I got was, "umm, Ok, guess so.."  Don't get me wrong, the flavor is very, very good. But this seems to be more of a 'man food'. Perfect for Super Bowl and the like. If you have kids that aren't very keen on tangy and sour sauces then this may not be a sure bet.  Worth a try if you're desperate to find something new to do with kielbasa. (I was!)

DELICIOUS! Half the amount of ketchup as half is plenty. I slow-cooked this for almost 5 hours. I served it over hot rice. It tasted like General Tso's kielbasa! Will definitely be making this again.

This was really good, but I used chili sauce instead of the ketchup

This did not go over very well with my very picky family. I was a little disappointed because it sounded much better than it actually was.

Recipes like this is what I call easy and tasty, my husband loved it! I did use beef sausage and turkey kielbasa, as substitutes. Can't go wrong.

I had to modify this for  a quick stove top meal, but the kids loved it!  I did halve the ketchup as suggested and I also halved the sauce recipe as a whole. I boiled the kielbasa first in water on the stove top. Then I mixed the sauce together (I was out of cider vinegar so I used regular vinegar) and I also used regular mustard  to tone it down for the kids in my daycare. I left out the onion and didn't use any hot sauce..which made this sauce a lot like a ham ball sauce. I cut the kielbasa into coins then halved the coins and simmered the sausage and the ketchup concoction on the stove for about 30 min., the last 10 min. I covered the sauce so that it wouldn't get too stiff to pour over noodles. The kids really liked it! I served it over wheat noodles. will make again sometime..it was quick and easy.  Would probably be even better in the crock pot!

I ENDED UP USING LITTLE SMOKIES BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE KIELBASA ON HAND.  THE SAUCE WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED AND SEEMED TOO "VINEGARY".  I MAY HAVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY BATCH SINCE ALL THE OTHER REVIEWS ARE MORE POSITIVE.

I had a MNO and made this recipe - kind of. I used about a loop and a half of polska kielbasa and barbeque sauce. I sauteed onions and a bell pepper beforehand. I combined the kielbasa, onion, bell pepper, and a can of pineapple chunks in the crock pot. I also added about half of the pineapple juice. This actually turned out quite good, but it did have a bit of a bite (spice) that I did not expect. I also think you CAN cook it too long. I cooked mine on low for about 8 hours because I was cooking rice for the same amount of time and the sausage turned out too soft for my taste. Overall everyone enjoyed it that is why I will give it 4 stars, but next time I will definetely cook it less time - maybe 3 hours.

This tasted better than I thought it would.  The sausage has a richer taste than I'd expected - maybe from the long simmering.  But it wasn't a fantastic must-have and my kids wouldn't eat it (they're only 4 and 2 so there's not much they WILL eat) so I give it 4 stars instead of 5.  Per some other reviewer's suggestions, here are the changes I made: I subbed olive oil for the butter, subbed a chicken/apple sausage for the kielbasa, cut the brown sugar back to 1/2 cup, used just 8 oz ketchup, added a chopped bell pepper and a can of pineapple tidbits, and served over brown rice.  I will probably make this again.

This was a great dish for a pot luck supper.  I changed it a slight bit by adding 2 lbs of sauerkraut and a can of crushed pineapple drained.  I also threw in another pound of kielbasa.  It got raves.

The sauce reminded of what I would use for ham BBQ. Added a little extra spicy mustard. The recipe was easy to prepare and makes for a great appetizer.

This is the best recipe ever that deals with a crock pot kielbasa, everybody always enjoys it, when I make it. I lost the recipe and had to print it out again. This is good stuff, thanks.

this was so easy & totally delicious & yummy!  even my husband enjoyed the flavor.  I served it over rice.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  I omitted the hot pepper sauce, only because I had none...but we still loved the flavor!

Awesome recipe! Not too sweet, not to hot, just the way my family liked it! I am going to try this recipe with Lil' Smokies, too. I know it will be just as good. And a heack of a lot cheaper than buying bottles of sauce to cook them in!
