What a great idea for breakfast. Could this be any better? Nope. It's fast, healthy, and super delicious. I typically don't care for eggs and tomatoes but the canned tomatoes changed my mind. They burst with tomato flavor but don't have that crunch like fresh toms, so the texture mixes perfectly with the eggs. I cheated and used some leftover peperonata (bell peppers, potatoes, and olives) instead of the roasted peppers. I topped it with some habanero sauce, but as is, the flavor is right on. Thank you.

I have made this many times and everyone LOVES it!!!  Try goat cheese on top instead of feta for a creamier option.  Love!  Love!  Love!!!!

Since this is a recipe of Candice, I'm sure the three star rating is reflective of the cook, not the recipe.  I only had one can diced toms so used it & one can of sauce, 1/3c water.  I would've liked the sauce to be thicker, but it tasted okay.  I'm anxious to try Bren's recipe next.  :)
