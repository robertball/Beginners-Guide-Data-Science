This recipe is outstanding. Although what started out a disaster turned out to be an even bigger success.  When I tried to get the cake out of the pan it broke apart into 4 sections.  I was in tears because I couldn't serve it on Easter the way it looked.  My husband sampled it and said it was the best carrot cake ever and I HAD to serve it...so this is what we did.  I broke the cake up into bite size cubes and layered it in a clear bowl as follows... cake pieces, drained pineapple chunks and Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting.  I repeated the layers 2 more times.  The frosting recipe is on this web site also and it is also fantastic.  It was a huge success and people asked for the recipe.  I think I'll always serve it this way from now on!!!

AWSOME! My family and I loved this cake! Extremely moist, GREAT flavor...and, with a few changes, it's semi-healthy too! All I did differently was: I added a little allspice to the flour mixture.
Used only 1 cup of vegetable oil (HIGHLY reccomended - it was plenty moist)
Used about 1 1/2 cups sugar (I thought it was the perfect amount of sweetness, especially with the frosting..by the way, my frosting had one package of cream cheese, half a stick of butter, 1 1/4 cup powdered sugar, and 1 tsp. orange extract. Sometimes I add orange zest too. Orange is a GREAT flavor with carrot cake.) Instead of baby food, I used extra grated carrots. I reccommend adding extra carrots even if you use baby food, since 1/2 cup isn't very much.
Didn't put any pecans in the batter - just on top of the frosting. =)
With these small changes, it was definitely a 5 star cake!!
((This recipe is VERY similar to Carrot Cake III - only this one calls for baby food, so I think I'm going to start using that recipe...not that this one isn't DELISH!))

Wonderful moist flavorful carrot cake.
Made some changes as follows:
Used less oil 1 1/3 cups; eliminated coconut; decreased baby food to 7 oz.; increased grated carrots to 1 cup; added a little nutmeg.
Baked for 40 minutes in two regular round cake pans as to make a traditional birthday cake. 
Frosted with Cream Cheese Frosting II (added extra cup of confectioner's sugar)

I tried 3 other carrot cake recipes on this site, took one bite and tossed the cakes each time. I almost didn't try this recipe because I was becoming discouraged on finding a great carrot cake. Let me say, this is THE carrot cake!! The only change I made was that after the first cake, I tried adding a cup of drained, crushed pineapple and it turned out beautifully also. Either way, if you are looking for the best carrot cake you ever ate, look no further than this!

This was a really good recipe.  I also tested Sam's favorite Carrot Cake and that was really good too.  It is a toss up to decide which one is better.  Everyone likes both but the tally is about even to which one is better.  Sam's is slightly ahead.

I made this for Easter based on all the reviews and it was fabulous.  Everyone wanted some to take home. My Aunt couldn't make it over to the house but I had my Mother take her and her husband a few slices.  My Aunt called me the next day to tell me it was awesome and she ate both slices!  This is definitely a keeper!

I made these into cupcakes with cream cheese frosting for my son's birthday party. To reduce calories, I substitute 1/2 cup oil with unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 cup of sugar with splenda.  They still came out really moist! My only issue was that I did not enjoy the chewiness of the coconut flakes. Next time I think I will pulverize them in the food processor first so the pieces are minuscule.  The cupcakes were enjoyed by everyone.

This is so amazing and full of carrot that it almost convinces you that you are eating something healthy. Almost. For this recipe, I use 1/2 cup oil and increase the grated carrots to 3/4 cup. I also add an extra baby food jar and halve the coconut, as I'm not a big fan. Yum! Next time I'll try replacing the remainder of the oil with applesauce and see what happens.

This cake is delicious. Growing up a friend of our family use to bake a carrot cake, made with baby food for every family occasion, and everyone loved, loved, loved it.  I tried a few times to get her secret recipe. Now I don't need it, because I am now getting rave reviews, wether I bake a cake for work,  for family, and friends. Everyone loves it. I even won a few bake sales, and came in 1st place.  I am baking a few for Easter. Sometimes, I drain canned pineapples, and add it when I add the pecans, and it makes the cake even moister. Thanks Pat...funny our family friend,  the one use to bake the carrot cakes name is Patty.

This was the first carrot cake I ever made. I made this for my son's first birthday party and it got rave reviews.  The problem was I forgot to omit the nuts for him, so I made a second cake a few days later so he could have some too.  We gave him a different type of cake at his party.  The second cake was just as good as the first.  I did swap out 1/2 cup of oil for applesauce.  The cakes were both really moist and flavorful, nuts, or no nuts.

I adjusted, based on other comments, by only adding 1 C. oil and 1-1/2 C sugar, and it's still very moist and pretty darn tasty!   I made into cupcakes, and used the whipped cream cheese frosting, YUM!  i adjusted baking time to 20-25 minutes for cupcakes.

I am always asked for this recipe.  I even put in it my Mom's club cookbook.  It's really good if you use baking raisins but they are hard to find.

This is REALLY GOOD!!!!! It was really most! Only use 1 cup of oil! For icing I used 1 1/4 cup of powder sugar,1 tsp. of orange extract,1/2 a stick of butter,and one 12 oz. package of cream cheese. Just mix it together!

I have made this cake several times as a layer cake. It is the most wonderful one I have ever tasted! Very moist and flavorful. I'm sure it freezes well but I have never had the chance to try; it's gone so fast.

I am a junior in high school and I anually enter a cake for my youth stock show. Being the procrastinater that I am, I put off practicing until the week before the 4-H show. I had no clue what I was going to bake, so I quickly did a search on the internet, finding this and 2 other recipes. Picking this one, I won reserved champion and sold it for $475 (which is the maximum amount). I have to say it is one of the easist cakes I have ever made from scratch. It is definitly worth a try. Also I would suggest using a glaze instead of an icing, packing as many chopped carrots into the 1/2 cup as possible, and if you have a kitchen aid use it, it really makes a difference.

I made this for my husband's birthday.  He said it was the best carrot cake he had ever eaten.  I followed the recipe completely with the exception of using 1/2 of pecans instead of 1 cup.

My family and friends love this recipe.  I omitted nuts, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I was a little disappointed... I've made carrot cake with baby food before, and expected it to be a little bit moister.  Maybe my new oven bakes a little hotter...

This cake was amazing, and I had lots of compliments. I made it exactly as directed, except I just used a regular square cake pan and topped it with cream cheese icing.

I'm so dissappointed.  :(  I was really excited for this cake after so many good reviews.  As another user recommended, I used the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting from this site.  My problem?  It just didn't *taste* that great.  It was VERY heavy, even for a carrot cake.  I'll give it moist - but it was seriously lacking in great flavor.  It was more like a bread.  Definitely won't make it again.

This is the best carrot cake recipe on this site! (I've tried 3 others before this one.)  I couldn't find baby food, so I pureed carrots with a touch of water, then drained most water out through a fine strainer till correct consistency...voila: baby food.  Everyone went on and on about this cake, so this will be my "secret recipe" cake.  Thank you!!!!!!

This was an awesome cake! Everyone loved it.  I accidently picked up 2 jars of carrots and one of sweet potatoes, but I added the sweet potatoes and it didn't matter one bit. I didn't use the coconut since some of my family doesn't like it.  Made 2 9" layers for a yummy birthday cake.

So moist and delicious - better as cupcakes, as it's always too moist coming out of the bundt pan, and falls apart.

Thank you - I made some carrot cup cakes using this recipe yesterday and took them to a garden party - they were very popular and everyone commented on how delicious they were.
I couldn't find baby food carrots (the jars I found had carrot and potato) so I bought a tin of cooked carrots and blended them - and it seemed to work!
I'm even going to use this recipe for my wedding cake it's so good.

I was not very impressed by this recipe..it was not awful..but I've definitely had better.  I also didn't quite enjoy the taste that the carrot baby food brought to the cake.  IT WAS BITTER.

I really liked this recipe. It was moist and light. I was afraid to add that much oil so I cut it back to 1C. I also put it in a 9X13 because I didn't want to wait that long for a 10" tube pan to bake. It came out quite tall, I could have used my jelly roll pan and made a thin cake too. If you want it a little fruitier you could add pineapple. But I was making this for my old man for Fathers Day. I also liked the coconut, I have never seen that in a carrot cake. I would make this if I didn't feel like getting the processor out because I have to admit the baby food costed me $1.30 alone lol! A+ all the way.

I am not much of a cake baker, so when I was asked to prepare a carrot cake recipe for a co-worker's birthday I was nervous. This recipe was so easy to make and everyone loved it. Phew! Thanks Allrecipes :)

This carrot cake seems to be the best one I have found so far but I'm still not happy with it.  If you can taste the oil, then there's too much of it.  I prefer lighter, cleaner cake.  I guess most people prefer moist cake that slides down your throat like...well...whatever.  The flavor is a nice one.  Will make again with less oil.

This cake is AMAZING! When paired with icing, it's a huge hit! I leave out the pecans and coconut which makes the cake smooth and moist! It seemed odd that the recipe called for baby food carrots, but I really think it's the special ingredient that makes the cake so spectacular. I've even converted two of my "I don't like carrot cake" friends. You have to try this!

This was a 5 with my alterations....1/2 olive oil 1/2 apple sauce, 1.5 cups sugar and only had 2 baby jars(carrots), but had some leftover pineapple to use.
I had to cook this another 15 minutes(turned the oven down after 50 minutes as the cake was very brown), it was still soggy in the middle!
Good flavour though.
Icing was cream cheese frosting II by Janni from this site(real cream cheesy!)

    * 1 cup brown sugar (instead of white)
    * 2 eggs
    * 1 teaspoon french vanilla syrup

Absolutely wonderful! A deliciously moist, sweet and spicy cake that everyone loved!

I didn't have all the ingredients to follow the recipe exactly, so I used just one 4oz apple sauce instead of carrot baby food and almost 2 cups of grated carrots. I also added some AllSpice for added flavor, an extra half cup of pecans and didn't make frosting. (I love carrot cake frosting, but this cake is also sweet and moist enough that it's perfectly delicious without it).

It came out superb and I was impressed at how evenly it rose. I made a few cupcakes from the batch to test taste while the cake was baking. After tasting them, the kids were pleading for more before the cake was out of the oven and my husband was firing up the espresso machine to add the perfect coupling to a scrumptious cake.
 
Definitely a recipe I will be repeating - next time I'll make sure I have all the ingredients and see how it comes out ...and maybe I'll add some raisins too. Thank you for an awesome recipe!

It was my first attempt at carrot cake and it's by far the best carrot cake I ever had, so simple and so moist.
I did make a few adjustments, 2 cups of grated carrots and I omited the nuts and coconuts.
well worth the five stars!!!

First cake I ever baked and it was a complete success...it was gone in no time! Used 3/4c oil and 3/4c apple sauce as suggested by other reviewers... it was super duper moist and yummy! The amount of batter was just right for 2 9-inch cake pans (baking time about 50mins). Goes well with "Cream Cheese Frosting II" by Janni from this site. I'm looking forward to the next time I'll be making this again...

My friends loved this carrot cake (I'm not much of a carrot cake eater, but they really loved it!)!! Very moist. I made half a batch of cupcakes without nuts (friends with allergies), and half a batch WITH crushed walnuts, and the ones with walnuts in it were gone in a few minutes. I think the baby food flavor is what really makes it taste different. If I were to make it again, I'd substitute some of the oil with applesauce, as the muffin cups were pretty oily.

Pretty good, but not the best I've had.  I like the cake to be a bit fluffier.  Perhaps if I had included the coconut, it would have been better.  It did taste better the next day.

Rave reviews, demands for the recipe, etc.  This was the very first carrot cake recipe I've ever attempted, and the results couldn't have been better.  Moist, not too sweet (the frosting balances out nicely) - TRY THIS!!

I made this over the weekend and it was delicious. I used 3/4 cup of oil and 3/4 cup of apple sauce. I frosted it with a cream cheese icing that another review had suggested. Everyone loved it and have already asked that I make it again.

Delicious!  I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and he still talks about how great it was!  If you're a cinnamon lover like we are, add an extra 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and you'll love it!

I substituted half the oil with 3/4c applesauce. The result was a cake almost of a bread pudding consistency in the center. It was delicious in its own right but I would call it a Carrot Bread Pudding Cake. Next time I make it, I'd reduce babyfood/apple sauce by 2/3 for a more cakelike texture. Flavor was great. I used more carrots and less coconut.

I have to agree with the other reviewers that this cake was fantastic! I made it for my mother-in-law's birthday and it was a hit! It's definitely one of the easiest carrot cakes I've ever made. I skipped the frosting & gave it a light dusting of powdered sugar instead. It was still plenty sweet, moist and delicious. Thanks for a great recipe!

Everyone loved it! I was weirded out by the baby food, but it makes total sense, and the cake really WAS insanely moist.  I LOVE the coconut in the batter. If you're making this cake, I hope you know that cream cheese frosting is always implied with carrot cake! Baby food is expensive, though, so I probably won't make this that often.

This carrot cake is FABULOUS!  Wonderfully moist and flavorful, with a beautiful rich orange color.  It disappeared in no time.  The only change I made was to cook and puree carrots, instead of buying jarred baby food.

This is the first carrot cake I ever made, and it will become a standard in my repertoire.

BEST CARROT CAKE EVER!  I baked this in a Pampered chef stoneware bundt pan and I think that only increased the moistness.  I added a drizzle icing made from canned cream cheese icing, baby food carrots and vanilla (all to taste, whisk & warm to get a drizzle consistency.)  THANKS, Pat!  This was the star of Easter dinner today.

Excellent, thanks for sharing.  People that don't even like carrot cake like this one.  My husband said needed a little more carrot; but maybe because I used very fine grater/zester. Cake was gone in less than 2 days, so will definitely make again and again.  So moist!   thanks so much!

good--for Easter dinner, I brought this cake and everyone loved it!  Best to bake the pecans prior to garnishing the top of cake---set oven for 350 and bake for about 10 minutes.  Let cool and crumble for added attraction to carrot cake.

A bakery could serve only these and still run out at the end of the day. Hands down the best carrot cake recipe I've ever had the pleasure of making or eating.  Made it for a party of 50+ ladies and it was met with raves.  I used sweetened fancy shred coconut with succes. It was fun to buy baby food again! Really great.

I made this for a birthday cake and it was fabulous! Everyone absolutely LOVED it! For the frosting I used the following: 8 oz soft cream cheese, 1/2 cup soft butter, 1/4 cup half-&-half, 1 tsp vanilla, 5 or 6 cups powdered sugar, 1 cup chopped pecans, and 1/2 cup shredded coconut. I mixed the cream cheese & butter together, then added the vanilla, milk, powdered sugar & mixed again. Finally, I added the pecans & coconut.  I put the cooled cake in the fridge to get it really cold & then frosted right before serving. What a beautiful cake! And so tasty! Served with vanilla ice cream. A home-run!

I was to make a Carrot Cake for our annual girls Christmas get-together, however the cake could NOT contain and pineapple, and so my search began.
This recipe was delicious and incredibly easy!  The best part is you don't have to grate cups and cups of carrots - you've got to love that.  
In case your wondering, there wasn't a slice left.  Even the picky non-pineapple eater was impressed!

This carrot cake was fire!! Omg it was the best carrot cake i have ever had! I did have to chamge a few things. Thought i had cinnamon? But i didnt so i put some ginger,nutmeg, and all spiceas as a sub. I also fifnt have any coconut(hate coconut) So i just skipped it. It was fantastic and i will make it over and over again. Had an event and it sold the most! I did make my own cream cheese icing, but the cake was the killer! Thank you for sharing your recipe. I dont have any pics,cause they are all gone but when i do it again,i will snap plenty

I have been making this recipe for close to 20 years. No lie. It’s anazing. I usually make it with 3 9 inch round pans for 30 minutes... just keep an eye on it so you don’t overcook it. It’s amazing!  I covercit with homemade cream cheese frosting and press chopped pecans on the sides and coconut on top. It’s a beaut!

I wanted to cook a full Easter dinner this year, which I had not done before.  I decided to try my luck at a carrot cake.  I found this recipe and the reviews looked good.  I couldn't find my Bundt pan so I made a traditional cake shape.  The cake came out amazing.  It was moist and delicious.  Everyone loved it.  I would say if you are not a big fan of a lot of pecans in your carrot cake to cut back on the amount.  I am definitely going to make this recipe again.

So, I'm happy I waited a few days before writing my review.  Initially when I tasted this cake my thoughts were, "what is everyone raving about?" I was, to say the least, somewhat disappointed. I blamed my lack of enthusiasm on the fact I cut the sugar to 1.5 cups (because 2 seemed excessive). I also cut back the oil to 1.5 and added a cup of shredded carrot (rather than the half). When I first tried it I thought something was missing. I went back the next day and oh my goodness.  This cake is delicious with the Cream Cheese Frosting II. I can't say enough about it. I will make it again and may add pineapple as well or orange zest.

The best carrot cake I've ever made. I didn't have baby food on hand, so I boiled and mashed a carrot. I was extra careful to grease and flour my bundt pan thoroughly so it wouldn't stick. The cake came out beautifully! Very moist and sweet. It really doesn't need icing, but is delicious with or without.

Very good. Tastes just like a good carrot cake should.  I made this recipe into 4 dozen mini cupcakes. I think they took about 15 min to bake.

We made a 3-layer cake instead of using the bundt pan. It turned out great. Best cake we've had in a long time!

Would've like a little more carrot flavor. My husband and I both thought it tasted more like spice cake.  Was very moist though and good.

Great recipe!  Even the most discriminating carrot cake lovers said this cake was fabulous.  I did leave out the coconut and I used finely chopped pecans.

This is the first carrot cake I ever made. I have always loved carrot cake especially without the frosting. This is by far the best I have ever eaten. And to think that it was my first try. Thanks Pat for a wonderfully easy recepe to follow and make successfully.

If you looking for a cake with a "spice cake" flavor, then you will like this recipe. I make a homemade carrot cake each Easter. I made this into a layered cake and frosted w/ a homemade cream cheese frosting. Next time I make these, I will make them into cupcakes and add more carrots, as other reviewers
has suggested.

This is the very first time that I have ever attempt to make a carrot cake.  My son loves them and I decided as a treat I would make one for him (Every year I would buy one for his birthday...and he would not share, see how much he loves them)...I am not a carrot cake fan personally.  This cake received rave reviews from everyone...They really loved it.  I made it last Sunday...guess what I am making it again...And it was not difficult at all. It was very easy.  I used 1 cup of carrots and 2 jars of baby food and because my son dont really like the nuts, i grined them up very fine...na dhe was none the wisest...that was my only alterations.  but thank you Pat....this was the ultimate best.

My mother use to make something similar when I was a child.  I made this recipe for my family without the cocunut and without the grated carrots so that the kids would eat it and it is absolutely wonderful.  The kids loved it!  I iced it with a cream cheese and powdered sugar frosting.  Excellent!
