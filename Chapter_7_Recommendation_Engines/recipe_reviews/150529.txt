Chicken A La King is my mom's favorite tv dinner so I was super excited to try this recipe. I was a little scared of the sauce (because it sounded weird to me) but it turned out really good. The only changes I made was using a lb of fresh chicken tenderloins that I cut into bite sized pieces and seasoned them with some salt and pepper and browned them in some canola oil. After they were browned I added all the ingredients called for and about a quarter of a chopped onion. Everyone liked it there was just a little bit left! Will def. make this one again maybe making a little more of the sauce, not becuase it's delicious but becuase it needed just a little more in my opinion. My mom thought the sauce was sweet, but I didn't get that. Tastes like the tv dinner ones!!
