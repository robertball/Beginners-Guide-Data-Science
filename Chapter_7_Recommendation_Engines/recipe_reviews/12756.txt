I agree that the recipe is inartfully worded, but I think this can be a great recipe, and I like the green-pink contrast notion.  However, I would suggest saute-ing the mushrooms, onions and vegetables first, setting them aside and making the sauce in its own pan by melting the butter and slowly adding flour over low heat and then gradually adding the milk, stirring well -- this is just a simple white sauce, after all.  Then add the dill and the veggies and any other stuff listed for the sauce.  This keeps it from being a gloppy mess.

I must say, though, if you really want something great use FRESH salmon.  Put a square of fresh tender oven-baked salmon (cook with minced garlic spread over the fish and a drizzle of olive oil) over the noodles, pour over a generous amount of the sauce with the veggies and stuff.  Then you just pull apart the fish to eat with the noodles, slightly stirring as you eat.  YUM!!

Another fantastic dish can be made by making a basic cream sauce (like the white sauce but use cream), no dill, no other veggies, and then add SMOKED salmon strips, rock shrimp, and RAW red onions.  Delicioso!!  This dish I had at Scomo's in San Francisco, and I was in heaven!!  My only regret was that I was staying at a hotel without a fridge and couldn't take the substantial amount of leftovers with me!!!!   SOOOOOO GOOOOOD!!!!!

I gotta tell you, this was great and pretty quick. The directions are fine and I've got to appreciate someone who doesn't feel the need to be long-winded. (ahem) that being said I'll tell you the changes I made to it, just because I had the richer stuff available. I broiled my fresh salmon with minimal seasoning, lemon-lime pepper and garlic powder + olive oil. I made the roux as suggested with onions and mushrooms in pan, it worked fine because there wasn't a liquid in there yet. Once the flour was toasted up pretty well I used a cup of half & half and the rest of the liquid was made up with pasta water. I added a few shakes of the lemon-lime pepper to the sauce as well. A little white wine as suggested and a handful of frozen peas as suggested by someone else and it was done. I tossed the pasta in the sauce and served the salmon on top. I saved all the garnish since it was just myself and young daughter eating and it was delish!!  I will definitely make again.

This recipe doesn't work. Something is wrong. You can't saute onions, mushrooms, flour, and a little bit of butter. And there's no way it's going to make a sauce.

This was fast & simple. I did change parts to make it faster. I used cream of mushroom soup with 1/2 a can of milk in place of fresh mushrooms and flour mixture. I didn't have the spinach fetticini so I just used regular pasta.  Added garlic & red peppers and it was really quick & yummy.

If you understand the fundamentals of a roux, this dish will turn out gorgeous.  Fresh salmon baked with butter and lemons sends this dish over the top.  Add the remaining lemon and butter to the sauce (when you add the milk).  Heavenly!

I added the lemon pepper and some fresh garlic as suggested.  I also added about 10 oz of frozen peas and carrots when sauteing the onion.  We all really liked this, and my four-year old ate it plain on the side.  Thanks!

Really delicious! We added crushed garlic to the sauteed veggies, substituted soy milk for the milk and olive oil for the butter, skipped the white wine, and added 10 oz of spinach and a dash of paprika. It was great... and sustentacular!

This was pretty bland.   I even thought I did things to liven it up a bit.   I used fresh salmon (a pound) and added green peppers, sweet sherry instead of the white wine, and fresh basil.  I'm considering mixing in some garlic and more fresh herbs just to make the leftovers more exciting.  Not that it was bad by any means, just mediocre.  Sorry Christy.

This was an excellent dinner.  Needed a little something to pick it up--I added lemon juice--maybe some lemon pepper or chili powder would be good additions.  People who said the instructions don't work, or that this isn't how you make a roux--lighten up!  You can make a roux with veggies in it--I do it all the time for soup!

WOW! REALLY good although I tweaked it a bit. I added a little bit of lemon pepper to the sauce and cut the salmon into very small chunks and cooked the sauce on low with the salmon in it. The sauce was very thick and creamy and the salmon wasnt all chunky (I dont like it like that). I used multi-colour fusilli instead of the green fettucini. I also substituted water for the white wine as I didnt have any. Will definatlely make again! Thanks for sharing!

I did make a lot of changes, but the result was DELICIOUS. I couldn't find spinach fettuccine, so I used whole wheat fettuccine in its place. As many suggested, I sauteed the vegetables first -- 1/2 cup finely diced onion, 2 stalks finely diced celery, 2 teaspoons minced garlic, and 1/2 cup frozen peas. I omitted the mushrooms, as a personal preference. When the onions were translucent, I dumped them into a bowl, and started on the roux. Instead of using milk in addition to the salmon "broth," I used half and half. I was out of white wine, Parmesan, parsley, and dill -- so I left those out. I salted and peppered to taste, then added about 3/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes. I added the salmon and the veggies, mixed to combined, and served over the pasta. It was a HUGE hit. My husband and kids all thought they wouldn't like it, but they all ended up having THIRDS. I will definitely make this again!!!

This is a good start. I took other reviewer's advice and tweeked it a bit. Sauteed the onions in butter, added the flour for the roux base. Eliminated the mushrooms (per family), added milk and wine, brought to a boil.
In the meantime, baked salmon filets w lemon, butter, and dill. Added filets and pan juices to the thickened sauce. At that point I decided it needed a litle kick so added some seasoned salt and Emirl's Salmon Seasoning. Used asiago to top pasta and sauce. 
Served a family of 5 to rave reviews. My p

This recipe turned out lovely.  I made a couple of reader-suggested alterations.  I was too lazy to make roux so I used a can of cream of mushroom soup. My big mistake was using a little soy milk with it...DON'T DO WHAT I DID!! I thought that I had ruined it for a second.  I added a little soy sauce and sour cream to take the sweet edge off, and thank goodness it worked.  Had some fresh dill, and spooned the mixture over garden rotini(Wacky Mac).  It was delicious and looked pretty as well.

This tasted too much like tuna casserole with salmon substituted to be worth all the time that goes into it.  It did look pretty though.  :l  :/  :)

Liked this a lot, BUT it did not need 1/4 cup of flour! I slowly added it (mixed and tasted) and it thickened up with less than 1/8 cup. I also used fresh salmon that I pan fried in the butter, onions, garlic, dill and pepper. I then added the mushrooms and continued to cook. I just used regular penne pasta and added fresh spinach leaves to the sauce for the last 2 mins of cooking. It was a great dish, even my husband went back for seconds - that's a win in my book.

I loved it and thought it presented very well. I simplified the making of the white sauce (same ingredients) as another user did, I used smoked salmon (reduce salt if you use!) my husband did not care much for it. Will try again with fresh. Also the only vegetable i really had on hand was spinach which was fantastic (since i only had egg fettuccine anyway lol)

While we found the recipe acceptable, it wasn't anything to rave about. We didn't have any white wine, so I used sake, but otherwise followed the recipe. I found the pasta sauceto be far too thick and would add next flour if I ever made the recipe again.

I loved this recipe. Of course I tweaked it. Becasue I am not a big fan salmon I used cod . I baked the fish and served it over the noodles and sauce. I also used some olive oil,  butter, salt, Cajun seasoning, lemon pepper on the fish. I used a little half and half in the sauce. I used a vidalia onion so the sauce turned out a little sweet.

I did use fresh salmon instead of canned, so instead of adding salmon juice from the can I added a little extra water...This has to be one the the best Salmon and Pasta Dinners I have ever cooked... everyone that I served it to loves it ... It is a must try at least once!!!!

Yes..the way the recipe is worded is a little off, but I did understand it, and it was quite delicious. I added a frozen vegetable mix, that included french green beans, mushrooms, onions, and broccoli, plus a few fresh mushrooms. That gave it a little extra goodness. It reminded me something of a rich man's tuna noodle casserole.

Dish turned out bland which surprised me, because of the many positive reviews and the combination of ingredients would appear to make a tasty combination. Maybe I'd need to play with the spices. I did not have spinach fettucine in the house so I use a box of farfalle and sauteed some raw spinach. I also sauteed two salmon fillets rather than used the canned. I conjecture that I may have gone too light on the salt, but if that is what's missing then this is not a good dish for me--I'm trying to reduce my salt intake. I added crushed red pepper and grated parmesan cheese to the leftovers to make them palatable.

This was great!  It could use a little more flavor, I think next time I'll add some garlic and chili pepper flakes with the onions.  We made the sauce and served it over plain fettucini and steamed brocolli.  This was a creative and easy way to use a can of salmon!

I think the product that came from this recipe was fantastic. I do feel 2 Tablespoons of parsley was a tad much to the eyes. However, it did taste great! I do think that the recipe was not eloquently written and it was confusing at times. During the confusion, I didn't realize that I was to drain the salmon juice into the milk but it still turned out tasty! I definitely plan to make it again.

Pretty good. I tasted the sauce as I went so added some seasoning to brighten the flavor up. I made it as a standard roux and had no problem. Served mine over toast...yum. Added peas also. An easy dinner I will make again. The kids really liked it.

I followed this recipe to the letter and both my husband and I were very pleased! Easy to make, although it does have a lot of ingredients.  The only "complaint" I would make with this one is that although it's supposed to serve three we got more like six generous portions! Next time I'll halve it if it's just for the two of us.  Will definitely make this one again!

This was very tasty.  I used shallots in place of the onions for a milder flavor and some fresh minced garlic.  Made a roux as suggested by others and it all was very simple to prepare.  I also added a few dashes of lemon pepper.  Next time I make this I think I would use fresh salmon because the sauce is really impressive on it’s own and I think the packaged salmon takes a little something away from it.

For all the calories, it's lacking a lot of flavor. Was sure to add the wine to the mushrooms along with the milk but it was still quite thick.

the recipe was hard to read, but it worked.  I was scared to just pour all the milk in like it said, so I made it like a normal roux which worked out fine.  My son and I both gave it 3 stars, basically because it is just medium good.

This is so good. I scaled the recipe to 1 serving since I only had a 6oz can of salmon. I also used half and half instead of milk and flour. It was plenty for two of us. It's a keeper!!

Easy to cook, however, after adding the mushron and onion to the flower I ended up with a very chunky sauce. I recommend adding the flour with the milk to make nstead of the mushrom and onion!

This was a good, quick and tasty dinner.  I didn't measure everything exact, just eyeballed it.  and i did add garlic to the veggies as they were cooking.  but definitely a good meal!

Thank you for the base recipe though I made several changes. I used canned sockeye salmon (red), one cup of mushrooms, added one cup of frozen peas, skipped the wine, substituted 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese, skipped the parsley and dill weed, used a 14.5 oz package rotini pasta. When fresh asparagus is in season I'll swap that for the peas. We all loved it.

I think this is pretty good. It reminds me of a similar tuna dish that I've made before to serve with rice (a version of tuna a la king). I found it a little bland so I added some capers for some punch. I think that  a little lemon juice squeezed on top would also zest it up. I probably will make this again. It seems comforting and is not hard to make. Gotta love those roux based sauces!

5/11/2017 - This was really, really good - I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk, added some celery and peas in with the onion and mushrooms, a couple shakes of red pepper flakes and pan-cooked a salmon filet sprinkled with lemon-pepper seasoning - mixed everything together with a tri-color pasta - delicious!  Somewhat time consuming (about 45 minutes total?) but very good.

Not entirely sure what went wrong, because I had high hopes for this recipe.  When all was said and done, though, it just came out a kinda goopy mess.

I was not to terribly impressed. Once it was all made it kind of tasted like tuna fish casserole on noodles. Not overly impressive.
