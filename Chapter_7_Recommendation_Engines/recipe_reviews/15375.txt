Wow! This is amazing.  A lot of people complimented on how amazing the gravy was, but I thought the chicken took the prize.  I substituted garlic salt for garlic powder and added onion salt and I doubled the spices.  I felt 3 cups of oil was way too much, so I used 1 1/2 cups and it was fine; I just flipped the chicken pieces as it was cooking.  I also doubled the gravy and served it over mashed potatoes.  It was to die for.

GINA, YOU HAVE GOT TO BE A COUNTRYSOUTHERN COOK! I KNOW A GOOD SOUTHERN RECIPE WHEN I TASTE IT :) FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO THINK THIS IS BLAND , TRY A SEASONED FLOUR SUCH AS KENTUCKY KERNEL. ANOTHER THING IS, I READ WHERE ONE REVIEWER THOUGHT THE RECIPE CALLED FOR TOO MUCH OIL TO COOK THE CHICKEN IN. I BELIEVE THAT THROUGH TRIAL AND ERROR YOU WILL FIND THAT IF YOU FOLLOW GINA'S RECIPE AND USE THE OIL CALLED FOR , YOU WILL GET THE ULTIMATE CRISPY FRIED CHICKEN THAT WILL STILL BE JUICY ON THE INSIDE.I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT I ENJOYED TRYING SOMEONE ELSES RECIPE AND HAVING IT TURN OUT SOOOO DELICIOUS!!! THANKS GINA!!

YUMM!  This is one of the best fried chicken recipes I have tried!  The gravy was good, but I did add quite a bit of garlic salt, salt and pepper.  The chicken was very moist.  Great recipe!

Excellent!!!  This came out SOOOO good!  I used chicken breasts and fried them in skillet for about 4-5 min. per side and then cooked them in a preheated 400 degree oven for 20 min. Mmmmm....Both chicken and gravy were PERFECT!   THANK YOU!

Awesome and very, very easy.  I used garlic powder and seasoning salt instead of the garlic salt, being that I didn't have any.  Instead of deep frying for all that time, I just did about 4 minutes per side and then put it in a 400 degree oven for about 25 minutes until it was done. Very good.

I am rating the GRAVY only because I have not made the chicken yet.  Oh....my....word.  If the chicken turns out HALF as good as the gravy, this deserves 10 stars!  I bought a rotisserie chicken for dinner last night and had mashed potatoes and green beans, and my husband wanted a gravy to put on the chicken and potatoes.  My jarred gravy was expired, so I thought I would try this.  EASY to make and the taste was unbelievable.......and I didn't even have the chicken 'drippings' to include in it!  I will NEVER use jarred chicken gravy again.  Only changes - I didn't have poultry seasoning, so I added some thyme and rosemary instead, and I had to add a bit more flour mixture to get it to thicken up more.  I am so anxious now to try the chicken and will add my review when I do.

Practically foolproof fried chicken (just make sure you watch the temperature of the oil!) and an okay basic gravy.  I've made this recipe twice; the first time completely as instructed, with gravy, and the second time with a couple spice additions to the flour mixture as well as with a store bought gravy mix.  The reason why I think I'll stay with the store bought is that the gravy does not have enough flavor for me and it was also too greasy and thin.  It's too easy to just open up a pouch and spend two minutes boiling it up, you know?  I also end up adding more pepper and paprika to my flour mixture because my boyfriend and I like it a little more spicy.  If you take anything away from this recipe, though, make it what I call the triple dunk technique: flour, milk/egg, and flour again.  This combo really makes the glue like consistency that helps the flour STICK to the chicken so it doesn't all fall off when you put it into the oil.  Overall a nice basic recipe for those who need to practice on perfecting their fried chicken.

Well, my boyfriend stopped THREE times during dinner, to tell me to make sure not to lose this recipe, which in itself, is amazing.  After the first dredging, I dipped the chicken into buttermilk - I dont know if that made a difference or not.  I also needed a bit more flour mixture, so I could make the gravy.  I used chicken tenderloins, and made long chicken fingers - easy, no bones.  This fried chicken was AMAZING!!!!!  THANKS!!!!

This is what is commonly called Maryland Fried Chicken and this is a wonderful recipe. I am almost sixty and although I am a man, I have been cooking since I was seven. This is the best chicken I have ever made, bar none. The key I think is the double dipping, of the chicken into the seasoned flour mix. Once before going into the egg/milk batter and then again. It is critical also to get the temperature right at 375degrees but once you do it is pretty much idiot proof. Which is always a good thing when I am cooking. The crust is crisp and flavorful and the meat inside is moist and fully cooked. It reminded me of forty years ago when the Kentucky Fried Chicken first came out and was then so good that you were almost shocked at the taste. This Maryland Fried Chicken is just as good and a lot less greasy. The stuff from KFC today or for that matter for the last thirty five years is , but it did have a reason why it initially caught on. The gravy is subtle but flavorful. A keeper recipe that is sure to get the fussiess eater raving about your cooking. Who knows maybe even my kids.

Oh my gosh, this is awesome. I had only made fried chicken once before and it was bland and blah. On my second try, the combination of my new iron skillet and this recipe produced fried chicken as good as any I've EVER HAD. I loved the flavor of the gravy made with the chicken seasoning (though my husband wasn't so crazy about it). I highly recommend this.

This was very good; the only thing I did different was to add 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the flour mixture.  The gravy was very good but my family does prefer the 'all milk' gravy.  I read many reviews that said their chicken was greasy; it won't be if you make sure your oil is hot enough, use a thermometer to regulate the oil temp. as the flour will immediately soak up grease that is not hot enough.  I never drain anything fried directly on paper towel; I place a cookie cooling rack on top of the paper towel because the paper towel seems to make the bottom of what ever you fry a bit greasy.

This was really good. Exactly how my Granny use to make it. I only have one little suggestion. Soak your chicken overnight in a big zip lock bag filled with buttermilk. It makes all the difference. Trust me... try it! Great recipe thank you...

FANTASTIC!  I've made this twice so far.  I was amazed at how well this recipe turned out.  I've never really been fond of fried chicken, but I was in the mood to cook something different and my husband was happily surprised to hear I was making it.  It turned out wonderful, and it wasn't greasy!  

The gravy alone is worth 5 stars!!!  

My recommendations:  Poke the chicken pieces several times with a fork before flouring... this will help the chicken cook a little faster.  I didn't bother using the egg - the flour sticks to the chicken just fine without it.  Definitely double the gravy... it's delicious!

OMG! This is so good. AMAZING gravy! The gravy really makes the meal. I put the gravy right over the chicken and mashed potatoes. *WOW* Thanks so much! I used chicken breasts. After the chicken browned, I threw it in the oven at 350* for 30 minutes instead of cooking in the oil. I was afraid my chicken would burn, and I didn't have enough room in my skillet for all of the chicken. Even my picky little ones were pleased with this, although they wouldn't touch the gravy, but that's just them being picky ;P

Great chicken!  But, if you're using a deep fryer, 15 minutes at 350 will do the trick - 365 seems to overbrown the crust.

great chicken, good gravy too- just make sure you cook the oil/flour long enough to get rid of the "flour" taste.  Once you add the stock/milk its too late.

Look out Paula Deen, here I come!! I have never, in my cooking life, been able to master fried chicken until this recipe.  My husband thought he had died and gone to heaven last night when I served him crispy fried chicken, with mashed potatoes smothered with fantastic cream gravy!  I used a Hungarian Hot Paprika instead of regular for the breading and it gave the recipe and extra kick, but that was the only change I made.  The chicken was so juicy and tender.  I doubled the breading because I had a zucchini that I needed to use.  Before adding the chicken to the oil, I battered the zucchini spears with the breading and put them in the hot oil for a couple of minutes and drained them on paper towels.  WOW! The flavor was excellent.  You will feel like a true southern cook when you serve this recipe.  Try the Hungarian Hot Paprika in your breading, if you like a little spice in your life.

I used this on skinless, boneless, chicken cut into strips.  I doubled the recipe though.  I served it to 10 people who left no left-overs.  They ALL loved it, young and old alike.  This was my first attempt at chicken gravy and it was easy to prepare and wonderful over mashed potatoes. I am sure I will use it again, and again, and....

I have been using this site, cooking different things, but I never was a member. I just became a member now to
give this recipe a 5-star!! I just made this and I LOVED it. Both the chicken and the gravy. I added more black and red pepper both though since I wanted it spicy. And I mixed some of the gravy with mashed potatoes. it was AWESOME! Thank you for this great recipe!

I have never had good luck with fried chicken so this was a wonderful surprise. My family of 7 devoured it. With 5 children under the age of 8 and a husband who hates chicken, I would say that is an accomplishment! Thanks

I followed this recipe EXACTLY.  I thought it was pretty good, but I think my oil was too hot (I didn't have thermometer).  So the skin cooked fast and was REALLY brown, almost too cooked.  The meat inside was nice and moist but the outside was too crunchy and no much flavor.  I think I will try this again because I found it super easy.  However, next time, I'll keep my flame at medium (not high) and brown a little less.  I may also increase the seasonings a bit more.  My husband thought it was bland.  It has super potential.

Almost perfect!  Next time I'm going to triple the spices and soak the chicken in buttermilk with a little salt overnight.  I used half of the oil.

WoW! This was absolutely delicious. Best fried chicken I have ever made. I almost added onion to the gravy, but I stopped myself because I wanted to see how it would turn out before I "doctor" it up. Chicken was tender and juicy, and gravy was thick and hearty. Served this with rice and a side of corn. This one is following me to work tomorrow in my lunch. :)

This was my first time making fried chicken and I was really nervous because my husband LOVES fried chicken. Thankfully it turned out GREAT! He, both my daughters, and my brother loved the chicken. The seasoning was perfect and the skin was nice and crispy! Will definitely make again!

The only alteration I made was to use chicken tenderloin..husband won't eat chicken on the bone. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. This dinner was great. A bit of work..but well worth it. Also, the gravy was perfect! I will be using this recipe whenever I'm wanting a fantastic country chicken dinner. Thank you!

This recipe is bar none the best chicken
I have ever made. The only change I will make, is to double the amount of gravy. Do not change anything else. If it ain't broke don't fix it. ENJOY

This is really good.  But, I can not make fried chicken for the life of me.  It gets too greasy and too brown before its cooked. ( I did use a thermometer)  I browned this up for about 4 mins a side and then put it on a rack on a cookie sheet at 400 degrees and cooked for 10-15 mins.  Really good, the excess grease drained off.

When I told my husband that I was going to try a new Fried Chicken Recipie, he was totally against it, but I did it anyway. 

Result: He loved it! Especially with the gravy that it made!! Thank you so much!
Between 1-10 he rated it a 9 1/2!

Thanks again!

Hmmmmmmm.  I think that I had too many pieces of chicken in the pan, because it for some reason came out a little soggy.  I liked the flavor of the chicken itself, I must have not cooked it right.  The gravy on the other hand was not my favorite, it was very runny.  I'll give this another try, but I'll use a different gravy.

Amazing recipe. Doubled the spices in the flour blend, and used 1 tsp hot paprika and 1 tsp regular paprika. Fried the chicken drumsticks on the stove until golden brown, and then finished in the oven for about 30 min on a wire rack. My boyfriend told me to be sure to save the gravy recipe, so good!

wohoo! I am so impressed with this recipe! I was a little concerned while making the gravey since the directions are not what I am used to, I added a pinch more flour and some salt since I didn't have much flour left over. 

I think the key to the gravy is actually following the directions. I sometimes cheat, but this is one that you gotta follow. The chicken was great too, first time I had ever made CFC and it actually all held together. I'm so happy!

I made this with mashed potatoes and "South Georgia Biscuits" (recipe on here) and my husband just said "WOW!"

I skipped the gravy and added a bit more of the suggested seasonings as I love flavorful fried chicken. This is now a part of our weekly menu as my husband and picky 4 year old love this chicken. It is super moist and if you cut your chicken into smaller bits it cooks really fast and you end up with a homemade chicken nugget. I think this is a great simple tasty recipe. What more can you ask for?

I wish I could give it WAY more than five stars!  All I ever get for comments from this recipe is, "THIS IS SO GOOD!" or "WOW!"  I  get the biggest ego from making this recipe.  Really, it is so simple to make!  I think it is better than KFC's chicken!  I think the mess that comes from making this recipe is SO worth it!  I love this recipe!

I use buttermilk and up the spices....
but am careful with the salt, only because of the gravy.  I think if I were to up the salt, which it needs, I would use "sodium free" chicken stock.
    Food Snob ... says...... Very Good !

nade this with reviewers suggestions, doubling the gravy and spices I also just browned it for a few minutes a side and then baked in the oven. I added seasoned salt as well. The gravy is good and the chicken came out crispy and juicy.

Made exactly as written, but I think I will add a little more salt next time as it seemed lacking a little.  Produced a very tender, moist, flavorful chicken otherwise.

PERFECT!!!!! I'm not a pro but I can cook just about anything, but for some reason fried chicken scares me. Call me crazy! This has very good flavor, VERY GOOD!! and the gravy-OMG!!!! the best! I followed the direction just like it said, I did wings only in the fry daddy added corn starch to the gravy just to give it some thickness. Thanks for the recipe!

The chicken came out fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly except I had 1.5 chickens...bet that chicken looked funny in real life!  ;)  So I had to double the batter mix.  I didn't think the gravy was all that great however, that could be due to the chicken stock I used.  Perhaps weak and not very "chickeny."  Next time I will use good old bouillon or home made stock.  Thank you for a fantastic recipe!!!

I've never fried chicken (nor anything else) before, but this came out great! It got thumbs up from my family.  Per some other reviewers' suggestions, I used 1-1/2 cups of oil. I used chicken tenders instead of whole chicken pieces, so mine didn't take as long to cook either.   I served the gravy over rice with steamed broccoli on the side. Thanks for a great recipe.

Sorry for the low rating, we didn't enjoy this at all. The coating was far too greasy, and the flavor wasn't  great. The gravy was OK, but I'll stick to my regular recipe.

YUM.  Very tasty!  I would give it 5 stars, with the following changes:  1.  Remove the amount of flour mixture that you're going to use for the gravy BEFORE you start coating the chicken.  Otherwise bits of egg get into the flour and then later they end up in the gravy.  2.  As is, I think this has promising flavor.  But to punch it up and really make it "wow", I add about 1/2 tsp. ground ginger and 1/8 tsp ground cloves, along with an extra dash of salt (1/4 to 1/2 tsp).  3.  I like to use 1 1/4 c broth and only 3/4 c milk.  This increases the chickeny flavor and makes the gravy a little browner and less pale.  Overall, an awesome recipe to start with!

It was really good but it was way too oily so suggest that the chicken spends some good amount of time in the oven. Also, you should probably double or triple the seasoning.

Excellent recipe!  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, pounded them flat and dredged them in the flour and egg mix's twice.  I also added the same spices that went into the flour mix to the egg mix.  I fried the breasts in about 1/4 inch of oil till golden and crusty, then baked them at 375 for twenty minutes or so, a little less greasy that way.  My grandma stopped in, and we invited her to eat and she couldn't stop raving over how good it was.  Had some leftovers (oh darn! lol) and sliced the breasts into strips and had quesadillias with them.  Very good!

The gravy was AWESOME but the chicken was only OK in my opinion.  I will likely be making the gravy again, but not the chicken.

Oh my gosh!  This was sooo good!  I was searching for a "chicken fried chicken" recipe and this seemed the closest to it.  This recipe did not disappoint.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, which I filleted to half their thickness.  I sauteed them in 4 Tbsp. light olive oil for 5 minutes per side.  then I transferred them to a covered casserole dish and put them in a 350 degree oven for about 45 minutes while I finished preparing the rest of the meal.  I did add 2 Tbsp. butter to the pan drippings before making the gravy.  My gravy was not too thin, it reduced to about 1 1/3 cups when finished.  I served this with mashed potatoes, biscuits and a tossed salad.  I will definately make this again!

Amazing! This is very easy and extremely tasty. Me being a yankee through and through I had never had chicken gravy like this and it is excellent. My picky husband even loved it. I served with mashed potatoes. This time I used boneless skinless chicken breast (it's what I had on hand) and it turned out wonderful.

This was my first attempt at fried chicken.  I followed the recipe to the letter and was extremely happy with the results.  The chicken came out moist and nearly falling off of the bone.  My family raved about the flavor of the seasoning.  It didn't need the gravy, but that didn't stop anyone from enjoying it on the chicken, or the biscuits my wife made.  I might try tweaking the seasoning a little to my taste, but it will not disappoint as is.

From the mouth of a southern girl...the overall seasoning didn't quite mesh with my tastebuds...I like a little bit of a kick so if you're like me you'll need to add what you like.  I did like the double dip though - nice coating. And I took advice from others and browned it in the oil then stuck it in the oven. It really comes out nice and juicy.I did like the gravy (little bit different from what I usually make). but my guest loved it as well. I will probably use both of these recipes again. Thanks!

This was so delicious! I used 4 boneless breasts and cooked them for about 6 minutes per side. My husband took a couple of bites and declared the gravy delicious! I took out 4 T of the flour mix before the raw chicken touched it for using to make the gravy later. I did double the gravy so we would have enough for both the mashed potates and to ladle over the chicken breast cutlets. Never thought of using both chicken broth and milk for gravy, but it was delicious! Excellent recipe. I've also used chicken bouillon cubes and water as a sub for chicken broth and it worked great too. 1 cube per 1 c water. Thanks, I make this all the time now, we love it!

This was one of the best fried chicken I have ever had. I am a southern cook and love flavorful food. I did not make the gravy (although I can't wait to try it) b/c I made baked mac n cheese with the chicken opposed to mashed potatoes. I used all chicken breast and split them in halves. What I did different was soaked my chicken in buttermilk and salt for about 5/6 hours and instead of using garlic salt and poultry season in the flour mixture, I used garlic powder and season all along with the other recommended ingredients. I'm sure I used more spices than what was required as I didn't measure, I only eyed it up. The chicken breast was so very juicy and didn't taste greasy. This is my new found way that I will fry my chicken.

I use just about same ingredients, except the poultry seasoning. I will add that to my recipe. Two things I do different, which I read on line, is after chicken has been coated, set in fridge for a while before frying. this will make coating gooey, but oh so good. The second thing is double the gravy. I am from the South--can.t make to much gravy. even good reheated. Thanks for your recipe! Love this site!

SUGGESTION - AS PER chefs AROUND THE COUNTRY- ONCE FINISHED BROWNING CHICKEN PLACE CHICKEN ON LARGE RACK OR 2, THEN PLACE THE RACKS ON LARGE COOKIE SHEET AND FINISH OFF IN 350 DEGREE OVEN.
THIS WAY CHECKEN IS COOKED THRU, AND IS VERY CRISPY.  THIS GIVES YOU LOTS OF TIME TO MAKE THAT DELICIOUS GRAVY TOO.
PS - WORKS WITH FISH TOO.

This was incredible! Such good fried chicken. I don't make it much, but this is the best recipe I've tried. I followed to a tee except cut the garlic salt in half and used garlic powder instead, and substituted ground savory for poultry seasoning.  

I also used less oil, and part olive oil.  Served with potato wedges and green beans.  The gravy was out of this world good!  My husband loved the meal.

Delish! Made subs to create a vegan version- seitan for chicken, enr-g egg replacer for egg, and only plain soymilk in gravy (with two tablespoons nutritional yeast for a chickeny flavor.) All flour subbed with whole wheat flour. Delicious, and now nutritious!

I don't prefer heavy breading so I season my chicken with chicken bouillon powder and pepper, roll in mixture of 3 beaten eggs, 1/3 cup water and generous sprinkling of hot sauce (got this from Paula Deen's recipe), and then roll in flour.  Fry in very hot oil set to medium-high(I recommend heating oil for good 10 min. before putting in chicken) for 1 min. on each side uncovered.  Then reduce heat to low and simmer covered for 25 min., turning once.  Finally, remove lid and increase heat to medium-high to thoroughly brown the crust.

Great Chicken!!  I made it with boneless thighs and breasts.  Instead of cooking completely in the oil, I browned in the oil and finished in the oven.  It got rid of tons of the oil and didn't change the wonderful flavor!

The reason why I joined the this website was because I always liked the sound of homely, southern American cooking. This certainly delivers. I was able to whip this up quickly when my partner came home late from work. He really loved it. I only used comparatively little oil in my frying pan(2-3 tablespoons for two chicken breasts), turning the chicken over on  a high heat then turning the heat down when the outside was crispy, to cook the chicken through. The chicken still managed to be crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The gravy was a great addition. The only thing I'll do different next time is to add more spice to the flour.

Delicious!  My only small changes were to substitute seasoning salt for the paprika and add a dash of salt to the cooked chicken.  I used an electric skillet for temperature accuracy.  The gravy was great as well!  For the chicken broth, I used 1 chicken bouillon cube dissolved in a cup of water.

Very good, it's a keeper.  I added 2 tsp. garlic salt, 2 tsp. paprika, 2 tsp. black pepper, 1/2 tsp. poultry seasoning.  Sorry, had to, wanted to make sure there was a good flavor in the chicken, and this did work well.

I am at best a novice cook, This recipe was easy to follow and was very tasty, the gravy was delicious! I would have liked a little more flavor in the chicken breading but, I have no idea what I could add. All in all, very good, thank you for this recipe!

This was surprisingly good. I made mine with a little red pepper flakes in the mix also to kick it up a notch.

Wonderful!!  I did not have any poultry seasoning so I used Lawrys seasoning salt instead.  I have never made gravy with chicken broth before and it was really good.  Thanks for sharing!!

Excellent recipe!  I have made it a couple of times and the only problem I ever find is that occassionally it does not cook all the way through.  This time I used the called for 3 cups of oil and presto!  Perfectly cooked chicken!  Thanks so much for this great recipe!

I really like the spice mixture, but the chicken ends up being way too oily in the end from spending so much time in the oil on a low temperature.  Cook it at 365 for 6 min, then cover it and cook about 10 min...flip it and do the same 6 uncovered then 5-10 min uncovered. The gravy is really good!

I made this the other night, without the gravy, and it was fabulous!  The only change I made was I added a little cajun seasoning, to kick up the flavor a bit, and marinaded it for a few hours in lowfat buttermilk.  I think the key also is to use a cast iron skillet.  I had one batch in that, and the other batch in a regular non-stick skillet.  The cast iron batch was just awesome, crispy and fabulous, so I'd use only that in the future.  Thanks for a great recipe!

No-one enjoyed this at dinner. My 14 year old who will eat anything said his school's chicken was better than this. The gravy was bland even though I doctored it up with cracked black pepper. Actually had left over chicken that we threw away.

Excellent! A very yummy and easy fried chicken recipe. The breading stayed on really well. I used thinly sliced chicken breast, and cooked in peanut oil for 5-7 minutes a side in my cast-iron skillet. I had a little trouble with the gravy, it was a little lumpy, but tasty nonetheless. I served this with green bean casserole, mashed potatoes, and baked corn (from this site). What a fantastic meal! Highly recommended.

I made this recipe for dinner the other night using boneless, skinless chicken breast and it came out fantastic! The gravy was delicious and my husband requested this be added into the rotation. My only complaint, which has nothing to do with the recipe, is that frying food in oil made my house and my hair smell... a small price to pay for a delicious dinner!

This recipe was delicious! Can't wait to make again! It was a little time consuming so I can't make it on most nights when I get home late for dinner and don't feel like spending 1+  hours in the kitchen, but will make on a weekend. This was soooo good. The gravy was perfect!

I made this exactly as recipe called for except that I used garlic powder vs. garlic salt, as it is what I had on hand. I added some Lawry's seasoned salt to add the salt.  The end result was awesome.  Only one problem...couldn't get the coating to stick on.  Maybe I didn't start with hot enough oil?  The coating was all floating around in the oil with my naked chicken :>. It was still incredible...best thing was the gravy which was heavenly.  I will make this one again and make sure my oil is hot enough to start with.

This was fantastic! Perfectly crispy and still juicy on the inside. The gravy is a lot like my usual gravy, but with the addition of the chicken broth. I think it made it a lot better than what I've been doing. Excellent!!! This is the go to recipe for me.

This recipe came out even better than I had expected.  The wife and kids absolutely loved it! The gravy was awesome too. The wife went so far as to say it was the best gravy she had ever tasted! I don't know if that's a credit to the cook or the recipe, but either way that qualifies it as a winner in my recipe book.

This is a fantastic recipe. The only thing I did different is that I dipped the chicken in the egg first, then in the flour mixture. Dipping it in the flour mixture twice makes the coating too heavy.

Very good recipe! I only fried the chicken for about 5 minutes on each side (only turn chicken once) then put it in a 400 degree oven for 25 minutes. The gravy was good... a standard cream gravy. For those who thought it was too bland, add more spices like cracked black pepper and salt to taste. I matched it with mashed potatoes and corn. yummm!!!

Wow, this was absolutely delicious!  I made it exactly as the recipe called.  I cooked it my husband's cast iron skillet which helped with even cooking.  The gravy was excellent.  My kids were stunned and enjoyed every last bit!  Thanks for this one.

Pretty easy for a first-timer, although we thought it lacked seasonings.  So we kicked it up a bit with some random spices we had in the cupboard.

The chicken looked wonderful, but wasn't very flavourful. I would add some more spice - garlic salt or pepper.

this is sooo good, i've made it quite a few times now!.
i cut the recipe in half (except for the sauce, i kept it at the full amount as i love gravy) and used chicken breasts instead. i also did end up doubling the amount of spices which turned out to be a good idea. also, i did run out of the flour/spice mixture after coating all the chicken, so i'll make a tiny bit more (like 1/4 cup).
i also pound the chicken breasts a little so they cook faster.
one of my all time favorite recipes from this site.

My mom passed on when I was 13 years old and she was a wonderful southern cook!  Unfortunately she didn't write down many of her recipes.  Now that I am a mom myself I am always searching for recipes that compare to my mom's old fashioned southern cooking.  This one is definately a true southern fried chicken.  My husband and I and the kids loved it and I will make it again and again.  Thank you!!!

I have never liked homemade fried chicken, but I was having my boyfriend and his sister over for dinner..so I thought I'd try something new.  It was so good.  This recipe has an excellent flavor, and it was actually quite simple.

I have made fried chicken on numerous 
occasions and this recipe by far is the
best. I used an electric skillet instead
of the traditional frying pan which 
prevented the grease splatter. It also 
made controlling the temp easier. When 
lowering the temp I used 300-325 setting.
I will surely pass this recipe on to 
everyone!!! (The gravy is perfect!)

Fried chicken is never a simple matter, but it's a labor of love, and this recipe makes it worth every bit of the work!  I've always wanted to make good fried chicken with gravy, and this is the way to do it. And it got rave reviews from the men in my home!  Way to go!

This chicken was wonderful...pleased my whole family.  I did however, destroy my entire kitchen cooking the whole dinner with mash potatoes, biscuits and fried ocra.  The gravy was wonderful as well..great on the potatoes, biscuits and the chicken!!  This definitely was an artery clogging dinner but OH SO GOOD.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe got rave reviews from everyone who tasted it!  Just remember to reduce the time you cook the second round of chicken if you can't fit all the pieces in the pan at once.  Preparation can get messy, but afterwards, when you see that pile of golden brown chicken on your table, it's definitely worth the effort!!  And the gravy goes great with mashed potatoes.

Excellent! This is almost how hubby makes fried chicken. He seasons both, the chicken and the flour, uses garlic powder rather than garlic salt and Lawrey's Seasoned Salt instead of paprika and poultry seasoning. Best fried chicken.

The key to this recipe is to simply....follow the recipe as it is written!!!! I cooked the chicken today, and my daughter loved it.  To quote her..."Ma, merch! This chicken is delicious. It tastes just like KFC!!!!"  For those of you who don't know what 'merch' means....it means cool! The gravy I put over garlic mashed potatoes, and added a side of Green Giant pasta & vegetables. The meal was to die for!!! Word of advice, add just a little of your favorite seasoning salt. I use Morton's Natures Seasons Seasoning Blend. I will definitely prepare this dish again.

Winner winner chicken dinner!  Wow! We made this yesterday for a non-traditional Thanksgiving and I have to say wow.  I've never made fried chicken, and to be fair, I only did the breading part while hubby did the frying.  It was well worth the effort. And just as amazing today for leftovers! I went ahead and doubled the flour and seasoning so we could do the double-dip.  Next time, I might add some more seasoning to the flour though.  I WILL make this again.  *We didn't make the gravy, so I can't comment on that part of the recipe.

I've been visiting this site for many years and tried so many versions of different fried chicken.....this is dynamite!!! I like a skin that has a bit more flavor to it, not just crisp and this was it.  The only modification I made which is a personal preference was that I soaked my chicken in buttermilk beforehand.  That is it.  Everything else is the exact same.  I do prefer to cook in an iron skillet as well as I think it promotes more even cooking.  I suggest you definitely try this!!!

We thought this was pretty tasty. My skin did start to come off a bit, but it was still good. I did like others and fried it until brown and then put it on a cooling rack over a cookie sheet and baked for 30 minutes in a 400* oven. The gravy was also good but I felt it needed some more spices.

This was amazing. I'd never cooked fried chicken before. This recipe was easy to follow and turned out perfect. I added some additional seasonings and used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt. Will definitely be making this again.

So, so good. I fried it for a few minutes on each side and baked it the rest of the way to cook. So so moist and flavorful. My food hating toddler grabbed a leg and was chowing down.

Wonderful crisp crust, moist inside.  Will definitely make again!  I am not a fan of gravy, but this was very tasty and I actually liked it!  All of the spices on the chicken must have given it that punch.

This chicken was a huge hit. Everybody loved it. The breading for the chicken does need to have a little bit more flavor in my opinion, but altogether it was amazing! Next time I make this I will add double the amount of spices to see how that tastes. The gravy was fantastic. I doubled that because everybody loves gravy in my family. By the end of dinner all the gravy was gone and we had one piece of chicken left. Thank you so much for this amazing recipe!

This was my first time making fried chicken.  BF and I both give this 4.5 stars - it was really good and relatively easy.  I didn't have a whole cut up chicken, so I used chicken breasts.  Also, only had 1c of veg oil, so had to add 1c of canola (2c total) - worked fine.  Fried in my cast iron skillet.  I've read before to only turn your chicken once while frying, so I made sure to brown it completely on the first side before flipping.  I did set aside my 2T of the flour mix before coating the chicken though and then spooned out 2T of the frying oil as the second batch was finishing, made the gravy in a separate skillet just to get it done sooner.  Had a little trouble getting it to thicken all the way, might cut the milk a little next time.  A tiny bit of cornstarch dissolved in cold water (1T ea.) did the trick.  Good flavor.  Served with mashed potatoes and a veggie.  Great, traditional home cooked meal.  A definite keeper for us - thanks!

Loved this gravy. Made me wish I had made chicken fired steak instead of fried chicken!! The flavor reminded me of the old diner that my dad took me to as a kid. Wonderful flavor and so easy to make. I'll put this to the top of my "favorites" list!

Not bad.  I think I'll have to adjust the cooking time though,  because it was a little hard and dry around the edges.  Other than that,  the chicken was okay.  The gravy was the best bit,  especially after I added another tbsp of the flour mixture and some extra garlic salt and pepper.  Yummy!

Very good thanks for sharing. I left out the paprika (not a fan) and added onion powder. I also finished it in the oven. My family loved the crispy skin of the chicken and flavor of the gravy that went over mashed potatoes and biscuits. They were pouring it on everything in sight...ummm yummy!

The chicken was perfect.   Tender and juicy with a crispy outside.  I cheated and opened a jar of gravy instead of following the recipe.

This recipe is great! So good I was asked to make it two days in a row & out of those two days i got 1 whole piece! & I didn't have time to even take a picture! But yes, very good. When I mixed the flour I did add some more of my own spices, but otherwise, yummy! & the gravy was good too ! Thanks for sharing!

OMG delish!!!  I am the worst cook EVER and quite frankly, chicken scares me.  I spent like 2 minutes in prep time.  I used chicken strips and they were fool proof!!  They came out great.  Cut down on the cooking time though with strips, due to their size.  The gravy was soo good on top of the chicken!  Can't wait to try this with my picky husband!

The best chicken and gravy I've ever had (I will go that far). The gravy is key. I followed the suggestion to fry then bake my chicken which was quick and easy. Absolutely delicious recipe, I suggest this to anyone looking for a great fried chicken dish!

Perfection! I, honestly, didn't have chicken broth but I am so going to try that next time. Flavorful and the oil didn't burn. So happy with the results that this is now my staple recipe. Been making fried chicken for YEARS and this was just perfect.

This turned out to be even better than expected! I doubled the spices except I only used 3 teaspoons of garlic salt because I didn't want it to be too salty.  I followed the rest of the recipe as written. Served it with mashed potatoes (I used yukon gold) and fresh corn that sauteed in butter, salt, and pepper.  Best dinner ever!!

This is the best fried chicken recipe I have tried. I actually made it with chicken tenderloins, like chicken fingers. The gravy is AWESOME! I doubled the gravy to serve over mashed potatoes. I will definitely be making this again!! DELICIOUS!!!

Holy cow, this was good!  My husband made this for dinner one night and it IS the best fried chicken I've ever had.  I would never confess this to mom & dad but this recipe is amazing!  B/c my husband made this and had it on the table when I got home from work, I don't know if he made any changes or added anything.  I would think he made it just as is but I have to say thank you so much for sharing this recipe, we love it!

This was OK. I didn't have enough flour mixture for the gravy (didnt think to just remove 2 tbsp ahead of time)....and what I did have leftover was sticky from the egg mixture. So my gravy sucked. And when I fried the chicken not alot of the flour mixture stayed on the chicken. Still, my family liked it and I will probably make it again with some adjustments.

This chicken was absolutely amazing! I just loved the crispy coating. I followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out perfectly! Gravy was DELICIOUS..nice and creamy! My fiance loved it as well!  My mother lives in the south (i live in NY) and made fried chicken with gravy from the chicken grease and pour it over the chicken and and on some white rice. I was looking for a recipe like hers.    THIS WAS BETTER! Thanks Gina! I can't get over how good the gravy was.  I don't understand the reviews about the gravy being bland so people used packet gravy.  I think packet gravy is awful and bland.  Very very good, will be making this meal often.  And like someone else said, they made an account on her just to rave about this recipe... i did the same!

MMM mmmm... I am full! This was good. I was too lazy to make the gravy though, used a store bought one and added about 3 tablespoons of fat/oil from the chicken, and added the flour mixture. Still turned out great!I will use this again!

I believe I must have overcooked the chicken.  It was crispy - but not tender and juicy on the inside - kinda dry!  That is why I only gave it a 4 star rating. Next time I will adjust the cooking time.  This is the way I was taught to make gravy - it is the best!

I have made this for years & everyone loves it! The only changes that I make are using boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut in halves & I always taste the flour mix to make sure I approve of the taste. If it needs more salt or garlic, I just add it in small increments. It's just a great recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and this was very, very bland; especially the gravy.  This dish still has potential to be great, I think next time I’ll follow some of the suggestions given about alterations that were done to give this a 5-star rating, but as is it’s only a 3.

This was a great fried chicken recipe.  I didn't bother with the gravy, but my husband raved about the chicken all night.  I got the oil to hot and charred the first couple pieces, but they still tasted good.  Just watch the oil temp!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

We don't eat fried chicken very often but when we do it better be good. I followed the recipe except for brining the chicken for about 4 hrs prior. This makes all the difference in a moist or dry chicken. The seasonings were pretty much right on. I browned the chicken then I finished it off in the oven for about 1/2 hr at 350. The gravy could have been better. I will tweak that next time.

I would decrease the oil - it was a little soggy and greasy.  Otherwise, it was excellant.

The gravy in this recipe was very good. I tried the fried chicken, but I found that the chicken started browning to much and ended up burning. I didnt have the grease real hot either.

This chicken was great!  Perfectly crunchy and tasted wonderful with the gravy.  My gravy was a little thin, but next time I think I'll just add a little corn starch.

This recipe defintitely had the "downhome goodness" going for it. I am from the south, and really enjoyed this one. The only changes that I made were adding 2 TS of chicken buillon granules in place of the poultry seasoning (because I didn't have any.) With the gravy, I added 1 TB of cornstarch to a little bit of cold water, to thicken it up a bit. I will definitely make this again.

This was definitely my best fried chicken to date.  The gravy was very good.  I think I left a little too much grease in the pan.  So, it was a little greasy.

OMG! I finally found the secret to great friend chicken. You do have to let it sit with the batter before frying. I let it sit a good couple hours and it was awesome! I had bone in split chicken breasts so I boiled them for a few minutes before coating them. Worked perfect!

Good as written, but also excellent (and a lot less calories) using boneless chicken breasts and frying them in 2T butter and 2T oil.  (Of course that amount of fat is negotiable!)

This was by far the best fried chicken I've had in a really long time. The gravy was money. The absolute best. I will be utilizing this recipe more often. I made a slight modification though. I marinated the chicken in a mixture of buttermilk (2 cups), 2tsp minced garlic, and 1/8 cup hot pepper sauce for up to 7 hours, but if time is an issue try to marinate at least for 2 hours. My family loved the gravy as much as I did. This recipe is a must have.

Southern comfort food at its best!  I have had a lot of fried chicken in my life, but this is some of the best.  The seasoning was perfect, the skin was crispy without being overly greasy and the meat was nice and juicy. I have never served gravy with my fried chicken before, but I probably will from now on.  Though I wasn't quite sure about it at first, I thought that this gravy was very good and paired perfectly with the chicken.  Only change was to use chicken bullion/water in place of chicken broth.  Served with white rice and Daddy's Fried Corn and Onions from this site.   This dish was sooo delicious and I can't wait to make it again.

Good basic fried chicken, for an hour, I brine cut-up pieces in buttermilk, 4 cups, and 1 cup table salt, dissolved. Then rinse chicken. Dry with paper towels well. Put dry chicken in flour mixture, I also add cayenne, 3/4 of flour is for chicken, rest, I add buttermilk and no egg.. dip floured chicken in buttermilk, then back in spiced flour. Then it sits at least 15 minutes. Can start shortening to melt in cast iron skillet during that wait time. Any-way, after frying, I drain off all but 1/4 cup shortening, add 1/4 cup seasoned flour, and on medium low heat, stir the flour until it turns a good yellow color, then I add the liquids slowly until the right consistency. About 4 minutes then. Sometimes I put the already fried chicken on a rack in the pressure cooker with a cup of water. Bring up to a jiggle on the pressure cooker, then stop cooking, let rest 5 minutes, and then you have the "original-recipe"-style for KFC like chicken. I would rather cook it myself and add the cayenne to the flour, instead of going to KFC. If she included cooking the flour for the gravy until it was yellow-colored, I would give her five stars. Thanks Gina.

My entire family agreed that this was the best fried chicken they had ever had.  I did not have poultry seasoning, but it was still delicious!  Thanks!

This was pretty good, but I've made and had better.  The only change I made was to marinate the chicken in buttermilk (seasoned with salt, pepper, hot sauce, crushed garlic, and a sliced onion), which always makes it more flavorful and juicy. I just wasn't all that crazy for the coating, so I'll keep looking.  Thanks for the post though!!

Exceptional...I will no longer buy fried chicken from the fast food chains.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and finished cooking the chicken in the oven.  Thank you for sharing this recipe and thank you to everyone else for the tips!

OH MY STARS (five of them!!)!!!! This was so incredible. The breading is PERFECT! The chicken stayed juicy. (I used boneless, skinless breasts.) IT was amazing and by far the best gravy recipe I've ever made and I am a horrid gravy-maker! Thank you for an amazing, scrumptious recipe!

This is by far the absolute BEST fried chicken I have ever made. My husband loves for me to make it and I found this recipe, and I will never make another! The coating was absolutely perfect. The gravy was delicious as well. Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!

My whole family just devoured it and then kept asking for more!!! I made this the other night with just 4 boneless, skinless breasts cut up into small pieces and it still turned out fantastic!!! Made mashed tatters and poured gravy over the tatters as well. Another suggestion if you don't want the gravy, nix it and just add your favorite dipping sauce!! Will be adding to the regularly used recipes.

Oh wow! Absolutely fantastic without a doubt. My husband said its the best chicken I have ever made for him! I have never been able to make decent gravy, always lumpy, and this was perfect. Unbelieveable. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, it will certainly be a part of my family recipes from here on end!

I tweaked the recipe a little bit - I used buttermilk instead of the milk and egg mixture. The coating was too crunchy for us, we like ours more crispy (there's a difference). Next time I'll skip the milk and just season and flour it, like my dad always did. I deep fried breasts, wings, and drums and the flavor of the meat was really good. I took the advice of another reviewer and let the chicken sit in an ice water-n-salt bath before cooking - I still had the icky veins! The "brine" did help season the meat, though. I did make the gravy and it was delicious, but next time I'll skip it. The family liked the chicken more than I did.

I pretty much just eyeballed the seasoning for the flour coating. The chicken turned out so moist and flavorful. Husband liked the gravy more than I did. Thanks!

I give the chicken a 5, but I would only rate the gravy a 3 at best. For some reason it never thickened up like I thought it should and I didn't really care for the flavor either. (For what it's worth, I am fairly experienced at making gravy, but I don't know what happened with this one.) The chicken was fabulous though. I used breast pieces cut into strips because it cooks faster (5-8 minutes each side) with less guess work than bone-in chicken. Also, with the egg mixture I used buttermilk, but it probably didn't make a noticeable difference in the outcome.

I am rating only the gravy portion of this recipe.  I made fried chicken from another recipe on this site because I didn't want to do the whole wet, dry coating which I like, but just didn't feel like it.  I did make the gravy and after tweaking it a bit, it turned out just fine.  I used half milk and half cream. I thought the original seasoning was too powerful of a taste and maybe I added to much to the flour in the way of garlic salt.  I just added some more grease from the chicken pan and then my husband raved about the mashed potatoes and gravy the entire dinner.  I found it just alright and nothing extrordinary but it is easy to make.  I will have to try this chicken recipe sometime although I thought the one I made was awesome.  I learned great technique which is what I now believe makes the whole thing a success!  Cooking in Crisco and covering it to finish cooking after browning are key.  The other one had the same suggestions as this.

I made this twice so far, and the family has voted this into the weekly dinner list. Great recipe simple ingredients. I use half the oil, and use boneless chicken breasts.

yum yum! I also used boneless chicken tenders, cooking longer than I normally would. They were wonderful, almost as good as the gravy. I used others suggestions of using more spices. Next time I will make twice as much gravy.

This is really a great recipe. Like so many others I upped the spices a little.  I also mainated the chicken in salt water for a few hours. Don't crowd the chicken if you have to use two pans, other wise you may have bald chicken legs like me..... the gravy is also to die for.  My Dutch husband loves my southern cookin.

I thought this was pretty good.  I used up a package of chicken thighs for this.  Thought the coating was very pretty when fried up and the gravy had a nice taste.

This was one of my first dishes I tried from this site. The Fried chicken was AWSOME!!! I really think the key to it was the dipping it in flour then egg wash then back into the flour. The batter stayed on and it was nice and crispy. My girls love the crispy skin off of chicken and they had plenty of it with this dish. The gravy was easy and good also. I've never been able to make a homemade gravy before without it tasting like flour or grease. I've tried milk before to with no luck. But the chicken broth and milk made this gravy very simple and very tasty. If I can make this gravy anyone can. And you will want to double up on this recipe for the gravy to make more. I think any leftovers will be great on just a piece of bread or have biscuits and gravy in the morning. Thank you for the recipe. I will be making this one again and again.

When I made this last night I used chicken wings because thats what I had on hand.The crust was really good but the chicken needed a little salt before the coating is added. I will do that next time. The gravy was simply wonderful (yum yum). I really never coat my chicken with egg and milk, but I will from now on really good.

My first time with fried chicken.  I also doubled all the spices (except pepper) - thanks for that tip.  I made this for a picnic, so didn't make the gravy.  It was really great cold.  My family liked it - my husband was very impressed.

The best fried chicken I have ever had. We did not make the gravy because I ran out of flour, but the chicken is great without it. I would recommend this recipe in a heartbeat.

This fried chicken was really yummy!  I followed another reviewers suggestion & soaked the chicken in salt-water for a couple hours before I fried it up.  The gravy was really good too!  This recipe is definatly a "keeper" as we say in my home!

Was craving chicken and this is EXACTLY what I wanted! Needed a little more flour mixture for a 4 lb. chicken, but the flavor and consistency was awesome. Thanks!

This was the first time I've ever made fried chicken.  Me and my 9 year old loved it, but I agree with an earlier post that it needs to be spiced up a little prior to the whole battering bit and needs to be cooked just a little longer than 30 min.  Will make again!

Excellent! This was very easy to make and it was soooooo good! I used boneless chicken cut into strips, so I didn't actually have to cook it for 30 minutes, it was more like 10 minutes. My husband was amazed at this recipe, he said it was probably the best fried chicken he has had.

This recipe is really good! I also doubled the gravy and soaked my chicken breasts in buttermilk for a couple of hours, and if you saute onions and garlic when making the gravy it is really tasty, add whatever seasonings you like!

My first time making fried chicken and I was surprised how easy this was!  Instead of the egg/milk mix I just soaked boneless, skinless chicken breasts in buttermilk about 24 hours.  Then followed the recipe (except I didn't use nearly that much oil).  Added thyme, but that was it.  Hubby and I LOVED this chicken and the creamy gravy it made!

I am from the south and love to cook, but for some reason have NEVER made fried chicken.  I liked the sounds of this recipe b/c of the creamy gravy addition.  I followed the recipe EXCEPT for the poultry seasoning.  I replaced it with Lawry's Seasoned Salt (which I use in practically every recipe, so it seems).  I don't like chicken with a bone, so I used boneless chicken breasts.  Everyone LOVED this chicken and the gravy was so good served over the chicken and with rice.  I am sticking with this recipe for fried chicken.  Thanks so much!

My husband manages a fried chicken restaurant-not to mention his whole family is southern and cooking fried chicken is what they do best.  Having said that,  I made this with boneless, skinless chicken breasts and my husband couldn't stop raving.  He couldn't believe that it was just flour seasoning and not a marinade, it was so flavorful! We will definitely be making this again!

This chicken was very good.  The only changes I made was to double the amount of gravy and I added 1/2 teaspoon of poultry seasoning and some pepper to the gravy.  When in the mood for a good old southern dinner, this is it.

Delicious!!! My goodness this is GOOD. If your reading this, you must try it. My family loved it. I added a lil' corn starch to thicken the gravy and it was great! I served it with mash potatoes, veggies and corn on the cob. Thanx for a great fried chicken recipe Gina!

I had never made Fried Chicken before in my life, but had always wanted to. This recipe is a no fail recipe and came out better than grandma used to make!! My family raved about the chicken and the gravy! The 'mess' wasn't bad since I just cleaned as I went along. I would recommend this to anyone. Thank you Gina!

My first attempt at making actual fried chicken. It was very good and even made a mistake but did not get frustrated and it still turned out good. When I was making the gravey, I had some potato flakes in a seperate bowl and i grabbed that one and put the 2 tablespoons of that instead of the flour mixture. It turned out great and was not lumpy nor did it taste like any potatoes were in there instead. I also just used boneless chicken breasts and I am going back for seconds as we speak.

The texture was good, the chicken looked GREAT, preparation wasn't as bad as people previously mentioned (I always clean as I go), but in total honesty, we thought the chicken was a bit bland for us. Also, I passed on the gravy due to the fact that it wouldn't go with the rest of our meal (we didn't make mash potatoes).
I will be keeping this recipe but next time I make it, I will definetely add my touch and add lots more seasonings. 
Thanks for sharing this recipe with us!

This is the best fried chicken!  We have made it twice using boneless skinless chicken breasts, and it is wonderful.  The gravy is so good and a perfect compliment to the chicken.  Thanks for the recipe!

For so many seasonings listed in the recipe, it actually turned out quite bland for our taste.  It was not horrible, but I will not bother to make it again.

This recipe is excellent.  It is a definate keeper.  I cook my chicken in a wok, so that I don't have to turn the chicken (if you try this, be very careful, and make sure the wok is properly ballanced).

This is a whole lot of work but it is so worth it.  The chicken was awesome and the gravy tasty. If you've got the time don't hesitate to try this one.  Clean up is a pain as well but mmmmmmmmm good.

OMG the gravy is to die for! I did one extra step, after coating the chicken I put the pieces on a rack so the coating could dry a little. And since I didn't have Paprika I substituted Lawry's seasoning. FINALLY I can now make fried chicken. It came out perfect! I have tried for years to make fried chicken, and the coating would always come off, I'd burn it. NOW I can have fried chicken at home and forget take out. Thanks Gina!!

we loved the taste, i've been making fried chicken for years but i was never really happy with it, i think the browning then slowly cooking is the secret. it is messy, but it was worth it. delicious!!!!!!

This recipe was outstanding!   The gravy was incredible, although I doubled the amount of flour called for.  The kitchen is a disaster area, but it was well worth it!  I served it with mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, and biscuits and my husband says it reminds him of the home cooked meals he used to get as a child growing up down south!!  Hands down, the best fried chicken recipe I have ever made, as well as the best gravy ever served in this house!!!!!

For those of you who have never made fried chicken before, this is a NO FAIL recipe. I had tried other recipes and they were never crispy and always bland. This fries up very nice and is extremely easy to make. I used chicken legs and the result was perfection. I added 1/4 tsp basil and 1/4 tsp oregano and fried it up in 1 cup of shortening instead of using oil.

This is an awesome recipe! I have made fried chicken often in the past, but never as good as this was. The gravy was very nice, as well. Since you can never have too much, I doubled the gravy recipe and came out with quite a lot. It should see everyone through all the biscuits, mashed potatoes and other side dishes! 

My only complaint is that my entire kitchen is a shambles now. But oh, that chicken is good!

This is hands-down the best fried chicken I've ever had! I've tried making it before with other recipes, and definitely did not have these wonderful results!
I got rave reviews!  An easy five stars!

This was the best fried chicken I have ever made! I just changed two things:

1 - I added about 1/2 TSP Cayenne
2 - I double the flour portion (I always seem to run out)

Two yums up!

My grandmother and aunts have fried chicken for years. I was always hesitant to do it. I fried chicken for the first time, using your recipe. My mom said my grandmother and aunts have nothing on me. Thank you! Very good!

This was a huge hit! Even my father in law, who is incredibly picky, asked me to make it again. I followed the recipe for the most part. I did add a little more flour to the gravy and made it a bit creamier.

The best home style fried chicken I've ever had. Increased the heat with a ton of cayenne in the flour mixture cuz I grew up close to Mexico haha. Served with roasted garlic mashed baby Yukon golds. Everyone was asking for more even after it was gone...too bad!! =)

I liked this recipe a lot.  It was easy to follow and the seasonings are a tasty combination.  My only
complaint is I found the flavor on the chicken to be a bit faint.  I think I will just increase the amount of each seasoning next time I make this so the flavor really stands out.  Other than that, this was a yummy meal!

This was so easy and so fast! I used chicken tenderloins, so it cooked in about half the time. Also, I used less oil and it worked perfectly. Love this!!

Good recipe.  Rating 4 stars because I did not follow the seasonings exactly.  I added cayenne, more garlic powder, salt, pepper, & dried thyme.  I think used as written would have been too bland.  And as to the complaint of too much oil:  It depends on the size of pan you are using.  3 cups was perfect for me.  I used a 11" cast iron skillet.  The crust was very crunchy!  I think its the addition of the egg.  I've never used egg in my Fried Chicken recipes before.  Thank you for this recipe!

This is my dad's recipe except he used buttermilk as he always had it in the house. If you find your gravy is too funny add a slurry of cornstarch and water to thicken.

If you think this I good, try frying it in a cast iron skillet!  Just like I used to make when I was younger. I am 69 now.  The best thing to use is the seasoned flour.  Maybe just add some more pepper.  Definitely double the gravy!

This is the best fried chicken I've ever made.  For the simple reasons being that I doubled the spices, used a cast iron skillet, and soaked the chicken overnight in milk (with some apple cider vinegar in it).  I rinsed off the milk & patted dry with paper towels.  Another key is to not have the chicken too cold so I left it out for about 30 minutes after drying it.  This way it doesn't bring the temperature of the oil down and you have a nice crispy coating.  The gravy was over the moon good too!  I made skillet biscuits before frying the chicken too.  And an apple skillet cake before that in the morning.  It was a wonderful Sunday Skillet Supper!

Tried this recipe and the chicken and gravy both were both excellent, the best I have ever made. Thank you for the recipe. Today I'm making potato salad to go with the left over cold chicken. Here it is 8 AM on a beautiful July morning and my mouth is watering thinking about that chicken. Ha ha. Guess I'd better pull up your potato salad recipe next, thanks again for making my chicken dinner a winner with every one who tried it. JD

This was delicious!!! The next time I make this, I have to remove more than 2 tablespoons of the oil though. The gravy was a bit too oily since I only fried 6 pieces of thighs. Although, I will be using this recipe in the near future for a party. :)

I wish I had the reviews before making...but I followed recipe exactly and, for me, the dredge is a bit bland....I think I would've  tripled the spices. The crispness was great and a good basic recipe to start from, so I'll make it again with the addition of more spices. The gravy was good.

BEAT'S KFC HANDS DOWN! TO DIE 4 ! FOOLPROOF! SOUTHERN FRIED AT IT'S BEST! We love fried chicken but no matter what I tried it was either overdone,dry,or pink. Until I ran across this recipe! IT'S THE BOMB !  My husband LOVED IT! CRISPY, JUICY, & NO PINK!  
I read the reviews and made some changes: 
Soaked the chicken pieces in salt H2o at least 2-4 hours b4 cooking. (plan on the buttermilk soak someone suggested next time)  I use a deep dish for the flour mix, it seems to stick better 4 me & I always double dip.  I changed the amount of flour & seasonings to:

2 1/2 C Pancake mix instead of the flour. 2 T Garlic Powder. 1 T Paprika. 1 T pepper. 1 T salt. 2 t poultry seasoning.  I cooked it in a heavy bottomed stock pot (no grease splatters), in Hot oil till golden honey color, then cooked it in 300* oven on a lightly greased cookie sheet for 35 minutes.
Cant thank you enough 4 sharing your recipe! We'll b having fried chicken more often now.

This is exactly how my mom used to make chicken.  Thanks for helping me find that exact flavor once again.  Came out PERFECT and was really easy.

This was great.  The only thing I changed was the cooking process.  I used boneless/skinless half-breast, I quickly browned them, placed them on a baking sheet and then baked them at 350 degrees for 15 minutes while I made the gravy and mashed the potatoes.  My family really liked the flavor of the breading and the gravy and so did I!  Thank you!

And now I finally know what I have been doing wrong all of these years - not enough oil.  Gina, fantastic chicken.  I'll never buy it out again, that's for sure.  This is a winning recipe.  I did use one reviewer's note, and used some Lawry's Seasoning Salt in the flour mixture, but the technique here is perfect.  Absolutely excellent!  On the gravy - I use a totally different technique, so I didn't try this way.  Thanks for saving me from KFC!

My fried chicken is usually pretty dull, but this was perfect! I didn't make the gravy, just because I didn't have time since I got dinner started late, but the chicken was delicious! I did change a few things. First, I used half flour and half cornstarch, based on other recipes I read. Next, I didn't use poultry seasoning, since I didn't have any, but did use ground fresh sage. I didn't use as much pepper, as I was feeding it to our children. Oh, my oldest thought it would be a great way to make chicken nuggets- which she won't usually eat. Thank you, Gina!

Oh my! This was deliscious. This was my very first time to ever cook fried chicken and I wasnt sure what to expect but this basic recipe is superb. I had very few modifications. We only keep 1% milk in my house so for the chicken I used 1/4cup milk and 1/4cup heavy cream. I didnt have any poultry seasoning on hand so I used a bit extra paprika, garlic salt, and added a roasted garlic herb seasoning to replace the poultry seasoning. I followed everything else exactly as it was given. My husband said it was the best fried chicken he'd ever eaten! Thank you for an amazing moist chicken recipe.

My husband raved about this chicken. He said it reminded him of my mother's and grandmother's fried chicken. I have to say, it was delicious. I did not make the gravy but I will the next time. I am anxious to try the gravy. The next time I will cut the chicken breasts in half as they were the hardest to get done in 30 mins.

My first time rating a recipe on this site...This was amazing.  The only change I made was to use boneless, skinless chicken breasts as that is what I had.  My 2 1/2 and 5 year old fought over who was going to have the left over chicken for lunch the next day; only one piece was left.  My husband ate himself into a chicken and gravy coma.   Thank you!

This was allright. To be fair, I am only rating the chicken / breading. I did not attempt to make the gravy (even though I was REALLY craving it!). I had a little kitchen mishap. Not paying attention to what I was doing, I mistakenly forgot to turn down the heat after browning my chicken. Needless to say, there were quite a few extra brown pieces lol! Regardless of my mistake, the "OK" pieces were quite bland. I even doubled the spices called for. I guess there's nothing like the Colonel's chicken.... NOTE: I am not a pan frying gal. I hate the mess and wince at the thought of being splattered with hot grease. Having said this, I think a deep fat fryer would work great. I wish I would have gone that route. All in all, this was allright, but I think I prefer a crispier, thicker coated chicken. Thanks anyways, Gina. I'm sure my disappointment is 99% attributed to cook's error! :-)

Having not been gifted with the natural instinct and talent many tend to have in the kitchen, I have always found the idea of fried chicken a bit too daunting a task. I do however, love to cook, and I do also love to eat (fried chicken included). I must say that I followed this recipe to a T, and not only did I find it within my skill set, but with every bite I felt even more proud of my accomplishment. The chicken and gravy were DELICIOUS. And my family thought so too. I served with cornbread, mashed potatoes, and glazed carrots. A more perfect meal could not be found. Thank you... this one's a keeper.

this was my very first attempt at fried chicken...my hubs likes to change every recipe, so he preseasoned the chicken with lawry's season salt and added a 1/2 tsp of lawry's and 1/2 tsp spike to the flour mixture...it was AMAZING!  also, we had to modify the gravy due to not having enough flour mixture left to thicken properly.  thank you so much for sharing!

I didn't find the breading to have much taste, so I was pretty disappointed in that.  It did give me a beautiful looking piece of chicken though.  I know others love this, but I think I'll keep looking for the perfect recipe for me.

Scaled the recipe to yield 2 servings.  Did the following: (1) Substituted the required 1/2 tsp garlic salt with 1/2 tsp garlic powder plus 1/4 tsp iodized salt (2) Doubled the required ingredients for the flour mixture since I didn't want to run short for my 1 lb chicken drumsticks (3 pcs LARGE pcs) (3) Followed a reviewer's technique of frying each side of the chicken for 2 to 4 mins then placing the chicken in the oven which was pre-heated at 400F for about 30 to 45 mins (4) Followed a reviewer's technique of poking the raw chicken with a fork. However, since I hate bloody chicken, I still check the insides (near the bones) using a steak knife (5) For my gravy I used 1 TBSP frying oil, 1 TBSP flour mixture, 1/4 cup & 2 TBSPs chicken stock, and 1/4 cup & 2 TBSPs milk. I served the chicken with "Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread" and "Honey Butter".
Thanks for the recipe & reviews! :-)

Great recipe - I loved the gravy but my kids did not.  Kids really loved the chicken though.  Even my son who hates chicken loved it!  Thanks SO MUCH!

Very good - I did cook it a little longer and it was tender and moist.  I used 1/2 legs and 1/2 breasts and the gravy was very good on both.

The chicken was pretty good...but I didn't like the gravy at all.  It was so bland, and watery.  Probably won't make again.

It really is the the best!!!! I probably changed the recipe some, just cause I have a hard time following directions in the case that I like things to be my way. It really is Home Style Cooking. The best I've had so far. Better than restaurants! Thanks

Delicious! The gravy was unbelievable! I thought it was easy to make too. (Only had to use one skillet) I also just used chicken breast and it came out crispy and moist. Husband loved it too. A great stick to your ribs entree.

I didn't make the gravy, but followed the flour mixture measurements exactly.  I used boneless chicken breasts since that's what I had on hand.  After I shook them in the flour mixture, I dipped them back in the egg and then into seasoned breadcrumbs.  I baked them at 400 for 25 minutes, since we're trying to cut down our fat intake, and they were fabulous!  Not as crunchy as fried, but still very good.  Even my super picky daughter who hates chicken liked them.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I can't wait to try them with the cream sauce next time!

OMG! I think the best part of the recipe was the gravy!  And it was also so easy to make. I browned the chicken then baked it in the oven for 20 minutes at 375.  I think the only thing this was missing was cornbread.  I think I'll either make some cornbread next time or just pick some up at the store.  Will make this again for sure!

This was my first time making fried chicken. I liked this recipe, I have to say it came out pretty good for the first time making fried chicken. I have a tendancy to overcook meat, so I just followed this recipe to the T and it came out perfect. My husband even liked it, and he usually does the meat. Thanks for sharing

Yummy. I used boneless skinless chicken breast and flattened them out. It was very good. I used cayenne pepper instead of black pepper and left out the poultry seasoning. Thanks.

Great recipe!!!  I made this with chicken wings and it turned out perfectly crispy.  I did add cayenne and Lawry's seasoning salt.   I did not have poultry seasoning on hand and it turned out really good still.  I did not make the gravy but it sounds like a tasty recipe as well.  This is a keeper!

I really can't comment on the chicken because I used my own spices and fried the chicken.  I am reviewing this recipe for the Creamy Gravy.  The Gravy was good, nice flavor but I wish I knew how my Mom made hers because I miss the it.  But this gravy was good and I will try again.

This was really simple and really good.  We were running out of ideas for food and trying to use what we had and this fit the bill.  I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Everyone raved about it, and my two-year-old kept asking for more and more of the chicken.  It went great with mashed potatoes and corn.  Not exactly a health-conscious dish, but good for some nice comfort food without having to go to a restaurant.

This is seriously the best fried chicken and gravy I have ever had/made! The only changes I made were that I only used chicken thighs (bone in, skin on) and I didnt have any poultry seasoning so I used some sage, thyme, and onion powder. I served it with potatoes, corn and biscuits... soooo good! There are few things I like more that biscuits and gravy and this gravy was freakin fantastic with the biscuits. This will now be the only fried chicken and gravy recipe I will ever use!!! Well worth the 5 star rating!

MMmm Mmmm GOOD! I used boneless skinless thigh portions, and Oh goodness it was out of this world! Hubby loved it, so I made it again for his lunch a few days after, only this time I made it as popcorn chicken...=) Now when he asks "what's for dinner?" and I say "fried chicken" I get a "OoOOooh" reply...and I've never made him say that before about fried chicken...THANK YOU for this recipe!

I tried this last night when my cousins and grandma came for dinner. I skipped the gravy. I actually asked our cook to make it and gave her instructions and instead of 1 tsp of pepper she used 1tbsp. And we didnt have garlic powder at home so she rubbed crushed garlic over the chicken first. It came out very well. My grandmom said she loved the peppery taste when i told her we put too much pepper. My little cousin ate like 3 pieces and told me he's coming over today for leftovers.. too bad we don't have any!!

This recipe makes delicious fried chicken!! My husband (who is a steak man) declared after eating the boneless, chicken breasts I prepared last night, that it was better than the two famous Fried Chicken fast food places we have around here! I very rarely "fry chicken", but after his reaction, I guess once a month won't kill us.LOL I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding onion powder to the spices. My personal preference. I make pretty good cream gravy, but never used chicken broth before.  I will make it this way from now on. Thank you so much for the recipe!

This recipe is good, the chicken looks wonderful and although the dipping method is messy the chicken is very moist. This could have had 5 stars but I felt the chicken lacked salt, I added about 2 tbs of salt and lemon pepper and omitted the paprika in my second batch and it was a whole lot tastier.

I cut the chicken into bite sized peices and fried until browned on all sides, it was the most amazing fried chicken I've ever had and it was fun to eat!

I cooked this dinner and it was the best!  I used 1 egg instead of 3/4 of an egg.  I also substituted veggie broth for the chicken broth and used a natural seasoning called Herbamare instead of poultry seasoning. It was absolutely delicious, I would definately recommend it!!!

This was so good!  The gravy, I was a little skeptical at first because of the ingredients.  I mean, milk??  But it came out phenomenal!  Don't change a thing!  Used boneless breasts! Just make sure that the chicken breasts are pounded thin with a mallot.  Also with the gravy, make sure you whisk it well or you will end up with the dreaded "gravy lumps"

The chicken was delicious!  I think the gravey is really good, but I did not like all the spices in the gravey.  I think using just flour w/o the spices (other than salt & pepper) would make the gravey much better.

I don't eat chicken but I made this for my boyfriend and our friend. They loved it! It smelled so good, and I might use this with Morningstar "chicken" strips. It's really easy and this time around, I think I will dip as instructed, fry and then coat in another layer. Boyfriend really likes a thick, crunchy crust and I figure it'll be even better!

This recipe was very good. I made it with chicken breasts instead though, and it was still tasty. The only thing that i did not like was that I had trouble with keeping the flour on. next time I will do 3 dips instead of 2. Thanks!

Went the quickie route and used boneless chicken tenders instead and they came out delicious!!! No trouble at all. They fried up to such an appetizing golden brown color and were perfectly crisp. My boyfriend loved it, gobbled 'em all up.

This was good, but not fantastic. I liked the idea of the ingredients for the gravy, but had trouble with it not thickening as much as I wanted. My husband was not all that impressed either.

If you want it to be crispy just add saltine cracker crumbs. You can either use a blender, or just put them in a plastic bag and let out some aggression with a rolling pin or some heavy object. :) hope that helps!

This is a great recipe.  I'm rating it 4 stars because hubby thinks there is room for improvement.  I have celiac (gluten intolerance), so i substituted the flour for 1/3 c cornstarch, 1/3 cup potato starch and 1/3 cup Pamela's pancake mix.  This came out as crispy as if I'd made it with flour! Yea!!!  The only thing I would change would be to add some cayanne pepper as we like it spicey.  The gravy is GOOOOOOD!  I would have never thought of putting chicken stock and milk together in a gravy!

This recipe was ok, I would not give it a four star because it needed extra ingredients to enfuze the taste. I followed everything to the T, and the batter was not as crispy as I originally expected! Other than that, it was ok. My family ate it with no problems... Next time I will add baking soda.

WOW!!! This is one of the best recipes I have ever come across! The only thing that I did different was I seasoned my chicken with salt, garlic salt, and a chicken all-spice before I ever put it in the flour/spice mix.  I will be serving this again, soon!  Thanks!

good recipe if you like fried chicken.  I am not much into frying but my daughter requested fried chicken this evening.  I did like how the coating stayed on and it was very crispy and tasty.  I didn't cook my first batch completely and it was cooked for 30 minutes.  The next batch cooked for 35 minutes and was completely cooked throughout.

I've never cooked fried chicken before and was a little afraid to try it, but this turned out great!  I didn't have a whole chicken so I used chicken breasts cut into strips and used only 2 cups oil.  The gravy was awesome too.  My husband and I both loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was the best fried chicken I have ever made.  The coating actually stayed on the chicken, which I have always had trouble with.  I increased each of the seasonings just a little, and used some cornstarch to thicken the gravy a little more.  The gravy was wonderful.

im really sorry for the one star but......come on!!!! this really was NOT a hit.  I thought for sure after the good reviews that it would be.  I followed the recipe to a tee.  So much time for nothing. I guess everyone has there own favorite...... i'll stick to my own recipe from now on

Being so "Southern" and loving to cook the foods I grew up with, one would think I could cook up a wonderful fried chicken...NOT!!!...For some reason, I was always afraid of frying chicken...It was either, way over cooked or the seasonings weren't right...Thank you for a recipe I will hold on to forever...Tonight, I presented my family a wonderful fried chicken dinner with the works,mashed potatoes and field peas...You can't be more southern than that, unless you have collards, which I didn't tonight...I will have them next time.

This chicken was very good, and best of all, very non-greasy!  It was even good cold as leftovers the next day.  I did season the chicken with salt and pepper beforehand and omitted these from the flour mixture.  I didn't make the gravy, but the chicken was delicious alone.  Also it was done after 15-20 minutes (~8-10 minutes one side and the same the other side).  I didn't measure the oil, but it was almost a deep fry cooked in a 10 inch cast iron skillet.  Also, I was a little disappointed that the chicken wasn't crispy, but it was good nevertheless.

In one word: AMAZING!!!  The gravy was really flavorful and creamy.  I followed the recipe, exactly as printed, and it turned out perfect.  My husband couldn't stop talking about how delicious this was.  I have had problems with the batter from other fried chicken recipes I have tried.  This batter was excellent-it stuck very well to the chicken-it was crunchy-and it was full of flavor.  The gravy was the icing on the cake!  I served this dish with rice, and no one could resist topping it with the gravy.  This is one of those dishes were I won't have to worry about any leftovers!  Bravo, just excellent, a must try for any fried chicken lover!

Gina, my family loves this recipe. I've made it twice now, using boneless, skinless chicken breasts and both the chicken and gravy turned out perfect each time. Thank you so much!

This recipe is great!  I thought the gravy was perfect.  I used boneless skinless chicken breast.  I did double the ingredients for the flour mixture and the gravy.  I wouldn't change a thing on the recipe.  This was quick, easy, and delicious.  Thank you Gina.

My family and I love this recipe!  I do make a couple of changes: I sub buttermilk for regular milk when coating the chicken, I sautee 1/2 an onion and 3 cloves of garlic to add to the gravy, and I usually sub half and half for milk in the gravy when I am feeling particularily naughty.  A great indulgent comfort food!  Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful recipe!  A few modification: used 2 cups vegetable oil, 1 tablespoon garlic powder, did not use milk the beaten egg was good enough.  My chicken came out extra crispy, juicy, and yummy. However, I did not enjoy the gravy recipe - it was to startchy.  The chicken alone is worth 5 stars, but I would try to find another gravy recipe.   Thanks Marily!

The chicken tasted a bit bland since the seasonings were all on the coating.  I would recommend seasoning the chicken first before dredging it in the flour and egg.  I didn't try the gravy since I was serving the chicken with mac and cheese.  It was a nice recipe but I'll stick with how I usually make my fried chicken.

Excellent recipe...I always place the chicken in buttermilk overnight.  It seems to add flavor and keeps it very, very tender and moist.

This recipe was fabulous. The chicken was perfect; juicy, crispy and flavourful! I was a little skeptical about the gravy, but boy was I wrong! The gravy was divine, paired beautifully with the chicken and tasted even better over mashed potatoes! Thanks, Gina!

I was disappointed with the recipe after all the rave reviews I read.  I must have done something wrong because the chicken had no flavor.  It was however, nice and crunchy and the kids ate it anyway.

I have tried desperately in the past to recreate the cast iron skillet fried chicken my Grandma makes, to no avail. The chicken I've made in the past was decent, but usually turned out greasy. This chicken was excellent; not too greasy, crispy outside, juicy inside. The gravy was AWESOME. I went on and on about the gravy for two days afterward! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I've been making this recipe for years because it is the best. Use a cast iron skillet for the best results.  O.K. O.K.!  The kitchen's a wreak but the chicken and gravy are great!  A messy kitchen is the sign of a good cook! (and with this recipe, you will be!)

This is the best fried chicken I have ever made or tasted!  I just moved to the south and needed to learn how to make this favorite southern dish.  Every sunday after church we have fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy.  

I have made some changes to the recipe though:
instead of milk, I use buttermilk- if you really want moist and delicious fried chicken, let the chicken sit in the buttermilk overnight and prepare as usual.  

 I also don't have poultry seasoning but my chicken is still yummy.

My kitchen is always a mess afterward but well worth it.  I would suggest using a roasting pan to put the flour mix in, instead of a baggie.

My entire family loved this, and I didn't even make the gravy to go with it!  Only changes I made were to add Tabasco to the egg wash, and I cooked it for the 30 minutes covered, and then took off the lid to crisp for an additional 10 minutes.  Also, I used lard (I know, I know) but that's how my Grandma taught me to fry chicken, and the taste is unbelievable!  This is a keeper for sure.

Very similar to the one I use. You mgiht try soaking chicken in salt water for an hour before hand and pat try. I also use selfrising flour. Put the chicken on a cooling rack with paper towels under it, makes the chicken even less greasy. I have been playing with making perfect fried chicken for a long time, this is very good.

My husband and I both loved the chicken. It was crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside.  We thought the gravy was a little bland but I haven't made a lot of gray so odds are it was my fault! Hubby said the chicken was as good as his moms!

This is a FABULOUS recipe!!  One thing I could never get right was fried chicken... until now!!  I used diluted evaporated milk in the gravy and it tastes just like the chicken and gravy my 85 year old grandmother makes!  Put some good mashed potatoes and a salad on the side and you have a country-style meal that is simply delish!!

Outstanding dish - I used boneless chicken breasts instead and added cayenne pepper to the mix. A slurry of chicken stock and the flour mixture helped thicken the gravy to a great consistency. Kids asked for more....

Never attempted fried chicken before.  This recipe was so crunchy and delicious.  Best fried chicken ever!  Only suggestion would be to coat all chicken pieces before starting the frying.

I have been searching for a recipe like this for quite a while. I should have looked here sooner. this recipe is great just as written.  It was hard to stock to my diet and not to go back for more.

This recipe is fantastic, best fried chicken I've ever had. It's made me considerably less afraid of frying chicken since as long as you have enough oil to cover the entire bottom of the pan throughout cooking, and you keep flipping, it'll turn out perfect. I followed this recipe to a T but changed the spices since I didn't have garlic salt - i didn't pay attention to spice quantities either, I just kept tasting the flour with a dab of my pinkie after mixing it until I could vaguely detect flavor, and it was perfect. I personally used salt, pepper, smoked paprika, pizza seasoning, bbq spice, onion powder, and Montreal steak seasoning -- basically my point is that those seasonings were my favorite and the seasonings you use in this recipe ultimately don't matter, so have fun with it! (though note, if you make the gravy after it may be a bit too flavorful) Only half of 1 slice of chicken out of 5 breasts actually had the coating fall off during frying, which I find extremely impressive.

Oh my Goodness!  This sooooo appealed to my Southern Heritage.  This chicken was amazing and the gravy was the perfect top.  I  used chicken breasts only but followed the recipe as stated.  Can't wait to make this again!

This came out very good. I did use the whole cut up chicken. I deboned and removed the skin from the breast only. While the fried chicken was good, the breast was best with gravy on top because there was no skin to get soggy. I will definitely make this again but next time use only boneless skinless chicken breast.

This was really really good. The chicken was super moist and the gravy was a TOTAL win. Two tips: I used twice as much spice as called for as the amount that actually ends up on the chicken isn't too much. Also, I made twice as much gravy so I had yummy leftovers. My first time making fried chicken and I felt like a total pro. Don't use less oil as people have suggested. The amount is needed to cook it right. Also, I only did it ten minutes per side and it was perfectly cooked.

This fried chicken recipe was very tasty.  The gravy was yummy but I had to add a bit of salt at the table to enhance the flavor.  It will definitely be repeated.  My husband raved about it.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I've made many different versions of fried chicken and this one takes the crown. I do have a few suggestions that I did when making this dish that I'm sure others will agree with or find helpful. The first is to increase the dry seasoning and rub some on the chicken before breading it. This will ensure that the chicken itself is full of flavour and not just the skin. I did add some chilli powder to the mix as well as we love spicy foods in my household especially our fried chicken. Second, I let the chicken sit for a few minutes before dipping it in the egg mixture and rebreading. Lastly, I only used two cups of oil and it was perfectly crispy. All in all this is an excellent recipe that has been added to my collection.

Very good! The chicken had a slight crunch to it and was very tender on the inside! One thing we did change though is instead of using the cook top we used a deep fryer for around 15 minutes.

This fried chicken turned out great. I soaked my chicken in butter milk for about 24 hrs first, plumps it up and makes  it juicier. The nice thing about this recipe is that you can modify the spices in the batter to suit your taste. After I took it out of the frying pan I let it sit on a rack over the paper towel so it wouldn't be soggy. 
I will definitely be using this recipe again. My partner has been missing southern fried chicken, he's happy with this recipe

if I ever have to impress somebody from now on this is what I'm making. I did have to do a little improvising based on the ingredients I had on hand but it was delicious nonetheless! I don't have poultry seasoning so I made my own, and instead of chicken broth in the gravy I added beef broth. Can't wait to take the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

Made this as directed, except I did not have poultry seasoning.  It still turned out DELICIOUS!  Thanks to the reviewer who pointed out that the heat of the oil made a difference - my chicken was crispy and only lightly greasy.  This is a keeper for my family!

I'm not going to down rate this recipe just because I had trouble with it.. It's obvious it's awesome based on taste! I used drum sticks and unfortunately didn't let them cook long enough :( (I'll never use drum sticks again, they were also bleeding.. Weird) I'm an amateur cook, even after 6 years, so I probably wouldn't try to butcher a whole chicken.. I'll play it safe and use boneless skinless chicken breasts next time.. Personal preference! But like I said, amazing flavor in what was edible! The gravy was also superb. Will definitely try again!

My first time making fried chicken and it turned out great!  I only did a few modifications on the recommendation of my friend.  I used boneless skinless chicken breast which I pounded to about 1.5 inches thick so it would cook evenly, and buttermilk instead of milk.  Also, I coated the chicken in the seasoned flour mixture, then the milk and egg mixture, then back in the seasoned flour.  I wanted to make sure the chicken was cooked all the way through so after frying I tossed them in the over to cook the rest of the way.  Chicken was moist and flavorful.  My whole family and our friends that were over raved about it.  Definitely a keeper.

This was my first attempt at fried chicken.  I bought an oil/candy thermometer just for the occasion! Then I read the directions wrong and tried to fry it in too low a temperature (metric system fail).  Once I got the temp right, I fried the chicken for about 4 minutes a side, and then baked at 400 (Mostly because my skillet couldn't fit all the chicken I wanted to cook).

I would suggest that anyone doing a larger batch of chicken should divide the flour mixture into two bags.  Use one bag until it's sticky and wet inside, then switch to the new bag.

The chicken itself was moist , but the outside was not as crispy as we wanted because I had started on the wrong temp.   Decent flavor but could use more seasoning.

The next time I try this recipe I will use chicken tenders and start the oil hotter!

I tripled the spices, too much garlic salt; I'm an idiot. When I make it again I'll be sure to tone it down some. However, the recipe is top notch and very authentic. I marinated the chicken pieces in buttermilk for 12 hours before dipping the pieces in the seasoned flower, then in the egg wash, then back in the flour. As another reviewer suggested, I cooked on each side about 4-5 minutes then into a 400 degree oven for 20-25 minutes.

I made this recipe as is. I found it too bland for my pallet. It is a great recipe to build upon, however.

I followed this recipe ALMOST EXACTLY with just 2 insignificant changes. I made no changes to the core of the recipe, but  I had 4 large, boneless, skinless chicken breasts on hand which  I pounded a bit and cut in half .(across the breast) So I had 8 pieces as called for in the recipe. 

I was concerned that there would not be enough flour, so I used a recipe and a half of the flour/seasoning mixture. It turned out that I had just about the right amount of flour without wasting too much in the end. 
Other than that I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.
I did not change the seasonings or their ratio at all. The seasonings in this recipe are perfect. 
The 3 cups of oil were spot on, I fried 4 pieces at a time.
My ol' man said the chicken was really tasty and juicy. We both loved the gravy. 
This is exactly what I have been looking for as far a good home-style comfort food gravy recipe and I finally found the right seasoning/flour blend for that good old fashioned fried chicken.
This is my new go to recipe. Thanks Gina!

I made this but I had to add salt and an extra TBLSP of flour. I also used boneless chicken breasts and tenderized them with my rolling pin. After adding my things to this wonderful recipe it was fabulous!!

Made a few changes only because I didn't have the ingredients. I substituted the poultry seasoning for thyme and rosemary instead....everything else was done exactly as the recipe called for. We hardly eat fried chicken but this was for a special occasion and will definitely make it again. My family absolutely loved it. The gravy was a hit, too!! We're all so stuffed now but completely satisfied. Thanks for sharing!

Very good, and easier than I expected.  After reading the reviews, I doubled all of the spices.  I also held out 2 T of the flour mixture for the gravy before using the rest for the chicken.  The coating stayed on beautifully.  I only gave it four stars because of the guilt that comes with deep frying.

Spices were spot on.  My husband said this is the best fried chicken I've ever made--and went on to add that it may be the best homemade fried chicken he's ever tasted.  I've always made cream gravy from the pan goodness, but must say the carryover from the flavoring did make it seem richer than my usual gravy.  Thanks for sharing!

I doubled the spices and made double the gravy and used skin on, bone in chicken breasts. The whole family loved it. I rated it 5 stars anyway because the spice combinations and cooking times were great.

I followed this recipe exactly and then when I got to adding the chicken broth i misread and accidentally added two cups instead of one. i added more milk to try to even it out but gravy is very hard!  I read a lot of reviews which said to make sure the heat is way up to avoid greasy chicken.  I did even though the hot oil scared me and it turned out great. I even cooled on a rack above a paper towel to avoid the grease like one awesome reviewer said to do. This combination was perfect too, the breading didnt fall off at all and the chicken was just right!  I have a dull pallet so i would add more spices but my bf loved it as is.  will definitely make again, very good and pretty easy!

I just don't get what all the rave is about.  I thought the breading was blah and the gravy tasted like grease.  Not great at all.  Would not make this ever again.  Made it just as the recipe stated.  I even tested the temperature of my oil before frying and the batter still didn't want to stay on all that great.

Made this recipe for the first time.  I have never made successful fried chicken . Got this recipe in my email and decided I would give it one more shot. I made it exactly like the recipe. I did not change a thing and it was awesome.  My husband and 14 year old daughter said it was a definite keeper.  Will not be eating fast food fried chicken any more. The gravy  was a hit also.

I used chicken breasts for this. It was excellent! Watch the oil temperature. I did two batches and the second came out a little to crispy because the oil was to hot.

Very good. I didn't have poultry seasoning or paprika so I added a little salt, onion powder, and a few shakes of cayenne. I will be fixing this again.

Not what I expected. Chicken was burned and undercooked. The gravy was good, though, will use that part of the recipe again.

This was great! So easy, and the ingredients were all things I had on hand. Modified a bit by using chicken breasts and baking them for 20 minutes at 400 after frying in oil on both sides for 4 minutes. Delish!

As a 'Bama girl who is stationed in Japan...sometimes I crave Southern food.  And this hit the spot.  I did add a little more of the seasonings, but that's the only thing I changed.  Amazing, very good recipe.

This chicken was amazing! I had never made fried chicken before and was craving it. I didn't change anything on the recipe and it came out great. I am a decent cook but my hubby thought this was by far, one of my best meals!

Delish! I made some alterations. I added extra herbs & spices: such as rosemary& red pepper. I had 5 b/l s/l chicken breast, in abowl I mixed all my herbs & minced garlic in a bowl, dampened it and rolled my chicken in it. Then floured and dipped & refloured. I also cooked the chicken in 1 1/2 cup of smart balance, it turned out delish. I paired it with homemade mashed potatoes and a veggie mix of green beans, corn & sweet peas with a diced onion steamed with 2 cap fulls of extra light olive oil. The gravy was yum yum yum. It was simply delicious.

Great chicken, but I used this recipe mainly for the gravy-I could have eaten the gravy by itself!  Mixed 1 egg, milk and some of the seasoned flour, and poured that "batter" into the plastic bag I had my seasoned chicken marinating in.  From the bag, into the flour, into the hot pot-perfect!  Gravy needed a bit of salt, so I crushed some chicken bullion cubes to add more flavor as well as salt.

By far the best fried chicken recipe i've ever had. I made a few changes by pre-seasoning meat before battering. Very delicious recipe! It gets 2 thumbs up from me!!

This was a good change of fried chicken. My husband used half pancake mix (by mistake) instead of flour and surprising it was really good. I would definitely make this again. My husband did go to another website and added some extra spices, but other than that he followed the recipe and it was really good.

I do not like any form of fast food fried chicken, KFC..nasty! This recipe however was awesome. It was the 1st time I've ever attempted to make fried chicken and is far better than any other I've ever tried. Even my boyfriend who usually gives my new recipes a so-so, told me to rate this as high as I could. Only thing I did different was to dip the chicken in each mixture twice & let it set 10-15 mins before adding it to the pan. Thanks for opening my eye to the goodness of fried chicken!

WOW!!! Hubby was soooooooooooo impressed, he said it tasted just like his mom makes, in fact he thought his mom did make it and sent it over, he couldn't believe that she didn't!!! Definately a keeper, will be making over and over and over, but next time without the gravy, the gravy was the only thing that no one really cared for.

So yummy and easy to make!  My family is very picky eaters, so I was a little nervous about the spices.  But they blended well and my fam didn't even know there was garlic in it!  They loved this chicken!  I didn't have paprika so I used seasoned salt which had paprika and garlic in it, (I added more garlic anyway). Turned out great! Thanks for the recipe! I didn't make the gravy.

I made this for dinner last night, without the gravy, which is why I am only giving it four stars. I dipped it in the egg and flour as suggested. My family loved the chicken. I will make the gravy next time and then rate again.

Oh my is this delicious!  I followed it exactly but added garlic and onion powder and a touch of red pepper to the flour mixture for "bite".  I also used boneless chicken breast and thighs because we don't like to contend with bones - just our preference.  The gravy is simply outstanding - smooth and satisfying.  Definitely wonderful comfort food for a cold fall or winter meal!

HOLY SMOKES!!! This is some good stuff. You could put this gravy on almost anything and it would taste good. I didn't change much except to bump up the seasoning a bit. The chicken was excellent as well. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was so good! I've never made fried chicken before and was suprised at how easy it was. I added more spices and used boneless thigh and drumsticks.  The gravy was good also, I just wish it had a little more chicken flavor but I could probably jazz it up a little next time.

This was so so so so good!  I loved it so much and have made it twice.  The first time I used chicken drumsticks and boneless skinless breasts.  The second time I made it with just the breasts.  This makes the best gravy I have ever had in my life.  Mmmmmmm.... Thank you so much for this recipe!

Everything about this recipe was great.  I doubled all the seasonings and added chili powder to the mix.  That was all I changed. I would love make this weekly but I don't want to be 400lbs.

This fried chicken is delicious. Since I'm only cooking for two, I usually just use frozen chicken breasts, so I don't have enough drippings for the gravy. I have made the gravy a few times and it is outstanding.

KFC's recipe isn't a sercret anymore! Made this in my deep fryer and amazed myself. Never had fried chicken come out so perfect. Color, crispness, moist and tasty. The batter never fell apart or fell off. Took about 20 mintes for a cut up 4 lb. chicken at 450. This was even better than KFC! Will never make fried chicken any other way.

This is just terrific. I thought the oil sounded like an excessive amount, but it cooks them"just right". The crust on the chicken is to die for! Gravy is just as good1

I have attempted fried chicken a few times and was never happy with the results. Until now. This worked out well!  I did double the seasoning as others suggested but other than that followed exactly including cooking times.  Thank you Gina

This recipe was so/so. As far as taste, my hubby and I prefer KFC. It was pretty time consuming because we had to thaw our chicken. My husband said it wasn't worth all the time and energy it took for the taste. The gravy, however, was very good and we will be making it again.

My husband wanted to make fried chicken and mashed potatoes last month so I gave him this recipe. Oh my! It was so delicious! My mother-in-law was over for dinner and just raved also. I expected it to be greasy but it was not. Great recipe. We are having it again tonight. Thanks Gina! :)

My 6 yr old asked for chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy with corn. So i found this recipe. The flavor was really good. I did add my own spices. It was great but extremely greasy. And i love greasy foods. Will make again since my daughter loved it so much. Thanks!!

I have never fried chicken before but knew I didn't want to in the house because of the lingering smell and layer of grease it leaves. Last summer after Hurricane Isabel and we had no power or phone for 10 days, my neighbor simply cooked it in peanut oil in a stockpot on the burner on her grill. Well, we finally tried it with this recipe and it turned out wonderful. We liked it better after doubling the spices. We used it on boneless, skinless chicken breasts and sliced zucchini. Both cooked up in minutes. We drained it on paper towels set on top of grocery bags but really there was very little greasiness in the first place. We dipped it honey mustard. Clean-up was a cinch and the house still smells good. We didn't try the gravy because we felt guilty enough eating fried! :)

This was really easy to make, it was a mess, but not that much to clean up!  I thought this recipe was yummy!  My family loved it too, there was just enough seasonings for them (I did add a little extra seasonings I can never have enough seasoning!)

The gravy tasted wonderful, next time, I will double the gravy for the chicken and mashed potatoes!

Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty, but for some reason the breading kept falling off of the chicken, I think next time I make this I will add more of the flour ingredents.

I marinated my chicken for about six hours in a quart of buttermilk and about a quarter cup of hot sauce. The gravy was really good, but I did need to add my own seasonings to perk it up. The only problem I found was that the chicken wasn't as crispy fryed in the skillet as it is when I use my deep fryer. Overall a good recipe that my whole family really enjoyed. Thanks Gina!

Thank you!! I made this for my husband last night and have finally made him and "excellent" batch of fried chicken. He gave it an 8.5, said it was close to a 9. Only his mom's recipe ( which we don't have, unfortunately) gets a 10....he loved it...

My family and I really enjoyed this chicken. I thought that it was remarkably juicy and tender, especially considering I didn't marinate it or use buttermilk! The gravy was very good as well, really cements the "down home" taste of the dish. Will make again!

my family and friends all thought this was wonderful, the only thing I would change is a little more garlic, but then I am a garlic nut.

This recipe is extremely good...I also use it as a way to make GREAT chicken fingers...the chicken fingers need more salt than the chicken recipe, though...thanks!

I must have done something wrong.  Not that tasty or crisp.  The gravy also was very blah.  The reviews were so good I couldn't wait to try it.  Surely I must have done something wrong.
