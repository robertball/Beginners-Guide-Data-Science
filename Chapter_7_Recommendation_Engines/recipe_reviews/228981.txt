A very delicious recipe!!  We enjoyed every bite and it was sooooo good we both overindulged and ate more than we should have. I added another TBS olive oil and TBS lemon juice/garlic to the dressing because it just wasn't enough to cover the salad and drizzle over the tuna. Let me mention that I don't like a lot of dressing saturating my salad or food so it was just right. I made the dressing early in the day and let it marinate in the frig for several hours, it was quite tasty and I didn't find it to be too oily at all.

Excellent.   Used a small avacado and small mango.   Skipped the peanuts and the chow mein noodles.   Doubled the ingredients in the dressing recipe except the oil, leaving it at 2 T.  Salt and peppered and rubbed the tuna with sesame oil before grilling  2-1/2 minutes on each side.   The flavor of the mint and cilantro was surprisingly delicious and fresh.
