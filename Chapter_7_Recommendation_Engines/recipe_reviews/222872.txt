This is a very hearty stew. I didn't have ranch-style beans so substituted a 6 bean blend. I also cut the meat down to 1 lb. but kept everything else the same and it still makes lots.

Cowgirl Stew Haiku: "Yee-haw this was great! I just love Ranch-style beans! (I used the crockpot.") The only minor adjustments I made were reducing the ground beef to 1 lb. and the potatoes, and adding a handful of chopped carrots too. Oh, and the recipe didn't specify what type of canned tomatoes, so I went w/ stewed, which worked out well b/c my young daughter thought this was amazing, so long as I scooped out the larger chunks of tomato, which was easier that way. Dumped everything in the crockpot b4 work, and wow, was my nose assaulted w/ the most awesomest of aromas when I returned home. Can't wait to make this in a larger batch to freeze for chillier winter nights.

this is awesome! Thank you! From reading the rest of the reviews I decided I'd try just a pound of beef instead of 2 and it worked out great. It just depends on how much beef you'd like per spoonful :) I also added a 15 oz can of black beans because I love them and they were a nice addition, a whole diced jalapeno pepper, and about 3 times as much sugar as the recipe calls for - I personally like beef stews/chilis to be a little sweet. Because I added some things, I added two cups of water to the recipe as well. I probably ended up using about a tablespoon and a half of salt. It's great with a shredded cheddar blend sprinkled over it, and some avocado slices! And it ended up being enough to feed me for a few days, and to share!

It's so nice seeing everyone substituting ingredients and changing measurements because this recipe is BORN to do this!  More meat, less meat; More spices, less spices; Different kind of beans; no potatoes but rice; I've done it all sorts of ways, just depending on what I have on hand and who I'm cooking for.  

If I'm making this for my son and husband, I add tons of crushed hot pepper flakes because they love things hot & spicy, but I don't dare eat it that way, so I take out some for me before I add it.  

The mark of a good cook is making a recipe their own, and it makes me happy to see that great cooks are making, reviewing and eating this recipe.  I plan on trying some of these changes myself-thanks to all!

This is a wonderful recipe that lends plenty of leeway for someone to gussy it up to suit their own tastes! Someone asked what Ranch Style Beans are. They are actually a brand of beans. Pinto beans in a sauce. You might google to see if there are copy-cat recipes, should you wish to make your own, or if you just want an idea to see what goes in them. 
There may be similar brands of beans that could substitute should you not be able to find them. Walmart does carry this brand, so you may want to check with them.

This makes a lot, so be aware of that when you make it. This soup is good but needs additional seasoning, which would probably be different for every family. It is somewhat similar to Taco Soup if additional seasoning were added.

I cooked it in slow cooker. The smell reminded me of soup my mom would make when I was a kid. We called it her kitchen sink soup, as she would take leftovers and make a soup. Will make again but cut the meat down to 1 lb. It was to much for just my husband and myself.

OK, I hate it when users here change the ingredients and give the original recipe a low rating. I didn't have a few of the main ingredients, but this recipe inspired me to try it with what I had on hand... Don't laugh, but I made some huge changes, lol, I didn't have ground beef, so I substituted a couple of chicken breast halves for the beef... I didn't have ranch-style beans so I used a can of regular pork'n beans... still not done, lol... I didn't have frozen corn so I used a can of early peas, so even with these radical changes, this was WONDERFUL!  The secret is the sauce, so it didn't matter what protein used (beef or pork stew meat would work too)... I was a little hesitant about the amount of chili powder as my family doesn't like too spicy, so I added a little at a time, and the two Tablespoons is just about right... I increased the sugar to about a teaspoon (why would just a 1/4 tea work anyway?).  This recipe is unique and very tasty... Hamburg Vegetable soup is different and shouldn't be compared... the spices and tomato and the beans blend together perfectly in this recipe!  I can't wait to use other meats in it, as I think just about anything would work.  Thank you Paula T for sharing this recipe!

Excellent! Perfect as is. Just a touch of liquid smoke and various mixed spices livened it up. Surprisingly delicious with sauvignon blanc.

This was good, but needs more spice--maybe additional chili powder, I am not sure what.  Followed the recipe except substituted beef broth for water and added a splash of red wine.

Loved this recipe.  The only thing I changed was using 1 lb ground meat and 1 lb ground sausage.  Gave it a lot of flavor.  Will be making this again.  Great soup on a rainy/snowy day.

I used fresh garlic and briefly sauteed the celery, (added some fresh carrots) and a small onion. Whatever beans are in the pantry work ;) (that's half the fun of stews) We also used half ground beef and sausage. When it all cooked down and the potatoes were tender I added about 1/3 cup of a good BBQ sauce and a big shot of Valentino's hot sauce. The BBQ and hot sauce added some complexity and a nice rich flavor I thought the stew might benefit from. It went perfectly with BBQ ribs on our grill.

Hearty, easy, reasonably healthy. A little bland. Need to think up ways to introduce a bit more flavor.

A very tasty chili take on beef stew!  I added a tablespoon of tomato paste at the end of browning beef then added all the remaining ingredients plus a dash of cayenne for some heat .  Served with cornbread and cheese slices!  Yum!

Amazing soup!! Didn’t have canned tomatoes so I used Rotel instead. Would cut back in the potatoes next time. And I used 3 pounds of burger. Other than that is was a huge hit. Could use some seasoning was a little bland.

1 lb. of ground beef was plenty for me. I threw in a sweet potatoe along with the regulars. 2 cups of water was enough as well. it would be more like soup with 3 .

I used 1/2 hamburger and 1/2 spicy Italian sausage to give it a little more flavor. Also used green beans instead of corn.

I didn't have Ranch-style beans, so I just used kidney beans instead since I had them on hand.  I also had run out of onions and substituted half a tablespoon of minced garlic.  The quantity of my veggies seemed to exceed what was called for in the recipe, so because I was concerned about having enough flavor, I added a couple pinches of cloves and some coriander as well.  It was rather experimental, but it turned out delicious!

One of the best stews I have made! I substituted ground turkey for the beef, left out the bell peppers and instead added a bag of mixed frozen veggies that's made for soup. Served it up with homemade cornbread muffins and the meal was a success! My husband, myself, and our friends loved this. Will be making again for sure. Thank you for the recipe :)

* I used only 1lb of meat, a large can of Ranch Style Beans, 28oz can of petite diced tomatoes, red potatoes, onion, celery, actual garlic powder (about 1 tbsp), frozen mixed veggies bag (corn, green beans, carrots, etc.) extra chili powder, and salt n pepper to taste. Cornbread sweetened w/white sugar 1/4C per jiffy cornbread mix.  YUM

This was just great! I used cannellini beans and put a bag of mixed frozen veggies in (corn, green beans, peas).  It makes a ton, so I froze the rest. It is a very versatile stew, so I can imagine you can use whatever veggies you have on hand. I'm sure it would be good with ground turkey too.

Easy and good! I added season salt and a pepper blend. Made a huge pot, plenty to eat the next day or freeze for later.
