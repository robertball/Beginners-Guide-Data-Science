Wow!  I just made this recipe today and it was fantastic.  The only ingredient I didn't use was marjoram and that was because I didn't have any.  I will buy some and use it next time I make this.  This was the best swiss steak I have ever tasted . . . even better than my mother's!

Cloves?  Seemed odd and I wish I had listened to my initial instinct.  This ingredient does not belong in this dish.  It gave the dish an odd taste and smell that was overpowering.  I just couldn't get past it.  I started putting the steak on plates and decided I couldn't serve it to the family if I couldn't eat it myself! Sorry!

I've never had swiss steak, but I thought I'd give it a try. It's SO GOOD! I'm not a fan of cloves so they were left out. This recipe is definitely something I'll make over and over and, well you get it.

I tried this recipe tonight as I'd bought swiss steak but didn't know what to do with it.  All of the ingredients are normally on my shelf, so I tried it...YUM!! Perfect cold weather comfort food!  I thought it might be too tomatoey, but the flavors really blended nicely.  Even my 5 yr old who doesn't like beef ate it up!!

I've been wanting to make this for quite awhile and finally got around to putting in on the menu.  Instead of simmering on the stove, I baked it for about an hour and 15 minutes at 350.  It was amazing!!  The meat was tender and juicy.  I did leave out the cloves, but that's just a personal preference.  We'll definitely make this one again and again.

5 Stars!  Delicious and comforting.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes so used plain and didn't have marjoram but next time will use both of these and it'll be even better.  Serve with whipped potatoes!

This was a great, easy -to- follow recipe.  I ran out of tomato soup so I used 2 large cans of tomato sauce with 1 can of tomato paste (double recipe).  I also added chopped celery and red and green bell peppers.  I served over rice and it really was tender and tasty.

Absolutely loved this.  Very easy to make, ingredients are always on hand. Served with mashed potatoes. Next time I will add green peppers just because I like them. Thanks for sharing.

This was very good.  I'm not sure what all the complaints over the cloves were, but this seemed really good to me.  I'll make it again.

I made this a couple weeks ago to use up some braising meat I had bought. My husband was skeptical at best because he thinks anything that has to be pounded out and covered in gravey can't be good. After setting it on the table and him taking the first bite he commented that he was surprized at how good it tasted. Not only did he eat it all but went back for seconds and thirds. I'm going to try the sauce on chicken baked in an oven bag this weekend. Very tasty and good recipe Thank you.

My husband and I really liked this served over rice.  I added a chopped green bell pepper and some minced garlic.  Will probably cook it in the slow cooker or in a slow oven next time, but it was delicious!  I was skeptical of the cloves, but it just adds a nice flavor and was not strong.

Hubby couldn't get enough of it and it was SO moist and tender!  Great week go-to meal!  I was skeptical of cloves, but tried it anyway and it gave the dish and interesting twist! Will definitely make again!  :-)

This was so good! We loved the cloves. I didn't have any marjoram, nor do I know what that is, but I am going to get some and try it in this recipe.

Omitted cloves, as I didn't have any, and doubled the sauce, because I only had a LARGE can of soup -- this came out great.  My husband will eat anything and always thanks me for dinner, but he actually said "this is really good."  I've added this to my recipe box for sure......

Don't simmer on stove top. Instead bake in oven at 325f for 1.5-2hrs. I tried stove top and didn't have heat up high enough which caused beef to be tough.

I had to make a couple of minor changes based on what I had on hand:  used a can of Progresso tomato/basil soup, which is not condensed soup, so I drained some of the liquid from the stewed tomatoes.  I put in about 1/16 tsp of cloves and couldn't even taste it, so I don't see how another 1/16 tsp would be overpowering.  Initially this tasted a bit tangy for me, but it really started growing on me.  My son and husband loved it, and I even had a small second helping.  I would definitely make this again, but will try it with the condensed soup.

This is a perfectly wonderful recipe! Thanks for sharing it! Many recipes call for ketchup but the cloves and marjoram in this recipe make it so wonderful, like using a gourmet ketchup. This is a real keeper. I cooked it in the slow cooker. WOW!!! It disappeared from the dish immediately with some taking seconds! I will have to make more next time.

I didn't care for this recipe. I think it was the cloves that gave it a flavor I didn't care for. Normally I do like swiss steak though.

Just made this last night and LOVED it.  My mom used to make this and finally I attempted it and succeeded.  It takes almost identical to Hungarian Goulash.

This was very good...probably would have been perfect if I had allowed it to simmer longer (although it was starting to stick on the bottom).  I made it without the cloves and used fresh thyme.  Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!! My only modification was adding the tiny size tomato sauce and some sweet bell peppers. It was great on rice. Even my picky husband liked it.

This recipe was awesome! I did it exactly, I didn't add or not use anything and my husband loved it! So did my kids! I will definitely make this again!

Great flavor! I used less meat (1/2 of what the recipe called for).  I cut it into bite size servings so it ended up more like a stew.  Thanks for sharing!

This was the best, I really did not hold out hope that I would like this meal.  What a wonderful surprise. I added a 14OZ can of white beans drained and rinsed.  Normally Swiss Steak is not something I like.  Thank you for this recipe, I will be making this again.
