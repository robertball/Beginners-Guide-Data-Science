Don't let the long list of ingredients sway you from making this recipe. I just so happened to have most of it on hand. Just when I was about to give up trying to like spaghetti squash LilSnoo has changed my mind with this keeper recipe. Loved it! Also loved using homemade turkey chorizo. But I confess to never having regular chorizo before. Perfect mix of flavors. I didn't have the roasted tomatoes on hand so I used diced regular and I also used the mozzarella cheese I had on hand.

To make it easier to split the squash, I scored it and cut some small slits in it before microwaving for 5 minutes. I then roasted it as directed. I also prepared the 'chorizo' mostly as directed. The only change that I made was to combine an entire can of whole kernel corn (drained), an entire can of black beans (drained and rinsed), and an entire can of the green chiles with the diced tomatoes before simmering with the turkey. 

The grocery store only had one giant spaghetti squash (5.5lbs),. So, as another reviewer suggested, I turned it into a casserole. I removed the squash from the shell and placed in a lasagna dish. I then placed the chorizo mixture and cheese on top and heated as directed. 

We loved this and will definitely make it again. Though, it's quite time consuming, so it'll need to be a weekend

I made it as listed minus the corn, and it was fantastic!  I would say to add some butter or something on top of the fluffed squash before putting the chili on top, OR, mixing the cooked squash into the chili before putting it back into the shells.  It is hard to get a good balance of squash and chili in a single bite as written.    I don't know why people think this is time consuming, it's not. It took me maybe 15 minutes of prep time, plus the hour in the oven to cook.

Really delicious! I used ground beef because that's what I had.  I also left out the chipotle pepper cause I didn't have any and I used half the amount of hot paprika instead of the sweet since I didn't have that either. The recipe didn't suffer. I was pleasantly surprised that spaghetti squash could be so yummy. Even my very skeptical husband said he would totally eat this recipe again.

This was delicious! I used ground venison instead of turkey. Some of they ingredients in the recipe aren't listed in the beginning, but were easy to pick up on when reading the directions.

I made this pretty close to the recipe...I didn't let the flavors mix in the turkey for a full hour (maybe 20 minutes); I added a small can of drained diced chiles, a small drained can of corn, can of drained & rinsed black beans and a can of fire-roasted tomatoes (I will drain those next time); I pulled out the spaghetti squash after roasting and put it in a 9x13 pan, then put the chorizo mixture on top. I think draining the tomatoes will keep it from being too liquidy next time.

This was fantastic! I used Soy-Rizo and my husband didn’t even notice.  The squash helps mellow the heat. I squeezed lime juice into the squash before adding the meat.

Salt is a bit excessive so we cut it back to 1/4 tsp it was perfect.

Great recipe! I I used the whole can of corn and the whole can of beans and a whole round onion. More veggies, less meat. Next time I won’t add cinnamon or cloves. Personal preference, gives it a ‘sweet’ sensation.

This was very easy! If you’re one who likes this type of seasoning, go to Emeril’s chili recipe for his “essence”. It’s pretty much the same seasoning and I always have a batch on hand. I’m vegan so I used chorizo flavored seitan crumbles and I omitted the cilantro since I’m not a fan. It’s yummy and healthy and I’d definitely make this again.

tho myself and my child love the squash in general by itself, my husband is not a fan of the squash but he loves the stuffing mix. i will in fact make this again when the cold weather hits. it is a tad spicy for me but i will next time omit some of the heat.  this was my first time making this and it was AWESOME, goes great with tortilla chips as well.

Like another person said, don't let the long list of ingredients put you off. I had all of these on hand. My advice if you don't: build it up gradually, then make this. I LOVED this. I used ground chicken and fresh corn. I also used monterrey jack cheese.

What's not to love about this recipe?!  So much flavor, so easy to put together and so good for you.  I have another turkey chorizo recipe, but this one is so much better.  I had a really large squash so I  just layered the shredded squash into the bottom of a casserole dish then poured the meat sauce over it and topped with cheese and baked for about 20 min.
