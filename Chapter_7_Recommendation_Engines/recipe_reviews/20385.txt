I'm soooo disappointed! Disappointed that I wasn't able to partake in this recipe!  I did all the preparation so all my husband had to do was throw his chops on the grill when he got home.  He raved and said they were the best tasting vension chops I've ever made!  My 3 yr old loved them too and so I guess I'm going to have to make them again when I can be around to have my fair share! Thanx!

Very good recipe- I liked it a lot.  It did however erase ALL the gamey taste and that might be a problem for some.  It still was delicious meat- just didn't really taste like deer anymore!

Great, "new" taste for venison.  I used pounded backstrap rounds so it marinated and cooked much quicker. (30 min and 2 1/2 min/side) Very tender.  Don't go overboard on the rosemary or vinager....needs some, but not too much.

This was an AWESOME recipe, especially for those who are not too sure they "love" venison...my extremely picky 9 year old had about 5 helpings of this!  I cut up a deer roast into thick steaks and marinated for about 2 hours.  Next time I will marinate longer, but it completely removed the "wild" taste from the meat.  Perfect for me!!! I now don't mind my hubby coming home with alot of deer meat...

I am new at cooking venison, but this has to be the easiest recipe I have ever made for any kind of meat.  My husband was telling me I had to find some recipes as  we have a freezer full of venison.  This will definitely be a favorite.  Thank you for the reviews!!

I used backstrap. The only thing I added was a little liquid smoke. I marinated all night and half the next day and I wouldn't suggest that because the rosemary taste was so strong. I was thinking of cutting back on the rosemary next time. But overall compliments the venison well.

I did not change this recipe at all except I used the scaling down feature and used only 2 pounds of meat. I used 1 inch thick venison tenderloins and it turned out perfect. I am not a huge fan of venison, but this was really good. My husband the hunter really liked this and asked for the recipe for hunting camp!Thanks for the post!

DEEE-licious!  This should be Gordo's Great Venison.  Made it with venison chops and sirlion tips, baked in the oven, not grilled.  YUM! Trying it again this weekend, marinated longer (we only had about an hour and a half to marinate) and on the grill.  Excellent recipe - you could trick people who think they don't like deer with this recipe.

I am not really a venison person, but this is wonderful! I would recommend this to anyone who thinks venison is too 'gamey' for them. It tastes like the best steak ever!

I'm giving this four stars because the flavor was good, but it was very tough. That may not be the recipes fault.

I would rate this with maybe 4 stars, but gave it 3 because my husband didn't like it at all. He actually made a sandwich for dinner instead of finishing it. I think it'd be a better marinade for chicken rather than venison.

I made this last week for myself, and my 3yo daughter kept stealing pieces of my steak. It was wonderful! I wouldn't say it eliminates the "wild" taste of the meat so much as it complements it. The cumin really does the trick. I used leftover steak sliced really thin on quesadillas later. YUM! I was out of rosemary, substituted with marjoram. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Since winter finally hit Michigan, I ended up cooking the steaks under the broiler. I made sure to baste generously with the marinade. AMAZING recipe.

I give this recipe 5 stars for its maranade. However, I used less cumin, a touch more vinegar, and used chicken bouillon with the water and no broth. I also used dry herbs, but crushed in a mortar.  Instead of grilling, I prepared the marinated meat using the Venison Schnitzel recipe on this site. The combination of the two recipes gave me perhaps the best tasting fried venison I have ever had.

My Husband made this for a BBQ we had and everyone loved it. I had to print out the recipe for everyone at the party!
The meat didn't taste " Gamey" at all. Very delicious !

Excellent recipe. I made this for a group of non-venison eating people and they NEVER knew what it was until I told them. Great way to enjoy deer in the summer on the grill instead of the crockpot.

This was a very good recipe for venison.  My family and I were stuck in a rut using the same old recipe for venison - thank you!  Even our 4 year old son loved it!

In addition to my previous rating, I would also recommend making a double batch of this if you actually use 6 lbs of venison, and then reserving 1/2 cup of marinade for pouring over the steaks when they're done to further the affects of the seasonings.

This marinade is to die for. I use it every year. I package it with the meat prior to food sealing it for the freezer. When your ready, take out the meat and it soaks in the marinade while defrosting. Amazing!! Hope everyone enjoys it as much as I have!

Absolutely fabulous!! I didn't have time to marinade it very long, so I can only imagine that it could have been even better. Even my 2&4-yr-olds asked for 2nd and 3rds.  I used it on back strap. I didn't need 6 pounds of meat for just us, so I decreased the water to less than one cup and just added chicken bullion to that instead of the water and chicken stock. I also didn't have fresh parsley, basil & rosemary, so I used dried.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

wonderful recipe. i've never cooked vension tenderloin before, and this was easy. deer tends to dry out easily, and become tough, but the marinade kept it tender!
i cooked these on the stove, instead of the grill. i cooked the tenderloins in the remaining marinade, ending up with a nice sauce. came out perfect!

This was a nice change from the other marinades I use for elk and deer.  It wasn't terribly exciting, but it was a good change of pace.  I did add the liquid smoke as recommended by other reviewers and I'm glad I did.  Thanks!

Very good recipe.  Would work great on beef steaks also, especially if you are using a tougher cut that needs to be tenderized.

This was awsome!! it leaves just enough of the gamey flavor to compliment everything. The deer was so tender, and his age was estimated at 5 years. I will use this again and again. Thank you so much. Try cutting the cooked meat into 1 inch cubes, throwing a chunk of cheese on it, and stabing it with a toothpick. YUMMY!!

Great marinade for venison!!! I allowed one tender loin to marinate 4 hours and one overnight and the meat the next day tasted far superior to the quickly marinaded version. Forget the gas grill, charcoal grilling is perfect for this perpetration. I used dry rosemary and the smallest dash of white wine vinegar and that was perfect. I eat my venison medium rare and could detect no so called "gamey" taste.

Thanksgiving would not have been the same without this recipe for venison.  We took the deer 4 days prior to Thanksgiving with the idea of having a traditional American Thanksgiving of Venison and Turkey. My kids had never eaten venison and the thought of eating "Bambi" didn't sit well at first.  But once they tried the venison prepared by marinating from this recipe, they loved it.  In fact they asked for it the next day for lunch.  The only difference was that instead of marinating for 4 hours, I marinated for a full 24 hours.  I really think that may have made a big difference.  21 guests at Thanksgiving dinner swore it was the best venison they ever had.  In fact, in many cases, they said it was the only time they ever enjoyed venison.  Thanks for the idea.

Great Recipe.  Has anyone tried in a slow cooker or as a canning marinade?

Excellent recipe for a hot BBQ with Mauritius deer. Made several marinated vegetable kebabs with a mushroom and aubergine recipe from AR as well.

Great marinade! I am not partial to venison steak although I love dishes using ground. However, this marinade complimented the venison perfectly and took the gaminess away. Even though I always have a difficult time grilling venison (husband always says I overcook) and I did cook steaks well, again, he said they were not dry or tough.
