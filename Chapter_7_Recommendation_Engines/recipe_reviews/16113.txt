These are great!  Actually, I tried the devil's food cake mix version, added a few chocolate chips... and they make the most wonderful chocolate "mud" crispy cookies!  Am looking forward to actually trying the lemon version!

I do like this.  It's foolishly easy.  I like the texture that the crispies add, and it's nice and lemony... for most.  I need more lemon, and luckily, I felt like the dough needed a bit more liquid, so I added in about 2 tablespoons of lemon juice.  Not too much, this should be a dough, not a batter.  Very yummy.

These were great!  Fast and yummy, and no one would ever guess that they only take 5 minutes to whip up!  Amazing!
I did use two cups of Crispy Rice, as others suggested....

I had these cookies at a barbeque and had to have the recipe. When she told me there was only 4 ingredients I couldn't believe it. I came home and made them that day, we ate them all before bedtime! This is a big bang for very little effort. Great recipe!

quick, simple, and tasty. I made a few changes, simply for personal taste... I used corn flakes instead of crisp rice, for crunch. Also about 1/2 way thru cooking, i noticed they were turning out to be really fluffy soft cookies. I prefer more crunchy (crunchy, not burnt), so I gave them a little press with a spoon and a little sprinkle of raw sugar on top. turned out fantastic!

I made these for the kids for Easter.  (Turned them into "birds nests" by topping them with toasted coconut and jelly bean "eggs"). The are VERY easy to make, however, the rice crispies turn very chewy inside, and remain in your mouth long after the rest of the cookie.  I may try them again, without crispies, or with a different type of cereal.  Great taste!

If you like lemon and you like cookies and you LOVE easy - - - this is the cookie for you!  Ridiculously easy!  I thought they'd be a big flop!  Couldn't have been more wrong!  Delicious.  Crisp and lemony!  This is a keeper!

These were a great hit with my kids, who love to help me making things in the kitchen, but did find that the chewy factor was a bit off putting. Second time we tried the recipe, we replaced the rice crispies with corn flakes and the kids thought they were great!! Thank you for this simple, but yummy recipe

This was a very easy and quick cookie recipe! I thought they were pretty good too.  My son said they would be better if they were chocolate.....so I had a devils food cake mix, tried it and they were excellent! I liked better then the lemon.

I liked the simplicity of this recipe, but these weren't crisp at all. The "crisp," I gather, was supposed to come from the crisp rice cereal, but the cereal ended up getting stale-like within the moistness of the batter/dough. I increased the liquid by adding 2T of oil and experimented with baking times. A longer baking time (upwards of 15minutes) does achieve a crisp cookie, but they will become brown-ish. The piece de resistance, however, was flattening with sugar before baking and afterward drizzling lemon-almond icing: 1 cup powdered sugar, 2-3 T lemon juice, 2-3 drops almond flavoring.

I didn't have much time to bake today but I love lemon cookies. I made these for my boyfriends office mates and they ended up delicious!! The only variance I did to the recipe was adding about 2 tbsp of lemon juice and topped with coarse grained baking sugar about 3 minutes before pulling them out of the oven. Next time I will add some lemon zest as well to make the lemon even fresher tasting. Very soft and moist cookies- definitely more cake like than traditional cookies but delicious.

These cookies were easy and quick to make and had decent flavor - however it was a bit "artificial" for our tastes.  I'm sure that had more to do with the brand of cake mix that we used than this recipe.  I may try again with a different brand.

Super Easy and Very Tasty! I made 3 batches - all different - all great. 1st just recipe - wonderful. 2nd - added white chocolate chips - wonderful. 3rd - added lemon juice and a little oragne zest (didn't have lemon) - WOW Simply Fabulous! So all good - but incredible with a little more lemon flavor.

I made these when I was at home and having a major cookie craving. I typed in "cake mix" and these came up. Surprise, I had everything I needed to make them in my cupboard! 
These were so easy and actually pretty yummy! It is a great recipe if you have little kids who would like to help you bake. I added two cups of rice crispies as others suggested and everyone seemed to like the texture. 
To me, they do taste a bit too much like cake mix, but that is not a problem for most people who are not really into baking. The kids loved them. I think chocolate would be pretty yummy!

The flavor of the lemon was good. The Rice Krispies were not. They tasted very chewy almost stale. I will not make these again.

These were so easy and very good - I would have liked to reduce the sugar a little, but since it's in the cake mix, it makes it a little difficult.

After placing them on a parchment lined cookie sheet I flattened them slightly with the bottom of a glass rubbed with butter and dipped in sugar.  Baked 10 minutes.  When cooled I iced them with icing sugar and lemon juice, sprinkled lemon zest on top.

This is an exact duplicate of a recipe called Lemon Crisps.  It is easy and fast to make up, tastes great, can be modified as you like, and ships well.    Our younger boy is in the Navy; these cookies endure shipping and are a big hit upon arrival!    I would say the texture of the finish cookie is more chewy than crispy but no one complains at our house.   :-)

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed these.  They work up quick and have great flavour.  Like another reviewer, I did notice that the crispies were very chewy, but I didn't find it took away from the cookie.  Great recipe!

this did not turn out like "crisp" little lemon cookies.  It is more like round cakey type with little chewy bits (rice crisps).  Flavour not too bad just not what I was expecting ... not like the picture at all.

I can't imagine how a cookie could be easier to make with kids, OR turn out so incredibly delicious.  I mean flippin GOOD.  The rice krispies deliver the perfect texture when you bite into them.

Suggest adding a tablespoon of water.  As directed they didn't quite spread out like the picture.  But still.  awesome.

Very good cookie.  Easy to make with children.  We really liked the texture of rice cereal in this. I will try this with a chocolate cake mix as well.

This cookie is a hit at family get-togethers.  I tried it with Devils Food cake mix and added some chocolate chips and peanut butter chips.  Everyone loved these cookies.

thankyou for sharing this recipe! one review mentioned only wanting to cook from scratch. many of us have those same values but we understood from reading the recipe that it's all about being quick and easy, which is great when time is crucial. i added more lemon and sprinkled with sugar. GOOD! have also added a bit of wheat germ.

Sorry but not very good.  These tasted like dry cake mix.  Maybe some lemon zest would help the flavor?  And the crispies got kind of chewy.  Someone would probably chew and chew and wonder what exactly was in them.  Had to throw them away.

Followed recipe exactly.   Excellent.  Amazed me.  Love to do with little kids helping.   No mixer needed.    Must make again.   Although I have not tried it, I am sure this can work with other flavors of cake mix.

VERYVERY good!! I have used puffed rice and puffed millet and still tastes good my dad likes it best when i use puffed millet and my bro likes it best when i used the puffed rice.  When you don't have lemon cake mix you can use devils or white or yellow and just add lemon extract OR use homemade lemon cake mix.  Great for summer!!!

These are so simply to make and turned out quite delicious!!! I will definitely do them again. The only thing that I changed was that I used Parkay margarine instead of butter and they turned out just as good. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

These are tough and I had to roll them in powdered sugar to get a little flavor.  I am not a fan of using any mix in a cookie recipe, but this recipe appears a lot on the internet, so thought I'd give it a try.  Will not be using it again.  I prefer all from scratch recipes and will keep looking.

I do not bake or eat sweets but needed something yellow and lemon flavored and these were SO simple. Even though I do no like sweets, I did try one and I actually liked the chewy texture the cereal gave these. It doesn't get any easier than this!

Surprisingly Delicious! Didn't make any changes! Very easy to make! Will definitely make again! Loved the lemon, but may try with dark chocolate or red velvet cake mix next time, just to change it up.

I had a different kind of cerea l(crumbs from bottom of a Special K with strawberries) but other than that followed recipe. They are good & leave room for adjusting to taste. I will add a few chopped walnuts next time. Might try chocolate cake with different add ins. Definitely 5 Stars for  quick & ease of making.  After lunch everyone was wanting a treat, these came together FAST. Thank you for sharing

Small and flavor packed.  I added fresh grated lemon zest.  It almost crystallized with the sugar in the recipe and gave it a wonderful lemon crunch.

Didn't have lemon cake mix, used white cake mix with lemon zest and fresh lemon juice.  Great natural lemony flavor with fun crunch with rice cereal.  Very easy to make.

These cookies were excellent! Although the dough at first was a little dry I added 1 to 2 tablespoons of  water to moisten it. if you like really lemony stuff you can substitute that with lemon juice instead. Overall these cookies were great and my whole family enjoyed them. :]

It was easy, true. And I know the times they are a changing, but I was raised on homemade and do homemade myself. I love cakes made with cake mixes, but this cookie tasted like--well--eating a cake mix. Ok, but not great. I don't think I'll make them again. Also it was a bit of a pain to mix and mold the cookies because they were so dry. For a little more effort you could have a really great homemadelemon cookie.

great little cookie. I made it with cornflakes after reading the reviews but it was still chewy. I didn't mind though, I like chewy cookies. :o)

I loved how easy these were! Very Kid friendly. I'm looking forward to trying these again with different cake flavours. Next time though, I'm going to try less butter (a little too rich for my taste).

Good flavor and very easy recipe.  I was able to have my whole crew of kids help with this, but my family did not like the texture of the crisp rice cereal.  Will try next time with out them!

This would be something very simple to teach your children, but the texture overall is not good. I agree with other reviews and will try corn flakes next time.

Just made this for the family and they were wonderful! Even the 2-year old ate them without flinching. :)
