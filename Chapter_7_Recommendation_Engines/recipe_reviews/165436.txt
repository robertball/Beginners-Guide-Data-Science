Strange to rate my own recipe, but I just wanted to add that many different things can be added to make this recipe your own. Chipotles, mexican oregano, cumin, pumpkin seeds and raisins are all great additions and generally every cook has their own version, my recipe is just a starting point to create your own masterpiece!

Ty, your mole with four chiles is great!  Not too many girls like to cook wholesome-more-than-three-ingredients recipes like this one.  I am all about cooking authentic Mexican food from scratch, and I am also proud of making my own corn and flour tortillas!

This is a great recipe, a little sweet and spicy at the same time! The only change I made was I added two extra tortillas, also I used the chicken broth left after boiling my chicken thighs & legs, instead of water. I will be making this again.  I served it with rice and onions marinated in lime and cilantro.

i love this recipe. it is the closest i've seen to real traditional, mole the author is  right there are many variations, for example i used pumkin seeds instead of the almonds, and add cloves and peppercorns when pureing the ingredients. it is also a good idea to brown the chicken before adding the sauce.

My husband and father in law love chicken mole, so of course I logged onto allrecipes to find me a recipe.  This was very very good!  A couple of things to note   1) I cooked the chicken in a dutch oven (filled with water) and used the broth from the chicken to thin the mole paste while blending.  2)  I added 1/2 tsp of cloves and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the onions and garlic.  I mixed the mole sauce and the chicken together at the end, and simmered for 20 minutes.  My sauce came out really thick---just how my family likes it----but the pieces of chicken didn't hold together well.  Next time I will remove the chicken from the dutch oven after it is cooked, set aside, and cook the  mole sauce in the remaining broth.  Will probably serve by pouring the sauce over the piece of chicken.  Will definitely cook again, and probably play with the spices a little more, maybe add more toasted cloves.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is fantastic.  I added about 2 Tbsp sugar and a dash of cinnamon though, and it turned out to be very delicious.  Thank you!

I just made this for a Day of the Dead celebration and it was a HUGE hit!!! The taste is subtle and so good. The biggest comment was that it was not overpowered by chocolate as some moles are. I personally love alot of chocolate in my mole but this was a delicious varition!!

it had the right tastes and colors... it just wasn't at all spicy... maybe next time i need to leave some of the seeds in it to make it a little spicy.... also make sure you use a plantain that's already ripe!!!

This was wonderful... Gives competition to my Grandmas mole... Actually... I like this one better. I don't know why there are bad reviews. It is not overly sweet. The recipe as seen above doesn't call for salt but that is an obvious to bring out the flavors of the sauce.

I've made this at least 10 times, and it's my favorite mole sauce. 
I have substituted pine nuts for the peanuts and almonds, and also ghirardelli chocolate or pure Coco powder for the Coco the recipe calls for a great tasting mole.

Before this, I had never attempted mole but had it at a really good Mexican restaurant. Word of warning, for those unfamiliar (as I was), I smoked two blenders trying to put this together. The recipe doesn't emphasize that you WILL need to add a substantial amount of water/broth. It doesn't seem as thick as it actually is, so make sure to add plenty of liquid. If you end up adding too much, you can always take the cover off and cook the liquid off at the end. Also, it improved greatly after cooking it with the chicken. I was really worried at first when I had just made the sauce and tried some, it was weird and bitter but once it got several hours (crock pot) with the chicken in there it lost most of the bitterness and came together.

Delicious!  I added about half a box of chicken stock during the blending process, used chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken and used a pressure cooker to cut down on time.  It turned out great - thank you!
