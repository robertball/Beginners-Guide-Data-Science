Wow, I can't believe I made such good rolls.
I don't have a breadmaker, so here's what I did:

I mixed the water and milk, nuked in in the microwave for 1 minute and 15 seconds, poured it into the bowl of my KitchenAid mixer, then stirred in the sugar until it dissolved, then stirred in the yeast. I use yeast from a jar instead of packets, and I used 2.5 teaspoons. After it got foamy (I only waited about 10 minutes...I'm impatient) I mixed in the salt, butter and egg, then I started mixing the flour a half cup at a time.  I let it rise for about 45 minutes in the bowl, then punched it down, divided it into 16 balls (I didn't feel like making crescents) and let it rise for another hour, then baked for 10 minutes. They turned out like something from a bakery. I have never, ever baked bread this wonderful. I am so bummed that I am home alone right now and nobody can see what a wonderful thing I just did!
I also want to add, pay attention to the temperature of your oven...My oven tends to be extremely hot, so I only set it for 350 to bake these...they turned out perfect. I know 400 degrees would have blackened them.

So yummy!  I don't have a breadmaker, so I made these the traditional way (dissolve yeast and 1 tbsp sugar in warm water, let sit for about 10 min.  Meanwhile, warm milk in saucepan until it just bubbles.  Remove from heat, stir in sugar and butter until melted and cool to lukewarm.  In a large bowl combine yeast mixture, milk mixture and egg.  Stir in flour a little at a time and knead on lightly floured surface about 8 min.)  Cover and let rise about 1 hr...punch down and then roll out.  I baked at 375 for 12 min, but could have used a tad longer.  Still very good.

There are never any rolls left when I make these for a dinner.  After the dough raises, I divide the dough into 27 pieces and form into balls.  I place 9 balls in a greased 9" pie pan, this gives me 3 pans of rolls.  I let them raise for 30 minutes, then bake in the oven until lightly brown.  I freeze the rolls in aluminum foil.  When I need dinner rolls, I thaw the rolls, leave them wrapped in the foil and warm in the oven at 350 degrees for 5-10 minutes.  Delicious!

Excellent rolls! I made these into cinnamon rolls and they turned out great! I don't own a bread machine and for those who don't either here are the directions to use: pour water & milk into bowl, add sugar, stir to disolve, add yeast, allow to proof for about 20 minutes until creamy foam appears, add butter, salt, mix, add slightly beaten egg and flour cup by cup stirring mixture. Allow to rise for 45mins in a warm area, covered with clean dish towel. Turn out and continue with step 2. These are very light, tasty rolls!!

My absolute favorite bread recipe. I'm always asked to bring the rolls to get-togethers. I've used it for cinnamon rolls, monkey bread...almost everything. I do cheat, however; normally I cut the dough into 36 pieces and place 3 into each cup of a muffin tin. It makes big, light clover leaf rolls that everyone raves over.

These rolls are so yummy.I don't have a bread maker so I make it the old fashioned way and it still turns out perfect everytime. Mix the warm water, warm milk and yeast first. Let it stand for about 10 minutes for the yeast to proof. Then add the remaining ingredients. Let it rise until doubled in size (about 1hr.) Then follow the rest of the recipe. My husband and boys arm wrestle for the last one. This recipe is also wonderful for cinnamon rolls. Happy Baking!

GREAT!!! 5++++ What more can I say.  I have used this recipe many times and always turns out GREAT!! If I am in a hurry I take dough out of bread machine and cut in 12 equal pieces. Roll dough into balls in my hand and then put them in my glass 9x13 pan and let them raise for 1 hour. Bake for 12 mins at 350....  These rolls are also good when made ahead of time and froze until ready to use. just pop in oven and warm up! Sooo Gooooood!!

The dough was too sticky in the machine, so I sprinkled flour into it until it was smooth.  I was concerned about not using bread machine flour or bread machine yeast.  I used the all purpose flour as it called for, but I used the bread machine yeast...it was all I had. I used 2 1/2 tsp of bread machine yeast. They rose just fine and taste great.  I will use this recipe to replace my old bread machine roll recipe.  As did another reviewer, I cut my dough into 36 pieces and placed three balls of dough into each muffin cup.  They turned into beautiful clover rolls.  Nice touch.  Also, I use a pizza cutter to cut my dough.

Amazingly wonderful. Just made them this morning. It was so easy using my bread machine on dough cycle; then pulled the dough out and rolled out flat for cinnamon rolls. Added fresh orange peel and 2 Tb fresh orange juice to butter, spread it on the rectangle of dough; packed on lots of brown sugar and cinnamon. Rolled and cut into cinn. rolls. Baked in 9x13 pan, 20mins at 200 degrees, then 20+/- mins at 350 degrees. Might want to put foil loosely over top so they don't get too brown or dried out. Wonderful new tradition for Thanksgiving morning!!!!!

SUPERB. I made cloverleaf rolls and baked for 12 min. exactly.  Soft, moist, tender and flavorful.  I used rapid-rise yeast (which only requires one rise) and had these on the table within 2 hours.  No changes needed - amazing!  TIP - I make this by hand using Rapid Rise yeast (aka Bread Machine yeast). I warm the water to 110-120 degrees and add to the yeast and sugar in my KitchenAid mixer. Let stand for 10 minutes until foamy (same for any type yeast). Then I add the warm milk, melted butter, salt & egg and mix well with paddle attachment.  I then add the flour one cup at a time. When dough comes together, switch to dough hook and knead for 5 minutes (6-7 min. if doing it by hand). I cover the dough and let sit in my bowl to rest for 10 min. then I shape into rolls and let rise for 1 hour.

these are the best rolls I have ever made. The first time I made them, I followed instructions and used all purpose flour. They were tasty but a little dense and not flakey. The way I make them now, they turn out so airy, flakey and buttery - almost like a croissant.

What I do: I heat the milk and water in a small bowl, then add yeast and 1 TBS of sugar (from the 1/3 cup - I even add a bit less than 1/3 in total as it was too sweet the first time - about 1/3 minus 2 TBS) and let rise and get foamy. In my KA Mixer I beat the butter and sugar, add egg and salt and beat, then add my yeasty liquid and slowly incorporate BREAD flour - it makes a huge difference. 

I knead the dough in the machine for 5 minutes then let it rest for 15. The dough starts out sticky but after 5 minutes of machine kneading it is perfect and you do not even need any flour to roll it out.

Next I use a pizza slicer and cut the dough in half, roll out each half into a circle, add the butter on top and use the cutter to cut each circle into 8 pices as the recipe states. I pull as I roll so that I can can get more layers into each roll. I let it rise in a warm area for 2-3 hours or until it has really risen (more than doubled). 1 hour did not work for me it needed more to become airy and light.

I brushed a bit more butter on them when they came out of the oven. These are so sinful but really the most amazing roll recipe ever.

Just what I was looking for, great roll.  And incase anyone else needs to know, 1 packet of yeast is 1 1/2 tsp if you buy it in a jar.

I used my Kitchen Aid to make these rolls. I proofed the yeast in the mixer bowl with the sugar and warm milk/water for ten minutes, then I added the egg, butter, then the dry ingredients. I kneaded this dough with my dough hook for about five minutes (I did have to add more flour to get it into a ball and be able to be kneaded with the hook). I set it to rise for an hour in a large greased bowl covered with a tea towel on a warm heating pad for an hour. I followed with the recipe, letting it the rolls rise on the warm heating pad for another 45 minutes or so. I baked them at 400 degrees for 12 minutes. Very, very yummy. BAKERY quality. Who would have thunk I'd be able to make crescent rolls? It'll be hard for me to justify buying refrigerated rolls again after making these beauties on my own--this recipe's a winner! NOTE: For those of you who are nervous about making these into crescents, you can just use your 1/4 measuring cup to make equal sized balls, roll into a smooth ball, and plop them into greased muffin pans and drizzle the melted butter equally over each roll. Easy peasy!

I've been making this recipe for a couple of months now. It makes fabulous dinner rolls. The dough is perfect and extrememly easy to work with. The other night I tried making cinnamon rolls with it. They are the BEST!!! Here's what you do.  Roll dough out to a rectangle, oh about this big, Paint the rectangle with butter. Sprinkle with a mixture of 1 Cup brown sugar and 5 Teaspoons of cinnamon.  Roll up starting with the long side. Cut into 12 slices. Place into a buttered 9x13 cake pan and let rise for about an hour. Bake at 375 for 15 minutes. You dont NEED a glaze. Thanks for the wonderful recipe Donna !!! You are the Bomb !!!

Wow!  I have tossed all of my other bread, roll, and cinnamon roll recipes out.  THIS IS IT!  The first time through, I used half of the dough to make dinner rolls and the other half for cinnamon rolls.  I baked both at 375 for 12-15 minutes.  Both got rave reviews.  
On a perpetual hunt for the perfect sandwich bread, I next made this into a loaf.  Holy cow!  This dough makes the best tasting sandwich bread.  The mild flavor doesn't compete with anything you'd care to make a sandwich out of.  The texture and crumb are far above and beyond any other white bread I've tried, and trust me, I've tried a bunch!  Most other white bread recipes do not hold together once sliced and used for sandwiches.  But the texture of this bread is perfect!  The slices do not fall apart.  Just amazing!  
To make a loaf, after the dough cycle has completed in the bread machine, lightly grease a loaf pan, remove dough from machine and knead a few times to remove big air bubbles, form into a log, place in loaf pan and let rise for an hour.  Bake at 375 for 20-25 minutes.  It has a naturally crunchy crust, but to soften it, just rub a little butter on the entire top surface when it comes out of the oven.  This recipe yields a large loaf in a 9x5 loaf pan, but could be split in half to make two loaves.  Simply superb!

These were good, but I guess I was expecting something mindblowing after reading all the fantastic reviews. I didn´t make them in the breadmaker though, I just followed some suggestions on making them by hand. I would have liked them more if they were softer and they tasted a bit too yeasty. Not bad though.

I have already made these about 6 or 7 times and they are WONDERFUL!  My last couple of batches I rolled a slice of Pepper Jack cheese in the center and also on another batch I mixed cream cheese, garlic and minced onion and added that to the center before rolling.  I gave some to 2 different neighbors and they want ot know when I will make more.  I will definitely be making this recipe many more times.

I've never written a review before, but I couldn't pass up a chance to say thank you for this recipe.  I've been looking for a recipe like this for at least four years.  My husband has had to eat a lot of failures so he thanks you too!  Theses rolls turn out perfect every time.  Once I added and extra egg yolk and they turned out richer, but it really isn't necessary.  I'll never try another recipe( It can't get better than this or I will die eating it!!)  I'll make these for Thanksgiving because my whole family loves them.  My nephew eats six or seven at a time.  Many thanks for your thoughtfullness and sharing.

Excellent rolls!  A hint from me - the dough might be easier to roll if you let it rest for ten minutes after you divide it in two.

Donna, thank you SO much for this fantastic recipe!  I've been using it for years and have never been disappointed.  I take these to every family function -- I'd be beaten, disowned and disinherited if I didn't! ;-)  Everyone who has tried them says they're the best rolls they've ever tasted.  The only changes I make are using bread flour instead of AP flour and reducing the sugar to 2 TBS (husband doesn't care for sweet tasting bread).  I used margarine once when I was out of butter and, to my surprise, it seemed to actually work better for this recipe, so I've stuck with margarine since then.  While this makes great regular dinner rolls, you're really missing out if you don't make them into crescent rolls as directed -- we love the velvety-soft texture and the light, fluffy, buttery layers.  The dough is a dream to work with.  If you have trouble with it springing back as you roll it, just let it rest for 10 mins or so and try again.  I always put the rolls on 2 large, parchment-lined cookie sheets to rise and bake (makes for evenly and lightly browned bottoms and no pan to wash afterward).  Also, I spray one side of some Glad wrap with a little Pam and put it over the rolls, then cover with a dish towel and put into a barely warm oven to rise.  Very lightly brush with melted butter when done, pile into a big towel-lined basket, and watch them disappear!  I've tried so many bread recipes and, without question, this is my favorite for rolls...truly worthy of 5 stars!

I tried these rolls just like the recipe called for and then I just rolled them into balls and baked them and they were a hit both ways.  Rolling them out took a little longer but the taste was just as good when I rolled them into balls and brushed them with butter.  I made them for or family of 35 for Thanksgiving and then was asked to do them for Christmas because they were so good.  There were none left either time.

Love it!  Makes my mouth water.  We made as directed but now simply chunk the dough into 16 pieces, THROW them on a jelly roll pan and bake!  Couldn't be easier!  My family's favorite!

Yes, Yes, Yes!  I cannot rave enough about this dough.  I have been experimenting with my bread machine for over a year now and have not found any recipe that comes close to this one.  I like fast and easy baking, and these rolls came out great made with just a simple knot shape.  Then, I spread a little butter on top and baked.  I served them to a bunch of critics and they all raved.  A KEEPER!

I make homemade bread 2-3 times per week for our family of 5.  This is their favorite.  I love them because it's pretty easy in the bread machine, and the presentation is lovely.  They love them for the flavor!!

These rolls taste amazing.  The first time I made them they were good but were really dense (obviously my fault) but the taste was delicious so I made them again.  The second time they were perfect.  One thing with rolls or any other bread is the amount of flour you use can really change from time to time.  I have a kitchen aid and I only add flour until the dough no longer sticks to the side.  I have seen that some people proof the yeast but there is no need to do this.  On my kitchen aid I just mixed the warm water and warm milk and added the yeast and mixed with a wire whisk.  I used the whisk until about a third of the flour was added.  I then switched to the bread hook and after every thing was added I let it knead for 5-7 minutes.  I then let it rise for an hour, knocked in down, and put my rolls into a 13 x 9 and put melted butter on the top and let them rise an hour more.  Cook at 375 for about 15 minutes.  Just watch until the tops are nice and golden.  I wish I had one to eat right now while I am writing this!!!

i did not have a bread machine so i followed the others and used my kitchenaid mixer. i proofed the yeast in the 1/2 cup warm water and 1 tablespoon sugar and let it set for 10 minutes until frothy. while i was waiting on that i warmed the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbled then i removed it from heat and added the sugar and butter and i stired until melted. after the yeast mixture proofed for 10 mins i added the milk mixture and the egg and stired until combined. i sifted the flour and added the salt. i mixed the dry mixture into the wet a cup at a time until i had the desired consistency. i mixed it in my mixer with the dough hook for 7 mins. then i turned it out onto a well oiled not floured surface and shaped it in to a ball and put it in a bowl sprayed with pam. i let it rise for 45 mins. then i punched it down and kneaded it 3 or 4 times. then i shaped the dough into equal size balls and placed them about an inch apart on a greased pan. i baked them at 375 for 14 mins. my family really enjoyed them. they were very tender and flaky. i hope this helps someone. good luck

Good recipe but I think delicate to bake. Must be stove temperature differences. Check bottom of rolls toward end of baking, browns easily. May be due to butter. Had to finish browning by broiler so bottoms wouldn't burn. Worth the effort though ...big hit.

Let me tell you why this is a life changing bread recipe.  1. The bread machine does all the hard work for you on the dough cycle. 2. Once the dough cycle is done, divide the dough in half. You’ll have enough for 8 dinner rolls in one half.  3. Roll the other half of dough out into a rectangle, spread on some butter and fill with cinnamon, brown sugar and pecans. Roll up and cut into 8 cinnamon rolls. Refrigerate overnight and take out an hour before they bake (350 degrees for 30 minutes) the next morning, so they can come to room temperature. Cover in cream cheese icing (2.5 oz cream cheese, 3 tbs. milk, 1.5 cups powdered sugar). Eat.

I received a bread machine for Christmas from some friends and had been looking for a recipe for dinner rolls. I had tried a couple of others but this is the best.  I made some for the ladies that gave me the machine and they also loved them.
Very easy even for a beginner. Thanks Donna

These rolls were super easy. The made a wonderful crust and soft interior. They were easy to shape and looked lovely when baked. My negative comment is only that they seemed a bit bland - and not at all sweet as the name suggests. I can't see using this dough for sticky buns and I would fiddle with the recipe to get more flavor if I made them again as dinner rolls.

I was tired of always having to go to the store to buy frozen dinner rolls in an aluminum pan.  The rising time took too long because the rolls were frozen.  This recipe tastes just like most restaurant rolls and takes half the time than frozen rolls bought at the grocery store.

These rolls taste pretty good however, once rolled out and formed, they did'nt rise very much at all during the hour as the recipe calls for. I baked them at 400 as indicated but the bottoms burned and the inside was not done. Perhaps it was just my oven.

Oh My God! I got a bread maker last year & have tried recipes here & there, but seemed to always end up disappointed. I decided to renew my hunt for a good recipe & I am so glad that I happened upon this one! Soooo Yummy! 

I made the recipe "as written" in my bread machine on the dough cycle, but instead of making crescent shapes, I lightly pressed each piece into a small round circle. I spread softened butter on the circle leaving a 1/4 inch bare on the edge farthest away from me. I then rolled my side in to the circle, and gathering in the sides as well, rolling till I got to the dry end where I pinched it together to seal, between my index finter & thumb to create a smooth ball, which I placed sealed side down into a buttered 13"x9" glass baking pan. They rose up nicely, filling up the pan  & were tall dinner rolls. They baked up really fast, & were so light & fluffy & nicely sweet. I also used Rapid Rise yeast. My family all loved them very much, & fought over the last roll. I made 2 batches & they were just as yummy the next day for breakfast. I didn't even need to warm them. I also tried making cinnamon rolls out of the dough, filling with butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, walnuts & raisins. Finished with a vanilla powdered sugar glaze.Oooey gooey yumminess!  

Today, I tried to make the recipe again using bread flour, as a few others suggested. It didn't rise very much, compared to my other 2 batches of dough. Yes... my yeast was fresh with an expiration date of 2009. Th

These rolls are so good!
I am only in high school(so not much years of cooking/baking), and this was my first time to bake rolls. they turned out perfect, and they are so good. 
I do have a bread machine but I decided to make it the "normal" way. I got help from some people's review by heating milk and water and dissolving sugar first and then dissolving the yeast. I let it proof(let it sit) for 20 mins(it foamed on top). I then mixed in rest of the ingredients and since I don't have a food mixer I justed kneaded it by hand. I got a tip from food channel (Good Eats by Alton Brown)about putting your dough in a long container and mark where your dough is so you can tell easily if your dough has double its size. I also got a tip about putting a pan of boiling water, the steam from the water will keep the oven warm and the moisturizer won't make your dough dry. I also baked my rolls at 350, but for around 12 minutes.

Yummy!  Very soft and light.  I never follow the manufactures settings, and it seems to work for me.  Added sugar, water, milk, and yeast.  Allowed to proof for 10 minutes.  Then melted butter, egg, flour and salt.  Rolled into balls and place with sides touching on cookie sheet.  AND USE BREAD FLOUR!  (Yes! I'm shouting!)  It will make a world of difference in the texture.  Updated - Yesterday made this into a loaf.  Best sandwich bread ever!  My husband said to throw the old recipe out.  Baked at 350 for 30 minutes for that.

PERFECT! Easy! I made these for Christmas Eve dinner, and immediately was asked to make them for my bro-in-law's rehearsal dinner. I will never buy the frozen rolls again! These are quicker and barely more work.

yummy and sweet.came out more like biscuits(good biscuits though!!).i didint use a bread machine cause i dont have one so i was burning my hands too much.it was worth it but the trick to make them shiny is add egg wash on top.will do that next time.(2ND REVIEW)i made them today and i actually did brush egg wash after they took an hour to rise.it did come out with a real good and smooth shine but i needed to add more egg wash for even better.came out spectacular!and the reason why my rolls came out like biscuits last time was probably cause i didint let them rise enough time in a warm place.i just put them in the oven with no heat.today though i preheated the oven to 350 degrees and at about 1/2 way i turned off the oven and stuck the dough in there with a wet towel and enough warmth. i think they are exactly like the golden corral and ryans rolls just a a little more sugar should be added.it will go great with the honey butter recipes from here!great recipe! :)

These rolls are delicious!  I did not use a bread machine.  Instead I combined and warmed the milk and water. I then added the yeast. This set for approx 15 minutes. In the meantime, I then mixed the sugar, butter, flour and salt in my Kitchenaid mixer with the dough hook.  I then added the yeast mixture and mixed for approx three minutes.  The dough was covered and the dough was allowed to rise for 45 minutes.  After 45 minutes I rolled out the dough and created crescent rolls.  The rolls rised for another hour then they were baked.

Awesome.  I don't have a bread machine so I heated the water and milk in the microwave for one minute on high, put the yeast in for 10-15 minutes until the mixture started to foam on top.  I then mixed all the ingredients together and knead the dough until smooth and let it stand in room temp. for 1 hr.  Punch the dough and knead for a minute and rolled them into 14-16 balls and let it rise for 1 hr and baked them in the oven for 15 minutes at 400 degree.  I ended up making three batches for dinner party of 12 people because every time I pull a tray out of the oven, they were gone.  I messed up my first batch up by adding the rest of the butter last because I decided make simple rolls and still it came out very fluffy.  I think that was my best batch.

thanks so much for this recipe.  Talk about versitile.  I have made 2 batches of this today.  I was looking for a doughnut recipe and couldn't find one so I used this.  I have a 2 lb size bread maker so I doubled it.  I did have to help by stirring a bit.  When it reached the top of the bread maker, I turned the dough into a large greased bowl to finish rising.  I then rolled out the dough, cut with a glass,  made holes with the lid from a karo syrup bottle and let them rise for about 45 minutes.  I fried them for about 2 minutes each side in  a skillet, let them cool slightly and then shook them in a bag with cinnamon sugar.  They are wonderful  I second batch I made into rolls for dinner.  Will use this recipe again and again.  A keeper for us.

I am a bread connoisseur and all I can say about these is YUMMY!!!!  They are so good!!  They were really easy to make using my bread machine.  I'm thinking of using this recipe to make cinnamon rolls Christmas morning.  An excellent dinner roll...so much better than Pillsbury!!!!

Best Dinner Rolls I EVER made! The last recipe I made came out like rocks from another popular website that suggested I did not have to let the bread rise. WRONG! The key here is letting the dough rise twice!I dont have a bread machine so here is what I did: Before allowing the dough to rise, I put a bit of coconut oil (1 tsp) in a bowl and rolled the dough around in the oil.  I then set the oven for 170 (That is the lowest it goes) I took a damp kitchen towel and placed it over the bowl--to cover the dough. I then turned the oven off and placed a pyrex dish under the bowl (to prevent my bowl from melting) and placed it in the oven the first time for 45 min the first time. As a suggestion of another reviewer, I punched the dough a bit (No need to knead the dough) then let it rise again for another hour. This is the key to having the rolls to be light and fluffy. If you skip the rising part, this WILL NOT yield the same results. You wil end up wth bread rocks! They will be dense and gross in the middle. I know cause I tried it. I made these rolls, pulled them out of the oven and my family devoured them and asked me when I am making it again! Thanks for posting such an awesome recipe Donna! OOh! The recipe also called for 1/4 of a cup of butter. To save on calories,  omitted this toplace on bthe top of the rolls and they still came out great. I will try to ake money bread out of these rolls or cinnamon rolls. Also reduced the amount of sugar by 2tb and it still came out great!

I've finally found the dinner roll recipe I've been looking for.  I wanted a light, fluffy and slightly sweet roll- the kind you get at a steakhouse.  This is it!  I tend not to make any changes to a recipe the first time I make it, however I did lower the oven temp to 350 and they turned out great.  Also, the humidity here has been high, so when I needed to add more flour I used cake flour, so that the rolls wouldn't be too dense.  I made these with my Kitchen Aid mixer (proofing the yeast, etc) and after shaping them into crescents I then froze them.  (I like fresh baked, to me baking then freezing isn't the same.)  I wasn't going to bake any for a few days but my curiosity got the best of me and I baked *one* tonight.  I am very impressed with how it tasted, even after freezing.  This will make Thanksgiving and Christmas much easier.

BEWARE OF THIS RECIPE!

This recipe is just way too good!!!!!  After you make it once--you will want to make it again and again, leading to many added pounds.  You will probably want to try just making it in round rolls for hamburger buns that are to die for.  Or, even just split the dough in half and bake it on cookie sheets and then make the most awesome garlic bread. Of course the cinnimon rolls that you can also make from this recipe are to be avoided as well because of their fat inducing qualities.  So to sum up this recipe--all Atkin dieters -RUN, RUN, RUN  from this recipe before it is too late.  Mmmm--this is a keeper!

Great recipe!  I don't have a breadmaker, so I used my Kitchenaid mixer with the dough hook.  I let the yeast bloom in the warm water and milk, then added it to everything else.  Once combined, I let the mixer knead it for 10 minutes.  Half of it I made into cresents (I did not spread on the extra butter), and the other half into round dinner rolls.  Very tender texture, and fabulous flavor--a little sweet, but not overwhelming.  This recipe is a definite keeper.

These were great.  I used a mixer instead of a bread maker.  I doubled the recipe, and I used muffin tins instead of rolling them into crescents.  After the first rise I punched the dough down and divided it into 32 dough balls.  I put some in muffin tins to rise and followed the recipe after that.  I froze the extra dough balls individually then put them all in a Ziploc together.  Now I just get out as many as I want and put them in the muffin pan in the afternoon and they are ready to bake that night.  The dough froze beautifully, and they taste fresh every time I make them.

I made these into delicious rolls in advance of a Thanksgiving dinner party for a crowd.  Instead of baking through, I pulled the rolls from the oven just before they turned golden but after they were fully puffed up.  I then cooled, packed them in ziplocs, and froze them.  On the big day, I pulled them from the freezer to defrost in the morning and then finished baking them until they were golden on the outside just before serving the meal.  Saved me loads of stress & oven time, and they still turned out delicious!  Just cut back slightly on the sugar if you want more of a dinner roll.  Yum!

I've made this 3 times in the last two weeks!  They are delicious and easy to make!  I use my mixer with the dough hook and mix it on low until it combines then turn it up to med/low for 7-10 min. I let it rise covered in the microwave for 45 min. with a cup of hot water then I divide the dough to make 12 balls and place in buttered 13 x 9" pan. I reheat the cup of water in microwave. Cover rolls with plastic and place in microwave for 1 hr. Bake at 350 for 12-15 min. until golden. It make 12 large rolls but if making for guests maybe making 24 would be better. This is a must try recipe!

I tried this recipe day before yesterday for the first time, then yesterday for the second time and fixing to try it again for the third time today.  This is an awesome recipe!!  I do it in the food processor (I have a kneading blade that doesn't have sharp edges, and therefore doesn't cut the dough- it merely lets it stretch and break, just like hand-kneading).  I thought 1/3 cup sugar was a bit much but I liked the sweetness (I almost never alter a recipe on the first try- to give it a fair chance) so when I made the second batch yesterday, I started with just 2 teaspoons of real sugar (to feed the yeast) then added 1/3 cup Splenda.  I also tried it with a cup of whole wheat flour, then whatever amount of all-purpose flour I needed to make a dough (I don't measure flour when I'm making bread- too many variables- I do it by feel).  I took a plate of warm rolls to the neighbors and they liked them too.  I like the way the crescent rolls look- may have to try those but add butter, sugar and cinnamon to my dough circles before cutting into wedges and rolling up- that sounds good!  OR spread with garlic butter before rolling crescents!  I made (12) cloverleaf rolls the first time, then (16) medium-sized oval "pillows" with the 2nd batch.  OH MY- am I ever happy that you posted this!  I think I will re-visit this recipe over and over and over again.  BTW, I have been using this site for YEARS, and finally registered this AM just so I could comment on this wonderful recipe. ?

My entire family LOVES this recipe.  I always make a double batch because they don't last long!  I don't use a bread machine so I microwave the milk and water for 1 min 10 secs.  While that is heating up I add the sugar and yeast (2.5 teaspoons) to my kitchenaid.  Then add the milk/water mixture and let sit for 15 mins.  After that add butter, egg and mix until blended.  Add remaining ingredients and mix until it doesn't stick to the bowl.  Let sit in bowl for 1 hour covered for first rise.  Kneed down and cut off dough to make desired shapes.  Cover and let rise for 1 hr.  Bake at 400 for 10-12 mins.
This also makes a great dough for sticky buns!
Enjoy :-)

Amazing!  They taste just like I remember my great-grandma's rolls!  She passed away when I was around 16 or 17, about 12 years ago.  I didn't roll them up.  Instead I just made half the dough into 8 balls and pinched the bottom.  I saved half of the dough for later so I can make a small batch of cinnamon rolls!  (it's just me, hubby, and a 2 year old!).

THE BEST THING TO DO WITH THESE RIGHT BEFORE YOU PUT IT IN THE OVEN IS TO MIX 2TBL MELTED BUTTER with 1.5TBL CONFECTIONER SUGAR THEN LIBERALLY SPREAD OVER TOP OF ROLLS. trust me, it's devine! The butter melts into the bread and the sugar makes a flaky, sweet layer. Best thing ever!

I have made this recipe several times now and each time it always comes out perfect.  I do not use a bread machine though.  Instead I just mix the yeast, warm liquids and sugar.  Let it sit for 15 minutes...add the rest of the ing and let rise.  I bake them at 350 rather than 400 just until done.  I get compliments every time.  They look like they take a lot of time but are super easy.

This is an excellent yeast bread. I have used it for dinner rolls and cinnamon rolls and am very pleased with the results. I do not use the bread machine, instead dissolve the yeast in the warm water, then add the milk, sugar, butter, egg, salt and flour in that order and let it rise 1 1/2 hours before punching down and rolling out. It's really delicious with an excellent fragrance and I recommend it highly.

As dinner rolls, these were melt in your mouth delicious.  I made them for Thanksgiving and Christmas and everyone loved them; they were very easy to make and came out tender and delicious.  I recently used the dough recipe to make cinnamon rolls and they were excellent; the BEST homemade ones I've made/tried.  My husband said I should open up shop and sell them!  He said they were almost as good as Cinnabon!  (Next time I make them I will buy and use Cinnabon's special cinnamon!)  Thanks for posting this wonderful recipe that is now one of my favorites!

I have made this recipe in my bread machine and it's terrific!  I love the fact that I don't have to use a bread machine mix and the bread still turns out nice and soft.  Never mind that they taste wonderful!  Thanks for sharing!

The best ever.
  If you are using instant yeast you don't need the second rise.  Program the bread maker to knead, turn off machine after the knead cycle and let dough REST for 10 minutes, dump dough, and proceed to shape the rolls.  
Let the rolls rise for approximately 1 hour, or until double in size.  Cook as directed.

Using this method for all rolls and breads using instant yeast works beautifully, saves time, and better looking rolls, because it doesn't need a second rise.    Thats why it's called instant.
The water temperature for instant yeast, rapid rise or bread machine is between 120 and 128 degrees, instead of the 110 degree water needed for actaive dry yeast.

***Update: I bake them @ 375 for 16MINS. They are soft! I make them as crescents but fill them w/ ham, egg, and cheddar cheese. I brush a bit of butter when I roll out the dough and then brush the tops.

Yummy!  These rolls remind me of the rolls my grandma used to make.  Everyone always begged her to make them, and they were always the first thing to go at dinner.  I know I'm going to have the same problem.  :)

Update:  I made these again the other night and did not have enough flour, so I used a cup and a half of all purpose and made up for the rest with wheat flour.  I followed the rest of the recipe as it was and I ended up with one of the best wheat roll recipes I've ever had!!  Very tender, sweet and not dry at all.

These rolls are amazing. They are so easy to make and delicious. I use my stand mixer for this. I proof the yeast in the warm water w/ a little sugar. Then I put the wet ingredients in the bowl and mix in the flour and salt. I let it "knead" on low for about 5 mins. I let it rise, shape into rolls and rise again. It is a winner.

This is a great recipe! I don't have a bread maker so I dissolved the yeast in the water and then added the remaining ingrediants, mixing and kneading until the dough looked like it should. The dough was pretty sticky so I did have to add a little more flour. Let it rise for an hour and then followed the directions from then on. These were large, fluffy, soft and the sweet was subtle. Great with honey butter! Next time, I'll try making these into balls and cooking them in a pie dish (like pull-aparts)! Thanks for the versatile, "good w/ everything" recipe Donna!

A+ Recipe. Would give this more than 5 stars if possible.  Rolls used to be flat (tho flavorful) hockey pucks and became a family joke. This recipe and the Bread Machine Rolls at this site changed all that for me. These were doughy and yeasty and buttery and wonderful.  Rolled into 12 balls, placed in 13x9 pan to rest for 1 hour, then baked for 12 minutes.  They rose up beautifully and this family of 5 ate 2 each and gave them 2 thumbs up.
Will become a weekly regular for us.  Thanks Donna.

I made these rolls for thanksgiving and wow...They were gone so fast! I am glad I grabbed the 2 that I did, otherwise I wouldn't have had any. Deliscious, sweet, buttery...OMG. BEST DINNER ROLL I EVER MADE! I warmed the milk on the stove, melted 1/3c butter and the sugar in it and let sit till lukewarm. mixed into proofed yeast (in the 1/3c warm water and 1 T sugar) added flour a bit at a time, kneeded, let rise, and baked in 375 degree oven for 12 or so, till golden. I put put melted butter on after it was baked. YUM, I got a request to bring make them for our New Year's DAy Feast!

Let me start by saying that *I do not* make yeast breads!!  I bake and cook lots of things, but yeast breads are not my forte.  This being said, I was assigned to bring rolls for Thanksgiving.  I had saved this recipe, and decided to throw caution to the wind, and make these.  I could not have been more pleased.  They were not difficult to make, actually quite easy to roll out and form into crescents, and let me tell you . . . they were soft and buttery and delicious.  I brushed them with melted butter just after I took them out of the oven.  I highly recommend these lovely little rolls.  Simply yummy!

This is always my contribution to family dinners now. They are delicious and so easy. I don't do the extra layer of butter but just roll the dough into a log after taking out of machine. I use a dough cutter to cut dough evenly and place in pan to rise. If making for just my family I will put half in freezer on baking tray after final rise and then put in freezer bag when frozen. Put in oven frozen at 325 for 15-20 min and they taste like fresh.  Also like to add minced garlic to ingredients.

I've made these twice now for two separate dinner gatherings and have gotten rave reviews both times.  I do not have a bread machine, so I mix yeast and warm water together, let it get foamy, then I mix with the remainder of the ingredients, place in a bowl, cover it with a clean towel and let it rise until double in size - about an hour or so.  Punch it down, knead a few times and then I pinch off and form rolls (sizewise, they fit in the palm of my hand) place about an inch apart on a baking sheet and let the rolls rise again until about double in size, pop in 400 degree oven for about 12 minutes and they come out great!!

This recipe uses the exact same measurments as my longtime family favorite! These rolls are sweet and delicous. You can also roll the dough into 36 small balls, place 3 balls into each muffin cup of a standard muffin tin and they make 12 pretty clover rolls! This recipe is a keeper!!

These rolls are delicious! I also made them for Easter. One thing that might help others is one package yeast equals 2 1/4 tsp. of yeast in a jar. Another reviewer wrote something else that was not correct. If you use only 1 1/2 tsp your rolls will not rise and they will be dense.

These rolls were good enough to eat plain.  They even tasted greatthe next day without being reheated.

I don't have a bread machine, so I simply mixed the sugar, salt, yeast, and water and let sit for five minutes.  Then I mixed the other ingredients and covered the dough and let it rise an hour.  The rest of the recipe I followed as written.

I think next time I may add a little more sugar to the dough and serve them with honey butter.

I just shaped these into balls and put them into a 9x13. I baked at 350 for 15 min. They didn't rise as much as I would have liked. I think I'm going to keep looking for a better recipe. Tasted wonderful though.

Awesome, easy recipe.  Because I have a small family, we don't eat as many rolls as this makes so take the recipe through the shaping of the rolls and then I freeze them until I need more. Then I take them out let them thaw at room temp let them rise and bake accordingly.

Great rolls!! I don't have a bread-maker either so i found this food network video a year or two ago of bobby flay making Parker house rolls without a bread maker. I remembered it when i read some of the reviews and just took this recipe and made it the same way he makes his house rolls. The video is quick, simple, and hands on for those of you cooks out there that need it just like I do!!  enjoy!

Delicious!  Made cloverleaf rolls instead of crescents (rolled 3 balls and put them in cupcake holders).  Will make again and again!

UPDATE:  Have made these one houndred times.  THE BEST!  I make the dough in the breadmachine.  LOVE this recipe!

I made these exactly as they are described with one difference and that is I made them into balls instead of cresent shaped.  My whole family loves these.  I am constantly being begged to make more of these.  They are also very easy to make!

Although, I do not have a bread machine any longer, I decided to make these rolls using the traditional method.  I proofed the yeast in the 1/2 cup of warm water with 1 tsp sugar. Heated the milk, added the sugar, butter, salt,removed from heat, and stirred till disolved. Then added the beaten egg once the milk mixture was slightly warm.  In a large mixing bowl I combined the yeast, milk mixture and added the flour gradually.  Kneaded for about 8 to 10 minutes and let rise for 1 hour in a tea towel covered bowl. Punched down and formed balls for clover leaf rolls. Let rolls rise again for 1 hour. Baked at 375 for 15 minutes and brushed with melted butter.  Delicious!!

After many years of trying to find the right dinner roll recipe, I have finally found it!  These are even better than school lunch rolls!  I rolled the dough into balls and put them in a 9x13 pan.  (I think there were 15).  When they raised they grew together so after baking they could be pulled apart.  This is a GREAT recipe!

Very good rolls. I did let the dough sit out of the machine before kneading it (THanks whoever you are for the tip) and it was very easy to work with and need little additional flour. Now I'm going to be brave and try other roll recipes with my machine. Great recipe.

This was my first time making rolls and I was surprised how easy it was. I followed MommyFromSeattles tips and also made cloverleaf rolls. I had enough dough to make exactly 12 rolls in the larger muffin tins. I used 2 1/2 tsps of Rapid Rise yeast. Next time I think I will take these out after 10 minutes of baking. From MommyFromSeattle: "I made cloverleaf rolls and baked for 12 min. exactly. Soft, moist, tender and flavorful. I used rapid-rise yeast (which only requires one rise) and had these on the table within 2 hours. No changes needed - amazing! TIP - I make this by hand using Rapid Rise yeast (aka Bread Machine yeast). I warm the water to 110-120 degrees and add to the yeast and sugar in my KitchenAid mixer. Let stand for 10 minutes until foamy (same for any type yeast). Then I add the warm milk, melted butter, salt & egg and mix well with paddle attachment. I then add the flour one cup at a time. When dough comes together, switch to dough hook and knead for 5 minutes (6-7 min. if doing it by hand). I cover the dough and let sit in my bowl to rest for 10 min. then I shape into rolls and let rise for 1 hour."

I have made these rolls several times, and they always turn out great and disappear quickly! They are my favorite roll recipe.  When I am going to have company in the evening I have made them in the morning, covered them (raise dough and form rolls) and then put them in the fridge and taken them out about 30 minutes before I want to cook them. Let them sit on the counter for that time and cook normally, they still turn out great and you can keep a cleaner kitchen. I have also never used a bread maker. I put the water, milk, butter, sugar and salt in a small pan and heat until barely warm, then add to the 2c. flour/yeast and use a hand blender to add in the egg, then add the remaining flour and knead like normal.

5 Stars isn't enough!  You dont even need butter on these babies!!  Perfect!
 Made the dough the night before and refrigerated. 
 I made these into clover rolls.  Put them in my bread maker...  looked dry so I added more warm water as it began to mix.  When dough was finished, rolled it out on counter, then cut and rolled into balls.  Sprayed muffin tins with Pam for Baking.   Put 3 balls in each muffin tin.  Was able to make 24 clover rolls.   
Tightly wrapped in saran wrap and put in the fridge.  Next morning, took out, unwrapped, and set on counter for a hours until I was ready to bake them.  They rose nicely on the counter.  Baked for 10 minutes.  
Everyone raved about them!   Even fought over the last ones!!!   Will make again for sure!!

New favorite! If I am in a hurry, I pinch off a walnut sized ball of dough and shape into a ball, rise and bake, brush butter on when I take out of the oven. Also, I do the balls and freeze them before rising on cookie sheet. Once frozen put in a freezer bag with oven temp and time. Depending on the heat in my kitchen, frozen dough takes 2 to 4 hours to rise before baking. We also LOVE cinnamon rolls from this recipe. Make ahead, freeze and allow to rise before baking!

so delicious!  Very soft and sweet!  I even substituted 1 cup whole grain flour for the all purpose flour and they turned out great.  I also reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup.  And I think next time I'll reduce a little more...  they were good, but I dont think they need to be so sweet.

These are delicious and so easy! Instead of the bread machine I combined everything in a large bowl and mixed it until it was completely combined. Then I kneaded it for about 5 minutes and let it rest for 45 minutes. Then I cut it into balls and put in 12 muffin cups. I rubbed the tops with 3 TBS. softened butter and baked them for 15 minutes. They were golden brown and flaky and great with butter and honey.

Not much to add to previous reviews, but these are absolutely delicious rolls. I've tried a lot of recipes, and this is by far our favorite. Very moist and slightly sweet. Just wonderful. I baked 8 to a pan in an 8" round cake pan. I brushed with melted butter after baking. It makes 16 big, buttery, pillowy rolls.

Straight up excellent.  Made by hand:  mixed warm water & yeast for 10 min, then mixed w/ all oth ingred.  Knead 7-10 min by hand, let rise in warmed microwave 45-60 min.  Punch down, shape into rolls, place on ungreased baking sheet, cover w/ kitchen towel and let rise again 45-60 min.  Bake, 400 degrees for 13 min.  I prefer my rolls slightly doughy, and this was right on the money.  Tried first w/ honey butter which was wonderful, then tried with some homemade CrockPot apple butter, to which my daughter said "This is like eating angel's wings".  Definite keeper.

These rolls are AWESOME.  I have made these probably 5 times now, each time with bread flour instead of all purpose flour.  Last night for the first time, I made them with all purpose flour.  They were SIGNIFICANTLY better with bread flour.  Much lighter and fluffier.  I have made them as cloverleafs (36 balls, 3 balls per cupcake cup) and also as sandwich rolls.  I add the butter to the top of each ball when doing cloverleafs, and left it off entirely for the sandwich rolls.  Once formed, I leave them to rise for an hour.  They also rise a lot when baking, so make sure they are not too close to the heat source or you may scorch the tops.

Perfect dinner rolls. I am not a five star kinda gal, but this EXCEEDED my high expectations. I do not own a bread maker, so I did the traditional steps. I combined the warm water, yeast, and a tablespoon of the sugar set aside. Scalded the milk, removed from heat added the butter and sugar. Combined the milk mixture with the yeast mixture, added the salt, egg,and gradually added the flour. Kneed for 8 minutes. Let rise in a greased bowl for one hour. Punched down and divided into sixteen equal pieces. With the remaining butter I dipped my fingers and rolled each piece into a ball and put in rows in a 9x9. It fit four rows of four exactly. Let rise 45 minutes, and baked 15 minuted @ 350. When finished I brushed the tops with butter.They pull apart nicely. Thank you, thank you.

Great taste. Best yeast rolls ever! These were a hit at home and at the office pitch-in. I divided dough into 24 rolls - baked in a 9x13 - so easy.

These were OUTSTANDING! Truly, some of the BEST rolls (heck, some of the best BREAD) that I've ever had in my life. So moist, so fluffy, so delicious! I didn't even need to butter them afterward, and I butter butter! I have a bread machine, but I prefer to do bread by hand, so here's what I did: I mixed the water and milk together and microwaved it for about a minute and a half. I poured this mixture into a big bowl, and then I immediately mixed in the sugar (this will cool down the temperature of the water/milk to right about where it needs to be for the yeast to activate) and then added the yeast. It took about 15 minutes to get good and foamy, and after that, I added the salt, egg, and butter. Then, I mixed the flour in a little bit at a time. Then I turned the dough out, put it in a lightly greased bowl, covered it with a cloth, and let it rise in my oven (with it off!) with a pan of hot water underneath it for 45 minutes. After that, I punched it down, took it out, divided it in half, and rolled each half into a pizza crust size. I buttered it with the 1/4 cup, cut the circles into pizza sized pieces, and then rolled them tightly from the bottom. I put them on a lightly greased pan, seam down, covered them with a towel, and let them rise the same way for an hour. Then I baked at 400 degrees for 9 minutes. PERFECT!

I doubled the recipe, and did everything in my KitchenAid. The milk and water mixture was a little too warm so I poured it in the KitchenAid bowl over the sugar and let it cool while the sugar dissolved. I mixed the softened butter, eggs and salt in a separate bowl, then added to the proofed/activated yeast mixture.  I added the flour 1 cup at a time while the KitchenAid mixed it with the dough hook.  I let the kitchen aid need the dough for about eight minutes.  I turned the dough out onto a floured surface and divided into four equal balls, then roll each one out into a 12 to 14 inch circle.  I brushed them with melted butter and formed them into the croissant shapes, place them on cookie sheets and let them rise for an hour.  I bake them at 350° for 10-15 minutes and they turned out perfect!!  I brushed melted butter over each one of them twice just to make them extra buttery. So delicious!!!  I have to grab one right out of the oven or I don't get any!

These are amazing. Very soft and chewy. I didn't have a bread maker, so I just used my stand mixer. I warmed the milk and water in the microwave to 115 degrees. I added the sugar and the yeast and let sit for about 20 minutes until the yeast was foamy. I added the yeast mixture, butter and salt to the bowl of the stand mixture, and then gradually added the flour. Once combined, I changed to my dough hook and kneaded in the mixer for 5 minutes. I let it rest covered in the bowl for 2 hours. Then I shaped into rols and let rest for 30 minutes. Then I baked them for about 15 minutes at 350.

Perfect rolls!  I baked half and put the other half in the freezer!  A trick to the second rise:  pre-heat the oven to 200F and then turn it off, put the tray with the rolls in the warm oven and they rise perfectly!  Baked at 400F for 12 minutes and they were right on the money!

These rolls were a hit and a half!  My little 100lb grandmother ate 3 of them, and that's saying a lot for her.  My family is fairly picky about new recipes, but this will definitely be a new favorite.  Rather than measuring out the butter to spread on the two flattened halves of dough, I just spreaded until it looked right...like very generously buttered bread.  I think it ended up being a bit more than the recipe called for.

I have a bread machine, and I used it with this recipe. I proofed the yeast in the warm water because I don't have bread machine yeast, but these were the best batch of rolls I have ever made. My friends, and family loved them!! I served with peach butter delish!!

This recipe it great! I first made it as the recipe dictates. The rolls were delicious. Wanting to be a little healthier, I used honey instead of sugar. I also cut the honey down to 1/4 cup. I used 2 cups of bread flour and 1 3/4 whole wheat flour. My family loves this as sandwich bread. Sometimes I throw in a handful of old fashioned rolled oats, too. Fantastic and versatile recipe!

I joined allrecipes specifically to review this recipe. I have tried many roll recipes & this is by far my favorite. My husband told me to "stop searching for other recipes" because this is the only one he ever wants me to make again. I followed the advice of K PRAPER & prepared the dough in a Kitchen Aid. Rolls were soft, fluffy, & delicious. Thanks Donna for sharing!

These rolls are as awesome as the 5-star rating implies!  I was initially unsure about making these because of the word "sweet" in the title, but this dough is just right for dinner rolls.  I mixed the dough by hand since I don't have a bread machine (or even a KitchenAid), so in addition to getting amazing rolls for dinner, I also got a serious bicep workout :).  Delicious recipe!  I'll definitely keep this one close at hand.

One of the best recipies on this site! The rolls are very soft and sweet, perfect for any meal. But watch them while in the oven, they will cook and burn very fast.

I made two batches of these for Thanksgiving- one with white flour and one with half whole wheat flour. They both came out beautifully. This may be the best bread dough I've ever made - and I've been making bread for a long time.  The amount of flour was actually perfect, which almost never happens - but it could have been the weather that day.  Anyway, this recipe is near perfect and I wouldn't change a thing, other than using whole wheat flour if desired. I can't wait to use this to make cinnamon rolls!

Wellllll, not sure what went wrong, but these did not turn out for me at all and I was soooo looking forward to these after reading all the rave reviews.  I read a lot of the reviews and made a few alterations such as not forming into crescents, but just made half into the cloverleaf rolls and half into rolls just dropped onto a cookie sheet. I did not deviate at all from the ingredients or the method of using the dough cycle on my bread machine.  The dough was still really dense when I put them in the oven and they did not rise at all while baking.  I do want to try these again, maybe I should try new yeast.  So, as disappointing as this has been, I'm still giving this 4.5 stars because I'm 99% sure the result was due to operator error.

These rolls are so delicious! I make them all the time. I usually use half the dough for dinner rolls and use the other half for cinnamon rolls in the morning. This is definitely a must-have in the recipe box!

Overall, these are great rolls, though I think that the word 'Sweet' in the title lead me to believe that they would have a stronger sweetness. Keep in mind that the sugar is really only noticed in the aftertaste. Because I like my rolls to have a noticeable yet subtle hint of sugar, I would add to the amount of sugar in the future by another quarter cup. 
The buttery smell and taste is phenomenal and went very well with our Chicken Cordon Bleu dinner. Thanks for the recipe! :)

Thanks so much for a great recipe! I don't have a bread machine and i've never had much luck with bread recipes making them the traditional way...they're either too hard, too chewy, somewhat uncooked etc. This turned out absolutely perfect. I nuked the milk and water for abt 30 seconds, stirred in the sugar, addd the yeast and waited for 20 mins. Then i added in the butter, egg and salt, and lastly the flour in slow spoonfuls. Kneaded it for 25 minutes or so, let it rise for an hr, then rolled it out and spreaded a mix of dried fruits soaked in honey and rum. Roll the dough back up, plopped it in a pan and let it rise for another hour. Did a simple egg white wash, sprinkled cinnamon sugar and some nuts and baked it for 25 mins or so. The rolls were fluffy, light and soft. Fab! only note was that i saw the review of it being not sweet enough so i upped the sugar by another half. Even my mom was impressed and she is one HARD nut to crack *puffs out chest*

I made in my Breadman Bread machine for the dough.  I used bread machine yeast. 2 1/4 tsp. Took 1 hr. and 20 minutes in machine.  Took out dough and split in half. Rolled out and spread softened butter and cut in 8ths. I let them rise until doubled. Took about 13-15 minutes to bake. Oh my gosh, these are delicious. These are light and perfect!!!  These are the perfect size!  Favorite recipe.  Thank you for sharing a wonderful and great recipe.

These are the BEST rolls I have ever made!  The dough is beautiful and easy to work with.  The taste is phenomenal.  Just like a roll that you would get at a restaurant.  I brushed them with melted butter right out of the oven.  I will be making these awesome rolls again and again and again......

Beautiful and tasty. Make sure they (at least) double in size before baking for lighter texture. I noticed my second tray was better because they had more time to sit and rise. UPDATE: Makes great yeast doughnuts too (add some freshly grated nutmeg for doughnuts and beignets)!! Add some orange zest and dried cranberries for a superb holiday bread!! I have also made rolls stuffed with sweet potato mash, chocolate squares or sweet red bean paste and even cinnamon rolls; all versions came out divine.

YEAST ROLLS - that's what these are!  You know those rolls you get at Logans or Ryans?  Only somehow better!  I didn't know it was possible to make them at home, from scratch.  I stuck to the recipe until after I removed the dough from my bread maker.  Then I just made 16 rolls out of them, without brushing them with butter.  After they were done I did brush them with butter, though.  It was so quick and easy.  While they were rising I made soup.  I cooked them for closer to 10 minutes and they were just turning brown on top.  This one of those recipes I wish I could give 10 stars.  thank you!!!

I prepared the dough exactly as directed - but instead of rolling it out and buttering it before forming into crescent style rolls - I made 96 little balls (about 1" or less) out of the dough (adding flour to my hands as needed) - and placed four each in each section of my muffin tins and created 24 rolls.  After rising - I egg brushed each one and sprinkled with poppy seeds. They turned out beautifully.  What a treat!  Thank you for sharing the dough recipe.

OMG!!!! This was the first time I've ever made homemade rolls of any kind and was blown by how simple and delicious this recipe was.  I learned patience "is" rewarding!  While I meant to make these in time for dinner...they turned out to be a midnight snack...which reminded my husband and I of a favorite movie..."As Good As It Gets" which happens to have a scene about getting to the bakers in the wee hours of the morning to get fresh hot rolls.  I added a tiny bit more sugar and what I imagined it would taste like was exact.  I also used organic all purpose flour, which I don't know if it made a difference or not (too inexperienced in baking to know the difference)the result though was a tender, lovely texture and color, sweet roll.  Added a bit of butter to the hot roll and yum!  There are only 5 rolls left since last night. Thank you for this recipe it will be a family favorite!

I made these for Thanksgiving dinner and they were a big hit. Nice flavor and texture. Will definitely make these again. I didn't make them by hand; I made the dough in my Bosch mixer and also used instant yeast, so they had to raise only once.

here's what I did:
 
 I mixed the water and milk, nuked in in the microwave for 1 minute and 15 seconds, poured it into the bowl of my KitchenAid mixer, then stirred in the sugar until it dissolved, then stirred in the yeast. I use yeast from a jar instead of packets, and I used 2.5 teaspoons. After it got foamy (I only waited about 10 minutes...I'm impatient) I mixed in the salt, butter and egg, then I started mixing the flour a half cup at a time. I let it rise for about 45 minutes in the bowl, then punched it down, divided it into 16 balls (I didn't feel like making crescents) and let it rise for another hour, then baked for 10 minutes. They turned out like something from a bakery. I have never, ever baked bread this wonderful. I am so bummed that I am home alone right now and nobody can see what a wonderful thing I just did!
 I also want to add, pay attention to the temperature of your oven...My oven tends to be extremely hot, so I only set it for 350 to bake these...they turned out perfect. I know 400 degrees would have blackened them.

I'm experienced in making yeast doughs and this recipe makes one of the best doughs I've come across.  I made it for cinnamon rolls and used the Clone of a Cinnabon recipe for the filling and frosting. I love that it calls for the use of pantry ingredients that I always have on hand.  Did not feel like lugging out the bread machine and was happy to discover that everything came together quickly and beautifully in the KitchenAid.  I let the dough hooks do all the kneading that was necessary and the dough was perfect.  If you do not have a bread machine, fear not.  Just read thru the directions that have already been given in previous reviews and you'll be OK.  For those who had trouble getting the dough to rise remember that the temperature of your liquids should be 110.  If your liquids are too cool the yeast will not activate; too hot and you'll kill it.  This dough does take a little longer to rise so you absolutely must wait until your dough is doubled in size on both the first and second rise before proceeding.  It left me wondering if it really would have risen fully had I used my bread machine because first rise took almost 2 hours.  It was worth the wait because I didn't even have to get out the rolling pin---I too patted the dough out with my fingertips into a 15x20 rectangle and went from there. I found that it also took the shaped rolls a little longer to rise, but they came out very well and were absolutely delicious.  All were devoured at Christmas brunch!

Excellent. I had lost my favorite roll recipe so went looking for a similar one. Then I altered it by accident the third time I used it! I inadvertently doubled the liquid ( ie I used one cup each of milk and water, rather than .5 c each as called for). I realized it after my bread machine did the initial knead and rise. So, I just punched it down and kneaded more flour in by hand until the dough felt right ( satiny, elastic and no longer sticky). Then I let it rise, punched down, and kneaded twice more before shaping the rolls. The extra rises makes a much finer grained roll so it is worth it if you have the time. Made this way, I got 18 large rolls made in 9 inch square cake tins and 6 cloverleaf rolls make in muffin tins. Otherwise, I have left the recipe the same. I have used the recipe this way several times with consistent results. Health and budget tip: It is a bit more economical and lower in fat this way as you are not increasing the butter and egg,  just the milk, water and flour. Also, I used 1 % milk. These rolls freeze very well by the way.

These are very yummy.  I don't have a bread machine but my trusty KitchenAid stand mixer came to the rescue.  I nuked the milk/water/sugar  and added it to the mixer bowl until the sugar was desolved then added the packet of yeast, and let it all sit for 10 mins.  Then I added the egg, butter and salt and added the flour 1/2 cup at a time.  I switched from the mix blade to the dough hook and kneaded it for about 8-10 mins then proofed for 1 hour in the oven on 'proof setting'.  Punched down the dough &  divided into thirds then cut each piece into 8 equal pieces-rolled the pieces into balls and placed them in aluminum pans coated w/butter.  I also topped each round with a bit of butter.  Placed pans back into oven on proof setting for another 15 mins then baked at 375 for 8-10 mins.   I wrapped 2 of the pans in aluminum foil for freezing and will thaw & reheat when needed.  The remaining pan didn't last long.  Thank you for this keeper recipe.

Made two batches within 3 days! Crazy good, everyone thinks I'm an amazing baker after tasting these. I lowered the sugar to barely a 1/4 cup and they still came out wonderful. Also, I didn't use 1/4 cup for spreading, maybe about two TBSP and it was still wonderful.

i always want to make something like this bread, mini light and soft like from bakery, since my husband loves this kind for sweeping the pasta sauce. The recipe looks easy, but I dont have bread machine, almost forget this recipe but then so many reviews sharing great ideas and experiences about making this without bread machine, wow, it brings my appetite back! :D Thank you thank youuuu all!

Just gave 2 starts only until I can make it my own and see the result ;)

Excellent yeasty warm lovely rolls. Be careful with adding flour as you can always add more. The softer the dough the better the rise. These disappear as fast as I can get them from the oven. Super Yummy!

Very good!  I have also made this with one cup of water and 1/4 cup of powdered milk when there was no milk in the house and these rolls came out just as good.  Absolutely love this recipe!

I don't have a bread machine  so I used K. Praper's format (User on this site with the highest ranked most helpful review). Instead of adding to kitchen aide mixer, I kneaded for 8 minutes and then formed into small golf balls. I then dunked each ball into a bowl of melted butter to coat and allowed to rise an additional hour while laying on the baking sheet. Deeeeeeelish! Not a single roll was left!

I've used this recipe twice, once as round dinner rolls and once as cinnamon rolls, using all-purpose flour and using the bread maker to mix it both times.  When I made the round rolls I used exactly 2.25 tsp Fleischmann's Active Dry Yeast (I don't use packets). The rolls came out a little dense but very tasty.  With the cinnamon rolls I used about 1/8 tsp more yeast, and I was probably more careful about letting them proof long enough (I wasn't in a hurry), and they came out light and wonderful - exactly the right texture.  So for any who are thinking you need to use bread flour to get them lighter, you might try this method.  Everyone thought they were just delicious in any case, and I'll be keeping this one as my go-to dough recipe.  Thank you!

*updated 12/29/11: I made this as a cloverleaf roll for Christmas and got raves.  I used bread flour and exactly 2.25 tsp yeast and they were light and tender.  Just made them again today (my husband loves them) and used AP flour with 2.5 tsp yeast and that worked really well too.  One batch easily makes 18 cloverleaf rolls in muffin tins.  Delicious!

I made these and they turned out absolutely great as seen in the snap..I too followed the hand kneading way. Fermented yeast with water. in another bowl mixed flour with rest of the ingredients..covered with dampcloth and left for an hour..one it proved i  put in on floured surface and made them into wanted shapes and kept covered. After it doubled in size put them in preheted oven and baked till golden brown...Sweet...Everybody loved it...I have never been so happy Thanks alot Donna for sharing this recipe

The bread is delicious and relatively easy to make.  However, next time I will put less flour so my bread can come out a little softer... Well, I did add a little extra flour to get the dough easier to handle but I think that is what I did wrong... According to my friend (a pro in homemade bread) if the dough is a little sticky the bread is going to be softer...
Thanks Donna for the recipe! i will definitely make it again...

I have been experimenting with my bread machine lately with new recipes. I wanted something light and fluffy and not so heavy for dinner. I found this recipe. Delicious. What I did instead of rolling them up was roll out the dough in a large triangle. I then buttered the top of the dough and cut out around 24 squares (a pizza cutter works great for this). I then met all four corners in the center like a parachute and flipped them over to rise in 3 9" round cake pans. Between the kids, their friends, my husband, and myself, there were none left! Once again delicious! Thank you!

I don't have a bread machine either, so I basically followed the directions of summer_lover (the 2nd Most Helpful review) AND baked at 375 for 15 min.   I did put in 2 c. of whole wheat flour and then only needed about 1 1/4 c. white flour.  Did not make into crescents.  After rolling into balls, I let rise another 30 min.  I have not baked yeast bread/rolls in over 20 years and these turned out WONDERFUL!

These rolls are not sweet, but they're perfect. When I made them I put in home made cherry pie filling and they turned out delicious. But I think any cherry pie filling would work. My parents and everyone else loved them!!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I was trying it out for a dinner party at my house when everything in the world went wrong.  The dough sat for entirely too long before I took it out of the breadmaker, and I couldn't even form the traditional crescent shapes with it.  I just made balls of dough and threw it into the oven in case it would still taste good.  It was wonderful!  They were gobbled up before I knew it, and the guests all voted to make it a standing request every time they come over.  Success!!

If you form 16 rolls from the recipe, they will come out quite large.  I made 30 traditional-shaped rolls from this recipe and the rolls were a smaller, better size.  (You can always eat two!)  After I formed the balls and placed them into the 13” X 9” pan, I tightly covered the pan with cellophane and popped it into the freezer.  That was about one week ago.  This morning, I pulled out three frozen balls of dough and placed them into a small loaf pan sprayed with “baking spray” and covered it with cellophane.  I went to work and left this pan out all day to rise.  When I came home, the rolls had risen in the pan.  I baked a tri-tip in the oven for dinner, and when I took the roast out of the oven, I put the little loaf pan in.  I baked the rolls for 11 minutes on 350 while the meat was “resting.”  They came out wonderful.  It is a good thing I only baked 3 because we would have eaten all of them.  I figure this way, I can pull out however many I need for one meal and we will always have them freshly baked.

Did w/o breadmaker.  Let it rise for 45min then punched it down and let it rise for an hour, they came out fluffy and wonderful.  To activate the yeast I just added water, some of the sugar, and the yeast then I added the rest after it got foamy.

I would give these 10 stars if I could. I didn't use a bread machine so I put warm milk, warm water and yeast in a bowl for about 15 minutes then added the other ingredients and let sit for about an hour. Divided it up into 12 balls and let them sit for another hour and then baked. I also made these once without extra time to rise and they were still yummy, just not as airy as before.

Very good. I made clover leaf rolls by placing 3 balls each in a muffin tin. I let them rise a couple of hours. They were very impressive and tasted great.

These are SO good, you won't believe you made them yourself. Ok, maybe you will believe it. I couldn't. I kept asking: "Did I just made these awesome buttery soft rolls myself?"   I have a bread machine (Zojirushi), so I followed the recipe and at the end, made the criossant shapes with one of the halves and with the other half I made both clover leaf rolls and single round rolls. Excellent in any shape or form. They did cook faster for me at 400 degrees it just took about 9 minutes.

I have made a LOT of bread and roll recipes and consider myself a good baker.  These rolls were absolutely fantastic.  They are definitely the best rolls I have ever made.  Don't over bake or they will be dry.  I used margarine in place of the butter in the dough.  Also, instead of doing them crescent style, I just did a fat long log (about 3 or so inches in diameter) and just cut 1" slices out and laid them in the pan- cinnamon roll style.  I took them to my IL's for a family lunch.  They eat a lot of bread and are critical about any bread they are served.  My rolls disappeared.  Try them brown and serve style for easy bake ahead rolls.  Bake for 5-10 minutes (depending on the size) until they are barely starting to brown.  Remove from the oven, let them cool on a rack and then put directly into the freezer to flash freeze on a tray.  Package them and when you want hot rolls, pull them out and bake for 5-10 minutes again until they're brown.  Definitely double or quadruple this recipe.  This is my new roll recipe, for sure!

Spectacular, fluffy, tender rolls! I made these as 'clover' rolls in muffin tins, and brushed the extra butter over top. The tops had a very delicate, just slightly crisp crust fresh out of the oven. (Toootally divine.) The insides were light, and extremely soft! I am so impressed with these. Made completely by hand - no bread machine or mixer. Dough is beautiful. Soft and springy. Flour amount was perfect. Wow. Make these rolls. Do it. Right now. I mean it!

WOW!  These are soooo fabulous!  I was in a hurry and prefer to use my Kitchenaid vs my breadmaker, so here's my speed method.  I dumped all the ingredients into my bowl in the order of the recipe.  I did not proof the yeast package, but it didn't seem to matter.  I blended everything on speed 2 for 5 minutes.  Then I pinched off 16 pieces of the sticky dough, coated my hands in flour and rolled each piece into a ball. Placed in greased muffin pan with kitchen towel over the top, set on my dryer and let the dryer frun for 60 mins drying my clothes and it also let the dough rise beautifully.  I made 12 BIG rolls and they tasted wonderful!  Great recipe!  I will continue to use, especially in my own speedy way!  Thanks so much!

These rolls were very disappointing. They weren’t bad; they just don’t come close to all the hype. They weren’t in the least bit sweet and were actually pretty heavy – closer in weight to a biscuit than a roll from some restaurant. (Not to say they taste like a biscuit they don’t.) Maybe the weight and texture of the roll comes from using regular flour instead of bread flour, I’m not sure. I won’t be making them again. I’d give it 3 ½ stars; all-in-all a mediocre product for your efforts.

I followed the reviews by K PRAPER and Chars3girls because I also did not have a bread machine.  I used my KitchenAid Mixer with the dough hook.  Everything turned out well. I also made the rolls from balls instead of the crescents. Baked them at 375 F  for 15 minutes.  The family loved them.  They put in a request to have these at the holidays instead of the store bought biscuits or crescents.

Very easy to make, kids said it taste just like store bought.  I baked them in the oven at 375 until barely light brown, then store in fridge until ready to eat.  Reheat at 350 for 8-10 minutes.  Convenient dinner rolls.

I found that I couldn't get the dinner rolls to stay in a nice crescent shape, so I rolled them into balls and put them into an 8" square pan for baking.  They got beautifully brown on top, and we ended up with 16 very delicious pull apart buns!

These sweet rolls turned out awesome! I am now known as the queen of dinner rolls thanks to this recipe. Instead of using milk I used powdered buttermilk and I also substituted olive oil for the butter and added 2 Tb. more sugar and 3 Tb. honey. This is a must try!

This recipe is WONDERFUL!!!My favorite bread recipe (I make bread several times a week), the whole family loves it.  I've made this several times, as round rolls, crescent and -my favorite- cinnamon rolls.  Very soft with a hint of sweet.  I did add a bit of vanilla to the cinnamon roll dough, and I do melt my butter prior to adding it (I always forget to take it out to soften in time).  Will make this over and over and over...

This is a great recipe. It makes wonderful cinnamon rolls as well. I rolled them out and spread the dough with the butter.  Then I filled them with a mix of 1 cup brown sugar and 4 tsp cinnamon and peacans.  Then topped with cream cheese or powder sugar frosting.  I was told by my in-laws that they are better then cinnabon.  I also baked them for 5 minutes the night before and finished up the next morning for five more minutes---Perfect!

These are fantastic.  A big hit for our family dinner.  I made them without the bread machine.
Wet ingredients together.  Sprinkle with yeast....leave a few minutes.  stir in dry ingredients and knead until elastic and smooth.  Let rise an hour until double in size.  Shape according to directions and let rise again.  PERFECT!

Although baked for the suggested length of time (15 mins) these were not nearly done, I am sure they would have been wonderful it left in for 20 mins.

I made these for a dinner we had at church and they were absolutely fantastic.  They are easy to make and no worry of how long do I Knead it.  The bread machine does it for you.  I even made cinnamon rolls out of this recipe as well.  When you roll it out and spread the margarine / butter sprinkle generously with a cinnamon sugar mixture and top with a powdered sugar and milk glaze after baking.  I will continue to make this recipe over and over again.  At the dinner a mom came up to me and asked for the recipe because she cannot get her kids to eat bread of any sort.  Both girls had between 3 and 5 rolls each.  They loved it.  Thank you so much for making my life easier in bread making.....

These are the best dinner rolls! For truly decadent rolls, I use whipping cream instead of milk. I also use real butter. And - I use bread flour - not all-purpose. Not really sure why - just never noticed that the recipe called for all-purpose. I heat the cream, the water, the sugar and the butter until the butter is almost melted. And temper the egg - add a little of the heated milk mixture to the egg, then mix the whole thing together. Every single time I make these, someone requests the recipe.

These dinner rolls came out excellent!  I too don't have a bread machine, so I followed another reviewers advice on what to do.  Anyhow, I didn't understand the part of rolling out the dough, slathering on the butter, cutting them into strips and rolling them back up.  I wanted dinner rolls, not sticky buns or that sort.  So what I did was just added melted butter to the dough, kneaded it a bit, then divided them into 16 rolls, rolling them into balls.  Packed them into a pan so they expand and touch one another (didn't want biscuits).  Then I baked them right after I made little x's on the top for decor and buttered them slightly more.  I also made 1/2 of the batch into herb rolls by simply adding thyme, marjoram and rosemary which also came out excellent.  Thanks

These were great!  My husband says they're the best rolls he's ever had!  I don't own a bread machine, so some regular instructions would have been nice too.  But out of one batch I made 8 rolls and a dozen cinnamon rolls.  Will definately make these again.

These rolls are awesome!  My friends and family loved them, especially my 2-year-old who is a very picky eater. I made the dough in my bread machine and it saved me from the work and mess. I will definitely be making these for Thanksgiving this year. Thank you for the recipe!!

Dough is easy to shape into balls, not sticky & messy. Great hit with my kids & the neighbour's. When I made them the second time, I added a slice of chocolate into each bread. It become our breakfast - pain chocolat! (choc bread in French)

I found this recipe three years ago on this website and have been making it ever since.  I gave it to my mother-in-law and she makes it 3 or 4 times a week.  It's the perfect dinner roll for any meal.  Just the perfect amount of sweetness and softness, too!  When I first found this recipe, I believe they made it into clover-leaf rolls, instead of crescent shaped rolls.  After the bread machine cycle ends, divide dough into thirds.  Then divide each third into 18 balls (each ball will be about the size of a quarter.  Place three balls in a triangle shape on the bottom of each muffin cup of a muffin tin.  This recipe will fill about 18 muffin cups to make 18 clover-leaf rolls.  They will make quite the impression on guests at dinner time!

Soooo easy to make and the bread machine does most of the work for you.  My husband loved these rolls and ate 6 at one sitting.  The next day, I warmed the leftovers in the microwave for about 15 seconds and they were delicious.  I would like to try and make the cinnamon rolls as the submitter suggest.  I served these with 'Orange Honey Butter' from AR and it was a nice choice to go with this sweet roll.

I have found my go-to recipe.  These are the softest rolls ever!  Better than store-bought.  I do not have a bread machine.  I kneaded the dough 10 minutes in a stand mixer, let it rise 1 hour, punched the dough down, and formed 25 balls.  The key to getting the fluffiest, softest rolls, though, is to let the little balls of dough rise until triple in volume, which took me about 1 and a half hours.  I omitted the extra 1/4 cup of butter, there's no need for that extra fat.  I baked half in muffin tins and half in a large baking dish.  I prefer the ones in the baking dish.  The ones from the muffin tins browned too much of the crust.  Thank you so much for this!   So cheap to make and so simple.

Best rolls I've ever made! I don't have a bread maker anymore so I made this in my kitchen aid. I also didn't bother rolling them out into crescents either, I just rolled them into about 20 little rolls and let them rise the second time right on the pan.

Okay, I love to cook and bake.  My husband and I joke about me not being able to make bread.  I cannot toast it, make it in a bread machine or anything.  I usually fail at bread.  This recipe was AMAZING.  For once, I am not a failure in the bread area anymore.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

Made this for cabbage burgers. The recipe made enough for 16 burgers and was super simple with my Kitchen Aid. I put the water, milk, sugar, salt and butter in a small sauce pan and heated them on low just until the butter was melted. It took about 10 minutes. Then I cooled it in the refrigerator until it was slightly warm to the touch. This took about 15 minutes. Put the warm mixture in the KA bowl with the yeast and let it sit for 10 minutes. Added the egg and mixed with the dough hook on low until the egg was mostly incorporated. Added the flour and ran mixer on 2 for 6 minutes. Let it rise for 1 hour and then made my cabbage burgers. Delicious. My husband thinks it will make great hamburger and brat buns. Can't wait to try it. This is my go to bread recipe from now on!

Absolutely delicious. I made these for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved them! I've never made bread before, and this recipe is so easy. The only thing I found problematic is the reliance on a bread machine. I had to search the comments for a way to do it without one. So I found a comment from "Joy" back in June 2007. Combine water, milk, and yeast, let stand 10 minutes to proof the yeast. Combine remaining ingredients and let rise for about 1 hour (or until it doubles in size), then follow the rest of the recipe. Easy.

I made these as rolls, super soft and fluffy but the flavor lacked. I think it needs maybe another tsp of salt cause they turned out with a hint of sweetness but there was no balance of salt in there because it is quite a bit of flour over all. will try again using more salt.

These are the best rolls! I like to make 36 balls (23 grams each to be precise). I use a cupcake pan and put about 1/2 tsp. butter in each cup. I roll each ball in the butter and put 3 balls in each cup. Bake at 400 for 10-12 minutes and brush with more butter when they come out. Sooo good, and pretty too!

I have no bread maker so I tested the yeast, made the bread and rather than make crescents I rolled them 1/2 in thick and I then cut 1 by 4 " strips, tied in a loop and rolled in butter. Let them rise in a flat pan and baked.  My family loved them and so did I .  Found a keeper with this recipe. Oh boy!  Wonderful luncheon size.

These are so easy and taste amazing!!  I also don't have a bread maker so I followed the suggestions from another review.  I used hot water and added my milk (and I used almond milk b/c we try not to have dairy) anyway, I microwaved it for about 45 seconds to a minute.  I then added the sugar to dissolve.  Once that was done I added the yeast, stirring until it was also dissolved, then let it sit until it was foamy... about 10 minutes.  Then I added the egg, salt and butter; mixed well, then added the flour a half cup at a time.  I allowed it to rise for 45 minutes, punched it down, separated into 16 rounds, allowed to rise again for another hour.  Baked as directed.  They were fantastic!!  I will make these over and over.

These are my go-to roll!  I think these have the taste of true homemade bread.  I make the dough in the bread machine and bake them in the oven in glass dishes.  It takes away the risk of the bottoms getting burnt or crisp, they turn out nice and soft this way.  It makes about 20 or so rolls and the recipe is perfect as is.  The packet of yeast translates to 2 1/4 teaspoons for those of us that use bulk yeast.  These were a hit at my children's baptism brunch as well as Thanksgiving dinner; very versatile, yummy rolls!

This came out wonderfully. I used almond milk and considerable less butter and sugar, and it still came out great! Next time, I might add a bit more sugar, but I can't complain about the taste at all.

I was reluctant to begin rolls so late in the day, but these mixed up and rose with ease.  I followed another reviewer's method because I don't have a bread machine and also did not have the time or energy to make them into crescents.  I just divided them up in to 16 equal balls before the last rise and baked them.  They came out fluffy on the inside and a beautiful color on the outside (I sprayed them with a water bottle halfway through baking). The only thing I would do differently next time is probably make 32 balls instead of 16 because these were pretty large when they were finished baking. Tasted great though.  Thanks for this recipe.  I will be making this again.

This recipe has made me the "Bread Queen" for our family and neighbors.  This was the beginning of my bread making, and it was so successful it gave me the confidence to venture out with bread making.  Got a Zojirushi bread machine for Christmas and barely a day goes by that I am not making some form of bread.  I now make all our bread, yes even the sandwich bread.  My recent triumph was sourdough bread and it all started with this no fail recipe.  Nothing smells sweeter or says 'welcome home" more than fresh bread baking.  Go ahead get the addiction .... but KEEEP EXERCISING!  LOL

This is a great recipe for cinnamon rolls, buns breadsticks, you name it.  I make with 2C all purpose flour, 1 3/4C wheat flour and added 1 TBLS vital wheat gluten and they come out great.  For cinnamon rolls I flatten out dough, cover with butter, top with brown sugar and cinnamon combined, roll, slice, let rise 45 min and bake at 350 for 25 minutes.

These are the best rolls ever!  I use a mix of whole wheat and regular flour - 1 3/4 cup wheat - 2 cup regular.  I make 16 round rolls instead of the crescents.  They come out great every time.

AMAZING CINNAMON ROLL DOUGH!!! I put this dough in the fridge overnight (after it had risen, I didn't use a bread machine) and used it to make cinnamon rolls the next day. I used brown sugar, cinnamon and butter on top of the strips of dough, rolled the dough up, put a pat of butter on top of each one, and put them in the oven for 7 minutes at 350 degrees. The BEST cinnamon rolls I've ever tasted that were homemade!!! Just like the ones from Cinnabon!! Try this if you get the chance!

I love this dinner roll recipe! My family also loved it so much that I decided to see how it would work for cinnomon and orange rolls. I make these rolls in my bread machine which I put on manual setting. When I make the sweet rolls I add three more teaspoons of sugar to the dough. When the dough is ready I finish them like you do any other sweet roll recipe. They come out yummy! They are light and fluffy with lots of taste. My grandsons told me they wanted to eat them at my house all the time. This will be the only recipe I will use for my rolls.

Wow! These rolls are super easy and fantastic. I made them exactly as the recipe says and they were wonderful. Everyone ate several and a few of the men ate a couple more after they were done with their dinner. This one is definitely a keeper!

Surpisingly the flavor was still here although I messed it up by using all whole wheat flour to make it healthy. This is a NO NO as it fell apart.

Excellent recipe!!!!  I made these for Christmas dinner and will definitely be making these again soon.  This is now my go-to recipe for homemade rolls.  I made these in my breadmaker on the dough cycle and followed the ingredients exactly.  When it was done in the breadmaker, I divided the dough into 16 balls, put them into a greased 9x13 glass baking dish, covered with a damp kitchen towel, and let them rise for about 2 hours while I finished up Christmas dinner.  I took the advice of some other raters and baked them at a lower temperature than the recipe calls for.  I baked them at 375 degrees for about 15 minutes or so.  The rolls were soft, fluffy, and delicious.  Very easy to make, yet very tasty!  Highly recommended!

Great Rolls!  I didnt have a bread maker or a Kitchen Aid appliance so I did it all by hand and it came out very well.  I activated my yeast with only slightly warm water and some of the sugar only and waited.  The reason why I mentioned this was because with all of the breads I made before I ususally kill my yeast.  Anyway I mixed everything together after the yeast was done activating and then kneeded the bread for about 8 minutes.  Then I let the bread rest for an hour which was when it doubled in size.  Afterward I formed 16 good sized rolles from this dough, put them inside an airtight container and froze them.  The next day I took the formed rolls from the freezer and placed them in the oven on a roasting pan with a dampened paper towel on top.  I let the rolls sit in the oven without it being on for two hours so it can unthaw and rise a second time.  Afterwards I buttered the rolls on top and baked them at 350 for 15mins or until brown on top.  They came out awesome!!!

made a double batch.  I was sure they were going to be dry because most roll recipes are rather sticky, but they were moist and sweet and yummy.  I have a dairy free home so I substituted soy milk for milk and no one notices.  This is my all time roll recipe from now on.  (I am formally a "hate to make rolls" mom of 9 kids.)  I would definately recommend the cresent roll shape as they are soooooo easy.

Bob loved them. Cooked great in 15 minutes. I made 12 but should have made 15 - some were too big. Cooked them in muffin pans because my 9x13 was not available. Try next time.

Thank you for posting this recipe.  Such an easy way to make cinnamon rolls as well as dinner rolls from just one batch .  A big hit with our whole family and my boys would only ever eat crescent rolls from Pilsbury

Made these for Thanksgiving and they were good! It was my first time making any kind of homemade bread and this was definitely the easiest recipe and tasted best. They came out flaky outside, and fluffy with a great taste inside. I don't have a bread machine so i followed advice given here in the comments on how to do it without one. I got 12 dinner rolls from one batch, since I also didn't make crescents from it but maybe someday. My oven made them over done at 400 degrees. I am glad I made them once beforehand to figure that one out. Baking at 350 for 17 minutes and they came out perfect. Making them again tonight to go with dinner.

I followed this recipe exactly, except I had to do it all by hand instead of a bread machine. I was a little disappointed. These tasted wonderful, but the texture wasnt very nice. I might try them again sometime, but for all the effort, they weren't worth it.

Easy! And soooo delicious! Rolls came out light & soft, great flavor & tender crumb.
I made a honey-cinnamon butter for these rolls: 1/2 C. softened butter, 1/4 C. honey & 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. Whip all together & serve with the rolls.

This recipe came out great.  I divided the dough into eight balls and made buns.  They came out beautiful.  They were kinda big though so next time I will divide them into 12.  I imagine they will be the size of regular hamburger buns then.

DELICIOUS!!!  I halved the recipe and did the following: in a small bowl, add 1 tsp plus 1/8 tsp yeast and 1 tsp of sugar. Heat water to 110F and add to yeast/sugar mixture. Let mixture proof for 10 minutes.  Melt butter in milk.  In bigger bowl add 1 and 3/4 flour, 2tbs plus 1 tsp sugar.  Mixed the wet with the dry ingredients.  Since I didn't have bread machine, I kneaded the dough for 8 minutes, oiled dough and put in bowl to rise for 1 hour.  After 1st rise, I punched the dough down, rolled dough into circle, brushed dough with butter,used pizza cutter to divide dough, rolled dough into crescents, dipped dough in butter and let dough rise for another hour.  Baked at 400F for 10 minutes.  Once finshed baking I brushed rolls with salted butter.  Eat immediately!

These are the best! I make them about 2-3 times a month, my go-to recipe for rolls.  These are great for special occasions, holiday dinners, etc.  I don't have a bread machine and I followed the instructions from K Praper.  They turned out perfect.

Wonderful rolls.  I made this in my breadmaker.  Put all of the ingredients in and put it on dough setting.  When it came out I formed the circles and rolled them up.  What an incredible treat!  My husband said "keep this recipe!"  They are very large when they baked up, but it didn't stop me from eating 3 of them myself!

This is the most reliable and versatile bread recipe; and you do not need a bread machine.  We use buttermilk in ours so we put buttermilk, butter and an egg (and garlic if we are making italian rolls) in a pot and put it on low on the stove top.  We combine half of the flour, all the salt and sugar (and our italian seasons if making italian rolls) in a bowl.  Then we put our water and a teaspoon of brown sugar in a measuring cup and warm it in the microwave until it reaches 110 degrees.  Then we add our yeast.  When the yeast has doubled we combine all the liquids with the flour mixture.  We start adding the rest of the flour a little at a time until the dough is just a little tacky.  We have a utility light that we use with our oven light to bring the oven temperature up to at least 100 degrees.  We grease a bowl and put the dough in and then flip the dough to coat it all.  We cover with a warm damp towel and let rise for an hour or until doubled.Then we separate and weigh the dough balls. We weigh ours at 25g and put 35 rolls to a pan.  We use a foil roasting pan because they do rise a lot.  We also just leave them in a ball shape.
We put them back in the oven to rise again for a hour or until doubled.  Then we take out our utility light and leave the rolls in the oven.  Turn the oven on to 350 degrees and start your timer for 20 minutes.  We have also made loaf bread with this recipe.  This recipe never fails.  Thank you for submitting, I will be making lots more.

Awesome! I made cloverleafs instead of crescents, and since I don't have a bread machine, I followed other reviews and used my Kitchenaid mixer. These are fantastic and I'll be making them often!

Wonderful dough recipe.  I wish I had just plopped it out of the bread maker and baked it... but I didn't.  I just had to try to KNEAD it.  It didn't like THAT a bit!  Don't try to knead it.  Just punch it, cut it, and let it rise again before baking.

Made for Easter lunch this year and much to my dismay, the dog jumped up on the counter and ate the dough while I showered for church!!!  They are so easy to make, so I was able to make a second batch in time in between services.  The kids ate more bread than anything else that day.  These were a hit with us and the animal!!!  :)

I LOVE this recipe!!!  I do have a bread machine which makes it easier on me.  The only things I do different: I use 1/2 cup butter (1 stick) only because I am too lazy to cut it down to 1/3. I typically form the dough into balls, place them in a muffin pan making each "muffin" out of 2 dough balls.  I do not butter the dough before it rises, instead I grease the pan.  I have found that they rise better for me without that extra butter.  I have also used 1 cup wheat flour in lieu of 1 of the cups on all-purpose flour.  This makes for an excellent wheat roll!  I don't suggest using bread flour for this recipe.  In my experience they don't come out as fluffy but if it's all you have, they will taste fine just will be a little heavy.

Excellent! This made 20 large light and airy crescent rolls. Everyone said these are to die for and with only 8 guests, they disappeared instantly.  Our family will be enjoying these again soon.

I'm giving these a 5 because they would have been better if I hadn't messed them up. It was Easter, so I was in the kitchen all day, cooking up a storm. When I pulled the dough out of the bread machine, I had intended to follow another user's suggestion and do cloverleaf rolls - 3 balls in each of 12 muffin cups. But, I wasn't thinking. I made 36 balls, and promptly put them in a bowl to rise for an hour. They rose into one another and formed a giant ball of dough once again. So, I made 36 news balls, plopped them into muffin cups, and baked, about 13 minutes. The balls melded into one another and I had regular rolls.

UPDATE: I made them correctly and they were FANTASTIC! everyone loved them and they rose wonderfully! I did have them covered with a towel for 2-2 1/2 hours instead of one (had to wait for that turkey to finish in the oven), but still fabulous.

I make these rolls for family holidays and the dough is so easy to work with! I follow the first reviewer's recommendations for making it without a bread machine. To save time I just make them into round rolls instead of rolling out as the instructions say. These are always a hit, especially with the kids.

The rolls were buttery, soft and light.  They are much too sweet for dinner rolls or even breakfast rolls.  I'm going to try them with 1/4 - 1/3 cup sugar in the recipe.  Also - I made 12 rolls from each half of dough - other than that they are fabulous.

Wow, this is absolutely delicious! Best rolls ever :) I substituted in whole wheat flour for all purpose flour, 1/4 cup of egg whites instead of an egg and unsweetened apple sauce instead of butter and these tasted delicious!

So easy, so perfect. I have been trying for years to rival my mother in laws recipe for these cresent rolls. I never could make mine turn out as good as hers, until I found this recipe! My husband said that they were amazing, which is a huge compliment compared to his mothers rolls! So this will be my recipe and she can keep hers. I also used this same recipe to make cinnamon rolls and they were out of this world delicious! Follow the recipe exactly and they come out amazing!

DELICIOUS! I made these into rolls in a round pan. Works best with 1/2 the recipe in an 8 in round. I added about 5 min to the baking time. I will DEFINITELY make these again!

The rolls turned out yummy. This was my first time making rolls from scratch. I found the dough to be a bit too sticky. I had to put it in the fridge for a couple hours before I could shape them.

Amazing! Dough is sticky and needs more flour, just watch it in the bread maker. Tastes awesome brushed with melted honey butter before baking, or shape into hamburger or hot dog buns. I love this recipe!

Excellent! I made these for my Christmas dinner.  Mixed the dough in the bread machine, then formed the rolls (not into crescents) and let rise. They were beautiful! Everyone bragged on them and there were none left to go with my leftover ham:( This is my new roll recipe!

My Mom and I make these all the time. Have been for years!  They are our family favorite.  We have our own recipe, but it's the same as this one.  We call them Butterhorn Rolls.   I made some of the dough into cinnamon rolls and put the gooey brown sugar stuff in the bottom of the pan, quicky sticky buns!  MMMMM

WOW! Someone said they ended up crumbly but if you knead them properly they will be the smoothest rolls you have ever eaten. No words can explain how absolutely delicious these rolls are. I also took the suggestion and used it as a base for cinnamon rolls also exquisite. Will be making again and again and again...

Don't cheat on this recipe! I cut half the rising time in hopes that they would rise more in the oven and I was wrong. Take your time and do it right, it will be worth it. I will be having great flavoured but dense golfballs with my dinner tonight.

I do not have a bread machine so I followed some of the recommendations in the reviews and made the dough in my stand mixer. I realized afterward that one of the suggestions included adding the butter into the warm milk/sugar mixture. It wasn't until it was all mixed that I realized the butter was supposed to go on the rolled out dough. I went ahead and buttered it before baking anyway. The rolls turned out delicious despite my mistake (I love butter anyway!). I brushed melted butter on the top after taking them out of the oven. They melt in your mouth and the texture was perfect! I did use bread flour instead of all purpose flour because I like the texture better for bread.   *I read a review that said it needed more flour. The dough was sticky coming out of the mixer but I let it rise in a bowl covered in olive oil and it turned out perfect and easy to handle. I would not recommend adding more flour (other than to roll it in). Just be patient with it.

These rolls were very good. I do not use a bread machine, and I reduced the amount of sugar to 2 teaspoons and I only used the in the yeast and water to feed the yeast.

FANTASTIC!!!  I don't have a bread machine, so I proofed the yeast in warm milk and water (and sugar), then added the yeast mixture to the (sifted) flour and salt.  I melted the 1/3 cup butter and added that to the dough.  Also, instead of crescents, I made dinner rolls.  After the first proof, I punched the dough down and made 12 dinner rolls, then smeared softened room temp butter on the tops and let them rise for another hour, then baked at 375 degrees for 20 min.... thanks so much for the recipe!!

Not only do I not bake, the mere thought of doing so nearly gives me an anxiety attack.  Yet Christmas this year found me working with a very small budget to create a very big meal, so I realized I had no choice but to make my own dinner rolls.  I don't own a breadmaker or even a stand mixer, so I had to do everything by hand (which is even more nerve-wracking considering my complete lack of experience with bread dough).  These turned out AMAZING!  Perfectly fluffy on the inside, tasty flavor, amazing smell as they're baking.  Even if you're as intimidated as I am about baking, you owe it to yourself to try this recipe at least once.

Wow! These remind me of those Hawaiian rolls I love so much. I started making these before I realized I ran out of regular butter so I used honey butter. I don't know if that changed the taste much but these were soooo good. I also brushed them with melted honey butter when I took them out of the oven for a picture-perfect sheen. Now if only I took a picture. Darn it. :) Make these, and try it with honey butter!

This was my 1st time making any kind of bread using yeast, other than pizza dough.  The reviews sounded like it was an easy one, so I tried it yesterday as a practice run for Xmas eve dinner.  I do NOT have a bread machine and used a variety of the tips here.  I let yeasst foam in warm milk, water and sugar for 10 minutes.  I then added melted butter and egg and slowly incorporated flour in my kitchenaid mixer.  Recipe said to knead for 8-10 minutes, but with the mixer it seemed like it was taking a beating so I only let it go for 2-3 minutes.  I let it rise for an hour.  Punched it down, formed 26- 2" balls and placed on cookie sheet and let rise another hour.  I thought I would get more rise, but didn't.  I brushed with melted butter and baked 12-13 minutes in my convection oven.  I brushed again with melted butter when done.  The flavor was outstanding.  I found them to be a little dense, but not unserveable.  Some other reviewers made similar comments.  I might try kneading by hand next time to see if they lighten up any.  I'm going to do whole wheat with some honey next time as well.  Yummy and easy overall!!

My family loved these rolls!  They were gone in minutes. Soft and sweet but not too sweet.

I will definitely make these again!  One recipe made 24 cloverleaf rolls for me.  I rolled 1" balls and placed 3 in each muffin tin.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe. I have used this twice for holidays meals with great success. The second time I froze them before the final rise so all I had to do was thaw and pop them in the oven the day of.

I don't have a bread maker so I had to modify process to work around that fact.  I read other reviews and followed their advice.  Been a long time since I worked with dry yeast but the rolls still came out fantastic!  I will diffenately make again.  Kids demolished a pan of 32 rolls.

These are so good and so easy! I hardly had enough self-control to stop at 5. I don't have a functional bread machine so I used my KitchenAid mixer and they came out great! They're better than my mother-in-law's!

This recipe is similiar to the one that came with my first bread machine years ago. The only difference is I switched the butter for Crocks brand honey butter. Instead having to roll it out, take dough and shape into 12 equal rolls on a greased pan and let rise for 30 min. After the 30 minutes take each ball and using hands and greased surface shape each into tesrdrop shape and roll. Looks like a crescent roll. Let rise 50 min and bake. This is a holiday treat for my family at Thanksgiving and Christmas.

I'm giving this recipe four stars for ease of preparation. Although the result is a smooth texture dinner roll, the reminded us of the pop-can rolls you buy in the refrigerated case at the grocery.

I made this with one cup of wheat flour substituted and without a bread maker. I shaped half the dough into croissants and half into biscuits. Both are very good.

Stands up to the reviews.  So easy, Pillsbury doesn't stand a chance.  The bread machine is one of those easily forgotten appliances that blows my mind every time I use it.  Kind of like a "duh" moment.   Please try these rolls you will not be disappointed!  The only thing that I made an adjustment on was the butter, I only used about 2 Tbsp on all of the rolls.

What a nice little recipe!  Used my bread machine, and like others, was a bit concerned about using non-machine yeast and flour.  But wowee- it made some darn good eating.   Nice soft, fluffy dough to work with and the baked roll....ahhhh.    Note:  I did think the crescents were too big (though a cheese stick stuck in one and microwaved a bit was just a little piece of heaven)so will make 12 per round rather than 8 next time.

Absolutely delicious! Like other members, I don't either have a breadmaker... so I had to improvise. First I dissolved the yeast and 1 tablespoon sugar in warm water and let sit until bubbly. While waiting for the yeast I heated the milk in a saucepan, and added the butter until it melted. After removing the pan from the flame, I waited for it to cool down and combined it with the egg and yeast mixture in a large mixing bowl. Then I stirred the flour in one cup at a time until all the flour was used. Finally, I kneaded the flour for 5 or so minutes on a lightly floured surface, and then put it in a bowl covered with a clean dishtowel, and set it aside in a warm place. After about 45 minutes I punched it down and separated it into two. I then rolled each out into 12 inch circles, brushed them with melted butter, cut each into 8 even triangles, and rolled them out from thick end to thin. After placing the rolls on an ungreased cookie sheet, I let them rise for another 45 minutes, and then baked them for 12 minutes at 400 degrees. ::kisses fingers:: PERFECTO.

Giving this 4* because it would be helpful if a proper step-by-step instruction is given for one not using a bread machine, BUT THE FLAVOR IS GREAT!!!
I made this using my KitchenAid mixer. I am new to making bread, and is still learning to effectively use yeast. 
For newbies, to proof the yeast, just add yeast to water and sugar -- nothing else. If not, it won't really rise enough. Also, I researched and read that one should add the flour to yeast mixture before adding salt because salt will kill the yeast. I am gonna try that again soon. Will update again.
But otherwise, the flavor is Great! Delicious -- even when the rolls haven't fully risen!!!!!!

OMG!!!  This is the best recipe I have come across.  For the past few months I have been trying recipe after recipe but just never quite got the rolls I was looking for.  They were either too dense or not sweet enough.  These bake up so light and so puffy with a great golden color and have that great sweet flavor I have been looking for.  I thought i was at Texas Roadhouse but only better! Making the dough in the bread machine made it a sinch and super fast!  These made the best rolls, My sweet roll recipe search is finally over!  They did make great cinnmon rolls too....thanks so much!

I love these rolls!  they are very easy to make too!  I put all of the liquid, (milk, water and egg included) sugar, salt and butter into a little sauce pan and heat it all to about 120-130 degrees (I mix it so everything disolves).  In my kitchen aide I put the flour and yeast and once the liquid is up to temp, I turn on my mixer (with the hook on it) and pour the liquid in!  Then all you have to do is let the mixer to it's job!  It takes about five minutes to make this wonderful dough!  My husband and boys love when I split the dough in half, roll it out, put peperoni and cheddar in it (like a pizza), roll it up and bake it as a long perperoni "log" (makes two "logs"), if you don't slit the dough it is too long to fit on a pan!  They eat it dipped in red sauce!
AWESOME DOUGH!

Took these to a company Thanksgiving dinner. Two batches disappeared, and several bags of store-bakery rolls were still in the plastic. I made mine with my kitchen-aid vice the bread machine. Pretty much follow the directions given but transfer to a greased bowl for the first rise.

These are one of the best Rolls I've ever tasted. Even better than some restaurants I've been to. I didn't change the recipe at all. I don't have a bread machine so I just prepared the water milk and sugar then warmed that to 110 degrees and added the yeast then let that set for 10 mins then added the rest of the ingredients and let that rise for about 45 mins to an hour then shaped and let rise for another  hour and baked as directed. YUMMY!!!

Just pulled these out of the oven.  Mmmm...and they taste wonderful.  This recipe will definately be a keeper.  It was so easy to make in the bread machine, and the dough was like rolling silk.  I baked these at 350, for 15 minutes.  I also brushed the tops with a bit of melted butter as soon as I took them out of the oven.

Delicious! This recipe is so simple, I've already memorized it! The bread turned out exactly as described; soft, light and sweet. I made rolls and added 3 tbsp of honey. I also followed previous reviewers suggestions on brushing a mixture of honey and butter on the rolls before and after baking. The result reminded me of the rolls served at a famous steakhouse too.

These rolls warm up nicely the next day in the microwave (10 seconds).

This is a great recipe.  I don't have a bread machine so I mix the warm water w/ the yeast first, let that develop and then add everything else.  I just mix it w/ a wooden spoon and then knead by hand.  

I like my rolls really sweet, so I add a couple of tablespoons of honey to the batter as well.  

Before I pop them into the oven, I brush the rolls w/ melted butter/honey mixture.  The rolls come out a little sticky, but they're yummy!!!

These were soooo good!  I didn't make them into crescents, I just rolled them into balls and got 20 beautiful rolls.  I brushed them with melted butter when I took them out of the oven.  I'm making them again tonight, this time as crescents.  They're beautiful!  Oh and, I don't have a bread machine.  I just mixed it in my bosch mixer and let them rise the first time for one hour.  Then proceeded with the recipe as normal.

This is why I have a bread machine. Wow, are they ever the best rolls, and I own Better Homes and Garden Bread Machine Cookbook, and one other, and this recipe is the best one I have. Nothing in either cookbook compares to this recipe. No longer going out and buying a dozen from a steak house, no need. These top any restaurant rolls I've ever had.

These are the best bread machine rolls ever!  I shape them into 12 balls and bake them, touching, in a 9x13 pan.  I brush them with (real) butter before and after baking and they always disappear within minutes.

OH MY GOD!!  These are THE best rolls ever.  I love the fact that you can dump all the ingredients into the bread machine and let it do all the hard work for you.  If you don't have a bread machine, definitely invest in one.  I rarely make a loaf of baked bread in my machine.  I use it for making the dough which takes all the hard work out of bread-making.  Now, back to the rolls:  These were awesome.  So soft and slightly sweet.  "Pillow-y" is the word that comes to mind.  I usually make another rolls recipe from this sight but this will now be my recipe of choice for rolls.  WOW, WOW, WOW!!

Very easy, the only thing I will change; Use 2 T. honey to replace sugar. To make wheat rolls, replace 1 cup flour with 1 cup whole wheat flour. Very good.

Taste great, easy prep!  I decided to update my review since I have made these about a million times and they always turn out perfectly. This is my no-fail recipe.  I volunteer to make rolls for every party with this recipe, partly because I want the credit, partly because I don't want to eat a less delicious roll than this!  Everyone who eats them says they are their FAVORITE ROLLS EVER!!!!  TRY it!

Excellent recipe.  I don't have a bread machine either, but the instructions that Charlene Thomas left in her review were just perfect.  My only variations were that I used a 375 degree oven (instead of 400) and parchment paper in my pan (because some reviews said that bottoms of rolls were burned).  I set my timer for 10 minutes and then added another 5 for perfection!  Also brushed the tops with egg and sprinkled with onion powder and chives.  My Dad, who is Mr. Breadmaker from scratch, was very impressed and kinda jealous, I think, too!

Bread rolls were great but not perfect.  They were easy to prepare.  But as far as taste goes, they were not as flavorful or sweet as the title suggests and are much better when they are hot. I split the dough in half and made crescents  (they should be called crescents rolls) with half and cinnamon rolls with cream cheese icing on the other half.  Both were great and were finished off by me and my husband with a day. My sugar level was not the best that day LOL.  Variations? cinnamon rolls with half cup sugar-1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 teaspoon allspice or cinnamon,  1/4 cup finely chopped nuts (pecans or walnuts) made into roll and sliced, let rise for half hour.  Follow roll recipe and spread basil pesto or sundried tomato pesto with in place of butter. follow roll recipe and fill with dried cheese like feta, kasar (kasari), parmesan chunk, with little parsley.  Follow roll recipe and fill with a chocolate chunk or jam when halfway cooked, if you add before cooking you may get spillage and burnt rolls.  if you prefer adding it with the bread before baking, then fill with a little chocolate or jam. Great rolls!

This is an excellent roll dough!  Very easy to work with.  You can shape it however you want, of course, and it would make great cinnamon rolls.  I bake a LOT of bread and my husband likes this recipe the best so far.  Great flavor.

These are fantastic rolls. Another reviewer said they tasted like the rolls at Lone Star steakhouses. I agree; they're about the closest you can come without the actual Lone Star recipe. Yum!

Since I discovered this recipe a few months ago, It's the only one I use for dinner rolls. This makes the lightest and best tasting butterhorn rolls I have ever made and they raise so big and fluffy. Have never tried this dough to make cinnamon rolls but I bet they would be excellent. This will be something I'll do for Mother's Day breakfast. The bread machine makes this so easy and I never have a problem rolling them out. WONDERFULL RECIPE!!!!!!!

I MADE HOMEMADE DINNER ROLLS AND THEY TURNED OUT!!!!  Sorry about shouting but after so many, many roll recipes I was throwing in the towel.  Then I tried this last one.  They are great!  Easy to prepare and yummy.  And they don't feel like rocks!  My husband still doesn't believe I made these.  I had to call my mother immediately.  Thanks for finally giving us a wonderful dinner roll!

These are VERY good.  I brought them to my neighbors for dinner, and they outshined the main course.  Their teenaged daughter begs me to make them, and everyone's faces light up when I walk through the door with them.

What a surprise!  There's a very popular restaurant near me that makes amazing rolls, so good that they have to limit the number you can have per meal unless they charge you extra.  These rolls were actually better than the ones from the restaurant.  My husband and kids could not say enough good about this recipe.  It is definitely a keeper!

My family loved these.  I divided the dough in two and used half for dinner rolls and the other half for cinnamon rolls for breakfast the next morning.  My husband, a cinnamon roll fanatic, loves these!  He told me this recipe was a "KEEPER!"

This makes a great pepperoni roll. Rolled out, sprinkled cheese on, added pepperoni, rolled them up, put them on the tray and covered for 20 minutes. Baked for 375 for 13-15 minutes. Perfection. Love. Old pepperoni roll recipe was too dense. This is perfect. I am not a cook. I got my first C in Home Ec. class. This is totally doable and delicious! Thanks!

I give this 5 stars because my family gobbled them up but they are too sweet for my taste....I even cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup as the title "sweet" dinner rolls was a bit of a give away. Don't get me wrong, they are very good; next time I'll cut the sugar even more. If I were making cinnamon buns, on the other hand, the sugar content would be perfect at 1/4 cup. No bread machine either, let rise twice before baking.

Terrific! I followed the recipe exactly, except my butter was warmed to mush. My bread maker doesn't have a rise cycle, but I left the dough in it until it doubled. 
By then the kitchen was busy, so I sliced the dough with a pizza cutter, rounded off a dozen larger pieces and put them in a muffin tin, snipped off a bunch of smaller pieces and put them 3 - 4 in another muffin tin. I smeared some butter on them, put a towel over them, and let them rise again. The actual rolls rose better than the snipped pieces, but that may have been my impatience. 
The rolls cooked for 12 minutes, the "snippets" for 11. I brushed the finished rolls with butter. I came out with 21 rolls that everyone loved and a new family favorite.

Love these. So does my wife. I don't use my bread maker. I mix the water, yeast and milk in a bowl. Allow to work. Then I add the salt, egg and about a 1/4 cup of honey. I mix that and add the flour. I do use bread flour, not AP. After it rises, I make it into rolls and put it on a cookie sheet to finish rising. When they come out I brush the tops with melted butter.

Made this many times and it is, by far, my family's favorite!  I don't use a bread machine - just warm milk/water/melt butter and then add yeast and let dissolve, pour into the Kitchen Aid mixer and add dry ingredients.  One rise for about an hour or so, then make simple rolls and let rise another 1/2 hr or so.  Bake and then cover with melted butter.  AMAZING!

This is the first dinner roll recipe I've made that didn't turn out flat! I followed the recipe exactly except I used Red Star instant rise yeast (about 80% of what was called for) and it turned out beautifully. 

I did make the crescents, and honestly, they are so easy to make. (just watch the video) It's really just as easy as making them into balls. 

My family was so excited because I try to make dinner rolls every once in a while, and they almost inevitably turn out flat (and/or hard) These were (according to my husband) "as good as O'Charley's" (which is the gold standard of dinner rolls in my house. I am basking in yummy dinner roll glory. (although it did throw me off my diet!)

Tks for this great recipe, just tried it today and the rolls were so soft and aromatic. And I did put in some filling and also made some into cinnamon  rolls. Came out lovely just like Cinnabons. I didn't use my bread maker to mix the dough but just regular mixer and still the dough was really soft to the touch  minus the extra tackiness  of the other recipes I tried. And I didn't even have to use much flour to knead before prooving it. This is for keeps for sure!!!

I was BLOWN AWAY by how easy and delicious this recipe is! They were pillowy soft, deliciously chewy, a nice, neutral flavor, and didn't require me to knead that much at all. I made these without a bread machine following the instructions of the top comment, and like her I made clover rolls instead of crescents. I softened the butter in a rush by putting it on the defrost setting in the microwave for 20 seconds. 10 minutes in an oven at 375 degrees was perfect.

So tasty! I don't have a bread machine, so I followed K Praper's directions for the prep, and they turned out great! The rolls themselves were so perfect. The only changes I made (which didn't have an effect on the rolls themselves) were that I rolled ham and swiss in them before setting them to rise the second time and brushed the tops of them with a mixture of 1T spicy mustard, 4-6T butter, 1T poppy seeds, and 3-4T chopped onion before putting them in the oven. SO GOOD! For those of you who had crumbly rolls, that is often an issue with how they were prepared rather than with the ingredients. Not kneading them enough, using poor quality flour, or even letting them rise for too long, can lead to crumbly bread.

These rolls are phenomenal. I first made these 2 years ago when I hosted my first Thanksgiving and they were the only thing we didn't have leftovers of. I now make this recipe frequently with regular dinners. What's great about it is that it doesn't have to be pigeon-holed into rolls. Don't have the time to go through the extra steps of making rolls? Just throw it in your bread machine on a regular bread cycle and it makes a delicious loaf of bread as well. I honestly have made it so many times that way my family forgot that it's actually a roll recipe. I don't change anything about the recipe at all.

I have made these a few times.  After proofing the yeast in the water with a pinch of sugar I add the yeast and all the other ingredients, except the flour and salt, into my Kitchenaid with the paddle.  Then I add the salt and 3 cups of flour. When it gets thick, I switch to the dough hook and add the rest of the flour just until the dough pulls off the bottom of the bowl. The mixer kneads the dough for about 5 minutes and I simply move the dough to a cutting board, make round rolls and place them on a greased sheet tray. The last time I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and used half a large cake of fresh yeast.   If you make all dinner sized rolls, it will make 24 good sized round rolls. This time I made 12 dinner rolls and 4 the size of hamburger buns.  I baked at 375ºF. The dinner rolls took 12 minutes and the hamburger buns took 16 minutes... both were golden and beautiful.  I will be using the buns for pulled pork sandwiches.   
Since the only rising time really needed is after the rolls are formed, it is one of the fastest, tastiest, and almost foolproof recipes I have found.  You can easily make them start to finish in 2 hours because they only need to rise once.  Very easy to change it up with less sugar, some finely minced garlic and bits of fresh rosemary too.  You just can't go wrong with these!

These were so good and super easy! No bread machine in this household, nor do I have a fancy Kitchen Aid mixer.  Used a reviewers suggestions to micro the milk and water, add the sugar, then yeast, let sit, mixed all that with a spoon.  Adding the egg, butter and salt, used a regular mixer. Added flour gradually mixing with mixer as well. Let rise for 45 minutes after gently kneading, covering with warm towel. After punching down, pulled about 20 'ball's and put into 2 greased pie plates, spaced apart. Let rise a second time for an hour. Baked at 400 aproximately 10 minutes. So worth it! Thanks for the great recipe!

I make this recipe into a loaf of bread in my bread maker...yummm.  It stay's soft and moist with proper storage for at least 4 days.  If there were more of us in the family I'm sure it wouldn't last 4 days!  I have a 2 pound bread maker and it raises to the very top, so if you have a smaller bread maker you probably need to half or 3/4 the recipe.  I make no adjustments the recipe is great as is.  The only downside it that I haven't experimented on making too many different breads because this one is so good!  See my pictures too.

These rolls are just okay. They actually reminded me of soft pretzels from one of the recipes I found on here. They were sweet and buttery, but they really weren't fantastic.

I'd give this recipe 10 stars if I could.   THANK YOU DONNA!!

I cut the recipe in half since there are only two of us at home; I made the dough in my bread machine (dough cycle).  I rolled the dough into 9 balls and placed them in a greased large pie plate and let them rise for an hour.   I baked them for 25 minutes in a 350 oven; brushed the tops of the rolls with butter and let them cool.   My DH ate 4 of them before dinner.   

The rolls are soft and YUMMY!!!   These are the best rolls I've ever made; this will be my new 'go to recipe'.

Simply delicious.. Added 1/8 cup brown sugar and used olive oil in place of butter  never mind the sticky dough it won't be so sticky after first rise don't have bread maker but still came out great. Use as cinnamon rolls as well it's my go to for breakfast buns or bread.

These were really tender and flaky, with a nice sweetish buttery flavor. They were a big hit with my family. My picky toddler even ate his green beans in order to get a second one! 
I don't have a bread machine, so I did it in my KitchenAid. I heated up the milk and water in the microwave for a little over a minute, then I put it in my KitchenAid bowl and mixed in the sugar, then the yeast and let it proof 10 minutes. I added the flour a half cup at a time, and it was really sticky so I needed to add an additional 1/2 cup of flour. I kneaded it with the dough-hook for 10 minutes, then let it rise covered in the bowl for 45 min. I then proceeded with the recipe as written,. though I baked them at 375 for 15 minutes. Next time I'll pull them out about 2 minutes earlier than that. 
I'll be adding this to my regular dinner rotation! Thanks for the recipe.

I've made several white or whole wheat bun and bread recipes and my wife simply said, "Put a star on this, it's the best bread you've ever made."

Like some others, I made it the traditional way using a mixer and formed them into 16 round dinner rolls, leaving out the additional 1/4 cup of butter.

These are wonderful!  I use 100% whole wheat (freshly ground) and they still turn out amazing!  Though I do add a bit more milk because the whole wheat can make it a bit more dry.  This recipe also yields a delicious LOAF of bread!  Holds up to cutting well and I can slice it pretty thin, which is a major bonus when trying to make sandwiches.  :)  THANK YOU!  (I also cut the sugar back by about 50% and use Sucanat, Rapadura, or Honey instead)

Very good. Very versatile. My family looooves these. I have enven made this bread as a loaf. I don't think its sweet enough to make as cinnamom rolls though. You'll need more sugar for that...very good dinner rolls

Lordy- I can't believe I just baked these up.  Unbelievable- here's what I did since I don't have a bread machine: I mixed 2 1/2 teaspoons yeast, 1/2 warm water and 1 teaspoon sugar. Stir once and left for 6 minutes to proof in warm oven.  Using my Kitchen Aid mixer, I added all of the wet ingredients, then added the proofed yeast and 1 cup of flour at a time, kneading slowly with the dough hook for about 6 minutes total.  I removed the dough, oild the mixer bowl and put it back in, covered the bowl and let it rise for 1 hour 40 minutes.  I then punched the dough down, made 16 balls and placed them in a parchment-lined 9x13 glass dish.  I covered with cling wrap that I sprayed with oil so it didn't stick to the rolls and let it rise for 40 minutes.  I removed the wrap, placed in preheated oven at 350 degrees for 13 minutes.  I did not use the additional 1/4 butter to brush them- I left them alone.  Excellent recipe.  Thanks a million, Donna.

Great for cinnamon buns!  I found the dough a little dry so added 1/4 cup more warm milk.  I will be using this one again.

YUM!!! New favorite at our house.  I don't use a bread machine just let the dough rise the old fashion way.  I freeze them after I roll them into crescents then pull them out and bake 2 or 3 at a time.  My family can't get enough.

I will have to try to make these again.  I'm not sure what I did wrong, but these flattened out when i put them in the oven :(  Everything I used was new and fresh, so I'm not sure what could have possibly caused that.  The taste was good, but obviously because they ended up flat, they were also more dense than I thought.  For right now I'm giving this a 3, because that's middle ground.  I'll revisit this recipe again and try again and maybe re-rate it then :)

Amazing rolls, I only use 3 cups of flower. 3.75 cups makes them more heavy and dense then I prefer. I also make them by hand because I like the satisfaction of doing things myself. I've made these 6 times now and they always go fast, I've given to friends and always get asked for the recipe.

I surprised myself, never have baked any kind of bread before and these came out perfect! I put everything into my mixer, let it rise about 45 mins then rolled it out and made them into buns instead of crescents. Cant wait to try these agaiN!

I have used this recipe often... for holiday meals, every day meals, and pitch-in dinners.  They are a hit every single time.  I am often requested to make these rolls.  They are just the right sweetness-not quite as sweet as Hawaiin dinner rolls.  The only difference I have ever done is to make them into round rolls, not crescents.  When I do that I do not add the extra butter on top-and they turn out nice and brown and still very tasty.  Also, I do not always make th 16 rolls it calls for out of one recipe, I often make anywhere from 24-32 rolls with this recipe.  A great recipe to have for any time dinner rolls are needed (or wanted)!

I used a little less than half whole wheat flour and made them into buns instead and they are great! Very homely tasting. I put some eggwash on top to give it a little glazed look. Also, I let it rise once and shaped them into small balls, placed them in a round pan, cover them with plastic wrap and placed it in the fridge to rise overnight. great results.

My sister in law made these sweet rolls on Christmas day. They came out so big and fluffy and were delicious. The rolls were so good that we actually raised a glass of egg nog and toasted Donna West. I'm not kidding... we really did that.

Just as the recipe said, sweet, soft and fluffy.  EXCELLENT!!!  Perfect for turkey sandwiches the next day.  I made them the night before, then warmed in the warming tray right before the big feast.

I have used this recipe so many times.  Its fool proof in my bread machine!  Received so many complements on Thanksgiving and Christmas.  I will never buy store bought rolls again!  I have even been in a hurry and have skipped the rise time after taking them out of the bread machine and they are still perfect!  It's a keeper :)

Very good. Made honey butter to go with them. I think I may add a tad more sugar to them next time, so that they are a little sweeter, and I'm going to brush the tops with honey butter while the rolls are rising again. I used these to make clover leaf rolls.

I have tried alot of roll recipes and this one is really good. I have not really used my bread machine for years but this was so simple and really cut down on the mess.  So from now on the first rising will be in the machine.  I used an insulated baking sheet so the bottom didn't cook as fast as the top but they were terrific.  Thanks, Donna

These were great,so light and fluffy! Instead of crescents,i formed the dough into balls,rolled them in melted butter,then let them rise for an hour in 2 round baking pans. My first batch made 23 rolls,and the second made 27. I baked them at 350 for about 15 minutes. They were a hit at Thanksgiving. Home made bread is so much better than store bought. I also put my milk,butter and water together in a measuring cup and nuked it for a minute and 15 seconds before adding it to the bread machine.

These were a big hit at our Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone wanted seconds! I don't have a bread maker so I warmed the milk and water in the microwave for 1 minute 15. Added the yeast. Waited 10 minutes then added everything else (flour 1/2 cup by 1/2 cup) and mixed it all together. Let it sit for like an hour and then punched it down and rolled into 18 rolls. Delicious!

They were good rolls, but mine turned out HUGE.  I would almost cut the circles into 12 or 16 wedges and then roll up.  The next time I try it I might do balls and make traditional rolls instead.  The flavor was good, but I expected a sweeter taste.  Very easy to make though.

Maybe it was our weather but mine did not rise well and the bottoms were black at that high of a temperature. Next time I will bake at 350.

These are REALLY good! And I also have tried this dough for cinnamon rolls. Delicious! These rolls are so tender and light and scrumptious! They were not overly sweet at all. Just right! So good w/ some butter on them hot out of the oven ;)

THE BEST rolls!! I followed the recipe exactly with my bread machine.  The dough consistency was perfect.  Rather than making them into crescent rolls, I placed 16 rolled balls into two round cake pans that were sprayed with Pam.  Before baking I brushed the tops with just a little melted butter.  I might try tweaking them just for fun next time to come up with the rolls Texas Roadhouse makes.  The aroma, texture, and flavor of these rolls is amazing.

I bake bread and rolls very frequently and I must say I am very impressed with this recipe.  I made my dough with 1/3 of the flour whole wheat and added an extra rise.  This dough is so easy to work with and bakes up light and flavorful.  I was a bit concerned they may be too sweet but they are perfect.  I made half the dough into dinner rolls and half into a coffee cake with an almond filling.  The dough is so versatile, use your imagination and have fun.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These were the first rolls I've ever made from scratch that turned out!  They were very good - slightly sweet and fluffy.  I rolled the dough into 12 balls and put them in a glass 13x9 pan.  They all ended up baking together so I had to cut squares out for rolls.  Next time I will bake in two pans so they remain in balls, but either way the flavor was great!

I made this by hand as well.  Kneaded 10 minutes.  Ratio of ingredients was just fine.  I used it to make 9 dinner rolls in a pie plate, and 10 roll-up cinnamon rolls in an 8x11.  Mad a 15" roll, and cut into 1 1/2" slices.  Used the filling recipe from the Cinnabon Clone recipe--mixed teh sugar, butter and cinnamon together and spread it on the dough.  The cinnamon rolls turned out GREAT.  FANTASTIC.  The dinner rolls just OK, and I may have baked them about 3 minutes too long.  I reduced the baking temp of everything to 375.  I think this is a much better recipe for "formed" type rolls, as in the picture, or the cinnamon rolls, but just the balls of dough turned out tough.  I will save to use as my cinnamon roll recipe.

I already wrote my review and had to come back and edit it. These are the best rolls my husband and I have EVER had. They are a 50/50 cross between a light, fluffy dinner roll and a croissant. These will be at every special occasion from now on. Such a sense of accomplishment making these. Thank you Donna for posting this recipe.  Below is my first review.

These are amazing! So light and fluffy. I made them the traditional way by following other people's instructions. They rose so nicely. Turned out picture perfect and tasted as good as they looked!

This is my first ever review, although I've tried  several hundred recipes from this site.  I am absolutely compelled to write this, because these rolls are simply unsurpassed!  Light as air, and super delish in every way.  They couldn't be easier, too, with the use of your bread machine.  Thank you so much for sharing.  I will be using this recipe for years to come!

I love this dough recipe! I first made it for rolls for Thanksgiving, now I have made rolls, bread, cinnamon rolls, and pizza dough all from the same recipe. I use 2 c. white flour and 2c. wheat flour. Thanks!

I made on a winters evening in Kwazulu-Natal (3 degrees Celsius very dry conditions, using a convectional oven to raise the dough at 40 degrees Celsius.
I also increased the salt to 1.5 teaspoons. It came out excellent. 
I also spread cinnamon sugar over the butter before I rolled it on half the dough to test. It came out very well.
What a wonderful recipe!

These are the best rolls I have ever made! I made some croissants and some basic dinner rolls and they were equally delicious. I can imagine this recipe would make a good base for cinnamon rolls as well. If these didn't work for you the first time, I would suggest trying again! They are definitely worth it!

My aunt has always made yummy dinner rolls but never would share her recipe and I know this is it!  They are so  yummy I am so glad I found this.  However, I found that the butter was to much for me, while my rolls were rising the butter leaked out the sides causing them to burn on the bottom.  Next time I'll just use less butter.  And oh yes, there will be a next time!

Superb!!! Love this! I didn't use water but used a whole cup of warm milk to proof the yeast as I made it the old fashion way. Made 16 wonderful rolls with cream fillings. The only problem I had was with the baking temp/time. I had to bake at 190C for 25min for a soft and fluffy bread with beautiful golden crust.

Easy recipe that turns out perfect every time! I made 10 batches of rolls using this recipe for a Spring Bazaar and they were a hot seller.  I divided up each batch into 24 round rolls and just brushed the tops with butter before baking.  Everyone that sampled them raved about how good they were.

I absolutely love this recipe, and I intend to make it whenever I get the craving for homemade bread.
I, like many of the other reviewers, modified this recipe somewhat. I do not have a breadmaker, so I mixed and kneaded the dough in my stand mixer. 
In addition, I made some other changes: I increased the recipe by 1.5 to make 24 rolls instead of 16, although I still only used one packet of yeast and just let it rise a little longer.  To help the yeast rise the additional dough, I substituted 2/3 cup of flour for potato flakes (which yeast love).  The resulting rolls were absolutely perfect!
I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could!!

I consider myself a novice baker and never cared much for bread made in the breadmachine.  Well I dusted off the bread machine to try these and they are the best.  I made them into dinner rolls added some fresh rosemary to the dough and served as sliders for a superbowl party and the rolls freeze beautifully, an instant hit....

Finally ... a roll recipe that produces soft delicious rolls.

I used 2 1/2 teaspoons rapid rise yeast -- proofed in warmed water, and added a little extra flour (about 1/8 cup) after kneading for a few minutes,  to get the smooth consistency needed.

I made crescent shaped rolls with half the dough, and even though I didn't do a great job of making them a uniform size - some were at least 25% larger than others - they still baked up nicely in a 375° F oven.

I'll probably try cloverleaf with the rest of the dough.  Although I'm tempted to make some pigs in blanket with the rest in the morning.

Thanks for the great recipe.

I have never been able to make good bread of any kind before, so let me tell you, it is just a great feeling to actually be able to produce rolls that are so wonderful.  These are just fantastic--and easy enough for a novice like me.  

I didn't want to lug out the breadmaker, so I followed some of the suggestions from other ladies who made these babies by hand.  Then I just rolled the dough into little balls (with my history in breadmaking, I wasn't willing to invest too much time).  The balls puffed up like big beautiful bubbles--so cute!  I'm delighted to finally have a go-to dinner roll recipe for family gatherings.  And I can't wait to try the cinnamon rolls... Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Oh My Yum!  Made to go with Ham 'n Green Beans last night and they were great. The perfect hint of sweetness that made them extra special. The butter did amazing things to the texture of the inside of the roll.  I let them raise a bit too much and they kind of exploded. Tasted great though.  I had trouble rolling them out big enough and ended up stretching by hand.  Used a pizza cutter for even pieces.  I didn't care for the texture on the outside much...too much flour from the rolling out process.  User error, I'm sure.  I've got a batch raising as "regular" rolls and will egg wash them before baking.  I'll let you know how it turns out.  Keeper for sure though!

Very light with a hint of sweetness, works well with instant yeast. Makes about 28 almost palm sized dinner buns. Remember to place them 2 inches apart before rising and bake in the same pan.

Super good. Surprised it didn't rise more but then the rolls rose while baking so the wait times weren't critical. It's become a regular request from my entire extended and immediate family to bake. Love it!

I love these crescent rolls.  I added some parmesan and rosemary prior to rolling into crescents and and they turned out fantastic!

These are great rolls.  They are very sweet.  I have used this recipe repeatedly for my orange rolls recipe.  The family loves them.  Very tender roll.

Awesome dinner rolls!!!!!  Made them for Chrismas and what a hit!!!  They are light, fluffy, and buttery!!!.  I froze them the week before individualy.  Defrosted on the counter for an hour then popped them in the oven on Chrismas for 10 min at 350 still wrapped.  They tasted the same as when I originally poppled them out of the oven.  The next morning I even took one out of the tin foil, popped in Microwave for 20 secons and YYYUUUMMM  Still fluffy and soft!!!!

These were amazing! I didn't roll them up tight enough but their taste was phenominal!!! Even my husband who NEVER says anything other then "yea, it's good" said "Wow! That's awesome!" He eats alot of food so that is saying something I guess LOL Thanks for the recipe Donna.. definately a keeper. Next time tho, think I'm going to make these into regular ole dinner roll shapes instead of the crescent shape. Probably get double the amount too.

I've been using this recipe for several years now and the rolls always turn out great.  My family looks forward to them each holiday!  To make my rolls even softer, I let the dough rest in the bread machine when the cycle completes for about an hour, roll them out, and let them rise for another 2 or 3 hours (if time allows).  You can also make them and roll them out a day ahead of time, wrap them tight with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight.  Amazing recipe that could not be any easier!

Oh my word these were amazing.  I don't have a bread machine, but followed some of the other reviews for making the old fashioned way and I was very impressed with the outcome.  I froze half of them and plan to make another batch for thanksgiving.  I will definitely be keeping this recipe for whenever I need any type of bread.  I want to play with the dough even more to make crossiants, different shapes and try flavoring it with herbs.

I used 1/2C evaporated milk because I had some to use up in my fridge, and subbed 3/4C of whole wheat flour for 3/4 cup white flour.  Also, I ommited the extra 1/4C butter and made 16 round rolls instead.  Baked in 2 8" round cake pans at 350 for 12 minutes.  Dough was very easy to work with, came out great!

Great recipe, extremely easy! My first time making rolls and it was easy! I let both batches rise on the counter covered, one on a cookie sheet and the other on a flat board and didn't realize you can't transfer after they rise because then they collapse. So, I had one amazing puffy batch of rolls and one that were good but lacking the fluffiness. So first time bread makers, no transferring after the bread rises :) Tasted great!

These rolls are "Get in My Belly" delicious!  And so much fun to make.  I wasn't sure how long to leave the dough in my breadmachine, but whatever I did worked well.  I followed Annabellee's advice to cut her dough into 36-inch pieces and place 3 pieces into each cup of a 12-cup muffin tin.  After rising for about an hour, I brushed melted butter on top of each roll and sprinkled half with poppy seeds and half with sesame seeds before popping them into the oven.  (I sprayed each muffin cup with cooking spray first, and there was absolutely no problem getting the rolls out.)  Served with beef stew -- perfect for a fall evening.

Best rolls that I have been able to make. Although i don't have a bread maker, I followed the ingredient list exactly. Initially, i felt the need for more flour. This made the rolls dense and tough. Trust that the ingredients proportions are correct and it'll come out great!

I wanted something easy to make with leftovers and this fit the bill. I made half into rolls and the other half as instructed but made with leftover garlic butter. Not all of us are garlic lovers lol. Both baked up real nice and tasted great. Thank you. This goes into the keeper book!

This is by far one of the best rolls I can possibly imagine. I'm going to try to make this as cinnamon rolls since some of the "clone" recipes aren't all that great. As a dinner roll this is just sweet enough, just soft enough on the inside and just crusty enough on the outside. This recipe is virtually bullet proof. Every time I've failed with it - I was clearly at fault and I could trace my failure. This is one of those recipes where you're better off with the freshest ingredients - good quality butter, fresh milk and eggs - because it's the difference between stupendous rolls and just great ones.

This recipe was easy to make and delicious! I made 8 dinner rolls and 12 cinnamon rolls, just to try out both versions. Both turned out great. Dinner rolls only took about 8 minutes at 375; cinnamon rolls took about 18 minutes. Will definitely make again!

great recipe    I make the standard bread baking (no machine) modifications by letting the warmed milk, water and sugar sit in the bowl with the yeast for about 12 minutes before I add the egg and splash of vanilla.

Surprisingly easy and SO yummy!  The only change I made was to sub splenda for the sugar. I made them into rolls and baked at 400 for twenty min.  Will be making these a lot!

Fabulous! I didn't use an egg, and I used Earth Balance vegan butter, and Silk soy milk, and I cut the sugar by 1/2. I brought a double recipe to our family's annual Easter potluck, and they positively disappeared! Definitely sweet enough for dinner rolls if you halve the sugar, though.

Really excellent crescent rolls! We are asked to bring these with us to dinner gatherings, too! We use the 2lb. setting for dough cycle, and  2 1/4 tsp of bread machine yeast.

What a great recipe! I have had problems in the past with my rolls staying soft after they cool...but not this recipe! The rolls are perfect, and extremely delicious. I used half bread flour, which helped a bit with the texture...but other than that, made these exactly as written. The one issue I had was with the size...the finished rolls are HUGE. In my opinion, a dinner roll should be a small addition, not an entire meal :) Although these rolls are so good, that I don't think anyone will mind! Next time I make them, however, I'm going to divide the dough into three parts instead of two, and roll it out to 1/4" thickness. I think that this size will be nicer. Thanks for sharing this recipe...it is a winner!!!

Awesome recipe!!!! Thank you so much for sharing with us!! So versatile and yummy! I just found this recipe a few days ago and have made it 3 times. The first 2 times, I halved the recipe for small dinner rolls and the 2nd time for larger rolls to be used for lunches.  With the rolls for lunch, I sauted onions and put on top as they were rising the second time.  Turned out wonderful! Tonight, I shaped into  oblong rolls for oktoberfest sausages, again-wonderful. So easy to make, foolproof and delicious. I didn't use the 1/4 cup butter, and we didn't miss it at all. I highly recommend buying a bread machine if able, I bought mine at a yard sale for $5 and I use it so much, I bought another at  a different yard sale to use at our trailer. I will definitely be using this recipe at our trailer for lots of bbqs and trying many variations!  I would rate this as 10+ stars if able!!!! Thanks again for sharing!

I've been using this awesome and versatile recipe for years!  It makes a killer sweet roll, a scrumptious cinnamon roll, and it can even make a wicked savory roll with the addition of some fresh garlic and herbs.  Being something of a butter fiend, I've always found this rich, moist bread to be perfectly satisfying!

Very yummy!  I do not own a bread machine, but have made enough pizza dough, so just mixed together the water, milk, sugar and yeast and let proof 10-15 mins.  Then added my egg, salt, butter and flour (bit at a time).  I decided to roll little balls of dough and bake in pie pans...ended up with 27 (9 per pie pan).  Baked at 350 for about 15 mins.  I was expecting a lighter more airy dinner roll, but as others mentioned, these were a bit more dense, but not in a bad way, just different than I expected.  Regardless, they were still great!

These were very easy, fun even, to work with. I followed the recipe exactly but used half whole wheat flour. I got more than 8 rolls per blob of dough. I saved half overnight in the fridge an found that dough when set our for a couples hours an still slightly chilled to be easier to cut. O an I used a lil plastic cup as my cutter. GREAT RECIPE!!! They dissapeared both nights with [[delicious]] haste. THANKS FOR SHARING!! P.S. Instead of butter I brushed the unbaked rolls with egg white

I LOVE this recipe and so does everyone I've ever made it for. I make the dough in my bread machine exactly as written. Then divide it into a dozen pieces, roll them into balls, place them in a butter greased dish, and brush melted butter on top.  Perfection!!  I've also substituted margarine when I was out of butter and they were still just as delicious.

Very good and pretty easy! A bit hit with my whole family! Great with soup, etc. For cinnamon roll dough I switch out brown sugar for the white and add a tsp of vanilla to the dough as well. mmmm

These were really good and easy to make.  To make it even easier, I did not even roll out the dough.  I just buttered my hands and pinched off balls of dough, placed them into a muffin pan, let them rise 1 hour and baked for 12 minutes.  This is my new favorite dinner roll.  Thanks for the recipe.

These are the best! I made them in the clover leaf style someone else suggested, and they were not only really really yummy, but also pretty! I put honey butter on them!  Also- the suggestion to use 2 and 1/2 tsp. for bread machine yeast was exactly right! On my breadmaker- I used the pizza dough/dough cycle for a 2 lb. loaf, and it took about 1 hr and 40 minutes.

these were heavenly!  I've made these several times.  I have always made them as rolls and not as cresents.  The first few times I didn't put butter in them before forming as rolls.  For Thanksgiving I put butter in them and then formed a ball.  Let them rise per the directions, then baked.  When I removed them from the oven I rubbed cold butter on the top so it would melt a bit.  I made 4 batches of these and my rolls were gone before anything else at the table!  Make sure you put butter in there for the second rising, it make a huge difference!  Also, I didn't have a bread machine, so when I mix the butter and egg into the dough I have to use a hand mixer or it'll never get incorporated enough.  Other people have commented on how to proof the dough, etc in other reviews so I won't go into that in here.  Thanks for the recipe Donna!

Brilliant and fool proof!  I literally made these while I was busy making dinner (as a test for Thanksgiving.)  Didn't want to spend much time on them so after proofing the yeast/milk/water/sugar I mixed/kneaded that with the rest of the ingredients in my KitchenAid, let it rise for about 45 minutes.  Rolled into balls and tossed into PAM sprayed, pyrex pie plates.  Let them rise for an hour, brushed with melted butter and baked.  Great results.  Seems like everyone has a different temp/time for these.  Use an oven thermometer set to 400 and keep an eye on them.  Mine took about 18 minutes.

This is an awesome recipe! My first time making bread by hand that turned out delicious. I dont have a bread maker so this is what I did - I combined the yeast and milk, combined the other ingredients and sifted the flour before adding it. I let the dough rise over the heat of the warming oven. I then rolled out a portion of the dough, buttered it and formed dough balls to rise over the oven. With the other half of the dough I made cinnamon rolls. My husband said that the rolls were better than cinnabon! Thank you for this recipe!

These are outstanding as the recipe is written but are also versatile.  I've found I can refrigerate after the first rise and put on hold for up to three days.  It takes about 3 hours to let them rise again on the counter.  Makes it easy for dinner parties.

These were really... REALLY good! I followed the recipe exactly but made it by hand.. I have a bread machine but I like kneading it b/c I get a better feel for when the dough is ready and for how much flour to use that way. I mixed 3 cups of the flour in my mixture and the last cup I used to knead the dough in..I kept kneading till the dough wasn't sticky anymore. (about 7 mins) I probably ended up using alittle more than the 3 3/4 cups of flour doing it that way but it still came out perfect. And I took others advice and put 3 small balls in a muffin tin, let it rise and baked it like that and the rolls were BEAUTIFUL! All the kids loved them and told me to make them like that from now on.  THANK YOU!

These never fail to make absolutely delicious dinner rolls that receive many compliments.  I do the proofing/dough process by hand and let the dough rise for 1 hour in each rise cycle.  I use whole wheat flour for 1-3/4 cups of the flour amount.  I have tried the rolls both by rolling the dough out flat and rolling up, and simply dividing the dough into pieces and allowing to rise.  The rolls are far superior (extra light and flaky) with the extra few minutes to roll the dough flat.  I make 16 rolls - divide the dough into four pieces, rolling out each piece into a rectangle and rolling up then cutting into four pieces.

These are BY FAR the best dinner rolls I have ever made.  I don't have a breadmaker, so I made them according to the suggestions of other reviewers... and I even had to rush the proofing and rising time (proof time 10 mins, first rise 45 mins and second only 1/2 hour) and they STILL turned out great!  My husband is already bugging me to make them again (and I just made them yesterday).

These were so good!  My whole family loved them.  I use the yeast in a jar so I used 1 1/2 teaspoons.  I will be making these to go with soup, pot roast,italian food and just to eat with bread and jam.  Yum!  The dough comes out sticky and I have to add flour and knead until it seems right and that's a pain.  I'd like to know how much flour to add so it doesn't come out sticky.

Very yummy!  I don't have a bread machine so I made the rolls the old fashioned way.  The only change I made was to substitute 1 1/2c of the flour with whole wheat flour.  Also, I rolled the dough into two squares, cut each one into 1" strips and layered the strips in groups of five.  Then, I cut the layered strips in 2" sections with dental floss and put them into muffin pans.  Turned out absolutely fab!  Thanks for the great recipe, Donna!

This is a great, basic roll recipe.  I like that it uses all purpose flour because I can never seem to remember to buy bread flour.  It's also nice to not need one more item to take up space in my already small home.  I don't use a bread machine when I make this.  I set the eggs out for a couple hours to warm.  Then I place the warm water, warm milk and sugar in a bowl.  Dissolve the sugar and then add the yeast and let it proof.  Then I add the eggs, butter, salt and flour.  Mix well with my hands and put it in a greased bowl, turning once to coat, then cover with towel and let it rise.  After one hour (or after it doubles) I punch it down and roll into three small balls per muffin slot and make cloverleaf rolls.  I let them rise another hour and then bake.  Yummy and they go really fast around here so I bake a double batch which gives me approx. 48 cloverleaf rolls.

I've already rated this recipe once but felt it deserved another rating...it is fantastic! The best yeast rolls EVER and I have tried many recipes in my attempt to find the perfect ones...I followed it perfectly making my dough in the bread machine's dough cycle then simply pulling off about 15 balls to rise. Very simple. My family even says these are better then my mother-in-law's yeast rolls which is a real compliment. Thank you for this recipe!

Great, versatile dough recipe.  I made the rolls as written with half the recipe the first night, and I had to make my son stop eating them.  I formed the other half into smaller dough balls and put them in the fridge.  I melted some butter in the bottom of a glass pie plate two mornings later then sprinkled that with some brown sugar, chopped pecans, and cinnamon, then put the dough balls on top.  I baked them, then flipped the pie dish over onto a plate after taking them out of the oven - voila, sticky buns.  My kids were over the moon with those!

These rolls are simply amazing.  They come out perfect every single time.   I do not have a bread machine, so I prep the yeast in the warm water and about a Tbsp of the sugar.  Then, I warm the milk and butter to about the same temp in the microwave.  When the yeast is frothy, I stir in the warmed milk, butter, egg, remaining sugar, and salt.  I then add in the flour, one cup at a time, kneading in the last cup by hand. Form into a ball, cover, and place in a warm spot until the dough has doubled.  It takes about an hour.  Then, simply proceed with the recipe from Step 2.    I make these rolls at least twice a month.  My kids inhale them, expecially when I serve them with gravy or honey-butter.  The crescent shape is worth the extra effort, as it adds to the texture and charm of this wonderful, soft bread.  Going to try them as cinnamon rolls next.  Thank you for this 5 star recipe!

Oh my!  I was so shocked at how good these were!!!  I made these rolls last night for the first time, and they were a huge hit with the family!  I used the recipe exactly as written, except I used bread flour rather than all-purpose flour.  It made a beautiful, soft dough in my bread machine...not sticky at all.  And the rolls were light and so soft.  My husband ate 4, and then complained about eating too much.  I love to make homemade rolls, and this recipe has been added to my list of favorites.  Thanks so much!!!

We just love these!  After making a few batches, I decided that to get the perfect size for dinner crescents, roll to 12 inch circle, cut into quarters then cut each quarter into three slices so you have a total of 12 from each dough half.  You'll end up with a big basket of 24 not-too-big, not-too-small delicious crescent rolls.

This is one of the best roll recipes I've tried.  I have made this before but I made it again last night and the dough perfect.  I put into a 11x7 greased pan and they rose wonderfully.  I would rate it higher if I could.

these rolls tasted pretty good. they had a nice flavor, although they were a little tough the next day. i added about 2 tbsp of clover honey just because i love honey, but i'm sure they are good w/o that addition. i didn't want to use my breadmaker so i did it by hand. mix the water, a pinch of sugar, and yeast together (i just put them in a measuring cup) and let it proof, about ten minutes or until it gets bubbly. then just mix all the ingredients together (i usually use a wooden spoon), adding the flour last, until you have a sticky dough. knead on a floured surface until you get a smooth ball, place in a greased bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel or greased plastic wrap, and let it rise about 2 hrs in a warm place. then follow the directions from there. my apt was kind of cool, so it didn't rise really well the first time, but after i shaped them (i just cut into squares, i had about 24 rolls), buttered the tops, and let them rise again while i drove to mom's in the warm car (about 45 minute drive), they about doubled in size. they cooked for about 20 minutes and everyone loved them. i thought they tasted good, seemed just a tad dry. i may add a little more butter or less flour next time. otherwise, this is a great recipe. thanks for sharing.

Awesome dinner rolls!  I tried similar recipes several times that resulted in a disaster.  I followed this recipe without any alterations.  It's a little time consuming, but well worth it. The family is looking forward to them this year and asked that I double the batch.

These are delicious! I cut back on the butter spread on the rolls. I've made different shapes other than crescent including clover and regular dinner rolls. All turned out great!

Good flavor, but they are dry and dense.  Next time, I'm going to try using less flour.

I've tried to make rolls once before, and it was an abysmal failure. Two years after the failure I dragged out this recipe and decided to give it another shot.

Wow.

It was great! Everything rose like it was supposed to and the rolls cooked beautifully. My kids have devoured them and have been asking for them for snack time at school! I'm definitely extremely happy that I tried to make rolls again, as I will be making these for Thanksgiving dinner.

These were the best rolls I've ever made and I've tried almost everything. I didn't mix it or let it rise once in a bread machine because I don't have one but they turned out wonderfully anyway and I didn't have to knead forever either and the dough was never sticky. Barely needed flour to roll them out. They turned out soft and fluffy.

Wonderful recipe! Not too sweet, just right for a dinner roll.  Baked for 13 minutes and came out perfectly golden.  So easy to make and the whole family loved them.  Thank you!!!

Delicious! Easy dough to work with.  Make sure to spread rolls out when cooking - they rise and spread out a lot.  Next time I will cut out a few more rolls.

Yum!!  I make these as rounds rolls and after they rise I brush them with load of butter.  Sometimes I sprinkle garlic powder and salt on top too...Fabulous!

This was great and very easy to make! I do not have a bread machine so instead I did it by hand. First I let the milk, water, sugar, and yeast sit together for about 20 minutes to grow. I then added everything else and kneaded for a while. After it rose about an hour I formed 12 balls and put them in a 9x13 pan to rise again. After 45 min, I baked for 15 minutes. They were great! I'll definitely make them again! Maybe next time I'll use two pans though - the 12 rolls were huge!

We love, love, love these!  These are the only roll we make now.  Make sure the tip is well under the roll so it doesn't unravel. ***  Tried the dough in cinnamon rolls; yummy, gooey goodness!  See my photo notes on how I made them.

I double the recipe and roll them into balls and place them in a 9x13 greased cake pan. This is the best recipe. The rolls are not too heavy and not too light, just perfect.

These are the best homemade rolls I've ever made. So soft and taste great! I didn't have a breadmaker so I mixed the warm milk, water and yeast first and let set 20 minutes. Then I added the other ingredients, and flour cup by cup. I kneaded it and let it rise for 30 minutes. I made the rolls into balls insteads of crescents and let rise another 45 minutes to an hour. I cooked them exactly 10 minutes and they turned out perfect! :)

OK, but not spectacular.  A bit too sweet for my taste.  Didn't rise well, either, and I usually don't have problems with bread.

Sweet, but not overly sweet.  A real nice dinner roll.  I need a little more practice getting the dough to look nicer, but it went well.  I put on a cookie sheet and double batched it for Christmas.  My balls were uneven, so my rolls weren't the prettiest, but I got several comments over the taste of the rolls... Not the prettiest, but they sure taste good!

I ended up making these twice today (Christmas Day) the first time I just didn't like the results. (Good thing I started at 4 am)  They were ok but just not up to my standards of what I normally make for Dinner Rolls. So since it got such great reviews I decided to try again.  The second time  I made a few changes...instead of adding the 1/4 cup of butter at the end I changed that to shortening and actually added it into the dough in the bread machine.  I had to add another 1/4 cup of flour because after I added it the dough was just way to sticky (which I knew it was going to be) After I made these changes though the rolls were perfect.  They were light, fluffy, had a nice bread taste, and turned out beautifully.  Instead of rolling them out I put 3 small balls each into each muffin pan to make Clover Leaf Rolls.  They were really good. The only person who didn't like them was my cousin and I think that is just because he is used to my grandma's recipe....although he did eat 5 of them so he couldn't have hated them that much.

These were pretty good - the texture was light and fluffy.  I am giving them a 4 instead of a 5 because they could have had a little more flavor - 

I made these without a bread machine-proofed the yeast per the instructions on the yeast jar (20 minutes) (used one serving of yeast); warmed milk and butter in pan then added it to the yeast proof (make sure it's not too hot or you will kill the yeast), added sugar, salt/flour 1/2 C. at a time mixed in Kitchenaid with dough hook.  Added exactly 3 3/4 C. all purpose flour (if you dip your cup you will get too much flour).  Let rise 1 hour, punched down, divided and made clover leaf rolls, let rise 1 hour baked on 375 for 12 minutes.

Recipe made 12 rolls, plus enough left over for 2 small cinnamon rolls.

Passable, not that great.  I am a professional caterer and tried these for a huge event.  Thank goodness I used two different recipes, as my own potato yeast rolls were much better in performance and taste.  These seemed to be a step above a first year student's rolls.  Not impressed at all and will not use again.  Sorry for the low rating, but I want something upon which I can depend as my reputation and livelihood hangs on how my food looks and tastes.

This is an excellent recipe.  I bake a LOT of bread and this is probably one of the top "5" for taste, texture and ease.  I don't use a breadmaker and I always knead bread in a big bowl (like my grandmother taught me... less mess, I think! :)

A nice roll but not exceptional. Easy to work with and I shaped them Parker House style.  Served them with the Roast Sticky Chicken - Rotisserie Style from this site.  Hubby only ate one roll which is very unusual for him.

Love this recipe! I used the reviews of K Praper and Chars3girls (look under most helpful) and mixed by hand and they came out perfect. Don't pass this recipe up because you don't have a bread machine or mixer, you don't need them. Family loved them!

absolutely as promised! yesterday dinner has been built around these rolls: they are good with jam or salami or cheese or tomatoes... I made them simple, but you really could try with rosemary or pumpkin pureè or whatever takes your fancy in the batter, and you could easily put cheese or sugar and cinnamon inside while rolling them up. Many possibilities open up for you!

I made these yesterday.  The dough was like working with "silk".  I made 1/2 the recipe into dinner rolls and the remaining into cinnamon rolls [which were totally devoured in a short time!!] I just made another batch.  There is a little more humidity in the house today, so I had to add a bit more flour before shaping the dough.  I made 3 large rolls [for hamburgers] and the remaining into dinner rolls.  They are simply delicious and you can get very creative with this recipe. Thank you.

I cooked these for too long - the bottoms were brown and crunchy - but my guests still couldn't believe I had made them from a recipe! They were still delicious, and next time, when I have not got so many things going on in the kitchen, you can bet that these will be AMAZING. Made them crescents like the recipe said, and they were flaky and rich. Thanks!

YUMMMYY!! Hot outa the oven these rolls almost didn't make it to the table.  Next time I might add a squeak less sugar but other than that these were fabulous.  I took half the batch and rolled into balls and baked in muffin tins.  YUMMY!!
The second batch I rolled out and rubbed 1/3 cup softened butter and mixed 1 cup brown sugar with 3 tsps cinnamon and sprinkled all over the butter.  Rolled that up and cut into buns and let rise for awhile and baked 375 for 20 minutes.  I iced those with a cream cheese icing and WOW how delicious.  Great base recipe for so many yummy things.
Don't pass it up...you'll be missing out.

These rolls were amazing!!!  They were slightly sweet, but it was not overpowering.  They come out soft and stay that way for several days.  I just have to adjust the temperature and time for my oven.  You should try this recipe!

I have used this recipe now about 8 times. It is a winner every single time! I am not a big roll fan, and these are so delicious! I have made them by rolling them up as crecent rolls, but I also like to just divide them into 16 balls of dough and make them as pull-apart rolls.  Tonight I am using this dough recipe to make cinnamon rolls - I'm sure they'll be fabulous. This recipe is my favorite to make, it's so easy I have it memorized and can dump the ingredients into the bread machine in 5 minutes and leave to do errands or whatever. It is the best tasting roll I have made, and have ever had! A sure winner.

AWESOME RECIPE! I used my zojirushi bread machine to make this, and I made it into a loaf instead.  The results: absolutely tender, soft and moist bread.  I'd probably add a bit more sugar since I love sweet bread.  I made it with 1/2 bread flour and 1/2 all purpose to get the tenderness of the all purpose, but the height & rise of the bread flour.

Rolls just don't get better than this!  Super easy and delicious.  I live in Denver, CO and these even turned out perfect in high altitude without having to adjust the recipe.  I used plastic wrap sprayed with cooking spray rather than a towel while rising.  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

Awesome recipe-

I used the stand mixer-I did have to add a bit more flour (about 1/4+ C) maybe because of humidity? I didnt proof the yeast, I just added all dry ingredients, heated milk/water/melted butter, tempered the egg and mixed the whole thing with the stand mixer.
 The dough seemed a bit sticky when I put it in a greased bowl to rise, but it was just fine. I let it rise a few hours, punched it down and formed it (half for clover rolls, half for cinnamon rolls) let rise and baked at 375* for 12 minutes.
 Tastes wonderful-bakes up light and airy-Really yummy.
Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Loved this recipe.  I mixed with my Kitchenaid mixer instead of bread machine, but it was excellent - just like from a bakery or restaurant.  I brushed my dough with olive oil and sprinkled parmesan on each crescent before rolling.  Be generous or the flavor won't stand up to the bread.

I think these were amazing. All I did different was make them into 15 buns and then baked them in a 13 by 9 pan. They were incredibly soft and the dough was sooo easy to work with..not sticky at all. I absolutely can not wait to use this recipe to make cinnamon rolls. Oh and i did not put the butter on until I formed the buns and let them rise. I then buttered the tops litely after baking. Update: I made the cinnamon rolls. They were excellent. I used the filling and topping from cinnamon rolls III. I rolled my dough into a 19 by 12 rectangle. It made 15 rolls. I baked them 375 for about 20 mins in a 13 by 9 pan. AMAZING!!

Absolutely easy, and delicious!  Mine rose so much though, that they were huge.  I would cut into more wedges before rolling up, they more than doubled in size for me.  Also, because the dough is so sweet they brown really quickly on the bottom, be careful!

This was my first attempt at dinner rolls from scratch and they turned out beautifully! I don't have a bread machine so I did the work by hand and I was short on time so instead of rolling them into cresent shapes I just divided the dough into 12 portions, dropped them into a muffin tin and let them rise for an hour that way. The cooking time was a bit off for me so the rolls were a little more done than I prefer but they were delicious just the same.

Loved these rolls.  I cut down a bit on the sugar, but they were still plenty sweet for dinner rolls.  They were also beautiful.  I can't wait to try these as cinnamon rolls, or other types of rolls.  I also don't have a bread machine, so I just let the yeast sit in the water with a bit of the sugar for a few minutes, then added the rest of the wet ingredients, then mixed in the dry.

I put everything but the water in my bread machine, started mixing, then realized my mistake...put in the water late and these still turned out PERFECT!!!  So, I would agree that this recipe is forgiving.  I made 12 yes 12 JUMBO cloverleaf rolls and they were to die for!  10 min. @ 400 degrees was perfect for my oven and what a treat they were!  I brushed melted but not warm butter on before baking.  Thank you...these will be on my table every holiday, mabey every week!

This is as amazing as everyone said it was. I followed the advice of others and added an extra 1/4 cup flour, which made it perfect for handling since I used the dough cycle of my bread machine and baked in the oven.

These rolls are so yummy, even better served with honey butter.  I do not spread the butter on before shaping, but usually brush them with melted butter when they come out of the oven.  Great recipe!!

OK folks - I made the dough last night and a little FYI - if you want to make a loaf - do NOT let it rise for the full hour. It "poofed" wonderfully but sank as soon as I set it on the counter. (I let my bread rise in a preheated & turned off oven)  Not one to waste - I baked it (350 for 20 mins)  When it came out it was heavenly.  Light, airy & just plain good. Another little FYI - do not put a "not quite cooled yet" loaf in a plastic bag & into the fridge.  This morning it was quite heavy & dense.  Will try again and watch as it rises and maybe separate into 2 pans.  But the taste was still as awesome.

These are excellent.  I didn't roll the dough, I divided it into 16 balls and brushed melted butter on them before putting them in the oven.  They came out big and fluffy and very tasty.  Everyone was asking for this recipe.  This is a keeper!!!

Super delicious! I like wholemeal breads, so I used wholemeal flour instead of white flour. They taste fantastic and you won't stop at eating one. So if you have guests, be sure to bake double! You can also use this recipe to make buns with filling - my family favourites - Sweet Azuki bean paste and Kaya.

Fantastic! These rolls should come with a warning because you can't eat just one. Very easy to make too. I used my stand mixer to knead the dough as another reviewer suggested and they turned out great. Be aware that they are quite sweet; I made them again with less sugar (about 1/4 cup) for a more savory roll that better complimented our lasagna dinner.

Thank you so much Donna for sharing this recipe.  I have been trying to master rolls, and I have finally done it.  Everyone who tries these wants the recipe.  I don't have a bread machine, but I just knead by hand and let rise an hour and then go to step 2, and they turn out great!!!

Very good rolls.  I didn't use the bread machine.  I mixed it by hand and let it sit for 1 1/2 hours.  I would recommend greasing your cookie sheet though.  Everyone at the dinner table was really impressed with the rolls!

Besides the fact that I've always these croissants (I was expecting something more like buns, though once I read the recipe I realized that wasn't the case) these are great!  The dough is soft and manageable for rolling and the bread machine does the hard work.  I even screwed up by heating the oven too much so that when I put the rolls in to rise they actually baked slightly, and then halfway through baking the second batch someone turned off the oven...and they were STILL good!  So, give them a try. 

Note: Many bread machines include the First Rise in their Dough cycle in case anyone is confused.

These were excellent!  Made them for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them.    Substituted freshly milled hard white spring wheat flour for all of the flour and about 2.5 tsp instant yeast for the 1 pkg. active dry yeast.  Great flavor and light & fluffy.

What a wonderful recipe!  These rolls are a hit.  They are so soft and STAY that way!  Great flavor.  I love them.  Am looking for other ways to shape them though.

I have a bread machine & only use it once it awhile.   I am always buying rolls at the market
and they are expensive.  This is my 1st time making homemade.   Wonderful !!!   - a little too
moist in the center- a little less liquid.  My husband didnt say much when we had them for dinner
but I made his sandwiches with them the next day-
leftover halibut.   He raved about them when he 
came home.  (he never does that!)  I plan on making these often - I will save $$$ on dinner rolls and sandwich bread!!!   MUST TRY

I loved these rolls.. I'm sure I will be making them again. I used half bread flour and half all purpose flour and just made round rolls instead of cresant rolls.

I used my bread machine on dough setting. I then made the dough into 24 dough balls and placed them in a 9.5 x 13.5 glass baking dish sprayed with baking spray. Cover them and let them rise for 1 hour. I baked them at 375f for 15 minutes. I will definitely be making this a lot. Thank you for sharing!

This is the best sweet dinner rolls! I didn't have enough room for making them actual ROLLS, so instead I put them in the muffin pan and it tastes wonderful all the same. Sweet, not too much but just right. Crunchy and the crust is delicious. It's a recipe from Heaven.

I have made this recipe several times and it turns out great every time. Everyone loves these dinner rolls. The bread maker makes it so easy to make. I made these rolls but rolled dough into a rectangle and cut 20 pieces and made them into a ball and placed into a 9X13" greased pan and baked them. My husband and I both like them even better then the crescent shape.

If you attempt to bake this recipe, please do! Do not let the bad reviews influence you to try these out! :) Everyone who knows how to handle yeast do, will have no problems to get them fluffy and tasty. I have no bread machine, I bake my breads in the oven, so I made the dough the "traditional" way. (Let yeast activate in warm liquids with a tbsp of sugar till foamy then add the rest of the ingredients), I let the dough rise for about 45 minutes and made the punch down finger test, the dough was easy to work with. Many said they needed incredible extra amounts of flour, unless the recipe has been modified after these reviews I cannot confirm. I baked them at 375°F and lowered the temp to 350°F for the last 5 minutes. Also, when I put them in, I gave them a little steam which I let out of the oven after 5 minutes. Thanks, for this great recipe!

Edit: I froze a few, since I had made double of the recipe. I took them out right before dinner and thawed them in the microwave and taste just as good as just out of the oven.

The recipe is easy to follow and quick to make.  I used one half of the dough to make crescent rolls as directed and the other half of the dough to make pepperoni rolls.  Both sets of rolls had a good flavor, but the dough turned out denser than I would have liked. Next time I make this I'm going to substitute bread flour for the all purpose flour in the hopes of making it a little lighter....

Wonderful! We loved them ! Idid alter the recipe, used SELF RISING FLOUR (it's what I had on hand), and 2 fresh eggs, and no salt. I had to adjust with a little more flour as the dough mixed, I guess the second egg was a little much..lol. I did a quick rise at 200 degrees for 5 minutes, then straight into 20 minutes baking at 350. Note: I did not use quick rise yeast. The last two minutes I poured melted butter over rolls, and finished baking, beautiful rolls. Delicious! Going to be my new roll recipe. thanks again!

Loved them! Luckily, someone had posted directions using a KitchenAid (I don't have a bread maker). My husband loved them and he's pretty picky. The only thing I did differently was butter them AFTER they came out the oven (that's how we did it when I worked at Golden Corral).

AMAZING!!! I just made these and they are so soft and buttery. When I made these I didn't have any active dry yeast, so I used bread machine yeast and they turned out wonderfully. The only thing with using bread machine yeast instead of active dry yeast is that you have to use less. (ex.one .25 ounce package of active dry yeast is equal to 2 1/4 teaspoons, which I had to reduce by 25%, so I ended up using 1 and a heaping 1/2 teaspoon of bread machine yeast.)  I also made half of the batch into cinnamon rolls by mixing 1/2 a cup of brown sugar and 1 tsp of cinnamon.

This dough is sweet and chewy, but also very thick.  I think it would be excellent for cinnamon rolls.  I made it at Thanksgiving as cloverleaf rolls...while they were tasty, they weren't as light and fluffy as I like my dinner rolls to be.

This was an easy and forgiving recipe. I had to let it sit for the second rise for about 2 hours. The rolls were still perfect and delicious at Thanksgiving dinner.  Very soft.

These are so good. Followed this exactly and they were the best! If you take your time and shape them perfectly they'll come out beautiful. I was sloppy on my first batch so they looked like  but still tasted amazing. The 2nd time they came out looking and tasting like something you'd get at a restaurant. You'll love these. Yummy!

I turned this dough into cloverleaf rolls. Came out PERFECT! Just the right amount of sweetness.

Even better if you use the water and 3tbsp of flour to make a roux, then proceeding as usual. It's fluffier and softer!

No bread machine so I followed the directions given in an early comment for soaking the yeast with the sugar etc. Directions worked well but I would have let the dough rise another 30 mins. to an hour next time. When I checked the dough rise after 30 mins I was afraid it wouldn't-- it was still very firm. Dough did rise a lot in the last 30 mins though and I think the bread may have come out fluffier if left to proof longer but that's just an opinion at this point.

The recipe is good and seems trustworthy, if a little bland and yeasty. Was also a bit more crusty than I expected, a heavier, denser bread. Made cinnamon rolls with a part of the batch and made a mess when the filling ran out everywhere, but the cinnamon variety was a little better imo, probably due to adding flavor to the dough, which I am going to try doing myself next time.

Excellent recipe! I'll be making this bread more often. I spread garlic butter (a recipe I found here) on the dough before rolling it up and it worked perfect to make garlic bread for my spaghetti dinner.

Absolutely wonderful.  I use bread flour and instant yeast and mix in the bread machine.  Easy and delicious!

Edited to add:  If you want to make it in your KitchenAid, use less flour - it works well for me to use 3 1/4 cup instead of 3 3/4 cup.

Delicious!  I used this recipe and added sticks of pepperoni for delicious AWARD WINNING pepperoni rolls.  It was very easy to put the ingredients in my bread machine to mix while I cut the pepperoni into sticks.  By the time I was done, so was the kneading.  Roll out the dough, add pepperoni sticks, roll into "buns", let rise and bake.  Easy and Delicious!  Thank you!!!

This is exactly that soft, buttery, pull-apart dinner recipe I was looking for. I shaped them into bunnies for Easter, and everyone said they tasted just like their Grandma's rolls growing up. Thanks!

I made two batches..... One, I rolled 15 balls, and put in a 9x13 pan.  The other I rolled balls, and put on a cookie chest, not touching.  The pan, rose, and came out perfect.  The cookie sheet, did not rise, just spread sideways.  Did recipes the exact same.  Does anyone hazard a guess what could of happened????

WONDERFUL. Follow the recipe exactly, do not skimp on the butter you brush on, it makes the rolls softer.

Dan's old fashion recipe is super, but this one is superb. I made a loaf of bread using this recipe and it came out very close to store bought. The only change I made was using 1 cup of milk instead of and 1/2 water. Great recipe. Made rolls with it too and they came out like store bought.

Absolutely love these! You know you have a good recipe when there are over 2100 reviews! I usually make them into rolls in a lightly greased 9x13 pan, I've made these with part whole wheat & part all-purpose flours, and have also made them with buttermilk. I'm thinking of making them as herbed rolls next. So much room for variations, and I can count on a perfect result every time.

These rolls are fabulous as written. I've made them so many times, with many variations. I have a breadmaker, but I prefer to make these the traditional way. The dough is very easy to work with. The taste is amazing. I've used a few variations over the years; Such as all water and no milk. I've replaced the egg with oil. I've added herbs and spices into the butter mixture. And as the recipes states, wonderful for cinnamon AND orange sweet rolls. This is a great starting point for making amazing rolls your family will love. And remember: It's just food. Play with it!

These are the bomb!  Made a test batch for hubby before launching into roll production for Thanksgiving.  Melt in your mouth delish! Followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out perfectly! Thanks for making me look good with the relatives! (Now I am making them for Christmas as well!) 
If the batch is too large for rolls, you can use half to make Cinnamon rolls, which turned out great also. 
Followed another reviewer's suggestion to make balls for rolls (not risen) and freeze for later. When you are ready to use them, put them out to thaw at room temperature and rise until about double in size, baking at 350 until done.

I made this today to serve next week for Thanksgiving.  I reserved two for "The Taste Test" and the rest I put into the freezer.  These were amazing.  I did not use a bread machine, just made them by hand normally.  Will definitely make them again.  Thank you , Donna, for sharing this wonderful recipe.

mostly this was very good, but I too could not get them to raise, I did what my mom used to do I put them in the oven that I had warmed first,then turned the oven off. that did it, they rose. I guess if your not in a real warm area they do not raise well. You could also put them on top of stove while you are cooking in the oven that will get them to rise also. I think they tasted fine but not the best rolls I ever had like some people thought.

Love it.  I do not have the kitchen counter space, so I roll in my hands and knot them in the middle.  Works.  I do not have a bread maker, so I do the traditional way.

These could not be easier. I made them with my father-in-law's favorite pot roast dinner. I did the cloverleaf thing too -- rolled into three balls per muffin tin and they looked downright professional. I followed the advice of the first reviewer under the recipe and mixed the milk and ALL THE SUGAR and the water in the bowl. At first I just mixed in the 2tsps the packet of yeast calls for and it didn't foam but when I added the rest of the sugar from the recipe -- it foamed right up. I buttered the insides of the muffin tins and I brushed melted butter on top of the rolls before baking. I also lowered my oven temp to 350 as that first review suggests. These were very good. The next day my mom stopped by and ate two. She liked them so much that she took home the recipe! This is a keeper and these rolls will be on the Thanksgiving dinner table this year.

I have tried several different roll recipes and I couldn't find one that I loved until I made these!! They are amazing, instead of turning them into crescents I rolled them into 36 balls and placed them into a muffin pan and then put melted butter and honey onto  and then baked them and then as soon as they came out of the oven I put honey and butter on the top again.  The rolls came out amazingly good, they were almost all gone by dinner time :)  Thank you for the recipe, I will definitely be making these again and again :)

Absolutely delicious!!  These are the best rolls ever!  I rolled them into balls and  put them in a 9X13 pan. It made 18 large rolls. I'm definitely going to make these again.

Thank you for a lovely, light and easy recipe! I followed directions as written and wouldn't change a thing! I shaped them into simple balls and baked them in muffin tins....perfect! Trust the recipe as written...I used the dough setting on my bread machine, let the buns ruse for an hour and baked them for 18 minutes. Perfection!

I recently made these for a dinner party.  They turned out way too heavy for me to be considered as a dinner roll.  This recipe produces a great dough, one that would be more suitable for cinnamon rolls.  My husband and guests liked them.  I was hoping for something lighter and flakier.

My husband is the pickiest person I know. He won't try anything new..he eats his plain chicken, rice and corn everyday.  I pleaded with him to try these rolls and he LOVED them!!  He ate three in a row!  He said that the rolls were excellent and he wants me to make them for Christmas dinner.  All 16 rolls are gone after one meal...my whole family loved them.

I used the ingredients exactly as listed, but rolled in balls instead of making crescent rolls.  I have tried several roll recipes and my family loved this one.  It was easy and delicious.  I served with cinnamon honey butter.

I've tried numerous roll recipes over the years.  This recipe is the best, by far.  My family loves sweet rolls, and these were perfect.  I wouldn't change a thing!  I do not own a bread machine, but these were easy enough to make by hand.  I dissolved the yeast in warm water.  Meanwhile, I scalded the milk, melted the butter in the hot milk, and let the mixture cool.  I whisked in the egg when the milk was cool enough not to scramble it.  I mixed the dry ingredients and added to the wet ingredients, a little at a time.  I kneaded the dough for 6 to 8 minutes, placed it in a greased bowl to rise, and covered it with a cloth.  After about an hour in my warm kitchen, I punched the dough down and shaped it into 20 rolls, which fit nicely into a greased 13x9 pan.  At last!  The perfect roll recipe for my family

I no longer have a bread machine so I used my kitchen-aid mixer with the dough hook instead.  I still placed ingredients in the bowl in the order required for a bread machine.  These rolls turned out so soft and tender and were beautiful!

This actually did made good tasting dinner rolls, the best that I've made so far! (I'm not a big fan of white flour, but a couple of times a year won't kill anybody, and for Thanksgiving and Christmas one really should serve light fluffy rolls!)  I did tweak slighly and used bread flour instead of all purpose, and did mix the dough in a bread maker. As I said, best rolls I've made so far!!  Donna, thanks for sharing.

Made these rolls using the bread maker as per the instructions.  The dough was heavenly!!  Rolls came out very flaky.  Best rolls ever, will be my faithful standby from here on out.  Simple to make, just need to allow the time.

I don't have a bread machine, so I proofed the yeast with warm water/milk/sugar mixture in my KA.  Followed the reciepe but made into rolls instead of crescent shape.  Though I don't think I let the dough rise enough during the 2nd rise because my rolls came out dense.  Ohwell.  Will keep trying and see if I can perfect it.

Fantastic recipe. I prepared dough in my bread machine on dough/pasta setting. Seemed a little dry during mixing process so I added two extra tablespoons of warm water and and ran the mixing process for a second time. Used the dough to prepare clover leaf rolls that were so delicious, light and had nice flavor. Hubby said they were the best he ever had!!! Will be making these again. Especially during holidays.

I have made this as loaf bread many times. Everytime it has turned out great! Makes 2 8x5 loaves for me per recipe. Great as regular rolls too. I've used the bread machine, as well as the kitchen aid mixer. Make sure your liquids aren't too hot (temp of baby bottle on your arm). Mine has never flopped. Great recipe, thanks!

Thank-you so much for this recipe. It makes all my family's favorite things from the best dinner rolls ever to cinnamon rolls, and cream cheese danishes. So versatile for any time you need a "sweet" dough! Where would I be without you?

Best. Rolls. Ever. My search for the perfect dinner roll is over! These are so versatile, you can shape them any way you want or make adjustments to have cinnamon, orange, coffee rolls, etc. I make using my KitchenAide and bake at 350° until done....so easy! Also, divide in half and pat into a 9x13" pan - makes awesome cheesy bread.

The first batch I followed the recipe and I liked it, but the second time I added one egg and another 1/4 cup sugar. Tied them into knotted rolls. Whisked one egg white and a Tbs cold water then brushed tops before cooking. These were a hit! The best dinner rolls I have ever had. My family loved them.

I was really disappointed because these started out great.  I didn't use a bread machine but started the yeast in the water,milk,sugar and then let the dough rise for 45 minutes.  Everything was fine at this point, nice rise etc, but then from here...it all went downhill.  Rolled into crescents, let sit for another hour....no rise at all.  Left alone for another 30 minutes...nothing.  Tried baking a few anyways but turned out heavy, dense and way too sweet.  Not my cup of tea for dinner rolls...

So yummy...perfect for our Easter dinner!  Instead of a crescent I made a basic bun shape, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Can't wait to have a mini ham sandwich later tonight.

I'm actually shocked that this turned out! I don't have a bread machine so I did it the traditional way and I used whole milk because that's what I had. I think the key is to leave the dough slightly sticky and let them rise, rise, rise both times! I only baked for about 18 minutes. I basted with melted butter before the second rise and as soon as they came out of the oven. Yum!

WOW, that was great!   I used the Kitchen Aid as the other review said, made the ball rolls, followed as is otherwise.  So easy!  

Made 4 rolls for dinner tonight, and made the rest into little rolls and flashed freeze them, then put them in freezer bags for later.

Husband is a fan!

I made this recipe kind of last minute and it turned out WONDERFUL! I am making them for our Christmas Eve feast tonight! I used the directions K Praper listed in her review using my Kitchen Aid as I didn't feel like digging out my bread machine. The rolls are fluffy and moist with just the right amount of sweetness. they remind me of Parker House rolls. DE-LIC-OUS!!

I am sure the recipe isn't the problem, its me..So I am giving it a good rating.. I don't have a bread maker or the patience to knead for very long, so mine didn't turn out like rolls really, more like biscuits.. Does anyone know, is the kneading the problem? I also didn't really let the yeast sit in the bowl with the other ingredients long enough.. So I am sure thats the problem..

These could not have been any easier.  The only problem was that I didn't make enough. Next time I will double the recipe. I brushed the tops of mine with honey butter straight out of the oven and my guests loved them. I can't wait to try them as orange rolls.

Add more flour!  Way too sticky when I took out of bread machine to roll into rolls.  I'd say add at least a 1/2 cup to begin with more.

I used my bread machine for the first time using this dough recipe and couldn't be happier with the results. My neighbor happened to be over when I put the test batch in the oven. She isn't a fan of bread but loved these! We ate about 6 of them hot out of the oven. I might have to make more cause they are for tomorrows Thanksgiving dinner! Thanks for the recipe, they are perfect!

Novice or expert you can't go wrong with these rolls.  They are VERY forgiving if you are afraid your 12" circle isn't "perfect" or your triangles are not all exactly the same size.  They are delicious and look beautiful!  Nothing but compliments all the way around.

delicious! I received nothing but compliments when I served these. I didn't roll them like crescents. I cut them into 16 pieces and baked them in a round pan.

They are also wonderful with herbed butter spread on them before baking.

The perfect dinner rolls – great flavor and texture.  I had put an egg wash on the rolls but I don't think they need it and wouldn't bother the next time.

Fantastic just as the recipe stated.  Next I'm going to try them in the cupcake tin as other reviewers have recommended, it sounds like that would be easier than making the half-moon rolls.

I substituted 1 cup of the flour with whole wheat flour and they're still light and fluffy!

Prepared exactly as stated only without the breadmaker option and made as rolls instead of crescents and it is not a keeper for me. Turned out dry and not sweet at all :(

Have made these many times now and they work great just as listed in the recipe. To save time I make one big circle and use a pizza cutter to cut into 16 wedges, then roll each one (stretching the edges).  FABULOUS!

The dough was nice a soft coming out of the breadmaker. However, the final rolls were a little dry. I'm going to try them again as round rolls instead of crescents and see if I get a moister result.

Made these for a kids camp with over 230 adults/kids and bread was the hit of the week.  My family wraps this bread around hot dogs and I also make a loaf bread out of it.  Thank you for this great recipe!!!!

"My oh My!!!" exclaimed radio co-workers of the fiancee.  They said this was the best.  I like to tweak eventually, but for bread lovers tweaking isn't needed.  I didn't have a bread machine, old schooled it with the help of other reviewers.

squishy, fluffy buns. I made the dough in the bread maker, and divided 16 balls for buns, rose again, baked for about 11 minutes or less at 400, and topped with butter and honey, and ate 3 1/2. Wayyy too good. I'll add extra sugar next time because that would be extra saaweeeettt.

These rolls! Oh these rolls! I promise, they are the BOMB and truly are 5 stars like everyone says. Please don't alter the recipe, try it as is and then alter it if need be. They are decadent, for sure but worth it!

I absolutley ADORED these rolls. We have a bread maker, so after dumping all of the ingredients into the pan, I put it on dough, and my life was complete. Really yummy fresh out the oven, or nuked in the microwave the day after. They are soft and yeasty, and in my opinion, JUST PERFECT.

A no-miss recipe.  I seek opportunities when I'll be home long enough to make these and go for it every time.  We have a small family of 3 but the neighbors are always willing to stop by when they know these are in the oven so there are never any leftovers.  In fact, there are rarely enough.  

I've also used the same dough to do a sweet cinnamon roll and those are also fantastic.

This is the best bread recipe I have ever tried! Sometimes I double the amount of yeast I put in which makes the bread really light. This is a favorite in my house and even my kids love them. Especially good to make cinnamon rolls with!

These were easy if you use your bread maker and they were very yummy! Mine turned out a little hard, I think I had some old ingredients that caused this but I'm not sure so this is why I am rating only four stars.

I have one word for this recipe.... yummy!  We actually leave it in the breadmaker and bake as a loaf.  When we want a desert bread I'll throw in a tblsp of cinnamon, sometimes a handful of raisins.  But, we love it as the recipe is too!  Great bread!

These were not the best rolls that I've ever tasted, but they were good and easy to make.
I did not use the bread machine, but instead mixed in my stand mixer with dough hook and let the dough rise until doubled (about 2 hours) before rolling out.

Not that this recipe needs another review, but the rolls were excellent.  My family devoured them and my 8yo asked if I could make them every night.  
I did not make them into crescents but rather into 12 cloverleaf rolls.  This is my go-to recipe for rolls from now on!

really good but made 10 rolls in 2 pans, should make 15 in 3 pans, also should use bread flour (I didn't).
Made them again, used bread flour, and 1/2 cup sugar, knead with Kitchenaid made crescents, even better!!!

I just made this and it should be called pillow-soft sweet bread and adding another 5 stars for rating. It is DELISH!!!! I followed all that's called for except I just did the regular roll and not a cresent style. This is definitely a keeper recipe. Thanks!

WONDERFUL & EASY I calculated for 16 serving and used the dough cycle on my  bread machine. Followed the recipe exactly. Instead of dinner rolls I made 4 big hamburger rolls and and 10 gooey cinnamon rolls.  I am not an experienced bread maker and this turned out absolutely fabulous. Will use it again & again Thanks so much for this delightfully tasty & easy recipe !!!

Big and beautiful rolls - these are by no means dainty!!!  Delicious and soft, with or without added butter...my sons devoured them hot out of the oven.  I used 2 1/2 tsp bread machine yeast insted of the packet.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

Absolutely amazing! I got so many compliments when I made these and I'm a novice baker! I love to cook but have always been intimidated by baking. Not any more! So easy and delish!

I adore this recipe.  I've been using it for several months now to make our loaves of bread.  After 3.5 years of trying to find the perfect bread recipe, this was it.  It tastes a lot like store bought bread, but it's healthier and cheaper!  For my son, who is on a casein-free diet, I do sub the cows milk for almond milk and I use coconut oil instead of butter.  I also use unbleached white flour in place of the all-purpose and sometimes, when I'm feeling some health convictions, I'll swap out half the white flour for wheat.  I should do it more often, but I am just not a fan of whole wheat.  :o  This recipe has been perfect for my family!  Thank you for posting it!

I tried this recipe several times, first of all you do need a bread mechine for this! I tried it without and followed a few other reviewers suggestions and the rolls just don't turn out like when you follow the recipe exactly! Second, these are the best rolls I have ever made and will definately make them again and again!

Excellent recipe. made a few changes however, since I don't have a bread machine. Combined all dry ingredients and added the wet ones to it. And instead of oil, used melted vegetable shortening. Guess it came out even softer because of that alteration. After combining all ingredients i rolled out the dough onto a well floured surface since the dough was quite sticky, kept adding flour until i had a soft, smooth and stretchy dough. Let it rise in a greased bowl, covered with a warm damp cloth until doubled in size, about 45mins. Rolled out and cut wedge shape then rolled like a croissant. Perfect recipe!!!! Thanks

Yummy!  Followed review by K Praper with great success.  Made them into ropes and wound them around to make a roll.  We enjoyed with honey butter straight out of the oven.

made these today, everyone loved them.  I made rolls, not crescents and they were perfect.  I baked at 375 though, my oven is a bit hot, they were beautifully browned and had a great flavour.

I made these for Christmas dinner and they were a huge hit! I put a cinnamon/brown sugar/cinnamon/butter mixture in half of them and only the butter in the other half. Both were amazing. The second time I made them, I rolled out 4 circles to make smaller rolls. Excellent, is now a staple in my baking repertoire!

This is an excellent recipe.  I changed the warm water and warm milk to 1 cup of warm milk and also brushed the tops prior to baking.  These are large-sized rolls after they rise and bake, but are so light and just the right hint of "sweetness" to them.

These turned out wonderful. I did end up having to use more flour in the bread machine as the dough was sticky. When they came out of the oven I brushed them with melted butter. They disappeared fast.

Wow... this recipe is just perfect. I was too lazy to pull out my bread machine, so I did this all by hand. It took a lot longer than expected to rise, because I was impatient waiting for the yeast to foam, but the rolls were done in about 2.5 hours, and were fluffy and delicious. The only change I would make is to not use sweet cream butter, but instead use salted butter, as it wasn't salty enough to balance out the sweet.

Incredible and so easy. I've made them like cloverleaf rolls and regular round rolls. I put a little slit in the top of the round rolls and brushed them with butter to make split rolls....very good. Now I'm looking forward to making cinnamon rolls and maybe the bread. My family loves them and they ask for them instead of store bought. I'm very glad I ran across this recipe!

These were good, but since I don't have a bread machine, they came out a little dense. Maybe more rise time? Regardless, compliments said they tasted like Pillsbury croissants.

I just made these today (bread machine, clover shaped in muffin pan), Oh my they were delicious and a HUGE hit at our holiday party.   I could not get over how the KIDS kept coming back for more. I can't wait to bake up another batch and to use this dough for other treats.

I agree with everyone.  This recipe is divine.  However, I took these and Honey of an Oatmeal bread to a family Christmas party.  (I made rolls out of the recipe instead of a loaf as called for).  I got more compliments from the Honey of an Oatmeal rolls.  Go figure.

Awesome recipe. I always get the best compliments on these. I usually double or triple it too! Editing to add that I regularly make cinnamon rolls out of this dough. I recently made doughnuts out of it. They were the best!

I have made these rolls hundreds of times since finding the recipe here. They always get rave reviews by all who sample them. So quick and easy, they make me look like an exceptional baker. I roll them into balls and bake them in a 13x9 pan instead of crescent shapes. Thank you for such a wonderful yeast roll recipe!

These are great!  I just hit the dough cycle and when it was done I made fist sized balls, placed them in a buttered pan, let them rise and baked as directed.  I wasn't up for cutting, buttering and rolling.  Maybe one day!

With such high praise, I made these for Thanksgiving without a trial run first. We all agree with the 5 star review and if there were more stars...well these would receive the max. They are light, chewy, just plain delicious! I did find in making a second batch that it is important not to overbake them, they are not as moist. On the third batch I exchanged 1/4 cup of white flour with Teff flour. Very yummy and still maintained their wonderful texture. All around a gread roll.

I have made this two years in a row and my grandpa LOVED it and took some leftovers home with him!  I've made it with and without a breadmaker, and they turned out beautifully both times. I don't make the crescents (because at Thanksgiving, who has time?!) but did make "pull apart" dinner rolls.   THANK YOU!

These were as fun to make as to eat. I have to admit I flubbed the directions and forgot to let them rise. I also rolled them backwards with the small end first. They were so tasty and the ability to roll them open and use them as a butter pocket was a bit hit. They made for great "Turkey tongue Thanksgiving rolls"!

Oh wow! Oh wow!  I have since given up on using a bread machine to make bread.  I just prefer bread made sing a bosch mixer or a Magic Mill Assistent (which is what I have).  I have made this recipe as dinner rolls 5 times.  I even made it for thanksgiving and everyone raved about it.  My hubby and son asked me to make this into a loaf of bread which I did today (I doubled the recipe, using a 9x5 loaf pan, I baked at 375 for 20 mins).  WOW!!!!!!   Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.   Since I grind my own grain (Prarie gold) that is what I used for all the recipes and it still came out excellent.  Thanks

Wow, these were excellent. I was asked to bring rolls to our Thanksgiving gathering, so I decided to try making them homemade for the first time. I used our bread maker, and it was actually pretty easy. Got lots of compliments, and the rolls were delicious - great flavor and texture. No leftovers to take home. We'll definitely make these again. Thanks for a great recipe!

A perfect 5 star recipe, tastes wonderful and easy!  Even my 7-year old son was able to help me roll out the dough and roll into crescents.  I brought these to Thanksgiving dinner and my family was sure I had bought them.

I MADE THESE WITH MY HANDS!! And they were fantastic! I didn't make them crescent style because of time limitations, but used the exact recipe and mixed and kneeded with my hands (my KichenAid broke not too long ago). These were so easy to mix, let them raise once for an hour and then baked for 10 min and they were perfection. Thanks!

I've been making these rolls for a few years now and they are fool proof- so good EVERY time.  I use 1 C whole wheat flour and the rest all purpose flour.  The flavor and texture can't be beat!

My Mom has made this recipe every Thanksgiving that I can remember, now I do. Usually in a double or even triple batch as my sibs and I usually ate them like candy, even before the turkey was on the table. We always cook them at 400 degrees, just under 10 minutes, until lightly golden brown. Then after sliding them onto a cooling rack, brush with butter while still hot. It is essential the they are still soft and a moist on the inside and they will last for days if there are leftovers. PERFECT for leftover turkey sandwiches too!!

Something is missing and can't put my finger on it.  More salt?  I should have brushed the top of them with butter before cooking, I had too much flour on my "lightly floured" surface...  I haven't cooked bread in years, forgot how much I enjoy it, want to try others and may come back and re-review this.  However, my neighbor who ate half of them said they are wonderful and it is an awesome recipe, she was stunned that I wasn't pleased with the final product.

They were amazing!!! My three year old son, who hates hot food, begged me to give them to him while they were still hot... he told me he would blow on them to cool them down.  He liked them that much!!!  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out AWESOME!!!

Very easy recipe!  They came out great!  I cut the dough into 36 pieces for pan rolls.  My family even commented how they tasted like Texas Roadhouse (restaurant chain in the Midwest/Texas area) rolls!!  Definitely a keeper!

I can't stop thinking about these rolls and I keep looking for reasons to make them again. I use my kitchenaid instead of a bread machine though.  So good and totally worth the 3 pounds I've gained because I practically ate the entire batch myself.  Great for cinnamon rolls too!

I didn't make them into crescents, just rolled the dough into balls and then buttered the tops when they came out of the oven. Absolutely perfect! Thanks for sharing!

Very good!  My bread maker had a dough/rise cycle I used which resulted in them rising for 2 hours before making them into roles.  I then allowed them to rise a bit more after making them into rolls, so they were VERY fluffy! :)

These need a higher than a 5 star rating. This is very easy dough, great to work with. You can form them into whatever shape you want, they still come out wonderful. Love this recipe. I've made it about 5 times in two weeks. It's great, even made the dough to roll hotdogs in for a quick dinner meal. Yummy.

These were a huge hit at our Thanksgiving dinner!  All of the delicious of homemade rolls with less effort. As have many reviewers, I prepped the dough in the bread machine then split it into 36 parts to make 12x3-piece clover leaves in an ungreased, no-stick muffin tin.  They baked up perfectly!

I must have done something wrong because my dough wouldn't rise.  I checked and double checked the recipe but I followed it to a T.  The only thing I can think is that maybe it's because I used wheat flour?

The first time I made this was my first experience in breadmaking. I don't have a bread machine, so I followed the advice to dissolve the yeast with a TBSP of sugar in the warm water, and while it proofed, heated the milk, then added the butter and sugar to the warm milk, added it to the yeast stuff and the egg, and mixed the flour in a bit at a time. I got the best sandwich rolls for my efforts. I did substitute 1 3/4 cups of the flour for strong brown bread flour and reduced the sugar. The 1st batch, I made 8 large rolls. Since then, I've made cinnamon rolls with half the dough (baked 10 min at 350 F) and a loaf with the other half (baked another 10 minutes after taking the cinnamon rolls out). All have met with rave reviews. The loaf holds up well in the toaster & makes great sandwiches. I may never purchase bread again!

This was delicious, especially eaten right from the oven.  I used White Lily bread flour for the first batch and all purpose flour for the second batch.  The White Lily bread flour made a huge positive difference.

Well I should have used less flour when rolling out the dough or brushed the rolls with melted butter because they were a bit "dusty" but they were still yummy! Will make again, and probably within the week. Pretty awesome!

These are super good and surprisingly not too sweet, just right. I used half whole wheat flour and halved the recipe as I only have a 1 lb bread machine. Fabulous!!!

I have made this dough several times and have made rolls, garlic bread sticks and cinnamon crescent rolls from it.  All have been a hit!  I use rapid rise (bread machine) yeast and my KitchenAid mixer...quick and easy!

Delicious! I do not have a bread machine, I used my kitchen aid stand mixer with the hook attachment mixed the warm water, milk, and sugar stirred with a spoon and then added the yeast, let it foam for 12 minutes added salt, eggs, butter then flour 1 cup at a time and scraped the bowl a lot to get all the flour incorporated. Plopped it onto my floured counter kneaded it a few times then oiled the bowl put it back in and covered with plastic wrap let it sit in the warm kitchen for 45 minutes, punched it down and divided it into 16 balls sprayed them with non-stick spray and put plastic wrap on top let them rise for another 45mins then spread them with butter baked at 375 for 11 minutes and let cool on a wire wrack and they are light and soft.

These rolls are fantastic. You don't need a bread maker either, just follow a standard bread making method of combining the liquids with the sugar in the bowl with yeast. Allow to foam for 15 mins and then add rest of ingredients, lastly gradually add the flour until a soft dough is achieved. Let rise 30 mins, knead, roll and make buns as per recipe. Allow to rise 1 hour, back at 200C for 10-15 mins until golden brown.    I even stuffed up and used self-raising flour instead of plain flour and they still came out fantastic!

I've made this recipe more times than I can count and it is always delicious.  My entire family loves it.  I've made regular rolls, crescent rolls, cinnamon rolls (although I do prefer the cinnabon clone recipe here more for those), rosemary rolls...the possibilities are endless!

FANTASTIC sweet bread dough!  I use half unbleached flour and half wheat flour and add a little extra sugar --- no bread machine -- all by hand.  I use this dough to make my "famous" pepperoni rolls -- I weigh out approximately 1 oz portions of dough, press flat  into an oval with my fingers, lay out a row of 5 slices of pepperoni, then roll up, tucking in the ends, and bake them seam side down after egg-washing until golden brown.  The combination of sweet dough with the spicy pepperoni is out of this world (always eat warmed in the microwave)!!!  But I ALWAYS save some of the dough to make my son some cinnamon rolls.  He LOVES them! I tie some dough into a little knot, spray with "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter," and generously dip in a mixture of cinnamon and sugar... no icing necessary with this dough.    THANK you for this recipe that I will use FOR LIFE!!!

This is now my official rolls recipe for nice holiday dinners!  PERFECT!  Makes great cinnamon rolls too.   I love how soft and buttery these are.   I throw all the stuff into my kitchenaid, knead with dough hook, and then I divide into 16 sections (after rising) and make them a gentle knot...brush with butter....then bake.  The recipe takes some time to rise so give it ample time...but wonderfully light and to die for!!!

Awesome!  I did not want to take out my bread maker, so I followed what another review did and mixed in my mixer and let rise an hour, punched down, separated into balls and let rise about 1/2 hour....turned out soft, and yummy.  I did make two changes, as I had some buttermilk that needed to be used, so substituted that for the milk and I ended up using about 3/4 cups of whole wheat flour because I ran out of allpurpose.  Still exellent.  Thanks for the great recipe

Great! Used 2 cups AP, 13/4 cup whole wheat flour. I'd like to try it with bread flour instead of AP. I'm not set that these are "the" rolls I will make, but they are definitely good! :) **UPDATE** I froze these rolls individually (wrapped in tin foil then put in a giant zip loc bag) to have on hand in a pinch. I HIGHLY recommend doing this--I feel they tasted better after being thawed (10 minutes at 250 in the tin foil). I turned some of them into garlic bread to add to my husband's meals, and some for sandwhiches. Very good!!

These are very good rolls.  And yes, they ARE sweet, they would make excellent cinnamon rolls so if you're looking for something to use as garlic bread or rolls, skip this one.  Great for danishes!

I just made these.  They were excellent!  The texture was even better than the store bought rolls.  I followed the directions exactly except I used bread flour.  I used the bread machine, and when I pulled out the dough, it was so light and airy.  I can tell this is a versatile dough that can have many uses.  Thanks for a great recipe!  This is definitely one that will be used again and again!

ok I am a guy and I was able to do this and they turned out delicious. 10 minutes was way too long to be in the oven but still edible. Somebody gave us the bread machine we have and I have no instruction manual so this is pretty much a grantee that it will turn out for any machine every time: first put the warm water and milk, mix the sugar then the yeast. Let it sit for 15 mins. Then add the rest of the ingredients. This way it always rises.

Delicious! I also, do not own a bread machine, but followed general directions for making bread... The only thing I added was about a tablespoon of rosemary (think Macaroni Grill). And I basted them with butter after they came out of the oven and sprinkled them with salt. It made them perfect!

This is my go-to roll recipe.  I veganize it by using almond milk, EnerG Egg Replacer, and Earth Balance for the butter.  It turns out great.  I make the dough into the shape of crescent rolls and find that baking them for 8 to 10 minutes is plenty, depending on the size of the roll.

delicious!!  Instead of rolling, I just made into 16 balls, let rise for an hour, and baked in a greased 9X13 pan for 15 minutes.  So good!

Oh good heavens!  These are just delicious. I had to make them two days in a row just to see if they would be as good the second time.  Then I made another batch and topped the rounds with brown sugar, cinnamon and crushed pecans before rolling!  I'm going to try this as dinner rolls with part multigrain flour next.  Excellent recipe that will now be a standard in my house.

These were really good, a little plain, but they turned out well.  Follow recipe exactly.  These would make good cinnamon rolls.  Makes a huge batch.

Absolutely wonderful dinner rolls!!  I made this recipe using my bread machine and the dough turned out perfect.  I did use a spoon to drop in flour into measuring cup so I didn't use too much flour (so the bread would rise properly).  I baked half the recipe and froze the other half.  I decided to make round dinner rolls.  To freeze the rolls I placed the round rolls on a flat surface in the freezer and allowed them to freeze.  Then I transfered them into a freezer safe container until ready to use.  Take rolls from freezer and allow to thaw and double in size.  Then bake.  I did bake the rolls at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes.

I love this recipe and I have been using it a long time now. I make rolls, cinnamon rolls and pizza dough with it. For the pizza dough leave out the sugar and add garlic and italian spices....makes a great pizza crust!

Excellent recipe!! Thank you so much. I use this recipe to make garlic bread as well - just add 3 cloves minced garlic and 1 teaspoon rosemary to dough, i braid it with 5 strands and brush with olive oil, and sprinkle with a tiny bit parmesan cheese, ground black pepper and a teensy bit dry oregano... it smells divine!!! see my photo!

These were so easy to make, I rolled them into 3 balls and put them in a muffin tin to get a 'roll' look to them, and it worked out perfectly. They ARE sweet, and would go great with some honey butter. I have 5 boys and a 6 1/2 foot tall husband, and making these helps stretch our food budget, and they love them!

I have used this recipe for all my bread needs. After the first rise I have rolled out, place Canadian bacon and sharp cheader cheese on top, rolled up, let it rise and baked. I have used it to make Bierocks (German Meat Turnovers) on this site and they turned out great.  I love this recipe and have been using it for years.

These are perfect! I divided into 12 balls and put them in the freezer. On Christmas morning I took them out and let them rise. Put in a 350º oven for about 15-20 minutes. Heavenly!

This recipe is a real keeper. My kids (16 & 23) were willing to wait an hour longer for dinner just to have these dinner rolls. The bread maker makes them easy. I didn't let them rise the second time for more than 30 minutes. They bake up in 9 minutes easy.

These were a hit at our Christmas dinner table.  I made them into crescent rolls as the directions stated and they turned out so great.  I never knew how easy it was to make my own bread, I'll definately be making these again really soon.

I made these for Thanksgiving this year, and my very picky stepfather said they were the best part of the meal! Thay were gone by Friday night, so I made another batch to take back to school with me. These are delicious, though I added a bit more sugar just to be sure.

I've made these rolls twice this week, once as a "practice run" since I've never made rolls before, and they turned out so good, I took them to my folks house for Thanksgiving yesterday.  Everyone loved them, and I will use this recipe over and over again!  I didn't change a thing, other than making them the old fashioned way since I don't have a bread machine.  I was so happy with them, I took a picture which I am uploading.  Thanks for this yummy recipe!

This is a keeper. The texture and flavor of these was as if they were bought from the local bakery and it was so easy. I made the dough two days ahead of Thanksgiving for the first time (without a bread machine) and refrigerated it.  I let the dough come to about room temperature and then formed balls instead of cutting and rolling it and I eliminated the second part of butter.  I then put them in 2 round cake pans and let them rise for about an hour then baked them for the same time and temp the recipe calls for.  We absolutely loved them.  I cannot believe I finally found a roll recipe I can make from scratch and be proud to serve them to guests.  Thanks Donna my search for the perfect roll recipe is over!

Made these last night by hand, it was pretty easy and very good. To eliminate yeast problems, just use a meat thermometer or a candy one and you won't have issues with the yeast not proofing.

I figured 24,000+ people couldn't be wrong. They weren't! I made these yesterday and had about 5 or 6 left over. This AM when DH got up to go hunting, he wiped out the leftovers with his coffee and left me a note saying he had re-heated them in the oven and they were just as good as when they were first made.  I didn't change a single thing and today will be a repeat performance when I make another batch of these truly delicious dinner rolls! Thanks so much , Donna, for sharing such a great recipe.

Most requested recipe from the bread machine, right up there with pizza dough :) I use 1/2 stick of butter (1/4 cup) in the dough and only 1 teaspoon of butter smeared on the dough circles, still has great buttery flavor and a few less calories. Thank-you Donna and Allrecipes for sharing this wonderful recipe!

These were so easy and good. I cut into 36 small pieces and made clover leaf rolls, (so pretty) I had some  dough left over so I used it to make 12 mini cinnamon rolls. My teenager loved em' and shared with all his buddies.

This is the Alpha and Omega of roll recipes.  I've been making bread for a long time and have sampled a great many recipes but his one is far and away the best.  I put it in my "Hall of Fame" recipe notebook.  You can make it as a loaf if you don't want to make rolls.

I have been baking for 25 years, and THIS is by far the EASIEST and BEST roll recipe I have ever tried.  My 4 fussy kids and hubby LOVED them.  I will be making them for Thanksgiving this weekend!! I did it the bread machine way and rolled it like crescents.FANTASTIC! I put all the ingredients in order of the way its listed here.

This recipe is very versatile and extemely forgiving!  I have made it several times now, adding different things such as herbs and/or cheese, rolled it into a variety of shapes and even had my bread machine lose a paddle and forget the cycle while making it, so it had to be removed and finished being kneaded by hand.  It tastes just as good with whole wheat as it does with white flour.  My mother, who trained as a chef, and always finds something wrong with anything I make, had nothing to say beyond: "Mmmmmm."  And then she ate three.  Thank you so much for such a great recipe!  I don't buy rolls anymore, since it only takes a trice to make these :)

I made these rolls for my boyfriend one night for dinner, and he couldn't get enough of them!  He's told me these are the only ones he ever wants me to make for dinner anymore.  Very easy and delicious!  I  like to brush them with egg white to make them a little shinier.

I made this recipe today and this was by far the best roll recipe I have tried to date.  I made it precisely as is even weighing my flour.  I thought that the dough was initially too wet however I just let the bread machine finish its cycle and the dough was perfect.  I lightly patted it out into a rectangle then cut into squares using a pizza cutter like a famous steakhouse.  I brushed them with melted butter before and after baking.  They were perfect!  Light, airy, slightly sweet and buttery.  I will keep this as my go to roll recipe!!!! Yum!

The best rolls!  And I like to make different types of bread and rolls.  These are my go-to rolls for any get together.  ALWAYS get comments and raves!  LOVE them, thank you Donna!
I make about 20 regular sized round rolls.

Thank you so much for such a versatile recipe!!  I sprinkled cheddar cheese and fresh jalapenos over the top and baked for 15 minutes.  Amazing!!!!!  A big hit with my mexican family.  I also made cinnamon rolls by rolling out the dough and spreading butter and cinnamon/sugar.  These also came out great!  I will definitely keep the dough on hand for even more variations!!

AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!!!!  Follow the recipe exactly and you'll get the best rolls ever.  I cooked them in a muffin pan and formed 3balls for a clover shaped roll and baked at 350 for about 15minutes.  I can't wait to try these as cinnamon rolls or monkey bread.

Wow, these are spectacular!  I followed KPRAPER's method of preparation, and then after the first rise, I took the idea from others about dividing them up into three balls and putting them in muffin cups.  Baked at 350F for 10 min.  Came out beautifully!  I made 72 of these for an event, and they were fantastic.  Quite easy to make, as well.  A wonderful dough - I really enjoyed working with it.  Definitely a keeper - can't wait to try them as cinnamon rolls!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are delish!! I used bread flour instead of all-purpose, and proofed the yeast with the water and sugar in the bread machine for 15 minutes. The first time I made them into clover-leaf rolls, the ones I'm making now I'll just put into a 9x13. The crescents seem like too much work. After forming, I let them rise in the oven, after heating it to 170 which is the lowest mine goes. I cover them with oiled wax paper and let them rise 1-1 1/2 hrs. I haven't had a problem with sticky dough or them not rising, but I have had to through out the yeast and start that again. If your yeast is no good, you'll end up with biscuits instead of rolls.*Update*I made them tonight as stated, with AP flour and they still turned out wonderful. Formed them into 16 dinner rolls to use for Super Bowl Bites.

I've never been a homemade roll person, but my husband is. I made these for Easter and everyone else raved, but I'm sure they weren't worth the work they took. I think Pillsbury would have done just as good of a job.

Fabulous rolls! I made them this past Easter and everyone said they were the best crescent rolls they ever tasted. I did brush the tops with melted butter before letting them rise. These make HUGE crescent rolls! Next time I will divide and cut each round into more pieces so the rolls will be smaller plus we will get more of the tasty gems! Oh, the leftover rolls make great sandwiches in place of bread!

I followed K PRAPER's suggestions and rolled out the dinner rolls in 2 oz. portions.  These were absolutey amazing!!  My dad said they reminded him of his youth, when his parents bought rolls from a bakery instead of the grocery store bread we're used to now.  Thanks for the delicious recipe and the useful comments from all reviewers.

PERFECTION at last!   I have tried to make a roll such as this for over 30 years.  I used 1 c whole wheat flour and rest white bread flour.  They were the lightest, tastiest rolls I have ever made.  I made 18 rolls in muffin tins.

I don't have a bread machine so I just mixed the dough let it rise for an hour and followed the rest of the recipe as written.  Everyone raved about the rolls.  I increased the recipe by 50% the second time to make 24 rolls and it turned out perfect again!  I LOVE this recipe!!!

I use my kitchenaid mixer to knead this rather than my bread machine, but these rolls are a huge hit with anyone who eats them.  They're no fail UNLESS you overcook them.  They can go pretty quickly from soft, moist, fluffy and amazing to just alright.  So just make sure you take them out as soon as they're golden.  This is also my "go to" dough for cinnamon rolls. They are AMAZING!!!

WOW! Perfect- light, soft, sweet, and addictive. I brushed mine with a mixture of cream, butter, and sugar while they were baking and it made the top sweet and shiny but still soft. I rolled these into balls and they took about 10 minutes longer to bake than the recipe said. I sifted the flour and used a tad more yeast than called for (because it had been sitting in the cupboard for a while and I wasn't sure about its freshness.) I think that contributed to the rolls being so feather-light. They had the perfect amount of sweetness and were so tender! My husband freaked out. I will keep this recipe forever. Yum, yum, YUM!  The total time it took to make these was three and a half hours- I just dumped all the items in the bread maker, 1 hour and 50 minutes in the breadmaker, 1 hour to rise, and then 25 minutes to bake. The actual hands-on time is extremely small, though- these were easy!

Excellent rolls! Instead of using a bread machine, I use my mixer.  Microwave milk and water for 1 minute and 15 seconds, dissolve sugar in warm water/milk mixture, add yeast and wait till it foams (about 5 minutes).  Then I add salt, butter and flour, mix, and knead in the mixer with dough hook for 7 minutes.  Let rise covered in a warm oven for about an hour.  I divide into 24 balls, let rise for another 30 minutes, brush with milk, and bake on my airbake cookie sheet at 400 for 15 minutes.  The rolls are so good especially while they are warm.  My husband and I can eat the entire batch.  So much for dieting, these are too good to resist! Definitely a keeper.

By far the BEST roll recipe I have ever made...reminds me of my grandmother's Portuguese sweet bread rolls.  I used organic bread flour instead of all-purpose flour and just made balls.  They turned out BIG and fluffy!  I make these twice a week for my family who demands them!

These are fabulous!  If you want to make them even better, brush the tops with butter when they come out of the oven, then roll them in this mixture: 1/4 cup of sugar and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  They are even better!

Yum! Yum! Yum!  I finally was able to make a good yummy roll!  I rolled the dough into small balls and put 3 in a well greased muffin pans.  I made 12 rolls that way and had 4 other just round rolls.  I can't believe how well these turned out!  I followed the recipe exactly except for the milk and water...I used 4 tsp of powdered milk and 1 cup of water.  It had just the right about of sweetness for us.  I baked them at 375 for 12 minutes.  The tops were brown and the bottoms just barely brown.  I think next time I will lower the temp to 350, so the bottoms can get more browned before the tops are done.  I will be definitely making these over and over again!!!

Wonderful! These turned out perfect. The only changes to the ingredients that I made was that I used bread flour instead of all purpose. When I took them out of the breadmaker, I made 12 rolls and put them in a 9x13 glass pan. Man, they got HUGE! They turned out so wonderful! They had a great flavor and everyone loved them.

I loved this recipe. I was looking for a good bread recipe and this one satisfied. I didn't have a bread maker so I used my Kitchenaid mixer to mix and let the dough rise for an hour before putting it in a loaf dish. I cooked it at 325 for 20 minutes and then turned it up to 350 for another 10 minutes to brown the top. One of the best homemade breads I've ever tasted!

Oh my word, these reviews do not lie!!!  These are bad bad bad!  Thankfully I immediately put half the batch in the freezer since there were only 4 of us.  I'm so glad I did because otherwise I probably would have polished off about 6 of them myself for dinner!    My only suggestion is that I thought the temp was a little high.  I put them on parchment paper and the bottoms were perfect but the tops started burning a bit toward the end and I had to cover them with a piece of foil.  Tonight I cooked the rest of them that I had frozen and forgot to use parchment paper and the bottoms got burned.  So...either use parchment and lay foil over them near the end if need be, or lower the temp a tad and cook a little longer.  These are definitely a KEEPER!!!

these were really good tasting however  I wonder if they really needed that much sugar.  Also, mine got really dark before they were completely done in the centers.  I cooked them at 350 degrees but maybe (since I wasn't using my own oven) the oven I was using must have run a little hot.  Thanks for the recipe.

I don't have a bread machine, and the 1st time I made these I didn't read the helpful reviews on how to convert the recipe to making it by hand. Big mistake! I wanted to try these again a couple days later because I knew they would be good if I could figure out how to do it by hand. Excellent bread, and thanks to the helpful reviews I was able to make a batch of delicious rolls and soft pretzels!

I love this roll recipe. So light and sweet. I tried making "clone of a cinnabon" from this web site and the bread isn't nearly as good as this. So now I use this as the bread for my cinnamon rolls and use the "clone of a cinnabon" recipe for the filling. I also made clover leaf rolls out of this and they turned out wonderful as well.

I made these for Christmas and they are wonderful.  I have been looking for the perfect soft and yeasty roll recipe and this is it!  I don't have a bread machine, but used my kitchenaid stand mixer.  I let it rise once, then rolled into balls and put in pans to freeze.  Christmas day I preheated the oven to 170 and shut off, then put the frozen rolls in to rise. After they doubled in size, I baked them at 350 for about 15 minutes-perfect!  I will be making kolaches and cinnamon rolls out of this dough soon!  Thanks, Donna!

BY FAR THE BEST ROLLS I HAVE EVER BAKED OR EATEN!
Follow K. Praper's directions if you are not using a bread machine.  I did roll them with butter.  They are light, fluffy, and smooth.  Even the dough was one of the, um, funnest doughs to knead.
I made these on a whim for our Christmas dinner and I am so glad I found them!

This is the best bread recipe ever.  Every time I make these rolls I get rave reviews - and this is coming from someone who has never had success with bread before.  I also use this recipe to make cinnamon rolls - just roll it out, put melted butter, sprinkle with cinnamon and brown sugar and (optional) nuts, then roll and cut.  Put in a pan and let them rise for another 45 minutes.  These are the best cinnamon rolls - everyone will be amazed you made them and yet they are actually really easy.

Absolutely wonderful! My h
usband said they reminded him of his grandmas. He said this recipe is a keeper.
I have made theses rolls several times and they always come out great. 
I recently made the rolls with Montana Wheat flour and splenda and they were wonderful. Just remember you need to add extra water when using wheat flour.

I just baked these for Thanksgiving dinner for a big crowd at my house and received RAVE reviews for these DELICIOUS rolls. These are HANDS DOWN the best dinner rolls I have ever tasted, and definitley DEFINITELY the best I have ever baked myself..and I'm a skilled bread baker. These have absolutely the most wonderful taste and best texture..you cannot go wrong with this recipe. I never would have thought a recipe that sounded this simple could turn out rolls so delectable! I typically look for more complicated roll recipes, only to be disappointed.  These rose PERFECTLY, baked perfectly, and eveyone seemed to want to only eat the rolls this year! I doubled the recipe and used 3 pkgs of yeast (1 1/2 times the recipe). I would advise using all the water and then add only as much flour as you need to make the dough elastic. I wound up using close to 1 c less flour for each batch.  I let the dough rise for a little more than an hour and used quick rise yeast. Also, I don't have a bread machine anymore, so I just warmed the milk & water, added the sugar and the yeast and let sit until foamy (abt 10 mins). Then added everything else, adding the flour last 1 c at a time. Covered with a damp dish towel and let rise. I rolled them into small balls and baked 2 balls together in muffin pans. FABULOUS and EASY!!

I really don't write reviews unless something is really amazing or really terrible. These rolls are the former. For those like me who don't have a bread machine and/or like to bake the traditional way, I suggest you follow 'K PRAPER's instructions (1st review on the recipe page). Just to be safe, I also reduced the temp to 375 like many others suggested and baked for 14-15 mins. I made balls instead of cresents. They came out PERFECT and I didn't even use exact measurements; just eyeballed everything because I was in a hurry. They were just as good the next day -- not hard or stale at ALL. Above all, this recipe is sooo quick and easy.

I have the following advice for those who said the rolls are too dense: 1. Be sure to sift the flour, this is an often overlooked crucial step in baking, 2. After you've added the initial 3 cups, add the rest a little at a time and stop when the dough is no longer sticky. You may not end up needing all the flour. I only ended up using about 3 1/4 cups. 3. You MUST let it rise TWICE -- once before rolling out the dough, and then another 45 mins - 1 hour (minimum) after you have formed your rolls. 5. Don't serve immediately. As much as I love em nice and hot out of the oven, they need time to settle so give it a few mins.

I mixed the water and milk, heated it to 110 degrees in the microwave, stirred in the sugar until it dissolved, then stirred in 2.5 teaspoons of quick rise yeast from a jar. After it got foamy (about 10 minutes), I poured it in the bowl of my Kitchen Aid stand mixer and added the egg, butter (salted), and ½ teaspoon salt. Next I added 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 2 cups of bread flour a half cup at a time, mixing with the dough hook attachment until a soft, yet slightly tacky dough formed. Then I let the mixer knead the dough on low for about 4 minutes. Next I removed the dough hook, formed the dough into a ball, sprayed the dough and inside of the bowl with cooking spray, covered the bowl with the dough inside of it with plastic wrap, and let the dough rise for about 45 minutes. Then I removed the plastic wrap, punched down the dough, divided it into 18 balls (1.7 ounces each), evenly distributed them among two lined 9-inch round cake pans, covered the pans with plastic wrap, let the dough rise for another 45 minutes until the sides of the dough balls started to touch, removed the plastic wrap, then baked for 15 minutes at 350 degrees.

Thanks to all the reviews, used the bread machine version of the recipe, and made into 27 rolls.  It was a hit, and the rolls stayed fresh even several days after baking (reheat in microwave).  Great w/ cinnamon-honey butter.  A keeper!

This is a fantastic and easy recipe.  I made the dough while cooking dinner - and for once followed the recipe exactly.  Used the dough to make cinnamon/apple/cranberry rolls and just plain sweet rolls as we were eating dinner.  Had incredible desert - the dough is perfectly light, fluffy, just the right sweetness for cinnamon rolls. Will be making these over and over again.

These are the best tasting buns I have ever made or tried.  The problem I had is that they were so dense and heavy.  It is very humid here and possibly that is the problem.  I am driving myself crazy trying to make light fluffy buns.

A-MAZING!!! I made it in my bread machine on the dough cycle as stated. I was nervous because I only had rapidrise breadmachine yeast, but it worked great! Nice big rolls but light. I put the dough in my muffin tin and baked them and they came out perfect.  I also took the last of the dough that didn't fit in the tin and made a few cinnamon rolls.  I will definitely use this recipe from now on! Note: I baked mine at 350 instead of 400 for 10 minutes.

These were good. Very easy to make, however, the rolls I usually make are gobbled up faster than you can blink, these...they didn't even eat half of them.

I absolutly loved these, and so did my family.  The only change I made was that I used bread flour instead of regular flour.  The leftover rolls are wonderful to make chicken salad sandwiches with too.  I will me making this one over and over!

We really enjoyed these rolls!  The day I made them we had a cool front come through so I ended up having to put them in the laundry room, turning on the dryer and closing the door but they did rise well.

So I made this dough for a second time and used it to make cinnamon rolls.  I rolled the dough out, spread with butter and sprinkled with 1 1/4 cup brown and 4 t. cinnamon, rolled it up and cut it with dental floss.  On 1/3 I also sprinkled raisins.  They rose for 1 hour and then baked at 350 for ~12 minutes.  I made a frosting by combining:  6 oz cream cheese, 6 T. butter, 2 t. vanilla, and 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar.  They were fantastic.  My husband took a bunch to work and got rave reviews.  Super easy.  Next time I'll try to make the cinnamon filling more gooey, but they were awesome as is.

These are AWESOME!  I brush with butter right before baking (instead of before rising - makes the towel I cover them with while rising messy) and they turn out great.  My search for the perfect homemade roll is over!

Delicious, they were gone within about 30 minutes of being removed from the oven. Next time I make these I need to work out how to keep everyone's little fingers from my kitchen....

Very yummy! I added 1-1/2 cups of mozzerella cheese, and 1 tablespoon of dried onions. I made round rolls as well as crescent rolls. I put them in for 12 minutes, and they turned out darker than I hoped. I took them out 2 minutes before the time was up. So make sure you keep an eye on them. Other than the color, they are soft, chewy, and delicious! I will make these again.

These rolls were wonderful!  They were soft and tasty.  Very easy to make.  My bread machine did most of the work.  I will use this recipe in the future!

For Memorial Day, I thought I would make rolls and dessert in one step. I split the dough in half when it came out of the bread machine. The first half I made into 12 of the crescent rolls, baking for 11 minutes. The second half I rolled into a rectangle, spread a mixture of 1 cup brown sugar, 2/3 cup melted butter, and 2 teaspoons cinnamon on top, then rolled up and sliced into cinnamon rolls. The rolls took 17 minutes to bake in a round cake pan. I inverted the pan onto a pie plate and frosted with a basic powdered sugar, butter,, vanilla, and milk frosting. The family loves them! They said they were the best cinnamon rolls they ever had.

Very good - even better eaten the next day.  We all found these a tad too sweet so will cut back on the sugar slightly next time.  I did substitute 3/4 cup whole wheat flour.

OUTSTANDING! I made these this weekend in my kitchen aid, and the results were a ligth fluffy, sweet roll. The flavor reminds me of potato rolls. Normally I have rolls let over, but not this time my family have already plained out Sunday dinner which will include these rolls. I just mixed all the wet ingredients together except for the water, yeast and 1/2 teaspoon of sugar which I proofed my yeast in, and added the flour..yes the dough is sticky and i used a little more than the 3 3/4 cups listed in the recipe, but i only added extra flour a tablespoon at a time until i was able to handle the dough but still a little sticky. I will Never look for another bread recipe!!!!

These rolls were pretty good. Make sure you allow the dough to rise for the whole two hours (for those w/out a bread machine). I also found that it tastes much better if you roll the dough out very thin. I was surprised the final product wasn't sweeter. I may increase the sugar next time.

I made these rolls today for Christmas dinner and did everything in the world wrong.  I started to mix, knead, etc., then changed my mind and used my bread machine.  The time for dinner changed because the entree was done earlier than I expected.  All said and done, these rolls turned out great.  I will definitely make them again.  Worth making and definitely worth the five star rating!!

These are good, but if you're expecting crescent rolls like Pillsbury, these aren't it. They really expand to become very large; I cut small sheaths to roll up & they made a perfect crescent roll size.

These were fabulous, and I am not a baker (hence, the bread machine).  I'm not usually a fan of the bread machine bread (something about the crust is off), but will probably use it for dough a lot more in the future.  These rolls rose perfectly, and were beautiful and slightly sweet. Was going to save some for my husband, but the kids ate them all before he got home!  I can't wait to make cinnamon rolls with this recipe (We'll give my mother-in-law a run for her money!  Muahahahah!)

I wasn't in love with this recipe.  I expected something with more flavor and a smoother texture than this.  I've made this twice now and both times the rolls were barely touched.  I won't be making these again.  I'm sure there is a better recipe.

These rolls were AMAZING! I was looking for something similar to the rolls served at a steakhouse chain and these are it! I followed the recipe exactly, except I made rolls instead of crescents and brushed them with honey butter before and after putting them in the oven.  The dough was easy to work with and turned out nice and light. I don't want to admit how many I ate straight from the oven!

I have been using this recipe for years and every. single. time. I make it everyone raves over how delicious they are and how hard they must have been to make! What they don't know is that these are the easiest and simplest rolls to make which is what a 5 star recipe should be.

Wow!  These were beautiful and delicious.  My husband said they picture-perfect and were the best rolls he has ever had.  I think the only thing that could make them even yummier is a coating of honey butter after taking them out of the oven.  They are so soft and quite large.  Thank you for an excellent recipe!

A great soft bread. I did follow the ingredients exactly,and it turned out very nice. I didn't feel like making crescents, so I rolled it out into one big square and spread the middle with butter, and rolled that up jelly roll style.  Then I just put it on a cookie sheet to rise and threw that in the oven to bake. I put three long diagonal slits in the top before putting it in the oven.  Turned out really nicely.

Fantastic rolls!  What a great way to make bread, and so easy too.  I used half the dough for dinner rolls and half for cinnamon rolls, baked them when my SO was napping, he said it was the best smell to wake up to!

I have already made these rolls twice this week.  They have been a really big hit.  I don't have a bread maker so I just mixed the ingredients in my Kitchen Aid stand mixer and then on a floured counter top kneaded the dough until it was smooth.  After letting it rise for about an hour in an oiled bowl, I followed the rest of the recipe and shaped the rolls.  They rose again and baked up so soft and delicious.  I'm sure I will make these many more times (probably just in the next couple of weeks!!).

These are wonderful!  I needed a recipe for dinner rolls for a family Easter party and these are perfect.  I cooked mine in a 13x9 pan because I like the soft sides.  

I also turned some into Easter rolls.  You roll dough around a marshmellow, brush with butter and lightly sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar.  Bake for the same amount of time.  They cook up hollow or empty like Christ's tomb.

Great rolls! Nice and soft with just the right amount of sweetness. I usually use 1/2 of the recipe for dinner rolls and the other 1/2 for sweet rolls. That way we don't have too much of either one left over. I have made this recipe several times. My family demands that I use this recipe.

As usual, I didn't have all the right ingredients but these turned out wonderfully!  I don't have a bread machine, so I kneaded by hand, but it was easy.  Only comment: on my oven the temp was too hot and the rolls got a bit too brown.  Next time, I'll watch more closely.

I cannot say enough about these rolls...  The first time I made these I kneaded the dough with my hands.  When I made them most recently, however, I used my bread machine.  Both methods produced perfect rolls.  I think I'll turn the remaining dough into cinnamon rolls as many others have.

Excellent recipe.  I put everything into my bread machine and added a little more milk and sugar and the taste was awesome.  We ended up eating them all.  I will definetly be making again.

I made this recipe without a bread machine (sort the reviews by most helpful to find out how) and used the dough in the Monkey Bread II recipe.  I had enough for the Monkey Bread and some buns which I froze (I haven’t baked those yet). Amazing!!! My husband couldn't stop raving about them. Melt in your mouth out of the oven and still soft and delicious the next day.  Thank you for this recipe!!

This recipe was very good. I used whole wheat instead of all purpose flour. I think next i will use half wheat and half regular flour. They were a little to wheaty.

Well this was my first time making bread, so I am pretty darn happy with myself and those rolls!  I do not have a breadmaker, so I combined the wet ingredients with the yeast (as another reviewer suggested) and then mixed in the rest of ingredients and then kneaded the dough by hand.  Not sure what happened, but I did not need to let the dough rise for longer than 15 minutes the second time - they were already huge!  Next time I might add a little more sugar for a tad more flavor, but these were yumm-o!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

I made the dough in the bread machine like the recipe instructed, but baked it in the oven in two bread loaf pans.  The bread came out really tasty and light.

YUM!!! We love it! I also used this recipe to make cheeseburger rolls (roll out little balls of dough, top with seasoned browned ground beef and cheese, place another rolled out ball of dough on top and seal the edges then bake the same way.) Very tasty bread!! It sure didnt last long in this house.

This has become my official roll recipe.  I get tons of compliments every time. I always substitute half whole wheat flour, and don't usually use any butter except that which is included in the dough.

These rolls are excellent.  I have made it a few times and tried different things.  I suggest following the recipe.  I added some honey and couldn't tell the difference.  I also tried making it in the bread machine and in a mixer.  The bread machine batch were noticably fluffier.  I also tried making as cresents, in a muffin tin and in a casserole dish.  I preferred the muffin tin and casserole dish.  I also seperated them into 24 pieces, rolled them into balls, put them in the tin or dish, then let rise.  They only needed to rise for 30 minutes.  I then heavily brushed on the butter.  Cooking time seemed about the same.  The rolls in the tin did brown faster on the bottom, so maybe lower the temperature if you do it that way.  Everyone raved and thought they were from a bakery.

WONDERFUL RECIPE! and very versatile too! I made it 3 times so far - and once was for a church potluck - people loved it! I changed a few things... oil instead of butter, and 1 cup milk instead of 1/2 water... I also found the dough too dry at 1st so added about 1/3cup water.  I used 2tsp bread machine yeast instead of the packet... a lot cheaper. I also didn't use that last bit of butter for brushing on top. This recipe is EASILY adapted to whole wheat.. one of the times I substituted 3 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 1 tbsp vital wheat gluten flour... This will be my basic bread recipe from now on.

These are amazing, and so simple to make!  We ate them as dinner rolls, then I made the dough again, flattening out the dough balls and wrapping them around small smoked sausage links with cheese.  I baked them for the same amount of time, and got these wonderful sausage and cheese stuffed rolls that the kids and hubby just couldn't get enough of!  Thanks for the versatile recipe, can't wait to put them on the table for Thanksgiving!!

These were so good that I had to make these again on the next day!!  This time, I used them for cinnamon rolls.  Light, fluffy, my husband is not a cinnamon roll fan and ate two of them! I made a second batch and made sandwich rolls/hamburger buns.  We had them for  lunch with roasted turkey and avacado.  Out of this world!

These were the best dinner rolls I've ever made.  I used the dough cycle on my bread machine to do the mixing and rising for me.  I then shaped them into traditional rolls, let rise, and baked as directed.  I'm sure these would be good with the extra butter rolled into the dough...maybe I'll try that next time.

This is one of the best recipes that I have ever done.  It never fails to get rave reviews from those who get to take a bite.  Also, it is soooooo easy anyone can make it.  I make them up and freeze the rolls and then have them for whenever; Pot Lucks, Seminar dinners, company, just a couple for me.

Awesome, awesome!  My husband's first response was "the taste like sugar."  They were too sweet for him, but I loved them.  With the leftover rolls, I covered with a sugar glaze to make a sweet roll - this was really good.  I also tried it with half wheat and half white flour and I was very pleased with the results - still slightly sweet and very soft.  I have also used this recipe to make donouts and they turned out very tasty!!  Just roll the dough out into the shape you desire for you donout after the first rise then let rise a second time, fry in hot oil for about 4 minutes and cover with a sugar glaze.

This recipe was got rave reviews from my family (especially my 10 year old son).  I made this recipe last night and tonight.  Last night I followed the recipe as directed and they were very flat (very flavorful - but no rise).  I made them again tonight and tonight I used bread flour instead of all-purpose and added about 1/4 cup as suggested below and also I used about 1/2 Tbsp butter on each round instead of 2 Tbsp and they rose perfectly and still had a great buttery flavor.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was first time making homemade rolls from scratch.  They tasted wondeful, I dont have a bread maker so I did as others instructed and they turned out beautifully.  I actually forgot the egg, but they still turned out good, they just didnt rise as much as they should have and were a little chewy, but were still all eaten up before the night was over!  Will definately make again!!

These rolls are simple and delicious! I like to make them by hand. They always come out great, dense or fluffy.  The rise on this dough is very forgiving and makes for a good roll no matter what your time frame. Put on a little egg wash before you bake them to give them an extra pop of delicious color.

I don't have a bread maker but these still turned out great.  My kids can't get enough of them.  If I have some on hand they eat thym like snack food.  They also make wonderful cinnamon rolls.

Excellent recipe. Followed it w/o any modifications. I also experimented a bit. This dough is great for pigs in a blanket. I also stuffed these rolls with pepperoni and mozzarella cheese. Yummy!

First of all, I don't have a bread machine so this could completely be user error, but these didn't seem all that great.  I will try again once I get one and review again to be fair.  Sort of bland

Awesome recipe!! You could tell the rolls were going to puff up a lot after rolling them up and letting them rise some more! I've never made any buns or bread that were so light before!

Edited: I've made cinnamon buns with this recipe by mixing butter and brownsugar/cinnamon and spreading it on the dough then rolling up 1 inch strips to make the buns. They disapeared fast!

This is my first time using the bread machine for preparing dough.  It is so convenient, especially since I have a cool kitchen.  This is a wonderful recipe even though I modified it some.  I used 2-1/2 cups white bread flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup potato flakes.  I also added 1 tsp. Italian Seasoning and I made 15 rolls in a 9x13 pan.  I baked it for 15 minutes at 350 and then brushed the rolls with melted butter and baked for another five minutes.  Wonderful recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing!

Made it tonight for Thanksgiving dinner. I forgot to pick up pillsbury and didn't want to go to the market on this crazy day.  Yummy and quick in the bread machine.  I missed the first cycle so I picked up the dough somewhere before the end of the 2nd cycle.  I made balls and put them into a pie pan without adding the 2nd helping of butter, let it rise for another .5 hr and stuck it in the oven. It was WONDERFUL.  Even my toddler liked it and she's not a bread eater.

Delicious!  This was the first time I tried make rolls with the bread machine and they came out perfectly! It was so easy too.  Many of the reviews used the word "pillowy" and that's a perfect description. I'll definitely make these rolls again.

These rolls taste much better than what you would get at any restaurant.  I love these.  They are so delicious and they freeze well so you can pop them in the oven or microwave. Don't make the mistake I made the 2nd time around.  Always use real butter.  Any other substitute distorts the rich taste.

This is one of the most terrific roll recipe I have ever tried. And I've looked and looked. Everyone loves it and both of my teenage boys had to master it so they never have to wait on me to make them. Superb!

I was planning to make these for Thanksgiving and decided to try them tonight to make sure they were company quality -- in my opinion they were not -- but I am a pretty picky baker. I made these exactly as written and had no problems.  The dough was wonderful to work with, and the recipe was simple, but these were not as wonderful as I'd expected.  I guess I had high hopes for these because of the rave reviews and although they taste great with some butter and jam I will probably not use this recipe again (although I bet it'd make wonderful cinnamon rolls).   My husband gave me this "sorry you took so long to make these, they really aren't that great..." look and my mother had about the same opinion.  She did comment that they tasted like Bob Evans Restaurants' dinner rolls -- which I'd have to agree with, so if those are your favorite you'll love this recipe.

Made these in my bread machine today.  They knocked my socks off!!  However, 400 is too hot, so first pan was burned on bottom.  Turned oven to 375 and baked the second pan for 12 minutes.  They were absolutely delicious!!  Even the burned ones were good -- cut off the burned bottoms, and they were delicious!!  They make big soft croissant shaped rolls -- may just make them into a pan roll next time.  And the next time will be soon!!  Hubby ate almost half the recipe!!  He will have a tummy ache for sure from eating all that bread!!  Said he could not stop they were so good!!!

Absolutely delicious!  I made 8 very large crescent rolls with one half of the dough, and 9 cinnamon buns with the other half.  If you prefer smaller crescent rolls (like Pillsbury size), I would suggest rolling the dough out larger/thinner and cutting into 16 wedges instead of 8.

The best rolls I've ever had!  Don't change a thing.  They taste great and are easy to make.  The only word of caution is to be prepared to make more than one batch as they disappear in minutes:-)

Everything good said about this recipe is ABSOLUTELY TRUE.  My family noticed the improvement on the first bite.  It has replace my previous "favorite" dinner roll recipe and will be made over and over again.  I followed the recipe exactly as printed and they were so good.  I'm going to make them for company tomorrow night.

I just made this bread last night and it was fantastic!! I made sure to buy fresh bread flour and especially yeast since the one I had in the fridge expire sometime last year. It was so light and fluffy. My husband loves bread and wanted to know when I would make some so I decided to try this receipe and I am glad that I did. I heated the milk, water and butter in the microwave and then I added the egg. My bread machine doesn't always mix well but this time when I checked it was mixed and rose really nicely.

Very yummy, not too sweet -- just perfect for my taste. I stuffed the dough with chocolate chips and cubed cheese; they came out wonderful. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe. I will make these again in the future.

Deliciously buttery and slightly sweet-- reminded me of King's Hawiian bread. However, they had a much coarser texture than I had expected; perhaps the dough was over-beaten. I look forward to trying again! Thanks!

Yum, Yum, Yum.  These were so tender and soft.  I don't have a bread machine so I had to make them the old fashioned way.  I had a recipe in a cook book that had the same ingredients so I followed that for the prep.  Then I came back to this recipe for rolling out and shaping them.  They're great.

I've been using the same dinner roll recipe for the past three years and I've always thought it was great, but I found out the hard way last Easter that they don't transport well and they taste mediocre the next day.  So, I thought I would try this one for a dinner at my sisters.  Well, this is my new dinner roll recipe!  I made 32 rolls instead of 16, and hubby and I ate 10 of them right out of the oven last night.  They were light, fluffy, and the crust was so soft, not tough or hard.  The sweetness was just right, not bland at all like others here have said.  Even better, the rolls were just as good the night after, warmed up in the oven.  I kept them covered in the fridge overnight and they were raved about at dinner.  My daughter begged me to make these from now on!  My oven tends to be on the hotter side, so I baked them at 350F for about 15 minutes.  They were perfect!  Thanks!

What a great recipe! The versatility is endless.  I followed the recipe as given, but can see where ultimately I can do so much with it. My husband has childhood memories of "clover rolls"-sweet, buttery dinner rolls-which always accompanied holiday meals. This is sooooo close. My family absolutley loves them. We've got a winner! Thank you so much. rkm

Not very light, not very sweet. Standard roll fare. This recipe is similar to many other basic roll recipes I've seen. Albeit versatile, not amazing by any means.

Excellent, easy to make rolls. My 6 year old says they are the bestest rolls in the world!!!! They are best fresh from the oven, but you can warm them in the microwave wrapped in a damp paper towel, and they taste just as great.

For sure the best and easiest rolls I've ever made. I served them with smoked salmon and vegetables and they were so soft and had just the right amount of sweetness. They take a little bit of time to make, but if I have time, I definantly want to make them again.

I have made this several times and it always turns out excellent.  I just shape the dough into balls and bake in muffin tins.

This is the best recipe.It's so versatile; I've used it for dinner rolls, cinnamon buns, sandwich bread, and raisin bread. There's no limit to how to use this dough.

Very very good.  I just divided into 24 rolls and baked without the butter.  A great yeast roll!  I will make this time and time again.

I give this three stars because they are called sweet rolls but are very bland.  You'll be disappointed if you make these as is expecting something sweet.  They are like crescent rolls with no flavor.

I tried these for my Christmas eve dinner and it was a big success.  I didn't use the 1/4 C butter that it says to melt and spread before rolling since we try to watch our diet but they came out great.  Light and airy.  Everyone was amazed they were made in the bread machine.

Perfect rolls! My family loves these rolls. I make them in the bread machine so I don’t have to worry about over or under kneading the dough. I’ve even thrown them in the oven without a second rise and they still rose in the oven beautifully and were tasty. These always disappear quickly.

I made these for Thanksgiving. Followed the recipe as written. However I wanted round rolls. I took a chance and spooned out the best I could with the dough onto a cookie sheet. Yes they looked like a mess and very sticky. I allowed them to rise when finished rising I put them in the oven. They were fluffy and perfectly round. This is by far the best recipe for rolls!!

Made in the kitchenaid ike the first reviewer suggested, I warmed the milk and water together in the microwave.  I stirred the warm liquid into the mixing bowl with the sugar.  Sprinkled the yeast on top and allowed to foam for 10 minutes.  Added the butter, eggs and salt. After all the flour was mixed in I replaced paddle attachment with dough hook and kneaded for 8 minutes (scraping down after 5 minutes) . Let the dough rise in the covered bowl for 45 minutes. Scoop sticky dough out onto floured counter. Divided the dough into 16 pieces and placed 8 rounds into two pie pans.  Rise for another hour loosely covered with saran wrap. Baked @ 325F for 15 mins- my oven runs hot.  Will make these again and again. Too easy.

These rolls are my family's favorite accompaniment to any nice meal.  I follow the recipe exactly when it comes to ingredients. As a tradition, my children roll out small balls of dough to create Cloverleaf Rolls.  Place three dough balls into each greased muffin cup, and cover for an hour, allowing rolls to double in size.  Then, brush with butter, and bake at 375 for 10-12 minutes.

Super easy to make! I followed the directions exactly and made these crescent rolls for Thanksgiving.  They rose during the 2 hour car ride, plus more at the house. I underestimated how much they would rise, though.  As written, the recipe makes 16 rolls. But they are very good size rolls!  Next time, I definitely  need to split them onto two pans. Taste wise, I didn't think these were too sweet at all,  but I imagine they would be perfect for  cinnamon rolls! Huge, fluffy rolls - I must make these again!

I was a little wary of the consistency of the dough, as it was very "cookie dough" like and unlike the typical bread or pizza dough I had ever worked with before.  The first rise didn't elevate as much as I expected it to within an hour, but I still proceeded to simply punch it down to about a 12" square and cut 12 equal square pieces using a pizza cutter.  I spaced them equally apart in a buttered cast iron skillet, and allowed them to rise again for approximately 3 hours before baking in a 350F oven.  THEY WERE AMAZING and everyone loved them!  I will definitely try this recipe again, as the dough is extremely easy to work with and I can completely understand the ease in forming crescent shapes or even cinnamon rolls.

I found this recipe last weekend and  already have made them three times by request.  These are delicious, I just used the microwave directions since I do not own a bread machine.  Let me add this is my first time making bread and without a bread maker.  If I can do it, anybody can.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I used instant yeast and followed the directions for no bread maker. They came out thicker and heavier than I liked.  I allowed extra rising time to ensure a light and tender dough.  It's possible that I may have overworked the  dough and added to much flour when kneading. I will try these again using  regular yeast. I will also add a little more salt, they were sweet but sort of bland otherwise. The recipe is worth trying again.  
Update:  I tried this recipe again, I wanted to make cinnamon rolls.  I switched  my flour to bread flour, I used old fashioned flechmen  yeast, and I let the dough rest for ten minutes after I removed from mixing bowl, knead for only 5 minutes without adding additional flour. Since I was making cinnamon rolls, I added 1 teaspoon on vanilla extract before I added the flour. I let dough rise in warm oven for second rising.  I made a cream cheese frosting using only enough conf sugar to fluff. I didn't want tooth hurting rolls,  I also added nuts to the filling (brown sugar, cinnamon, butter) They were phenomenal!  So much better second time around!

These are phenomenal rolls. Incredibly simple even with out a bread machine.  They are my go-to recipe for everything now.  I obviously am joining the chorus of approval.  I don't have a bread maker so I modified the method to my Kitchen aid mixer.  I'm not sure if others have given instruction on how they did that, but I did the following:
I mixed the milk and water, heated up and added the yeast to bloom for 10 minutes.  Meanwhile I placed all the wet ingredients (minus the 1/4 cup butter) plus sugar into a the mixer and mixed. In a separate bowl mixed all the dry ingredients together.  After 10 minutes of the yeast mixture in the milk and water, I then I added it to the mixing bowl and mixed well.  Once mixed, I switched from the paddle to the dough hook, added the dry ingredients and mixed on medium speed for 2-3 minutes until dough was elastic.  Removed the hook, covered the bowl with plastic wrap and allowed the dough to rise for 30-60 minutes or until dough was at least double.  After that, I punched down the dough, briefly knead the dough and roll it out, cutting it into equal portions to form into balls (about the size of a golf ball or smaller) and placed into a buttered pan (1/4 C butter). Cover pan with a towel and allow it to rise for one hour, then bake.  They are phenomenal EVERY TIME.  I think for the Holiday season, I may turn this dough into cinnamon rolls-I'm positive those will be excellent too.

These are very good, however I think rolling the dough out takes a lot of unnecessary time. Instead I sprayed a muffin tin with cooking spray and dropped three dough balls in each to make clover rolls. I do put a little butter between the ball before cooking. My kids like these because they can pull them apart. It saves a bunch of time and the rolls are just as good. A fun thing to do if you have kids make one roll with 4 balls and see who gets the lucky 4 leaf clover. Even my teens get excited if they are the ones to find it.

This was my first time making dinner rolls and they were wonderful, everyone loved them.  Since I don't have a bread machine I followed some of the other reviews and mixed the dough with a Kitchen Aide mixer using the dough hook. I made my rolls a little smaller and ended up with about 24 rolls.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

These are awesome! No more work than a usual, from scratch dinner roll....but well worth every second anyway! :) These always get eaten up quickly. Have been making them for years. Always the star of the show at holiday meals with family (sorry turkey) and I get asked months in advance if I'm making them ;)

This dough is fantastic. I substituted bread flour for AP and let the machine do the rest. Baked 2 loaves of the best bread I've eaten in a while. This will be my go to recipe.

It's really awesome! And so easy to make that I bake it 2-3 times a week. With 3 young kids, there's no time to shape them into croissants. I just pinch and roll the dough into small balls and bake them in mini-muffin tins for 12mins. Turns out these mini muffin rolls were the perfect size for my little troopers!!

I made these rolls for Christmas Eve.  I had never tried this recipe before so was taking a chance for my party of 40+ but they did not disappoint!  I gave the rolls plenty of time to rise, and baked them just as our feast was ready to begin.  They were fluffy and delicious.  I look forward to making them again.

I have a bread maker and it's a great receipe.. also the ounces converted is 1.5 TSP of yeast.

The rolls taste perfect! I do not use the rise mode in my breadmaker, instead I use a mini fan heater I have from walmart that was around 15 bucks.

 I personally could see adding a little more sugar.. it's all about personal taste. Other than that; love the rolls! The recipe was easy and my 2 year old loved them! I paired them with a spread; butter, cinnamon, and sugar.

I made these for Thanksgiving and they were a smash hit! I don't have a bread maker so I followed the review for the old fashioned way, but otherwise kept it original. I am getting into yeast dough, and to have such success was encouraging. (I tripled the batch and they still came out fabulous!)

For some reason these were good - but not stellar.  I will keep looking for a roll recipe or maybe just try again - yeast breads can be so finicky.  My family liked them - they just didn't love them.

I have never tried another roll recipe since I found these years ago! They're not only delicious but forgiving of mistakes and adjustments. I've made them in a bread maker and by hand, and the former was better, but they were great both ways! Unless it's Thanksgiving, I cut the butter and sugar each to 1/8 C - 1/4 C to save calories. I use mostly honey for the sugar, filling the measuring cup about 3/4 full with honey before filling the rest with white sugar. They get more rise when I proof the yeast for about 10 minutes with a bit of sugar and the water BEFORE it goes into my bread maker and also if I add vital wheat gluten. They're delicious when using white whole wheat flour, too!

I couldn't stop smiling when these came out of the oven. I cannot believe I was able to make these rolls! I almost followed the recipe to the T except I used self-rising flour (it's all I have in hand) and left out the salt since it already has salt. Brushed with butter before serving. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you, Donna!

Excellent, I even brushed melted butter on the rolls before I baked it & again once it was done baking  & kept it in the oven for another 5 minutes but turned the oven off. Family and friends love it. Its airy and buttery tasting and I don' t have to use bread flour. Thank you,  this recipe is a keeper.

Super recipe, will make again! Used kitchen aid mixer and proofed yeast.  Then added the rest of the wet ingredients and added the dry ingredients on top in 3 batches mixing in between.  Worked perfect!

I have to make this recipe the old fashioned way because I don't own a bread maker but I use the portions exactly as stated in the recipe and these are a hit. My family loves them. Loves them. Loves them. Loves them!!

I know I am not a great baker, but if you make something four times, you are bound to get something correct. I've followed each direction, step by step. I have no idea what I am doing wrong My bread isn't rising, they are heavy, and I can not cook them all the way without them burning. I give up. This is my last try, I'll never be making this again.

I am writing as I'm making this....
I heated the milk, water and sugar...I put in the Mixer, let it cool a little. Then added the salt mixed and then yeast! let proof 10 minutes...Then added the egg and butter, mixed with whisk attachment. Then I changed to hook attachment and added the flour 1.5 cups at a time, then 3/4 cups. Mixed. Took out and knead for a while. Then put in oiled bowl and let rise. I did this late, so I went to bed and the next morning....Nice and poofy! doubled in size...
Punched down, rolled in little rolls and put one ball in each small tin cupcake pan. Then I used the other half to make cinnamon rolls, which by the way, I've been wanting to do forever!!!! Let everything rise again (double in size). Baked the rolls for 15 minutes at 350 degrees. On half I sprinkled herbs and the other half, nothing, just sprayed PAM on both. These are tender little balls of goodness, very simple. Surprisingly, I prefer the ones without the seasoning. Maybe it's because they're a tad sweet. The cinnamon rolls I baked for 15-20 minutes at 350 degrees also. I'm very pleased with both! I will definitely make these again!!!! Yummy!

Very good.  Made for Christmas dinner yesterday.  I used the traditional method as I don't have a bread machine anymore - it died.  I have made this recipe in the past using the bread machine.  Both ways yield great results.  My 8 wedge-cut rolls turned out large - next time I may cut more wedges out of the circle.  Also the leftover "crescents" cut in half lightly toasted with butter and cinnamon sugar are so tasty!  My daughter and I enjoyed some of the leftover rolls like that today for a snack.

I found this recipe on here sometime ago and I make them allot!  They stay nice and soft, if they last that long and everyone raves about them. It is also a great dough for Cinnamon buns, I always make this in my bread maker on the dough cycle.

Awesome recipe. I didn't use a bread machine, but followed others suggestions for eliminating that.  Everyone loved these rolls. It's almost sad that other menu items get short shrift for compliments when these rolls are being served.

Delicious!  Not too difficult to make either.  I don't have a bread machine, but mixed the dough in a large container and let it rise for about 1.5 hours, then followed the rest of the instructions.  Thank you!

I can only echo all of the other wonderful comments.  I took the advice of some others and used bread flour instead of all purpose.  The result was light, tender, TASTY rolls.  I chose to do clover style rolls in a muffin tin. Only took 12 min at 375 degrees.  YUMMY!

Like the others, I also do not have a bread machine, they're a waste. I like the old fashioned way. Yeast added to warm water & milk (I use bulk yeast 2 1/2 tsps.). Then I added the butter and egg, then the flour mix slowly, I do however have a Mix Master and feel so guilty about not having to knead, I do so anyway for a few minutes, just so I feel better. LOL Made these for a Church Dinner, they were gone before anyone else's. . . . .so proud and I made 4 dozen and got raves about them, even a few ladies asked for the recipe. Sure fire winner, hands down. Enjoy!

Came out perfect.did it without bread machine. Proofed yeast with sugar, milk&water (110f).mixed dry ingredients then added flour half cup at a time into the yeast mixture along with butter(all the butter). Kneaded 10min on stand mixer.then let dough proof in greased bowl until double in volume.then rolled & shaped into 13balls &3 rolls (without buttering).let rise again until double in volume. Baked for 10-15 min, 400f.they turned out perfect.the strange part was I didn't butter the crescents when rolled out (ihad mixed it all in the dough), but they were still very fluffy & soft. I wish I had made all the croissants instead of buns (did them because they were suggested by others).im going to make them again this time all croissants like in the actual recipie.Lets see how they turn out.thanks Donna

I made these yesterday and they were absolutely wonderful.  I made them into round dinner rolls instead of the crescents.  The only problem I see is to not eat too many.  Verrrrryyy tasty - especially warm out of the oven.  And I love doing them in the bread machine - so easy!

K PRAPER's statement of bakery rolls hooked me and I decided to try it out instead of using my grandmother's potato roll recipe (which is a little bit more work). These really do taste and look like they came from a bakery! No bread machine used, just my mixer, and I doubled the recipe. Fabulous, fabulous roll recipe!

Mmmm!  Just sampling one out of the oven now and they are soft,  sweet, and delicious!  I had to come write about it.  I didnt do the breadmaker kneading so i followed another reviewer who did it by hand too. I also rolled them into little balls and scored the tops instead of the cresent shaping.  this was my FIRST time trying dinner rolls and for me, this recipe is it!

Wow!! These were a hit at my home.  So easy to make and yummy.  I actually rolled mine into19 balls and baked then in a rectangular glass baking dish. (yes I ended with an odd number, but they ended at about 2-1/2" X 2-1/2" when done)  Definite keeper!!

These were so good! The first ever rolls I have made, I didn't use a breadmaker but just followed the instructions of one of the other reviews (summer_lover - thanks!)and they turned out beautifully.  The only thing I would do differently next time is less sugar, they were quite sweet to have with an Irish stew but not so much that it detracted from the meal which was totally delicious all round. I recommend watching the video as I found it quite helpful, as a beginner.

WONDERFUL!!!!   I have always stayed away from making yeast rolls by hand.  I found some good frozen ones you thaw out.  I decided to try my hand at these.  I didn't have a bread machine so I just made these in my mixer.  WONDERFUL.  I gave some to my mom.  And NONE were left in my house.  This will probably be my new go to roll recipe.  THANKS for posting it.

I did add an extra packet of yeast. Other than that I made 1st batch as directed. 2nd batch I made pigs in a blanket. They both turned out very good.

Absolutely delicious!!  Took to family dinner and there were two other large pans of rolls that another relative brought; I brought one pan of these rolls as I was just testing them out....told them they were all my guinea pigs =)  Well lets just say the other relative still had over a full pan left and I had 4 little rolls left haha.  Guess they liked them.  I made this recipe again except this time after the kneading process in the bread machine, I took the dough out and coated in oil and covered until it was doubled.  I punched the dough down and divided it in half.  Put each half in an 8 x 4 greased and floured pan.  Covered and let it rise until double in size again.  Baked in 350 degree oven for about 20-22 minutes.  Rubbed a stick of butter over top and sides of loaves for a glossy tender crust.  YUM!!!!  Came out perfect!!  One loaf is almost gone already in a matter of a few hours.  Will be making over and over.

Made the dough in my Kitchen Aid, with a bit more water as needed. It's a sturdy dough, but it rose up fluffy and rolled out fine. I'd probably make more, smaller crescents the next time, as they were rather large. But we all loved them.  They were sweet and tender, and went perfectly with salted butter.  They'll be used for ham sandwiches tomorrow.

Made a practice batch of these just now - testing them out for Easter dinner. Super easy if you have a bread machine. I was in a hurry and only let them rise 25 minutes, and they still turned out perfect. Very light and fluffy. Follow the recipe.. they are delicious. Anyone who rates this low (after) tweaking the recipe.. is a dum-dum.

What a delicious recipe!!! I made these to go with a steak dinner. This is one of the best bread recipes I have ever made. They smell like an Auntie Anne's soft pretzel. I wouldn't change anything about these awesomely delicious rolls. Must try!

Excellent recipe!! I don't have a breadmaker so I make 'em the old fashioned way :D  Rolls turn out perfectly every time, light, flaky with just a touch of sweetness that will go great with the beef stew I'm making for dinner tonight! This recipe should be in everyone's  recipe box.

Excellent recipe!  I was looking for a dinner roll that would be slightly sweet, and bake up perfectly in 2 - 9 inches cake pans, it was prefect! I always struggle to get a nice evenly brown top for any of my bread, but these baked up soooo pretty.  I made one batch with coconut milk and coconut oil (instead of milk and butter), and the aroma was unbelievable!!  I can foresee myself using this as a base for all sorts of buns :)

Wonderful, beautiful dinner rolls!  I realized I was out of regular milk, so I used almond milk, and they turned out great!  I am NOT a seasoned bread maker, so I am thrilled to find a recipe that turned out. Thanks!

VERY DEPENDABLE.  I have now this made this recipe several times with great success.  Yummy as a dinner roll (I don't make croissants).  These rolls also make an easy cinnamon roll by just adding melted butter on the rolled out dough.  Sprinkle with brown sugar and dashes of cinnamon.  Heaven.
Wonderful recipe.  And I am using my bread machine.  It's a good day.

Very good, but I expected them to be a little more buttery and the dough was a little wet, maybe I didn't measure the flour right. However they are tested and approved by my 19 year old son, he had 4 or more of them with dinner tonight!!! Also my husband is taking one for luch as a bacon & egg breakfast sandwich. We'll be eating the rest with leftover pot roast. A suggestion for those who said they didn't rise, as I have had problems with dough recipes in the past this is what I did.....I preheated my oven to 100 and left them in for about 45 minutes to proof, came out great.

This made an exceptional dough.  I have also enjoyed it as a cinnamon roll dough base - I put some (1 tsp?) cardamom in the dough and rolled it out in a long rectangle, then put the softened butter and cinnamon-sugar on it before rolling it jelly-roll style and cutting into 1" cinnamon rolls.  Heavenly?  Either way, make sure you give this dough ample to rise - it is a heavy dough and takes more time.  You can make these crescent rolls or cinnamon rolls ahead by putting the rolls very closely on a cookie sheet or 9x13 pan, and then freezing them overnight.  At this point you can take them off the pans and put them into ziplocs in the freezer.  When you are ready to use them, put them back on cookie sheets in the evening, cover with lint-free baking towels, and they will be ready to bake the morning!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. It's really simple.....I usually have all the ingredients on hand. But it must be something about the ratio of fat to grains that makes these rolls the most consistently reliable and delicious every single time! Like others, I toss all the ingredients, exactly as written, into my breadmaker and set it to "dough", take it out 1.5 hrs later, roll it into 24 rolls (don't  be afraid to really work them in your hands....it makes them very tender) on a single 1/2 sheet baking pan  and let rise for 1.5 hrs. I like to use my oven to rise the rolls by setting it on its lowest setting (170°) and turn it off when it reaches temperature.  Then I put my rolls in to rise. When they've nearly tripled in size and are touching each other, I pull them out, turn the heat up to 400° as instructed, and bake for 10 mins. Absolutely perfect, every time. I will NOT buy rolls ever again! Cinnabon has lost my $$ too....this is perfect for cinnamon rolls as well. Experiment.....add garlic, rosemary, brush the top with egg, milk or butter.  The sky is the limit with these little clouds of goodness. But do stick to the basic recipe, word for word, before tweaking however you like. It is the PERFECT base recipe! I !an never thank you enough

I've never made rolls before (or used yeast outside of a bread machine) so I think providing directions for those who don't have a bread machine would be really helpful. I tried to go with the directions in the reviews but everyone did things a little differently. 
One thing that worried me was that after an hour, I don't think my bread rose as much as it should have. I didn't have to punch it down at all. Now I'm worried that the rolls will come out dense. Was this possibly because the yeast didn't fully activate? Not happy...

I have used this recipe so many times and every time it comes out perfect!  I've even added 1 tsp garlic and 2 tsp onion powder to use it for Italian night!  The best tip?  My mom always saved her potato water to use in her from-scratch bread she made every Saturday when we were kids, and if you cook your potatoes a "little" longer, then your potato water is a "little" thicker too, so use a little MORE, but boy does that make it great!  I have used this for bread, rolls, cinammon rolls, bierocks, and it is always perfect!!!! Try again if you didn't like it the first time, cause I bet you accidentally did something wrong!!! THANKS FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE!!!!

We loved them.  I've made them into clover rolls and regualr dinner rolls.  The only thing wrong was that I didn't adjust the time the first time I made them, and ended up over-baking them.  (My own fault)  Perfect if I bake them at 375 instead of 400 for about 10 minutes.

These are awesome rolls! I was a little concerned because I read several reviews that the dough was too sticky (and actually it was) so after I took it out of the breadmaker, I rolled it out with some extra flour so it was easier to handle, and it was fine. I also rolled them as thin as possible, then rolled several times, and I believe that made them lighter. I will make these my go to rolls from now on, they were so good!!

These rolls were pretty good, but maybe not my favorite for a dinner roll.  They were very soft and slightly sweet.  They received great reviews at my Thanksgiving table.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Donna West!

We had these for Thanksgiving.  I don't have a bread machine so I mixed by hand.  They came out great!  My only change would be to cut back on the sugar just a little.  Very easy too!

I had to make these by hand instead of in a bread machine, but they still turned out wonderfully. I also didn't make them into crescents. I just rolled them into balls. The taste and texture weren't quite what I was expecting, but, WOW! They taste amazing! This is definitely my new go-to dinner roll recipe. Simple ingredients also are a plus. I did pour/brush melted butter over the top of the rolls once they were finished baking and out of the oven. It made the tops soft and added to the richness of the rolls. I highly recommend adding butter to the tops, unless you like chewier tops. My one and only gripe is that the rolls weren't completely done on the bottoms after 18 minutes at the given temperature. The tops were starting to turn a dark gold, so I took them out. Maybe at a lower temperature and a slightly longer bake time, they would bake completely on the bottom. However, the rolls are so delicious that you don't even notice the slight doughiness at the bottom. I also cut the sugar down to around 1/4 of a cup. If I were making cinnamon rolls (Which I might just try with this recipe), I would use the full 1/3 cup. Otherwise, excellent recipe!

With all the reviews of this wonderful recipe, I was hesitant to add another. This is the easiest most impressive roll recipe I have ever tried. Once the dough is ready for the second proofing, you can be very creative in your roll shapes. Impress you dinner guest with the same recipe shaped in twists, crescents,  or clover leaf rolls. I can not say enough great things about this recipe. Thanks Donna!

I talked trash on these rolls the entire time they were raising, and then baking.  I thought for sure I had done something wrong, they weren't going to raise well, they were going to turn out as hard as rocks.  I just knew I had messed them up somehow.  I was wrong…yay!! These are awesome. They turned out light, soft, and delicious!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe :)

I made the dough in the bread machine.  But then I just made them into round rolls instead of crescent rolls.  They were amazing.

I make bread very often.  Tonight, I wanted a quick recipe.  The verdict is in... my family said these were the BEST rolls they have ever eaten, even from restaurants.  Thank you for sharing this!!  Oh, and I didn't have the time to let these rise for an hour after the first rise in the machine.. so 15 minutes of rising and they were amazing!!

Looks like I have found my Thanksgiving rolls! Delicious, soft and fluffy! I put about half the sugar, and thought it was just right. I didn't spread the butter on them, but they turned out wonderful!

I don't have a bread machine and I still find these very easy to make. I even skip the step of spreading butter on them before shaping them and they still turn out light, moist, and delicious every time I make them. (I also just form them into balls instead of crescents because I'm lazy like that :)

Great recipe! Prepared as directed. Came out perfect and delicous. I noted in a few reviews that one packet of yeast equals one and a half teaspons of yeast. One packet of yeast equals 2 1/4 teaspoons. Its right on the jar of yeast. Thanks for the superb recipe.

Awesome dinner rolls.  I don't have bread machine therefore I used the suggestion of others to make without.  They were very delicious for my first try at yeast rolls and I will definitely make them again.  Next time I will use a quick rise yeast to cut down on time.

This bread is a staple in my home. I wanted a non cow dairy version of the bread so I substituted the milk for goats milk and the butter for a little bit less then 1/3 cup olive oil. I also went with 1/6 cup white sugar, 1/6 cup brown sugar and nixed the butter basting at the end. What resulted was a rich flavored roll that had great bounce and texture and taste. Sooooo yummy!

I didn't have a breadmaker either, but that didn't stop me from trying.  I read some of the other reviews and decided to "nuke the milk and water in the microwave" then add the yeast.  I didn't know if I should stir the yeast in or let it sit.  I stirred in the milk/water mixture and let it sit for 15 min. I mixed all the other ingredients except the last 1/4 cup of butter. I added everything together and let it rise for 1 hr.  I knead and punch the dough, separated into balls and let it rise for another hr (which worked!!) Popped them in the oven for 12 minutes, broiled for 3 minutes(which I shouldn't have done because the tops were tooooo brown) but the bottoms were not burnt (thank God!). These looked more like biscuits than rolls...when I try them again I will pay more attention to the oven temperature and time.

The most absolute best dough recipe ever! I made it exactly as the recipe says. Soft, moist, & delicious. I have attempted many bread recipes (I always follow exactly the first time I make things), and have never been successful. I will continue to use this recipe for all my bread dough needs. Thank you so much Donna!

Absolutely delicious! Made them as rolls, then I used it to make cinnamon buns. Didn't change a thing! Making them for a dinner party this weekend. Made them yesterday and froze them raw... we'll see how they rise after being frozen.

These were amazing.  I used the bread machine and when it beeped in the last 25 mins, I added minced garlic and herbs.  I made hamburger buns and dinner rolls instead of the wedges rolled up and they are the best rolls I've ever made!! flaky and light and soooo yummy.  Best hamburger bun ever!  We are using more with sloppy joes tonight.  This is the only bread recipe I will be making!  Thanks a TON!

Very good!  Made into pull apart buns for dinner (7 small rounds in a circle pan) and froze the rest.  Excellent flavour, would be so awesome for cinnamon buns.  Oh, and made the old fashioned way (see previous reviews) and it turned out great.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT! I add a small amount of sugar to the butter before I brush it on.  Makes it taste just like Logan's or Texas Roadhouse Yeast Rolls.
Family and friends rave over these and are always begging for the recipe.

perfect dough! I've made crescents, cinnamon rolls, folded over rolls, clover leaf rolls, and on and on...Dont be afraid to substitute some wheat flour for the white flour - some or all! THANK YOU, this has now replaced my otherwise perfect recipe..

Followed the recipe exactly, except that I melted the butter and brused with butter after the second rise before they went into the oven.  Fresh out of the oven, these are heavenly, especially with a light spread of butter.  The next morning, I used them to make egg and cheese sandwiches and they were even better.  The next time, I'll add some vital wheat gluten to make them even lighter and fluffier!!  Highly recommended, this one will be added to my recipe box

This is my familys' favorite roll recipe. I have made it lots of different ways. I made it in a muffin tin once as pull apart rolls. The kids thought that was fun. I have sprinkled cinnamon sugar, toffee bits, and mini chocolate chips on them before rolling them up at different times as well. They are always a hit!

These are the best rolls I've made so far. I used my stand mixer to knead the dough and let rise an hour. Only others changes I made were I used soy milk, and made these into rolls instead of crescents, and brushed on butter on the top before the 2nd rise.  Will definitely make this again.

As a first time crescent maker, these were very good. I used the Kitchen-Aide version posted and will make using the bread machine as I had a little trouble with the texture getting too tough due to mixing. The flavor, however and ease of making these promted a 5 star.

These were so so SO yummy! Best rolls I've made. My whole family ate them all up and loved them! I didn't make them into the crescent rolls, but just rolled them into balls and baked just as the recipe called for. They turned out awesome!!!! So easy to just throw the ingredients into the bread machine. I will definitely be making these often!

I use my bread machine for the mixing and 1st rise.  I've also managed to sneak in 1 cup of white whole wheat flour  and 2 tsp. vital wheat gluten to replace 1 cup of regular flour.  The recipe is good enough that my hubby has no idea he's getting some whole wheat. He loves these. Thanks.

Perfect rolls to go along with Christmas dinner! I started these in the bread machine and then rolled the dough into 20-25 balls and then let them rise in a 9X13 pan for an hour then baked for about 12 minutes, then froze them.  When it came time for Christmas dinner, I baked them (covered in foil) at 350 for 15 minutes or so (I think the oven in our cabin didn't heat very well so it took longer).  Everyone loved them and there were none left :)

Although I have a bread maker, I didn't use it (rarely do). Mixed and kneaded by hand as usual, then followed the recipe exactly.  Dough is very nice to work with - not to soft, sticky, etc.  Rolls were delicious!

Made it in my KA mixer and then let it rise for an hour.  Problem: it didn't double, at best it quartered (and I was bragging an hour earlier about how foamy my yeast was).  Had to have it ready for Christmas dinner so I just went with it.  Rolled it into crescents (I assumed it'd take a while because so many reviewers seem to make balls but it was really easy and fast with a pizza cutter).  The second rise went way better and they puffed even more in the oven.  I'm talking HUGE- big enough to use as an actual hot dog roll.  Next time I will make them a bit smaller.  Only took 9 mins in the oven.

I just made these rolls, they did not rise as much as I thought they would- probably something I did. But my family thought they were wonderful! My 16 year old suggested putting little smokies inside for like pigs in a blanket.  I am going try that today- I will let y'all know!!

These rolls were easy to make and were the hit of our Thanksgiving dinner.  This would be a good recipe for someone who would like to try yeast breads - - success is almost guaranteed.  There is a good reason this recipe has 5 starts and has so many reviews - - yum, yum, yum!!!  They received thumbs up by everyone from Grandpa to the baby.

Did not have breadmaker, so mixed yeast and warm water and added to milk/butter/sugar mixture after cooling.  After letting dough rise in covered bowl for 1 hour, formed into 16 ball-shaped rolls and placed into rectangular glass pan, then let rise again (covered) for another hour.  The consistency was perfect, but the rolls were just a little too sweet for us.  Would probably cut down on the sugar next time, or maybe add a little more salt.  Overall, these were pretty easy to make.

Thanks Donna for the wonderful recipe! I just found it the other day and have already made it twice because the rolls were gone in a flash. If you don't have a bread maker use K Praper review. It helped a lot! Thank you. This recipe is a keeper. I followed the recipe perfectly (minus the breadmaker and PRAPERS review) and these rolls rock!

I love this recipe! My husband has boycotted store bought bread and insists I make this bread. My kids love it, too. I don't have a bread machine, like a lot of other reviewers, so I just make it by hand and it works just as well. I've made the clover leaf rolls, ball rolls, and even divided it into 2 loaves (didn't work as well, but still tasted great).  This is now my go-to bread recipe!

These were sooo good. Light and fluffy.  I didn't read all the directions so I let my dough go thru the entire dough cycle on my breadmachine.  Still were perfect.  I will never buy rolls at the store again. Thx

These rolls are so perfect looking and tasting! I am so happy to have finally made rolls that turn out just like the picture!  I've failed many times with homemade rolls, but thought I'd give this recipe a shot. I was NOT disappointed.  Tasted almost like crescent rolls without the price! Thanks for sharing!

Made teeny tiny crescents then switched over to larger ones. The small crescents became a bit too dry and didn't have that wow effect that the larger ones did.  Made two batches. Used half of the second batch for cinnamon rolls (brown sugar/cinnamon sprinkled on the butter), then put them unbaked in the fridge for post-Thanksgiving breakfast for guests who stayed overnight. That sure was handy! Would make these again.

This recipe was a hit! I used it yesterday for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them! Someone thought i got them from a tin! Next time, however, i will probably cut back on the sugar as others thought they were too sweet. Still, phenomenal recipe!

So good.  I made two batches today.  One for Thanksgiving dinner (noon meal) and then I made another batch as cinnamon rolls for in the morning.  I increased the sugar for the 2nd batch, mixed up some butter, brown sugar and cinnamon and rolled them up, and sliced them with some dental floss.  Once cooled, I topped it with some cream cheese icing.  So tasty.  Both times, I didnt get a very good first or second rise.  It was a brand new jar of yeast, so I am not sure what happened, but they still baked up pretty well.  In spite of this, the flavor and ease of preparation were amazing.

Oh. My. Goodness!  Even as a fairly inexperienced bread maker, I was able to get these rolls to come out perfectly!  I followed K PRAPER's instructions (I also don't have a bread machine), and the only change I made to the ingredients was to use margarine instead of butter and 1/4 c egg substitute instead of real egg.  These remind me of a very old recipe that my aunt has been using for crescent rolls that we all gorge ourselves on every Christmas.  SO glad to have these now in my arsenal for big family gatherings!  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were HUGE! I didn't read the "gently but tightly" instruction...so mine were a little loose around the edges.  I also let them rise in my dishwasher (on dry selection-that's how I always let my doughs rise), but I think 20-30 minutes may have been enough rising time instead of the full hour.  Wonderful flavor, and big enough to make sandwiches with after my Thanksgiving meal!

Fantastic.  I've made them twice now and everyone loves them.  As long as I start about 3 hours before dinner time I am guaranteed warm rolls with whatever I make.

Everything the reviews before mine are true!!!! I do catering and decided to change my dinner roll recipe and used this one. I was feeding 200. The rave reviews that I recieved. I also have been looking for a cinnamon roll recipe and used this and the only thing I did different was to add a 1/3 cup more sugar. Rolled the dough out and covered with butter and cinnamon/sugar. WOW!!!!! I also had some cream cheese frosting left in the refrige and used it also. I rolled the dough out like I would with cinnamon rolls and caked on the icing and then rolled them. Another WOW!!! Iced them in cream cheese frosting.        THANK YOU Donna for submitting this recipe. This is a real keeper.

Wonderful!  I make "Flower Rolls" by cutting in 1-1/4" circles and place (5) circles of dough around sides of a muffin pan and (1) in the middle.  Bake then BRUSH WITH MELTED BUTTER! This is a holiday tradition and at least once a month for other dinner...Enjoy!

I made these rolls diary free(since we have a few lactose intolerant members in our family)using rice milk and margarine,instead of the milk and butter. I Mixed the dough  in my bread machine, separated it into 24  balls,  brushed with margarine , put in greased cookie sheets and then baked the rolls in the oven. They came out perfect ! In fact, my family agrees that those rolls are better than the rolls sold at the bakery. It became an all time favorite with our family.

The dinner rolls are lovely! They are easy to make and they raise very nice and are moist and fluffy. I made them tonight to compliment the "Juicy Roasted Chicken" and it was a huge hit! There is only 1 roll left and I am not sure it will last the night. These are wonderful and I will make them again!

Yep, these rolls were amazing, soft and fluffy and slightly sweet. Perfection.  
UPDATE:  I can't even tell you how many times I have made these rolls exactly as written.  They are the best rolls ever.  And the dough is SOOOOOOO easy to work with.  Love them.

Been looking/trying to find a good roll recipe, and I think this is it.  Definitely, the best rolls I've made to date, maybe it's practice or maybe it's the recipe.  But these has a wonderful flavor and a wonderful texture.  I don't have a bread machine so I followed another reviewer instructions on how to make them with a kitchenAid mixer and it was successful!  Thanks much for the recipe.

There are my no-fail go-to rolls and turn out beautifully every time. They are so good that my nephew requested I bake them in place of a birthday cake for him this year!   I usually make more rolls than the recipe calls for (we prefer a smaller sized roll) but they turn out perfectly no matter how large I make them.   Thanks for an excellent recipe.

So delicious, made without a breadmachine by following anothers review for making the old fashioned way. These are very soft and flavorful. I'm making my second batch today and doubling it. I added half whole wheat flour so they are healthier and they turned out great!

These were great, but you probably already knew that based on all of the great reviews! They reminded me of the rolls you get at Texas Roadhouse. After the first raise, I just pulled the dough into a long rope then cut into 8 pieces. Then I placed them on the cookie sheet and let them rise as is. I also brushed them with melted butter right out of the oven and it gave them a nice color and flavor. I split the recipe in half and made cinnamon rolls with the other half since there's only three of us.  It was a heavy carb night, but they were worth it!

I love this recipe! I've used it either savory or sweet, but it always turns out perfect--5 stars just aren't enough!. I'm the worst bread baker ever, but this was foolproof when used with my bread machine on the dough setting. The family loves it, and it's quite easily my favorite bread recipe ever

Flavor was good, but as written there is WAY too little flour. I added just enough to get it to hold together, but the texture when baked was just not right.  The flavor was a little too sweet, and I really like sweet dinner rolls.

Delicious rolls, I don't have a bread machine but they still turned out great. I let the dough rise in an oiled bowl for 1 hour then rolled into 15 pieces and placed in a 9" x 13" pan to rise another hour, baked for 20 minutes. I can't wait to try them as cinnamon rolls.

I have never made homemade dinner rolls before and I offered to make the rolls for my brother-in-law's wedding dinner. So obviously I had to multiply the quantities GREATLY - made about 130 rolls. I don't have a bread machine so I made them the old fashioned way following K Praper's instructions (thank you!!). Anyways, these rolls got RAVE reviews from the guests. I made half of the batch 2 days before the wedding and the other half the day before and kept them in storage bags. They stayed nice and moist, light and airy. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Love these rolls.  I skipped the 1/4 cup of butter at the end.  I made them into 18 rolls and baked them in two 9x9 glass pans at 375 F for 17 minutes (internal temp of 200 F)  Light and fluffy and delicious.

This makes really good sweet bread. I make the dough in the bread machine, then put in a pan, let it rise, then bake it. It comes out just like the popular Kings Sweet Bread that used to be baked in Hawaii.

I don't have a bread machine, so I used my food processor to make the dough. I used reviews from the recipe and work at the "old fashion way". I followed instruction for my food processor regarding mixing the ingredients (flour goes together with butter and salt and later on slowly adding the "wet" ingredients) .  It turned out perfect! WE LOVED these!  Definitely will make again...

An update (11/17/2010)
I froze some of these by wrapping individually each roll in foil. Before dinner I just took these out, let them stand for sometime and put in the oven (still wrapped in foil) (350F) for some time (until soft). Worked like a charm. I also do the same trick with any frozen bread, always gives a great, soft, fresh bread.

I was able to make these dairy free, and they still tasted great, and that is a 5 star in my book! I used vanilla almond milk and non-dairy, soy free 'butter', and half wheat flour. They came out a little dense, but that was probably my fault as I was making these while juggling a 4 month old and a sick 5 year old. I will do these again, but proof the yeast first in the bread machine and see if I can get them fluffy. Even if I can't, I will keep making them because the flavor was great. and with a little 'butter' melted on them... yum!

Pretty good, great with butter spread on them. I made regular shaped rolls instead of crescents. The only thing I will do different next time is brush on an egg wash to help them brown.

Mine turned out a little denser than I had hoped, but that was my fault for not kneading enough.  I think that's probably why the middles also didn't completely cook either.  Still, a very good recipe for rolls.  I'll try again soon and hopefully get it right this time!

Made up a batch of these, exactly per recipe ingredients, but with one fowel up: I added the softened butter after the flour and yeast.  After 3 minutes, my dough had formed into a beautiful, smooth elastic ball.  After forming these into 15 2 inch wide balls, I set them close together in a greased glass casserole (one size smaller than the standard 9 x 13 in), covered and let them rise for no less than 1 hour.  You MUST wait 1 hour for these to develop their fluffy texture.  After baking, they looked just like unglazed Hawaiian Sweet Rolls.  Delicious!  Slightly sweet from the sugar.  A little puff of heaven.

These rolls are wonderful.  So soft and delicious.  I baked these as round rolls in a 9x13 pan at 350 degrees for about 15 mins.  Perfect dinner rolls.

I love this bread! Instead of using this recipe as a whole, I changed the all-purpose flour to high protein flour. and I add 2 grammes of bread improver. It turns out soft and very bakery-like bread! I had tried using all-purpose flour, but the bread turns out hard and very difficult to eat. I will difinitely use this recipe again!

The dough was super sticky when I took it out of the bread machine. I added a decent amount of flour to make it workable. I followed another reviewers suggestion and put three balls inside a muffin pan. The buns turned out very good, not as sweet as I was expecting after reading the reviews.

I only needed half the amount of rolls so I split the recipe measures in half, except for the egg (I just used the egg white).  I used honey in place of the white sugar.  I used bread flour instead of the all-purpose flour.  It made eight good size rolls and they were delicious and gone.

This did not work for me at all. Due to the reviews i'm sure that it is my fault. I will try again to see what might have gone wrong.

These are the best!  I make them all the time, and am now famous for them.  I've given the recipe to tons of people!    I use margarine IN the dough, but only BUTTER when rolling the dough.  Very important.  My breadmaker fits 1.5 times this recipe, so that's what I use.  It makes the perfect amount to fill a large jelly roll pan with piping hot rolls!

These had a great flavor and looked really wonderful.  I'm still honing my bread-baking skills, so they were a bit more dense than I expected, but all in all, a good recipe.

I really don't see how you can get this recipe wrong.  These turn out for me every single time.  And I've gotten several compliments on them.  Even if you replace part of the white flour for whole wheat flour, these come out amazing tasting.  I would just recommend if you're replacing more than half of your white flour for wheat flour to throw in a couple tablespoons of vital wheat gluten to lighten the texture up a bit.

Addictive, when served with honey butter.   This is now my go-to roll recipe.  I did not wrap mine into crescents, but instead divided the dough into about 20 balls, raised for 45 minutes and baked until a light golden brown.  Absolute heaven!

Thought these were very good.  I prepared them exactly as written except substituted 1 cup of the flour with whole wheat flour.  Thought it was a great swap, may also try swapping the sugar for honey next time and more whole wheat to make a healthier roll.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is amazing. I used bread flour because I had more of that than AP on hand - the dough came out of the bread machine so fluffy and light, I divided it in half and made half as directed, spread about a tablespoon of butter over the rollec out dough and using a pizza cutter, cut into 8 wedges and rolled up - these came out so fluffy and delicious my guests couldn't believe I made them!  Then the other half I rolled into small balls and put three in a muffin tin each to make clover rolls.  We ate so many for dinner last night I had to make a fresh batch this morning for Easter brunch - not a problem though because they are sooo easy.  And I can imagine when I have more time playing with the dough to do all kinds of fun recipes for appetizers, dessert etc.  Oh and as a side note, I almost ran out of yeast for the second batch so I only had about 2tsp, maybe less, but they are still rising okay - maybe not quite as much or as fast as with the full amount of yeast so I recommend at least 2 and quarter tsp.

It may have been my technique, but these rolls were very denseand I would prefer a light and airy roll.  Although, they do taste very good and I gave this recipe 4 stars.  I tried this recipe again and let my rolls rise longer in a warmer area (low temp oven) and they turned out much better.  The rolls were a little lighter and better, but I am looking for a recipe that makes "air-light" yeast rolls like those you find in restaurants that you put honey butter on and they melt in your mouth.  Although, this is a good basic dinner roll.

These are absolutely delicious!  It's my first time baking dinner rolls, and I'm surprised at how heavenly they've turned out!  The only change I've made is using vanilla-flavored soy milk instead of regular milk.  I think it makes the bread slightly sweeter, and I love it!

Absolutely amazing recipe. They just came out of the oven and I ate one hot. They taste like something from a fine bakery. Best part of the recipe is no ingredients that you would't normally have. WOW! Thanks for sharing your recipe. God Bless, Sheila

Sometimes I'm too lazy/busy to spread the butter on at the end so I add more to the dough itself and then shape into rolls... AWESOME recipe. I use it very often!

These were very good. I don't have a bread machine so I did it the old fashioned way. Wasn't sure what to do with the 2nd 1/4c butter so I left it out. Other than sticking to the pan these came out beautiful.

This was my first attempt at homemade rolls and they were absolutely fabulous!  I don't know why I have always hesitated to make rolls, but it was so easy to use the bread machine to make the dough and then just rolled them into balls and put them on a cookie sheet. They tasted wonderful and were definately worth the extra effort!

Yes, this is worth the 5 stars given. I don't know why they came out so delicious, maybe because of the milk (I usually use all water). Absolute, go to, roll recipe !

Versitile dough recipe.  Dinner rolls were outstanding.  So were the breakfast rolls: mixed together brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon then sprinkled mixture on dough before rolling.  Right out of the oven glazed them with almond extract flavored icing and sprinkled with thinly sliced almonds. Yummy!

These are really awesome and so simple.  I don't have a bread machine so I made them in the kitchen aid stand mixer.  The only things I changed was to add a little garlic powder and lessened the sugar by a tablespoon or so.  I also made this as actual rolls not cresents.  These would definitely make great slider rolls or if made larger sandwich rolls.  Thanks for sharing.

I made these for Easter a couple years ago and they were amazing. This time I made a loaf to completion in my breadmachine and it turned out AWESOME. I substituted shortening for butter FYI...I don't know if that made any difference. Also, I realized that they taste pretty close to a certain Chinese bun I used to get in Michigan...So I'll be making these again and experimenting to get the Chinese bun thing right. Overall, this is a great basic recipe. Plus, it's one of the only loaves  that I can slice to make look like store bought without crumbling all over or smashing inside. Thanks again.

I used 1 1/4 cup whole wheat flour and the rest in AP. I also cooked these at 350 and they were done after 15 minutes. I used these to make bierocks. Yummy and pretty easy to make, let the bread machine do all the work. Thanks!

I have been using this recipe almost 10 years, now. During holidays, my extended family is always asking me if I will be making these rolls. These rolls are the children's favorites. I also once used the dough for cinnamon buns, very delicious.

These were some the most light, fluffy and tasty rolls I've had in a very long time.  I used to make dinner rolls all the time BY HAND and they came out fabulous, then I stopped for a number of years and tried using the same recipe and they came out hard as rocks!  So along with the rolls I threw the recipe out with them.  I think there was something I did back then that I didn't write on the recipe that clearly I'd forgotten.  This recipe turned out wonderfully!!  Thanks so much Donna. **For first time bread bakers, use the freshest ingredients as possible, especially the yeast, that too can make your bread hard.

These are very good rolls.  I'm still looking for a light roll but these are still excellent.  They are fluffy, but slightly dense.  (again, still very good!)  I made mine into 15 dinner rolls in a 9x13 glass dish.  baked them at 375 for 12 min and they were perfect.  I was worried about a few reviews saying these were biscuit-like, but mine were not like that at all.

These were very good! Will for sure make them again. Maybe next time I would cut back or leave out the salt. The butter was salted and they were a little bit on the salty side. They are a more dense roll not light and fluffy but tasty just the same!!!
 Update!!! Just used this dough to make cinnamon rolls for Father's Day and they were AMAZING!!! I use bread flour instead of AP flour. Try this it is soooo worth it!!!!

Like another reviewer said these rolls come out perfect every time.  They are light and delicious.  I am asked to bring them to many family dinners, especially at Christmas and Thanksgiving. Give this recipe a try.  You will be glad you did!

I don't know why I spent $20 on a bread machine cookbook when the best recipes are on this website. Made 24 huge crescent rolls. Can't wait to try making  cinnamon rolls with this recipe.

These were really light and fluffy.  I felt the 1/3 cup of sugar was too sweet when used as a dinner roll, so I cut that to 1 T without affecting the wonderful taste.  When used as a breakfast bread the recipe as written is perfect.

First Timer with the bread and I will def do again. I do not have a bread machine either but do have a Kitchen Aide. I turned my dryer on for a sec and let the dough rise in there from the heat because it didn't seem to be rising enough. Really couldn't be easier. Super delicious.

Very nice rolls!  They are light and taste wonderful with honey!  I cut mine into pieces, rolled, and baked in a 9x13 pan rather than making crescents.  Delicious!

This was my first time EVER baking any sort of bread and it turned out fabulous!  I made these for a family Christmas gathering, and even though my husband had bought some dinner rolls from the grocery store (for back-up, just in case they didn't turn out tasty), everyone chose my rolls over the grocery store ones!  I also had a lot of fun rolling the dough into balls with my mother :)

I do not own a bread machine and never will.  So I made them the traditional way, it did not take long and they worked great.  I Made them for Christmas dinner and the family loved them ( there was none left over) and thats a lot to say for a very picky family that is not shy to let you know when something is not good.

Here's what I did...I added 1 tsp. of granulated garlic to the dough mixture.  After that, I followed other reviewers idea of dividing the dough into 36 pieces and putting three pieces into each section of a muffin tin.  I then allowed the dough to rise a final time in the tin.  After rising, I brushed the rolls with butter and sprinkled each one with granulated garlic, parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, and dried parsley.  After baking, I again brushed the rolls with melted butter.  I took these to a potluck and people raved over them and were amazed that I made them myself.  Amazing!

Good recipe but definitely not bakery quality. They are light and fluffy but there is still a yeast taste to them. I'm going to keep trying different recipes.

These were good.  I am not sure why but mines came out more like biscuits.  I followed the recipe without any changes.  I used half the dough to make cinnamon rolls. I will be makeing them again.

Never made rolls before, but these were pretty easy to make and tasted really good. Husband wants me to try to make a whole loaf out of it. I took others suggestions and didn't follow recipe specifically but it's really good.

Yum!  I didn't shape them into the rolls the recipe recommended, I shaped them into regular rounds.  Everyone loved them!  I will make these again!  (Also used some of the extra dough to make cinnamon roll~ excellent!)  I also found that the dough does well when refrigerated.  I shaped the dough and put them into the baking dish before sticking them into the refrigerator.  The next day, I removed them and after coming to room temperature I let them rise.  Perfect.

People start begging for this when the holidays approach, and then hide them in the pantry so no one else can eat them. Very, very good, and I always double the recipe. I don't use a bread machine either, and have made it a few different ways. Generally, just mixing the liquid and then the dry ingredients works (of course, after letting the yeast sit to foam first).

This is the best recipe.  I made cinnamon rolls and they were so delicious.  It was Christmas Eve and we were having the biggest snow storm ever.  I served cinnamon rolls using this recipe with my homemade chili soup and it was spot on.  You will not be sorry making this recipe.  Thank you Thank you for sharing...

This a 5 stars one with no doubt! It is a fail-safe recipe even for beginners .... I have tried several time without any modification and they have come out exactly the same each time! One thing which bugs me is that the bottoms of the rolls get brown (look like burned)! Still it tastes pretty good. I wonder if anyone have suggestion to avoid this? I tried putting another pan underneath the one with rolls in it and bottoms are less burned .... Meanwhile, you may keep this in the fridge for several days in a plastic container (covered) and whenever you want to have them just microwave it for a few seconds and it would look like just come out of oven! :)

These rolls were awesome! I left the recipe as is and my family and friends loved them. I've already made them twice and will definitely be making them again.

If I could make this more stars I would.  After taking the dough out of my bread machine I made it into rolls and left it in a casserol dish hoping they would rise because they looked so small.  Then I went on making the rest of Christmas dinner.  They quadrupled by the time I got ready to put them in!  But they were soooo good.  It was the one thing that was completely gone by the end of dinner.  This is the only bread I ever want to eat!  Delicious!!!

Easily the best rolls I have ever made, even the first time I tried this recipe. Everyone loved them! I have a small family but nearly all 16 rolls were gone after dinner. I don't even have a bread machine, and they came out great. I'll definitely make these again.

I just LOVE this recipe!  It rose beautifully for both the first rise in the bread maker and then the second rise in the muffin tins!  I found that 10 minutes baking time was enough in my oven...  I followed recipe except I used bread flour.  If you are familiar with Hawaiian sweet bread that you get at the grocery store near the deli (comes with the fried chicken meals) this is almost the same!!!!  Light, and sweet!

These are perfect if you like a little "heft" to your rolls - not too heavy, mind you, but not feather-light, either. Perfect amount of sweetness, and great for sandwich rolls, too. I get rave reviews every time I make these, and they're really easy. I don't have a breadmaker, so I make these with my mini Bosch - all I do is let the yeast, sugar, and warm milk froth, add the egg and butter, whip, and then switch to the dough hook. I just add flour a half-cup at a time, and they turn out beautifully. Good luck!

Last year I tried to make sweet roles twice.  Both times they tasted so-so but looked horrible.  This year I tried this recipe for the first time on Thanksgiving day.  They turned out wonderful!  Looked like store bought, but tasted 10 times better.  Thank you!

The flavor of these was great, but I think the directions could be spelled out a little better for a beginner. I think I put too much flour out and that made these too hard. I also liked the idea of the cloverleaft rolls, but I guess I didn't use enough dough because they did not look like the picture. Overall I think I will try this again because the flavor was wonderful and the things I didn't like were most likely due to user error :)

This was a winner for me because it was easy, delicious and a keeper.  I made cinnamon rolls with the help of King Arthur's "baker's cinnamon filling" and it is a small wonder that these rolls ever made it out of the kitchen!  Had to make second batch.  Thank you to all the reviewers for sharing their great tips as I made adjustments using the old fashion method of hands on.

I made these for thanksgiving, trusting in all the good reviews...MISTAKE!  I followed the directions except for using a regular mixer instead of a bread machine. (I've made good bread before, so I figured it would work.)  They looked pretty, but tasted "yeasty" and had a sort of crumbly texture!  I was very embarrassed!

This was wonderful.  I had done an overnight dough the night before thanksgiving that I had used last year--somehow I messed it up.  In the morning I wen tto roll out the dough and it was hard and not dough-like at all. So in a rush for our Thanksgiving dinner I found this recipe and it was AMAZING.  Rolled it into cresents and let it rise for about 3 hours and the cresents came out HUGE!! Wonderful :)

Super!! I've never made bread before and I can't believe I made something so good on my first try! I don't have a bread machine so I used other reviewers advice on how to make these by hand...and no problems. This one's going into the 'favourites' book & I'll make them again & again.

Super! I did what others suggested and substituted a cup of wheat flour in. We prefer wheat bread around here :) Anyway, I have made these four times in the last two weeks for our home and for dinner with friends, and everyone raves about them. Yum!

These rolls were fantastic. I made burgers on the grill and made these rolls and used as buns. Added homemade fries and baked beans, what a delicious meal. Will make again and again. Next time I will try to shape them for hot dog or brat buns. I'll let you know how it worked.

Wonderful rolls!  I had tried these once before and they tasted good, but I think I let them rise too long as they were a little overly "airy".  I made them again last night and they were AWESOME!  I didn't let them rise nearly as long and made them into 16 dinner rolls.  I forgot to put the butter on them, but they were amazing, regardless.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Ok,this is a fab recipe! I made "cloverleaf" rolls and the are super delicious! light, fluffy and just a hint of sweetness. I will use this for sweet rolls also.  Great dough to handle and great texture for rolls. TRY this even if you have no experience, it's such a good recipe, you can't mess up unless you don't use fresh ingredients (as with any baking) ENJOY!

AWESOME - I made cinnamon rolls out of these and this is - by far - the best dough I have ever made. I don't have a bread machine, but it still worked amazing. I even forgot to let it rise the second time, and they turned out incredible. PERFECT DOUGH!!!

These are exceptional.  Light and fluffy.  I followed another reviewer's advice and made clover leaf rolls.  My family can't wait for me to make these again!  Just finished taking these out of the oven and I think they are even mroe fluffy and light with using FF milk,  egg beaters, and light butter this time.  Made clover rolls again along with a pan version and both rose equally well.  What a great recipe!

I used others' suggestions and made cloverleaf rolls, but I think they were actually a little too big that way.  However you make them, these are super yummy, especially warm with butter or margarine.  I plan to make these every so often and freeze them.  They're as good as any store-bought rolls (better, really), and for a fraction of the cost.

I have been testing roll recipes for "the one" and this is it.  Like most reviewers I skipped the crescent roll directions and divided it into 12 huge rolls and basted with 2 tbsp butter before and after baking.  What an amazing recipe.  My bread machine worked well with it.  I am so pleased!!!

Very nice rolls.  I shaped them into balls for less fuss.  I will be using this again - especially for hamburger buns!  I tried to make one and a half recipes, and my bread machine couldn't handle it.  I ended up kneading by hand.  I'm sure it would have worked with one recipe though.

Perfection!  I doubled the recipe and used my Kitchen Aid mixer for the kneading.  They turned out perfect.  My kids are going through them like crazy.  I guess I'll be making them again soon!

I should've inventoried my ingredients before I started making these.  I ran out of AP flour and used 1/2 cup WW flour and 1/2 cup ground rolled oats instead.  It made 12 hamburger size rolls that tasted really good!

Update:  I made these by making them as Red Bean Buns! They are delicious!!!  Original review: This was my first time making bread (and using yeast) and these were delicious! I had to make the dough the old fashioned way because I have no bread machine. I used 1/2 cup sugar instead of 1/3 cup. I also reduced to baking temperature to 350 and baked it for about 13 min. I would melt the butter next time. Thanks for this fantastic recipe!!!

Seriously good recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly, but seeing as I have no breadmaker I had to do it the old fashioned way, by hand.  I got 12 big sized rolls out of it...hamburger bun size.  This is my new "go to" recipe for rolls, can't wait to try them as cinnamon pecan buns!

A hit every time I make them.  Quick and easy to make, I can have them done in no time and with an impressive taste.  I brush butter over it before and AFTER cooking so they are nice and moist.  I can't make them often enough!

WOW!!! These rolls are Great! The only thing that I did to make them better, was to take some soft spread butter, and mix in some honey to taste. I think I have died, and went to heaven. Really good and really easy

I made this last week almost as written. except I didn't see the 1/4 cup of butter and I just made them as round rolls. They were awesome. So good. After I made them my dr put me on a low fat diet...so here is what I did today- All milk no water BUT fat free milk, I used egg sub instead of egg and margarine instead of butter..I was worried. No need they just finished and are still AWESOME! thanks so much for this recipe!

We love these in our family.  I've made them at least 10 times.  I've used them for hamburger buns (which really brings out the sweetness when you pair them with beef) and cinnamon rolls.  I make them as regular rolls about twice a week.  The kids love them for snacks.  Awesome.  They were less sweet than I expected (Not a Hawaiian type) but taste so good anyway.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  These rolls are so easy to make, plus no kneeding!  I substituted one cup of whole wheat flour for one of the cups of white flour.  Excellent!

I absolutely LOVE these rolls. I must be honest, last night was my third attempt. I didn't know much about baking yeast rolls so I know my other two failed attempts were due to "user error". I received a bread machine on Mother's Day from DH and tried the recipe last night and what a success!! I followed suggestions from other users: I used 1 cup of warm milk (did not use water at all), used SIFTED bread flour, and rapid rise yeast. I made them into rolls last night. My husband went crazy!!! To save our waistlines, I packaged some up and shared them at work today-they were all gone within 10 minutes. No one could believe I didn't buy them from a steak house!! I will try these some other time using my Kitchen Aid but for now, the bread machine yielded PERFECT results for me!!

Really great, easy to follow recipe. These were my second rolls I ever baked and came out great. I made them without a bread machine as described in previous reviews and they were awesome. Look no further for your next batch of rolls! These were very soft and delicious. I cooked them at 340 F for 15 minutes in my oven since it tends to be pretty hot.

I made these yesterday for Easter and they were fantastic!  They come out looking like crescent rolls, not like the photo but I will be making these again.  I used my Vita-Mix to do the dough but it bogged down as the flour to liquid ratio is high for that appliance but it still worked and they got raves from my family.

These are the best rolls ever.I don't have a bread machine so I put the milk, water, sugar,butter and salt in a pan and warmed up just until the butter melted.I added the liquid to the yeast and waited 5 minutes then I added the flour slowly, what I could not add I kneaded in the dough.I let it rise for one hour in the oven with a pot of hot water underneith. I made 13 rolls and baked as directed.Amazing!!!!!:)

I just recently started using my bread machine again and was looking for a roll recipe. I didn't have time to get to the grocery store and get our favorite hawaiian sweet rolls for our ham dinner...I will never buy them again! These are very, very good and so easy to make! Followed the recipe exactly but did not have the time to do them as "crescents" as the directions call for...instead simply rolling into balls and placing them in pie plates as another reviewer had done after the dough cycle and letting them rise for the hour stated and baked. Thanks so much for sharing!

Holy cow! I was skeptical of the rave reviews but not anymore. First, the dough was airy. Hands down the best dough I've ever made. Second, I did not make these into crescents, rather divided into 17 balls and made them into Parker House rolls (flatten dough into a round, put a small amount of butter on one half of round, crease down the center of round with the back of a butter knife, and fold over). I baked these for 15 minutes at 350 degrees and the rolls were done all the way through. When the rolls came out of the oven they were virtually weightless. So light and airy and the taste was wonderful. This will be my new standard roll recipe.

I  made this exactly as the recipe is, and they were absolutely delightful. Light, fluffy, and totally yummy. I topped mine with an egg wash too as it made them look prettier.

Outstanding!!!  I used olive oil instead of butter on the top and I also sprinkled the tops with oregano and sea salt.  These would make perfect hamburger buns.  This is by far the best dinner roll/bun recipe I have ever made from this site.

This was such an easy recipe to follow, and the rolls came out fantastic! They did not last the night. Yummy! I think next time I make these I will sprinkle on some cinnamon and sugar when I brush the butter on before rolling them into the crescents. I think that would make a tasty sweet dessert bread.

Excellent when made in bread machine as a loaf or in the oven, a little better when in the oven.  Sweet and fluffy, but not caky.

Awesome! I have never made rolls like these before. Usually they are hockey pucks. This turned out great. I do need to do some work, I kind of rushed them through at the end, but they turned out better than anything else I`ve made.  I have leftovers to use for lunch tomorrow as buns. Would be nice for hamburgers as well...maybe for dinner tomorrow!

Very good recipe.  All the rolls were gone within minutes of being removed from the oven.  A sure sign that the family enjoyed the recipe also.  I did lower the cooking temperature to 375 to make sure the bottoms of the rolls did not burn.

Oh what a disaster I had with these.  I decided to do the dough in my bread machine and followed the recipe exact.  When the dough cycle was over, the dough was so wet that I could pour it out of the pan, and the yeast was still setting on top.  So, I poured it into a bowl and added flour to get it to a thicker consistency and also to blend in the yeast.  Believe it or not, they actually turned out pretty good and my husband actually had 5 of them for lunch.  I will stick with my old faithful recipe though and continue to mix my rolls by hand.

Wow! These were PERFECT! And so easy! I feel like an expert baker making these. My family went wild over them, and they rose beautifully. Thanks! This is not only a keeper, but a recipe I think I'll laminate. You could even put sandwiches on these rolls, they were so big and fluffy.

So, so good! Very light and soft.  I didn't make crescents - I made 16 round rolls - they were HUGE - next time I'll make them smaller because they do rise a lot, but that's what makes them so light and fluffy!  Oh, and they are forgiving - I only used 2.25 tsp yeast (instead of 2.5) and they were still perfect.  I also forgot the egg and realized it after it had been in the bread machine a few min so I took the dough out, kneeded in an egg and put it back in.  Baked at 375 for 15 min after brushing with an egg/milk mix.

These were tasty, but not the best. It might have just been my oven, but I cooked these for 13 minutes (less than what the recipe called for), at 400, and the bottoms were too crispy. I think I would try this again, and bake the rolls at 350. The flavor was good, but I've had better.

The best rolls ever!  My husband could not stop eating them.  I made them in the bread machine, and then I always let my breads rise in a warm oven.  I let it preheat for 2-3 minutes with a bowl of warm water (glass or ceramic bowl) on the bottom rack.  Then I turn it off and put the bread on the top rack.  This way you always have a warm, draft-free place to let them rise.  I divided the dough and made them in pie plates as suggested by other reviewers.  I baked them for 10 min, and the tops got just a little too brown.  The insides were still great, but next time, I'll only bake them 8-9 minutes.

I cannot believe how good these are!!  I havent made them yet but my mother did and we got to eat them for dinner one night.  These are the most soft and fluffy rolls that I have ever had!  I ate them with some butter and honey but they are delicious all by themselves!  I never in my life have had a roll where a few days later they still taste as good as the first.  They stay fresh for awhile and this recipe makes plenty of leftovers!  This really amazed me!  lol  Definitely try these!  You wont regret it!  I cant wait to make them myself and have them again!  A favorite for sure!

I bake bread & rolls a couple times a week...and this is my go-to recipe for the best results.  Sweet, soft, and buttery.  So easy to mix in the bread machine on dough setting, then simply shape and let rise.

This is by far my favorite dinner roll recipe I've ever made.  And, it's really easy.  For whole wheat rolls, just sub in some wheat flour (maybe leave 1 cup of white flour, then the rest wheat), and they still come out nice and fluffy.

Its not what I expected, but was still good.  i was looking for a roll alittle more sweet. Mine turned out more salty then sweet.  These were good fried.  Just let the dough rise once then roll out, cut and fry in oil.

IMO they aren't sweet at all.  They need more sugar.  Nice texture but I could not use all that butter. I used less than half and it was still too much, they were slip sliding all over and were hard to roll crescent style.  I'll play with the recipe

Wonderful recipe!!!  Amazing Rolls.  light and fluffy,  Reminds of of O'Charley's rolls only much LESS greasy!  I did use bread flour instead of all purpose flour though.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and they were wonderful.  I used my kitchen aid to do all the hard work.  I didn't make the actual rolls small enough so I ended up with 12 very large rolls.  However they were very soft and quite tasty.  I plan on making them again.

I took k Praper's review and used her info.  I also don't have a bread maker and used my KitchenAid.   I also made them into balls rather than crescent.    As a matter of fact, after making them into rolls I froze quite a few to take out for another day.    Love these.

Just made these tonight. Easy to make and they came out looking great. The only part I didn't like is that there were a bit too sweet for my liking, and I like sweets! I guess just not on dinner rolls. Next time I will add less sugar.

This recipe is a keeper! I really liked the taste of the finished product. I followed the suggestions of another review by Suzy and mixed in my stand mixer starting with the softened butter, salt, sugar and egg. I then added the yeast, water, and milk mixture until combined. I then added the flour slowly as suggested. I also used quick rise yeast, but for some reason I have trouble getting a nice rise on all bread. I think it is because my house is just not warm and humid enough so I turned the oven on and heated to 200 degrees and shut it off. I opened the door and let it cool off a little. The I placed in rolls in the oven to rise and that did the trick. My husband loved them and so did my son. I think I will try a dinner roll shape next as I this time I made a croissant shape this time. Oh, I have a bread machine, but it is quicker to use the mixer and really easy!

The rolls are absolutely gorgeous!  They're delicate, light and tender with a lovely bite to them.  Great stuff and very forgiving.  I had to leave them in the bread machine too long and despite their abandonment, they were cut up and left to finish rising in the pan before baking.  They were still obviously wonderful.

Delicious dinner rolls. I made the traditional way as I don't have a kitchen aid or a bread machine. Kneeding bread dough is a great workout and my excuse for not going to the gym! Lol.. Time consuming but well worth the effort.

I love these rolls! The first few times I made them, they turned out awesome! But ever since then I am having trouble with them turning out.. "heavy".. I am in no way a good baker (please don't tell my Gramma haha) so if anyone can give me an idea of what I may be doing wrong unknowingly for them to do this, please let me know! Thanks!

I was looking for a light and fluffy dinner roll for Easter lunch. Found these to be much too dense. I wasn't happy with the final result.

made 16 balls in 2 buttered 8" round pans.  Got lots of compliments and I must say I thought they were pretty tasty myself.  I only got one, they were all gone by the time I got back to the table.

This recipe is a keeper!  This is the first time I have rated a recipe.  I just got my bread maker today and I was excited to try it out.  I followed the ingredients exactly.  When the dough was finished in the breadmaker I divided it into 36 balls and put 3 in each greased cup of a 12 muffin tin.  Then I brushed them with butter.  I let them rise for an hour and then baked them for 12 minutes at 400.  They turned out wonderful.

These were yummy. They reminded me of the kind you can buy at the store and bake. I only had margerine, you couldn't tell the difference. The dough was a little on the sticky side but after powdering it with flour it was fine.

Calling this a roll would be a vast understatement...the butter flavor's so pronounced, and the crescent shape gives it this awesome flaky, buttery layers...it's more of a crossaint. I learned a lot making tis recipe...for my oven, it absolutely mandatory that these be baked on the highest shelf...the ones on the bottoms had burnt bottoms but had overly light tops while the ones on the tops were perfectly golden on top, and light on the bottom, as they should be. As this was my first time making these, I only cut the butter by 1 TB...only used 2 TB in the dough, but since I'm a butter cutting freak...next time I'm using only 2 TB in the spread on the crescent...might be a little less buttery, but I think the great soft texture will still be there. And I want to try them as regular rolls( that way it cut out the 1/4 cup of butter altogether and would be less time consuming) I'm so proud of myself...I actually made great rolls that my whole family devoured! Oh, and I got 18 out of this recipe, and next time I'll make 20.

These are the best.I don't use a bread machine, but cannot imagine they could be any better. I am very oldfashion when it comes to baking breads and pastries. I usually make homemade croisants for my Thanksgiving & Christmas. Running out of time this year I made this recipe for Thanksgiving. The dough was so easy to work with I have never felt anything like it. I do all of my kneeding by hand. The smell while cooking was amazing. I read many reviews, I reduced the sugar to 1/4c and a lot shared that they had difficulty with burned bottoms. I adjusted for this by baking at 375* and you have to ALWAYS use parchment paper under any type of rolls or buiscuts. You will have chef quality bottoms. I use the unbleached paper and it is not any more costly that regular wax paper. I did have to bake about 15 minutes, but started checking at 10. Don't overbake, even if the tops are not browned too much. I was concerned about the moistness which did disapate once the initial baking heat reduced to warm for serving. I used a 9x13 and got 15 descent sized rolls, uniformly sized and shaped. Absolutely spectacular!

I just made these rolls today for our Thanksgiving lunch and I just loved them!
Fluffy and flavorfull, like I wanted.
I dont have a bread machine so I use the warm water from the recipe to bloom the yeast, I put the warm milk, sugar, and the bloomed yeast into a bowl I added the egg, salt and butte mixed everything and added the flour. Kneeded the dough for few minutes put it into a greased bowl to raise for about an hour then formed the rolls ( regular balls ) then inot a greased casserole and let them raise untill nice and puffy ( the oven was busy anyway ), brushed with milk and baked them until golden brown.
A success, thank you for this great recipe is in my favorites now.

These are awesome!  I have never been able to make good rolls until now, before I could never get them to rise properly or they would be too dense.  But I used the bread machine as the recipe states and they were perfect.  The only thing I did different was I did not make them into the buttered crescents, I made 24 dinner rolls.  I am so excited to have found a successful roll recipe.  I will definitely make these again!!!

I made these rolls last Thanksgiving and they were a hit. This year everyone asked me to make them again. They are so easy to make and are all but fool proof. Since I only use lowfat milk, I skip the water and just add more milk. I also serve them with honey butter that I make in the food processor with 1/2 c honey and a stick and a half of soft butter- yum.

We really enjoyed these rolls.  They reminded me of another roll recipe I have called overnight buns.  I baked these for 10 minutes at 350.  I would make these again, they're fast and easy.

these came out perfect, so nice to look and smelled divine. I cut them up and put home made pineapple jam in there and served them for tea. Everybody loved them. I followed the recipe to the dot. didn't change a thing.

Turned out really well.  I used this recipe to make hot dog buns and the turned out beautiful.  I got a lot of compliments on them and we used the rest of them the next day for sandwiches and they also worked well for that.

Followed the recipe and used my bread machine for the first rise. Formed the dough into a dozen little balls and baked in a muffin pan. This gave me 12 delicious rolls and I would not change a thing.

This is a keeper.  After reading others I also do not have a bread machine so I threw the dry ingredients together with  2.5tsp instant yeast.  Warmed the water, milk,butter then added the egg which was warmed in a cup before opening. Mixed the dry into wet cup at a time. Also needed to add about half cup extra flour while kneading. I made round rolls which did not last the night since all were gone.  Have made this twice already and intend to try as cinnamon rolls when I have the time.

OMG!  The best dinner roll I have EVER had!  I did the full dough cycle on my bread machine, and rolled them into little balls instead of crescent shapes.  Then I baked at 375 for about 15 minutes.  So sweet, soft, so darn good.  I will never buy store bought again.  In fact, I'm making a 2nd batch right now just for the heck of it!

OH WOW!!!! What an AMAZING recipe!! I doubled the recipe, however, I attempted to add a doubled recipe of ingredients to my bread machine, and it just could not handle the load. I dumped it into my Kitchenaid Stand Mixer and that did the trick!  My family of 7 devoured these scrumptous crescents.  Reminded us all of the fresh bread served at our local Ryan's Restaurant. This recipe will forever be used in our house! Thank you for sharing!

Pretty good, basic dinner roll recipe. Made exactly as written. Weren't as light and fluffy as I like my dinner rolls but the fam didn't have any problems eating them all up. They were actually better as leftovers the next day microwaved for 10 seconds with a little butter and honey.

Even though I made a few changes to this recipe, I'm convinced it would've been great as written anyway. First of all, I halved the recipe being that I only needed dinner rolls for two people. I used white bread flour instead of all purpose flour, and I used sea salt as ususal. Also, I totally forgot about spreading the butter on top of my dough round until after I had already rolled up my crescents. So I just melted the butter and brushed it on the rolls - once before baking and once half way through. Great recipe, the rolls had a light crust and fluffy insides with good subtle flavor. If I was going to change anything I'd just add a pinch more yeast and maybe an extra tablespoon or two of sugar for more flavor, and I definitely want to remember rolling the butter into the crescents next time. I might experiment with using some whole wheat flour or some honey instead of sugar as well.

The first time I made the rolls, I used a mixer and the texture of the rolls turned out part bread part biscuit... not sure if I did something wrong.  They were not as fluffy as I hoped they would be, but they were still good. I found the dough to be extremely sticky and had to add extra flour.  I also tried making cinnamon rolls with half of the dough, but they turned out more like cinnamon bread than rolls. 
The 2nd time I tried this recipe, the rolls turned out PERFECT.  They were sooo fluffy, soft and soooo YUMMY.  What I did differently...
1)I used my bread machine AND 2)bread flour to make the dough... I had to go somewhere so when the dough was finished, I put it in a buttered bowl (Pam spray) and covered it with a damp cloth. After a couple hours, the dough had risen so I punched it down and rolled and buttered my dough out as the recipe called.  I let the crecent dough rise for another hour before I baked them.  I also cut the amount of sugar to 1/4 C and it was perfect... not too sweet.

Easy to follow recipe as with some other users I don't have a bread maker so did it all by hand. Wonderful textured bread. As with most kiwi's who are used to a savoury bread we found this too sweet to have with dinner but loved it with jams etc.

Excellent- I used half the batch for dinner rolls (about six balls of dough- enough for dinner) and rolled out the rest for cinnamon rolls- enough for dessert.

These were easy and very good. I did the non-machine kind and followed another cooks directions...made them into 16 balls. I subbed honey for the sugar and smart balance for the butter(I always do that!). The only thing I would do differently is either grease the cookie sheet or spread a little corn meal on it so they don't stick. These are easy and delicious!

These are amazing dinner rolls and so easy with the bread machine.  I recently moved to a high altitude location and find that I have to make appropriate adjustments to most recipes for baked items.  In my haste to make these, I didn't even think about the altitude and followed the recipe as written.  The rolls were delicious.  This is now my new "go-to" recipe for dinner rolls!!

Good rolls.  400 degrees was way too hot.  The bottoms were quite burned.  I'll try 350 next time.

I made these rolls for Easter dinner-- I doubled the recipe and finished them at about 3 AM the night before.  I put them in the fridge on their first rise (as I don't have a breadmaker, I used the Kitchenaid method) because I had to work.  As with many yeast bread recipes, I feel that the slow rise in colder temperatures brings out a more complex flavor.  That being said, I completed the recipe as follows with the addition of a simple eggwash before putting them in the oven.  I tried one as they were cooling on the racks and I was very disappointed in the flavor versus "time spent" ratio.  I felt that they weren't anything spectacular.

Then I tried another one as I was packing the food up to bring to the family's house for dinner and they were great!  They pulled apart wonderfully and the complex flavor was complimented by the butter.  I don't know about everyone else's experience with this recipe, but I think they taste better the day after.  Good roll standard recipe.

This recipe is by far the very best yeast roll recipe I have ever made I have searched and tried several yeast roll recipes NONE have been as good as this I use the Kitchen-Aid Method and it works perfect.  I made 1/2 the roll in rolls and the other half into cinnamon Rolls.  Perfect every Time.  Thanks

these were ok, but i altered them pretty significantly.  i replaced the butter with oil.  I made potato bread instead using 3c flour + 3/4 c cooked mashed potatoes so that the bread would stay moister.  This was a critical change!  they became a billion times better.  As a result, i reduced the total liquid (milk + water) from 1 c to 3/4 c.  they are also really good if you brush honey on the rolls after the second rise, but before you bake them.  As a basic dough, this recipe is pretty phenomenal.  i am going to try making onion bread or another salty variety next.  they are soft, pillowy, moist, and delicious, esp with the potatoes.  try this recipe!

Delicous!  Made exactly as it was written but made round rolls rather than a crescent shape.  My husband and son couldn't get enough of them.

Thanks for such an easy recipe for tasty rolls!

I made my first batch in the bread machine and it came out sooo good! The bread is so light and fluffy and not dense at all. My family loves it.

This is a super recipe. I followed the gal's directions for use with the Kitchenaid mixer, but followed the recipe's ingredients exactly. Mine turned out light and fluffy and beautiful and delicious. My family was extremely impressed with me and my cooking, and I didn't let them know it was your recipe that made me out the hero of the evening.

This recipe is great. I don't have a bread machine so I just used my Kitchen Aide Mixer. They were excellent homemade rolls with all the trimmings including the great aroma from the oven.  This is definately going to be on the table for family dinners and holidays.

Good rolls. Definitely sweet. More of a dessert bread for me. Dough would be great as a cinnamon roll base. As a dinner roll it was too sweet for me.

I love to make bread, and this recipe was good, but not great. I have had better rolls. However, having said that, if you are looking for any easy recipe that will make a nice dinner roll, you found one.

I didn't use a bread machine because I enjoy kneading dough myself. I dissolved the yeast and 1 tbsp of the sugar in the warm water and let it proof for about 15 minutes. I warmed the milk in the microwave then melted the butter in the milk. After mixing in the remain sugar, the salt, and the egg I added the milk mixture to the yeast mixture then stirred in enough bread flour to make the dough manageable for kneading. These rolls were very nice. Just the right touch of sweetness.

These made the best rolls!!!

I made the receipe exactly as shown except I used my bread machine on the dough setting.  Then I made 12 balls and placeed them in a 9X13 pan, covered them and let rest for 1 hour.  I then basted them with melted butter and baked until golden brown.  They turned out big, soft, fluffy and great.  Also great for the next couple days as we used then for ham sandwiches.

Great, nice and tender. The rolls were large for dinner, I might make them smaller next time, that way most people would take one. That would give me twice as many also. I think the size put a couple of people off.

I really liked this recipe. I made them into cinnamon rolls. They turned out wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly, besides the whole cinnamon roll part. I like that these weren't too light, they were dense enough to not feel like a cloud, but they still tasted light and melt-in-your-mouthish. I WILL be using the recipe again and again.

Excellent rolls, averaging 5 stars. For me, making them as written, rated about 4 stars. Whereas substituting honey and using just 3 1/2 cups flour, adds 2 more (6 stars). These are now my favorite rolls to make. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.

I just made these for Thanksgiving. They were very easy compared to others I have done, and turned out great! I was worried they would be too sweet, which I am not fond of in a dinner roll, but they were perfect. 

I kneaded the dough in a bowl( no breadmaker). This is somewhat sticky dough, so I found I needed to work in at least an additional 3/4 cup flour to make it workable and rubbery for rolling out, but that was fine. 

Also, if you roll it out on a floured surface, and the rolls come out a bit "dusty" on the bottoms after cooking, baste with melted butter after they are out of the oven. They look perfect, and browned very well.

Caught my boyfriend snacking on one this morning, without asking....(smile)

These buns were a great success! Next time I will try to use less sugar because I don't like sweet buns. Nevertheless, the texture is really soft and the taste is very good. I halved the recipe so that it would be easier to knead.

This is a delicious dough.  Sweet but not too sweet...reminded me of the sweet rolls at a popular steakhouse.  Instead of making dinner rolls, I used the dough to make monkey bread.  Yum!

I've been making these rolls for 6 years now. Family, friends, and neighbors swear my rolls are THE best! They all beg for my leftovers. The greatest thing is their ability to be used in sweet roll recipes. I divide the dough in half and make 1/2 of them into dinner rolls and the other half into orange or cinnamon rolls.

Oh My these are the best rolls ever. I made them into crescents and put them on a parchment lined cookie sheet to rise and then baked them. I cannot wait to make them into cinnamon rolls with Cream cheese frosting. Yum Thanks for a great easy recipe.

These are super easy with an excellent sweet bread taste.  But they are not too sweet to make into other types of rolls.  I made these twice now as sandwich buns.  After removing from my bread machine, I use my food scale and weigh 2 oz. of dough each.  This makes about 18 buns.  Shape into buns, let rise and bake as directed.  I didn't even use the additional butter and they were delicious!

Delicious! I used a little more flour, my dough was too sticky, I also used my mixer.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wow, the only thing I've had better is mom's potato rolls.  
These get 5 stars for sure as my 5 and 6 year old helped with the kneading (we did the traditional route instead of bread machine) and shaping of the dough.  Obviously not a very delicate dough, but it turns out with such delicate tasting rolls.
Thank you for posting this recipe!

Very good rolls. I have made these rolls a few times. This last time I didn't roll them out I just divided dough into 16 balls and they turned out just as good.

I made these for my affluent aunt and uncle, they raved over them and said they have never had better.  (This means alot, they travel alot and eat out alot.)  They had to have the recipe and my uncle has called me many times to thank me for teaching my aunt how to make these rolls.

My first time cooking with yeast, and I am so impressed with how this recipe came out!  I made it by hand using the helpful instructions the other reviewers made (sort reviews by most helpful to find them)and made litle rolls which I then made into pani popo.  Everyone here was over the moon with how good they were and now we can have them hot and fresh whenever we want.  For those who haven't heard of it, pani popo is buns cooked with a sweet coconut sauce.

Very good rolls, replacing my previous recipe with this one.  Very similar to restaurant rolls.  I reduced the sugar to 1/4 c, and that is plenty sweet for me.  I prefer putting two small balls of dough into each muffin cup, or making two 8" round pans of "parker house" style rolls.

Excellent!  I don't use a bread machine, so I made these like so many of you.  I used one ball of dough to make the dinner rolls, and the other ball to make cinnamon rolls.  Talk about killing 2 birds with one stone, I had dinner rolls to go with my pot roast, and cinnamon rolls for dessert!

I made these today without a bread machine.  I did make some changes, since I am a chronic recipe changer!!  I used 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup of oats.  I also used molasses for some of the sugar.  I made round rolls and made 9 large ones.  They baked for about 10 minutes and the result was tender and delicious rolls!!!  My kids gobbled them up!!  Thanks!

I really enjoyed these. They did not rise as much as I had expected until I put them in the oven and then they puffed up beautifully. Great taste. I will try them for breakfast next. Yummy!!

Excellent! Bread machine worked like a charm. I brushed melted butter over the top of rolls before baking and sprinkled with a bit of sea salt for extra flavor.

Not sure where things went wrong.  First the  rolls started unravelling as they were baking.  Then the bottoms burned before the tops were brown.  I had followed other reviewers tips to bake at 375, but I even lowered the temp to 350 half way through.  The rolls still tasted good, but I am disappointed after reading so many good comments.  Not sure if I will make again.

I used Spelt flour instead of White flour and it turned out a little crumbly, but I believe it was due to my own error.  I will add gluten next time I make them with spelt. Other then that very easy and good.

Okay I did not have a bread machine so I tried the recipe anyway after reading the reviews.  Something did not work.  I heated the liquids before adding the yeast but it never did bubble.....so then the rolls never did rise very big.  I am looking for a recipe for rolls you can get in good restaurants and these did not work! The kind that melt in your mouth and that is all you want to eat!  Maybe I will get a bread maker and try it again since it has such great reviews.

I used this recipe for both cinnamon rolls, and dinner rolls, both turned out delicious. Not as fluffy and airy as I was hoping for, but I added a little honey to the recipe to sweeten it up and that may have hindered the rising. I also coated the finished dinner rolls in honey butter! My Fiance loved these rolls!

I have been experimenting with different recipes for rolls, and I think I have found the winner.  These rolls are so easy to make on the bread machine dough cycle.  Then just shape and bake.  They turned out light and fluffy with a rich, slightly sweet taste.  Thank you for a great recipe.

We thought these were good but not anything to rave about.  I'm wondering if it's just because my mom always made fantastic rolls and so I grew up with eating great dinner rolls?  A good recipe, though.

Delicious rolls. Recipe was forgiving, I'm sure I messed up on the amount of flour but adjusted the water to get a good consistency and it came out just fine.

This is a great recipe, with a really good flavor.  I made this with splenda instead of sugar, and it tastes great.  I make this as a loaf in my bread machine, instead of rolls, and it always turns out great.  This is pretty much the staple bread in our house!

After trying 5 or more different bread/roll recipes I finally found one that makes my husband say "Wow!". He came home from work and ate 5 of them right from the hot pan! They are soft and fluffy with a subtle sweetness. I made them as regular rolls and not crescents. This recipe is definately a keeper. Thanks for posting it!

Oh my goodness!!  I've have had requests to make these roll for every family gathering since Thanksgiving (which was the first time I tried them) and I just got a call to whip up a batch before our Mother's day gathering.  They turn out perfect every time.  No changes or additions (although I should mention they are a great base for cinnamon rolls or sticky buns).  These are the best - tasty, sweet - just delicious!

Made awesome rolls. So easy to make! I made the recipe with just a little extra golden brown sugar (1/4 cup) and it tastes just like a local favorite called baked manapua! Thanks so much for the great recipe.

The whole family loved these rolls.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  I did make them into cloverleaf rolls by rolling the dough into balls and putting 3 balls into each cup of a muffin tin.  Very easy to make...thank you!

I've made these several times since finding the recipe.  They are truly yummy and very easy to work with.  My family of five nearly polishes them off at one meal, with a few left over for the next night.  This has become our new bread machine recipe.

Fantastic recipe!  Served them last night with lemon chicken and our guests raved about them.  This was despite the fact that I had forgotten to put the paddle inside the bread machine and  had to dump everything out, mix the dough by hand and let the machine finish the kneading and rising.  I made them just like the recipe advised and used a pizza cutter to divide the dough into wedges. They rose beautifully and the "pillowy" texture is a great description for them. We can not buy "Pillsbury Doughboy" type dinner rolls where we live overseas so these will be made A LOT!!!! Thanks so much for the AllRecipes site.

I wouldn't say this recipe was awful but it surely wasn't what I was looking for.  It was very doughy more like a loaf of bread than any "roll".  I won't make this one again.

These were GREAT!!  The dough was a little sticky, maybe next time I'll add a little more flour, maybe 1/4C.  The flavor was fantastic, light and pillowy (is that a word?)We had them for Christmas and they were more than enough, we had a 9" pan and a cookie sheet!  Today my daughter in law asked me if I had some more bread dough?  Guess I'll be making them again soon, thanks for sharing.

Made these last night for dinner and while the dough was wonderful to work with, and they tasted great, I found them to be a bit on the tough side and were not really flaky. It could have been the margarine, I usually use real unsalted butter but just didn't have any, or it could have been I had them too close together for baking, maybe should have broken out another baking pan. I'll make them again for sure. Great recipe to experiment with. :)

FABULOUS.... these are the best homemade dinner rolls ever!  I have also used the dough to make cinnamon rolls... which were devoured as soon as they came out of the oven!  Soft, slightly sweet - simply delicious.

My husband loved these rolls.  He watched me make them, and still asked if they were homemade!  They do taste a bit like "The Dough Boy's" (Pilsbury) recipe,  but it's fun to come really close and you can pronounce all of the ingredients!

Don't make these rolls unless you are in the mood for incessant compliments from everyone who eats them. I brought them to a dinner party and one person even asked how much I would charge him to make another batch! I used half/half cream instead of milk and I made them by hand instead of with a bread machine and I formed them into 12 regular buns in a 9x13 pan. I thought they were plenty sweet though, I wouldn't use any more sugar than what is called for. I was afraid that 400 degrees would be too hot, but it was perfect.

The best dinner rolls! I only baked small 12 rolls for my hubby and me, this recipe made my hubby say "My Grandma would love you!(she past away few years ago) These are just like the rolls my Grandma used to bake for me and my brother!" Excellent and a versatile recipe I have added to my favorite and will be making for holidays and on many occasion!

This bread is very good. It does taste a LOT like the rolls I used to eat in school(which I always loved). I make regular dinner rolls with this dough and not the wedges. I have made this many times. The only changes I make are: I use 1 1/2 tsp. salt and 4 C. Flour. If you make rolls with these be careful not to burn the bottoms.

Really good recipe!  Clarification for all those whose reviews said they didn't understand the shaping process.  To make the crescent shape, just think of rolling out and cutting pizza dough.  Then roll up from the wide, or crust end, and bring together the points together.

These rolls are the best ever! They are a family favorite here and are fabulous in the bread machine (dough cycle). We've rolled/shaped them many different ways. Very versatile and very yummy! They're even good using half wheat flour when you actually want to be healthy...

This recipe made excellent sweet light fluffy rolls. I usually give them an egg yolk glaze before baking them for 15 minutes to make them golden and crunchy on top. I have always omitted the extra butter and just made them into normal rolls. Usually I make an extra batch and freeze them - just pop them into the oven for 12 minutes and you have that lovely fresh baked home made smell and taste.

Very easy, ever so slightly sweet roll with a perfect, light texture.  Add more sugar/honey if you want it sweeter.  I followed the recipe exactly and brushed butter over the beautiful golden tops after they came out of the oven.  I came out with 24 good sized rolls- I would imagine 16 rolls would have been huge! Very nice recipe.

The absolute best roll recipe I have ever used. Very easy. These have become a must at every family event and have replaced a more labor intensive family favorite recipe. I think they taste best in crescent shape.

This is my first attempt at homemade rolls, and they turned out WONDERFUL.  I made some Texas Roadhouse butter for them and boyfriend loved them. They made up almost two dozen, and were gone that day!  I will never need another recipe for homemade rolls.  I plan on making these at Thanksgiving, Christmas, and any other function that I can so everyone can enjoy them.

This is such an easy recipe.  I made the rolls with 1/2 of the dough and cinnamon rolls with the other half.  Both came out delicious.  This will be the recipe I use from now on.

These are amazing.  They tasted like restaurant-style rolls to me.  (I just divided the dough into about 10 pieces and let it rise again then baked). This weekend I am going to try this recipe to make homemade cinnamon rolls! Try this recipe-it's great!

Absolutely the best recipe for the bread machine that I have ever found. Easy and consistantly makes a delicious roll.  My family loves them.  My sons wanted to know what the special occasion was, when I first made them, but they are so easy and SO GOOD that we have them all the time now.  And they are good enough to take to any potluck or dinner that you want to make an impression at! I don't have to be embarrased by my lack of ablility to make good rolls any longer. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I am so tickled with this recipe.  I tried these rolls and they are fantastic.  They are so buttery tasting you don't need to put anything on them.  I am now making them for Easter dinner.  I definitely put these in my recipe box.  They are also so easy!! I did not use the bread machine but mixed as they said and let the mixture of water,milk,sugar heat to 115 degrees.  I added the yeast and timed 5 minutes.  I put flour,salt and egg in bowl.  After 5 minutes I mixed together.  I let rise 1 hour each time.  Perfect!!Thank you.

This is a great recipe to have up your sleeve.  It was really easy and made a wonderful dough.   Everyone loved the rolls even though I burned them a little.  I'll try to bake them a little more gently next time, and I will double the batch and save some dough for another meal.

These are so versatile!  I made half of the dough, dinner rolls and the other half cinnamon rolls.  They both turned out wonderful after baking, very soft & fluffy!  And these are way to easy to make, which is a huge plus.  Thanks Donna for sharing this great recipe!

These rolls are excellent; moist internally, soft crust. They reminded me of the big, buttery rolls we got from the school cafeteria. That should read as a COMPLIMENT, for those out there who had poor school cafeterias. :) Huge family hit.

I loved this recipe. The rolls were incredibly soft on the inside. I did double the yeast as I felt the dough felt too tough   I’m looking forward to trying these again and adding some savory herbs or cheese

Absolutely delicious. These remind me of the rolls my mom made every Christmas. I didn’t change one single thing except I baked them at 375 for 14-15 minutes instead of 400 for 10 minutes. I was worried they would be too brown on the bottom at 400. Turned out perfect.

My family loves these rolls.  Made exactly as written.  Sometimes, I make ahead and par-bake then put them into a large bag into fridge.  The next day put them into oven to finish baking  Thank you for a great recipe!

These are delicious! I’ve made them in my bread maker and also the traditional way, and they always turn out great, though I think the bread maker way is slightly better.

This has been my go to dinner roll recipe for many years. I haven’t found an alternative and why deviate when it’s versatile and a sure hit with everyone in the family. Brush butter on top or flavor it with butter and herbs it will be a sure favorite.

I went without a bread maker and ended up kneading it mostly by hand (Kitchen Aid broke mid-knead!). I let it rise in the bowl for an hour then again after forming the crescents. I also used bread flour. They turned out SO light, fluffy, and delicious!

I overworked my dough as I don’t have a bread machine, so the rolls came out pretty dense. However, they had excellent flavor and were still good! Used the same recipe for cinnamon roll dough, hand mixed the dough and made sure not to over work it. Dough turned out beautifully as did the cinnamon rolls!

I use this recipe for cinnamon buns, I put it in my breadmaker on the pasta/dough setting then roll it out, put butter, brown sugar and cinnamon then roll up, cut and let rise again. then in the oven at 350 for 20-30 minutes. They turn out just like my great grandmother used to make every time! I highly recommend it.

Reminds me of Rhodes dinner rolls the way Granna always made them, drenched in butter! I used margarine and almond milk, so mine were dairy free and delicious!

They are delicious fresh, and it gives you one of those "warm fluffy feelings", but I tried saving mine and they go  stale really fast. Next time I will just invite my friends over and that won't happen!

Came out great and tasted great!  I made it into cloverleaf rolls.  Next time (tonight) I need to decrease the size of the balls of dough as they became too large and lost that distinctive shape.  I should easily be able to get 30 rolls next time.

So light and buttery. I am making my third batch. Just a warning, you don't need to raise for 1 hour, I rose mine for about 25 minutes using the oven method and they were perfect.

These are outstanding! Like many others, I don't have a bread maker, so had to do it by hand. I don't make these into croissants, but standard dinner roll shape. After proving the yeast in the water, milk, and tablespoon of sugar, I mixed the rest of it together. I then kneaded it for about 10ish min, then let it rise. I usually punch it down two times before shaping them into rolls. One time I made them with my sourdough starter instead of the instant yeast, and I didn't like them too much as just a roll (plain nor buttered), however they were delicious for sandwiches!

I don’t have a bread maker, so I did it as others have mentioned. I’m also impatient so I didn’t always wait long enough. I made half of the dough as rolls to go with our soup, and the rest I waited a little longer and made crescent rolls. The crescent rolls were pretty but the rolls were actually better. Slightly undercooked, and with some butter, they were better than any restaurant rolls I’d ever had. My husband and I ate way too many!

I made this just like the directions said to. I made it in my bread maker and it was so easy after that to roll it out. I will want to do this again and again.
I just wish I could double the recipe in the bread maker so I may make it in my kitchen aide when I need more rolls than 16.

Fabulous recipe ! Followed as is, but turned it into 12 huge  cinnamon rolls, with the traditional sticky bun bottom , with pecans.....so yummy. After rolling and cutting  into 12 wheels and placing in pan that had sugar ,pecan mixture, I let them rise in a warm oven for 45 minutes. Then I pulled them out of the oven and preheated oven to 350 degrees, and baked then for 25-30 minutes. Pull and immediately flip them onto parchment or foil, gooey side up. They were huge and so yummy......thanks Donna. Beautiful dough to work with.

These rolls are easy to make and look like you've spent a lot of time making them.  The only complaint I have is that they taste  dry/stale after a day or two.  I would definitely make them again.

Just  wanted to say thanks for the instructions for not having a bread machine. This is a recipe I always used for my dinner rolls until my bread machine broke so I was so happy to see how you made them without the machine.  They turned out perfectly.  I do miss my bread machine though.  Thanks again. This was for K Praper

Great recipe!  I don’t have bread machine so I used my normal kitchen aid with the bread dough hook that I just bought on line.  I did twice the recipe.

Loved them!! I don’t have a bread maker so it was a little work - took me back to the time of making rolls homemade with my grannny !! ??  They turned out great - made them with Thanksgiving dinner and they were a hit !

Well, these rolls rock!! I even screwed up and put the butter in with the dough then just coated the tops with melted butter before and after cooking. Delicious!! Thanks for sharing. Made a great addition to our Thanksgiving.

My go to recipe.   I've made this recipes at least 20 times.  They don't last long.  We have some friends that can eat multiples when they come over.  I make 16 rolls, put 2 in a small zip bag, then put the little bags in a gallon zipper bag, and freeze.  The only change I made was to double the sugar, my crowd likes there rolls just a little sweeter.

This is my go-to recipe for dinner rolls. It is very similar to the recipe my grandmother used. When I know I won't have time,  sometimes I make the dough, form the rolls, put them in the baking pan, cover them with plastic wrap and put them in the refrigerator overnight.  Wake up in the morning and pop them in the oven at 400F or 200C.  The texture of these rolls when they are refrigerated overnight is WONDERFUL. I have also substituted 1 cup of wheat flower for 1 cup of the bread flour for a nice change.  As a side note, for those whose bread came out crumbly, If you make it by hand: add three cups of flour  in the initial mix. Put just enough of the other 3/4 cups of flour so the dough can be kneaded. The less flour over 3 cups you put in, the better the texture will be.

Absolutely the best rolls and so easy to make!  To save time, I made two ropes of dough and cut each rope with scissors into eight equal pieces.  Then placed on a lightly greased cookie sheet, brushed rolls with melted butter, let rise again and then baked at 375 degrees for 11 minutes.

They would have turned out great, maybe if the temperature was lower, or I flipped them over after 5 minutes. I have a brand new stove and oven, and the rolls burnt on the bottom and weren't done on the top, after only 10 minutes. Otherwise, they would have been delicious.

Another family recipe gets replaced! Made the dough in a bread maker and baked it in a conventional oven.   Really tasty.        Looks like I won't be losing weight this winter.

I love these rolls!! So easy to make. My late partner tortillas obvi people over for my homemade soup and these rolls.

Someone said they were to sweet and crumbly. Either they used to much flour or either killed the yeast or the yeast was bad. If you follow the directions they will be light and fluffy.

excellent recipe! Made into 16 rolls and divided into two 9” round pans. The first rise took longer than expected but after that it was smooth sailing;) Baked at 375 for 13 minutes. Super fluffy, lightly sweet and deliciously buttery all with a golden brown top- I honestly couldn’t ask for anything more! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

These rolls were Delicious! Very light and flavorful! You can form them into any type of roll you prefer. My tip is to make sure you use a high quality butter (Kerrygold or similar) It makes all the difference in the flavor.

This recipe made awesome dinner rolls.  I live near Denver so altitude is a consideration.    I used my bread machine but made the following alterations - added a couple of tablespoons extra of milk, decreased the sugar by a tablespoon and used only  2 teaspoons of yeast.   Otherwise I followed the recipe.  I did find that they cooked really fast - probably 6 minutes.  That may also be contributed to the altitude here.   I found the dough was a bit soft to spread on the softened butter.  Next time I will melt the butter and brush onto the dough before cutting into wedges and then brush the tops of the rolls with melted butter before cooking.  Now I have to try to keep them safe from being eaten before my Easter dinner!

I have always struggled with making rolls, they never turned out quite right, until I found this recipe! I make these almost weekly now and they always turn out insanely delicious! Pillow soft and the perfect amount of sweetness to them! I follow the recipe exactly except that I bake them at 375 degrees instead of 400 degrees. Every event I take these to and every time I serve them to guests in our home I get rave reviews over them and requests for the recipe. They are the perfect side to soups and salads and pasta dishes.

These are great! I make them in Alberta so I add more flour than the recipe calls for to account for elevation, about 30g extra. I also reduce the sugar to 1/4cup as they're too sweet otherwise. I've made these rolls dozens of times and they always get rave reviews. I started making them in my mini cupcake tin and make 24 rolls per batch, and they bake to a decent size dinner roll. I also brush with meted butter as soon as they come out of the oven. These rolls are lovely and a staple on family holidays!

The rolls were very good, and had a nice texture. I would have liked them better if they were denser or firmer.  The biggest reason for only 4 stars, though, is I was hoping for that strong "yeasty" smell I've experienced in other baker's rolls.  Any ideas how to  make that happen?

I use this recipe to make a large 9x13 pan of standard dinner rolls as opposed to the crescent version explained here. the only changes I make are not to coat them with the 1/4 c of butter, and I bake them at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes. Other than that, I follow the recipe. They're a hit every time.

Made as directed, delicious results. Also, I used them when I made grilled hotdogs and they were amazing as a hotdog roll! Thank you! Love these!  They also freeze extremely well, I forgot to put the butter on half of them and didn’t notice the difference. Lovely rolls!

Good dough, easy to work with.  Mix all ingredients together in my KA mixer and let rise.   I rolled balls and put in a pie dish as another reviewer suggested. I brushed an egg on the balls and then put in oven.  Rolls come out nice and golden.  Wrapped and stuck in freezer for two days. —just heat up and enjoy!

I really thought I had ruined these because my dough didn't rise much. They still ended up buttery and delicious. Luckily they rose quite a bit while cooking. The only thing I would do differently is put them on a higher rack in the oven because at 15 minutes they were golden brown but a bit too dark on the bottom (but luckily didn't taste burned).  I can't wait to try these again with the other (proven to work) brand of yeast I have!

It took me a few times to get this recipe just right. I tried to cut down sugar, rolling them out differently and making the rolls smaller. The recipe as written is perfect ( I do like smaller rolls so I cut them into 12 crescents). Since Thanksgiving, I’ve made these 3 times and can’t get enough of these rolls. Breakfast, lunch and dinner!

Wow!  These are the best rolls I've ever made!  I was looking for the perfect roll recipe to adopt, and this is it!  The dough is lovely to work with, soft but not too soft, easy to work with.  And the rolls turn out very light and airy, just delicious.  As many of you wrote, I do not have a bread machine, so made these the old fashioned way, using the method posted by Summer_lover.  The first time I made them, I followed the recipe exactly.  The second time, I tried a couple of variations.  I increased the sugar to 1/2 cup.  Then, I used half the dough to make crescents, which I sprinkled with parmesan cheese after spreading with the butter.  With the other half, I made parkerhouse rolls.  After rolling out the dough, I used a 3" cookie cutter to cut out rounds of dough.  Then I dipped each in melted butter and folded in half before placing in a dish to rise the second time.  They both turned out to be big hits with my family!  I'm looking forward to trying other variations as well.  Thank you, Donna, for an incredible recipe!

These were great! Like a previous reviewer, I mixed the water and milk, heated in the microwave for about a minute, poured into mixing bowl, stirred in the sugar and then the yeast. 2.5 teaspoons active dry yeast from the jar. Waited 10 minutes, then mixed in the salt, butter and egg, then slowly mixed the flour in using the dough hook attachment. I found that I did not need all of the flour, probably about 1 cup less than called for. Let dough rise 45 minutes in the bowl, covered. Punched down and cut into 90-100g balls, placed in muffin tins. Let rise little more (20-30 min?) Brushed with egg white mixture and baked. Excellent!  Thanks!!

Excellent soft sweet tasty rolls.  The only change was I mixed the dough in the KitchenAid mixer which pulled it together and then kneaded the dough for a few minutes.  These rolls are now the go-to rolls for any dinner.

Great roll recipe! I used a bread machine and it turned out great. If your bread machine instructions say to put the yeast directly into the machine with the other ingredients without prepping it first, do not do it! I prep all my yeast, including instant yeast! It improves the rising of the dough. Mix the warm water with the sugar, and dump the packet of yeast in. Let it sit until it’s getting a little foamy & has that yummy yeast smell. While you’re waiting, warm the milk and mix in the egg and softened butter. Dump that into the bread pan, followed by the flour and salt. Then stick the pan in the machine & you’re set!

Perfect recipe! I followed it exactly and made 14 delicious, perfect looking crescent rolls, with one half of the dough and eight oooey gooey, yummy, cinnamon raisin rolls, with the other half!!! Thanks for this amazing recipe and the truly helpful suggestions for adaptations to it, from fellow Allrecipes reviewers. This is a must try and a definite  keeper!!!

Very tasty dinner rolls, will definitely make them again. Made as instructed in the bread maker, which for mine took closer to 3 hours from start to finish.

I made a triple batch for Easter. I did not use a bread machine, just my stand mixer with the dough hook. These rolls were super easy. I made 42 rolls in muffin pans, I just pinched off little bits of dough made them round and put two balls in each greased muffin tin.  I then brushed them with melted butter and baked. I STILL had dough left so I made 16 into cresents, like the recipe said. These were a fun variation.  Will defiantly make these again.

These were an absolute hit at Easter dinner!  I had people coming back for thirds!  I will definitely be making these again.  I followed the recipe exactly and had no difficulties.

These are our go-to rolls for special occasions. I don't have a bread maker so I put the milk, water, sugar, salt and butter in a saucepan and over low heat, stir until dissolved (keeping the temp below 110). Then I add it to my mixer with the flour, egg and yeast and knead until smooth. Proceed as per the rest of the recipe.

I don't have a bread machine so I used my bosch to knead the dough.  I let the dough raise in my refrigerator for three hours since I was going to be gone.  I rolled out and shaped my rolls and let them raise again for 45 minutes before baking.  They were perfect!  Some of the most light delicious rolls I've ever made.

I made them by hand without a bread machine and I forgot to let them rise. I got compact bread paperweights, lol. They're very tasty though. I liked them, but my husband didn't.

This is my go-to dinner roll and cinnamon roll recipe. The dough comes out nice and elasticy, and it's easy to work with. I've made it with dry active and rapid rise yeast. Either way, the rolls turn out equally fabulous.

This is my "go-to" recipe for both dinner rolls and caramel rolls.
The bread machine got double duty yesterday, making two pans (9 rolls each) of caramel rolls, and a dozen lovely buns.

Easy to make, I do not have a bread machine so followed similar procedure to when I make bread.  Proofed yeast first.  2.5 tsp of dry active yeast.  My kids asked for seconds and thirds.

Wow!  Fantastic!  I didn't even let it rise the full time the second time, and the rolls turned out great!  Everyone at the table loved them.  The bread was light and fluffy inside, and had just enough texture on the outside.
The way I made these was based on another reviewer's comments - I combined the water and milk, then microwaved them.  Added in the sugar.  Checked the temperature to make sure it wasn't too hot, then added in the yeast from the packets I have.  Let it sit for about 15 minutes, then mixed in the salt, egg, and butter.  Added in the flour about a cup at a time, mixing well in-between.  Turned out the dough onto a moderately-floury surface and kneaded it for a couple minutes.  Put it in an oven-safe bowl that I had sprayed with cooking spray, then covered it was plastic wrap that also had cooking spray on it.  Put the bowl in a warm oven (I had preheated the oven to 160, then turned off the heat).  Left it in there for an hour.  Took it out, punch down the down, then split the dough into two.  Each portion was rolled out into a 12-inch circle.  Cut each circle into 8 wedges.  Brushed the top of each wedge with melted butter, then rolled each wedge into the specified shape.  I only let it sit for about 15-20 minutes.  Baked it at 375 for close to 15 minutes, pulling them out when golden.

I used oster bread machine dough setting, add wet ingredients first, then dry ingredients. Made a well in the flour and added 1 1/2 tsp bread machine yeast.  After the dough setting was completed. Dough was split into 12 balls and placed in a lightly oiled baking pan. I put the baking pan in the refrigerator for baking the next day for dinner. The rolls came out light and fluffy. They were delicious!

FIVE STARS! These turned out amazing. I did not have a bread maker so I dissolved the sugar in the warm water/milk mixture, then added the yeast to this, stirred and let dissolve for like 10 minutes. Mixed the egg salt and butter into this, then mixed in the flour one cup at  time. 

I made crescents as directed, and man... these turned out so light and airy almost flaky. I was NOT expecting these to be so good.  I suspect the softened butter may have contributed to this texture, as i softened it in microwave, being careful to not let it melt.

I will keep making this again and again. Next time I may cut down on the sugar to try making garlic bread by using a butter and garlic spread on the rolled out dough before cutting into slices. Five star recipe!

I didn't use a Bread machine, just my Kitchen Aid mixer and the rolls still turned out great!! I actually forgot to spread the butter on them before cutting and shaping them so I just brushed the butter on after baking. These had such a great taste and we're really easy. So worth making! This recipe is a keeper!!

Food porn! Absolutely wonderful! I don't have a bread machine so I followed K PRAPER's guide and it worked out perfectly. My only objection to this recipe is that I have a hard time parting with so much butter, I didn't smear the last 1/4 cup on the dough, I just rolled it out and made the crescents dry. They came out fine and seemed plenty rich enough to me but maybe they'd tear apart for buttering easier if I'd smeared them up. I'll definitely be making these again (and again, and again) but the bean-counter in me says to try it next time substituting shortening for the butter and see what happens.

I just made these rolls! they were very easy to make! I love the flavor! however I baked them according to the directions and they got too brown. I almost burnt them. I just bought a new oven and I think its a little hotter than my old one! i will turn the oven down to 375.

This is my standard roll recipe, the only thing I have ever had to do was tweak the amount of flour, and add an additional 1/4 cup of sugar to warm water (used to proof the yeast , makes for a sweeter roll--similar to Texas Road House). I also turn the pan of baking rolls half way through (to ensure even baking) and  baste rolls with melted butter the last  3 or so minutes of baking,  Cooking and baking is an extension of love and my family LOVES me when I make these rolls!

This has become my all time favorite roll recipe. It is absolutely outstanding and I have tried many recipes. I use this as regular dinner rolls and also the dough for my sausage bread loaf. The only thing I do differently is that I add more sugar (1/2 cup instead of 1/3) to make it taste more like a local restaurant's dinner rolls. Can't rave enough about these rolls. They are truly THE BEST!!! Oh, and they couldn't be more easy made in the bread machine!!

Followed recipe exactly. Use  bread machine to make the dough, followed other reviews to: 1. made  about 24 round rolls. 2. Use  9" round baking pan. 3. Let it raised about 1 hour before bake. 
 As my bread machine take 2 hour 20 mins to make the dough, plus the prep and raising, baking  time, it takes  4 hours to have the delicious dinner rolls  to be done.

I made these for our Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners.  I don't have a bread machine so used my mixer with a dough hook.  I also used rapid rise yeast and did not proof it first.  I put a ball of dough into each cup of 2 muffin pans. They were perfect!

Super yummy, but in my oven I had to watch them or the bottoms get too dark.  375 degrees for 10 minutes.

I made a trial run a couple days before Thanksgiving.  They turned out beautifully sweet and perfect for a nice dinner.  They were gone in less than a day!  I made them again on Thanksgiving with much success.  I took advice of another reviewer to use it for cinnamon rolls.  They turned out great, but rose so much that they were huge.  Next time I will need to roll them differently to make more smaller ones!  Best roll recipe!!

This is wonderful dough!  I make the dinner rolls with it and they are a hit.  I don't use a bread machine either, just make without a machine, as a few of the reviewers indicated how to make without a machine.  My family loves them, as do I.  First time making them, they were wondrous.  Second time I made them, I used an organic stone ground flour and they wouldn't rise.  Third time, King Arthur all-purpose flour, and they were wonderful.  I keep thinking of them so planning a fourth time to make them, and another and another!  I want to use this dough to make cinnamon rolls too, I think they'll be fabulous.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

These worked out very well! I was looking for a recipe I could use for both dinner rolls and cinnamon rolls. I saw this one first and tried it. I haven't had a bread machine for 20 years and my circa 1950's  KitchenAid mixer (it was my great-grandma's) was not up to that task. So I put all the ingredients into my Bosch mixer fitted with dough hooks and went with that. In hindsight, since I was using regular active dry yeast I really should have dissolved it in the liquids first—but I forgot.  So I held off on adding the salt and butter until the yeast was more dissolved throughout the dough to give it more of a fighting chance. The resulting ball of dough came out very nice. It was a humid day so I added only 2T additional flour to make the dough workable. Cutting the dough ball in half yielded 12 dinner rolls and 4 monster cinnamon rolls. Can't wait to try it again!

I'm giving this 4.5 stars although the recipe could deserve 5 stars?  I made a mistake which caused the rolls not to rise properly during the second rising.  Therefore, the texture, size, etc. was off.  I will make these again sometime and re-rate them.  I believe without my mistake, they could be 5 star!

A good roll is hard to find. These are the best rolls I've ever made. I t made a beautiful silky dough and when baked made a delicious pillowy roll with a great taste. Even two days later they were still good. I substituted "I Can't Believe it's Not Butter" for regular butter in the dough and will use it again. Also mixed the yeast with the warm water before adding to the pot.
I did the crescents, half four to a circle and the other eight. I think the eight is the way to go. Not much trouble to do the crescents and they do look nice.
These are going to be a regular here.

Best I have found so far.  One time it came out fluffy and the next it was more dense like a biscuit.  Both ways were yummy.  I also made cinnamon rolls out of half the dough and my family gobbled them up.  I will for sure keep using this recipe and see if I can master it.  I always struggle with breads, so it is nice to have a pretty easy recipe to use.  Thank you!

This is my go-to roll recipe. I put all the ingredients in my bread maker under the dough setting. When it rises, I cut it into rolls and throw them straight into the oven. The only change I ever make is occasionally using 1/2 wheat flour when I want to feel "healthier". Either way, they never last longer than 24 hours in my house.

Very easy.  I have a stand mixer with dough hook that I mixed dough about five minutes before covering to rise.  I do not have a bread machine.  This recipe was easy to make and everyone loved it.  Definitely will cook again!

These were delish!  Made as directed.  Be sure to roll them tightly as the recipe states.  A couple of mine were not as tight as they should have been and they started to unfold during baking.  Didn't hurt them but they didn't look as nice...my booboo.

Like other reviewers, I cannot believe I made such delicious dinner rolls. Just that, I live in higher than mile-high city (Cheyenne, WY). I did not get it done right because it needed more time for the dough to rise. I did not have bread machine, so I followed other reviewers' suggestions, but double (or even triple) the time for the dough to rise. It was so good that I will never get dinner rolls from the store. Thank you so much for the recipe and the suggestions from reviewers.

This recipe is really excellent!!  I doubled the recipe for a brunch and made monkey bread.  One reminder, learned the hard way, immediately invert the pans and remove the bread from them, or the sugars will turn into concrete and you will not be as happy.  Fortunately, EVERYBODY was happy with the bread, and I will be making this easy and delicious recipe many more times.

These are the BEST ROLLS EVER. I've been making them for several years, and my family members call ahead of family reunions and stuff to make sure I'm bringing the rolls. Recently, I've started subbing 3 cups of Bob's Red Mill stone ground whole wheat flour for the 3 3/4 cups of all purpose. They're still fluffy and delicious!

Love this recipe.  I've made them several times and the family really loves them.  I'm going to try to make cinnamon rolls  today.  The dough should be perfect for producing a soft sweet cinnamon roll.

These are the best rolls ever! They are so good warm with butter. I don't have a bread machine, so I just do it the old-fashioned way, and I just make them into balls. They are very easy and delicious, and my family loves them!

Fantastic and so easy!  I ended up with a little extra butter, so I melted it and brushed the rolls before baking. So good, it will now be made every holiday.

Best rolls ever. I don't have a breadmaker, so kneaded the dough for 4 minutes. I had errands to run so let the buns rise for 2-1/2 hrs. then popped them in the centre of the pre-heated oven for 10 minutes. Came out just like pictured. Out of 8 people for dinner, 6 asked for the recipe.

Excellent recipe! I have used it multiple times to make dinner rolls, crescent rolls, cinnamon rolls, and most recently I used this recipe to make pepperoni rolls. While I may not ever match the famous WV pepperoni rolls of my childhood, this recipe came close. This is now my go to recipe for special occasions. I follow the recipe as written and they have turned out perfect each and every time.

my first batch just came out of the oven and into my mouth, and ohwowohwowee these are delicious and soft!! I am so happy with this recipe :D I did reduce the flour to 3.5 cups and replaced one cup AP flour with bread flour. From now on, I'll probably be doubling the recipe, since so many get eaten as soon as they come out of the oven. no bread machine? no problem.

I don't have a bread machine, so I followed K Praper advice of  using the microwave oven, the only mistake I made was adding 1/2 cup sugar instead of 1/3 cup, but the rolls came out tasting wonderful.  I used the King Arthur bread flour which is very fine flour.

I don't care for results from bread makers so I used my kitchen aid with the hook. The only issue I had was with the rising but I am pretty confident that the fault there was mine and not the recipe. There is one dinner roll recipe that I would love to find but since my grandmother in law has passed and it was her recipe I don't figure I'll find it anywhere. That being said, this roll has a wonderful flavor and smells wonderful while it's baking. Definitely a must try for a very good dinner roll.

I did as some reviewers suggested and divided them into balls and placed them into round cake pans. I also skipped the extra 1/4 cup butter smear and instead melted the remaining stick of butter and brushed it on top before and after baking. I baked them at 400 degrees for 12 minutes. They are so good that they don't even need buttered. The melted butter on top was plenty!

I did not use  a bread machine and the recipe was delicious. I let the dough double once and then I shaped the rolls and allowed the dough to double again .  I baked them per the recipe.  My guests requested more!!   The rolls were light and delicious.

We make half crescent rolls and half cinnamon rolls (8 each) for a family of five.
Amazing recipe. 
Our bread machine kneads for 20 minutes, we let rise for 1 hour and these are perfect each time.

I was looking for a recipe similar to my Grandma's that could be done in a bread maker. This was it! The rolls taste exactly like Grandma's recipe but they are a little bit easier to make. This recipe is versatile and delicious! I think I have made it 6 times now. One batch I turned into orange rolls and they were perfect too! This recipe is a keeper!

Out Favorite!
these rolls are so dang good! I use my Kitchen Aid rather than a bread maker, since I don't own one, and roll them into all sorts of shapes. The dough is elastic and easy to form, the rolls turn out fluffy and delish! Plus they last well, where as some others get crumbly after a day or two. I highly recommend this recipe :-)

I love the taste of this recipe but about 11/2 the time the rolls seem to fall flat and are way too dense.  I was wondering if any bakers out there can help with what the issue might be?  Thanks!!  I am not using a bread machine but  following the directions given by others here.  The rolls rise beautifully but seem to fall during baking.

These are amazing rolls.  I've made them several times now and did both the cinnamon rolls and regular.  For the cinnamon rolls, I just took the butter you spread on top before rolling and added sugar/cinnamon, then rolled it up like a jelly roll and cut. Baked for the same amount of time.  This recipe does make two 9" round cake pans full, so you can do both types of rolls easily.

My buns rose very little, maybe 1.5x bigger rather than doubled. However, they tasted fine- soft, dense, and a hint of sweetness. I mixed these by hand, as I don't have a breadmaker.

Great recipe.   Has worked several times and with experience making it just keeps getting better.  Perfect for someone just starting to cook.  While I am a good cook I have always shied away from breads due to time.  This one is really quick and easy.

Best rolls and so easy to make!! I proofed the yeast in my kitchenaid mixer with the milk and sugar. Added the rest of the ingredients and kneaded in mixer for about 7 minutes. I followed the recipe and I never thought I would be able to make crescent rolls!! Just cut rolled out dough in half and then cut the halves into halves and get rolling!!  Baked at 350 for 15 minutes as my oven runs hot.Thank you for a wonderfully easy recipe

Cut down on the saturated fat by replacing the 1/3 cup butter with vegetable oil.  Also replaced the milk wth buttermilk.   Turned out great, and still enough buttery taste!

Best crust ever! I did place it in the oven for 12 min, then my children added the toppings, which was fun for them, I then placed it back in the oven, it was fun and it come out delicious! a family/group effort. I must say, I didn't think it was going to be this good because it was very sticky, but it turn out to be the best!

Made these into dinner rolls following the recipe exactly and they came out very soft and delicious! I've made them several times already . Very easy recipe with ingredients that I already have in kitchen . I used an egg wash on top to give them a golden glazed look like in the bakeries . Great recipe !!!

I used this recipe in replacement for "hot roll mix" in one of my mother-in-law's recipies. (She doesn't cook from scratch, I do).  Turned out perfect! Thank you to K Praper for the non bread machine version!

These rolls are soft and chewy on the inside but have a good crust. I do not own a bread machine, so I mixed by hand and kneaded by hand as well. The 1/8 cup flour I added while kneading did not adversely affect the result at all. I also used bread flour instead of all-purpose. Finally, I brushed the butter on the top of the rolls before baking rather than spreading it onto the circles. My family thought they were rather sweet, which I guess I should have known from the name. Next time I make them, it will be with half the amount of sugar.

These were Delicious right out of the oven.  They're  not that great cold, so you do need to heat them up a bit before eating.  (I made them early in the day).  My DH loved the rolls and can't wait to make more things in the bread machine!!

Delicious!!  I made these today using my bread machine's dough feature.  They didn't bake up very pretty, but man are the good!!!  I forgot to brush the butter on the dough after rolling it out, so I just dotted the rolls with butter before putting them in the oven.  Definitely a keeper!!

great rolls. made them to take to Thanksgiving today. They were a hit. A little sweeter than some bread- but not too much. Weren't too dense or too light- just right. Followed recipe- but old fashioned way- no bread machine. Did not make a large batch though-- 12 rolls that fit in a 9x11 inch pan.

I don't know what makes this recipe stand out but it does stand out! The best ever! I never thought all-purpose flour could make such a light bread, but i was wrong with this recipe. Didn't have any issues with any aspect of making it. I have never had to comment or rate any recipe, this is the first. Thanks Donna.

Wow fantastic. I made these for thanksgiving dinner, and it was pretty much unanimous, almost everyone said it was the best dinner rolls they have ever had.
They were incredibly light and fluffy.
I am going to try and make cinnamon buns with this recipe at Christmas

I made these a few days ago for Thanksgiving and in my opinion they were the best part of the entire dinner. I didn't have a breadmaker so I used another reveiwers instructions on how to make them the old fashioned way. I also decided to make buns instead of crescents but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. These buns tasted so good. I've never made bread this good before. I will be making these again for sure. Thanks for the great recipe.

Absolutely fantastic!!! Those were the best rolls I've ever made! They were soft and delicious. I brushed the tops with butter after they were rolled and sprinkled them with garlic powder and onion salt to serve with my spaghetti. Everyone had second and third helpings.

I make this recipe at least once a week, never change a thing.  It comes out great every single time, it is my go to recipe for rolls, cinnamon buns, monkey bread, sweet hamburger rolls, I have used it for just about everything.  Great recipe and simple.  Don't change anything.

I've used this recipe for several years as rolls, cinnamon rolls and crescent rolls.  I use my bread machine on the dough setting then make the rolls, I've gotten lazy in my old age and cut the rolled dough with a knife, the size and shape does not change the great taste, no one complains about the shape, they just ask for more.

This is nearly identical to my moms recipe that my famil would fight over when it came out of the oven.  I form into balls and bake in a round pie pan BC that's how Mom did it.  I don't know why there were poor reviews, they had to be doing something VERY wrong.  Mine turn out great every time!  A1 recipe deserving of 5+ stars!

Not a great sweet bread. I followed instructions to a tee, except there was not enough flour included. These rolls were heavy instead of fluffy. I think a second rising would help with this. The bread does not have a sweet taste at all.

I did not have to adjust any of the ingredients, temps or times.  This is one of the few recipes here that deserves all five stars as you can follow it without any tweaking.

The rolls were amazing.  My family loved them and this will now be my go-to recipe for homemade rolls.

I made these to go with dinner tonight and they turned out AWESOME! I rolled them into balls instead of the crescent shape because I was lazy.. but they were still great. I wouldn't change a thing except to maybe make less so I don't eat them all.

A newbie to bread-making with yeast, this is the 3rd recipe I've tried, and the first recipe I've LOVED!  I was so excited that I did a dance when I took the first bite.  I even called my mother to come over and "see what I did!".  They are soft, chewy, delicious.  Not too sweet at all.  I made them all by hand, as I really want to learn the feel of kneaded dough.  Followed the directions of some others, and kneaded for about 9 minutes.  They were fantastic as buns, and the other half as Cinnamon Buns.  Will make again for sure!

Delicious and picture-perfect. My only complaint is that these were supposed to be sweet dinner rolls, and I was expecting something like the hawaiian rolls. I actually couldn't taste the sugar at all and it tasted just like a normal (but beautiful and spectacularly home-made) dinner roll. I would definitely make it again, although next time I might try making three 8-inch rounds instead of two 12-inch rounds because I felt the rolls were rather huge.

I don't know what I did wrong, I followed the recipe like it is but the dough seemed to be wet. I am using the bread machine but I can't seem to roll the dough without sticking on my hands. Please help, I'm really looking forward to making this recipe. Thanks.

Amazing!! I made these following K PRAPER's directions (thanks!), because I don't have a bread machine and they still turned out so good. Light, decadent and fluffy on the inside, yet a soft brown crispy outer shell! My family devoured them!I can definitely understand why this is a 5 star recipe!

Really loved it. The dough seemed really dry when in the bread machine so I added almost 1/4C of water and then when I cut the dough to roll into balls the dough was still pretty dry so I had to make sure my towel was nice and wet the whole time they were rising by wetting with warm water occasionally. Maybe it was a really dry day here in CO but we just loved the rolls and I will def be using this recipe again just with a bit more water. Thanks :)

Wonderful! I altered the recipe to make 24 and made 24 large rolls.  To do this I had to use 3 1/3 tsp. of yeast. Awkward, but it worked fine. I used the traditional method since I don't have a bread machine.   I measured the dough on my kitchen scale and made them each 2-2.3 ounces each. I followed the suggestion to microwave the milk and water for 1 min. 15 sec. I didn't use the butter on top of the dough. I left them in too long,so I'll make sure to check them early next time--I think the tops stay pretty light when the bottom is done. The in-laws LOVED them!

Awesome rolls! These are so good that my teen asked me to show her how to make them so that she could make them herself whenever she wants.

I have never had success with yeast recipes.  I used K Praper's suggestions as I don't have a bread maker.  The seemed a little dry I didn't find it to rise tonnes, but after I took them out of the oven they were so YUMMY and light and fluffy I was pleasantly surprised.  They were delicious.

This was my first attempt at making rolls, and it was a huge success! Friends and family commented that these were the best rolls they've ever had. I made them completely by hand since I don't have a bread maker or a KitchenAide mixer. And formed the dough into 16 balls rather than rolling them out.  So, so, so, so yummy!

I followed this to the T and would like to give it a 5, but I think the temp. is too high. Next time I will bake them at 350 for no longer then 10 minutes.  From my experience, the dough will seem like it isn't done yet, but it really is and just needs to set.  
Otherwise, yummmmmmm.

The rolls came out pretty decent but kind of flavorless. Needs one cup or more of sugar instead of 1/3 cup. Maybe some honey too. Needs more sweetness. Probably a little less butter too, as the popcorn smell was kind of cloying.

What a lovely recipe! Be careful not to make them too large or they will not cook all the way through. Remember they rise during that hour when you put them in a pan! 
Excellent recipe.. will make again and again. THANK YOU!

These were my first real yeast rolls I've ever made, and they were delicious. Extremely soft and tender. They did turn out huge though. They were so big that I'm thinking I could have divided the dough in three parts instead of just two. I made 1/2 the batch into crescent rolls and baked them.  I made the other 1/2 into round rolls and froze them. **Update 1-17-13 - I took 3 blobs of dough from freezer, thawed, and created 6 cloverleaf rolls. Of course, I let them rise. They were plenty big and perfectly delicious!

My family and guests love these rolls.  I have been making them for a long time.  I put all of the ingredients in my bread machine and let it do all of the work.  I adjust the amount of flour only for the temperature. Wonderful!

I loved these rolls with the exception that I need to figure out how to avoid burning the bottom. The first time I made them following the recipe. I was using a dark pan and a gas oven so I thought maybe that was the problem. The second time I made them I added about 2 Tbsp. of honey (fantastic!) and baked them at a lower temperature (350), for less time (7-8 mins) on parchement in an electric oven. I thought for sure that would do the trick, but, they still burned. Next time (and I will make them again) I'll probably try 325 or 300 and watch them even more closely. They really are fantastic, even when I burn them!

I make a lot of bread rolls as my family loves eating soups and stews! This recipe is by far my favourite! The results are light slightly sweet rolls, with a crispy golden crust! I made mine in my kitchen-aid mixer using the dough hook , as I do not have a bread machine- and they turned out perfectly! My family loved them and devoured them as soon as they hit the table! Instead of using melted butter to glaze the rolls, I used milk with about 3 tablespoons of sugar! This turns a lovely golden in the oven and also tastes beautiful- especially with sesame seed on pumpkin/pepitas seeds on top! This recipe is my favourite and I will continue to make it whenever we have soup--- so regularly! Thank you! It has been exactly the types of rolls that I have been looking for!

I made this with bread flour, because that's what I had on hand, and I accidentally melted the butter, so I just brushed it on, using less in total than was recommended.  That said, these were wonderful!  They are everything I want and don't get from a canned crescent roll.  And they're very easy.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Soft and delicious! I made the dough in my bread machine, and then divided into 16 rolls. My husband loved these with homemade strawberry jam. Would also make great hamburger buns. Definitely a keeper and I will make again and again!

Not hard to make, but these came out a bit dry and floury for me. I am baking at 2,000+ ft above sea level, though, so that may have had something to do with my less-than-perfect results.

This recipe is amazing! Made them for Thanksgiving, FOLLOWED THE RECIPE and they were perfect! I layered the ingredients in the bread machine in the order they are listed (make a little well in the flour for the yeast to sit in) The only "change" I made was using a little less butter to brush on the sections before rolling them up. Used this roll recipe for pepperoni rolls, also amazing! THANKS for the great recipe!

I'm a bread-making beginner and received my first bread maker this week. My first 2 loaves were horrible so I took to the internet in search of better recipes than in the book that came with it. Thought I would try this recipe and it worked out wonderful. Great rolls. If I can make these,anyone can. Great dipped in honey butter.

These are seriously delicious.  And pretty hard to mess up!  I've made them probably 20 times now.  YUM.  I actually prefer to just roll them into balls and put them close together on a pan and then brush them with butter after they've baked. They are like pull-apart rolls.  SO good!

These are really light and tasty if you follow the recipe.  You can also substitute olive oil for the butter and whole wheat for all or part of the flour if you want them to be a little more nutritious.

This was my first attempt at making rolls from scratch. I followed the instructions exactly and used my bread machine. I put the rolls in 9 inch glass round pie pans, and baked them. I think I got the yield. I also did them the night before, and reheated the next day. They were really good and tasted awesome. I was just so proud that I made homemade rolls!!

Just took these out of the oven....they are absolutely to die for!!  My first batch was a little too browned (10 min.) on the bottom so took out the second batch a minute earlier(9 min.) and they were perfect.  Takes a little planning but I will definitely be making these for years to come now.  DH is already thinking he would love to roll up hot dogs in them and then bake them....mmmmm mmmmmm!

These were delicious dinner rolls, I can see them being perfect with a stew.  Mine had a very light fluffy texture, and very consistent air bubbles.  Perhaps the only thing I might do next time is take out a Tablespoon or two of the sugar, I know they're supposed to be sweet but its a little hard for me to ignore that much sweetness.

This is my favorite recipe for sweet rolls. Once I remove the dough from the machine,I form them into walnut-size balls,dip in melted butter,then let rise about 45 minutes. I bake them at 350 instead of 400 so the bottoms don't over-brown. I posted a close-up photo so you can see the light and fluffy texture.

Wonderful - made with my KA mixer as per instructions of other reviews. Let dough rise for an hour, punched down, rolled into about 18 balls and placed in lightly Pam-sprayed 9X13 glass dish. Let rise again for about an hour, baked 350 for 14 minutes. My son is asking why I don't make these all the time, and I need to put them away right now or there will be none for the turkey dinner tomorrow.

This was a good recipe.  I am high altitude so I used half the amount of yeast and next time I will bake at 375 degrees.  The bottoms got way too dark before they were a nice golden brown.  Other than that, this recipe is simple and versatile.

I used this recipe for pepperoni rolls.  Substituted olive oil for the butter. I cut the dough into 10 pieces after it completed the bread machine cycle.  Immediately formed it into pepperoni rolls and baked for 12 min. Yum!

These rolls are DELICIOUS. I wouldn't even call them "sweet," necessarily. (I realize they contain 1/3 c of sugar!) They remind me of what my husband and I call "pillows of heaven" -- rolls from Golden Corral (which is the single reason we'd go there).

I've made these twice and although they seemed slightly different each time, they were both VERY good.

I've used 3/4 c whole wheat flour just to see, and they were great. All all-purpose was great, too.

I didn't make them into croissants, I just balled them up and made them into rolls to use for sandwiches or whatever, and it saved me a lot of time and mess, and they were still great.

This is a keeper for sure.

This is my go-to roll recipe. I am always asked for the recipe when I make these rolls. I usually do clover style rolls by making three small balls and putting them in a muffin pan to bake. I just butter the top before baking. Very versital recipe! I have made, cinnamon rolls, a loaf of bread, pretzels, and many more! Thank you so much for this recipe!

These are fantastic!!!  I am a bread freak and these were so soft and the butter melted on them like silk. Not too fond of the crescent style and will change next time I make these but for a fresh, yeast bread roll. YUM!

Fluffy and nicely sweet rolls, very versatile dough.  Also SO much tastier (and cheaper) than store-bought bread and rolls!  I have used this recipe to make round dinner rolls (I shaped the dough into balls instead of rolling and cutting, and used the last amount of butter listed to brush on tops before baking) and as a base for cinnamon rolls.  They disappear VERY quickly! For those who prefer less sweet rolls, decrease the amount of sugar to 2 or 3 Tbsp. Then I like to make them into bread sticks and brush with garlic butter.  It also makes a good thick pizza crust dough if you only let it rise about 5-15 minutes.  One of my favorite recipes!

I love the sweet, buttery flavor this recipe delivers.  You need to adjust the sugar and butter to your taste.  I make the dough in the bread machine.  First, I heat the milk, water and butter until the butter melts.  Then I add the egg.  Then I add the dry ingredients with the yeast last.  That way the liquid is cooled by the flour before the yeast comes in contact.  I halved the recipe to yield 12 rolls which I bake in a cake pan.

I've tried many dinner roll recipes in the past, but always went back to the frozen dough because the recipe I tried wasn't worth the effort.  But not this time!!  I used my bread machine and followed the recipe exactly.  I think they could have baked a few minutes longer than the 12 minutes I used, or maybe if I just left them on the baking sheet to cool slightly that would have been enough.  I have my family over for Thanksgiving dinner and will be making these rolls this year.   My family (especially my younger son) are "roll freaks", so I'll have to do a double recipe!  They are going to LOVE these rolls!!

I thought these turned out great.  I am not a good bread maker, but my husband loves homemade bread.  I am still working on perfecting my skills.  I took half of the recipe and made them into cinnamon rolls as it is just me and my husband.  I gave some to neighbors as well.

I love this recipe.  So easy, so good, and responds well to experimentation.  This has become my basic bread recipe.  Adding a little more sugar for cinnamon rolls, adding herbs for italian bread, making the original recipe to go with stews or dinner or just to eat...it even makes perfect frybread!

Perfect recipe! So glad I found it! Recalculated the servings to 12 and made a pan of caramel rolls. Just sprinkled cinnamon and sugar over the butter, rolled, cut and let rise per the recipe. Perfect! No more frozen dinner or caramel rolls in our house!

These are so easy and absolutely amazing!  I made 16 dinner rolls and used quick rise yeast so there was no need to let the dough rise twice.  I took the dough out of the machine after it was done kneading, shaped into rolls and let rise for about 45 min. - 1 hr.  and they were ready for the oven.  Will make again and again!

I've never worked with yeast before and don't own a bread maker but read the reviews and gave it a try for Christmas dinner. My first batch looked promising. I used a mixer and the dough was soft and didn't need extra flour. However, it didn't rise. I baked it anyways and it was like a rock. My second attempt, I followed Kevin's suggestion by mixing the warm water, milk, & yeast together then add the other ingredients. But my dough was pretty sticky but it did rise. I scooped them out with some spoons and put the dough in a 13x9 pan and let them rise again. After baking, I froze them for a couple of days. Thawed and heated them up for Christmas dinner. Everyone liked them. I thought sweet and fluffy, but a little dry, possibly because I froze them? Hoping the 3rd time I'll hit bingo.

I made these using my KA mixer and although their not super easy to make, they are definetly fun to make and even better to eat :) This is my 4th time making bread and after my second try they came out perfect :) (I forgot to add the egg and added too much flour the first time and they came out like rocks... tasty rocks tho lol!) I ended up adding less flour than the recommended amount, maybe like 2.5-3 cups but it really just depends on the weather and what not when it comes to making bread, or so I've heard. The timing was also a little bit longer, maybe like 15-18 mins in my oven. I'm making them again as soon as I finish my finals at school!

Easy dough to work with even though I don't have a bread machine.  I think I would have liked them to be be a bit sweeter.

Wow! I love making bread but rolls always seem to be a little harder to do. Maybe because I want them to have a fluffier texture than bread, which I like a little on the dense side. These were super easy! I made them for the first time on Turkey day for a dinner I didnt know we were going to until that morning and they were raved about:) I made them without a breadmachine and did find they did a little better if I let the yeast proof in the milk and water. Also it took a little bit more flour than the recipe called for to get that nice smooth texture. I have made 6 batches in 2 weeks:D It is now my go to roll recipe:)

Made this 2 times now. No bread machine first time and with machine 2nd. Didnt really care for them either way. Not quite sweet enough and a little too dense the first time and a little too dry the second time.

These really got huge during the rising process!They tasted a little too yeasty for me but looked pretty on the table. I might try a little less yeast next time or try to rise them in a cooler place for a little less time.

Made these as dinner rolls for Thanksgiving Dinner and they were awesome!  These were so easy to make that I'll probably won't buy buns/rolls anymore.  I'll use this recipe to make buns for sliders (burgers) or any other kind of sandwich.  Thank you for this recipe!

The BEST dinner rolls I have ever tried! I put these in my KitchenAid Stand Alone mixer as K PRAPER described. Unfortunately these were for TurkeyDay and I ran out of time for rising. So they didn't have time to rise again for an hour after being divided into rolls (no time for cresent rolling). They ended up taking about 30 mins to bake but they still came out DELICOUS! Now that we have run out, I plan to make them again today and give them time to rise properly. They were so good, my MIL asked for the recipe! I will never buy brown and serves again! :)  Thank you so much!!!!

I made a double recipe for Thanksgiving.  They were ALL gone.  Delicious.   I used my Kitchen-Aid mixer with the bread hook to knead and let it rise in a warm place.  Watch them carefully in the oven.  They cook quickly and are better if baked just enough!  YUMMY!

I made these for Thanksgiving yesterday and they were a hit! I didn't have a bread maker so I followed a suggestion of a reviewer who didn't have a bread maker as well and they came out perfect. The only thing I would do different next time is roll them in bigger balls because they didn't really expand they way I thought they would. Otherwise, this was a really good recipe.

I made these rolls in my kitchenaid mixer - using the paddle.  I don't have a bread maker so I made this directly in the mixing bowl.  I warmed up the water & milk in the microwave and added all dry & wet ingredients together - mixed for 2 min after mixed added the egg (scrambled) to the dough mixture.  Mixed for another minute. After that I put the bowl near the heat of the oven to let the dough raise.  I will be making these again this christmas - turned out really soft & light - good with a smear of butter when warm out of the oven!

I didn't have a bread machine, so i followed the first reviewer's method...  I also didn't roll them out into crescents, but instead opted for the simple round ball.  These things came out phenomenal! They were just as good heated up in the oven the next day....

I don't have a bread machine so I followed the other reviews for doing it the old fashioned way.  Even though I ran out of time to let them rise completely, they still tasted delicious.  They were just more dense.  My fiance said they tasted like soft pretzels.  But he wasn't complaining.  I'm definitely going to try again and let them rise longer.  Sooooo yummy.

These are delicious. I have made them a couple times now The first time I followed the recipe exactly and they were wonderful. This last time, with half the dough I made 6 large rolls (for sandwiches) and the other half I made 8 small cinnamon rolls and then drizzled them with icing. LOVE this recipe.

These are really tasty.  I messed them up somehow; either because I didn't know beforehand that I needed to allow 20 minutes for the yeast to proof (learn something new everyday, haha!) or because I'm at more than 7000 feet above sea level where I'm at, they were not light but rather dense.  They are still amazingly good.  I dipped them in some homemade chicken soup that was seasoned with cayenne, and I must say the contrast of the spicy and sweet was delicious!  Next time I will try allowing 20 minutes for the yeast before adding the other ingredients to see if they end up lighter.

Oh, these are wonderful! I won't be paying the Dough Boy any more money. ;) I've made these two times now, and both times (due to unforeseen circumstances) the dough ended up sitting in my bread maker on the "keep warm" setting for over an hour. Oops! But they still turned out great -- I just formed them into crescents and only let them rise for ten or fifteen minutes before baking. My family loved them.  Can't wait to try them the proper way someday!

Excellent and easy. I replaced one cup of white flour with whole wheat and added additional water.  I made dinner rolls with 1/2 and cinnamon rolls with the other. A great versatile dough.

I don't have a bread maker, so I followed the advise of other bakers. I mixed the water and milk, nuked in in the microwave for 1 minute and added 2 teaspoons yeast and a bit of sugar. I let it activate about 20 minutes and poured it into the bowl of my KitchenAid, then stirred in the rest of the  sugar until it dissolved,  then mixed in the salt, butter and egg, then I started mixing the flour a half cup at a time. I let it rise for about 45 minutes in the bowl, then punched it down, divided it into rolls and let it rise for another hour, then baked for 10 minutes at 350 degrees. Yum!

I have made these several times useing my bread mbachine on the dough cycle. Add ingredients according to manufacterer I didn't change any of the amounts. On a warm day I covered the rolls and put them under the hood of the gas grill. They rose in about 1/2 hour best ever rolls family thought I slaved over them ha ha.

Very nice roll. I'm eating one right now! It is the 4th of July week end and I'm making 4 batches of these (72) for a party on Sunday. I love the texture and the flavor is wonderful. I made 2 batches of regular dough and made one each of red and blue! I know how awful does that sound!! LOL Hey, it's VERY patriotic!! I'm sure they'll all go down to the tummy just fine! If your curious, I used McCormick's food coloring. I added 40 drops of color to each batch. The recipe made right at 925-930 grams of dough and I made each roll 50g. I got 18 nice rolls out of each. Try them, you'll be glad you did!

Amazing. We live at higher altitude (about 4700 feet), so I bake them for seven minutes less than recommended and they turn out perfectly!

1st time - Made clover leaf rolls and they were very tasty as soon as they came out of the oven.  Didn't rise as much. More like a biscuit - dense.  2nd time - made it again and it didn't rise so I got rid of dough and did it again.  Still didn't rise during first rising but 2nd rising it rose a bit. Tasted good but didn't look that great.  Not light or fluffy.  Will search for a fluffier sweet dinner roll.

Awesome recipe!!  I've made them twice & they've turned out perfectly each time & they were a hit with my guests.  Just delicious, even the next day!  I made the 16 serving size recipe, but will divide to make 32 dinner rolls, because the rolls are enourmous.

These were delicious and easier to make than I thought they would be.  I followed the recipe exactly, but did not use a bread machine.  They were beautiful and delicious!  Next time, I'll make smaller rolls - they were huge!

Great recipe,  my daughter tells me that my son-in-law said that those were the best buns he has ever tasted!  I loved them too!  I did not alter the recipe at all.  I was shocked that I actually made great buns!!  Usually not my forte.

I did this different, and I hate when people rate things that they change, but I'm going to do it anyway...I threw all of this into a breadmachine and pressed 'start' and it came out AWESOME.  Next time I'm actually going to make the rolls.  It was soooo easy to slice this bread!  It was a little sweet, but everyone loved it.

This dough divided in 12 balls makes a smallish hamburger bun - probly a regular size bun if they didn't collide during the rise.  I brushed with butter during the last 5 mins of baking.  Next time will dry dividing into 18.

Great tasting bread! Just didn't turn out quite perfect because of my inexperience at bread making. If you make rolls, I really don't think they need to rise for a 2nd time after you put them in the pan.

Looked at the reviews before baking. I made these without bread machine and although they taste fine, they do have the consistency of a biscuit. Not light and fluffy.

AMAZING rolls!!! I followed the recipe exactly and as did some of the other reviewers, I cut my dough into 36 pieces and placed three balls of dough into each section of a muffin pan. They turned into beautiful clover rolls. They were everything I could have hoped for, soft and delicious! They will definitely be making future appearances on our weekly dinner menu and more!

These are fabulous. I did the dough in my bread machine but then had to add more flour to make more workable. I cut into 36 pieces and dropped three into each muffin tin. Buttered the tops and baked for 13 minutes.  Came out with 12 beautful clover leaf muffins.

Came out terrific.  I used bread flour (didn't notice the all-purpose untill it was too late. No problems.)  I made mine into 12 clover rolls using muffen tins.  I will be using this recipe again!

Just made these to go with Kyle's Favorite Beef Stew for dinner tonight and I'm a little disappointed. Mine have almost a biscuit-like texture. Much lighter than a biscuit but that same idea. I made them in a clover shape in my muffin pan and they look amazing. Don't get me wrong, they don't taste bad but it isn't at all what I would think of as a dinner roll. Might have to move on to another recipe...

this is the best dinner roll i have ever made. they remind me of the rolls that my grandma dee  made when i was a child. i have been looking for a recipe like hers and i think i found it. they are the best. this is the only dinner roll i will make from now on. the key is to have the time to let them rise. i used quick rising yeast, cuts the rise time to 45mins  very very GOOD. thank you. also this is the best site for all of your baking and cooking needs i love this site.

These rolls were delicious!  I have been looking for a sweet dinner roll like they used to serve at my favorite restaurant for years, and I have finally found something close to it.  I may add a little honey or molasses next time, but these are great just as written!  

Serve with honey butter...fantastic!

These are excellent.  Made these for Christmas dinner and people couldn't believe they were made from scratch.  They are time consuming but worth it (if you have the several hours for the bread machine and the rising).

I used 1 cup of wheat flour, along with the white, and did not use a bread machine.  This was very easy, and I will definitely make again.  The rolls weren't quite as soft as I would have liked, but I think maybe that was because of the wheat flour.  They tasted great on this cold, winter night.  Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my! First time making rolls and husband loved them.  So good that he wants to take some to work for his co-workers.  I do not own a "bread machine" so I followed the Review on Feb. 7, 2004 by K about using a "mixer"...and only change I made was to use "honeybutter" in place of  "butter".  I found how to make "honeybutter" on this site.  And used "rock salt".  Also, after the two tries...I see the rising part is very important so I did 1 hour for 1ST rise (I set the oven on lowest temp..170 and soon as a saw the flames, I cut the oven off and put the rolls in the oven..can not open oven door until ready to come out for 2ND rise)  and 1 hour for 2ND rise (this time on top of 200 degrees oven)....All this came out so delicious...thanks Donna...

Very, VERY good!  I made them for Thanksgiving and Christmas and my whole family loved them.  I have made them exactly as stated in the recipe, and I have also made them without rolling and cutting them - I just split the dough into 16 pieces (a very sticky process!) and formed them into balls.  Excellent either way!

My family really liked these rolls. I didn't have a bread machine either, but I followed the tips given here and made sure that I kneaded for 10 min. They were so light and delicious I am going to make them again!

One can not expect more from the dinner roll, sweet and good with gravey.  I used honey instead of sugar and they came out great, thanks for solid and easy recipe.

I tried to make these following the recipes given by another reviewer on how to do it without a bread machine.  I missed a step and had to go back and add the egg in ater everything else was done.  I think this messed mine up a little but the flavor is excellent and as soon as I get a bread machine I will be making these again!

Excellent dinner rolls!  It is so versatile... I made half into dinner rolls and the other half into cinnamon rolls.  I used this recipe again and made soft pretzels for my daughter.  Wonderful!  Thank you so much!

My sister told me about these rolls. I made them on Thanksgiving and they were fought over!  I made them into cloverleaf shapes and put a sliver of butter into the middle of the three balls before cooking, WONDERFUL!!!  I made them 2 days later, cut them into 'rough' shapes and when finished cooking, sliced them, added cooked egg, ham & cheese for breakfast sandwiches. OMG!!! Today I'm making them into cinnamon rolls.  Thank you for this GREAT recipe!!

These rolls were fantastic! This was my first time ever making bread - to the point where I googled what it meant to knead and punch the dough! I was a little confused about timing so I accidently let the dough rise for 45 min. before I kneaded it, and just altogether I think I let them rise too long.  But they still came out terrific! 13 min. in a 350 oven was perfect!

I absolutely love this recipe! It made Thanksgiving so much easier to prepare. I used my bread machine for the doughmaking process and did not even have to let them rise. They turned out light, sweet and beautiful! My family really enjoyed them. Thank you!

Everyone loved these!  I rolled them up like the recipe says, they made good little crescent-like rolls that are probably much healthier than the flaky ones! I should have put the point slightly under the roll for baking, but will next time.  The points sort of unrolled and got a little crispy.  Great flavor, great texture, even though I froze and thawed them before baking.  Baked only 10 minutes and were perfectly golden and soft.  I did not use a bread machine.  Very tasty, will be making a few loaves today :)

This was my first time to make dinner rolls from scratch. I love that this recipe allows for the machine to do the kneading but you can still feel like you "made it." I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and everybody loved them.

I used K Praper's instructions on how to make w/no bread machine. I rarely make bread so I was hesitant when I saw the dough, kneaded the dough and then rolled into ropes to make knots. My bet was I'd have some attractive-looking rocks of cooked dough because the dough seemed tough and heavy and didn't knead into a really smooth dough--I overdid the flour and could have used 1/2 a cup or so less. And I thought the risings, particularlly the first, didn't rise much at all. I also did a terrible job of making even-sized rolls--some ended up twice the size of others. I was so worried I made another recipe (one of the quick recipes) as a back up. Totally unnecessary--these were wonderful. Best when out of the oven of course but fine heated up. Husband just ate one cold out of the leftovers and mentioned how good they were. Used a silpat and kept oven heat lower to 375 (oven bakes hot), done in 20.

This was my first time making bread of any kind and these turned out pretty well.  Make sure you put the dough somewhere warm to rise.  I started putting them on the counter and they didn't rise much.  Then I put them on the top of the stove when I had the oven going and they began to rise much more quickly.

These were the best! My family devoured them. I wish I would have made a double batch, all 16 were gone before they were cooled. I didn't roll the butter up in them instead I brushed on top before baking. update: using i can't believe it's not butter and no second part of the butter 1 roll =138 calories

Really easy and super yummy! I added a little bit of Kosher salt to the top for a little more style but my whole family really enjoyed this recipe. I would suggest making a double batch (just double everything) because it takes just as long to clean up and these go fast. I did not have time to wait for the butter to get to room temperature so I just used boiling water instead. It works great! Happy eatting.

Excellent taste and super easy.  I forgot to spread the extra softened butter on the rolls before I made the cresecents.  I'm sure they will be even better when I make them for Thanksgiving next week!

Very tasty and sweet.. My husband is used to my cooking being good (not trying to brag) but even he was surprised by how good and nice looking these were.

Didn't work out very well for me but it could be due to my own mistakes rather than the recipe.  I don't usually have trouble with bread.  It tasted good but wasn't fluffy enough for me.

These are the finest rolls I've ever eaten or made! Very simple to make & the dough is easy to handle. I made the first batch yesterday & eveyone loves them so much, I'm making another today. Thank you Donna for the BEST dough recipe.

Made them the evening before thanksgiving to "test them out" before the big day... It made 16 and by the time I woke up in the morning, there was one left (and only 3 ppl live in this house!) I made another batch on thanksgiving day... and have made these twice more since(in one week). DELICIOUS! (made w/ Kitchenaid mixer as per directions by another reviewer)

Fantastic! Received comments that they were like store-bought. Rolled half of the dough into a loaf pan and it turned great as well. Will be making them again. =>

AWESOME. Was looking for an easy dinner roll recipe that didn't take a million hours to make. VERY easy and I followed the non-bread machine suggestions by reviewers. Worked out fantastic! Unfortunately, these will not last very long as I've already eaten two...

Ooops.  I let these rise too long.  I didn't read the recipe and didn't add the 1/4 cup butter.   I ended up smearing it on top with an egg which caused the buns to deflate a bit.  I made the dough into 16 buns I baked in a large glass lasagna dish.  Anyway, they turned out great.

I can see why these rolls are so popular.  The dough is so soft and silky.  This carries over to the final product; very light and airy.  I loved working with this recipe and will also use it to make sweet rolls.  Thank you for sharing this recipe; it's a keeper!

Foolproof!  I substituted 1 cup wheat flour and forgot to read the rest of the directions, but they turned out great regardless!   I ate them plain, with no butter or anything because they were just so good.  I'm making them again today.   There's just two of us at my house, so I froze half the batch and they were in great shape when I pulled them out.

These are just like the ones my grandmother used to make. They are delicious!!!! They're good plain, with butter, and the best hamburger buns I have aver tasted!! I had never made rolls and it took me about 4 tries before my rolls came out right. I make them with honey instead of sugar. They taste much better that way, and so good for you!!

These were very light and tasty!  I have just began making homemade bread this week.  So far I have only tried whole wheat bread and have not been thrilled with the results. I decided to try this roll to see if I could make a great white flour roll, well I CAN! I only had bread flour so I did use that in place of the all purpose flout. My husband was shocked when I said I made them.  Now I just need to make some great whole wheat bread.

I am terrible at making rolls or bread for that matter. This is my second recipe attempt at making dinner rolls and so far (though I've only tried one other) these were the best! I thought I'd fail miserably, but I only failed half miserably. The only problem I have is proofing my yeast; I have a feeling my yeast is a bit old. When I took it fresh out of the oven, it tasted wonderful and had a nice texture-- wasn't completely breadlike due to my yeast, but when it cooled completely, and I offered my family to try one they said "nice biscuits." Sigh. They tasted wonderful though! Even my horrible baking skills couldn't hinder its taste, and that's saying something!

I think I did something wrong with these, they barely rose during the second rise, they burned on the bottom and browned nicely on the top and they tasted salty... But I will try them again to see if I can get your results!

I made these for the first time today.  I thought the recipe (and dough it makes) so SO easy for a first time roll maker.  I used the bread machine and followed all the directions exactly.  The only slight modification I made was just to put honey butter in place of regular butter.  That was just because I was wanting some extra sweetness.  The rolls would have been fine without it.  Personally the thing I loved about this recipe was that when the dough came out of the machine (after following the recipe exactly) it was extremely easy to work with.  Thanks for this recipe...it is a new staple in my house.  We live in china and getting rolls is impossible so this recipe helped.  I also would like to note I made them in a toaster oven because that is all I have and it still turned out great.  I think this is a good fool proof mixture of ingredients!

**A second review** this dough freezes extremely well also and is easily put directly into the oven for quick fresh rolls.  I take the dough out of the breadmaker, immediately form the rolls and freeze.  I keep a large bag of the frozen dough balls in my freezer and just pull out what I need for dinner.  I add a few more minutes cooking time for the frozen aspect of the dough.....absolutely perfect AND easy.  my favorite rolls recipe ever.  I use it several times a week.

These were just okay.  They needed to either be sweeter or salter.  I may try again but will increase the sugar.

I had to make these the "old fashioned way" [no bread maker] and they were really lovely. I think I made them way to big, I managed to get 19 and they were really big! I will make them a bit smaller next time. Going to try sticky buns with the dough next week. Thanks so much for the recipe Donna.

I like these a lot.  I was looking for a sweet, easy, versatile dinner roll to make.  I did bake them in muffin cups as other suggested, seemed easiest.  It made 24+ for me this way.  I did make a couple small changes.  I used spelt flour instead of all-purpose and raw honey instead of sugar.  Otherwise I didn't change anything.  DD (17 mo.) loved them so much that I'm making several more.  I've been craving cinnamon lately so I may make some as cinnamon rolls this time.

How lucky was I to choose to make this recipe as my introduction to the site.  It was a delicious success so much so that I've made it twice in one week.  It wonderful to use yeast and to bake something as popular as these rolls are. Thank you. Carol

Excellent as dinner rolls, but better as cinnamon rolls!  Everybody loves 'em & they're slightly healthier than Mom's butter crescent rolls (less butter; even better that they're less work:)!!  I just "tuck" them under like shaping a loaf of bread & dip the tops in butter; don't need 1/4c.

These are soft and tender without too much fat in them.  I made these into 8 rolls so I could use them for sandwiches. They're not all that sweet, but they're pretty flavorful.

I've made these many many times, and I didn't realize that I've never rated it.  This is a fantastic recipe.  Love the ease of using the machine to make the dough.  I've done pull-aparts with these as well as the crescent shape, and they always turn out soft and delicious, with a touch of sweet.  One caution... if making the crescents, make sure you really tuck the center point under the roll or they will open and unroll while baking...  The kids and I share those right out of the oven, so sometimes I am less careful than I could be...  ;-)  Thanks for a wonderful recipe that my family requests often!

Thought these were really good but did have to change a few things: 1 cup warm milk (substituted for water),added 2 tbls. honey in addition to sugar. 400 was way too hot on my oven so they got pretty brown. Next time down to 350 for 10 minutes. Greased the pan and they still stuck a bit. Made 16 HUGE rolls so next time will make 2 pans of 8 each. Did not do crescent rolls just parker house type round rolls. My husband says they taste just like the famous "big fat yeast roll."

These rolls were great and easy to make (even without a machine).  They don't look like the picture if you follow the directions, but they are nice crescents.

This is a GREAT recipe for dinner rolls. I made the dough in my breadmaker, and after one rise cycle took the dough out of the breadmaker, and punched it down--made rolls/balls. I'm not sure how some of the reviewers got fewer rolls than the recipe calls for, unless you made very large rolls. Also, about the flour--someone mentioned this, but I'll mention it again 1. The amount of flour in roll recipes is somewhat variable, which should be adjusted to your taste, and climate, and "feel" of the dough. I added a little bit once I saw that the dough was in need of it, after the machine kneaded it for 10 minutes or so  2. I always use breadflour for my breads/rolls with yeast. It's just a preference I think.  Using an egg wash increases the aesthetic of the rolls IMO, but it's up to your own preference.   overall, these are the BEST rolls I've ever made--and the closest I believe I'll ever come to my husband's grandmother's yeast rolls (she took that recipe to her grave, but wow!)..and this is pretty close. The only modification I did was to melt 2T of Honey into the butter, and I used 2.5tsp of bread machine yeast.

Donna, thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe. This is the first time I tried to make dinner rolls and was not sure if it was gonna work since I don't have a bread machine. But I know how to make breads so i did what I was used to. I also left them in my oven at 350 degrees for 10 min. I enjoyed the whole experience and wanted to say thanks. I will leave a picture also.

Suggestion for Mrs. Hooper on 4/16 entry: try adding pineapple juice - it's what makes it "Hawaiian." Can't help with the amount, though. Good luck.

These rolls were great! I baked them in an 8" round pan so they would be super soft and tender. They *almost* remind me of Hawaiian sweet bread, but there's a little something missing. If anyone knows what it is, please let me know.

I had to use my kitchen-aid mixer to make the bread which was easy. The rolls had a great taste but they were heavy that is why I gave the recipe three stars. I made clover leaf rolls and they weren't light and airy as others have said. I will try again because it was my first time making rolls.

I did use my bread machine.  I always have so many problems with bread rising... BUT had no problems.  They were awesome.  We did have them for Easter dinner.. was expecting rolls and crescents.  Too bad I didn't read the reviews then I would had known.  I will use this again and again

Rolls were MOST EXCELLENT!  Texture A+, taste A+.  I make all my own bread and rolls and don't use a bread machine, food processor or Kitchen Aid mixer, I enjoy kneading dough.  As someone who makes a lot of yeast doughs as a tip to others who don't.  The flour in a recipe is just an estimate.  Humidity and other variables dictate how much you will need.  Also, remember that salt and sugar should be carefully measured.  Salt is absolutely necessary but one of it's functions is to inhibit rising.  Always allow plenty of time when making bread or rolls and remeber a dough that rises slowly that it gives a wonderful taste to the finished product.

i didn't have a bread maker so I made it the old fashioned way. The dough was very sticky at first but I added a little more flour when kneading and the rolls came out great. I'm going to use this  recipe when I make cinnamon buns next time because the dough is so sweet and delicious

I made these and they did not come out like the recipe said. Dough was runny I had to add more flour and yeast. They did not rise very much. I finally got the dough to form a ball so I could roll them out.I went ahead and baked them . They tasted ok a little heavy. So can anyone tell me what I did wrong?  I followed the recipe .

OK rolls. I was hoping for better. Followed the instructions up until the last part with the extra butter, so maybe it was me.  I let the dough rise (used all-purpose Gold Medal flour) and then rolled into balls and placed on a baking sheet 2 inches apart.  Let rise again for 2 hours and baked.  Just OK.  Not sweet at all.  No comments on them with Easter dinner.  Will keep looking for a great biscuit or roll recipe.

Excellent!!!  Light, fluffy and very easy to make.  I made one change, I used Bread Flour instead of All Purpose, that's it!

I LOVE this recipe. However I started making these roles about an hour before dinner so I didn't let them rise as long as they should. I initially let them rise for about 30 mins, punched a hole in the middle, divided into 8 big rolls, let those rise for about 20 mins...and baked at 350 for about 10 mins. PARFAIT. Its comforting to know I dont need to let them rise for as long and they will still turn out great.

Wow - very delish!  I, too, don't have a bread machine, but made them by hand.  Easy to make, particulary since the recipe is quite small.  Got rave reviews, so next time will have to double the recipe!

I made this recipe exactly as written, using my bread machine. My husband & I both   thought they were great but thought they tasted more like biscuits (my reason for rating it lower).

First off I have to say that I have never had much success in the bread making department, I can bake anything else except bread. I definately lacked in my kneading skills. I just got a new bread machine as a gift and decided to try this recipe to give it a whirl, the result was amazing!! The most beautiful, moist and delicious rolls we have ever had. I made mine in the old cloverleaf shape and I will definately be making these again, in fact my son says no more store bought rolls for us! I tend to agree. Thanks for the recipe, perfect as written!!

I added 3 tbsps wheat gluten. I don't have a bread machine so I put all the dry ingredients in first then heated up the milk, butter, and water and adding them in with also the egg gradually in my mixer. Delicious Rolls!

Awesome recipe for wonderful rolls.  I make the dough in the breadmaker and then let them raise anywhere from 10 minutes to 4 hours and they always turn out wonderful.  Great with 1/2 whole wheat in place of 1/2 of the flour as well.

These are sooooo good!!  I only used 2 Tbsp of sugar, and I think next time I will up the salt to 1.5 tsp.  I baked them at 350 for 20 min, and next time I will try 18-19 min.

Perfect yeast rolls. Lovely soft dough and really great taste. I will be trying other things with this recipe as well. Cinnamon rolls sound awesome. I wonder how it would do as breadsticks.

These rolls are excellent!! I have just recently started working with yeast and this recipe is very forgiving.  I don't own a bread machine so I used my kitchen aid mixer.  As long as you ge the water/mil the right temperature for the yeast to proof, you are all set.  This is my new favorite roll recipe!  Highly recommend.

OMG what a great roll! My husband and I love these. I promise that you can not eat only one! I mixed the dough in my breadmaker, rolled it out like pinwheels or cinnamon rolls with butter spread on the dough, let rise and then baked. Wonderful!!!!

The first time I made these I used half reg flour and half bread flour and they turned out a little heavy and dense.  The second time I used all bread flour and they were amazing!  They rose beautifuly and were light and fluffy.  Just like rolls from a resturant.  Amazing.  My husband begs me to make these all the time now.

I made these in the breadmaker and the first time they were amazing. They did not rise much, and I wondered if my yeast was good. The flavor was great, though. I ran out to get some new yeast to see if they would be lighter and fluffier and tried again. The yeast was active BUT the flavor was no where near as good!! I'm confused! Also... 400 seems way to hot to bake these. I'm gonna try a lower temp and make another batch with my bad yeast!

Can you say delicious!!! I love making these homemade rolls to go with dinner! They are soo good! Definatley 5 stars, but I only give it 4 because everytime I make this I do it exactly like the recipe says except I don't have a breadmaker so I took another reviewers advice & mix it all up in my kitchenaid mixer. I follow all the steps & I cannot for the life of me get the dough to rise. But no worries...I've baked it anyways & its still really really good! I've made this a bunch of times already! So good that I've stopped using pillsbury instant rolls & this is a keeper recipe for me!!!

Amazing! Followed the measurements exactly, but used the first review on the main page, to use the Kitchenaid mixer instructions. I'm going to make them again today, only washing the tops with 1 egg white mixed with 1Tbsp. water so I can get that 'golden top' that I didn't achieve with melted butter. Perfect mix of sweet and yeasty.

My family loves this yummy bread recipe!  I make it every week on the dough setting in my bread machine as our sandwich loaf (I don't even bother to get out the recipe any more; I've got it memorized!).  Some weeks I make it with 2 1/2 c. all-purpose flour and 1 1/4 c. whole wheat flour, and other weeks I make it as written with just all-purpose flour.  I always bake it in the oven at 400 degrees after letting it rise 1 hour in the greased loaf pans (it makes 1 large loaf and 1 mini loaf, which we use for toast).  Brush the tops of the loaves with melted butter before and after baking:  YUM!

These were DELICIOUS!  I, too, used my KitchenAid mixer.  I mixed the milk and water together, and microwaved it for 1 minute.  I added the yeast to this mixture, and let it dissolve.  Next, I added the sugar.  Then, I added the remainder of the ingredients, except for the flour, and mixed them together.  Finally, I added the flour 1/2 a cup at a time and continued to stir.  When a ball was formed, I turned the mixer to the kneading cycle, and I kneaded for about 3-5 minutes.  I placed the dough into a greased bowl, turning once to cover the entire dough.  I let this raise for an hour.  I then punched down the dough, cut into two sections, and proceeded as initial directions stated.    These rolls came out absolutely delicious.  My husband said he could have these every night of the week.

Totally Awesome!!! I would give these 10 stars**********if I could. You have got to try these. It is so worth it. I used to think that yeast products were too time consuming....however, I have tried several and they are so worth it. These rolls are perfect they are pillowy, soft and highly impressive they turn out so pretty. You are sure to impress everyone who tries them!!

I made these rolls and cut the butter back a couple of tablespoons. Turned out really great, also really good to make sandwiches on later in the week.

I used 1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour and 2 cups all purpose flour.  This was a great textured bread.  Not too heavy.  My husband commented on how amazing it was, he usually just says it was good or okay.  This was a really easy recipe too.

these had great texture and rose up very nicely, but the taste wasn't all that special, pretty bland actually.  it either needs to be sweeter or saltier.  next time i will add a little bit more of either sugar or salt.

great recipe, I use only a 1/4 c sugar, and a teaspoon or so of honey for extra flavor, also, I do not use all the flour (about 1/3 to 1/2 cup less)

I used this recipe just to make a whole loaf of bread instead of rolls. It was the best bread that I've made to date, and I've tried them all! It's a great recipe. I'll try the rolls, but the bread is easier!

Very good, but they ended up burning on the bottom. I think the temp was too high and the baking time was too long.

Just the recipe I was looking for! I do not have a bread machine so I followed other peoples methods for mixing in my upright mixer. This recipe will be used a lot, am already planning to make cinnamon rolls out of it this weekend. Thanks so much for submitting this!

Tasted like dinner rolls, not as sweet as I thought it would be.  Nothing extra special about it.  Used bread flour and mixed in the kitchenaid.

These were wonderful fresh out of the oven! I made them with honey cinnamon butter and they were identical to Texas road house! Delicious! 
Update: I didn't use a bread machine, but I used my kitchen ad dough hook to knead for about 10 minutes. They turned out so good! You need to knead the dough sufficiently to form enought gluten to support the air bubbles made by the yeast so you have soft fluffy rolls. Trust me. They will be perfect! 
I also baked mine so that each roll touched one another once the were risen and baked. They were the most beautiful rolls I've ever made.

These have such a good taste that you can't quit eating them! My only complaint is that mine were really dense. I did not have the proper amount of yeast, I don't believe, and I did not let them rise for long enough. (I made these by hand) I am going to try this recipe tomorrow to see how they due with the correct amount of yeast and for a longer time. The taste before was so good that I really, really hope these turn out the second time.  Update: I have made these again with bread flour and a full packet of yeast, and they turned out much better. I am positive that a third time would result in perfect rolls!

This dough is very easy to work with. I only had skim milk on hand so I used 1 c skim instead of half water and half regular milk and they turned out just lovely. So the reicpe is forgiving and it makes nice cinnamon buns as well. Thanks to whoever posted the recipe.

Made these last night. Not bad but weren't as sweet as I was expecting and didn't have qiute the flavor I had hoped for. Used unsalted butter b/c it was what I had on hand. Next time I'll use salted butter and add more sugar.

I liked this recipe, but mine didn't look any thing like the picture.  They were shaped like crescent rolls.  Mine also cooked faster than the recipe said.  I will make these again.  I did half whole wheat and half bread flour.  They were good with just a hint of sweetness.

Loved these rolls as did my family.  Very easy to make.  I used my kitchenaid and proofed the yeast with the milk, water and sugar.  Than added the salt, butter and egg and lastly the flour.  These made wonderful rolls to go along with the slow cooker chicken and dumplings from this site.  My daughters also used them to make sandwiches.  Will make again.

These were great! This is my first time making homemade rolls and I think they turned out pretty good if I do say so myself!  I don't have a bread machine, so I winged it using previous posts. They were a tad heavier than I expected, but the taste was WOW! If anyone knows why this might be (the heaviness) please feel free to drop me a line! Thanks for the great recipe.

Probably the best rolls I've ever tasted.  This will become my main roll recipe from now on.  Don't have a breadmaker, so I followed the instructions from the 1st reviewer K. Praper.  I don't have a kitchenaid, so I just used a whisk to get the butter and the first few scoops of flour incorporated (see her instructions).  Then I used a regular spatula and stirred everything together.  The baking part turned out great, too.  Turn oven to 350 and bake on the bottom rack for 10 minutes.  Then put on the middle rack and bake for 2 more minutes.  They cook evenly and have a nice light golden color.  Delicious!

Amazing rolls! I have been cooking/baking for 20+ years and learned breadmaking by hand and this was the simplist well tasting recipe that I have every used (I cheated and used the bread machine for dough). Makes great sandwiches with summer sausage and spicy mustard!

Perfect! 1 and 3 yr old loved them, hubby ate 3! I think I will make them in my Kitchen Aid next time so I can better monitor the consistency of the dough. I could tell my bread machine wasn't getting all the flour incorporated while it was kneading, so my dough was sticky after the initial rising. I added more flour as I shaped the rolls and they were fine. Will try half wheat flour next time too.

These rolls are AWESOME!! Big hit at our house and I have even been given specific instructions from extended family to bring some to their house when I make them again. Loved them and so very easy to make. I did NOT alter the recipe at all. No need to. Thanks so much!

I can home from work and my wife had made these. The house smelled wonderful and then I got to taste the rolls. They were wonderful. She rolled them into cresent shape and then let them rise the additional hour, before placing into the oven.

I baked this recipe for my Christmas dinner this year and there was no left overs after the dinner. What a success! I would reduce the amount of sugar next time though

I made these with Christmas dinner, and they were my favorite part of the meal!  I used only 3 1/2 tablespoons of butter in the dough and didn't add any on top (didn't roll them up, either, just dropped 7 balls in 3 sprayed pie pans, making 21 rolls).  I also used 1 cup whole wheat flour in place of 1 cup of the white flour.  Oh, and for the pan I wanted to serve immediately, I only let it rise for 30 minutes after it came out of the bread machine (had them in the oven on "Warm") and I didn't notice much of a difference between them and the ones that rose for an hour.  SOOO good, especially warm!  Will definitely make this again!

Simply the best dinner rolls out there, very easy recipe. My only problem is that I buttered the top twice and it still look 'undercook'. Can anyone offer tips on how to make the crust look golden?

Used this recipe without a bread machine- did the traditional kneading, etc. and came out with a GREAT sweet bread. I used it for sticky bun, and was impressed- it is even better than my mom's usual recipe for sweet bread-I am converted!

This is the roll recipe I've been looking for :)  These got GREAT reviews from family and friends.  I was asked why i didn't make a double batch and my brother-in-law asked me to make them again for his b-day dinner.  I made 12 clover leaf rolls from deviding the dough into 36 balls and placing 3 balls in each cup of my muffin tin.  Next time I'm trying the 9x13 pan and 18 balls.  GREAT recipe....Thanks :)

Although I am an experienced cook, this was the first time I ever tried yeast rolls. I followed the directions carefully even to the water temp. I put 1 teas. sugar in with my yeast. I used less sugar as some did, but I wish I had left it in. I used bread flour and sifted well before I added flour a little at a time, reserving part to work in as I kneaded. (About ½ cup) Kneaded about 8 min. with remaining flour, and let the dough rise in warm place about 2 hrs. Shaped dough into balls lightly handling and placed in pan. Let them rise until well doubled about 1 hr. They were delicious! A little dense, but still a big improvement over store bought. But next time I will add all the sugar, and play with the receipe. I will definitely make these rolls again.

These were disappointing - the texture was off. I'd recommend Bread Machine Rolls, also from this site. We enjoyed them far more than these.

These are foolproof.  My whole family loves this recipe!  I have made it several times.  I once forgot to cut the dough in half and ended up with eight rolls instead of sixteen.  I was worried that I had messed them up, but no, they were just much bigger.  They are better than Quincy's Yeast Rolls.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Wow!  Everything that could go wrong DID go wrong when I made this rolls, but they still turned out great! My bread machine wasn't working, so I had to remove the partially made dough and finish it in my kitchen aid mixer with the dough hook.  Then, when I rolled out the dough it kept sticking to the  cutting board, so I had to add a lot of flour which I knew was a no no but I just had to!  The rolls still turned out amazingly well and everyone loved them.  I will make these the good old fashioned way next time, though!

I altered this recipe by adding a half a cup of cooked, plain, mashed potatoes and increasing the sugar by 1/4 cup. Flour will also increse by 2 - 3 cups. This was done for a serving size of 16.  After they rose, I mashed them down and rolled them out.  I cut them into circles and placed them in the pan and let them rise again.  I then baked them in a 375 oven for about 15 minutes. They came out fantastic.  Much thanks to the originator.

I made these the first time for Thanksgiving dinner, and they got rave reviews!  I followed another reviewer's suggestion to cut into 12 pieces, roll into balls and bake in a 9x13 pan.  I baked them for about 15 minutes at 350.

I'm sure these will be made over and over again at my house!  SO good.

I made 2 batches of these today to take to our Thanksgiving dinners. Everyone loves them. I did use bread machine flour instead of all purpose and it turned out great. I made a batch on Monday to try them before I took them anywhere and my husband ate 4 at one time, he said they tasted better than a certain resturants rolls. Thanks for the great recipe. I will be making these often.

These turned out wonderful!  I don't have a bread machine, so I made the necessary adjustments. I doubled the recipe, for Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow!  The only major difference I made was that I used 3 packets of yeast (3/4 tsp).  Wonderful recipe, thank you!

I have used this recipe for years.  Last week I made 12 batches of rolls for our Annual Booster Club Chili Feed.  I now have people calling me at home to ask if I will make these rolls for them. I'm just sending them to this site to get the recipe.  These are great!

I made this and they came out ok, but after they cool down, they are really difficult to eat and get incredibly hard. 
Maybe I did something wrong.

If you have a stand mixer they are a breeze to make.  It does the mixing and kneading for you.  My family loved the flavor and were so impressed that I made homemade dinner rolls.  I will definitely make these again.

This recipe is amazing!!!!  I made these last night and they were tender, fluffy and perfect!  My husband and three sons loved it.  Used my bread machine dough cycle and when it came out I was afraid it was too wet, but when I put it on my floured board, it came out perfect!  Thank you so much for this recipe!  I am sure that I will use this many, many times.  My boys asked me this morning when I was going to make some more!  LOL

Anything that saves time by using the breadmaker to make dough is great in my books. When I made the crescent shape, I connected the two ends of the dough to make a cute little roll. They came out perfect! Be sure and keep an eye on them while cooking - they go from golden to dark quite quickly.

Absolutely perfect!!! I made half as directed and the other half as cinnamon rolls which are in the fridge for tomorow morning. I did not have a machine so I did the following: Proof yeast in the water and sugar. Heat milk and butter. Add egg. Add yeast mixture and then salt. Mix in flour. (I had to use more that the recipe called for but it is very humid today) kneeaded for about ten minutes and then set to rise. This is for sure going in my cookbook!!!

Fabulous recipe!  They turned out perfect the first time I tried them (and that's uncommon for me and bread recipes).  I don't make any changes to this recipe.  Its perfect as it is.  This has become a family favorite.

I am torn on how many stars to rate this.  I made the dough and had to add more flour than called for and still yet the dough was sticky. (it rained that day but still, have never had to add that much extra before on a rainy day)  When I rolled it out to make the cinnamon rolls the dough easily tore. It was very delicate.  Now I have made many, many cinnamon rolls before.  I only switched to this recipe because my parents have a bread machine and my recipe was too big, so I know how the dough normally feels.   Even after all that my parents and my brother loved the rolls.  (I live far away and don't get to visit but once every year and a half so this is the first time I made rolls for them)  But having my own recipe to compare them too, I don't think they match up, that's why only 4 stars.

Thanks for sharing!

I received a bread machine for Christmas one year and all I had used in it was the pre packaged bread ingredients. YUCK! I was just about ready to give the machine away until I found this recipe over a year ago and love it! We have this at least once a week. I even put the left over in a zip lock bag and microwave them for a few seconds very good! They are also yummy with honey butter. Thanks for the recipe!

These were good, but a little more on the doughy side, but that could be my fault.  I made these in the bread maker, then rolled them into balls and made cloverleaf rolls.  I put them outside in the sun to rise.  They were kinda a heavy yeast roll.  I served them with honey butter.  Needless to say everyone filled up on rolls, so I have plenty of left overs!!  Thanks for the recipe.

These will be the ONLY rolls I make for a special dinner! EDIT: I have been making these rolls for over two years now and my husband always begs for them! Just the other day he came home with a big jar of yeast and a giant bag of flour so I could make him these rolls more often! These are so great, and versatile. Thanks, Donna, for a staple in our household!

I made these rolls both plain and with a cinnamon/brown sugar filling. Both were delicious and incredibly simple to make. I'm inspired to start using my bread machine again! Thanks for a great recipe.

I was a bit shocked that they are so sweet (duh), after I got over that I havent stopped making these.  I'm not a big fan of bread machines & the dough is so easy to work with that I actually enjoy making these, which is a good thing because they vanish quickly.  Fantastic rolls, thanks for submitting.

We are not bakers around here - but these are pretty fool-proof. My husband actually made them last night with the help of our bread machine - I only stepped in to assist in rolling them up. He did great! These are delicious - soft, chewy, buttery yeast rolls that are just slightly sweet, I think. Give them a try!

Mmmmmm!!! I followed the recipe exactly and these turned out perfect! The dough was so easy to work with! I took the extra time to form into crescents and they turned out very pretty. Because the dough had such a nice subtle sweetness and smooth texture, I will probably try this for cinnamon rolls soon, as suggested!

Pretty good, but not what I expected.  I may have let them rise too much.  They ended up like biscuits, but they had a great taste.

If I could give this recipe a 10, I would! I have never been so successful w/ yeast before! I followed K Praper's review (to mix by hand b/c I don't have a bread machine). Except I threw in the salt while proofing the yeast. After fooling with the dough for too long I made 16 rolls, I thought they would come out too little (probably from trying to decide it I wanted to make crescents or rolls), but they didn't. The taste reminds me of the Hawaiian rolls you can buy. Don't be alarmed if they come out of the oven pale, they don't brown much unless you use egg wash. I will be making this very often. Thank you so much!!

Made these for an Easter get-together this weekend, and everyone loved them! I always make the rolls, and I wanted to try something different this year. They were a big hit. No bread machine, but I always use the method on the Rapid-Rise yeast packages when I make bread, which is very simple, and it worked beautifully. Mix all your dry ingredients. Heat the liquids to 125-130 (nuke in microwave around 2 min.). I tempered the eggs and added the liquids and eggs to the dry mixture, kneaded in my Kitchen Aid mixer (had to add some extra flour so that it wasn't so sticky), let it rest 10 min. (replaces first rise) and shaped into crescent rolls. Let rise and bake. They were light and buttery and puffed much more than my standard recipe. Loved them! Doubled the receipe but wished I had made more.

I followed some of the other readers suggestions since I don't have a bread machine.  The flavor of these was great.  It was my first time making homemade bread so I was a little nervous!  The only thing I had problems with was the shape of the rolls.  I chose not to make crescents and tried to shape them into balls but they weren't very uniform.  My family enjoyed them regardless!  Not sure if I will go to the trouble again, though.

The rolls were good, but not the texture I was expecting. They were a 3/4 roll and 1/4 biscuit texture. Not the light fluffy cresent roll type roll I was looking for.

This is a great bread recipe.    These came out great and there are so many possibilities.  I left some dough aside for fried dough for dessert, excellent! I also wrapped half up with a slice of american cheese, YUmmmm.  Kids and hubby loved them.  They were even great a few days later heated in the micro for 45 seconds.  Excellent texture, and not too sweet.  I am also going to try making Ham/cheese rolls and freeze for lunches and Cheese/hotdog rolls for a quick snack/dinner.  Thank you!

i had been searching for days for the perfect dinner roll recipe, and i am pleased to say that i have found it! this recipe is easy, fast and delicious. i do not have a bread machine so i followed another person suggestion with using a stand mixer.  I made clover rolls and right before baking them i drizzled each with honey and butter, my family loved them. i will be using this recipe again!!!!!

I made these last night without a bread machine.  The dough didn't rise as much as I thought it would and maybe that was because I used a dough hook.  I may try mixing by hand next time to avoid overworking the dough.  But the taste and texture were great.  Added garlic to top them off.  Will use an egg wash next time to brown them a bit more.

A good recipe - gave it 4 stars because I like my rolls to be a bit more dense.

This makes a great dough and it was very easy to work with.  I found it a little sweet for dinner rolls but it would great for cinnamon buns.  I will try it again with a little more salt and less sugar.

Pretty good.  My husband and kids really liked them butI would prefer them a little sweeter and moister.  So more sugar and less time.

Excellent rolls, and easy to make.  I had a hard time getting them all the same size/shape, but I am not a very good baker, so that was probably my fault.  Since some of the rolls were smaller than the others, the smaller ones were darker than the larger, and not quite as good.  I will add a little more salt next time too.

Exactly what I was looking for!  Most dinner rolls that I've tried are very dense and heavy.  These were so light and airy and had a wonderful flavor.  Tasted and looked like they came from a bakery.  The best part was the simplicity of the recipe!  Top notch!

Delicious! If you using a bread machine, keep an eye on the rise, as mine rose so much that it stuck to the lid.  I also baked at 350 (took 16 minutes) and left out the second application of butter.

I used 2.5 tsp of bread machine yeast.  I subbed half whole wheat flour.  Per another reviewer's suggestion, I rolled the dough and then cut into 36 pieces (pizza cutter) and placed three balls of dough into each muffin cup.  I didn't spread butter on them after rolling so I think maybe they weren't quite as decadent...maybe that's why I thought they were very good but not the "ultimate" roll.  Still, they were very good and very easy.

Yum! I don't have a breadmaker so I followed reviewer's recommendations for making these using my Kitchen Aid mixer. I ended up rolling the dough into balls and baking 9 in a square pan and 7 in round aluminum pan (which I plan to freeze for later.) Very tasty! Will certainly make again!

I made these for Thanksgiving and they were a big hit.  The main difference I made was I reduced the oven temperature to 350 and baked them for about 20 minutes.  They turned out golden brown, even the bottom of the rolls.  My first batch, baked at 400 degrees like the recipe says just came out a little too dark for my liking on the bottom of the roll

So deliciious!! I accidentally forgot the egg but these still turned out fabulous!! I dont have a breadmaker so I put the water, milk, sugar, and yeast together and let it bloom, then combined everything else. I let it rise once, the made them into rolls/knots, then let them rise again. They were wonderful!

Very tasty and easy!  I don't have a bread machine, so I used the instructions that others had posted.  Also, like another reviewer, I didn't want to make crescent rolls, so I just divided the dough into 16 balls and made rolls.  I brushed a little bit of butter on them while they were baking, but definitely didn't use as much as the recipe called for brushing on.  The rolls turned out great, I baked them at 350 for about 12-15 min.  My first time making rolls from scratch and they turned out great!  THANKS!

Pretty good rolls, very easy to make and the dough is very easy to work with.  Not the best tasting that I have made, however.  I used the traditional method of preparation.  My bread machine went to Goodwill a long time ago, I didn't like how it worked in general.

These rolls are the best!  My husband and my kids love it when I make these.  Thanks so much for the recipe!  We always brush with honey butter when they come out of the oven. It gives them a great sticky flavor.

I made these rolls today. I am on a low sodium diet and found the refrigerated rolls from the supermarket to be too high in sodium. 

Having said this, I was looking for a nice, soft buttery dinner roll to make from scratch. I followed the recipe exactly in my bread machine, except I accidentally used 1/4 cup butter instead of 1/3 cup. 

The dough came out extremely sticky. I had to add a lot of extra flour to make it managable. I also looked at the "most helpful" reviews and decided to make clover style rolls using a muffin  pan. I brushed the tops with butter before baking and again after they were cooked.

These were just ok, but nothing to write home about. My sons did not care for them at all. Hubby ate them with tons of butter and gravy from the chicken we had for dinner. The dogs loved the leftovers though :-). 

I'll try the recipe one more time and will follow the directions exactly making them into crescent rolls to be fair.  There must be some reason mostly everyone raved about them on this site.

Excellent recipe!  I was running short on time and decided to turn this recipe into a loaf instead of rolls.  I divided the dough into 2 equal parts.  In between them I put butter and cinnamon sugar.  I baked at 375 for 20-25 mins.  It was a dense bread, tasted great! I served it to the ladies book club at our morning meeting with coffee and tea.  They all loved it!

I made these as cloverleaf rolls and the first words out of hubby's mouth was "These are a keeper". Very easy using bread machine. I can't wait to try these as cinnamon rolls or monkey bread.

WOW!!!  I have never been able to make any kind of yeast rolls worth eating until now.  These are beyond words good.  They taste a lot like the Sister Schuberts rolls I have always bought in the grocery store.  Well, no more...from now on, I will make my own with this recipe!!  Thanks for a great one.

So yummy! I am just now eating these rolls for the first time. They were fun to make and turned out perfect. I used half white flour and half whole wheat flour and they are so delicious! Thank you so much for the recipe! I love this cite! I am becoming a better cook and baker.

These were good and pretty easy.  I used my kitchen aid mixer for the whole processo--with the dough hook.  They were a little heavy, but I will probably make them again.

These rolls are so easy and delicious.  I also do not have a bread maker, but made them in my kitchen aid and then proceeded to follow the recipe after letting them rise for 1 hour.  If you don't have a lot of time and need a great roll fast - this recipe will not disappoint you.

These came out EXCELLENT!  I made exact, except when I was rolling up the dough, I added some sweet cream filling(cream cheese, powdered sugar, dash of vanilla) and had a wonderful pastry dessert!  YUMMY!  The whole family LOVED these, definately a great and easy sweet dough recipe!  (oh and I made some regular dinner rolls without the sweet cream and they were just as delish!)

These were very very good although not what I was looking for... i was hoping for somthing alot more sweet if anyone has any good ideas, but as for these, they were a very good dinner roll. I turned these into rolls instead of cresants and if you do that make sure you get a big enough pan or they dont cook in the middle. but even with that mistake they were amazing

OMG...I can't believe I am saying this but these were better than my MamMaw's rolls. And so much easier! I have been intimidated by her recipe, wanting to get more experience before I attempted it. These are so good that as much as I loved & miss my grandmother, I'm sticking w/ these. ;o) I  tore them into balls, folded them over & baked them in a pie plate (parker house style) in honor of MamMaw cause that's how she made her's. My brother said they were his favorite thing about  Easter dinner & took the remaining few home w/ him. Thanks for helping me score some merit points w/ him!

These were light, slightly sweet yeast rolls that were delicious!  I rolled mine into balls instead of making the crescent shapes.  I also made cinnamon rolls, which turned out great!

The taste of these rolls were very good.  I love just about any kind of homemade bread but I had a bit of trouble with the whole process.  I tried to make these in the bread machine and when I took out the dough, I kind of punched it down, and kneaded it just for a few seconds then I pulled apart a bit at a time to make small round rolls.  I let them sit for quite a while as I left for my sons basketball game and came home to no difference in rise.  so, I put them in a 200 degree oven until they rose a bit, then as I was heating the oven to 400, most of them kind of fell.  I baked as instructed and put an egg wash on some.  The taste was great but the appearance was not what I was hoping for.  Next time I think I'll use the kitchen aid! Maybe my yeast is getting on the old side, not sure but wouldn't want to serve these to company as flat as they were!  Need to keep practicing at my baking skills that's for sure.

This lovely dough came together so nicely that I was jealous of my bread machine and I wished I could have had my hands in it instead! I used it for 2 sweet recipies--cinnamon rolls, and a filled braid. Fluffy and yummy!

I made these for Thanksgiving - usually my MIL's job - and they were so good, I was asked to make them for Christmas dinner, too.  So easy and so good! UPDATE:  These are now requested by my family, and every holiday, special dinner, etc., I have to make and bring these.  I sometimes make a whipped butter with honey and cinnamon (in the Kitchenaid stand mixer) to serve with them.

Great recipe!  I've made this several times.  I have family members lining up by the oven door to pull them off the cookie sheets, they never make it to the bread basket!  I don't use a bread maker & just follow the directions of "traditional" bread making recipes.

Wowie! Flaky & delicious! And yes, they get HUGE! Only thing I changed was to use all milk instead of half milk, half water. I am not sure if it made any difference, since I did not make any the original way, but they were great! Thanks for the recipe!

nice rolls but here's a warning- don't put them in the oven on the "warm" setting and leave them 45 mins!  the "warm" setting on my oven is just too warm for that long!  i should've taken them out after 20 mins.  they overproofed and went flat.

Wonderful! I was looking for a soft and light roll to serve with Thanksgiving dinner. My mom kept the leftovers she was so pleased. She is pretty picky about bread. That's the best review I can get!!!

Very buttery and soft.  I didn't have a bread machine so I had to knead by hand.

Because I did not have a bread machine I had to modify the recipe.  It did not turn out well.  They turned out more biscuit like versus roll like.  I did not even bother to use them.

I would like to find recipes that don't use bread machines.

UPDATE: I used this dough (made in a bread machine) as a base for sticky buns.Roll as for cinnamon rolls and cut into 16 pcs. In two 9" cake pans, smear with this mixture: Beat together the following ingredients 1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 firmly packed brown sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter at room temperature
1/2 cup light corn syrup (didn’t have light corn syrup, used half honey and half dark corn syrup, was great)
1 tsp pure vanilla extract
Divide in half and smear into pans.
Let rise(or refrigerate overnight, covered with plastic wrap) until doubled in size. Bake about 20 minutes, until rolls are clearly done (not doughy) when you pull two rolls gently apart.
 Was great! This is a great recipe, I use it for dinner rolls, bread or "pocket sandwiches" with meat fillings. It has a rich flavor and is easy to work with.

The recipe is so easy, my 12-year-old made these rolls for Thanksgiving.  We substituted 2 cups of whole wheat flour and used baking Splenda instead of the regular sugar.  Also watch the rolls as they bake, because we had to reduce the baking time to prevent burning.  They were very tasty and none of the kids noticed that we had used whole wheat flour.

These are wonderful rolls and so easy to make!  I followed the recipe as stated...I left my rolls in a warm spot to rise and the cat apparently thought it was a warm spot too.  Needless to say, a few of my rolls were a little smooshed.

These are, by far, the best dinner rolls that I have ever made.  After tasting one, my wife said that she will never again buy any store bought dinner rolls.  Kudo's!

I am giving 5 stars because this dough is so easy to make and work with.  I do not have a bread machine and it came out beautifully.  It tasted great also. My only tip is roll the dough out pretty thin and follow the directions to roll tightly. Some of my cresents came apart in baking.  I look forward to using this dough many ways. Thanks.

I made croissants a couple of times using this recipe. They come out very soft and are excellent with some honey butter. I brush the rolls with egg before baking to brown the tops a little. Next I want to try some other shapes with this dough. Thanks!

My family absolutly LOVES these rolls!  I've attempted a couple of other roll recipes in the past with terrible results of them never rising.  I'm very inexperienced.  So I attempted these with hesitation, but they turned out beautifully.  Very light and fluffy with great flavor.  I will only make these rolls from now on.

the texture was okay but not as soft and fluffy as I wanted it to be and also not sweet enough. I was expecting a sweet dinner roll just like it says. I still think my sweet rolls recipe is better than this. Thanks anywaY.

Absolutely wonderful!! I added a bit more flour like some other reviewers suggested and they are perfect. Just finished eating my first roll and it will not be my last, that I can assure you!  These are the new "house" rolls!  I will never make any others.  Thank you so much for the recipe!  YUM!

These had good flavor but turned out a bit dry for my taste.  Next time I will use 1/4 c. less flour and I think they would be better.  Good but not as good as my favorite "Diana's Hawaiian Rolls" from this site.

These rolls tasted great, and were SO easy to make.  I almost "chickened out" and didn't make the crescents, as I was leaning towards tearing off pieces and putting them in muffin tins.  At the last minute I decided to go ahead and just make the crescent, and it turned out that it was WAY easier than making rolls the other way.  Thanks for such a great and easy recipe!

These rolls are absolutely delicious! I made them the night before Easter and had to make another batch for Easter dinner because we ate most of them for breakfast. Increase the recipe to 4 cups of flour and use muffin pans for baking. I put three balls of dough dipped in butter into each muffin cup and they turned out like Parkerhouse Rolls. Will definitely make again!

The best roll recipe I've ever used. Just the right amount sweetness.  I love the feel of this dough when working with it. I did not cut into wedges.  I make cloverleaf rolls by placing 3 balls each into muffin cups.  My family loves it.

These were good but it made way to many for my family of 5.  The 1 pkg.of active dry yeast, I used 1 1/2 tsp. of the jarred bread machine yeast.  Probably won't make again for awhile.  Too many recipes to try.

I love this recipe.  They turned out perfect.  Just like any breadmachine recipe you should check the dough after the first five minutes and add more flour or water as needed.  I made them for a party and they were a big hit.

I've made other sweet doughs in the bread machine that were far superior - the dough was very sticky; we had to add so much extra flour to make it workable, that the flavor was hurt.  Also, the butter made them even more soggy than they already were!

Perfect, slightly sweet and easy to work with! I was worried when these didn't rise much during the proofing, but they sure puffed up in the oven!

I have tried many different recipes and this one has come out the best.  My wife actually had more than one.  Usually she'll eat half of one then choke to death because it was dry.  These came out great.  I'll sure make these again.  After the rolls came out of the oven I brushed them with more butter.  It was a hit.

Definetly very light and (as a previous reviewer put it) "pillowy".  I saved half of the dough for cinnamon rolls and baked 8 crescent rolls with the other half for dinner.  We haven't had dinner yet - I hope I made enough!

My first time ever to make bread.  Is easy, the only thing I did'nt like was the waiting, one hour here and one hour there, but oh, is well worth the wait.  My family liked it a lot, even my 6 years old had 3 at dinner time.  I will difinely make it again.

I divided the dough into 9 large rolls. Four were eaten with dinner and the remainder were used to make sandwiches the next day. Absolutely loved it and am making my second batch right now! Wonderful!

This is the 1st time I ever made rolls from scratch and I was nervous about the task.  Turns out it was so easy using my bread maker.  These dinner rolls were exactly what I hoped for.  They were delicious!  I'll definitely make them again.

excellent.  except the recipe has an error in it.  use 1/8 cup butter on each round, instead of 1/4 cup.  otherwise, the rolls are swimming in butter and the bottoms are fried looking.

This was the first recipe that I tried with my brand new bread machine...WOW!! I should have bought a bread machine a long time ago- I loved the way these rolls taste- I honestly was expecting them to be a little bit more sweet- but that was OK. Try these- they are pretty good.

These rolls are delicious.  I was glad that I was finally able to make a roll so easily that tasted as good as my mother's did years ago.  To my surprise, I found her old recipe and compared it to this one and it is almost identical, except that hers was doubled and done by hand instead of with a bread machine.  I have used this recipe for making cinnamon rolls, as well, and they are light and tasteful.

Excellent recipe!!  These rolls were soooo good (I ate three).  Instead of making them into the cresent shape suggested, I made 6 balls and baked them in a small pan.  I placed the remaining rolls on a cookie sheet and froze them and put them in a freezer bag for future use.  Thanks for the amazing recipe!!

Fabulous! I made these with Easter dinner this year and they were the perfect compliment to the meal. Soft, doughy, and lightly sweet. These rolls don't even need butter, they can stand on their own. Thank you!

Came out a bit too chewy.  I don't have a bread machine, so maybe I over mixed by hand.  Very good flavor though.

The most delicous dinner rolls I've ever had!  I made them for my new in-laws when they came for dinner and everyone LOVED them!  They're very light and buttery and soo good.  I used a cake of fresh yeast---they were wonderful!!

These have a great flavor.  Mine turned out kind of heavy, but I think it was because I didn't let them rise for long enough.  I'm going to try them again, the flavor was worth it!  Thanks.

These rolls were okay - not the 5 stars others had given them.  The rolls were light and fluffy, but didn't have much flavor to them.  I might try them again with adding honey to the mix and increase the sugar to 12 cup.  Very easy to make, just needs a few adjustments.

Turned out great the first time!  I'd been looking for a recipe to rival my Mom's dinner rolls, and I found it.  The ease of using the bread machine is awesome.  Can't wait to try it for cinnamon rolls!  Thanks for sharing.

This made incredible, melt-in-your-mouth rolls. I followed the recipe EXACTLY, and it came out perfect. I shaped the dough into hamburger buns (8 large), sprinkled them with minced onion, and baked them on my baking stone. They were amazing. Made even basic hamburgers taste like a gourmet meal. I will definitely be making these into crescent rolls to go with the roast I plan on making later this week. This recipe will be very well used here.

I have made several (at least 10) other dinner roll recipes and this one is by far THE BEST! The only thing I change was to form the dough into balls and brush them with melted butter. Everyone who tasted the rolls loved them.

I didn't find these rolls to be very sweet at all. Overall they were just mediocre. However, they did turn out very pretty. Next time I will try adding honey.
