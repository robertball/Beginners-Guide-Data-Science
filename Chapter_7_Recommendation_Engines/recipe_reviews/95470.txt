Very delicate, delicious cake--very different from the more "hearty", spiced carrot cake we're all used to.  I loved the lemon flavor and the light icing--perfect for serving at a tea or brunch.  Mine came out a little dark on top, so you may want to cover with foil the last 20 minutes or so of baking.  I'll be serving again for special occasions!

This cake was a little too lemony for me. I was looking for something closer to carrot cake. This, while good, did not taste anything like carrot cake. It is light and would be good to serve at a tea or luncheon.

Well, I didn't expect that.  And I knew not to expect a normal carrot cake but wow.  The lemon on top gives a wham bam, thank you ma'am.

Nice summery flavors with the addition of lemon.  I liked it very much.  Goes great with tea.

I baked the cake for 40 minutes, substituted pecans for almonds and made the glaze with 1/2 teaspoon almond extract and milk instead of lemon juice with the powdered sugar. Turned out delicious and was greatly enjoyed by the family.
