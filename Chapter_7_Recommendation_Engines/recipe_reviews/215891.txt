Very rich and hearty. I had potato parmesan gnocchi and Ragu tomato basil sauce to use.  Quick and simple to get dinner on the table.

Delicious.  But 'd like to see if the gnocchi might be less soft and mushy if you just baked them in the sauce, etc without boiling first

For ease of preparation and  a comfort food feel while using just a few ingredients, I'm giving it 5 stars. I found a whole wheat gnocchi with sweet potato from Italy in my supermarket. In the casserole it tasted just like the standard gnocchi made with white potatoes.  Great for an easy weekday meal and I served with salad.

Popular with my 15-year old son.  This was the first time we ever ate gnocci.  He wants me to make it again.

My daughter loves this dish, when we lived in Italy we had this all the time. So yummy.
