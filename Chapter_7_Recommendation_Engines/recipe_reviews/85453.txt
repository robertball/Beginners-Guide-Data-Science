These were wonderful.  My family were surprised how "normal" they tasted!  People kept sneaking more after the table was cleared.

For a passover brownie recipe, this was really exceptional.  People were remarking how incredibly moist these were, and adding the chocolate chips in was a real surprise plus to them.  Definitely on the menu for next year's seder!

This are really good. My Jewish relatives loved them and were shocked that they were kosher for passover. I think I added a little too much salt, and I could taste it, but no one else seemed to notice. I'll just be extra careful when measuring the next time!

Probably 5 stars for a Passover recipe and 3 for a regular one so I give it 4.  :-)  Followed directions except to use a 9x9 and cook for 5 minutes less.

This is great for Pesach. I don't use matzo meal so I just sub in extra potato starch for it. Much tastier and cheaper than store bought. I plan on making it again this holiday!

I made these brownies on Passover and I made them last year on Passover too. They were excellent. What I liked about them is that they did not burn like some these recipes that call for a lot of oil and when I greased the pan in these other Passover Brownie recipes, it made it worse. Applesauce is a good substitute for oil. I did not need applesauce in these brownies. However, I did substitute light margarine for the butter. Joanie's Pesach Brownies is one of the best Passover Brownies, I ever made. I doubled the recipe. My husband and I really liked them. They were DELICIOUS.
