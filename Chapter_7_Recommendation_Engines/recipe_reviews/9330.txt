AMAZING. So incredibly good and very very easy to whip up. I don't even sift the flour/spices. I just throw it in the bowl after I've mixed the wet ingredients. An easy, one-bowl recipe. I've also been in a hurry and baked it immediately after mixing and it turned out just fine, along with getting the beautiful crackles on top. I dip the tops of the dough balls in sugar b4 baking and sprinkle a little on top after it's done. I also use 50/50 white and light brown sugar which gives it a richer taste. Spice amounts are also right on. For walnut size dough balls, 10 min. is the perfect baking time. My master molasses recipe from now on.  TIP - I'm quite firm about using real butter for all my baking recipes, but Molasses cookies is the one exception. Using shortening will give this cookie it's chewiness so I'd recommend NOT to substitute with butter.

These come out exactly the way a molasses cookie should!  2 things: Definitely watch cooking time...if you like a chewy cookie, stick to the approx. 10min bake time-they may look too undercooked but that is fine. If you like a crispy cookie, let them go 2 mins longer.  They definitely go from being chewy to being crispy QUICK so watch the time!!  Also, just an FYI, I started out using coarse sugar sprinkles by Wilson (the decorator kind)but changed to the standard fine red sugar that you find in the grocery store.  The coarse sugar looked pretty but was too crunchy for this cookie.

These were really good. Usually, I do not even like molasses cookies, but these were nice and chewy on the inside, not too sweet, and just the right amount of spice. My father loved them,and my friend said they were the best ginger bread cookies she has ever had! My mother though, first felt they tasted a lot like fried oil, whick I think was because of the shortening, but then said they were good after a few bites. But I think next time, I will try them with butter instead, just to avoid the oil taste. Oh and they were perfect after only 3  hours of refrigeration. All in all, fabulous recipe! Thanks for sharing it!!!**UPDATE**: I have now tried them with butter instead, and they are sooo amazingly perfect! From now on, I will only make them with butter.

REALLY yummy! Spiced well and taste like perfect little gingersnaps but not rock hard. I added 2 TBS of corn syrup to make them a bit chewy. The recipe makes tons too!

Oh, my gosh, these are great!  I followed recipe as written, refrigerated dough 4 hours and baked.  While first batch was in the oven, I rolled rest of 
dough and put in fridge until ready for next batch, then rolled the balls in sugar and baked.  Dough very easy to work with.  Ten minutes at 375 and the cookies were PERFECT; just the right amount of crisp on outside and softness inside. The texture could not be better and the taste was a perfect blend of spices (even though they were a bit too sweet for my husband) and a big hit with neighbors.  Thanks, Karin, for this great recipe.  I'll e making these again and again!

Delicious!  I made these for Christmas and they were a real hit with my family.  I live in Australia and couldn't buy all of the ingredients, so I substituted butter for shortening and treacle for molasses.  This recipe is a keeper. =D

AMAZING!  Moist, just the right amount of spice, yummy!!!  Per other reviews, I used 1 c. shortening and 1/2 c. butter.  I omitted the cloves.  Also, I didn't melt the shortening (what is the point?), just creamed the shortening and butter together before adding other ingredients.  I also didn't chill the dough at all.  I could see if I was using a cookie cutter, but for these I didn't see the need.  They came out PERFECT!  Baked for 10 minutes so they would be a tiny bit crispy on the outside.  I sprinkled with powdered sugar per another review to make them pretty.  I will definitely make these again and again!

These were very good.  Smelled excellent when baking.  They do begin to get hard quicky, so I'd suggest storing them as soon as you can.

No need to melt then cool unless you have time to kill :)  Just blend the shortening in (like you would in normal cookies), then roll into balls as soon as the dough is complete (no need to refrigerate).

I've made this a bunch of times, and my favorite variation involves replacing 1/2 cup of shortening with real butter, half of the white sugar with brown sugar, and half of the molasses with honey, which gives the cookies a richer taste. I usually reduce the cloves by half as well since I don't like a strong clove taste. Delicious!

Very tasty cookies.  However, when it tells you to melt the crisco and then let it cool, you must let the crisco solidify all the way again (which makes me wonder why to melt it in the first place!)  If you do not, the cookies become the consistency of hockey pucks when they cool all the way.  The flavors are wonderful though.  I would attempt this recipe again, but not melting the crisco.

These cookies are absolutely phenomenal!  I'm not usually a huge fan of sugar cookies in general, but the spice and kick they have are so amazing.  By far one of the best recipes I've come across.  Thank you so much!

This recipe is outstanding.  I made about 10 dozen this year, because everyone kept asking for more!  The best part: making 10 dozen was so easy! I rolled in red and green sugar for the holidays.

These cookies are trememdous Karin and I thank you for submitting this wonderful recipe. I only had a quarter cup of molasses left so I subbed with honey and used brown sugar instead of the white. To add even more of a kick, I sprinkled a bit of cayenne pepper into the dough. I can't keep my hands out of the container! Thanks again and Happy Holidays!

Wow, these cookies are yummy!  It's so hard to stop at 1 or 2...family and friends loved them!  I took a chance and substituted butter for shortening. I also baked the cookies without refrigerating the dough first and as soon as they came out of the oven I sprinkled sugar on top.  They were perfect!  I will be making these again real soon.

I have been making these cookies for 40 years. This is the same recipe I found in our church cookbook 40 years ago. My husbands favorite. I did switch to butter a couple of years ago and they are just as good if not better. I use half butter half smart blend baking sticks. I cream that and proceed with the recipe. Last year I put finely dice candied ginger in. That my friends was the bomb.

Delicious recipe.  The cookies didn't flatten out as much as pictured, so maybe I rolled them too large.  Not sure what "walnut" sized is, but I made them about 1" in diameter.  Maybe I should have pressed the cookies slightly.  Regardless, they taste great!

This is a great recipe for molasses spice cookies.  Try them.  Personal taste may add more or less spice but the cookies are awesome and the recipe is just too easy.  Definitely a keeper.  Thank you so much for sharing it.

These have just become our new favorite cookies.  In fact, they're so good I'm afraid to make more because we can't seem to stop eating them. Made them exactly as directed and they were perfect.  I rolled mine in colored sugar for the holidays.

Delicious. These got rave reviews.  I wouldn't refrigerate the dough again, as it made it difficult to work with and I had to let it warm to room temperature anyways. I pressed down lightly on the balls of dough for some, and some I did not. I like the crackled apparance of the ones I pressed down, but the non-pressed ones stayed softer. I baked them for 8 minutes. I put the heel of a loaf of bread in the container I stored them in to soften them up as the became quite crispy only hours after coming out of the oven.  They are excellent cookies, and well worth the effort of rolling into balls (I generally prefer making drop cookies for simplicity and speed).

These cookies are, without any doubt, the best cookies I have ever made.  They were fast, easy and turned out perfectly.  The only thing I did differently was flatten them a little and drop one side into white sugar.  It gives them a bit of a crunchy top.  I learned that from my gramma!

ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING! I would give it 10 stars if I could! I bake them for 7-8 mins, and they come out AMAZING-- really crispy outside and super chewy/ gooey inside... even after completely cooled they are incredible.

Very good, just what I was looking for.  I didn't have ground cloves on hand so I used allspice.  I too was to eager to wait over night.  Tasted just like the ones at Tim Horton's.  I did find that they didn't go flat, the next pan I just rolled them more disk like then balls.  They look great, cracks and all.
Thanks Karin Christian

Outstanding!  I substituted butter and Smart Balance baking sticks for the shortening.  I also rolled them in purple and yellow sugar for spring.  I did not refrigerate and they rolled just fine.

I can't believe I forgot to rate these cookies. These are absolutely delicious!  I didn't have any shortening, so I substituted butter. The molasses makes them divine, and the spice amounts are just right. Go by the bake time as to not overcook them, no matter how they look. They are perfectly crunchy on the outside and chewy in the middle, and they stored fine for me.  I love spice cookies, and this is definitely my go to spice cookie recipe now! Thank you so much for this awesome recipe!

btw... For people who had flat cookies, invest in a cookie scoop.  Not sure if what caused the cookies to be flat, but a cookie scoop makes a perfect cookie!

I'm not sure how the recipe is without the following changes but I made these changes per some reviews and they were FABULOUS! 1} Take 2 tablespoons of the half cup of molasses away and replace it with honey. (I figured it would add more depth to the total flavor) 2} Substitute half of the white sugar with the same amount of TIGHTLY packed brown sugar. (makes a chewier and richer cookie /makes up for the missing molasses) 3}I doubt this made much of a difference but I used half unsalted butter and half shortening. Just a personal preference over all shortening. The dough is really stiff so have a mixer or be prepared for a little workout. The refrigeration isn't really necessary if you just use softened fats instead of melting them. Make sure to really keep and eye on these as they cook QUICK, The SECOND you see the edges just START to brown, take them out, even if it still seems doughy, I promise they will set and be wonderfully chewy once they cool down a bit. If you see my photos, I baked mine about a minute TOO long this time.

They were gone within minutes. My whole family (even the molasses haters) adored them! I switched out butter for shortening (didn't have any) and they were still great :)

I'm not a cook but I had all of Thanksgiving break to become one. I have made this recipe twice and everyone has loved them. They turned out great. I used margarin and no salt and they still worked great. One tip... take them out while still gooey otherwise they get really hard over say two days.

This recipe is better than I thought it would be.  I was a little worried when mixing the dough because it was crumbly.  However, after an overnite chill in fridge, the dough baked up deliciously.  The texture is crunchewy!!

Wow these are so good my family thinks I am a baking genius and I am sending them another batch tomorrow.  I did two small changes butter (because every cookie should be  baked with butter) and since I used butter these did not have to sit I was able to bake them right away and half brown half white sugar for more depth in flavor.  These will be made every christmas from now on.

Not extraordinary, just simply a nice, ordinary molasses sugar cookie which was exactly what I was after.  I did not melt the shortening.

Amazing cookies - it's true. I made these for Cub Scout camp and could accommodate all the allergies in the cub pack. Everyone loved them and I kept some at home for the remainder of the family to try. They were super. When they dry out a bit - try the bread in the container overnight as suggested. It works perfect. Highly recommended.

These were absolutely perfect! Good strong ginger flavor to compliment the molasses. And they are versatile. Regardless of how you like your molasses/spice cookies, these are for you. If you like a soft, chewy molasses cookie then make and bake them as directed. If you like a crisp 'gingersnap' kind of cookie, make them as directed, but instead of rolling in sugar, dip a glass in sugar and press flat. Same cook time, same cookie, two awesome variations! My mom likes crispy ones and my dad likes chewy. I was able to make cookies for both in only one batch...delicious!

This cookie reminds me of a gingersnap! I mixed the dough in about 10 minutes and used it right away. Do not melt the shortening, just cream it together with the sugar. This will allow you to use the dough immediately without chilling it.

These are the BEST!! I've never had so many people rave about my baking like this before.  Moist, delicious, chewy. These will impress even the fussiest people.  I plan on baking these thru Christmas.  I rolled my cookies in sugar and added red and green sprinkles to look Christmas-y

This is the same recipe my mother called Ginger Cookies.  My family loves these!  Just a note:  baking 8 minutes gets you a soft, chewy cookie, while 9-10 minutes creates a ginger snap.  Like others have said, keep in an airtight container.  I use the same cookie tin my mother did, 25 years later.

This was a great recipe! I left in the fridge overnight as I got caught up making lemon meringue pie while I was waiting on the dough to chill. They turned out fantastic! Ended up using the 8 minute bake time. Rolled in colored sugars and they're quite tasty looking. I've had one and have somehow managed not to eat the dozens of cookies this recipe makes. I love that I can share them all because this makes SO many cookies!

Definitely 5 stars! I'd recommend it. It's great as is...no modifications needed.

These cookies are excellent! Got so many compliments! I made two batches one with colored sugar and on drizzled with a simple icing both were great. I also upped the spices only because my family likes it that way. If I could give it a sixth star I would!

Used 1/2 cup margarine to 1 cup shortening.  Otherwise followed instructions.  Picture is misleading, it shows the cookies right out of the oven and they are puffed, but then settle as they cool.  I made 7 dozen and they were all perfect.  Started with 6 minutes baking time but found 8 minutes to be the right temp.

These tasted much better than the gingerbread cutout recipe.  The cloves really made these taste spicer than "gingerbread" cookies, sort of like the gingersnaps you buy at the store--only these are soft.

I have made these cookies hundreds of times. They were my favorite cookie as a kid and I still love them! I like the flour unsifted so that the cookies are crispy. Sifting the flour will make them more cake-like. I use a leveled Tbsp. of dough to make each cookie. Also, I NEVER melt the shortening or chill the dough!

These turned out delicious however mine cooked much faster than the recipe suggested.  I think in the end about 5 mins was accurate - when you take them out of the oven they almost seem raw and super soft to take off the pan however they really harden up after coming out of the oven.  Great recipe though - will be making these again for sure! They also freeze well and stay nice a and chewy.

I love these cookies.  The only problem is my husband and son don't like the taste of molasses so I end up eating the entire batch.  Good thing they freeze well. :)  Also, I cut back on the amount cloves (personal preference), flatten the balls before baking, and bake for 8 minutes.

please, please, if you must use shortening, use the butter flavored one from Crisco - every bite tasted like fried fish, or something.

I took these to a cookie exchange, and everyone loved them.  The have just the right amount of spicyness and a great chewy texture.  I don't like a crispy cookie, and these were perfect.  I refrigerated the dough overnight, and they were very easy to make.  They crackled nicely and were perfectly done in 9 minutes on my air-bake cookie sheet.

These cookies were so easy to make and it helps that I already have each ingredient right in my pantry!  I question the need to melt the shortening too but did it anyway (as it may probably help in incorporating the other ingredients).  I found an easy way to melt the shortening -- if you're using a Kitchenaid mixer, just put the shortening inside the KA bowl and put it over a pot of simmering water and after it melts, remove from pot and let it sit for a few minutes as indicated in the recipe.  Then I just dunk the ingredients straight into the bowl and attach it to my KA and start mixing! It's so incredibly easy doing it this way and lessens the washing afterwards.  I placed the dough in the fridge double wrapped the bowl in plastic and let it sit there overnight (purely coincidental as I did this at night) then in the morning pre-heated the oven and started rolling.  I flattened the balls a little bit and dipped it in my homemade colored sugars.  A trick I found useful was to place around a teaspoonful of sugar on top of the cookie after placing it in the cookie sheet than press it gently with the palm of your hand.  The sugar really adhered to the cookie and even had a nice crackled look to it.  Pressing will help give the cookie a nice round shape too.  Will definitely be making these again but will probably not refrigerate it anymore.

This is identical to a recipe from my grandmother and goes back almost 100  years!  The only difference was that to finish it, she used to sprinkle with confectioners sugar (through a sieve) instead of the sugar you show in your photo.  They are my all-time favorite cookies!

I really liked this recipe.  I did NOT melt the shortening, and they turned out great (what an odd thing to do).  Also, I didn't use a teaspoon of cloves, yet the flavor was still a little too prominent.  Next time I would just use a pinch.  I loved that they stayed soft and chunky. I hate flat cookies.  They have a really nice flavor.  Good recipe!

I was having a large crowd over and decided to make these.  They did NOT go over well with anyone.  Everyone found the flavor way to strong.  If you really LOVE molasses you will like these. 

Even though no human cared for them my 2 HORSES loved them!

Absolutely delicious. The only change made was to substitute 1/2cup of butter for part of the shortening. I put these in holiday tins for my friends this year. Everyone raved. Thanks so much!

Oh, My Heavenly Lord!!!!!! These are fantastic cookies!  My three year old son woke up at 1:00 in the morning and couldn't go back to sleep so I decided to let him "help" me make cookies.  The recipe was so simple and he had a blast helping daddy make cookies.  I didn't refrigerate the batter for the instructed 3 hours.  Instead I formed the balls and let him dip the cookies in the sugar and baked them right away.  our first batch was done by 2:15.  I let him have some milk and a cookie (because you have to sample the fruits of your labor).  He was as happy as a clam then he went right to sleep.  When the rest of the family wakes up in a few hours I think they are going to skip breakfast and go straight for the cookies.  They are Phenomenal.  I will be baking these every holiday season and also in between.  Thanks Karin you are a wonderful person for sharing this recipe.

These are ginger sugar cookies! So SO good, who would of ever thought two of my favorite cookies in one.  We did not put them in the fridge at all, and they baked nice, were easy to work with, they did not crack like the pic though and we are wondering if that is why.

I make them at Thanksgiving and Christmas and they go like hotcakes!I also make them for my fellow castmembers each time I work on a play or film.  They're sinfully addictive so watch out!  Canadian Thanksgiving is this Monday... I'm going to make a double batch this year  :)  P.S.  Chill them for 8 hours at least, they're way better that way!

Amazing!  Turned out chewy, beautiful and delicious. Definitely watch the time as other reviewers suggested. They don't look done at 8 minutes, but they are.  They flatten out nicely once they cool off a bit.

Super easy, my hand just got tired from mixing.  The dough is thick.  This cookie is sweet and has just the right amount of spices.  My kitchen was infused with the smells of cinnamon and ginger.  This cookie emobdies the holidays so I am glad I found this recipe.  I baked these for only 9 minues only.  They came out chewy and were perfectly crackled on top (i love that look on cookies).  They are definitely going to be on my Christmas baking list.  I also stored the extra dough in the freezer and it kept well for a week.  TIP: If you over bake your cookies so they hard and not chewy, don't throw them out.  Crush them up for an ice cream topping or they can be layered in a trifle!

I don't sift and only chilled for an hour. I also microwaved the shortening in a glass bowl rather than heat over the stove. They turned out perfect, including the crackles!

I'm not a big fan of molasses, but these were very good. You have to put them in a container or baggie with some bread immediately after cooling or they will harden very quickly. Yummy, and they look fantastic with red and green sprinkles!

The dough mixed well and the cookies had a nice, crisp texture.  They also had a rich molasses flavor.  I'm very happy with this recipe.  I followed it exactly, and I would make this again.

Delicious, simple cookie! I used 1 cup shortening and 1/2 cup of butter. There is no greasy taste. I only refrigerated the dough for an hour. Because I have soft and crisp cookie lovers in the house, the first batch was baked exactly 8 minutes for a soft chewy cookie. The second batch was baked for 10 minutes which made for a crispier cookie. For the spices, I used a Saigon cinnamon and allspice instead of cloves. These cookies just need a couple of minutes to cool when coming out of the oven and they are ready to go! (Even kids like them!)

The taste is phenomenal but I only baked them for 7 minutes at 350, could be my oven is a little hot though. I wasn't thrilled how flat they turned out but the taste sure made up for that. They started out very crispy but I read somewhere that if you put a slice of fresh bread in the airtight container with the cookies, they stay moist...it worked so well! I changed the slice of bread daily (it's been three days) and they are still nice and soft. I'm big on soft cookies but if it weren't for the bread, I think they'd be more crispy/chewy like some people would prefer.

These were great.  I didn't melt the shortening though.  I just creamed sugar and shortning and then added my eggs and molasses.  Then all of dry ingredients went into the bowl.  I just rolled them right then without refrigeration and it was just fine.  They crinkled just like they were supposed to. I made my own colored sugar by mixing 5 drops of food coloring into about 1/2 cup white sugar.  Much cheaper than buying that stuff at the store and they looked great.  This recipe only made 5 dozen cookies for me and they weren't super huge or anything.  A keeper for sure!

Not so good.  They looked pretty as the pick, but now that I use less shortening in my cooking, I was overwhelmed with shortening.  They dried a bit too crunchy and I took them to a cookie walk today and they were among the leftover cookies.

I've haven't had these cookies since I was a kid and ABSOLUTELY LOVE this recipe.  I followed the recipe without alteration.  I've been teaching my 8 year old daughter how to cook and when we made this recipe, I made her smell each ingredient.  Each time she would turn up her nose and say "YUCK!"  When the cookies were done she tried one with trepidation and quickly shouted "I love these!"  I usually let her experiment with the last bit of dough and she made a ball the size of a raquetball.  We flattened it slightly to about 2 1/2" in height before cooking.  It turned out to be a great big saucer sized chewy cookie.  WOW!  I might make the whole next batch that way to reduce the labor.  ENJOY!

Very good cookie, spices mild and just right. Agree with the baker who said to NOT substitute butter for the Crisco. Unless of course you want a flatter cookie. I do not feel it improves the flavor to use butter, and it changes the consistency quite a bit. I've done both ways and prefer the Crisco. Have no idea why you would melt and then let resolidify.

Yummy!!  Perfect exactly as is, left them in the oven 8 minutes, they were still soft, but I transferred them directly to a cooling rack and they turned out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and just sooooo yummy!!  Great recipe, definitely a keeper!!

These were ok, pretty strongly flavored but that's not the recipe's fault.  I used margarine as the recipe stated and they really flattened and spread out.  Still chewy but pretty disappointed with them.  Of course, I took them to work, and they were all gone in 10 minutes, although I believe they would eat shoe leather if they thought it was home made!  Anyway, probably won't be making these again.

Exceptional! I use butter and they are always a hit. The only extra thing I do is gently press them with a fork before baking - just for looks. I agree with other reviews, it is very easy to overcook them - they are best chewy. Delicious!

These cookies are amazing! We rolled them in just plain granulated sugar. I think I may get some cane sugar next time, so it will leave the big granuales on the cookie. We baked these as Christmas gifts this year, and everyone was sad they didn't get more.  These were a huge hit! They smell a bit like gingerbread, but they don't really taste like gingerbread. And people who don't like gingerbread were eating the heck out of these!!! I highly recommend them. Their simple, and SUPER tasty. :)

Made these for Christmas for the first time. I didn't roll in coloured sugar, like the picture, so they looked just like an ordinary molasses or ginger cookie. My sisters said they rivalled my Mom's time-tested ginger cookie recipe which is a huge compliment. Don't overbake!

These are the best cookies ! Because I had to use what I had on hand, I adjusted the recipe alittle.  I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1 cup crisco shortening and used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup light brown sugar...they turned out so good ! I wrote down my alterations and will make them like this all the time. My husband LOVES them !!!

These cookies are absolutely delicious.  I actually used sorghum because I had no molasses.  The cook time in my oven was a little longer.  If you do get them a little crunchy, the bread trick works wonders.  These are a must-make!!

I made these for my holiday book group/cookie exchange and they went over very well.  Used exact ingredients with no changes.  Unlike some reviewers, my cookies did not taste like fried fish although I may try the butter-flavored shortening next time just to see the difference.  Some notes...(1) I cooled the melted shortening for 10 minutes before adding the rest of the wet ingredients to it.  Beat it with a hand mixer on high for 1 minute before adding it to the bowl with dry ingredients.  Mixed wet/dry by hand.  Portioned and plastic-wrapped dough in thirds and chilled for 1 hour in the freezer to save time, working with one-third at a time.  Cook time was perfect, averaging 9 minutes for most (they will look undone but don't overcook).  Cookies will flatten after cooling for a couple of minutes on the baking sheet...don't try to remove them to a cooling rack until they rest for a minute.  Drizzled confectioner's sugar icing with a fork over half the cookies to add some variation to the platter.  Great with coffee or tea!

I'd never eaten molasses cookies before, let alone baked them, so this is a new 'flavor' for me - and as far as the flavor:These cookies are really good in a 'different' or 'holiday' way (I'm not able to eat more than 2 at a time, and I probably won't bake but once a year).  As far as the smell while baking:  Wonderful!  My home definitely has that 'holiday baking smell' that no candle can replicate.  CHANGES I MADE:  I was leary of the 'greasy cookie conundrum' that some other reviewers talked about, so I used 1 cup margarine, 1/4 cup butter flavor shortening, and 1/4 cup butter. My cookies turned out perfectly, without a strong butter flavor nor were they greasy.  CHANGES I WILL MAKE NEXT TIME:  I will cut the sugar back by 1/3 cup, because my taste buds felt like the unique flavor and spices were competing with the sweetness, and I think the sweetness should be a little less than, say, a chocolate chip cookie as this is a spice cookie, to me.  (I've eaten sugar cookies that were less sweet than these, so I do think it's for sure too much sugar.)  I give 5 Stars because I think it's a fantastic recipe to build on, and it's a fantastic treat for the holidays that is 'special', not just another sugar cookie.

Loved these! Daughter said they are like a cross between pumpkin pie, gingerbread and snickerdoodles. Used few reviewers suggestions & made using 1 c shortening and 1/2 c butter. Also, 1 cup sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. Did not melt shortening and butter but creamed together. Did not chill as other reviewers suggested, however ended with a flat cookie. The texture and taste are wonderful! I will try chilling dough next time. May produce a thicker cookie. Edit: These did have great flavor but they turned crispy very quickly (once completely cooled) even if I placed them in airtight container while still warm. We prefer a chew cookie so I will try making some alterations to see if I can keep the wonderful flavor but get the texture we like.

I've seen this recipe for a few years on allrecipes, but bypassed it mostly because it didn't have any chocolate in it (what's a cookie without chocolate?). I was looking for something different this year and remembered this recipe in my box. I tried it, and it is so fantastic, I could have been enjoying this recipe for years...why didn't I TRY it?? The cookies are chewy, flavorful and so delicious--even without chocolate!

There is a reason why there are so many FIVE star ratings on these....fast, easy, foolproof, tasty. If it doesn't fit all those criteria, it's not a cookie I make. Also like that you can break up the task into two days--make batter one day, chill overnight, proceed the next day. I used Spectrum "transfat free" vegetable shortening b/c my granddaughter is allergic to dairy butter. I followed the recipe to a "T" just cutting back a little on the cloves. With the strong flavor of the spices, you don't miss the butter. I wouldn't change another thing. There's a batch in the oven right now.

Good. Took advice from other reviewers and cut back by 2 TBS. molasses, exchanging for maple syrup. Added vanilla.

One of the best cookie recipes i've ever found. They come out so chewy and have just the right amount of spice.

These taste awesome.  I like the fact they are chewy and not so hard.  Not too difficult to make either.

These cookies are so delicious and go great with egg nog during the holidays.  You really do have to cook them for 10 minutes exactly.  The first batch I made didn't look done enough, so I left them in longer and they came out too hard.  The second batch was perfect at 10 minutes.  The dough makes plenty of cookies - I am still eating them and it's January already (of course that's probably because I've kept most of them for myself!).

These were a great old fashioned Christmas cookie.  The first batch blew up my mixer! (but that could be because it was about 30 years old!!) This was a hit at my parent's house because nobody in my family makes this type of cookie. This was a very simple, clean tasting cookie and I will be making it for years to come.

I seldom review things, mainly because if I reviewed every recipe I use from this sight, well, that's a lot of typing!  This recipe is easy and delicious...my favorite cookie so far this year!  Thank-you so much Karin, I made it exactly as written, although I was *so* tempted to add nutmeg, now, I'm glad I didn't!

These are AWESOME!  I couldn't stop eating them as they were coming out of the oven.  Even my husband liked them.  I followed the ingredients exactly.  However, I didn't chill them first - just mixed, shaped and baked.  I did roll in the green & green sugars for the holiday.  And, I though soft cookies would be better, so no more than 8 minutes.  Wonderful & will be a lifetime keeper!!  Thank you for sharing.

I was disappointed with these cookies.  I followed the recipe completely and while they do taste good, looks are another story.  I was hoping to make these for the holidays, but they are not very presentable.  I did not get the look in the photo, but more of a flat, thin cookie that resembles dirt.  the green sugar did not really show up at all.  Anyway, I do think that they are quite tasty, just not pretty.

OMG!  These were wonderful!  The only change I'll make next time is 50/50 butter/shortening, 50/50 white/brown sugar and an additional 1/4 cup of molasses.  I really love the taste of molasses so I used dark or robust unsulfured molasses.  Thank you for such a great taste!

We enjoyed these. They taste like the holidays lol. I bought gourmet vanilla bean sugar and rolled them in that. When they came out of the oven they were sparkling and glistening. Very pretty to look at. The vanilla in the sugar even came through a little bit...and u could see the black flecks from the vanilla bean.

I dipped these in colored sugar for Christmas, and they were quickly gobbled up.  I made the dough and then refrigerated it for 2 days before I got around to baking them.  Baked for 9 minutes for slightly chewy cookies.  Will definitely add to the cookie rotation.

I am partial to butter, and I hate ginger/cloves, so I made a few substitutions: substitute 1.5 cups butter for the shortening, substitute 1 tsp. nutmeg for cloves and ginger (as in, 1 tsp. total in the recipe, not 1 tsp. each), and because of the butter I added an extra egg in case the cookies turned out too crispy (so 3 eggs total in recipe). AND because I was silly and didn't read one line of ingredients, I left out the baking soda the first time around. =P I also only chilled the cookies for about an hour, so they weren't really crackly on top after baking. Overall, the cookies turned out PERFECT and everyone loved them. I baked for about 10 minutes and they came out a little underdone in the middle, but after a night in an air-tight container, the cookies dried out nicely but were still chewy. I rolled some in red sugar for the holidays but left others plain and they were equally delicious. Everyone loved them, and I'm making them for 3 different parties this Christmas! They're a really nice chewy sugar-spice cookie, especially for the holidays. I will definitely be adding this recipe to my cookbook.

Wow! This is going to be my go-to molasses cookie recipe from now on. I made these for a molasses cookie fan and he thought they were amazing. I'll admit that I've always thought the store bought kind were not so good and have never really tried homemade molasses cookies before. But I would now rate this type of cookie very highly. I followed the recipe exactly using organic unsulphured cane molasses. Baked for 9 minutes after 3 hrs chill and another batch overnight. Both tasted great! Even better with milk. Best fresh out of the oven but stayed soft on the inside for a little over a day in plastic zip loc bags.

These are the BEST cookies of this kind I have ever made! My husband doesn't usually like molasses or gingerbread type of cookies/cakes, but he loved these! The recipe didn't state whether to use dark or light molasses, so I opted for the light. They were fabulous! They stayed moist & chewy for over a week in an air-tight container. Not one went to waste...trust me! Next time I will take a bunch to church to give away so I won't eat so many! I followed the recipe as written & they were awesome. Be sure not to over bake them. Eight mins. was perfect when I left them on the cookie sheet for 1-2 min. after taking them out of the oven. This is a keeper! YUMMY!!!!

I'm a country boy from Kentucky and grew up with homemade molasses cookies. All I can say about this receipt is OMG!! I used butter for the shortening and pure Kentucky sorghum molasses (made at Oberholtzer's Sorghum Mill in Liberty, KY). The cookies have a wonderful buttery, rich, spiced flavor, slight crunch on the outside and moist, chewyness on the inside. When I bit into the first one, I quite frankly had a flashback to my childhood.

This recipe is going to be a part of my annual Christmas collection from now on!! Thank you Karin for this fantastic recipe!!

Wow. After biting into these, I was literally speechless! I was a little hesitant to try this recipe, since I had some bad luck with a Martha Stewart Molasses cookie, and saved this for last of my holiday baking. I wish I had made the full batch! 8 minutes was too long in my oven, so I compromised at around 7 and 1/2 minutes. I rolled them in green and red sugar (the more the better), and they came out crispy outside and chewy inside. I omitted the cloves and used 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, instead. I did have to flatten the cookies, since they did not spread in the oven. These are definitely going to be the first of my holiday baking from now on! Don't wait to try these cookies!

Delicious cookie! I mixed the ingredients as I had something else baking in the oven and chilled it in the fridge overnight and they were quick and easy to bake up in the morning. I didn't change a thing and they are wonderful! They are soft and nicely spiced. Not really a cookie that most kids would like though.

These are great!  I agree with one viewer, you need to chill the dough overnight.  The cookies are a lot better the next day. Thanks!

Can I give these 6 stars? If you like these cookies, then you LOVE them. They are sweet and a bit "spicy". More adults than kids like these cookies, I brought them to a trio recital reception and people raved about them. Different too, from most of what you'd find on a dessert table. Sort of distinguished...   Yummy yummy, will make them again!

These cookies were delicious!  I made them at Christmas and they were moist, but not too soft. My whole family loved them, and they made the house smell even more like Christmas.These spicy cookies will become a holiday tradition in my home!

This recipe is perfect!  It tastes similar to a gingerbread cookie with a much better texture, and without all the work.

Superfantabulous cookie.  They reminded me of my Grandmother's cookies.  Cook a little longer and get a crisp hard cookie or take out a little early and get a chewy cookie.  I kept the dough in the frig and we had warm cookies all through the week.

I loved these cookies. I made a couple of changes based on comments;
- reduced the recipe down to 36 cookies.
- used butter because shortening is nasty.
- did not cool the rolled dough in the refrigerator.
- just a slight sprinkling of sugar before cooking.
- took the cookies out of the oven a little less than 10 minutes.
Result, awesome cookies. thanks Karin!

Made these Xmas morning! Perfect!!! I used butter instead of crisco ...and lessened the receipe to only 1 and 1/2 dozen!! 72 cookies is way to many....Also kept in oven half the required time! They stayed soft and chewy that way which was great! :)

This is my absolute favorite cookie recipe. I have made them over and over and they are perfect every time. They are crisp and crackled on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside, spicy and warm, just sweet enough.
My changes: I use butter instead of shortening. I melt the butter, then cream it together with the sugar and molasses for about ten minutes, until the mix is light brown and fluffy. Then I add the eggs, then I add the dry ingredients.

I thought the recipe was great!  I used half butter and half crisco.  As a professional cook, I make cookies every day.  Parchment paper or silicon (sil-pats) are a must for any baker.  Also invest in some small scoops to insure uniform size.  I didn't chill the batter it wasn't too sticky and dipped the tops in sugar after scooping.  I did press them down a bit with my fingers after the test batch were a little small.  Baked for 10 minutes and they were nice and soft.  Cooling on a wire rack is needed as they are a soft cookie.  I will use this recipe again.  Always make a test cookie and adjust (flour/temp/size) if you aren't getting the results you like.

I have made these cookies for years. My mother gave me a brochure from a Gold Medal flour sack dated 1939 that has the recipe on it. Some think it is a new creation but it sure isn't! At our house they disappear in short order.

Just like mom made!  This is the same recipe that has been handed down in my family for years.  These are delicious, are great for taking to outdoor events as they don't melt and they freeze perfectly.  Love to have some in the freezer to whip out for unexpected guests - everyone always loves these!

I really liked the taste of these, however mine were not soft :( They didn't burn or get over brown in anyway, but I wonder if I should have taken them out a minute or two sooner...I do plan on trying again though because the taste was great! I also didn't have cloves on hand so I used allspice instead.

These cookies are awesome!  The perfect mix of chewy and crispy and just the right amount of spice.  I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening, 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, and subbed allspice for the cloves since I am not a huge clove fan.  I skipped melting the shortening and just creamed it with the butter and sugar and they came out fine.  No need for the extra step.  THe dough also freezes beautifully.

First, my husband and two children liked these.  I love molasses and felt it needed more molasses.  But, I also followed other reader suggestions and added 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown.  I wanted these larger than the palm of my hand so baked them for 16 mins at 350.

Excellent, and so easy!  I've made these several times.  TIP: I did everything in just one bowl - microwaved the shortening to melt it, and while it was cooling I got out the other ingredients.  No sifting - just chucked everything in together and stirred.  They get tastier over the next couple of days... if they last that long!  For me, I made WAY more cookies than the serving size states, and I was carefully following the directions.

Love this cookie, tasted and looked store bought which made me seem like an excellent cook :)  I added a little more ginger for more spice.  The (6) step in the recipe really helped out alot, because the ingredients made soo much cookies so it was a great way to keep them tasting fresh.  Perfect.

Great recipe! Impossible to eat only one :)  I used butter instead of shortening and did not chill the dough, they still came out delicious. I also topped the cookies with granoal and dried fruit for a unique twist. Try not to overcook the cookies, they bake really fast. I´m definetly making these again.

I made these cookies just as the recipe directs.  I did use crisco rather than butte because I knew they would be softer, chewier with the lard.  I added these to my own Christmas cookie tray with all my traditional cookies.  These were such a hit.  My family, friends, and myself all feel this is one of the best cookies EVER.  So happy to have this recipe.  Thanks for sharing it.

I made these exactly as the recipe stated, and they turned out fantastic.  I was afraid they would turn out too gingerbread-y with the molasses, but they were perfect sugar cookies.  My suggestion - don't alter a thing!

Be careful about the bottoms burning, especially if you roll in sugar.

Holy Cow!  These are fantastic!  I made a half batch, which made about 50 cookies.  Definitely stick to the 8 minute mark like others have said.  Fabulous!

These cookies are the best. My daughter made them for school and all of the teachers loved them! I accidentally left the salt out of one of my batches and it didn't make a big difference. I love these cookies and will make them often.

i had some difficulty with the dough, i refrigirated in air tight container over night as suggested and the dough was very very dry couldnt even form balls so i ended up adding 1 third cup softened margarine to it, i suggest chilling for about an hour only. still couldnt roll it, defently not a recipe to use cookie cutters. despite the dificulties, the finished product tastes amasing definitly 5 stars despit the difficulties

I thought these were great and have added them to my yearly Christmas cookie favorites. I didn't change any of the ingredients. I did put the batter in the refrigerator to harden a little before rolling them in the sugar. They turned out beautiful.

Just the right amout of sweet/spice. Wish I had made another batch for myself !  Only one complaint, though...the recipe was made exactly, and I refrigerated the dough for 3 hours. But the dough was sandy and I had to mold it into balls.

I recently made these for a cookie exchange.  Almost immediately I was asked for the recipe from a woman who said her children loved them.  My wife and her mother both love these and they are rapidly becoming one of my favorite holiday cookies.  The only changes I made was to melt the shortening in the microwave on a reduced power setting and I baked them on parchment paper lined cookie sheets.

Loved them! I had never eaten or baked molasses cookies before, but I was looking for a warming Christmas cookie. These are delicious and beautiful when rolled in sugar! I followed the recipe exactly, other than refridgerating - I didn't, and mine didn't even come close to being flat, and they were still really easy to handle. Will have to stop myself from making these all the time!

Excellent. Made per the recipe and they came out wonderfully. My oven is a little off so they needed to be in for 13 minutes. But they were just the right combination of chewy and crunchy. Kind of like a spiced snickerdoodle.

These are DELICIOUS! I just made them for the first time and have decided to add them to my Holiday cookies rotation. I found Gold sugar at the supermarket and used that to roll them and BOY are they pretty.  Very easy to make. Might try to use butter instead next time since I dislike shortening.

I didn't know how it would turn out when I was making the dough...it smelled so good while I was baking!  I tried one and couldn't stop eating them--it tasted just like ginger snaps with softer texture.  If you liked ginger snaps, then you will like this:)

Perfection; I didn't change a thing. I used a Pampered Chef scoop, the medium-sized one, and baked 9 minutes, making 52 chewy cookies. Absolutely wonderful and I will use this recipe forever.

These cookies are VERY TASTY!!!!!!!!....I was looking for something similar to the ones Tim Hortons has at christmas and these are pretty darn close!!....Not over powering in flavour, nice and soft, easy and quick to make.   I did replace the shortening with salted butter (that's all I had) and just let it all sit in the fridge overnight instead of just 3 hours and they came out just find!...A little hard to work with at first but worked out good.  I used a 25ml spoon to make my cookies even in size and once on the cookie sheet I pressed them down a bit with the palm of my hand, turned the cookie sheed around half way through baking and took them out just after they start to 'crack'...I lightly touched them with my finger, if they were semi firm I took them out, cooled on the counter while I put the next batch on the sheet and in the oven then transered the cookies to a air tight container.  I also sprinkled some natural sugar ontop of some before popping them in the oven!...Definelty a recipe to keep and make again!!!

I make these every year, for the last three years! I found a shortening alternative (Earth Balance) that doesn't have mono glycerides. I don't know if this recipe makes 72 I feel ilke it makes less. For some reason I dont' keep track. i will be doubling up this year!

Amazing and so easy to make. 10mins was the perfect time in oven. I left in fridge overnight and it was a bit hard to work with the next day. My husband who doesn't like cookies LOVED these!

These were great! Nice and chewy, and the taste is really pleasantly spicy.  Followed the recipe exactly, except I used butter flavored shortening. except I only chilled the first batch for 1.5 hours.

These cookies are amazing!  Not a huge fan of molasses myself so I substituted Maple Syrup.  They are perfect now...nice mild flavor.

These came out great!   Used butter instead of shortening & stuck with the 10 minute cooking time.  Very good!  Will make many more times!

Very good. Didn't have cloves but still tasted good without. Let cookies sit on pan for a minute so they stiffen up slightly making them easier to remove and transfer to cooling rack. Will definitely make again.

I loved these cookies.  So did hubby.  There is a reason my mom was a great baker.  She was more chemist in the kitchen than I am, but I am more artist in the kitchen than she (and reverse our strengths for our professions).  Anyway, I made these cookies today and misread and added 1.5 sticks of butter instead of 1.5 cups of butter.  I thought the dough was awfully stiff and really had quite a time mixing the sandy clumpy mixture.  But, after cooking (and I added about 2 minutes onto the cooking time and also mashed them down a bit), they are crunchy outside and chewy inside.  My bad but they really turned out beautifully.  Oh, also added some vanilla and exchanged nutmeg (fresh) for ground cloves which I didn't have.  A very delicious mistake!  I will make them again, mistaken measurement included.

They are great if you make sure you have the exact amount of cloves otherwise they have a HORRIBLE aftertaste. The first time I made them, I had put them on tin foil, and I flattened them before I baked them, which was a HUGE mistake, because when I took them out of the oven, they were stuck to the tinfoil!

I'm not sure why but my cookies turned out like flat little pancakes. Not the most appetizing to look at but absolutely delicious flavor. I followed the recipe exactly so I'm not sure what happened, but I'm still taking them to parties because they taste great!  Probably won't make them again though.

these cookies are soooo good.  use ingredients exactly as called for, and you can't go wrong.  personally, i think the colored sugar in the recipe photo degrades this very delicious (for adults as well) cookie.  just use plain white sugar unless you're making them for kids.  also, i do not grease the cookie sheets, and have no sticking problems.  10 minutes is perfect.  a fabulous and most requested holiday cookie!

Delicious & pretty! Halved the recipe for exactly 36 cookies. We enjoyed them & also gave a tin-full to family, so I should have made the full batch! We haven't gotten our fill! I used generous, heaping measurements of the spices & just love the flavor of these molasses cookies. We like them a little crispy, so the overall thickness and crunch of these cookies is perfect for us. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! Will be making another batch soon! :)

These are wonderful, easy cookies to whip up during a busy holiday season. They aren't as "strong" as straight gingersnaps or other spice cookies, but that's not a bad thing. I just made my first batch to take to work, and I'm sure I will make more throughout the year. I also only cooked for 10 minutes, they do look a little gooey, but cool to perfection!!

These are pretty much all I could ask for in a spice cookie. Everyone loved them!  I made the recipe exactly, other than replacing shortening for butter. Careful not to overbake! Mine took about 8-9 mins.

This recipe for Molasses Sugar Cookies is absolutely perfection!!! I halved the batch and it made a precise 3 dozen cookies. Following others suggestions I left cookies in for 8 minutes and removed for that they would be chewy! i will make these cookies again and again!

Perfect, and I give it 5 stars even if I switched out some ingredients (honestly, some people are too picky about that!) Half all-purpose, half whole wheat. Half white sugar, half light brown. Can't taste the whole-wheat, and brown sugar belongs. My picky 5-year-old son loves these. Served with pumpkin dip, too. Thanks for this recipe.

I actually am not a fan of molasses, so making these cookies was more for my family than me. Even though I don't enjoy molasses, I did find myself enjoying these cookies. I used a small grain sugar and also a larger grain sugar to coat the cookies with, both tasted yummy. My family raved over the cookies and they didn't last long, unlie most molasses cookies I've made in the past.

I'll give these a 4 because my husband and father-in-law absolutely loved these.  I'm not a huge fan of all things clove, cinnamon, or ginger so they were very strong in my opinion.  But I liked their softness.  This dough makes a ton.  I have lots of leftover dough in my freezer to make more in the future.

Delicious cookies! The cookies fell after I removed them from the oven. I used 1cup butter and 1/2 cup shortning so that may have been the cause. Still a wonderful tasting cookie! Thank you.

Recipe is a good one and the spices are right on.  However, this is not a DROP cookie.  I tried this receipe as alternate to the rolled ones I usually make and it wasn't until I read the receip all the way through that I realized it wasn't a drop cookie.  Also, no need to melt the shortening first and definitely mix 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar. Makes a huge difference.

I used 1 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening.  Great result.  The flavor is really nice.  Out of all the Christmas cookies I believe my family liked these most since they went so fast.  I wish they had not flattened quite as much while baking but they had a nice chewy texture and were super flavorful.  Nice coated with sprinkles for the holidays.

Getting rave reviews from coworkers.  Made many more cookies than the recipe indicated, but that's not a bad thing!  I used shortening and they do not taste oily.

I am a beginner cook who had to take cookies to an exchange party. These were so easy and were gobbled up. A friend gave me a tip for working with the molasses: spray the measuring cup and spoon with Pam first to prevent a mess.

Very easy.  The cloves, ginger & molasses added a different but nice flavor.  Everyone that has tried these so far have really enjoyed them.  Will definately make these again.

Every bite we had tasted like shortening. Almost like eating a french fry, fried fish. And I even was short a little on the Crisco so I used a bit less. I'm not sure what the point was if heating the Crisco either. The cookie also had an after taste  that lingered in the throat and made a tickle; not a pleasant linger might I add. I am wondering what went wrong?

The best molasses cookies ever! I only made one simple change, and that was instead of greasing the cookie sheet I used parchment paper. Works great and clean up is easy! Also, BAKE ONLY 8-10 MINUTES!!! Very important for soft cookies!

I have never made molasses cookies and thought I would give it a shot. Although I was startled by the amount of shortening and no butter, I am so glad I followed the recipe as written. These were a tremendous hit with all at my Yule party. Young and old were raving. They came out chewy and oh so good. Thank you, Karin!

Very, very good spicy flavor. My kids didn't want to stop eating the dough, they actually preferred it to the baked cookie. I just wish they would bake up a little thicker. I made 3 batches and each time they really came out very thin. This is a keeper recipe. Thanks!

Thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipe!  My search for the best spice cookie is over :).  Thanks everyone for the great, very helpful comments.  After a bit of trial and error, I just made a perfect batch by using room temperature butter (no melting) and mixing it right away.  I also didn't refrigerate dough before baking.  Tips that I discovered: keep the size of ball to walnut size like the recipe says (otherwise they can spread)- and 8 minutes is just about right to create perfect chewy cookies.  This recipe became a must in my Christmas baking!

I used butter and subbed brown rice flour for wheat flour for a fabulous gluten free cookie!  They were very moist when stored (tightly covered) with a piece of bread.

These are incredible. I made the dough last night before bed and then baked them today to freeze for a christmas cookie/christmas bread platter. I used half butter in place of all shortening.
I had to refrain from eating more than one they were so good. I rolled mine in different colored sugars, which I found at my local Grocery Outlet on the cheap, for a more festive look.

It's getting to smell a lot like Christmas. These cookies have a wonderful aroma while baking. I followed the directions and was rewarded by a perfect cookie. The spice blend, appealing texture and overall attractiveness earn them a spot on my favourite Christmas cookie list.

Wow. Cookies are nice and soft!  I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.  I like to roll them in superfine sugar (not powdered) and sprinkle a little more over the tops before baking.  Nice, crackled, sparkly appearance!  For me, it was 350 for 12 minutes, perfection.  Only 4 stars, though, because they weren't quite spicy enough.  Next time I'll add some fresh grated ginger for an extra kick!

These are the best cookies I have ever had. The kids went crazy for them!! My house smelled sooooo good. They are definitely better chewy than crunchy. I have already made these 3 times within the past week.

I've been making these cookies for several years now, and they are the absolute best! I'm constantly getting asked for the recipe. I wouldn't change one thing. Just a little tip to speed things up. I usually use the butter flavored shortening. Melt one cup in the microwave, then use one cube of butter.  Put the butter into the microwaved shortening and stir around until it disolves. This cools down the shortening so you're ready to go without waiting for natural cooling.

These cookies are FANTASTIC!!
I "veganised' the recipe so I could make some for my vegan best friend, who sadly misses out on most yummy christmas treats.
I replaced the shortening with vegan margarine, and using 2tbsps cornflour whisked with 2tbsps water for each egg.
My whole non-vegan family absolutely LOVED polishing off the left-overs too! hehe
Ill be making these every year from now on, theyre divine!

I just got done with my 6th batch of these this Christmas. Absolutely fabulous cookies! My final version kept everything the same, but:

~changed 2 cups of sugar to 1 cup sugar/1 cup brown sugar

~changed 1 tsp ginger to 3/4 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp cayenne

Notes I added: 

~cook em' till they crack slightly on top
~Store them as soon as they cool (dry quickly)
~don't skimp on the colored sugar. Buy a little larger sugar granule. If it is too fine it bleeds out on the top of the cookie making an already unappealing looking cookie, less appealing looking.

Allrecipes rocks! I love everyone's $.02, it saves me a ton of time, money and disappointment!

I tried these several different ways. I added 1 tsp orange peel and rolled them in red and green sugar.. the bottoms burned. Then I tried rolling them in brown sugar.. again.. burnt bottoms. Regular granulated sugar is the way to go! Cooking time was the hardest thing. 8-10 min is a bit too long, I put them on a higher rack in the oven and cut time to 6-7 minutes.. perfect! The orange peel works well with the spices in the cookie. Watch out for macking them too small, they get crispy faster. This was a trial batch.. but they taste wonderful! Will make again soon.

DELICIOUS!  I made the mix 24 hrs before baking as recommended - everyone in my family loved them and they looked so pretty!  I used mild flavored molasses, but next time I'll use full flavored for more spice.

Used real butter instead of shortening with perfect consistency results. However, the molasses flavor was very light and hardly noticeable. I will be adding more molasses next time.

This is the best molasses cookie recipe EVER!  I've made them several times, but I never melt the shortening.  I simply cream the shortening with the sugar, then cream in the molasses and eggs.  I don't sift the dry ingredients, either. I toss them in a bowl and mix well before adding to the wet mixture.  Also--at least for my oven-- the bottoms burn at 375. I bake them at 350 for exactly 9 minutes and they are perfect.

Edited:  At first I thought these were too spicy but found that they mellow with age, thus the extra star.  Neighbors approved and requested a batch of their own!  I almost never change a new recipe the first time out, but in this case I felt the need to make three:
1.  Melting and cooling the shortening.  I used half shortening and half butter (my own preference) and simply creamed with the sugar before mixing in the egg.
2.  Sugar:  Based on some of the reviews I used half dark brown and half white, hoping for a richer color than the photos.
3.  Baking soda:  Even after researching online and my textbooks from culinary school I couldn't justify 4 tsp soda, so I only used 1.
I used a medium size ice cream ice cream scoop and sprinkled sugar over each (no messy chilling and handling) and ended up with a chewy, crinkly top 3" cookie.  Texture aside, mine were overly spicy.  Next time out I'll cut back on the ginger because that was the most predominate flavor.
My suggestions for those who experienced "spreading":  1. double check how you measure your flour, keeping in mind humidity and altitude.  2.  use a heavy cookie sheet and parchment paper.  3.  always start with a cool cookie sheet (allow to cool in between batches or rotate between two sheets).

These cookies are amazing. Like others, I didnt heat up the shortning , room temp. worked really well. I also didnt chill the dought. So I skipped the longest steps and got to enjoy these cookies faster. I also didnt roll the dough in sugar (I forgot) but I dusted them with powdered sugar. Not only did they taste great they looked awesome.

These cookies had a wonderful taste.  I overcooked them, so some were a bit hard.  But, when you dip them in your coffee, they are like a biscotti!!  None going to waste here.

Why wait for the holidays for a great little cookie!  They were crispy and delicious.  I made the recipe almost exactly as written except I only melted 1/2 cup of the shortening then mixed it with the solid.  It worked well.  
The recipe makes a lot so I will be packing the dough in the refrigerator for later baking.  Otherwise, I'd just sit and eat cookies until they are gone.

Excellent cookie. Nice texture and soft if stored properly. I made the cookies a bit larger than directed and cooked 2-4 minutes longer. They turned out perfect and are a big hit at home and work.

Mine came out more chewy than crisp but they were so tasty.  Easy to make with that 'gingerbread man' holiday cookie taste but without all the fuss and bother. It was a very easy recipe which I followed exactly as indicated , no changes. Highly recommend.

Wonderful cookie! I followed several reviewers advice and used a 50/50 mix of white and dark brown sugar and it came out perfect. Be sure your spices are fresh and sifted and you can't go wrong. We had some milk chocolate left over and did a "dip" on a few dozen. They were the star of the show!!

The very best!  I occasionally bake cookies but not often...made up a half batch of dough before dinner last night and put it in to chill.  Up early and decided to bake before leaving the house.  Anyone who stopped in said it smelled heavenly.  Should have made a full batch!  Have to admit I did use half light brown and half regular sugar, but only because I had quite a bit of light brown on hand.  Now that we've made them once we'll stick with it.  Can't thank you enough!  Great recipe!

I give this 4 stars because I had to do some modifications. Instead of melting shortening and letting it cool, I used butter and creamed it with the sugar like most cookies. I then proceed to add the eggs and molasses and blend in the dry ingredients. When done like that they have a great taste and don't take any longer than any other cookie. One of my favorite cookies. Love them.

I loved this recipe. Don't be alarmed if your dough gets crumbly, after it is refrigerated it rolls up into perfect balls. I cooked it for less than the original time and it turned out better than I had hoped! I tend to make a lot of mistakes when I am baking, but with this recipe nothing turned out wrong. It's so simple!

I've made this several times for my boys and it quickly became their favorite. You have to keep a slice of bread in the container or they will harden. The only change I made to this recipe is that I added about a tsp. of vanilla.

Great flavors.  Cookies really had a ginger bite to them.  Make sure they are sealed or become hard quickly.  Microwave is also an easy fix to soften hard cookies.

Mine turned out like flat pancakes and I could not taste the spices at all and the sugar that I rolled them in disappeared when they were baked. I used margarine instead of shortening so not sure if this is the reason they did not turn out. I did not change anything else in the recipe. It seemed liked they needed more flour and they were really greasy. They were soft when they came out of the oven but turned hard and crispy when they cooled. I could eat them but my boyfriend couldn't.

It was a very simple and easy recipe, didn't sift any flour. Chilled I used the butter flavored shortening...not sure if it made a difference or not, but they are sweet and nutty and spicy! LOVE IT will be making these again next xmas time.

These flatten beautifully and end up very crinkly and pretty on a plate. I like the flavor as well; if you like spice cookies you will really like these.  Makes a lot.  Thanks for the recipe!

No lose cookie recipe! Have been making it for a few years now and it's awesome. An excellent make ahead dough. I roll it into logs and then freeze it. Then all I have to do is thaw and cut into rounds, sprinkle with medium sugar crystals and bake!

Delicious!  I made these without chilling the dough. Came out perfectly!  I used one cup coconut oil and 1/2 cup organic butter and with all other organic ingredients.  Cook exactly eight minutes at 370 degrees.

The taste is good, but the cookies looked nothing like the pictures.  No cracks, not puffy...just flat.  I under baked them (8 min.) to avoid a hard cookie, so they were soft.  I followed the directions completely so I don't know what went wrong?  I doubt if I will try this one again...I'll try another recipe instead.

Love these cookies!  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I did not melt the shortening.  I used it as is.  A nice soft cookie.

Will definitely make again. Only minor modifications - 1 c. shortening, 1/2 cup butter, and used 1:1 white:brown sugar. Didn't bother with the melt/cool step, just creamed together the shortening/butter/sugar like usual. Cookies are soft and chewy with a nice crust on the outside. Perfect.

Absolutely delicious! I used butter flavored crisco and I also had no molasses so I subbed honey instead.  I don't know what they taste like with molasses but I'm not a huge fan of molasses or honey for that matter.. but these were outstanding. The spices are dead on and the texture is awesome.  I'm going to use these for this year's cookie exchange and deliver them to some people for gifts.

8 minutes was perfect for baking. Clove was still very strong even though I halved it based on another reviewer's comments.  Easy to make, but I thought average taste.

I have never rated a recipe before but these cookies were absolutely phenomenal. I don't use shortening for anything so I substituted coconut oil (also needed them to be dairy free so I couldn't use butter) and they turned out so so so good. The molasses and spice in the cookie are strong enough flavors that you couldn't taste even a hint of coconut from the oil. I was a little confused as to whether I was supposed to flatten the balls of dough at all or not but ended up liking the result much better when I didn't. I baked them for 8 minutes as many other reviewers did and stored them in a ziploc bag and found them to still be soft and moist 3-4 days later. (Which is all the longer they lasted in my house)
I will be bringing these cookies to all of my holiday gatherings this year. As a matter of fact, I won't be allowing myself to make them unless they are for a holiday gathering because otherwise I'm sure I will eat the entire batch! Again!

Very yummy!!  Would definitely make these again!  Note:  To keep them soft and moist for more than a day, seal in an air-tight container with one of those clay brown sugar fresheners tucked inside.

These cookies are fantastic! I made them for a party in July and everyone loved them. These would also make a great holiday cookie. More than one person told me how the cookie reminded them of a kitchen during Christmastime.

These were very tasty!!!! My 2 year old kept stealing them off the cookie tray and hid in the corner so the dog wouldnt steal it from her. They freeze very well and when defrosted they are nice and chewy.

I made two batches of these and they were phenomenal.  This is my new Christmas cookie.  I used butter instead of shortening - but other than that I stayed true to the recipe.  Unfortunately - the first batch of cookies was pretty - big & chewy and then the 2nd batch was flat - but equally delish!!!  So I have no idea what I did - but both batches were awesome.  I did one sheet of cookies not rolled in sugar and my hubby and I agreed they were better with sugar.  Everyone keeps asking me to make more!  Great recipe!!!!

Made these on Christmas Eve.  What a fantastic recipe.  It's easy to put together and is absolutely delicious.  As other reviewers have mentioned they do bake very fast.  Mine were burning before it was even close to being time to be done.  My oven runs hot though.  The next batch that went in the oven I watched like a hawk and they came out very lovely.  What a nice blend of spices.  I'm glad I tried it.  It's going in my tried and true favorite family recipe book.

I was a little skeptical about this recipe, but only because I'm not crazy about this type of cookie normally. But, I tried it and they're GREAT! I followed the recipe exactly, except didn't add the ginger because I was out. They still tasted great. The only thing I don't like (thus the 4 stars) is that they get hard really fast! They're nice and chewy immediately after baking, but even though I stored them quickly, they were hard and crunchy within a day.

At first we thought the dough was too dry, it was tough to ball up. We ended up rolling and using christmas shaped cookie cutters and they were fabulous. Very popular in our house.

if you don't like the taste of molasses, don't make these or cut on the molasse. me personally do like the taste. it's not my favorite but for a change it's good. the sturucture of the cookie is wonderful. i did use the shortning not butter.

I make a recipe of my mother-in-law's called crackle top ginger cookies.  They have 3 tsp ginger, 1 tsp cinnamon and no cloves.  All the rest of the ingredients are the same.  They are wonderful cookies.  They have never failed me and make a nice big batch.  I am going to try them with this spice combination soon.  These cookies travel well as gifts at Christmas time!  I usually just chill the first part of the batch for about a half hour.  If the dough gets hard to work with, just pop it back in the fridge for a while.  You won't be disappointed with these cookies.

My dad went wild over these cookies! They taste amazing and are good both chewy and when they harden a bit (and they do harden over time). I baked exactly like the recipe said and they came out perfect! Will certainly be making again! Yum!

These were very tasty.  After I ran out of room in one container, I put several of them in a different container with some pumpkin whoopie pies I had made.  The ones stored with the whoopie pies were still soft the next day, but the other ones were not.  Could have been a less than ideal seal on the container.  I tried different sugars and preferred rolling them in turbinado sugar.  Nice big granules, a crunchy topping.

This recipe is identical to a recipe given to me by my best friend's mom about 35 years ago.  I have made them ever since...FABULOUS!  I will occasionally omit rolling them in sugar and instead, sprinkle with powdered sugar after they come out of the oven.  Wonderful with a cup of cider or coffee!

I just made these tonite and they are amazing! I went a little heavier on the molasses (just emptying my jar), and I did not chill the dough (no patience). I do have to say, I greased the sheet, but there is so much oil in these, that I think you could skip it. Incredible! I can't wait to enjoy one with a cup of coffee!

I made these for a cookie exchange party-and I won the best over-all cookie prize!  Hubby loved them too.  They do tend to spread so be sure to leave space between cookies and also 8 minutes was perfect!  Chewy deliciousness :-)

Awesome cookies! Only thing to mention is dough gets rock hard if chill overnight. Have to let sit out for a bit to be manageable.

These are fantastic!!  Very, very good flavor.  I used coconut oil instead of shortening, because even though it's still fattening at least there's some health benefits!  I also didn't have clove so I used allspice and it worked perfectly.  Yum.

These are delicious, its like eating a soft gingerbread man. And instead of rolling mine in sugar I put royal icing on top and they were even better. The perfect holiday cookie for the sweet in all of us.

Absolutely AWESOME recipe! The dough doesn't neccessarily need to be refigerated- I cooked a batch that was freshy made and they turned out great!  The refigerated dough was very crumbly and somewhat difficult to work with. However since my daughter is allergic to milk the absence of butter and/or milk made this even better!! Definitely would reccomend, and use often!  My picky 2 YO LOVES these!

Great cookie.  I noticed there was a dispute between shortening (which aparently has an oily taste) and butter (which gives the wrong consistency).  I decided to compromise and use a vegetable oil spread (margarine) which had the best of both worlds.  Make sure your oven is totally preheated, my first batch came out super mushy and did not get the "crackled" look affect.

Really, really good. Excellent chewy texture, lots of flavour, and just sweet enough.   My family prefers a really spicy ginger molasses cookie, so we'll add some more ginger and cloves the next time I make these, but the flavour is very good without any tweaks at all.

I've never actually rated anything on here before, but these cookies were so amazingly delicious, I had to come say something.  I have absolutely found my perfect cookie - followed the recipe exactly, baked for 10 minutes.    Exceptional cookies!  Archway has been displaced.

My family loved them! And it was the best molasses cookies ever! I used half shortening and half margarine, since I didn't have enough shortning on hands. It came out great though my cookies didn't get beautiful crackles. Also I baked for 10 mins to get chewy cookies. And 12mins to crispy ones.

These turned out wonderful! =) definitely going to keep this in my recipe book. 10 minutes I had a soft chewy cookie, 11 minutes I had a chewier cookie but still soft, I prefer keeping them in for 11 minutes, my friends and boyfriend loved them! I used unsalted butter instead of shortening and it was perfect. My friend who works for Starbucks say they taste exactly like their Molasses Cookies. Thank so you much for sharing.

All I can say is these are the best Molasses cookies I have ever eaten. They were the favorite this year at Christmas. I followed the recipe to a T. Thank you so much for the recipe Karin!

These were delicious. They went over really well at Christmas diner and potluck. I substituted butter for shortening and added a tsp of cardamom.

Wow, these were really soft!  Maybe too soft, in fact---I put a few cookies on top of each other on a plate and they stuck together and formed a big glob of cookie!  I used butter rather than shortening, so maybe that’s why.  I don’t use shortening though, so maybe next time I’ll add a bit less butter and see if that helps.  Tasty though!

Used butter instead of shortening since I don't like the taste of shortening or the unhealthy trans fats.  Other than that, followed this recipe to a T - eveyone loved it. Easy to make, moist and appreciated by all. Would be just as good without the colored sugar although they do make it look nicer. Thanks for the recipe.

These are fantastic! I made them a few days ago, and they are a hit with family and friends. It took longer than I expected to roll them out because the dough was so cold/hard, but worth it for the taste! Yum. I'll be making these again.

Not a single change and they are great!  The whole family is enjoying them.  I was worried about the shortening and considered substituting butter as other reviewers mentioned.  I'm glad I didn't though because they are perfect as written.

wonderful!  I realized after I had already started that I only had 1/2 cup of shortening so I went for the margerine.  Low and behold, there was only 1/2 cup of that too!  So I ended up using 1/2 cup shortening, 1/2 cup margerine and 1/2 cup butter.  Worked perfectly!  Really does make 72 cookies....possibly a few more and they are the PERFECT size!  Thank you!

Outstanding recipe.  Also read a lot of the reviews before starting, which helped me to customize the recipe.  I switched out the 1-1/2 cups shortening to 1 cup butter, half cup shortening and went a bit heavier on the spices so that the teaspoons were rounded.  My half cup molasses also ran a bit over but intentional as these were made for my best friend's gift basket and she LOVES molasses, spice and not too sweet a cookie.  This met all the criteria plus some.    I chilled the dough overnight and instead of greasing the cookie sheet I just used parchment.  I rolled them in Baker's professional grade fine granulated suger so the cookies just appear to have a shimmer of sugar and no crunchy grains.  I baked them at 375 as the recipe recommends and for 9 minutes exact as another reviewer noted. Any more and you will get crunchy, not soft, chewy.  My oven runs a few degrees cool, so if your oven runs spot on, I would stick to the recommended 8 minutes for a softer cookie.  Simply cannot gush enough.  This has become a part of my permanent recipe box and one I know I'll make over and over again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!  Robin Richter

These are great!  I couldn't find the recipe I always use that was given to me by my grandmother and I decided to try these thinking there was no way they could be as good.  They were excellent!  Will definitely make again.  Store well in a covered container with a piece of bread inside to keep moist.

These are a nice spice cookie...I used half white sugar, half brown sugar but otherwise followed the recipe.  I have used a similar type of recipe in the past which calls for raisins.

Really really good cookies!!  Moist, soft and Chewy!!  YUMMY!!  The only thing I did different is skipped the cloves (because I didn't have any, and really no one missed them!!) and used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar in the dough!  Delicious!!  Thank you!!

Never made molasses cookies before and was happy that these turned out great!  I had some come out flat, but I found that was because I overbaked them.  Make sure to check them before the time is up.

The taste was excellent.  The only negative I found was that I've made them a few times and some of the times they have come out of the oven and flattened out.  I did use butter in place of shortening and a mix of brown sugar and white sugar.  Even when flat, the taste was great.  I also refrigerated the

These were incredible! I made these for a cookie exchange and they were a huge hit. I had to make them again a couple of days later. I will be making these every year! I suggest taking them out of the oven a couple of minutes early and let them finish cooking in their own heat to get a chewier cookie, though they were really good crisp as well.

OMG!!! These cookies are the best.  I made them for my Christmas bags, and am now planning to make more because I keep going back for "just one more"  The recipe makes a ton, and makes the whole house smell awesome while baking.  VERY easy recipe.  I didn't use shortening, but butter instead.  Easy putting together, and the next day just scooped them out, rolled and in the oven.  You will keep this recipe in your recipe box.  A must!!!!

These were a huge hit at a party I recently had! I made the recipe as is, only using a cookie scoop to scoop the cookies before rolling into a ball and in the sugar. (Believe me using a scoop saves time and helps ensure your cookies are all the same size!)

I've never made Molasses cookies, however this recipe was extremely easy to follow and they turned out beautifully! I forgot to use a greased cookie sheet and it was fine. Also, I sprinkled some additional sugar on when they came out of the oven and they are perfect! Thanks for submitting this recipe!!! (They also make a ton!)

Amazing recipe. Subbed butter for shortening. seemed to work well. also, pressed down cookies into colored sugar to get them to look like the ones on the picture.

These are absolutely delicious and are the one cookie I enjoy both soft and crunchy. I didn't realize I was out of ginger so I finely chopped a few slices of crystallized ginger to substitute and I think they turned out even better that way.

I just finished baking a batch of these, was looking for something new to bake.  YUM!!!!  My husband wanted to know what the wonderful aroma was.  You definitely need to keep an eye on while baking - one tray came out a bit crispy.  8 minutes was perfect for here in CO at 6,000 ft.!

I followed this recipe exactly and rolled the cookies in red and green sugar for the Holidays. Huge hit! My husband and I, along with the people we shared these with, are hooked. *Definitely keep these in an air tight container, as part of the appeal of these cookies is their crunchy outside and soft, chewy inside. Note, that if you freeze the cookies, they will return to their perfect consistency if you allow them to warm to room temperature first. 
Amazing cookies! I highly recommend adding them to your recipe box.

We JUST made these cookies a few hours ago for a party later tonight. We made them a bit bigger than recommended, and they looked great - half of the batch was made with red sugar and the other half was regular granulated. We didn't have the full thirty-six cookies because they were so much bigger, but we still couldn't resist trying one. Oh, goodness! If we hadn't used up the last of our flour, we'd have made at least one more batch just for ourselves! The great recipe presents wonderfully textured spiced cookies!

Try this recipe using butter-flavored shortening and substitute dark brown sugar for 1/2 of the total sugar amount. Really enhances the rich flavor. I also underbake them a bit for a nice chewy center and crispy outside crunch. My family's hands-down favorite !

This is a simple to make and delicious cookie. I followed the recipe completely with the exception of adding a bit of fresh ginger. I used baking stone which did not need to be greased and extended the baking time to 10 minutes. They turned out perfectly....pretty to the eye and delecious to eat.

I don't like molasses, but these cookies are awesome! I cooked mine for 10 minutes, and then froze them, as they were for Christmas & I made them 2 weeks ahead. They froze great! You couldn't even tell.

I thought this was very easy to make.  I forgot to cool the shortening and just added the other stuff and had a few bits of cooked egg, but I beat it more and it smoothed out and was fine.  Also discovered I did not have cloves or ginger, so I left those out and the cookies turned out great. Thanks.

Very good cookie and something a little different for Christmas.  These will become a staple for me during the holidays, smell so good baking too.  I used parchment paper for easy clean up and cooked 9 minutes.  I didn't chill the dough at all, was afraid it would become too dry.  But they still turned out perfect, mmmm!

A really yummy cookie!  7 minutes was long enough for baking time.  I also used parchment paper on my cookie sheets, which kept the bottoms looking nice.  Thanks for sharing!

Great cookie! I used whole wheat flour because it's all I had, and they turned out very well. I also used half white/half brown sugar, and since I didn't have all of the spices required, I used 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp cinnamon. Lastly, I rolled them in vanilla sugar before baking - delicious! I'll definitely be making these again! 
Oh yeah, and it's definitely not necessary to grease the cookie sheet.

Great cookies and so easy to make! I love the molasses flavor in them, perfect amount for me. The other spices blended in well too. I made my cookies a little smaller and got 8 dozen. I will be making these for a long time!

These were great. I did use brown sugar and butter-flavored shortening. I had to use 5T of butter since I ran out of shortening. I forgot to roll them in sugar, though. They look great and taste great.

Absolutely love these cookies- they are very soft and chewy and last for a long time- you can freeze them and they are super good to microwave for a few seconds to warm them up!  Make sure you remember to refridgerate the dough, I forgot about that step and these were the last cookies I had planned to make in a day and they should have been the first ones I mixed.

These turned out great.  I liked putting them in just a litte shorter to get them nice and chewy.  The only mistake I made was in making half a batch the first time, now I'm making another full batch!!!

Wonderful taste.  Did take me a while to get the hang of baking them to perfection - not too soft/underdone but not too crunch/overdone.  I finally got it right - baked them at 200C for 12 minutes.  Rolled them in the coloured sugar recipe from this site.  Well worth all the trial and error.  Will be making another batch of these soon.

I'm picky about cookies, and these are absolutely fabulous!  As earlier reviewers said, just the right balance of flavors and crispy/chewiness.  I rolled mine in a combination of red and green sugar, and chilled for 2 days before cooking! (ue to time constraints)

This recipe is unbelievable!  I love moist cookies, and these are the ultimate.  I decided to try these for a bake sale, and immediately got more molasses to make another monster batch for friends and family!
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Very tasty and easy to make; just allow enough time to chill the dough. I used "Grandma's Molasses" from the store. I froze the cookies and then used several weeeks later. They were still delicious!

Loved the recipe.  My issue is they were flat which maybe because I used butter instead of shortening.   Nice and chewy and soft even after a week!  Definitely a keeper.  Makes about 50 cookies.

To date I have made these multiple times. They are really good just the way they are, no changes made on my end. Followed directions to the letter. 

I personally don't belive you should rate a recipe after having made changes, especially a lower rating. Make as stated first to have accurate ratings but always take into account YOUR oven for time and temp. A Natural Gas Kitchenaid convection at 950 ft above sea level cooks a lot different then a GE Electic Oven at 7000 FT above sea level.

I used 1 cup butter flavored shortening and 1/2 cup butter, and 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup dark brown sugar to enhance the molasses flavor.  I didn't melt the shortening or butter but used it at room temperature, so I only refrigerated the dough for a couple of hours.  The cookies came out nice and thick and chewy, and they stayed chewy in an airtight container for at least 3 days.  My co-workers couldn't get enough of them.

I scaled the recipe down to half, so it made about 3 dozen cookies.  Based on the reviews, I subbed part of the shortening with real butter.  

The dough was very sticky but not too hard to work with once sugared.  final The texture is good- crispy around the edges and chewy in the center.  I ended up cooking them 12-13 minutes.  (I just bought this house so maybe I need to calibrate my oven.)

I would have liked them a bit spicier.  Perhaps their flavor will develop the longer they sit.  If not, I'd consider doubling them next time.

Fantastic! This has become our family's traditional Christmas cookies - we roll them in colored sugar instead of plain to make them extra festive! Btw, it works just fine if you don't melt the Crisco.  Seems like an unnecessary step to me.

Unbelievably delicious and perfect in every way! The amount of spices spot on! Very Important..... my first batch I baked for exactly 10min and still perfectly chewy the next day. The second time I baked them for 12min and they were a little dry the next day so DONT go over 10min In the oven. My husband is a huge fan of these molasses cookies and you will not find a better one! Oh I Also substituted the shortening with butter which tastes so much better!

Just made them, and they're tasty and perfectly chewy. I used ginger paste instead of ground ginger because it's what I had on hand. I was terrified they wouldn't come out right because the video says to use half the amount of shortening, but I'm glad I stuck to the original recipe.

I used margarine because I didn't have shortening, and it did not work! Shortening is essential. I saved them by adding almost 2 cups of flour but I came really close to ruining the batch. Even then, they were too soft to ball and roll in sugar but spoon drops made nice round chewy cookies that rose correctly. 
4 stars because the taste is awesome, but could use more spice.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE SO MUCH.

The only thing that I change is I use half butter & half shortening because I like my cookies to get a little thinner, and I only refrigerate the dough for like an hour because I'm too anxious to eat them. I like my cookies to be softer and chewy, so I just bake for 8 mins.

These cookies go FAST. I took a container to work today, and several people asked me for the recipe and said they taste like Christmas ??

Very good starting recipe. I added 1/2 tsp of butter flavoring and vanilla extract, as well as replaced half of the white sugar with brown. After rolling the dough in my palm, I pressed it down some and dunked the top in white sugar. I baked it for 9 minutes.

I used to have a recipe for molasses cookies and they were my daughter’s favorite. Today is her birthday and she doesn’t like cake but I couldn’t find my old recipe so I used this one. Delicious! She said they taste as good as what she remembered. So glad you shared this recipe! I halved the ingredients and it made 32 nice sized cookies.

These cookies are wonderful!  I will say that the "batter" is definitely crumbly, so be prepared to be firm in forming them into balls, and I did need to bake them a bit longer but... YUM!  And my kitchen smells amazing too!  Just the kind of cookie that I was looking for.

This was an awesome recipe! I did not make any changes other than I only refrigerated it for an hour to an hour and a half. I will absolutely make them again, probably this week they were perfectly soft perfect texture perfect taste. One of the best cookies I’ve ever made!

This is indeed the Betty Crocker recipe  from years ago.  I have been  making these for 60 years and they have always been one of my favorites.  This is the only cookie that all six of my grandchildren love.  They want them year round and love to help me make them.   The  only difference in my recipe is that it doesn't say to melt the shortening.  I dip the tops  in raw sugar and put three drops of water on each cookie to make the tops especially crinkly!

This recipe is perfect! It can also be adapted easily for gluten free and still tastes great. Add a bit more baking soda if using gluten free flour.

I used half lard and half butter, otherwise made it exactly as printed. Delicious cookies and everyone loved them.  Oh, I did add some chopped candied ginger, which was very good, too, but they would have been great without.  Makes a HUGE batch.

Great cookies. Fairly easy. Sift the dry ingredients together. I also finely dice up candied ginger and throw in. Everyone loves them!

I used 1 cup of shortening and 1/2 cup of butter.   I also baked exactly 10 mins, no more, no less , after the 3 hour hold in the fridge.  My husband flipped over these cookies.  They were soft and chewy, and wonderfully spiced.  What's really funny, I am not a baker!!

Super yum!  I swapped out 1/2 cup of shortening for butter and just softened both in the microwave and then followed the recipe from there.  I left the dough in the frig overnight and baked the next day. Easy and very very good. Will make again.

So good! They do get very large while baking, so be sure to allow 2 inches between dough balls.  These are Very sweet rolled in granulated sugar, but everyone loved the ones that I dipped the top into ice cream sprinkles and the bottom only in granulated sugar prior to baking. Great recipe, thank you!

Used part shortening and part butter, and they turned out awesome!  I wasn’t sure I’d like them, so I halved the recipe (which was super easy to do!).  Next time I will make the full recipe.  SO good.!  Thanks for a great recipe

Love this recipe!  The only 2 changes I made were I subbed butter for shortening and I like a little extra "kick" so I decided to add a pinch of cayenne pepper.  I think I'm going to add 2 pinches the next time - yummy!

This molasses cookie recipe is definitely going in my recipe book! The cookies turned out soft and yet crispy at the same time and had wonderful flavor. The only thing I changed was I rolled them in Penzeys cinnamon sugar before baking.

This is a great recipe!?? I definitely would double it if you are baking cookies for Christmas to give away or share. If you’re oven bakes hot, be sure to watch them closely, as molasses can burn quickly, you might consider lowering the temperature a bit if that is the case. Soft and chewy my family and friends love them ????

For this recipe I used one cup of butter and half a cup of shortening and I also did half white sugar half brown sugar and skipped the sauce pan all together. I creamed the sugars, butter and shortening together. I did add 2 teaspoons of vanilla then the eggs, molasses then dry ingredients and I did not refrigerate the dough. Just watch your cooking time and these will be the best tasting cookies you have ever made and nothing makes your house smell more like the holidays!

Fantastic recipe.  Per suggestions,  I used half white sugar and half brown sugar.  I used butter .    Because I started at 9 PM, chilling dough for 3 hours was not an option.  I used my cookie scoop, instead of rolling into balls and baked them for 7 minutes, since I wanted them to be soft.  They were a hit with the grandchildren and also the two pot lucks I went to this week.  I will definitely make them again.

I made these last year for Christmas following the recipe exactly. Everyone loved them. Today I made a half batch to test massive changes needed because I started the plant paradox diet. I used Natures Harvest Monk Fruit sweetener instead of regular sugar (I grind it in my Ninja as it has a tendency to return to granulated state after cooling). I used Thrive organic Cassava flour instead of all purpose flour.  I used Spectrum Palm Shortening instead of hydrogenated shortening. I used England’s Best omega 3 eggs, and I also added some Bob’s Red Mill Xanthan Gum per package instructions to make sure the cookies stayed cohesive. I increased the spices by 50% just to make sure the covered the cassava flour.  I did use Grandma’s Original Molasses just as last year, but will use organic blackstrap molasses on the next batch. Finally I coated in a mixture of monk fruit sweetener and cinnamon and baked the same. All I can say is Yum, Healthy Yum!

These cookies were a hit!  I made a half batch and they turned out perfectly.  The flavor was beautiful: not too sharp for the younger palates while being deep enough to please the grown-ups.   This is my new favorite molasses cookie and I will definitely start making them on a regular basis!

I made the recipe as written using some of the suggestions by other users.  My problem was after chilling the dough, I could not roll into a ball, ( I chilled it longer  that could have been the problem.)so I put it  in a 9x9 pan sprinkled a little bit of sugar on top and baked for about 15 minutes.  Turned out great will definately do this again.

This has become my next favorite cookie.  The taste, the ease of preparation, and the ingredients make this a wonderful cookie to add to my list of favorites.

Use the shortening. I added a little more spices, but that's just me. I did halved the recipe but based on my cookie size, I will be making the full recipe next time. I did have to squish my cookies before baking, but that could be my fridge and the weather outside. (That evening Houston got snow...) I would also make extra sugar mix (did the same as someone else and did a white and brown sugar mix) and top the fresh-out-of-the-oven cookies with it. Will so be making these again without a doubt.

I decided to use butter instead of shortening for this recipe, because I can’t stand shortening. It’s true that the cookies came out crunchier than chewy (still had a little bit of it), but everyone LOVED them this way. I chilled the dough overnight and pressed them down a little after rolling each into a ball, they came out perfect and flat. This one was a crowd pleaser. Will be making them again very soon. And I got exactly 72 cookies out of this batch.

I made this for a coworkers birthday and they turned out amazingly. As I was making it I ran out of all purpose flour and ended up using 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour. I thought the whole wheat flour would have over powered the taste but the cookies were amazing. I definitely will make this again.

This is a truly great molasses ginger cookie! I prefer to use butter for most of my cookie recipes however you will only get the cracks in these if you use shortening. I decided to do a mix of 1 cup butter and half cup shortening and they came out delicious with attractive cracks all over the top.

I used butter instead of shortening and these turned out spectacular.  I used parchment paper instead of a greased pan and the cookies slid right off.
Cookies were a big hit.  I will definitely make these again.

I am making these for the second time, because I love them SO MUCH!! The first time I didn't see how many cooies the recipe would make, and  I was rolling and baking for hours! This time I made 36 cookies. I add a 1/2 teaspoon more spices and use butter instead of shortening. I just microwave it the refrigerate for a couple minutes. So much simpler! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I’ve made these at least 6 times. Butter is better and sifting the dry ingredients doesn’t appear to change these terrific cookies.

My son and his fiancé loved these cookies!  I followed the recipe  exactly, and to keep the cookies from getting too crisp, I placed a sliced of white bread in my container.  Will definitely make these cookies again!

These taste amazing but they definitely did not come out flat like the ones shown in the picture.  Mine were little balls.  I'm not sure if I should have flattened them before I put them in the oven.  I followed the directions exactly as written and I'm an experienced baker.  Taste is wonderful!

I made this recipe  but omitted the cloves as I didn't want to make another trip to the store.  These  cookies were awesome, crispy edges and a soft middle.  Took these to a dinner party and had 2 requests for the recipe.  Definitely recommend this recipe!!

Fantastic cookies and family favorite.  I don't melt the shortening. I've used butter only for this and have also used mostly butter with a few tablespoons of shortening (to recipe measurement)...and these are great.  Sometimes I chill dough; sometimes I don't.  Delicious!

I made these over the holidays because ginger and molasses are not my favorites.   I figured I wouldn't be tempted to eat too many.  Wrong!   They are delicious.  I used the bread for freshness and it worked.  I'll try it with other recipes.  This is my new "go to" recipe.  i made no changes.  Delicious.

This is the type of cookie that ends up being a little hard within a couple of days. Try adding a piece of bread to the container and they will be soft for quite some time.

I will be making these again next Christmas.

Great taste. Make sure to chill long enough. Do not roll out and make gingerbread men with this recipe. It is truly a drop cookie recipe. Watch the cooking time, cookies burn easily. Ours was 8 minutes, no more. When done correctly they are a great cookie.

AMAZING! Moved this recipe right to the "make every holiday" list! I followed other reviews in using 1/2 packed brown sugar and half white. I also did NOT melt and cool the shortening, as I used a powerful mixer, and saw no need. One last thing to note, I used decorative sugar on some and regular granulated white sugar on others. No real noticeable taste difference, however, the decorative sugar definitely looked more festive!

Made some changes per other reviews included: did half brown sugar and half white sugar, 1C butter and 1/2C shortening.  I made these cookies traditionally without melting the shortening. I just creamed the sugars in the fat and then added the molasses and eggs beating well between the additions.  I let the dough chill in the fridge, made half the batch after 3 hours chilled and then the last bit a week later.  The last batch was as delicious.  I ran out of molasses so I ended up using a couple tablespoons of honey to make up the difference.  I'm not sure if that made these cookies extra special but man, these are perfect.  They don't last long!  Crispy bite turns into a gloriously chewy, perfectly spiced cookie.  As others have said, the spices in this recipe are spot on.

I made it exactly as the recipe says and they turned out fantastic!  I showed up at my inlaws with them for Christmas to surprise my mother-in-law and we got so tickled because she had made some too from an old friend's recipe. They looked and tasted exactly the same!

Use about 1/4 C more flour if you bake with butter (and it's much better if you do--oil is so blah). The cookie will come out nice and chewy with a crust. If you want a real snappy gingersnap, this is not the recipe.

Delicious! Per other reviews I did 1/2c butter and 1c shortening and added 2 tbsp of corn syrup.  Put in half the cloves and cooked for 8 mins. Perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely love these cookies. 
I use butter and blackstrap  Molasses.   Soften the butter just enough to blend with sugar ,molasses, and eggs.  Add dry ingredients.  Mix and chill.
I ship them to Florida for our sons family for Christmas every year.

ABSOLUTELY the best molasses cookies I've ever had, and I have loved this type of cookie for years. We baked ours a little longer than the recipe called for. Rolling in sugar gives creates a wonderful crispness. Whoever came up with this recipe nailed it!!

Phenomenal cookies! 10 minutes at 375 is a perfect baking time. I wouldn't change a thing about these cookies as I love the spice of a molasses cookie. I'll be making these time and time again!

This is the same recipe as grandma's molasses - molasses crinkle cookies. The only difference is less flour to make them soft. I made both and prefer the original recipe since it doesn't spread too much. Outside of that, this version is delicious! Just space your cookies so that they have room to spread. If you want to try Grandma' recipe: 3/4 C softened shortening, 1 cup light brown sugar, 1 egg, 1/4 tsp salt, 2 teaspoons baking soda, 1/2 tsp cloves, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger, 1/4 cup molasses and 2 1/4 cups all purpose flour. Yes, I listed the ingredients in the order that I mix them. 375F for 8 minutes - 12 minutes (I do 8 minutes and share

These are excellent spice cookies.  I've made them with shortening or coconut oil depending on what I have on hand, both work well.  I've never refrigerated the dough, and they always turn out great. The recipe makes a huge amount.  We make them every Christmas season.

These were delicious and the hit of the party.  I don't like using shortening, so I substituted 3/4 cup REFINED coconut oil (refined does not have the coconut flavor to it) plus 3/4 cup of butter.  The texture was perfectly soft and chewy.   You could use virgin coconut oil, which has a slight coconut flavor that doesn't bother me, but since this was for a party I didn't want to chance it.  The coconut oil helps to maintain the texture that you would get by using shortening.    I piped white chocolate snowflakes on top of the cookies to make them festive. Everyone raved about the taste of these cookies!  This is definitely a cookie I will make every year.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

While searching for a gingersnap recipe I stumbled on this molasses sugar cookie and it fit the bill. It is chewy on the outside, soft in the middle and has a nice balance of sweetness and spice. Will make again!

Used one cup crisco, half cup butter and one cup sugar and one 1/4 cup brown sugar. I only had 3/4 cup of molasses, so that's why I used an extra 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Awesome cookies!

This is an excellent recipe. My family and coworkers always rave about them. I got impatient so made a handful after letting them cool for just 3 hours and they were still good. They are soft in the middle and chewy/crunchy on the edges, which we really like.

I was 1/4 c. short on the shortening, so I used butter and it worked out fine.  I also did not melt/cool the oils.  I simply blended them in my stand mixer, then added the other wet ingredients.  I used Saigon cinnamon, which has a wonderful depth to it.  I didn't want to wait the required 3 hrs. to chill so I turned the dough out into a metal 13x9 pan and it chilled in about 45 mins.  I used my smallest ice cream scoop to drop the dough into a ziploc bag with Demerara (unrefined) sugar to coat, then onto parchment lined sheets ( I NEVER bake without parchment!).  They were lovely and taste wonderful.  I did realize trying to do two sheets on different racks at the same time resulted in the top pan having the nice crackled effect, but the bottom one was more smooth and not as attractive.  Even rotating the pans halfway through didn't do the job.  It took longer, but one sheet at a time worked best for the best looking cookie.  And just a minute or two extra baking time can make the difference between a chewy and crispy cookie.

These turned out great! They were the slightest bit flat though. We put some rainbow sprinkles on them and they looked beautiful. When making these make sure you don't let them overcook. We will most definitely make these again!

I have now made this recipe 3 times and every single time I was rewarded with wonderful reviews. We are decorating our Christmas Tree today and these are a perfect addition to the holiday spirit! Now for the changes I made: I used 1 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of coconut oil in place of shortening. Also, I did not want to wait 3 hours or overnight for the dough to stiffen, so I just popped them in the freezer for 3-5 minutes and they turned out perfect! I also liked the flatter shape the cookies made rather than the puffed up look they take on when you refrigerate them overnight. Lastly, I rolled them in granulated sugar for an extra crunch. These are a lovely spice cookie and keep well for about a week. Enjoy!

These are in my top 5 favorite cookies. This is a great recipe. As others have mentioned, watch the cooking time. They feel gooey, but they harden and cool quickly when you take them out. I live in high altitude, and would recommend cooking them for 10-11 mins. My dogs love them too!

Yum!  These are wonderful.  Read through many of the reviews first.  Made a 1/2 batch.  I doubled up on the molasses.  In my 1/2 batch I used 1/2 c. shortening and 1/4 c. butter.  A really buttery molasses cookie didn't seem right to me.  Used a medium sized cookie scoop and got about 27 cookies from the 1/2 batch.  Dipped the rounded tops in Wilton's White Sparkling Sugar Sprinkles and baked for 9 minutes.  Reminded me of my favorite molasses cookies by Van de Kamp's Bakery which we used to get in Southern California in the 1970's (maybe 80's too?). They had chunkier sugar bits on them, rather than just plain old granulated sugar.

Perfectly chewy and just the right amount of spice. Don't go over the 10 minute mark, they might not look done - BUT THEY ARE DONE.  Any longer and they get very crispy very fast. This was the perfect way to start my fall baking!

These remind me of Vermont, where I first ate them. Delicious. Take out of oven at 10 minutes even though they feel soft. They will stay chewy if you do.

These cookies were great! I substituted butter for the crisco and it worked well. I melted the butter to liquid form in the the microwave. I prefer spicier cookies so I added a little extra cloves and cinnamon. I baked the cookies for about 11-12 minutes and they were the perfect soft, chewy texture without being crunchy. I got around 70 cookies and will definitely make these again!

These have been my go-to cookie for two years now!  I made them for my husband two years ago as a treat for a trip he was taking. I had never cared for molasses cookies but these?  LOVE them!  I've never had any trouble with the recipe, except for the baking time. I use metal baking sheets and I have found that if I want a cookie with a softer center with slightly crunchy edges then 6-7 minutes is PLENTY of baking time. If I use my stone pan for baking then 7-8 minutes works. I take them out just as a few cracks start showing near the edges.  It's that point where they don't quite look done but they need to come out.  The only other variation I make is to lightly sprinkle some sugar on top as soon as they come out of the oven. :-)

I checked, several times, that all ingredients ( and measurements) were correct. I found that I had to make sure that the cookies were totally dried, in order to find them edible. If they had the slightest moisture in them they tasted a bit like baking soda, flour and cloves. I think the recipe still needs some fine tuning. In the mean time I'll keep searching for a more appetizing version.

These cookies were absolutely delicious. I made the mistake of pressing down the balls of dough on my first batch in the oven (the dough is pretty hard, so I didn't think they'd melt down much). Those ones came out SUPER hard. Figured out what I had done wrong and fixed it on the next oven round and they were perfect. Nice and soft in the middle. Yum yum yum!

I made cookies from this recipe several times over the last few years and finally got around to giving  a review.   These cookies turn out perfect every time and have become one of my absolute favorites.   They have just the right amount of chew; just the right amount of crunch, and just the right amount of spice.   I wouldn't change a thing.

Perfect!  I used butter flavored shortening, which I always do with cookies.  Amazing.  Perfectly soft inside, amazing crunch around the outside.

These were awesome, everyone at my house loved them. I did make a few healthier changes. I used coconut oil instead of the hydrogenated vegetable oil (shortening), granulated honey instead of white sugar, and whole grain fresh milled wheat flour in place of half the all-purpose.

Made exactly as instructed. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Pretty and delicious. Kids and adults loved them. :) Thanks--this is a keeper.  Note: I used 'butter flavoured' shortening.

Edit: I tried this again with butter instead of shortening (I read that another reviewer did that) and it was weird, even though I did not chill it (chilled butter would be hard unlike chilled shortening) . I thought it would be more spready, but it was less so. The flavour was still good but the texture is best with shortening. Lesson learned!

These are the real deal! If you like spice you'll love this recipe. Otherwise you may not care for it. The recipe makes a lot of cookies, perfect for holiday time. And like most things with lots of spices in it, the flavor gets better each day. Put a slice of bread with them in an air tight container if you want them to stay soft. They'll last weeks that way.

Fantastic. Fairly easy to make, with a from-scratch flavor that's part ginger snap, part sugar cookie and part molasses melt away.

This recipe is excellent! I have looked for years for a good soft  molasses cookie recipe and this is it! I followed the suggestions and used all butter just softened the butter (not melted), instead of white sugar I used brown sugar, rolled the cookies in brown sugar and added about 3 Tablespoons of diced candied ginger.  There  was no need to refrigerate the cookie dough as it was firm enough and baked it for 8 minutes. These are soft and gooey delicious with the perfect spice and sweetness.  No need to look for any other recipe- this one is the best.

These cookies were probably the best cookies I've ever made. Prefectly chewy, and my husband loved them! I did use 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of light brown sugar and I also think next time I'll either omit the salt or cut back to 1/2 tsp. 10 minutes is also the perfect baking time. I'll definitely be making these again !

These cookies came out perfectly! Even at high altitude. I would absolutely recommend them. They're not overly sweet and have a very festive and winter flavor. Perfect for the holiday season.

If you haven't made them yet and you like a good spice cookie, these are the ones for you!
This recipe had been in my family for over 60 years... We call them Sugar and Spice cookies. SO delicious!  
We double the amount of cinnamon, cloves and ginger... it's a nice robust spice flavour. We also roll them into balls, press with a fork and put a bit of white (or coloured) sugar on them before baking.

They are perfect! I tried both methods. I refrigerated for three hours and went straight from the mixer to the oven. Picture perfect soft and chewy both ways!

These were fantastic, I am so glad I made them. I halved the recipe.

Following others' tips, I used half butter and half shortening (no melting, just straight from the tub). I didn't refrigerate the dough. Plus, I didn't roll all of them in sugar. The ones without sugar are just as good, so next time I'll skip that step.

Anyway, make these, you won't regret it!

Very tasty cookies although a touch too sweet for folks that haven't developed the American sweet tooth.  To fix that problem, I baked half of the dough without rolling them in sugar.  Definitely added to my favorites though!

Didn't do any changes to this except I didn't read it right the first. I patted the cookies instead of making balls and keeping them that way. They ended up flattening more and overcooking. They were still great. Second time I made them (the next day), I doubled the recipe and kept the other half in the fridge. Anytime I want a bunch, I will cook them then. Great winter cookies.

I use this app all the time and have never left a review but had to because this was the best!! I have never made molasses cookies before but have eaten plenty. this was by far the best, and I made them!! I think I made them bigger than they were supposed to be because I adjusted the recipe for 48 and made just over 3 dozen, but my god they are good.

Great recipe, I make this a few times every holiday.  

I did cream the shortening rather than heat it and let it cool.  My yield is about 50 cookies, with each weighing 1/1.1 US ounces before baking.

Great recipe!  I used butter, softened it instead of melting it, creamed it with the sugar and molasses, and didn't refrigerate the dough.  Still awesome!!

I followed the recipe exactly (except I didn't sift the dry ingredients) and they turned out excellent!  I only made a half batch and it made a decent number of 2-3 bite cookies (maybe a little more than 3 dozen?).  Very spicy but the sugar balances it nicely.  Definitely will make again.

Love these chewy cookies, as do the rest of my family!  Definitely use shortening and roll in sugar, they kept for a really long time.  They did become hard after freezing and thawing though, so next time I will bake them closer to Christmas and just leave them in tupperware.

AMAZING! I hate molasses cookies. I hate molasses! Why then did I make these cookies you ask? Of course they are my boyfriend's favorite. I am a simple chocolate chip girl myself but these were literally the best cookies I have ever tasted in my life. They were also pretty and chewy. I was amazed. I did alter the recipe slightly. Instead of 2 cups white sugar i used 1 cup white, 1 cup brown (brown sugar just lends itself beautifully to the other spices). I also used 1 cup shortening and 1/2 c. Butter. (I like my cookies a little buttery) I didnt melt the shortening first either...it seemed like a pointless step to me and I was correct in that thought.  I would also recommend using black strap brand molasses. It is just better quality.

I'm not certain if my 'OK' rating is fair. I made these  cookies thinking they would be like another recipe I normally use, but chose this one for the number of cookies in the batch.   I prefer the molasses cookies that are more like the cinnamon gingersnaps, since I serve them to book club.   These cookies are  like molasses snickerdoodles,

I just put the shortening in with the sugar, then eggs and used the mixer and it blended well.  I did not melt the shortening.  This batch makes 6 doz.  I plan to freeze them as well.  Also, I used parchment paper instead of greasing the pan.  Works great!  Oh yeah, the cookie tastes excellent too!

My go-to cookie recipe. Molasses cookies make me think of Christmas, and Grandma's cookie jar where she always had molasses cookies for me when she knew I was coming to visit. I've made this cookie about 30 times now, with many variations and they have all come out great. Here are my tips. 
I suspect the reason to let the shortening cool after melting is not to add the eggs to hot oil, which would be bad.  My preference is slightly melty, but mostly room temperature, butter flavored Crisco. I've done part shortening, part room temperature butter and that works fine too. I cream the shortening and sugar really well, add the molasses, then the eggs. 
I've not bothered to sift the flour and spices. Instead I add all together in a big bowl and whisk them to combine. I go a slight bit heavy (a couple dashes more than called for) on the cloves and ginger, and I've even done a few dashes of pumpkin pie spice too. It all boils down to the spices you like. 
I definitely like to chill the dough to make it easier to work with. In the past I've split the dough in half to bake part right away, and saved part for later. I've needed to add a few tablespoons of flour to the dough if using right away without chilling it. I've stored the dough in the refrigerator for up to a week, to bake when it was convenient. I get a little over 5 dozen cookies from this recipe. 
I've not tried the variation of using part brown sugar instead of all granulated white sugar. I like to roll the cookies in washe

Made this exactly how recipe was given. Love love these way too much they killed my diet I could not stop eating them. Definitely will be putting these on my cookie trays at Christmas and making throughout the year. Definitely watch your cooking time if you want them soft.

Refrigeration not necessary.  Roll in regular sugar...not course sugar.  Do not cook more than 8 minutes.  Place a slice of bread in container to keep soft.

My first time making molasses cookiest and this seems to be a great recipe! Might tweak a bit, because my husband says they taste a bit salty (I only put in the recipe amount), and he says maybe add a bit more ginger. But, overall, great! Thanks for a great recipe!

Perfect. I left the extra dough in the fridge for a week and made a pan every few days. They were always delicious. Worth the 3 hour chill time.

Turned out perfect. I didn't have all purpose flour so I had to use whole wheat flour but it made no difference they're still delicious and chewy...mmm.

Love it - and it was a big hit with my family.  

My only suggestion is to make your cookie dough and place it in the refrigerator overnight.  They overnight chill gave the cookies more flavor.  It's the the chill marinated the dough! 

I was getting tired the night I was making these and placed the dough in the refrigerator overnight - and to my surprise......yummy... 

Thank you for the recipe - this one is going in the keep pile.

Excellent !! Easy and quick,,, and just perfect. Definite keeper. I just sub 1/2 c butter and 1 c shortening, and 1 c white sugar and 1 c brown sugar. Just blended as is,,, did not melt shortening,, everything worked out great. Thought it was a lil bit dry, but I worked it outside of the bowl and they were just right. Did not cool dough, just worked from there and then in the oven they went. Kept the spices as they are, and these are just perfect again. I baked for 8 min was just right for me, bit crunchy on the outside and soft inside. I tried a few at 10 mins was too much unless u like them really crunchy. Thanx so much for this wonderful recipe !!

I'm more of a chocolate chip kind of girl but this is one amazing cookie.  My husband says it's the best molasses cookie he's ever had and it's now his favorite.  The only thing I did different was use room temp butter instead of shortening because it's what I had on hand and did half white sugar and half dark brown because I ran out of white.  Soft and chewy spiced perfection.

Amazing. I didn't even wait the three hours to make them.  Also, I replaced the shortening with equal parts butter.  My oven bake time was 13 minutes and they came perfectly soft baked.  This is a recipe I will definitely use again.

A nice rich slightly chewy cookie similar to a soft version of a ginger snap. I found chilling the dough slightly just prior baking helps in the handling. This is a family favorite and they disappear quickly!

These smell so good while they are baking! I halved the recipe because I didn't want too many cookies around and boom they were gone.These came out so good, I did use 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening. I also did 1/2 cup granulated and 1/2 cup brown sugar. These are the best cookies. I'm going to have to make a whole recipe next time.

The flavor is awesome, but they were really flat - I'm going to try the half butter next time to see if it makes a difference. I also had to reduce the cooking time to 9 minutes.

These are amazing! I made them last year for a holiday party and everyone loved them. I added a drizzle of melted semi sweet chocolate over the top to dress them up a little bit. They were Great and the Bread trick works like a charm!

These were, like most said 5 stars!!  My son made them today just as the recipe said and were too good!  I'm afraid we can't make these too often.  I will eat too many of them.  ;-)   These would be amazing around Fall with colored sugar as one other reader suggested!  Clearly, now one of our absolute favorites.  Thank you for sharing!

I have never been great at making cookies, mine always get hard.  Then I read a review that said if this happens you are over cooking them.  I followed the time on these for 8 minutes(which was very hard because they look so underdone when you pull them out) and they were some of the best cookies I've ever made.  They stayed soft and were delicious.

I wouldn't change a thing! I made this in a half batch since I didn't want too many cookies in the house. They came out perfect at 9 minutes for me.

Flavor was okay, and the method of making them wasn't bad either. But the temperature is way off along with the baking time. I wouldn't make these again, nor recommend this recipe to anyone!!

Easy, tasty cookie, great for children to help make. I used butter flavored shortening, which was perfect. Replaced white sugar with (loosely measured) dark brown sugar which gave a richer flavor, and rolled the cookies in turbinado sugar, which was pretty.

My grandmother, who passed away in 2012, made the best molasses sugar cookies.  Until this recipe, nothing has ever come close.  These are absolutely delicious, soft yet chewy and freeze GREAT!  I followed the recipe exactly as is and couldn't have been happier.  I'm pretty sure you got this recipe from my gram ;-)

O.M.G.  I don't consider myself much of a baker, but I felt like a pastry chef when I made these tonight.  These are the best cookies ever!  I was looking for a recipe similar to my late grandma's, and these are even better (sorry grandma).  I didn't want 72 cookies, so I cut the recipe in half, and I added a tablespoon of corn syrup to make them extra chewy/gooey.  I also skipped melting the Crisco, and didn't refrigerate as I was too impatient.  Makes about three dozen. By the way, I have never rated anything, but these were way too good not to comment.  THANK YOU!

I followed the recipe precisely and found it a little lacking.  It might've been me but I'm an experienced cookie baker so I don't think so.  While the taste is good, I want a molasses cookie to taste more molasses-y and less of other spices.  Also mine were flat as a pancake and I'd like mine a little more meatier...more like Archways.  I'll keep looking.

Made these at Christmas 2013. Everyone loved them! Didn't change a thing. Made them again in 2017, cut the recipe in half and still got 40 cookies making walnut sized balls. Perfect bake time was 9 1/2 mins. Baked them on parchment paper and they slid right off.

I'm not a fan of molasses cookies,  but those who like molasses cookies said these were good. They said you could taste it but it wasn't overpowering.

So good!  A friend had made these for a party and they were delicious. I decided to make some for Christmas with a couple of tweaks even though they are 5 star as is- I used 1 c brown sugar and 1 c white sugar, doubled the amount of ginger and halved the amount of cloves.  Then I drizzled them with semisweet chocolate once they cooled.  For those on the South Shore of Boston, these reminded me of Ginger Betty's signature cookie :)

The only change I made was substituting 1 cup of white sugar for light brown - and these were perfect!  Just what I was looking for in taste, with the right amount of soft instead of the gingersnap recipes I was debating on.  Thanks for sharing!!

Just took my last batch out of the oven and let me just say they are amazing!  I made them with all butter,(don't like shortening taste) 1 cup white, 1 cup brown sugar and the rest as written in the recipe. Perfect. The spice blend is perfect and sweetness is perfect.  I will definitely be making these again!

The best Christmas Cookie recipe. So easy to make- really hard to mess up! They turn out perfect every time. Tip: to make them go from great to phenomenal, I always melt some white chocolate wafers and dip them halfway and let them cool.... Amazing!

This recipe turned out just perfect. My new favorite Christmas cookie. I was looking for a "ginger" cookie, so just increased the amount of ginger and decreased the cinnamon. Basically just swapped the ingredient quantities. Just love these.

I didn't have ground ginger, so I had to use some nutmeg instead. Still tasted really good. I really like this recipe. I think the shortening helps to keep the cookies soft. I baked mine until they just started cracking on top.

These are great.  I've made them a few times, and I like them with butter best.  I also don't bother to sift the flour, and once didn't even refrigerate.  They were flatter and a little harder to form into balls when unrefrigerated (a bit sticky), but tasted great!  Each variation simply makes a different, yet equally yummy cookie!

I made this recipe and it is as great as others have already said.  I didn't change anything but the next time I might add some raisins.  In my family, this now has the stamp of approval from 3 grandbabies, 1 DIL, and most importantly, from my hubby!  I will definitely be making these again and again.

These were fabulous! I didn't chill or roll, just dropped on pan from tablespoon. My only changes were to use half brown sugar half white sugar, and to add a LOT more cinnamon and ginger, and a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I also added a few dashes of nutmeg and cut way back on the cloves to just over a pinch. Baked for 10 minutes exactly per other comments and they came out beautifully, with a crunchy edge and chewy middle. Oh! I also substituted King Arthur Gluten Free All-Purpose Flour instead of regular flour, so mine are GF. That was the only substitution to make these GF, and even my gluten eating husband liked them!

These cookies are fabulous!  I happen to like rich, savory tastes, and this recipe fills the bill.  I used blackstrap molasses for a richer taste, and I doubled down on the ginger with candied ginger chips, so I could call them Ginger-Ginger cookies (a nod to the famous Far Side cartoon where an owner scolds his dog, Ginger, who hears "Ginger, blah, blah, blah, blah, Ginger, blah, blah, blah.)  My wife, who's a notoriously finicky eater, asked for a second cookie after tasting the first.

Wonderful and easy.  I did not melt the crisco and used half crisco and half butter.  I did refrigerate the dough for about 30 minutes.  Baked for 8 minutes and they came out perfect.  Will make these again.

Exact recipe that has been handed down in my family for generations.  It is always a huge hit.  I follow the recipe precisely, and, never fail to produce a superb batch.  Very easy.

I am fairly new to baking. In the recipe it calls for white sugar. Is this granulated sugar or confectioners sugar. I am confused becasue I see it says to roll the doughballs in granulated sugar.

I used 1 and 1/2 cups melted butter instead of shortening and added 1/2 teaspoon of Cream of Tartar to get a more crackled look. Topped off with red, green, yellow and shimmer cupcake sugar. Family loved these!

I made this according to some of the suggestions in the reviews.  I substituted 1/2c butter for some of the shortening and used ground allspice for the cloves (all I had).  I also didn't melt and cool the shortening, just creamed together with the sugar.  These were good cookies, and mine weren't too flat and stayed chewy.  We wanted a spiced molasses cookie, and that is definitely what this is.  If you don't want to taste molasses or the spice, these aren't for you.  While these were all eaten, if I make these again I'll definitely sub butter for all the shortening (just dietary preference), but before that I'll try different spiced cookie recipes.  I felt these were missing something. Good but not great...tasted store bought (probably all the shortening).

These cookies are PERFECT AS IS!! The dough tastes kind of strong, but once they are cooked, they are perfect. Crispy on the edges, chewy in the middle. Cuter with green sugar on outside. Nice contrast between brown cookie and green. Red blended in. I think melting the shortening changes the consistances or something. Once it was melted and then cooled, it was a glossy, transparent color. I DID NOT freeze it before baking. Try baking a test cookie first. As for the time...it's REALLY hard not to overbake. I found that 8 1/2 minutes was about right for my oven. And these taste fantastic with milk! Enjoy!!

They're all gone! They were just too good. These are the best molasses spice cookies I've ever made. I used butter instead of Crisco, and I always add a bit more ginger and a bit more cinnamon than called for, but the recipe was simple, and they came out amazing. I just used plain white sugar and not the colored as shown in the pic (which doesn't look at all appealing IMHO).

I don't usually give 5 stars, but these cookies deserve all of those stars! I followed the recipe, only changing the sugars. I used 1 cup each brown and white sugar, instead of all white sugar. They were full of flavor, and the spicing was wonderful!!! Once baked, they were soft, but held their shape in the cookie jar. DH took them to an office party, and a few people said they were the best cookies they've had in a long time :-) Definately going to make these again!!

I make these cookies every year for Christmas along with iced, cut-out cookies that take a long time to decorate.  EVERYONE still asks for the molasses cookies.  I use the recipe from my Mother who has since passed.  It is the same except I use 1 1/2 cups of melted butter instead of Crisco.  It takes a little time to incorporate it into the sugar and molasses so just keep stirring. To make a deeper, richer flavor, I use 2 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. cardamon instead of just cinnamon.  I bake these cookies early in December and freeze them, wrapping a dozen in Reynolds Wrap then into a gallon size freezer bag.  It is amazing how wonderful they keep.  If I am lucky to have any left for my husband, he just takes a package out of the freezer, lets them sit on the counter a few minutes and eats them.  They taste like you just made them.

This is the same as another molasses sugar cookie recipe on here, this one is just doubled and recommends chilling. I tried some chilled and some not, and there does not seem to be a difference. I also tried some rolled in sugar and some not and they are both good. The sugared ones are prettier and make more of a mess and take more time. This version of the recipe makes close to 9 dozen for me. UPDATE: I entered these in the local fair with the only change being I didn't use the spices and I added vanilla extract, I got 3rd.

Great recipe - I did use butter instead of shortening. No opportunity to see if they would last for an extended period of time since they were all consumed within a couple of days. I did add a twist or a Kiss by adding a Pumpkin Spice flavored Hershey Kiss to the top of each cookie. YUMMY!

I really like these cookies.  They are chewy and look really fun with colored sugar.  I made them with butter flavored crisco (all I had) and enjoyed the slightly buttery flavor.  I also used half sugar/brown sugar.  Will put it in my box of Christmas goody recipes.

Very good!  
My first pan of cookies were a little too small (was trying to get LOTS) and I baked them a little too long so they came out crisp.  The next pan I made them larger and took a minute off the baking time and they were excellent. 

Out of personal preference I will probably add a little more ginger next time.

This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Delicious.  I used coconut oil instead of shortening to make them a little healthier, but did the rest as directed.  Definitely making again for the holidays!  Maybe with some nuts and or chocolate to add another flavor/texture.

PERFECT just the way it is.  We made no substitutions or alterations and this cookie is awesome.  We like a softer cookie, so we baked them for 8 minutes and YUM.  Great recipe for kids to help with :) Thanks for sharing. This one is definitely a keeper!

These are fantastic! Truly soft and chewy! I followed directions to a T but mine didn't do the lovely crackly thing :( But, still wonderful, and a quick favorite of those who've had them! Even ones I thought I baked too long are incredibly moist, chewy and delicious!

These are great!! I substituted butter for the shortening, as I had none on-hand, but otherwise followed the recipe as it is written. The cookies are chewy and perfectly spicy. Thank you for a great recipe!!

Even my children liked these, which I had not counted on. They were soft and moist and the flavor was not too strong. Definitely a new family favorite.

AMAZING!  The best cookies I have ever made or eaten!  I made one small change.  I did a 50/50 mixture of shortening and butter instead of all shortening.  If you want a softer cookie bake for 8 min, 10 min for a crunchier cookie.  Wonderful flavor, great texture.  The dough make up beautifully.  It's not sticky like you would expect when using molasses.  It's just like working with playdough.  I made these last night and I'm making another batch today to give away to everyone I know!

These turned out excellent! I put them in for 8 minutes and they were nice and chewy! The only thing I did different was that I omitted the cloves because my hubby doesn't like them....

First of all, be careful which lever you are pulling on the Kitchen Aid - thought I was locking it and pulled it on FULL SPEED after adding the flour :(  Once the explosion was all cleared, I finished mixing it, rolled it into balls, rolled it in granulated sugar and put it in the fridge while the oven came up to temp (didn't bother with the overnight or 3 hour chill).  Baked them off, and they are fantastic!  The only thing I did different was half the recipe (no big deal, still got more than 3 dozen), use half brown and half white sugar (as per a review), and omit the cloves (which I hate).  I will DEFINITELY make these again.  AND, I will be more careful with the levers :)

2 die 4!  My NEW favorite Christmas cookie!  I substituted butter for the shortening, and they are WONDERFUL!  MUCH better than my gingerbread recipe that I've used in the past.  That recipe is now in the garbage!  :->

These cookies are wonderful. I made the dough and refrigerated it until I was ready to bake; 2 & 1/2 days later, and they turned out great! They are perfectly crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. After reading reviews, I replaced the shortening with butter. The results are sturdy for sending, nice-looking and delicious. Didn't want the hassle of making gingerbread men.

Best molasses cookie!  I used melted margarine and they tasted super!  I took them to my son's orthdontists's office and they are still raving about how soft and chewy they were.   Thank you for a great recipe!

Oh my gosh, these were so good! I didn't let the shortening cool all the way before I mixed it, but just enough so it didn't cook the egg. Being liquidy helped make the mixing easier. Also, since I was low on all-purpose flour I used half of that and half whole wheat flor. They were wonderful! My five year-old like them so much he kept stealing dough the whole time I was trying to put them on the cookie sheet.

these came out great.  easy to make, moist, chewy, gingery.  i've made them w/o rolling in granulated sugar also, for a slightly less sweet treat.  have also substituted whole wheat flour, and they came out just as good.

Loved this cookie.  They turned out so soft and stayed soft while storing.  It made a lot of cookies, I got like 45 cookies out of the batch.  I didn't have any cloves so I didn't use any.  I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white.  I also screwed up and forgot to let the shortening cool so my dought got stiff in the fridge, but once I started playing with it, it softened right up.  So good, so soft and chewey and so simple.  I will be making these again for sure!

So Good! The dough was very easy to work with. I made the dough the night before and I actually made the cookies larger then called for and they still turned out perfect. I also kept the piece of bread in with the cookies when storing and it left them very soft. I will be making these again! Enjoy!

These were pretty good. Mine didn't spread out very much so I had to flatten the rolled balls while in the oven. They were still a great hit and tasty.

Great cookies!  Watch them very carefully in the oven however.  They took only 7 minutes to perfection, the full 10 was a burnt disaster.  I'll be making these again :)

Turned out great! I rolled them in white and red decorator's sugar and they looked very festive. I also subbed fresh ginger (from the tube) for ground ginger because I didn't have any.

Very good cookie. Not the very best ever, but definitely good and pretty with the colored sugar on there. I made some of them plain, without rolling them in sugar, and those are, honestly, even better.

A good cookie! I made a small change to the baking time. Many said to cook for 10 minutes but I found 8 minutes was enough to cook it and it was a super soft cookie! 10 minutes made it too hard for my liking. I am not sure about the baking soda amount. I was able to taste it in the raw and cooked result. Rolling the cookie ball before baking helped offset the slight bitterness. I will try to decrease it in the next batch.   Overall a great substitute for gingerbread and the kids loved it!

We loved these. I made them 2 weeks ago and am trying to stay away from them until XMas.  They are keeping nice wrapped in foil. This is an old school cookie, will bring back memories of home to everyone. Great with coffee!

Scrumptious!!  Soooo easy to make and it makes about 2 dozen more than indicated!  I did as another suggested and sprinkled with red sprinkles and also some of the edible snowflakes...they sparkle and they're so pretty!  These will be a great addition to my candy/cookie trays for friends.  Thank you for sharing!

I tried this recipe to have for my daughter when she arrived home from college (she said she liked molasses cookies).  These are yummy!  I used only butter for the shortening but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Perfectly spiced!  I used crystal sanding sugar with some edible snow glitter mixed in for the holiday sparkle...beautiful.  AND delicious.  Adding this to my personal recipe box for good!

My husband LOVES these cookies.  They are nostologic in their flavor and texture - not too sweet and full of spice and warmth.  I also do these as a one bowl cookie just putting it all together with the sugar and wet ingredients, mixing well, then adding in all the dry with a final mix.  The dough turns out great each time.

I thought I hated spice cookies until I tried these and the Big Soft Ginger Cookies from this site. They are now two of my favorites, and I believe if either had the slightest hint of more spice they would be terrible. Just perfect! I wouldn't change a thing.

Very tasty, not too spicy...my "cookie hounds" (aka coworkers) loved them!  Only thing I would change if I could is that I wish this cookie where thicker textured.  The flavor itself is just right "as is".

Fantastic-used 1 cup sugar, and 1 cup brown sugar.  Used 1 1/2 teaspoons each of cloves and ginger.  Cooked for 11 minutes-Crispy outside and chewy on the inside.  Wonderful recipe.  This is a keeper.

It had a little too strong of a buttery taste so I may use less next time... but they were too good not to make again. Maybe next time I might use a little cream cheese frosting in place of the sprinkles.

Turned out fantastic, lasted for two weeks in an airtight container, kids and adults loved them.  I made them with granulated sugar instead of colored sugar.

I made a slew of cookies this holiday season and these were just raved about by everyone who had them! I used butter instead of shortening and did put the dough in the fridge for a little while before I rolled them. My only regret was not saving a dozen for my own family to enjoy!! I will definitely make these again and again and again!

These were great, I have been looking for something with this flavor for years.  Someone made a Molasses Spice type cookie and gave them to our family as a gift a few years ago.  They were so good.  So glad I found this, so simple and a keeper.

This is a pretty good cookie recipe. They taste great. The only problem i had was the bottoms were burning after only 9 min. of baking time. So i had to take mine out early...but i blame this on the oven i was using because it doesn't seem to cook evenly. The recipe itself is pretty easy and fun to make. I used red sugar to roll them in to look festive.

Mmm!!  These are great, recipe as-is.  I baked for 10 minutes which might've been a tad too long.  They're pretty hard, but it just depends on how soft you like your molasses cookies.  Next time I make them I'll take them out a little earlier.

I made these for my dad who grew up on true molasses cookies in a mennonite family.  He said these reminded him so much of the ones his grandma used to make.  This recipe is a keeper.  They are fabulous!!

This recipe is great! My cookies came out beautiful. I got almost 6 dozen from a single batch, maybe I made mine small? Regardless, I baked mine 10 minutes and they were a tiny bit crisp and nice and chewy. I only refrigerated for 1.5 hrs because I am impatient and the dough was very easy to work with! I will definetly be making these again.

These are outstanding!!!!!

I altered this recipe slightly:
one c of butter flavored shortening
1/2 c of salted butter
omitted salt
1.5 c of brown sugar
1/2 c of granulated sugar
measured spices loosely
I received rave reviews for the cookies and in my oven they needed only about 7-8 minutes per batch, perfect crispy/chewy texture.  I did have to flatten with a fork after rolling in sugar in order to get the texture I wanted.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Lovely cookie! 
I like a slightly chewy cookie - so either my oven is too hot or my cookies were smaller than walnuts - I adjusted and turned the oven to 350 degrees and baked for about 7 to 7.5 minutes. 
Really nice! I do believe I'll be making these again next year.

Nice shape, chewy texture, great balance of spice. I followed these recommendations from other reviewers: 1) Instead of 2c. granulated sugar as written in the recipe, I used 1c. granulated sugar and 1c. brown sugar; 2) I used butter-flavored shortening; 3) I  baked the cookies right away without refrigerating the dough; 4) I only used 1/2t. salt; 5) I used a baking stone, baked the cookies for 10 minutes, took them out of the oven, let them sit for one minute on the baking stone, then removed the cookies and placed them on a cooling rack. They turned out perfectly. Additionally, I used a number 50 scoop, which resulted in the recipe making 70 cookies.

I had to cook them 12 min to get rid of the goo inside the cookie.  Also, I didn't understand all that stuff about melting butter on the stove, nobody does that, melt it in the microwave and add it to the mix.  This is a one-bowl recipe.  They were a little too salty for me, but everyone else liked them.  I copied the other poster and did 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar and I added a t of nutmeg.  The rolling of the cookies in the granulated sugar would be fun for a minor, too bad there were none around.  Not the best, but still a fun recipe.

These were wonderful!  It was an easy recipe to follow.  Next time I make them I think I will cut down on the baking soda as after they baked they did have a little bit stronger baking soda flavor to them than I like.

Yum!  A nice soft, chewy cookie that warms your insides with just the right amount of spice.  I only modified the recipe by using 3/4 tsp. of ginger and 1/4 tsp. of cayenne.  Really adds that extra bit of warmth.  Perfect for cold winters!

My son and I made these as a holiday gift for his teachers at school. They were terrific! And the advice to use a piece of bread to soften the cookies if they dried out worked perfectly.

My mom always makes the best molasses cookies so I was hesitant to make any myself.  I decided to give this recipe a try and I'm really glad I did!  They came out perfect and chewy and were gone really fast.  Putting a piece of bread in with them over night really helped keep them moist.

SoooOOOooo good. Both me & my fiance loved these cookies! He asked for me to always have them in the house from now on (he's never asked me to do that before.) I made one batch, I'm planning on doing two more this Christmas, one extra to give out with our Christmas cookie plates and the other to freeze so we can microwave whenever we want more! Thanks for the WONDERFUL recipe!!

Yummy cookies!  The flavor is great - perfect spicy little cookie.  They stay chewy as long as you don't cook them too long - 8 minutes was perfect for me.  I rolled them in colored sugar (green and red) and they made pretty Christmas cookies.  I too added 2 T. of corn syrup like a previous reviewer suggested.

These Molasses Cookies were very good and easy to make. A little crunchy on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside. I rolled in green and red colored sugar for Christmas, and will add this to my Christmas Cookie Recipe Collection. My children liked these cookies - I didn't think they would like molasses but they both said "yummy." I am making ahead and freezing for the holiday.
