Very tasty and easy to put together. I didn't quite have enough hot salsa left in my fridge so I added in some diced tomatoes with chilli paste. Next time I may add some Cajun seasoning to the dish, I like my food super spicy!

Pretty good. Added taco seasoning to the chicken and topped with black olives, sour cream, cheese and fresh chopped cilantro. Yum!

Very easy and very quick, yet it tastes so good people will think you slaved for hours over this dish! I used "Taco Seasoning II" from this site to season the chicken before cooking. I also left out the celery and instead used red pepper. I also had some leftover corn on the cob so I used that vs. frozen corn. For the salsa I used Ortega's Medium chunky style salsa and light Mexican blend cheese. I pretty it up a bit by topping it off with some sliced black olives and thin sliced green onions.The chicken is tender, juicy and oh so good! It's perfect topped off with dollup of light sour cream- YUM!

This was so easy, and this is coming from a person that is NOT a cook. And for it being pretty healthy, it's really really good. I used brown rice with it and no sour cream or corn or celery and it was still so yummy. I will definitely cook this again.

This was pretty good, though I would season the chicken with some taco seasoning as someone suggested. I also would consider adding a red bell pepper and leaving out the celery.

Yummy!! My husband and I loved this recipe! I used medium salsa which gave it a nice heat but I think next time I will try hot salsa. I will definitely be making it again.

A nice, satisfying meal. I used a tomatillo-cilantro salsa and thought the flavor was excellent. I served the sour cream & cheese on the side - thought this dish was good enough without adding the extra calories.

This recipe was everything we look for in a recipe. It was quick, easy, tasty, and we had everything on hand.  Hubby and I enjoyed it very much!  Thanks for another great recipe to add to our recipe box!  

I wanted to add to this. I made this tonight, and added water chestnuts. It was so good!  I am on a low carb diet, so we skipped the corn, and the rice!

This recipe has it all. Quick, easy, low fat (and calorie), attractive to serve and Mmm Mmm Good. 

On thing to remember, if you use your regular salsa, which you're used to having by the spoonful on a burrito, or a little scooped up with a chip, this might be a bit spicy.  

Although I loved it, my husband found it a "bit much" so next time we will use 1/2 our regular salsa, and 1/2 a milder salsa.

But this will Definitely become a household staple.

This is a very easy and delicious dinner.  I put some salt and garlic powder on the chicken while it was cooking so it wouldn't be bland.  My 21 month old loved it!

Good, easy recipe! It was a hit with my family and the whole thing took about 20 minutes. I  added more salsa though, because I added more veggies bc my family loves them. I will definitely make this again.

I make a dish very close to this one I  have to tell you all about it instead of celery I put a small zucchini and some bell pepper I like to use the green pepper because it gives a good color.
and I made a quick salsa w/can of diced tomatoes some onion and cilantro then to make it spicy I pored  in some of the juice from a can of jalapenos that can add a lot of taste. yummy I did not add any sour cream nor did I use cheese I am on a low fat diet but I did not feel like I was dieting w/this meal I added pappy's seasoning to give it a cajun kick and added some of my favorite hot sauce Tapatio and its a favorite in my house
It is also a meal that you can add diferent squash to and best of all anti vegie people this meal will get you eating your vegies so dont miss this meal it is a pleaser to all whome love flavor but warrning its on of those meals that you can be full but you just cant help to eat some more!!!

Loved this recipe - My boyfriend says this is one of his favorites that I've made!  So simple to cook for one person, a small family or a large gathering.  The best part was the next day I served the chicken and veggies and over mixed greens as a salad for lunch.

I am newly out living on my own, with limited appliances, so quick and EASY is the story of my life!  This recipe was great!  I seasoned the chicken first with Emeril's Essence, and just used what I already had veggie-wise.  Very flavorful, and will make again!!

Used what I had on hand. 1 cup salsa, 1 1/2 Tbl tomato paste, 1/2 c. fire roasted tomatoes, 1 tsp cumin. I didn't put in corn, red bell instead of green. No celery or mushrooms, but I did dice up zucchini and carrots and put more garlic in. So much flavor, so many variations you can do with this. So easily able to change it to what you like or what you have. Definitely going into my rotation.

Like the others said, this was an easy dish to make.  I was afraid it would be too spicy with all the salsa but it actually wasn't spicy enough.  Next time I will use hot salsa instead of mild. I also found myself adding a lot of sour cream, so something was missing in the flavor department.  Maybe I'll add more veggies next time.

This was delicious! I did use more garlic, and I added cilantro and sliced black olives. I also seasoned the chicken with taco seasoning.
