This was okay but could use more flavor. The one and only change I made in the beginning was with the wrappers. My store had potsticker wrappers but no wonton wrappers. So, I made potstickers instead of wontons but with filling and more of it. The wrapper turn into one big noodle after they float to the top so you are basically eating a big bowl of noodles with a hint of shrimp flavor. I definitely recommend adding more to your dumpling suck as chopped veggies and more seasoning. I had a handful of frozen peas and carrots that I threw in just to give it some color but that didn't really help much for flavor. This recipe is okay but bland as written.
