I believe this to be the actual version of a dumbed down recipe circulating on Pinterest - exact same picture, at least.  I've never made caramel corn before - it always seemed like a very involved process.  This was really simple, though.  Yes, it takes a little time to get it all together (the melting time) but it was totally worth it.  My daughters shook some sprinkles in while I was mixing and that was fun.  We made the popcorn in our microwave popping bowl and only did half the amount - saving the rest of the caramel for another time.  I'll be interested to see how well it melts down next time.  Don't hesitate to make this - it's really yummy.  Oh, and we only have mini marshmallows.  I found somewhere online where it said 1 lg marshmallow=10 minis ... meaning 230 for this recipe.  My husband counted them out and it worked great!

Quick & Delicious!  For the amount of time and effort I had to put into this recipe (virtually none) I was thrilled with the result!  One important tip, remember that burning butter drastically alters flavour.  Cook slowly!  Also, the caramel goes farther than you think.  It's very flavourful so you likely won't need to use it all.  Like the recipe says, you can store the extra and microwave it later.  Wonderful!  Thank you for this recipe!  It's a keeper!!!

Addicting! I agree with @crowderfamily: the photo that goes with this recipe is all over pinterest, with a different (and inferior) recipe. The Pinterest recipe was a big failure. But THIS recipe is amazing. I am not a fan of microwave popcorn, so that is the only change I made. Instead, I put about 2 Tablespoons of coconut oil in a large pot with 1 cup of popcorn kernels. Then heat over medium or medium high heat (cover with aluminum foil, poke with knife to make ten slits). Shake every half minute or so as they pop. This produced the perfect amount of popcorn for this recipe. You could even use a little less popcorn, if you want it to be REALLY gooey. Dang, can't wait to make this again!

So easy and yummy! I forgot to add the vanilla which I'm pretty disappointed in myself for, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I'll definitely make this recipe again!

I like that it stayed soft, but there was way too much caramel for the amount of popcorn. If I were to make it again I would half the amount of caramel ingredients.

I love the flavor of the Carmel! What I did though, because it reminded me of the popcorn balls I made with my dad as a child, I rubbed butter on my hands and allowed the mixture to cool just until workable , then compressed the popcorn into balls and wrapped them in plastic wrap! Tada!??

So yummy! Perfect texture (soft and chewy but not too gooey/sticky) and taste and colour. I used air popped popcorn and added a cup of chopped pecans. Yummy!

Completely, totally amazing caramel popcorn!  I ended up adding some cinnamon to the caramel before putting it on the popcorn and also salting the popcorn after I put the caramel on.   Sooooo good!

This popcorn tastes yummy!  I didn't give it 5 stars cuz it was very messy and difficult to cut.   I won't make it again but the flavor was there.  I think I prefer to make more of a candy.

This is such a simple and easy recipe. I am only 13 and I made this so many times for the family. I agree with Lae. There is a lot of caramel. What I do to make it more enjoyable, is use 3 bags of popcorn instead of two. Also, I take the kernals out of the popcorn before adding caramel for a more enjoyable time when eating it. It tastes chewy, sweet, and delightlful. A perfect recipe for caramel popcorn;)

Extremely easy and Extremely yummy!  I did double up on the amount of popcorn listed.  I also put the finished popcorn in a warm oven for about 40 minutes and stirred it every 10 minutes.  This helped it stick to the popcorn and not be so sticky for the kids.  Yes, I have the kids that would eat it either way and then run off to play with sticky hands. lol

Perfect! I wanted something gooey and delicious. This was it, and so fast too!  Just double the amount of popcorn or make half the caramel. Otherwise your popcorn is SWIMMING in caramel. I also salted my popcorn (not microwave). 1/2 cup un-popped corn to 1/2 the caramel was just right.  You can shape these into balls, too.

Super good!  Best dessert ever made!  Hint: Keep stirring to make marsh mellows melt faster and to make butter not burn.  Great for desserts to pack to school, or to share with the class for a special occasion.

A little on the sweet side. Were I to make it again, I would cut the sugar by half and leave out the corn syrup. I would also make sure I keep the heat low.

After reading other reviews, I halved the caramel sauce, and it was perfect (although I like ooey gooey caramel corn and could easily enjoy it with the regular recipe amount too!).  Thanks for sharing!

This was a bit much.  I've made similar recipes and thought I'd try this version. This recipe was very yummy but ultimately it was too sweet. There really was just too much coating.  If I make this again I would cut everything in half (except the popcorn).  Using 2 bags of popcorn with 1/2 the caramel mixture would have been perfect!  The result is very soft, smooth, and sweet as caramel corn should be...just too much coating. Enjoy!

It is addictive! I did change a couple of things...I popped the popcorn in a pan vs. microwave popcorn. I added a little salt to the caramel, cut the brown sugar in half and added chocolate m-n-m's. This was for a baby shower and I put it in a bowl with a sign that said "She's about to pop".

fun recipe, I added peanuts because every time I buy caramel corn with nuts, there are never enough inside. so it was great to be able to throw in too many. :) The popcorn is sweet and tastes great but for some reason didn't taste very caramel-y to me.

I only had dark corn syrup and white sugar, but I figured they balanced each other.  I think it would be better with brown sugar.  However, this was delicious!  Very gooey and sweet.

Fast, easy, and delicious! Only change I made was using air-popped popcorn instead of microwave. I used 1/2 cup of unpopped kernels and had quite a lot of extra caramel, next time I will probably do 3/4 cup instead. I will definitely make this again, we made popcorn balls and they've stayed soft and delicious for a few days now.

Holy yummy popcorn balls!  I really love that they are soft and easy to eat.  I don't generally care much for popcorn balls , but I'm a fan of these.

This was really good stuff. I made my own popcorn; I used a little more than 1/2 cup kernels in 1/4 cup oil. I split the caramel part of the recipe in half (I probably used more than half the marshmallows though since I only had the mini ones so I had no way to measure them.) and it made just the right amount. We will be making this again.

Delicious! Added a heaping tablespoon of chocolate hazelnut spread. Would also be good with peanut butter.

This was so delicious and easy to make.  It makes a ton of the caramel topping I actually had enough for at least 3 bags of popcorn.  I saved some and a few days later slowly heated up in the microwave and it tasted just as wonderful and it was a quick treat that day for my family.  I also added chocolate chips to one batch and a little extra salt and it was simply divine ;)
It is worth the time to make it!  Make sure to not have the heat too high, I imagine that this would burn easily.
