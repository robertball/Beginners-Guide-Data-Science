This recipe was very easy.
As a rule I make my salsa with Roma tomatoes. This year my 4 pack of Romas had 2 Cherry tomato plants and 2 Romas instead of 4 Romas!
I never thought cherry tomatoes would make very good salsa. Too much skin. Not so. This salsa is delicious. 
I usually try a new plant every year in the garden. This year I am trying a new recipe as well.

Curse you, Chef John!  :) This was so incredible I'll never be able to get away with store-bought salsa again.  

The only change I made was to use a few fresh oregano leaves instead of the dried.  Absolutely superb.

It's a great way to use all those cherry tomatoes!  I wish I had read all the reviews first, as 3 jalapeños makes it too hot for my taste, but otherwise, it's great.

I followed the recipe but used 2 lbs of plum tomatoes, and added two poblano peppers.  Roasting took 10 minutes.  Would recommend not adding the garlic cloves until other veggies are turned at 5 minutes in.  When put into the blender, the mix was too dry to “flow” in the blender.  Added a can of tomato paste thinned with about 3/4 cup of water and two tsp of olive oil.  Still quite thick.  Great taste.

This Salsa recipe is Amazing.!! Best I've ever had. I did tweek it a bit.....I added 1 Large Jalepeno and a 1-tomatillo to the roasted portion and 1 Medium sized garden fresh Tomato (unroasted) to "thin" the salsa. Note: I did not use three Jalepenos......thank God because mine is plenty hot. I used 2 Pablano peppers, 2 Serrano Peppers and 1 Jalepeno Pepper total. And yes, leave the seeds in them.

Great salsa and easy to make. 

I’ve made this a couple times already and will make it again today. 

1 word of caution, if you make this as directed, I would suggest you do it when nobody is home or when people can stay out of the kitchen as the charring, burning peppers release a lot of their spiciness into the air. I actually tried this with a single habanero pepper and while it wasn’t too hot to eat, it was really miserable to walk around in the kitchen and surrounding area for a while, coughing and hacking. 

I’d like to make this on the grill soon.

Excellent and easy to make salsa. After making it a few times as is, I added some extra heat by putting in a fresh whole cayenne pepper instead of the dried cayenne, it was great!

Great salsa. I made with garden ingredients so no cherry tomatoes and no jalapeños so used regular tomatoes and pablano peppers.

I'm so glad i read the reviews on spiciness. I only added 3/4 of a large jalapeno, barely any seeds, and it was enough for me.  Also, i broiled in my little convection oven, about 3 inches from the broiler, and it still took about 16 minutes to get the charred look in the video. This was a nice change from my usual pico de gallo. Thanks Chef John!

In the blender, I used two roasted ghost peppers for "kick".   After blending, I also simmer it on the stove in a pot for almost an hour, adding a tiny bit of rosemary, sage, salt, and pepper.  Then I can it in mason/ball jars.  I also made a version with Scorpion Peppers!

I also did not include three jalapeños, but one, because of my young children. I doubled the tomatoes because I had them on hand, and I believe it made for a thinner consistency than it would have been using only one pint. (Though no thinner than store bought salsas.) Flavor was very good!

Relatively straightforward recipe.  Used gold cherry tomatoes from our garden and fresh oregano was only change.  Canned two 1/2 pint jars and ate the rest.

REALLY GOOD FAST EASY. We loved this. I had many plum tomatoes to use up. I BBQ and served with sausage.
1 jalapeño and no cumin. Perfect.  Never waste a few ripe
tomatoes. This is fast and easy and will have many uses.

This is an easy salsa to make.  It does have a powerful spiciness to it so cut down on the jalapeños if heat bothers you.  Also make sure all your ingredients are all roasted evenly under the broiler.

Very delicious!  I didn't have enough cherry tomatoes so I sliced regular tomatoes and roasted extra long to get that char.  Best salsa I think I've ever had!

I tripled the recipe and added about 1 cup of spicy tomato juice blend to the tripled recipe so there would be enough to can as we had probably a gallon or more of these grape tomatoes to use up and more to pick.  My husband loves it

Chef John has yet to steer me wrong, and this recipe is evidence. Beautiful, complex flavour and a good amount of heat. My husband has requested that this salsa replace the jarred stuff from now on. I'm just wondering if I can can it!

This was my first attempt at salsa, prompted by all the peppers I got in my farm box one week. Because that's what I had on had, I used a mix of hot peppers (not just jalapenos.) I was really happy with the result. The tomatoes and garlic balances well with the peppers so this salsa isn't too spicy.  I will be making this one again!

Great flavor and so simple to prepare.  I used this salsa as a complement to baked cod and haddock.
 Broiling added a lovely flavor to the vegetables. I did reduce the cilantro and skipped the salt  to suit my taste.

Delicious! I wanted to use up some garden veggies, so I used about 2 cups of cherry tomatoes, a golden tomato, a regular tomato and I added a habanero. My mouth is on fire, my eyes are watering, and I keep coughing a little haha its so great I LOVE it. Thanks for this recipe idea!!

I didn't have all the fresh chili's I needed, so added some canned after roasting the tomatoes, onion, and jalapenos. 
It turned out good, my husband really likes it and I will make it again, but with more tomatoes and jalapenos.

I made this salsa because I had vegetables that were on the verge of going bad so I used vine ripened tomatoes instead of cherry. All the other ingredients remained the same!!! It turned out amazingly delicious!!! I fried my own tortilla chips too. It is definitely my new go to chips and salsa recipe!!!! Loved it!!!
