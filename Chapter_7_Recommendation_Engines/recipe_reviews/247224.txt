This needs a tad more soy sauce and could maybe benefit with a little sesame oil. The carrots take the longest to cook and need added first. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing!

Family loved it.  We are gluten-free/soy-free so this was great - switched up the soy sauce to coconut aminos.  I also used scallops instead of squid.  I didn't follow any of the directions - just the ingredient list and this was amazing!!! Super easy and the flavors were amazing.  Coconut aminos mixed with the peppers gave a sweet and spicy flavor. This a very light, beautiful dish.  I am not a fan of soy sauce  (the soy or the harsh flavor) so I was really happy with the result that I got.  You can't mess this up.
