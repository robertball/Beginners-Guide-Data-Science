I really liked this revipe.. But I felt that it needed more liquid and flavor. So I added a little extra milk and oil then some orange and almond extract. It was such a huge hit with my family! I believe i also cut back on one egg. I didn't want it cakey. :)

I followed the directions, but it didn't turn out well.  It was really thick/dense, and tasted really flour-y.
