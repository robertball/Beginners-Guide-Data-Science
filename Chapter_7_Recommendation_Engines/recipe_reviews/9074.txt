This is a fairly well known dish in the South and I have made it many times. My tweaks... Use pineapple tibits, the chunks are a little big and the crushed is not quite right either. I always use extra sharp cheddar. It's always great. Always use the brand name Ritz crackers. The topping is a significant part of the flavor combo and you can tell the difference with store brand crackers. I have taken this to potlucks but it's not very eye catching and may not get eaten because it is hard to identify on sight. One reviewer suggested marischino cherries. I love that idea and it adds the needed color and you know right away it's not scalloped potatoes! It is sweet so not a side dish that you would make often, but really good for a change of pace.

I have used this recipe for years and it is always a hit.  For Thanksgiving/Christmas I add dried cranberries to the pineapple mixture and sprinkle chopped pecans on top of the cracker topping.  This one is a must on my holiday table!

This delightful dish has become a favorite with my family!  It's sweet, rich and not exactly healthy but a great treat.  Makes a unique potluck idea: there won't be duplicates!!  
Good idea to mix first flour & butter, then add sugar & juice, then pineapples and last fold in cheese - nice smooth texture this way.  (Though I've also mixed it all right in the casserole for a super quick dish! Never had a problem that way either!)
By the way, it only serves four in this house! ;)  I would double it to share.

My grandma always made this for holidays.  I'm asked for the recipe everytime I make it!  The only diffence is I double this recipe, use 1/2 pineapple chunks & 1/2 crushed pineapple, & melt butter to mix w/ crushed crackers for topping.  YUM!

My family LOVED this recipe.  I melted the butter and then whisked the flour into that.  This avoided the raw flour taste.  I added a little butter to the Ritz cracker crumbs and everyone loved this.  Thanks for a great recipe Tracee.

This was excellent. I made it as a side dish with meatloaf and everyone loved it!! Will definitely pass on the recipe and continue to make myself! I would consider adding nuts in the future.

Absolutely yummy!  I took this to a potluck right before Thanksgiving and was asked for the recipe by several women who wanted something different for their Thanksgiving dinners.

Loved it!  My family liked it so much that they asked me to put it on the Thanksgiving menu.  I used tidbits instead of chunks and followed another reviewer's recommendation to mix flour with butter, then add sugar and juice, before combining with pineapple and cheese.  Great recipe - Thanks!!

Oh Wow!!  This was *really* good...reminded me a lot of hawaian(sp) pizza, which is my all time favorite!  I used splenda instead of sugar (as it was what i found first groping around in the cupboard) and it turned out great!  Had no problems getting my bf and friend to eat it...next time i think i'll try adding canadian bacon a/o ham and maybe some pizza sauce??  Served with Cheese Vegatable soup and shrimp scampi baked (see reviews)  Will DEFINATELY make this again!

This was AWFUL. I don't know why it got such great reviews. We served this with ham on Easter, no one touched more than their first sample bite. Good thing I brought an extra can of pineapples! I'll stick with my gut instinct next time and ignore reviewers' rave comments.

I had so many people request that I bring this dish when we were invited over for a dinner for Thanksgiving or Christmas that I can no longer eat it.  It is AWESOME but I have now had my fill of it...until next year.  Yummy!  I think I gave this recipe out at least  a dozen times between Christmas and New Years Eve.

The initial taste was great but then it had a really bitter aftertaste. I was so disappointed as I was really looking forward to this recipe after I saw all the rave reviews. I made it with fresh pineapple so that may have been my problem. I will try again with canned maybe.

Made this with fresh pineapple. Yuck. Am going to the store to buy canned pineapple and try this recipe again.  Day later, made with 1 can of pineapple tidbits.  Delicious! I made too much topping.  For Christmas I will double the recipe except the topping.  Was a one star recipe with fresh pineapple but with canned it's great.  I used cheap cheese and it didn't melt.  Will try a higher quality next time.  Made 3rd time double batch using 2 cans of tidbits and 1 stick of butter and 1 sleeve of ritz crackers.  Too much butter though.  Also added about 10 marachino cherries on top of the casserole for presentation.  Have to be careful who you are cooking for as some people don't like those cherries.

YUM!  I made this for my (very large) family Christmas dinner and it was a hit!!!  Even the skeptics in the family went back for more.  We always have ham on Christmas and this is the PERFECT accompaniment to it.  Many requested that this be a staple for Christmases to come.  I highly recommend it...Thanks for sharing, Tracee!  :)

SO GOOD!! I never have even heard of this dish and it was so easy and very rewarding!! Thanks for the tip to mix in some dried cranberries and then top with pecans. I will absolutely be adding this to our Christmas table every year! Note: if taking for potluck or making for large family you need to at least double the recipe.

Both sweet and savory. A good alternative for a traditional holiday sweet potato dish for those without much of a sweet tooth.

This recipe is a keeper for sure. I made it last year. It was the first time I had made thanksgivng dinner. I can not tell you how many people have called and asked me for this recipe. Everyone who is coming for thanksgiving this yr has called to make sure I am making it again this yr as well. I tripled the recipe last yr and it was still gone. This recipe is great for more than just thanksgiving too. We have it with Ham or  when we have a bbq as well. It is an all around great recipe

This is fabulous with baked ham and green beans.  It is a nice change from mac and cheese or mashed potatoes.  I too mix the butter, flour and sugar then add the pineapple and fold in the cheese.  If you melt your butter in the casserole and coat the dish with the butter then mix your ingredents in the dish you save the extra clean up.  The cherries are a nice visual topper.  My little boys love this as does my husband.

I have 4 sons.  Everyone of us gave it a thumbs down.  We did use a fresh pineapple, but I don't think that would make that big of difference.

This is so-o-o-o good that I honestly find myself hoping others will not like so there's more for me.  (I really shouldn't mention my shortcomings!)  When I first tried this dish several months ago it was a constant on my menus.  That's changed a bit with the summer weather but I look forward to again having it on the table regularly.  It's easily doubled and still disappears remarkably fast.

This is a wonderful sweet, yet tangy and savory accompaniment to holiday hams.  I have served this to my family and at a Christmas party and it is a hit every time.  Everyone loves it.  It is a fresh side dish option at the holidays.  It is perfect just as the recipes states.  I do not change a thing.

Great dish that I served during Thanksgiving dinner.  Something different.  Everyone loved it.  Perfect amount of not too sweet yet tangy.  Easy to prepare.  Will make again.

I made this with fresh pineapple left over from kabobs (needed to bake as people had touched meat when making kabobs). I have to say this was one of the worst recipes I have tried from this website. No one ate any of it. The cheese/butter/cracker sauce was just to wierd tasting.

This was fantastic!  Very easy to make.  I cut back a little on the butter and sugar and it was still great.  I will definitely be making this for Christmas!

I tried this for the first time at a large gathering (took a chance with 60 people) and it was great.  Everyone raved about it and it's a good companion to baked ham.  Will definitely make it again ... in fact at Christmas at our house with a ham !!!!

Yum. This sounded like an odd combo of ingredients but thanks once again to fellow AR's this was great! I served this with spiral ham and it was gobbled up. Made as written and I agree with prior reviews.... You need to double this if serving more than 4. Our greedy 4 ate it up and we're looking for more.

This came out very well. My mom had this at someone else's house and couldn't get the recipe. I found this for her, and she made it for Thanksgiving. She put 4 T butter in the casserole and put 2 T in with the crackers. I told her about some of the reviewers putting marachino cherries on top, and so she tried that; it looked very pretty. It was really good the day it was made, but the crackers are kind of mushy when reheated in the micro for leftovers.

This was very different but we enjoy trying new recipes. The flavors came together quite well.I will make it for our next potluck at work. It was easy to make and the pecans another review suggested gave it a little something extra!

This was pretty good. It has a very interesting, different flavor. I couldn't quite get used to eating cheddar cheese with pineapple, but it wasn't bad. I might make it again.

Wonderful! I had to make a few adjustments based on what was in my pantry. I only had cruashed pineapple. I mixed the flour with 4 T of melted butter, then added the sugar and pineapple juice. Mixed in the pineapple and folded in the cheese (colby and cheddar was what I had). I used Ritz Honey Wheat Crackers. Added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the cracker crumbs. Stirred the last 2 T of melted butter in the cracker crumbs before sprinkling on top. Delicious!!

It was 'ok'. My kids love pineapple and chees and ritz crackers but didn't much care for this dish. I will give it one more try with some adjustments but as it is now I didn't find it all that wonderful.

This is a good baked pineapple recipe, but I felt that it just needed something.  I think it is better if the crackers are mixed in rather than used as a topping.  I will adapt this recipe to my family's tastes and hopefully I won't have to throw any away next time.  Someone else said that the recipe had too much butter.  It seems that way at first, but it is really the perfect amount once you bake it.

I have never had baked pineapple but thought my husband and I would love it since we are such big pineapple fans.....which makes me sad to say that I will never make this recipe ever again. I followed th recipe exactly and did not enoy the combination of pineapple, cheese, crackers, and sooooo much butter. I think this is the first negative review I have ever left on allrecipes but we were both very disappointed.

I had never heard of baked pineapple. It sounded weird  but I read  all the reviews and I had all th ingredients. I didn't tell anyone what was in it and they loved it. When I let them know that there was cheese and crackers in it everyone said"Ewe". I will make it again.

This deserves 10 stars.  Only change I made was to double it as 2nds, 3rds and 4ths were requested.  I've been making this recipe every Easter for the past 10 years at least.  This recipe is by far the best!

Incredieble!!! I served this as a side dish to "Cha Cha's White Chicken Chili"! Awesome!!! Made 2 changes, subbed 2 Tablespoons brown sugar instead of 3Tablespoons white sugar, and only used 10 Ritz crackers! This is a keeper! Thank you for sharing!

I changed this so much, I don't even know if it's fair to rate it, but it was GOOD. I used cream cheese instead of regular and instead of crackers, I crushed Special K and mixed with melted butter.  I mixed everything together and baked.  Everyone (even non-creamcheese eaters liked it)  It's also very good cold.

This recipes is so good! I had to use mozza cheese because I had no cheddar on hand, and it was great! The only thing I would change is to use less cracker crumbs. YUMMY!

Really good, but it kind of lacked something.  I've never had this before so I am not sure what it was supposed to end up like - went well with the ham, but I would like to try another recipe that I have which includes some bread cubes.  Thanks though, this one was really good!

Yummy and a nice change for a side dish.  I lightened it up a bit by using only 4 tbsp of butter and 1 tbsp sugar, used 1 tbsp extra juice.  Didn't seem to change the overall flavor at all!

Definitely a 5 star recipe.  Quite good!  I made it exactly following the directions and it was superb.  I can see why other reviewers recommend tidbits...the chunks were a little big.  And, I think next time I make it I'll cut back on the butter by a tablespoon and see how it comes out.  My adventurous husband took one bite and said, "interesting".  When I asked to clarify if it was interesting good or interesting bad, he replied that he thought it was going to be mac and cheese, but once he got over the surprise of it being pineapple, he really liked it.  So if you're serving to a crowd, you might want to make sure the dish is labeled!  Thanks for the delightful recipe.

This is an amazing dish. The pineapple with cheddar with ritz crackers is an awesome combination. Who knew?? I would never have made this had I not read the reviews and now I am so glad I did. However, I would recommend using either crushed pineapple or pineapple rings cut up into small pieces. Pineapple chunks were just too big. It tastes better when everything mixes up. This is great!!!

Love this recipe!!! took it to Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  Make sure not to use too much cheese, or it will be bitter. The right amount makes it perfect, and just milds the sweetness of the pineapple a bit

This is awesome!!  Please make this recipe!!  Don't let the cheese mixed with the pineapple fool you; it's fantastic.  My family freaked over the cheese but within 10 minutes, there was none left.  Next time I need to double the recipe!

Made this for Thanksgiving but it was not a success.  Followed recipe and added maraschino cherries. Used less cheese than recipe called for. After dish assembled it looked a bit dry so I added approx. 1/4 cup more pineapple juice. Did not have room in oven so microwaved (covered with plastic Wrap w/ vent holes) for 10 minutes. Came out too dry. Looked pretty, tasted ok but too dry.  Will make again and add some of the marischino cherry juice also. There was so much going on in the kitchen (and too many people), and the other reviews were so positive, that I will try this again for sure. I really like the addition of the cherries. Thanks for the recipe; I'm sure it will turn out fine next time.

This dish was a hit at our Thanksgiving table.  Guests even asked for the recipe.  But I 'tweaked' the recipe a little: first melt the butter in a saucepan and cook the flour in the butter to form a roux.  Then stir cheese into hot roux.

This recipe looks "weird" at first, but my husband LOVED it.  We had it as a desert instead of a side-dish, and my husband finished his and mine.  Great unique recipe!

I can't believe how good this was.  We had it on Mothers Day with baked ham, broccoli and scalloped potato's and it was my favorite dish of all.  All who tried it loved it but I could not get my son to try it once he found out there was pineapple and cheese mixed together he said "no way", so I think the trick is getting people to try it.  It would make a great addition to any buffet.

I remembered this dish from an event and looked it up here and was so happy to find it.  I can't believe it came out so tasty and so easy to make!  I think it's best served warm, so it's a warm treat in the winter but it could also work for a picnic because it will stay warm in sun and hot weather. 
Thanks, this one will come in handy, often!

VERY GOOD!  I was worried about the combination and my husband almost didn't try it... but boy was he glad when he did!  I persoanlly thought that a little of this went a long way due to the sweetness.  I had over half as left overs when I served it to 4 people.  But that was great becuase it tasted even better the next day.

I found this recipe absolutely wonderful. I made it for my husband, who isn't big on sweets, and he liked it. Kind of a cheesy cobbler.  It's really good and too easy not to try. I'm so pleased i'm baking it for our Thanksgiving potluck at work, but bumping the recipe up 4x, cause I know it will be a hit!

Great potential, but I thought the butter amount together with the butter crackers ended up being too strong over the other ingredients. I'll give it another try with a milder crust (maybe breadcrumbs?)

I made this recipe for two reasons, I had a lot of pineapple I needed to do something with and the recipe was highly rated on this web site.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was horrible! The butter was literally dripping off the pineapple cheese mixture.  Cheddar cheese and pineapple turned out not to be a great flavor combination.  The only part of this that tasted good was the Ritz Cracker topping.

I found this recipe just a few years ago but it quickly became a holiday tradition.  My son asks for it every time.  So quick and easy to whip up and adds something special to the table.

I had fresh pineapple that needed to be used so I went with that. I made a half recipe and added extra pineapple juice (canned) after seeing reviews of it being dry. (Mine came out very moist.)  I added half of the melted butter to the pineapple; the rest I added to the crackers for the topping, also adding a pinch of cinnamon and some sugar. I was thinking along the lines of a 'summer pineapple cobbler' for this, and it worked out well. (In this case, I may skip the cheese the next time...mine was extra sharp and I didn't like that taste here.) Had it with some whipped cream, and I'm sure vanilla ice cream would be great! The cooking time of 30 min worked well for me. Nice recipe, Tracee!

Just so so.  It wasn't touched much, but may have been because the family is more into gravy and cranberry...plus the first person who tried it said it reminded them of Hawaiian pizza...I will make it again sometime, but with crushed pineapple, and maybe to go with ham instead of turkey and potatoes.

Made this for Christmas dinner last year and everyone seemed to enjoy it. I thought it was a good way to get another fruit on the table besides baked apples.

I tried this recipe tonight and instead of Ritz crackers I used honey graham crackers because that's all I had on hand. I wasn't sure how the final product would turn out. I mixed the graham cracker crumbs with melted butter and spread over the pineapple mixture and then baked. It was terrific, and cold might make a great dessert. Gonna find out later tonight. Just wished there was more leftovers.

I make this, but  my recipe combines the flour and sugar witth the reserved pineapple juice and cooks until the sugar melts, then add in the pineapple and cheese.  Pour into a greased casserole, top with crumbs and drizzle  the butter over the top.  Bake .  I don't know if the outcome is any different, but it's delicious!

First time I've ever tried Baked Pineapple, and was pleasantly surprised. Didn't have any "buttery" crackers such as Ritz, so I used what I had- saltine crackers. Definitely think it would be better with the buttery crackers. Yum :)

This is a very good pineapple casserole recipe- I hadn't had it in years- I was baking a Easter ham and my husband loves ham and pineapple- voila! perfect side dish- He had never heard or had this before(he is from upstate New York, don't think they make this there!!) in fact he ate 2 large helpings- only thing I changed is I used club crackers(all I had) and buttered them a little-- they turned out great- Thanks so much

This was very interesting, but not bad at all!  I think it tasted more like a dessert than a side: just add a little whipped cream.  I would use less butter crackers, though.

We really like this recipe, but it is quite sweet and is almost like having dessert!  I was scared about trying this combination of ingredients together, but was pleasantly surprised!  I ended up using only 4 T. of butter, it still tasted good.

I made this with Christmas dinner last night with ham.  It was a huge hit.  Everyone was scared it would be too sweet at first, but it wasn't it went great with the ham.  I added maraschino cherries for color.  My family thinks I'm a great cook but I owe it all to this web site. Thanks

These were good.My 5 year old daughters both loved them which is saying alot. Nobody else though raved about them. I have had a similar version of this recipe before omitting the crackers and I liked it better. I also had used tidbits as suggested but I think chunks would have been better. Still good though,just not a favorite.

This went over well at Easter Dinner.  I, too, was sceptical about the cheese/cracker/pineapple combination, but it really is fantastic.  I used sharp white cheddar & the flavors blended beautifully.  The cracker topping complimented the other flavors & texture.  This may well become a holiday staple at our house.  Thanks!

This one was a hit with our Christmas ham dinner.  My family likes to stick with traditional dishes for the holidays and isn't usually up for trying something new.  But every once in a while I get to sneak one in.  This one was a definite hit.  Now, it will be one of the usual dishes for Christmas.

Quick, easy, and very tasty! Don't be afraid of the cheddar; the flavors all meld together and one cannot detect the taste of the cheese (I used a plain white cheddar). I also drizzled a little butter over the top of the Ritz (as suggested by another member) Its going to be a new tradition with our Christmas Ham dinner!

I made this thinking that it would be absolutely delicious after reading the reviews and was not at all disappointed.  It was good, despite the fact that pineapple and cheese don't sound like they go together well.  I would make this again for Thanksgiving, but probably not for a regular family meal.  It was good to have on our buffet table!

I got alot of "ewwws and ahhhs" from this recipe!  Made it with Thanksgiving dinner again this year even though no Ham was served!  I will try mixing the crackers with butter next time for the top of the casserole.

FABULOUS!  Sounded strange but I trusted the other reviews and I'm gald I did.  I took this to two separate Thanksgiving dinners and it was a hit at both.  This will definitely become a staple in my recipe collection.

This was wonderful! It really IS like a dessert but still a very nice side dish.  My entire family loved it and begged me to make it again - soon.  Would be great with a ham dinner or porkchops.  If you want to completely impress your family, friends, co-workers, in-laws then make it for them.  This is going to become a tradition in our family!

This was very good but I think I prefer the pineapple stuffing recipes which have bread in them. Nothing wrong with the recipe and it was very tasty. I would make it again.

This was great.  The taste was wonderful--a nice addition to the table.  I took the advice of others and mixed the flour, cheese, and sugar before mixing with the pineapple.  I used frozen shredded cheese and it turned out great.  I served it with the main course but I think next time I'll serve as a desert b/c it is pretty sweet.  Overall a great recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

I was skeptical about this recipe, but needed to bring something to the office holiday party. I had about 7 people ask me for the recipe. Everyone thought it was great, but I thought it was just ok. Maybe I dont like pineapple?  It was super easy to make. I scaled the recipe to make 18 servings.

Thank you Tracee!  This was awesome with our ham dinner.  Doubled the recipe, made it just as she said and it turned out perfect.  It was almost gone with only 11 adults!  I will make this one again and again.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I thought it seemed a little odd, but tried it because it had so many good reviews, and was so glad I did.  I halved the recipe, and wound up eating most of it myself on the first day.  It's pretty good heated up, too, but definitely better the first time around.

I served this as a side dish (with ham) for Christmas.  Even though I doubled the recipe, there wasn't even a bite left--everyone raved about it and told me to "feel free to make this again."  And I will!

Surprisingly good.  Very, very easy.  Tastes almost like a cobbler.  Made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  Took home the remnants and ate it for dessert.  Thanks!

Who would have thought pineapple and cheese could taste so good together? The flavors blended wonderfully. I also drizzled about a teaspoon of butter over the cracker crumbs and the whole thing turned out great - everyone loved it. We had it with grilled salmon with an Asian soy sauce glaze - delicious!

The flour gave a pasty taste to this dish.  Plain, unadorned pineapple is better.

I'm not so keen on sweet potatoes but wanted something on the sweeter side for my Thanksgiving meal so I decided to try this.  I LOVED it!!!!  Like others, I was skeptical but figured it was so easy I wouldn't be losing much if it was terrible.  Well, it was great and I think I ate more of this than turkey or stuffing or anything else!!!  Will definitely make this a part of future holiday meals as well as everyday meals!

This is really tasty.  I was skeptical, but since it looked so easy, I decided to try it to serve with pork chops.  I figured that if we didn't like it, the investment was small.  I used a little less butter, substituted 3 tablespoons Splenda for the sugar.  I also did not have any crackers on hand so I topped it with corn flake crumbs.  I definitly will make it again.  Even picky husband liked it.

The surprise hit of the dinner.  I only made it because I had all the ingredients sitting around, and we ran out of this!  It tastes like Hawaiian Pizza.

I LOVED this recipe! I had never even tasted this dish, much less made it, but it sounded interesting so I tried it. It was quick and very tasty. A big hit at the family dinner!
