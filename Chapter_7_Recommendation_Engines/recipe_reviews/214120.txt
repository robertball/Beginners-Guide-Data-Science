Really tasty.  I used Japanese eggplant because that is what is in my garden.  I sliced them in half lengthwise and baked them skin side up on a cookie sheet sprayed with Pam until they were soft at 350. I then spread with pesto and broiled briefly.  I think the Japanese eggplant have a milder flavor and thinner skin.  We had one eggplant per person.

This is wonderful with broiled lamb chops.  If you don't like lamb it is also is great with a nice steak and an herb salad with feta cheese. This is really nice and wonderful for summer.

As impressive looking as it is delicious. I served with fish and a tomato/onion salad.  Had some pesto on hand and may have used a bit more than recipe. We have small eggplants in our garden and will have this meal again!

Fantastic! Having little experience with preparing eggplant, I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was. I paired the eggplant with egg noodles (covered in the extra pesto)and also some cherry tomatoes that were sauteed in the same oil with the eggplant. I'll definitely be making this dish again!

Delicious!  I found that 1 eggplant was enough for 2 people, and maybe next time I'll bake the eggplant instead of frying (just to cut back on the oil).  But I loved this recipes!!

Simple and delicious , my friends loved it.
 good eggplant recipes are hard to come by so I decided to become a member to show my appreciation for this recipe. 
only changes made as other reviewers suggested - salt eggplant for 30mins wash and pat dry, heat in 400f for 20mins, used store bought pesto and crushed some pine-nuts on top.

This was delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and the eggplant did not get tender enough with the time given.  I will definitely make this again and make sure I fry it until it's really soft.  I served it with polenta - really went well together.

Delicious! I made exactly as written, served it as the main dish on top of arugula as she suggested, (no dressing needed) put a sprinkle of goat cheese just for fun. Will definitely make again! One large eggplant split between two of us was the perfect size.

I grow basil and various varieties of eggplant each summer on my patio in pots. This recipe has become my new favorite for both, although I use my own recipe for the pesto and I adjust the amount of eggplant I cook.  Two black beauties can easily serve 4-6 as a side dish.  I prefer smaller varieties.  I freeze enough pesto during the summer to last all year.  If you use a nonstick pan, you can cut back on the oil considerably.  Remember that olive oil is good for you.  I make sure the eggplant is cooked through before I put it in the oven.  I lathe on the pesto.  Rather than broil it, I bake it at 400.  Wasn't sure pesto could handle broiling.  This recipe is a welcome change to the usual tomato sauce and cheese recipes.  I wish I could thank the submitter personally for this recipe.  I've probably made it 4 times in the last two weeks.  This recipe wins over people who aren't that fond of eggplant.  Thank you so much!!!!!!

I added some spinach  as I made the puree and it made it more nutritious and I also added goat cheese along with the  parmesan cheese. I wanted to add a little smoked gouda but forgot to add it~
The Best Eggplant Recipe  and it even beat out Baba Ganoush.....Thanks You for this delicious side dish.

Great way to use my basil and eggplants.
Eggplant absorbed all the oil so no need to drain.

Possibly it should be mentioned not to eat the eggplant skin.

I didn't like the fact that it had all that oil, which eggplant absorbs like a sponge. I didn't think it was worth the effort it took to make.  I tossed it in the trash after eating only 1/4 of it.

I made this one also 2 summer's ago and it was the only eggplant dish my husband liked.
