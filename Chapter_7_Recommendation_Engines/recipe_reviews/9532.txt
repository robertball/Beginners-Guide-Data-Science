This recipe is absolutely fantastic!  It's easy to make and tastes terrific, but my favorite thing about it is its versatility.  You can substitute pretty much any flavor for the chocolate chips (peanut butter, mint, all milk chocolate or all dark) to make great fudge variations.  You can also make double-layered fudge very easily.  For example, I put 12 oz peanut butter chips and half the marshmallow in one bowl and 12 oz milk chocolate chips and half the marshmallow in another.  Then after boiling the sugar mixture, I poured half into each bowl.  I spread the milk chocolate mixture on the bottom of the pan and the peanut butter on top and ran a knife through to swirl it (I omitted the nuts).  Delicious!

Made this last night for the first time, but forgot the cardinal rule of candy making "Never make fudge when it is raining."  I was afraid it would not lose its gloss and firm up because of the humidity.  I left it in the covered glass (13x9) dish overnight and this morning it had "fudged up" perfectly.  It is very rich and deeply chocolate and may be the best fudge I have ever made.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is a great easy fudge recipe.  I found that if you boiled it for six minutes the texure was wrong it was too hard.  my husband says I am too picky, but I boil it for four minutes and forty five seconds.  It is also great with white chocolate chips on top, it looks really pretty. Great christmas gifts.

This fudge is so rich, you might pass out. It was a little too rich, in fact, for my taste, but it gets 5 stars from me because it's really, really easy (no candy thermometer required), takes about 10 minutes from start to finish, and most of the people who tried it said it was drop-dead delicious. So I suggest you give it a try and see if it's for you. You might just think it's the best fudge you've ever tasted.

No thermometer needed here -- I've been making this recipe for years, calling it Million Dollar Fudge from President Eisenhower.  It's the best!  I am asked for the recipe always, and it makes a GREAT gift done up in colored plastic wrap and ribbon.  VERY creamy, smooth and rich -- better than any others!!  You can use walnuts.  And I've always cooked it 7 minutes.

Couldn't find "sweet german choco" so I just used all semi-sweet chips.  Turned out GREAT.  Very creamy and a huge hit.  I split the recipe while pouring and made 1/2 w/o nuts.

This recipe is fabulous!  I don't think I've ever received so many compliments on anything I've made.  It was so easy, and it turned out perfectly.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I did find it a bit confusing though - this was my first fudge attempt ever - so I just stirred fairly constantly from the time I put the sugar mixture over heat until the six minutes of boiling time were done.  It did take a while to start boiling... This is my new holiday treat!  And it tastes almost identical to my grandma's fudge.  :)  Thanks!

YUMMY!  I was worried that either it would be too soft or that the sugar would be grainy because these things always happen to my fudge, but it turned out perfect.  I gave it away along with cookies for Christmas.  This is our new fudge recipe!

Shared with friends, family and co-workers at Christmas+.  Came out perfectly!  Received rave reviews even by fudge "experts".  (Sprayed non-stick spray into the mixing bowl to prevent sticking).

This is an excellent recipe. For 35 years I have made fudge from scratch, where you cook until a certain stage, then beat until the right consistancy. This is the first quick recipe that tastes right and it is the German chocolate that is the secret. This recipe saves so much trouble and my shoulders. I have two tips. #1; if your fudge is sugary, next time add a tablespoon of light (clear) corn syrup when you begin to cook it.  # 2; Don`t make fudge on a rainy day.  Humidity is a huge factor in fudge and fudge will need longer cooking with high humidity, 5-6 minutes with low. I used one bag of milk chocolate chips, one semi-sweet, and the German chocolate and it tastes like my old recipe.  Thank you for sharing it!

This fudge was absolutely awesome!!! I've only made fudge a few times and always with a microwave, never on the stove top. I followed the recipe exactly, letting the sugar boil for 6 minutes from a full boil. I read somewhere that stirring the sugar makes your fudge grainy, so I left the sugar alone the entire 6 minutes. The grocery was sold out of German chocolate, so I used milk chocolate instead and it was great. I think this recipe would work well with any chocolate substitute. This recipe was so simple... no candy thermometers, no ball stages... and it makes fudge that you could have bought in a candy shop. The two important things to remember: 1. Be prepared. Have everything set up and ready to go before you start cooking the sugar. 2. Your fudge is only as good as the ingredients. It's so simple that skimping on the ingredients (buying cheap chocolate) will really show through.

I made this twice in a week and it just flew. If you have it, do use the whole 12 oz of German Chocolate and the semi-sweet chips (or dark chips if you have those instead). I added 1 cup of chopped pecans and 1 cup of shredded coconut at the end and mixed to incorporate. SO GOOD! One hint - this makes a whole whole lot. Almost my whole 9x13 pan was full to the top. If I did it again, I'd line a half sheet pan with parchment and spread it thinner. I think the texture would improve then, too. Very very good recipe, and so easy!

First time fudge maker here.  My husband had asked for some and I have to make it due to peanut allergies in our son.  I could not find allergen safe german chocolate, so I subbed some milk chocolate and dark chocolate chips.  Also used walnuts since Hubby likes them better.  I lined my dish(13x9) with foil too.  Lots of stirring!  So worth it!  Amazing and easy.  I had no idea fudge was so simple.  This will make it into my xmas cookie trays for sure!  I had to freeze most of it since we were eating to much so quickly.  Excellent no fail from what I can see.

Wonderful recipe, wouldn't change a thing.  A few suggestions - Place the fluff in the microwave for about 20-30 seconds to loosen the consistency a bit, it'll make it easier to remove from the jar. I cooked the stove top ingredients for six minutes after they just began to boil.  I've made this recipe a number of times now and line my pan with parchment paper and spritz it with cooking spray & it's a snap to remove, it cuts very well too.  By the way, the fudge does set up quickly, you can notice the top of it begin to set and crack while mixing.  I've made variations of this fudge, pecan rocky road with mini marshmallows and peanut butter fudge (heaping spoonfuls of creamy peanut butter swirled into the fudge) with Reese's peanut butter chips on top.  I add this to my Christmas cookie plates now every year and it's a favorite of all!  Enjoy...

I had trouble with this. I am a first time fudge maker, and my fudge was too soft. It never firmed up. I did the directions exactly the way it said. I'm not sure what went wrong. I like the taste of it... but i don't know what happened. I will try to make it again.  I will give it 4 stars on taste. can someone help me with this?

I hate that you have to pay to customize these recipes.  Be forewarned, I did change a few things.  I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 pan lined with parchment paper.  I only used 5 oz of chopped pecans and used a 1/3 cup of coconut.  I toasted them for about 5 minutes in the toaster oven.  I brought the syrup to 234 degrees (not necessarily 6 mins) and added the syrup to the chocolate and marshmallow and mixed well with a spoon.  Then I moved the thermometer to  the fudge letting the temp drop to 130 degrees.  I mixed the fudge in my KA mixer until the shine is gone, about 3-4 minutes.  Then I quickly mixed in the nuts.   With the changes, I'd give the recipe 5 stars, but the first time I made it, I cooked only for the 6 minutes and it was a grainy mess.

this recipe is exceptionally easy to make, I did change it, however, over the christmas holidays.  I used an entire toblerone chocolate bar instead of the baker's squares(the biggest one you can get)it was so good that I almost didn't want to give it away to people!

My family loves this. I substituted bittersweet chocolate chips for the German sweet chocolate because I had a hard time finding it. I also added one teaspoon vanilla to the recipe. We cut into it after about 6 hours in the frig but it wasn't quite chilled enough. It's definitely better to chill over night before serving.

I've used a recipe almost like this for over 40 yrs., and it is the BEST!! But the recipe I use is "Mamie Eisenhower's Million Dollar Fudge". And here's the difference:
 1. Use 3 pkgs. of German Sweet Chocolate Bars.
 2. Do not try to stir this by hand. Put both of the chocolates, the marshmellow cream, and "chopped 'black' walnuts in a large mixing bowl, and pour the hot syrup over this mixture and beat with mixer until the chocolate is melted.
 3. Never make this on a rainy or humid day.
 4. And "NEVER" stir boiling syrup, it will amke it grainy.

Perfect texture, very tasty.  I used a cheaper, non-German chocolate to melt into it, and it still tastes wonderful!

I couldn't find the sweet chocolate, so substituted milk chocolate chips for that.  It turned out great, I gave some away as gifts...several of my friends from Michigan thought it was just like the Mackinac Island Fudge that you find in Michigan....I thought it was better than that!  I heated mine to the soft ball stage, around 235 degrees with a candy thermometer...thought that took about the same amount of time as what was in the recipe.

Very good fudge.  Using only chocolate chips tastes just as good for a cheaper option.  I'm adding this my cookbook.  Thanks!

This recipe is excellent!  And easy!  I followed the recipe exactly - the only thing I did differently was to follow the suggestions of some other reviewers and line my pan with aluminum foil - it makes getting the fudge out of the pan easier.  I brought this fudge into work the next day and two people told me it is the best fudge they've ever had.  Definitely a keeper.

This recipe was fabulous. I followed the cooking time exactly, and it turned out wonderful. I did leave out the nuts. I also halved the chocolate chips and put in a bag of heath bar pieces too. Also I found that the german chocolate melted very quickly and smoothly by first smashing it to little tiny pieces with my kitchen hammer (while still in its wrapper). This left me with plenty of time to get it into my heavy duty non stick reynolds foil wrapped pan before it hardened. I put it in the fridge for a couple of hours to set, and it cut up beautifully. I had soooo many compliments on this recipe. It's a keeper.

This was so delicious!! It was so easy and fast to make! So creamy and smooth. I am so glad that it was not one of those candy recipes where you have to CONSTANTLY stir it for almost an hour...and this recipe made a lot for a little bit of work! Everyone loved it! GREAT recipe!

This was a very nice recipe to work with and came together very well.  The recipe states to boil 6 min. and for my own edification, I timed it and used a candy thermometer.  Temperature hovered just under the soft ball stage at 235 so I let it boil another couple of minutes until it reached 235F. Fudge set up well.  Very good flavor. BF and friends at work really enjoyed this.  Makes a lot so it's great for making as gifts.  I'll make this again.

Very good fudge!  I was worried that it would turn out grainy, but it was very smooth and creamy.  The recipe was a tad confusing, but I must have followed it right, because it turned out great.  It did take a while to start boiling as other people wrote. Once it was at a pretty good bubbly boil, I boiled it for 5 minutes.  Make sure you stir constantly.  I had no trouble finding German chocolate.  I think I used Bakers.  And for the chocolate chips, I used Ghirardeli.  I've found that if you use cheap chocolate, it'll taste like cheap chocolate.  I also ended up making half with nuts, half without.  Both were good.  These are a Christmas present for my in-laws, and I'm sure they'll love it!  If not, I'll just eat it all! :-)

I just made this earlier today and this was just AWESOME and DELICIOUS!! I have tried to make fudge before and it came out too soft! So ive stayed away from making it unntil this year... my only sujjestion for first time fudge makers is to make sure after you have poored the syrup into the chocolate that you have a helper to hold the HOT bowl for you into the pan, Because it hardens up FAST! And i made a really big mess :) Other then that i followed the recipe egzactly and made sure to consistently stir. Thanks Cathy!!! This will be a holiday fav for years to come...

**One other sujjestion I have is to boil for 5 minutes instead of 6 min. I made two batches and the first one got a little dry within 2 days the second batch has stayed moist that I boiled for 5 minutes! :)

Great recipe, very rich.  I followed the suggestion of some and cut it into small servings and also poured it into 2 8x8 pans vs. the 1 large pan.  If you aren't planning on taking any into the office or to a party you may want to cut the recipe in 1/2.  Thanks again, this was awesome!

This was very easy and I loved how easily it set up and the creamy texture, but the kicker was that my picky brother-in-law really liked it.  He says he does not like fudge because it always has a gritty texture and this had no grit at all.  I'll make it again!

make sure when you use your skillet that it's a LARGE skillet because as the mixture boils it expands.

I brought this to German class. It's a great recipe and the fudge freezes well if you're like me and you have occasional chocolate craving binges--it'll keep until you really want it, or until you have a mug of hot lemon tea in your hand. You might have to hide it, though.

I made this and "Remarkable Fudge" for Christmas gifts and this one was MUCH better. Plus it was easier too. I haven't made many different kinds of fudge but I am starting to think that I don't really like recipes with the marshmellow cream in them. This has it but was still yummy, I just think the cream changes the texture and it's not as smooth as it should be. In both recipes, as soon as I added the cream, it looked like it was beginning to sugar, (which it wasn't) but I think next time I want marshmellows, I will look for a recipe that folds in mini-marshmellows instead. This is still a good recipe when making in mass.

The first time I made this recipe exactly as directed. 5 stars!! Second and third time I made as directed 5 + 5 stars!  4th time I thought I'd go cheap on the chocolate and used milk chocolate instead of the German chocolate. I regret to say that the last of it sat very long without being eaten. It eventually got moldy and I tossed it. I learned to STICK TO THE RECIPE! It's perfect as stated!

I substituted a bag of milk chocolate chips for the German's chocolate, and got some "all natural" marshmallow creme from Whole Foods.  I had to refridgerate the fudge in order for it to set enough to cut.  Then I packaged it cold, sent it 2-day mail to my dad for Father's Day, and crossed my fingers.  He loved it.  My parents said it was the best fudge they ever had!

FABULOUS!  I added one cup of coconut to it so it was like a German Chocolate Cake!  It seemed to harden before I got it out of the pan almost so next time I will reduce the cooking to 5 minutes.  Great recipe!  It is going on my Christmas baking/candy list!!!

This fudge was very good.  The only problem I had was cutting it.  It didn't set very well and waited about a day before cutting it, still did not cut very clean.

This is SO easy to make.  It only took me about 20 mins total to make the fudge, and I let it sit over night to firm up. It's very smooth, not crumbly at all, and has a great flavor. Makes a ton, so you can give it out as gifts.

This will become my staple chocolate fudge recipe from now on.  It sets up very well but has a nice creamy texture that makes it easy to cut.  It makes a large pan of fudge so it's great for using during the holidays when your giving holiday goodies to friends and family.  And it's delicious!!!

This fudge is absolutely dangerous! There are so many spoon marks around the edges of the pan from my husband and me. We're too impatient to let it set. Will definitely be making again!

It was OK, but maybe I was setting my expectations a little too high.  It wasn't by any means BAD, just not as good as I thought it would be.

I have been making this exact recipe for years and it has always turned out perfect.    The german chocolate is a must. I use aluminum foil pans, I find it easier to remove the fudge from them.  I put nuts in only half the batter so my allergic family members can also enjyoy this wonderful fudge.

This came out very runny.  It never set and it never blended together well. I did use low fat evaporated milk instead of the regular so maybe this was the reason.

My family couldn't keep their hands off of this, which we all know means...exactly what you want from a recipe!!  It set fairly quickly, but not quick enough for us, so I froze it for 20 minutes or so to be able to eat it sooner.

This is the best fudge I've ever made *and* ever tasted.  I added a little coconut in the mix after I added the pecans.  It is divine.  My husband agreed 100% with me. :)

I had to make it twice for it to turn out. The first time, I boiled it too long (7 minutes) and it was crumbly. I watched the chocolate seize up as I stirred. After using google and reading an allrecipes tutorial on fudge, I used a candy thermometer that I'd calibrated for my high altitude (4500 feet). Turns out that boiling for 6 minutes really is the perfect time. It's just barely softball stage. Then, I poured it on top of my chocolate and marshmallow mixture and let it sit until it had cooled to 110 degrees before I stirred it. I'm not sure which alteration made it work (boiling for the correct time or waiting to stir it) but the second time it turned out fantastic. So creamy and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I can't wait to eat it!

Everything looked good during preparation.  It is very creamy, but did not set firmly and had to be refrigerated.  We used Ghirardelli semi-sweet chips and Lindt bars.  If soft, it would make a really great filling for other recipes.

I have always been a big fan of fudge but my family doesn't like it much.  This christmas I decided to make fudge and take it to work where I was sure that it would be eaten. Less than three hours into the shift it was gone.  I had never made fudge and was being told that my fudge was better than their grandmother's.  This recipe is amazing. They beg me for more almost every day I go into work.

I had a hard time stirring the marshmallow creme, and couldn't find german chocolate, so I substituted milk choc. chips. It came out a bit too soft. Good flavor, though, next time I will use real german chocolate, and add more nuts.

This was OK fudge.  Have had better.  The texture was a little dry and the flavor was definately chocolatey.  Will probably not make again.

This had an excellent flavor and extremely rich.  I loved it.  My only problem with it was that it was a little gooey, I followed the directions to the letter...I made another type of fudge the same day and it didn't come out like that, so I don't think it was a weather thing.  Oh well, messy but yummy will make again.  Thanks for the post!

With the exception of the amount of sugar, I followed the directions on this recipe but the fudge did not get hard. I used half the sugar. It was soupy after a few hours of sitting. I had to throw it in the garbage. I do not understand what I did wrong, if anything.

This makes a ton! Unless you want a large amount, I would half the recipe. It says it makes 80 servings and I would agree if you cut in 1 inch by 1 inch portions. Followed the instructions exactly, except left out the nuts. My fudge looked dry, crumbly, and brittle, but tasted good. I brought it to work, but only 1/4 of it was eaten, I think because of the dry, brittle appearance. Not sure how to fix that.

My first ever fudge and this came out great. Easy to make. I followed some recommendations from other reviewers. I used 4 oz German Sweet Chocolate, 2 c. milk chocolate one c. semi-sweet chocolate.  I didn't stir the syrup as it boiled.  I also used the KA to mix. I used a 1/2 sheet pan with parchment paper and it firmed up pretty quickly and released from the paper easily. Thanks for the recipe Cathy.

Everyone loves it! I recently relocated to Australia, so I had to substitute some chocolates because semi-sweet chips aren't readily available here: 1 cup dark chocolate chips, 1 cup milk chocolate chips, and 12 oz hazelnut chocolate squares (instead of German chocolate-- couldn't find any). I used one cup of chopped pecans and one cup of salted caramel candy bits (instead of two cups of pecans). Like others have said, this recipe is very versatile and you can easily swap chocolate types and nuts. I'll be making this again and again!

I cooked less time, as someone suggested, but shouldn't have.  It finally set but was still too soft.  Delicious, though.  Making more tomorrow.

Can't go wrong! Easy, simple recipe. Once you start making fudge and realize how easy it is and recognize the BAD ingredients in ordinary milk chocolate bars (Hershey's etc along with their fake vanilla (aka 'vanillin'), vegetable oil (gross) etc.  you won't need to spend a dime on big store supermarket chocolate*. *Trader Joe's milk chocolate is the exception with good ingredients.

This tasted very good but for some reason the fudge never set and was very soft.  I even put it in the freezer for a while and did harden up a little but when got to room temp then it was all soft.  But I did get tons of raves on the taster!

The fudge overall was DELICIOUS! Although it required a bit more effort than other fudge recipes it was worth the effort. We halved the recipe and it was plenty (though even that was gone in days!). We replaced the pecans with crushed candy canes which also made lovely holiday gifts. It had a very creamy smooth consistency and made great lunch box treats.

This is the first batch of fudge Ive ever attempted to make and it turned out wonderful.. The recipe was SUPER easy to follow and it turned out perfect..my only complaint is that it is a very sweet, rich fudge. If you're a first time fudge maker.. I would highly recommend this recipe!

At completion, the fudge itself tasted so good - but it was wet and mushy.  It never hardened up.  I looked through all the reviews and this didn't happen to anyone else!  I made it Wednesday night and as of Friday morning it is still not "fudgy."  I followed the directions perfectly.  Hmmmm....

This recipes is awesomely good, just a little rich. But that's good, it keeps you from eating it all at once! Very good, I'll make it again.
