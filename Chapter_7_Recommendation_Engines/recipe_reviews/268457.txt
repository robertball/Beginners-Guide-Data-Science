Easy to follow recipe and Extremely tasty! I made the recipe as is, with the exception of the sherry. I’ve never made a fishy soup or chowder before and I was a bit nervous that the crab meat might over cook. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised that it didn’t. This one gets two thumbs up for sure!
