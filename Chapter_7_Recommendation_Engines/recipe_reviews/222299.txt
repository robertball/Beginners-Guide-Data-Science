Very good and easy to make.  The peanut butter was unusual but blended in after a few minutes.  Substituted fresh onion and garlic instead of powdered.  Used a little molasses instead of brown sugar.  Too thick so added a can of water and an extra can of Rotel Tomatoes.

Did not like how overpowering the peanut butter was in the chili.  May try again but omitting the peanut butter.

It was quite good - easy to make.  The peanut butter definitely provided a richness to the chilli.  Made the kitchen smell like something was being roasted.
