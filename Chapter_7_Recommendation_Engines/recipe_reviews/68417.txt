This recipe was good but I did make some changes after reading reviews.  First of all I soaked my ham in cold water for an hour after dicing to leach out some of the salt.  I used garlic powder instead of salt. I also used low sodium canned corn and only used 2 eggs.  I used cream of mushroom soup as I could not find cream of asparagus, but I did add a can of chopped asparagus to it well drained.  Instead of the bread crumbs I used left over corn bread that I had crumbled and mixed with 3 strips of crispy bacon chopped well,  this turned out wonderfully. The salt content was not a problem and it was very flavorful.  anytime you are dealing with a salt cured meat such as ham there are ways to reduce the salt content you just have to do the extra step and soak it!  I will definitely make this again my family loved it!

I'm glad I read the reviews ... I added sauteed garlic and whipping cream to help counter-balance the saltiness. I also added a tablespoon of sweet honey mustard. Plus a handful of frozen peas for color. Creamy goodness !

We liked it. Kids, too. I'm glad I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  There's enough salt from the other ingredients. I couldn't find Crm. of asparagus, so I substituted Crm of Broccoli.  It worked fine.  Next time I'll try some other mix of bread crumbs.  This time was Italian, and it was good, but I'd like to see what another will do to the dish.  Very easy.

Followed the recipe.  Too much egg and was very runny after coming out of oven.  Did not add any extra liquid to soup and drained corn completely. Would not make this again.

I had never heard of cream of asparagus soup, but I did use cream/mushroom. I used granulated garlic and garlic/herb seasoned bread crumbs. Because ham is salty in addition to using canned items and store-bought bread crumbs, this recipe has no way to control the salt content. My husband, thanks to him, was able to eat it. I couldn't eat but more than two bites. I fed my 1 yr old a serving and put some ranch on it to help with some flavor and it tasted worse. I'm surprised she ate it (maybe it was just the ranch). All the same, this would be perfect for someone not worried about high salt content, but certainly not for me.

i took a few suggestions from the other reviews and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. they were right, it's salty enough. and i used 2 eggs instead of 3. it turned out good.  not a meal i would serve to guests, but a great weeknight dinner with ham leftovers.

I used bagged stuffing for the bread crumbs.  Garlic powder instead of salt, it's quite salty enough without it.

The whole family loves it!!! The only change I made was using Dijon Mustard because I had run out of Yellow Mustard. Either way, it is super tasty and we will be having this again!!!

I should have read reviews before I used 2 Tablespoons of garlic salt.  It was so salty we had to throw it all away.  Pity it sounded so good.  It was also runny.  I won't make it again.

sorry!! I really wanted to like this.  I also had leftover ham and was looking for a good recipe to use it up, I followed others suggestions and didn't use the garlic salt, I used 2 cloves of garlic sauted with the onions and celery.  We ate it but it really had no taste.

My mom just made this and it was not to our liking. Unfortunately, she did not read the reviews before cooking :o( However, I think we'll hold onto the recipe and just use some of the suggestions listed below.

Great initial flavor, but the amount of salt overpowered you after a few bites. Use garlic powder or minced fresh garlic instead.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. My husband made it tonight. He followed the recipe exactly. It was NOT creamy at all! He used less celery than the recipe called for and all I could taste was CELERY! It was spongy and had water on the bottom. The cheddar cheese would have been better if it were mixed into the other ingredients. It was too thick to be all on top and was rubbery after sitting 1/2 hour.

Very good.  However, I would use garlic powder instead of garlic salt next time.  Quite salty.  I couldn't find Cream of Asparagus soup, so I used Cream of celery.  (I left out the diced celery.)  Also, I added egg noodles to it. It seemed as if it needed something more.  I doubled the recipe, but didn't double the eggs; I'm glad I didn't because 3 eggs was perfect.  I will definitely make again.

I used a clove of garlic in place of the garlic salt but it was still very salty. I would try it with reduced sodium soup next time. I would also use fewer breadcrumbs. Not a bad base recipe but needs tweaking.

This recipe was way too salty. When I first saw that it called fot 2 tablespoons of garlic salt, I thought it was a bit much. I will probably make this recipe again, but i will omit salt altogether, and use a little garlic powder. This recipe definately has potential.
