Hot Hot Hot!  This was good.  Next time I am going to skip the flour and frying and bake for one hour (baked 45 minutes and it is not long enough).  I will sprinkle the chicken with paprika to give it some color.  We decided that another good way to serve this is like the "Pepperoncini Beef" from this site.  After the chicken is cooked strip it off the bones,  put the chicken and jalapenos on a hoagie roll, top with provolone cheese and broil until the cheese melts.- Tried a second time, halved the recipe, omitted the frying,  sprinkled with paprika, and cooked for one hour.  Great results!

Chicken came out soggy.  It was very zingy and had interesting flavor but overall I wasn't thrilled with it.

The meat was very tender but it was a little too "vinegarish" for us.  It could have been my fault though. I only used 5 thighs and did not decrease the liquid amount. May try to play with this one a little.

I marinaded the chicken for about 18 hours, and was very surprised and disappointed by the lack of flavor. Husband like it because of the jalapenos, but I won't be making it again. Thanks anyway,

I love some "heat" in my entrees, and this recipe supplies it. The tang from the vinegar marinade mixed well with the jalapenos to create a heart 'n soul warming dish! Thanks Lynn.

I BBQ them rather than fry and bake, and they come out perfect every time!

Fabulous flavor! Granny must have been from the southwest, as this tastes like home. Next time I make this, I'll add a few quartered tomatillos to boost the flavor of home a bit more. Excellent recipe!
