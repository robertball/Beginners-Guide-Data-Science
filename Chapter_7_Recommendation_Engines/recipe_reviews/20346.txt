The cake was a shortcake type, which held up well and offered a perfect textural contrast. I used raspberries in place of strawberries because I was lucky enough to happen upon them. Two college athletes and the rest of the group agreed it was excellent. One tip, which was taught to me by my aunt many years ago when cooking vanilla pudding or custard as a filling: Cook it with a piece of lemon rind/zest. It offers a subtle dimension to the filling that is delightful, and was effective here. Also, I was low on sherry and substituted with Amaretto. No complaints!

This was ok.  Real English Trifle is made with a custard not instant pudding.  substitute the pudding with Birds instant custard which you can buy at many grocery or specialty stores, or make your own custard.  This makes the recipe more authentic and tastier.

Excellent recipe.  I substituted Amaretto for the Sherry, and used strawberries and blueberries for the fruit.  For the raspberry jam, I used a gourmet raspberry dessert filling.  The cake was a nice shortbread, not too sweet and had great texture.  It didn't rise much for me either.  Would make again for our Sunday dinner crowd.

The shortbread was perfect for this recipe - I wouldn't use a store-bought pound cake because it wouldn't hold the amaretto or sherry very well.
Also threw in some raspberries. 
A perfect summer dessert. It makes a HUGE trifle - enough for a 6-8 people dinner party with leftovers!  Delicious!

I thought the whipped cream, the pudding, and the fruit combination was awesome!  I also used amaretto.  Wonderful.  I was slightly put off by two things: 1) the cake was a bit dense and dry...may have just overcooked it, but may use a different cake next time, and 2) the whipped cream was beige from the addition of the vanilla.  Next time I'll probably use a clear vanilla flavoring rather than vanilla extract.

Yummy.  But instead of making the cake, I just used frozen Sara Lee pound cake.  My company LOVED it.  Everyone had two servings.  Also, I didn't have sherry so I used Amaretto Liquer instead.  Using fresh fruit & fresh whipping cream makes it fancy.

My cake didn't turn out very fluffy but I live at 10,000 feet and tried to compensate for the altitude but it was a bit solid.  Nonetheless this was very good.  This recipe makes sooooo much though!  I still have half of the bowl left after a dinner party!  I'm not sure how classic this recipe is though, it came out much more creamy than in England.  But it tasted lovely.

I made it without the sherry and it was still absolutely delicious.  Plus, it looks pretty.

the fruit, pudding and whipped cream parts were great, but the cake was awful.  It turned out very hard and dry, and didn't soak up any of the juices from the fruit or liquer.  I'd suggest buying ladyfingers, or using pound cake, and leaving out the liquer.

For an authentic english trifle use strawberry jello NOT jam.  Also birdseye custard not vanilla pudding.  We also use shop bought sponge fingers instead of the sponge cake.  Fruit should be in the jello and top should be covered in whipped cream and sprinkled with coloured candy strands (hundreds and thousands)

Very tasty, but must be made and consumed on the same day.  I tried to have leftovers the next day, and it wasn't pretty.  Everyone who tried it on the original serving date, said it was delicious.

Tried it twice, did not work out.  Cake definitely came out wrong.
