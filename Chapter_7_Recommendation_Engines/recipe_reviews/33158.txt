Excellent.  I opted to go half whole wheat, half white flour -- based on reviews complaining of dry texture.  Buttermilk was used in place of milk and lemon juice.  I was low on poppyseeds so used 1/6 cup instead, which I thought was perfect.  Keep an eye on your oven, my batch baked in 15 minutes.  I was surprised how moist these were. and just the perfect amount of sweetness.  These were great with a little pat of butter on top.  The recipe is a keeper.

Very good. I added vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Made them a bit sweeter and had great flavor. Next time I think I'll add some raisins.

I thought this turned out really well. Instead of putting into muffin tins, I made it like a cake in a large pan and cut into squares. It was moist and rich (though for some reason didn't rise a whole lot) but that didn't matter. It was perfect in little squares. It's not sweet.. just right and would make a nice thing for guests. Not being a banana lover, it didn't 'reek' of bananas.. it was just right! Thank you for sharing!

I like these muffins for healthy non-sweet breakfast.  I used ground flax seed instead of wheat germ, maple syrup instead of honey just because I didn't have wheat germ and honey on hand.  I added 1 tsp of vanilla.  It turned out very good!  It is not as moist as I expected but it's still good!

I only tried this recipe because I had some surplus wheat germ lying around and was looking for a way to use it up.  And now I think I will never make any other kind of banana muffins again.  These are just the best that I have ever tasted.  I was actually worried that they might be too healthy - after all they are almost fat-free and very lightly sweetened with honey.  But they don't taste like low-calorie muffins (and in fact, they aren't any lower in calories than regular muffins, though I'm sure they are healthier).  I suppose they might not appeal to everyone, but if you're the type of person that likes bran muffins, try these - you will not be disappointed.

The recipe, AS-IS, is very moist, but completely lacking in sweetness or flavor.  You can do without one if you have the other... but to have neither? I'm a person who digs the healthy hearty muffins, but this was no good.  I should have paid more attention - so many positive ratings were to MODIFIED recipes.  We'll smear these in cream cheese and honey and eat the dozen, but I'll never make these AS-IS again.

These are an excellent way to start off your day. I am going to make these again and maybe add some blueberries too. This is not a sweet muffin (if that is what you are looking for), but it is very satisfying.

These were good, but not fabulous.  They were good enough to try again with alterations.  Next time I would either reduce the oil or use vegan butter instead.  Also, I would definitely add something to make them a touch sweeter, maybe just more honey or banana.  Finally, I felt as though the recipe called for too many poppy seeds, I would use half that next time.  Thanks for the submission, every recipe needs individual tweeking.  :)

These muffins are absolutely delicious. If you are a fan of very sweet, cake-like muffins, this recipe is definitely not for you. These muffins have a very heavy bran taste and are only slightly sweet from the bananas and honey. If I serve these to guests, I'll probably add more sugar.

Smell wonderful, look wonderful...taste great!  Love how healthy these muffins are!  I used maple syrup in place of honey (didn't have any honey) and bulgur wheat in place of wheat germ.  I doubled the recipe but only used 1/3 cup poppy seeds per reviews.  Mine came out a little dry--I baked for 25 min. but will check at 20 next time.  I also added raisins for a little extra sweetness and sprinkled tops with cinnamon/sugar mixture before baking.  YUM!  And..healthy!

We made these as written (I forgot to read the reviews until the muffins were already in the oven).  My kids are gobbling them up and asking for more.  I agree that the poppy seeds are overkill and would probably use about 1/2 the amount next time.  Otherwise maybe I'll make some of the changes recommended but we all thought they were good as written.  Thanks!

I thought that the original recipe would be too heavy in texture, so I replaced wheat bran with white flour and wheat germ with ground flax. I also replaced milk with almond milk and half of honey with agave syrup. I didn't add as many poppy seeds because I just didn't have enough. The muffins were pretty big in size, moderately moist and mildly sweet. We will be making them again. Thanks!

Very healthy, used half regular flour and half white wheat - excellent consistency. Doesn't taste overly like banana.

Great muffins. I substituted 3/4 cup white flour for wheat flour, added a little cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon zest to the dry ingredients. As well as added 1/4 tsp. of vanilla to the wet ingredients. I will definitely make again!

These turned out very bland and definitely not sweet enough, even with very ripe bananas. I tried to save the recipe by adding a sugar topping after they were baked: dip the muffins in 1/4 cup melted butter, then dip in 1/4 cup of sugar mixed with 1 tsp cinnamon. It helped add some sweetness but still not enough. I also tried putting half the poppy seeds as some people had recommended but I think the full amount would have been better.

I added 1/4 cup Splenda since reviews suggested that they could use a bit more sweetness.  I also cut back on the poppy seeds.  I would not make these again.  Even for a healthy option I thought they were bland and dry.

This is a great recipe. Just add 1/2 of natural sugar and I usually substitute the wheat bran for Malt-o-meal.

I thought it was a great recipe.  I used another suggestion and added half whole wheat and half white flour.  I doubled the recipe, but used only half the oil.  Instead of the rest of the oil I added apple sauce.  It came out nice and fluffy.  I used half the suggested poppy seeds as recommended by others.  This was a good amount.  I added some raisins, nutmeg, cloves and cinnimon.  Next time I'll add more of these and some sugar.  I like my muffins a bit sweeter.  Served great with a bit of butter.

I usually love bran muffins, but these were just dense and not very flavorful. I even added vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg to some of them and that didn't make them much better. These just aren't that great.

As written the muffin did not have flavor and there were too many poppy seeds.  With butter they are edible.  They were moist, but just tasted like you forgot to add the sugar.  I'm sure with applesauce instead of oil they would be sweeter, but you might even need more than that.  20 minutes slightly overcooked them in my oven, check them in 15.

Love these! I add a little more honey, and a few chocolate chips for fun. I also use less poppy seeds. I add vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg for a little more flavor. Everyone from my 5 year old daughter to my husband and parents, we all love these!

Made it just as directed, except, wait, used flax seed instead of poppy seeds and that gave it a great little crunch. Wonderful hearty breakfast muffin.

I'm always on the lookout for a healthier muffin - these were great and very filling! They are definitely not overly sweet, so if you prefer a cake-like muffin, this might not be the recipie for you.

Great recipe, but way too many poppy seeds.  I will definitely make this again, but will cut the poppy seeds in half and add a little more sugar and/or honey.

I changed it up a bit: 1/6 cup poppy seeds, 1 teaspoon vanilla, used soy milk instead of regular, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, a dash of all spice, dash of cloves, used 1/8 cup of oil and 1/8 cup of apple sauce, and lastly, threw in some chopped walnuts. Great texture! Didn't need 25 minutes to bake... more like 20.

Great healthy alternative. I substituted Flax meal for the wheat germ as one suggested. I didn't have honey, so used 1/2 cup organic sugar, I also added 2 tsp vanilla extract. I also did half the amount of poppy seeds which was enough as another suggested. After baking, I thought it might be too "healthy" for the family, since they are used to the cake muffins, so I added an orange glaze made of orange juice concentrate, powdered sugar and a touch of milk and drizzled it on. They loved it and didn't even notice that it was "healthy". Shhhhh... don't tell them:)

These were good but not wonderful. I didn't have milk so I subbed fat free yogurt. I also didn't use the oil but half sour cream and half applesauce. I also added a little cinnamon. I made a topping of a little brown sugar and crushed honey nut chex cereal. They were very moist, but very lacking in flavor. The topping was the only thing that had much flavor. IF I made them again, I would definitely add more flavorings, like vanilla or banana extract.

These were pretty good.  I think you could make them a bit more healthy by substituting the oil with apple sauce.  I didn't have any lemon juice so I had to omit that ingredient, it would probably add a nice pop though.  I think the muffins was a bit heavy and dense.

These muffins are great!  I made a few changes.  I used a 1/2 cup of ground flax seed instead of wheat germ.  I used 1 tsp of vanilla instead of the 2 tsp of lemon juice.  I made 13 muffins instead of 12 and only baked them for 20 minutes.  They are moist, not too sweet and they contain healthy ingredients - definitely a make again recipe!

This recipe is good but I'm afraid it needs a bit of tweeking.  Next time I will add more lemon at least double the amount called for as I couldn't taste the lemon at all. I may put in some lemon zest too.  I found them a bit dry so I'll probably add more milk and lastly I would add either quite a bit more honey or some sugar as they are not sweet at all. I really liked the texture and it was nice to have a healthy muffin for a change.

I made these according to what I had on hand. They are very good and not too sweet which I like. I didn't have wheat germ so I left that out. I filled my lacking 1 cup of bananas to the top with yogurt and cut the poppyseeds in half. I added raisins and that tastes good too because it adds some sweetness. They turned out moist for me, probably because I left out the wheat germ. I will be making these again, thanks for the great recipe!

really tasty!  i would use a little bit more banana just to bring out that flavor.  on a side note, i could not find wheat bran ANYWHERE, so i ended up buying wheat bran cereal and crushing it up.  it worked okay.  probably would be even better if i could find the real thing.

Excellent! Crunchy on the top, moist in the middle. The combination of banana, poppy seeds, and honey is wonderful. Keep an eye on these if you have a fan-forced oven and Teflon bakeware, though. Even if you don't use the fan-bake setting, these muffins will probably be done in under 20 minutes.

**They only take 15 minutes to bake if you want moist muffins!**  

I added the zest of a lemon... and all the juice that I could squeeze out, maybe 1/4 cup? for a little extra flavour. 

Also, chia seeds (soaked in the milk) were substituted for poppy seeds, and coconut for the bran. They rose nicely, are so  light soft and fluffy. 

They are a treat muffin being a little sweet with the honey and coconut, but definitely something I would like to make again.

I enjoy this muffins a lot...it's been the 4th time, maybe and I always like adding something new (first time I made it as is). This time, I added the usual cinnamon, plus some cranberries...and my, as usual, we all love it =) I think the secret is the moist yumminess and the healthy ingredients!

I try not change too much in a recipe the first time, but we just can't help it. I added an extra banana(I had too many ripe ones), I substituted buttermilk for milk and lemon juice, and agave nectar for the honey & 1 teaspoon each of butter extract(Bakers need to check this extract out!), and vanilla. In the dry goods I added 1/2 cup of flax seed meal,along with 1 tsp cinnamon, 1tsp cardomon. I cut the poppy seeds back to 2 1/2 TBL I also added at the end 1 & 1/2 cup frozen blueberries and 1/2 chopped walnuts. Delicious. Just the right amount of sweetness due to the extra banana, and now it almost needs 1/4 cup more flour so the the paper will peel off.  A definite keeper. Very healthy. One could also add raisins or another dried fruit. The only thing I don't like is the oil, but next time I will use half walnut oil half veg oil. It made 17 muffins that I cooked for 23 minutes. If one wants more sweetness, try adding a streusel topping before baking-1/3 c brown sugar, 2 T flour, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1 T soft butter. Kind of defeats the healthy part tho!) Thanks swimmerv1! :)))

These were really good.  Not quite as moist as desireable, but perhaps that was because I didn't have any germ so I added ground flax instead.  They have great flavor and chewy texture.  Will definitely make again.
