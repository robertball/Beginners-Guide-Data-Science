I was a little nervous making something that had no reviews yet, but this was delicious! It looked gorgeous in presentation, and I loved all the different flavors. 

The recipe doesn't give instructions for cooking the pork chops so I had to wing it. I coated them with a little olive oil and a combination of salt, pepper, and chili powder. Let them sit for awhile to absorb the flavors, then put them on the stovetop in a grill pan over medium heat. I covered the pan with aluminum foil and cooked for 10 mins (flipping once halfway through). Internal temp ~145. I removed from heat and let them sit awhile more to finish cooking, then sliced. They turned out perfect.

For a lower calorie dressing you can omit the mayo.  It still has a nice flavor.  Also, I was feeling lazy and didn't want to use the blender, so besides omitting mayo, I used dry mustard instead of dijon.  I also added some dried basil, oregano and thyme.

"This is by far the best salad I've ever eaten," said my husband, halfway through dinner -- and several more times after that.  I was stunned, because he dines at our city's best restaurants every day for lunch.  Everyone commented on the way the flavors come together in this elegant salad.   I grilled thick, marinated chops the day before.  For the fruit, used peaches and plums.  Sprinkled lemon juice on the avocado.  Pan roasted the almonds in a bit of oil, and toward the end, I added a little sugar to the almonds.  Tomatoes were fresh out of the garden.  I doubled the dressing and added a T. of red wine vinegar (in addn. to the balsamic) because it was quite thick.  This will be on my menu when company arrives next week.

Great Summer Salad!! I marinated a pork tenderloin overnight in a soy-maple based marinade, rinsed off the marinade, patted dry and grilled on high for 5 mins per side (20 mins. total). Omitted the grapefruit, grilled the nectarine slices and added a pinch of salt, cayenne and sugar to the toasted almonds. I'm a personal chef and my boss loved this salad!!!

Fantastic!!! Such a delicious combination of flavors.  And the dressing is outstanding!!!  Even my husband who's not a big salad guy raved about it.  I used center cut bonless pork chops, seasoned with salt, pepper & garlic powder and pan fried them for about 5-6 minutes per side until just done.  If you have left over pork of any kind even better!  You could substitute chicken, but the pork really pairs well with the fruits.  Add your favorite loaf of bread and it's a perfect summer dinner.

I followed the recipe exactly, even using the grapefruit (other reviewers omitted). It was very tasty, and the flavors - though diverse - went together very well. The dressing was a perfect compliment. Great way to use leftover pork chops. Great easy summer meal. Thank you!

Thanks so much for this original and delicious summer salad! Hubby and I both loved this - such a refreshing combination of flavors and textures. I substituted plums for the grapefruit, and used pork tenderloin instead of chops, but kept everything else the same. I think next time I might add a little chopped red onion. Definitely a keeper.

I just LOVED this Salad. My husband loved the fresh fruits with the Honey Balsamic Vinaigrette. It's a keeper for me. I doubled the Vinaigrette and put some on my Pork Chops when they were baking.

This was wonderful. The only change we made was leaving out the grapefruit (I don't like them). But the flavors were lovely. We'll be making this again!

This was really, really yummy!  The avacado added some nice smooth texture and contrasted well with the grapefruit and nectarines.   I was looking for a  cool main dish meal using pork and veggies and this fit the bill perfectly.  Everyone in the family loved it.  I mixed the dressing in a bowl instead of getting the blender dirty.  Next time I grill out I'll do some extra pork chops and have a great start on the next meal.

Mild taste but so very good. We did about 2/3s the oil and a little more Balsamic vinegar. Barbequed the pork and this was the clincher that made it so good!

A little too much dressing for my taste, but it is very easy to adjust the amount used for each portion. Other dinner guests who like more dressing absolutely loved it.

This is just a "salad" recipe. I figured I would try it anyway (using a family recipe for porkchops) but I found the ingredient list unnecessarily long, the flavors unbalanced, and the overall effect less than impressive.

Delicious!  I used a pork tenderloin rather then chops and reduced the amount of oil and mayo just a little.  I served this "de-constructed" with the dressing on the side so the kids can pick and choose what they like and keep everything separate, with dressing to dip stuff in or be drizzled.  Big hit with all of us!

I recently started ordering produce from an organic produce provider, we receive a box every two weeks. Our box last week had grapefruit so I needed something to force us to eat it. This salad was perfect!  We love pork chops and it was a healthy alternative to our usual meals. My husband loved it -meat and sweet stuff - who wouldn't love it.

This salad is amazing.  It is the perfect blend of ingredients and the dressing is wonderful.  I didn't have nectarines so we used peaches.  And I ended up breading and baking my pork which added a great touch to the salad.  Would highly recommend!!!!

I always get lots of compliments when I serve this.  To make it easy, I cook a pork tenderloin the night before.  Before serving, I then slice and quickly saute the tenderloin in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I also use the pre-sectioned grapefruit that you can buy.

My boyfriend said "This, definitely again" before he even sat down with his salad. I added 1 Tablespoon of red wine vinegar to the dressing, and it was great. I will definitely be making lots and lots of this dressing! I used grapefruit, nectarine, kiwi, strawberry and pineapple. Can't wait to have it again!!

I love this. The dressing is wonderful and would be good on any fresh salad. I like it with a mixed lettuce blend - especially with some "nutty" tasting varieties. Peeled peaches could easily sub for nectarines. I liked the grapefruit. Marinated grilled shrimp would work well, as would chicken or very thinly sliced steak. The dressing is the key - from there add what you like.

I was browsing the Internet for a new alternative to boring old pork chop recipes and discovered this treasure. I was a bit skeptical because some of the ingredients, such a grapefruit, seemed like they might ruin the salad but I stuck to the recipe. I'm glad I did because it is delicious! My entire family loved it! There are so many flavors it is truly remarkable. Plus it is very filling and is a meal in itself.

This salad was great!  Hubby even loved it.  I did have a leftover BBQ'd  center cut pork loin chop but didn't have grapefruit, oranges or avocado so instead used red grapes (cut in half) and apple (thinly sliced) and a small amount of thinly sliced red onion along with the sliced almonds.  The dressing really made this salad.  Next time will try with white balsamic vinegar.

Made this recipe exactly as written (minus the almonds) and everyone practically licked their plates clean. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and marinated boneless pork chops in the dressing and they were definitely the highlight of the salad. I also used more lettuce than was called for, 2 cups of lettuce is not a salad, and I wish that I had used even more. All of the flavors went together really well and everyone requested that I make this again, even the non-salad eating guys!!

This is a really good recipe and a good example of why I love Allrecipes. In the Search bar, I plugged in cooked pork (roast beef leftovers) and avocado and this was the only recipe to pop up.  I had no grapefruit but I had some mangoes - not exactly the tartness that grapefruit would bring to the salad but it worked. My husband's on cholesterol-lowering meds so grapefruit is out.  I had no cherry tomatoes but cut up a regular tomato. I have no idea what the 1 tbsp salad oil was for, which is shown in the first column of ingredients. I didn't use it, nor did I salt and pepper the greens.  
I tossed all the salad ingredients together with the salad dressing, the recipe for which I followed to a T.  You don't need as much dressing when you toss everything together - making for less calories per serving. Ab so lutely delicious.  I'll be making this again.  Probably tomorrow;-)

The strange fruits had me a little nervous, but this salad was delicious! The dressing was the perfect thing to bring all the flavors together. As many others suggested, I only used 1 T. of mayo and added a tablespoon of red wine vinegar to the dressing.
