I love this cake and make it often. Everyone at work loves it too. I frost it will a 16 oz container of Cool Whip mixed with a box of instant pistachio pudding and it is very moist and fabulous! I bake it in a bundt pan and it comes out perfect everytime.

The pistachio cake recipies I have seen here seem to all mention one problem colapsing.I have found a very simple way to make this cake is to use one box of instant cake mix, one package of pistachio pudding(instant) one small container of sour cream and two eggs. Make sure you grease and flour the bundt pan. I also usualy bake at 300. For frosting use another package of the pistachio pudding and a pint of heavy wipping cream, whip this into a frosting and you are good to go. You can change up and add other ingredients as you wish such as chocolate chips and cherries. Ive also changed the cake and puddng mixes to make other flavors. I also reccomend making double the frosting because it is that good.

I really liked the cake but I did tweak it a bit. After greasing the bundt pan with shortening I coated it with finely chopped almonds then poured the batter in. I also made a whipped cream icing but just powdered sugar would have been fine too. I just happened to have left over heavy cream and needed something to do with it. My cake did shrink a lot when it cooled but it kept it's shape and looked good. I did not add the extra food coloring I thought it was green enough.

Never add pudding to a cake mix that already has pudding in it.  That's what makes it fail.  Always start with a cake mix with NO pudding in the mix.  Duncan Hines.  Works every time.

This is now my favorite all around cake recipe! As for the pistachio..This was OK but on the subtle side. It did stay very moist & light yet stays together. I have made it a few times now and it has really grown on me...I use this combo in other flavored cakes as well.

The flavor the 1st time wasn't quite strong enough. I made a pistachio pudding icing as some of the others mentioned (turned out well) and left out the food color as it was a nice light green. I also served it with Ben and Jerry Pistachio Ice Cream, that has a real flavor kick. I like the concept and color here but it needed a little more Oomph. Garnished with Kiwi slices, looked cute.

I've made this cake about 5 times.  At least twice, it's completely collapsed during the cooling process, once it didn't rise at all.  

It always tastes good... but I can't count on it to come out well every time.  So, it's a "family-only" cake until I can figure out how to get it to come perfectly every time.

Suggestions welcome.  auntiej500@netscape.net

My family liked this "groovy green"  cake. I used a heavy cast aluminum nonstick Bundt Pan. Sprayed with nonsalt cooking spray. Baked at 350 degrees for 50 minutes. Let cool in the pan 15 mintues. Then flipped onto plate. Came out with no troubles. The only thing i did differently was only used 2 eggs and added 1/2 cup sour cream. Moist & good.

This recipe was a winner. I made it for St. Patrick's day and brought it to work. It was so moist and delicious. I drizzled a frosting on the cake made with confectioner's sugar, milk and almond extract, green food coloring.

Fabulous cake!  I had a little trouble with the cake collapsing out of the oven, but that may have been my fault.  My personal opinion is that the cake tastes best straight out of the refrigerator.  I frosted it with a light buttercream frosting and topped it with toasted coconut.  Very good.

I read some of the other suggestions...used 1 box cake mix, 1 box pistachio pudding mix, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup sour cream and the same water and vegetable oil. I used about 10 drops green coloring, and added about 1/4 cup crushed pineapple and coconut flakes, because I did not have almond extract and did not want it to be "boring". Nor did I have a bundt pan! So I made it in a glass 9 X 13 and baked it about 40 minutes on 350. Frosted with the cool whip and pistachio pudding frosting someone suggested, and it was Great! I hate to review the original recipe if I changed it up, had I had any almond extract and a bundt pan I would have made it according to directions. I think it would have come out great that way too.  Thanks for sharing!

INcredible!  I made a few variations to the recipe for a different flavor (icing, etc.), but this recipe is fabulous!  The cake is super-moist, and the flavor is the perfect strength...Unforgettable at parties!

Really moist cake! I had to use vanilla puddinig (I thought I had pistachio but nope) so I used vanilla extract instead. Very pretty for St. Paddy's Day! Used chocolate canned frosting, heated it in the microwave to drizzle. 5 stars for fast and easy!

This recipe was wonderful!  I add a 1/2 C. of sour cream, 1/2 chopped pistachios and 1 tsp (vs. 1/2 tsp.) of Almond flavoring.  I melted white chocolate chips w/ several dashes of lime juice for icing.

I made these into cupcakes and used butter cream frosting. They bake at about 15-20 minutes. It was very moist and delicious. I will definitely make them again.

I almost hate to rate and review this recipe because I followed the advice of another reviewer and changed the recipe a bit.  I followed everything except the eggs, I only used 2, and I added 1/2 cup of sour cream.  Everything else was the same.  I was so excited watching it bake through the oven door, it was getting so nice and tall, looked beautiful!  I took it out after 50 minutes at 350 degrees and it looked gorgeous.  After about 10 minutes or so of cooling in the pan on a rack, I went in to find it less than 1/2 it's size!  It had collapsed and is now very dense in the middle.  So sad because I wanted to take it to a neighbors for St. Patrick's Day dinner.  I don't know what caused the collapse, I've read so many reviews saying they had the same problem.  I even read one reviewer that said to be sure and get a cake mix that doesn't already have pudding in the mix, so I got one that didn't.  I've made many bundt cake recipes that call for adding pudding to the cake mixe and I've never had this happen to me before.  I am wondering if it maybe has too much water.  1 1/2 cups is alot I think.  I'll keep reading the reviews, hopefully someday, someone will explain why this happens and have a fix for it.  Hope you all have more luck with this recipe than I did.  So disappointed...

I read all of reviews carefully before I made this cake. I confess I did not make as written but I must give this five stars.  Changes I made based on the reviews, I used Betty Crocker super moist butter recipe cake mix, two jumbo eggs, 1 1/2 cups skim milk and 1/2 cup sour cream,  I did not add the food coloring. It was good the first day, but was even better the second day.  It was soooooo moist and the flavor was not overpowering.  I didn't frost the cake as I thought it tasted fine as is.  Good recipe.....give it a try.

I was looking for a cake that would coincide with St. Patties day and came across this one. When I sampled the batter, I was hoping for more of a pistachio flavor, but figured that I would give it a shot this way first.  After frosting it with the whipped topping/pudding mix, I was glad that I stayed with the recipe. What a light and refreshing cake.  Definitely a keeper. In reading the reviews, I saw that a lot of people were having problems with the cake falling.  I have used cake mixes for a lot of different things and when it comes to adding pudding to the mix, I have always followed the directions on the back of the cake mix box, as the different brands  all vary in the amount of oil, water and eggs that needs to be added. So I stuck to my method and then just added the almond extract and it came out perfect.  Hope this helps.

This one gets 5 stars for being so quick, easy and pretty! Followed the recipe with the exception of the green food coloring...left that out. The cake had a very pretty pale lemon-lime color.

We just came back from the Inaugural Cruise  on the  NCL Epic and they had a pistachio pound cake that my wife just loved. I tried this recipe as this was the closest I could find. This cake came out AWESOME.My wife it. The pudding kept it very moist and she was impressed. I used the sugar free pudding instead to try and cut a few calories.

Followed the recipe for the most part, but made a few changes...used 3 eggs and added 4oz. of vanilla yogurt for extra moisture (because of complaints of dryness); used canola oil instead because it's healthier; mixed 1/4 cup brown sugar, 2 tsp. cinnamon, and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and sprinkled the mixture in between two layers of the batter in the bundt cake pan (this is my grandmother's twist on the recipe and it makes it so much more heavenly!); worked quickly so that the pudding didn't set and had no problem getting it into the cake pan...also omitted the food coloring and it stil had a pretty pastel green color even with the yellow cake mix!

Loved the recipe but made it sugar free by using Pillsbury's sugar free yellow cake mix and Jello's sugar free instant pistachio pudding.  I also sprinkled sugar free powdered sugar (3 T Splenda + 2 T cornstarch processed in a mini-blender) on the top.  Next time I'll try sugar free Cool Whip with sugar free pistachio pudding for the frosting.

I have been making this recipe since I was a kid. Here's a wonderful topping: 1 envelope Dream Whip, 1 pkg pistachio pudding, 1.5 cups cold milk. Whip Dream Whip, milk and pudding mix in a chilled bowl. Beat. It's such a creamy topping for this cake.
Add extra green food coloring to topping and cake mix for a great, very green St. Patrick's Day cake!

I made this recipe as cupcakes. They sunk a bit so next time I believe I would omit the fourth egg. Yummy flavor and everyone loved them! Topped with Irish cream frosting made from flavored coffee creamer.

Correctly made this is a great and flavorful bundt cake.  But this is a bad recipe.  WAY to much water.  If you want to make this, follow the directions on the cake mix for the qty of water/oil and baking time.  Don't worry about the pudding mix, it just makes the cake more dense, like a pound cake.  And take the advise of other posts and use white cake mix.  I learned the hard way and didn't read the comments before making it the first time and followed the directions....total failure...batter was way to watery so it did not rise properly in the oven and fell when while cooling.  
On my 2nd try I ground some pistachios and used them to coat pan instead of flour and left a thicker base in the bottom.  So, not frosting needed. 
I actually made

I've made this pistachio cake recipe for many years and my mother has been making it since at least the seventies. Reminds me of my childhood. Perfect every time and people just love it. Mom came up with a pistachio frosting using pudding mix and a Dream Wip envelope. Wonderful!! Frosting can be made low fat by using skim milk.

Great idea. Tastes great. I will try this with other cake/ pudding combinations. One reviewer said to use  the cake mix, pudding and only 2 eggs and some sour cream. The cake still needed 1/2 c water, another egg, 1/4 c oil and extract. My cake baked perfectly and did not collapse.

I agree that there simply isn't enough pistachio flavor. Next time I will double the pistachio pudding., Also, I diced and toasted some pistachios and there them into the batter.. It helped!

Loved the cake, but I relied in the pudding to provide the green tint. It looked just fine--actually more natural, and "felt" healthier.

Followed the recipe exactly as written. Cake came out beautiful. Tastes like yellow cake. No pistachio taste whatsoever. If I made it again I would add actual pistachio nuts, more extract, maybe choc chips.  What I have now is a green vanilla cake. Too bad it's not st. Patrick's day.

I made this recipe w/club soda instead of water, no food coloring. I used a cake mix w/pudding already in it and it came out perfectly in 55 min. Nice light green color & moist. I frosted it w/16oz cool whip mixed w/instant pistachio pudding and it was a hit for our St. Patrick's day dessert!

Love this cake! I will make this again and again and AGAIN! I couldn't find pistachio pudding so I made it an almond cake instead with vanilla pudding. This is an excellent cake! Highly recommend.

pretty darn good and I got a lot of compliments for its green color on St Patty's day.  Very simple and moist.  I followed the recipe to the T and it came out perfect.  I didn't have any problems with it caving in.  I think the key to good baking is that once you put it in the oven...just leave it alone!  Don't mess with it or keep on opening the oven door.    Once it cooled I made a simple glaze with powdered sugar and water. Very good:)

I have been making this cake for years now.  It's requested by my family and friends quite alot.   Yes it is a great basis for other flavored cakes as well.  We like plain cake so just some powder sugar or whipped cream when serving.  For those who have trouble with it collapsing, do not cool cake near an opened window or anywhere where there is a draft.

I love this recipe, but I beat it for 5 minutes on high instead of 3 minutes and find the cake keeps its shape every time! Never had a problem with it collapsing. I am going to switch out the pistachio with a cherry pudding, and add Cool Whip and cherry pie filling for a topping, for a Valentine's pot luck lunch at work.

Really liked this recipe. I used Duncan Hines cake mix as advised in the comments. I also added chopped pistachios and a powder sugar/butter glaze. I don't think that the food coloring is necessary unless you want the cake to be really green. Anyhow, my coworkers love me.

i just  made thia with much success.. I had a white cake mix with pudding  on hand  so use that and used  only 1 cup water-I  baked it in a bundt pan 50 min - delicous and  moist. I could taste the pistachio flavor also. I mixed some  pistachio pudding into cool whip to serve a dollop on top . but yummy plain with  dusitng of conf sugar.  I will  be making again.

I've been making this cake for 20 years.  The only difference is:  my recipe calls for 8 oz. of lemon/lime soda rather than 1-1/2 cups of water.  Also, as a review mentioned, always use a cake mix without pudding in the mix.  I never frosted the cake... I loved the flavor of the cake and didn't want to "corrupt" it with frosting.  My favorite cake ever.

I made this today. I used "pudding in the mix" cake, too. But I added a heaping teaspoon of baking powder to prevent cake from falling as other reviewers complained about. It turned out beautifully!

i love this cake, but to keep it from collapsing i too took one egg away and added 1/2 cup sour cream - i also have added another box of pistachio pudding to give it a bolder taste and used a cup of oil and 1 cup of water to give it more of a pound cake texture - so moist and just love it

Such an unfortunate experience-- visually and in taste.  The texture of this cake is not pleasant; something about using a pudding mix makes the crumb very dense, not like a cake at all and it collapses.  Will NOT make this cake again.

This cake was VERY good!  I had no issues of the cake falling.  It actually rose higher than most cakes I've made.  I think people are just doing something wrong.  The only part of the recipe that I didn't follow was using a beater or standmixer.  I used a good ol whisk and some elbow grease to mix it for 2-3 minutes.  VERY GOOD!

I saw this recipe too late for Saint Patrick's Day, but I needed something for Easter.  The green coloring appealed to me, so I made it as written, and I was very pleased with the taste and texture. This is a very moist cake, and with a little pink and yellow icing it was the perfect spring dessert.

This turned out fairly well for me.  I had to improvise because the cake mix I had was a smaller amount.  Baked it in a bundt pan and while it wasn't the prettiest looking cake I ever made, it was fun to cut into it and see the green color, and the taste was good and people came back for more.

I've been making this cake for at least 15 years.  I do not use the 1.5 cups of water, but instead replace whatever water the box cake mix says with Sprite or 7-up.  Also use whatever eggs and oil the box cake mix instructions say.  Then to make it really exciting, I add about 1 cup of mini-chocolate chips.

I just made this- I followed the advice of reviewers and used a cake mix that dd not contain pudding, used 2 eggs and half a cup of sour cream. I substituted the water for milk. Once I took the cake out of the oven it literally shriveled before my eyes! The cake still looks pretty, just smaller. I cut into the cake. 2/3 of the inside was textured like a solid custard- it actually tasted good. I liked it because it was not too sweet and it did have a nice pistachio flavor.

Made this cake, it was good and I'd probably make it again. Didn't have an 18.25 cake mix and used a regular size Duncan Hines yellow mix, had to tweak the recipe due to mix size, so I only added 1 1/4 cup water and 3 eggs, also added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. Had no issues of the cake falling as others have noted. Dusted with powdered sugar.

Use fluorescent green food color if you can find it.  Good without glaze or icing.

This was a great recipe! I used white cake mix instead of yellow, and didn't use the food colouring because the pudding gave it a nice light green colour. I also made it in cupcake form, and it easily made over 2 dozen in about 20 minutes. I finished them with a cream cheese frosting and crushed walnuts as garnish and they were a MAJOR hit. I definitely recommend the recipe!

I love this!! After I grease the bundt pan i sprinkle cinnamon and sugar. Then I add half the batter and do another layer of cinnamon sugar. Add the rest of the batter and again coat with cinnamon sugar. It's a crowd pleaser. Oh and I sift my pistachio pudding mix.  And I omit the food coloring.

Something is wrong with this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and did use a cake mix with no pudding in the mix.  It collapsed about 2 minutes out of the oven.  1 1/2 cups water seems like a lot so I wonder if something is wrong with that measurement.  Very disappointing!!!  Was going to take it to a St. Patrick's Day dinner.

I like how simple this recipe is. Sometimes you just want to make something quick and not go the full "from scratch" route. I only used 1 1/4 cups of water because I noticed that my box of cake mix was only 15.25 oz. I think next time I could even go with just 1 cup of water. I did use Pillsbury with pudding already in the mix and I didn't have any issues with the cake sinking, as some other reviewers mentioned. I also added some chopped pistachios to the batter which, made it so much better. I think the taste of the cake as is definitely needs more pistachio flavor. I wouldn't have liked it as much without the real chopped pistachios in it. I think next time I will try this recipe using a mix that doesn't contain pudding (Duncan Hines), maybe use two packages of pistachio pudding, add a full teaspoon of the almond extract or use actual pistachio extract, add more chopped pistachios, and omit the green food coloring. I thought the color was just fine without it. However, the extra green would be nice for a holiday such as St. Patrick's or Christmas. Overall, it was a quick and easy recipe that produced a good enough cake. My family enjoyed it. Thanks!

Tried this with white cake mix with no pudding in cake box. Used two 9x5 loaf pans. This was really, really good! Yes, batter is thick and hard to spread, but baked up nicely. Golden on outside, moist inside. Gave as gifts and will make it again for sure!

Lovely, lovely, lovely!!  To finish it I made a glaze of 2 cups powdered sugar, 1/4 teaspoon almond extract, 1 Tablespoon milk and 5 drops of green food coloring.  The glaze was darker than the cake.  The "best baker in town" pronounced it perfect.  Thanks for making me look good (again) AR.

I used a white cake mix (thought I had a yellow mix).  Also I went to a cake speciality store and found pistachio extract.  I used that instead of the almond. When I made with out my pistachio extract  and used almond it was OK flavor.  Waiting on my hubby's comments since I sent it with him to work.

For many of you that changed this recipe and made a frosting of whip cream and pistachio pudding----that's just the old "Watergate cake" recipe for frosting...the cake is a bit different with the almond extract and food coloring I guess...just not a real big deal---but it is good!!

This cake is pretty good. Quick and easy, and it was fun for St Pat's. Unfortunately I went and ruined it with a cream cheese frosting. Don't do the same thing! It is actually better just plain with no frosting.

Moist and delicious!!  I took the advice of another cook and included slivered almonds on the top which looked nice.  My friends and I simply ate slices of the cake plain and it was quite delicious as is but I'll probably throw some icing on top for St. Patrick's Day coming up.

I turned this into a layer cake with lime frosting. Turned out great. Was a hit. The only things I changed was using only 3 of the 4 eggs, and cut the water back by 1/4 cup. No problems at all. Very moist cake. Delicious.

Because of the new smaller sized cake mixes, I find the following helpful: 
New cake mixes. Add 6 tablespoons flour
To the "new improved" cake mix and proceed with the recipe as usual, per Cake Mix Doctor site. I've done this and it works. No need if using the cake mix for a cobbler or dump cake.

Check the ounces in your boxed cake mix to prevent falling! 
I was scared to make this cake because I read several reviews that said the cake collapsed during baking AND my Mom always made this cake for holidays. It's a family favorite, a legend amongst my family and friends and she even mailed to family out of state. Friends begged her for one, and she was happy so many people loved it. My Mom is no longer with us and I don't have the exact recipe she used, I just knew "pistachio pudding cake".  I was even asked by several people after my Mom passed if I had the receipe for "the pistachio pudding cake." You can now understand my state of mind over making what should have been a simple cake. I promised to make the cake for my brother, he was looking forward to a much missed, sweet reminder of our Mom and he was on his way over for dinner, and, this cake. He even asked me when I asked him if he would like me to make it ..."you have the exact recipe, right?" These reasons made check the ingredients carefully. My cake mix was 3oz. short of the amount in the receipe, which a Google search said is a little over 3/4 of a cup.  Yikes, no time to go to back to the store! On line research yielded that cornstarch in equal amounts is a good sub for cake flour. I added the cornstarch, the cake was moist, fluffy, as we remembered it and no evidence of cornstarch add. I didn't know all brands don't have the same amount of cake mix, so check before using so your cake does not fall.

This is a nice cake, but it is pretty plain so that's why I've only given three stars.  It was very moist (I used a boxed cake mix that did have pudding in the mix and I didn't have any issue with my cake falling).  The pistachio isn't very strong, so  this isn't much different from doing a plain yellow box cake.

Yum!  Tastes like a cake mix but that's expected.  Made 18 cupcakes.  Baked at 350 for 20 minutes.  Used white cake with pudding already in the mix.  They did rise nicely but shrunk a little.  I could see where a full-sized cake would sink.  These were lovely as cupcakes.  Made with Cool Whipped Frosting from this site with sugar free pistachio pudding.  Nom nom.

I tried this for Christmas. We loved how moist it was. I did not use a bundt pan and instead I used a glass rectangle pan and baked it for 20 minutes less than what it called for. Also, I did not use any green food coloring, it was green enough! I replaced the powdered sugar coating with cream cheese frosting and it is an amazing combination! I will definitely make this recipe again!

I made this cake last night and it was delicious. The only thing that didn't turn out the same was the colour of the cake - mine turned out a very light green/yellow colour. For future I would probably choose to use a white cake mix or more dye to balance it out. However, the cake turned out moist, flavourful, and very light and fluffy as promised!

Feel free to check out photos of my version of the pistachio cake on www.forloveofbaking.com.

I am going to an Italian Fest in August and decided that I would make an Italian Flag layer cake - similar to an Italian Spumoni cake minus the chocolate - so I needed a pistachio layer, vanilla layer and a cherry layer.  Due to the problems (cake not rising or falling) I read from the other reviewers I decided that I should probably run a trial on this layer.  As I need a very large cake I used the above recipe x 2 and cooked it in a large roasting pan at 350°F for ~35 minutes. I also used a cake mix - Pillsbury Super Moist White - with pudding in the mix -  After letting it cool for 30 min the cake came out perfectly intact. I did not have any problems with making or baking this cake per the above instructions.  Great Cake - rave reviews from the colleagues and neighbors who benefitted by this trial run.  Thanks

So moist, so delicious!  My mom used to make a pistachio cake for me as a kid and she would frost it with chocolate icing. I enjoyed this cake with a dusting of powdered sugar to let the pistachio flavor really come through. I was nervous about not tasting the pistachio because of other reviews. Btw, I had a cake mix with pudding already in it, that's what I had on hand, but I didn't have any issues with the cake collapsing as I read in other reviews.

I have baked this cake, and before I bake it I get some Hersheys Syrup pour on the top of the cake and swirl it around with a butter knife, then bake it, and it is really tasty.  I use a butter cream icing or pistachio pudding icing.

After many tries I have finally found the remedy for the rise and fall of this recipe! 

1 pkg of Duncan Hines yellow cake mix (it's the only one without pudding in the mix!   That's crucial!)
1 small pkg of pistachio pudding mix
1/2 cup of sugar
4 eggs
1/2 cup of water
1/2 cup of vegetable oil
1 8 oz. Cup of sour cream
1/2 tsp of almond extract
Several drops of green food coloring

Mix all ingredients together and pour into greased and floured bundt pan (or the spray with the flour in it)
Bake at 350 for 1:05 to 1:10. 
Came out perfectly! !!!!  A huge HIT with the family!

I made this for a Christmas luncheon at work. It was a huge hit.  I used applesauce as a one for one substitution for the oil.  It added moisture to the cake.   It was sweet, but not overly sweet.  They want me to make it again, and that's the true mark of a good recipe!

I have an old family recipe for pistachio cake that NEVER stays gooey or collapses.  Try using pistachio gelatin packet instead of the pudding.

Absolutely Perfect! I dusted it with powder sugar. No need for an icing! I baked it in a 9" cake pan because i didnt have a 10" bundt pan. It was done in 45-50 minutes.

I make this cake often.
I buy the store brand yellow cake mix no pudding in it
Making it with a pudding in the mix will
Not work well. I put in chopped walnuts and
also poppy seeds.Oh my gosh it does wonders.
I do put in a teaspoon and a half of almond
extract. I dust with powdered sugar.

Made as directed with a non-pudding in the mix cake mix. Was delicious and moist. Came out of the bundt pan beautifully. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday.  I was kind of nervous because I don't bake often.  However, the cake was fairly easy to make. After reading the reviews, I decided to stick to the recipe and not change it up.  

The cake baked for exactly 50 minutes.  I allowed it to cool for 15 minutes in the pan and then placed it on a wire rack to cool completely. The cake did not collapse. I sprinkled it with powdered sugar and roasted coconut.  

I think the secret to keep the cake from collapsing is mixing the batter for exactly two minutes.  And then I let it sit for about 4-5 minutes.  It was nice and fluffy.  The only thing I may do differently next time is glaze it with some type of icing.

Even though I'd read the reviews, I still ended up with a sunken cake.  I used a butter yellow cake mix and used sour cream in the mix. Next time I think that I'll let it cook the full 55 minutes. Although it didn't look perfect, it tasted good. I served it with a whipped cream/mascarpone cheese topping laced with almond extract.

Eh, it tastes like a green box cake. Nothing really special. Next time I'd add more almond extract and some real pistachios to see if that peps things up. Very average. I had no problems with my cake falling and I did get cake mix that had no pudding in it (duncan hines) as one other reviewer suggested.

Good recipe & easy to follow.  Substituted vanilla for almond (personal pref.) Used 1/4 c Mayo instead of oil (I do this with all cake box mixes). Also omitted the green food coloring, the pudding added enough coloring IMO. Would definitely add the coloring depending on the occasion though. :).

This was cute and tasted pretty good.  I used PP's advice to sub 1 cup of sour cream for 2 of the eggs and had no trouble with my cake collapsing.  Next time I think I will try making some sort of glaze or frosting.

This cake has a great flavor and it's easily to change things up by using other flavors of pudding and other types of cake mix.  I thought the pistachio flavor was just fine, not too strong but just enough to be noticeable.  The only change I made to the recipe was to leave out the green food coloring.  If you're making this for a St. Patrick's day celebration it would be a good idea to add a few drops b/c without it you get a yellow-green color that doesn't quite "pop".  Thanks for the recipe!

We loved this cake but I did make changes since some said it fell.  I make it like I make my lemon cake with 3/4 cup of water and 3/4 cup of oil.  The cake turned out great and will make it again.

My husband is not much of a cake person, but he LOVES pistachio pudding.  His words... "This cake is AMAZING." I was concerned about the cake falling based on other reviews, so I decided to add a cup of carbonated water, with only 3 eggs, 1/2 cup of oil, and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. I also took others' idea to use a pistachio pudding type icing (1 small box of pudding mix, 1 cup milk, 2/3 container of cool whip). Fantastic! Moist! Came out of the pan beautifully!

We have never had pistachio cake before, so I feel like this rating may be a bit unfair.  It makes a beautiful and fun cake, but the taste just wasn't for us.  For those searching for this type of cake...this is an easy cake to make and it looks nice.

Went by the directions and added sour cream.  Very moist but just tastes like a yellow cake.  Not much pistachio flavor...  but it's all gone.

This is an excellent cake, Moist and flavorfull.  I followed the recipe with no alterations.  While the pistachio flavor is not intense, the almond extract adds nuttiness and, unless you are a purist, the combo is quite tasty.  One thing I learned, follow the suggestions in reviews at your own risk.  One review said 'I melted white chocolate chips w/ several dashes of lime juice for icing.' When I melted the white chocolate chips and added a bit of lime juice and green food color I ended up with a lump of something resembling play-doh.  I let it heat some more and stirred more with no effect, until some of the boiling water splashed into it. I noticed some liquidity and added more water.  I ended up with a gelatinous mass (resembling green slime) that I was able to pour over the cake.  It oozed thickly down the sides.  The whole thing tastes wonderful and would make a truly great 'Shrek Cake'.  It was a hit at my office on St. Paddy's day in spite of the way it looked.

Just pulled my cake out of the oven, and it looks (and smells) great! After I had finished mixing up the batter, I realized I had no idea where my bundt pan was. So, I sprayed a 9x13 and dumped the batter in there. I baked it at 350 for 50 minutes, and it looks great, if not a tad too brown. I think I could've gone a few minutes less--maybe 45 instead--and it would've been fine. I am going to make the pistachio pudding/cool whip frosting. Quick and easy. Great recipe!

This is very easy to make, (followed the recipe exactly.) However I really didn't taste much Pistachio at all.  So- I probably won't make this again. It was a little disappointing. And guests wondered why the yellow cake I made was green. :-( (Because they couldn't taste the pistachio flavor either)

Really loved this cake, in fact I'm going to adapt more cakes with other pudding flavors, I did 2 eggs and 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I did seven drops of food coloring but I think it could have been even greener for St. Patrick's Day.  This was still delicious a couple of days later.

This is a very moist and delicious cake.  This is actually the second year I have made this for our St. Patty's day party and everyone loved it.  I actually had to take a few pieces off the tray during the party because I thought there wasn't going to be any left for me. Ha Ha. Very festive and fun!!

I didn't find that it tasted like pistachios. I couldn't find baking pistachios so I used hazelnuts to add to the flavor. I'd recommend trying a white cake,  you may get more of the flavor from the pudding in that case. 

Easy to make, turned out well after baking.

My mom makes a great pistachio cake and rather than call her for the recipe I decided to find one on this site.  This recipe was awful.  I followed directions to a T but it collapsed.  When I went to cut and serve it it was very crumbly and fell apart.  The green food coloring wasn't necessary.  And finally, the almond extract totally overpowered the pistachio flavoring and ruined the flavor of this cake.  I hate to criticize but to me this recipe was really bad.

This was the perfect dessert for St Patrick's Day dinner! I tossed in a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips just for fun. I didn't have the green food coloring but it turned out a lovely shade of green nonetheless. How fun!

As is I would only give it a 3 just because it is a little boring tasting.  It really needs a glaze added to it.  I will say that it is a very moist cake.  Not sure if I would bother making again.

Very fast and easy to make!  I was looking for a last minute dessert.  This was the first to go at the church supper.  I did not have almond extract or green food coloring.  For a glaze I heated 1/2 container chocolate frosting in the microwave for 20 seconds and drizzled on top.  The kids want to make it again.  Thanks Marcia!

Excellent cake!  I have made this multiple times and it is always a hit.  I frost it with cream cheese frosting for special occasions. Recently my husband had to go gluten free and I made this with gluten free cake mix. It turned out great.

I’ve been making this recipe now for several months and it always seems to be a winner in the flavor department. I had the same issue as everyone else with the cake falling and turning out with a bit of a gluey texture. So, I asked a baking friend for suggestions. Now, whenever I make this, I separate all the egg yolks from the whites and mix the yolks in with the rest of the recipe as described. Then, I whip up the whites separately to medium peaks and then gently fold them into the batter just before pouring the batter into my prepared pan(s). The other trick that helps is baking the cake for the full time, or longer if needed. Both of these have helped with the falling and improved the texture. So far, the most successful combination has been Devils Food cake mix with Coconut Creme pudding mix. I’ve also added a bit of instant coffee powder to the dry mix and coconut extract for the coconut flavoring to boost both flavors. Mix in some mini chocolate chips and it’s a huge hit!

Husband loved it.   I used sugar free yellow cake, 2 packages of sugar free pistachio pudding, added in some crushed pistachios and used 1 c water and then 1/4 c heavy cream and 1/4 c milk, 1/3 c oil, 3 eggs and almond extract. Sprinked  Unmistakably pistachio.    Did not fall.

Of all the cake mix pistachio cakes, I like this one the best. It’s my go-to after a cake disaster. I was on my way to making a homemade Funfetti cake when I cracked a bad egg into the butter/sugar mixture. I was so upset and grossed out that I couldn’t face starting over. Pistachio bundt cake to the rescue. Instead of powdered sugar on top, I made a thinnish buttercream glaze and topped it off with chopped, salted pistachios.

It's cake, cake can't get less than 3 stars.  I had pistachio cake a restaurant and looked this recipe up because we liked it so much.  This wasn't as tasty as I'd hope, but still pretty good.  I made this following the recipe exactly.

Yummy! I used Pillsbury Yellow cake mix which is 15.25 oz. The only other change I made was used 12 drops of green food coloring. It came out a perfect shade of green. Next time I'm going to add an extra 1/4 tsp. of almond extract; to me it didn't taste pistachio enough. I made it in a ceramic Bundt pan. Other than that the cake came out moist and delicious. My hubby and kids loved it. I didn't have any problems with it collapsing; I did use 4 eggs. Baked for 55 min. Definitely will make again. Very easy too!

Very under impressed.  I had this recipe for months and finally got the chance to make it.  Made it as written. Not dense enough to slice either, won’t make again.

I thought the texture of the cake was not good- too pudding like.  Also my cake didn't rise very high.  Would not a make it again.

This cake was delicious!  Cake mixes the 15.25 oz size are fine to use - there is no need to adjust anything else in the recipe.  We drizzled some cream cheese icing over the top.  Yummy!!
My project now is to try variations!  Tonight's variation was a moist chocolate cake mix, coconut cream pudding mix, no extract, no food coloring, and drizzle w/ left over cream cheese and fudge frosting.  VERY yummy!  Best cake recipe ever!

I made this cake for St. Patrick’s Day.  It was a huge hit with the family.  I didn’t have a tube pan, so I used two round cake pans and the recipe worked out well with them.  Like a previous baker, I mixed two tubs of cool whip with instant pistachio pudding as well and iced the cake with that.  It was the perfect addition to an already delicious and moist cake.  It made it taste so light and fluffy.  I even froze some of this cake and my dad enjoyed it later.  He said that he’ll make a special request for this cake for his birthday later this year!

Delicious! I followed the recipe as written except I didn't have almond extract so I used vanilla...and it was still delicious. Next time I will use the almond. I also baked in a 9x13 cake pan.

I like to make this cake for Saint Patrick's Day.  I did not change the recipe itself, but I baked it in a 13 x 9 inch pan according to the instructions on the box. Needless to say, the leprechauns made it disappear overnight.

I tried to not make any changes but I didn’t have almond extract so I had to use vanilla. I also only used 1 cup of water and left out the food coloring. I don’t think this cake is that great?  Not much flavor.  For sure needs icing other than a dusting of powdered sugar like I did. If I make again, I will add sour cream like others suggested and make icing.  Maybe even bake for less than 50 minutes since it’s not that moist?  I didn’t have any trouble with the cake collapsing.
UPDATE——
The second time I used almond extract and mixed a box of pistachio pudding with two 8 oz tubs of cool whip for icing.  I again used 1 cup of water and baked for only 45 minutes. The cake is much better with icing but still not that much flavor in the actual cake?  It’s okay not the best. I did add food coloring this time to make the green stand out more.

As soon as I took it out of the oven, it fell. When I tested it, it sprang back to the touch and a toothpick inserted cane out clean. I used fat-free, sugar free pudding, so I don’t know if that had something to do with it!??

I followed the recipe exactly - it looked and smelled great when it came out of the oven, but it collapsed while it cooled.  Turned into a very shrunken ring of nice tasting paste.  Cannot figure out what I did wrong...

To stop the cake from falling do not butter/flour the bundt pan.  If you do it will not be able to rise properly.  Also try adding shredded nuts and cinnamon and sugar sprinkled in layers into the cake. It is a pistachio nut cake and this is a delicious addition.

Made this for church today and only came home with a slice left. This cake was super good and nice and moist. Definitely a winner in our book. I used Duncan Hines cake mix as recommended and just did a simple glaze of powdered sugar with water poured over the top.

As I really don't like using box cakes, made a scratch yellow cake mix then followed the rest of the recipe. the batter was extremely runny and the cake came out gummy. The taste of the cake was delicious though. I'm gonna try this again but  I'm gonna tweek the yellow cake mix to increase the volume and maybe it won't be so runny. I'm also gonna try another reviewer's suggestion and use sour cream and eggs instead of JUST eggs. Hope 2nd time is a charm.

Easy and quick way to a delicious desert or to take to a potluck. I made the cool whip icing (cool whip and pistachio pudding mix).

I made this cake and a pistachio cream filling for the cake. I frosted the cake with the pistachio cream and sprinkle some grinded pistachio on the cake. 
It was delicious.

The four eggs and all the water seemed like overkill.  I just followed the recipe on the duncan hines yellow cake mix box and added the pistachio pudding mix.  I always substitute apple sauce for oil in any recipe and I glazed with a simple confectioner's sugar glaze.  Served for class birthday snack.  Turned out nice!

I tried this last week.  It came out great but I think I used sugar free pistachio pudding so it wasn't as sweet but nonetheless, it was sweet enough.

Although I didn't have a bundt cake pan & substituted vanilla for almond extract; it was delish!!! It was super easy and came out great as well!  Oven time is same as 9 X 13" sized dish from yellow cake instructions on box.  It tasted yummy & hubby loves pistachio cheese cake as well, so we frosted with already made cream cheese frosting though-it worked too.  Family loved it!

I make a similar version but I don't put in almond extract. It can overtake the pistachio flavor. I also add 1 1/4 cups chocolate chips for some extra goodness!

I love this cake! I make mine just the the recipe calls for and then add the pack of pudding. For the frosting I use 16 oz. whipping cream, 1/4 cup sugar and 1 pack of pudding mix. turns out great. You can also do this with any white cake mix and just change the pudding to what ever you want, and the same with making the frosting! 9 x 13 pan is what I usually use.

I made this cake yesterday and when I took it out of the oven it came up to the top of the pan.  However, after 15 min. it reduced to about half the size.  It didn't look nice at all. Like a miniature cake. I wouldn't make it again unless there is a fix.  Haven't tasted it yet as I made it for a birthday celebration.  Actually, I'm embarrassed to take it.

I just made this cake on Saturday and loved it and so did my parents and inlaws. I read a bunch of the reviews and didn't know if I should follow the recipe or tweak it based on other reviews. I decided to follow the recipe and it was super moist and didn't cave in. I did buy Duncan Hines yellow cake mix which was suggested. I loved this recipe and will def make it again. I did use 1 teaspoon of the almond extract to add more flavor. Enjoy!

Excellent. I made no changes to the recipe. I did add a powdered sugar glaze to give it a little added sweetness and that made it perfect. The cake didn't fall, was VERY moist and I liked the color a lot. Oh yeah, I may have added a tad more almond extract to make the taste pop. I added almond extract to the sugar glaze as well. Overall, excellent recipe. I would definitely make it again.

Great summer dessert!  I topped with whipped cream (heavy cream and confectioner sugar). I used pudding in the mix cake mix and my cake did not shrink.

Easy to make and delicious! But you can't really taste the pistachio =\ so next time I'm gonna try two boxes of pistachio pudding so it tasted mostly like yellow cake. Would gave more stars if you could taste pistachio more!

My cake turned out well, but I did make some modifications. I followed the recipe on the package of cake I used instead of using the amounts called for in this recipe. I didn't have a problem with it collapsing and the consistency was perfect. It was definitely fun to make and great for parties.

I made this exactly according to the recipe and had no problems at all.  it was very moist and not too sweet.  I did add a glaze made of amaretto, comf sugar and half/half.  It was delish.

Used one of the customized versions in the reviews (with cake mix, pudding mix, eggs and sour cream only). Turned out very fluffy, almost like a sponge cake.  Served it as a dinosaur cake (carved and decorated) for my son's birthday and got a lot of MMM's.

This was delicious. It was so moist! I didn't add any extra food coloring. It was a nice light lime green without it. I made a glaze of confectioners sugar, milk and almond extract that was just perfect!

I have used this recipe for over ten years and never had it collapse.  I always frost with a chocolate glaze made with brown sugar, butter and milk brought to a boil and then add chocolate chips and vanilla. Stir until chips are melted and then pour over the cake.  Always get complements!!!

This cake is FANTASTIC!!!!  I have never had Pistachio Cake before but I can tell you I will make this over and over again.  I did not have food coloring and it turned out a light pale green color.  So if you really don't care about how "green" it turns out you don't really need it.  I never really used almond extract before but I have to say it really taste good in this recipe.  I just sprinkled with some powdered sugar and it was perfect.  If you like pistachio pudding then you are going to love this cake!!!!

I made this cake over the weekend while visiting family in TN. It came out great & everyone loved it. It was very moist. The only complaint I have is that it needed more pistachio flavor. I think next time I will take others suggestions by making a pistachio icing. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious! I only gave 4 stars because I followed the other reviews and modified the recipe to avoid problems others had. I baked a large 11X15" cake so I was afraid of the cake sinking, so I baked at 300 degrees. I doubled the recipe, so I used 2 boxes white cake mix, only used 4 eggs, added 1 cup sour cream, and added 1 cup chopped pistachios. I layered the cake and filled with vanilla pudding and toasted coconut. PERFECT!

Quite good. I followed another reviewer's tip to add sour cream, use two eggs (instead of four), and bake at 300 degrees for 60 minutes ... The cake came out looking (and tasting) great!

This produces a very moist cake but lacked any real flavor. It is an easy recipe to try and would be fun to have on a "green" holiday, however, if you are looking for real taste, try another cake recipe.

This was INCREDIBLE, and extremely moist!!! My dark bundt pan says to reduce temp by 25 degrees, and I cooked for 57min.  I mixed for 3-4 min, added about 1/4 cup sour cream, 1 cup white chocolate chips, and no coloring.  The chips fell to the bottom, melted, and created a sweet crust--a nice surprise!  I made whipped cream with pistachio pudding, but everyone agreed that it wasn't needed, and a dusting of powdered sugar was enough.  This will be a regular dessert from now on!!!

This was wonderful!  I made it in two round cake pans (if you make it like this you have to cut the cook time back a litte).  I didn't have any almond extract but it tasted fine with out it.  I also made a cream cheese icing, added a layer of crushed pineapple and thick vanilla pudding to the middle, and finely sprinkled the top and sides with some toasted coconut.  It was amazing - one of my favorites.  Next time I might try finding a way to incorporate more pastachio pudding in the icing.

Turned out moist and yummy. I doubled the food coloring since I made it for St. Patricks Day.

I used a "butter" yellow cake mix that used butter instead of oil and skipped the almond flavoring.  The cake came out light and fluffy like angel cake and was very good :)

Very easy, delightful alternative to have for others who don't care for chocolate desserts.
