Such an easy recipe! I whipped it up in less than five minutes! I used four ounces of cream cheese, and substituted a jar of tart red cherries in syrup for the canned pie filling. I also used a graham cracker crust since I'm not a huge fan of regular pie crust. Delicious! Not sure why it's called French?

I have had this recipe forever. My Mom always made it with Dream Whip. I am not a fan of chemicals so I use the real whipped cream. It is always delicious and a big hit and I never have to worry about leftovers as it gets eaten very quickly. I dont know why it is called French either but it is a good way to differentiate from a standard cherry pie and it is a LOT less work.
