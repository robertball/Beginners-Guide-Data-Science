Thanks Thea for such a great recipe! I've made these a few times and our family and friends think they are REALLY REALLY GOOD! This recipe is a versatile one - I made a few small changes to suit my own taste: In place of 3 Tabls of the honey I added 3 Tabls Black Strap Molasses I left out the chocolate chips and used pecans instead of walnuts. Delicious!

I used Trader Joe's almond butter and homemade "pumpkin pie" granola. Because we don't care for walnuts I used finely chopped almonds. YUM. We absolutely loved these. SO good. Great way to use a little bit of everything and that last half cup or so of granola PLUS it's great for little hands to help make something in the kitchen with Mom.

Yum! I used granola with dried cranberries and apricots with crunchy peanut butter and honey omitted the other ingredients and they came out quite tasty!

These are very good and so easy to make. My kids think they are great and are a nice after school snack while they wait for supper. I would imagine that these would freeze well too. Thanks for the recipe.

You definitely need to chill the mixture BEFORE you shape it into balls.
