I wish I could divide the turkey patties from the cranberry sauce as far as this rating goes. From now on I will prepare the turky patties but ditch the sauce. I think the turkey was wonderful and nice and healthy and lean and then all that was taken away with a heavy sweeet cranberry sauce.I thought it was a lot of work as well to go back and forth from the over and stove top adding and removing things. Again the turky was wonderful and I'll use that part again!

Sauce was terrible would have been better without the cream.

The Turkey patties are great. I avoided the sauce all together. I mixed the whole cranberries from the cranberry sauce in with the ground turkey. We loved it. It's the best turkey burger I've ever tasted. Kudos!

The sauce is wonderful. I'm thinking about serving it with the gravy for Thanksgiving.

These were pretty good- I cut the cream in half but next time I'll also use less bread crumbs.

First impression: Breakfast sausage. 'Not what I'd like for a burger turkey or not; but for that it was fine. Since I had 20oz mixed turkey I pretty much upped all the ingredients by 1/4 - except for the eggs which I didn't add at all. For 20oz turkey: 1/2c plain breadcrumbs (yeah more would've been okay; but I didn't want meatloaf either) 1/4t each granulated garlic & cayenne 1 1/4t each salt & paprika 1/2t black pepper 1/2t 1/8t sage. I feel like I should make biscuits for these.:/ I didn't play with the cranberry business at all. I don't want to make biscuits but I probably will.

My kids loved this one. I made it completely as directed. Only one of my kids preferred the sauce only on mashed potatoes rather than the meat. My fairly picky eater LOVED it and wanted more. Very flavorful and moist.
