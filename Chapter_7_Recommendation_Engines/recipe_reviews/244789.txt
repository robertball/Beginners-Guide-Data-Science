I really enjoyed this, however, next time I will use a little less vinegar and only serve it as a starter or side dish.  Because it is just myself and my granddaughter I served it as a main course and it was to rich to finish.

way too greasy and spicy.  I like spicy food and thought that this would be good, but i did not like it.

Oh, Chef, you've done it again. Loved this recipe. I didn't have patty pan, so just used chopped up zucchini and served over rice.
