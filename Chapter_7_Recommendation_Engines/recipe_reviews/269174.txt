It cooked beautifully and is really tasty. It would be a great side dish or alternative to stuffing. We're eating as a vegetarian entree.

Totally delicious. Whole dish eaten in one sitting. Everyone said it was the best thing I made. Yeah. 
And Iâ€™ve made it a second time already for a pot luck supper. It was a winner!

Enjoyed this marvelous recipe at Thanksgiving Dinner.  My nephew made it according to the directions.  This recipe will be replacing our standard stuffing...it was delicious.

I was very impressed  with this recipe.  It was easy to assemble and was quite moist.  It did take more than the 1/2 lb. sourdough to make the 7 c. of bread cubes required.  This is actually going to bump my regular stuffing out of the Thanksgiving rotation this year.

I maybe used a little extra cheese as I always seem to do but hubby and I both like it as it is. The leek flavor is very present in this and hubby, of course wanted it to be like 'in the bird stuffing'.  I would use a little more shallow pan  and maybe increase the moisture a bit. Over all, I will make this again.
