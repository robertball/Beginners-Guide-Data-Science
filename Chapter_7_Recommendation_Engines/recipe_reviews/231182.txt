V. Good soup, would make again.  Substituted 2 finely minced leeks for the onion [had them on hand], used chicken broth and added 1T granulated chicken broth. Used frozen corn [only 2cups]. Skipped the nuts and yeast [didn't have them].  Skipped the part about blending some in blender as it was thick and creamy enough. Added Salt and Pepper to taste and topped with shredded sharp cheddar cheese.With modifications this did not make more than 6 hearty bowls. Chunky and satisfying!

I thought this was a really good recipe!  I will say it makes a lot!  I have never used the nutritional yeast and was sceptial but it had a good flavor and my husband had two bowls.  I was full after one and didn't crave anything else.

I actually put this in my Crock Pot and loved it!  When it came time to mix the cashews with the broth, I just dipped out some of the broth from the slow cooker and boom - done!  The one thing I didn't use was the nutritional yeast simply because I couldn't find it at the store.  I do intend to make this again, so I'm going to scope out some health food stores and hope I find some.  I also used fresh thyme because I had some and needed to use it.  I scaled down the recipe to 6 servings and it still made a LOT so keep that in mind when making this.  Finally, I had to use half sweet potatoes and half red potatoes because that's all I had in the pantry (still rather tasty!)  Nice winter soup - thanks!

I have been making this a lot.  Being vegan it's not easy to make dishes that my family will eat.  My husband loves this and he is not vegan.

This is DELICIOUS!  So filling and you definitely can't tell it's vegan so you don't feel like you're missing out on anything.  The perfect cold-weather meal.

Very tasty and satisfying chowder.  I was curious to see how well the cashews worked, and they worked very well.  I used raw cashews and they added a creaminess without making the chowder taste particularly nutty.  I tried to make my work easier by slicing all of my veggies in the food processor, but the pieces weren't especially attractive, so I pureed everything except the 6 c of corn.  This made my soup less attractive, but it sure tasted good.  Next time I'll aim for a prettier soup with nicely chopped veggies.  I used a slow cooker for convenience as was suggested by another reviewer.  My husband ate two big bowls full and kept talking about how good the chowder was!  Thanks!

Definitely will make again. When I made it it was enough to feed everyone and still have lots of leftovers. It was a great way to use up some potatoes and cauliflower that was getting a bit long in the tooth. I grated the potatoes and found that they completely dissolved during the cooking process to create an even more luxuriously thick and "creamy" chowder.
