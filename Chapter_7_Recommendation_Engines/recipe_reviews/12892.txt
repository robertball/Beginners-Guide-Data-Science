Wow! The salt measurement is way too excessive! I had to boil 2 potatoes in it to try to remove it.Once I got the salt falvor reduced, I found that the chili has a wonderful flavor and is very full bodied without being excessively hot.I added an extra 14.5ounce can of stewed tomatoes and I used Moose Drool Beer. I will make this again, however I will ELIMINATE THE 1 TABLESPOON OF SALT. The beef bouillon adds more than enough. Too bad I didn't read the other reviews first! About 5 out of 30 people said this was way too salty. The potato idea works for those of you who forget to read the reviews first!

I doubled the garlic, used a dark lager and only used a pinch of salt. I didn't have pinto beans but I did have organic black beans so I used those. This was tasty--very beefy. This was quite easy, which I appreciated after the day I had. I basically sauteed the veggies and meat and threw everything in the crockpot all day, just to save on time and energy. Close to my favorite chili--I think it could use a can of tomato paste but quite good. My husband remarked this would be great in chili dip.

I scaled this recipe up the 36 for my fraternity. It was fun to cook (I would recommend adding a potpourri of hot peppers for flavor and color) and it was a huge hit! I served it with rice and with Fritos for dipping. This was the third AllRecipes.com chili recipe I tried and it blew the other two away. Be careful with the salt though, all that beef bouillon creeps up on you.

Count me among the fans of this recipe.  Even before the two to three hours of simmering, this stuff was irresistable!  I put a large spoonful in a bowl to "test" it, and ended up eating 2 1/2 bowls in nothing flat.  I did use hamburger instead of beef chuck and left out the tablespoon of salt.  Indeed, the salt factor was perfect without additional salt.  I enjoy experimenting with chili recipes, and this is one of the best ever!

This recipe didn't work for me at all. It was so salty that I had to add everything in my cabinet to dilute it and then it was just a big disappointment.

No wonder this has such fabulous reviews -its delicious!!  We were hungry for chili, and didn't want to go to the store for my normal cheater chili mix, so decided to try it from scratch.  Who knew?  Only switch was a can of beef broth for the boullion, what I had on hand.  We enjoyed this over tortilla chips with all the toppings as a super nacho supper.  Thanks Christine and Jim!!

This is the best chili I've ever made!  The ingredients give it a wonderful, complex flavor.  This is a restaurant quality chili in my opinion.  I do increase the spice amounts a bit for my personal taste.  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!!

I made this for Monday Night Football and it was a hit! (As were the Ravens!!!) I did use 3.8lbs of ground beef instead of chuck (just because we like it that way) and at the end I added an extra can of "Zesty Chili Beans" with the pintos. The beer made it great. This one's a keeper!

The cooking time is way too long for me. This recipe should cook to well done in half this time. I would cut back on the cumin and the salt. And, my greatest pet peeve about most chili is that it is too soupy. I would omit the beer and tomato sauce. I prefer diced tomatoes over stewed tomatoes as the sauce is thicker. I prefer a meaty chili, not a soupy one.

this was one of the best chili recipes i've made in a long time. i did cut the salt back to 1 TEASPOON and used 3 cans of beans and 1 lb. ground beef along with 2 lbs of chuck roast (cubed). i made it in the slow cooker and can't stop eating it. the stewed tomatoes are especially nice.

This was an amazing reciepe. Im sure it would be good with ground beef too, but so far this is good. I did add some garlic. red bell pepper and onion powder to it too, and made it very flavorful.

Used ground meat because it's what I had but look forward to using the chuck as that is my preference for  chili. Used water instead of beer, skipped the salt and used sodium free bouillon, teaspoons instead of tablespoons.  Cut cumin by half and added just a pinch of cinnamon.

This was delicious!  This will be my new go-to recipe from now on.  My only addition was two finely chopped (seeded) chile peppers which just gave it a little kick.  Thank you!

My boyfriend wanted me to make 'beer chili' like his mother used to make.  Tough order!  This recipe did the trick.  It's a keeper.  I used ground beef though as that's how she did it and so it needed more sauce.  I doubled the tomato sauce and beer(dark), increased each seasoning a bit.  Except salt.  I only added a touch of salt. Very, very good!

I was SO disappointed with this recipe.  YUCK!  Not only was it way too salty, but for the cost of all of the meat and spices, it seems pretty expensive.  I honestly cannot understand how this recipe was so highly rated.  My husband said to toss this recipe, and I agree...I ended up tossing the chili too! :(

I made this chili for a group of guys at a poker party.  It had just the right combination of spices and the meat was perfect.  I have made it several times, always with great reviews

Absolutely a great savory experience. I never had a problem with the salt (taste as you go w/salt always). Othewise the ingredient proportions are spot-on, this is restaurant quality. If you throw in a few hot peppers, make sure that the stew sits overnight to mellow their fruity flavors otherwise it's a bit too sweet and funky. You won't believe what this tastes like the next day...

I really wished I had read the reviews before making this. It had way too much salt; even the salt loving husband said so.  I used no salt added tomato sauce and that didn't help cut the salt factor at all. I think this would definitely be an amazing recipe if the TBSP of salt was omitted. I will make it again and maybe add a can of Rotel to kick it up a little.

Yum! A couple of adjustments and it's incredible!  Nothing better in a snow storm than a nice pot of great chili! This recipe is awesome! TY from a chili beginner that just stole the show! :D

I have adjusted this recipe to make it way less salty.  The only actual salt that I use is to salt the meat when I start cooking it and use 3 tablespoons of "better than bouillon" beef flavoring.  I also use only 3 tablespoons of Chili Powder and 1 tablespoon of cumin (obviously, this is a season to taste deal here).  No recipe is exact when it comes to seasoning but the base of this chili is the best we've ever had!  :D

This is my favorite chili recipe!  I use it all the time... the only change I make is to use dried beans, soaked overnight (not canned).  I use cubed chuck roast for the meat... but it tastes great with ground chicken or turkey too!  The flavors really pop out with the white meat.

The BEST chili I've ever had!  Tastes better the next day.  I bought some macaroni and cheese from the local deli and mixed it up with the leftovers.  Made an awesome chili-mac!  Would also taste wonderful mixed with Velveeta Cheese as a dip for tortilla chips.

The best chili I ever made.  I went with low salt tomato sauce and stewed tomatos and did not add any salt.  I also deleted the beans so it is true chili, not chili con carne...turned out fabulous.

I probably screwed this recipe up somehow because I couldn't even eat it.  I reduced it to 4 servings and the measurements were awkward.  I guessed on measuring most of the spices.  I have also never had chili with beer in it and I could really smell it when I was cooking.  Not pleasant.  I will probably not try this recipe again.  I wish I did not reduce the # of servings because maybe it would have turned out better.

I have looked for years for a really good chili recipe, and now I have found it!!  I cooked it on a Saturday which happened to be the first cool snap we have had.  The aromas from the spice made the entire house smell wonderful.  My family loves this chili and has already requested it again!!

This was delicious! Eating this as I type. After reading the reviews and seeing complaints about saltiness (being sensitive to salt myself) I tried my best to use all low sodium ingredients, omitted the salt, and used just a couple of bouillon cubes instead of the four tablespoons of granules, as I didn't have any.

I made the sauce (basically everything but the meat, onions, garlic, and beans) the night beforehand, adding a small can of tomato paste and four bay leaves instead of two. I think leaving the mixture in the fridge overnight helped everything mingle.

The day of, I browned ground beef with half a large onion (I'm a lightweight when it comes to cutting onions) with garlic powder (as I didn't have cloves.) I drained the mix then poured everything (waiting on the beans, using black instead of pinto) into my crockpot for a few hours.

I don't see where the complaints about spiciness come from. When I went to add the beans on the last leg of the recipe, it was still this side of bland- and I'm a total baby when it comes to spicy food! So I added a couple of shakes of all the spices used. 

Served with a dollop of sour cream, grated cheddar, and a handful of fritos! Next time will probably add another can of black beans, another can of tomato paste, and another half or full pound of meat, and perhaps some chives/green onion on top of the sour cream for garnish.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe. I added a few ingredients to it for a little something extra. I added a 1/2 tablespoon of cinnamon and an ounce of semisweet baking chocolate. These ingredients are common in many Mexican dishes and were really a nice addition to the chili. I also added 1 1/2 tablespoons of hot sauce. Fantastic!

Very good! I cut the recipe in half using 1 lb. of ground pork.  I substituted the navy beans for 1 can of chili beans and 1 can of light kidney beans, since that's all I had on hand.  It turned out wonderfully!  This is a keeper for us for sure!!

I love this chili!  I omit the salt since the boullion is salty enough.  I also use Rotel tomatoes to add some spice instead of plain tomatoes.  We serve this with fritos and cheese and a cinnamon roll on the side.  Yum!!!

Really good. Perfect blend of spices. I like my chili with a little more tomato than most people so I doubled the tomato sauce and added some diced tomatoes. That was the only change I made and it turned out great.

OMG this was fantastic! If I make this recipe with my own modifications I think I could actually compete with my boyfriends dad's chili! Previous to this I refused to make chili for him but this is giving me some encouragement. I added both boullion cubes but omitted the extra salt. Next time I'll add green peppers, probably mix it up with beef cubes,ground beef and turkey as well.

This chili was so wonderful. I'm only giving it 4 stars because it wa sway too salty. Without the salt, it would have been perfect!

Also, not using the reserved juice"should have been mentioned.

Fantastic. Used ground sirloin and mild sausage with black beans...just because I love them! I also added about 1/2 c. of strong coffee for a deeper flavor. Sounds strange, but it really is good. Stirred in some fresh cilantro minutes before serving. Garnished with sour cream, shredded cheese, a spring of cilantro and a few fritos. Oh so oood on a crisp fall evening. Try it...you'll like it!

I used this recipe for my company picnic and it was a great success.  After reading the other reviews, I modified the amount of salt by using no salt stewed tomatoes and added 3/4 the amount of bouillon.  I also added any extra salt by taste.  I used beef sirloin instead of beef chuck and added two green peppers along with the onions and garlic.  I used one 14.5 oz can of Guinness for the beer. I also included the juice from the canned tomatoes, because I like my chili a little thinner.  Great recipe!

Chile is one of my favorite dishes. I was getting a little tired of the chili recipe that I have been using "forever", it was starting to taste real blah, I wanted more flavor, so I decided to try something new. This recipe is the one.  It was so rich and bursting with flavor, you can almost taste every ingredient.  We just loved it.  I followed the recipe except for the following: I used sirloin instead of beef chuck, I used all no salt products, used non alcoholic dark beer, used Slenda instead of brown sugar (only added 1/2 tbl) and I added a little water because we don't like real thick chili and this one is pretty thick.  I can't wait to make it again. Thank you for this recipe.

This recipe tasted great, so I'll definitely make it again. Although I cut it in half, thinking it would make 6 servings (there are only two of us), when it actually made about 4 servings. So next time, I'll make the entire thing. I also threw in a bit of cinnamon and leftover seranno peppers from the guacamole we made the same night.

I made this one with Veggie Ground Round in place of the meat and it was excellent!!  Out of all the chili recipes I've tried - this is the one.  Next time though, I'll cut down on the liquid - it was a little too "soupy".

I made this for my superbowl party, and it was definitely a hit!  My husband bought ground beef instead, because he thought that I may have made a mistake on the shopping list.  I also liked the addition of the bottle of beer.  We ate this for 2-3 days afterwards, and it was delicious!  I did not add the beef bouillon, but added extra tomatoes instead.

This is the best chili recipe I've ever used.  I did add some extra beans and some cubed london broil, as it was a little soupier than I usually prefer.  But the spicing is great, and the idea of freezing the ground beef before cubing it added a lot to the texture.  I'm keeping this recipe.  It takes longer than some recipes, but good chili takes time.

My husband is very particular with his chili.  When I decided to make this for our upcoming Super Bowl party, he was very skeptical, particularly when I added the can of beer.  But I have to tell you, he is a believer now!  I scaled back on the chili powder and cumin, but made everything else according to the recipe, and it is absolutely delicious.  Definitely a keeper, just ask my husband!

This is a great recipe.  We had a bon-fire and I  scaled the recipe up for 30 people
and it was the hit of the party!  If I could add 25 more rating they would all be 
5 stars.

I made this chili for some friends that came over for Monday Night Football and it was a big success.  Surprisingly had somewhat of a sweet taste despite all the chili powder - but the fritos we served with it balanced it out.  Definetely worth a shot!

This chilli was very good.  We enjoyed the dynamic the beer added to it.  I also was intrigued by the addition of beef bouillon.  It turned out quite enjoyable.  After reading the reviews, I looked over the ingredients to see where the issue with the salt occurred.  I am guessing the TBSP of salt is an error.  All of the ingredients we used were unsalted except the beef bouillon powder.  It was plenty salty.  Anyone that cooks should know a TBSP of salt in anything will be excessive.  There was enough salt in the bouillon powder for our taste.  My 7 year old ate 2 bowls of this; which is close to a miracle.  He enjoyed dipping nacho chips into it.  I enjoyed it with the addition of sour cream and grated cheddar.  Hubby even enjoyed the taste which is the first time in our marriage he has liked a chilli I made.  I took off one star for the TBSP of salt because it makes me question the rest of the ingredients/measurements.  Otherwise an excellent chilli.  I am guessing it will improve overnight.  The cooking instructions were fine and any less time the flavours barely have time to meld at all. Update: it was even better over the next few days. My whole family ate bowl after bowl. This is a miracle. I have tried possibly 10 chili recipes before this and none were approved.  This one is the only chili recipe that will be saved in my book.

Made this chili over the weekend and I have to say it was amazing.   As most other reviews state, don't add the salt.  I also replaced 1 can of the stewed tomatoes with 2 small cans of Rotel.  This was my first time ever making Chili and I was definitely impressed.   Also, I used 2lbs of ground beef instead of 3 lbs of beef chuck that was listed.   Only thing I'm going to change for next time is adding some veggies/jalapenos, and possibly adding another can of tomato sauce as it was a bit thick for my taste.

I made 2  8Qt crock pots  for family.  I cooked up 2 5lb packages of lean ground beef and added the seasonings as i cooked the meat. I added "no salt  added" tomatoes and a 2 red peppers. Otherwise I followed the recipe except for measurements since I was making such a large amount.  Also made  2  pans of homemade corn bread with added frozen corn to go with the chili.  By cooking the meat the day before, this was an easy crock pot dinner for 12 adults and 5 children, with just enough for lunch for a few the next day. NO leftovers, they loved it. Thanks Jim.

This is the best chili I have ever made or tasted!  We love it!  Made a few changes for our tastes..cut back on cumin, salt  and chili powder to about half.  We used chili ground chuck and used kidney beans instead of the pinto and roast.  The flavor is so deep and rich.  Some of the ingredients were not our usual items but the blend is fantastic!  We made a big pot and froze the rest.  Had our first frozen batch and it is just as good.  Will made this again and again!

This is good chili.  Only changes we made were to use ground chuck, left out the boullion, reduced the salt, and added a diced jalepeno and some chopped bell peppers.  Good stuff; good seasoning and good spice.

I made this about 2 years ago and my mother is dying for this recipe...I couldn't give it to her because it took me a while to find it...I invited my friends over to try it, and it didn't see the light of tomorrow...people were licking bowls, asking for seconds...thirds...leaving no leftovers...so i wrote the recipe down, but it was a craptastic version of the real thing. I went on a search for it and I found it!!! So, since I found it, it's my main dish for Thanksgiving this year...cooking as I post....the first time I used Yeungling...this year I'm trying Budweiser Black Crown...loooooooove this recipe!!!

This recipe is great, even my picky son will eat it. After reading a few reviews I cut the salt in half. I also like mine a  bit spicy so I added 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and I will keep using this recipe.

Kid tested and mother approved!! Good Sunday afternoon football chili!  Left out the extra salt and everybody, kids and old dogs alike, loved it!  Had a little of Rhonda Mellots' Baked Corn (bread) with it, then died and went to heaven!

I'm not a chili person, I love it as is except I cut the salt considerably.  I use maybe a teaspoon of Kosher salt and maybe 2 TAblespoons of the boullion granules.

I have made many chili recipes and this is by far the best. I made it for a chili cook off and took first prize. The only thing I added was 2 chili peppers for a little more heat. Can't wait to make again!

I thought this had a wonderful, well balanced flavor.  And I like the addition of pinto beans instead of kidney beans.  I threw everything in the crock pot on medium for about 6 hrs.  It was a little thicker than we like, so I just added a bit of water to thin it some.  Thanks for the great recipe, Christine L.

Although my husband liked the chili a lot the first night, I found it too sweet.  The second day it was even worse.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly and maybe that was the problem.

My friends, family, and myself love this chili.  But I did make some adjustments to it.  I doubled the amount of tomato sauce, put about a bottle and a half of beer, used 2 tsp. of salt, salt free bouillon, and about a cup of jalapeno.  I also used my slow cooker covered to cook this chili for 8 hours.  I add all the ingredients together except for the beans which I wait for the last 1/2 hour to add still.  Ground chuck was my preference for the meat also.

We loved this chili.  It's lower carb than most so fine for a diabetic.  I used less salt, after reading reviews, and also added a little cinnamon and cocoa for depth.  Delicious.  I sized the recipe for 8 so I could use 2 pounds of ground beef, I would have used a little more beans.  I used fire-roasted diced tomatoes from the store and they were nice in this.

As is, this was just ok. I followed the advice of the others here and omitted the salt altogether and halved the amount of boullion. I also omitted the beans. I added about another 1/4 c. of brown sugar and a few tablespoons of Cheech Marin's chipoltle hot sauce. I also used 2 lbs. ground turkey and 1 lb. ground beef. With the extra brown sugar and the hot sauce, the flavor was great!

Overall, seemed like a crowd pleaser, but it came off a little "chalky," maybe because of all the spices (and not a ton of liquid).  A fairly thick chili, which required a considerable amount of pot-watching, e.g., adding fluids.  I ended up adding in all reserved liquids, including opening a new can of tomato sauce  I like my chilis a little thinner and more basic, I guess.

I did not read the reviews and kept the salt... WAY TOO SALTY! It is a great chili recipe but does not need the salt or maybe not as much beef bouillon.  The next time I make it I will omit the salt and taste as I'm adding the beef bouillon granules.  I love green peppers so I added in green peppers with the onion and garlic.

Delicious and easy to make. Took advice of others and eliminated extra salt, and it tasted awesome!

This is the best chili I have ever made. I listened to the reviews about the salt and omitted it because the beef boullion did the trick. The next time I make it, I am going to mix chuck steak with ground beef or ground turkey because for some reason the chuck did not get as tender as I would have liked. The flavor was excellent however so I do not hesitate giving this recipe 5 stars!!!!!

Meat was a little tough. Not sure what to do about that. Also, definitely a little salty. Recommend leaving out the salt that it calls for (recipe already includes beef bouillon, which is salty.) All in all, quite good though!

My husband made this for a chili cookoff and won 3rd place...everyone was talking about it and it was the best chili I've ever had!!  Bought beef roast as the meat and browned in EVOO (extra virgin olive oil - thanks for the abbreviation, Rachael Ray, Food Network) and used an entire can of Guinness for the beer.  Omitted the salt and will use less boullion next time, but other than that, wouldn't change a thing!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe and so does everyone I make it for!!! Yes, it takes a lot of spices and time but is well worth it. I try and stock up on spices when they are on sale just so I can make this chili all winter long!!! I usually use half ground beef and half beef for stew. I do eliminate that extra salt...the beef bouillon more than makes up for it. We like to serve our chili Hard Time Cafe style-on a bed of fritos topped with chopped onion, cheese, and sour cream, maybe a bit of jalapeno fresh from the garden.  Thanks for such a great recipe!!!!

This is my favorite chili recipe - I make it all the time.  I usually use a combination of chuck and ground beef - I think the ground beef adds more flavor.  I also add fresh cilantro.

I cut the recipe in half, and used a combination of ground beef and pork (still used a whole beer though!)  It was wonderful!  I thought the spices were great, and I had no problems with the salt like others have said... just personal taste I guess.  I also added a chopped habenero to heat it up.  This is my new regular chili recipe.

DON'T MAKE THIS RECIPE!  The idea is right, but the seasonings are out of porportion.  The 5 T of chili powder will overwhelm it alone.  I made it, but put in 13 of the spices called for and it came out very tasty, even if still a bit over flavored.
