Buckwheat is such as strong flavor that this could have used more seasoning!  I felt that the amount of buckwheat compared to the squash and beans was overwhelming.  Next time, I'll cut the amount of buckwheat in half! Maybe the toasted buckwheat would make this better,too!

This had so much flavour! We served it with more parmesan and lemon slices on the side so it could be customized to taste by sprinkling more on. A really great way to dress up something so healthy. I will definitely make this again!

I used chopped toasted pecans and navy beans and found it very enjoyable.

This would be great with garlic & onions and stuffed into peppers or cabbage leaves.  Bake with tomato sauce.  Guess it wouldn't be a salad anymore!
