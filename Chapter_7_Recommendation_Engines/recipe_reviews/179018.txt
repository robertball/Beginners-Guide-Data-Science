Yummy -- with some modifications. I didn't enjoy the tomato flavor of the soup - it overpowered the dish, and wasn't quite the flavor I was looking for. So, I added a beef bouilion cube, and some "Chinese 5 Spice" (A combo of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg,anise and cloves) and a bit more ginger. I didn't measure -- but sprinkled it generously to taste. It improved this recipe dramatically.

Simply amazing! I added a few things to make it even better though. First I added about 2 teas. beef boulion. Then I finely sliced 1 medium onion, chopped 2 green onions, finely chopped about 2 teas. fresh ginger and also added black pepper. I also doubled the sauce part of the dish because it seemed like it wouldn't be enough.

Wow! Who would have thought tomato soup would make an EXCELLENT beef broccoli? Rather than plain tomato, I used Campbell's Tomato Bisque. The recipe did not specify the type vinegar, so I used red wine vinegar, and doubled the amount. I added mushrooms and minced onions. To thicken the sauce, I added 1 T cornstarch mixed with 2 T cold water, and brought it to a boil. 1/4 t crushed red peppers was a bit mild. You could easily use 1 t for a zestier taste. I served it over fried rice. Very good recipe, thanks.

This is a good, easy way to make beef and broccoli stir-fry. I never would have thought to use tomato soup. I did change a couple of things, thanks to previous reviewers. I only used half a can of tomato soup and I used Chinese 5 spice instead of the red pepper flakes. I only used 1/4 tsp. of the 5 spice because I had never used it before and didn't know how spicy it would be. But I think next time I will use 1/2 tsp. I strongly recommend the 5 spice. It added really great flavor. My husband raved about it. I wanted to add fresh mushrooms, but didn't have any on hand. Will do this next time. Note: It didn't make 4 servings for us. The two of us ate almost all of it; there was just a bit leftover. Not even a whole serving. So go ahead and make the whole batch if cooking for two. I would double it for four.

I didn't have tomato soup on hand, so I swapped a can of tomato paste mixed with some water and a bit of sugar tossed in.  This recipe is amazing!!!

I started using this one a long time ago when all I ate was soup and romen noodles.  It is the best. Only bad part is now I can't enjoy the beef and broc. you get from the take out places.

Really great quick meal on a weekday night! I used fresh garlic, and a few drops of sesame oil to add to the asian flavor...but otherwise followed word for word. One tip, add all the liquid ingredients in a bowl first then add them easily to the beef...

Well, this had perfect ingredients for me. I did change a few things...Becusse my husbands hates dishes with soup, I added 1/2 a small can of tomato paste + 1 small can of water instead. It thickened up nicely. I always cook with oniions, so this went with the steak strips. I used 1/3 package of a (2lb) bag of frozen broccoli. I added the spices last. It looked thick and rich. I served this with a brown rice combo of tomatoes and veggies ---It is fast and easy--I'll be making this again!! Thanks very much.

This was really yummy!  I had to use another brand of tomato soup (non condensed) b/c it was what I had on hand; just let it cook down longer. And wow, this is really good, thanks!

Following this recipe will leave you with something that reminds me too much of fast food BBQ sauce. I was able to make it edible before adding the broccoli, but I still barely finished half my plate (I am not a picky eater and hate wasting food) It was extremely salty even I after I diluted it with my additions.  The idea of using tomato sauce in a similar dish is intriguing, but this whole recipe would need reworked to make it successful.

This was really easy and good to make.  I did make 2 changes to the recipe.  I  grilled the steak first to give it that flavor. then put in the the pan with the other ingredients.  I used red wine vinegar instead of regular vinegar.  it turned out great and spicy.  if you don't like the tomato flavor split the measurement in 1/2.  Thanks for sharing.

Liked it, but it needed something more, something sweet... I'll try it again and play with the spices a bit.

Hmm, I really don't know what to say about this one. I read the reviews before making it. I added some beef bouillon and some Chinese 5-spice as many suggested. It just wasn't very good. I should have tried it a written but I don't know that it would have made much of a difference.  There were no fans in my house.

Don't be deceived by all the high ratings. This recipe is a quick one, but doesn't taste that great. The tomato flavor was odd. We won't be making it again.

My husband and I love this and have made it many, many times. I am a big lover of tomatoes in general, so I personally find the sauce to be fantastic! I have subbed light soy in the past without a problem, and sometimes I cut down on it just to save on the sodium.

This is good and really easy! If your sauce tastes too tomatoey, add a bit more soy and garlic salt. I also added chopped garlic, onion, and red bell pepper to the mix. Good stuff!

This was a tasty, easy recipe, but I did make some changes. I added more vegetables (1/2 white onion, 1/2 red bell pepper, 1/4 lb sliced mushrooms), reduced the vegetable oil and soup each by half to make the recipe a little healthier (there was still plenty of sauce), and used fresh garlic in place of garlic powder and chili garlic paste in place of pepper flakes. I served it with tangy purple cabbage coleslaw.

I do not normally rate things on here as honestly, I forget.  But this recipe is sooo perfect that it would be impossible to not remember!!  I followed the direcetions exactly and my husband and 3 kids gobbled this up!  I was very hesitant because tomato soup, really??  But let me tell you, it works!  We make this 2 to 3 times a month.  Definitely a keeper!

I was actually surprised how good this was with the tomato soup, the sauce was a little too strong for my personal taste but it was enjoyable enough... Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good base recipe.  I doubled the sauce and used 1 (18.7 oz.) can of Campbell's Zesty Tomato Bisque (which cut the tomato soup in half from original recipe), 1/2 large onion cut julienne style, 2 beef bouillon cubes dissolved in 1/2 cup hot water (crush them first), 2 TBS. Chinese black vinegar, 1-2 TBS. fresh grated ginger (I only added 1 TBS. but I think 2 might be better), 1 tsp. Chinese 5 spice, about 1 TBS. or so of sugar to off set the acidity,and used a little cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce.  My family loved it. The recipe was greatly modified but as written it seems like it would be kind of bland and my family loved the end result.

We thought this was really good! Our beef came out a bit chewy - might try a different cut next time. We followed the recipe but also listened to some of the other reviewers and added 1 cube of beef bullion, a little sesame oil and a little ginger. We'll definitely make this again!

I tried this dish last night and it turned out better than I expected. Like others, I also made some changes. For starters, I mixed together soy sauce and garlic powder (next time I would use fresh garlic and also add ginger), so that I could marinate the steak for 30 mintues. Also, I omitted the can of tomato soup, because it just didn't seemed like it belonged in the dish. Lastly, I added more soy sauce and water, so that I could have "sauce" to put over the rice. All in all, the dish was good and I would defintely make it again.

I marinated the beef strips in the soy sauce, vinegar, garlic powder and crushed red pepper mixture for around 30 mins and stir-fried it in a skillet. After it is almost done, I poured in the tomato soup and the rest of the marinade. It is really easy to prepare and the taste is fine. I used a black rice vinegar and that definitely intensified the taste of the dish. Overall a tasty dish although I suspect that leaving out the tomato soup might result in just as tasty a dish, if not better.

This had really good flavor. didn't take long at all. I was surprised that the tomato soup didn't ruin it. it wasn't too tomato-y. it was a bit spicy but not so much to burn one's mouth. my husband even had seconds, and he's picky.

I've made this twice now, and the second time (with modifications) was definitely better. I didn't cook the beef until the juices evaporated, because last time it turned out hard and dry. I added a bit of onion powder and just a dash of ginger. Aside from overcooking the beef the first time around, this recipe is wonderful! I'll be making this again for sure!

I have to admit, I wasn't really sure what to expect w/tomato soup in this recipe.  I pleased to announce, it works; it really works!  I did choose to marinate my beef strips in some soy sauce, white vinegar, lemon juice, and garlic all day while I was at work.  I also added a splash of sesame oil to my canola oil to cook the beef.  To make this even easier, I used Uncle Ben's microwavable pouch brown rice (90 seconds!).  What a great weeknight meal; this will be used again at the LTH house.  DISCLAIMER:  We don't typically eat Chinese foods "out", so I can't make any comparisons to your favorite local take out joint.

Really simple to make, and yummy. I have food allergies, so Chinese takeout is not an option. It fixed my Chinese food craving. I will say I liked it better the next day re-heated.

This is alright. Much too tomato-y 
I had to go back and cut it with some more soy sauce & vinegar & it was still tasting like I added veggies & rice to tomato soup.

I started cooking, then realized I didn't have tomato soup or broccoli! Instead I used a can of diced tomatoes, frozen green beans, and garlic paste instead of garlic powder.  It ended up being a different recipe, but the guidelines this provided were great. Great flavor from such simple ingredients.

good basic recipe.. with a few changes can be great. I made mine with 1 lb top round steak cut thinly. Mix 2 tbsp cornstarch with 2 tbsp water and 1tsp garlic powder and mix. coat beef before cooking. Made with carrots, onion and broccoli stir fried separately with a little red pepper flake to taste. Sauce is made by mixing 1tsp cornstarch with 1tsp water and mix.. add 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1 tbsp brown sugar, 1  clove minced garlic and 1/2 tsp grated ginger.  After cooking vegetables to doneness, add beef back to pan and add sauce, stir and cook for an aditional minute or two to take the edge off the garlic. You may want to loosen the sauce with a little more soy..I also like a little more brown sugar in mine. Served hot over rice. YUM!

I must say after reading the reviews, I was skeptical, but I loved this! I did add 2 tsp. beef boullion as another reviewer suggested and it was tangy, and delicious! The amount of spice was perfect and with the addition of the boullion it wasn't overally tomatoey at all!!! Wonderful! Will make this often. Thank you!

I think I made this recipe before but forgot to write a review. Well, it is a complete success. I added some cilantro leaves for extra flavor and minced 2 cloves of garlic with the garlic presser. Needless to say the outcome was fabulous! I omitted the pepper flakes to avoid intolerance but as an overall it was very good! By the way, I let the beef sirloin to slowly simmer for about an hour to get the beef very tender (I hate chewy meat) and added the broccoli when it was done and let it simmer for 5 minutes to avoid overcooking the broccoli.

I absolutely love this recipe. I've been making it for a while but figured I'd chip in my experience with making this. First of all.....double the sauce recipe. Second of all.....double the amount of garlic powder. Sometimes I add red pepper and onions which enhances the taste of the sauce...but it's not necessary it tastes great without doing that too. It's quick to make, but I'd recommend using fresh broccoli if you can, it just tastes better than frozen.

This was surprisingly good. Few modifications. Added about 1 more tablespoon of soy and garlic, and about a tablespoon of brown sugar. I used stir fry Veges instead of just brocolli. I also used rice vinegar instead of regular. My family really enjoyed it, this will definitely be a repeat.

I was leery of making broccoli beef using tomato soup but this recipe was great! I did add a lot more crushed red pepper than the recipe called for which I feel helped mellow out the tomato flavor. I'll probably make this recipe twice a month!

Hi I have just made this meal, I left out the red pepper, but because I found the tomato soup was strong I put couple of dollops of  H.P sauce, some mild chilli power, some black pepper and some gravy powder.
Also put in green beans and  asparagus, I loved it, I made loads so got some left for dinner tomorrow

I've made this twice now. The first time I followed the directions exactly as written. We liked it but it was pretty tomatoey. I made it again last night using suggestions on here to double everything but the tomato soup. We loved it! I'm giving 4 stars for the first review. We are definitely keeping this in our menu.

Great recipe.  I followed the recipe for the most part but I used fresh garlic and minced it and I also used the garlic powder.  Since I have a larger family I had to increase the serving size.  I only had one can of tomato soup so with one can was just fine for 2lbs of beef.  I also added some garlic and 2 tsp of sugar just to kill some of the acids from the tomato soup.  Was delicious as can be and very easy to make oh one more thing I added carrots too.

What a quick and easy dinner! Don't let the tomato fool you! I took the advise of fellow cooks and although I doubled ALL ingredients to feed my teenagers I still only used 1 can of the soup.  It came out PERFECT.  Prior to putting the meet in the pan I let the oil heat up and slice up some onions.  I also left out the pepper flakes.  I made white rice and used frozen broccoli adding it LAST after the meat and spices had cooked thoroughly.  My kids LOVED it!! Doubling leaves enough for lunch leftovers and the kids really like the veggies and meat.  I will be using this again.

VERY easy. For the amount of time and effort required, this recipe is fantastic. That being said, I found it a little heavy on the tomato flavor. I would probably cut the soup to 1/2 of a can and add more soy sauce. But like I said, for a recipe that takes about five minutes and has minimal ingredients, it's great.

Easy and tasty.  Followed the recipe and the skillet is empty indicating a meal enjoyed by kids and adults.  Used frozen broccoli. Fresh would have been even better but hey, didn't have fresh so frozen worked just fine.  I cooked the frozen broccoli first but next time I'll just throw it in as it was a little mushy.  Adding this to my "tried and true" folder.

I made little changes! Added Worcestershire sauce, pepper and onions - deliciously good.  Will make this as my regular dinner menu.

This was ok. It was very bland. I took others advice and added garlic, onion, ginger and other seasonings as well as doubled the soy sauce but it was still very blah. It wasn't until I added teriyaki sauce that it finally got some flavoring to it.

Excellent flavor! I added some green onions and bell pepper to make it stretch a little farther. I could taste the tomato soup a little, but it was not overpowering. Putting this recipe into the rotation! Thanks!

This recipe was great! So flavorful and so easy. I added some onion while frying the beef. I also added some carrots and red pepper with the broccoli. Served the leftovers the next day with egg noodles and that was great too, almost better than the rice.

Tried the recipe as is and it was very bland for my husband and me.  Therefore, we added more soy sauce, garlic, and pepper flakes to taste and also added ginger based on others reviews.  After adding these changes it was better but I still don't think I'd make it again.  Will look for other beef and broccoli recipes.

Tried this recipe last night...first time making something like this, so I was a bit nervous.  Overall, very easy to make (and quick).  I used cube steak.  The sauce was a bit redder than I would have liked (color), but that's OK - it tasted great.  Ours was a bit spicy as I used cayenne pepper, but very good.  Will be making this one again.  :)

Great recipe.  My picky husband usually turns his nose up at canned soup recipes.  But he went back for seconds with this recipe.  It's a keeper.

I made this recipe according to the instructions and only substituted the soy sauce with coconut aminos and it turned out fantastic. I'm on a low sugar, low sodium, low fat diet and this was my one red meat meal for the week; it was well worth it!!

i have no idea what taste this recipe was aiming for but it failed to make it.   you have a can of condensed soup and NO liquid added.   the tomato taste was completely overwhelming.   in order to salvage dinner i added water and beef broth concentrate to cut the tomato.

Delicious! I used Chinese 5 spice as well (jar form) and it really enhanced the flavors.  I feel the flavors did not meld together well and I am going to try the whole recipe in a wok next time. Or maybe just add everything to the boiling beef. Either way this is a great recipe!

Hubby swears he doesn't eat chinese inspired food...funny thing is...he requests this at least twice a month!   I only put two tbs of soy, and sprinkle in some ground ginger...also use red wine vinegar.  Its so easy, and super filling!

Used beef stew meat because that was what was on hand.  Marinated meat in soy sauce overnight.  Cut pieces lengthwise for flatter and less chunky pieces.  Use recipe as is but add a little Kitchen bouquet to darken the sauce.  It was delicious and probably would be even better with the better cuts of meat.

Wonderful! I made this for supper last night and followed the suggestions of a few reviewers: I added a cube of beef bullion and increased the red pepper to 1 tsp. I should have made some rice to go with it -- I was just trying to put this together really quick -- because there is a lot of sauce (which I am totally cool with, but not the bf!). Will definitely be making again and the bf agrees (but with rice!). :)

Quick and easy. Great flavor. The only the I did different was used half a can of soup and a little bit of water after adding broccoli.

I thought this recipe seemed really easy to make, the ingredients are simple compared to some of the beef/broccoli recipes on here. I read all the other reviews and based on that, I nearly halved the amount of condensed tomato soup in my recipe. I found that a whole can would be a little much/slightly Americanized, but start with half a can and work your way up, keep tasting to see what you prefer! Aside from that, I also added chopped onions in the beginning with the meat, and used chili paste in place of crushed red pepper, because i love spicy. I used some hoisin sauce because I had some on hand, but reduced the amount of soy sauce due to my usage of the hoisin.  All in all, my guy was impressed and we both ate everything on our plates... No leftovers this time! :)
