This was just "okay". I've made butter cookies before minus the cream cheese, and they've come out just as good.  These weren't sweet at all, but we used a type of royal icing to decorate, and with that they still came out just "okay".  Also, I refrigerated the dough for almost 2 hours, and when it came time to rolling, the dough became soft and sticky almost immediately, so we had to keep adding flour to the rolling pin and pastry board.

All in all, I think I'll try a different butter cookie recipe next time.

Simple, quick and easy... these cookies were delicious!  I topped them with a lemon flavored powdered sugar icing, and they were a hit.  Very nice, light flavor.  Definitely will make again and again!

I loved the flavor but I had trouble with the dough, a little too sticky.  Also, when they came out of the oven they were okay, but later became very hard.

We loved this cookie recipe! It was great!  I added a pinch of salt to enhance the flavors and put a powder sugar/orange juice icing on top.

These were good little cookies, not a lot of flavor so they went well with the Sugar Cookie Frosting from this site.  I didn't have any cookie cutters, so I rolled the cookie dough into a log, froze for an hour or two and sliced into 1/4 inch rounds before I baked them.

Melts in your mouth!  Make sure to use REAL BUTTER or you'll be disappointed.  Very easy dough to work with.

These were fine, nothing special.  A decent cream cheese sugar cookie.  I followed exactly according to recipe.
