I made this recipe as weekly meal prep - it tastes really good! I recommend soaking the rice noodles in warm water for 15 minutes and then adding them directly into the chicken and chipotle mix so the noodles have some of the flavor. Adding noodles into the chicken mix to cook is also a great solution if your spice mix ended up too spicy.

This is a keeper!  The sauce was thick enough to stick to the noodles without the arrowroot.  Also, I used chicken breasts instead of thighs.

I can’t stop thinking about this dish. I wish there had been leftovers. The flavors were incredible! My three teenagers with all different tastes absolutely loved it. Thank you for the recipe.

This was excellent!  I didn’t have any adobos, so I used powdered chipotle and smoked paprika.  Also used a whole onion.  Will make again!

Hubs said it was one of my best dishes! I used low sodium soy sauce and didn't need the arrowroot to thicken. Very good!

The only changes I made were to use low sodium soy sauce, and I used brown rice spaghetti noodles because my store did not have flat rice noodles.  Let me just say that this was unbelievably delicious.  When I read the recipe it sounded good, but I was curious about the blend of flavors soy sauce and rice vinegar.  It turned out to be an amazing combination.  I also loved the simple fact that it is a one pot (ok, two because of the noodles) meal.  It was easy to make and easy to clean up. This is a keeper.

my husband really liked it.  I didn't have to thicken it. There was enough sauce so I added some chicken stock.  used bone-in then cut the meat from the bone.

Great and super easy! We had to substitute arrowroot with tapioca to thicken which work out good. The whole family, including the kids, loved it.
