My family loved this recipe!!!!!! I made a few alterations, though:  I used 1/2 lb. ground turkey, 1/2 lb. pork saugsage, I added a touch of grated cheese, and 1 can of stewed tomatoes.  My total cooking time took 90 minutes  to reach 180 degrees required for poultry---worth the wait!

This was amazing! My whole family loved it!  I did leave out the potatoes because of some other reviews. But I made mashed potatoes on teh stove to go with it and it was great!  This one is a keeper!  Thanks for the recipe!

We made this with ground turkey and we really liked it. It was moist and flavorful for a loaf. The roasted veggies added a lot. Instead of roasting all the onion we chopped up half and put it in the loaf mix to spice it up. It was good I might add it to my repetoire.

This was a very nice meal!! Not so pretty in the presentation department but really really tasty! My son really enjoyed the meatloaf. It was my first time cooking zucchini and he was NOT a fan of that but personally I loved it. The salt & pepper and tomato sauce were just a nice light touch of flavor to complement the yummy potatoes and veggie mix. I would cut the onion and peppers in larger chunks next time they sort of got lost since I diced them in smallish pieces. The roasted potatoes were my favorite part - perfectly cooked and many had a nice crust on them. I pre-diced my onions pepper and tomato the night before and it was super easy to throw that in the roasting pan in the oven and while that was cooking for its first 20 minutes I was able to dice the zucchini and prep the meatloaf so it was quick and easy for dinner prep on a work night.

So delicious! I never liked meatloaf before but figured I'd give it a try because my hubby likes it. I made a few changes and it was the tastiest thing ever! I used 2 green bell peppers and no red. I thinly sliced half the onion to cook with the veggies and chopped the other half into tiny pieces and put it in the meatloaf with the parsley. A little extra garlic never hurts! Instead of tomato sauce I used a 6oz. can of tomato paste and 2 cans of water. I will admit it was a little dry for my taste a little extra sauce never hurts either! Italian bread crumbs are fine if you don't have regular but I think Italian adds a little more flavor. What really made it yummy was the cheese I added. Seperate the meatloaf into 2 parts. Shape the bigger half into a loaf and add slices of cheese on top of it. Any cheese any amount is fine. I used 3 slices of provolone and it was great! Next time I'll use a few more slices. After the cheese is added shape the remaining meat mixture over top and cook! You can use whatever kind of veggies you like I'm sure all would be delicious! Just remember that if you use zucchini or squash to put it in at the same time you put the meatloaf in so that it doesn't get to mushy! Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe Jennifer. Fast and easy to make. The only thing I'd reccommend is possibly using less potatoes and making sure to slice them ultra thin so that they cook in the amount of time needed for the meat. The only thing I changed was slightly extending the cooking time (it helped the loaf stay together more) and adding about a half a cup of ketchup to the 8oz tomato sauce. Otherwise a definite treat! I will surely make it again! =)

My husband and I loved it! Even my 3 year old daughter. My two sons didn't give it a chance though. If they had actually taken a bite I believe they would have enjoyed it. Maybe next time for them but the more they don't eat the more for us!!

Very good! Nice to have a whole meal that is not a casserole too. The potatoes were a little underdone and the onions were a bit too thin so I think next time I will use my mandoline slicer set on 3/16" for everything.

This is a hearty and good recipe. I added cheese to the meatloaf and used spaghetti sauce because I was out of plain tomato sauce. The meatloaf tastes great in sandwiches too.

My Husband Loved This and he doesn't usually care for meat loaf. I thought that it was okay. The Veggies were a good addition but I think that it would have been better without the potatoes. I will probablly make this again for my husband.

This meatloaf is quite tasty by itself and the veggies make a meal out of it. This recipe would make a absolutly scrumptious cassarole if you did not loaf the meat and rather broke it appart with the veggies and tomato sauce. I will certainly try it like that next time.

The meatloaf was delicious! I also added some of the onions to the meatloaf as well as some grated cheese. It was a big hit! However the potatoes were not cooked enough for my liking. I think next time I will cook the veggies at 400 for 30-45 minutes so that the potatoes are almost cooked before adding the meatloaf.

We added salt and pepper and other seasonings to the vegetables and still they turned out flavorless. The meatloaf was too dry.

Made it according to the recipe but for extending the potatoes veggies cooking time by 10 minutes. The texture came out fine but the flavor was very blah. The recipe is a good base but definitely needs additional spacing.
