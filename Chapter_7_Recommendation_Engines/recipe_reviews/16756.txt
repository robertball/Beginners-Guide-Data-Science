I made this pizza for my wife to take to work for a going away party.  The only change I made was I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo.  It gives it a little more flavor and less oily texture.  It turned out great. Love it

This recipe is AWESOME!  After making it several times, I thought I should share how wonderful it is.  I make it for every potluck and my co-workers LOVE it.  Every time I make it people rant and rave, and I am now known for this pizza.  I will say that I do adjust the ingredients... To fit a 9x13 pan, I only use one package of crescent rolls, 1 package of cream cheese, 1/2 C. of mayonnaise, and 1/2 package of the dry ranch. It is still one of the best recipes I have found, thanks Jan!!

This is always popular at parties and potlucks. I use less mayonnaise though. Just enough to make the cream cheese easy to spread. You can also substitute sour cream for the mayonnaise.

There should be a 10 star rating available for this recipe! This is much better than use the store-bought dill dip over pita bread veggie pizzas!! This recipe can EASILY be halved (I know, I've made it once per week for the last 2 weeks). I added 1 tsp of dill weed (considering I halved the recipe) and I don't use tomatoes as it tends to get soggy as it sits.  I have also found that the finely shredded cheese works much better for slicing and serving.  I could almost eat the whole thing myself! VERY GOOD and I plan to bring it to most parties I attend in the upcoming weeks as it is soooo easy to make...esspecially if you have a food processor for the veggies!

Good, easy-to-make recipe!  I used refrigerated pizza dough instead of crescent dough, it doesn't need to be rolled, just pressed into the pan.  I followed the suggestions and used 1 package of cream cheese and 1/2 packet of the ranch dressing.  I used lower-fat mayo, though I think the mayo could probably be halved too.  I used a 15 x 10 pan and there was plenty of sauce.  Mine was going to sit in the fridge for awhile and I was afraid of sogginess from the tomato, so i used chopped red pepper instead so I could still get the red color in there!

AWESOME recipe...I've made it in years past but lost the recipe.  Thank goodness for allrecipes.com!  Tip: mix the mayo and ranch mix BEFORE adding in the cream cheese.  Also added red bell peppers - very yummy and pretty. Every time I make this recipe I get raves!

This is an excellent recipe, but it took a LOT longer to make than I was prepared for.  We were taking to a lunch party and I started at 10:00 a.m.  First mistake was I baked the cresent rolls on a stone and it took FOREVER to cool...you can't put the cream cheese mixture on warm cresent rolls or else it melts!  Second, I didn't allow enough time for washing and cutting up all the vegetables.  It was a hit by the time we made it to the party and held up very well just sitting out.  Very good!

Instead of cutting this AFTER you have put the cream cheese mixture and veggies on it, cut it BEFORE you put anything on it.  That way, if you serve it in the pan, it isn't messed up when you cut it.  If you serve it in something else, it is still much easier to get out of the pan.  I use a pizza cutter to cut the crust.

I made this for a get together and was tempted to eat it all myself...very yummy! I used one package of crescent rolls and shaped it into a 12 in. round pizza, and thus halved most of the ingredients (1 package of cream cheese, and a little less than a half of mayo, half the package of ranch seasoning - the proportions were perfect). very pretty with a good variety of veggies too!

This is a quick and easy recipe.  FOR A HEALTHY alternative, use pita bread as a mini- pizza crust.  You can also use reduced fat or fat free cream cheese and mayo to save calories.  Personally, I dont like raw peppers, my veggies of choice: brocolli, cauliflower, green onion, and sliced baby carrots. Also, I recommend Hidden Valley Ranch packets... I tried McCormick, and was VERY disappointed.

I'm going against the majority with this one, but I thought this was just ok.  I followed the recipe, minus the carrots but didn't find this to be anything great.  I liked this better at room temp rather than cold.  Like another reviewer, I added some dill to the ranch mixture and cut the recipe in half. I did however like the cream cheese/ranch mixture.  I think it would be good just a dip. Don't think I'll make this again unless I get a request for it, but I'm glad I tried it.  Thanks Jan.

Hi Everyone! Try this..Instead old "plain cream cheese", use Philly chive and onion cream cheese, mixed with sour cream instead of mayo...add some garlic powder! Yum! All my friends "can't figure out why my veggie pizza has better flavor "than theirs!" You won't need ranch dip this way.I also use "fat free if a store carries it.Stay away from tomatoes, unless you "just use the outer tomatoe(no juices) I've used dill dip on top also, then put veggies over it! Be sure to add "green onions if you want to give it an "extra kick". Even if you "just use the greens".

Love love! Been making for years!  I use a large cookie sheet (jelly roll pan) and it makes well over 12 servings.  The only veggies I use are broccoli, cauliflower, and shredded carrots. EVERYONE raves about these!

Here's a tip to get your veggies and cheese to stay put:  Put a sheet of plastic wrap over the top and smoosh the veggies into the cream cheese mixture before putting in the fridge to set/chill.

12 Single Servings!!  YUMMM for One!
I absolutely LOVE veggie pizza, but I have found, as I am sure most of you have, that veggie pizza doesnt last for more than a day (the crust gets mushie).  Soooo for those of you who LOVE veggie pizza as I do, try this on for size, or a single serving snack!  I make the crescent rolls as instructed however I DO NOT spread the cream cheese/mayo/ranch mixture on them, I don't even top them at all!  Instead I cut the crescent crust (untopped) into 12 sections.  I then place those sections into a large ziplock baggie.  I then put my Cream cheese/mayo/ranch mixture into a plastic container. I am sure you guessed it, I then put all the toppings in seperate baggies.  When I want a slice of veggie pizza, I take out a peice of crust, spread the cream cheese/mayo/ranch mixture on it, sprinkle some cheese, and add my veggies and enjoy with OUT ever having to share something so good that goes so fast at parties.  I have also found out that I actually use LESS of the cream cheese mixture and less cheese, making this favorite recipe even healthier for you!  I even prepare 2-3 slices in the morning, the wrap them in plastic wrap and take them to work for lunch.  Boy are my co-workers jealous!  YUMMY!

I would also like to thank you for sharing this recipe on Allrecipes.com, I too WAS one of thoe people who would tear her hair out when it came time to make this recipe, I could never find it (I was never 100% sure the ratio of cream cheese to mayo, the re

I've made this recipe for my family Christmas party and everyone loved it!  Some suggestions...1) grab veggies from a salad bar, much cheaper and they're already cut up...2) line pan with reynolds wrap, ensures dough won't stick...3) cut into squares using pizza cutter, PRIOR TO ADDING veggies and cheese, much easier to cut that way. Also, I like to use add an extra package of cream cheese, makes it a little creamier.

I make this for every party or gathering we have, it is AMAZING.  Everyone loves it, and there is never any left over :(  Sometimes I make two just so I'll have some left for the next day!  Some tips: The cream cheese has to be very soft so it will mix smoothly with the mayo, you can microwave it for about 20-30 sec if needed.  I put the shredded cheese on first, then top with cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, diced peeled cucumbers (seeds removed), and quartered grape or cherry tomatoes (seeded).  Sometimes I also add a sprinkle of real bacon bits as well :)  For the broccoli and cauliflower, I like to blanch it first (or lightly steam) not to cook it but to brighten the color and make it a little easier to bite into. (Make sure to do an ice bath to stop the cooking, and then make sure it's mostly dry so it doesn't make the pizza soggy) It takes more time, but I think it's worth it.  It's delicious either way, but I think food tastes better when it looks pretty!

I absolutely adore this recipe! I half this recipe and make it up on the weekend and will take it for lunch during the week. It is so easy and yummy! Also great on weight watchers. I do half this recipe, in 6 servings, and it is only 3pts each (using fat free everything of course) Love it!

This was a hit at a recent cookout. I only used one package of reduced fat crescent rolls and I also halved the cream cheese, mayonnaise and dressing mix and used low fat cream cheese and light mayonnaise which didn't affect the taste at all. I also only used 1/2 cup of the shredded cheese and then piled it with carrots, red pepper, broccoli and cauliflower. It looked absolutely gorgeous and tasted delicious. With all of the changes I made, it reduced the calories quite a bit too. I will definitely make this again!

This is a great recipe....I did make a few changes though. I decided to go with a pre-made pizza crust to save time, and it tasted great. I also added some dill weed and garlic powder into the cream cheese mix. Next time, I will reduce the amount of mayo to reduce the fat because the flavor is great with just the cream cheese (I like 1/3 less fat cream cheese...it tastes pretty much the same as regular.) Also, I find this pizza is best if you find 3 or four veggies that you have on hand and just use those. If you have to many vegetables, it can be messy and fall apart while you're eating.

My whole family loves this (even the kiddos)!  I used just 1 fat free cream cheese-its only 30 calories per serving, obviously none from fat, tastes the same to me.  No one even noticed.  Also, I used 1/4 c. mayo (made with olive oil for half the calories) and 1/4 c. greek yogurt.  We always use greek yogurt in place of sour cream.  Love it!  Zero fat, lots of protein, no guilt. Then just half the pkg. of ranch, spreads on a little thinner, but who needs that much gunk?  If you need more spread, just dont half the recipe, but you can still use all the healthier ingredients! Yum!

Since I'm a organic fan, I used 1 cup of Hidden Valley Organic Ranch Dressing (no MSG) instead of mixing Mayo and dressing mix. I also used Pillsbury refrigerated pizza crust- GREAT results!

Have made this for years and a party favorite.  Hint:  I place the dressing on the pizza and top it with cheddar cheese/ or other shredded cheeses,  then layer the vegetables on the top. It is not so sloppy when serving and adds calcium.  Also I lay the crescent dough on the sheet and do not roll it and it is much flakier.

I have made this before but I needed to be refreshed. Just a hint if you are pressed for time--try using the chive flavored cream cheese. Tastes the same.
Thanks!!

I like my dip topping better, one package of cream cheese, 1/2 cup miracle whip, 1 teaspoon dill weed and 1/2 teaspoon onion salt.  Also, try leaving off the cheese and adding chopped green onion.  I've never left a lunch/dinner party without at least one person asking me for my veggie pizza recipe.  HINT: seed the tomatoes before chopping and you won't have to worry about sogginess.

Great recipe. I used miracle whip vs. mayonnaise & crescent rolls that weren't perforated. I may add garlic and dill weed for extra flavor the next time. I recommend using sharp cheddar vs. mild cheddar. I mixed the miracle whip, cream cheese and hidden valley ranch dressing mix the night before and refrigerated it so the flavors could blend. Also 7 minutes was PLENTY of time to cook the roll (the recommended 12 minutes listed in the recipe yielded me burnt buns, lol). The dish was a hit & I'll be making it again soon!

Really good. Easy to make and makes a lot of servings. I substitute sour cream for the mayo since we hate mayo and add green onions. Don't bother with the tomatoes and use big and flaky cresents so the crust holds up with all those veggies

Was very good.  Took it to a super-bowl game and it was devoured.  I mistakenly opened a roll of garlic-butter flavored crescent rolls and they made for an even tastier crust.

Delicious! I used two 9" round pans, only one cream cheese (1/3 fat kind), 1/2 cup of low fat sour cream and 1/2 the seasoning packet. Turned out to be exactly the right amount to spread over crusts. THANKS!

The Pros: A great variety of veggies. Loved that. First time trying crescent rolls, liked that as well.

The Cons: Only one, but I consider to be very important and the reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 4, the dry ranch mixture completely overpowered the flavor of the cream cheese.It made it impossible to eat.

I find it odd, because I don't see any mention of that in any other review, but I followed the recipie exactly as it is written. I didn't skimp on the veggies and I used two packages of cream cheese and 1oz package of dry ranch mix, and despite following the reciepie exactly as it is written, after about the second piece of pizza, I couldn't eat anymore. I normally like Ranch on my pizza's but next time, I may only use half the package or none at all. My advice would be to add the dry ranch sparingly and taste it as you add more, to make sure it doesn't become overbearing before spreading it over the bread.

Other than that, I would make this again. I am trying to find ways for my family to eat more veggies. I have a two year old son who hates veggies, but I chopped everything up in small fine pieces, and to my excitement, he ate most of the veggies. It was great! He loves pizza, so this was a great healthy substitute.

I dislike the sauce that's spread on the pizza. There's something about it that doesn't mesh well with my tastebuds. I did find some shortcuts for this dish that reduce the preparation time, and it also improves the flavor. 

Instead of cream cheese, dry ranch dip mix, and mayonnaise, purchase premade vegetable ranch dip and spread that over the crescent rolls. Instead of crescent rolls, which you have to spread out and try to cover the surface as well as stick together, you can purchase pizza dough (Pillsbury makes them and they're on the same shelves as the crescent rolls). This will make it a LOT easier to spread out, and it bakes evenly without lumps. 

Enjoy!

Very good. Made exactly like the recipe. One thing I did not like is that the crust turns soft/soggy after a while - definitely over night. Would make again if it will be eaten right away.

I got rave reviews from my guests at my bunco party!  It was easy to put together.  I used "big and buttery" crescent rolls instead of regular.  I've made and eaten plenty of different veggie pizzas and I have to say I LOVE this recipe!!

Amazing, big hit at all our parties.  I usually don't end up using all of the cream cheese mix, I find it tastes better if it is lightly spread across the crescent rolls.

This was very good. I think next time I'll use 1/2 to 3/4 of the packet of Ranch. It's a little salty with the whole packet, but everyone at work loves it. I left out the bell pepper and tomatoes.

I really liked the idea of this recipe, but it didn't quite turn out how I'd hoped.  I followed the directions exactly as written, but I thought there was way too much of the cream cheese/dip mixture.  If I make it again I will probably only use one package of cream cheese.  Secondly, as an admitted veggie lover I was excited that I could use 5 cups of fresh veggies, however I found this again to be a tad too much as well - it was hard to take a bite of this without the veggies toppling over onto your plate.  Next time I make this I will reduce the cream cheese and probably only use about 4 cups of veggies.

Tasty!  Note, do not do as I did the first time and use "low fat" and "no fat" items.  It really subtracted from the taste.  The second time, I went all out with the "full fat" items, and it tasted SO much better.  Hey, it's still healthy-ish ;)

This is a FABULOSU recipe!!  I make this for every get-together, and it disappears instantly.  A few minor changes that I make:  I only use one brick of cream cheese instead of two. As for the ranch dressing mix, I find that Hidden Valley Ranch is the best.  I omit the cauliflower and tomatoes (personal preference) and add minced green onion. I don't know if the pan used makes a difference, but I always bake the crust on a cookie sheet.  This is a refreshing appetizer- thanks for sharing it, Jan!

I have used this recipe for years. It is loved at every party even if someone else makes it!  To save time I buy my vegetables from the salad bar at the grocery store.  It doesn't take much to cover the pizza and I don't keep these vegetables readily available at home.  I use only broccoli, grated carrots and cauliflower. I still grate my own cheese though because that is cheaper and I put a lot of cheese on.

I make this for work and home parties.  I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo. It gives it a little more flavor. I also use low fat cream cheese It is always a big hit.

Pretty good, but overall I think that the vegetable pizzas always call for too much of the cream cheese spread and it overshadows the flavor of the vegetables instead of complementing them.  Put less spread on and this will taste just right.

This is a go to for me at office parties when everyone else signs up to bring in the desserts. It usually goes pretty fast, and it's easier to eat vegetables this way then trying to spoon some ranch on your paper plate and grabing some carrot sticks. It's also probably less healthy, but who are you trying to kid, no one eats eathing at those things! That being said, I use reduced fat crescent rolls, fat free mayo, and fat free cream cheese when I make these to soften the blow on the calorie front. I haven't had any complaints from the coworkers for switching to the low fat option. I also use red bell pepper instead of tomato. I always make these on cookie sheets, though I think the ones I use are bigger than the 9x13 suggested here. Basic, easy, yummy receipe for your next office party or baby shower.

One of our favorite appetizers! I love that you can add any veggies that you like...I always use broccoli, mushrooms, tomatoes, green peppers and black olives (along w/ the cheddar cheese), but the possibilities are endless! :)

I chop the veges together and mix it with the cream chesse.  Then I top with the shredded cheese and tomatoes.  I have also made it with the Fiesta RAnch dip and I think it adds a bit more flavor.  I usually use pillsbury thin crust pizza dough - it holds its form a bit better.  The other thing I do to save time is I buy the small bag of broccoli/caul/carrot mixture in the refrig section of the grocery store.  It makes it easier to dump it all in my chopper and in 5 minutes my veges are ready.  If I have bell pepper, I add it, but if I don't it still tastes great!  Red onion added is also good - don't need a lot though.

I used to eat this all the time when I was a little girl.  My aunt made it.  I have been looking all over for a recipe to know exactly what to mix with the cream cheese, and this is the only place I could find it.  Sooooo good!!!! Thanks for posting it!

This recipe is so delicious, but I also changed things up a bit.  I recommend cutting the vegetable pieces very small and using about a 1/2 cup of each vegetable.  I used 2 packages of Crescent rolls but cut the mayo and Ranch seasoning roughly in half. I go by taste most of the time and add ingredients gradually.  I used one 8 oz container of cream cheese with chive and onion and a few spoonfuls of sour cream.  I liked the idea of layering the cheese first and also added a few thinly slice radishes and used heirloom tomatoes.  These tomatoes are so good.  Again, just sprinkled all of the vegetables over gradually in very thin layers to prevent one flavor dominating and to make eating less messy.  This dish is really delicious and beautiful, especially with the colorful tomatoes.

This is my absolute favorite appetizer dish. YUM. This pizza really doesn't need the extra cheddar cheese on top. It's good just the way it is. I also don't use the peppers... I think their flavor is too strong and takes away from the rest of the veggies.

I have had this before at school functions and fell in love with this.  I use low fat cream cheese and low fat crescent rolls, and many kinds of vegetables on top.  My husband (who does not like broccoli and cauliflower) ate many servings of this.

Great snack or appitizer. Even kids who will not eat veggie will eat this! i always cut the recipe in half and still have some of the cream cheese mixture left over, but it really does make good veggie dip.

I just made this pizza after having something similar at a cousin's over the holidays.  I really loved the one I had and was looking for a similar recipe.  Unfortunately, this is not it!  I didn't follow the recipe exactly as I only used finely chopped broccoli and shredded carrots as a topping.  No other vegetables and no cheese.  The rest I made according to the recipe.  The main problem with this was the cream cheese sauce mix.  Way too much mayo and ranch dressing mix!  Really unpleasant taste!  Also, this recipe makes about twice as much sauce as you will need.  I would suggest halving it.  I may try this again using half the amount of mayo (subbing sour cream for the other half) and maybe half the amount of ranch dressing mix.  As is, this just does not work for me.

It was good, but I thought the cream mixture was a little too intense.  Next time, I will cut the mayo and ranch mix a bit.  I agree with the previous poster that it took a lot longer to prepare than I expected.  Oh, I also added chopped bacon.

I've made this several times for parties, and it is always a hit.  It's easy to vary the vegetables according to your tastes, and it's a timesaver in that you can make it a day ahead.  Even my kids will eat their veggies when I make this dish.  Fat free cream cheese and reduced fat crescent rolls work well in this recipe.  I've also substituted fat free sour cream for the mayo with great results.

This is the best Vegetable Pizza recipe out there.  I make it for every pot luck I attend and get rave reviews.  I do suggest a few changes.  I prefer a thinner crust so I make this on a 11x17 cookie sheet.  I do not put tomatoes because it makes it soggy and I do add a few onions for flavor.  It's a hit every time!

My gut feeling told me not to use mayo in this recipe.  I should have listened. The mayo flavor overpowers the cream cheese and the vegetables. It tastes like mayo pizza. I made it a 2nd time with sour cream in place of mayo and it was great.

WONDERFULL!!
I made this for the adults at my sons birthday party, it was a hit.  My husband loved it and so did my 2 year old daughter.  Will be making this again for a christmas pary.  Did do a few things different 1) used a larger pan 2)didn't use all of the cream cheese mixture 3)used a yellow bell pepper instead of green 4)added a bunch of green onion.  Superb!

Made for a baby shower, it was gone in a matter of minutes.  I didn't use as many veggies.  I used 1 cup. tomatoes, 1/2 cup carrots, 1 cup broc. I think if I used as much as suggested the veggies would just fall off while slicing into squares.

I have used this recipe often for at least 10-15 years.  It is the best!!  I live in England (for the moment) and everyone I've served it to here absolutely raves about it as well.  It is my favorite appetizer but works well as a lunch item as well.  Crust gets soft if left overnight but we've only had leftovers once and that was because of a snowstorm in Colorado - our party guests couldn't get to our house.

Very good and stores well in refridgerator (though it loses its crispness.)  Makes an excellent summertime lunch.  I used a food processor to chop the veggies so that they would be small and uniform (make sure that you don't chop them too much or you end up with mush.)  The food processor saves a lot of time as well.

Very, very good!!  I made this for a Home and Garden Party and everyone loved it!!  I used pillsbury butter flavored crescent rolls, Hellmans regular mayonnaise, and Hidden Valley Ranch seasoning. I made it in a jelly roll pan. I topped it with brocolli, cauliflower, carrots, and cheddar cheese.  Was really, really good, will definately make this again!!  Thanks, Jan!!

Always a hit, and way better than a vege tray.  I never thought to add the ranch dressing mix.  I threw the veges in my food chopper, gave em' a few pulses and bingo, it literally took minutes to prepare.  I skipped the tomatoes, and added sliced black olives.  Thanks for the recipe Jan!

I make this fairly often, and it’s always a hit. I substituted 0% fat greek yogurt for half the mayonnaise, used the reduced fat crescent roll dough, and will probably sub yogurt for the whole amount of mayo next time I make it, just to make this a bit more healthy.

I have made this several times and it's been a hit at every party! I find broccoli, cauliflower and carrot is sufficient...less is more!

I love this recipe. I have made it several times.  My family only likes broccoli,  cauliflower, carrots, and green peppers, and shredded cheese.  I add a pinch of dill, not too much, adds a kick of flavor.  Personal tip: Cut the pizza after putting on spread, before adding vegetables and cheese.  Keeps pizza looking pretty and easier.

I loved this recipe. I tried sour cream instead of mayo and liked it better that way. I also used 1 1/2 cans of crescent roll instead of 2 which made it a little less doughy. I will make it again

This is my favorite veggie pizza recipe.  I like the two packages of crescent rolls and cream cheese.  I bake mine in a 10x15 jelly roll pan.  I set out my cream cheese so it is room temperature and mix it with the mayo in my mixer, I add a teaspoon of dill. I sometimes change up the veggies on top.  I have made this for family gatherings, graduation parties, and made 4 of them for my in-laws 70th Anniversary party.  Everyone loves it!

This recipe was a hit! I was unable to fit two cans of crescent rolls in my 9x13 inch pan, so I halved the recipe. The first time I made this, it seemed terribly salty and the veggies kept falling off while my family was trying to eat it. The second time I made it, I mixed the mayonnaise, cream cheese and dressing mix together the night before and let the flavors blend in the refrigerator. The next day I baked the crust and assembled it. I also lightly pushed down on all the veggies and cheese before refrigerating the finished pizza to help everything "stick" to the crust. That did the trick because it held together well and tasted delicious! Even the kids, who are not veggie fans, loved this pizza!

Always a hit. I add a little sour cream to make it creamier. I also leave out the carrots and shredded cheese. Instead of tomatoes I do red bell peppers-still also include the green.

My Mom used to make this when I was younger and I still love it.  It is my go to recipe for potlucks and get togethers.  I use pizza crust and cut it first when cooled before topping.  Then I use 1/2 the cream cheese,  1/2 the mayo and 1/2 the ranch packet.  I top w/ shredded raw broccoli slaw (found in a bag in the produce aisle), shredded carrots, shredded cheddar cheese and any extra veggies on hand.  NUM, never any extras!

I made this pizza for my family who loved it. I had trouble with the amount of dough which was too much for a 9 x 13 pan so I decided to make two smaller ones in two sheet pans. I divided the amounts in half and it worked perfectly. In fact the kids loved it because each got there own individual pizza!

I make a version that is a little different, no Mayo I use like 6 ounces sour cream and instead of the ranch use chopped fresh dill and garlic powder and I use cucumbers, carrots brocoli and tomatos. This also also FANTASTIC the next day

I decided to make this recipe for a baby shower for a different way to serve veggies and dip and I loved it!! I had to take a little taste to try it out before serving and it was so good that I couldn't stop sneaking pieces. The guests were lucky there were any left for them. I will definitely be making this again.  I made it exactly per recipe (except I left out the peppers and tomatoes).

I took this to a potluck event and it was a huge hit.  Instead of the mayonnaise mixture, I used reduced-fat  chive-flavored whipped cream cheese.  Vegetable would also be a good flavor.  I also replaced the tomatoe with red pepper. Because I had no broccoli, I used spinach to add the green.

I really didn't change much when making this, it was great!  I just substituted cucumbers in place of tomatoes because I don't personally like them.  I also cut back to 1 package of cream cheese, because it made plenty of "sauce" with 1.  And I also didn't use the entire ranch packet.  I will make this again for sure...it's a keeper!

Use your own veggies w/ this mix and it's great.  Just the right amt of dip, too.  I used cauliflower, carrots, broccoli, red/yellow/green peppers and olives.  Looked great and got raves from the guests.

Everyone in my family loves this pizza. My mother-in-law request it at every family function. I do use sour cream instead of mayo and cucumbers instead of peppers. The only complaint I have is that it is messy to make.

Did not like the Ranch dressing. I prefer the less bold flavor of just some added dill.

This is a great recipe, I've made it many times.  It actually comes out of a Pampered Chef recipe book.  Enjoy it, you can change around the veggies on top to your taste!  Cucumbers are great on it!

This was excellent.  I lost my old recipe and this was exactly like what I remember it to be.  Thank you for this recipe.  The cream cheese under the vegetables has a perfect texture and you can use any vegetables that you wish to use.

This is a great recipe that I've had for a long time - it's frequently used for Pampered Chef parties - I love it - its so simple and such a great standby.  I've also seen variations that use yogurt and honey as the base for the "sauce" and use chopped fruits (peaches, raspberries) for the "toppings" - great for a breakfast potluck.

I wish I could give it 0 stars.  It was a gooey vegetable mess.  I was left salivating after reading the other reviews, but was sadly disappointed.  Maybe it was my fault?  I used fat free cream cheese & mayo -- but, honestly, raw veggies and that much cream cheese?  Recipe for disaster.

Just the one I was looking for!  I like this because you can use any combination of vegetables to suit your tastes.  I personally like to use cauliflaur, matchstick carrots, tomatoes, and diced cukes on mine.

I stupidly made this as a maindish for dinner one night, it was good but a little too much.
This will be awesome as an appetizer! Scrumptious!!
I made the cream cheese mixture in the morning and let it refridgerate all day. It made it easy that night to throw together.

This recipe was surprisingly tasty considering how simple it is. It even surprised my family who did not think a bunch of cut up vegis could taste sooo good on a flattened crecent roll. I did make some adjustments as was recommended-I only used one crecent roll can, and half the ranch mixture. I used the other half of the mixture for dipping the rest of the unused vegis.  This will definitely be maked more on a regular basis. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great recipe to fix to take to work or to take to a party.  It is easy to fix.  After you get the veggie's chopped, it's downhill from there.

This turned out good.  I did add fresh dill to the cream cheese mixture.  You really can play with this to make it your own  It was a hit at the super bowl party.  I would make again for bunko.

Nice to bring to potlucks because it’s convenient. Cut the crust with a pizza cutter before you put anything on it, makes it MUCH easier.

I made this for a picnic and it was gone in no time!  The only adjustment I made was using 2/3 of a packet of ranch seasoning with dill in it to make the dish less salty - which made a difference.

I love ranch but I don't care for it with the veggie pizza.  It just doesn't have enough flavor to go with the crescent rolls.  I prefer the recipe that has the dill.

I have had other versions of this and liked them, but unfortunately this one had way too much cream cheese and ranch for my tastes, I couldn't finish a piece. And looking at the nutritional info. it has 467 calories PER SERVING, and 38.8 grams of fat per serving. So, I would change it up a lot with using neufachtel and use less and only a sprinkle of ranch powder. And would not refrigerate it. But, as always, thanks for posting and giving us recipes to try!

I would not use two packages of cream cheese. It was WAY to much. Next time I will use one package of cream cheese.

I always love this  recipe.  I always like changing up the types of veggies though.  I seem to usually have leftover cream cheese mixture but found out when I mixed that with leftover chopped vegetables that it is excellent on bagels!

This was a big hit!  So yummy!  

I followed 90% of the recipe - my only changes were that I only added a little shredded cheese and I put it on top of the cream cheese mixture (under the veggies) so that it would stick and not fall off when eaten.  

I used red pepper instead of green, omitted the carrots and added green onions.   I used purple cauliflower and it was sooo pretty!

Oh - I recommend gutting/seeding the tomatoes so that they don't get your pizza soggy.   Also, I found that gently pushing the veggies down before cutting them made them stick to the bread so guests didn't lose their toppings.  

This was really great - I can't wait to try some more variations - thanks for the recipe! :)

I made this for our Fathers day cookout. I used sour cream instead of mayonnaise. It was great. Will make again, but I think I will follow the recipe and use mayo next time.

I accidentally bought Crescent crust instead of rolls.  I didn't know they had such a thing!  I think the crusts are larger than the rolls, so I made much more than I needed.  Always good, though!

Too much mayo and too much spread. Reduce spread by almost half and cut mayo in half. Maybe use sour cream instead of mayo?  Instead or ranch dressing maybe garlic and dill weed?

This appetizer has been at nearly every baby shower, wedding shower and wedding that I've attended over the last 30 years. Great, classic recipe that almost everyone loves. If you care about appearance, like I do, make sure to dice/chop the veggies all the same size. They should be very small and uniform. Another tip, make sure to mash the crescent roll dough so that it is even. Some people make this and have "fluffy" crust or uneven crust. You want the crust to be rather flat and uniform.

I made this in my or first or second year cooking class. I just fell in love with it. This was out of my years in that cooking class, this was my favorite recipe. I brought some home and my mom, dad and grandpa loved it!!! I made some last year and my Brother loved it even his 4 year old Daughter loved it. You don't get much young children that like veggies, this style of pizza really makes the veggies tolerable

I dice the vegetables very small, and add pieces of deli ham on the top.  Very delicious, won't last long at a potluck or dinner party.

I have used this recipe many times and its always a hit. I usually mix the grated cheddar in with the cream cheese mix, and use a food processor to chop the cauliflower finer, use broccoli cole slaw mix, diced green bell peppers. I press the vegies into the cream cheese when spreading them on the vegie bars. Be sure to refrigerate these once made for a couple of hours to set everything.

This pizza is requested at every potluck I attend!  It is easy to make and stores nicely!  No need to worry about it cooling down when sitting out like a traditional pizza.  This is also a great way to sneak in veggies!

This pizza can be done in so many ways , I tried it the way it stated the first time , then went on to make it again the way I enjoy it . Both are great , but adding salt and pepper , and feta cheese makes this so much better , and use romaine tomatoes . This makes a huge pizza ,and such a great party please for all the health nuts out there like me .

As my kids do not like big chunks of veggies, I limited the veggies to brocolli, cauliflower, green peppers and carrots.  I then put them into the food processor until finely blended.  It becomes a texture that you can sprinkle on top of the crust and "sauce".  Perfect!  I even took it to work and one lady said it was so good...she couldn't believe it had cauliflower in it becuase she claimed to hate it. Very easy way to get your kids to eat these veggies if normally they won't!

Enjoyed this quite a bit. I ended up substituting mayo with plain yogurt, and cut down the ranch mix to about 1/3 of what was recommended, otherwise it tended to overpower the veggies.

I made this for a potluck I attended and everyone raved about it!  It turned out delicious! I followed the recipe but my crust was done in about 10 minutes, and I used a little bit of red, orange and green peppers.  Was fantastic - I will definitely be making this one again, thanks for the great recipe :)

I tried making this as a fun, healthy lunch for my kids and me.  I halved the recipe, but I wish I had done as NICKI0824 suggested and made a 9 x 13 from one roll of crescent rolls and one block of cream cheese.  The cream cheese mixture was a little thick, but it was still delicious.  While not necessarily low calorie, this pizza is full of nutrients.  My toddlers gobbled it up, and so did I!

I was looking for a recipe I had tried at a potluck. This was not it. It was pretty good, but will probably keep looking.

My mom used to make this all the time.  It was always a hit at potlucks and family gatherings.  She used dry ranch most of the time but if she didn't have any she would just add the ranch dressing.  I still make this for my family today.  My sister called me last week to get the recipe.  It is delicious...even for my kids who hate vegetables :)

This was really good.  I used less mayo, and a little more ranch, and no dill. I  only put shredded carrots and broccoli (no stem) as the veggies. I also used a little more shredded cheese. yum!

The sheer amount of Cream Cheese made it over whelming to eat a slice. I would say remove about 4 to 6 ounces of the extra Cream Cheese pack and this would be great. Unless you like that cream cheese with raw vegetable taste. This definitely isn't for everyone that's for sure.  I do like the concept but the directions and materials list really fall short here.

This makes a very good, fresh tasting appetizer.  I omit the green pepper, it is a little over bearing in my opinion.  This would be a hit at any party, I would highly recommend it.

I love veggie pizza!  This week when I made it, I was out of cresents and didn't want to make a trip into town, so I used biscuits instead.  Also, I had some ranch dip already made for carrots- it had sour cream instead of cream cheese, so I used that.  I still prefer the original recipe!  Thanks for a keeper!

YUMMY! I made this my first time at my son`s first birthday. Everyone raved over it. It was the best I have ever made, I really didn`t like my other recipe - too much mayo. But, this is perfect and so creamy. My picky toddlers all loved it!

My family has made this recipe for as many years as I can remember.  I lost the original recipe a few years ago, and am glad that I have found it again with this recipe.  It's versatile enough to change it to fit your tastes. Any vegetable will work with this recipe. Instead of using mayonnaise though, I use Miracle Whip as that gives it just a touch more zing. YUM!

This was quite good but next time I will try the refrigerated pizza crust as I found the crescent roll crust too soft. I ended up using 8oz. light cream cheese,1/3 cup each Hellmanns mayo and bottled ranch dressing and 1 teaspoon of dill as the topping and this worked but tastes better once throughly chilled.

Great recipe! However, I used only 1 package of cream cheese and 1/2 cup of sour cream (instead of mayo). I think it would have been too much "sauce" had I used everything. I also used a package of Ranch dressing to taste.

EXCELLENT! I made this for a meeting I had at my house. Everyone loved it, the only problem was is I had so much "sauce" leftover!!! I had enough to make two more pizzas! I used some of it as veggie dip but I had to throw the rest away. Overall very good and easy, just too much leftover toppings! I will probably make it again.
