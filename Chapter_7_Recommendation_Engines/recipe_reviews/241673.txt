Excellent recipe for using leftover corned beef, especially when you're not a fan of sauerkraut. I used corned beef from 'Slow Cooked Corned Beef for Sandwiches' recipe from this site.

Made Braised Corn Beef Brisket recipe from this site, as well as Chilled Russian Salad Dressing.  Added swiss cheese for a very yummy sandwich!

A winning sandwich recipe! Now one of my favorites. Combination of ingredients are delicious and using Russian dressing is fabulous! I used Marie's (from the cold section) because it's thick and doesn't run. Couldn't help myself and added a slice of Provolone cheese. YUM! Thanks SHORECOOK, your recipes always please.

I believe this is what's called a 'Rachel' sandwich in parts of the US.

Our family loves this sandwich.  We frequently swap out the Russian dressing with Blue Cheese dressing.
