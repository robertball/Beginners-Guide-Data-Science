Yummy! this IS ever better than pumpkin pie. Super creamy.  The squash is easy to deal with if prebaked (halved, seeds scooped out, face down in a baking pan with a little water with a 1/2 inch of water, covered in foil and baked for 1/2 hour at 350*) Then you can just scoop it out and you're ready to puree with the other ingredients.

I microwaved a small butternut sq. for three minutes to make it easy to cut and easy to peal. No puncturing necessary, it won't blow up. I ground both my allspice and cloves in a crucible. I added all 5 of the spices to a room temperature beaten egg and let set 30 minutes to bloom/release the taste(Std. Minnonite trick for all recipes using spices and eggs). I substituted 1/3 cup each of the following sugars: white, brown and corn syrup (Std cowboy trick for richer taste). At 35 minutes I placed a shield over the edges. I used a crust calling for cold unsalted butter and ice water and cut 1" overhang with shears and folded under the edge and used my nuckle inside and two pinching fingers outside to form the edge. Squash/slide extra dough into center bottom to combat crust shrinkage. One guy at the Thanks Giving table ate three pieces and wanted more.

I had never made any kind of pumpkin pie before, but this one turned out so well that I never WILL make a "real" pumpkin pie!  The butternut squash was easy to work with, and the whole recipe was simple.  The only slight problem I had was getting the pie into the oven without spilling, since it was quite liquidy before cooking (but it turned out the perfect consistency).  We had it with whipped cream on top--yum!  The second time I made this pie, I didn't have any of the frozen/unbaked pie crusts.  I used a graham ready-made pie shell, and it turned out great!  The liquid seeped into the crust, giving it some flavor and preventing it from burning in the oven.

I made this pie for friends & they pronounced it fabulous.
For the squash: Cut in half & microwave cut side down in a dish w/ 1/4 " water approx. 15 minutes. Cool & scoop out flesh. Super Easy to work with.  Sooooooooooooooo smooth & not too sweet. I plan on making it for Thanksgiving. Forget canned pumpkin!

Wow.  I really wanted a pumpkin pie, but I like them made from fresh pumpkin and they were all sold out here. This was fantastic.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of doing the squash in the oven.  I think next time I'll just follow ALL of the directions and boil it.  Either way, this is a fantastic pie and well worth the trouble.  After this, you'll never eat an autumn time pie out of a can again!  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!!

I cooked the squash in the oven before peeling and instead of boiling-worked great. Also made real pumpkin to compare. The squash was so smooth, the pumkin still had some strings. Everyone enjoyed the sqaush better than the pumpkin, but do wait until they are enjoying it to tell them it's not pumpkin!

I was very happy with the outcome of this recipe. It definitely tasted like pumpkin pie but a little sweeter, a little creamier and much lighter. I did alter the recipe a little as suggested in other reviews (thanks katie_luvs2bake!)  *2 3/4 cups peeled/cubed butternut squash, 1 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tbsp cornstarch, 2 eggs, 1 tbsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp each ginger and nutmeg, 1/8 tsp each cloves and all spice*  Made more filling and added more flavor and spice. I thought it was very delicious and the family agreed too! I also used the Butter Flaky Pie Crust recipe for this pie. Perfect addition! Can't wait until next Thanksgiving to make this again!

I loved this pie.  It is definitely better than pumpkin pie.  You don't need a very big squash to make it.

Served this at Thanksgiving and did not reveal the true main ingredient until after my family ate it.  None of us thought this pie lived up to its name.  It was good, but I think it could have used a little more of the spices, especially cinnamon.  Not a bad alternative, for a change of pace.

Roast the squash, don't boil it. Use a big chef knife, drive the point into the squash, and slice down the length toward the top. Then set it upright, and slice down the rest of the way. Scrape out the seeds, but don't peel. Put it cut side down on a silicone baking mat or oiled baking tray, and bake it at 350 until it starts to seep liquid and feels soft when you press on it. Cool. Scrape the cooked squash out of the skin. Puree. Measure out what you need and freeze the rest.

This is awesome! What a great way to use squash. I've made this twice in the last week. The first time I made as-written and it was excellent, the second time, I increased the recipe by half (to make a thicker pie) and upped the spices significantly and I liked it even better. Thanks for a classic recipe!

The butternut squash worked out fine and I like the idea but this recipe was FAR too spicy. I tried again with half the spices and it was still too strong for me!

Absolutely delicious!! My squash was already pureed, yet I still used 1.5 cups because that's an amount that a pumpkin pie would usually called for. I added 1/2 tsp of salt because I didn't want to take the chance of it being bland. This baked 75 minutes and the knife still wasn't clean when coming out, but I didn't want to have the crust get any harder and the filling any darker.
2nd time: I baked like a pumpking pie, for 15 mins @ 425 then 40 mins @ 350, and it came out perfectly!

No one will know this isnt pumpkin and they will ask how you got your pumpkin pie to taste so good. Now i know what to do with the one hundred butternut squash my garden is producing.

Very easy, and a crowd-pleaser. 
I made some changes:
1. If you follow the recipe, it comes out way too sweet. Use half the sugar.
2. Omit the cornstarch; instead, add an extra egg plus two tablespoons of flour.
3. I doubled-up on the spices.

It's all in the name. I've made this 5 times this season and everyone who tries it said the same thing-it's the best pumpkin pie ever. I cooked one large butternut squash made 2 pies and froze the left overs in 1 cup portions-enough for 2-3 more pies, kept the 3 pre-measured dry ingredients in the pantry. Couldn't be faster. Great recipe.

Definitely an amazing recipe! I'm not a big reviewer, but I had to log back on to say that I have made this pie twice now, and it is DELICIOUS! I follow the recipe exactly as written. It is so smooth and creamy. Much better than pumpkin pie from canned pumpkin. My father-in-law practically ate the whole pie. I'll be making it again tomorrow and I've already promised him one for Christmas! A keeper for sure!

I've made this pie twice. Once with canned squash & once with frozen squash. And, I used a graham cracker crust (coat with egg whites & bake 5 minutes @ 350, to keep from qetting soggy). Both pies were excellent.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year.  It was good but not that much better than pie made with canned pumpkin and much more labor-intensive.

Already had butternut squash ready to use (note: we bake our butternuts which we grew, whole in the oven at 350 till they are brown on the outside and soft enough to push in. Squash develops a nice rich flavor and comes right off the skin.) I used 3 cups of whisked in the kitchenaid squash. Added all the ingredients. Did a dash for a pinch. Baked for 50 mins in middle of oven in glass pie plate. Was still a tad wet in center. Turned oven off and let sit in oven for 10 more minutes. 
CAME OUT DELISH!!! Served with slightly sweetened, vanilla dash of homemade whipped cream.

This is a keeper! I'm not a fan of pumpkin pie and I had some squash that I wasn't sure what to do with it but this was outstanding. Smooth and satisfying my sweet tooth without going overboard.

This recipe was awesome. Everyone thought it was pumpkin pie. They were even more surprised when I told them it was butternut squash because it tasted so good. Thanks for this great information on how to use up squash! I only put in half the sugar called for because I like my desserts a little less sweet, but other than that I made it just like the recipe says.

This was my first time making a pie from fresh squash.  Actually it was my first time doing anything with a fresh winter squash!  It can't believe how easy it was!  I prepared the squash itself a couple days ahead (I had planned to make it that day but I was missing a couple ingredients), refrigerated it and processed it with the remaining ingredients later.  I don't think I've ever tasted pumpkin pie made from fresh pumpkin rather than canned, but this tastes so much better than a canned-pumpkin pie!  My fiance, who was  almost afraid to taste it because he isn't big on squash, absolutely loves this!  He agrees that it's better than pumpkin :)  I believe I'll be making this recipe several more times this year!

I love this recipe! It has become a staple at my family's Thanksgivings. My son told me the week before Thanksgiving (he's away at college now), 'I've been thinking about that pie for weeks!' I prefer draining the puree overnight through cheesecloth, and I bake the squash (halved) in about an inch of water. Much easier than peeling and chopping a raw one.

This makes a pretty tasty pie. If I didn't know it wasn't pumpkin I probably wouldn't guess that it wasn't. I accidentally grabbed condensed milk (oops) so I just left out the sugar and subbed the can of condensed milk for the evaporated. Even still, the pie was really creamy, and it tasted good.

Hard to say if it's better than pumpkin pie because we've never had real pumpkin pie before this one! Either way, I liked the rich buttery flavour  of the filling. I used a whole squash (2 cups 1/2) and added more spice and an extra egg to compensate. Dh said it was just ok but I think he wouldn't like the real thing either so it's more a question of personal taste...

This is really good! It has a nice, consistent, smooth texture.  I omitted the allspice, cloves, and nutmeg because I didn't have any on me.  THESE ARE ESSENTIAL!!!!! But, nonetheless, very good recipe.  Thanks!

Great pie, easy to make, and I got to use my crucible to grind the fresh cloves. I used six and it was a little bit strong but still very good. I made a double pie crust and added a tbl spoon full of vinegar to the crust which is my secret ingredient. Don't ever think spices are as good out of a bottle as fresh ground. I will always use this recipe.

This has got to be the easiest pie in the world to make! And one butternut squash can make about 4 pies. I put a touch of orange extract in it one time and it has a very unique flavor.

This pie was great in all respects except one--it was FAR too spicy (and I like spicy food)!  I will probably cut the spices in half next time.  Other than that, the squash tasted GREAT, and I loved the texture (it was watery when I put it into the oven, but came out perfect).

I usually don't care for pumpkin pie, because of the strong flavor of the pumpkin.  This squash pie with the butternut squash is just fabulous. Great served warm, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I thought this was a great pie.  I love butternut squash, but have never made any type of pie.  I used a reviewer’s suggestion to microwave the squash for a few minutes to soften it enough to cut and peel more easily. I then cubed 2 cups of the squash and boiled it for about 15 mins as written in the recipe. I used my ninja to purée all the ingredients. The filling amount was perfect for the 9 inch pie crust.  I thought the spices tasted great. The pie was very creamy.  In the future I will try a slightly firmer/thicker filling by adding more squash which may require upping the spices just a little.

Amazing!  Has a soft texture/consistency but no one could tell that it wasn't pumpkin pie!  Very easy to make.  I took the recommendation to bake the squash first and found that was very easy and time saving.  Will definitely make again.

This is SOOOO good! I had leftover cubes of roasted butternut squash and was looking for a way to use them. Even though the cubes had been salted when I cooked them, I decided to take a chance. This pie turned out great. I will definitely be making it again. ( I was out of ginger, so did not add that)

Another keeper from Allrecipes.com. I have not made many pumpkin pies before. As a rule I find them bland and stringy even when out of a can. I used an immersion blender to make the squash smooth and I added twice the pinches of allspice, cloves, ginger and nutmeg. Due to our elevation and having a funky electric oven, I also added 15 minutes of bake time. It was so well received that I had to hide a piece for me. Lovely! Allrecipes.com is on a roll.

This was a very good pie, everyone loved it and some even said it was there favorite. I am not a squash lover, but this pie pleasantly surprised me! The one change I made was instead of one cup sugar I did 1/2 firmly packed just because  pie recipes normally call for WAY to much sugar.

Overall this pie was a big hit!

I used a combination of different fall squashes and it was fantastic!!!  I also made a homemade graham cracker crust!  Perfect job for a little helper!

Really yummy.  Made the mods suggested earlier:
 - 2 eggs not 1
 - 1.25 cups brown sugar not 1 cup
 - 1 can evaporated milk not 1 cup
 - 1/8 tsp cloves added

Delicious and better the second day with whipped cream!

It was a great recipe, next time I will opt for less brown sugar because it was a little too sweet for my liking. I would also recommend adding some flour for a thicker consistency. Other than that...it was great!

The texture and flavor of this pie was spot on to pumpkin pie. My entire family loved it. Unlike other reviewers, I thought the spices were good and weren't too overpowering. The only thing I didn't like was I thought the recipe didn't make a thick enought filling. Even in my smallest pie dish there was room to add more filling. Something I'm going to have to tweak for my own pans I guess, but overall, I'll be making this pie again and again!

This was a big hit here! It's my new "pumpkin pie" for the holidays. I followed it exactly except for the crust I made a "graham cracker" crust using crushed ginger snap cookies. Ridiculously delicious!

So, so, yummy!! It was delicious! The only thing I did different was instead of boiling the squash i like to roast it. Cut the squash in half, smother the inside with butter, and roast it, cut side down, in the oven. (375* for 45 min.) I think next time I might go a little less brown sugar, for my taste, but my family loved it the way it was. I had some saying it tastes like pumpkin pie and some said it tasted like sweat potato pie. One squash made two pies! Great alternative to pumpkin pie this Thanksgiving. Thanks for sharing!

I'm rating this 4 stars as is because I didn't alter the spices but they could use some tweaking.  I made 1 1/2 the amount of filling based on previous reviews.  It was more than I could fit in the pie shell but I think as is, the recipe would not have made enough filling.  The spices in the pie are very subtle.  I would double them all next time.  I also had to cook the pie 1 hour and 10 minutes.  It definitely tastes like pumpkin pie, no one would ever know the difference.

interesting recipe!!  after reading a few reviews, i added in more spices (1.5 tsp cinnamon, and maybe a double pinch of all the rest...i didn't have allspice) because i didn't want it to be tasteless.  it wasn't!  now that the pie is cool, it's not as solid as i think pumpkin pie is, but it's more of a 'melt in your mouth' type of taste...not as gritty as pumpkin pie (maybe b/c there's no white sugar in this?).  overall tasty, but a lot more work than buying a can of pumpkin at the store.

I just tried 6 different recipes using canned pumpkin and fresh pumpkin and also this recipe. We also threw a piece of store bought pumpkin pie for the taste test. I wasn't expecting much from this one as the squash puree was really watery and still lumpy after processing over and over, but it ended up surprising everyone. It turned out a nice dark color and was our favorite tasting pie of the bunch. I subbed Splenda brown sugar mix. Great recipe, will be using this for Thanksgiving.

The flavor of this pie was just right.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because I didn't think there was enough filling to fill the pie crust.  Next time I may increase the recipe by half as suggested by another reviewer.  Also, I had to bake this for an additional half-hour (the last 10 minutes at 375).

This was definitely the best pumpkin pie I've had in a while, but I don't necessarily think it has much to do with the use of butternut squash over pumpkin. I think it's more a fresh over canned situation.  I also made the pie crust from scratch, so everything was super fresh and tastey.  I think the main benefit of the butternut squash is it is easier to work with then a whole pumpkin.

I made this pie last year, and again this year, and it was a smash hit both times.  Everyone said their favorite pie was the "pumpkin", and they were astounded when I told them it wasn't pumpkin, but butternut squash!  I absolutely recommend  this recipe!  Edited to add:  I made this AGAIN two days later for church, but used regular orange squash (fresh still) and it came out just as good, if not better than the butternut.  Very creamy!

Better than pumpkin pie?  Not really. Different?  Yes.  Baked the squash, instead of boiling.  I think boiling would make it too soggy.  Much lighter and sweeter than pumpkin.  Got good comments, but I think I like pumpkin best of all.

Came out great!  I don't know what constitutes a pinch, so I used two shakes of each spice.  I had to cook it a little longer than called for as the center had not set, but a pie shield kept the crust from getting too brown.  No one knew it wasn't pumpkin and it's so easy to get fresh butternut squash already peeled and cubed (Trader Joe's), there's no reason not to use this fresh instead of canned pumpkin.

This was definitely tasty, but it needed something more.  It is kind of bland.  I will make it again but add more squash, and lots more spices.  It's a good recipe, though, because it has all the basic stuff you need and you can be a little relaxed about the ingredients.

Well, I scrunched my face up at the thought of 'peeling' squash. That's a pretty hard shell to peel. Since the instructions didn't say to cook it first, I decided the best thing to do was to cut up the squash, and cut away the shell. It worked pretty well, the squash cooked fairly quickly in water. My medium squash (about 2-3 pounds) made plenty - enough for two pies, I'd say.

This was my first homemade pie. It turned out very well, tasted just like pumpkin. I will make it again :)

This is DELICIOUS!! So much better than canned pumpkin, and really easy. I baked the squash to preserve flavor and nutrients. It's good with a graham cracker crust.

I received very positive comments when I served this. Delicious, rich flavor, though I personally thought it was a little on the heavy side.  Perhaps an additional egg and a little extra cream might make it a little more custardy for my taste.

This is so good!  I think it is the fresh butternut squash that makes it even tastier than a normal pumpkin pie!
I add a little more squash to make bulk up the pie filling!
I could eat the entire pie myself ;)

I recently held an 'American Thanksgiving' dinner party (I live in Australia) and cooked this pie for the first time.  It was an absolute hit with every guest and really made the meal.  Thanks.

This turned out better than any pumpkin pie I’ve ever made. It has a smoother, creamier texture than pumpkin and it didn’t crack. I made it as written except I didn’t have evaporated milk so I substituted half a cup of milk and half a cup of cream.

I used an immersion blender for a few minutes. Slightly chunky, but still tasty. Need to use immersion blender longer or use countertop blender. Used ingredients as is (did not double). Made two pies. Baked longer (extra 30 minutes?) with two pies.

I used a tbsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of all the spices, since I didn't have allspice or ginger in the house. It turned out great!

I tried this recipe for the first time and love how it turned out!  I baked the butternut squash according to others' recommendations, and the squash was very easy to scoop out of the shell.  I used 1-1/2 cups of the "mashed" squash, instead of 1-1/2 cups of peeled and cubed squash, and that amount worked well.  Because I didn't have all the separate spices, I used 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and about 1/4 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, which included cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and allspice in its ingredients.  This recipe is a keeper for me!

A bit sweet for my taste, but it was a tasty way to use up a gigantic squash from a neighbor. The center was a bit soupy, but it was still good. The color isn't that appetizing, though, since it's not as bright orange as pumpkin.

BY far my favourite pie recipe and I make more than one so I can share.  Every time I do, people say it is the best "pumpkin" pie they have ever had.  This recipe is perfect , no changes necessary.  But I have made this so many times and often do not have evaporated milk so then I just use half and half cream.

Stuck to the recipe. Loved it. I hate the way the canned tastes like aluminum and the pumpkin is so stringy. The weird thing about this filling was it was so thin! I thought it would never set up. 15 extra minutes in oven.  It made a thin pie, it could have used a bit extra filling. I'll try one of the other reviewers changes for more filling next time.

I made this before Thanksgiving and at Thanksgiving . I followed the recipe except I microwaved my squash and used fresh spices. I used  a pinch of spices when called for , which is a lot less than an 1/8 of a teaspoon. We found the flavors to be perfect for our large gathering.  Some family members did not know it hubbard squash and loved it.  I have a heavy duty blender and it made it very creamy and light. I cooked my squash in the microwave so that I would not have flavors lost in the water and extra water absorbed by the squash.  It is my go to "pumpkin" pie.

I doubled the recipe for a deep dish pie, going a bit light on the evaporated milk since a can contains 12 oz.  Sweetness and spicing was just right; a pinch is not a scientific measurement, so go easy and taste. I used blue hubbard squash that I had processed and frozen several months prior. It worked perfectly.

I would definitely say that it is better than pumpkin pie, at least any that I have had. Though, a change I made was that, instead of butternut, I used a jarrahdale-like squash.

This pie tastes very similar to the pie my grandma used to make when I was a lot younger. She always used butternut squash also. Brought back some great memories and is once again one of my favorites.

Amazing recipe I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a great tasting pie.

I will never buy another can of pumpkin.  The pie was light and creamy, almost delicate.  Delicious.
I use butternut in a lot of recipes that only call for 2 cups.  That usually leaves 2 cups of squash I don't want to waste; just enough for a quick and simple pie.

The flavor of the filling is very good but after 50 minutes in the oven it is still very liquid-y. Not sure what's gone wrong.  After 50 minutes I was able to fill a spoon with it and it poured right out.  I'm pretty bummed.

Turned out great. May never use pumpkin again. My son bought me an enormous butternut squash and I didn't know what to do with it all after the first meal. I figured go find a pumpkin recipe. ..and viola! Perfecto! If you don't have a leaf cookie cutter. Just go find a leaf, cover the dough with plastic wrap. Press leaf into dough then cut around it. The leaf veins and all should remain.  :)

It definitely tasted different from pumpkin pie, but I loved it! It was a little too sweet for me as is, so maybe next time I'll decrease the sugar a bit.

This was pretty good and a great way to use the other half of a left over butternut squash.  Figure about 1.25lbs of squash for a pie.  I doubled the recipe and cut the sugar by 25%.

It really does taste just like pumpkin pie. I followed the recipe exactly, only I didn't have allspice so emitted it completely.

WOW this was incredible! I did however make a few changes to lighten the calorie load. I used Splenda brown sugar and fat free condensed milk. I was worried that because of smaller amount of sugar the "btter" looked watery so I added about an extra cup or so of squash. it still appeared pretty liquidy but baked it and hoped for the best. IT WAS DELICIOUS!! even my 12 year old son loved it!

I no longer make pumpkin pie EVER. I make my filling ahead and freeze so when I'm busy around the holidays all I have to do is defrost and fill my crusts. I brag about this recipe (even though it isn't mine) and share it with anyone that bakes.

Wonderful! I used pumpkin pie seasoning and this was perfect. If you leave out the egg and milk, you're ready to use this in any recipe calling for pumpkin pie mix (maybe the cornstarch too, but I left that in without a problem - will leave it out when freezing mix). Very handy since every store seems to be fresh out! Thanks for the easy recipe.

Love it.. the best "pumpkin' pie I ever ate.  I did up the spices, 2x cinnamon, a few good shakes of ginger, a few shakes of apple pie spice just WHAT I HAD ON HAND and the recipe needs to be tripled to give 2 nice size pies. Also, I used a potato peeler to peel the whole squash.  Made that part really easy.  I already polished off my last piece. Thank goodness I sent the other one home with my mother or I would sticking a knife in it right now.....

I used a small butternut squash from my garden and had about 2 cups of mashed squash, so I figured my pie would be thicker, but went ahead and upped the spiced like suggested and used 2 eggs.  This was a very smooth pie.  Tastes just like pumpkin pie, but I don't think I had enough spices.  My filling made 2 pies, so if I'd doubled the amount of spices from what I used, it might have been amazing.  I think next time I'll throw some oatmeal in there just to be different and to give some texture.

I have made this twice: once with butternut squash, peeled and boiled, using almond milk to replace the evaporated milk and following the rest of the recipe exactly.   The second time, I used a buttercup squash (round, flat topped, greenish) and added a 2nd egg instead of the cornstarch (still used almond milk due to a cow's milk allergy).  Both were baked in flan cups in a bain-marie in a 325 degree oven. The second version was much more flavourful and richer with the 2 eggs.  It was so amazing that I could not stop eating the finished product!!  While both versions are very good; the second one is great!

This pie is awesome!! I couldn't find the Butternut squash at the store so I bought a Spaghetti squash. I was a little nervous because I was making this for my husband to take to a Thanksgiving lunch at work. I baked the squash..and it is weird because it looks like spaghetti! Once it is in the food processor it comes out smooth. The people my husband works with were raving about it. I was so relieved...I am making another for our Thanksgiving celebration. Thanks!!

This is a delicious recipe! Even though it taste a bit more like veggies, its still awesome and it does taste a lot like pumpkin pie, because my family  didn't believe me at first when I told them it was squash!  Thanks so much for this delicous recipe!

I was looking for a way to use a large squash!  This was a great recipe!  I like it better than the Libby's pumpkin pie that I usually make every year. I used soy milk so my husband could eat it and it worked fine.  I also made some with the canned milk and they were great!

The most difficult part of this recipe is cutting the squash in half; if you have some hints on an easier way, I'd love to hear them! However, we LOVE this recipe, and it's worth the trouble when you taste the results. The butternut squash gives the pie a richer flavor than plain pumpking, and my 7 & 9 year olds ask for this pie every year. Thanks for posting, I've been making this since 2005.

I loved this!  I usually don't like pumpkin pie all the much either.  I made this for Thanksgiving this past week and everyone loved it.  I told everyone the secret when I had one teeny tiny slice left and 2 family members wanted the last slice to see what it tasted like.  

I also cooked the squash in the microwave face down with a little water in the pan instead of baking.  I grew larger butter nut squash this summer, so I didn't even use a whole squash.  I could have gotten away with using just half of one.

Very tasty - I used dark brown sugar, a rounded tsp. of cinnamon, several gratings of fresh nutmeg, a pinch of cloves and about 1/4 tsp.  ginger (my family prefers a richer, spicier taste).  For the squash I used about 1 and 1/4 cups previously cooked, then mashed and frozen butternut squash.  Very good pie!

My first time making a fresh squash pie.  Only made pumpkin pie from a can and advised against making pie from fresh pumpkin.  I haven't figured out why it took me almost double the about of baking time, but it turned out wonderful.  Will do this one again and again.

This was good, but I was not convinced that it tasted any different from actual pumpkin pie.  It had a good texture, but I took 1 star away because really I think it is just easier to open a can of pumkpin than to go through all the mess and hassle with the squash, especially since you can't really tell the difference.  No one at the Thanksgiving table was really able to taste any difference between this and the real pumpkin pie.  Probably unlikely that I'll make this one again.

This pie tasted wonderful and very creamy. My husband quickly declared it "better than his mother's." Now that's saying something! I had run out of nutmeg and the pie STILL tasted great. Can't wait to make it with all the spices. Yum, even better!

Great texture, great taste, everyone loved it.  It was very easy to make.  This was the first pie I ever made and it was to die for.  Totally outrageous.
