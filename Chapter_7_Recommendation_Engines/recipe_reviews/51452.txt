I made this recipe over the weekend and baked one batch; I was disappointed that they did seem to spread out quite a bit.  I was expecting a much chunkier, thicker cookie.  I stuck the rest of the cookie dough in the fridge cause I got busy with the kids and took it out to use the rest today.  What a huge difference some fridge time made!  This time the cookies came out thick, crunchy and delicious.  Will definitely use this recipe again, but plan on refrigerating the dough before baking.

Now this is an chocolate chip oatmeal cookie! Crispy and chewy - just a lovely texture.  I used pecans instead of peanuts.  You can leave out the espresso without compromising the cookie, if coffee flavor isn't your thing

This is a really crispy oatmeal cookie with a good taste, but don't expect to much with the coffee flavor. When I tasted the dough raw, the espresso really came through. But once it was cooked, I did not taste it. If I made this again I would probably increase the espresso so that I could taste it more. I made them bigger with my ice cream scooper and cooked for 15 minutes.

Uh-oh,  I thought.  A dry and crumbly dough will produce a dry and crumbly cookie.  I even had some difficulty keeping  the the little dough balls in mounds on the cookie sheet.  But when they came out of the oven....wow.  They're not the prettiest cookie I've ever made, but the looks were deceiving.  The cookies are sweet, and gooey and soft and chewy and chocolaty and oatie all at once.    And they stayed that way long after the chocolate chips had set. The peanuts were unexpected and made these cookies particularly delicious.  Normally I give most of what I bake away - Hubs didn't want me to this time.   Still, I think if I were to make these again,  I'd add a tablespoon or two of milk to moisten the dough.

Delicious!  I substituted pistachios for the peanuts, and I have to say, the salted flavor actually combines very well with the chocolate and the coconut.  I halved the recipe and made the cookies about twice as big, and still got two dozen, but they taste great.  Be warned, they do spread out quite a bit - I thought all the "chunks" of things would keep them higher, but they spread out into one big cookie on my first tray :)

These were really good. I had requests to make oatmeal cookies and chocolate chip cookies, so this recipe was able to satisfy everyone. I halved the recipe and omitted the coconut as I'm not a big fan, and these came out great. I didn't have any espresso powder but I did have regular coffee powder that I used, which really gave it a nice flavor. A really really tasty cookie that I'll be making again.

These were fantabulous!  Makes enough to put a few in the freezer to enjoy later. (Do not double recipe!)

I followed the recipe almost exactly except I toasted the coconut.  I chilled the dough as other reviewers complained of a thin cookie.  They baked up fat and chewy--delicious texture.  The taste of the cookie did not come near the presentation.  Not a very tasty cookie at all-no one ate them.

These cookies are weird.  They spread too much & I can't really tell if they are "done" because they look gooey even when they are done.  They don't look very appetizing either.  The taste is good, but I don't like the texture.  Too crisp & chewy for me.  I doubt I will make them again.

This is an amazing recipe - everyone in my family loves it.  I did switch the regular flour, that was called for in the recipe, to a Gluten Free flour mixture (my son is on a Gluten Free diet) - changing the flour did not affect the taste of them at all and made it so that he could enjoy them, too.  Thankfully, the oatmeal in them does not affect him or we would have missed out on trying this incredible cookie.

I love these cookies and so do all my camping friends!  I have made them twice now exactly how the recipe says  and they are delicous. There is so little coconut that even my friends that don't coconut still enjoy the cookies.

These turned into one cookie in the oven, that was way too sweet and very greasy. I was sad it have used my peanuts and chocolate chips in this recipe. I had very high hopes for these... I may try again but with some major alterations... I have changed my review from a one to a three star. Since the ingredients were just so good sounding I broke up the unicookie that came out of the over and stored them for a couple of days... they tasted much better than day one.

I was delighted with these cookies.  I did have the instant espresso on hand and it was a great addition, but not overwhelming like another cookie I tried with the coffee flavor.  I will definitely be making these again!

Made this recipe for the first time for our camping trip with friends.  It was so popular that now I'm asked to make it for all our get-togethers!  I made a few adjustments to suit my taste:  I used walnuts or pecans instead of peanuts; 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 cup butterscotch chips instead of milk chocolate chips; and instant coffee powder instead of espresso powder.  I found that it makes 4 dz cookies for me.

These were very good. I used unsalted peanuts because salted seemed a bit strange for a sweet cookie. Also I halved the recipe and still got about 45 cookies, so next time I will maybe make them bigger. They do stay crunchy too.

Made the recipe as is. I thought they were a bit sweet for me. However, I seem to be the only one who does. Kids and adults were grabbing 2 to 3 at a time.  Everyone loved them. Since they were so enjoyed, I will make them again. It is a great recipe.

I thought these looked good.  Inadvertently added a whole bag of chocolate chips - about 2/3 too much.  By the time I had all mixed I realized I'd be up too late to bake.  Threw dough in fridge, made next morning,  and they did not spread too much at all.  My friend thought they were delicious, I thought they were a bit bland.  After rereading ingredients I'd add 1 TBS of vanilla next time as this is a large amount of dough for only one tsp and another egg if using whole bag of chips!  Thanks.

It was tasty, but not my type of cookie.  It was too soft for me.  The cookies were not gobbled down by my family like they usually are.

The neighbors ask when I will make these again (I often share baked goods with them)!  Great recipe.  Don't substitute for the butter.  They keep and travel very well, if they last that long!  Thanks for posting this recipe.

I made these for my son-in-law and co-workers and they all raved about them. I substituted cocoanut oil for the butter and they still raved.
