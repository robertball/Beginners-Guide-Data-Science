I'm new to vegan baking (my husband and I are not vegans). I was surprised by how much my husband loved these cookies and I was thrilled with how they came out. I tried these because I was craving something sweet but only had a half stick of butter and no eggs. This is now my 'go-to' cookie recipe! It's fast, it's easy, and it's healthier compared to other cookies while still fully satisfying your sweet-tooth. 
I made 2 batches. The first batch, I decided to add 1/3 cup more flour because of the loose and sticky consistency of the dough. The next batch I tried chilling the dough for about 15 minutes before handling (you may want to increase the chill time). Both batches came out tasting great but the dough is much easier to handle when you add more flour. Both batches also made for very moist cookies, however,  the original recipe is a little more moist. Ultimately, my husband and I slightly preferred the batch with less flour. 
I used almond oil instead vegetable oil and I used coconut milk instead of almond milk for both batches (personal preferences as well as what I had on hand). I added a good sized pinch of the sugar-cinnamon mixture into both batches before rolling the dough into balls and finally rolling them in the sugar-cinnamon mix before baking. I lined the cookie sheet with wax paper and sprinkled a little of the sugar-cinnamon mix on the paper before placing the cookies on the sheet. Baking for 10 minutes at 375 F was perfect for my oven. 
These cookies will now

I read all the comments about it being batter not dough. Mine also was that way but all I did was roll them in the cinnamon sugar and placed them on the cookie sheet. They turned out great! I did use organic all purpose floor and all organic ingredients. Can't wait to share with my grandchildren.

I'm not sure how the ratings on this are so high. I've been Vegan baking for years. This is a terrible recipe. The dough is more of a batter. I had to add at least 1/2 cup more flour, maybe more, to make it thick enough to roll. They tasted ok, but are definitely more cake than cookie.

Just made this! I used soy milk instead of almond, and used white flour instead!  I let the dough sit in the fridge for about 20 minutes before baking the cookies! I made mine a bit too big, because trust me they DO expand.  They came out perfect, they reminded me of a muffin inside they were so soft. This is my new favorite recipe.

I made these twice, with a few changes. I decreased the applesauce and the oil (1/3 cup) and used white flour. They came together easily and quickly. If the dough is too wet, you can chill it for an hour. Family enjoyed them, and the two vegans at dinner were very appreciative of my effort. ONE THING - I recommend you serve them the same day you bake them. I baked mine and then stored them overnight and they became very soft. To maintain the texture of this snickerdoodle, serve them the same day.

This was my first time baking anything vegan for a few hospital coworkers who are vegan and it turned out great! LOVE these cookies! I added 1.5 tablespoons of vanilla extract, 6 oz of apple sauce and 2 tablespoons of vanilla flavored almond milk then let the batter sit for 30 minutes to thicken up. The cookies still ran on the sheet which I used parchment paper for and they were tasty!  10 minutes was all they needed to cook. Definitely going to be making them again.

Changed the recipe a little! Used 1/4 cup of oil instead of 1/2 cup and used 2 oz of apple sauce instead of 4 oz. I used 1/2 tbsp of vanilla extract instead of 1 tbsp. I made up for the lack of moisture by adding more almond milk! They turned out great! Also added cinnamon into the batter as well as on top of the cookies.

These cookies were great. Light, fluffy and delicious! I refrigerated the dough about 30 minutes before rolling and had no problems. This was my first attempt at vegan baking, and I was very impressed.

These were so good! So light and fluffy which I didn't expect with the whole wheat flour. I was unable to roll them into balls as the recipe stated because the batter was not formed enough to do so! However I sprinkled the cinnamon sugar mixture on top and they turned out fine! 10 minutes was perfect for mine! Also could have made less cinnamon sugar, maybe because I didn't roll them but I used about 1/4th cup at most!

Read through some of the other peoples ratings of this. I cut the recipe in half but didn't adjust the vanilla extract amount(big fan of it) and add tablespoon and a half more of  almond milk. turned out big and fluffy. 10/10 would make again. Tastes like an apple snickerdoodle cookie

I’ve been trying different sugar / snickerdoodle cookie recipes and this one is definitely my favorite! I love the ingredient list because I always have everything, some recipes make vegan cookies way more complicated than they need to be! They turned out delicious, I did need to cook them a few minutes longer but the dough was so quick and simple to make so it was still a very fast process! Will be making these again

Wow!  This recipe tastes amazing and was a huge hit amongst my co -workers as well.  
My second vegan recipe and this is a keeper!  

I read through the other reviews and followed some of their suggestions:: the main one being I chilled the dough for an hour in the refrigerator and it rolled up nicely into balls to then rollin the cinnamon sugar mix. 
Use of on hand ingredients—I used olive oil —and:  I used unsweetened almond milk and no sugar added applesauce. 

I will be making this one again. And often.   Thanks for the great recipe!

Made these tonight and received rave reviews from non-vegans and vegans.  I actually got 20 small cookies out of this batch which came together very easily.  I used AP flour and organic coconut palm sugar instead of the the whole wheat and white sugar.  I made a simple glaze of powdered sugar and almond milk to sweeten them up just a touch more(they would be fine as is but I was considering the party goers and palm sugar just doesn't seem quite as sweet) The texture was very soft and cake like. Like some reviewers suggested, I chilled the dough before baking.  350F for 10 minutes, convection setting for soft, cake like cookies.

I'm very much not a vegan but my lady friend, ah the things we do for love, anyhoo, I was surprise at how great these were, however, it is much more like a scone than a cookie, they rise a lot and have a nice crunch on the outside but a cake like consistency on the inside, I would totally recommend this recipe, but don't expect a real crunchy cookie

I used a gluten-free flour mix (Costco) to satisfy a couple of dietary needs and used water intead of the almond milk .  I am very happy with the result.  It was quite oily so didn't roll them in the sugar mix but did sprinkle them liberally instead.  Is the wheat flour version oily too?

Everyone loved them!!! 
Changes I made- 1 stick vegan butter rather than oil, water instead of almond milk (didn't have it), all purpose flour (didn't have wheat), turbinado sugar for cinnamon sugar (ran out of white)

The dough was really sticky and soft even after refrigerating for awhile.  Cookies spread out in the over and it looked like I was going to have one giant cookie! Would still make again since everyone loved them, but would spread them out more and make the cookies smaller.  Thank you!

We used coconut oil instead of vegetable, and original unsweetened almond milk (to accommodate for what we had on hand) and these turned out fabulous. We only needed about 1/2 of the cinnamon sugar mixture, and my husband thought that the cookies would all bake together based on the consistency of the dough but they turned out perfectly moist and delicious. I don't think anyone would know they are vegan if we didn't tell them. It's so easy we will keep this recipe handy!

These were easy, quick and yummy! Followed the directions except used canola oil. Refrigerated the dough as some others suggested. I am really happy to find these vegan cookies.

It ended up to be the consistency of a batter, not that of a cookie dough.  I couldn't roll them into balls, so I had to put globs in the cinnamon/sugar mixture. My cookies ended up flat and they weren't cooked through that much. I won't make again

These are amazing!! I have just recently become a vegan baker after being a full butter baker. This recipe does a great job of giving the fluffy and crunchy texture of snicker doodles. While it doesn't have the same tang, the cookies make up for it with a great mouth feel from the whole wheat flour. I am very impressed and your cookie eaters will be too! Mine made almost 2 dozen cookies as I opted for a smaller cookie size.

Other than switching vegetable oil out for canola oil, I made no changes to the recipe and everyone loved the recipe, vegan or not. The cookies were fluffy and moist from using apple sauce instead of non-vegan ingredients, and they stayed that way for days. I will be making many more times, whether or not it is for a vegan-friendly event.

Yes, I used coconut oil rather than vegetable oil and I chilled the rolled balls for about 15 min before baking so they would stay round.
So moist and tasty and easy to make!  A hit with my  grandchildren and their parents!   Am definitely making again.  Makes 20 cookies in 10 min'!
