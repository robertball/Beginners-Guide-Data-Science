Excellent!  Made these for New Years' Eve party and they were very popular.  I used Grey Goose and they were very smooth and tasty.  The sugar/cinnamon on the rim is the perfect foil for the tanginess of the drink.

More the taste of a sweet red apple than the usual tart green apple taste of most appletinis.
