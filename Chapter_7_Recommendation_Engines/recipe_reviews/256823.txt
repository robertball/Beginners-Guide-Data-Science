I have made this twice, exactly as written.  It is excellent!  Cake is light and flavorful, peach topping is heavenly.  I have used frozen peaches that I thawed out ahead of time.  Edges will get crusty, but my family likes that and we fight over the crusty edge parts.  Takes 2.5 hours in my 6 qt slow cooker.  Never thought about making desserts in the slow cooker before, now I am sold!

I made this with wonderful fresh peaches and it was a hit. I did not increase the sugar and the cakewas as sweet as I would want it to be. So I would hesitate to use canned peaches in heavy sugar syrup with the same amount of sugar in this recipe but of course its a matter of taste.

I do not have a large oval crockpot.  I have a round full size crockpot as well as one with about half the capacity. So I put 2/3 of the recipe in the larger and the remaining 1/3 in the smaller.  Cooked on high for the time indicated and it was perfect.

I took the larger cake to our block party where it was well received and froze the smaller cake for a week to serve at a meeting.  So I can attest that it freezes well at least short-term.

Plan to keep this as a basic recipe to use with any fruit.  Apples will be wonderful.

The flavor of the cake was nice. It was a bit crumbly though. It did burn a bit around the edge by the time the inside was cooked and it never quite caramelized which was disappointing. Maybe I did something wrong? Peach was a nice twist on traditional so I will likely try again just to see if I messed up somehow.

I loved the idea of not heating up the kitchen to make a cake so I tried this. I always try to make a recipe as written the first time but i had to make a couple of changes out of necessity. I couldn't find my almond extract so used vanilla and didn't have any milk so used half and half. That being said, I enjoyed this cake and so did my family. It didn't carmalize but the flavor was really good. I probably won't make it again though, at least not in the crock pot. It was messy getting it out so if I make it again I may try it in the oven.

The cake was very tasty and light but my peaches were a little runny when I dumped it over on the tray.  Maybe I didn't let them sit long enough on the paper towel?  I don't like almond extract so I used  vanilla, replaced the nutmeg with cinnamon,  and I added chopped pecans.  Everyone enjoyed it and since it wasn't the prettiest (I have added a pic) we could joke about how my dad would always say "should I eat it or did I eat it" when my mom made a dessert!  Several people did question why it would be an advantage to cook a cake in a crock pot if you are not camping, and I didn't have an answer for that.
