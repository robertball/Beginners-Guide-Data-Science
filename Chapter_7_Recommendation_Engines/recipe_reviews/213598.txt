This was a wonderful dish!  I did make some changes... Didn't have any heavy cream so I substitued the cream and water for 2% milk and had to cook it for about 1hr 45min before all the liquid was absorbed. I added raisins and apples and it was DELICIOUS.  The second time I made it I only put in half the sugar and you couldn't tell.  Will absolutely make again!

Can't be better. I skipped the egg yolks and I love brown rice pudding even more than regular white. Thanks for a fabulous recipe.

Great recipe! We used all organic ingredients & I did add 1 tsp. of maple syrup with the vanilla & 1 apple diced up with the raisins. We will be making this creamy, tasty dish again soon~ Thanks! Also for anyone wondering, we posted the picture... the red/orange spots are the apples : )

I wanted to make this because I was spending waaay too much on store-bought rice pudding to take in my lunch; this was amazing! I made it with one 12 oz can of evaporated milk instead of half & half, omitted the raisins and forgot the cinnamon, but it was AMAZING. Totally worth scrubbing the scorched bits off the bottom of my saucepan; I am never buying rice pudding again!

I used Uncle Beans brown rice and it takes about 20 minutes and it's done.  I added the raisins with a little liquid still remaining. I don't understand how you can keep cooking rice with no liquid after adding the raisins.  Anyway, after adding the raisins I cooked another 5 minutes.  Maybe I should have done the full 10.  I add the egg yolk mixture but after cooking and stirring it started to separate.  I think the reason was because I still had liquid in my pan.  I added some more milk to help the separating problem.  This recipe was a little sweet/rich for me but still good.

Placed the rice, milk and salt in rice cook then transferred to a pot after to mix remaining ingredients in. I substituted coconut milk for the cream. Super easy, super yummy.

Unbelievable.  Seriously.

So sweet it's inedible. Granted, I added dates instead of raisins, which might have added to the sweetness. The recipe originally attracted me because it used brown rice, which is healthier to white, but the heavy cream in which it was cooked really offset the nutrition factor. Not making it with cream and that much sugar again.

This is very tasty and creamy pudding.  It is quite rich (even though I used part milk and part half and half), and sweet.

This is a great recipe. I modified it slightly. I used a pint of left over cooked Brown rice and substituted the heavy cream for "So delicious French vanilla coconut creamer" and the sugar for splenda and added a dash of nutmeg. It was deliciously rich and healthy.    Next time I'll find a substitute for egg yoke to make it even more healthy. Enjoy!

By far my favorite rice pudding recipe. Dried cranberries work well in place of raisins too.

My family and I loved this pudding.  It did take longer to cook, I kept in on low so the rice was not at all hard.   I also added additional cinnamon.

Pretty good overall. 
I didn't use raisins. 
Also, I subbed the heavy cream  and water for mostly milk and almond milk. Came out really creamy; Should have used some water.
I used a stainless pot and had to stir a lot to prevent sticking/burning. 
I doubled the portion and timing was still pretty right but came out to 6 portions.
I would stay better off to make much more and have fam enjoy twice for the effort.
