I love them. Easy to do and delicious. Its nice and moist, maybe a little heavy (but has real fruit, no artificial flavors) is part of a fruit cupcake. We used a fresh strawberry frosting and was amazing. I guess I can use the same recipe with other fruits. 100% recommended..

I really enjoyed making it. It was simple and easy to follow. Tasted great but I would say add a lot more than 3 drops of Red food dye if you want it to come out pink or red. Mine were kind of greyish for the first batch and when I added 3 more drops they were a little more pink but still not super pink.

We halved the recipe and made mini cupcakes. We added 12-15 drops and got a more pink color.

These were delicious! I ended up having to bake them for an extra 10 minutes past the allotted time but they ended up being a hit for my son’s birthday. And my son has food aversions due to autism and he gobbled them up like they were going out of style! I’ll be making these again for my girlfriends baby shower this Saturday ^_^
