it turned out to be to chocolatey and was just plane granola then put in fridge overnight and it froze! even though it was hard to break apart it still tasted good and I used dried apples instead of almonds.

I was excited to make granola bars for the first time, but ended up disappointed. I couldn't cut it into bars, it just crumbled apart like regular granola. It tastes good, very sweet, and we're eating the crumbs of it, but I wouldn't make it again.
