I really enjoyed this.  Reminds me of my moms goulash except it has bacon in it.  The only change I made was, I used tomato sauce instead of juice and  mixed the tomato sauce in with the ingredients and topped mine with parmesan and motzorella cheese.  This was yummy.

A very family friendly recipe.  I used fire roasted tomatoes, about 1/2 tsp of oregano, 1/4 tsp cumin, 1 clove of minced garlic, and a pinch of sugar.  My husband and 21 month old son both loved it!

Sounds like what we used to call slumgullion also known as American Chop Suey minus the bacon.

This was very good Anytime I try a new recipe and the whole family eats it, it deserves 5 stars.  I would add a tad more green pepper next time I cook it, to suit my individual taste.

This dish was ok.  My husband actually really liked it.  For me, it was a bland tasting goulash.  I couldn't taste the bacon and ended up vamping it up with some mild cheddar cheese.  I won't say it was horrible; but probably not something that I would make again.
