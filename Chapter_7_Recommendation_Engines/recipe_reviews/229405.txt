I had trouble with these...mine definitely don't look like the photo but I gave it my best shot. Would be nice if some of the tricks of the trade were shared. My oreos stuck together even after refrigeration for 15 min as instructed at bottom of recipe. Spreading the filling "dirtied" the cream. My semisweet chips cooled as I was working with them and reheating in microwave did not work for me. I melted a chocolate bar 90% cocoa and this stayed nice and silky. I tried brushing chocolate on Oreo but my brush hardened so I used a baby feeding spoon. I put a few in freezer as I worked on others then assembled. Great idea time consuming...would appreciate some hints...probably my ineptness:-)

I just made these little guys and all I can say is SO SO Cute!! They are lots of fun to put together and the variations are endless (we tried red hots M&Ms and hot tamales for the heads and added orange tic tacs for the feet). SO FESTIVE:)

Update--- my son is now 9 and keeps asking for these each year and we still love sharing them---Tried these for my son's preschool Thanksgiving party. They were a HIT! A few helpful steps... I popped the tails into the refrigerator for around 5 minutes to help the chocolate set before trying to stand them up. I used double stuff Oreos and the thickness of the filling helped hold the feathers up. I also used melted chocolate between the tail portion and the malted milk ball to help support the heavy tails. So easy and fun!

Delightful project. I used double stuft Oreos and the "tail feathers" just stick right in the filling. I cut a slight bit off the side of the PB cup to make it flat and easy to glue/chocolate to the bottom Oreo.

A fun light treat that disappeared quickly around the office (and made a great conversation piece). The backs can be a bit top-heavy due to the candy corn so be sure to have plenty of melted chocolate to attach the "tail" to the bottom of the cookie.

These were so fun and easy to make! I used the Golden Oreo's because I like the taste of those better. I also used the Double Stuff Oreo's to help keep the candy on. Instead of dealing with messy melted chocolate I thought I would try white cupcake icing in the can. It works wonderfully keeps the candy on and matches the Oreo cream. I did the tails first and put them in the fridge for a few minutes while I worked on the body then it was easy to put the tails on after the icing hardened. My son liked to mix n match the feet and used Reese's pieces or cut up Candy corn. These turkeys are so easy and fast and everybody loves them!

Easy! Very cute. I pressed the heavy back down into the melted chocolate and into the cookie filling -- they stayed together with no problem.

I just made these and I have to say they were delicious. 10/10 A. I used mint Oreos instead of regular Oreos and since I'm not a fan of spicy foods I substituted red hots for jelly beans.

I rate these 5 stars for the looks and festiveness this turkey treat provides. They taste good -- not outstanding -- but how can you not like an Oreo? They are fun to make and fun to have at the Thanksgiving table. I used them at each place setting and my guests both young and old loved them. I'm not good at crafts but these were easy and looked so cute. Thanks!

Very cute even though like many reviewers mine didn't turn out perfect like the picture. You still get the general idea. I had trouble finding red hot candy in stores so I just cut off ends of hot tamale candies instead. It worked great! Definitly use the freezer to harden everything before the final two pieces are assembled.

Very cute but time consuming and so tedious. I found you have to hold the tail up until the chocolate dries so it'll go faster if you have someone to help.

I needed to put them in the fridge after putting the candy corns on and before standing them up otherwise they don't stick. That said these are very cool and kids LOVE them.

Tried this today. Really cute buit the back wouldn't stay on. I used Hershey's kisses instead of the malted milk balls because my family doesn't like them. i melted a few of the kisses to make the chocolate. I either didn't use enough chocolate or somethig for attaching. I placed the bottom of the kiss in the melted choc in the pan and then onto the vertical cookie. I am wondering if that's what kept eh cookie from staying up. Anyway I could use more chocolate next time. The melted kisses worked well to hold on the candy corn tho.

This was a great recipe to make with my kids. I didn't find it overly time consuming and I didn't have much problems getting the pieces to stay attached..Just use the melted chocolate generously and press into place! I used sour cherry balls instead of red hots. These tasted great!

I saw these on here and thought they were cute. So our Oreo Turkey were very colorful and also fun to make we had truly got the family involved into making these cute Oreo Turkeys. So to begin we used the regular stuffed Oreos. Instead of using the candy corn we bought a box of Mike and Ike's and use those for the tail feathers. So with the Mike and Ike's we opened the box and separated them according to color. Then we cut them length wise in half. Buy doing this it had given us a flat edge on the one side. (tip: save some whole Mike and Ike's for later as the head) We had also made our Own Chocolate balls with cocoa powder butter and sugar. We then divide our chocolate batter in half and mix in some rum into the chocolate before rolling them into balls. We had half of our Turkey bodies with rum and the other half were plain. We then decided which color Mike and Ike to use for those chocolate balls that had rum. So after making the chocolate balls we started to assemble the Oreo Turkey. I melted some more chocolate on the stove and then poured into a very tiny bowl. This was our Glue. We then used toothpicks to spread the melted chocolate on to the flat side of the Mike and Ike and put that on the front of the Oreo in feather formation (we had four tail feathers and use a different color for each tail feather). We then put the chocolate ball on top of the white creme filling and put the Oreo feathers directly into the Chocolate ball about half way or 3/4 bac
