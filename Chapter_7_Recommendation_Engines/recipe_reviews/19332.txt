Excellent recipe!  Although some previous reviews suggested to double the sauce because there isn't enough, I found  that I would actually need to thicken it with some cornstarch and parmesean cheese because it was too watery (this may have also been because I dumped the wine saute into the pasta when all the meats and veggies were done cooking?). Oh well, I guess it depends on your personal preferences. I also added 1/4 cup of chopped green and red bell peppers and 1/4 cup fresh sliced mushrooms about 1-2 minutes before the chicken was done.  Mmmm good.  My daughter who is 5 years old had THREE helpings.  Two thumbs up LT! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

With a few minor changes, I changed this recipe from a 3 star to a 5 star.  I found the original sauce recipe too thin.  Next time I will make a reux first and then add the milk and cream.  Also I would brown the chicken first in the olive oil and garlic, add a touch of salt, remove from pan and then deglaze with the wine.  When reheating the sauce in the now deglazed pan, I added 1 1/2 cups shredded parmesan cheese which added alot of flavor and texture.

This was so easy and my husband loved it. Next time though I'll use a little less pasta - maybe half the package instead of a full pound. I'll add veggies, too.

This was delicious!!  I used only chicken and omitted the nutmeg--nutmeg with chicken didn't appeal to me at all.  I also reduced the amount of wine to 1/3 of a cup and it was the perfect amount.  Just one note, if you like to soak the sauce up with bread, as my husband does, the amounts called for in this recipe aren't enough.  It just barely coats the pasta.  I doubled the cream sauce and it made the perfect amount.  This one will go in my permanent file!!

This recipe tastes fabulous!  I used fat free Land O' Lakes half & half instead of the heavy whipping cream, which made it thinner (added a little bit of cornstarch, as previous suggested).  I also cooked the chicken in the olive oil before adding the wine (Pink Catawba was all I had).  Didn't bother cooking the shrimp separately since I used a bag of cocktail shrimp instead; I just threw in the de-tailed shrimp, 4 oz mushrooms and 1 1/2 cup broccoli with the chicken.  (Next time I'll use a full 8 oz of mushrooms and 2-3 cups of broccoli.) And I used farfalle since I'm not a huge fan of long stringy pastas.  Added parmesean to the mix--yummy!  I'm sending this one to my mom! (My colleagues all looked jealous of my lunch today.)

My family loved this recipe.  I also doubled the sauce ingredients and used light cream instead of heavy whipping cream.  I had to thicken it slightly with cornstarch.  (2 Tablespoons)

Well I have hung onto this recipe forever and finally decided to make it - I wish I had just left it though!  Just as others have done, I changed the recipe a lot.  I started off by sauteeing the cut up chicken and garlic in some olive oil; meanwhile in a separate pot, I made a roux out of flour and butter.  I added the milk and cream (I wanted to use chicken stock in place of the milk, but I was out).  Once the chicken was nearly done, I deglazed the pan with 1/4 cup of wine and then added the shrimp.  Once the shrimp was cooked, I added a big splash of wine and the white sauce which I'd also added the seasoning to.  We served this over pasta and the end result was a "ok" but not the quality that we're used to eating, we found it bland and boring.  I advise finding a different recipe if you want a chicken/shrimp pasta dish.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I had to make a few changes (chicken stock for the wine) and no shrimp, but it was excellent.  I would use less pasta next time as I had to add more cream so it would not be so dry.

I made this dish with a few modifications as suggested by others. I used 1% milk and fat free half & half to shave calories, with cornstarch to thicken. I cooked the chicken in olive oil and garlic, cooked the shrimp next, then added the wine last. I also added red and green bell peppers to the dish. I also used more seasoning than directed for my family's taste. The dish turned out well.

I found a couple of things problematic with this recipe: (1)the amount of wine added to the chicken resulted in the chicken being boiled in wine; (2)the sauce was more like milk soup and lacked in flavor; (3)1lb of linguine was too much for 4 servings and for the amount of sauce.  I doubled the spice mix, but still needed more flavor.  I added some salt and a touch of thyme and that helped some.

Delicious - i don't have young kids to test it, but, anyone should like it if you like shrimp and garlic.  I didn't use any chicken.

Needed some salt, but otherwise pretty good and very easy. It is very good though. My husband said it would be nice if there was something green in it (spinach or asparagus) and more garlic.

This recipe had no flavor - only milk.  I tried adding more wine and other spices, to no avail.

Used mushrooms instead of chicken and Cajun seasoning in place of cayenne to give it rich more flavor.  Also added some Parmesan to cream as it cooled .

OMG! This recipe is phenomenal!!! Absolutely nothing should be changed or altered. Seriously if you want to impress some folks….JUST MAKE THIS RECIPE EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED! The only suggestion I could possibly offer to the novice such as myself would be to have all prepped before you even look at the stove. I’ve been borrowing recipes from this site for years, and in my humble opinion this recipe is a gift from a Pro or a Pro to Be! ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE EDIBLES!!!!!
