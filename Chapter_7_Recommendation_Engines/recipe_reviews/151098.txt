Different, but good - I wasn't sure about the basil at first but it worked well as a side dish for a more "Italian" based dinner that needed mashed potatoes to go with it.  These were creamy and had a nice herbed flavor.

Very good recipe! The flavor was very good. Not overpowering, just a yummy background. The only changes I made were to use fresh minced garlic rather than the powder, plus I added about 1/2 tsp. of horseradish. Since smooth, non-lumpy mashed potatoes are a sacrilege in our house, I combined the ingredients in a bowl, plopped them on top of the hot cooked potatoes and hand mashed. This one's going in my cookbook for regular rotation. Thanks for sharing it!

Excellent receipie!!!!!   I added 1/3 cup milk since I thought it was too thick without it.  I also added Ground Red Cayenne Pepper for a little kick.  It leaves a good after taste!! But I think that papirka would be just as good. Made this for my wife on Mother's Day!  She loved it with meatloaf and turnip greens, which I also cooked for her on her day!  I also drizzled butter over the top of them to accent the flavor, with pepper.

Except for the addition of the basil this is a more or less typical way of preparing mashed potatoes.  The basil was an interesting addition, tasty but "safe" in that it didn't result in an extraordinary departure from your basic mashed potatoes.

I liked the slightly unique taste of these mashed potatoes.  I added some extra garlic and used seasoned salt.  I also put in a few splashes of milk to make them more smooth.

This recipe is easy, practical, and delicious. No shopping for special, crazily expensive items you'll never use again. :-) Plus, everyone gobbles down garlic mashed potatoes. It's up there with deviled eggs, but of course the amounts of each ingredient have to be right to taste right. This recipe is a beautiful combination of delicious and simple.

I followed the directions exactly. Everyone in my family seemed to like them - even the 1 year old who is usually not a fan of potatoes! Used Russet potatoes.

So good but I did have to add milk as it was just a bit too thick. I used fresh basil instead so I needed to add just a little more. Very different and such a nice change from the norm. Thank you Deana!

I thought these were rather good and different from plain mashed potatoes.  I did add a little liquid while mashing because I found them a little dry.  They had great flavor!

Instead of garlic powder, I used minced garlic instead. Husband enjoyed the difference of the basil. This is a keeper.

I wanted to give this a try since it had so many good reviews.  I would give it 5 stars for creaminess and texture!  The taste didn't do too much for me, tho.  I could only taste the basil and no garlic.  I will add that the basil wasn't overpowering at all.  Very subtle.  I don't think I'll make these again as written.  Maybe I'll nix the basil and add more garlic and maybe some ranch.

These are great!  The basil really gives it a different flavor.  I would never have thought to add it.  I doubled the recipe and therefore doubled the all ingredients.  I think the basil was a bit strong doubled so I will adjust to a little less basil next time.  I also added a tad of light cream to fluff and lighten the potatoes.  Will definitely do these again!!!

These were very creamy and full of flavor. I had to add a splash of milk as they were waay too thick otherwise. My potatoes were done in 15 minutes and I used a potato masher as usual and lots of freshly ground black pepper. Thanks it was a nice change from plain mashed potatoes.

My family loved these. I did increase the garlic powder to 1 teaspoon and I used fat free cream cheese and organic red potatoes. They ate every bite. I served these with my own custom version of Reunion Meatballs. Next time, I think I'll roast the potatoes instead. I like the flavor better.

Excellent recipe. My variation is to boil the potatoes with the garlic powder in the water, which makes the taste penetrate very well. Can be additionally seasoned if necessary.

I didnt care for these too much.  It was too much basil and i think i added a little too much pepper.  I used a 1/4 tsp pepper.  I probably wont make again.

OMG, the best mashed potatoes ever! I substituted fresh basil and a lot of fresh garlic because that's how we roll and it was AMAZING!!! I would not make ahead as it will dry out. Make it right before and serve!

These potatoes were amazing!  Even my step son, who is not a big mashed potato fan, raved about them.  I  did add a little milk to make them creamier.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. This is definitely how I will be making mashed potatoes from now on.  Thanks for the recipe!

These potatoes were ok. Not bad. Not great. It just tasted like they were missing something.

I did change a few things and they turned out great. I never thought that basil would be good but it added a little sweetness. I added some onion powder unsalted butter and the rest of the ingredients. I did have to add salt and pepper for taste it was blend. I will make this again. Thanks Trixie B

I added chopped prior frozen spinach and mozzarella cheese.  Added grilled sausage and the side.  Yummy! The kids never even noticed the spinach, so creamy with a crispy crust!

The taste of basil was too powerful, and did not blend well

Very good mashed potatoes; I really enjoyed the basil in this but had to double the garlic powder to suit my tastes. Dried basil worked fine but I think this would be even better with fresh basil in the summer. Good side for an italian style meal. Thanks for sharing!
