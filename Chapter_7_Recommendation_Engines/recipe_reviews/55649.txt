This recipe turned out good. I had to use twice as much corn starch to make it the right consistancy. I would recommend using only a pinch of nutmeg (it was a little too strong). I also used more prosciutto which I would not recommend since it has such an overpowering flavor. Overall a good recipe.

My husband and father-in-law enjoyed this recipe.
I will be making this recipe again and maybe add some onion to the mix.
