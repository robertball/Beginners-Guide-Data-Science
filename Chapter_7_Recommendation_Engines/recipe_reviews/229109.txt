Easy, cheap and yummy.  Had great effect and the kids loved it.  Love that it has few ingredients.  So easy to put together yet has such wow factor.

Made this for the school party last year (multi age). The kids  who were in the class last year have told the new kids about it, but won't give away the secret of what it is. Of course, I'm making it again this year. They loved it!

Looks spooky when made!  The combo of the three ingredients made the punch bubble up soooo much, it really looked like scum.
