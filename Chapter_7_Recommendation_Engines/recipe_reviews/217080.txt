Incredible! I always try the recipes "as is"at first. Although I made it as the recipe instructed I put a pack of Lipton Onion Soup Mix by accident because i usually make my meatloaf that way. The taste was awesome and the meatloaf was melt-in-your-mouth.

Fantastic!  We accidentally mixed the brown sugar and mustard into the meat mixture, but it gave it a great flavor and was delicious!

I've never made meat loaf before and decided to try this recipe. So glad I tried this one for my first time! It is simple and delicious. I wouldn't change a thing about it.

This is my favorite meatloaf recipe, so moist and flavorful. It has the perfect ratio of wet to dry ingredients. I made just a couple of changes: omitted the sage, salt, and pepper, used italian seasoned breadcrumbs, and added about half of a packet of lipton onion/mushroom soup mix.  I also leave out the dry mustard powder for the topping.  I let sit for 10 minutes after cooking before slicing so all of the juices can redistribute.  I serve this with mashed potatoes and gravy.

This was a huge hit here. I used canned milk, fresh bread, 2 T dried minced onion, Season All, and added the ketchup glaze from the start. I baked this for a little over an hour and it came out perfectly. My husband remarked how this was the perfect texture for sandwiches (and he loves meatloaf sandwiches) so it is a man pleaser. No dicing, no chopping, and delicious. Thanks Beth!

Finally a great meatloaf recipe! I didn't substitute or leave out any ingredient and it was full of flavor. I especially liked the ketchup glaze on top. Hubby loved it!

This was pretty good. Wish I would have reserved some of the sauce to eat with the meatloaf as a dip instead of ketchup.

Thanks much, This is a very good meat loaf recipe, I adjusted a little -- never could cook anything as is.  Added fresh local green pepper, replaced ketchup based sauce with some local home made spiced apple jelly, add grey poupon mustard and a little red wine vinegar, followed the recipe and put on last 10 minutes of cooking. (after draining the grease)

Excellent recipe! Quick, easy and delicious. I also add a can of tomato soup to the ketchup to increase the amount a sauce for spooning over the meatloaf when serving.

Great meatloaf. Simple - perfect for my picky eaters. Substituted 1/2 pkg of onion soup mix for the onions and skipped the sage. Used 1.25 lb of lean ground beef and .25 lb of chuck.

perfect - my family rave about this one - it is right up at the top of the list of family dinners. I add whatever herbs I have - today whizzed up parsley, garlic and celery eaves instead of sage. I also whizz the onion in the processor so you don't get any big bits. Thanks for the recipe

We all liked this recipe very much as a base.  I doctored it of course.  I added a lb of ground pork as well as two grated carrots and used a bit more salt and pepper because of the added meat.  It also required more cooking time, due to the extra meat, but the basic flavor with the sage seasoning was delicious.  The topping was perfect too...I did add a wee shake of Worcestershire sauce to the topping sauce.  I will make this recipe again.

Beth's Meatloaf Haiku: "This was way too wet, but the taste was really good. It just fell apart." I made it exactly as written other than adding a little garlic powder, and I really questioned the dry-to-wet ratio in this, but continued on w/ the 3/4 c. milk and the 1/2 c. breadcrumbs. The meat slurry was really wet going into the 9X5 pan, and upon removing it at 50 min. to put on the glaze, was swimming in grease (which I drained.) After the last 10 min., I let it sit at room temp for an additional 15 min. to let the juices settle in the hopes that it would slice nicely, but alas, it fell apart. My daughter and husband loved the taste of it, the baby went crazy on it too (perfect texture for her!), but we all agreed that even though the taste was good, the squishy factor wasn't.

Did add table spoon of worchestershire/half green pepper/1/4 cup of sweet baby rays. Mixed all the ingredients with the burger put in oven for 45 minutes then placed six slices of cooked bacon and ketchup on top, put back in the oven 400 degrees for 15 minutes. Added the things Mom always put in. Should have tried the original but couldn't help myself. Thanks for the jump start to a great meatloaf.

I used italian-seasoned bread crumbs, cut back on the salt by half and added in a few more spices (onion powder, garlic powder, italian seasoning). I made no other changes. I baked this in my Perfect Meat Loaf Pan--my meat loaf took almost two hours to cook fully. Very quick meat loaf recipe that my family inhaled. I paired this with Ali's Potato Casserole and steamed broccoli. This made enough for one dinner and two sandwiches for lunches this morning.

I doubled the recipe, and used half for meatloaf and half for meatballs.  The meatballs cooked at 350 degrees for 15 minutes.  Great! Made a mistake with the onion, and used the whole thing.  Tasty!  Had no black pepper, so used 2 TB of Frank's hot sauce.  Can't taste it, either way.  The mix was squishy, and kept pulling my rubber gloves off while I formed the meat balls or pressed the meatloaf into its pan (can't bear to touch raw meat with my bare hands!). Next time I make this, I will put the sauce on at the 40 minute mark so it stays moist. 
 July, 2019-  I've made this recipe many times.  When I don't have dry bread crumbs, I use torn up fresh bread pieces.  When I don't have dried sage, I use a TB of chopped fresh sage from the garden.  When I'm out of black pepper I also use crushed red pepper.  I don't make the sauce.  No sense making a sweet sauce for a savory meatloaf.

This meatloaf was delicious - tasty and moist. I am not typically in favor of ketchup on the top but the mix of ketchup, mustard and brown sugar was terrific - added a nice layer of flavor to the top edge. I always double recipes so I have leftovers for the week. Was glad I did - my boys loved it!

Yes I made it.  For 2 meat loaf haters (I love it).  Because I couldn't find my bread crumbs, I added Pepperidge Farm Stuffing Mix  (3/4 cup).  I also only used half of the topping.
The "haters" liked it and said I could serve it again.

I used a Tblsp. of dried minced onion only because I prefer them in meatloaf, and I used italian bread crumbs. I left the brown sugar out of the topping because I'm trying to avoid it. I  was a little nervous about using an entire teaspoon of black pepper but really liked the taste of it with the sage. I've used the same recipe for many years now, but this is my new go-to recipe...loved it!

This is pretty good meatloaf.  I substituted these:  crushed pork finds for breadcrumbs, Half and half for milk, Stevia for brown sugar (I am on a no-carbs no sugar diet), no-sugar-added Ketchup and I used dried chopped onions instead of fresh chopped onions.  It takes 50 minutes for the internal temperature to reach 160*F.  Without the brown sugar the ketchup mixture won't brown or get crusty but it's still good with Stevia.  I ate four slices out of a bread pan and I used parchment paper to line the bread pan so the meatloaf wouldn't stick to the bread pan.  It is fairly bland after being in the refrigerator overnight and not heating it up again and eating it cold but it's still good.  It is not a stick-in-the-throat meatloaf.  I think it might be better to use a little bit more salt and pepper for the refrigerated version early in the morning for breakfast but salt and pepper can be added after the meatloaf has been cooked.  Enjoy.

I used cubed bread instead of crumbs and added just a pinch more sage. I cooked it in hamburger patty fashion. Great idea when too hot for the oven.

Love this recipe!  Added 1/2 tsp each of white pepper, tsp basil & onion salt. For the topping 1/4 cup each of ketchup & chili sauce. With the onions added tbsp each minced Anaheim pepper & green pepper. Gives a hint of spice that opened the flavors up without too much heat.

This is the recipe I’ve used for years.  It’s in an older edition of a Better Homes and Gardens cookbook from the 70’s.  I came to this site to find a new recipe in case there was anything better than the one we’ve loved for years.  But when I saw my classic BHG recipe rated so highly, I decided not to look for anything new and different.

After trying several recipes for a basic meatloaf, this one was spot on.  I agree with other reviewers that it's a little "juicer" than we'd prefer when done, but it doesn't affect the flavor.  I use oats instead of bread crumbs (food allergies), so I'll be adding 1 or more cups next time instead of 1/2 a cup.  We don't like the ketchup on top, so we add it in before cooking, and instead top it with bacon.

I made it tonight for me and me husband and we loved it. I did make one change.  I used half sweet Italian sausage, half hamburger.  It added that little bit of moisture we prefer. Thank you for sharing it for me and others to use. It was wonderful.

Very tasty. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, and it needed about 25 extra minutes of cooking time. I also added a packet of onion soup mix in place of the onion, and added about 3 tablespoons of worstershire. Next time I will double the sauce recipe so we will have extra for dipping because it was so good!

I made this recipe with only a couple of changes.  We live in our RV, so storage is at a premium.  I didn't want to buy 2 lbs of brown sugar to use  such a small amount, and my wife and I don't care for sage, so these were left out.  The meatloaf was wonderful!  We had dinner  with seconds of meatloaf, and I caught my wife picking at the left overs.  I will definitely be making this again!   Sorry, I forgot.  I also reduced the hamburger to .75 lb and added .75 ground pork.

I made the recipe with 1 cup of fresh torn bread bits because I had no dried bread crumbs.  I used a pinch of home dried sage leaves from my garden and rubbed them with my hands over the meat mixture.  It was about a tsp of sage.  Then I froze the meat in the loaf pan that I will bake it in later.  After we eat it, I will rate the recipe.

Update:  This was delicious.  We thawed the  meatloaf in the fridge over night, baked it at 350 for an hour, omitted the sugar glaze, used a 75/25 ground beef (high fat).  It was juicy, but a little too salty for our taste, so we will cut the salt to 1/2 tsp next time.

This is the recipe my husband approved after experimenting for the first 6 years of our marriage and which still is our favorite after an additional 40 years.  I  add a dash of nutmeg to the topping.

Im not big on ground beef, so we did 1 pound kf pork and 1 pound of beef. I had to strain the loaf before adding the sauce. Honestly, I have never liked meatloaf, but this recipe changed my mind! My kids and boyfriend just gobbled it up!!!

EXCELLENT and very tasty recipe. The only thing that I would and did change is to double the ketchup and brown sugar topping. The amount in the recipe is sufficient, but I wanted my topping to run down the side. I like lots of sauce. Lots more sauce also goes well pouring over the side dish of either mashed potatoes or rice.

Well, this is really Better Homes and Gardens EXACT recipe, which is why it's the best. Please, for all that is good in the world, do not alter it by adding Onion Soup mix (it doesn't deserve to be downgraded like that) and please don't add Cream of Anything soup to it.  
The only acceptable alteration would be using Italian bread crumbs instead of plain. Adds without changing.
Carry on.....

A good basic meatloaf recipe and so easy to throw together. Have made this several times. Sometimes I use dried chopped onion instead of fresh for even more time savings.  Have been making meatloaf forever for the meatloaf lovers in my life and this  recipe is one that I, not a meatloaf fan, can actually enjoy.

I have this recipe in the oven as I write this review.. I hope it tastes better than it looks. I followed the recipe exactly except I used 2 pounds of meat. The milk/ egg mixture was far too much liquid. i would suggest cutting the milk in half based on pre- cooked appearance but will see what it actually tastes like when done..

This is almost exactly my  recipe, and it's a huge hit at my house.  I don't use sage, but I use Italian bread crumbs.    Served up with mashed potatoes and a great beef mushroom gravy I got from Rachel Ray, it's hard to beat.  When my youngest was in college, I'd ask him what 'home cooking' I should bring down when I was visiting, and it always 'Meatloaf!'

We loved this.  Very similar to what I grew up with including the topping although my mom's recipe calls for Nutmeg in the topping.   Left off topping because my husband doesn't like.  I made my own bread crumbs by toasting bread and running in the blender.  Added more bread crumbs after reading reviews that it was too wet and I had already put in all the milk.  Had to cook much longer but sometimes I wonder if that isn't my oven.   I turned up heat and cooked until they temped at 160.  I think ground black pepper is key - Use the whole amount.   Everyone LOVED.  Thank you for recipe!  (Ooops, I left out sage because I didn't have any)

I never tried making meatloaf because I thought I didn't like it. However, this recipe turned out really tasty and was surprisingly simply. I added half a block of soft tofu with the ground meat to fluff it up a bit, and had to substitute rosemary and thyme because I didn't have sage. I can imagine making other minor variations using this as the base recipe.

In one word-WOW!  I am pleasantly surprised at how delicious it came out and with minimal prep effort.  The sauce compliments the meat very well.  I didn’t alter the recipe as I believe that making something for the first time should be made as is then adjust accordingly.  I give it 2 thumbs up!

This is so good. I didn't have the sage so used a little Italian seasoning. Otherwise made as written. Doesn't fall apart but still nice and moist. Thanks so much.

The simplicity was nice but adding the topping until 10 minutes before finishing cooking is weird. I tried it exactly just to make sure all those years of doing things differently were wrong but...the end result of this one was weird. The toppings wasn't at all integrated into the loaf and just sat in top and  I just don't see the point. Won't be trying again.

I am not much for meat loaf - never have been but wanted something different for dinner.  This was surprisingly good. I think it's the sage that makes the difference. Made it exactly as recipe called for. Very, very good. I think this is only the second recipe I've commented on . . .it was that good.

This was delish. I didn't have bread crumbs so used dry stuffing. I skipped the ketchup topping since I don't like ketchup and it was great without.

I made the recipe as is...no additions which I like to do .
The meat loaf was moist and delicious with good flavor.
This is a simple recipe with basic ingredients that will not disappoint. If you want a good basic meat loaf recipe this is it.

Liked adding sage to the recipe.  Figure the next time I make this I am going to have to double up the recipe since usually I have enough left over to make sandwiches.  That didn't happen this time.

I just made this recipe without reading any of the reviews.
I didn't add the milk as it wasn't necessary.  Also omitted the sage as we dislike that flavour.  Used just one egg and a cup of  bread crumbs.  Only 1/4 tsp salt  & pepper used.  This meatloaf  was delicious.  My only complaint was that it was  too sweet.  Next  time I'll use only 1 tbs. brown sugar.

Meatloaf itself made to the recipe, though cut salt in half.  Glaze adjusted to better suit my family's taste (reduced ketchup for honey bbq sauce).  Came out great, and already looking forward to eating the leftovers!  Will definitely make again.

My husband has Crohn's disease, so we have to leave out a few of the ingredients (onion and pepper), but even without those, this meat loaf is delicious.  We rate it #1 in comfort food.

Wow, delicious.  I've made this twice, once with 1/2# ground turkey.   One change:  I wait to spread on the topping til about half way thru cooking time.  I could be wrong, but when previous meatloaves are sometimes pink inside, I think its because the topping has seeped down into meat.  So with the wait,  it doesn't happen.  .  . At least so far.

Loved it, being a chef I changed a few things, used three eggs, and added a dash of pickle juice and instead of bread crumbs I used a whole pack of saltines crushed. For the sauce I added Dijon mustard about two table spoons and about an 1/8 cup dill juice. Cocked for the recommended time then 14 min. Under the broiler then added sauce mix and another 5 min. Under broiler. Was magnificent!!!

I made this tonight.  My wife, a very picky eater, quite liked it as did I.  I did it per the recipe except I used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs and put a bit more brown sugar in the topping.  This I will be making again.

This is the first time ever for me making meat loaf. The only thing I changed is the sauce Instead of the original  I put 3 teaspoons of brown sugar. Thank you very much for sharing this incredible recipe. :)

made it with 1 lbs of ground buffalo, but didn't double the other ingredients.  It came out perfectly.  We'll add this to our regular menu.

This is the way my Mom used to make it.  I made it exactly as written.  On a side note, I prepared everything early in the day when the timing was more convenient for me, covered the meatloaf and the bowl of topping and kept it in the refrigerator until I was ready to put it in the oven.  Then all I had to do was put it in the oven!  Of course I had to make the sides too (instant mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts) but they went pretty easy.

This recipe is SUPER yummy! I wanted to cut back on the sugar (since there is already sugar in a lot of ketchup brands) so I actually only used 1 tablespoon of brown sugar, and it still came out delicious. I think next time I'll broil it or move it closer to the top of the over during the last 10 minutes after the sauce is applied because portions of the meatloaf that caramelized were extra good! I served this with oven roasted brussel sprouts and my boyfriend had 4 servings.

Very, very good. Used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of plain, added a packet of onion soup mix and reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp. Really liked the sage.

This recipe changed my mind about meatloaf!  If mustard is not a desirable, I have substituted my favorite barbecue sauce for the Ketchup mixture.  This reheats well, I make a 3lb meat loaf and we use it for a quick meal when we have to run off to the kids events.

My first attempt at meatloaf and even reheated it was awesome.  I ended up not having the right amount of burger but still turned out good.

Instead of dry mustard used dijon mustard with a little lawry's seasoned salt mixed in. Original receipe great, just  put a little "twist" to it.

The taste of this is really nice, but I don't use the 3/4 cup of milk. I did the first time I made it and it was way too much in my opinion, too mushy. The next time only used about 1/4 cup. That worked out much better. I always sneak in some extra nutrition by adding green pepper and carrot ground up in the food processor. No one is the wiser!

My 14 year old son told me this was the best meatloaf I've ever made! :) The rest of the family nodded while stuffing their mouths with more ;) I modified the recipe to my Paleo diet by subsituting the breadcrumbs with coconut flour, used almond milk instead of dairy, and honey instead of sugar. Everuthing else I followed to the T and it was AMAZING! (I actually froze my loaf uncooked, so all I had to do was defrost in the sink and cook it after work...Perfection!)

I had made this once before and liked it. I just made it again and changed the ketchup to a Barbeque Sauce. I think it gives it a little more zip.
