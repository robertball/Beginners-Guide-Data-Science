Love this soup! It is delicious and the garlic is healing. I've made it with beef, chicken and veggie broth and it is wonderful with any of the three. I never add any more salt, but I do usually add a bit more garlic. Overall a staple in our household. Especially when someone isn't feeling well. Thanks!

I burned the rice (not enough water for the rice) and 8 cups of beef stock was way too much. It looks nice  on the original picture and I was curious (love soups).

BEST soup I have made in a long time!  Was thinking chicken broth would be preferable to beef broth but no.    Also used fire roasted tomatoes in the preparation which I think helped.  Salt and pepper liberally.  YUM! :)
