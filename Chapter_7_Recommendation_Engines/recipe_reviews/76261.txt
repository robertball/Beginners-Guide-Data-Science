Very good recipe - I substituted 1/2c applesauce and 1/2c yogurt for the oil and the recipe was still superb. Very chewey and satisfying low-fat delight.

I always make cookies in 1/2 recipes.  because my husband (a diabetic) and I happen to like fresh cookies. So I make enough for just a few days. I found the oats proportions to be fine I used "Silver Palate" Oats which are high quality (afterall, these are adult cookies).  My hubby also has high cholesterol so I use a stick of regular "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" instead. (In any recipe, I just omit any additional salt because, ICBINB unfortunately is pre-salted)  I don't bother with the hand blender I just use a wooden spoon and a big bowl and break up the butter as I add more "wet" ingredients to the bowl.  Even as I add the flour mixture if I have any leftover chunks of butter I try to flatten them with the wooden spoon on the sides of the bowl as I mix. Next time I'll try to lighten up on the Splenda blend by 1/4c as we found them a bit oversweet. When you have really good quality Oats, you want to taste them and not sugar.  The texture was wonderfully chewy inside and slightly crisp outside.

Good cookie, can't tell it's sugar free as with most Splenda recipes.  I didn't realize I was out of molasses until I was halfway through the recipe, so in a pinch I used about 1/2 tablespoon maple syrup, and they came out just fine.  My first sheet of cookies were a little crumbly, so with the rest I rolled them into balls and flattened them before baking.

Surprisingly good though it doesn't taste like a "real" oatmeal cookie.  Lacking a bit on flavor; I think next time I will add more spices like 1/8 tsp each of cardamon and mace, or maybe cloves and allspice. My only other note is I thought 3 cups of oats was too much.

Cookies had a very good flavor, but didn't spread out or raise?  Not sure why.  They just stayed in the basic dough ball shape.  DH ate them anyway and loved them.  I tried the recipe again, only I used 1 c. regular splenda (not the blend) and 1/2c of sugar free syrup.  I also added 1/2 c. whole wheat flour, doubled the molasses and used 3 large eggs.  This time they were AMAZING!!!  The dough balls turned into perfect cookes, crispy outside, chewy inside.  With the modifications, I'll make these again.  I'm going to try using agave nectar or brown rice syrup the next time.

My husband loves oatmeal raisin cookies and I decided I had to try this one.  I too made some changes after reading other reviews.  I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine.  I didn't have old fashioned oats so used reg. oatmeal (used all 3 1/2 c.), and I used 1/2 c. of wheat instead of all white flour. Baked them for 11 min.  Next time would like to try them with all Splenda (not the blend) and use another 1/2 tsp. of soda.  They came out chewy and great tasting.  Oh, yes, my husband said they were very good.

My husband and I were amazed at the wonderful flavor of these cookies! This was the first time I have ever used Splenda Blend. I am actually making a second batch as I write this. Yummy!

Was actually disappointed by this recipe, after reading all the good reviews it got.  I found the cookie to be rather tasteless and dry.  I've cooked with Splenda many, many times with other recipes with success, but I don't think I'll use this one again...

Sorry, guys!  Just had to put in my two cents worth... :(

This is a great recipe. I have made it twice so far for my father, who is a diabetic.  My 5 and 9 year old nieces even liked them...they ate most of them! I agree that 3 cups of oats is a little much, and I personally perfer more raisins.  I added about 3/4 of a cup more than called for.  Overall a great cookie!

I just finished baking these and they are perfect!  I made adjustments and used whole wheat graham flour, added just a little bit more butter,  imitation honey and 3/4 C splenda sugar blend and 1/4 C splenda brown sugar. I also cut the oats by 1/2 C.  They are moist, delicious and I will be making these again soon!

I think this recipe is a bit too sweet. I would recommend use only 3/4 cup of sugar. The other thing is that the cookie is not chewy rather the texture came out like cake. But the taste is good.

These are really tasty cookies!  I adjusted the recipe as follows:  used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all-purpose flour and used 3/4 c Splenda Blend and 1/4 c Splenda Brown Sugar Blend.  Also added maybe 1/3 c extra raisins, plumped in hot water.

My batch came out really moist - no crumbling at all, very much like a traditional cookie batter.  Husband who loves oatmeal raising cookies approves!

I wanted oatmeal raison cookies and looked for a low cal,sugar free. This is good! In place of flour, I used whole wheat. In place of molasses I used Carey's sugar free maple syrup. (1 tsp) 
I also softened the raisins in hot water. 
If you like oatmeal, this is the one!

I made these cookies twice.. first time, i followed the tips here, i lessened the oatmeal by 1/2 cup, i added more butter, and used ordinary raisins (which i plumped using hot water).. i baked it in 330degrees F for about 15-17mins. The cookies tasted bland, it was dry and crumbly.

The 2nd time i made this, i retained the quantity of oatmeal, i added about 1/2 cup more raisins (which i plumped for a few mins using pineapple juice). I added abt a tsp. of cinnamon and 1 tsp molasses, 1 tsp vanilla, and a bit more butter.. i baked it 325degrees for about 15 mins, it was a lot more delicious! :) the cookies were soft and not as dry.. By the way, I substituted the recipe with 1 cup Splenda no-calorie Granulated and about 3/4cup sugar...  (the original recipe calls for 1 cup Splenda Sugar blend which is twice as sweet as sugar.. so i just thought I should substitute it with 2 cups sugar or its equivalent) :) it's really good! and the plumping of raisins with pineapple juice really highlighted the taste of the raisins :)

I love this cookie.  The first batch I made turned out a bit dry so I increased the butter/margarine by about 1/4-1/2 of a stick.  This really made the difference.  I also used 100% whole wheat flour.  This past weekend I have made 3 batches!! The last batch I subsituted dries cranberries real good but I like them made with the raisins better.  This recipe is a winner!!

Since finding out my husband was diabetic we have looked in all the grocery stores for a cookie that he could eat.  We had no luck at all.  The ones we did find tasted like cardboard.  Finding this recipe and it turning out to be wonderful has been so nice.  I give it a five star.

My husband is diabetic and before Splenda, I was at a loss when it came to cooking or baking things he actually would like.  This cookie recipe he really likes so I'm sure I'll make it over and over again.  I made a couple of changes to make it even more 'healthy'.  Instead of all-purpose flour, I used whole wheat flour and instead of 1 cup butter, I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup "Smart Balance", a good source I think for adding Omega-3s in your diet.

The overall texture was a little crumbly and I had to roll them into a ball and flatten a little just prior to baking, but we loved them.  We thought the taste was excellent.  Even my picky daughter-in-law, wife of the diabetic son thought they were good!!  A little heavy on oats, but that is not bad!  Will definitely make this again and add it to my recipe collection.

Good taste but might be better as a muffin since it is kind of cakey.  I added 1/2 cup of applesauce and cut the oatmeal back.  I think next time I will put double the cinnamon, add nuts and bake them in cupcake tins.  Pretty good snack for someone who loves sweets but cannot have sugar.

While I did not like this one....molasses to strong for me...my husband loved it and since he is the diabetic I will make them again...I used splenda no calorie sweetner, granular and king arthur white whole wheat flour as he cannot tolerate the white flour due to his sugar levels.

We have been watching our sons sugar intake and were in need of a tasty, kid friendly recipe. I changed this recipe slightly and he loves them.  The end result for me was a good cookie that is a bit cakey. I used whole wheat flour in place of all purpose added an extra tsp of cinnamon, and used stick I can't believe its not butter. Increased the vanilla to 2 tsp and decreased the oats by 1/2 cup as many had suggested.

Best homemade oatmeal raisin cookie I've ever had or made!  My boyfriend (non-diabetic, loves sweets) and mother (diabetic) were raving about these cookies and asking me right after I had made them both a huge batch when would I make more.  Like some I used the I Can't Believe It's Not Butter and added a little more cinnamon.  The molasses makes these cookies a true hit!  EXCELLENT!

A bit diappointing. Made these with 1/2 cup Splenda granular and 1/2 cup of sugar (as that's what Splenda Baking Blend is when I read the package). Found it to be a bit dry. Thought the molasses would give it some better flavor but it didn't. Maybe it needs molasses and brown sugar or Splenda brown sugar???

Pretty good cookie overall.  I lowered the amount of oats by half a cup since 3 cups seemed like too much and added more cinnamon.  Still seemed like it was missing something.  I also had to lower the oven temp. to 335 since the bottoms were burning.After that they turned out nice and big.

Pretty good cookies.  Having hard time finding an oatmeal cookie that isn't dry.  This is the best one I found so far.  Will still search - it has to be out there.  Thanks!

These are absolutely delicious.  I honestly liked them better than oatmeal cookies made with "real" sugar.
