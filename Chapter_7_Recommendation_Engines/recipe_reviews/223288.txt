This pie was delicious! Everyone enjoyed it. I would suggest doubling the recipe for the crust as this only made enough for the bottom, and I had to make more for the top.

potato crust was really difficult to manipulate.  Hard to get it thin, because a little potato flour goes a long way taste-wise.  I used butter instead and it browned nicely.  I also used our gooseberries and this was a first for me.   in the future, if that ever comes, I will cook them a bit and add more sugar.   My filling was quite tart.

I'm not happy with this recipe. The crust does not hold together, so I had to press half into the pie pan and crumble the other half on top, which looks bad. And without any sugar in the crust, it doesn't brown. Finally, I have been baking it at 375 degrees for 1.5 hours and it finally is starting to bubble.
