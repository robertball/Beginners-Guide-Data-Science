Very Quick and good. If you like gravy, you will luv this recipe. I changed the servings to 3 for my husband and I and it was plenty. Even some left for lunch today:)

This was delicious.  I used all the left overs from St. Paddy's Day.  I layered the cabbage and chopped corned beef.  Additionally, I added the carrots and potatoes (I diced them) I had with our corned beef.  Everything was layered cold and then I made the sauce as directed, poured it over the top of the casserole and heated it up. It was the the bomb-ditty!

I had made a corner beef on stove top 2 days ago. Tonight I searched  for a recipe and found this one. I weighted out 24 ozs of corned beef instead on using canned. I followed it exactly but added no salt. I did add a small amount of better than bouline beef flavor. The gravy had good flavor. Both my husband and I loved it and had seconds.I will make this again

Okay I don't usually rate anything because I rarely make anything without reading the reviews and making changes but this is an amazing idea. I love corned beef and cabbage out of the crock pot but always have lots of leftovers because I do corned beef, cabbage, carrots & potato's that being said I just took everything out of the crock pot and put in a strainer then chopped the corned beef and transferred to a casserole dish coated with cooking spray. I made the topping as stated and put in the oven the next night and it was totally awesome!! Thank you for the idea!! :-)

My husband's favorite dish.  It helps to drain the cabbage as much as you can.  The gravy adds a great topping to the regular corned beef and cabbage dish.

I want to try this recipe and I want to get spuds into the dish. So, I am thinking of sliced potatoes either on top of the cabbage layer or on the beef layer. It would be nice if they cooked from raw rather than having to pre-cook or par cook the spuds. Mashing adds another step and this recipe is about convenience. Might want to add some mustard or curry spice to the béchamel.

While it wasn't bad, my family thought it a little bland.  Quick and easy, but needs something...
