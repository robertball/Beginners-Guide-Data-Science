With hubs out Christmas shopping it was just me at home for supper tonight. I had presents to wrap and baking to do, so I wanted something simple but delicious, something more interesting than the plain ol' grilled cheese sandwich I almost settled for.  Hoping for a twist on that old standby, this recipe came up with a simple search for "grilled cheese sandwich" and what a great find it was!  The ingredients seem like such a natural, yet I never would have thought to put them together in a grilled cheese sandwich.  I really liked this - the flavors all come together and  using good, sturdy Italian bread really helps make the sandwich. This was a quick and delicious meal with ingredients I readily have on hand.  No boring grilled cheese sandwich here!

This was delicious! I just used what I had on hand: pesto, wheat bread, sungold tomatoes, mozarella and goat cheese. I have tried it both fried and in the toaster oven (without the butter). Both are great!

This is an amazing sandwich!  I made it using the "Pesto" recipe submitted by anderval and also didn't have any American cheese on hand, so used some shredded cheddar cheese instead.  I also served this with "Rachel's Tomato Basil Soup" recipe on this site.  This meal was something like I would expect to get in a fancy bistro .... I can't wait for lunch today so I can have more!

I used what I had on hand. Wheat bread, provolone, tomatoes and fresh basil. Grilled without butter on a tabletop grill. Yummy! Next time I will try it with pesto but it was really good and healthy the way it was.

what a nice variation on a grilled cheese sandwich.  I don't have provolone cheese so I left that out and put in some sliced chicken instead.  I love adding tomato to grilled cheese so any recipe that does gets a second look by me!  I had sun dried tomato pesto in the fridge, so that's what I used, and I put it on olive bread.  Very nice!  Thanks for the recipe!

I literally just got done eating this--and let me tell you...YUM. I did everything as is, except added an extra slice of each kind of cheese. Next time I will likely omit the American cheese, as I found its flavor to be dominant...and though that was still delicious, I would like the pesto and provolone flavors to be more apparent. It was quick, easy and worth it!

Wonderful. A nice variation to grilled cheese; easy; tasty  I put mozza instead of american cheese.  I had some extra pesto and provolone from another recipe so this is great! THanks

These are fantastic sandwiches.  The only change I made was to add some thinly sliced red onion which makes it even better.

We actually make these quite frequently, but never with the addition of American cheese. We usually stick with the provolone by itself, adding mozzarella or swiss depending on what we have on hand. Excellent when you have leftover chicken breast, fresh basil, or spinach leaves either fresh or quick sauteed with garlic, ....mmmm....I'm hungry just thinking about it!

I always have some kind of homemade pesto on hand, and I've also used it on grilled cheese sandwiches.  I make traditional pesto with basil and pine nuts, spinach pesto with walnuts, artichoke pesto with hazelnuts - all include garlic and whatever good oil and cheese I have at the moment.  My favorite Grilled Cheese was spinach and walnut pesto with Fontinella cheese, garden tomatoes and applewood bacon.  Pesto on grilled cheese is simply yummy!

Does not need american cheese at all.  Only put Pesto on one slice of bread because it overpowers everything otherwise.

Wow, this sandwich came out so good! I bought a loaf of Panera Bread especially for this recipe, I used fresh mozzarella instead of Provolone and American cheeses and I made my own pesto sauce (Spinach Basil Pesto) from this site.

This was the best grilled cheese sandwich I've ever had! It was nice to be able to doll up a sandwich that the kids would eat too. It tasted like bruschetta on grilled cheese! AMAZING!

It's official - I'm never making regular grilled cheese sandwiches again! This was sooo delicious and filling! I used Italian multi grain bread and used 2 slices of Provolone because I do not really care for American cheese. I may substitute one slice for Swiss next time for more variation. This was very easy and a wonderful twist on a classic. This recipe has a permanent spot in my weekly rotation! :)

Yum!  This was like a gourmet grilled cheese.  I can't believe that I had never thought to put pesto and tomato (two of my favorite things!) on my grilled cheese.  Using a good, substantial bread makes this recipe even more satisfying.

I made these sandwiches for an independent living skills group I facilitate.  All 12 participants and myself agreed that these are the best grilled cheese sandwiches we've ever had.  It's like a party in the mouth.

The best grilled cheese I've ever eaten!! An excellent way to use up excess basil in the summer! I wish I'd have frozen some pesto sauce so I could make these all winter. Truly delicious and simple recipe!

Loved this.  Also can use fresh basil in place of the pesto for a lighter, more summery feel. Thanks for sharing.

Outstanding. I made pesto for pasta earlier in the week and saved a little to make these sandwiches. My husband raved about this recipe- we will add this to our regular rotation.

I really enjoyed this. I made it on a night when we had to eat dinner & run out the door. It was perfect for that. I served it with tomato soup on the side. My husband loved it.

I'm not a huge fan of tomatoes on my sandwich, but i love the tomato flavor. So i bought some tomato basil bread from panera and used that instead in this recipe. What a wonderful sandwich treat!

Delicious. My husband says it is the best thing he has ever eaten. It is easy and tasty and you can make your own improvements/changes to whatever you want.

I don't usually write reviews but this is the best grilled cheese sandwich I've ever had! I made my own pesto (which I make in bulk and freeze) I also didn't have provolone or american cheese so I used swiss and cheddar instead. It was so good! Went great with my homemade tomato bisque soup! Will definitely make again!

DELICIOUS!!  I used homemade basil pesto.  Grilled it on a panini pan.  I have lots of pesto, but never thought of combinining it with cheese & tomatoes.  YUMMO!!  The American cheese overwhelmed the Provolone so next time I will try swiss cheese for a stronger 'bite' and I will increase the amount of pesto.  Definitely will make again and try to get hubby to try it. He loves all the ingredients, but wasn't sure about the combination.    Doesn't know what he is missing.

Put pesto on both sides of bread then topped with 2 slices of provolone and chopped roasted red peppers (tried to recall recipe from memory alone. LOL!) It was really yummy but only giving it 4 stars bc it wasn't the recipe but close. Didn't really like the provolone. I will try mozz. or Amer next.  Def. has potential for a 5 star. Play a little! Update: Made 4-19 much better with Amer. Cheese and provolone, but OMG! I think its 2000 calories at least. Its good but not worth the calories! Have sparingly!

Fantastic !  Very little experience with pesto, so was a little leery, but wanted to make my frequent grilled cheese sandwiches less dull.  This did the trick!  Will be doing this often.

All we tasted was pesto.  Good thing I made a good one.  All in all, expensive for grilled cheese.  I'd rather have the basic grilled cheese (not with American though) where the cheese is the star.

This is fantastic. I am not a huge sandwich fan but do love a good grilled cheese and this was it. I did use Ezekiel 4:9 bread and homemade pesto. Followed directions and it came out perfect.

This was a pretty interesting combo and definitely worth a shot. I did end up burning mine but still enjoyed, would like to make it again with more care. This recipe has also got me spinning with how to make other types of grilled cheese sandwiches, so I'd also call this inspirational. Thank you for posting!

Wow.  These sandwiches are great.  I made homemade pesto a couple weeks ago and froze it into little sauce discs to thaw and use as individual servings.  Then I saw this recipe and was delighted!  I made mine with pepper jack cheese, fresh tomato slices, and of course pesto.  I usually use whole grain bread for sandwiches, but the italian bread was a good choice for this sandwich.

Wow! This is good! I made a few changes to make it a tad bit healthier--I took out the American cheese, you don't really need it, and I used a non-stick skillet sprayed with Pam and didn't use the butter. I had this sandwich for three days in a row! Delicious! To make it gluten free, I used Udi's Gluten Free Bread. I don't know if I'll ever be able to go back to regular grilled cheese sandwiches again!

I've used this recipe for a few years now with a little more Italian flavor to it: instead of using American cheese, use fresh thin slices of Mozzarella!  And instead of butter I brush the outside of the Bread with olive oil. You can use Italian bread or even Soudough or chia batts. This is the Sicilian Grilled Cheese that I long for!!

I've been making this delicious recipe now for a few months but forgot to rate it. This really jazzes up the plain ol' grilled cheese blues! I've put this on my George Foreman and made it panini style. The only difference is I sometimes change up the style of bread and always use mozzarella (personal preference). Thanks again for sharing this recipe!

This sandwich is a nice twist on your standard grilled cheese! It was very juicy and yummy. I made a few changes based upon what I had on hand - used wheat bread, slice of Swiss instead of provolone, and two slices of American. It was just cheesy enough and the tomato and pesto added good flavor and juiciness. DH and I both approve and will be making this again! Maybe with some homemade tomato soup on the side.

I love this twist on grilled cheese. I never would have thought to put pesto with grilled cheese-but it works! I did not have a slice of provolone cheese so I used all American cheese instead. I sliced roma tomatoes and used fresh pesto. This is just delicious! The sandwich is so flavorful with the sweet roma tomatoes, ooey gooey melted cheese with fresh pesto was just awesome! I ate this tasty sandwich with a small bowl of, "Hearty Chicken Vegetable Soup I," from this website.

I gave it 4 stars as I made alterations. I only spread pesto very thinly on one slice. Pesto has a very strong taste, go easy. I also skipped the American cheese and used mozzarella.

What a clever way to spruce up a good ole standby! Even though this is just incredibly simply, sometimes that is all it takes to add some wow to your meal.  I added turkey and tomato just to see how snazzy I could get, and it was great!

Best Grilled Cheese I've ever had! I made it with the roasted red pepper & tomato soup, made a tasty and filling dinner. Only difference I made was I lightly buttered the bread with a garlic butter and toasted them in the toaster oven, was less greasy. Delish!

Delicous!!!! Fancy restaurant taste indeeed. Only one change, due to by the time I got around to making them, no one in my family wanted grilled cheese the tomato was bad, so I substituted 1 tblsp of spaghetti sauce. YUM. Cant wait to make these again with a fresh tomato. No more regular grilled cheese for me.

This the best grilled cheese ever.  I used real cheese: muenster, a little swiss and cheddar.  The combination with the pesto was awesome. I served with Garden Fresh Tomato Soup from this site, and my husband said "I wonder what the poor people are eating tonight?"  
Contrast that with toasted American cheese on Wonder Bread, served with High Fructose Corn Soup, er, I mean Campbell's Tomato Soup...

Just made it this morning for brunch and it was fabulous!!!!!!!!! Used a George F. grill and package of pesto.  Really the best ever eaten.  I used regulaar white bread as it was all I had but next time I will use a good italian. Thanks for this great recipe!made it again and did low carb. tortillas.  Out Of This World!  Basil is not in any market so went to Public and got the tube of basil and added a bit of olive oil and a few pine nuts-mixed it in a small ramikin and spread a touch on both sides.  OMG!!!!!!!!!so so great and thanks. I just am craving this but trying to do lower carbs and this was just the best 5 net carb sandwich I ever ate!

Using onhand ingredients, made a similar sandwich with pesto, white American sliced cheese, white/wheat bread, dipped in salsa. The pesto adds great flavor...I'll be trying the original recipe in the near future.

This was the most delicious sandwich I’ve ever eaten in my life. I just used normal bread and one slice of tomato, but it was still great. I thought that the recipe was a little strange before I made it, but boy was I wrong. I could eat this until I died.

This was tasty and better than I even thought it would be. I didn't have any tomato, so can't wait to make it "right", but I did put some spinach on and that was really good. I'm looking forward to cooler weather to have this with some good soup.

Oh my goodness!  This is amazing.  We had colby jack and cheddar cheese in the house and I really think any cheese that you like would work in this.  Why have I never thought to use pesto sauce on grilled cheese before?!  Delicious!

Yum! What a great way to perk up regular grilled cheese! Grilled cheese is an all time classic and so simple to make. This was no exception and the combination of flavors was a real winner. I opted out of the American cheese and used a slice of mozzarella instead.  This was fabulous with a fresh garden salad and a nice glass of iced tea!

One of my favorite meals in the world is swiss, tomato, and hot mustard grilled cheese, on marble rye.  This pesto version is now another favorite.  Italian bread, mozzarella, tomato, and pesto grilled cheese, with a little butter - it is SO delicious.  Five ingredients, five minutes, it's more than the sum of its parts.  I, too, made and froze pesto in an ice cube tray and this is a good way to use it.  Highly recommended!

Very adaptable with cheeses. The biggest challenge is balancing the flavors... there is no exact formula but it's fun trying to find one :) I agree with another reviewer about not overdoing the pesto... either apply it to just one slice of bread, or else apply fairly thin layers to both slices. I'd also recommend going for thin (~1/4") tomato slices. Again, it's all about hitting the right balance.

It was really good. I had only Swiss and pepperjack but the 1 slice of the pepperjack put a slight bit of punch without messing with the pesto. I almost always make grilled cheese with tomato so this was just a different twist. When I make my normal gc&t sammie I use cojack and make sure i grill it slowly and with a lid on the griddle like we did in the diner I used to work in.  Oddly enought gc&t is fantastic with prepared mustard. Something about mustard and sharp cheeses. I also lightly salt the crispy sandwich just to get a bit of salty taste when you bite the sandwich. Its all yummy.   I could open my own grilled cheese restaurant lol   Thanks for this nice twist for my future menu!

Delicious!  We added some bacon to it and it was divine.  I'm not a fan of provolone so I used pepper jack, gouda, and muenster cheese slice combo's per individual taste.  Whole family loved this.  Will make again.  Pesto is a strong flavor, I go light on mine but hubby likes a little more than I do, so take that into consideration when making these.  Also next time I think I'll probably use Roma tomato's sliced long ways because they aren't as juicy and the heirloom tomatoes did make it a bit soggy but still delicious!

This is great, but hardly a relevation. I've been making sandwiches like this for years with mozzarella in my panini press--Caprese panini. It's pretty much the only way I use the pesto I make every year.

This was very tasty.  A grown up grilled cheese sandwich that even my 4 year old liked.  I think next time I would try mozarella

This sandwich was ok and added a little variation my lunch last week.  But with all the great reviews, I expected a flavor packed taste sensation.  I used wheat bread but otherwise followed recipe.  Butter or spread, pesto, and cheese makes a high calorie, high fat meal, and it's not very filling.  I probably won't make it again.

Super good!  Mouth watering and so easy to make.  Throw a delightful mixed green salad on the side or soup and it's an easy and yummy meal.

I made this sandwich recently with slight changes.  I only had red pepper pesto on hand, and I used Monterey Jack cheese and Mozzerella,with garden tomatoes.  Rave reviews all around!

My son took me to a deli and bought me a breakfast sandwich like this. DELICIOUS! It was made on an english muffin with ham and scrambled eggs, tomato and American cheese and the yummy pesto. I also made a grilled cheese one yesterday. A great combo!

I made it low sodium by using loso bread, Swiss cheese, and just a small amount of pesto.  Still tasted great.  Very flavorful!

Really nice change up to grilled cheese!  I followed the advice I saw here and only put the pesto on one side of the sandwich and that was plenty!

Love, LOVE love this sandwich. I had everything in the house except fresh tomatoes, so I put jarred sundried on mine and used a roasted red pepper on Hubby's. So yummy,  will definitely make again! SOON :)

Wow, what a great combination of flavors!  I got hooked and ate this a couple times this week :o  I only used provolone (1 slice) and found it offered enough in the cheese, salt, and fat department.

Made a version of this last night and I don’t think I can ever go back to regular grilled cheese. I used buttermilk bread, the good Irish butter, provolone and havarti, and added bacon. Left out the tomatoes because they aren’t my cup of tea. It was so delicious that my boyfriend ate two.

First let me start by warning everyone to check the food they already have in there house, because I came back from the store only to find that my provolone was moldy. Also butter the top slice before putting it on or else the bread may break.
           I substituted the provolone, and yellow american, for two slices of white american cheese. Even with the lack of specified ingredients my family and I loved them! Next time I may stay with my choice of cheese and add a few deli slices of chicken breast. Nothing fancy needed here!

Very tasty.  However, I do prefer regular grilled cheese or the Spicy Grilled Cheese Sandwich from this site so I doubt I'll make this again.

I found this recipe Friday. I made one without American cheese Saturday & it was delicious. I made one with American cheese & thought the first one was better. I made another one on Sunday, no American cheese, but with a few slices of pepperoni. Also, I only put pesto on one slice. This one is a keeper!

Delicious! I used homemade pesto and two slices of provolone cheese, rather than a slice of American. My second time making it, I also added a couple slices of oven-roasted turkey breast. It was amazing! So simple to make, and one of my favorites!

I'll never eat regular grilled cheese again! I'm addicted. Didn't have sliced provolone but I had shredded from Imos. Didn't have large Tomatos but had tiny hybrids from the garden. It still turned out amazing. I'm a fan.

I made this last night for my boyfriend. He can't stop raving about how good it was!

I used what bread we had (Daves Killer Bread), and I used Sundried Tomato Basil Pesto. I followed YvieWood's advice and concentrated the pesto on only one slice of bread, and did not use American cheese.

 His words exactly "a good sandwich doesn't require a ton of meat and you mastered that with this one." A definite keeper, will keep this one on my regular rotation of sammies :-)

Very good, I used mayo instead of butter, something I learned from another person here on AR, not as greasy as butter, doesn't taste like mayo either. Used the cheese I had on hand, Munster and Monterrey Jack. This was one tasty sandwich.

Made this for dinner last night, and my son said that it tasted like something you would get at a restaurant (which is a big compliment from him!). I used bakery Italian bread, which held up well with the grilling. Used mild Swiss instead of American but otherwise kept it as is. I think this would be good with any mild cheese. Perfect summer meal!

Loved it!  Kids loved it too.  Added fresh spinach just because I had it.  Great addition.  Also, baked the sandwiches in the toaster oven to save time and used sandwich thin bread to make them healthier.  Turned out fantastic.  We will definitely make this again.

I didn't have any tomatoes, but I added a slice of mozzarella to the American and provolone cheeses.  This is an excellent "upgrade" for a grilled cheese sandwich.

This is one of m absolute favorites. Used some bread that had olives baked into it that my grandma gave me from sprouts and I also used Swiss and Colby cheese because those are my favorite. Added lettuce and tomato too.

This  grill cheese sandwich is a twist to the basic version and so  easy to make!  The possibilities are endless. I used what I had on hand. I already had some garlic butter made in the fridge for garlic bread, so I used that with wheat bread, tomato, provolone cheese, italian blend cheese, and pesto.   Next time I am going to use sun dried tomatoes.

Husband RAVED and he is normally quite disdainful of sandwiches for main dish. I used homemade egg bread instead of italian bread, and I used homemade pesto, but this recipe gave me the idea of putting pesto inside! I also used a layer of mayonnaise which meshed with the pesto as it melted in the pan with the cheese inside the sandwich. For cheese, I used three slices of cheddar to one slice of fresh mozz. Oh it was delicious.

I think most anything made with homemade Pesto has to be good, but this sandwich was DELICIOUS!  I just planted two more basil plants so I can make more of these.  I'm glad I found this recipe.  BTW, I used wheat bread rather than the Italian bread.

I would've never thought of it - and it was sooo good! I had French bread, provolone, medium cheddar, tomatoes and pesto. Grilled cheese perfection! Thank you for posting such a great idea.

Definitely omit the American cheese, and use half the pesto. I used fontina and DID grill it in butter!  The result was a very rich and full flavored grilled cheese, Italian style!

I actually prefer this sandwich not grilled, no butter, half the pesto (or just two or three basil leaves), some Italian mayonnaise and the rest.  Somehow the grilling makes this an unattractive sandwich which turns me off before I can start to eat it.  It's a good meatless summertime quick meal.

Made as stated. Very nice. Will play around with ingredients--most notably something other than provolone--but overall pretty solid. Used "Pesto" recipe by Anderval. Thanks to OP and other reviewers for contributing.

I loved this so much, it was an amazing simple thing to do and yet it changed how I saw a simple grilled chesse as. the only thing I have to say is that I make mine with less pesto but I also add more different things. It really is an open recipe to add your own personal touches.

This recipe does not need any modifications. If you're a college student on a budget and want something that is comparable to Panera-style, then this is it. I added some slices of salami, but it tastes great without it too. Sourdough bread goes well with this sandwich as well.

Liked the addition of pesto to grilled cheese but didn't care for the provolone with it.  I think it would be better with a creamier cheese.

I made these the first time exactly as the recipe called for and they were excellent. The truly great thing about this recipe is that you can add whatever you want depending on your mood. If you have a slice or two of leftover bacon it's a great addition.

It's very easy! Definitely use cheddar instead of American. I also tried it with turkey instead of tomatoes but the tomato sandwich was definitely better. You need the freshness of the tomato to cut through the oil of the pesto and the butter. Very tasty!!

made my own pesto, followed recipe...omg yummy!!  Everyone in the family loved it!  Only advise I have is, as much as I love pesto and wanted to slather it on the bread, DON'T! spread thin and scrape off extra on top and bottom slice, that's all u need otherwise it will overpower...and make sure to put your tomato slice between the cheeses.  mm...

This is my go-to grilled cheese recipe. I used stewed canned tomatoes & tons of pesto. I think red bell peppers (the sweet kind) would be a good substitute in place of the tomatoes. You can't go wrong with this winner!

This was pretty good. Not the way I will always make my grilled cheese, but nice for a change. I think next time I would look for a stronger tasting cheese or cheese combination. After all, the cheese is what it's all about. Thanks!

We used only provolone bc we forgot the american. Picked 2 tomatoes off the vine. Used Wegman's already prepared pesto (which is really good). Fantastic sandwich. Def making again.

made this yesterday for myself and my hubby, it was amazing! I love pesto so I was eager to try this. The only change I made was to add more slices of cheese :)  I love a cheesy grilled cheese sandwich. I used two slices of each cheese and it turned out delicious. This recipe is a keeper! Thank you for posting it!

Yum, yum, yum.  I had some pesto to use up and came across this simple sandwich recipe.  I did use whole multi-grain bread to make this as it is what I had on hand.  This made for a very simple, yet tasty lunch sandwich.  You could make this combination using any type of bread or cheese that you have on hand.  Thanks, RASSA2 for sharing your wonderful recipe.  It was very much enjoyed!

I took this recipe and added some rotisserie chicken from the market. I also made my own pesto sauce using pesto,basil, garlic,olive oil,vegetable oil, salt, pepper, and almonds. I have no need to eat at panera bread anymore this was fantastic. Thanks.  Oh skipped the American cheese.

Divine! Who knew something so simple could be so delicious. Only thing I changed was I omitted the American and just used twice as much provolone. I think maybe the American would overpower the other flavors?

I absolutely loved these! As a matter of fact I hadn't saved this so I went looking for it right now because I was craving it on a cold rainy sick day! You have to try it!

YUM YUM YUM.  Simple, yet delicious! I used a medium cheddar in place of American but otherwise followed this to a "t".  Perfect, ooey gooey goodness.

Tasty combination of ingredients!  Though a tad on the salty side, this is really big a step up from the classic grilled cheese.
