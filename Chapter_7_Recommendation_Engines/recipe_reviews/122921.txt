This recipe tastes great as is, though you can improvise with almost anything (NOT processed cheese, now a family legend: "Remember when Mimi blew up ham and cheese egg rolls and spent the first episode of Star Wars chiseling cheese out of the oven?")  Using only a couple tablespoons filling makes them wrap better.  Flip halfway in the baking, then let them cool completely before putting in the freezer. That seems to help the "soggy in the microwave" problem.  They keep in the refrigerator a couple days and microwave great from there; we keep running into each other on midnight egg roll raids. They are so good even our picky toddler nephew wanted more.    Fun family project for a Friday night, or an assembly line before DVD night with friends, not too expensive for take-our quality, and hearty enough to be a light meal.    Lovely less sodium, lower fat, easily adjustable take on a favorite.  Thanks for a real winner!

Used my own egg roll recipe, but was a great idea to bake them. They came out very crisp just have to make sure to turn them half way through. Good way to reduce some fat. Thanks.

I thought this was a great recipe!  The filling was tasty and I loved that the recipe called for baking them.  They turned out really crispy in the toaster oven- just be sure to turn them occasionally to crisp all sides evenly.  I also deep-fried a couple for my husband and he loved them too!

I TRIED THE BAKING TECHNIQUE MAINLY BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT FOOL WITH THE OIL MESS..I USED LEFTOVERS (WILD RICE,PEAS,COOKED CHICKEN,MUSHROOMS,CARROT,ETC.)FOR THE FILLING AND ALL I HAD TO DO WAS FILL AND BAKE USING A TOASTER OVEN,AND THEY TURNED OUT GREAT!I USUALLY ONLK COOK FOR MYSELF SO IF YOU HAVE MIXED YOUR  FILLING,AND HAVE THE WRAPPERS IN THE FRIG.,YOU CAN OUICKLY MAKE AS FEW AS YOU WANT IN NO TIME!I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO TURN THEM AS THEY TURNED GOLDEN ALL OVER IN 15 MIN.LOVED IT!

I reheated the eggrolls the next day in a 350 oven for 10 minutes. I sprayed the rolls with baking spray prior to baking the second time. They were much better the second time, probably due to the flavors blending, etc. I served them with sweet and sour sauce with a dabble of tabasco. I had enough mixings to use up all of the eggroll wrappers, approximately 16. Absolutely wonderful. I will make these again.

I love this recipe, but because I'm cooking for one, it is a lot of leftovers. When re-cooking, I have found that it is good to either put a little olive oil or spray a pan and sautee them.  If you just warm them in the microwave, they get soggy.  Sauteeing them gives them a crisp outer layer.

Fantastic!  Crispy egg rolls without frying--sooo good.  The filling is perfectly flavored. I didn't have bean sprout but add napa cabbage for crunchinest.  It did need a little more of the sauce to make the filling thick enough and I added just a bit more soy sauce.  My husband was impressed and ate quite a few, actually many of these. If you keep the filling and skins in the fridge, you could make them anytime.  Be sure to turn them half way through cooking for even browning.  Thanks for the terrific recipe.

I improvised a little and these were delicious. I cooked the chicken right in the pan before adding the veggies, then added fresh mushrooms and frozen peas/carrot dices. The sauce was tasty and light, and they baked up nice and crispy.

Delicious! I make these exactly as directed.  The only difference is I bake them on a cooling rack top of the baking sheet.  This allows airflow under the eggrolls and helps the whole thing get nice and crispy.  YUM!

This is the first time I've ever made egg rolls. The fact that these were baked instead of fried is why I made this recipe. I made just veggie egg rolls replacing the two cups of meat with celery, zucchini and mushrooms.They were very easy to assemble and I used my Pampered Chef stone to bake these, turning halfway after ten minutes. My sons both had their gals over and these disappeared so fast I was lucky to get two for myself. I did make a sweet and sour dipping sauce off AR do go with. So versatile you could make just about any meat and vegetable combination. I do believe I'll try some chopped jalapenos in my next batch. But I will be making these often and not feel guilty about the fat from frying.

My husband absolutely loves these egg rolls and requests them on a regular basis. These are very easy to make. I make my filling up ahead of time so that it has some time to cool just a bit before filling the wraps.

I thought these were great, and the family did too.  I used ground chicken which gave it a gretat texture, and used carrot slaw (sold in bags), worked out wonderfully.  I added the liquides to the chicken and onion, then added veggies, kept them crisp.  Dab water on them instead of spray, made them crispier.  Thanks, loved them!!

I followed the recipe exactly and these turned out fantastic.  One helpful hint, for crispy baked egg rolls do not spray/oil the cookie sheet and do not spray/oil the egg roll before baking.

Awesome! I love that these are baked! You can't quite compare them to *traditional* egg rolls, but I really enjoy them! I am only reviewing the baking method, not the insides. I have my own recipe for that. Coleslaw mix, corn, ground pork, chinese 5 spice, garlic, ginger. Cook ground beef, then add the rest and cook for a couple of minutes. Let cook, then proceed with recipe.

My family loved these. I used cabbage instead of bean sprouts because that is what I had. They tasted just as good reheated the next day.

My husband and I loved these!  We dipped it in a mix of Thai Sweet Chilli Dipping Sauce and Hot Chinese Mustard.  It took about 25 mins for the egg roll wraps to brown up.  What a fun, nutionally dense spin on egg rolls.  We will be making these again!

Very good!  I love that they turned out nice and crispy just like you would expect of an eggroll, but they were baked.  I baked mine about 12 minutes on one side and 6 minutes on the other (not realizing they would brown more on the bottom than the top).

The only change from the recipe I made was to use sesame oil instead of vegetable oil in the filling, for more of an oriental flavor.

My husband and 12 year old son both ate them, really liked them, and said they needed no changes.  THANKS for this fun and yummy recipe!

Very good.  I used shredded cabbage instead of carrots as that's what I had on hand.  I cooked them on top of a cooling rack on a pan and turned them half way through cooking.  These can also be frozen for serving later.

I knew these wouldn't be as good as deep fried but with all the great reviews I expected more. I sprayed my sheets and rolls and flipped halfway through but they just didn't quite taste right. They had browned but they were chewy and tasted like raw flour. So I ended up brushing them well with oil and baked 5 more mins on each side. This improved them a bit. I guess I just prefer the crunchiness of raw veggies inside egg rolls from flash frying. Baking them cooked the insides too much for me. I really wanted to like these but I will not make them again, sorry.

Awesome! I love egg rolls and now I can do them without deep frying. Good flavor, easy to make. I used a Black Raspberry Chipotle sauce(thanks SWChef for the sauce!) and Dijon for dipping. They were great! Thanks for the recipe.

I wasn't crazy about the filling, but I liked the method of cooking and impressed on how crunchy they got. The coloring isn't as pretty as frying, but I could get over that with the amount calories I'm saving :) Next time I will do another filling but bake them.

We loved these!  We omitted the water chesnuts and the green peppers and added yellow onion.  Also, we used salad shrimp instead of chicken.  I was really skeptical of this recipe but I can't believe how good they turned out.  I had to deviate from the cooking time, as mine took a lot longer, but they tasted so good they were well worth the wait.  I think adding cabbage would make these great.  A piece of advice would be not to put too much stuffing in the egg roll wrapper or it will burst at the seems.  Served these with this site's "Chinese Chicken Soup" and we had a wonderful dinner.

I really don't like to give low reviews but the egg rolls tasted like paste.  The only change I made was substituting cabbage for green pepper.

Super good! I created my own version with asian cabbage instead of bean sprouts. I made a wonton filling with ground turkey and put that in the egg rolls instead of chicken. I just love healthier versions of great food!

Very good!  And without all the calories of frying them.  I used a bag of broccoli slaw mix for the vegetables- and threw the slaw mix and chicken into the food processor before adding to the onion in the skillet.  Will make again, Thanks for a good staple recipe.

I thought these had a really good flavor. I think next time I would like to try them with ground pork instead however.  For the veggies I substituted bagged coleslaw mix, just to make things easier.  And for personal preference I fried them instead.  My whole family really liked them. I served them with Sweet and Sour Sauce II from this site, very good!

I wanted to try this recipe because we were craving egg rolls but didn't want the fat of frying them. However, we were disappointed in this. Besides the odd texture of the wrappers when baked instead of fried, the flavor of the inside mixture was just not there for us. Probably won't make this again, but thanks anyway! :)

I love the idea of these, but I (and my fiance) thought that the filling was missing something.  I will make these again, but play around with the ingredients.  They do taste better the next day.

Excellent! You can play a lot with this recipe too. Love the fact that you can keep the filling in the fridge to make whenever you'd like. This is definitely is a keeper! Thanks for sharing...

I didn't have time to make the suggested filling, so I just sauteed a bag of Asian slaw mix with some sesame oil, salt and pepper and made the egg rolls.  I baked for 12 minutes, and I didn't need to turn them at all.  My 7 year old, who is an egg roll fanatic, LOVED them.  This is a great way to make egg rolls without all the fat of deep frying.

I have become a fan of these eggrolls. I have made many times. Once ,using last nights stuffed green peppers. And another time using leftover steak cut into small pieces.

I loved the filling for these. Although I guess I'm not very skilled yet in the art of filling/rolling the egg rolls. Mine kind of turned out doughy. I also would suggest like doubling or tripling the filling. I ran out fairly quickly

I used my own filling but I baked them following this method & they were excellent!  They took about 16-18 minutes.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is turn the egg rolls during baking so that they do not brown more on the part touching the baking sheet.

Crispy and delicious! I tasted the filling before rolling up the egg rolls and the flavor was great. Next time I think I will use fresh sprouts since they are more crisp. To get brown up we had to broil on all sides after baking.

I really liked this even though I'm such a disaster in the kitchen that I overcooked the insides and then overcooked the outsides. Despite the mushy centers and blackened outsides, they were still yummy. Next time I shall attempt to pay better attention.

OK, so I changed a lot of the filling ingredients since I'm a vegetarian and wanted to keep it simple.  I used 1 cup chopped baby bellas, 1 cup chopped scallions, and 2 cups broccoli slaw (so easy!).  This produced 6 egg rolls, but I scaled the ingredients down to 4 servings.  Maybe because of my changes the sauce seemed a bit bland.  I think next time I will make a sauce to go with them.  That being said, they were deliciously crunchy and absolutely satisfying as egg rolls.  Will definitely try again with more tweaks!

I substitute the cole slaw mix in the stores for the carrots. I am not a big carrot fan and think they would be a bit much. I also cook my vegetables longer. I like them to be soft not crunchy. My family absolutely loves these better than any restaurant. Will definitely continue to be on my dinner menu on Chinese evenings.

I thought this recipe was pretty good as is and love that they're baked. I've tried it a few different ways with good results since, my husbands favorite so far is a southwest egg roll version with diced tomatos, corn, black beans, spinach, chicken, cheese & cilantro. Thanks for a great idea!

This was okay. Edible, but really nothing special for the amount of work to chop up all the veggies, cook, and then fill the wrappers.  The filling didn't really have much flavor, and I added extra soy sauce, hoisin sauce, and 6 cloves of garlic.  Definitely needed something extra to give it that oomph.  Won't be making these again, but I do like the idea of baking, and it turned out golden brown and crunchy.

I chose to do these all veggie. I loved the crunch of the water chestnuts. And baking them they come out just as crunchy as frying them. Everyone here loves a good egg roll. I took couple of extra wrappers and formed them and put sauces in them for a special personal touch. That went over well.

Loved these.  I am gluten intolerant so I used rice paper, which meant they weren't as pretty, but the taste was really yummy.  Loved the sauce that was mixed with the mix.  I threw together a peanut butter, soy sauce, and water sauce for dipping.

I really wanted to like these.  The idea of baking instead of frying I loved, but the taste was just not there.  I'm guessing it was the ingredients, but I found them inedible.  I couldn't tell if there were too many bean sprouts, or if the water chestnuts just didn't taste right being cooked that long.  I left out the green peppers as I don't like them, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Just had an overall funny taste.  Sadly, I will not be making these again.

This is a nice lite egg roll, I used shrimp in half and crab in the other half. I also froze some of them and I pull them out for snacks or a meal and heat in the oven or toaster oven.

So delicious!  I used ground pork instead of chicken and cabbage instead of bean sprouts.  My husband said these were better than any egg rolls we've had in 5 years (haven't had good luck with Chinese food in the midwest).

This recipe was very tasty.  I gave it 5 stars because it was great the way that it is.  However, I might use a few different ingredients next time to change it up! I will definitely make this one again since the whole family liked it and it was baked not fried.

These were okay.  They didn't have the flavor that I had hoped for.  I also thought the filling was a little crumbly.

They are always delicious! Sometimes I sub ground pork for the chicken, add in shredded cabbage or maybe take out an ingredient or two, just depends on what I have on hand, but these are delightful just as written. The best part is that it's lower in fat and a lot less messy to cook. It's a keeper for sure! :)

These were soo good. The only thing i did different was used ground chicken instead of reg. cooked chicken. Ground meat of any kind seems more authentic to me. Other than that follwed the recipe exactly. I will make these again soon! Served with sweet chili sauce- yum!

I used my own filling but five stars for the idea of baking them. Crispy, not greasy! I prefer these to fried egg rolls.

These were tasty, I left out the chicken though.  I had to bake for probably closer to 22-25 minutes before they were nice and crispy.  I will make these again!

Very tasty. I added some ginger to give it a little extra pop. Also I rolled the wrappers a little thinner to make it crips but not hard.

We Love this recipe, but the only thing we complain about is that it takes too long to cool off...lol.  This is my favorite dish and it's not too high in calories. You can play around with what veggies to add and leave out what you can't find in the store. I don't use garlic I use fresh ginger and I cook it with the chicken so it's not so plain. 

You can also use ground turkey instead of the chicken.  We think it tastes better with ground turkey.

Thank you, Barbara, for sharing this recipe.  I used to have a recipe for baked egg rolls but lost it, so I was glad to find this one (we never fry anything).  I did make a couple minor changes though, because I am vegetarian, I left out the chicken.  I also left out the onion and garlic because I don't like them either.  I think they came out great!  My whole family really liked them too.  I also really liked the cayenne powder in them, it gave it just the right touch.  Thanks again.

You can really change around the ingredients used---I never make the same egg rolls twice!  Nice a crispy even thought they are baked!

For anyone trying to eat healthy and loose weight, fried egg rolls are a big no, no! But my husband loves egg rolls. I tried this recipe and it was a big winner. We served them with La Choy's sweat and sour sauce, "unfried rice" and egg drop soup. It tasted as good as going out for Chinese, but felt better because it was minus all that grease!

We enjoyed this thoroughly! Good mild flavour in the filling. I got lazy and did not dice up the sliced chestnuts - mistake! Made wrapping it difficult. Will definitely do so next time.

my hubby loved these.  I used frozen grated carrots, a whole can of water chestnuts and a whole green pepper since I didn't want any extra to go to waste.  I also used left over chicken from the roasted chicken I made the other day for supper.  I wrapped them in spring roll wrappers and baked them, since my hubby prefers spring roll wrapped baked and egg roll wrappers fried.  Very good will make again.

Don't try to bake your eggrolls, it doesn't work!
Fire up the wok, fill it with cheap vegatable oil
and fry these things the way you're supposed too!

Having said that:
This recipe is actually pretty good, but
add a little ginger and double up on the garlic...BAM!

I loved that these were baked. I thought that the filling was a bit bland and added some extra spice to it. I like the general idea and am going to try it with other filling elements to see how they come out.

QUITE TASTY!  love the lower-calorie version of these!  i made with tofu instead of chicken-could use a little more garlic and maybe ginger and sesame oil for more flavor.  will definately tweak for more flavor and make again.

These were really good.  I forgot to bake the chicken ahead of time so I just ommitted that.  It only made 14 since I didn't use chicken.  Everyone except my picky little sister loved them. I served them with sweet and sour chicken (from this site).

These are wonderful! I didn't change a thing. The filling takes some time but is well worth it! I got 21 rolls. Took a few to work MY lunch and I ended up with ONE!! They were copying and handing out the recipe. A real keeper! Thanks!!

Having never made home-made eggs rolls before I thought this was a pretty easy recipe to follow; although I wasn't impressed with the taste, as it seemed to lack the flavor I was looking for. I made do again and tweak the filling to our tastes. Thanks for a "baked" recipe, though!
