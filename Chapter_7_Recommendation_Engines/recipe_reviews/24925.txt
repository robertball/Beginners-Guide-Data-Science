I have a similar recipe that you add a slice of ham on top of the cheese mixture before rolling. It works great with this recipe too and adds a little to the color of the roll when they're sliced.

I'm so glad I found this recipe!  I had something similar to this at a party once and have been trying to find this recipe forever!  This one is even better!!!  I used regular, sun-dried tomato and spinach tortillas and it made it look very pretty on the plate.  You really can't  taste much of a difference between the different tortillas because the filling is so flavorful.  They are even better the second day!

I made this for a party and it went over well.  Instead of jalapenos I added fried, crumbled bacon.  That was good!  Next time, though, I would reduce the sour cream to about 3/4 cup and increase the grated cheese to about 3/4 cup.

I made this for a neighborhood party and everyone loved it!  I didn't want it to be too spicy (lots of kids) or too dry unless dipped (too messy), so I substituted one can of stewed tomatoes with mild chilies (drained and very finely chopped)for the jalapeno. Since then several of the guests have asked for the recipe and made it themselves.  All preferred it with the tomatoes, instead of with a picante sauce for dipping.  We all also learned that it works much better to make it the night before.  I tried cutting it after an hour, and then again the nex morning.  It worked great and looked very nice the next day. Many friends have used it when they need something to bring to a gathering, but want to be able to make it in advance.  I even cut it and put it out on a tray (tightly saran-wrapped) about six or seven hours before the party, and it didn't dry out and tasted delicious.

I'm am not a sour cream / cream cheese person (except in desserts of course) so I thought this was just so-so.  I did add some chopped red bell pepper, garlic and onion powder, paprika, cayenne, oregano and some poppy seeds to spruce it up a bit.  It actually tasted good with some seasoning tossed in it.  I did eat a few... but just get turned off by the thought of having to swallow a mouth full of cream cheese.  I guess I was very generous with the amount of mixture I spread on my tortillas.  My guest did eat some and enjoyed them.  Not bad, but not something I'd make again any time soon.  Thanks anyway.

I have made these many times (many times at the request of friends who miss them - grin) - I have also done versions with adding packaged dry taco seasoning to the filling - as well as adding finely chopped green and red peppers - adds good color - also makes a nice presentation to use different color tortillas - or to put those decorative toothpicks in each one (also helps to hold them together) - the taco seasoning adds a nice kick

This is really good. I didn't have any jalapeno, so I added a small can of Ortega diced chiles. This is so much better the next day, after the flavors have blended. Next time I make this I won't even bother to serve it until the next day.

I had to give this three stars - but I am pretty sure that is because I messed up.  So don't do what I did.  I put way too much of the mixture on each tortilla.  It was too much.  I should have realized it when I used less tortillas than the recipe called for.  I am going to try it again and space out the filling enough.  I am sure that it is much better that way!

I made half with the jalapenos and the other half with bacon and a slice of ham. Both were wonderful. Don't forget the salsa. It really compliments the roll-ups. These are goooooddddd.

I took this dish to a cook-out over the weekend.  I decided to leave out the jalapenos to appeal to the masses.  Instead, I used a small can of diced tomatoes with green chiles (drained) and added about a tsp. of chile powder.  They were delicious and the first thing to go!

these were really good! easy and quick to make. i added "mexican seasonings" i had lying around instead of jalepenos, still tasty. i ran out of tortillas and used the left-over mixture for dip/spread for crackers -- very tasty too -- a great alternative, if you don't have the time (or want to wait) on the tortilla process! :)

I gave this four stars because the people in my office ate these up and commented on how good they were.  I thought they were very bland, though, all I tasted was cream cheese and tortilla.  I like my mexican-style food very spicy.  Some hot taco seasoning and more cheese may make these better.

These cheesy roll-ups were a delight at my Christmas buffet.  Additions I found helpful: 1/4c-1/2c sweet roasted red peppers drained and chopped; salt and white pepper; 1tsp. minced garlic; sundried tomato mild jabonera tortillas (Trader Joes); sprinkling of ground red pepper on finished product for an extra kick (a basic requirement for my brother-in-law), and for a fun display.  Options: Lemon juice works ok instead of lime if you have no limes; I used 1/2c. sour cream, and two packets of softened cream cheese instead of one of each; You can omit jalapeno peppers if you use above red pepper addition for you tender mouths. You also can make the cheese mixture 24 to 48 hours ahead, and spread the mixture onto the tortillas the night before serving, refrigerating worked very well in a ziploc with the rolls stacked upon each other to keep them tight. Salsa was the preferred choice of dips, but I think a ranch dip would work well too. I'm sure you will enjoy these, it's nice to have an appetizer roll without chopped ham and pickles for once.

I recently made these wraps for a baby shower and tripled the recipe...they were a smash hit!  Instead of white tortillas I found red chile flour tortilla wraps at Trader Joes.  Perfect!

This was a hit at my husband's work party. I doubled the jalapenos (we like spicy food) and added a little extra cheese (cheddar and jack). We couldn't stop eatting them as we were making them!

The only additional ingredient I use is chopped cilantro, especially using the stems.  It adds a wonderful flavor to the cheeses.  Everyone loves them!  Making some today for the Superbowl.

These were the best. I took the advice of some of the other posters and used varying amounts of ingredients. I tripled the batch and it was a huge hit.

These are requested specifically every year for our opening day football party.  Every year I double the recipe and they're still gone before halftime of the first game!  The only modification I have made was, at the hubby's request, adding bacon bits to the mixture.  Thanks for sharing.

I thought this recipe was rather bland and made the following changes to "spruce" it up.  I substituted the cheddar with "Mexican" seasoned shredded cheese, added a pinch of garlic powder, and I used the burrito sized tortillas instead of the 6 inch ones.  In the end, I still wasn't crazy about the roll-ups, but everyone at the party I took them to loved them.  Two ladies claimed they couldn't stop eating them and asked for the recipe. I would give this dish 3 stars, but everyone else felt it deserved 5.  My compromise is the 4 stars.

This recipe was an instant hit at several recent Christmas parties - so much that many friends in attendance wanted the recipe for themselves!  The roll ups were the first plate of nibblies to be emptied on every buffet.  One friend who made the recipe later forgot the jalapenos, but it still tasted fine - just be sure to use a very hot salsa to compliment the cheeses!

I ALWAYS add much more green onions and peppers.  I have made it several times for company.  It always gets great reviews.  Best if made several hours in advance.

I made a few changes, so my review is biased.  After reading it was bland, I decided to add half a jar of picante sauce to the mix.  That, combined with the jalapenos really, really spiced it up!  I thought they were spicy, but everyone else loved them this way.  I did tomato and spinach tortillas to make a Holiday appetizer.  I'll make them again with the picante alteration.

Really good and easy party food. I usually use canned diced mild green chiles rather than jalapenos (what can I say, I don't do hot). They are best if you can give them some time wrapped in the refrigerator before you slice and serve.

These are awesome and easy, use flavored wraps for different effects.  I've never served them with picante sauce, they're gobbled up the second I arrive.  I'm always asked to bring these.

These were pretty good. We don't like jalapenos so I used a drained can of green chiles and added a TBLS of minced green bell pepper. I think they could use a spice but I couldn't say what. Still, they make for an easy appetizer or snack.

This was a big hit at a potluck I went to! And then it was requested again for this year's superbowl party! Everyone loved it, including me! Cream cheese and green onions are some of my favorite ingredients!

I've tried this recipe twice and absolutely love it (so does everyone else).  The first time I didn't have quite enough green onions, so I substituted some cilantro.  I made it just like that this last time.  (just about 1/4 cup cilantro)  I also add more jalapeno peppers and a little slice of ham like somebody mentioned before.  Oh, I also like to do it a day ahead of time.  The ingredients really do mesh better!  Excellent!

These were really good, but the onion was a little overpowering. I did like the texture though, and the guests seemed to enjoy them.

These were good, but not fantastic.  I found the mixture to be a little bland for my taste, but still good.  My guests liked them well enough, but they didn't suit me.  If I made them again, I woudl try making the mixture the day before so the flavors could have time to blend.

I wish I would have made these when I first printed the recipe out...these are delicious.  Everyone at my worked loved them!  The only change I made was instead of using jalapeno peppers, I used green chiles.  Came out great.

Geez.  Two five-star rated recipes that I thought were just average.  This one was too much sour cream and not enough flavor.  I didn't have on hand other cream cheese to change it up so I made it exactly as stated.  My dinner group gave them a 3 also and not all were eaten...

Ive made this several times as is. They are very good. One tip is to put a little of the mixture in the opposite end of the tortilla to act as "glue".

I am confused as to how it has a rating of so many stars. They are extremely bland!!!
I took them to a party and a lot of people took them, because they look good, but a lot of people had them on their plate when they threw their plate away. I will go back to my ham and crab roll-ups!

These were great! I will add a bit of cumin or chili powder next time to add a bit more depth to the flavor. A big hit and I plan on putting them on the Christmas eve buffet as well. As far as the review saying the onion was overpowering, the name is Cheesy ONION Roll-ups - so the onion taste was to be expected.

This recipe could be better.  You really have to like a strong onion taste to enjoy it the way it is. Other than the onion you don't really taste anything but the tortilla.

I liked these, but they are a bit messy.  You do need to make these plenty ahead of time and don't take out of the frig until just before.  Taste was good.

I made these for a party at work, and they went over really well! Out of everything that I made, these were the easiest, and the first to go. I'll definitely be making these again!

I think I may have used to thick of tortillas for this, but I just didn't see the raves behind these. Nothing special. First recipe with 5 stars that I have tried on this site that I haven't loved!

This recipes was a huge hit at our families Christmas Party. The men especially loved it. The only thing that I altered was instead of serving the salsa on the side, I mixed it in with the other ingredients. I also used the 10" flour tortillas and cut them up in sections. It is yummy!

These wraps were tasty, but even though I used low fat sour cream and low fat cream cheese they were still a little on the rich side.  Seems like they would be good to play around with and try adding tomato, olives, or even spinach.

Very good.  You do definately have to kick it up with some taco seasoning, seasoned cheese, hot sauce, etc.  Good the first day - great the second day.  Makes a lot.

Very good & easy to make.  I used 10" soft shells & cut each in fourths. Made them twice & had leftover spread for crackers. These are better if refridgerated overnight or all day.  Keep in covered plastic container & cut before serving.

These were awesome. I took them to an office party and had quite a few people ask for the recipe. The only changes I made: added about 1/4 c. sun-dried tomatoes and omitted the lime juice as I was out. Will make again!

Instead of messing with chopping the jalepenos, I used a 4oz can of diced peppers and it still had taste! I used whole wheat tortillas too and they held up longer.

They came out pretty good and they looked really nice.  The only thing I was'nt so high on were the green onions.  I love onions and I put them in everything but for some reason the onions were overwhelming in this dish.  Other wise it's a very enjoyable disn.  it's nice and hot (spicy).

These were okay, but nothing spectacular.  The cream cheese taste was too strong, it overpowered the rest of the ingredients.  I just felt like there was something missing from this recipe.

I definetly wasn't excited about this recipe.  I gave it a 4 because everyone ate them.  They came out to bland for my taste.  I even added garlic salt and hot sauce.

These are the first to go at a party! Since my husband likes them hot I leave the seeds in the peppers and add extra cheese (old).

I thought these were fantastic. I added a dash of hot sauce and ground roasted red pepper.

Too much sour cream for me and not enough cheddar or spice.  I will try again with 1/2 cup of sour cream, twice the amount of cheddar, using sharp cheddar, use green chili peppers instead of jalapeno and sprinkle with garlic salt.

I made these for a party, and someone said, "These are surprisingly good!" I think that was a compliment. :) It made a TON, but they all got gobbled up. I served them with hot and mild salsa, and they were a hit!
