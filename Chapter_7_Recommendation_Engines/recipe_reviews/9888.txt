I love this receipe, I have been making this receipe for years and have always wanted to add this receipe.  I also add 1 tbsp of butter or margarine to the sauce pan when I am melting the peanut butter mixture. I also add 1/2 cup of spanish nuts (peanuts with brown skins on) to receipe before I add the rice krispies. This is amazing, I always make at xmas time or when ever I need to bring squares for an occassion. They are always the first to go

This sweet confection comes together really fast.  Be sure to have your dish buttered before you start!  I made a double batch of this and put it in a 9 x 11 dish.  I followed another reviewer's advice and used 12 oz. semi-sweet chocolate chips melted with 2 Tbs. of butter for the topping.  People couldn't keep their hands off these!  Next time I will add some chopped peanuts.

These were ok.  I used only 1-1/2 T milk and the icing was the perfect consistency.  I also put them in the frig for about 15 minutes to set up.  If I make them again, I would prefer a more chocolate-y icing...more cocoa or maybe the chocolate chips other reviewers recommended.

A big hit with everyone and definately one I will make often although I doubled the recipe.  No point in going to that work for a small batch.  Too yummy!!!

I used to eat these as a kid. The only change is for the chocolate topping. Use chocolate chips. Broil in oven just long enough to melt them and spread them.

It is tasty bar but the frosting is pretty bad. If it had a more chocolatey, candy-like frosting this would be a 4-5 star recipe.

I made a double batch and used a 9x13 pan.  The recipe just says to melt the first 3 ingredients.  I actually let them bubble a minute or so and would let them bubble longer the next time so they would set up a little firmer, but that's just a consistency preference of mine.  I added an extra 1/2 c. peanut butter to the double batch as I love peanut butter and for the topping, I melted 2 Hershey milk chocolate bars and drizzled them over the top.  I used the rice cereal, but think I may try them with corn flakes the next time.  They're a delicious addictive sort of treat.

These are awesome!  I always double the recipe and use a 9x13 pan. They disappear in a flash.  My kids and their friends love them. I store them in the fridge for a firmer texture.  Great easy recipe for a snack in a hurry that pleases most anyone.

These were really yummy!  I added an extra 1/2 C of cereal, just seemed to be a lot of coating.  I also added an extra t. of cocoa powder to the glazed to make it a bit more chocolatey.  Only the very top of the glaze hardened and underneath was a bit soft.

These are THE BEST!  I made them for my brother who is allergic to all dairy products and eggs.  (I didn't make the icing- only the bars.)  All I can really say is... YUM!!!  The peanut butter flavor wasn't too intense and the crunch of the cereal and the smoothness of the peanut butter were the perfect combination.  Because my brother is allergic to just about everything in the icing, I dusted the top with confectioners' sugar and cocoa.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

This recipe is one that I discovered after going through my grandmothers old cookbooks after she had passed away. I made it that very night and I can see why she liked it, it's very sweet and she had a sweet tooth! We really enjoyed it and I will be making it again for sure!

pretty yummy. way too much frosting, it was too sweet. i scraped it off. next time, im going to sprinkle chocolate chips on top the mixture while its warm, then spread it out instead of the frosting. it will probably last longer that way, and it will taste much better. very good recipe. thanks!

It's pretty good for something that takes only a few minutes. I hate when frosting tastes like powdered sugar so i double the cocoa in it and added a little vanilla. Delicious!

Very sweet bars but the icing ingredients were more like a glaze which would not solidify.  I refrigerated the bars in their pan but the glaze just stayed as liquid that soaked through.  Very tasty though!

Most desserts aren't too sweet for me, and this one almost was!  It was way too sweet for my husband.  I used different cereal I had on hand and it worked out fine.

Cereal layer was quick, easy to make, tasty and chewy.  I changed the topping:  melt 2/3 C. Chipits + 1 T butter in microwave.  Spread over cereal layer.  Sprinkle with peanuts.

I added 1 tablespoon of butter to the pb mixture while cooking, and an extra cup of cereal because there was a lot of sauce. I skipped the frosting, but made the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site from chocolate chips (in the microwave). I like these better than scotcheroos!

I found the bars to be VERY sweet.  I can only take one small piece at a time... these should last a while. They are very good.  The icing I found to be VERY lacking.  used about 4 TBSP cocoa powder to get the level of chocolate flavor I wanted for these super sweet bars.  I am keeping the recipe, but next time I'll probably try a different cereal and possibly add nuts.

I thought these were pretty good - kind of gooey, but quite tasty. I made them pretty much exactly as written. I used light corn syrup, and creamy peanut butter. For the cereal, I figured 2 cups by volume was correct; by weight would have been a lot! My only hitch was the icing; my butter wasn't softened enough to mix, so I microwaved it a bit. I wound up pretty much melting the butter instead of just softening it, and the icing wound up way too spreadable for my taste, even on the leftovers in the fridge a day or two later. If I make this again, I'll make sure to just soften the butter, in order to get a thicker icing. But overall this was a great dessert.

Very good...do not over heat the sugar/syrup mixture or you will end up with dryer krispy treats. I add a square of chocolate to the frosting instead of cocoa powder and it turned out great. Will make again.

I sent these to my husband in Iraq, and he told me that these got gobbled up before the rice crispy treats did. I'm glad I doubled the recipe! I wasn't picking up the peanut butter flavor as much as I liked so I added an extra half cup. I also used melted semi-sweet chocolate chips for the icing rather the what the recipe calls for since I didn't want them to go bad in the mail. I've since been asked to quadruple the recipe and send them again very soon.

This has been a favourite of mine for decades!    I've always just melted one bag of Milk Chocolate Chips instead of an icing.   I store them in the fridge so they don't get my fingers sticky while eating them.

Yummy! I just made this today and I can't stop eating them! They came out nice and chewy, love the texture. I used half the butter called for in the icing. I put the squares in the fridge for about 15 mins to help the icing solidify.

What a nice treat! This was a very quick and simple recipe. I found the icing hard to smooth out but I used my majic bullet to mix together and it came out smooth. The only problem I had was that I did not solidify, still was pretty runny even after it sat for over an hour. I also tasted the butter heavily, next time I make them I will use 1/2 the butter called for. Overall, easy and tastey snack.

A good dessert but way too sweet for me. No problems with the recipe and it came out perfect - just a personal taste difference.  I thought the recipe would have a stronger peanut butter taste but would recommend this to anyone who wants a dessert that is so sweet it's candy-ish.
