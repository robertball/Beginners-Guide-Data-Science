I modified the receipe after reading other reviews here that its a bit bland. I added in pepper and parmesan cheese to the cauliflower; salt and baking powder to the batter. Turned out well and my kid loves it!

I enjoyed this dish, and I followed the directions. But the batter didn't coat it like the image. I will definitely try this recipe again because it was delicious regardless!

Got something very similar to this at a local fair, decided to try and make it myself, and loved it. I just found that if you planned on making more than 7-8 you would have to use 2 eggs Andi 2 tablespoons of oil to batter them all. Also, salt is better put on afterwards. Other than that, loved it, and it wasn't hard to make.

My mother used to make fried cauliflower for us.  However, she used bread crumbs.   I use seasoned bread crumbs, omit the flour and add a homemade seasoned salt to the egg/milk mix without extra oil.   If you need to avoid salt, then use a no-salt mix instead and that should spice up the taste.

Just tried this recipe and it was very bland, not any flavor at all.
