This recipe is awesome!  Such great flavor!  Only complaint is that it only made around 3 sevings.  Next time I will double the recipe as I like to have extra and freeze individual portions.

Very good recipe.  I made it twice.  The second time I doubled the lemon and added 2 cloves of raw minced garlic to the soup right before I pureed it.  The garlic and extra lemon give it a nice kick!  Also, I like putting a little sour cream on top of each bowl of soup, instead of olive oil.

This recipe was wonderful! I made some changes to the original recipe, varying only slightly. I substituted shredded butternut squash in place of the carrot, and I curried my lentils before adding them with the broth. The curried flavor really carried over well through out the simmering, and the texture was really nice when I used an immersion blender on the whole soup to get everything blended very fine. Overall, I prefer to blend everything rather than leave parts of it chunky. Thank you for the recipe!

Excellent recipe.  I didn't really like lentil soup until now.  I didn't have tomato paste but it was still outstanding without it.  What a wonderful healthy & economical soup to serve with some crusty whole grain bread & salad.  Love it and will make again!!!

The best lentil soup I have ever eaten--definitely restaurant-quality.  I added 2 large potatoes and 3 stalks of celery.  My six year old who will not eat onion or celery scarfed this up.  When I told her what was in it, she said that she was mistaken, she does like onions and celery after all.  In answer to one reviewer, yes you can make this with the green lentils.  The lentil is versatile.

This soup takes the cake! It's awesome, and I am not a huge lentil fan! I'm a vegetarian, so I replaced the chicken broth with vegetable broth which worked out well. Also, I didn't have any tomato paste on hand, so I just used a little ketchup in it's place. Turned out beautifully! Thanks.

I love the flavor of the soup. It's quite filling and a wonderful comfot food on a cold autumn evening. I use the immersion blender and I think it over-purees it. But I haven't tried it any other way...I keep doing it the same.   I also freeze it in individual servings so that I can carry it to work for lunch.

Very good, very easy. I'm not big on cumin, but it was good in this. I forgot to put the cilantro in, didn't miss it. The olive oil and freshly squeezed lemon juice really perked up the flavor nicely.

I reduced the olive oil to 1 TB, for sauteing the onions and garlic (which I upped to 4 cloves because I love garlic and some other reviewers complained of blandness), because for health reasons I need to avoid fats and oils as much as possible. I omitted the final 4 tsp of olive oil added at the end entirely. And despite that, this was delicious! So anyone who needs to reduce their fat intake can feel safe reducing the oil called for in the recipe, without fear of ruining the recipe.

I made this as written. It is so simple and flavorful. I live in the Detroit area, surrounded by places to get Middle Eastern and Indian food. My husband and I eat both often. We were amazed at how this recipe is the closest I've been able to get to the flavors we love from some of our favorite eateries. He even said that it was the best soup he's ever tasted! Once, I accidentally added double the tomato paste and used some thicker lentils (round green ones.) It resulted in a chili consistency. Thought it would be very good on baked tofu or chicken.

I wanted so badly for this soup to be grand, but instead I found it bland. I used the right ingredients and followed the directions.  Unfortunately, it was boring. It might have been the brand of stock I used.  I ended adding more chili powder and some soy sauce to bring out the flavor.

I had some lentils to use up, and I was reminiscing about a yummy Greek lentil soup I had at a restaurant. I found this recipe and it sounded similar. I was thrilled! I pureed most of it, and served it with warm pitas. So healthy, filling, and economical. The only substitutions I made were chicken bouillon for the broth, and I omitted the tomato paste (didn't have any). I have also frozen individual portions for later enjoyment. Thank you for the great recipe. I will definitely do this again!

This was the first recipe that I used for cooking lentils for the first time and it was great!!!  I highly recommend this recipe.  The only changes I made was only due to lack of ingredients at home and I didn't want to go out and buy more ingredients.  I substituted the 1 tablespoon of tomato paste with 4 tablespoons of crushed tomatoes, replaced the chicken broth with boullion cubes with water therefore reducing the salt to less than 1/4 tsp.  I used 1 1/2 cups of green lentils.  I used a pressure cooker and cooked it on high to the second ring and let it naturally release until it reached the first ring and then quick released the pressure.  If you have a pressure cooker, I would definitely recommend using it since it will cut the cooking time down tremendously.

This was my first time making lentil soup. It turned out really good and i love the taste of the cumin and lemon. It reheats well too so it's perfect for lunch.

Fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderfully.  It reminds me of the lentil soup I've eaten all over the middle east.

I love lentil soup and this recipe didn't disappoint.  Easy and quick to put together with little need for a shopping list.  

I agree that the portions are small and made the following adjustments:

1) added a 14oz additional can of chicken broth  
 stretch it some 2) added more spice "to taste".  3) I also did not blend any portion of the soup and left it chunky/broth style 4) used the juice of an entire lemon (could have used more) 5) used 2 carrots.

Easy breezy recipe with great flavors.  What a great addition to the recipe box!

Best Lentil soup recipe I've ever had.  Our grocery didn't have red lentils, so I took a chance and tried it with green lentils.  It was still excellent!

We LOVED this!  I've been making lentil soup for years & this is, by far, the best recipe yet.  I was skeptical about the cumin, but it gave the soup such a wonderful, though not overpowering, flavor.  I doubled the recipe, omitted the chili powder & used fresh parsley instead of cilantro.  I let everyone add their own lemon juice, to taste.  Served with warm naan bread & a side salad.  Delicious!  I'm getting rid of my other lentil soup recipes & sticking w/ this one.

Great recipe!  I've cooked the lentils and onions separately before, but this is the best way. So much flavor!  I doubled the ingredients, skipped the cilantro, and used juice from a fresh lemon.

I was looking for a way to love lentils and I believe I've found it with this recipe.  Very easy and very tasty...a new comfort food standard for me.  I loved the texture of the soup without the bother of having to puree it.  Didn't have tomato paste so I simply added a can of chopped tomatoes and it turned out great.

My husband wasn't feeling 100% and wanted an alternative to my usual chicken soup.  I found this recipe after a quick search and made it that evening for dinner.  I have to say this was sooo easy to make & my husband LOVED it and I did as well.  I have already given this recipe to 5 of my girlfriends.......    : )

Delicious, healthy and filling! I used ketchup since I was out of tomato paste. I also took advice of another reviewer and added curry powder...yum!!!!   I only had brown lentils and I omitted the extra EVO and chilli powder at the end since it was so wonderful as it was. Turned out great!

i love lentils and I use them in  a lot of dishes. This recipe is ok. Nothing terrible but also nothing great. I might make it again if I can't think of what else to make.

This was delicious! In the future, I will double the recipe because there weren't any leftovers.  I may have done something wrong but my soup was very thick. We served it on pita crackers and thought it might make a great appetizer for a party.

Delicious!  The only change I made was sauteing the carrot w/ the onion.  I like the little extra depth of flavor.  Don't skip the olive oil.  It's sooooooo good and good for you!

This was an excellent soup.  I made it exactly like the recipe and then had to go make another double batch because we all wanted seconds and there wasn't enough!

I LOVED this soup. I used a little dried cilantro in the cooking. I also added a little water since I found it too thick. I pureed the whole soup. It was creamy, lovely colour, and delicious. I will make it a staple soup.

Wow.. mmmm!!!  So as I read this recipe quickly (it looks and IS super easy), I accidentally added one WHOLE CAN of tomato paste.  Whoops!  Didn't realize it until halfway done cooking.  So I just added another can of chicken broth to balance it out.  I also added from fresh minced ginger and curry powder.  YUM!  I know I messed up while making this, but the end result was fantastic.  I should screw up more often.  ;-)  Also, I omitted the cilantro (didn't have any), and topped off the pureed soup with a dollop of sour cream with the splash of lemon.  Zesty, healthy (except for the salt content of my concoction, I would presume) and so very tasty!!!

***** Made according to receipe, excellent with tons of flavor and good appearance.  Cilantro is a must as is addition of oil & chile powder on top prior to serving.  Served with splet/sunflower crusty bread.  Hubby said could not get better in a 5 star restaurant.  This has already made it to my soup receipe box!

Tried this recipe and me and my husband simply loved it. Although I didnt have any broth and I used water instead, still turned out great. I made it a little more soupy as we both like it light.

Absolutely delicious!  Try tasting it just before you add the lemon juice so you can see the difference it makes.  It intensifies the soup's flavor without adding an actual lemony taste.   I decided not to bother with the extra work of pureeing the soup.  I had diced my carrot fine and liked the hearty texture of the tiny pieces of carrot and lentil. I also didn't bother with the olive oil garnish since I didn't think this would add much except for extra calories

Delish!  I didn't follow this totally as written -- used ginger, curry, cumin, coriander, salt/pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg to season -- no cilantro.  Topped with sour cream blended with lemon juice/onion/garlic/coriander/cumin.  Yum!!

This recipe is a keeper. It has a wonderful flavor. I couldn't find red lentils on my only stop so used brown lentils that I soaked for an hour before starting the soup. I drained them before adding with the broth. I made as written except added the cilantro leaves and lemon juice to the third I ran through the blender then poured back in the soup pot. No need to use a second pan or chop the cilantro this way. Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe! (Please don't overfill a blender container with hot liquids. I stick to 1/3 of the container just to be safe.)

I left out the cilantro because I didnt' have any, and I would recommend leaving the lemon juice on the side for each person to add themselves.  I found it a bit too lemony, but my daughter ate 2 bowls! Great recipe!

This soup was amazing. The flavor was great. I didn't have any cilantro, so I can't wait to taste it next time I make it with cilantro added! I added 2 stalks of celery to it, as well. The only thing I would suggest to do different is to cook it a little longer than the 30 minutes. The veggies were crisp tender and the lentils were still a little crunchy. But the flavor and texture was great!!!

I as well found this to be bland, although it is a good starting point. I used 2 cans of goya lentils (15.5 oz each), drained, rachael ray's beef stock, and added 2 envelopes of goya's ham seasoning.  Was delicious with my customization - both my 6yr old and 18 month old enjoyed it!

By the way in a process if you want to add a little bit more liquid - don't. Just follow directions.

I rate this as a four only because I think five should be perfection and equal to the best thing I ever tasted.  
My first run on this was excellent.  Really wonderful.  And everyone else loved it, too.  

On my next run I will add a touch more chili powder and perhaps cumin... my personal taste.

Overall, a fantastic recipe.  It is now in fixed on my menu of great dishes.  I'm certain I'll make it regularly.

Thank you for sharing!!!

Wow....awesome soup. Agree with previous reviews, the lemon and cilantro are the "BAM" of this dish. Did add a can of diced tomatos. Served with Spicy Grilled Cheese Sandwich (also from this site) for a perfect comfort meal.

I've made this soup a few times now, and it has quickly become a family favorite. The lentils make it a hearty soup, excellent for cold weather, but the lemon and cilantro lighten the flavor up a bit so it doesn't feel too heavy. It also reminds me of some of the best soups I had when I lived in Turkey, and those folks know what to do with a lentil, so this is very high praise! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was phenomenal! I taste tested it after it had been simmering about 30 minutes and some of the lentils were still firm, so I simmered another 10 minutes before testing again.  At that point I went ahead and added the lemon juice, saving the cilantro as a garnish as some in my family don't care for it. I was amazed at the difference the lemon juice made - turning a tasty soup into something out of this world!  We also tried it with a dollop of plain yogurt, as it appeared in the photo.  That was also delicious!  I will be making this at least once a month, as we are already putting dibs on the leftovers.  I am so glad I made a double recipe!  This is one of the best soups I've ever tasted!

You almost had a winner here. You need to increase the spices to 1 t. each and add 1 t. curry powder. Also, it can take 2 cups more water in addition to the 4 c. stock. I have served this to people that "don't like curry" and they go crazy over this soup! I use organic vegetable stock instead of chicken. Our favorite on a cold winter's day up here in New England...

I like that this is a quick fix.  I don't need to soak anything or wait hours.  This recipe also uses stuff I mostly have on hand or in my pantry.  Very tasty!!!  Very good for the diet, also. :)

Outstanding soup. Did it vegetarian, just adding some spicy paprika paste instead of chili powder, used water and some rosemary and curry (to add more flavor as I was not using chicken or vegetables broth), and turned out great. I used to dislike lentils, but this soup made me want to try more recipes with them again.

I was skeptical while making it, because of the lack of seasonings. (To us, these are very small quantities of spices.) I expected this to be bland and to require hot sauce -- but I was surprised to discover that the lemon juice did the trick! We garnished ours with sour cream but skipped the final drizzle of olive oil. I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone who likes lentils; this is definitely my #1 favorite meatless lentil recipe! Thanks for the recipe!

My family said that this was possibly the best thing that I had ever fixed, period! That's even coming from the one that doesn't like veggies, so we will enjoy this often. Paired with Peppy's Pita Bread, this was a real winner.

I made this soup again today and this time for some reason it reminds me of a meatless chili because of the chili powder and cumin. I think when I puree half is the reason. It is delicious with cornbread but definitely puree this soup. Really is good on those cold winter nights. enjoy!

I am normally not a soup person but my wife is. I cooked this soup for her and she claimed it was the best soup she has ever had!

I only deviated from the recipe by not blending it, which I don't see why would you need to.

The is a keeper!

Made this soup yesterday and absolutely loved it! Cumin adds this nice flavor, though I used seeded cumin, not ground. I soaked dry lentils for 2 hours in warm water before putting them in the pot and the cooking time was just under 30 minutes. Thanks for this amazing treat!

This is an EXCELLENT lentil soup!  I would highly recommend this to anyone who doesn't like regular lentil soup.  Red lentils cook a lot faster then the regular lentils.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I doubled it (and I also doubled the lemon and cumin).  Freezes great if there is actually any left!!!

DELICIOUS!! I pureed everything as I wanted a thick and not chunky soup. The only thing I changed was that I added some curry powder and about a teaspoon of chipotle chili powder. That smokey taste gave the soup some really amazing flavor. Definitely a keeper recipe! I wanted to keep eating it long after I was full because the flavors were just so great!

Great tasting and so fast to prepare!  Next time I will double the recipe so we have leftovers.   I served it with a side salad and put a scoop of brown rice in the bottom of the soup bowl.  The rice gave an extra nice texture to the lentil soup.  However, this soup really is 5 star stand alone.

Love this.  When I was younger I was forced to eat lentils one night and vowed I would never eat them again.  I found this recipe and made it for my husband, and now I make it for myself.  The flavor is wonderful, its healthy, and easy to make.  I wasnt able to find red lentils so I used plain.  I cooked it ten minutes longer than recommended ( the first time I made it some of the lentils were still a bit firm) and added a bit more lemon juice to taste.  Its wonderful.

Followed this exactly minus the salt (we use VERY little salt in our house and our tastes have adapted to very low sodium food) and added an extra splash of lemon juice. My husband said he could do without the extra lemon juice, but I loved that little extra unexpected sourness. Either way, we both loved this soup. Very fun twist on the standard lentil soup and we will be making it again and again I am sure.

Delicious--this made a wonderful Christmas Eve dinner, with a salad and dinner rolls.  I doubled the recipe and had enough for five adults plus some to freeze for later.  Really delicious and satisfying.

Delicious; great taste and consistency.  I didn't have fresh garlic, so used garlic powder.  I also did not have tomato paste, so I used sun dried tomatoes packed in oil with herbs.  The cilantro added a nice touch!  Even my kids who are picky eaters went for this one.  Thanks.

I am not sure what I did wrong, I followed the directions exactly. I ended up with not a lot of liquid when I was finished. When I began to puree it, it was thick like baby food. It might be my error, but I am turned off enough to not make again.

Fantastic! My husband kept asking for lentil soup, I have never tasted it. I fixed this exactly as the recipe says and it was so delicious! He loved it. Will be making this again and again. *Doubled it to have leftovers to freeze.

This soup was hearty and delicious.  I'm always looking for healthy recipes so my husband and I don't get tired of eating the same things.  I'm definitely adding this one to one of our favorites.  I like the addition of the lemon juice and cilantro - it really gives this soup an extra kick.

I doubled the recipe and made this using curry powder  instead of cumin and chili powder (since the curry powder has cumin and chili in it).  As others have suggested, I used vegetable broth and added two potatoes cut into small cubes.  Results were delicious.  Thanks for this very flexible recipe.

Great flavor, but I found it to be too thick after pureeing.  Next time, I think I'll leave the lentils whole.

I loved it!  It is a very good soup.  I added lime juice instead of lemon.  The lime and the cilantro added a welcomed freshness to this healthy and flavorfull soup.

Nutritious and delicious.  Halved fresh lemon juice.  Omitted chil powder.  Recommend adding celery and using spice(s) other than cumin.

Absolutely wonderful!  There really is no need to mix this in a blender once you're done cooking.  If you cooked on medium heat most of the recipe, the beans and liquid just start breaking down itself.  Fabulous recipe!

My very first try cooking lentil soup from scratch and it turned out pretty good. Only thing I will do next time is cut back on the amount of lemon or not add at all. I tasted it before adding it and after and feel the lemon is a bit much. Maybe 1/2 the amount would do nicely, although I feel it tasted best without it.

This soup has delicious flavor. Warm, aromatic with a hint of bright herb, acidity and spice, but not spicy hot at all. I only blended half of it. Served it over basmati rice with toasted pita bread on the side and got a big thumbs up from both my 2 and 5 year old daughters! The hubby and I liked it very much as well.  Thanks for the recipe!

Hearty & healthy.  This soup is a nice change of pace from the usual selection of soups.  I used just a 1/2 tsp of cumin and that was plenty.  Also, I didn't think the soup needed to be drizzled with olive oil before serving; all it needed was a small dollop of sour cream.

This was REALLY good although I did alter it a bit and fogot a few embellishments.  Going off one reviewer's option of squash, I added a small yam and pureed it with everything.  Then additionally AFTER pureeing, I added 2 cooked cubed potatoes.  I also added 1 Tb or so of currry.  I completely forgot the lemon juice, cilantro and yogurt and my family LOVED it!  I will definitely try it again with the last ingredients on top but I think the yam really added a nice, sweet flavor and we like chunky potatoes in indian food.  Anyway, a definite keeper!

I didn't have the patience to blend this  but I did make it with all the seasonings and additions in the orignal recipe. I let it simmer for 30 minutes (as suggested) and it was wonderful. My husband and I finished the pot before the end of the night! This blends together just right!

This was delicious and so simple to make. I never cooked lentils before partly because I had no idea how easily they cook. Followed the recipe with only one exception- used no salt at all- and it was still super yummy. This will be great staple to the DASH dieting we are implementing in our household. I can see using also this recipe as a foundation that could have a lot of variation added.

Awesome! Deep flavor and the cilantro and cayenne powder add a subtle kick. I added chopped mushrooms in with the carrots, which came out great. I also used lime juice instead of lemon. I didn't do the puréeing step at the end and the texture is perfect. Definitely don't worry about that if you don't want to wash another appliance like me :)

I didn't have tomato paste, and I skipped the blender step. This soup was heavenly. It was very simple to prepare and was ready to eat in 45 minutes. I made it two servings by cutting the lentils to 1/2 cup, still in 4 cups of liquid. One serving came out to 179 calories, with 11.6 g protein and 12.6 g fiber. I am extremely impressed with this one! Thank you for posting it!

Good as written but slightly under spiced. I added another half teaspoon of cumin and a half teaspoon of chili powder.  Sodium levels in this recipe are sky high so I used home made chicken stock with (no sodium) and home made chili powder (also with no sodium) to make it more healthy.

Awesome recipe! Made exactly as written, except replaced chicken broth with veggie broth. It was a bit thin, so next time I might add 1/4 cup or so more lentils for a thicker final product. Incredibly flavorful and very easy & fast.

Just had this tonight. So hearty and delicious on a cold winter night. Thanks for the tip on doubling it-it was good enough that I wanted left overs for tomorrow. I pureed half the soup and stirred it back into the remaining non-pureed soup. Loved it a little chunky. I replaced the cilantro with 2 tablespoons of flat leaf parsley. 
Will definitely be making this again. Thank you for sharing such a flavorful recipe.

This soup was delicious.   Even my 12 yo son who doesn't like anything liked it.  Definitely a keeper.  I did double the recipe based on the reviews and am glad I did.  I also didn't use any tomato paste or add cilantro because I didn't have any.

Excellent soup. Just made it for dinner. I made it more or less true to the recipe. Except I added spices to my taste and used whole cumin that I grounded with black pepper. Came out great - flavorful, rich, spicy.

I followed the directions exactly on this, the only exception is that I could not find red lentils at the store, so used the usual kind. It turned out wonderfully, the flavor is reminiscent of Indian cuisine, which we love. It did not even salt at the finish to bring out the flavor, was quite delicious as is.

This was my first time eating Lentils! And it was so good - i loved the creaminess from doing the blender thing and the flavor was wonderful. Added a little coriander powder.

Amazing recipe!!! Other than omitting the carrot due to dietary restrictions and simmering for 40 min. instead of the suggested 30 (as per other reviews), I followed this exactly as written. Thank you for sharing this wonderful dish!

Yum!  I had to use green lentils (actually they just said "lentils" but they were more greenish tan in color so definitely not red.  Turned out great!  I forgot to put in the lemon juice but we still loved it.  Bumped up the chili powder and the cumin by about 25% was the only change I made.  Nov 8 2011

This is an excellent recipe.  I'm leaving a review because I had to use brown lentils and it changed the cooking instructions.  I prepared everything as directed but with one cup of brown lentils instead of red.  I had to simmer the lentils for an additional 25 minutes, bringing the total cooking time to 55 minutes.  I put the entire batch in the blender and pulsed a few times until it was smooth but still a little chunky.  I then returned the soup to the pot and added one cup of hot water along with the lemon juice.  The finished soup came out very thick and wonderful but it only made two dinner-sized servings.  Next time I will quadruple the recipe.

There is something about this soup that is so good.  Being vegetarian, I used vegetable broth and used 1 teaspoon dried cilantro powder instead of fresh cilantro.  Otherwise made it as stated, with red lentils.  I think the spices and lemon juice (I used juice from half a lemon) make this soup so wonderful.  I'd recommend doubling it; this recipe will last 2 people one meal. I'd like to try adding a diced potato next time.  Thanks for the wonderful soup recipe!

Loved this soup - the lemon juice made it really special.  I wanted to add some potatoes next time I make it, so that it would be a little more filling, but my husband doesn't want it changed at all - he said it is perfect as is.  Next time I will make it just like this again!

This was a good soup.  I didn't think it was amazing or anything but it was good.  I used 2 cans vegetable broth instead of a carton of broth and it was soupy enough for us.  
I think next time I'd add a little bit more spice to it and maybe even some more lentils so that it is a little bit thicker (personal preference).

Fantastic soup, only change I made was using veggie broth rather than chicken broth (I'm a vegetarian).  The flavors came together nicely and it was a filling lunch for a chilly sunday afternoon. Thanks for sharing!

I have made this soup dozens of times.  I occasionally add a bit of red pepper, if I'm in the mood for something spicy.  I do not blend the soup because my husband prefers it a little chunky.   One of the many reasons this soup is great is that I almost always have the ingredients on hand.   Both my 4 & 7 year olds like this soup.

I just used regular lentils, not red and it took close to an hour for them to be soft. I didn't drizzle olive oil on top or sprinkle with cumin. It was outstanding. The flavor was complex...very interesting combination. I used the Kitchen Basics brand of chicken broth, my favorite. This is a very healthy, cheap and easy recipe and I highly recommend it.

This is delicious!  I had to make a few alterations because I didn't have everything.  I used one tamarillo (tree tomato) instead of tomato paste, veggie broth instead of chicken, one sweet potato instead of a carrot, and I didn't use cilantro or oil to drizzle or the pinch of chili powder, plus I used a little less broth than called for. First I sautéed the onion for a few minutes, then I added the sweet potato.  After about five minutes I added the garlic and spices and sautéed for another three or so minutes. Finally I added the broth and put a cover on it.  It cooked a lot faster than 30 minutes, probably only 20 and everything was cooked enough to eat.  I decided to pureed it all instead of leaving it chunky.  In the bowl I put a squeeze of fresh lemon juice on top. We were both very pleased with the result. I will definitely make this again!

I'm so glad I found this recipe. It is easy to prepare and bursting with flavor. I simmered the lentils an extra few minutes and used the dish as a side dish and topping for sweet potatoes instead of serving it as soup. Fab!

Pefect Recipe, needs no altering.  Everyone in my house loves it including the children.  Love that I can make this soup earlier in the day(BEFORE the kids get home from school) refrigerate it and whip it back out at dinner time.

very simple and quick, and absolutely delicious! The first time I made it I used yellow squash instead of carrots, and it was fantastic. Second time I followed the recipe *almost* and used carrots, and same great result! The second time I also doubled it, used 1.5 cups lentils, and added a couple potatoes, as I liked the recipe so much I decided to serve it to guests.

Very good meatless lentil soup. I did not puree the soup, I like it more chucky. The chili powder gives it a nice kick.

Very nice.  Cooked too hot though and so need to add more liquid next time.  Also forgot the lemon and cilantro first time I ate it and it tasted fine still.

This has become a favorite=) And it was very easy to make! The only thing I did differently was add more garlic. Thanks for the recipe!

We had this soup for dinner one night this week and loved it. The ingredients play very well together. We served it with homemade breadsticks. Thanks for a great new recipe!

Absolutely delish!  Used my own chicken bone broth for the base.  The lemon (I love lemon!) makes this dish.  I did not have fresh cilantro, but used the type that comes in a tube.  I also used chipotle pepper vs chili powder and the spice was just right for our family.  Excited for my supper tonight!

Excellent soup!  I doubled the amount of garlic and tomato paste and used half chicken broth and half water.  Added a diced stalk of celery and little cayenne pepper at the end.  Even bettter the day after.

Amazing how simple ingredients can come together and make such a complete healthy and satisfying meal. I love lemon and I'm crazy about cilantro, so I added probably double what the recipe called for. Make sure you add salt last, if not your lentils will be hard, so it's good that it's included in the recipe. I also didn't blend the soup because the lentils broke apart naturally and it looked good to me so I left it as is.  I didn't have cumin or chili powder, so I used curry and cayenne. Surprisingly it also worked well in this soup! Im very pleased and proud to have made this and will be making it again! My husband also enjoyed it which made me even happier. ^_^ the four servings are very generous, you could probably even get 6 servings easily out of this. Depends how much you eat ;)

Added a splash balsamic vinegar instead of lemon juice as garnish-upped the flavor.  Turned out tasty but not too spicy.  I blended most of soup but left a little chunky for the texture.

This soup is amazing. I have made it several times. The chili and lemon give it a fresh and vibrant flavor. I haven't used cilantro because  I don't seem to have it on hand when I make it. I do add a little but mor chili powder and lemon because we love those flavirs but the recipe as written is *****

This was fantastic! I didn't use the olive oil, I just used Pam in a non-stick pan. I also used ketchup instead of tomato paste since I didn't have any. I had the olive oil to drizzle, but didn't use it as it was perfect without it. Incredible!!

Delicious! Followed the recipe except for the cilantro which would be tasty but not necessary, the fresh lemon I squeezed over my bowl really made it! I squeezed half the lemon over the pot of soup but tasting my bowl I thought it needed a touch more added directly to my bowl of soup, it was perfect!

A great starter recipe. I would give it 5 stars but I did use/add a lot of items and spices: 2 spicy sausages skin removed and chopped, several teeny tiny potatoes from Trader Joes, 1 can of top notch canned tomatoes whole (just cut them in the pan as they cooked), a tsp of sugar, 3 10 oz package  of Kale plus 1 10 ounce package of spinach, cayenne and Hungarian paprika, extra salt as needed, also used chicken stock cause that's what I had. Super healthy and good. as recipece says use what you have on hand-so sure I did.

Very tasty!  For us it's better as a chowder or side dish.

We made the following changes:  saute onion, garlic and carrots over medium until very tender.  Add about 1/4 tsp. curry with spices and use marinara instead of tomato paste.  Only use 3 cups chicken broth so it's a bit thicker rather than soup-like. No olive oil or extra chili powder to finish just cilantro & lime juice.  

N - with sour cream
C - with grilled chicken and naan.

This is my go-to soup! I use ketchup whenever I make it so I don't have to buy tomato paste. I use vegetable broth because I'm vegetarian. And I skip the olive oil drizzle and chili powder at the end; I don't find that it needs it. Very minimal changes that I doubt change the flavor very much at all. I find that it takes less than 45 minutes to make, and it's a piece of cake to make since 30 of those minutes it's just simmering! I use an immersion blender at the end to get it to a consistency I like. My boyfriend and I gobble this up every time!!

So delicious! Great flavor and very filling. Our only complaint was that I didn't double the recipe. Next time I will leave more chunks for texture as well per my husband's request. Even the baby enjoyed her serving (without the lemon and cilantro). It's a "keeper."

I did not have very high hopes for a lentil soup recipe, but this was overwhelmingly delicious. I followed the instructions exactly but for using brown (green?) lentils instead of red. The lemon juice and cilantro are key - do not skip those! Even my carnivore husband enjoyed it and he generally only approves of meats. Excellent recipe and very healthy as well. We will be making this again and again. Perfect for a crisp fall day!

The taste/texture reminds me of split pea soup. This is really delicious. I cooked this for some vegetarians and everyone enjoyed. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken. It's a keeper!

I tried this about five years ago, and loved it so much I probably make it several times a year. I found the blender step unnecessary. Too messy. Delicious flavor, so good for any time of the year!

Made without tomato paste and in a pressure cooker with a cook time of 9 minutes after cooking onions and garlic. Also thought I should have doubled the recipe.

I have made this several times now and it is excellent - unusual and refreshing, yet still filling. The only change I make is adding a little extra lemon juice and omitting the drizzle of olive oil when serving. A little shredded lemon zest on top when serving looks great. Now I always make double amounts and it freezes well - although it is usually eaten up by the next day.

This recipe did not turn out how I thought it would. With that said it was wonderful. As other reviewers mentioned the consistency was closer to a hummus rather than a soup. I did use brown lentils instead of red lentils. Maybe that changed the consistency. My husband thought it tasted similar to the lentil dish that is served at an Ethiopian restaurant we eat at. My husband thought it turned out great despite the consistency. Definitely serve with some sort of bread. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious. Used dried cilantro toward the beginning rather than fresh at the end, "better than bouillon" vegetarian "chicken" broth, and a bit more cumin and chile powder and water. Forgot to purée and add the lemon and we scarfed it down before realizing it - then, for the small bit left I did so and couldn't believe it got even better! Doesn't make enough - will definitely make again and double or triple it. Yum!

I like this. Used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth because we're vegetarian.  To make the broth more like chicken broth, I added two tablespoons nutritional yeast.  Despite the cumin and chili powder this doesn't taste like a Mexican dish.  This was even better the next day.  My picky 4 year old really loved it and he barely eats anything that isn't chicken ;).  I didn't puree any of it, and it was great anyway. The lemon really adds to the flavor and you don't really need the cilantro, though I'd imagine it would be great with it too!

ITS THE LEMON!!!  I've been making lentil soup for years, but this one takes the cake!!!  I took another reviewers advice for ketchup in lieu of tomatoe paste, used both chicken broth and vegetable broth, with good results. Have made it several times now, using a variety of leftovers (mini-potatoes, leftover squash, tomatoes, chopped carrots, brocolli, etc), with excellent results. Have increased liquid, not bothered blending...its all good!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was great! I've made it twice now. The first time I accidentally used a whole can of tomato paste, I happened to be doubling the recipe. It was still really good, although I couldn't taste the lemon. The second time I made it as is and liked it even more! No need to blend any of it, it gets so soft anyway. I made it for friends and they thought it was great, too!

This won 1st place in a lentil contest! As a dietitian I give this recipe to all my clients who want to try lentils and it is a staple at home. Definitely garnish with sour cream instead of oil,  as another reviewer suggested. It is rich, flavourful, and hearty. I double pepper, garlic and cumin and 4x chili powder. (I always use no sodium broth and add salt to taste) Everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe.

Love this!  This is the first time I have tried cooking lentils and I really loved this recipe.  I am making it again today.  I added all of the ingredients to my slow cooker and cooked it that way.  I did not need to blend any of the lentils. I think cooking it in the slow cooker made it thick enough.

I love this recipe.  It is so great and is easy to make.  I double the recipe and skip the blender and pureeing.  I serve the lentils over rice and it makes a great, healthy, and filling meal.  My boyfriend also loves it.

Very tasty and easy to make! Followed all the directions except I substituted ketchup for tomato paste and omitted the cilantro completely. Next time I will puree less so it'll be more chunky.

This soup is amazing!! thanks for the recipe. I didn't have chicken stock so I used 6 cups of water and 2 chicken boillon cubes. I used an handheld blender. The cilantro really gives it a nice zing!

First time rating anything but I had to. Absolutely devine and flavorful. Didn't have tomato paste so used ketchup and didn't have cilantro. Didn't need it but I could see where it would be a nice addition. Doubled the lemon juice actually half was lime. Wish I had made more. Used regular green lentils and it was still good. Will def be making again and again. Not sure who posted this had no flavor. You are dead wrong. Awesome soup.

I doubled the batch when i made it, using chicken broth & veggie broth.  I also added about 2 cups of diced potato (boiled before adding them to simmer 10 min at the end), and then blended the soup lightly before eating.  Yum!

OH  MY GOODNESS!  I can't even describe how good this soup is. The only thing I changed was the chicken broth: I used vegetable broth instead because hubby is a vegetarian. I say double the batch and freeze it.  I could eat this everyday day.

For my first time ever having homemade lentil soup, I thought it was pretty good.  I doubled all the ingredients and that gives you enough to either freeze a few containers or lunch for a few days. If you like lentil soup youll like this.

Loved the soup. It was easy to make and my husband, who is a great cook loved it also. I made homemade crutons and doubled the recipe.  Reminded me of the restuarant style lentil soup only better. Also had enough to bring to my in laws who raved about it. Definitely will make again.

What a great recipe!  It's not often that I find one that I don't have to alter at all.  I did make a few additions, based on taste and what I had available.  I used a can of original Ro-Tel instead of tomato paste and cumin, which gave the soup a nice kick.  I also pureed the onion/garlic/tomato/carrot mixture after it had cooked and before I added the chicken broth and lentils.  Then instead of pureeing the lentils, I added a can of pureed black beans for body.  What a hit!!

I was too lazy to chop the onion , mince the garilc or even peel the carrot , so i cooked every thing together in the same time by adding all the ingredients to the pot( except the topping ) I  halved the onion and the cumin and added one ripe roma tomato and I mixed the whole soup in the blender.

I have made this recipe several times and love it. Yesterday I started cooking and realized I didn't have any carrots, but I *did* have a sweet potato. It ended up tasting wonderful! If you're looking to change it up, substitute sweet potato for carrot!

Really good, despite not addin carrot....I doubled the tomato paste and chopped up 1 tomato. No need to puree. I like my soup nice and chunky. I add some red pepper flakes for a little spice, and top it with cilantro and lemon juice.

Let me just say first that i realize this review isn't entirely fair...  When i try a new recipe, i try to stay with how the author intended it to be - just for the first time and then i tweek it after.  So, i stayed true to the recipe and it was good but i just couldn't get past the chicken broth (i'm a vegetarian but can on occassion deal with meat broth - not in this case, unfortunately).  So, i decided to try again and use vegetable broth instead.  Also, i tried a masala mix i had instead of the cumin and LOVED this!  That's why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because, chicken broth aside, i much preferred it with the mixed spice blend than just the cumin.  Overall, really wonderful and will be adding this to my list of favorites - my 3 year old even loved it!

awesome soup.  I suggest doubling it as it doesn't make enough for 4 people.  I also think that the soup is great even if you don't blend it.  Just make sure you dice the onions and carrots before cooking.  Also added extra cilantro, lemon juice and chili powder the second time i made it.  This made it even better!

I thought this soup was fantastic and so did my carnivorous boyfriend. Very simple and perfect amount of flavor. I used chicken bouillon instead of chicken broth, used 1/4 tsp of chili powder and pureed the entire batch. Thanks for the new staple soup recipe.

I've never been a huge fan of lentils but this recipe has completely changed my mind. I always follow the recipe as written the first time out. I wouldn't change a thing, for me it's perfect as written. Accompanied by some cornbread it's the perfect supper for a gray day.

This is delicious! The flavors are so fresh. Sometimes lentil recipes are heavy and lack imagination. This one is different. I followed the recipe as is, with the addition of others’ suggestions to add extra lemon juice. I added another tablespoon. One additional tablespoon would have been fine, too. I also would double the recipe next time. This makes four average size servings. If you want generous portions or leftovers, double it. The sour cream is a delicious addition - don’t skip it!

The lemon really made this soup...gave it a nice bright flavor. I was out of carrot, so substituted sweet potato, added extra garlic and some chopped celery.   For some extra vitamins, I tossed in some fresh spinach leaves right before serving. Cut up some pita bread I had - put some olive and sea salt on it, toasted it up in the oven and severed along with the soup. Delicious! So good I gave some to my neighbor who gave me his lemons!

I started making this soup for myself and found out quickly that my baby LOVED it! I now make it in batches and freeze it in ice cube trays as a super healthy and filling meal for both of my children. I usually leave out the cilantro because I never have it handy but it’s good both ways.

This soup tastes exactly like a Turkish soup I had many times while living in Istanbul.  The combination of the cumin, garlic, onion etc. is wonderful. Adding freshly squeezed lemon at the end is also the Turkish way!  Each person is served a lemon wedge or two with this soup. Wonderful stuff.

Fantastic recipe as is! It doesn’t have much spice to it, so added red pepper flakes to individual servings as desired. Will definitely make this again and try adding a jalapeño.

This is delicious!  I made a different red lentil soup last week and was very disappointed so I tried this one.  The cilantro is enhanced by the salt so be sure to salt to your own taste. The amount of chili powder was fine although some may want to add more at the end.

this soup was REALLY tasty.  I pretty much followed the recipe other than adding about a stalk of diced celery  after sautéing the onion and before adding the liquid.  I also used a bit more broth and did not add salt until the end-- to taste. I used the immersion blender (much easier/cleaner) .  The lemon adds great flavor and do not skip that step.  I've made lots of lentil soups and they were all decent, not great.  I would call this one the exception to that rule.

Both my boys and I loved this soup. I added a lot more cumin and chili powder than indicated in the recipe and it was perfect. This will be a regular addition to our dinners, but we will have to double or triple the recipe - this only makes 3-4 bowls of soup. Good for an appetizer but not a meal - especially when you have teenagers!

We liked this, but I did add more chili powder than called for.  I used 16 oz of whey and 16 oz of chicken broth, but still added another 16 oz of broth because the carrots weren't done and too much of the liquid had evaporated. Will make again like this.  Good for you and not too fattening!

This soup is delicious!!! I did add a stalk of celery in with the carrots and I doubled the recipe. I also used white lentils. Finished it off with a dollop of sour cream and fresh cilantro for some color. An excellent vegetarian soup but next time I might add some crumbled bacon and shredded cheese on top. Served it with honey cornbread. The perfect complement!

I just had a bowl of this very creamy soup and it was fantastic. I didn’t have chili powder so I used paprika instead. Delicious and very filling.

Delicious! I have tried lentil soup at several restaurants and NONE comes close to being as good! Tried w vegetable broth as my daughter is a vegetarian and it did not change the taste. Double the recipe... it freezes well, too!

Delicious but best the next day when all of the flavors gel.  Go light on the salt so people can season to taste.

This was excellent.  I used low sodium vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, and skipped the carrots (didn’t have any).  I’ll be making it again.

This was a good soup. I wish the lemon added more spark to it though. I think I could have done better by adding dates and nuts.

This lentil soup is absolutely delicious! I was drawn to it  because it includes lemon and cumin.  For the most part, I followed the recipe, but since I wanted to make enough to freeze, I ended up using a mixture of vegetable broth and chicken broth since that's what I had on hand. And I had to use dried cilantro. It's hard to imagine a better lentil soup. Thanks for sharing, Jodi!

I didn't blend the soup, and I put in 1 tsp of chili powder.  Other than that I pretty much followed the reicpe.

The carrots aren't done when the lentils are, so I put them in the broth and simmered for 10 minutes before adding the lentils.  Oh, I used extra carrots too since I wasn't going to blend, about 3 large.

The lemon juice absolutely makes this dish.  I put in the zest of 2 lemons at the beginning, then juiced both and added all the juice at the end.   Delicious!

I made this once for 4 and the second time multiplied by 60 for a church lunch. I followed the recipe the first time and didn't like how much the tomato paste overpowered the other ingredients. The second time for 250 people I substituted crushed tomatoes for the paste and left out the lemon, cumin and chili powder and everyone raved at the richness and flavor of the soup.

This soup was easy to prepare, quick to cook, and delicious!  The result was a creamy yet full bodied soup and I found no need to use a blender to add creaminess.  I did stir in a handful of baby spinach when I took it off the stove.  We also omitted the last drizzle of olive oil at serving.  Serve with Naan bread for a perfect meal.  The soup was even better the next day!

This soup is fantastic. I come back to it time and time again. I usually use homemade turkey stock (we make a huge batch every year after Thanksgiving) and it makes this so very flavorful. I sometimes leave the tomato paste out (I hate to open a can just to use one tablespoon) and sometimes I don't puree any of it. No matter what I do, it turns out great.

Great lentil soup!! Easy to make and lots of flavor. I added a little extra lemon and put in 1/4 chili powder instead of 1/8. I blended half the soup in a blender and left the other half untouched. It's a great texture and so yummy! My mom loved it too.

Yum! Delicious recipe - I've made it twice.

I tried substituting 2 parsnips instead of the carrot and put in some extra spice. I also used vegetarian broth. 

I plan to make this again :)

I omitted chili as hot food is not my thing, and added some parsley along with coriander. It's absolutely delicious, definitely doing it again!

This simple soup is delicious! I didn’t add any of the chili powders it called for but it was all very tasty. My family loved it. I also didn’t realize the first time I made this it was with yellow split peas and not actually lentils.... tasted great none of the less. I’m making it again but will now go half and half with lentils and split peas.

Made this recipe exactly as given, except no cilantro. Upped the size to 1 1/2 times all ingredients, i.e. 1 1/2 cups red lentils, 1 1/2 quarts of broth, etc. Turned out great, and filled kitchen with a pleasant aroma.

This soup is delicious as is, and easy to adjust to your tastes.  I doubled the recipe, was very generous with the spices and added some turmeric.  I also included chopped celery with the carrots and some diced leftover ham after blending the soup.  I used lots of freshly squeezed lemon juice.  So yummy!

Mine always comes out super thick, but that's fine, as I like to eat it with rice as a meal, without pureeing it.  I add in fried eggplant chunks when I have them leftover from breakfast (husband is Turkish :) ).  I think potato chunks would also be great.  I sprinkle red pepper flakes instead of cilantro ( I like cilantro, but like this better without it). Paired with a salad, it makes a great dinner.

Delicious. I didn't want to use just half of a one-pound package of lentils, so I increased the volume of everything to accommodate an entire package. I thought the lemon might be too much, but it helped the recipe by making it more piquant. Recipe is good with a bit of smoked pork thrown in.

I’ve made this several times and it never disappoints. It’s delicious! I made a couple changes to the original recipe. I use 2 Tbsp. Olive oil to sauté the onions and garlic. I usually use green lentils because I can’t find the red ones. I use the exact spices and their measurements and use the tomato paste in the squeeze tube so you don’t waste the rest of the can. For the vegetables, I usually add an extra carrot, a stalk of celery, and sometimes a sweet potato. I’ve made it where I’ve puréed half and also when I haven’t puréed at all. Sometimes I forget the cilantro on top and don’t use the extra olive oil either. I usually put a spoonful of Greek yogurt on top. This is the ONLY recipe for lentil soup I will use now and I’ve been making lentil soup for years experimenting with other recipes.

This is a super-tasty hearty soup! A meal in a tureen! I just have to play around with the recipe as I didn’t have everything listed. For instance are used diced tomatoes as I did not have tomato purée. Used more garlic then called for that’s because I love garlic obviously!

I made this as a weight watchers soup. One serving is equal to one point with the new freestyle program. I used cooking spray instead of olive oil and I added celery in with the onions. I also added cubed chicken breast into the soup at the end. It was a very filling and hearty meal, delicious and satisfying. I didn’t feel like I was missing out on any of the oil. I highly recommend this soup for someone who is looking for a light and tasty recipe.

I have made this soup several times, it's delicious. Excellent recipe. The first time, I made it exactly as written. It is excellent as is. The next couple of times I changed some things up to personal taste, (as cooks do) for anyone that's interested in that:
 I used 1/2 coconut oil 1/2 olive oil to start.
 I add either a head of chopped kale or spinach between steps 1 & 2.
I double all the spices.  
At the end with the cilantro & lemon juice, I add 2 cloves minced garlic.  
Next time I think I will add a dash turmeric, dash cinnamon,  dash coriander.  
For anyone that can't do cilantro (my Dad can't), the cilantro here is key, but if I had to sub., I would try parsley or perhaps Thai basil. 
Thank s for the wonderful recipe!

NOT JUST FOR VEGANS! But, it can be if you substitute vegetable broth. Our family absolutely loves this recipe! I’ve made this for friends and i’m always asked for the recipe. I usually serve it with homemade peasant bread. I’ve also been known to use a teeny tiny amount of cilantro essential oil when I don’t have fresh cilantro on hand and we use Himalayan pink salt to top off the bowls.

I tweaked it to my own taste by adding a pinch of curry with the cumin and chili seasoning. Salt and pepper. I did not have tomato paste so I added maybe 2 tablespoons of thick tomato sauce (from the small Goya can).  I probably added 3 cloves of garlic (minced from the jar).  Used Vegetable Stock.  After it simmered I took over half of the contents and pureed in my mini blender and put back into the soup.  It made it creamy but with still chunkier pieces.  I omitted the lemon and cilantro because I wasn't in the mood for those flavors.  Really liked it.  Will make again.

I made this as it's written.  After I tried a bit, I believed it was just great but a little...empty?  So I put dashes of cayenne, cinnamon, cardamon and ginger.  Per the recipe, adding the fresh squeezed lemon juice, olive oil and cilantro completed this lovely soup.   I tripled the recipe in hopes of having enough for a family of 12. Thankfully there will be other food but it looks like a lot of soup.  This is a fantastic recipe!  Next time I will add a few more veggies to make it even heartier, like cabbage, celery and cauliflower, mostly because it would be easy to hide these in this soup for people who won't eat them normally!  Yippee!!  (I gave it four stars because I did add a few more ingredients. I used chicken bone broth and added additional salt as well.)

Original review 2017: I've made this recipe many times over the past few years, and I just love it.  My picky kids will even eat it without complaint.  It is very hearty and great leftover. Definitely don't skimp on the lemon juice at the end.  It really makes it pop!

Updated 03/11/19: I've now been making this recipe for at least 4 years! I love to double it and have enough for a week of lunches. I find that I consistently double the carrots as well as the cumin.

Another great soup!  I have a lot of red lentils to use up, and this was another good use of them.  The lemon balances it out.   Like another reviewer said, it doesn't make a lot, so you might want to double it.  Try it for something different.

Super quick and easy to make.  I like it a little spicier, so I added some cayenne pepper.  I used an immersion blender to blend it smooth.  It smelled so good and I was so excited to eat it, I forgot to add the lemon.  Love the earthy flavours!

This soup was very delicious! I will be making this often. I omitted the tomato paste and cilantro, because I didn't have any on hand. I substituted bone broth for the chicken broth.  I did not puree the soup. I found the texture of the soup wonderful as is.  The lemon juice really brightens the taste.

Delicious! My search for a go-to lentils recipe has finally come to an end! The only changes I made were to add some coriander and to use lime juice instead of lemon juice (because it's what I had). I love the lime and will do it again this way because it goes so well with the cilantro.

Even my 3-year-old gives this recipe a thumb's up. The only change I made was to add an extra can of chicken broth and some chicken bullion. This soup has fantastic flavor, it's filling and healthy, and it's affordable to boot. It's a win-win-win-win. Thanks so much for sharing it :D

I loved it, I opted to omit the carrots, and not use as much chicken broth. I prefer my lentils at a thicker consistency so that I could eat them with brown rice. I added an extra garlic clove delicious!

Pretty good. Will probably make again. Followed the directions but added a little extra carrot and made it in my intend pot pressure cooker. Cooked on high for 15 minutes.

This soup was quick enough for a week night meal and very tasty. I wished it had a bit more lemon flavor. We served it with naan, but next time it would make a great side for kababs or another main dish.

I had some red lentils leftover from another recipe I made and was looking for a way to use them and found this recipe. I didn't expect to much from it but was pleasantly surprised. I loved this! However, as another reviewer mentioned it doesn't make much. I would definitely recommend doubling this recipe.

I have been using this site for awhile and found some great recipes. But this is the first time I felt compelled to write a review. I'm not a vegetarian fan but was trying to eat more vegetarian for health reasons. This is sensational delicious and amazing. Not just for a vegetarian soup but any soup. I'm officially addicted. Suggest more fresh cumin and lemon than the recipe calls for.

This is the ultimate healthy comfort food. My husband makes it exactly as written (he doesn't puree all of it, we like it a little chunky). It is soooo flavorful!

This was a very nice and easy soup to make! It's a perfect choice to play around with. I'm a big fan of lemon so I added more than twice as much. I also added twicw as much cilantro.  I chose not to puree it, I like chucky type soups. To keep the fat content low I didn't add the extra olive oil at the end. I will try it with veggie broth next time for my vegetarian friends. This recipe will definitely be in my go to file!

Surprisingly tasty! 
It seemed silly with such simple ingredients, but this is the best lentil recipe I've ever made. I thought there must be an error with the amount of spices. It seemed far too sparse, and I almost doubled the spices.  I ended up following the recipe exactly simply because of the rave reviews. the spices ended up being just enough to flavor the dish without overpowering. A great balance. Delightful!

This was a delicious dish.  To make it vegetarian I substituted the chicken broth for Vegetable broth.  Next time I may try adding a potato or two to thicken it up a bit.  However, it was perfect just the way it is prepared!

I'm a newbie and this is literally one of the first things I've ever made from scratch and I loved it; it was easy, had great taste and texture and slight heat.  I messed up dicing the onion but used the pieces that were too big to put in the blender and no one was the wiser.

I love this soup. It has become part of our regular meal rotation. I do tend to add considerably more cilantro (we are big fans). As well, I will substitute lime for lemon juice on occasion for a different flavour.

a popular canned soup company used to make lentil soup with pasta, and I loved it.  Then they stopped making it.  I made this recipe pretty much as listed, in my pressure cooker for 20 minutes, and put it on elbow macaroni and it was fabulous!  Even if the canned version is released again I won't even consider it, this blew it out of the water!

This is a wonderful soup! My brother gave me a large amount of cooked lentils, so I did save time by adding about 1 1/2 cups of those and just heating for a few minutes (worked great).  Before that, I cooked the chopped carrots in the broth mixture just until they were tender. I didn't feel like pureeing any of it, and the texture was perfect. The lemon really adds a nice, fresh taste. Great on a cold, late fall day! Thanks!  (This doesn't make a large amount, but it's perfect for 1 or 2 people with some leftovers. You may want to double the recipe for 3 or more people.)

It was okay. 

Granted, I approached this recipe with great hope and exceptions, imagining the great taste of my work place's Thursday lentil soup. It's a soup so delicious I crave it every week - a good job for a small cafeteria that isn't allowed to cook directly on place.

So, high expectations. I was disappointed with the first taste as it didn't live up for what I had hoped and thought it'd taste like. It wasn't bad, really, I did finish my bowl and am gonna save the left-overs. But it was kinda meh. Perhaps it's due to me doing this recipe for the first time and the knick of seasoning hasn't falled into place just yet.

I do think it can grow on me if I get it another go and play with the seasoning, this time around I stuck to the recipe truly. 

All in all a warm autumn soup that was okay but could be better.

Very tasty!!  Used my stir stick instead of a blender to puree to smooth with a hint of  chunkiness consistency.  Spices and tomato paste make this very savory.

Absolutely delicious!!! I quadrupled the recipe and since I'm no fan of cilantro I just used reg parsley.  Also messed up by adding all ingredients at once and it still rocks!  I don't really measure and it still came out excellent!  I'm a vegetarian slash part time vegan.. Veg stock or broth works just fine.. You won't go wrong with this recipe!

Very good. changes I made: a little more (1T) lemon juice. added about 1/2 t curry powder, per other reviews. Also added 1 14oz can of chopped tomatoes b/c I always put tomatoes in my lentil soup! Could use some heat, so offering hot sauce (siracha, habenero, or tabasco) on the side. Also, chopped up some ham to add to bowl as desired.

I usually make my lentils with Indian spices, so this lemon flavor is a great twist. It is easy to throw in additional veggies if have them on hand.

This recipe has become a staple in our house!  I make it as written but usually triple it so we have some left over - the original recipe does not make enough for our family of four. I use a hand blender and just zip it a little bit - the consistency always turns out great!  Do not leave out the fresh lemon squeezed over each bowl - delicious!  Fantastic soup for lunch or dinner, on its own or with a crunchy fattoush salad, winter or summer..we love it!  Definitely give it a try!

Super delicious but does require additional seasoning. I added curry powder, turmeric and coriander, and that helped a lot.

Delicious!  I used green lentils as that was all that I could find in the store.  Pureed with immersion blender.

Excellent!  The first time I made this I cooked the lentils* in the broth before sautéing the onions and garlic with the spices.  By the time the onion and garlic were cooked and fragrant the lentils were already soft and about 2/3 cooked through.  I added the spiced onions/garlic to the lentils and cooked for another 10 minutes or so.  The lentils were soft and falling apart to the point that I did not need to blend or process at all.

Tasty! I added a touch more chili powder, skipped the cilantro (can't buy it here), and served with lemon wedges. Definitely double or triple this recipe.  Thanks!

Fantastic!  The whole family gobbled it up.  I loved the touch of olive oil and lemon at the end.  I didn't have tomato paste (used ketchup) or cilantro and it still was great.  I can't wait to try it again with all the ingredients.

The flavor is perfect! I'm American and my husband is Turkish and he went back for seconds, that's a big deal! Adding the lemon is a must, wasn't just right until the two tablespoons of lemon juice.

It was okay, but I've had better out of a can.  Next time, I would double it and add some chicken or smoked sausage.  Maybe swap out paprika for the chili powder.  I did feel like this recipe needed to cook longer...maybe 50-60 minutes, or longer.    I added some sumac which enhances the lemon.  Be sure to serve with some crusty bread.

Very good.  I used a package of the cooked lentils from Trader Joe's and three carrots instead of one.  I couldn't bring myself to puree any of it, because I didn't want to get something else dirty! ;) Kids liked it!

Yummy! I recently had red lentil soup at a local Mediterranean restaurant and absolutely loved it. So, I wanted to find a replica recipe I could make right at home -- without having to pay to go out to get it and THIS is definitely it!  It was just right, without being overpowering in flavor. I didn't follow the pureeing the recipe recommended, only because we're in temporary housing and I don't have a blender at my disposal. However, when I get my kitchen back, I will definitely be pureeing the broth, garlic, and onions before adding the lintels and carrot. Also, I will be pureeing half the soup after lintels and carrots are made as suggested, which will help with thickness and cut back on it being too chunky. Because, it is. The only adjustment I might make to the recipe itself is to omit the lemon juice again (as I did this time) add a touch more cumin, as tasted just right, but needs just a touch more flavor. To add more, I will also let the lentils cook at least 45 minutes to an hour next time. They were fine, but I like mine to be a little more soft. Will be making again and serving with hot naan bread to compliment!

This recipe is very similar to the recipe on the bag of red lentils that I bought at the local halal market. I doubled it and used my own homemade chicken bone broth. If you use homemade broth, it needs more salt than is called for in the recipe, but if you're using store bought broth (which is what it calls for), then it probably doesn't.  With the recipe doubled, I used the juice of a whole lemon and in place of fresh cilantro, I used dried. I liked the serving suggestion of sprinkling chili powder over the individual bowls, but with bone broth, it does NOT need a drizzle of olive oil.  I'm sure that if you use the boxed broth, it would really benefit from it though. Instead of transferring half the soup to a blender, I just used my immersion blender right in the pot, and only ran it a couple of times to keep it slightly chunky. It was perfect. My family loved this, and I will definitely be making it again.

When my husband saw what I was making he asked if we were becoming vegetarians. He's the kind of guy who likes meat with every meal. Let's just say he went back for seconds and so did I! I didn't make any changes to the recipe as I like to give the original recipe a try first. It was so good I really don't think any changes are necessary.

Needed something, but after adding an extra 1 tsp cumin it was so good. Loved how easy, cheap and hearty it is. At 25 minutes lentils were already very done, will check at 20 minutes next time. I (like others) sautéed carrot with onion to make sure they were fully cooked. We did not need to purée it; texture was good. Thanks so much!

Made this with my partner and we both loved it. Only change I made was to add a half teaspoon of cayenne. I would make this again in a heart beat. Planning to bring it to next potluck I go to. I don't usually like soups and was skeptical but risked it and don't regret it at all.

Seriously delicious! I will make this again and again. I followed most everything according to the directions although I had green & brown lentils, not red and since I am vegetarian I used vegetable broth. I left the cilantro optional as some here don't care for it. I believe I cooked it longer than stated but maybe that was due to the type of lentil? No problem, cooked until tender. The fresh lemon elevates the taste. Mmm…  Lentil Nirvana! I paired it with warm naan and it was even more out of this world!! Thanks for a truly great recipe!

Very good basic recipe...5 stars with the changes I made.  I doubled it, added 4 stalks of chopped celery and more carrots. I used a little less cumin and added a teaspoon of Garam Masala and less cilantro. Used brown lentils, which is what I had in stock, and I cooked it for over an hour. Also, didn't puree it or drizzle with the extra olive oil. Delish!

So easy and hearty. Added smoked sausage but it's fine without. I put a bunch of chopped cilantro in while hot and used fresh cilantro as topping per bowl. Served with buttered crusty bread. Love this and so did my husband who hates lentils. Will be a winter go-to!

A very good change!  We enjoyed the soup.  I added 1 cup of corn at the end, and my daughter added a whollup of sour cream to the top of hers.

My favorite lentil soup of all time ! And I have made different kind of lentil soup in my life, with green, yellow or red  lentils, .. with or without meat, chunky or smooth,..
This one beats them all ! 
The amount in this recipe makes 4 small servings, enough for 1st course. If the  soup is you main course, it would be just enough for 2 people.

This soup turned out amazing, but I did make a few changes.  I added the entire can of tomato paste and nearly tripled the cumin and chili powder.  I think it's important to use fresh squeezed lemon juice and liberally.  It was delicious!!!

One of our favorite dinners. I'd only had lentils once or twice before but was looking for something different and got lucky with this recipe. The only problem is that my husband never leaves me any leftovers for lunch!

This recipe gave us a little different take on lentil soup. It was very thick, so I watered it down. I also substituted some fresh parsley and basil for the cilantro. I also used a homemade vegetable broth rather than chicken broth.

I made this exactly how recipe was written, with the exception that I used dried cilantro instead of fresh.  It was absolutely delicious and needed little to no extra salt to season each bowl.  I kicked it up a notch by adding a dash of red cayenne pepper to individual bowls and wow!  Really truly a great recipe, no need to tweak it at all.  My 23 year old, who is not really big on lentils, tasted it and right away packed up a bowl for her lunch at work!

Delicious recipe that even my 10 month old son enjoyed. Another reviewer recommended adding soy sauce and more chili powder. Specifically, I added 1/2tbsp china lily soy sauce and doubled the chili. I'd say 3 servings is more realistic for our tummies to feel satisfied.

This is a great basic recipe.  I wanted to build on it a bit and give it more Indian flare. In added a teaspoon of cumin seeds and 1/4 teaspoon of black mustard seeds and let it fry (and the seeds pop) with the onions.  I also added some ginger and fried it along with the onions and garlic.  Add a few curry leaves and a pinch of asafoetida if you have some!  So yummy!

I completely forgot the lemon, but it's a HUGE hit here! I always double, since were a family of 6, so I just used the whole bag of lentils, 1 massive onion, and 4 carrots. My 5 year old was halfway through his second bowl before he even realized I had given him a roll at the beginning of dinner! 

Thank you for this new staple!

This was okay. My husband felt like it was too plain. I didn't add anything too it because so many people felt it was good the way it was. Not flavorful enough for us.

I have made this recipe several times, always doubling it, and it's excellent every time - a big hit with guests.  I've tinkered with the spices a bit (usually adding a pinch of celery salt and a pinch of cayenne, and some granulated garlic) too, but if you want to take this recipe to a whole new level, forget about the olive oil drizzle.  There's an amazing oil from Morocco that's becoming more available called ARGON OIL!  It has culinary and other qualities that border on amazing!  Gourmet stores might have it, or you can order it online.  It turns this soup recipe into something you'll never forget.

Perfect!!!!!

This is easy and so delicious. I tried 5 different vegetarian recipes today from allrecipes and this was the best one. It was so easy to make.

I doubled the recipe.  I also added some curry powder and some ginger. I also added a little bit more chilli powder and lemon. But this recipe is spot on even with no alterations.

I was a little resistant to making this soup. I am not a huge lentil fan. This soup was so good! I would definitely double the recipe next time and possibly add more vegetables. I think that kale and celery would be great. However this recipe is fantastic just as it is! Personally I think that cilantro makes it!

Delicioso!  I made it today. Wife said it was even better than her version of Lentil soup. Yeah!  I made more than double the amount in the recipe. I added celery about 2 cups, a can of diced tomatoes and a 13.6oz can of coconut milk which added a bit of texture / creaminess. I didn't puree it because we like the whole veggies, But I will try it with a portion of it. It's a knockout recipe.

I make this in batches to feed 50 people. I don't measure anything and I make it much less thick. Also I substitute barley for the rice. Everyone loves it. Every time. Even the meatiest of the meat eaters ;)

So so good and surprisingly full of flavor for being so healthy. I am a veggie so I substituted no sodium added vegetable broth. Also I loved the consistency after lentils were cooked and skipped the blender step to keep it thick. My new favorite dinner thank you!

I’m trying to eat more vegetarian meals and learned that lentils are a good source of protein.  Came across this recipe thinking it would be good for my work lunches but not so much as a family dinner.  So wrong!  When making it one afternoon the family smelled the aroma and swarmed the kitchen.   After a taste test by all they decided they wanted it for dinner instead of what I already planned.  Served it with naan and everyone loved it.    

To make the meal go further I added extra carrots and a few small Yukon gold potatoes.  Also added curry powder and hot Indian chili power in place of the regular chili power.   Next time I will double the recipe to fill up a family of 3 and to have enough leftover for my work lunches.   Definitely a keeper to add to the weeknight meal rotation.

This is a great base recipe for a delicious soup. I halved the chili powder so it wouldn't taste like chili, used a cup of salsa fresca instead of tomato past, added 1 tsp turmeric, and a stalk of celery and a handful of chopped baby beets. We used yogurt instead of lemon juice. SO GOOD and freezes well!

Very flavorful! 5 star for taste, but one less because it is way more than 8 servings!  More like 20 or more.  I added another 32 oz. of chicken broth to make it more like soup. Even without the added broth the serving size was much higher than 8.  Will make this again definitely!

This is my first time making lentil soup and it came out great! I used veggie broth and use tomato sauce instead of paste. I also omitted the extra olive oil, cilantro and chili powder at the end. I will definitely make again.

ATTENTION LENTIL SOUP LOVERS! Try this recipe! I make this recipe at least once a month ( I double it and freeze some for later) and it's better each time I make it.  Everything is important from the amount of carrot to the dash of chili powder at the end...don't cut corners! This soup is amazing the way it is.

This is absolutely delicious!!  I have never really been fond of lentils because of the texture, so I blended the entire thing and was very happy with the result.  I had no chicken stock (and I only use homemade) so I used water and a very good chicken bouillon.  It took 3 to make it tasty.  I added bay leaves and a spoonful of curry as well.  I will not use the drizzle of oil because it is fabulous and I don't need the extra fat.  I will freeze what's left for later.  Wonderful recipe

This is so yummy! It reminds me of the first time I had and fell in love with lentil soup in Cairo! Don't need the tomato paste or the stuff at the end (lemon, oil, etc.). I did make it with 1/2 red & 1/2 green lentils. I couldn't stop eating it, it was so good! Definitely will be my staple lentil soup! Realistically, it makes about 3 servings.

Delicious! I used vegetable bullion and it was very salty so you may want to wait to salt this until the end. Otherwise I thought it was delicious! Thanks for the recipe! Oh, and I used green lentils.

Easy and delicious! I didn't have tomato paste as my pantry needs some restocking, so I used some pureed roasted red peppers which was a delicious substitute! Otherwise I made as directed, blended with an immersion blender. I'll definitely be making this again soon!

I have made many a lentil soup in varying styles and this one is for sure a winner.  I made the recipe exactly as stated and it was excellent. Similar in style to Mark Bittman's lemony lentil soup in kitchen express but more rich in flavor.  This recipe takes a bit longer but still super easy.

This was SO good!  I added the following: extra cloves of garlic, some curry powder instead of cumin, turmeric powder, and a dash of nutmeg. I also increased the lemon. I increased overall amount by adding one pound of lentils with two 32 oz cartons of broth plus one 12 oz can of broth.  Next time I will cook the rice separately and add at the end as a garnish.

So easy and delicious. Tip: if you love fresh cilantro but never seem to use a fresh bunch before it goes bad, just freeze it!  It's perfect for this recipe and keeps its full flavor.

My first time cooking lentils. This recipe is a great starting-off point. We don't buy chicken stock, just use Better than Buillion and adjust the salt. I doubled everything except the onion and added celery, kale and fresh ginger. I had a "curry spice" from Trader Joe's, which had cumin, ginger, nutmeg, onion, garlic and chili - I put about a tsp of that, also. I messed with it, added more water, kept tasting, kept messing with it, and the soup adjusted amazingly. I added a tsp or two of sea salt towards the end, with more spices in a bit of water. This recipe is pretty hard to mess up. The lentils cooked down to pretty much mush by the time it finished absorbing the water (as in, the leftovers), but it's just as amazing regardless. 
Tried this a second time with chicken stock (regular sodium, since my husband will avoid food without salt). Left out the kale and added ground chicken basil sausage. Didn't need the lemon because I tossed in some whole ginger and let it simmer. Had to add cinnamon to cut the tart of the ginger flavor. Skipped the cilantro and tomato. Oh yum. I think I officially declare now that lentil soup is the best soup I make.

My wife and I both loved this.  I used brown lentils as but everything else was per instructions.  Wonderful subtle lemon flavor.  Not super spicy, but easily restaurant quality.  Will make again with red lentils (from local Indian Food market) and see if it is much different.  Thanks for great recipe.

I have made this soup twice.  The first time with brown lentils because that's what I had.  The second time with red lentils.  It was great either way.  I now double the recipe because we like it so much.  It's my new go-to lentil soup recipe; so happy to have found this!

I made this recipe and LOVED IT.  It is just the right balance of flavor and such a healthy meal.  I used homemade chicken stock...and then followed the recipe adjusting the flavor a little to taste for chili powder and cumin.  I highly recommend this soup!

I thought this was good lentil soup. So super easy to make and with stuff I normally have in the house, for the most part. It all fit in a 3" lidded pot, making clean-up easy too. I followed the recipe exactly, just with the spices I did one pinch of them all and 2 pinches of cumin. I find most spices to be in over-powering amounts in many recipes. I also used a combination of no-sodium vegetable and chicken boullion powder, I had left, to make the broth. It didn't seem to be lacking salt. It does only make 4 servings, as suggested, but is fine for lunch or a quick last minute supper with bread or something similar.

Very good! As usual I added way more garlic and a bit more cumin to my taste but even as stated it's quite good. I wish the rest of my family felt the same way so I could make it more, the don't love lentils as much as I do!

WOW. My kids even ate this and I have one picky eater, in particular, who ate it! I think the lemon is the key ingredient. Made it exactly as written. Pureed more than half. Whoa...make sure you have a dish cloth to hold the lid down while pureeing. Thank you for posting!

I was uncertain of this recipe since the ingredients aren't powerhouses of flavor, but, wow, it turned out fantastic.  I like my soups chunky so I didn't puree it and it turned out fine.

I used dried lentils, and naturally they boilded over, and then I thought the soup looked to thin, but I think the biggest problem I had with this soup was when I tasted it: it was so fabulous I wanted to eat the entire pot. Next time I think I will double the recipe!

Very good, paired with naan. I made a double batch but didn't have two onions so I rehydrated some dried onions. Turned out fine. Don't skip the lemon and cilantro! They really make the dish.

Tasted this as this was cooking and it was delicious! Kept recipe as is, but lessened olive oil to a tablespoon. When I added the lemon juice and cilantro I felt the lemon juice changed the flavor somewhat and it wasn't as good (still quite tasty). Next time I'll just omit the lemon juice.

Mmm Delicious! I didn't puree anything and pressure cooked the lentils. Tastes just like authentic daal. Pita bread or just regular bread is a great side to this delicious soup. Thank you Jodi!

Fantastic!  I used Apple Cider Vinegar instead of lemon juice, and omitted the chili powder and Cilantro.  Celery was also added.  I did not puree the lentil as the recipe suggests but just increased the amount of chicken broth.  I increased the amount of Cumin and tomato paste.

SO. GOOD.  My husband and I have a greek restaurant nearby where we love to get gyros, and we also discovered we really like their lentil soup.  However, since we don't have a huge budget for endlessly eating out, this recipe solves that problem.  It tastes just like the one we love from the restaurant, and it is so easy to make!!  We also took Stacy's pita chips, broke them into little pieces, and sprinkled on top, kind of like greek croutons.  Yummy.  I'm thinking I'll make another batch with my leftover cilantro and freeze it.

OMG, this is fantastic!  I was looking for a vegan recipe with lots of protein & tried this.  We LOVED it!  I didn't have tomato paste so I reduced the broth 1/2 cup & added a small can of tomato sauce.  I also added 2 small diced potatoes to help thicken.  Finished it off with a few pulses on the immersion blender.  Serve with warm corn tortillas or crusty bread.  The cilantro garnish MAKES IT.

This is one of the best soups I have ever eaten! My husband made it for our dinner tonight. The only change he made was to use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth to make it vegetarian. I honestly didn't have the highest hopes for this recipe. I thought it was going to be bland or boring, but instead it had a wonderful, tangy flavor. The lemon and the cilantro are KEY ingredients. AMAZING. Next time we will double the recipe.

This soup was great!!!  My husband and I are trying to follow the Eat to Live way of life and this fits in perfect.  I probably doubled the chili powder and cumin and it tasted great.  Also, I did not puree half of the soup, I like it chunky.  I did not feel like washing another dish.

Stumbled ontomthis recipe in my search to broaden my 1yrmold daughters food choices. Used organic red lentils, didn't have tomato paste (and wouldn't use it since it has high fructose corn syrup instead,boiled a whole tomato and puréed it) used two tablespoons of tomato purée. Followed directions, but instead of blending to thicken I simply put it to simmer a little longer 45 min or so on low since I wanted it cremier. Results were phenomenal! My daughter and I both loved it. Will make over and over again. Thank you Jodi!

This soup was delicious, quick and easy. I should have taste tested before adding the second tablespoon of lemon juice, though... I'll definitely use just one tablespoon the next time. This will be my go-to lentil soup recipe from now on and I have a feeling I'll be making it often.

I loved this recipe, to thicken it up and add more vitamins I added a bag of baby spinach and doubled the chicken broth (without doubling the spices).  Blending half the mixture was a great tip and it created a filling and creamy soup.

Wonderful! I added  1 teaspoon each of black pepper and chili powder instead of the lesser stated amount.  Instead of lemon juice, I used a tablespoon of sour cream.  All else remained the same.  This keeper recipe is going into rotation!

absolutely delicious, filling and healthy. two modifications for the next time i make this soup:
1) add more broth, otherwise the consistency is a bit too thick for my liking
2) don't puree all the lentils, maybe just 1/2 to 3/4

This soup is so simple to make and the flavour is so good.  I doubled the recipe and did not add the tomato paste and it was still yummy. I also omitted the olive oil drizzle just to save on added fat and calories.  The fresh cilantro and lemon at the end is perfect.  This is a favourite for sure!  Thank you Jodi for sharing!

This is our favorite lentil dish so far. Everyone from 6 year old to grandma, each with a different taste preference enjoyed this one. Even my husband who is (was?) not a fan of soups or lentils wants for me to make this one again and again. I followed the recipe, but cooked the regular (NOT red) lentils about 15 min longer to soften the lentils and blended only about one-third because of our texture preference. We had it with store-bought naan. Love it!

This is delicious, but it doesn't make much soup! If you're feeding more than 2 or 3, double the recipe. I also cooked the lentils only 25 minutes and they burned! I would reduce the cooking time even more next time. That said, the soup is delicious- very flavorful, and has just the right amount of kick. It's also very filling, and cheap to make!

This is a great recipe and delicious soup!  For those who like spicy, chopping up some fresh green chili's and adding it to the final result might add that extra zing you'd like.  But for those who like it milder, keep the recipe as-is.  If you like Pakistani or Indian food, and are looking for a great soup, have this one.  It's delicious!!

Delicious. I did pre soak the beans for 10 min and rinsed before adding to the soup mix.  Also used an immersion blender at the end. 
Very satisfying. Can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow.

Absolutely love this soup.  Followed the recipe exactly except for adding a little extra cilantro and topping with plain yogurt instead of olive oil and then sprinkling a little cilantro on top along with the chili powder.  My husband and 2 year old daughter devoured this and it was definitely only 3 servings for us.  Next time I will double or triple this delicious recipe!

I have an abundance of dried lentils and usually make the typical lentil soup with ham. I really wanted something different and a new way to eat lentils. I tried this because I had all ingredients on hand and it sounded great. Turned out wonderfully! I followed the recipe exactly which is quite rare for me. I was very please with the results and enjoyed my leftovers the next day:)

Did the soup exactly as listed but then added  two things. I added about two cups of cooked fine noodles, but the big addition was cooked Mediterranean lamb/beef meatballs (equal parts ground lamb and beef, bread crumbs, one raw egg, salt, pepper, cumin and cinnamon, baked in the oven for approx 20mins)

This is a great recipe....As a new vegetarian, I was please with the flavor from this delightful soup.  Instead of chicken stock, I used vegetable broth and added a jalapeno pepper for an extra kick.

This is one of my favourite recipes ever- quick, healthy and cheap.  My boyfriend seemed skeptical that just soup for a meal could be filling, but after trying this one he's convinced ;)  I find this is delicious on its own but I sometimes like topping it with yogurt/sour cream, green onions, extra cilantro, lemon and chili powder.. and bacon. Freezes well too! \perfect for a cold and lazy fall/winter day. Thank you for this recipe!

It's good, but it's just missing something. I used vegetable stock so it would be vegan (I eat meat, I just wanted a meal I could make vegan) and I added in some extra spices. I added garlic powder, onion powder, extra chili powder and cayenne. A friend suggested adding some turmeric, so I will try that. I may do that with one of the bowls of leftovers and try curry powder in another to see what works out best. It really is a good soup, but I have one I love at a local restaurant I was trying to emulate and it fell a little short. It is a good soup, though, so I will absolutely make it again even if I don't get it perfect.

Excellent--4 kiddos even liked it!  The texture was a little different for them but great flavor! I used green lentils and while cooking had to add 4 more cups of water so there was enough for the lentils to continue to absorb and soften..

This soup was fantastic, however I made a few minor tweaks: added twice the lemon juice and substituted plain chili pwd with chipotle chili pwd (for a smokey taste) and added the carrots only 10 minutes prior to the soup being finished to hold their flavour. My partner loved it and I will definitely be making this recipe again.

Made this today. It's absolutely delicious! I didn't change anything (on purpose) but we suddenly had to leave the house just as it started to come to a boil, so I put the Dutch Oven into the oven at 295 degrees while we were gone (about an hour and a half?). It came out GORGEOUS and it is absolutely delicious. I made a double batch. YUM!!! And so pretty.

My hearty thanks for this recipe!  I make this at least every other week now.  My 1 1/2 year old loves it, my husband loves it and he's super picky and I have eaten this for lunch and then again for dinner in the same day it's that good.  I grew up not liking lentils from the soup my mom tried to make but with me being pregnant, lentils are super healthy for me and baby so I tried them in this recipe and I'm hooked!  Instant favorite in our house :)  Thanks again so very much!

after reading many reviews and other recipes I wanted to make sure my soup had enough flavor and here is what I did.  I think the soup came out really good and will make it again.

use 1 1/2 cups lentils, used lots of garlic than suggested at least 8 mediums size cloves, at least a cup of carrots, 2 sticks of celery, added some garden riped tomatoes, used 2 - 3 tsp of cumin, doubles the chili powder, used ketchup instead of paste, tripled the broth ( mixed beef & chicken b/c I had it open) added a big squirt or 2 of siracha sauce, added 1 potatoe chunked big.  I also added fresh baby spinach and broken spaghetti that I cooked separate.  I did keep adding chicken broth as it was cooking to avoid all beans an no broth.  I did puree some of the beans a potatoes for texture.  The lemon and red wine vinegar do bring out the flavors in the soup.

I thought this was very good. Made it as written except added the lemon and cilantro to individual bowls in cases we didnt like it, as it tasted good without too. I loved it my husband didnt care for it. But I am starting to realize he just doesnt care for lentils or cilantro..He didnt care for it with or without the lemon and cilantro but was willing to eat it.

I doubled the chili powder & cumin and added a fresh birdseye pepper to give it an extra kick. I also didn't bother to puree it - I like the chunkyness of the lentils & carrots moreso than the liquid soup version. Overall very delicious, no matter the consistency you choose.

Perfect!  I took this soup to work for lunch so I left out the last drizzle of olive oil and added a bit more chili powder to the initial pot when cooking, but this is my new favorite soup.  Easy, healthy, and delish!

I am obsessed with this soup. It is delicious, easy to make, and great for healthy & hearty meals. I have now made 2 times, exactly as written, with the exception of doubling the recipe (frozen portions for lunches!), and adding a bit more cumin and chili powder (and did not serve with extra EVOO).

Excellent! I've tried numerous lentil soups but this is the one for me. Fresh flavors and nice texture. I may have added more carrot than what was written but still fabulous. KEEPER!

Super easy, used canned lentils and shredded the carrot and it took literally minutes to cook. Didn't have garlic but would definitely add it next time. Love spice so added more chili powder and some chili flakes. Don't overdo the lemons like I did!

Amazing soup!!! I used vegetable broth rather than chicken just because I am vegetarian, it doesn't make it taste any different. Only thing i would do next time is double the recipe to save some for freezing! This recipe is a winner!

Excellent!  I used 1 tablespoon of ketchup instead of tomato paste (didn't want to waste the rest of the can of the tomato paste).  I used  2 cans of vegetable broth (14.5 oz each) to replace the chicken broth.  Added 1/4 tsp of chili powder instead of 1/8 tsp.  Very filling, 4 servings for us.  We served it with home-made bread and salad.

great recipe! My husband likes it chunky so i don't puree any of the soup and it turns out great. Also, i like my soups to have the consistency of a cream soup without the calories, so I add pureed silken tofu to most of my soups. I didn't have the cilantro but it still turned out great. Thanks!

This is a great recipe! I usually double it and freeze some for later.  Just a few substitutions I make:  I use vegetable broth instead of chicken, and I use a can of Muir Glen fire roasted tomatoes instead of the tomato paste.  Sometimes I add a half cup of wild rice in addition to the lentils.  Regardless, it's a very filling, healthy soup!

Very yummy! blending only half the soup really gave it a perfect texture. I will remeber that in the future when making any lentil soup. The cilantro added a really fresh flavor but I would suggest not adding it until the very last minute so that the flavor doesn't get cooked in too throughly. I added some additions that made it very flavorful and quite good. I added gharam masala, cumin and turmeric. It might be too much flavor for some tastes, but I thought it was just right.

Followed the recipe as written and it was delicious. Tastes just like the lentil soup at the local Lebanese restaurant. This will be in regular rotation at my house.  Healthy and easy to make.  Thank you!

Somehow, mine ended up thicker (more like a curry or a Dal, instead of a soup).  I also felt it needed way MORE spices than called for.  But the basic taste was good, so I give this a 5.  We will make this again.

Incredible!! I doubled the recipe but only used 1 onion. I added a little extra of all the spices. I also added a pinch of cayenne pepper. DELICIOUS! Topping with cilantro is a must!

Wow is all I have to say! This is my FIRST time tasting and cooking Lentil Soup and I must say it turned out wonderful! Full of flavor, easy to make, and a nice laid back meal. I made it exactly as the recipe called for. I tasted it before adding the lemon juice & cilantro and it was delish! After adding the lemon & cilantro it was still great. I will definitely be making this again! Thanks Jodi!1

My vegetarian daughter prepared this while searching for protein and it was very good.  Since we didn't have red lentils she used the 'regular' green ones.  She also increased the spice amounts and added curry powder.  Other changes included an extra carrot, one potato, and instead of the chicken broth used veggie broth.  The flavor is amazing the next day.

I skipped the cilantro (didn't have any) but added some leftover cooked acorn squash along with the carrots.  Served it with some fluffy pitas for dipping.  YUMMY!  This is definitely a keeper!

This was yummy. I'm never happy with little bits of cilantro, so I used more than was called for and also added an extra Tbsp of lemon juice. Adding this recipe to "the list."
