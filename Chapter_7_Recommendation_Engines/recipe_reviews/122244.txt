These are amazing! They taste just like curly fries that you would get in a resturant...except less greasy! I LOVED these and would most definetely make them again! The only change I made was that I used Rice Krispies instead of Corn Flakes, just because it's all I had on hand. Phenomenal recipe!

Very good potatoes, although I was afraid they would be too bland for our tastes, as one reader had said, so I gave it a four rating.  I added seasoning salt, fresh cracked pepper, a dash of cayenne pepper, and garlic powder to the crushed corn flakes.  Just before putting them into the oven, I  sprinkled a little more salt and pepper on the tops.  They were delicious, not the least bit tasteless or bland, and both my husband and daughter want me to make them again tomorrow night!

These were so good! Way better than french fries. I made two changes though. I substituted Kix cereal and olive oil.

I really liked these. I made mine with crushed rice chex instead of cornflakes because I was out. I added one and a half time the amount of seasoning and doubled the butter, and the potatoes cooked really well in just 45 minutes, but they were pretty bland. We just ate them with ketchup and they were fine, but I think next time I'm either going to triple the amount of seasoning or just use seasoned bread crumbs for a coating.  Four stars due to the blandness; otherwise, they were great!

I give this four because they were so delicious however I did them as wedges instead of rounds and regret that decision because I was getting too frustrated with the coating not sticking and gave up and coated the rest with italian dressing. How would one get the coating to stick better?

These were very good.  I too used rice krispies and they turned out just fine.  I sliced the potatoes a little bit thinner and they got done sooner.  I will use the corn flakes next time. I put more salt on them before I put them in the oven.

My family LOVED this recipe - firstly, I love golden potatoes.  I feel they are simply the best potato to cook with, so this recipe was right up my alley.  I substituted Rice Krispies and used my own flavor combo for the seasoning.  I will say, I thought I had overdone the seasoning, but after baking it was perfect.  I cut the potatoes thinner than 1/2 inch and they cooked quicker.  They were done in approx 40 mins!!  Will definitely make these often!

Very good and easy recipe! I didn't have corn flakes, so I crushed up seasoned crutons and used that instead still was wonderful!!!

This was a very tasty and simple way to do roast potatoes with a difference. Quite crispy and tender. Followed the recipe exactly.

My whole family couldn't get enough of these! I simply followed the recipe (used crushed rice crispys instead of cornflakes since thats what was on hand)  and added freshly minced garlic on top of the rounds with some salt. 
AMAZING!

I made these tonight and everyone loved them!  My daughter asked how many stars I was allowed to give and when I told her that five was the highest she said "give it five then"!  I followed the recipe exactly other than cutting the potatoes into wedges instead of rounds.  They were still done perfectly in 55 minutes!  This is a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!!!

I needed to cook my potatoes before they went bad,but wanted something simple and different. I have used cornflake coating on chicken, but never on potatos.
At first the cornflakes didn't stick very well, but once I got the hang of it, they turned out really good. I didn't let anyone know they had cornflakes on them till my family ate them all(I always get that "eww" response when they know I cooked with cereal)They couldn't get enough and asked me to make them again. I had to look through 10 pages of potato recipes to find this one at the very end..I guess they do save the best for last..lol

I made this Salmon tonight, and it was very good.  I did change it a bit for our taste.  I mixed 1/8 cup sugar free syrup with 1/8 cup reg. maple syrup.  I also added 1 tsp of jared horseradish.  and then followed the recipe from there.  It really came out wonderfully , and my hubby loved it.  This will definitely  be a keeper for my family.
