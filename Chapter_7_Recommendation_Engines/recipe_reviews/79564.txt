I originally followed the recipe as given, but the dough that resulted was gooey and impossible to roll. In the end, I used 2 1/2 cups of flour instead of 1. The biscuits were not spectacular, but they were good. I like the flavor, which is different from a traditional biscuit, and I plan to keep this recipe and make it again.

I was looking for way to get more veggies in my kids and this is it! I've made them a few times now and the trick with these is to make them as drop biscuits. They come out perfect every time and the family eats them up. I did tweak them a bit for ease and taste in our household though.  I use whole milk instead of evaporated and cinnamon to replace the nutmeg. Thanks for the recipe Crissi!

I found the dough to be gooey as well and had to add more flour.  However, the taste is interesting and I am going to continue to play with this recipe.

My husband loved them, I thought they were just okay.  I would have liked them to be a bit sweeter, but that's probably a result of the wheat germ.
