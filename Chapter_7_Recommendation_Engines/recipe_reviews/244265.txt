These are wonderful and so easy to make. I leave out the raisins (because I don't like cooked raisins) and use a mix of green and black olives. My 11-year-old daughter enjoys making them for the family. We serve them with refried beans and Spanish rice to round out the meal. This recipe can easily be halved. I'm so happy they were featured in the allrecipes magazine!

I do think the filling can do with more seasoning.

Why would anyone leave out the raisins and olives? They are crucial to the overall flavor of the empanada.   And, if you switch the position of the baking sheets betweens racks as suggested, the bottoms won't burn.   I love empanadas with raisins and we put olives (black or green) in our enchiladas too.  Hubby loves them that way.  Our Mexican family makes empanadas differently but I love a change.

Love this! I was apprehensive about the raisins and olives but it was so delicious! I did add a few things to address the "lack of seasoning" that is in other review and I think it was perfect. I added one clove of garlic and two serrano peppers to the onion mixture for a little spice. I also did a dash of paprika and I salted and peppered to taste. The cuman was a little powerful when I tasted the mixture before it baked in the dough but after it was all said and done it was perfect. I used three frozen puff pastry sheets and still had scraps left over but that can be refrozen and used at a later date. 
I used my convection oven on 450 and baked for 10 min before I switched racks and then did an additional 3-5 and they came out golden and flaky. I will absolutely be making these again. THank you for the amazing recipe

Made this for a family gathering. Everyone raved.  I was actually able to prepare this in my airfryer oven.

I made this recipe just today! It was infact delicious, although it lacked flavor. It definitely need A LOT more salt, and I mean a lot. I also added a few additional spices to make it a little more flavorful. Overall, great recipe!

Delicious!

I did make a few edits based my tastes and on the comment section here. 

1 Onion ( two was too much)
1tsp Oregano
2tsp Cumin
3tsp Paprika

I used two Pillsbury croissant packages for the dough  and the portions were right on!

First, the filling is very bland. It definitely could use more spices. Second, DO NOT bake these at 450 degrees for 15 minutes! I followed the directions exactly and after 12 minutes I could smell them burning. The parchment paper was burned up and the empanadas were perfectly golden on top but the bottoms were completely black. I've made empanadas before that were wonderful. These are not.

I added a bit more seasoning and threw in some minced garlic in with the meat. They turned out really good.

I boosted the black pepper to 1/2 teaspoon, and it was great.

Not exactly “juicy” but that may be because I used venison burger. Bottoms needed more time but tops were browned too much to extend time. Next time I’ll cook at a lower temp for longer time.

I followed the recipe, except omitted raisins and olives so Mr Wonderful would eat it. As others mentioned, it needed more seasoning. My experiment turned out quite dry. I think next time I might add Cream of Mushroom to the meat mixture. Overall, a good base recipe.
