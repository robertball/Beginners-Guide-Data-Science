This was fantastic!  Even being a household that can't use cow's milk, I just made buttermilk using 1/2 cup Almond milk with 1/2 tbsp. lemon juice (when using almond milk in cooking, you need to use the Almond Breeze original unsweetened - anything else or any other brands are too sweet and just ruin the flavor of the dish).  The sauce didn't really thicken up much, so I did add a little flour, but it still tasted fabulous poured over the meat with buttered rice.  The leftovers were delicious!

I didn't have a pork shoulder, but the rolled pork roast I had sure looked like one! It had a lot of thick marbling throughout.  I thought I'd try it so I didn't have to make a trip to the store.  It worked and it was a major hit.  It's getting cold here in Ohio, but the Sage in my garden doesn't mind and I was able to use it fresh. We had it with rice and broccoli and apple crisp for dessert.  The sauce for this meat was great. I added a T of brown sugar to it because my hard cider wasn't very sweet.  Thanks for another great recipe.

This is a comfort food classic! I'd purchased a whole Boston Butt when they were on sale and trimmed and cut it into about 1 1/2 inch pieces for the freezer. It worked beautifully. Don't skimp and try to use dried sage. The fresh is perfect. Added some red pepper flakes. Served over mashed potatoes to soak up all the juices.

Made it in an InstantPot using the preselected Meat Button 36 minutes. I cut cubes off off a bone in pork shoulder that was started at 6 lbs, I guestimate my total meat weight was around 4 lbs. I didn't have any apple cider/juice so I substituted lemonade and added an apple and a little honey and BAM it was amazing! Served it with some bbq sauce to give it an extra punch that my on hand ingredients lacked.

This was so, so good! Literally licked my plate clean. Only changes we made were increasing the amount of cayenne and adding some hot Hungarian paprika. We served ours over spaetzle and it was perfect. So nice to find a pork recipe that doesn't call for chipotles, soy sauce, or balsamic.  Can't wait to make this again!

I used twice as much sage and made it the day before I wanted to serve the dish. It wasn't thick enough after adding the creme fraisch, so I also made a roue of 3 tablespoons butter and 3 tablespoons flour to thicken the gravy and added it to the sauce. I made spaetzles using the "Spaetzle I" recipe. I used more water maybe 1/2 cup and a potato ricer to make the spaetzles and fried them in browned butter.

The calendar said the last day of summer but the weather said hello autumn, so I looked for an appropriate recipe to comfort me into the change of the season and I found this staggeringly good braised pork dish. The pork simply falls apart into a sauce that's a bit tart from hard apple cider but made mild with creme fraiche. I spooned it over herbed mashed potatoes with roasted cauliflower and delicata squash on the side. My family, normally a talkative bunch, barely said a word as they all but licked their plates clean. I'll serve this up all fall and winter to family and friends because sharing is caring. Thank you, Chef John, for my new favorite way to cook pork shoulder.

I used deer shoulder instead of pork. Cider did a very good job of taking the wild game taste out of it. I cooked it for 2.5 hours, very tender

This meal was fabulous, but, as I can never -just- follow a recipe, I did add a bit of rosemary and thyme along with the sage as well as just a touch of chicken stock for added liquid at altitude. (At almost 9000 ft, sometimes you need just a bit more braising liquid!) I also accidentally only used 2Tblsp of cider vinegar because...idk... can't read, I guess. I would love to try this out with Guiness and a bit of brown sugar as well~


Either way, my husband thought it was "Probably the best meal I've ever made him" and we've been married for fifteen years and change!

I was not a fan, there was not a lot of depth in flavor, the recipe relies too heavily on the cider to flavor the dish which overall felt pretty one- note.

Made this to use up some apple cider, plus a large pork  roast we'd bought as part of a package at Costco.  It turned out very good.  Was really moist and the taste was good.  I didn't want to go out and purchase any more ingredients, so used yogurt instead of the creme .  That turned out just OK.

My wife does not care for sage so I substituted a quarter cup of fresh rosemary. Rather than using creme fraische I used a good amount of 1% milk then simmered to half the volume and added corn starch to thicken. Definitely not as rich as using creme fraiche but we are watching fat. DEFINITELY FABULOUS regardless. Thanks chef John.

This was delicious! I had a pork loin and  I only had dried sage and regular cider but a good quality cider.  I browned it in my Instant Pot, then cooked it for maybe 8 hours.  I moved the sauce to a saucepan to simmer it down and added half and half to the sauce.  I should have cooked it down more, but it was very good.  I'll make this again.

This is delicious, tender and flavorful and very easy to make.  I do disagree with the number of servings.  I served 3 people and ate leftovers myself twice and still probably have at least 2-3 servings left.  I think it serves 7-8.  I will halve the recipe next time I make it for my husband and I.

I’ve made it twice for dinner parties and it was a huge hit both times. No changes needed.

Wow!   The pork just falls apart, and the sauce is fantastic.  There's just something about the combination of pork and apple.  I added a couple tablespoons of flour to the onions after sauteing them in oil to give the sauce a little body. I served it on Chef John's spaetzle (which has quickly become a family favorite, and frequently requested by my 11 year old son and 6 year old daughter).

This is sooo good.  Didn't change a thing.  I recommend getting/finding spaetzle to have it over.  Makes all the difference.

Followed the recipe exactly, and it is delicious! It's a great fall meal, and pairs well with any leftover hard cider you may have on hand. ;)

I made this tonight because it came up as recommended today when I was looking for a bread recipe. I must have gone very wrong somewhere because my pork was tough as can be. I cooked it on the very lowest setting on the stove top. Maybe I'd try again with a crock pot?
