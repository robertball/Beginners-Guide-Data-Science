Good as tuna Casserole can get.  As others said very economical.  I sauted 1/2 an onion, 1/2 c. celery chopped and about 1/2 tsp. garlic.  Then added it to the casserole as I thought it was bland without.  I also decreased the noodles to 10 oz. and added a 2nd can of tuna.

Had to make a lot of adjustments to make this one a keeper, so only 3 stars.  Used less noodles, 3 cans of tuna, 1 cup sour cream instead of milk, 1 1/2 cups cheddar, 1 tsp. garlic powder, a dash of worcestershire sauce, a jar of mushrooms (fresh would have been better), and baked the mixture at 375 for about 20 minutes.

This was great.  I did change it a little tho.......I added about 2 tsp. cayenne, used a little more milk than called for, and only about 2/3 of the package of noodles.  I also added some onion powder, garlic, mushrooms, and a little finely diced red onion.  While I was cooking the pasta, I added the butter, peas, onion, and mushrooms to a pot and simmered.  Then I added the cream of mushroom soup, milk, cheese, and seasonings.  I simmered this while I was finishing up the noodles.  Once the noodles were done, I added them, and simmered it all for a few.  Then I put it in a casserole dish, sprinkled the top w/a little more cheddar, and some italian breadcrumbs, and broiled until brown.  It was an awesome tuna casserole for someone who likes things w/a little more spice.

Used this as a base and tweaked like a few other reviewers. Added some worchestershire, paprika, garlic salt and onion powder. I added an additional can of tuna and an additional cup of cheese. Very cheesy and creamy sauce. Also topped with bread crumbs and a little butter and baked for 30 in a 350 oven. Thanks for sharing!!!

Here are my changes, similar to other reviewers:

-Add one more can of tuna
-Use the sharpest cheese possible
-Add at least one tablespoon worcestire 
-Spice with salt, pepper, cayenne (A LOT), and paprika
-Use a 16oz bag of vegetables (make sure to adjust cooking time to compensate)
-Double the milk to make the sauce more creamy

The result: 4 meals that I take to work during the week for lunch. This saves me quite a bit of money. All from one pot! :)

Made this last night and it was great!!  I love to cook - but sometimes no time to get fancy.  This was filling and very tasty.  I altered things slightly: 16oz egg noddle, 1 can mushrm soup, 2 cans of tuna, 1 cup sour cream (to replace the milk), 1-1/2 cups fresh shredded cheddar, can baby peas, tsp garlic powder and dash of worchester.  The best was the finale!! Covered top with crunched up Cheez-Its crackers  and baked about 10-15 minutes.  Small green salad on the side!!  GREAT weekday supper!  Yum

We first tried this recipe when we were starving... so we were obviously going to be hard critics.  We changed recipe slightly, adding 2 cans of tuna, 2 cups mixed veggies (- lima beans) a little less cheese. Also we used rotini and egg noodles... VERY YUMMY.. we will make it again..next time we will add sour cream :)

Not bad....improved greatly for me when I cut way back on the noodles, added extra cheese and milk, and doubled the tuna.  Sprinkling onion-ring toppers on it and crisping it all up in the oven didn't hurt either.

I only made one change and that was using frozen broccoli instead of peas. I think this could be better--the kids thought it was okay but my husband and I didn't like it at all. I think the butter could be cut back and it could use a little more milk, another can of tuna as well as some sauteed onion and mushrooms.

I gave this 5 stars. How could I not? Its a great base. I added salt, pepper, paprika and Worcestershire sauce to the cheese / tuna soup mixture. I also changed the milk to sour cream and added 2 cans of tuna. Oh and I went a little heavy on the cheese. I made this all on the stove top and instructed but then when I was 'done" I transferred it to a casserole pan and covered the top with seasoned breadcrumbs and baked it at 400 for like 25 mins. It came out so tasty and my boyfriend loves it. I have another tuna casserole recipe and honestly its more work and maybe just a little better but it has mushrooms and my boyfriend hates them so he wont eat my original recipe but this one was great since it just had the soup and no additional mushrooms. Although I think you could definitely throw a little can of them in here if you wanted. My only complaint was there really seemed to be a lot of noodles not much "sauce" when I was initially putting it together but after assembling it and baking it it came out just perfect. I suppose if you really want more moisture you could do extra soup / milk and cheese but I wouldn't, this was perfect as was!

So many of the reviews for this are lists of things added, ingredients altered, and cooking methods changed. Which is fine, do what you want; but I think those people are kind of missing the point of this recipe. It's not intended to be the Best Tuna Casserole Ever. It's just like the description says: easy and fast. It's something to make when you don't have the time or gumption to make much or shop, but still need to eat, and would like the thing you eat to be as palatable as possible. So that's how I'm going to rate it. On those terms, this recipe is great: it's easy, it's fast, it contains a vegetable, and it tastes pretty good. The next time I make it I imagine I'll use two pots, one for the sauce and one for the noodles, since by the time the water boils and the noodles cook the sauce could be made.

Fabulous! My boyfriend couldn't get enough.  A few changes though. I used less noodles (12 ounces), a second can of tuna, less cheese only 3/4 cup, a ton a worcestershire sauce (at least 2 tbsp) and i seasoned it with lots of salt and pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.  We also added hot sauce into our individual bowls... it gave it a nice kick. I will be making this again soon.

Quick and easy.  Not super tasty, but fine. Alterations: I used ~8oz of noodles, 2 cans of tuna, 1/8c. butter, and added a little salt (had organic cream of mushroom soup).

Not too shabby, but just a little bland. I used shell pasta since that's what I had on hand, and cut the amount in half. Kept all the other ingredients the same, added a little garlic powder, replaced the milk with a few dollops of sour cream, and added a can of mushrooms. It was *extremely* quick to put together, which was nice. It was also very filling and cheap to make, always a bonus. I topped individual servings with crushed potato chips and some parmesan cheese. Thanks :)

I have made this twice now.  It is an easy recipe, however I did dress it up a bit to add more flavor, thus only 4 stars.  Here is what I changed:  substituted 1c sour cream plus 1/4-1/2 cup milk for all the milk. 1 1/2 c of whatever cheese there was in the fridge. 2 cans of tuna. 1/2 small onion diced. garlic powder, dash of worshestershire. Also threw the frozen peas in with the noodles about 1/2 way through. Oh and I topped it with 1/2 of a large can of french fried onion rings and dotted with margerine.  Baked for about 30 minutes. It was fantastic.

Was very good had to use canned mixed veggies though so waiting until the last minute to add those so they didn't get to soggy. It really did need some onion will add some next time.

This is close to the recipe on the back of campbells cream of mushroom soup. Butter is not necessary just added fat. I make this alot really cant mess it up use as much or as little as you want of noodles, peas. You can also use cream of chicken soup for those who dont like mushrooms  use chicken instead of tuna. Black pepper is optional but adds alot of flavor.

4 stars for ease of preparation, one pot meal, pantry ingredients, economical. On the bland side, though. It needs spices like garlic powder and worchestershire. It sort of just tasted like cream of mushroom soup. I would make again on a busy weeknight for sure.

We thought this dish was good, however it had far too many pea's and I used an old cheddar which I found to be a bit too strong - next time I will try a mild cheddar.

This is one of those meals I turn to when I need put off a trip to the grocery store because I usually have all the ingredients on hand. Sure, there baked tuna casseroles out there with fancy ingredients that taste better, but this is quick, easy, and flexible (use whatever noodles you have, whatever veggies you have, etc). Thanks for the recipe!

My mom has made this for me since I was a kid!!  It's my all time favorite "quick" meal.  I add a can of corn, a second can of tuna, skip the extra calories from the cream soup and double (maybe even a little more than double) the milk content.  If you don't have egg noodles or shredded cheese, use a box of mac and cheese.  It calls for the same amount of milk and butter as the recipie here calls for.  Reading though other comments, I may try chicken in place of tuna or add brocolli to the concoction.  The more veggies the better!  Add extra milk with the extra ingredients or you'll end up with a sticky paste.  Don't forget the crushed up saltines to top and salt and pepper to taste.  :)

I have been doing a very close version of this stovetop tuna casserole for a few years. I add some chopped up celery and onions to the the large pot of water and simmer them until soft before I add the pasta and the peas. Being a family of one (me), I use half of the pasta amount but otherwise use the remaining ingredients as listed. Sometimes I put in 2 cans of tuna (I can find only 5 oz cans here in Michigan). I often crush up some potato chips to top each serving (I bet some crushed fried onion rings from a can would also be very good). This is some good stuff and it's even better the next day. For that reason, I sometimes prepare it a day in advance.

This was OK for us. As written we thought this was not enough tuna,  soup mix, seasoning or cheese. I added another can of tuna, 1 tsp of onion powder and 1/2 tsp of pepper. I also added about another cup of cheese. With the changes it was much better but it still seemed like it was missing something.

This dish came out great with a few changes! The quantity of pasta and peas was too much, so you can either cut down on the pasta or add more tuna (about 1 can more as others suggested). I also decreased the amount of peas used. 

Following other reviews, following are some additional ingredients I added: 1/2 teaspoon onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon garlic, 1/2 teaspoon paprika, 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, and a little bit more milk. It would have turned out too bland without these additional spices.

I then put the mixture into a casserole dish, sprinkled Italian breadcrumbs and a little cheddar cheese on top, and baked it at 375 degrees for 20 minutes. 

Next time I would like to add coriander leaves and some additional vegetables and see how it turns out!

I love, love, love this recipe! It's so easy and so good. I've made it a couple of times now and each time I like it more. It's great fresh off the stove and it's great reheated the next day. The first time I made it, at the end I put it in a casserole dish and stuck it in the oven for a few minutes and let the cheese melt on top because that's more what I'm used to. But the second time, I didn't want to take the time to bake it and just followed the instructions. It was wonderful right out of the pot and I'll probably never take the time to bake it again.  It's a great recipe.

Easy and good. The crunch and flavor of the diced onion is a great addition.
I live alone and am going to freeze meal size portions of this for later use. 
Sliced processed American cheese is not something I use. The next time I make this--and I will make it again--I'll get a small jar of Cheez Whiz and use that instead of the sliced cheese. I think it will melt quicker, too.
This is definitely a keeper for my kitchen!

This is a great, simple recipe.  I added a little sour cream to the sauce.  It also helps to add a tablespoon or so of sour cream when you microwave the left-overs - it makes the sauce more creamy.  Thanks for this great recipe, it's one of our favorites.

I will be making this tomorrow with the leftover pasta I have. I used to make this for my kids. I was surprized that they always gobbled it up as we were not big tuna eaters to begin with. I also used the version made with Kraft Dinner and veggies as one reveiwer suggested. It was cheap and really quite good. As another reveiw stated this is just tasty, good, affordable, basic, fast cooking. It's not meant to fancy. Thanks for featuring this recipe as I had forgotton about it after my kids left the nest. As a suggestion, for those who prefer chicken. I am sure it is fine to use the canned chicken or stop at the suppermaket on the way home to get a rotisserie chicken. This will be great with my leftover pasta. Fast and easy. Thanks!!!

Very bland. Not enough tuna and way too many noodles. I tried adding garlic powder, paprika, and other spices to help revive this recipe, but nothing worked. In the end, it just looked like a cheesy ball of noodles.

As a stay-at-home American mom, I find myself utilizing canned tuna a lot for quick lunches. This recipe brings the quintessential "tuna casserole" within reach of my lunchtime repetoire. I have used whole wheat rotini with success, and stir in extra peas to my own helping. I also top all servings--in true Midwestern style, but not without a little guilt--with crushed (salt and pepper, kettle) potato chips. Definitely double the tuna.

This is a good base recipe - except the butter is a bit much so I didn't use it.  I increased the milk to 1/2 cup, added 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp pepper.

For the peas, I like to put them in the casserole frozen so they are a little more firm and make that lovely "pop" when you eat them.   

For the crumb topping I mixed butter and italian breadcrumbs along with a 1/8 tsp all spice and after portioning my husband's serving (he doesn't like breaded toppings) I topped the rest and broiled for about 3 minutes.

Fantastic!!

This was great for super-quick meal.  Makes tons of food (too much for our little family). But we will have leftovers to take in lunches tomorrow :-).  I substituted with 12 oz. bag of "No Yolk" noodles, increased tuna to 2 cans and used 1/2 block of Velveeta Cheese cubed (2 lb. pkg.)instead of the cheddar cheese.  I also increased the milk to 1 can after I emptied the mushroom soup.  I seasoned with garlic salt, pepper, onion powder, and prepared dried mustard to taste.  It had a beautifully creamy yummy taste! Great idea for a nice quick winter meal.  Will make again. Thanks!!!

Absolutely a hit. We loved this recipe. Used one can of tuna and it was enough. If you really love a lot of tuna maybe use two cans. The leftovers reheat wonderfully.

I would actually give it five stars after my personal modifications.  This is a great base recipe on which can be improved to suit your own tastes.  I used shells instead of egg noodles and only used about 1/3 of the box.   I also sauteed some chopped celery, onion, mushroom slices, and minced garlic in a couple t. of butter.  I then added one can of mushroom soup along with additional milk and a can of tuna.  I used the kind in oil and didn't drain all of it out to give the dish some extra moisture.  I then added the cooked and shells and peas to the sauce mixture, poured into a small casserole dish, and then topped with some crushed potato chips and baked for about 8 minutes at 375.  Add some salt and pepper, serve with a salad or some garlic bread and you've got an easy, busy weeknight meal.

I also modified it:  I used 1 lb egg noodles, 2 cans cream of mushroom soup, a red bell pepper, 4 celery stalks, one yellow onion chopped, sliced mushrooms, 16 oz bag of frozen peas, substituted sour cream for the milk, and 3 cans of tuna.  I added some dried red pepper flakes, black pepper and celery salt for seasoning.  I used about 2,5 cups shredded cheddar.

I've made this twice now, both times I used a little more cheese than called for, 2 cans of tuna and I used mixed veggies instead of just peas.  Everyone loves it.  My 21 year old son's comment was that it would also be good made with chicken.  Very quick to make and there is always leftovers to take to work.

This recipe was quick and easy, but I agree with another reviewer.  I am going to saute some onion and celery in the butter prior to adding in the cream of mushroom soup.  But over all a very good result!!!

While I thought this was delicious, for some reason it was not a hit with the kids.  I did not have cream of mushroom soup and instead used some dairy whipping cream (not too much as I did not want to add all that fat) and more milk (I used one percent milk) . I reduced the amount of butter by quite a lot as well.

M'mm...comfort food! I omitted butter and peas (dislike), added an extra can of tuna and used cream of celery soup (dislike mushrooms). Served with a side salad and you have a yummerific meal.

This was great. It was quick, inexpensive, and the kids loved it. I made some changes as suggested by other reviewers. I added two cans of tuna (next time I will add an extra can of cream of mushroom soup). Very good!

We have been making this for several years.  We do change it a little.  I have made it with tuna, but my husband doesn't really care for tuna, so we use canned chicken.  I don't like mushrooms, so we substitute cream of chicken soup.  My brother even likes it, and he doesn't usually care for peas.  A quick and easy hit in our house.

I used cream of chicken and it still turned out good.  The first few bites were good, but after that it stopped tasting good, and more gluey.

I agree with other reviewers, this is quick and easy. It is a homemade Tuna Helper. You can use any cheese in place of cheddar and a dash of Worc. Sauce is a nice flavor addition. 
 I liked the ease of this recipe but I miss the crunchy potato chip topping from the baked version.

Great recipe. I used "garlic mushroom soup" and had to add another can (just regular mushroom soup) as it was too dry but it turned out quite tasty. I added extra cheese as we're cheese lovers. 

I also added fresh mushrooms (I cooked them separately, sauted in butter and added them to the casserole at the very end). The next time I'll add another can of tuna as it seemed to have gotten lost amoung the noodles. It's possible the egg noodle package I got was more than 16oz as we're metric here and I don't know conversions very well. 

My 21 month old son loved it. My hubby doesn't like tuna but the rest of the family liked it a lot at our potluck dinner. So it's a definite keeper! Thanks!

A great, quick recipe! I used regular pasta instead of the egg noodles and added the peas already frozen when there was about 4 minutes left on the time (time instructed on the package of peas to cook the peas). I also simmered everything together for about five minutes at the end.

I added some mushrooms and onions. I know for this recipe you're not supposed to bake to save time but I put it in a casserole dish, added cheddar cheese and bread crumbs on top and baked it for just a few minutes to melt the cheese and toast the bread crumbs. Turned out really good!

An extra star for ease of preparation.  But really, one 6 oz can of tuna for eight servings?  Setting aside the fact that almost all tuna comes in 5 oz cans nowadays. 

It's good if you want to fill up on egg noodles, and it certainly is economical.  But I would not make again, as written.

Basic forever recipe.  Used it during my college days in the 60's but added potato chips on top.  Tasty, easy and inexpensive but use a quality cream of mushroom soup.

I love this recipe because you can adjust it in so many ways and it comes out great.  Rotini pasta (the tri-colored) is an alternative.  Also adding water chestnuts and topped with the skinny Chinese noodles adds a wonderful crunch when using egg noodles.

Here is the classic Tuna Noodle dinner that I've made and my mother before me. We always just put the noodles back in the pot and added the soup, milk and tuna. Stir it up and it's good to go. We used half as many noodles as this recipe calls for. Cheese, butter and peas came later on, I've done those too as well as baking to melt the cheese. The beauty of the original recipe is that it's sooo simple. Still a great comfort food.

I really wanted to like this, because I was craving Tuna Casserole.  However, our family thought this was very bland, as is, except I used less noodles.  We ate it, because it was still edible, but it went down with lots of water.  I give it an extra star, because it was definitely done in less than 30 minutes and very minimal clean up, so that's always a plus in my book!!  Thanks, anyhow!

I had half a bag of uncooked noodles in my pantry & decided to try this recipe to use it up.  Instead of mushroom soup I used cream of celery.  I love the quick prep time & the quick clean up time since you only use one pot for cooking.  I couldn't believe how quickly I was in & out of the kitchen.  My husband likes things bland so I fixed the recipe as written for him, then I mix a dash of Worchestshire sauce and sprinkled some Janes Krazy Mixed-Up Salt on mine.  We were both happy.

This was quite the tasty tuna dish.  I did add a little onion powder and garlic powder to the "sauce" before I added all the noodles, tuna, and peas.  I used medium shell noodles and a 12 oz. can of albacore tuna...I will definitely make this again!

This was great. Much easier than making white sauce (like I used to) so its a keeper.  I left out the butter and cheese, added sauteed garlic, carrots and celery and fat free sour cream. It works well with canned chicken too.  Use the big can or 2 of the small ones. More if you really like meat.

Pretty good!  Now, I'm from Louisiana and we don't like it bland.  So after reading the other reviews, I sauteed a clove of garlic and a half an onion in the butter before adding the soup.  I spiced it up with some Tony's, and it turned out good!  Perfect for a middle of the week meal!

I added two cans of tuna instead of the one; one just didn't seem like enough for my family. Other than that it was great. Fast and easy to make!

This recipe was very easy, but exceptionally bland. I also added another can of tuna at the last minute. It needs salt, pepper and even another can of cream of mushroom soup. I will also bake it for 15 minutes with italian bread crumbs and cheese on top next time.

Very easy to make & everything needed was on hand.  I did substitute sour cream( 1/2 cup) for the milk & added garlic powder(1 tsp.).  I also used fiesta blend shredded cheese instead of regular.  Too easy & my picky kids love it!

For a healthier, yet still delicious version: I used Campbells 98% fat free soup, skim milk, "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter," and Barilla Plus Wlbow Macaroni (has protein and fiber but you can't tell by the taste).  I added some garlic and onion powder, black pepper, and saved half the cheese to spread on top of the pasta before I put it in the oven for a few minutes.  Also added seasoned bread crumbs prior to baking.  I will make this again!

The only reason why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I doctored ours up (after reading the other reviews).  I used 2 cans of tuna, 1 can of cream of celery soup, and I also added processed American and extra cheddar (we like a lot of cheese).  I also put a few bread crumbs on the top before putting it in the oven.  It turned out awesome -- my husband and I both loved it.  Thanks!

I did a bit of tweaking. I basically doubled the flour, butter and milk. I used 1 lb of rotini noodles instead of egg noodles added 5 slices of American (processed) cheese instead of cheddar (maybe it could have used a couple more slices)and left it at one can of tuna (I thought it was sufficiant.) I also added garlic and onion powder to it. It turned out really tasty and would probably be a hit with the vegetarian crowd - just leave out the tuna and add more veggies (green beans, brocolli?) Makes enough for a few meal - cheap, simple and tasty, highly recommended.

I really enjoyed this fast and easy meal but my husband wasn't very impressed because he's not a fan of the tuna. I used rigatoni pasta and also added some corn.

Just made a few changes.... I  used 12 ounces of egg noodles and 2 cans of tuna. I also used the campbells cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic and peas in a can.  And then to top it off I moistened 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs with melted butter and sprinkled over the top and baked my casserole for about an 1/2 hour at 375*.

This tasted pretty good as the recipe is written, but for my family's taste preferences I will probably make some adjustments next time.  My husband noted that this could have used a little more cheese and I felt it would have benfited from a little more liquid (soup, milk, or both) and some seasoning.

This is a great fast meal. I sauted onion and garlic and celery also and added it to the casserole. I added to the milk a little bit of cooking cream to thicken it up.I also added another can of tuna. I definately will make this again.

I've been makling a similar recipe for many [40] years.I use cream of celery soup. 2 cans tuna, 2 cans soup, & 1 can of milk. Maybe a little more.  I sautee the veggies [ onion & celery to taste].  Combine all ingredients including the peas except the cheese & put it into a buttered casserole, then top with cheese, cover & put into a 350 degree oven for 35 to 45 min.  Remove the cover & put back in oven for a few minutes to melt cheese.  Delicious!!!

Only reason I didn't give this a 5 star rating is because I made adjustments. I added 1/4 cup mayonaise and 1/4 cup sour cream to this. Upped the milk to 1/2 cup. Also added a can of corn. Baked for 40  minutes in at 350 degrees. Very, very good.

This was a tasty recipe! The only thing I would do different is definitely add another can of tuna, and add one more can of cream of mushroom soup and an extra 1/4 cup of milk. The soup and milk is just to make it a little bit more creamy, personal preference really, but this was still a great recipe!

Four stars with my tweaks, 3 without.  Reduced pasta to a 12 oz bag of bow tie pasta.  Increased tuna to 2 cans.  Had to increase milk to 1/2 cup.  Needed some seasoning of onion powder, salt and pepper.  I would have sauteed some onion with the butter if I had thought about it.  Sharp cheddar is good.  I made this lighter by using light butter, skim milk and 2% cheese, and tuna packed in water.  No one was any the wiser and it was delicious and very quick and easy.

I make ours almost exactly the same as this, I do add a few shake of Louisana hot sauce, and we use 1 cup + of sharp cheddar.

This is an excellent recipe that also tastes great with chunks of pre-cooked ham in place of the tuna. I added a little hickory salt for an additional kick!
I also added diced onion, and some sliced mushrooms for 'visual texture'.

Can be pretty bland if you don't hook it up with seasoning. 
I used the No Yolks Egg Noodles and TWO cans of Tuna. I also tried some salt, pepper, and garlic powder as suggested by other reviewers, but nothing topped the taste of this dis with a dabble or so of worchestire sauce and a generous amount of wasabi powder. 
This was easy to make and now that I've perfected the recipe to my liking, I'll use it again and again!

I changed it up a bit.  I added 1/2 tsp. dry mustard; did not thaw the peas as the flavour of the peas mix with the sauce.  I was out of cheese and just added some French's canned onions to the top.  Followed thru with the rest of the recipe. Very Good.

It was good, but I also made quite a few changes. Definitely less pasta and more tuna. I'm glad I read the review about the bread crumbs, that was a great idea.

My family absolutely loved this recipe.  I will make some changes the next time around.  As it was this time I only cooked half the noodles that the recipe called for.  Next time I will also add another can of soup and another can of tuna.  Other than that the recipe was "GREAT"!

Very good, very big family recipe!  I doubled the milk and added extra monterrey jack cheese.  I still could have added more milk for extra creaminess though.  Definitely use two cans of tuna.

I've never made egg noodles this way before, and I was really skeptical in the beginning, but the end result surprised me the most. It was definitely more-ish, and there just wasn't enough to go around even though I made a bit more than the recipe called for! My husband thought it was good and my daughter, who normally is funny about noodles, slurped it all down. Its so quick and easy to make too! This will definitely become a staple in our household from now on. Thanks for posting the recipe!

I love that this recipe was so easy but it was a little bland for my family's taste.  I think with a little tweaking it will be a keeper!  I did cut back on the noodles from 16oz to 12 and that was a good thing--can't imagine having any more than that.  Next time will use another can of soup, tuna and more cheese with some spices. Very easy and quick!

This was pretty good. My husband and three kids all liked it, as did I. It's very easy to make and the only changes I made were to decrease the noodles to about 12 oz. and add a can of mushrooms. Otherwise, made as directed and it was popular.

Although I increased the tuna and peas, and added ground pepper and worcestershire sauce, this was still too bland for me.  However it was super-easy, and I liked that I needed only one pot.  I doubled the tuna, but next time I make this I'll triple it, and add more worcestershire and some salt, and something to give it a bit of crunch.

This was very easy to fix, but I took some suggestions from other reviewers. I cut the egg noodles to about 12oz or so because it seemed like it would be to many if I used the 16. I also added garlic salt and worcester sauce. I have never made tuna casserole before but I wanted to try the baked version so after mixing it all together I topped it with crused Cheez-It's that another reviewer had suggested and baked it for awhile. Served with salad and mixed fruit sides and made a wonderful & Easy Dinner!

Tasted good for a simple recipe, but would like a litte more flavor.  I also added 1 more can of tuna.  I will make this again because it takes 20min from start to finish.

This recipe most closely resembles the one I use, with a few exceptions.  I only use about 8 oz of noodles per can of soup, add a sprinkle of garlic powder, salt and freshly ground pepper.  Oh and I omit the peas (the hunny won't touch them)  Try pepper jack cheese for some extra zip!

My husband and I really liked this recipie!  I did half the noodles only. It made it really creamy but it was good!  We decided you could sub the tuna with ground turkey and get a stroganaff. It's a great alternative from buying the tuna helpers and cheap!

I just have one comment for all the reviewers who couldn't resist adding a bunch of extra ingredients: "It's tuna casserole." 
     If you feel like you need to power up the taste, then you obviously don't care for tuna casserole. No hard feelings, I'm just putting that out there.

I think the whole point of PREFERED1's recipe was that it's "stove top" not "baked".  I've done the stove top many times and tried the oven once and saw no real point in messing up another dish!  I like stove top just fine thanks.

A great base recipe! I used frozen peas and carrots. Used 2 cans and doubled the milk. I added a little onion powder, garlic, celery salt, and a dash or worchestershire. Loved it.

I didn't make it as is b/c I didn't have all the ingredients, so I adjusted based on some other reviewers.  The end result, we really liked and will make again !  I didn't have any peas so I used a can of mushrooms.  And two cans of tuna and soup.  Added some garlic powder, well, because everything is better with garlic :0)  Thanks for sharing!

Wow, this dish was super cheap to make and delicious! I'm giving it 4 stars because it was looking dry so I read more of the reviews and added another can of cream of mushroom and luckily I had another can of tuna to add as well. We plan on making it again later this week. :)

Great cheap go-to meal, even for a single gal. Plenty of leftovers. I just changed the pasta ratio (I used about half the amount it called for), used shells instead of egg noodles, upped the salt (I'm not concerned about my salt intake, so don't follow my advice if you are!) and used half Parmesan and half cheddar. Deelish.

I have made this recipe since I was a Girl Scout more than 50 years ago. We named this recipe "Tuna Wiggle."  Still enjoy it today, but adjust quantity to serve 1 with 1 to freeze.

Easy to make expat recipe.  Substituted the egg noodles for a 300 gram package of dao xue gua mian (sold at hong qi)  substituted the green peas for mushrooms (ping gu, which ended up being a little bland, will probably do a different mushroom next time) and an onion.   Added in some garlic too.  I was already stocked with the soup and tuna from taobao, so ready to go in minutes.

For what it is great.   Used sour cream instead of milk and was out of peas so forced to use carrots. When it was done topped it with fried dill pickles.  Comfort food, quick and easy. Thanks for this one.

I thought this was a great meal base. I used Swanson chicken in a can instead of tuna. Also, added onion powder, garlic powder, paprika and worchestire sauce.  I switched to cream of celery soup too.  It was so easy and my grandson helped me make it.

Adjustments had to be made....less noodles, more tuna, more milk, and some seasonings. It was easy, though, and fit the bill for my tuna noodle craving.

This recipe had way too much noodles for the amount of liquid. I ended up adding another can of soup, another 1/4 cup milk, miked it in with the other sauce as well as 1/2 cup diced white onion. I also added a 1/4 cup shredded mortadella on top, as weill as 2 diced hard boiled eggs, a melted tbs butter,  sprinkled with paprika and covered top with fried onions. then baked for 15 minutes at 375. it was then perfect! The way written I would suggest 8 oz noodles.

There was not enough sauce for the noodles and turned out rather dry.  **EDIT** I made it again and this time doubled the sauce and it was much better!

Too many noodles and not enough tuna. For this much pasta you need to add at least 2 cans of tuna and 1/3 can more cream of mushroom or adjust butter and milk depending on your taste. This would be a good recipe if you used 2/3 to 3/4 the noodles. I make tuna and noodle casserole a lot but thought I’d try a different recipe and it was a fail. I suggest looking at a couple other recipes because the measurements are incorrect here.

This was fabulous!! My step dad and I are the only ones in the family that eat tuna, so I made a pot for him and I. It got both of our seals of approval! I accidentally got the cream of mushroom soup with garlic, but I think it really worked well with the recipe, you couldn't overly taste the garlic, it was just enough to give it that little boost. I used macaroni noodles instead of regular egg noodles also, I had a lot of them in the cabinet, and it worked out just fine.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly. It was very similar to the kind my mom made growing up. Both my husband and I thought it needed more sauce, and so now I double everything but the noodles and peas; the peas, we use a 16 ounce bag. This makes a ton for us, probably about 8-10 servings, so my husband has a lot for lunches (which he loves). He served in the army and says this tastes very similar to the MREs he used to get in Iraq and uses red Tabasco to season. He says it brings back lots of great memories, minus the sand blasted face :)

This was great! As a basic recipe, this gives the guidelines. Dress it up to taste, as is a cook's prerogative, and the possibilities are endless! I doubled everything but the noodles, added onions, fresh garlic, sour cream, and a WHOLE BAG of shredded cheese. Top it off with french onions, and it's quick, easy, and delicious!

Used 12oz egg noodles, 1 1/2 c. extra sharp cheddar cheese, added celery (uncooked for more texture), and used herb and garlic tuna for added flavor. Ended up adding a little extra milk for desired creaminess. Crunched up original potato chips are delicious on the top! Good base recipe to make changes per taste.

Simple and economical. Good for building confidence in amateurs like me. Might be good to spice it up a little bit, literally. Makes a lot, you might have leftovers.

thank you prefered1 for this recipe and everone else who gave their input.  i sauted onions in butter then added 2 cans of cream of onion soup and two cans of tuna fish with 1/2cup of milk.  i added sharp cheddar cheese to that pot.  this came out fabulous, esp when adding frozen peas to wide egg noodles.  made enough for the extended family.   thank you  again to all.

I'd suggest using more than the recommended amount of cream of mushroom soup as the noodles will absorb a good bit. But it was very good and I'd make it again

I made this with green (veggie) rotini because my picky eater loves the color green. Omitted the extra veggies.  Used 15oz tuna to make it heartier. Mixed noodles, butter, milk, and cheese as directed, then transferred to casserole dish to add soup and tuna mixture (warmed tuna in a pan with garlic, oregano and lemon juice before adding to casserole).  Topped with parmesan cheese and microwaved for 4 minutes to combine flavors. Delicious!

Decreased tri-colored spiral pasta to 8 oz., increased milk to 1/2 C, used cream of Celery soup, used 1 packet of Velveeta cheese sauce, seasoned with onion flakes, garlic powder, turmeric, parsley flakes, and celery salt.  Finally drained a can of Le Seur small sweet peas and added to the boiling pasta water for the last 3 minutes.  I did all that after reading several of the reviews. Results....voila, perfection!  Otherwise, the only ingredient that stayed the same was tuna, but I only had a 5 oz. can!

I added 1 extra can of tuna and sauteed some fresh mushrooms in the butter before adding the other ingredients. The flavor is great but 1 lb. of uncooked pasta is a bit too much for 1 can of tuna and 1 can of mushroom soup. Next time I will cut back a little on the noodles and add another can of mushroom soup to make it creamier but we really enjoyed it.

Very good and easily adaptable for add-ins.  I left the onion out and used 1 tsp onion powder. I doubled all the ingredients except the noodles and peas. Came out fantastic. Even my very picky husband liked it! I have also made it using cream of chicken soup and canned chicken.

This is your 'very basic' tuna noodle casserole recipe.... before you pour it into a baking dish and top it off with whichever topping you prefer to use (seasoned & buttered breadcrumbs, crushed corn flakes, French's French fried onions, etc.) in order to make the topping crunchy.  I too, have made changes to the basic recipe over the years.  I use frozen peas & carrots, and sour cream (instead of milk).  I've also made it using a can of condensed New England Clam Chowder instead of Cream of Mushroom Soup, and it was terrific!  I also add in some sliced mushrooms (either canned or fresh) since we love them.  I like that you can do almost anything with this basic recipe, which is also very tasty.

This is pretty much how I've made tuna noodle casserole for many years but like Nina I saute half an onion in butter before adding rest of ingredients listed here. I also use less green peas--don't measure just throw in what I think is enough. Of course I add garlic powder to almost everything I cook. Next time I'm going to add the celery too.

This was just ok. Too many noodles for the tuna, soup, milk and cheese. If I make it again I will halve the noodles and use 2 cans of tuna and soup.

I made this for dinner tonight and my casserole-loving guy raved over it. I had to give it 3 stars because of the changes I made.

 I used 16 oz. of egg noodles cooked in UNsalted water; 16 oz of Mixed frozen vegetables that I added during during the last 7 min of cooking. (I didn't thaw first). Drained the veggies and noodles, then added a can of mushroom soup And a can of cheddar cheese soup, plus a half cup sour cream instead of milk. I didn't add salt as there's enough in the condensed soups. I used garlic powder and onion powder and freshly ground pepper. Then I stirred in a half cup of hot cheddar cheese, with extra pepper flakes, I had on hand, after shredding it. We like our tuna to be chunky, so I gently folded in 3 Cans of tuna without breaking it up down too much. Then transferred the mixture to a casserole dish and sprinkled cracker crumbs on top and drizzled it with a half stick of melted butter. Baked in 375 degree oven until bubbling and browned. Gave me time to set the table and toss a salad.  We will definitely add this to our favorite weeknight meal list!

Instead of cream of mushroom soup try one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can of cream of celery soup. We sometimes just use the cream of celery.  Celery and tuna have an affinity for one another that mushrooms and tuna do not. I put tuna in bottom of microwaveable casserole dish, layer noodles, soup and cheddar cheese on top of the tuna, put a layer of cheese on top and pour milk on top of the cheese.  Microwave on 60 (bake) for 8-12 minutes depending on your microwave or until the cheese is melted.

I modified it.  For one, as written above with milk, the problem of dryness is solved.  However, with just 1 can of soup, the milk just increases the blandness.  So, to combat the dryness problem I added a can of Cream of Celery Soup too!  (Came out about 2 years after the Mushroom variety).  Fantastic flavor adjustment!!!  After the first time I served it, my husband (a huge meat & potatoes man) actually liked it, and asked if we could have again, BUT(!!!) "could you put a little MEAT or more tuna in it?"!  Think about it, you have 8 servings, which amounts to less than 1 oz. of protein per person even with cheese added!  So, I tripled the number of 6 oz. cans, of Tuna, now I simply buy larger cans of tuna.  If I serve this at a potluck, for instance, everyone wants the "recipe"!!! Oh, another trick I learned, about 5-7 minutes before your pasta is cooked, throw in the UN-thawed peas, & they impart a bit of flavor into the pasta!  HTH!!!  Blessings!!!

I've made this its awesome especially when you have to feed a hungry 9 year old and a teenager! Also how can I make this without cream of mushroom soup? I have canned mushrooms and milk but no cream of mushroom??
I am making this tonight for five we have a guest tonight people. Also I use regular spiral colored noodles and I put a little onion powder in it its awesome
