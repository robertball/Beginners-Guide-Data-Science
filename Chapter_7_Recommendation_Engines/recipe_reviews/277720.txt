12.31.19  Nice texture, very light and tender (thank you buttermilk!).  Used a 1/4 cup measure (my standard for pancakes) and ended up with 10 pancakes.  I had some 1/2 cup scoopfuls of pumpkin puree in the freezer, and that really was the inspiration for trying this recipe.  And Iâ€™m glad I did, because these are very good pancakes.
