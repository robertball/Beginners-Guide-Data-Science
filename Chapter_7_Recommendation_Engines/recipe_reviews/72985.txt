This recipe is delicious.  I used non fat yogurt instead of sour cream, and replaced the onion with a couple cloves of garlic.  I used canned chicken.

Very tasty chicken salad with the feta!  I followed the recipe as stated except I didn't have fresh red bell peppers so I subbed with roasted red peppers in water from a jar.  I drained and chopped before adding to the dish.  I tasted right after mixing and thought it was okay.  Put in the fridge for about an hour, then tasted and salt and peppered to taste.  I will make this again.

Thank you. Great use for leftover roast chicken, feta cheese, and red bell pepper in my fridge.  Didn't have sour cream, so added a splash of FF 1/2 and 1/2 and a squeeze of lemon. Also substituted dry thyme, basil, and oregano for dill weed.  Stuffed into a whole wheat pita--yummy! The lunch of champions.

I have used this recipe for over two years and thought I should get aroung to reviewing it.  It is absolutely fabulous and low carb to boot!  It is actually a little better the 2nd day, but we usually don't have any left!!!

I was thinking there would be too many veggies in this salad but I was very wrong.  This is absolutely awesome.  I used green pepper, sweet onion and basil and tomato feta.  Left out the dill at first, added it to leftovers ... we prefer it without.  Suggest omitting it if you do not like pickles in your salads.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!  Would give it 10 stars if I could.

This is a new standard at our house.  Even family & friends who don't like feta have loved this recipe.  I am asked to make it often.  Sometimes I use cucumber if I don't have red pepper.

awesome chicken salad recipe! such a nice change from the ordinary. my husband grimaced when i told him we were having these pita sandwiches for dinner but quickly changed his opinion as soon as he tasted it ;) the feta and dill give it such a nice flavor and the veggies give it the necessary texture. definitely a 5 star recipe.

I rarely eat chicken salad but had a craving recently so made this.  So good!  

I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  Seasoned with salt and pepper and a little smoked paprika then browned in a little olive oil.  Added about a cup of chicken broth and simmered for maybe 1/2 hour before chopping up to add to other ingredients.  Can't wait to make this again.  May double it next time.  

FYI, about 1 1/4 lbs. boneless breasts gave me about three cups chopped chicken.

I have made this for years (via a similar recipe). It's fantastic, all alone or with crackers or raw veggies. I love the varied textures (creamy, crunchy, etc) and the flavor layers.

Great flavor combination! I didn't have a Red Bell Pepper so I substituted it for green.  I served it on a bed of Romaine Lettuce and enjoyed hearing my husband trying to guess what was in it!   Will surely use this one again!  VERY easy and FAST!

Feta was more flavorful immediately after making than next day.  Add feta just before eating.

I used diced cucumber instead of celery and red pepper.  I also used lots of fresh basil and parsley from the garden instead of the dill.  They made tasty sandwiches for lunch.  Both my boyfriend and I enjoyed them.  I wrote down the recipe for my book.  Will definitely be making again.

Love this salad.  It is a unique and tasty way to get rid of left over chicken.  It is even better with left over bbq grilled chicken (without bbq sauce of course).  The longer it stays in the fridge the better it gets.  Thanks for the recipe!!

very great! I boiled boneless skinless chicken breasts, with garlic, red pepper, celery, salt and pepper. Then I cubed it up after it dried.  I did not add in the red pepper to the mix, I cut the onion part in half.  Very good!

A great use for all the stuff I had in my fridge.  I did substitute yogurt for the sour cream.  In my mind at least, that and the "Mediterranean Herb" feta cheese just made it more authentic Middle Eastern.  Served it with pita pocket bread.  I haven't tried it, but I bet you could put this in a food processor and make a spread for crackers.

Great recipe.  I got a reduced price rotisserie chicken from the grocery, let it cool, cut up into bite sized pieces. Quick, quick, quick and easy! Stuffed a tomato with it.

Loved this! Delish and very easy to make. I used Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream, and added toasted pecan pieces and fresh basil. It's a keeper.

Absolutely delicious.  I love the flavor that the dill and feta add to this classic.  And the veggies give the salad a wonderfully crisp texture.  I used greek yogurt instead of the sour cream as well as a "light" version of the mayo.  Yum!

This was exceptional! Made exactly as written, with the exception of using Morningstar Farms soy chicken strips in place of real chicken (we are vegetarians). YUM!

This is a delicious recipe, thank you for sharing it!  I too used the garlic herb feta cheese and it gives the salad such a nice flavor.  My hubby says it's "deli quality" and I agree-it's wonderful.

Had lots of leftover chicken from dinner, and thought this sounded good. We all love feta here. I started to make it and realized I had NO red pepper. But I chopped up about 1/4 cup of roasted red peppers (mild) and used that instead. YUMMY! I'll definitely use this often.

Good recipe base! Went the Greek route as suggested & used yogurt instead of sour cream. Topped w/diced peppercinis & cayanne for some kick. Served as a wrap. Next time will add lettuce & maybe substitute Greek seasoning instead of the dill. Freshing dinner on a hot day!

This was awesome! I used what I had on hand and did not have the celery and used roasted peppers in a jar instead. This was so good even with the substitutions!

This was so good!  I didn't add onions and dill simply because I forgot, but added everything else plus a little lemon juice. So so good!

This was really good! I added dejon mustard, cayanne, and tonys. Next time I might add boiled eggs. I was kind of concerned about the feta cheese but my husband always tells me that you will never know if it is good unless you try it so I did and I am glad I did. Great recipe!

A new twist on my normal chicken salad with fruit (cranberries or grapes) and I loved it! My 12 year old daughter devoured it and asked for more.  I left out the celery since we all dislike it, but other than that, I stuck to the recipe. Thanks!

I recently made this for a baby shower and it was absolutely delicious. I did make a few changes.  I used 2% greek yogurt instead of the sour cream and replaced the dried dill with fresh.  This recipe will not disappoint!

This was easy to prepare and had a nice flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used half of red pepper and a small white onion.  I used my PC chopper on chicken and veggies.  Served on butter croissants that were a little warm.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Nice, versatile recipe. I have also omitted the red pepper and added dried cranberries. They went very well with the Feta. I'll surely keep this as a base to play with.

This is one of the yummiest & most unique chicken salad recipes I have ever tasted.
Time-saver tip: Just pick up an already-roasted whole chicken at the grocery store & shred the meat to use in this recipe.

This took some getting used to, but in the end it was delicious in a unique chicken salad sort of way. Now that I think about it, I wonder if, given the dill, pepper, and feta, if this would be really yummy with salmon instead of chicken. Hmm... I'll ponder that for next time.

Hmmm....I thought this was just OK. I wasn't that thrilled with the red pepper in it. (& I only used half) I love feta, so I thought I would love this. Oh, well!

Although I would have preferred it without the red bell pepper, we both really liked this. I used lite mayo and fat-free sour cream, and we had it in wholegrain rolls. Very good. Thanks!

Very good change from your usual chicken salad.  I used a rotiserie chicken from costco, 1/2 red bell pepper,  1/2 english, cucumber, light mayo, light sour cream, and light feta.  I served a big spoonful on a bed of greens with pita chips on the side.  Yummy summer dinner. Thanks for the recipe.

This flavor is terrific.  Very easy too.  I used the meat from a rotisserie chicken, no skin, as it's too hot to cook one.  Also I used just about 1/2 a red pepper, personal preference. Everything else the same.  Very good taste.  The feta is not overpowering, it's just a little different than the usual chicken salad.

Tart when first made, then gave it 2 hours refrigerator time for sweet red bell pepper flavor to pop. Was delighted to find that canned chicken worked well in this recipe.

I had some left over roast chicken from Wal-Mart deli and Feta that needed to be used. Used the search feature and this came up. My wife and I really loved it. Served with leaf lettuce for an informal build it yourself lettuce wrap.Definitely a keeper.I made no changes

Wow!  I will definitely make this again.  Followed the recipe as written but I never measure anything, (I always eyeball)....and as much as I LOVE red onion, it tends to be very strong, and once I cut up half of the onion it looked like it was going to be way to much for this recipe so I didn't add it all.  I have another chicken recipe that I like to make but I can't wait to try this one out on others.  Thank you! :-)

The sour cream and feta make it less mayonnaise-y than most which we liked. I recommend this recipe.

The only change was the use of fresh dill. This is an absolutely fabulous recipe. A delightful departure from the same old for left over chicken or turkey.

My first chicken salad ever, and this was excellent!! I followed the recipe almost exactly, using just a bit less onion as a few people suggested. ONE ADDITION: 1/4 c. of chopped sundried tomatoes in olive oil. It was the perfect missing ingredient and I got a LOT of compliments!

5 stars is the equivalent of an Oscar, just so ya know. This chicken salad is interesting, original, and delicious. I only made 1/2 of the recipe and added the feta to taste. I can't see it as a sandwich filling but as a spread on snooty crackers or crostini, this is a gourmet worthy recipe. :o)

I took this recipe and changed the servings to 50 for a Bridal shower.  The new measurements called for 2 whole onions and I added 3/4 of one medium onion and it was oniony enough; With that in mind, I advise everyone to watch the measurement of onion this recipe calls for and go easy.  You can always add more if you want more but you can't take away...  With all that, it was still a really good chicken salad and everyone at the shower loved it.  It's a keeper recipe!

Five stars and a plus!  Very good recipe, don't change a thing unless you have to. I substituted white onion for red, otherwise, I made the recipe as is.  Can't wait to fix for the next ladies luncheon!

Made this with vegetarian "chicken" and it turned out fantastic! I didn't have sour cream so I just used more mayo. I served mine over pasta and made it into a sort of pasta/chicken salad. It was great--these flavors all blend really well.

It's a good recipe for when you want a break from "regular" chicken salad.  I would probably make this once or twice a year.

I enjoyed this.  I'm not a huge fan of dill weed, so I didn't add very much.  I added extra feta, & some sliced almonds for a little crunch.

I don't know but I think we may have messed up the recipe because it wasnt very good at all. Way too creamy. Didn't seem like there was enough chicken.

I served this on toasted wheat english muffins with lettuce and pickles. Mixed reviews here between DH and I. He absolutely loved it, but I think regular chicken salad is better. The only two things I changed was leaving out the red pepper because we both dislike it strongly and adding garlic salt. I will make it again sometime since he liked it so much.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend, and we both loved it. The combination of feta, and dill along with everything else was a delicious. The only thing I did differently was I didn't add as much veggies as the recipe called for.

Excellent recipe...thanks!  The only changes I made were to use 1/2 cup diced red onion instead of 1/2 of an onion...a half of my onion would have been about 1 cup (too much).  I also added 3/4 cup slivered almonds which was nice.  Very easy to make and my family loved it sandwich-style in pita bread pockets with cucumber and tomato slices.

This is my new favorite chicken salad recipe. I used left over chicken breasts, tomato basil feta, skipped on the red pepper (allergy) and added sun dried tomatoes as a previous review suggested (thank you for the great idea!!). I followed the rest of the recipe as written. It vanished so fast at my potluck! I'm going to leave out the dill next time and add more sun dried tomatoes(I used the kind packed in oil, I patted them semi-dry before adding to mix). Thank you for the great recipe!

made this salad this morning (grilled the chicken breasts last night) and had it for lunch. In the future I will use more mayo than sour cream, instead of 50/50. To me, there was too much "sour cream taste", which I am not accustomed to in chicken/shrimp/potato salads.

update: I make this for company in the summer, as everyone loves it. I've modified to 8T mayo, 4T sour cream, plus instead of chopping veggies, I just use one container of the Trinity Mix from the grocery store - it comes out to 1.5c total of onioon, celery, green pepper, so perfect blend.

Delicious!  I used nonfat yougurt instead of the sour cream to lower calories and fat.  Adding some toasted almonds and grapes made it easy to do without the bread.  A keeper!

I've been looking for a good chicken salad recipe for a while now, and i'm a very fussy eater.. i never imagined to put feta in chicken salad. I tried the recipe the first day I saw it, and quickly added it to my cook book! I tweaked the recipe a bit (no onions, or celery) and added cucumbers and sliced black olives in its place, and then stuffed it in a pita!!! Great Recipe!!

I knew this was going to be good, and it was! But I also LOVE feta and dill. I used fresh dill instead of dried. Thanks for sharing. Will be making this one often in the summertime!

Salad was good, but I thought the dill was a little too strong.  I'm going to make this salad again but use thyme in place of the dill.  Thanks for the recipe.

I loved this recipe....the only way I will make Chicken salad from now on....I did make a few changes according to what I had on hand
I used fresh Dill weed
green onions instead of red
had no feta cheese so I used shredded cheddar
ommited the celery 
and used light sour cream

YUMMY!!!  My 4 year old loved it on a whole grain tortilla with fresh tomatoes.

I needed to use up some chicken, but was short some of the ingredients.  Even without the pepper, onion, and sour cream the recipe was super tasty.  My husband was skeptical to eat his green sandwich (I used extra dill for flavour), but it received rave reviews.

Awesome! Wonderful for a lo-carber. My hubby doesn't like peppers so we use roma tomatoes. Very tastey wrapped in lettuce or on whole grain bread.

I loved this recipe!!! I put orange, yellow and red peppers in it 1/4 of each.  It looks very festive and would be great for a large crowd.  I might try and add some garlic powder next time I make it but not much it has lots of flavor just the way it is.

This recipe was tasty. I prepped it ahead of time and took it camping. It kept well and made a hearty and tasty lunch. I used canned chicken, which worked just fine, but it probably would have been much tastier with the chicken breasts.

Great chicken salad! I made 2 changes. I don't like red peppers, so I left those out. I used green onions instead of red onions. The recipe had a light refreshing flavor. I will definitey makeit again.

Made this just as directed, and we enjoyed it very much.
Great with sliced tomato, or on toast for a light lunch.
I will make this again.

I loved this is a base, but I made a few, minor changes. First, I always, always season and boil my own chicken. It takes more time, but I like using the broth as my “salt and pepper” to give the salad more flavoring. I’m not big on raw onions so I sautéed mine.  Lastly, I added in some sundried tomatoes and roasted my bell peppers.

We loved this. I used sweet Vidalia onions because they're in season. This one is a keeper. I print them out and if they get an A or A+ they go in a special part of the recipe box! This one is a winner.

I made this to serve to three friends for our book club meeting, and it was well received.  I changed the onions to green onions (a favor for one of my friends), and otherwise I followed the recipe.  I put it along side a sliced tomato and a little arugula, and I served it with some homemade buttery rolls.  Thanks so much for a delicious lunch!

This is excellent. I made it for a picnic for thirty people and it was not too cumbersome and it is delicious. I didn't have dill weed so I minced a few dill spears and that added a nice zip to the dressing. I used salad dressing (not mayo) and greek yogurt (not sour cream). Still tastes awesome!

I have made this exact recipe, without changing a single thing for YEARS. It has been, by far, our family’s favorite chicken salad EVER. I always double the recipe and it typically lasts a week. My little people don’t eat it, though, so I can’t say it is “kid approved”, but all of the adults love it.

I made a half recipe and the only changes I made were nothing was red -- onion or pepper.  But my husband, who does not like feta liked it, and I did, too.  Our 100 degree day called for something like this.

These were so refreshing and quite tasty! I didn't change a thing with the recipe however I think next time I will cut the mayo (I used light) a little because I could tell it was in there. It wasn't bad at all and once it sat a little bit it got better because the flavors melded nicely. I think plain greek yogurt would work great in place of the sour cream too. So maybe 4 tbsp mayo and 8 yogurt/sour cream? I'll try it! :)
  I served it wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla with sliced cucumber in it which gave it a little extra freshness and crunch.

Made without modifications. Half the party had croissants, half gluten free ciabatta and it was delicious on both   It is quite rich, and satisfying, so a little goes a long way. I will def make again and again! Thanks!

This is really good.  The onion was a bit strong after sitting in the fridge for a while, so I probably wouldn't add that again - especially if  I'm taking it to work for lunch.  Really good flavor overall.

This is a good starter recipe. We like ours creamer, so I added a bit more sauce, some sweet relish, added additional dill, black pepper, and mild curry powder. Better than a restaurant! Definitely taste as you go. Oh, and I substituted plain non fat Greek yogurt for sour cream and used a combo of reduced fat mayo and a bit of miracle whip for zing!

This is a fantastic chicken salad recipe! I loved it, didn't go over well with the group I made it for, but that just means there was more for me that I don't have to share! Great on crackers or on rolls

This is really good.  Picking and choosing from other reviewers, I mixed it up early so the flavors could meld, but I sprinkled the feta on top instead of stirring it into the salad.  I put the salad into a pita pocket and served it with roast asparagus and potato chips on the side.  Good stuff!

I didn't have dill weed but everything else was used. I did add a little blue cheese dressing. Was great on some garden tomato.

This was great!  Made exactly as written, and with grilled chicken breasts.  Even the finicky eaters loved it. It's now on the rotation.  Changes for next time might be a little less dill weed and red pepper; only because it would dial it in more to our family's tastes.  Try it first, as written, and you won't regret it.

The BEST chicken salad I've ever had.  Followed the recipe exactly with few minor tweak, using light Mayo, sour cream, garlic & onion powders.  Served it on lettuce cups with a side of oven baked tomatoes adorned with Romano cheese.  This will be my to go recipe for chicken salad.
Thank you so much for sharing your recipe with us all.

This was a super yummy chicken salad recipe. It made enough for me to pack my lunches all week. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream to be a little healthier. And instead of dill weed I used tarragon (because I had it in the house) and then I added some paprika for a little kick. SO GOOD!! Definitley will make this again.

I made this tonight and my husband and I really enjoyed it. The only things I did different then the recipe. I omitted the celery and the dill because I didn't have them. But this was wonderful without them. 
I will be keeping this recipe and making it again.

So delicious. Only changes I made were using white onion instead of red, and I didn't measure the mayo and sour cream, just put in relatively equal parts until it was as saucy as I'd like. The dill weed is a great addition!

Excellent chicken salad recipe.  I used the extra chicken I had after making chicken noodle soup (the whole chicken was boiled in the stock) and it was fabulous.  I was hesitant to use the full amount of dill after reading reviews, but I did and it was not at all overpowering.  I made sure to finely dice the celery and bell pepper so the texture would not be too crunchy.  I served it on croissants.  Thank you so much for the recipe!  This will now be a staple in my house.

I love the combination of the chicken and salty feta cheese.  The chopped pepper (I only had a green pepper on hand, and it  worked fine) and onion with a good amount of dill made this very tasty!   I'd been looking for a recipe that wouldn't fade away between the bread slices, and this is the one!

Absolutely loved it, and it was a hit with the family. Had pre-grilled chicken breast, so it was a quick and easy dinner. I did only use half the amount of mayonnaise and sour cream, and I'm glad I started with that, because it would have been WAY too mushy/wet otherwise. Added a bunch of garlic powder, dill, lemon pepper, gave it some nice spice. Will DEFINITELY make this one again. Also, we use olive oil mayonnaise, which is very rich and creamy. If I hadn't already had sour cream, I would have gotten plain Greek yogurt instead, and I think it will be very good with that too.

Delicious! I used cold grilled chicken, substituted plain nonfat Greek yogurt for the sour cream, and Smart Balance canola oil mayo for the full mayo. About 5 ounces of that over a bed of mixed greens was a nice dinner.

My first go at Chicken Salad. Made a few tiny substitutions based on what I had on hand (as we all do). Will probably make this version every-other time to keep it interesting.

This is such a great base recipe for Chicken Salad! I usually use Athenos Tomato Basil Feta. I also usually cut out the sour cream and use more mayo, and replace the onion for a dash of onion powder. I just don't buy sour cream nor onions. I also recently added some cucumber chunks for added freshness and veggies. This is great in a pita pocket, sandwich bread, and also on top of a spinach salad with tomatoes.

03-23-16 ~ Oh my goodness, this is one of the BEST chicken salad recipes I've ever made. The feta cheese changes the entire taste of the salad. We LOVED this recipe. I made as listed and served DH's in a wrap and mine on sliced tomatoes. This is the best recipe I've made in 2016. Definitely will be making this one again!

I had nearly all the ingredients for this in my fridge. Was looking for something to use up leftover rotisserie chicken. Made exactly as stated, with the exception of using lite sour cream, which was all I had, and a couple of shakes of hot pepper flakes. This is SO good! I've been low carb for nearly two months and this was just the ticket! Going to halve some Campari tomatoes and stuff them with this salad, for once my husband is envious of MY food! (I'll share) Five stars times infinity, can't wait to see if it gets better after 24 hours!

Great chicken salad recipe.  I'm not a fan of chicken salads with fruit and nuts so this fit the bill.  We made it a little healthier by switching the mayo and sour cream with Greek yogurt and basil pesto.  The pesto also replaces the dill if you don't have it.

Oh my goodness, this recipe is SO good.  I omitted the red onion all together, and used less of the mayo than called for, and added oregano and other italian seasonings instead of dill and the result is like angels in my mouth.

Man is this chicken salad recipe delicious. The only change was out of necessity. I forgot to pick up sour cream and had to use greek yogurt instead. Oh, and I bought a cooked rotisserie chicken  from my local grocery store so I would not have to cook. Let me say it again; easy and delicious.

Easy to throw together and tastes great! Veggies can be changed out for what you have on hand. I'll only put in 3oz of feta next time - a little too sour for my tastes. Tomorrow's lunch on a tortilla!

This is super easy to make and it's delicious! My husband and I both loved it, followed the recipe as is, no need to change anything. We had it over green leaf lettuce one night and I've also used it in wraps for lunches. This is a keeper and will be making many more times! Thanks for the recipe!

This is an unbelievable twist on chicken salad.  I'm going to 5-star this recipe because its worth it as is, however I made the following changes out of necessity:  * 2 cups of chicken (I didn't have 3) and it was the perfect consistency for chicken salad as I'm used to. * Next time I will cut back on the sour cream and add more mayo. It was a little watery and a tiny too different for me. I'll try 6 T mayo/4 T sour cream. * I didn't have any bell pepper, so I used 3/4 if a kirby cucumber (seeded and diced).  I figured it was close enough to a Tzatziki sauce to make it work, and I was right.  If I'm going to make chicken salad and I have the ingredients, I'll find the extra 15 minutes it takes to make this.    SUPERB.

These were pretty good. I added sauted broccoli slaw and onions. I do think it needed a little heat so next time I may add a dash of chili powder or hot sauce

I made this for 17 quilters at a retreat, and they all loved it!  I used low fat mayo and low fat sour cream, left out the onion and sliced the peppers to garnish the top.  I will make this again!

This was fantastic! I used canned chicken and basil instead of dill. I also added grapes which went extremely well with feta. In the future I'll add some kind of nuts for some added crunch. All in all--awesome!

I don't know what I did wrong, but I found the salad to get kind of watery. Maybe it was the mayo I used or something, but I didn't really love it.

I love this salad!  It needs no changes just fine as is.  It makes some of the best chicken salad sandwiches I have ever had.  Whenever I make this up it is usually all gone in 2 days and their is only 2 of us.  Thankyou for a great recipe!

I made this for a baby shower last weekend and it was a hit! There were no left overs. I followed the recipe as written. I used tomato basil feta and instead of onion, I used onion powder. The red bell pepper was the perfect touch, not to mention gave such a pretty color! I can't wait to make it again.

This was a very good chicken salad. I did make a few changes.  I added lemon pepper and a pinch of kosher salt. I didn't have feta so I used blue chees. I also added a 1/4 cup of dried cranberries to add some sweetness.  I had diced the celery but I think I would like it next time with the celery sliced into the half moons for more texture.

This is good chicken salad.  It doesn't hold together like chicken salad typically does, but that's not really a problem.  I ate it on whole wheat bread, but I don't think that was the best bread choice for this recipe.

I made this chicken salad for my birthday party two days ago, it was fantastic! I made two changes though - to the mayonaise or miracle whip and sour cream I added about three tblsps of medium salsa to give a little kick. I also had a bit of raw broccoli left in the fridge which I chopped and added. Made it the night before so the chicken could soak up all the flavor. Will make this again for sure! Thank you.

This recipe was excellent. I nixed the celery since my husband isn't a fan and added diced cucumbers instead. I couldn't stop eating out of the bowl I mixed it in. Next time, I'll add a little more sour cream and a little less mayo, just my taste. The red bell pepper really made this salad.

One of the best chicken salad recipes I've come across. I didn't have regular dill, so I used my Pampered Chef dill mix, and it turned out great. I really enjoy a lot of crunch in my chicken salads, so next time I might add walnuts, but other than that- it was great!

Very good recipe.  I used leftover chicken that had been baked in the oven though.  It was a little dried out.  Next time, I will probably boil a whole chicken just for the salad.  I also left out the celery and sour cream and added in      some dried Italian herbs.  I didn't add any additional salt because the feta cheese I used (Anthos garlic herb flavor) was salty enough.

While okay, it's quite heavy in taste. The feta-mayonnaise combo is a little icky.

This was pretty tasty and I liked the feta with the chicken.  But it was a bit oniony.  Perhaps halving the onion would be a good idea.

This was great!!! It was so easy, I used leftover grilled chicken breasts from the night before.  I didn't have fresh red peppers on hand, but used  about 1/4 cup of cut up roasted red peppers. my husband loved it.. I will definately make this again, I love the crunch of the red peppers so next time I will use fresh.

I used one pouch and two cans of chicken.  I did not have a red onion on hand so I used dried, minced onion from the spice jar.  It was delicious!  For the reviewers that claim you cannot use canned chicken, they are wrong and not on a budget.  I had all of the ingredients on hand and wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks for a great recipe!

OMG. Didn't change a thing.  Definitely use cooked chicken as opposed to the can.  I love canned for quick enchiladas, but taking a bit of time to boil a couple breasts will make all the difference in texture.  Absolutely wonderful.

I made this last night for lunches this week and it is fantastic. Great flavors, nice break from the classic chicken salad. I am low carbing it so I will have it on lettuce but my husband thought it would be great on a nice toasty bread. If you like these flavors, it is a must try!

This is an awesome chicken salad, my fiance requests it for his lunch regularly! I excluded the bell pepper because we dont care for them much, and for the chicken I just bought the already prepared and chopped chicken pieces near the cold cuts at the grocery store. I added some garlic salt as well. Athena makes a really good garlic & herbs feta cheese that I used. This is really yummy!

Like most people, I altered the recipe a bit.  I used garlic and herb feta (YUM!) and instead of mayo (I can't stand it) I used whipped cream cheese.  It was pretty good, and actually I have found that it tastes the best a day or two later!  I put it on toast, and I really like it.  I will most likely make it again, although it's hard for me to get ahold of cooked chicken!

Very good!! A great way to add in a few more veggies, too. I used green onion instead of red because that's what I had.

Really a good recipe.  I made it for a bridal shower and served on croissants.  I went real easy on the red pepper, probably only using about 1/4-1/2 the amount called for.   But I'm not a huge pepper fan, and neither were some of the other ladies at the shower.  Even so, the peppers tasted pretty good even though I don't usually like them.  The sour cream lends an interesting tang, which I did hear a comment on when I passed out a list of all the evening's recipes.  Someone mentioned they knew there was more than mayo in the recipe.  This had just enough interest above the regular chicken salad, and it was good.  I used Costco rotisserie chickens, made it the night before, and it made plenty for all the guests and kept well.  Not the hit of the night, but everyone did like it.
