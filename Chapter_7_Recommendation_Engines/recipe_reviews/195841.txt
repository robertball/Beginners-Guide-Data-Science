This is an incredibly good “tavern,” especially when you take into account it’s made with turkey and not beef.  It has a nice seasoning and gets bonus points because it does not use ketchup.  The tavern (a.k.a. loose meat sandwich) originated in the 1920s.  It’s nothing more than browned ground beef that contains very little or even no seasoning what-so-ever.  It caught on quickly with businesses because it was cheap, easy, and “one-sandwich-fits-all.”  It was served on a bun and via a condiments bar, the customer could create their own sandwich by adding whatever toppings or sauces they desired.  It could be turned into a traditional topped hamburger/cheeseburger, sloppy joe, etc.   The only thing that’s changed with the modern day tavern is the number of ways it’s served.   I’ve seen many organizations use these for fundraisers, giving the customer the choice of having it served on a bun, tortilla, hard shell taco, or even fry bread.  The combinations are endless.

This was really good!  I used only 1lb. of turkey meat and just cut back a little on all the ingredients.  I added a little salt in the end, served them on hamburger buns with American cheese.  This recipe is a keeper.

Made this recipe as written, using powdered chipotle seasoning in place of chili powder.  My picky 10 yr old ate it in a tortilla, and my husband liked it on a bun with barbecue sauce.  Overall a hit, and I will be adding this to our rotation. Thanks!

I sampled the mixture just before adding the remaining mustard and jalapenos.  Didn't seem at all "hot".  Next time I will use 1/4 teaspoon cayenne and 1/4 teaspoon chili powder.  However, found the amount of jalapenos too hot--too overpowering, so will cut down to 1/8 cup.  Tried the mixture as a burger, in pitas and tortillas.  Thought the tortillas were by far the tastiest.

I played around with this a bit since my kids don't care for jalapeno.  I used 2 lbs turkey, same on the onion and garlic, , then filled the bottom of the pan with white cooking wine and added larger amounts of mustard, salt and pepper and then cooked it down until the liquid was mostly gone.  I put it on a whole wheat hamburger bun with swiss cheese and it was great - my kids drowned it in ketchup but they still ate it!  We actually fed 4 of us for 2 nights and had some left over.

I made this last night for the first time, it was very good.  I've tried various tavern recipes trying to find one we all like, my daughter will not eat anything with "barbeque" flavor.  This one was it.  I did make one minor change, my husband does not like jalapenos so I substituted 1/4 cup of salsa and added it with the water.  It took a little longer for the liquid to evaporate but it was delicious.

A little on the dry side for my taste.  It feels like it should have a thicker sauce to it.  The fresh jalapeno gives it a great kick.  And we ate it with some baby swiss cheese and spicy mayo - which I recommend.

I made this exactly as written and just thought it was OK.  To me it just tasted like spicy ground turkey, couldn't find any flavor besides that.  I like the versatility and ease of the dish though. Thank you for sharing, I'm glad I tried it.  It's something different which is always good!

I'm the recipe's creator. To cut down on the amount of fat, make sure that you're using ground turkey breast or lean ground turkey meat. Regular ground turkey is about as fattening as regular ground beef! Thanks and hope that you enjoy! =)

We felt the mustard was too strong and the dish too hot overall.  We will not make this again.
