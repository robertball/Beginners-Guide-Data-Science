Wonderful!  I made a batch with exactly what you had for my hubby and I made a lower carb version for myself.  They both turned out awesome!  FYI...lower carb I omited the fruit and flour.  I added two scoops of low-carb protein powder and 2 T peanut butter.  They were great.  I'm going to experiment with this base recipe using bananas, blueberries, dried cranberries....wow the options are endless.  Thanks so much!!!  A++++++

Delicious and filling!!!! I make a few changes like adding chocolate protien powder instead of flour (as suggested by another user)and omitting the brown sugar and oil. if you use protien powder it will sweeten the bars without the additional sugar. I use dried cherries for the fruit and a little more applesauce to compensate for the lack of oil. They hold together really nicely, even when I throw them in my bookbag for a snack between classes. Tasty brain food.

I've made these several times over the past two weeks and have really enjoyed being able to swap out the major flavor makers. The first batch was by the recipe using dried cranberries for the fruit and sliced almonds for the nuts. I added in a little coconut and left out the sunflower seeds b/c I didn't have any. They came out good - but these are VERY HIGH FIBER! Just so you know!  My husband didn't care for the flavor of the first batch. He requested a second which I just made with: pumpkin seeds, dried goji berries, ground flax seeds(in place of 1/2 of the flour), a little coconut and a handful of whole almonds. There wasn't enough crunch in the first batch for him - so these are perfect. I almost doubled the cinnamon too since there are a lot of flavors going on and I think it goes nicely with the nuttiness of the flax. I made a batch with chocolate chips and coconut (coconut oil in place of vegetable) for my 5 & 3 year old with great success - next time I'll leave out the cinnamon with that one though. I also made a tropical version for me with dried papaya, pineapple and coconut. Thank you for a great basic recipe that is SO quick, easy and healthful. Play around to make it suit your taste and health needs!

Way good!  I doubled the applesauce and bars really had a great texture.  Used sesame seeds, almonds, flax seeds, sunflower seeds, raisins.  Would be great with any seed/nut/dried fruit combination.

I love this recipe. My husband is on his way home from work he gets very grouchy because he is hungry. I hated spending the big bucks on a box of air (granola bars) and he was never satisfied with them. I came across your recipe and have made them ~ well I make them 3 times a week and he eats them on his way home. My husband loves these and says they are filling. I will never buy another box of air for the big bucks agian!!This recipe is so versatile that I make it several ways. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Keeeeeeeeeper!! Love it. Very chewy and not too sweet. I used chopped dates, which were somewhat sweet and dried cranberries. I could taste the cinnamon, very good. I'm actualy about to make them again right now. They work well as snack for school. I will try some changes like sesame seed or poppy seed, prunes or figs and peanuts. The one thing I changed was the amount of apple sauce. I increased it to 3/4 cup. It was easy to spread. Thank you.

I make this recipe at least once a week!Love this recipe. I have  5 kids, so I like to make my own granola bars for cost savings and better nutrition.

This is an easily adaptable recipe. I've used all kinds of fruit purees instead of apple sauce. Some favourite combinations are cherry/ coconut/ white choc chip (just a few for fun!) and pumpkin puree with pumpkin seeds and pumpkin pie spices. 

We are a nut free home and school, so I've tried lots of things to "fill" out the bar, including flax and all kinds of other seeds, soy nuts, Grape Nuts, bran buds, coconut, you name it. Almost  everything has worked!

I double the recipe and use a parchment lined 9 x 13 pan, then after it's baked and cooled for about 10 minutes, I flip the whole thing out and cut into bars. I let those cool a little longer, then wrap them individually so they are ready to go into lunches or as snacks. I get about 18 -24 bars this way.

I love this recipe!  I've made this recipe a dozen times, using different dried fruit, omitting the nuts and adding chocolate whey-more protein (I'm a sports-nut). It never fails, never is dry and using chocolate covered raisins make them a bit sinful but always delicious!

Instead of a bag of dried fruit, I snipped dried apricots and added some dried cranberries; chocolate chips in place of nuts.  I only had salted sunflower seeds, but I thought they were fine in the recipe.  These are equally good as bars or crumbled as granola... (a tip for making a better bar shape: press on the top of the bars immediately after removing from the oven with the back of a fork or spatula.  When they are cool, they will stay together better.)

I make these once a week and they are better than any store bought bar, IMO.  Changes I make:  protein powder for flour, add 1TB almond butter, reduce brown sugar to 1 TB, use slivered almonds, pumpkinseeds, flax seeds, seasame seeds.  Omit dried fruit.  Love them!!!!

Best healthy bar recipe on this site. Was scared of dry & over baked bars so only baked for 20 min & then they sat in the pan for 10 min. Only changes - Used motts no sugar blueberry applesauce & only a half cup of dates & dried cranberries. came out chewy, tasty & delish. So much so I have no desire to look for other recipes like this.  Thx for sharing!

These were really easy to make.  I substituted some ingredients to make a higher protein, lower calorie bar.  I left out the Grape Nuts, oil, brown sugar, seeds, dried fruit and nuts. I added an extra egg, used 15g of artificial sweetener, 150g blueberries, 100g of apple sauce, 20g of sesame seeds and 20g of peanut butter.  The texture came out quite moist, so next time I might leave out some of the apple sauce to achieve a crunchier bar.  With my substitutions, it comes out as 104 calories per serving.

Yum!  Made a chocolate version so I changed things a bit:
1/2 cup of oats, 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup of cocoa, 1/8 cup of flax seed, 1/8 cup of wheat germ.  Kept the grapenuts the same, and omitted the cinnamon for vanilla extract.  Lined with parchment paper instead of foil to save on spraying w/ oil (less fat).  Awesome!  The combinations are endless....

I am so....glad to find this recipe. I was recently in Canton Ohio on business and we ordered lunch from a neat health conscience resturant that had Power Balls. We had them and they were wonderful....this sounds as it could be the same thing and I will make them today. Thank you.

These are amazing! Overall, great nutrition - depending on how much sugar is added via the dried fruit - very filling and EPIC tasty (my stepson's review).  The modification I made was inadvertent because I wasn't paying attention: I used 1/3 cup of organic unsweetened apple sauce and 1/3 cup of raw honey.  It made the bars moist and chewy so I will keep making them this way!

This is great!  A friend who is hypo glycemic loved it as it didn't affect her sugars and is now also making this recipe all of the time.  I did sub out one key thing - I used coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil.  Melted it in the microwave first and it turned out great.  Much healthier this way!  I also added dried cranberries with orange flavor and it is super yummy!  Oh, and I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9 x 13 pan - greased with coconut oil and without the aluminum foil.  No problems getting them out of the pan.  Easy and yummy!

Excellent and very easy to customize to your own tastes!  I subbed a few items to ou families taste...omitted oil and used peanut butter instead.  Used protein powder instead of wheat flour, doubled the cinnamon and doubled the whole recipe to fit a 9x13 pan.  Wonderful!!!!

They taste really good. I tried them with dried cherries for a variation and these were good too. One note though, made as per the recipe the calories are closer to 300, not 197. They do have 6 grams of fibre though so that's pretty good for breakfast.

Awesome bar! I didn't have the cereal so I threw in more oats. Left out the oil and didn't use as much dried fruit. I didn't think they would hold together but they do. I only cooked mine for about 18 minutes. I love that there is no butter in this recipe. Thanks!

These were wonderful...be sure to let them set.  The night I made them I wasn't that impressed.  They sat in the fridge overnight and I was amazed at how great they were the next day.

Really great base recipe.  I made the following minor substitutions/changes: (1) Used garbanzo flour instead of wheat to make them gluten-free; (2) used agave sweetener instead of honey and omitted the brown sugar; (3) used a mixture of almonds, cashews, pepitas, raisins, cranberries, mini white and chocolate chips, and dried pineapple; (4) added a heaping tablespoon of natural style peanut butter; (5) used Barbara's multi-grain cereal; (6) greased the foil with coconut oil.  I will never buy another store-bought granola bar.  Love that I can control the fat and sugar in these and there's no preservatives!

I modified this recipe but still want to give it a 5-star rating for the inspiration. ;) I used 2 cups of Almond Maple Granola (from this website) to replace the oats and nuts, one tablespoon of canola oil, and added 1/4 cup each natural crunchy peanut butter, chopped dates, cherry Craisins, and 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips. They are a hit with my husband who thinks they taste like oatmeal cookies, and they will provide a nice energy boost for him as a mid-morning snack.

I used one half cup chopped dry roasted peanuts instead of sunflower seeds/walnuts and because I did not have mixed dried fruit, I used organic raisins. I made no other changes or subtitutions. We all loved these bars. Both my kids came home from school and asked for one to snack on until dinner and my husband asked for what was left to be packed in his lunch for tomorrow. Success!

Excellent Recipe! Had to make one change with the sugar as I didn't have brown sugar and didn't want to use white, so I used 1 tbsp of maple syrup. It's possible the recipe could have done without the sugar entirely considering the sugar from the dried fruit! Dried fruit I used was: apricots, cranberries, raisens, dates, and cherries. Am looking forward to trying others! Will be making again!

Another way to change it up is to substitute baby food for the applesauce (may I suggest apricot). It’s cheap and easy to come by. 

Such a versatile recipe, I love it.

These are kind of hard to review because for taste I'd probably give it two stars.  I thought they where not sweet enough and tasted kind of bland, the kids hated them....but, husband loved them, along with a few other adults I offered them to.   Very easy to put together and set up well, plus they are so healthy!    These are great for breakfast on the go, instead of the junk my kids want to grab--that's why I'm going to 'play' with this recipe and try adding 1/2 c. chocolate chips and/or some p'nut butter.  I did end up wrapping each one individually and stored in the refrig.--I did think they tasted better after the 2nd day.

These are absolutely delicious and so nutritious - one of my favorites!  A great snack after a work-out with lots of water to replenish lost energy stores!

I thought these were exceptional! I decided to do 7oz of mixed fruit and 1oz chocolate chips. I splashed some extra oats and applesauce in to balance that out.  I also added flax and chia seeds. I cut and wrap a bar for myself each morning for breakfast! VERY GOOD!

Such a simple recipe! I didn't have any Grapenuts, so I did 1 c quick-cooking oats, and 1/2 c rolled oats.  I added dried cranberries and chopped up almonds, and it was so yummy.  I only added 1 T of sugar, because I was worried they would be too sweet with the dried fruit.  I'll likely add the full amount next time, but they were still delicious.  The bars definitely taste better after sitting the fridge for a while, so be patient!  It's worth the wait!

Fairly decent flavour but certainly not a bar you can eat on the run.  Made them twice but will not be doing them again.

Well, Power Bars is an accurate description.  These are healthier than the store-bought power bars, but they don't taste much better and they have that same weird texture.

This is a great base recipe!! I usually double the recipe and make a few changes. I use egg whites instead of a whole egg (1/4 cup egg whites = 1 egg), add a mashed banana, add coconut, and a mixture of flaxseed meal, wheat bran, and wheat germ. I also add chocolate chips to half of the mixture for my boyfriend. Thanks!!

These are awesome!  So easy to make and delicious!  I made two batches.  The first I substituted maple syrup for the vegetable oil.  I used raisins and cranberries for the fruit.  The second batch I made I substituted 3 T. peanut butter for the brown sugar, then I added raisins and chocolate chips for a gorp-like bar.  I also doubled the applesauce in the second batch and it came out great!  I will make these again.  Next I want to try a tropical fruit medley with pineaple, mango, and apricot.

My kids love these and really feel like they are getting a treat.  Some things I changed, though, based on what was in my pantry & personal preferences:  1.  Did not have Grape Nuts or sunflower seeds, so excluded those; 2. Used 3/8 C applesauce-no oil; 3. Substituted 1/4 C Molasses for the brown sugar; 4. Used 1/3 C Craisins; 5. Added a pinch of salt and 1/4 C Wheat Germ.  Next time I might even add a little vanilla...  Lots of possibilites!  Great recipe to get creative with.  Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe! It's so versatile and so much better than boxed granola bars... I like to skip the cinnamon and put in a tsp. of vanilla, 1/2 cup peanuts, 1/4 cup chocolate chips and 1/4 cup coconut or raisins.  Also good is 1/4 tsp. almond extract, 1/2 cup toasted almonds and 1/2 cup dried, chopped cherries.  And I like to put in mixed dried fruit, cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. vanilla and walnuts, too. They're awesome - you can have a different bar every time!

These bars are excellent!  I used milk chocolate chips, currents, and dried cranberries, I also added hemp seed for a nutrition boost.  I also leave out the sugar, the honey and applesauce is enough.

I really loved this! My husband is doing the 24 day challenge through advocare so I've been trying to find new snacks for him and this is perfect! I just added special k protein+ cereal to it since I don't have grape nuts, threw in some coconut and soy nuts in there too. Also, I added more honey than it called for cause I read that honey by itself is great to take when you need a boost of energy. Added some quinoa too. Didn't have any applesauce around so that was left out. Maybe next time. Super yummy!!

I love this! I had to use white flour but I am using wheat next time. I am not a fan of dried fruit so I cut it all up and just added less. I love having one of these bars and a bowl of pineapple, blueberries, & strawberries. I love it!

These are simply fantastic without deviating from the recipe. I've made them several times now and I like to add flax seed, almonds, pecans, and two tablespoons of peanut butter. I leave out the vegetable oil and drop in a tablespoon of canola oil, but none of those are really necessary...these are great as is and certainly don't need any assistance from me. Thanks for the recipe Arielle.

These are delicious! My changes: 1 tbs sunflower oil, 1 tbs sesame oil (omega 3's!) used almonds instead of sunflower seeds. Added 2 tbs coconut flakes. doubled the cinnamon. Substituted half the flour for flax seed meal (protein!) for the fruit....I did 3 tbs raisins and 3 tbs dried papaya. Amazing! I can't wait to experiment with other nuts, fruits, extracts, etc. Thank you:D

If you have have a gluten free life this is perfect! It is a great alternative for the "granola" bars at the store (some have hidden wheat or processed in a wheat environment ), and healthier. All of us in the family love them. I use rice flour for a gluten free recipe. I also omit the cereal,at no expense to the flavor, and use raisins for the fruit.  My son now feels like he too can enjoy what the other kids are having... they are jealous because his is better than the store bought bars :-)

Based on other reviews, I omitted the vegetable oil and brown sugar, and added 2/3 cup of applesauce.  I also did not have a wheat/barley cereal so added a bit more flour (about 1/4 cup).  Based on others suggestions I added 2 tbsp. peanut butter to make sure they were chewy enough.  The raw dough was the consistency of cookie dough.  These turned out fabulous!  Based on my changes, i think they needed a bit more sugar and will try again with chocolate chips.  It is a great recipe for those that prefer a chewier granola bars.

I like how these take very little of the ingredients required - so a small amount of stuff in the cupboards produces on-the-go breakfasts for a week! Saves me $$$ at the quick market, too!  I made the base of this exactly as called for but changed the mix-ins (kept the walnuts, put in 1/2 c. shredded coconut & 1/2 c. choco. chips.) and did not get the "chewy" texture others reported. However, Hubby & I enjoy the 'health bar' flavor and texture.  My second batch I removed the br. sugar and replaced it with molasses and traded half the wheat flour for buckwheat flour. I added Chinese Seven spice, toasted sesame seeds and almond slivers. I traded a quarter of the oil for toasted sesame seed oil. Lastly I added dried cranberries and golden raisins. What a neat flavor! I'm already on my way to having this recipe memorized while my third & fourth batches bake :)

Delicious, easy to make, and WAY better for you than any breakfast bar you can buy @ the store.  

Mmmm!!  I've recommended this one to just about everyone I know.

I doubled the nuts, using both pecans and walnuts, and added a bit of coarsely chopped chocolate to the last batch and it turned out great.

THANK YOU!!

Just made these...trying to find a breakfast bar and this is it! I did change it up a little. I substituted the wheat flour for this peanut butter powder(picture), I used coconut oil for the veg oil. Almonds instead of walnuts and pecans instead of sunnies.

This is so good you may as well just double the recipe and use a 9 X 13 pan!  I used Old Fashioned rolled oats with no problems, omitted the oil and increased the applesauce.  I used the regular amount of honey but decreased the brown sugar and probably didn't need any sugar at all with the fruits I used.  Dried apricot, cranberries, raisons, and coconut were my additions.  I was impressed how they came out looking like those fancy Kashi granola bars in the box.... only much better!

These power bars are very satisfying!  I've made them several times and find myself wanting to eat them all throughout the day.  Instead of vegetable oil, I add a little more applesauce and honey.  It seems to work out just as well.  I'll be continuing to make these for a long time!

Very good!  Was not crumbly at all, taste was good.  I didn't add as much dried fruit as suggested (I didn't have enough).  If I would have, it would have been top notch.  I added about half and it was a mix of dried cranberries and pecans.  Will keep the pecans in, just add more of the mix next time.  Thank you for the recipe!

Excellent! I replaced half the wheat flour with rice protein (extra nutrition) and used pecans, sesame seeds, cranberries and raisins (everything else exact). They are wonderful and my 3 teenagers like them as well. One hint, they taste not so good out of the oven but when you chill them over night in the fridge....SO good!! I can't wait to try some variations. This is a keeper and I will keep on hand for quick breakfasts on the go. Thank you!!

Very tasty!  I've decided to start eating clean, and this was one of the first recipes I reached for.  I've had it in my Recipe Box for a little while, and was impressed by the reviews and the versatility of the recipe itself.  Made my first batch with sliced almonds instead of walnuts, and dried mixed berries.  I also used the recipe for Sara's Applesauce (found here at Allrecipes) rather than store-bought.  Since that has cinnamon in it, I halved the cinnamon for the power bars.  Thanks for such a great base recipe!  I will definitely be making this again!

These granola bars are really good! I used raisins and chopped prunes for my fruit, so I think it made it too sweet with the honey and brown sugar (I don't like much sweet anyway). I used chocolate whey protein instead of flour and unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil. I will try different fruits next time and for sure I will use more nuts and less fruit and probably not use any brown sugar at all. Thanks for the recipe, Arielle! :)

These turned out pretty bland.  Perhaps adding a cup of chocolate chips to the mix would make them taste better.

My only regret is that I didn't try these months ago!  I've been looking for something to replace store-bought granola bars and these are perfect.  I can make a double batch and put half in the freezer.  Amazingly, they're almost too sweet for me with all the dried fruit.  I followed the recipe almost completely.  Left out the sunflower seeds and subbed raisin bran for the Grape-Nuts, as someone else suggested.  Next time I'll experiment, for sure, including leaving out the brown sugar.    Be sure not to overbake--that would make these bars dry.

OMG these are so good I just ate 2 of them.   I did not want to use nuts because I have young children, so I subbed 1 1/2 cups of coconut flakes, raisins & chocolate chips for the fruit & nut portion.  I also used old fashioned oats since I do not have any quick.  Oh, also left out the cinnamon and instead added a dash of vanilla.  Next time I will try adding mashed banana instead of the oil & may try adding flax seed or wheat germ.  Love these!  Thanks so much.

These have a nice flavor.  I substituted more applesauce for the oil, pecans instead of walnuts, and dried cranberries instead of the mixed fruit.  They are tasty, easy to make and healthy.

This recipe is amazing!   Not only delicious and a huge hit at our house but it's hugely versatile.   Taking tips from other reviewers, I was able to custom fit the bars to our tastes and what I had on hand.   I left out the nuts (inadvertently) and used molasses in place of the oil.   Substituted All-Bran Buds for the GrapeNuts and a combination of ground flax and protein powder for the flour.    I'll definitely be making these again.

These were FIRE. Easy to make and tasted awesome. Like others, I substituted chocolate protein powder for the flour and omitted the oil and brown sugar. I added dried pineapple for the fruit and some sliced raw almonds and flaxseed. Turned out great and can make so many different variations so it will never get old

Very filling and not super sweet... just what I wanted! I used dried cranberries instead of dried mixed fruit.  I only had a really big bag, so I used about 1-1/2c and it was perfect.  They were a big hit! Update: I saw a commercial for the weight loss aid "Full Bar" and was curious to see what was in them. To my delight, the ingredients are VERY similar to the ingredients in these bars. It would be much less expensive alternative to purchasing bars on the Internet!

Thank you, Thank you, Thank you for this recipe.  I've been trying different power bar and granola bar recipes for years, but never found the right mix.  Until this one, that is!!  This recipe is so versatile!!  I made lots of changes from other suggestions of reviews, but it's wonderful every time, no what I add to it. Left out the oil, added more applesauce, used protein powder instead of flour, used organic stevia instead of brown sugar.  And then it's a "free for all"!  What ever nuts, grains, seeds or fruit I happen to have on hand.  Again, thank you so much, the search is over for the perfect power bar.

A really good, versatile recipe.  I used all organic ingredients to really boost the nutritional value. I also added a bag of trail mix that had nuts, coconut, and dried fruit all in one. It is very hearty and a great energy snack for my active family.

This was a pretty good recipe however it came out very sweet. Next time I will add only 1 tablespoon brown sugar or possibly omit it completely. Also to suit the recipe to my nutrition desire I will add 1 cup of applesauce so that I can use only 1/2 tablespoon of oil. I will also try adding an extra egg and and extra cup of grapenuts so that there will be more protein. The cooking method in general (time, temp etc) was perfect and they came out nicely. I will definitely use this recipe again as it is a great base that can be "tweeked" time and time again to keep from getting bored. THANKS JO-ANN!!

I made these without all the nuts and  dried fruit cuz I didn't have any and used 2 cups of unsweetened wheat puffs instead of the 2 other cereals and I added chocolate chips.  I also followed another reviewer that said to add 2 TBS of protein whey powder and 3 TBS of peanut butter.  My husband, who usually can't stand anything made with oatmeal ate the entire pan.  He said they were far better than any granola bar from the store.  I also used a 9 in pan lined with sprayed foil and didn't have a problem with sticking.  Great recipe.  Can't wait to try with fruits and nuts.

I definately did something wrong. Mine didn't stick together! I did substitute brown sugar splenda, so that might have been why? I used Fiber One instead of Grape Nuts and yogurt covered raisins instead of dried fruit.  It still came out DELICIOUS! I just put it in separate bags to take as trail mix. I will try it again without substitutions and hopefully they will make bars!

A nice tasty snack! I used Craisins for the dried fruit, substituted apple butter for the applesauce, granola for the Grape Nuts, and omitted the sunflower seeds. We love having granola bars in the house I think it would be fun to experiment with different variations of this recipe to find your favorite combination. Thanks!

These are incredibly moist bars and so easy to make! I tried it for the first time a week ago, substituting almonds for the original nuts/seeds, adding in coconut flakes and using coconut oil instead of vegetable. Although I enjoyed them they were a bit bland for my tastes.  I made them again a few days later with the following changes and they turned out amazing! Here is my version:  2T brown sugar instead of 3T, used melted refined coconut oil (again), upped the applesauce (natural) to 1/3 c., chopped peanuts for the nuts, vanilla protein powder instead of flour, left out the cinnamon, added one large banana - slightly mashed, added dried cranberries, handful of raisins, a sprinkling of chocolate chips and chia seeds, 1/2 t. Boulder Salt for the added nutrition, and 2T. of powdered coconut water (for the extra potassium).  This version turned out so well and was so easy that I made them 3 more times over the next couple of days! I shared them with many others and everyone loves them!  Thanks to the versatility of this recipe I plan to make a different version every week!

Based on taste these were really good. The only thing I didn't like was that they are crumbly which does not make them a good "grab n go" bar. They were very easy to make and made the house smell good. I think folks are going a little over board with all the changes they are making considering they are already very healthy and there is very little oil in them to begin with. I added flax seeds and choc chips to mine. I will make these again!

So pleased to have found a versatile recipe for granola bars.  Here are a few comments...
1) Done 'as is' the recipe comes out more cereal bar consistency than granola bar.  I like mine a little crunchier so with the second batch, I formed them into bars before baking and they came out perfect!  I saw a few reviewers doubling up the applesauce, so be aware before you decide to do this.
2) In lieu of the walnuts & fruits, you can substitute the same 1.5 cups of anything.  We've tried mango with shredded and diced coconut and choc chip and coconut so far - delicious!
3) Taste before adding egg for sweetness.  I actually only put 2 tbs. sugar and less honey bec I was using dried fruit which was already sweet.  Plus, the 'raw dough' is delicious bec it has the crunch of the Grape Nuts :)

I make these weekly instead of buying expensive bars. I use a variety of mix-ins, depending on what I have on hand. Our favorite is probably coconut, almond, and chocolate chip. If I add flaxseed and chia seed, I add a little more applesauce, some baby food prunes, or an extra egg white for additional moisture. I double the recipe but use only 1/4 cup of brown sugar. It fits nicely in a 13x9 pan for 24 bars. Love this recipe!

Delish! A great alternative to chewy granola bars. These are packed with more nutrition and are very satisfying. I used coconut oil and added a scoop of chia seeds and sesame seeds. I've replaced the dried fruit with chocolate chips but the dried fruit is great too. Whatever fits your mood.

The only change I made to this was to sub pecans for the walnuts. This is a great pick me up and very tasty.  I will be making this again. Thank  you for sharing it.

These were ok.  I brought them to work and the reaction was about 50/50.  I'm probably missing the point, but I'll try again but throw in some chocolate chips next time!

These power bars are awesome and my family has teeth and jaw problems and with the fruit it was to chewy so what we did was replace the fruit with 1/4 cup of chocolate chips and 1/4 cup of crasins. today we tried something new though we made a batch of 24 with 1/4 cup of chocolate chips and 1/4 cup of peanut butter chips with 1/2 a cup of crasins and they are delicious!

I doubled this recipe, and didn't stray at all, and these are not good!  I wanted them to be something my kids would eat, but they are dry, and a very strange texture.  The picture makes them appear as if they have some moisture in them, but   I would not ever make these again,

These are delicious!  And you can add just about anything to them.  I didn't have sunflower seeds or walnuts so I added peanuts and chopped pecans.  Based on another review I replaced the wheat flour with whey protein.  I omitted the honey, brown sugar and oil and instead added another 1/4 cup applesauce.  I also added 1/4 cup chocolate chips.  I'm not sure why the recipe calls for 7oz of dried fruit - 1/2 cup was good enough for me.

I tasted these straight out of the oven and was not a fan, but cut them up and put them in the fridge overnight and liked them much better. I used mini chocolate chips (about 1/3 cup) and peanuts instead of the fruit and other nuts. Great breakfast bar, keeps you going until lunch. Thanks for the recipe:)

I must've done something wrong. My recipe was not good as other cooks rated theirs...It had a strange texture, I tried crumbling it to go over yogurt and such but was still not good. So out to the birdies it went.

I wouldn't make these again. They are more of a cookie consistency, and don't hold their shape/crumble apart. Just a weird texture overall - not crunchy or chewy.

Easy, fast, great!  I used Fiber One cereal instead of grapenuts, pear butter instead of applesauce, mixed nuts and fruit from christmas (7oz came to about 1 1/8 cup), and no oil.  YUM!

I was looking for a way to get healthy calories into my son (picky eater, low weight) There were great! We added chopped apricots and currents (all we had for dried fruit and apricots are his favourite) and a handful of choclate chips (to get my son to eat them, always works). Only reason I gave it a 4 star is they were crumbly. THANKS!

This turned out great! Awesome meal substitute if you missed breakfast! I think the recipe could do with a pich of salt, though I made it as is except without cereal and used almonds and mixed health seeds (sunflower, pumkin seed, linsee, sesame seed) and mixed dried fruit and walnuts. You can actually use anything as long as the base recipe remains the same, because this works perfectly. Thanks for a great recipe :)

These are GOOD! I doubled the recipe and made 2 9x9 pans- one with dried blueberries and one with chocolate chips. I added flax seeds, used almonds instead of the walnuts, and used the Kashi version of Grape Nuts. Next time I will try and leave out some of the brown sugar and am going to try dried diced dried apricots!! This recipe is really limitless- which is GREAT!!

So good & so good for you! My kids loved these & they are very filling if you are looking to stave off hunger.  Took others suggestion & omitted the oil, instead added 3/4 c applesauce & only 2 Tbsp brown sugar.  I didn't have sunflower seeds so I used almonds & pecans with craisins- yum!  2nd batch I left out the brown sugar, used mini choc chips & coconut.  Very good, will definitely make again.

These were fantastic! My kids gobbled them up and you really could use just about any kind of fruits, nuts, and seeds that you want to make it your own. Be sure to let them cool COMPLETELY before you cut them or they can fall apart. Once they are cooled and refrigerated they stay firm and help together nicely.

These were great.  Everything in it is so healthy.  I omitted the cereal, upped the oats, upped the applesauce (organic, unsweetened), used agave instead of honey, skipped the brown sugar, oil & sunflower seeds.  I added flax seeds instead and only used dates and raisins.  Added a pinch of sea salt, some almonds and....bittersweet chocolate pieces.    Yeah, I went crazy and put everything in there but they are soft and delicious.  Can't wait to try a different combo next time!

I'm impressed! I made them for the first time last night... so easy to make! And my husband ate three bars just last night, lol, piggy! He said I should make more today... so, I am right now! I'm so happy he likes them! Hopefully they'll fill his belly much longer than the air-filled ones we buy at the store... he could eat a whole box of those without blinking an eye. That man is expensive to feed!

These were good, I didn't put any dried fruit, I put in 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips and 1/4 cup coconut flakes.  It gave it a little sweetness.  I liked them my husband however did not but of course it's because it was healthy and he's not a big fan of that.  I will definitely make these again.

I absolutely LOVE these! For my taste I leave out the fruit and use equal parts of almond, walnuts, and sunflower seeds. I also add in a ton of ground flax seeds. I'm happy to have something healthy for on the cheap. These are wonderful to make on your Sunday and divide equally for each day of the work week and take to work for a snack or on the go breakfast. People don't even know they are homemade!! Thanks for sharing...I will continue making time and time again!

I'm pretty impressed with this recipe.  I didn't have several of the ingredients, so I made a lot of substitutions and didn't really expect it to turn out well...but it's still delicious!  I didn't have grape nuts, so I put in Special K w/ Berries & nuts...I didn't have walnuts, so I put in extra sunflower seeds.  Substituted strawberry preserves for applesauce; blueberry syrup for honey and veg. oil.  It still all held together very well (it definitely helps if you press it firmly into the pan) and tastes delicious--a good sweet & salty bar.

This is a great base recipe! I usually try to follow posted recipes pretty close for my first try with it, but this one seemed to offer an easy outlet to adjust for taste. I made mine with crushed almonds, tart cherries, and a few figs. I omitted the brown sugar-- They were plenty sweet without it. I also added 1/2 tsp of almond extract.They came out moist and chewy and everyone who has tasted enjoyed. I will definately make again...Anxious  to try other nut and fruit combos.

As many others did, I used what I had on hand for the flavour, increased the amount of oats and had to omit the Grape Nuts since they are impossible to find in my area. I used dried cranberries, chocolate chips, and slivered almonds as well, and increased the applesauce by a bit to make a chewier bar. I also doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan- and these made 16 standard-sized bars. The flavour? I don't see kids loving them, since they aren't as sweet as boxed granola bars. Might be a bit bland to some. To us, it reminds us just how much sugar the boxed kind must contain, and it makes us shudder! Great as breakfast-on-the-go. Will make again! Thanks for the recipe.

Thank you for this recipe...I have made this a few times with different mixes of dried fruit, and enjoyed each combination.  The only thing I do differently is I smash the batch into a 9x13 brownie pan to make them a little thinner.  I get more servings at a lower calorie count this way.  Thanks again!

Really delicious. High in calories, but great for a camping power breakfast.  Carried me through a long bike ride! I really like the tart flavor of cranberries instead of dates.

These were OK.  I was looking for a decent oatmeal or cereal bar to eat for breakfast.  I like "Granola Bars III" much better.

Delicious! Perfect for toddlers, and snacks on the go. Substituted half of the flour with protein powder, eliminated the brown sugar, added flax seeds, almond slivers raisins and cranberries. Will try adding a bit of peanut butter next time!

It was very filling.  I dont think we were crazy about the taste or texture. It was soft and messy.  I wish it held it's shape better more like a bar.  Not sure if i will make it again.

I followed another review and increased the applesauce to 3/4 cup and used dried cherries for the fruit, almonds for the nuts, egg beaters for the egg and did not add the sunflower seeds.  I can see where you have a lot of room for playing around with ingredients and the result will probably always turn out great.

My 11 y.o. son who doesn't like oatmeal loved these and it's good to know that I can have a healthy treat for him that's easy to make!

This is a great recipe!  I used protein powder instead of flour, and also added flaked coconut, peanut butter, chocolate chips, and craisins (instead of the dried fruit).  They turned out delicious!  There are lots of things you can do with this recipe.  I will definately be making these again!

These are good!  The kids watched me make them last night and were quite intrigued.  I made them with Craisins and whole almonds, then dropped in a few chocolate chips and a few M&M's just for color.  You should have seen the kids inhale these things this morning!  They REALLY thought they were getting by with something having such a "treat" in the morning!  They have proclaimed them "THE BEST BREAKFAST EVER!!" and decided I should be a famous chef.  :)  Thanks for the recipe!

Okay, not great.  I like that they are healthy and filling.  However, I think next time I will use some choc chips instead of the dried fruit -- that's what my sweet tooth was really craving!

The power bars served their purpose for a camping trip but I didn't really enjoy them.  Seemed a little tough and not very tasty.  Sorry.

They don't have much flavor.  I'm going to try again and use vanilla, cinnamon mix and different fruit.  They are very chewy.  I'm going to take them to CURVES and let the ladies judge.

I have been making a double batch version of these bars each week for a couple of months now. They have become our daily "go to" bar for breakfast and snacks. They are even "healthy eating husband approved"! :) I did take suggestions from some of the other reviewers and substituted a few items to meet our tastes. I use 2 scoops chocolate organic protein in place of the flour, molasses for the honey, coconut oil for the vege oil, lightly salted roasted almonds for the nuts, dried blueberries and cherries for the fruit. I also add 1/3 cup chunky organic peanut butter, 1/3 cup organic toasted coconut, 1/3 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1 tsp. cloves, 1 tsp. vanilla and leave out the brown sugar. I bake them for 25 minutes, let them cool completely and then refrigerate overnight. The following morning I lift the foil out of the pan as instructed and cut into bite-size bars. I put 4 - 5 bars (depending on how big I have cut them) into a plastic sandwich baggies and put them back in the refrigerator. We just grab a bag in the morning and go. These bars taste great and have become a staple item in our house! Thanks for sharing such a versatile recipe for power bars!

This is a great recipe. Reduced the amount of honey to 1 tbsp, almond butter instead of oil, almond flour and coconut flour instead of flour and cereal. My version became dairy free and gluten free

More like 4 1/2 stars. I made a double batch in a 9x12 pan, used regular white flour (since that was what I had), added extra applesauce and omitted the oil, and used sliced almonds instead of sunflower seeds and walnuts. I cut them into bars and then wrapped individually in foil. I keep them in the fridge for long term storage, but they keep fine in my bag for a day. May try the chocolate protein powder suggested by another reviewer next time. My kids and workout partner liked them too.

I hate to say it, but these were not good at all.  They were extremely dense and tasted like soggy/stale Grape Nuts.  I made them exactly as the recipe reads so I'm not really sure what went wrong.

I have gotten in the habit of eating one granola bar each day...but the calories, relative lack of nutrition, inclusion of corn syrup etc. bothered me.  I've started making this recipe every two weeks, cutting it into ten bars and putting them in a zip-lock bag in the freezer.  I take out one bar each weekday and I'm becoming addicted!  I use whatever cereal we have in the house, have used maple syrup, honey- whatever as sweetener (even reduced it a bit) and have tried, craisins, dried apricots, dried blueberries...for the fruit.  Often don't have applesauce so quickly cook down an apple!  I use white whole wheat flour.  They are SO good, so easy and so nutritious!
        Years later: (March 2018):  If there was a prize for the person who had made any one recipe more times than any other, I would win for the number of times I have made this.  I still think it is SUCH a solid start for a nutritious and delicious power bar.  I've been making it every two weeks for years now!  Sometimes I throw in flax seed, sometimes I use maple syrup, sometimes I double the cinnamon, often I make my own applesauce- it is never the same twice. Oh! I also now make these gluten free by grinding my own oat flour and always using a rice or corn cereal.

So easy and so tasty! I will never buy regular granola bars again. Like the other reviewers have said, it's a perfect 'Base' recipe that you can change up according to your tastes. I ground flax seed up to replace the flour and omitted the oil and just used more applesauce. I used 'Egg Beaters' egg product instead of a real egg. I used dried apples, craisins, and raisins along with walnuts (no sunflower seed). I'm diabetic and this is a perfect 'Power food' for me (I substituted some of the honey with Splenda) for before my workouts. They give me energy and keep my blood sugar at a nice even level for hours! Dark chocolate chips are also a nice addition but when I do add them, I keep it to just a handful because the flavor of these bars is so good, too much chocolate overpowers all the other flavors. I love this recipe! Thank you!

I've made these twice.  They've turned out great both times.  I've used the recipe as shown except for adding 1/2 cup milled flaxseed and doubling the recipe so that each of the three members of my family will have a snack daily for a week.  Am excited about trying different fruits, nuts and chips .  Someone mentioned peanut butter, which I think is a fabulous idea.  I'll try that next time.   My whole family loves them.

Excellent! I've made these a several times and the whole family loves them. I made the first time I made exactly as called for and the second I used peanut butter. I doubled the batch the 3rd time and put 2 TBSP of dark choc chips. I preferred the pecans over the walnuts. I also used dried cherries, blueberries, craisins and raisins. Excellent and filling!

EXCELLENT!! These are a great mid-morning or afternoon snack.  We are changing our lifestyle to live a more healthy life.  We've gone from eating 2-3 big, unhealthy meals to eating 5-6 small, healthy meals/snacks.  It's a fabulous way to get in a small 'meal'.  It satifies the sweet tooth while giving energy and fiber.  I used dried cranberries, mango, pineapple, papaya, & apricots in one batch.  I added coconut to another. YUM!! Highly recommended.  Thanks!!!!

LOVED this recipe!!!  These are sooo much better than anything you buy at the store.  I will definitely make again and will experiment - the possibilities are endless.  I omitted the honey and upped the applesauce to compensate, but otherwise followed the exact recipe.

I made these power bars for my kindergartener to eat for breakfast, as they are portable and can be made very healthy. I made them with dried cherries, and added some vanilla paste to them. Next time I will add some flax seed and maybe get rid of the brown sugar. I really think the honey would be enough- I love these bars, and will be making them again really soon!

These power bars r similar to the ones I make at home, But I use some peanut butter and fresh shredded apple instead of apple sauce. That really gives it a nice taste & fragrance. If people want 2 follow this recipe it is a perfect 5* and those on a diet or health concious should deff go 4 it wit out a 2nd thought.Thanks.

Soo much better than store bought, really worth the small amount of time to make, and very adaptable to what you have on hand.

I love these!  Say goodbye to store bought bars!  You can make these with so many variations.  Use a variety of dried fruits, nuts and even chocolate chips and coconut flakes.  I used Briar Rabbits's Molasses Honey for another tweek.  Yum!

These bars are very tasty -- and there is no comparison to anything you buy in a store for power bars.  

I tend to add a lot more nuts and additional vanilla flavored protein powder mix plus a bit more cinnamon to the recipe and it turns out very well.

I had a hard time getting mine to stick together and cutting them into bars, but it didn't matter, because they were gobbled up immediately. Next time I will use less flour and try adding different seeds.

Wonderful flavor! I had to use a slightly different cereal, as well as just raisins instead of mixed dried fruit. The honey adds the perfect type of sweetness to such a healthy snack. This recipe is easy to play with, I will definately be using it again!

Thank You soooo much for shareing this recipe. Just what I've been looking for. I was wanting to make a trek like bar from Great Harvest, and this is close enough for me. I love that I can mix up the ingredients to what I feel like. I of course made my own twist of the origional recipe. Thank you again! I love it!

I followed the recipe almost verbatum the 1st time I made them and they were dry and bland.  I was pretty disappointed.  I used walnuts, pecans, raisins and dried pomegranates.  Even took them to work and they didn't go fast.  Guess I will try the protein powder, flax, peanut butter and more applesauce next time.

Yummy, not too sweet and perfectly filling. Just what I expected and wanted for a breakfast bar. The only change I made was only being able to add approx half the honey (we ran out). But it came out wonderful. Thank you.

I like all the reviewers LOVE this recipe. I really like that fact that you can make it your own and cut calories down and it still is fabulous. I used applesauce in place of oil, I TBSP Splenda brown sugar, crasins, and chopped almonds. These are plenty good. I can't wait to add banana's and peanut butter and see what I get. Thanx for such a great recipe this will be the "famous" power bar recipe my 20 month old daughter one day will call me from university asking for:)

I made these in my 12 square baking tin so I didn't have to cut them later.  These are nuttier and less sweet than the Playgroup Granola Bars (which are still my husband's favorite).

YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY!  What a wonderful, nutritious, and versatile recipe!!  Used raison bran instead of grapenuts, protien powder in place of flour, and doubled up on the walnuts and omitted the sunflowers.  I used what I had on hand.  I will be making these many more times!!  Thanks for sharing!

these bars are incredible! i don't like to buy granola or power bars for my fiance, because they cost a lot for not a lot of fill. i tried these, and he loves them so much! i can see how i will be able to play with the recipe for variations.  this time, i used cherry flavored crasins (they have less sugar added than regular crasins, actually), raw sunflower seeds. i also threw in some white chocolate chips to make it more fun. when i pulled them out of the oven, i added more white chocolate chips on top and let them soften, then i spread them around. YUM!!! i will DEFINITELY be making these at least once a week! they are definitely yummy!

A wonderful snack when you just don't know what else to eat. Stays together wonderfully on the go -- mine suffer through a day's worth of cross-campus walking in my backpack.   If you want something that tastes more like dessert or an Odwalla bar, add 1/2 cup chocolate chips and food process all the dry ingredients and fruit before mixing. If you're on a budget, raisins lend themselves very well to this variation, though I think most fruits would be just fine.

This is a great base recipe. I have tried many fruit and nut combinations. And they all work. I always double the recipe and use a 9x13 pan for a thicker bar. My husband's and son's favorite is strawberry & cream cheese. Add 8 oz. cream cheese (for a double recipe)and I use dehydrated strawberries after re hydrating them. For the whole wheat flour, I use half whole wheat flour and half protein protein powder, cut the sugar in half. Goes great with walnuts and I skip the sunflower seeds.

Very filling granola bars and very versatile too. Much more frugal than buying store brand and feels good knowing exactly what went into them! I always use mashed bananas and cut down on butter/oils. It's important to keep them in air-tight container so they stay fresh longer.

Really good - i had problems with mine being too crumbly, but even as a granola style snack, it is really good and filling. I was a little speculative about the grape nuts, but the recipe was just great!

I added poppy seeds, diced frozen strawberries, wheat germ, flax seed & reduced the amount of sunflower seeds. Used whole rolled oats. Made a mistake by putting this in a 9x13 pan not a SQUARE one so mine turned out very thin & not like "power bars" but tasted good.

These are great grab-and-go breakfast bars as well as perfect for a quick "snack" on the way to the gym.  I add coconut flakes to them as well, and have subbed ripe bananas for some of the applesauce with good results.  Thanks!

These were pretty good.  I added 2 T peanut butter and probably 2 T of extra apple sauce, the extra apple sauce probably wasn't needed.  Instead of wheat flour I used chocolate protein powder and milled flax seed.  Although these were healthy and pretty good they were not well received by my family.  They love the Gobble Up Granola Snacks on this site and were a little disappointed with these. But I'll have no problem eating them all.  If I ever do make these again I think I would try replacing the applesauce with pumpkin butter just for fun.

These are the best granola bars ever!  I'm not sure if they dry out over time because they never seem to last long enough.  I have yet to follow the recipe exactly, but that seems to be okay.  I've substituted rice crispies for the Grape Nuts, and 10 grain cereal (the kind that makes hot cereal), and I used dried cranberries and strawberries, and a handfull of chocolate chips.

I thought this was a great recipe. There are so many things you can do with them. I used chopped roasted almonds instead of the walnuts and fruit was an organic dried fruit mix. Next time I think I'll add some tart dried cherries. Really is awesome and filling too. It makes a good breakfast bar.

This is an awesome basic recipe!  I used pureed mango in place of the applesauce and craisins for the dried fruit.  Will try again with dried cherries, without nuts, and corn syrup in place of honey so I can feed it to my toddler.

I really like these.  Not bland but not excessively sweet.  I didn't have enough honey so I used maple syrup for almost half the 1/4 cup and they turned out fine.  I also had a left over partial bag of dried fruit along with the 7 oz bag called for that I tossed in anyway to use it up.

These are very good! I used craisins as my dried fruit. They could use a little more flavor. Next time I might try putting some coconut or peanuts in the recipe.

I made these just like the recipe calls for and we loved them! I cut them into 12 bars and put them in plastics bags and stored them in the refrigerator and we each had one for breakfast for a week! I will be making these again soon! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

These are so nice and easy! I did make a couple adjustments because I didn't have enough dried fruit I through in some dark chocolate chips. I also didn't use any oil or brown sugar but added more applesauce and a banana. Definitely will be making these again. They just seem so much healthier for you than anything in the grocery store.

Very simple and very tasty.  I have made these a few times my husband loves them and I use all kinds of different fruits.  They don't last longer than 2 days before I am making more.  Great to have for snacks in the house.  A keeper!!

These are amazing! I changed up the recipe using pecan nuts instead of walnuts, using only 1 1/2 Tbsp of brown sugar (will leave it out completely next time) and adding 1 cup of chocolate Shakeology and 1/3 cup of unsweetened applesauce. Mixed up berries according to my own taste by using dried cranberries, dried red raisins and dried white raisins. Might actually try these with peanutbutter next time :)! Love it - they are a constant item in my fridge!

Great bar.  I made some changes, I did not have the cereal so I put extra oats.  I did not use the oil but replaced it with almond butter,I left the nuts out only because I did not have any but will add next time.  I used dried tart cherries and apricots as apricots  go well with any other fruit. I put half whole wheat flour and half whey protein powder.  Threw in a handful of mini choc chips, baked for 23 min and they are delicious. I really don't think you can ruin this recipe, just put in what you like.

I definitely look some liberties with this recipe but It gave me a great place to start from! I didn't have and grape-nuts so I used Kashi Cereal instead. I also switched out the sunflower seeds for more walnuts and added a few tablespoons of wheat germ (trying to up the protein) overall these were great! Sort of reminded me of a Clif Bar. I also used a tablespoon less brown sugar and they were perfectly sweet. I'm looking forward to trying new modifications to the recipe! Thank's for a great base!

This was a decent recipe.  Endless possibilities on combonations.  But it wasnt a huge hit with the family.  We all enjoyed it when I first made it.  But nobody ever asked for more and there was one left that sat for about 3 weeks.  So obviously not a memorable recipe, but it was very easy to make and had a decent flavor.

Delicious!! I make a double batch, cut into 24 squares, freeze, and take out of the freezer when I want to eat.  They are always moist and filling.  I used dried cranberries, cherries, and raisins, almonds instead of walnuts, and I added some flax seed.  Next time I will substitute either another egg or more applesauce for the oil.  I will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

Awesome! After reading the other reviews, I can't wait to try all kinds of variations like coconut, protein powder, and more! This will be a new staple in my house. I pushed them down with a spatula before putting them in the oven, and again when they came out.

These turned out AMAZING!!! I altered it just a bit... used 3/4 cup of applesauce like another user suggested & omitted the oil. I also only used raisins, about 6oz. Baked them in muffin tins for about 15 minutes, they came out super moist, like a dense little muffin. I've only had one, because my husband and son devoured the rest :P I will definitely be keeping this recipe, since my family is already bugging me about the next time I'll make them!! I think this is going to become a weekly thing in our house, thank you so much (:

Very delicious, healthier than other granola bars and don't fall apart as easily. Made them with all purpose gluten-free flour and brown rice crispie cereal to make a gluten-free recipe. Used a wee less sugar because added peanut M&Ms and crasins to them. Delicious and a great cross country skiing snack :) Also I ended up making a second batch for my brother and his friends for their road trip! Everyone agrees they are yummy so thank you for sharing :)

Loved them! So easy to play around with the ingredients and very filling.  I put finely chopped dried apricots in my last batch which added just the right amount of sweetness.  I am about to make a triple batch right now and make some gluten free for a friend (grinding up oats to make an oat flour instead of using wheat flour).

Amazing bars....I made a few changes  such as adding a full tsp of cinnamon, omitting the applesauce and subbing with 1/4 natural crunchy peanut butter, adding 1/4 wheat germ, reducing the oil to 1 tblspn, adding chopped pistachios instead of walnuts and just using dried cranberries instead of the mixed fruit. I loved that this recipe incorportated the oats, ww flour and the Grape-Nuts cereal....which I had! A very tasty and healthy power bar!! Thanks!

They might have been good, but by the time I got up from my nap to eat the fruits of my labor, they were already gone. I added some semisweet chocolate chips and dried cranberries (a favorite combination of mine) and they lasted all of 30 minutes. The husband and kiddos had sucked them down like they were the antidote.

Delicious!  I made these over the weekend and I used dried cherries and it made them taste so good.  The great thing about these is you can make them different each time by adding different ingredients.  I will be making these every week now:)

Great!! I used only 2 T of honey and 2 T of brown sugar to cut down on the sweetness, and like others, subbed in 1/2 c applesauce and omitted the oil. Added extra cinnamon, plus a sprinkle of ginger and cloves. A "berry/cherry" bag of dried fruit and almond slivers finished them off. I can't wait to make these again!

In. Credible. I used mixed fruit and walnuts. They are sooooo moist and chewy! Much better than any store-bought granola bar I've had. I actually feel healthier when I eat them. They make a great snack for school/work!

very good, I like that it's not super sweet. I didn't have sunflower seeds so I used flax seeds, and I've been on this peacan kick, so I used that instead of walnuts. when I first tryed it warm, I didn't love it, but I stored it in the fridge and Loved it cold!! thank you for a yummy healthy breakfast treat!

Dried blueberries don't taste very good in this, but it's all I had on hand.  Cranberries would probably be delish.

I brought these in to my lecture on a monday morning and suddenly everyone was acting like it was a friday! These are so delicious and really give you the extra boost you need! I doubled the amount of nuts just because im a fan of a bit more crunch. LOVE THESE!

My kids love these. These bars make an easy (my kids actually make them) wholesome inexpensive snack for taking to school . Since my daughter cant have nuts in her food at school due to classmate allergies we substitute roasted unsalted soybeans for the walnuts which gives a great crunch and some added protein.

LOVE this recipe.  I make it friendly for the whole family with some changes.  I used chocolate protein powder instead of the wheat flour, used extra applesauce and cut out oil.  Used chocolate chips instead of nuts and cut out the brown sugar because it was sweet enough with the chocolate.  I think I will try the idea of adding peanut butter next time. Great recipe to change flavors each time!

I love these bars. I exchanged the flour for banana protein powder, walnuts and sunflower seeds for hazelnuts and used dried cherries and berries. They're wonderful and the recipe is so easy to change up.

Flavor is good a good balance... not overly sweet but sweet enough. The finished texture was looser than I had anticipated, making eating the bars on the run a bit more "crumb-y" than ideal.

What a great recipe! I add different dried fruits and cereals each time - it's great because the combo is so versatile! I always bake the bars in an 8x8 pan, and they end up a tad thicker but still very good.

Very good recipe; used all walnuts and all raisins for the nut/fruit and my bars tasted like a healthy oatmeal cookie!  Will make again and tweak with different nut/fruit combos and add more cinnamon next time. Thanks for the recipe!

Will try this one again... I left in the oven for 7 extra minutes because the top was still soft at the time they were supposed to be ready-- and I took a little taste and it tasted raw.  But 7 minutes was too long-- they were no longer chewy enough.

My wife and I tried this recipe and loved it! We especially like ours with dates for our fruit. One change we did make though was to use Walnut Oil instead of the cooking oil called for in the recipe. The flavor came out tasting much more natural this way. Thank you Jo-Anne for sharing this recipe!

My family loved this recipe but it wasn't quite what I was thinking. I was looking for more of a bar and this was more of a caker. BUt, it makes great power cake and i'm sure i'll make it again as you can substitute for a dessert and still be somewhat healthy. Thanks!

This recipe is great. I used almonds instead of walnuts and used 1/2 cup apple sauce instead of oil. We buy the no added sugar apple sauce kid cups for the kids, so that worked great. It might have been too much apple sauce, but my bars came out chewy and kind of crispy on top. I also dont buy instant oatmeal so I used rolled oats.  Im going try all kinds of ways to make these.  Ty for the recipe. Very filling.

Good bars, especially for being healthy.  For fruit, I used chopped prunes and apples (not dried) along with dried cherry flavored cranberries.  Mine turned out very moist, chewy, and mmm... good.

I love this recipe especially since it's so versatile.  You can use whatever you have on hand for the dried fruit and the nuts.  Next time I might try adding dark chocolate chips.  Just a note to all reviewers living in Canada, you can find grapenuts at Costco.  I have also tried them using bran cereal and it worked out fine.

I did not think these would be as good or as popular as they were. We were liberal with changes--no sunflower seeds, but used dried cranberries, dried strawberries, coconut, regular oats, and substituted strawberry nectar for the applesauce. But still, the kids & I both loved them. They were filling, and sweet enough for kids but not too sweet. Great texture. Easy to make.

I made oatmeal cookies for a neighbor with crisco, sugar, the whole nine yards and then I made these. I ate both and these were so much tastier! Really moist, I ommited the sugar all together and they were still plenty sweet! I wll be making them again today with soynuts, walnuts, dried cranberrys and organic peanut butter. It is a great base recipe and makes a super healthy snack for my hungry kids to eat after school. I am so glad I found this!

This was okay. The flavor was nice, the texture was not chewy at all though, and mine did not look like the ones in the picture. It just did not ressemble a granola bar at all. I can't understand what I did wrong that everybody said theirs came out chewy...

Loved this recipe. Changed a bit. Used organic cherry-apple butter in place of apple sauce. Also added organic dried cherries and toasted almonds. Just for an added sweet treat I also added semi sweet choco chips. Makes them very appealing to the kids! They came out delicious!! Other variation was mashed banana in place of apple sauce, dried banana chips and walnuts. Also came out great. It's such a great recipe because it's so flexible!!

I've made these three times now with different variations. I recommend taking out the sugar; you won't need it. I replaced vegetable oil with canola oil. The first two times I omitted the oil and added extra applesauce or peanut butter, they were still dryer than I like.  Replace the flour with protein powder. These are absolutely delicious.

Oh my gosh! These are AMAZING! they are better than ANY protein/fiber bar you buy at the store!! You can totally customize this recipe for different pallets too. I added more cinnamon and substituted walnuts for almonds. I also forgot to mix the brown sugar in, so I crumbed in on top and holy COW is it good!

My kids are competitive swimmers and we spend hundreds of $$ on protein and energy bars annually.  I decided to try this recipe to save some money.   I changed the ingredients a little, at others' suggestions.  I used chocolate protein powder instead of flour, left out the sugar, added peanut butter, molasses, smashed banana, cranberries, and chocolate chips.  My kids love it!  Just the two of them ate almost the whole pan in a sitting  before practice.  I just made it again and doubled it in time for the weekend.  Also they'll be perfect for taking to practice and swim meets for energy between events.  I like this recipe because it's flexible and I'll be able to trade ingredients for different tastes.

Love these bars- have made them several times. I am trying Ayurveda and I have a pitta constitution. I am going to try to make these with maple syrup vs honey and pumpkin seeds vs walnuts. My dried fruit will be cherries.

This was great! I always hated buying granola bars because they aren't really good for you. These TASTE good for you. I doubled the recipe and put it in a 7x11 pan for thick bars. Also, I exchanged the applesauce for 2 mashed bananas (my applesauce was no good) I think it was perfect and even better because I didn't have the added sugar that comes with store bought applesauce. I'm going to keep making them with bananas, the flavor was fantastic and they are very firmly held together. So glad I found this recipe before the summer started (four boys)! Thanks!

These taste delicious and I followed the recipe exactly. I used dried cranberries for the fruit. The only problem I had was that some of the bars crumbled apart. I guess I could use the crumbles in yogurt or something but maybe next time I'll add more honey to make them stick together better.

A bit sticky, but good.  Tasted fine with unsweetened applesauce and pecans (instead of walnuts). Need to bake a little longer - maybe 35 minutes.

I think next time I will try a bar with peanut butter. These were very good, I used a bit of pumpkin pie filling with the applesauce, and then cranberries and pecans for Fall. They are filling and great for breakfast or after a work out!!

Very packed full of energy, so I cut these into squares instead of bars.  I just thought it was a bit much for me!  Tastes good.  I left out the nuts bc I didn't want to chop any and used a dried fruit mixture of apricots, apples, and peaches.  Only thing I changed was to use white flour--I'm out of whole wheat.  Very nice, very easy, and yes, they are chewy and soft.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe looked promising, but I wasn't real excited about it. It was slightly soft yet completely dry. To top, it had some honey and a little brown sugar, but tasted like it had near no sweetener. The only change I made was cutting the dried fruit in half. I do that in most recipes with no problem. 1/2 came out to be 3/4 of a cup. I found it to be more than enough. I really hate wasting food so I got an idea from a friend to eat one as cereal. I crumbled it in a bowl with milk and topped with a sprinkle of Truvia. It solved the dryness and the lack of sweetness. Hopefully, none will go to waste now.

Loved these,  Made some subs,  coconut oil,  protein powder,  coconut palm sugar.  Flax seeds.  They were a little sweet for me with so next time might cut down on the honey and dried fruit,  but will make them again.  Mine worked out to 12 squares at 150 calories a piece.

These are awsome. I doubled the recipe for extra thick bars. I made a couple minor changes like pumpkin seeds instead of sunflower seeds and also added flax seed and almonds. For the dried fruit I used blueberries and orange flavoured cranberries (Bulk Barn, Canada). My husband liked them so much he took some on his moose hunting trip.

LOVE!!!  I did the same as other users...omit the flour and added chocolate whey protein powder, upped the applesauce, and ditched the brown sugar (due to the protein powder being sweet enough). I used dates and the blueberry infused crasins, THEY ARE HEAVEN in a bar!!  My girlfriend and I had been looking for a nice healthy snack for after our daily workouts and this is it!  Super easy to make and great for a quick pick me up!!

I love this recipe!  Very filling!  I made a few changes--I omit the brown sugar and use butter instead of vegetable oil--both for the mixture and for coating the aluminum foil.  I use about 3/4 cup of chocolate chips, seeds and dried fruit.  I'll try to cut back on the fruit in the future to save on calories.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

These were delicious! It needs a slightly better bonding agent. Some of the raisins fell out.

these are amazing! I used half amount oil and doubled the applesauce. Used crushed up Special K instead of grape nut because thats what I had on hand. Added Craisins, dried apricots and alpiste seeds. Will make again often and perhaps cut down on sugar next time because they are plenty sweet.

this was a really good snack.  Easy to make and I loved the texture.  I made no changes.  I am on a diet and the sugar and fiber levels in this recipe are great.  I will always keep these on hand.

Delish! I used almonds, dried cranberries, and chocolate chips. Also I used agave nectar instead of honey to make this a bit healthier. I plan on making this again and again and again!

I make these Power Bars very often for my dad, and he loves them! They're a tasty alternative to store-bought so-called "healthy" granola bars. These bars can be customized, too. Whatever's in your pantry, or if you prefer healthy or sweet, it's the ultimate recipe for a picky eater!

I'm not really a "healthy" person, but these were pretty good.  I added dried berries and a good sized amount of chocolate chips.  They will be good for breakfast- not too sweet- but sweet enough to eat and be satisfied.

This is wonderful and very satisfying granola.  It's fun to mix up different dried fruits and nuts to make a custom granola bar. I used dates, crazines, pecans and walnuts. These were items I had left over from other recipes.

These were pretty good - I substituted Raisin Bran (no Grapenuts) and as I'm reviewing it, it occurred to me that I didn't put in the vegetable oil - but they were still good.  Not the best, but that could be my changes...I'll try them again.

DRY... very dry. I even added extra applesauce, and it was still too dry. The flavor wasn't bad, just don't do what I did and only put 1/2 of the fruit in. I put 4 oz of dates in, it definitely needs the 7 oz! I omitted the nuts (on accident)... I will try again with a couple of tweaks.

These power bars taste great! I followed the recipe, plus I added cranberries, raisans and dried apples to the mix.  The bars came out moist and tasty, and have lasted a long time in the fridge per the recomendation. They are great for breakfast on the go. I will def make these again in the near future.

These are amazing! FYI I added a generous tablespoon of LSA mix, handful of hazelnuts and some diabetic sugar in compensation of brown. I also just used a LowGI "clumped" muesli with dried blueberries. 
I will look harder when shopping next time for some wheat and barley. But thank you!

Yum,yum,yum. So tasty. Good for you and fills you up so a perfect snack. Super easy to make. I've made them twice now. I changed the nuts to what I had - almond slivers and pecans.  Omitted the sunflower seeds b/c I didn't have any.  And used dried cherries and CHOCOLATE chunks!

DOUBLE THE RECIPE! I followed it as is and it only filled half of my 9" square - unless they are supposed to be REALLY thin.  Also a little on the bland side. I'll put more dried fruit in next time.

A good, filling snack to take to work/school... The flavor is very "healthy," which can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on my mood.

I thought these were a little bland, but I am going to keep trying the recipe using different ingrediants.

Very good!  My husband wanted a healthy breakfast bar and this is perfect.  I'd like to figure out a way to boost the fiber though.  Anyway, they're so good I think I'll be making them on a weekly basis!

My boys (3 & 6 yrs old) ate this OK, but it is far from their favorite.  At a glance, the ingredients suggest a healthy breakfast / snack bar - but it is lacking in something.

Its nice to find a homemade granola bar recipe that actually sticks together. The ones I have tried are pretty crumbly.  Very tasty.

This is an awesome recipe!  My husband loves these!  I used peanuts for the nuts since my husband doesn't like many other kinds.  I haven't tried it with the sunflower seeds.  I like this recipe because you can use whatever fruit/nuts you like!

This is a very good recipe.  I change some ingredients.  I use craisins orange flavored instead the dried fruit, and orange zest, no sunflower seeds.  It is a cranberry orange bar.  Excellent and it packs well.
