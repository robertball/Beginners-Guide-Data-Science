Like this green juice quite a bit, however the lemon was a bit sour, and I added a cup of grapes to sweeten it.  Next time I will reduce the lemon.

Delicious! I am on a 30-Day juice cleanse and this definitely helped break up the monotony of Green Juices. Only change I made was adding HALF a head of romaine instead of the whole head. I found the lemon to be slightly tart, as lemons are, but I enjoy that flavor. I plan on drinking this regularly now. Thanks so much!

I had to tweak it by adding some raw honey to the mix.  Now it tastes good.

This looks like nothing that you would REALLY want to drink ... but it's AMAZING.  It tastes GREAT!  Don't change a thing!

We've been doing the Mean Green juice as a supplement to our regular lean meals.  This is great way to change it up.  I never thought of using romaine.  Thanks!

I loved it. I used two mangos instead of apples and it turned out so yummy. I used a whole small lemon and couldn't taste it that much so if you want more add more.  I also used half the lettuce, it was big.

We've been making green lemonade for years, with these ingredients as a base, then augmenting either based on what's available, or what we're feeling at the time. Fuji apples are the sweetest, and arguably best suited for this type of drink. Pro-tips: use this as a framework not a hardline recipe; adjust Fuji apple amount to achieve desired sweetness, substitute lemons when limes aren't available, celery and cucumber are great for improving the taste, add carrots & or beets for additional sweetness.
