Great recipe. Easy recipe but not enough batter for regular size cake. Perfect for 4 mini Bundt cakes and that's what I originally planned to make. You can leave without frosting, frost with homemade Banana or Lemon frosting or dust with confectioner sugar. End result is mmmmm GOOD.

yes I made today and it looks yummy. I used pure cane sugar instead of the sugar it called for and it turned out good.

Tasty batter, but definitely not enough mix for a bundt cake. I got 6 small muffins.

Made in a bundt dish the cook time was spot on in my convection oven. The bread cooked nicely - moist, soft, and just perfect. 

I didn't have turbinado sugar so used loosely packed light brown sugar. Sweetness was just right. I also added a bit of almond extract to the wet ingredients, and made a glaze (powdered sugar, heavy cream, milk, and a bit more almond extract) to put over top once cooled. The bread is already half gone after only being set out ready to eat in the last hour :) 

I made it in a bundt dish and it only fills less than half of it, as warned by other reviewers. The cake is not full size (measures 1 1/2" thick), so if you are making this for more than 4-5 people you may want to make 2.

I followed the recipe except the cooking time was much longer for it to set up in the middle. 50 minutes but it is super yummy!

I joined this site so that I could review this recipe. I have found my banana bread recipe. My whole family loved it! Makes a short, very cute bundt cake. Cuts up into very cute tiny slices. We prefer that because we don't eat large dessert portions.

I made some changes. I added 1/4 cup SOUR cream to make up the bananas i didnt have. I also added 1/8 cup cream and used splenda brown sugar instead. This is a very moist cake and baked beautifully. I also doubled the recipe. Thank you from a diabetic with a sweet tooth.

Read the reviews first. Knew it was going to be small.  Looked after it was baked like it was going to be dense for it was to me short as well. Yet it was not, very moist. Made another one with a little vanilla and chopped walnuts. Boyfriend said it was really good, moist and great texture.  Not too sweet as well.

Not enough ingredients for a Bundt pan, even when doubled!  Not enough shortening to keep it moist.

I finally found a banana cake/bread/muffin recipe with a high fresh banana to low sugar ratio.  For this reason the result is intense banana flavor with a moist texture and a superior nutrition profile.

I added a peanut butter maple glaze that really added to the flavor.

I needed a stiff banana bread recipe to use in a Nordic RR Train bundt pan, which makes little loaves that are train cars with a lot of detail. This recipe worked really well. No sticking in the pan, which I sprayed with cooking spray first, and the details in cars was good. It made enough for 6 of the 8 cars, or six little loaves. I baked it for about 30 minutes.

I followed this recipes direction except I added extra banana which helps make it moist. Then I topped it off with a cream cheese frosting. So delicious!

This was really good. Lighter than banana bread but it didn't make nearly as much as I expected. I doubled the recipe and it still only made one, short bundt cake.
