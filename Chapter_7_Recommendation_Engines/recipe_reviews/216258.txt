I really enjoyed this recipe and used white rice instead of brown.  Couldn't get my 3 y.o. to eat the cranberries but he like the rice!  Will have it again!

Def. for a cranberry lover. I used white rice and sunflower seeds as substitutes. I enjoyed the dried warmed cranberries. Great alternative dish.

This was a hit.  I did think it was a bit sweet.  I put some hot pepper flakes in it.  I also cooked the cranberries with the rice.  Next time, I will skip the cranberry sauce, and just go with the cranberries.

Skipped the sauce and just cooked the dried cranberries with the rice. Came out a little less sweet and super delicious!
