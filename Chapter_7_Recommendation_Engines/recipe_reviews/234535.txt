Like so many of Chef John's creations, this is terrific. I followed the instructions exactly and it worked very well.

This breakfast pizza turned out excellent. Although I ended up with about a 16" crust. Had it been the 12" crust as given in the recipe, it would have been perfect. I think if I had the large pizza dough again, I would add another egg or two. But the flavor was spot on and it is a keeper in my recipe box.

Great recipe . Prosciutto would also be good.
