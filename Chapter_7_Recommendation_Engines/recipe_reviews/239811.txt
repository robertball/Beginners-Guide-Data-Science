This recipe was great I followed the directions minus one lemon, because I only had 2 lol. I'll definately make again though next time I'm going to only use half the brown sugar and honey since I am calorie conscious.

Really good recipe for the basis of ginger tea. I did lower the amount of brown sugar to 1/4 cup for 4 cups water (which is only about 3 servings btw). I also only used half a lemon. Came out wonderful!!

I will most likely make it again.  I did not use any brown sugar, which probably would have cut down on the string lemon taste. I had to add a ton of water and more honey. Next time I will definitely use one lemon though.

What a warming tea!  I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of 3/4 and it was still too sweet for me.  So sweet I didn't get to put the honey in it.  Next time, WAY less brown sugar.  Maybe none and just put in honey at the end.  I will make it again and try to tweak it around to suit me.
