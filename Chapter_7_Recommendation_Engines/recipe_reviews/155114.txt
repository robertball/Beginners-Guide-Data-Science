I loved these, although I suspect the brown sugar is what made them difficult for others, therefore I only used white sugar. I rolled the dough in between wax paper, layed them on a cutting board and stuck in the fridg. for 10 min. before putting the 2 doughs together and rolling. Then I froze the roll for an additional hour before cutting into slices, and baking. They turned out fabulous!

These were pretty good and my kids really loved them.  My only issue was that the recipe tells you to roll the dough out and place one color on top of the other after adding the food coloring, but there was no way that was going to happen, the dough was far too sticky.  I had to refridgerate the dough overnight and then roll them out and put them together.  Then I had to return them to the refridgerator again overnight to get a clean slice and nice looking cookie.  This whole process was slightly time consuming, but otherwise they tasted good.

This is my recipe, yes, it is a time-consuming one, but well worth it. I split it over 2 days, make the dough one day and bake the next. As for the other baker's difficulty in the stickiness of the dough, I have never had that problem.  Add more flour to the dough if it sticks as it should roll out like a dense pie dough. Also, AR said to add one drop of food colouring (not what I had submitted), you need half a bottle to get the desired shades of vibrant green and red!

I made this cookie for a cookie ex-change,  so I made 4 batches across three days and tweaked it a little each time.  Findings:  1st batch, I made it exactly as called for in the recipe.   I tried to make red and white.  Dough was sticky and because of the brown sugar the white was actually tan. 2nd batch – I ditched the brown sugar for white, used only egg whites.  White was white this time, Green looked brighter as well.   I couldn’t tell when the cookies were actually done before they turned brown on the edges and then it was too late.  They didn’t look as pretty with brown edges. Batches 3 & 4 -   1.	No brown sugar – use white 2.	No egg yolks.  3.	One batch  - Green / One batch Red. Added food color before flour.  4.	Refrigerated the dough before rolling it out. 5.	Divide each color in to three equal balls of dough 6.	Rolled out  dough between pieces of wax paper.  7.	Reshaped the dough while rolling so I got 8” squares.  Did this by rolling out the dough in to a round shape, drawing the largest square possible on the rolled out down.  Folding the rounded edges back into the dough squares  and re-rolling.   8.	Laid the two squares of rolled out colored dough on top of each other and rolled to make the spirals.  Refrigerated as directed. (I only did 4 hours). 9. Sliced dough to ¼” thick or 5 mm. for cookies.   10. Cooked only 7 minutes..  did not rely on visual queue of doneness.  Just took them out at seven minutes.  Does not yield 72 - more like 48

I like to mess with the flavors according to the time of the year. During Christmas I like to do a Chocolate and Peppermint mix. Valentine's Day I like to do a Chocolate and Strawberry. You get the idea. Just use what flavoring you like for the "White" side of it or do a vanilla and an orange.....that is a orange cream twist. oh lala.......Great recipe. Thanks

I am pinwheel cookie challenged. So I thought I could roll these like my pie crusts. After colouring the dough, (I cheated and used some kool aid to get the colors darker, though they don't show up dark in the picture) I rolled the dough out on flexible cutting boards. I could easily set the colours on top or each other to adjust size. I used a dough scraper to even off the edges and make square corners. Then I flipped the dough onto the other colour and peeled back the board, did this 2 times. I used the bottom cutting board to aid with rolling, similar to using a tea towel to roll a jelly roll. Wrapped in waxed paper and left to cool. Delicious cookies and will be fun to play with the colours according to the season. Next time I will leave the dough in the cutting board and wrap with elastic bands. This way the dough will not get a flat bottom as it cools. Thanks for the recipe Gitano-it's making the Christmas goodie list in my house.

I used Wiltons concentrated paste for these cookies in the Halloween theme.  As you can see from my pic, mine didn't turn out that well. Not as pretty as the other posted pictures.  I found the dough  sticky, I added some more flour as mentioned and  I refrigerated it over night, but it softened quickly. The cookies seem to taste better, more buttery the next day. I love the idea of this pinwheel cookie ( especially for halloween)and the taste is pretty good.  My daughter loved them and her friends from school really enjoyed them as well. THX.

I made these for Halloween but had trouble with the dough.  I am thinking that maybe the butter wasn't soft enough.  Everyone really liked them though. ..  Update 2/1/09 just put the dough into the freezer so I can make the cookies sooner.  Wow, what a difference from the first time I made them.  I let the butter get really soft and it made all of the difference in rolling the dough.  The dough was nice and soft and rolled very easy.  I rolled each color on parchment paper and then put the one color on top of the other color and rolled.  Very easy and I am sure will taste just as good as they did the last time I made them.

I needed a quick and easy recipe to make a LOT of cookies for an annual cookie exchange. These were perfect. 

Note, however, that you'll need much more food colouring than listed to get a vibrantly-coloured cookie like what's shown in the photo. Also, to keep my cookie-log from settling flat as it chilled, I slit an empty wrapping paper tube lengthwise, wrapped my dough in parchment, and slid it into the tube. Voila: nice round cookies!

I had a really hard time with the dough.  It was so sticky to handle and I added more flour and refridgerated them overnight, but my batch was unsuccessful! Mine didn't look like any of the posted pics at all. The taste wasn't all that either.  Not very sweet.  I will NEVER make these again. A total waste of my ingredients.

I made this the other day and it didn't turn out the way I wanted :(
I followed the recipe exactly,  but in the end my dough ended up very crumbly and ended up cutting them into shapes instead..  I don't know where I went wrong x.x"
Will try making it again next time,  maybe...

This was a really easy recipe to follow. My advice to get the swirls to roll easy is thus: Place waxed paper over a large cutting board. Spread 1 color dough over the waxed paper evenly. Place another sheet of waxed paper on top, and use another cutting board or something with a dull edge to smooth the dough. Try to fill in airgaps between the dough and the paper. Do this with all your dough, making sure you have 2 equal sized sheets of both colors per roll. Chill. Remove waxed paper from both sides of 1 color and top of the other. Place 1 dough on top of the other. allow to warm. Then roll with bottom sheet of paper, squeezing occasionally to press the doughs together. Chill again, then slice.

Great cookie. I took the advice of others here and rolled out on waxed paper, then laid the layers on top of each other that way. Piece of cake. Or should I say cookie?! I added in 1/4 tsp of peppermint extract to the red dough and it gave a great flavor to the cookie. Very holiday. The only thing I'd do different next time would be make two rolls of dough, not one. The single roll that I made out of the dough was so big that my cookies were HUGE when I baked them. As in, about 4 inches in diameter! I like smaller cookies than that. So next time, I'll divide the dough into four piles - two red, two white, and then create two logs of cookie dough, using one of each red and white batch of dough.

I didn't have any issues with this recipe at all. I mixed the dough, colored the dough, then refrigerated it for an hour before rolling it out. I was able to place one colored dough on top of the other without the need of parchment or wax paper to transfer it. I had to bake the cookies longer than 5-6 minutes. I believe I baked them between 10-13 minutes because they were much too doughy otherwise. This is a light tasting cookie, which I love! Fantastic recipe which I will use again! Thanks Gitano!

I had a tough time with the dough in the beginning - probably between baking with a four year-old and working in a very warm kitchen, my first half batch of red and white just wasn't meant to be...so when I went to do the green ones, I chilled the dough before rolling it out, rolled each color out on waxed paper, which made assembly a snap, then chilled the log for maybe 4 hours...the result was very easy to work with!   The cookies came out beautiful and taste great!  I had a few scraps of dough from cutting and I rolled them into balls, dipped in sugar and baked as little round "marble cookies".  If I ever have a problem with the dough again, I'll just do that, but I think with the extra chill time this recipe is a total winner!  Thanks Gitano! :)

This is an excellent recipe.  As some folks have mentioned, it is best to roll the dough between two pieces of wax paper - makes it easier to lay one piece on top of the other.  It's also best to refrigerate the dough a little bit before rolling it out.  I added a small amount of peppermint extract to give the cookies more flavor - you could add whatever flavor you want.  I added cocoa powder to half the dough to make a chocolate layer.  The combination of chocolate and peppermint worked great for Christmas.  I will be making these cookies again and again.

These cookies are delicious, but VERY HARD WORK!!!! My advice is to skip the pinwheel part and enjoy this recipe as tasty little butter cookies.   I had to: 1) make the dough a day ahead; 2) separate each color into three balls and refrigerate; 3) bring the balls out to warm for a few minutes, then roll out btw sheets of wax paper to very thin layers; 4) pop the layers back into the fridge for about 30 minutes; 5) take them back out and assemble the layers and use the rolling pin on them to get good adhesion; 6) put the flat layers back in the fridge for 30 minutes so they won't come apart or stick too much when rolling; 7) take them back out of the fridge and roll them into logs; 8) put the wax paper wrapped logs in the freezer for 30 minutes to an hour so they won't smush when slicing; 9) take them out, slice the logs into very thin cookies and bake on parchment. (!!!) I had to bake mine for about 7 minutes, 5 minutes were very underdone. Do a test batch of about 4 cookies to find the right time for your oven; don't waste a whole dozen like I did!   As I said, these are delicious cookies! But unless you have hours and hours to spend on ONE recipe, roll these babies out and use them as cutouts, or even roll 1 inch balls and flatten with the bottom of a mug. Life will be much easier this way! ;0)

They taste great, but time consuming if you want to get the perfect swirl. Since we were craving something sweet I made these within an hour, orange and purple, but of course they got smooshed while cutting b/c I cut out the refrigeration time. We really needed sugar. LOL. They ended up looking that pumpkins.

Yum! Love these cookies. So buttery and delicious. I made three layers Red Yellow and Green. I put the dough on wax paper with wax paper on top it rolls out great. Plus you don't dirty the rolling pin :) After rolling the layers on wax paper it is just a matter of flipping the next layer on to the first. Which is very scary :) I think because of my 3 layers I got less cookies than stated. I got about 36 cookies out of the batch. Will make again (Probably real soon since the family has already ate most of these and they were supposed to be for Christmas.)

I just pulled these cookies out of the oven, and tasted them. I'll comment on the taste in a moment, but I wanted to address the real issue in this recipe- the texture. Like others, my dough was crumbly, and incredibly difficult to work with. I managed to solve the problem. First, I simply chilled the dough, and that just produced harder to work with crumbly dough. Then, I added milk to the dough and combined it to make a sticky texture. While it was sticky, I rolled it out between two sheets of parchment paper, and then put the two colours together, and rolled it with the rolling pin, then into the log. I chilled it for about 6 hours, and then I was able to cut the slices. It was perfect to work with at this point. 

The presentation on these is great, but the recipe is lacking some more moisture. I recommend adding milk to the butter/sugar/egg comb, probably half a cup (I just eye balled it at the end) You WANT a slightly sticky dough to work with, because once it's chilled it holds it shape. I did have to bake the cookies slightly longer, about 10 minutes. 

Taste is OK. They are sort of bland, but with the ingredients if you're expecting a heavily flavoured cookie you're expecting too much. These cookies are more of a showpiece than a tasty treat. 

Next year I am going to take a tried and true sugar cookie recipe and use the same technique. I recommend you do the same.

I found that theses cookies were quite simple to make, but needed a little more sugar as they were a bit bland. I also cut out the extra 1/3 cup of butter and found that they came out fine without it. The cookies did bake beautifully though, but i had to put some royal icing glaze on them to make up fo the sweetness.

the dough was sticky and didn't roll well and the cookies tasted horrible! I wont try this recipe again. I plan on putting frosting on them so the kids will eat them, but that sorta defeats the purpose of making a pinwheel cookie. The baking time was also off, I watched them and took them out as they got set, which was over 8 minutes. I will keep looking for a good pinwheel recipe

made red and green cookies today for christmas.    only thing I did was refrigerate dough after I rolled it out and before rolling it together and then after I rolled the colors together I froze it for awhile before cutting.    definetely use wax paper with these they get very sticky when they warm up.     will make again when I have more time.  They tasted good too.

The first time I made these, ((For Halloween of 2008, in orange and black,)) They turned out absolutely horrible looking, as I'm not sure I followed the recipe exactly, haha.  The second time around, though, ((For Christmas of 2009, in red and green,)) I followed the recipe extremely carefully, and guess what ...? They turned out absolutely brilliantly, both taste and looks wise!  The only downside is that they're not the type of cookies that you can whip up in a single night --- They definitely take a lot of planning ahead and preparation beforehand. Other than that, though, I love 'em and I can't wait to make them again! I'm thinking maybe separating the dough into two or three segments and tinting each segment a pastel shade for Easter! ^_~

This is a good recipe!  They are not as time consuming as others say either.  I put the dough in the freezer for an hour and that was cooled perfectly to roll out.  Wrapped back up and tossed back in the freezer to chill for the slicing.  It worked out well.  I mixed them at 9 am and was done early in the afternoon (when kids complied of course).  My family enjoyed them very much!  I will do these again with other combos!

These cookies are amazing. I made some to take to work and no one belived me that they were home made!!!

One thing that I have done is up the amount of Vanilla used. Just seems to work better for me.

Good recipe! I agree: use 1.5 cups white sugar, no brown. And freezing for one hour rather than chilling for 8 hours is so much faster and JUST as effective. Thank you!

I just finished making a batch of these. I followed the recipe exactly, I only made mine plain and chocolate swirls. I made the chocolate by adding cocoa powder to the other half. It was a little difficult to roll out the dough, I would suggest chilling it for a while first. Otherwise they turned out great. I think they may taste a little better tomorrow, right now they are a little plain and bland tasting. A good cookie with coffee...!

Just made the chocolate version and it was wonderful! I laid off the brown sugar a bit though and rolled the log in red sugar (like Maurice Lenell's) which are my kids favorite! Dough was very soft and pliable to roll. Great recipe!

I had a lot of trouble with this dough as it kept cracking and crumbling when I went to roll it. Mine didn't turn out nearly as pretty as some of the pictures and they aren't really delicious cookies. Not bad, just not quite worth the struggle. I think the appeal is in how pretty they are supposed to be to look at but as I say, mine weren't.

Yum! I have to say they surprised me a little. I figured they'd be pretty good; you know, average plain Christmas cookie. Well they were plain, but in a really good way. I'd tasted the unbaked dough and it was nothing special, so the delicious buttery taste of the baked cookies surprised me :) As for the method, it worked out well for me. The dough came together easily and it wasn't too sticky. It rolled out pretty nicely (and I'm kind of rolling challenged!). The only part where it worked out less than perfect for me was rolling it up in the log. The bottom layer cracked and started falling apart; I think maybe I rolled it too thin. It patched together well enough and the finished product looked ok, so no big deal. I made only half a recipe (and only got 20 cookies), I might have to make more! Thanks for the recipe :)

These were fun!  I made them for my girls cheerleading team.  I used gel food coloring in blue.  I piped some blue tinted buttercream on the blue cookie and sprinkled with blue sanding sugar.  I let them dry completely then I piped a generous amount of white buttercream on the white cookie portion to fill in and dipped in white sanding sugar.  It had a nice raised, 3D effect.  I did add a tablespoon of dry, double strength vanilla extract for a stronger flavor.  The cookies were a big hit with the girls!

Wonderful Christmas cookies. They basically tasted like a sort of sugar/shortbread cookie, they go great whit a nice warm drink, or just on their own. I like you can go crazy with different colors.  I will say, that the recipe doesn't really specify on rolling the dough with use of any tools. I should have gone with my instinct and put a floured  towel or wax paper under the dough for rolling to help me roll it up, because I didn't and had some issues with it falling and breaking, thus my "spirals" were a bit abstract looking but still pretty.

Ok..trying this again.  I wrote a review, added to it and the original one disappeared, so here goes..again.  First, for those having trouble with getting nice round cookies, try using a cheese slicer.  Second, I suggest a gel food coloring for cake decorating because it is easier to get rich color without adding a lot of extra liquid.  Additionally, if your dough looks pink, don't be alarmed....it will darken in the oven.

Wonderful cookie!  Today I made a red and white version and added 1/2 tsp of peppermint extract to the red bowl of dough.  Yum!  Also had some melted chocolate left over from another recipe and dipped a few of these cookies halfway into the chocolate, oh emm gee!  I think next time I may make a layered bar type of cookie, roll out the dough and use about 5 layers alternating colors, then dip half into the chocolate  ??

These instructions for the cookie are okay but tedious when they shouldn't be and lax when they should be tedious. In my opinion there is no need to sift and resift, a good stir to mix the dry ingredients well is enough. I think brown sugar is useless and makes things harder. 

My tips for this recipe would be: 

Roll the rectangles out between waxed/parchment paper and keep them in the fridge for 30 minutes THEN put them on top of each other. Roll into the log and refrigerate overnight before trying to slice them. 

There is no need to place them on a lightly floured surface, the wax/parchment paper should prevent sticking as you cut them.

To make one half chocolate, just mix in 1/4 cup cocoa powder. There's no need to melt and cool chocolate...what a waste.

To the white half you can add 1/3 cup almond flour, ground almonds or a teaspoon of peppermint essence.

Delicious. I refrigerated the dough before rolling out, the again before slicing. Baked at 350 degrees for 11minutes as I was worried that in my oven they would  burn at 400. They were perfect and very pretty.

I pretty much followed this recipe as is, with some sugar substitutions. The cookies turned out great! The only trouble I had was that the dough got very soft after I mixed in the food colouring, so I refrigerated it for about 10 minutes before rolling it out. I rolled the two colours between wax paper, and then used the wax paper to help me flip the pink layer onto the blue (Princess Aurora "spinning wheels" for a birthday party). I also used the wax paper to help roll the dough into a log, then I put it in the freezer for 1 hour before slicing the cookies. Great recipe!

I haven't tried it yet, but I plan to take the advise given by many who have walked this path before me. I WILL master the pinwheel! Picture will follow, even if it is a "fail" because we can all use a laugh now and then! :)

Thanks for all the great ideas. The cookies look like so much fun, but I'm a big procrastinator so I opened a box of sugar cookie mix and had them done in a few hours. Followed directions on box, split dough & added red/green food coloring. Chilled dough for 5 mins, layed out 20"+ wax paper and placed the red dough in center, another wax paper on top to roll it out. I rolled the dough out nice and thin(rectangular shape), lift wax paper+dough placed on large cutting board to chill until second layer was ready to work with. Roll out green dough same way. I liked the red layer on the outside so i put that layer on the bottom, peeled off top sheet of wax paper, then side by side pulled off top layer of green wax paper. Holding bottom wax paper quickly but gently flipped the green layer on top of the red layer(trim edges if necessary. Gently press the two doughs together. Remove the 2nd green wax paper, which is now on top from flipping.  Roll the long side of the rectangle like a sushi roll.  Start the roll by lifting up the long side to start the roll, The bottom wax paper should still be under both layers, holding both corners lift the wax paper to help roll the log. As you move down the wax paper the dough should fall off as you start rolling.  Roll your log back onto the wax paper, and then wrap with a towel & freeze for an hour. When slicing, remove towel, wax & use are sharp knife and do it quick before the dough starts getting too soft. Reshape and bake 375 for 9 mins.

Everything about these were perfect! I made two batches and added some unsweetened cocoa powder (in lieu of flour) to the one batch I eventually colored red. It made everything come together! I made soooooooooo many cookies and these were my favorites!

These cookies are OK.  I don't really like them though.  It was strange working with the dough that much.  I don't think I will be making these again.  I don't know how the ones in the pictures turned out that well, but ours were aesthetically challenged.

Great recipe! The only thing that i did was to split the recipe in half before I made the dough. Then I added the food coloring( i used wilson gel) to the sugar mixture before i added the flour. This helps get a darker color and keeps the dough from being over mixed. Keeps the cookies light, soft and chewy.

Fabulous, tasty, and attractive.  I followed the directions with one exception.  After mixing the dough, I divided it into 3 portions and added red color to one portion and green to another and left the third portion plain.  Instead of rolling the dough immediately, I chilled each portion overnight, then rolled and rechilled, then sliced. I had no trouble with sticky dough this way.

I am torn with these cookies, they are cute and seem easy enough. The dough was sticky so I used more flour, added my food colouring, used the gels to get the desired colour as they work better then the liquid. But then they were too dry and cracked when I tried to roll them into a log. I have to do some tweaking because clearly there is something amiss here. They taste like sugar cookies. Next time I am going to add the food colouring while in the mixer, and use almond extract instead of vanilla. As for the stickiness vs. dry I am not sure how I am going to tackle this one. I might cut the butter with the original recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly, no stickiness here! The only change is to use as much color as needed.  This recipes was enjoyed by all  and not too sweet.

Very festive cookies!  I was a little stressed while making the dough.  You definitely need to have an extra pair of hands around to help move the green dough on top of the red.  But it was well worth it!  They weren't too sweet either which is good for my family, since we have a few with diabetes.

I personally had a very difficult time with these cookies... I made the dough - put it in the fridge - took it out and rolled it - put it back in the fridge - took it out stacked on on the other and rolled it and then put it back in overnight... the dough gets very warm very quickly and I had a hard time cutting the cookies.  you tend to squish the design on the cookie when you cut them.  I even tried freezing the log... If you are any kind of a perfectionist - I don't think this is the right cookie for you.  Taste like tea cake cookies.  bakes up really light and crispy on the edges - not too sweet...

I noticed that some people had isues rolling out the doe and placing them on top of each other after the food coloring.  Well I found that if you just role out the doe onto wax paper and take the edges of the paper and place the roled out doe on top of each other than it will work. And also use the wax paper on the very bottom to roll up the doe.  It save an extra day of refrigderating! and a lot less mess.

I loved these!    Tips 1. Split the dough into 4 parts.  2. Put red in one, green in one, and leave two plain.  I used food gel color.  You need quite a few drops to get good color with the liquid.  3. Roll it on wax paper.  This aids in flipping it on the other piece.  4. If you use color on the bottom (outside) it helps in not seeing brown edges unless you are ok watching it close.  5. Use the wax paper to help roll it up.  6. Definitely split the baking into two days.  However if you put it together in the morning you could bake them in the evening.   7.  Finally, MOST definitely and sooo important, the ends don’t turn out perfect so eat them up as they come out of the oven!

This Dough is a bit sticky sometimes so be sure to have flour on hand when rolling it out  onto wax paper.  Also, I use a tbsp of warm milk and spread it out on one layer of dough, then put the other layer of dough on top. This helps the dough stick together and when you roll it into a cylinder you won't get gaps that make "holes" when you cut the roll into cookies for baking.

first color roll out I kept adding more flour because it was too sticky.  Second color I put in fridge for a little while before rolling out.  I should make these more than once a year so I remember what I did wrong the last time.  Taste is awesome.  So worth the work and I love the design.

-don't roll the layers too thin, otherwise when you combine them, it isn't very distinct
-Use more food coloring to make it more distinct
-refrigerate dough if its too soft

I had no problems at all with this recipe, and followed it to the letter. I did find them very buttery, but as long as you keep the dough chilled they were really easy to do. My red/green ones looked kinda Dr. Seuss-y, which I totally liked. I think these would be great for any occasion. Really tasty, classic recipe!

Love this recipe! I made 7 doz. for a cookie swap party and  they look and taste  great. I followed the recipe completely, except I added almond extract as well as the vanilla. I did 1 tsp. almond and 1/2 tsp. of vanilla . I will definitely go back to this recipe, the cookies are so festive looking! Thank you Gitano!

Made these for a cookie exchange, and everyone loved them.  Made them green and red.  For the red I added 2 to 3 TBS of cocoa powder, and red food color, to get them a nice red color.

This is a pretty cookie. However, refriderating the dough before rolling would ensure a perfect round pinwheel. As for taste, I tasted a mildly sweet flour dough. Hugely disappointing after all the time spent. I did not serve them.

Cookies taste great!  However rolling them up into the pinwheel was more effort that I was prepared for.  I suggest chilling doughs after adding the food colour and rolling the doughs out on parchment paper, because I had a hard time getting it off the counter! But maybe that's my own naiveness lol.  I also suggest rolling thinner than the recipe calls for, I didn't get enough of the swirl.

I'm just getting into cooking and baking, and this was my first time making pinwheel cookies. Thankfully, the recipe was easy to follow and the cookies turned out soft and delicious! I was a bit worried that the batter was too runny/watery, and I had some difficulty when rolling it out. However, I followed some tips from other reviewers and refrigerated the rolled doughs for about 8-10 minutes, and everything was good to go! Awesome recipe; I'll definitely do this again.

This was a very good and very easy recipe.  Would definitely recomend!  I did my own version thought.  In one half of the dough, I added about 1/3 c. peanut butter and in the other half i added some melted chocolate.  I froze the "log" for about 4 hours before I cut it.  I would change one thing for the next time I make these.  I would split the recipe in half and make two logs.  The cookies ended up spreading some in the oven, creating some rather large cookies.  Overall, a pretty good recipe.

Very Good ! It was a bit trickier to assemble than I thought.  The dough was very soft after I rolled it out and I needed four hands to place the layers together.  Everything else was easy.

The flavor and texture of these cookies are so good!  I really like a cookie that's not overly sweet and pretty much melts in your mouth.  I had a bit of an issue with the rolling out, stacking, and making a log, but they turned out pretty nice in the end.  I think it was just too warm in my house, so I couldn't get the dough chilled enough to cooperate with me.  Thanks, Gitano, for a great recipe!

I adore these beautiful cookies. I had a bit of a time first time around, due to the butter I used I think. But now They are awesome. I turned em into what looks like tiny little christmas presents.I cannot wait to use Easter colors, for Easter.

Great recipe, hard to pull off first time. I imagine they get easier in the future but getting the dough to cooperate takes a lot of motivation, determination, and patience. They taste really good, definitely recommend using a food dye gel as apposed to the liquid dye since it would make sure the dough does not get too thin to work with. I will likely be making this again in the future, that's for sure!

The recipe calls for one drop of red food color to make the dough red and one drop of green to make the dough green.  The cookies  did not look like the cookies in the picture as they were a very pale color.  Is this an error in the recipe?  They tasted ok but my daughter and I made these together and we were both very disappointed that they didn't look at all "Christmasy."

read the reviews, and subbed out the brown sugar for white and added flour.  overcompensated a bit too much and ended up with a very dry dough.

I made the chocolate/plain version exactly as the recipe indicated.  They came out amazing!  Definitely time consuming,  and need to pay attention when cutting that each cookie was cut accurately.   Definitely worth the trouble!

Wonderful cookies. Very pretty and fun to make. Varying the colors and flavors can add a festive twist ;) depending on season. 
Thanks

I love these.  They were really colorful and easy to make.  I also like that they are a simple sugar cookies and not too sweet.  Most of my other Christmas cookies have chocolate ingredients and these cookies were a great compliment to the rest.

These had no taste.   I ended up rubbing a little vanilla on them before putting them in the oven just to salvage them.

I used this recipe to make green/red pinwheels. Dipped one side in white chocolate, then dipped again in red sprinkles. Fun and festive with a great almond taste!

My only issue with these is the brown sugar turns the dough brown.  Use gel food coloring which worked well. But the white portion was not white.  Next time I will use only white sugar.

They were not as good as other spiral sugar cookie recipes I have made. The dough was way too sticky I had to add more flour.  I will not make these again.

I found this cookie rather bland but that was ok considering that the rest of the cookies we made had stronger flavours. Don't use brown vanilla as it will force you to use a tonne of food colouring to get the green or red to show up and the opposite swirl will be brown. Do use a silpat if you want to pick up those rolled-out layers easily. Other than that, the idea of the swirl was kind of cool.

I love the idea behind this cookie. I attempted it and im not sure what happened because my dough was sticky and floppy. Even after being in the freezer it was hard to cut and just smooshed down and became a flat blob. I cooked it longer then the recipe called for and part were still raw. The parts that were cooked had no flavor what so ever. This was a total bust for me...But I will attempt again.

CHANGES I MADE:
1= 1/4 tsp almond extract
2= extra 1/4 cup of flower
3= used bosche dough hook to add color evenly
4= rolled dough between two sheets of parchment paper to make for easy layering
5= used my freezer instead of fridge for chilling and reduced my time to 2hours.
6= I made a double batch and left it in the freezer for the next bake sale my kids come home asking for cookies for at the last minute.

This was such a pretty cookie!! I thought I'd have to try the recipe more than once to master the swirly pinwheel design, but it was beautiful the first time. I think next time I will roll out each dough section (the red and green for me) and then try to cut them to equal rectangular shapes, because my log was a bit uneven, so I had some small cookies and some bigger ones. I used parchment paper, and actually froze the dough for an hour or two instead of refrigerating for many hours. It ended up working fine after I let the dough thaw for 20 minutes. I gave only four stars because as appealing as these cookies are to look at, the taste was a bit too buttery for my liking.  Thank you for a pretty addition to christmas cookie plates!

I saw the picture and it brought back memories of grade school 35 years ago when a classmate's mother would send candy cane cookies in these colors to school.  She made the dough and fashioned them into 'ropes' which she then twisted together and made into the shape of a candy cane.  We LOVED those cookies, and I was just reminding my daughter the other day of Mary's candy cane cookies.  I'm going to make them and keep this recipe.  Thanks so much for the memories!!!!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems with the dough.  You do need to make sure to flour your surface and rolling pin well.  These cookies came out beautifully.  I'll be making again next year.  Oh, and they taste great!
