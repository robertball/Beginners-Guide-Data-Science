I love everything cranberry, but not everyone shares cranberries tartness. The apples adds a touch of sweetness and balance to the cranberries.  Thanks for a little twist on my old favorite!

The combination of cranberries and Granny Smith apples is pretty great. Personally, I can't stand cinnamon so I left it out. The base of crans and apples makes this recipe very adaptable. The only other thing I did was add just a pinch of salt to make the flavor shine just a bit more. Excellent combination!

It was a quick recipe to make and I liked it so much better than the can stuff that no one really eats. So I thought I would try this recipe and I am eager to serve it at the table this year. It taste more like a Preserve or Jam.

This is delicious ! My 9 yr old grandson loves canned cranberry jelly. I worried the  cranberries would be too strong for his taste but it was a hit with the little guy. My hubby liked it too. The apple retained it's own flavor which was a sweet balance to the tart cranberry.  (I used Gala apples)  This is an easy recipe and a definite keeper.

I did not make any changes, and I will definitely make again. I ate it by itself as a dessert.
