Easy to make very delicious and a nice change of pace. But extremely rich. I cut the oil in half and substituted 2 tablespoons of lighter bake and it was still quite rich. Nine servings is unrealistic I would say maybe twice or three times that because all you can eat is a small sliver. That sliver is very good however.

I totally modified this recipe using cashew butter & water for the tahini and soymilk for most of the water. I have to say it's pretty nice! It tastes very much like nutmeg it's very sweet and even despite its richness I like it with a bit of soft butter on top. Low-cal! haha...

Moist and flavorful! It is sweet but not unbearably so! I used whole wheat flour instead of the all purpose kind. The cake is great!

I was baffled that one person would say it is too sweet and one would say not sweet enough. Now I know why. The honey has an intense sweet flavor, but there is a bitter undertaste that the honey doesn't totally mask. I thought it was OK, kind of different. My husband doesn't like it at all.

This recipe actually didn't seem so rich to me but maybe my oven cooked it too quickly. I would recommend maybe doubling the honey or adding molassas. It wasn't hardly sweet at all.
