6.15.18  I had a chunk of fresh mozzarella in the fridge, so I cubed that instead of buying mozzarella balls.  This was a very nice change from a traditional caprese salad.  The tart lemon-y dressing partnered really well with the sweet strawberries, and was very fresh and clean tasting.  Russ Neis, thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was okay, but not a whole lot of flavor.
