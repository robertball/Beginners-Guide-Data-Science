A tasty lemon pound cake but I did have an issue with the lemon glaze. It never thickened and as I poured it over the loaf, it ran right off. I wound up poking holes (picture is before I poked the holes) over the top so that the pound cake would absorb the sauce (it is not a glaze). A few minutes later I noticed that the sauce that ran off of the loaf had puddled at the bottom of the loaf and crystallized. If I ever make it again I will use a different glaze.

Great pound cake. Nice and moist. My only substitute was that I cut the flour in half and replaced it with Flax meal to cut down on the carbs. Great taste. I will add poppy seed next time to it.

Absolutely loved the lemon cake, but not a complete fan of the glaze. I do not consume sugar substitutes much so I referred to friends and family who do. They loved it. I will make it again!

This pound cake is very moist and flavorful, and the glaze really takes it over the top. Personally though, the glaze was just a teensie bit too tart for me as written, so I will cut back on the amount of lemon juice I use next time.

This was my first time baking with a stevia product, and while the cake itself was good, we did not care for the glaze. I felt the glaze left too much of a bitter aftertaste, like many "artificial sweeteners" do. I was also confused by having two types of the stevia product in the glaze. Something tells me it would have been better without the liquid extract. For someone who needs to avoid sugar due to health reasons, I would recommend the cake. You could top it with some fresh berries and sugar-free whipped cream instead of the glaze. The only change I made was to bake this in a bundt pan and then I topped it with some fresh raspberries and lemon slice wedges.

Very good - I questioned a few of the directions (seemed to make it more complicated than it needed to be) but it's super delicious and tangy. I did add a bit of extra lemon juice to the glaze because I left it in the pan a bit too long and it hardened, so I had to recook it but it turned out great. Next time I'll use fresh lemon zest, but dried was just fine. I'm also not sure why the two Pyure products in the glaze (I think the granules would have been fine without the small amount of the liquid sweetener). It does have a tiny 'artificial sugar' aftertaste, but I'll make this again. Lemon is a favorite and this is a low carb dessert option - and with 6 grams of protein per slice, it's a winner!

I only made the lemon glaze and I didn't use stevia at all. I substituted but it came out sticky and had a jelly like kind of consistence

Had some issues with this recipe. The batter was weird, the glaze never glazed, and it tasted off. Iâ€™m not a great baker, so I still gave it 3 stars.

This was delicious!  We made a grain-free flour blend to make this allergy-friendly.  The glaze has an odd texture, so we will be experimenting to get the right recipe, but the flavor packed a tart lemon punch!
