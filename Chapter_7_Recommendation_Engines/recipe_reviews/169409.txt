I didn't taste any lemon, just apricot-orange juice.  I halved the recipe to use the rest of a can that I left after making apricot bars.  It was ok, but as often as I have apricot nectar in the house, I won't be running out to buy any to make this.

Nothing special.  Like another reviewer, not enough lemon juice.

It was perfect for my brunch. I halved the apricot nectar, doubled the lemon juice and added a little extra (fresh)orange juice. I am going to use the leftover for smoothies as soon as I can buy fresh blueberries or mangos.

I made this several times, exactly as written. (I guess Jumex had shrunk their cans of Apricot Nectar down from 12 ounces to 11.3, but since I had multiple cans, and I was already measuring out the 1-1/2 cups of orange juice, I also measured out 12 ounces of nectar.) I liked it, but I guess my palate wasn't discriminating enough to appreciate the combination of juices. It just wasn't anything special, to me.
