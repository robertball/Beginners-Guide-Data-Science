I know how to make it, and it doesn't contain all of these ingredients. I'm not sure who came up with this recipe but it's incorrect. The restaurant employees try to keep it a big secret, but I found out. It took a while, though... 
This recipe was not very good when I tried it a couple of months ago...

You MUST, MUST add ranch dressing.. It wont taste anything like the mexican white sauce without it! Also, a dash of cayenne if you want that little bit of spicyness!

This was a great base recipe! I followed some of the other reviewers advice. I used 1 cup Miracle Whip, 1 cup sour cream, and only put in 1/2 cup milk (I like it a little thicker). I also added in addition to the other ingredients a heaping tbls of ranch dressing, a 1/2 tsp paprika and onion salt, 1/4 tsp cayanne pepper, and doubled the red pepper flakes. It was very good! I am a big fan of the white sauce in my fav VA Beach Mexican joint.

I thought I knew Mexican foods pretty well living in So. Ca my whole life, but this sauce was unknown to me and intrigued me.  I made it to see if we could use it as a topper in tacos.  We ended up dipping tortilla chips before dinner.  Almost as good as guacamole.  Thanks for a new and tasty recipe Jen!

DELICIOUS! It was a huge success when I used one cup Miracle Whip and one cup sour cream (low fat) with double the amount of red pepper flakes and a little onion powder and paprika.

You have no idea howlong I have been looking for this recipe.  It tasted so authentic and was super easy to make.  I no longer serve salsa with my tortilla chips at parties.  Everyone loves this dip more!!!

I followed the recipe exactly, but after two hours it still just tasted like Miracle Whip to me, with a little spice.

I cannot believe that more people have not tried this recipe. This board needs to put this recipe up as a great party/get together snack! It is wonderful and truly tastes just like that in mexican restaurants...Im sure its the same stuff. It is so easy and you should let it sit a couple hours so the flavors blend. Making it today for a beach/girlfriend get together! Thank you.

I've been looking for this recipe for months!!  My husband & kids (even the son, who's a bit of a picky eater) LOVE it!!  I added a bit more crushed red pepper (we like a bit of kick).  Thanks so much!

I've had Mexican white dip with tortilla chips in both Hampton Roads, Va. and in Maryland.  This is definitely not it.  Too much oregano (it's supposed to be Mexican, not Italian!) and the restaurant white dips I've had are thicker and very white  - thus the second time I made this (trying to get it closer to the restaurants' versions), I reduced the milk to 1/4 cup, omitted the cumin which the very-white restaurant versions  obviously don't have, and reduced the oregano to 1 tsp.  The first version was far too spicy hot so I reduced the red pepper flakes down to 1 tsp.  My 2nd version was much better but still not like the restaurants' dip.  The Miracle Whip flavor is too intense, so in my next attempt I'm  going to use 1 cup Miracle Whip and 1 cup sour cream to see if that helps.  (I love the restaurant version and really want to get the recipe as similar as possible.)  The recipe was a starting point but needs more work.  This recipe makes a ton so you may wish to half it.    It can be served with tortilla chips or small pretzel squares.

This recipe was a great jumping off point.  It was too salad dressing sweet tasting for us.  I substituted plain greek yogurt for the salad dressing and milk plus added a few spoonfuls of sour cream and it turns out great w/out the sweetness of the salad dressing.

AWSOME!!!!! I must say it is even better that the sauce we get in the resturant. I made this recipe and then went to the Mexican resturant a few days later and there's no comparison. It's very eay to make and tastes great.

Ill give it five for getting me so close to it . A bit too much Cumin IMO .   I will try with a bit of blue cheese in the future . If you live in Hampton Roads this is the white sauce you've been wondering how to make for years now .

This is the white ranch-y sort of dip some Mexican restaurants serve with chips & salsa.  And this recipe is SPOT ON.  I was craving this dip so bad and wanted to go to our local Mexican restaurant to get it, but couldn't convince hubby of a night out.  Well I found this recipe and totally fixed my craving.  Will definitely make this again.  I scaled down the recipe to 12 servings.

It tasted nothing like I have had, was disappointed.  Like another reviewer stated, it tasted like doctored Miracle Whip.  The sauce I am familiar with is on the sweet side and for me it compliments the salsa.

Mmmm! Delicious! The only reason I go to Mexican restaurants is for the white sauce. In Virginia every mexican place has white sauce, but my husband and I moved across the country and are sad to never have white sauce to dip in! So I searched and found this recipe. It is delish! I have made it twice, the last time I halved all the spices (except for the crushed red pepper) because I found it would leave a strong aftertaste with the full amounts. My husband and I both agree this tastes exactly like the restaurant white sauce... if not better!   Thank you for this recipe, I'll be making this frequently!

This might be pretty good smeared on a sandwich (if you leave out the milk), but it definitely is not a Mexican white sauce.

I was intrigued by all the reviews for this.  I live in So California, and love mexican food.  I have never seen white sauce at a restaurant ever, and no one I knew had either...  so of course I wanted to try this since everyone was so excited to have the recipe.  Um.. I feel like I made a mistake.  Its super super sweet.  I guess I should have known, with the miracle whip.  This is pretty bad, and like nothing Mexican that I can think of.

This recipe didn't work for me. I live in Virginia Beach and love the white sauce at Guadalajara. I don't know the exact recipe but it's not like the one above. Waiter said it includes ranch dressing, cayenne pepper, sour cream, and I think garlic and red pepper flakes. Does anybody know for sure?

All our favorite Mexican restaurants in Virginia serve a version of this white sauce.  Each restaurant makes it slightly differently.  This recipe is *close*, but not exactly right.  I can't put my finger on it, and may have to resort to begging/bribing a waiter to spill the beans.  Clearly, whatever is in it can't be expensive or difficult to find, or they wouldn't all be serving it...such a mystery!

OMG!!!  It's just like the sauce in our favorite VA Beach, VA mexican restaurant!  I can not belive the base is Miracle Whip (which my husband and I both hate.)  This is dead on the money...thanks, All Recipes & JENJONESY!

OUTSTANDING!!  Whole family loved it.  Easy to make, just a few ingredients...this will be a well used recipe in our home.  **from reading the reviews, I am wondering if some of the poor reviews came from people who didn't know what to expect.  Everyone who tried what I made said it was VERY close to the white dip in the restaurants.  A++  Thanks a bunch!

I made this recipe, and it still had slight after taste of miracle whip, so I stirred in 1/2 cup of sour cream and it's PERFECT. I would say this is 95% close to the white sauce at Mia Casita and other Hampton Roads Mexican places. I love it. Thanks for posting it !

This is identical to the white sauce I've had in several Mexican restaurants.   My guests gobbled it down and all asked for the recipe.  The only change I made was to add a little more milk for a thinner consistency, as a personal preference. Allowing the flavors to blend overnight is a must.

I cut the recipe in half and made it. It was okay but I'm not crazy about miracle whip and that's mostly what I could taste. I decided to make it again but follow recommendations and it turned out great with the changes. I used 1 cup Miracle Whip, 1 cup Mexican Crema, about 2 tbsp Ranch, and omitted the milk. For the seasonings I used the same amounts in the recipe for the Oregano, Garlic, and Cumin. I used Seasoned Salt instead and only used 1 tsp Red Pepper Flakes. I also added 1/2 tsp Paprika, 1/2 tsp Onion Powder, and 1/4 tsp Cayenne Pepper. If you want you can add more Red Pepper or Cayenne if you want a kick, but I can't handle really spicy stuff.  It was MUCH better the second time around! Will make again with the changes!

Recipe isn't right... they don't use miracle whip when they cook. They only use ranch on salads. It's made hot not cold.

I like this but next time I'll replace some of the Miracle Whip with sour cream as other reviewers suggested.

This recipe, while fine as a dip, is not what they serve in the restaurants. I know this, because I've made it. They use a certain kind of cheese, and a pepper blend to make it spicy. This is ok for a substitute, but it isn't quite the real thing.

After havng tried this on my last trip to VA I became on a mission to find the recipe and I have.  I did have to tweak it a little as my boyfriend, who is part Mexican, and I felt the crushed red pepper flakes were to over powering but after the tweaks it was perfect.  My brother and sister-in-law wouldn't stop eatting it.  I was actually told I was making it for my niece's birthday party.  My sister-in-law liked it so much she was pouring in on her rice during dinner.  Definetly plan on making this a lot more.

Was really looking forward to making and enjoying this dip/sauce.  Was SEVERELY disappointed.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Not one person in my family would eat it.

I don't know where some reviewers went wrong with this recipe, but i absolutely loved it!  I made it for some co-workers at my job who thought it tasted just like the white dip at one of the best mexican restaurants in Virginia Beach.  I will make this all the time now.  I feel like I cracked the secret code!

I was making a pizza with Mexican toppings, and I used this sauce instead of pasta sauce.  It gave my pizza a wonderful zest.  I will be making it again.

Loved this!  I didn't have miracle whip, just used mayo.  But I used half mayo, half sour cream. Only used a couple tablespoons of milk. Added paprika and black pepper.  Also used way more pepper flakes and cumin than the recipe states.  My husbands Mexican...he loved it with chips and salsa.

This was terrible!  I let it sit overnight and it still had no flavor.  I added a little tomato sauce and a lot more garlic powder, cumin and oregano to try to salvage it, but it's still only passable.

This recipe was OK but not what I was hoping for. I've been to many different Mexican restaurants that had the white sauce but this recipe didn't taste like the Mexican kind. The cumin and the oregano were way off and I never noticed a garlic taste in the restaurant white sauce. Although it tasted OK it's still not the real thing.

Feel like I'm sitting waiting for entrée when I eat this sauce! I made the first time by the book, have to say the oregano was an odd flavor in there...so when I made it again left the oregano out. I was out of milk the second time so it turned out thicker but flavor was fine. Next time I will try the sour cream thing suggested by others. I will suggest using fresh ground sea salt and very little of it since the Miracle Whip has sodium, so do the chips you are dipping.
I had never seen white sauce served with chips and salsa until I moved to Chesapeake in 1996, now I see it everywhere.
Oh...and if you haven't tried them, try Xochitl tortilla chips. They are paper thin, crispy, and ADDICTING. ;)

This is the recipe I have been looking for!!  To get rid of the heavy miracle whip taste, try using light miracle whip.  Also, we substituted cayenne pepper for the crushed red peppers after making the recipe with the red peppers the first time.  It blends so much better!!  When it came to the cumin, we added about a teaspoon and 1/2 to our taste.  This is a great a recipe that my family loves!!!

I've had the dip like this in only one restaurant, and this recipe very closely approximates it; however, I think this might be one of those things where you're better off not knowing the secret ingredient. I liked it, but once I knew the "something special" was Miracle Whip, my brain was like "That's Miracle Whip!" and I couldn't get past it. If you make this for others, I suggest keeping the recipe a secret. Also, when I had this in a restaurant it was a little runny, like queso, and sort of room temperature. Mine came out thick, and I didn't know if I should heat it some or not. Maybe more milk?  To experiment, I added dashes of ground red pepper, chili powder, and paprika, and cut in sour cream. I liked this better...but of course now it doesn't taste like the restaurant dip at all. :-( Finally, my husband, who is from Guatemala, didn't like this at all. In our house we recognize there are two kinds of Hispanic food: authentic and Americanized. :-) Both have their charms (Pass the Old El Paso!) and this recipe definitely falls in the latter category.

I grew up close to the Mexican border and I have never heard of this stuff.  Salsa Verde and Pico de Gallo, but this? No. I was intrigued so I gave it a try.  It was okay, a bit sweet, but certainly not Mexican.  It must be an East Coast thing.

I have been trying for months to duplicate the white sauce found in Mexican Restuarants. This recipe is by far the closest I have found. I tried it with both mayo and miracle whip and the miracle whip really gave it the taste I was looking for. The important thing to remember with this recipe is to let it sit at least two hours. Personally, I would make it the night before for best results.

Where I come from this is exactly like in the restaraunt! However, my recommendation is to let it sit for at least 12 hours, 24 made it better. The longer it sits the more flavorful it becomes!!

This was OK, a little spicier than what we were used to in our local Mexican restaurant. Next time I'll add more milk to make it creamier and cut down on the pepper, but it's a good starting point.

I love mexican and looked a long time for this recipe. It was very good. Next time I'll have to make a bigger batch ...Suggestions would be to add lime juice may want to use a little more milk also depending on the consistency you like.

It was a hit at the party, they were also putting it on the Brats. I gave it 4 because I would put a little less crushed red pepper, really spicy for me.

Didn't have mayo so I used creamy blue cheese and thinned it with lime juice and added the spices. Needs a little tweaking but it was good. This works for how I use it. I put it on top of beans & rice with some Pico de Gallo, olives, cheese, avacado and anything else laying around.

I let it sit for a day, tasting it here and there. After 24 hours it now just tastes like garlicky miracle whip. I stirred it with a whisk and followed the recipe exactly. Not happy with it AT ALL.  This is NOT what I expect to be served at a Virginian Mexican restaurant

It was ok. I wouldn’t go out of my way to make it again. Even after letting it sit for 3 days in the fridge, it was an overwhelming taste of Miracle Whip. Someone mentioned that it needed the ranch dressing mix. If I do make it again, I’ll add the ranch.

I have visited a few Mexican restaurants and sometimes its spicy and sometimes it can taste a little sweet.  I made this recipe and my husband thought it was great but was missing the sweet.  I guess you can use a tad of sugar, but I like spicy so more red pepper flakes.  FYI I use ground red pepper flakes to mix and blend better.

This is a really handy recipe to have, I usually have all the ingredients on hand so It's easy to make.  I have used it in a pinch for fish tacos, just omit the oregano and ad some lime juice.

People please do not mistake this recipe for "cheese" sauce for dip. Also please do not try this recipe for eating straight Miracle Whip with chips is downright disgusting. Thanks Jen!

It's a good start!  I added 1 Tbsp Ranch Dressing, 1  Tbsp Olive Juice (yes, really!) and juice from 1/2 Lime.

Barely even remniscient of the Mexican white sauce. Try with less oregano if you insist on using this recipe.

I tried this chip dip at a restaurant in Williamsburg, VA, and my friend begged the server for the recipe.  Needless to say, we were not given the recipe.  When I came across this one, I decided to give it a try, and it is as good as the one we had at the restaurant.  I didn't have pepper flakes, so I had to substitute cayenne pepper, but I could tell little difference in that respect.  I urge anyone looking for this white dip recipe to try this one.  I don't think you'll be at all disappointed.  This was quick and inexpensive to make.

I've seen this recipe a few times when I wanted to make the sauce since it's usually the first Google result. I made it last night... spent extra money to get the ingredients...  and it tastes awful, nothing like what I wanted. Let it "ferment" for a while like the recipe suggested and it still just tastes like gross miracle whip. Use another recipe.

Okay, so after reading a few reviews I made some changes to the original recipe! I used 1 Cup Miracle Whip, 1 Cup Sour Cream (instead of 2 cups Miracle Whip) also added 1/4 teaspoon Onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon of Cayenne Pepper to the original recipe  and it has a GREAT taste! Love it! Next time I make this I may add some more Cayenne to add some more zing! But honestly great recipe!

I love Mexican food and have made this sauce quite a few times . I make my food very spicy and this sauce helps tame the spice for my mom.  When I make up will add a little dill and some of my own mixed spices to it let it sit for a hr then add some lime juice then let it sit for at least another couple hrs before I serve. Thank you for the recipe

I've made this numerous times, and at each party have atleast one person asking to take home the recipe for themselves.  This is close enough to restaurant style, and I'm quite happy I found the recipe since moving 700 miles away from the restaurant I used to enjoy it at!

This is great! I made enchiladas and poured this over top - wow it's great! I would use this to dip chips in too - what a great sauce!
