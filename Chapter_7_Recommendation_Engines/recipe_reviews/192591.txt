Oh my loveliness!!! This was so yummy I had everyone who tried them ask me to make them again. The only thing I did different from the recipe is add a TBS of lemon zest to the icing. Would highly recommend this cupcake for adults and children.

If you are looking for a cakey traditional cupcake... then this recipe is perfect and warrants 5 stars. Yet, I like cupcakes that gooey and moist. This one wasn't. It had that standard cake-like taste. I thought it would be a bit more moist because of the pudding filling. I added a tiny bit of lemon and vanilla extract in the batter, which made the flavoring of the cupcakes very tasty. Yet, the reason why I gave them four stars, was because of the frosting. The frosting was very very runny. I had to put it in the refrigerator to firm it up some more, as well as add some more sugar. If I make these another time, I may add some milk to the batter, and get rid of the butter in the frosting.

Fantastic! The cupcakes and the frosting are just bursting with lemon flavor. I will certainly be making these again. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. Unlike others, I did not have any frosting left over at all, but that's probably because I piped rather than spread it on. Thanks! :)

The cupcake itself was good but it didn't have much flavor to it, it just tasted like a regular yellow cake. The frosting was the problem with me, it made way too much and melted if you left it at room temperature instead of in the refrigerator (this might be because I used fat-free cream cheese so my review might be biased).

The cake part of these is absolutely incredible.  Everybody who ate them loved them so much!  Ironically, what I didn't like about these is the flavor of the cupcake with the cream cheese frosting.  I *love* cream cheese frosting but apparently not with a sweet lemon dessert.  I will definitely make them again, but I think I will just try a regular white icing instead.

I made these this morning and wow! They are delicious! I made a few adjustments...I used original cream cheese, I'm not a fan of light. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a tablespoon of lemon juice to the cupcake batter and an extra teaspoon of vegetable oil. The cake was amazing! To the frosting I added another 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to thicken it a bit which is necessary if you want the frosting to stay on the cupcakes. I also piped the frosting on instead of spread it. There is extra frosting but I used it as dip for fresh strawberries I had on hand. Delicious cupcakes! Strongly recommend it!

Made these a couple of days ago.  I followed the directions and ingredients as stated in the recipe.  The cupcake had a great subtle lemon taste.  The cupcake texture was like a cake texture.  It was not light and fluffy.  But it still was good.  The frosting was delicious, but for decorating the cupcakes, I would have liked it to be a little thicker/stiffer.  All in all, I will make these again.

These cupcakes were amazingly moist!! Instead of box cake mix I made my white cake from scratch then added the package of lemon pudding- they turned out so delicious that I did not frost them as planned. I had no idea pudding came in so many flavors...I cannot wait to try out more combinations- thanks for a great idea!!

WOW! DELICOUS!!! Very moist! I topped the cupcakes with the zest from the lemons and they were absolutely beautiful....straight out of Martha Stuart. I made them for Easter...they were a total hit!

You will likely have icing left over.  Keep it in the fridge and spread on graham crackers after the cupcakes are all gone.

Really good! I used lemon cake mix instead of white and vanilla pudding instead of lemon (I was improvising with what I had in the cupboard) and they turned out delicious!  This makes a lot of frosting so there's no need to skimp when putting it on.

Tried this recipe but made my cakes from scratch rather than a packet, the frosting actually needs icing sugar added to it to give it the thickness needed to pipe into the cakes

I just made these for Easter.  Topped the frosting with some toasted coconut and a few jelly beans to look like a nest.  Fantastic!

Great cupcakes!!!!! Frosting is a little runny but great flavor, just add some extra sugar to firm it up. Also top with toasted coconut and they are even more amazing!!!!

i followed the recipe exactly, and i think they were only okay. they were very easy to make, but the frosting wasn't as sweet and stiff as i have had other better cream cheese frostings. the cake part also came out very dense. they tasted pretty good, but only the day they were made. i don't think they keep too well so eat them quickly! pretty much it was an easy and fairly okay tasting recipe to make with a 7 year old to pass the time!

This was a very light and delicious  cupcake that had a subtle lemon flavor.  I doubled the recipe and don't recommend doing this, instead just make it twice or else you might burn out your mixer, it makes so much.  I also doubled the frosting but don't think I needed to because the recipe makes so much.  Like another review said the frosting was very soft and tended to melt if it got room temp so I had to put it back in the fridge midway through to firm it back up.  Perhaps next time I will use a different cream cheese frosting recipe and add the lemon (or not).  The egg whites made the recipe very light and fluffy and they were really delish.

Fantastic recipe!  Was a Mother's Day hit.  Changes: Added zest from 1 lemon, and 2 1/2 T lemon juice to frosting.  Delish!
