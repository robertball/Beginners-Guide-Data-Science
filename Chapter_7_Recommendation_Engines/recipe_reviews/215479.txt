Good dish and will make again. I used fresh red pepper and added in the skillet with the onions. I also used 1/8 cup dry basil and added that with the garlic. Thanks!

I wasn't going to make this(recipe group) because DH does not like hot potato salad. But, had to make and post a photo.  I had beans already cooked from something else, so I added them to the potatoes with some of my roasted red peppers, made some balsamic vinaigrette, and put it all together for a sampling and forgot the cheese. I was going to sub cream cheese, but totally left it out. Good flavor, I don't like a lot of balsamic dressing, too vinegary for me, but the longer this sat (and cooled) the better it tasted. I think it might even be good as a cold salad. The potatoes need some salt in there somewhere, unless it is picking it up from the goat cheese. Anyway, sorry about the cheese and thanks Linda!

I used fresh green beans, because they are lush right now and parboiled.  Not a fan of goat cheese, so I used mild feta and the dish was great!  Unfortunately, my camera seems to "ona break", mine looked much like the orignal picture!

This potato salad is DELICIOUS!! Only other warm potato salad I have eaten is German type, and this is so very different and wonderful. I followed the recipe as written except I had to use dried basil, but I'm sure this is even better with the fresh. I was sure my boyfriend wasn't going to really care for this, he has never tried goat cheese, but he went back for seconds, he really loved it. I didn't think the balsamic overpowered this at all. I will definitely make this again, we ate this for lunch. Thanks Linda for sharing, it's a winner for sure :)

Recipe Group selection of 10/15.  I have had this in my recipe box for a while and I'm glad to finally get the nudge to make it.  I followed the recipe as written but for using fresh green beans and my own roasted peppers.  I was concerned about the dressing flavor overwhelming the salad flavors so I served that on the side and I think it was a good call.  When I make this again (and I will) I will just toss everything with some warm Evoo and let the goat cheese shine.  Thanks, Linda

we loved these potaotes, since I never have the right peppers, I used a fresh red pepper and a jalapeno, sliced up  I used feta cheese-the only cheese the family will eat other than mozza and cheddar. I found a recipe on the net for the  balsamic vinaigrette dressing and will make these again, Thanks Linda!

This was a wonderful addition to our cookout, so much lighter than your typical potato salad. I used what I had on hand though, balsamic vinegar and olive oil instead of the vinegarette, fresh green beans versus the frozen, and feta cheese instead of goat cheese. I had no complaints and I'm planning to make again this weekend.

Delicious & such a nice change from ordinary potato salad! I followed the recipe exactly except that my vinaigrette was "light" instead of FF. Everyone at our Mother's Day gathering loved it!

I used Yukon gold potatoes instead of red, and steamed them in my Instant Pot (5 minutes, high pressure, quick release). I skipped the red peppers, because I didn't have any on hand, and used feta cheese in place of the goat cheese.  We all enjoyed this next to our baked chicken. I'll be having the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Thanks Linda!

This is absolutely delicious! I made it twice in one week and never got tired of it. One time, I used red wine vinegar and the second time I used regular balsamic vinegar. The balsamic vinegar changes the color slightly but doesnâ€™t make it look unappetizing. I heeded the advice by the submitter and used red pepper goat cheese in one portion and loved it. What a great salad! Thank you for the recipe.

GREAT Perfect summer potatoes with beans added. 
I did not use near as much balsamic, just don't like it to vinegary. Like doing the beans this way. Could just do beans.
I used all fresh vegetables and added a few red pepper flakes. This could easily have bacon added to it.
Company loved.

Loved it! I forgot to add the balsamic at the end and there was no fresh basil at the grocery store, so I used the squeeze paste kind and it was still delicious!

I made this as indicated with one change. I added 1/3 cup pancetta and crisped it, then added the onion and green beans per the instructions. My family loved it and it will be a regular for us. Great summer picnic dish.

Hubby loved it.  Paired it with pork chops and applesauce, and had a terrific meal.

This was a hit from the first bite.  I used fresh green beans and subbed feta for goat cheese because it had it on hand.  We enjoyed this warm the first night and cold the second and it was great both ways
