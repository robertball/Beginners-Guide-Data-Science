We thought this was very good! This is not a dry meatloaf, but it is on the dense side, which was fine with us, but just be aware. I did not top it with the mozzarella cheese, but instead used 'Katie's Meatloaf Sauce' from here for the topping (we like a sauce topping on our meatloaf), which was a great addition. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I love this recipe for meatloaf! It's simple, juicy, and develops a nice crust. I also like that it doesn't contain any tomato. I have family members who are allergic to nightshades, and finding a meatloaf recipe that doesn't contain tomato or tomato-based products is a nightmare.

This is a good solid meatloaf.   It doesn't keep to we'll overnight, so it's best to eat it fresh.  

I added a bacon wrap and a sweet sauce.  Did have to drain alot of grease off of it.

This turned out great!! I used Stove Top Stuffing and the spices in the stuffing added a lot of flavour. I didnâ€™t put the cheese on top. Instead, I put ketchup on the top prior to cooking. I will definitely make this again.

I made it and the taste was good, but not great.  I will make it again, but add more seasonings.. 
I like how it soaked up the juices and made the stuffing flavorful, but it still lacked  something.
I like the approach and will work on it.

Only 3*s for the 'original' recipe.  It lacked flavor, & I didn't care for the texture. The next time I made it, I did this:  I used 90/10% Ground Sirloin, added 1/3 C. finely diced Bell Pepper (U can use red OR green, but red is a bit sweeter).  I also added 1/3 C. of Evaporated Milk (so that the Meatloaf wouldn't be so dry), and 2 Tbsp. of Lipton Onion Soup Mix  (for more flavor).  I omitted the cheese on top, but topped off the Meatloaf with plain old  ketchup, 'cause that's what we like.

This was very tasty. Followed the recipe 100%. Next time, and there will be a next time,  instead of cheese on top, I will use catsup/brown sugar. Just our preference.

It was wonderful meat loaf. Followed the recipe and will use again. Decided condiments on the side for individual taste and the cheese was a nice touch!  Thank you

Flavor was ok but needed salt. Also needs some additional liquid as it was a little dry.

Fantastic if you have limited ingredients. Adjustable with seasonings if needed as well, I used turkey stuffing as that is what I had on hand, came out fine. Nice density, did not fall apart while serving as some tend to do.

I used ground turkey instead of hamburger. I found it bland and added more herbs (sage, thyme, marjoram, oregano) in a country gravy to serve with it. I'm going to keep tweeking this until I have a great Thanksgiving leftover dish .

Quick and easy base to start with. I like a bit more flavor, so add Worcestershire sauce. I also skip the cheese and coat the top with ketchup before putting in the oven because that is how we like it :)

Do you make the stuffing mix first, or use it dry?
