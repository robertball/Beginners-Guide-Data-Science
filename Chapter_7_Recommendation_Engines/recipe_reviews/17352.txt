This recipe is great! I usually use one vanilla custard and one pear babyfood jars. The custard keeps it really moist, similar to what yogurt would do. Not very sweet so I drizzled lightly with a powdered sugar icing. Last time I tossed in some chopped pecans for added texture.  People at work rave about it!

Delicious cake - recipe similar to one from my childhood.  Baked it at 350 degrees b/c & thought the posted temp was a typo.  I couldn't find plum baby food, so I substituted prune - worked great!  I used 1/2 cup applesauce b/c that's what it came in (individual serving size) and reduced the oil to 1/2 cup.  Also used pecans b/c my husband's allergic to walnuts.  Very moist.

I cooked it at 350 (by mistake) and it took 55 minutes. I used mixed fruit and prune baby foods, because that was what I had. This is a quick work-day dessert that goes together quickly and can bake during dinner or dinner prep. I suspect any fruit baby food would work. The texture was okay (not as dense as I expected) and the fruit made it moist. Great with whipped cream, ice cream, or a drizzle of icing. Frosting would be too much, IMO. This is quite a sweet cake. Next time I will reduce the sugar by at least half, but I will certainly be making it again. Once we no longer keep baby food in the pantry, I'll sub frozen fruit (thawed) with a splash of water and run through the food processor or blender...or just increase the applesauce. Thanks for the recipe.

I used 2 jars of mixed fruit and used chunky homemade applesauce. the cake had a good flavor but was a little dry. I think next time I am going to have to try the vanilla custard suggestion by "luvcooking4others" and see if that will work.

My mom made this cake often when I was a kid. It's fantastic. Plum baby food is sometimes hard to find, but plum/apple blend is pretty common and works just as well. It's a really great breakfast coffee cake especially with a little vanilla yogurt.

The author forgot to list how much salt in the ingredients list, but mentioned salt in the recipe instructions. Just to be safe, I added 1/2 teaspoon.
