I'd say this was just o.k. though it met with some great reviews from friends. I had trouble getting espresso powder and so used some starbucks strong instant.

Delicious!  For a better coffee flavor, I would double the expresso powder.

I made this two and a half months ago. The only change was using a combo of dark and light brown sugar. Everyone loved it more after the first 48 hours. I just ate the last bit that I'd frozen. It's especially good slightly warmed. This is the only time I have enjoyed dark chocolate!!!
