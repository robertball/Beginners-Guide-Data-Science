I changed this recipe to cook in a crockpot. Use well trimmed brisket or you will have WAY too much fat!! I followed most of the ingredients, but I added Dried onion soup mixes {2}, water to come half up to the meat,and Worstershire sauce. I cooked on high 4 hours and low for as long as everyone got home!!! {3 to 5 hrs} After eating some sliced meat with our dinner, I put the pot in the fridge. The next morning I skimmed all the fat off the top. Later, I also added stew vegies to the liquid {along w/ chopped meat that was left} in order to use everything!!! My whole family loved it!!

This is a very good and tasty recipe, however the cooking time is far to long. The cooking time should be cut down to 2-2 1/2 hours. The outside of the meat was very hard, inside was dry but tender. I will try this recipe again, but not cook it as long as the original recipe calls for.

Something is very wrong with this recipe.  I'm not sure if it is the temperature of the oven or the number of hours your to cook it for.  I started with a 5.25lb cut of brisket. Nothing would cut this meat, it was like leather.  It smelled wonderful for the first hour that it cooked.  Then I was outside - when I came in the house 4 1/2 hours later (total cooking time 5 1/2 hours) you could smell it had burned.  What a dissapointment.  (the creamcheese/horseradish sauce is great!)

This is a great recipe.  The marinade was very tasty.  I am glad I read the other reviews because the cooking time is too long.  I cooked a 6.25 cut for only 3 hours.  I left the fat on and trimmed it off after cooking it. I was very tender.

I used a 2 lbs. brisket & cut the recipe in half.  I marinaded the brisket for 2 days.  I then put the brisket & marinade in the crock pot on high for 3 hours.  I sliced the brisket thin & put in back in the crockpot so it wouldn't dry out.  I accidently added a tbsp of garlic instead of horseradish.  After I realized my mistake I added a tbsp of horseradish and it tasted terrific.  I didn't have any leftovers & I will be making this again.

Very good flavor.  I made this in the crockpot just for the ease.  I seem to have a problem with getting brisket tender.  This fell apart when we sliced it, but was still a little dry.  I also added a little red wine and some grill spice.  I saved the juices for a soup base for vegetable-beef soup as they were excellent.  Hubby loved horseradish sauce.

I made this recipe as stated EXCEPT for the cooking time.  I used a 4.75 lb. brisket and baked for 2 1/2 hours then let rest for 20 minutes before slicing.  Since I'd only done a brisket in the crockpot previously, I wasn't sure if I was to cover or leave the meat uncovered during baking.  (The recipe didn't say one way or the other.)  I covered it the entire time and it was tender and delicious!  I think I'd like to experiment with the marinade using chciken, pork or beef ribs.  Mmmm.

I substituted worsheschire sauce for the soy sauce and a roast instead of brisket. After marinating for 24 hours I cooked it on high in crock pot for 3 hours. Tasted WONDERFUL!  Made some great leftover dishes too.

Wow! My husband usually doesn't rave over dinner, but this one is a winner. A 6 pound brisket baked for 3 hours and left to rest for 1/2 hour before cutting. Perfect!!!! Thank you for sharing this recipe. We're going to use this one often.

I have been making a similar brisket for years and we love it.  I use the consome, a small bottle of soy sauce, 2-3T of liquid smoke, 1/4 to 1/2 C of lemon juice (this is what tenderizes it) also garlic powder.  We have always eaten it with our favorite BBQ sauce and it makes great BBQ sandwiches.

The meat turned out really well--I also cut the cooking time--but I feel there is too much liquid smoke. My daughter loved the meat because it tasted like bacon, but I didn't care for it.

I experimented with this recipe using only a 1lb brisket prepared exactly as directed and cooked it for 45 minutes.  It was a perfect and tender medium.  The marinade is exceptional.

Marinade and cream cheese horseradish gravy kicker are great. I kept marinade in as braise liquid and then separated fat at end. Using low salt soy sauce is best as liquid reduces. 2 to 2.5 hours for starting room temp meat uncovered at 320 F. Result was brisket strips. I can understand if explicit directions are followed, shoe leather is result. I usually use recipes as guide and implement my own sensibility in execution. Thanks for sharing!
