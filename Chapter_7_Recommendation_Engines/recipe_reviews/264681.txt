This was an instant hit with my family.  The adults topped the sandwich off with the poached egg while the kids opted out of the poached egg and went with a raspberry jam on top.  It was wonderful both ways!

I used Asadero and Havarti cheeses which were amazing on the sandwich.  You can use many different kinds of cheese as long as they are melty.

Chef John, thank you for another yummy recipe.

I made this without the lemon zest (my husband wouldn’t have eaten it if I had put it in). It was incredibly easy and came out perfect. This will definitely be added to our dinner menu rotation.

Yum!  I left out the cayenne pepper. I also made the poached egg in the microwave. Fill a cereal bowl half full with water.  Add vinegar (I used apple cider vinegar). Warm in microwave for 60 seconds. Break an egg into the water and pierce the yolk with a fork. Put back in the microwave and cover. Cook for 60 seconds. Check to see if the egg is done to your liking. Add additional cooking time as desired.  Remove egg with a slotted spoon.

Absolutely delicious!  Next time, I will substitute 
3/4 tsp mustard powder for the lemon zest ~ I think it will compliment the other ingredients more than the lemon zest

Even thought I made one sandwich with one egg, I did make some tweaks to it. Instead of the honey baked ham, I used honey ham for the deli. I didn't have any champagne vinegar and used white wine vinegar instead. I didn't have any lemon zest and used lemon juice in its place. Although my sandwich and my egg fell apart on me, it did taste real good. I will make two sandwiches next time for a quick dinner meal.

We loved it. It’s easier to make than a real monte cristo and just as delicious! I used less salt in the batter since I used Black Forest ham instead of honey ham and it was more than enough salt (I’ll probably still use less next time). Also, i only used about half the amount of lemon zest because I knew my boys wouldn’t appreciate it as much as I would. It was enough to have a hint of lemon but not noticeable enough to deter my boys. I love it with the havarti instead of Swiss like I do with the monte cristos. I was told I could keep this on my menu. :)

I hate to review recipes without following them but here I am doing it. this was very good! that being said I did make some changes when I saw the amount of calories. I decided I had to make it lighter
1. for dipping I used egg whites instead of whole eggs
2. I subbed 3/4 of the cream with cashew milk
3. I used Hormel naturals honey ham instead of honey baked ham
4. I used a fried egg on top because I don't like poached eggs.
With these changes I was able to cut out half of the calories. 
I liked it and my husband said it was bursting with flavor! so, double win!
thanks so much for sharing!

I used a little garlic powder and not lemon zest because I didn’t have any. This was sooo good, I might make it for breakfast in the morning.

Way easier than anticipated having never made one before.  I used pepper jack  cheese on one and  mozzarella on the other.   I used regular milk instead of cream.  I have an egg poacher - so that really helped, too.
Whole grain bread worked just fine.
The cayenne really hit the spot for me.

Awesome recipe.  Just make sure to tweek it to your personal tastes such as how much salt etc.  I prefer to use whole grain breads or sourdough.  White and whole wheat are processed flours with similar absence of food value...but that is only my choice.

3.5 stars.  I made it with whole wheat bread slices, for a healthier option.  But I believe it would have been better with plain white bread.  I'm not sure the cayenne, lemon zest, nutmeg and salt in the batter made any significant contribution in the flavor as opposed to a traditional egg batter for French toast.  Maybe more spices are needed?  I felt the 1 egg on top would have been better if it were 2 eggs, as the sandwich was somewhat dry. I think this dish could be better, with some tweaking.  I'm not sure I would try it again though.

Since we don't eat pork (ham), I substituted with finely sliced roast beef. It worked great. My husband and son really enjoyed these sandwiches.  Though I have about a dozen bottles of different vinegars on hand, I did not have any champagne vinegar. I used maple-flavored one. Delicious. Thank you, Chef John.

We really liked it, however I will definitely omit the lemon zest. Next time I will garlic, or something savory, instead of lemon. On the egg I added salt and pepper. I also just poached it in salt and white vinegar.
