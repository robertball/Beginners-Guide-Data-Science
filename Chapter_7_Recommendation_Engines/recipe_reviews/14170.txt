My spinach-hating kids loved this! I cut the recipe in half, except for the nuts and fruit. I used pine nuts instead of walnuts, since that's what I had lying around, and I also added a handful of raisins. After poking around in it dubiously, torn between foods they adore and a food they despise, each child finally took a bite. The surprised looks on their faces were priceless. This will be a good one to bring to pot lucks or family holiday gatherings (keep the dressing on the side and toss the salad once you get there, though).

Kids will probably love it because it's sweet.  It was a little too sweet, but I added crumbled bleu cheese to it and the result was a wonderful salad.  When I made the dressing it didn't seem quite right.  A little too oily, so I ended up adding more jam and more vinegar until it tasted good.

Great salad.  It's definitely worth the effort to make the dressing.  Like others, I added blue cheese, a nice touch.

Good recipe. I used a bottled raspberry vinegarette. Definiately toast the walnuts. Looked pretty. Next time, I will probably add some blue cheese crumbles.

A delicious blend of raspberries and strawberries.  I used fresh frozen raspberries to make the raspberry vinigar and tossed a few into the salad.

A great ladies salad!!! I used bottled raspberry dressing instead of making the one in the recipe. I received many compliments on this salad. It is a nice combination of ingredients.

The salad dressing was out of this world (I did add a little bit of salt and pepper).  The only change I made to the salad was to use raspberries instead of strawberries (too expensive).  This complimented my Christmas meal perfectly.

Excellent recipe. I didn't add the kiwis because I couldn't find them at 3 stores(maybe out of season?).  I added crumbled feta cheese & toasted pine nuts in place of the walnuts & everyone thought it was great. Super easy, too.

I'm so happy I came across this recipe again. I had made a very similar variation 2 years ago. I love it!! It's so simple and tasty. I use almonds instead of walnuts. And substitute the oil with extra virgin olive oil.

Expensive, but good to serve company.  Looks fancy and tastes wonderful.  Cut the sugar in half though; it's too sweet as is.

This is phenomenal!  I made this for a dinner party and everyone raved.  I used store-bought raspberry-walnut vinegarette dressing instead of making the dressing, and also used almonds instead of walnuts.  You can make this a few hours ahead of time, but add the dressing just before serving.  It is sweet and tastes as delicious as it looks!  Even the men at the party who didn't consider themselves "salad eaters" raved and went back for seconds.

This was very simple and adds a new twist to a boring salad.  I have also used other kinds of fruit, and preserves to make the dressing.

Maybe I did something wrong, but the spinach leaves stuck together and the fruit sank to the bottom of the bowl. I didn't care for the taste, but my husband liked it a lot.

I love this recipe, but I tweaked it a bit, I added chicken to it to make it more filling.  I sauteed the chicken breast in a little oil and some of the raspberry jam-the jam burnt the pan, but it was worth it-the chicken was wonderful and the entire salad was yummy!  I put a piece of Italian bread on the side to sop up the left over dressing (which is awesome)-and the meal was OMG good!!!!!

Awesome!!! Had it for dinner with lentil soup:) I'm still licking my fingers:) Although I made some changes as I did not have specific ingredients. Here is my modified version: 1. Maple Syrup (instead of Jam) 2.Balsamic dressing without fat (instead of vinegar 3. 1 tsp red wine (just experimenting, in place of vinegar:)) 4. Handful soaked nuts (walnut, pistachio, cashews, almonds). 5.Extra virgin olive oil (in place of vegetable oil). 6. Just spinach (washed in salt water, rinsed with plain water- made it crispy) and strawberries.  Yummy... I'm planning another version today: lettuce with tangerines:) can't wait to eat it:)

Absolutely deliciousm Made half, as there were just three of us eating and it was a side salad, but I should have made the whole thing. The dressing is fabulous. Make sure to use raspberry balsamic for the dressing and to toast the walnuts and let them cool before adding to the salad. Thanks!

Excellent.  Almost like a desert.  You can also just use store bought rasberry/walnut vinegrette dressing if you don't want to make your own.

This is a tasty salad. I used balsamic vinegar in place of the raspberry vinegar (i didn't have any), and reduced the oil by a few tbsp. I also candied the walnuts by adding some brown sugar to a small frying pan and toasting the walnuts while the sugar melted. It was very good! Thanks for the recipe, Amy.

Simple and yummy.  I searched a couple stores and couldn't find raspberry vinegar, so I used Annie's Raspberry Vinaigrette.  I also toasted my walnuts.

Kid Friendly Kitchen! And the salad was great! We Substituted the walnuts for sunflower seeds and almond slices. And added Avocado. I also love romaine so I added a couple of leaves cut up for a bit of a crunch. The dressing is wonderful and I have it for my other salads as well.

This is a very good salad.  Following the advice of other reviewers, I added just a bit of crumbled feta to the salad.  That made it an absolutely excellent salad.  This has become a potluck standard for us.

I made this for an adult dinner party and everyone loved it including my 9 year old. Next time I will try the blue cheese with it. I doubled the dressing to make the salad again the next day. Add dressing just before serving or it will be soggy

I've been trying to find a recipe like this for a while. My sister-in-law made it over a year ago but says she lost the recipe she had. She did offer to "wing it" for me but has never got around to it. Instead of the rasberry viniger, she used a balsamic viniger. It was amasing!

This was ok. I took it to a family lunch and it was a hit and miss thing. You have to be the type how likes to mix fruit and lettuce. The dressing was a little over powering. But that's my thought..

Everyone flipped over this salad at our party. Due to allergies, I had to leave out the kiwi. I candied pecans which made them extra special in the salad. Thanks Amy!

I made this salad for Easter and everyone loved it.  It was gone so quickly, I wish I had made a double batch.  Next time though, I am going to leave the dressing on the side in a shaker and then pour over individual servings.  Otherwise when you get to the bottom of the bowl the spinach is a little soggy from sitting in the dressing.

This salad is so good. It sounds like a strange mix but it's great. I used strawberry jam instead of raspberry for the dressing and used slivered almonds instead of walnuts. My family all turned their noses up at it saying that it was gross mixture until they tried. They absolutely loved it and ask me to make all the time. You have to try it.

I ran across a similar recipe several years ago and it turned my veggie hating hubby I to a convert!  I use raspberry preserves instead and toast the nuts first until they are fragrant.  He looks forward to it every spring when strawberries are in season.

This recipe is SOOOO good.  The dressing is what makes it the biggest hit.  I make this dressing often for spinach salads with fruit.  You can also add in blueberries, and I DEFINITELY recommend adding in feta or blue cheese.

What a refreshing salad and healthy too! I made the dressing and didn't have raspberry vinegar, so used white wine vinegar instead. I test tasted the dressing and it was missing something. So I added a couple dashes of garlic powder and onion powder, and one dash of salt. Much better tasting. Loved the sweet strawberries and tart kiwi together. I used pecans and topped with some crumbled feta cheese.

I really liked this.  The dressing was good, be careful not to use too much or it will be overpowering.  I think it may have been better the second day.  I didn't have rasberry vin so I used red and it was fine.

I used red wine vinegar and strawberry preserves and added sliced fresh strawberries. I had only  Feta cheese on hand so used that in lieu of the bleu cheese. This was a big hit with my 4, 6, and 10 year old grand kids and all 3 said it looked like a "Christmas Salad" with the toasted walnuts and bright red berries and spinach greens. Will definitely do this again. Thanks for another winning recipe!

Used cran-orange champagne vinegar with blood orange olive oil and blackberry jam for the dressing because it's what I had available.  I added avocado to the salad.  It was delicious.

My family liked it... but I couldn't get the guts to try it-(due to the intense smell of the raspberry vinegar). I used mango instead of kiwi-(i don't like kiwi). My family liked it, but I didn't try it.

I used mixed greens instead of spinach, olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and left out the walnuts since I didn't have any. It was still yummy, although it was getting a little soggy after sitting out for a couple hours.

Really original and tasty salad - Since the dressing is sweet and it contains fruit, we served it for a side at brunch and we really enjoyed it!  I cut some of the olive oil to reduce the calories/fat.

One of the best salads i have ever had.  Made a few changes, added chicken, crumbled blue cheese and added fresh raspberries.  Dressing turned out great!  I Will make this one again!

Very good, although it does not keep long at all.  Next time I think that I will make all the ingredients, although not mix them. That way I can have more later.

First time eating salad by choice, it was great! I also made some changes. I used only 4 cups of spinach, and a little under 1/4 cup of coconut oil, instead of vegetable oil. I also traded the raspberry vinegar for  pomegranate. And I used red walnuts. Everyone loved it and if I can eat it, it must be delicious!!

I am giving this 5 stars but you HAVE TO ADD Mandarine oranges! SOOO GOOD! I gave this recip. to my gma..at the bottom of the salad I would say too much dressing, but since i didnt personally make it, for all I know she made more than called for, so since there is fruit in this salad, watch how much dressing you add, since It will be moist naturally!YUMMY SALAD- WENT SOO FAST THIS EASTER, EVERYONE LOVED IT!

This was the best.  I didn't have raspberry vinegar, so I used balsamic.  Will definately make this salad again.

I am a cooking teacher and I had my students prepare this recipe.  I assumed they automatically wouldn't eat this because of the spinach but they LOVED it!  It has a great flavor and is very easy to prepare.

Very easy to pull together.  I did add Dijon mustard as one reviewer suggested and I think it added a new dimension to the dressing.  I also used EVOO.  Very tasty with the salad.

I made this for my husband's family who don't eat salads on a regular basis & they really liked it.  Especially the dressing (my addition was 3T of fresh squeezed orange juice to give it a little citrus-y vibe). Then doubled the recipe to make sure there was enough.  Glad for the extra as it was all gone & the salad bowl was empty.  Going to make this anytime someone asks me to bring the greens.

Loved this recipe.  Only change, I candied the walnuts and let everyone add as many as they wanted.  Will be making again next weekend.  Family asked for a repeat.

This is a terrific salad and so easy. Here are my tweaks. I made this for a salad luncheon the other day and didn’t use kiwi because it didn’t look great at the store. But our fresh local strawberries are in season so I used those, the feta and walnuts generously and made the dressing with homemade raspberry preserves. 
Regarding the dressing, I couldn’t find raspberry vinegar so used a good white wine vinegar which I loved. I also used much less vegetable oil, more like 3-5 Tbsp instead of 1/3 cup for a recipe and a half. Mixed it with my immersion blender the night before and it did t really require shaking the next day. 

I made about a recipe and a half of the dressing because I used about a bag and a half of spinach in my large salad bowl. Still had some leftover because I didn’t want to drown the greens in dressing. Perfect!

Very good healthy recipe!  I added 1 tbs of Dijon mustard  to the dressing.   It made a big difference to the flavor of it. I recommend you add the mustard.
