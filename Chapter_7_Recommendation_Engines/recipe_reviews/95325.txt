I made this for dinner tonight. Oh, my gosh! The lamb just fell off the bone. My husband said this is definitely company food. Even if someone didn't care for lamb, they would like this dish. I did use half of the vinegar & it was just the right amount. I served sauteed asparagus, red potato mashed potatoes & spinach salad with the shanks. The sauce from the meat was really good on the potatoes also. Next time, we decided, we will try this recipe with beef shanks.Edit 6/05: Made this recipe again.I realized that I left something out of my previous review. There was a lot of sauce left over so I put it on some pasta a couple of days later. It was absolutely delicious!

This is a great recipe! A little brown sugar will also cut down the sourness. I found that this worked really well in a crock pot as well as the oven. I've also used diced leeks and zucchini on the bottom layer.

Thank you for posting this recipe!  We made it for Christmas dinner this year with a few changes.  We only used 2 shanks so we used the calculator to adjust the recipe and cut the vinegar down to 1/4 cup based on everyone's reviews here.  We put everything in the dutch oven and put that in the oven at 350 for two hours, flipping the shanks after hour 1 just to make sure they didn't burn since we didn't have a lot of onion protecting the shanks from the bottom of the dutch oven.  Served the shanks with Greek lemon garlic roasted potatoes that we found a recipe for at About.com's Greek food section, putting the potatoes in the bottom oven tray at the end of hour one and then taking both the shanks and the potatoes out at the end of hour two, ready to serve.

The sauce for the lamb shanks was amazing.  We used a good wine and were not disappointed at all.  I saved the leftover sauce for pasta (conchiglie) the next day and it was phenomenal.  Will definitely make this recipe again.  My dad, who was visiting, insisted on having a copy to take home so he could do it again too.  We both felt that if this had been served to us at a restaurant we would have been happy to have paid top dollar for it.  Even better to be able to say that we made it ourselves!  Thank you.

This is so fantastic!! I loved not having to brown the shanks.  I used about half the balsamic vinegar but would not change a thing otherwise!

This was absolutely amazing!  I made it for dinner last night, followed everyone's advice and cut the vinegar by half.  My husband was very impressed, and he loves lamb.  I can not wait to make this recipe for company- it is simple to prepare and the end result is just superb.  This one is definitely a keeper, and one that I will make over and over!

I thought the sauce was too sour with all the basalmic vinegar, lemons and red wine. I'd cut way back on the vinegar, and probably leave out the lemons the next time. Meat was great however.

Made a wonderful valentines dinner!  Based on other reviews I cut back on the balsamic vinegar.  Served it with soft polenta - perfect match!  I have set this recipe aside to use with company.

This was very good.  We did add a little brown sugar to the sauce after we removed the meat and thickened it with corn starch  to go over our polenta.

Unfortunately i only read the first few reviews and not the last ones that commented about too much vinegar!

I have tried to add honey, brown sugar, beef stock but its still too vinegary for me sorry!

We love lamb and this recipe in particular. Agree with most about the vinigar and cut to 3/4 cup, used 8 cloves of garlic too. With 1 hour remaining we added 12 quarted fresh mushrooms. Best served with "Country Pride Egg Noodles which can be found at most Walmart's; this brand makes a big dirrerence.

I made this as directed with the only change being that I halved the vinegar and also the lemon but I wasn't too thrilled with the results.

It came out much too sweet, oily, and lemony.

Also, as written, the instructions for the lemon are confusing. It reads that there should be 2 lemons quartered and if I'm supposed to place a lemon quarter on each side, it doesn't make much sense unless the pan is 8 sided?? I *think* it should have read 2 lemons halved.

This was great! As others have mentioned, I cut the vinegar in half and used only 1 lemon. And we feel 4 cloves of garlic is just a good start, we used more like 6, but I guess it depends on size and personal preference. Only had room in the pot for 3 shanks, but there are only two of us... Later in the week, I heated the remaining shank, stripped the meat off and shredded it. I served this with chopped lettuce, tomato and onions on pita with Lobbylady's Tzatziki sauce! Awesome!

This dish was fabulous, I didn't change a thing.  The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender, and the lemon and balsamic gave it a great tang. I am definitely serving this next time my in-laws are down, you pop it in the oven and forget about it until done.

I made this recipe to scale, but only added 1 lemon quartered.  I found with even this the oil from the peel gave the dish a bitter after-taste.  I would either peel the lemon or omit it altogether.  After 3 hours meat was very tender and fell off the bone, but couldn't overcome the lemon-oil after-taste,

I'm sorry but even with half the balsamic vinegar, 2 tablespoon brown sugar, and one lemon I thought liquid was too sour.  The meat was delicious.  I like that this recipe does not require browning the shanks in oil before baking.  I grilled the meet on the bbq for about 8 minutes to burn off some fat and get that smoked flavor.  Next time I will omit the lemons and vinegar altogether and just use red wine.  Thank you.

Hmm this recipe was tucked in the back of my recipe binder. My husband made this 'as written' foe mothers day of 09'. I thought the wine/lemon/balsamic needed to be toned down a-whole-lot and balance it with brown sugar or pair it with a slight sweeter side dish.

This recipe works even if you don't have the balsamic vinegar and basil. You just might want to tone down the amount of vinegar if you use a different kind. I also used Lamb Shoulder Steaks instead of Lamb Shanks and it still turned out excellent in my book.

As a side dish I just boiled up some celery, carrots, and red peppers with a little garlic, salt, and black pepper. According to the rest of the household everything turned out well. They think that I put a bit too much black pepper in with the vegetables. Something along the lines of it being too hot.

Fabulous!  Considering this is sooooo easy to prepare, with no pre-browning of the lamb required, I was amazed how savory and unique and absolutely delicious this was.  Have made it for guests and everyone asks where I got the recipe!

Didn't have four shanks so I halved the liquid and it was too vinegar-y!  I like balsamic vinegar but this was completely over-powering. With the wine you probably only need to add a shot of vinegar for flavour.

Easy and delicious!  I actually forgot the olive oil completely and since they turned out so tasty, I don't know that I would even add it in the future or at least I would reduce it to a couple tablespoons to save on some fat and calories.  The meat provides enough fat on its own as it braises.  Also, I had never made lamb shank before, so I looked up how to trim them before cooking and I think the best method is to leave the membrane on the shanks as they cook....trim the fat only.  Without the membrane, all the meat will fall off the bone which makes serving a bit difficult.

This is awesome!  Used merlot and then drank the rest with dinner.  The only negative is that I don't have a Dutch over so used my Pyrex casserole dish.  The lid is soaking and hopefully will recover from the burnt on sauce. But will definitely make again.

I agree that this is a great recipe for non-lamb lovers.  It made a believer out of me.  I tweaked it a little since I didn't have some of the ingredients but had to make it for my husbands birthday meal since he loves lamb.  I only added 1/4 cup of vinegar but probably could have omitted it altogether since I also added capers! Also I only had a half a yellow onion so I added green onions with it.  Left out the lemon completely and spread minced garlic over the shanks, and added 2 more cloves of roughly chopped garlic to sauce.  Used a good sweet red Zin and ONE 14oz. can of stewed Italian tomatoes I chopped in smaller pieces, which was plenty. Sprinkled dry basil on top and would leave out the oil next time as there was plenty of fat from the lamb. I also added some peeled potato pieces to thicken and absorb the sauce during cooking. After dinner, I couldn't stop picking at it!  The sauce was so tasty.  Next time I will add mushrooms too.  It smelled like lamb, but didn't taste like it.  I will make this again for my husband and will enjoy it with him.

I made recipe exactly as written and while the meat was certainly tender, the sauce was overpowering, the lemon rinds an unpleasant surprise and there was an overwhelming amount of collected grease. The method is worth experimenting with, but these ingredients in these amounts did not culminate in a pleasing dish.

I made this with chevon (goat) shanks, which are a lot like lamb. Very tasty! The meat was tender and the tangy flavor is great with mild-tasting meat like lamb or goat. I did reduce the balsamic vinegar by half, and it was still tangy and tender.

Absolutely delicious!  I had never cooked lamb shanks before and chose this recipe because it contained ingredients I already had in my cupboard.  I took the advice of others and used only half the balsamic vinegar.  My husband has already requested this recipe again.

This was so easy and so good!!!  I had to modify it a little because I was cooking 2 shanks and, I read earlier reviews and reduced the amount of vinegar by half.  Because I didn't have orange zest or red wine, I used grapefruit zest and chicken broth. Also, it was ready in 2.5 hours (I used my thermometer to make sure it didn't overcook).  I will definitely use this recipe again!

I strongly recommend adding brussel sprouts for the last 20 to 30 minutes; their sweetness was an excellent counter point to the sour sauce. I made a 1/2 recipe with shank pieces; at 2 1/2 hours, most of the meat had fallen off the bone, so I removed it and left bones in sauce for the sprout cooking.  Served with polenta. Easy and excellent.

Made this twice now.  We used sweet red wine the second time and it came out better, much more rounded.  Almost like an Italian sweet and sour with the balsamic and lemon.  Also put in some fresh rosemary, it grows in our yard and goes with everything in this dish.  The shanks come out with almost a BBQ like bark on top, and fall apart into moist tender deliciousness.

I can't speak highly enough of this. What a nice change from mint jelly or rosemary! Everyone at the table loved it, even those who were not (previously) lamb fans. I did cut down the vinegar a bit per other reviewer's recommendations. This has already been requested for hunting season with venison, and I know that it will be a big hit.

This was good. I used fresh tomatoes from my garden instead of canned. I didn't have lemon so I added a small amount of lemon juice. Only complaint I have is I think Im not a fan of lamb shank. Ive bought lamb blades at the store before and I prefer those instead. Will make this again with lamb blades.

I made this recipe last night, the lamb was definently tender but I thought the quantity of wine, oil, and balsalmic vinger was a bit too much! It gave a bitter tasting sauce. Other than that it was ok.

A really tasty recipe - my husband and I prepared this together. We did halve the balsamic vinegar as others suggested, and used diced tomatoes with herbs and spices - it's all we had in the cupboard. The meat was tender and fell off the bone. We served it with cous cous (cooked in chicken broth and then added chopped tomatoes, green onions, 1 clove of garlic, and 1 tbsp. each of olive oil, fresh parsley and lemon juice). Yummy!

We just tried this dish and it was fabulous. I had read other reviews halving the basalmic vinegar and that was perfect! Having lots of different cuts of lamb in our freezer,we used spareribs. I also used fresh Roma tomatoes instead of canned, we did half the recipe so used 4 tomatoes.Great dish! Can't wait to try it with a shank!

First time preparing lamb shanks and decided to do it for Valentine's Day dinner for my hubby.  I put in the oven for 3hrs and around about the end of the 1st hour the aroma that was coming from the kitchen was unbelievable.  Hubby thought he was at a 5star restaurant.  He now wants this dish at least once a month, I don't mind cause it's so simple to prepare.  Thank you Mrs. Savage.

Based on the other reviewers' advice, I only used 1/2 of the balsamic vinegar.  The resulting flavor was PERFECT!!  The lamb was so tender and juicy, and the sauce goes great on top of mashed potatoes  :) .  Just keep an eye on the lamb while it is baking so you don't overcook it, mine was done in 2.5 hours, not 3.

Delish! Love the flavor. Adding a bit more brown sugar, or cutting down on the vinegar really does the trick.  Too bad Lamb Shanks are not always readily available in my area.

I think next time I might not use quite as much balsamic. I found it a little acidic. Also, I had to use leg of lamb cut into shank sized chunks because I couldn’t find shanks and there was a little more fat so I probably could have used less olive oil. Overall though it was very flavourful and I’d make it again.

Excellent dish.  I had 6 shanks, four of them I put in a crock pot and two I did in the oven.  I did have trouble with to much liquid  in the crock pot as it was really full but both dishes turned out beautifully.  Very tender.   I did use a bit of corn starch to thicken up the sauce for the crock pot ones.  My company raved about them and I’ll definitely use this recipe again.

I made the recipe as written. The Lamb was cooked perfectly, but was inedible. Too much acid for anyone in my household or guest's taste. I wasted all that time and money to order a pizza for company. I tried in vain to Doctor the Lamb, it all went into the trash.

Made this.  It did not need the vinegar, should have listed to others and cut way back on it.

Otherwise it was OK, meat was tender.

This was really delicious. I'm very grateful for all the reviews as I did reduce the balsamic vinegar and I did add a half teaspoon of brown sugar, both of which added greatly to the flavour. I will definitely make this again

More please! I followed the advice of previous reviews and added 1 Tb. Brown sugar and omitted the Lemmon, I cut the balsamic vinegar to 3/4 cup. I served it with polenta and mixed greens.

I halved the lemon and balsamic vinegar, we still thought it tasted too "lemony" and acidic. Next time, I will try without the lemon and but will keep half the vinegar. Other than that, it is delicious. I added some green pepper and carrots to the dish and served it with roasted red potatoes and brussell sprouts, everybody loved it.

The taste of this was better than I thought it would be. I am also going to try with beef short ribs.

made it for romantic christmas dinner for two, but neither of us cared for it at all. pretty presentation but im not sure if lamb is our thing. if you like lamb, its probably good. i took advice of others and cut vinegar in half, and i also left out lemons. sauce was still kinda sour - i should've added brown sugar like some other reviewers suggested.

used 6 small as pieces of lamb. once i added the rest of the stuff the lamb got lost in it all and i ended up having 3 bites of lamb and the rest was a half full plate of some sour as tomato tasting thing which we didnt eat. but my guests still at it and acted full so im happy. 5 stars for this one

My first time cooking lamb and it was very easy and delicious. I left it in the oven for almost 4 hours and the meat just fell off the bones. The sauce seemed little thin to me. Otherwise a great recipe. Thanks!

This was excellent!  I used 1/2 the balsamic and added a bit of brown sugar, otherwise left the recipe as-is.  The best I've ever had.  Used a favorite red zin wine - made all the difference!  Very easy.
