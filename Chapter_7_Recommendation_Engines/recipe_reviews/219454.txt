Yummo!!! Rather than a tenderloin, I couldn't pass up a pork loin (the ones wrapped in a netting of sorts) and it turned out great. Really tender and flavorful. I did baste it with juices/sauce a few times and flipped it a couple times in the last hour. I also probably cooked it longer figuring it was in a slow cooker so... I also took a tip from the original recipe and removed the meat to rest before cutting, mixed a little cornstarch and water and added it to the juices to make a gravy. I am not a gravy eater but my hubby loved it. I will definitely make this one again!

Yummy and healthier than the other version!  I have been making my own dry soup mix for years to reduce the sodium.  This is tender and so easy to prepare.  Great dish for those days that are too hot to turn on the oven.

This was incredibly tender, but had almost no flavor. It was nearly as bland as baby food and no one in my house would eat it. I ate leftovers by myself for a week with a variety of sauces to give it some flavor.

I tried it & so did 14 other people. I also used a pork loin (3 lbs.) I used 1/4 Raspberry Balsamic Vinegar (omitting the red wine)1/2 lg. sliced onion, 31/2 Tb. Low sodium Soy Sauce., 1/4 cup sugar & the rest of the ingredients. Cooked on high 5 hrs. Left it over night on warm in the crock pot & had it for lunch. Delish!!

Great recipe to use as a base! I would suggest adding spices to it, like thyme and rosemary or cayenne pepper. It is sooo tender and aromatic but a little bland. I will definitely make it again and play around with the flavor!

The pork was nice & tender but we weren't too sold on it. I think it was because it didn't go well with my side dish.

Cooked just as instructed.  So-so.  Meat was greyish, perhaps should have braised it first?  Won't make again.

This is great! Easy to make with great flavor. If someone complained that it was bland, then they didn't make the same recipe I did. I have already added this to my favorites and plan on making it again :)

So easy and delicious! I seasoned my tenderloin first. Maybe that would help the person who found it bland. I made a gravy for it by mixing 2T cornstarch and 1/4 cup cold water. I removed the meat, then slowly poured the cornstarch mixture into the juice while stirring. I turned the setting to high for a 1/2 hour. Thank you for the great recipe!

Wow, so good. I had a 3 1/2 lb roast so I improvised a bit. 1 full onion, 1/4 cup catsup and a cup of charro beans in the bottom. Season roast with herb and garlic salt liberally.  Place roast fat side up. Pour 5 Tbl soy and 1 cup merlot over the top.  Spread 3/4 cup catsup and two Tbs. chopped garlic on top with ground pepper and all seasoning. Cooked on High for one hour basted. Cooked on low next 2 1/2 hour basting on the hour. Then turned and turned off. Stabbed with knife several places, basted, sprinkled with a bit of meat tenderizer, 45 min turned, stabbed, basted and sprinkled with tenderizer again. Let sit until almost cool broth. Turned on keep warm and OMG best pork I have ever cooked. Will do this over and over.

The meat was tender, but it was rather bland for us. The au jus was tasty though. I made brown rice and steamed broccoli for sides. We used the au jus over the rice and pork. I made the recipe as stated. I'm not sure if I would try making it again. Perhaps searing the seasoned tenderloin first would help, or turning the tenderloin over a few times throughout cooking.

I made it last week for my husband and I the other night.  It was delicious!  Would not change a thing.  I used Chianti which was more robust than merlot and it really made it tasty.  I will be making it again this week with pork chops rather than the pork tenderloin.

I didn't find anything amazing about this recipe. It was only the 2nd slow-cooker recipe I've made, but it was disappointing. Not that much flavor, not that tender--I wouldn't make it again.

Nice and simple! For an even healthier recipe, substitute Bragg’s  Liquid Aminos for soy sauce.

this was very bland, even after adding fresh thyme and rosemary. the meat came out grey, not appealing to the eye at all. I think it just needs to be tweaked. It wasn't horrible, just had much higher expectations

Ehhh.  I never write negative reviews but I have to say we didn't like it that much to be completely upfront.  We followed it exactly and it was very bland.  The meat was tender but I would not really make this again.  It needs something else - spice might help.

We loved the flavor and didn't miss the beef bouillon from the onion soup mix. I followed the recipe. I gave it 4 stars because the meat was a little dry.  I also added 4 cut up potatoes. They were done at the same time as the roast.

I followed the recipe and I thought it was a little dry. It definitely is on the healthy side but needed a bit more seasoning. It did make good pulled pork sandwiches. Will try again using more spices.

I used a pork loin roast and it came out tender and juicy.  Instead of red wine I used a blackberry ginger balsamic vinegar, which added some flavor.  will definitely make this again.

Very good easy slow cooker recipe.   I used extra sliced onions and left it cook a little longer. The onions carmelized in the broth and tasted great.   Turned the pork a couple times and basted.

We loved this. I did follow some reviews and used sliced onion. I also had some boxed French onion soup which I used instead of the dry mix and water. I also added Worstershire sauce and more garlic. It was very flavorful and tender. Served with mashed potatoes. We had leftover open-faced sandwiches the next day. Even better!

This was amazing! I added cornstarch to the sauce and made a gravy. I also sauteed the onion and garlic before adding to the pot to give it more flavor.
I served this over rice with broccoli and it was awesome!
Next time I will add less soy sauce because it was very salty... but delicious! So tender!

I saw a lot of reviews claiming good but bland. That's a simple fix, season! Even when trying to be healthy seasonings are your friend. I added oregano, basil, onion powder, and rosemary. Gave it a subtle flavor that would be extremely needed as its solely cooking in liquids that won't give off enough flavor.

I added some quartered potatoes & carrots. This came out SO delicious; my fussy daughter loved it, too. Will be making this again & again.

Nice and easy to make but not much taste there. It mostly just tastes like its two primary ingredients; soy and garlic, combined into a simple, dark taste.

Really good.  Family loved it and I thickened it with a little arrowroot to keep it healthy.  Will definitely be making again.
