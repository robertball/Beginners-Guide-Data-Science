Nice weekend app.  I took other's advice and cooked the steak first.  Deglazed the pan and used the pan to saute the peppers and onions, getting last bits of the fond.  The "provolone whiz" was creamy and very tasty.  A couple of scallion bits might be a nice addition when I make this again.  Thank you.

Delish! Next time I make these I will do the steak portion first then leave it sit to cool and do the sauce and chopping. Added a bit more Cayenne then it called for,  it added more flavor and heat to the sauce. Love Chef John's recipes!

This is nothing like a REAL Philly cheesesteak.  Even as a 'mini' version, is doesn't resemble the real thing whatsoever.  I'm going to give it a try and come back to edit my review.  Maybe you should label it mini cheesesteak bites or something.  Us Philly people are very sensitive when it comes to our cheesesteaks!  I haven't had a good knock off yet.  We shall see Chef John! Lol

This was soooo good! I will definitely make this again, but some things to keep in mind - it took longer to prepare than I thought; cook the meat first, cheese second - it cools and is harder to spread; and more cheese is needed for sorinkling on top, I used an additional 1/2 cup of mozzarella and it tasted great!

Really good. This was a winner. I only baked it for about 8 mins or( until the cheese melted) so the bread remained soft.

This came out great with Italian bread. I then made it again a couple days later making it a pizza instead. This recipe is a definite keeper.

I adhere to the Blue Zones diet, which is 95% plant based. So I upped the veggies to 2.5 cups red and green bell peppers and 1.5 cups onions. Instead of skirt steak, I used two 6-inch chicken sausage links (which I grilled the day before and had leftover). I made sandwiches with toasted sourdough bread. They were really good. The ratio of veggies to meat to cheese to bread was perfect IMHO. I saved the leftover veggie/meat saute and the leftover cheese sauce. The second day I just toasted new bread, microwaved the leftovers and it tasted just as good as the first day. I'm not giving it 5 stars because it didn't knock my socks off, but it was a good solid meal. In fact my husband requested I add it to "the rotation".

Made as directed, used a smaller Italian loaf as baguette crusts are a little too crunchy for our tastes. Out of 3 dishes for the Super Bowl this was the favorite by far! Have never been disappointed with Chef John's recipes and the run continues! Thanks once again Chef!

This appetizer was DELICIOUS!!!  I doubled the recipe to bring to a party and they were devoured immediately!  This one is a keeper.  Can't wait to make it again.  Only change I made was I left out the nutmeg.

So fast, I made this in 20 minutes (Made bechamel on Sunday). Kids loved it I got one piece, the last piece, the smallest piece left. So good and easy. I used the precut beef from Lotte it was easy and perfect! (Also added mushrooms to my sons)  a huge hit... So thanks.

Took this novice home chef a long time to put this together :-) BUT it was delicious. Made it per the recipe, no changes. Everyone loved it. I had to make extra cheese sauce though. For some reason my batch just wasn't enough.

We make something very similar where I work.  Except they are put in wonton wrappers, deep fried and cut in half. As an appetizer, they go quickly.

Tasty.  More steps than I appreciate - cook onion and grn pepper, cook beef, cook cheese sauce, and then put together and bake.   Must have made mine enormous as I only got 12 out of the recipe.  But they were something different and quite tasty.

I'm glad I read the reviews first.
Based on the reviews I did steps 3,4, and 5 first,
and I used French bread instead of baguettes.
The appetizers were a hit!

Really good. I added more cheese ( to taste), I used 1/2 Milk and 1/2 heavy cream. Used a softer bread and I didn't cook as long just enough to get the cheese to melt.
Next time I going with my favorite cheese. you can do a lot with this recipe

These were a hit at Super Bowl VII, and apparently brought the Eagles luck !  Everyone raved about them. I almost doubled the amount of peppers and onions, and mixed red, orange, yellow & green peppers to make it more festive. It may not be an "original" recipe, but as long as everyone loves it, I'm OK with that. 

When I first read a 90 minute prep time, I thought that was too long. However, it did take me that amount of time (but maybe because I decided to add more veggies after the fact). I also did the steak first, transferred to a bowl, then sauteed the veggies in the drippings with some extra oil. I think it adds another layer of flavor to the veg.

I also used homemade baguette-style bread, which comes out a bit softer than traditional baguettes do, so the amount of crunch was perfect.

If I make these again, I'll add some minced garlic, because in my opinion, garlic makes everything better. But all in all, I'd make these again!

Very tasty but also a little too crunchy for my taste. I would've liked it better if the bread had remained a little softer.

My son didn't like at all, my hubby said it was ok.   The only thing I did was to bake on top of cooked rice instead of bread, since my hubby is allergic to yeast!
