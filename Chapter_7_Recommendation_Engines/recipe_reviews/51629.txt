This was a fantastic meal using leftover cooked ham, fresh asparagus, onions and portabella mushrooms. It is easy to make and the flavors blended together so well.  We definitely will have this again!

This recipe was a little bland for our tastes, in spite of all of the great ingredients.  Also, the pasta mixture was rather dry.  Maybe an addition of extra olive oil would help.  Probably won't make this one again.

This was good.I had to cook everything longer than I was expecting. I also added extra olive oil to the fettucine. More parmesan as well. It was eaten but not too many complements were handed out. Used up a lot of leftover Easter ham so that was a good thing.
