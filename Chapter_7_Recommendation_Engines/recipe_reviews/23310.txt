My concern with this recipe is not the taste. Now I will admit that I am in the "I Hate Marmite" camp. But I thought that it would work here and it did! But the 45 minute cooking time dried the chicken out. I tried the same recipe with bone-in chicken breasts and leg quarters and it was fantastic! But since the star rating is for the original recipe it has to be low as the chicken was too dry. Great flavour concept but cooking times are wrong.

This works well with some vegetarian chicken substitutes at a somewhat shorter cooking time. I find it helps to cover the dish for most of the baking time; things stay more moist that way. Even the pickiest eaters in my family cleaned their plates.
