Great recipe! I made three alternations. First, I added a little more milk as suggested by another reviewer so that the total amount was a little less than 3/4 c. It made it super easy to spread in the pan. Second, I substituted slivered almonds for the pecans. Third, I added 2 T almond extract to the batter...the house smelled wonderful as it cooked for about 50 minutes. Be sure to use fresh blueberries so you don't get the bleeding from frozen blueberries. Thankfully, they are in season now so 2 cups should cost about $2.50. Overally, a great recipe - one that I am sharing at a potluck tonight with friends.

This cake was so good, my husband loved it. I did add alittle more milk almost 3/4 cup. I added 1 tsp vanilla & 1/2 tsp almond extract. I cooked it on 350 for approx. 50 minutes, just keep checking it to make sure you do not overcook it. I used blueberries I had frozen as I pick lots each year. Do not unthaw the berries. I put on a papertowel to absorb the frost if there is some. I then mix them with 1-2 tbsp flour very gently. This really does make a difference when baking with frozen blueberries. I will make this cake from now on.  Debra

truly the best coffee cake I've ever made.  It recieved great raves from my bible study group.  I used frozen berries making the batter stiff and spreading in the pan a bit challenging butit did not affect the end result.  Spectacular!!

This coffee cake was wonderful!  I didnt add the pecans because I didnt have any on hand.  I also just baked it in a 9x9 greased pan.  It was beautiful when I took it out of the oven.  I am making it again for a friend today.  Delicious!!!!

thanks a ton, Donean!

as others suggested, added the 1/4 C milk and it worked simply and perfectly. (i also nixed the cinnamon in the streusel, just cause that seemed sorta outta sorts with blueberry to me)

just remember to try not to mix too much before incorporating the blueberries and to throw the batter into the pan directly afterwards so the berries don't have time to settle out

last variation i can attest to is using a tube pan and layering the streusel on top about 5 or 10 minutes before the cake was done, after the cake had set sufficiently so that i didn't deform it (unlike the first time). returning the cake to the oven for the last 5 or 10 minutes. then you need to do a bit of flipping to serve streusel-side-up, but it's pretty resilient stuff

Wonderful coffee cake with great topping!  I made one slight alteration by substiting 2 tsp. vanilla for an equivalent quantity of the milk.  I did notice that it took more like an hour to finish rather than 45 minutes, but that may just be my oven.

Highly recommended.

Great recipe!  This is a good-not too sweet(very moist at 350 for 42 minutes) cake with a crunchy topping and generous amount of  blueberries. Very pretty in my glass cake keeper(I like that it took a springform pan as it was pretty enough to serve to company) It was easy to make and dissappeared quickly even though I forgot to add the cinnamon.  I'm not sure I'll add it next time either!  My husband loved it with milk on it and I had a hard time keeping him away from it.  A keeper for sure!!

I made this for overnight guests to serve as breakfast.  They loved it!  Very simple to make and delicious.  It is not very sweet, which is great for my personal taste, but those who like it sweeter may want to add more sugar--either in the batter or topping.

TIPS TO MAKE SURE IT'S NOT DRY!!:  Definitely needs 3/4C of milk.  I trade up adding 1t vanilla and 1t almond extract. ...and it took me 50 min to bake, so use the tried and true toothpick method.  I only ever have fresh blueberries that I've frozen... and I just defrost in microwave (uh...using defrost feature ;) ) ...and then put a heaping T of flour over them to absorb the moisture.  I also can't imagine using ALL the topping.  Would make it sink.  I use half ...IF that.  Turns out wonder, moist, and oh so delicious that I almost hate having to share with my family ;)

This is a stupendous recipe!  (I'm eating it right now, it just came from the oven.) I love blueberrys, so this recipe hits the spot.  I altered the crumbly mixture, though, for lack of some ingredients: instead of brown sugar, I used white sugar; instead of cinnamon and pecans, I substituted crumbled-up Fig Newton Bars, 1/4 cup, and 1/4 cup crumbled-up raisin bread, in case it got to sweet.  It turned out excellent.  Thank you.

My husband rated this as a 4.5 - I didn't actually get to try it because he brought it to a work meeting.  I'm told it was very good...one person had three servings!  I added 1 tsp. of vanilla and increased the milk by almost a quarter cup, as others recommended.

This is delicious!  I made this as written with the exception of using buttermilk (I needed to use it up) instead of milk, and I also increased the amount to 3/4 cup as other reviewers suggested.  When combining the streusel topping, I cut the butter into the sugar/flour/cinnamon and once crumbly, then I added the pecans.  Much easier that way and the pecans don’t get in the way.  Ten minutes before my coffee cake was done, I did place a piece of foil over the top so it wouldn’t get overly browned.  Excellent recipe!

This deserves 10 stars!!! I kept on eating this till my stomach hurt!! That's how good it is!! If you love blueberries, you will love this! I did take the suggestion from some other reviewers who said to up the milk to almost 3/4 a cup.. I used a little more than 3/4. Also, I used walnuts in place of pecans since I didn't have any pecans. Still tasted good! It's important to use fresh blueberries since they won't bleed like frozen ones. And remember to FOLD in the blueberries, you don't want the blueberries to bleed in the cake batter before they even get baked!

Wonderful!  I followed a few reviewers suggestions in adding a dash of vanilla, doubling the topping (definitely a good choice - isn't the sinful topping really what makes this recipe so scrumptious??) and waiting until the cake had baked for 20 minutes BEFORE adding the topping.  That was a good recommendation as my topping came out perfect and beautiful and I'm certain it would have been burnt to a crisp if it had been in there for the entire time. I had rave reviews from the kids and other family members who had a slice of this yummy coffee cake!

Made this for Christmas morning breakfast - and it was fantastic! I did add a couple more tablespoons milk and a splash of vanilla, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It turned out just like the picture and tastes GREAT! The pecans give it just the right amount of chewiness, as the cake and blueberries are quite soft and luxurious. I used frozen blueberries, just barely defrosted, tossed in a couple tablespoons of flour, and they turned out perfectly. Definitely adding this one to my repertoire!

Found this pretty flat-tasting despite the addition of 2 tsp of vanilla. I took it to a neighbor's house for a coffee date and her first comment was, "Wow, this tastes healthy." Not what you want to hear! Maybe I did something wrong without realizing it. Thanks anyway, but I probably won't make it again.

I have made this recipe too many times to count over the years...probably at least 20 times with no changes to it at all.  Yes, the batter is like thick cement, but it has always worked for me with no additional milk.  I use frozen blueberries.  I do have to bake it slightly longer, but that might just be for me baking at a high altitude.  It is definitely one of our favorite coffee cake recipes with just the right amount of sweetness.

Fabulous! Loaded with blueberries. So yummy.  Use fresh blueberries, it is worth every penny.  Go with 3/4 cup milk and also add splash of almond extract as recommended by others.

Very good recipe.  I also added more milk since it was much too stiff a batter as written, didn't measure it exactly but perhaps 3/4C total.  Also added cinnamon & 2t vanilla as several suggested and used only 1/2C sugar since it doesn't need to be overly sweet.  Came out very tasty.  You can use anywhere from 1C-2C of blueberries depending on pesonal preference.  Baked it in a 9x9 glass baking dish which makes it easier to cut into square serving size pieces.  I would not recommend any type of round baking dish or springform pan.

Fabulous!  I baked in an 8x8 pan, which made it very thick, and I used no pecans.  Best blueberry coffee cake we've had - a re-do!

This is a very nice coffee cake, with lots of blueberries.  I've made the recipe a couple of times and have found that the nuts are nice but not necessary, and that the dough is quick thick (like soft cookie dough).  Throwing in a bit of cardamom is nice, as is a bit of lemon juice. Frozen berries are easier to mix into the cake, as they don't burst as easily.

I used the suggestions and added 3/4 cup of milk, 2 tsp of vanilla. To give it that something extra I also used the zest and juice of one lemon in the cake mixture. Once the cake cooled I made a lemon glaze. For the glaze use 2/3 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted, zest and juice of one lemon, and 1 tsp. of milk. Mix well and drizzle on top of the coffee cake. My family loved it!

Better than other blueberry coffee cakes on this site. Tried all three and this is the winner. My daughter's health teacher loved it so much that she made it for her school gathering.

Wonderful recipe! I made a few changes also, 3/4 cup milk like some others, made it easier to spread. I didn't have any fresh fruit either, but I had a bag of frozen mixed berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries) which I added to the batter, still frozen, and it was DELICIOUS! I also used chopped almonds in the topping as it was what I had on hand. Next time I'll put some almond extract in the batter as well. And finally, I made this and assembled it the night before, covered and refrigerated all night, and baked it in the morning. It worked perfectly! I just added about 10 extra minutes baking time to account for the coffee cake being chilly from the fridge. I also baked it in a stoneware deep dish pie plate which tend to take a bit longer anyway. I'm definitely making this again!!

Woderful!  Great texture, aroma and flavor.  A family favorite!  My only changes are to use 1/2 wheat flour (1 c white, 1 c wheat), to increase the milk up to 3/4 c as recommended by others, and the addition of both almond and vanilla extracts.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This cake was good; but no real WOW factor, or something I would make again without trying another recipe instead. The batter was super thick, and absolutely no way you could "pour" it into the pan.  I will keep looking...

WOW! So easy, so yummy. I can't believe I just ate a whole cake. I am going to make more and more and more. I used frozen blueberries (And a few raspberries too), and I don't know what a springform pan is so I just used a 9" round pan I have. Did I say YUM? YUM

I love this recipe! I will use the xtra milk this time. As for the topping-I use a bunt pan and put 1/2 in the bottom of the pan so it becomes a wonderful candied layer! Yum! and the other 1/2 on the top. Thanks for sharing this with us.

We all really enjoyed this! I did add more milk, at least 1/4 cup as the batter was not mixing well with the called for amount. I used 1 cup of fresh blueberries I'd frozen since that's what I had left and otherwise followed directions/ingredients. It has a nice density and a great flavor, I loved the topping. I would add the vanilla extract next time as others have recommended. Yummy! :)

This is a very tasty coffee cake which I served as a dessert with vanilla ice cream at a barbeque. I did add about 3/4 cup of milk, used frozen berries (took them right from the freezer and just folded them in, so they didn't bleed) and added almonds instead of the pecans. A definite make again - thanks for the recipe, Donean.

I made a healthier version,used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup white flour, added a few teaspoons each of flax seed snd wheat germ into the flour mixture and added at least 1/4 cup extra milk as suggested.  The cake came out great and my 3 daughters (ages 2, 5, &7) devoured it!

Very Good recipe! Easy to make and turns out wonderfully! I used frozen blueberrys that I purchased earlier this summer - still turned out great. Don't be tempted to add more blueberry's than what the recipe calls for, though....the recipe provides just the right ratio. This is a great ending to a nice brunch meal!

DELICIOUS!!! I made it for breakfast this morning and it was fantastic. I cut the recipe in half but used the normal amount of topping. Baked it for 30 min at 375 then turned the oven down to 350 and baked for 10 min more. Turned out perfect. Only one piece left (which won't last long!)

I read some of the reviews, and I did add 1/4 cup more milk; it was still pretty thick to spread into the pan.  Never thought I'd ever say this, but in the future, I think I'll cut the blueberries back a bit, maybe by 1/4 cup.  I loved the moistness of the fresh blueberries and the way they just pop in your mouth, but there were almost too many blueberries.  This is a cake, and I would have liked a little more of that (hope that makes sense).   But don't get me wrong, we enjoyed this coffee cake.

I've been baking for my husband throughout our 20 year marriage.  He says this is the best thing I have ever baked.  Used toasted walnuts instead of pecans and added about 1/2 cup oatmeal to crumb topping to give it more substance. Lasts for a week if you keep in fridge; just pop in microwave for 15 seconds before eating.

This is my go to recipe!  I usually make it with cranberries. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because,like most of the reviews said, I changed it a little. I add more milk, 3/4 cup. I also add the almond extract, usually 1tsp almond and 1 tsp vanilla. This is always super fluffy and gone by the end of the day!

I baked this cake using gluten-free flour that I've made.  I also substituted milk with soymilk as I cannot drink regular milk.
The result was AMAZING..... it's not too sweet but just perfectly sweet.  Texture is soft in the inside and crunchy on the outside and just great.  My husband is not into bake goods yet he loved it!  I will be making this cake over and over again!  Thank you!!!

50 minutes and its still not cooked in the centre. Made cookies earlier today so I know the oven is working. Oven temp is at 375, I'm not sure what the problem is.

Wow, this cake was excellent.  I tripled the recipe, baked in a sheet cake pan, to bring it to church in the morning. Will be making this cake often for we have our own blueberry bushes, but I used the ones I had frozen and added them in frozen.  Was very thick and with the frozen berries, it made it even thicker.  But managed to spread it out ok.
Thanks for sharing Donean

This is a great recipe!  I made it exactly as written.  Was afraid the batter was too thick , but it came out great!  I used a 9 inch square pan and it worked fine.  Everyone loved it.

Very good.  I did not put on the strusel topping and it was still very good.  The only issue I had with this recipe is that it stuck to the pan even after spraying and flouring but the taste was still excellent.

Yum! I was out of white sugar, so I subbed in brown sugar (same amount), and it still came out beautifully. I usually hesitate making coffee cakes because they are often dry ~ not so with this one! Will definitely be using this recipe again...thanks!

Awesome recipe! Cake just came out fresh from the oven, and it came out perfect! I made a few alterations, however. Added more milk, along with cinnamon, vanilla, and almonds. I also baked it in my muffin tin, so it was a lot faster to bake and was ready in less than 20 minutes. Overall, the blueberry coffee cake muffins were delicious & the recipe was very easy to follow!

I made this last night and we had it at breakfast this morning. My husband and daughter agreed that it was the perfect coffee cake. I added about 2 T. more milk then what the recipe called for and I baked it for 10 minutes longer at 375 and it came out moist and flavorful. We'll hang onto this recipe.

This is the second time i've made a coffe cake and it came out delicious and so easy to make the only changes I made was to use light sour cream in lieu of regular and a little more milk to the batter to spread it more easily.Thank you for sumitting this your delicious recipe.

I was running out of regular milk but had buttermilk I could spare so I used that instead but because it's thicker I added almost 1/3 cup more instead of the recommended 1/4 of regular milk.  I didn't have pecans but had ground pecans so used that instead.  Turned out awesome!!!  I will definately make this again and I'd even use the buttermilk again instead of regular milk as well it was so good and moist.

This cake was very tasty.  The first time I made the mistake of using baking soda instead of baking powder... bad results!  The second time I made this, I got it right and the results were terrific.  I used fresh blueberries, and I increased the milk slightly to make the batter more managable as it was very thick.  The addition didn't have an effect on the final product.  I will try this without the nuts, since my family doesn't care for the pecans.  This can be made in a springform pan or regular pan with great results.  I'll definately make this again.

Very nice. This looks lovely and tastes just as good. Just the right size. I will try it next time with apples tossed in sugar and cinnamon. I gave it four stars because I may play around with the crumbs - not loving the nuts.

Very easy and so delicious.  I used frozen blueberries and was concerned about the cake looking gray-blue due to a little bleeding, but it was fine. I may try this recipe with peaches next. Thanks!

I was looking for a simple recipe to use all the fresh blueberries I had sitting in my fridge. I almost decided on that Blueberry Buckle stuff except when I went to read all the "five-star" reviews I saw that everyone had their two cents...less flour..more flour..less baking soda...not enough sugar...ETCETCETC. I ended up trying this one...made NO changes...and it was wonderful. Great pecan cinnamon topping that really just sets it off. And it's sooooo easy! I too made it in a round 9" cake pan. The whole family loved it. Thanks Donean!

I made this for the girls at work and it was a hit. The pecan topping was wonderful! It made the house smell great. However I ended up adding 1/4 cup more milk. After adding the blueberries the batter really thickened, almost like a paste. I added the milk and because I had to put it thru the mixer again it did burst open some berries (I use fresh frozen)It still baked up nicely. Thanks!!

Very good! I used 3/4 C. milk, no nuts. I read the recipe wrong and used BOTH the white and brown sugars in the batter (maybe why it took a lot of extra baking time?). I pulled it out with the center not fully done, but that’s ok; it was moist & delicious!

A bit bland and under-sweet, to my taste. The older folks I shared it with liked it a lot and requested the recipe. These are the changes I made: (1) Added 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 t nutmeg, ~1/4 t cloves, and ~1/4 t ginger to batter. (2) Increased milk to 3/4 cup and soured with 1T vinegar before adding to batter. (3) Subbed slivered almonds for pecans and added poppy seeds to topping. (4) Used whole wheat flour throughout. (5) Used brown sugar throughout. (6) Used 1T cornstarch dissolved in 3T water in place of the 1 egg. I think I pulled it out after 45 minutes.

With the other evaluations, I also added more liquid as it seemed pretty solid, but had some sour cream that needed to be used, so added that to the milk.  I used a lime zest and juice in place of vanilla, but otherwise, followed the recipe.  It is terrific.  Only 4 stars because of the changes I made, but I will make this again and again.  Thanks for a great addition to my recipe box.  ******Update.  The sour cream didn't help, but made the cake very dense.  We ate it, and for the most part it was very good.******

This is wonderful!!  The only change to recipe I made was using the extra 1/4 cup milk as suggested, which I don’t think I needed to do really. I’ll try to post a picture...wish me luck.

I have made this recipe several times. Everyone loves it. This last time I didn’t have enough milk so I threw in some half and half to obtain the needed quantity. My family thought the cake was creamer tasting. Rave reviews again.

I added a little extra milk (actually cream) because the batter was really thick. Everyone loved this! I’d definitely make it again.

Wonderful! Added apple instead of blueberries and it was still perfect. I see how an added 1/4 cup of milk will make it more moist but coffee cake is meant to have some dryness to it... served best with coffee ;)

Made this for a church function. It was a hit. I wasn’t able to taste it but according to everyone, it was amazing. I suggest to also add more milk. Closer to 1 cup.

This was great. I added extra streusel. Everyone who tasted it loved it. I also adapted it as muffins (shorter baking time, needed ever more streusel to cover so many muffin tops)  and the same thing...beloved by all. This recipe is a keeper.

Delicious!! I followed everything to a tee and it came out moist inside and crispy on top. I’ll be adding this to my rotation of favorites. Next time I may add some cocoa powder to the crumble to make it more decadent.

Proportions are spot on! Very delicious as is, although I did add some vanilla bean paste because I love that extra flavor. The texture is perfect and the amount of blueberries is what I love about this recipe. Blueberry in every bite!

This was good, but I should have went with my instincts and used a lower temp 350degF and cook for a longer time. When tested at the 375deg temp, mine was ready at 30 min, and my oven is just several years old. It seemed dry to me and the texture was more cake-like, but the flavor was good. I did add 1/2 tsp of almond flavoring and used some of the flour mixture to coat the blueberries with and made in a 9x9 pan. If you use a recipe with sour cream in it, I believe you get a completely different texture.

Delicious! The husband isn’t fond of baked goods and he had 3 pieces. I also increased the liquid to 3/4 cup and used 1/2 cup buttermilk with 1/4 cup milk (the reaction between the buttermilk and baking powder gives you more rise and buttermilk helps make baked goods moister). If you have too much streusel topping, freeze half and use it next time. Saves you time by not having to make it!!

This is a decent blueberry cake.  To die for blueberry muffins & lemon blueberry bread were much better .  Don't think I would make this one again because it was just okay.

It was ok but I too found it to be a little lacking in flavor. I was confused by why we needed to use so much flour when all of it wasn’t going to be used? And I too found that it needed more milk.

I debated giving this five stars because of the delicious taste but I did have a few issues with the recipe so I could only give four. I had to add more milk to make it work. I didn’t measure but probably added another 1/4 Cup. I also added about a tsp of vanilla extract. I cooked it for 50 minutes and it probably should have stayed in for a few more minutes. However I baked it in an 8 X 8 Pyrex dish so it may have been deeper than it would have been in a springform pan. I made this for a family dinner and everyone raved about it. I will definitely make it again.

This is a good dense coffee cake. I used coconut sugar and added a little nutmeg to the topping. This is a nice way to use blueberries when in season.

This was amazing and my husband called it a "show stopper"! I added 3/4 C. milk to make it more spreadable as other reviewers mentioned. I also added 1 tsp almond ext. and 1 tsp vanilla ext. I used frozen blueberries and it cooked great! Will make this again for my church group!

Very good. Made it at Flathead with cherries. Made it again twice at home with blueberries.  Every time I added about 1 cup of milk instead of 1/2 so it wasn't so thick.  When I cooked in a 8x12 I didn't have enough topping to go around so I would have had to double it but the height of the cake was appropriate. When I cooked in a smaller pan the topping was the right amount but the cake was really tall.

Modifications: I used 2 c of Kodiak Pancake mix instead of flour, and baking soda.  The batter was really thick and I used a 9x9 square pan. It should only need about 35 min instead of 40 min. Turned out really good.

I love this recipe!  I shortened the instructions by mixing all the wet ingredients in one bowl and all the dry ingredients in another bowl. Then dumped the dry into the wet and stirred till moistened. Then folded in the blueberries. I have also substituted almonds for the pecans. This is an easy recipe that always turns out great!

I changed it up to make it Low Cal and Diabetic Friendly!!Made this coffee cake today with some variations for a diabetic! I wanted to serve it to our friends tonight and both he and I are diabetic. So I exchanged the white sugar for white sugar Splenda, and the brown sugar for Brown sugar Splenda. I did have to increase the milk as suggested in other reviews. Everyone really liked it, and I didn't have to feel so guilty eating it!

I loved it!  I made it like the directions said except I had a few blueberries left over so I put them on top of the cake along with other topping ingredients.  It was wonderful.  So easy to get out of springform pan.  Batter was stiff when putting it in the pan but blueberries stayed in place nicely.

It came out beautifully and tasted delicious. I made one change. I added about 2 tablespoons more liquid and I changed the liquid from milk to buttermilk. 
I will make this again for company. It is best warm from the oven.

Deeeelicious!!!  After reading the reviews, I added 2 tsp vanilla and increased the milk to 3/4 cup (or slightly more) which did make folding in those blueberries easier. Such a nice mix of delicate cake, moist blueberries, and crunchy, buttery topping. YUM! You won't regret making this one. :)

Excellent! Made in a spring form pan for beautiful presentation. Used recommendations from other reviews to do almost 3/4 cup milk and did one and a half serving of the crumble for the top. Will make again and again!

First time I made this was for Christmas. I was concerned by the stiffness of the batter- it's like a cookie dough, but I had a lot of dishes and if this didn't turn out it was Ok. It turned out beautifully!! I received raves and I've made it a few times since...it's a family favorite! I have stuck to the recipe as written and it does not disappoint.

Turned out well, despite having misread the recipe. I also added 1tsp vanilla and 3/4 milk, per other users' suggestions. However, I accidentally added the brown sugar into the cake mix. Didn't realize until it was too late that it was meant for the topping. So I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the top. We all enjoyed it!

Just made this coffee cake and it is soooo good!  I made some adjustments based on suggestions other reviewers provided including increasing the milk to 3/4 cup, adding 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract and covered the pan after 30 minutes to ensure the top didn't get too brown (used a 9" pan and cooking time was 43 minutes).  I always cut white sugar so decreased it to 1/2 cup and always use fresh blueberries.  Make this coffee cake--it's easy and delicious.

Changed milk to 3/4 instead of 1/2 because it was way to dry to spread, and added 1 teaspoon of almond extract.  This was gone in minutes!  Next time I'll double it.

I also added more milk. The batter was very thick. Also instead of 2 cups of white flour I use 1 cup of wheat flour and 1 cup of white. I found it to be moist, sweet AND healthy!!

I am a novice baker. This is my third time making this with fresh fruit. First time I followed the suggestions of others and added a bit more milk & vanilla. Turned out great! Second time I did the same but used crushed almonds and it was way better than using pecans! It was super delicious. Third time, I kept the xtra milk and vanilla in the recipe as before and added lemon zest from one large lemon to the mix and 1/2 fresh juice of a lemon to the wet ingredients. I also used fresh blueberries, blackberries and raspberries, no nuts on the topping. Will keep making this as the options are great and easy to follow recipe.

Really bland & kind of dry.   I used the recommendations of 3/4 C of milk, and a Tsp each of vanilla & almond extract.   The only tasty part of the cake was the blueberries.

I added 1/4 cup milk, 1 teaspoon each of vanilla and almond extracts, as other people had recommended.  I also coated the blueberries in abut 1 Tablespoon of flour before I folded in so that they would be better  distributed.

I'm not a huge fan of blueberries, but my husband thinks there the best fruit to bake with. After making this I can't really argue with his opinion. I did make a couple of changes. First, I used Half n Half (didn't have milk). Second, after baking for 45 mins the center was a little bit raw, so I turned off the oven but left the cake in for another 10 mins and it  came out moist and delicious !! I will be making this several times a year. Yes, even with blueberries.. Lol

I used 2 cups of frozen berries, added 2 tsp of vanilla extract and then just added flour at the end to get the right consistency because of the extra fluid. Otherwise, kept the recipe the same and it was quickly eaten.

Made this for breakfast and it was really tasty. I added 1 tsp Vanilla and in total about 3/4 c milk like other reviewers suggested. This isn't super sweet, it's just the right amount of sweet/cakey for me.  Will definitely make again.

This turned out pretty good, and I would definitely make it again, but I used a couple of suggestions from other reviews that I think helped a lot. I used 3/4 c. milk and added about a teaspoon each of vanilla and almond extracts. The almond extract really helped and gave it just that little extra something. I also used cake flour instead of all purpose, and it turned out really moist and fluffy. I didn't add pecans to the topping, so it only turned out to be a little more than necessary, but it got nice and crunchy and the whole thing baked pretty perfectly after 40 min at 400 deg.

I increased the milk to just over a cup to make it easier to put in the springform pan so I had to cook it longer. I lowered the temperature after 45 minutes to 325 degrees. Also, I used 1 cup of chopped pecans in the topping and it was really good!

This is one of the best recipes for coffee cake i have found. When I made the dough, it was very very thick, as in I couldnt "pour" it in the pan, but rather i spread it out the best I could . Turns out this was just perfect and im glad i didnt change a thing. Only change I did make was i used half a cup of oatmeal instead of the nuts, only because i didnt have any nuts on hand. The result was amazing!

I have made this recipe many, many times! I add the additional milk. I have also added the almond extract along with the Vanilla. Lemon also tastes good in this recipe. I have also switched out the flour, to make these Gluten free. I follow the recipe just switch out the all purpose flour for a gluten free blend. I have used (bobs red mill) I have Also used The Trim Healthy mama Baking blend. Both Are GREAT with this recipe! The Trim healthy mama blend was a little crumbly. But the taste was great. When using the THM baking blend, I also subbed the sugar for a stevia blend and the milk for unsweetened almond milk.  TWO THUMBS UP! A very good recipe.

I love this coffee cake. My mom made something very similar to this with the cinnamon crumble on top and my love of blueberries only added to this morning coffee cake. I've always used more cinnamon than it calls for ( I don't measure everything) and we all enjoy this.

I was worried at first because my batter looked a lot more like dough, but it was ok thank goodness. Also, I put frozen blueberries in it and they worked perfectly.

I made this yesterday exactly as written (there's nothing I hate more when people make a thousand changes and then a good review?? Doesn't make sense). It was wonderful!!! The only thing is that you definitely can't pour the batter which worried me because it ended up being more of a dough that I had to spread in the pan. It was still delicious!!! My whole family loved it.

We don't eat eggs so and I wanted to make this recipe healthier.  I used whole wheat flour instead of white for the batter, 3/4 milk as suggested by others, only 1/2 cup sugar, added 1 tsp vanilla, and 1/3 cup sour cream.  In place of egg, used 1/3 cup additional milk (you can used any kind of milk) and 1 tsp baking soda.  Added 1 tbsp. ground flaxseed.  After reading reviews, used 9x13 inch pan greased and floured but just added 2 c blueberries on the top after spreading batter out (they stayed on top through baking).  Baked at 375 for 20 minutes, then added topping (had to add another tbsp. white flour and added 1/2 cup oats because we like more crumble in our toppings)and baked for 15 more minutes.  Cake was a little dry, would prob just add some water to batter next time but tasty and (almost) guilt-free!  Thanks for the foundation!

I made this for my boyfriend and his family. It was all gone by the end of the night. The only thing I recommend is to add in a cup of milk instead of a half cup. Also I recommend fresh blueberries only. Outstanding!

Other than adding milk and extra things for taste mine turned out a soupy mess that spilled through the bottom of my tightly strapped spring pan and burned on the floor of my oven. I checked the recipe to see what mistake I made and I've done exactly what was said.

This recipe was good not great.  I followed the recipe as is.  The batter by no means poured, it was to thick.  The topping was to wet.  It was not dry and crumbly like the picture.

I thought this was a great recipe!  I was expecting it to be dry, like most of the coffee cakes I've tried, but it was dense, moist, and decadent.  The streusel on top was an amazing touch, and despite my common-coffee-cake expectations, it was NOT the sole location of flavor; the whole cake was amazing!  The only change I made was adding extra blueberries, because I'm not a level-cup kinda gal. :)

I made just a few changes, substituting the milk with 3/4 C buttermilk, reducing to 1 C blueberries, and adding 1/2 C mini chocolate chips. The buttermilk gave the blueberries the extra tang they needed and because I reduced the berries due to the chocolate addition, the cake remained moist without changing the texture.

I made this for my daughter who is home sick today...she loves blueberries.  I followed the recipe with a few exceptions.  I added a half cup of sour cream (rather than increasing the milk).  I added some vanilla and some almond extract and increased the sugar by a few tablespoons.  Delish....
Thanks for the recipe and for all the suggestions.

Well, yum. Very easy and very forgiving recipe. I have an abundance of blueberries and am always baking or cooking something with them so I ran out of all purpose flour and had to use about  half whole wheat flour, Splenda instead of white sugar, 3/4 cup of buttermilk, and half regular brown sugar and half Splenda brown sugar. Added lots more cinnamon, too.  The batter was so thick I was concerned but the cake was very moist, juicy and held the topping well. I used some of the flour to coat the blueberries and baked in a foil wrapped spring form pan. Glad I wrapped the pan in foil because the berries oozed out a bit. Next time I would try lemon juice and zest in the cake.

This cake was a big hit at my house.  I added the extra milk upping it to 3/4 cup and added the tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of almond flavoring.  The batter was really thick and gooey but it cooked nicely.  My husband said make that again!

Ok, so this turned out delicious, aside from my own stupidity... I used a frozen berry mix (strawberries and blueberries) and added them to the batter before they had thawed... so the cake was in the oven for over an hour, finally passed the toothpick test, smelled awesome, beautifully golden brown on the outside... and magically completely raw on the inside :( My boyfriend and I are eating it regardless because it tastes amazing besides the doughy texture :) I also added the extra milk and almond extract modifications as suggested, and my apartment does smell incredible right now. NEXT TIME, I'll use fresh berries instead of frozen.. again, my mistake. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good coffee cake with wonderful topping. I used real butter and 2% milk. I also tossed in 1/2 cup of greek yogurt because people recommended more milk, and because I had it, double the pecans in the topping. I did not add or alter any other items and the result got high marks from the diners, though it was a little dry the second day. I appreciate a recipe that is "forgiving" and will make this just as described in future.

I baked it in a dark bundt pan at 325 for 43 minutes and it was just right. I followed the recipe exactly as is (for once!) and it turned out very yummy. Some people may want it a little sweeter but it was the perfect sweetness as a breakfast cake. I should've definitely added a little more milk to make it easier to add it to the pan. I layered some of the crumb mixture at the bottom, in between and some at the top of the cake batter. I didn't measure the blueberries but just used a small clamshell. I'd say it was very good but I'd still like to try out some more of the coffee cake recipes on this site.

Really easy, and I thought this was good.  Pretty basic; the topping really makes it, so if you want to skip it, you might need to add some more flavor to the dough itself.  I used frozen berries and didn't really bother to do anything with them; the only thing that changed was that they sunk a little but not too far to the bottom.  Pretty yummy even without the pecans, which I have but was too lazy to chop.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy! I took the suggestions of other reviewers - floured the berries before folding them in.  Added vanilla and added 1/4 cup more of milk and didn't use the cinnamon in the topping.  Two thumbs up!

This was really good!  It is great as breakfast or a dessert. It was very easy to throw together last minute. I did up the milk as suggested by earlier reviews to 3/4 cups. I did not use pecans since my family does not like nuts. In addition I cooked in a pie plate. I think it took longer to cook due to the additional milk and the frozen berries which I tossed in flour prior to incorporating. This recipe seems like it would be a good base to incorporate alternate fruits in as well. It may need a tad bit more sweetness in the bread itself but the topping does add a nice touch.

Made this cake as something to do with excess blueberries and now I'm about to buy more blueberries to make it again, I loved it so much.  I did use the extra 1/4 cup of milk and added a tsp of vanilla.

I made this recipe as written before I read the reviews.  It has a very thick batter and was hard to spread in the pan, so I was worried, but it is really delicious!  Turned out great with how the recipe is written.

I made this today with the 3/4 cup of milk that others suggested.  I also added 2 tsp of vanilla extract.  It was very good. Only thing I wasnt fond of was the streusel.  I found it came out a little to hard for my liking. I baked this in a bunt pan for 45 min. Next time I'll bake for 50.around the blueberries was a tiny bit under cooked. Will make again!

This was really great!! I added the extra milk that everyone seemed to say it needed and added a teas of vanilla. I used thawed out frozen berries..it was a mixture of strawberry, blueberry, raspberry, and blackberry....honestly I thought it tasted even better the next morning! Definitely give it a try.

I made this cake, baked the 45 min., and was too dry.  I made a blueberry sauce to pour over it to moisten it up.  I am in the process of making another one, and added the 3/4 C milk as suggested.  I checked it after 40 min., so now baking it another 10 min. as recommended by another reviewer.

This recipe needs the extra milk (1/4 c) or it will be too stiff to spread in the pain, but with the extra milk it is great!

good recipe! I added in an extra 1/4 cup goat yogurt. When adding  the frozen blueberry's  you should lightly coat them in flour first to prevent them from bleeding! My mom showed me that trick!

This was a really good coffee cake.  I took it out after 40ish minutes, as my toothpick came out with clean.  

The only modifications I made was to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a teaspoon of almond extract, and I took the advice of previous reviewers and added a bit more milk.  

You should definitely eat this while it is still warm, with a great cup of coffee.

Excellent coffee cake! I followed the other reviewers' suggestion and increased the milk to 3/4 cup. I also used white whole wheat flour (you read that right...it's whole wheat flour that is milled to bake just like white flour, but has all the nutrition of whole wheat).  I also added 3 TB buttermilk powder and 1/2 tsp almond extract (should have used at least a full tsp, but didn't want to overwhelm the blueberry flavor).

I have a small hand-cranked food processor that is perfect for making the streusel topping. I baked this in a glass 9X9 pan, and it turned out perfect in 45 minutes.

LOVE this recipe! I just made it for my husband and mother in-law and they loved it too. I added about 1/4 cup MORE milk because the batter was way too dry with just 1/2 cup milk.

I recommend this recipe! The strussel topping is delicious! :)

Blueberricious! I am glad I followed the advice of others and used 3/4 of a cup of milk. I also reduced the butter in the topping to 2 tbsp. instead of 3, which made the topping a bit more crumbly, but we loved it. Finally, because my husband doesn't classify aything as dessert unless it has chocolate, I added about 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips (we loved the chocolate!). I will definitely make this again!

amazing.  i made i for my a cappella group and they loved it.  The only thing: I used a 9 inch springboard pan but the streusel measurements didn't seem to be enough to cover the top so I ended up doubling the amount, using walnuts and pecans. I also baked it longer: around 55 minutes.

This recipe was fantastic! I added 2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extracts and 1/4 c milk. I also had to use frozen berries, took the tip of another reviewer and shook them with a little flour. The only problem I had was it took about 55 mins to bake and even though I waited 15 mins to add the topping it had started to burn by the time the cake was done. Next time I'll wait about 30 mins before adding the topping. So good, I can't stop eating it!! Thank you!

Fabulous! I've done it as a coffee cake and also as muffins. Rave reviews both ways. I've also tried it with chopped up strawberries instead of blueberries. My boss came back and asked for a second batch just for him!

So good! Instead of 2 cups AP flour, I used 3/4 cup wheat flour, and 1 1/4 cup AP flour. Instead of adding extra milk like many reviewers mentioned, I added a few dollops of fat free plain yogurt (sour cream would work too). This came out moist and delicious. The nuts on top are a must. Thanks for a wonderful recipe! Next time I may add a little more berries - they're just so good.

Absolutely delectable. I did substitute spelt flour for the AP flour to add more protein to the recipe. With the 1:1 ratio the 1/2c milk was just right (since spelt flour needs 25% less liquid).

This is a superb recipe. The texture of the cake was perfection. The fact that is made in a springform pan makes a beautiful presentation.  I used frozen wild bluberries. The trick to keep from having the bluberries make your batter "blue" is to fold them in GENTLY right before putting in the pan. I did this and it turned our picture perfect.  The topping on this had perfect ratios to give it a beautiful yet not soggy crumb topping. A KEEPER! Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I agree with others... a tad more milk and the recipe is wonderful. I overbaked mine a bit (didn't hear the timer!) so it was REALLY crunchy on top but still very moist and delicious inside.  Love a forgiving recipe!  Thanks.

Delicious recipe.  I used a convection oven, so mine was ready at the 40 minute mark.  Didn't use the full 2 cups of blueberries and it was fine with about 1 and 1/3 cups.  Did use other readers tip of extra 1/4 cup milk.  Worked great.

Really easy and tasty, but I baked it in a 9x9 pan for 45 minutes because I wanted the crisp on the top.  Very good.

This is truly a fantastic coffee cake and easy to make!  I make it whenever I have company come into town, and they always compliment me.  My family loves it, too.  Very most and flavorable.  This last time I used frozen blueberries, merely because of the cost of fresh, and it was absolutely wonderful.

My husband and I love this excellent coffeecake, but we're trying to eat less sugar and white flour. I substituted whole wheat flour for all of the white and used 1/4c white sugar mixed with 1t cinnamon for the topping. It still tastes great and has a nice texture.

I was looking for the perfect recipe to use my freshly picked wild Maine blueberries and I found it! The cake was so moist and yummy and easy to make. Next time I'm going to try it with blackberries.

I used canned blueberries and baked in a bundt pan.  Didn't use the pecans...but everything else as the recipe was written.  Good recipe.  The cake wasn't real sturdy.  It fell apart pretty easy but tasted very good.

Added more milk like other posters suggested and it turned out amazing. The cake was very soft and yummmmmmy! Will definitely make again. I only had a cup of blueberries, but it was plenty. Thanks for the recipe!

I had a pile of strawberries I needed to use up, so I made this into a strawberry coffee cake. I added a tsp. of vanilla and 1/2 tsp. of almond extract, and also the extra 1/4 cup of milk recommended by the other reviewers. I left out the cinnamon in the streusel, and used walnuts since that was what I had available. Almonds would probably also have been excellent.

Because I used up all the berries I had on hand, I ended up with about 3 cups of diced berries, which was probably too much moisture for the cake. I baked it in a glass 8x8 pan for 50 minutes, and it was still a little puddingy in the middle, but very done on the edges. But it is absolutely delicious! So next time I think I'll make sure to use fewer berries, but otherwise not change my method. It's a very nice cake!

The recipe was easy to make. I did add a little extra milk as suggested by others. My husband liked it, but said to add a little more milk or maybe I'll try some almond extract next time.

The cake was good, but will probably not make it again.  The Blueberry Buttermilk Coffeecake on this site was a tad better and easier to make.
The batter was too thick, I added milk to the thick batter.  It was not as moist as others I have made.  The gals I had over for coffee liked it.

Very Tasty!!!  It was simple too.  I may have messed up with my initial measurements, because it initially mixed to the consistency of biscuit dough.  I added another egg to soften it more, and it worked out just fine.  It got rave reviews from the office staff.  Like previous reviewers, I am keeping this recipe to use in the future, not just with blueberries, but with other types of fruit as well.

I love coffee cake so much and this is an easy recipe with simple ingredients.
I didn't have blueberries so I substituted strawberries instead and the results were amazing!  I loved the crumb topping too.  I will definately make this again for a family reunion next month.  Thanks

I made this for my family tonight, and we loved it. I substituted walnuts for the pecans, because we were out of pecans. The batter was very thick, which was nice because I did not have to worry about it leaking out of the springform pan, though it did make it harder to spread evenly. I had to use a rubber spatula to get it spread out. I also used frozen blueberries, simply because we had them on hand, and did not thaw them before adding them in. Worked perfectly. My family polished off 3/4 of this cake in 10 minutes. My younger brother said that it would be better without the blueberries, but this was as he was vaccuming down his third piece, so he can't have minded too much. Will defenetly make again!
