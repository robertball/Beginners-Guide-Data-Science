I added 2 individual drink packets (taste with 1 packet, may be tangy enough for your taste) of Hawaiian Punch Booberry Typhoon to the marshmallow creme mixture, along with some blue gel food color.  This was a kid favorite & I loved the sweet, tangy taste & the fresh fruit took it over the top - yum!
