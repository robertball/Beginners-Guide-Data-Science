The consistency of this smoothie is perfect, but it lacks flavor. I'd suggest another tablespoon or two of chocolate if that's what you're looking for, or an additional banana if its banana flavor you're hoping to achieve. Thanks for the idea Angie.

Awesome quick treat for the whole family! However, I omitted the ice and used a frozen banana instead to get the full flavor of the banana. The frozen banana kept it thick. We have made these using chocolate syrup and sometimes substituting the chocolate with strawberry syrup. Personally, I like to add a couple packets of Splenda to sweeten mine a bit. Definitely will be using this recipe ALL year round!

I need to eat bananas because of a pregnancy...and I don't like them at all.  I love the flavor, but its the texture that I can't handle.  This is a perfect way for me to eat these, without having to worrry about the texture of the fruit.  I did reduce the amount of milk and ice and added 1 scoop of vanilla ice cream...just because.  It turned out very good.  Thanks for the post.

Was good but not great. I would suggest more bananas and some kind of sweetener.

This is really good, I love chocolate and banana and this didn't give me too much of either, just a good mix of both.  I didn't have chocolate syrup so I used 3T of Nesquik powder.  Yummm!!!!!

You can make this one using healthyy ingredients and it tastes just as good.  I use 1 cup of unsweated almond milk, 1 banana, 2 TBS of cocoa powder, and a dash of stevia to taste.  You can also use some almond butter if you like.  It turns out great this way and it is healthy at the same time since there is no sugar besides the natural sugar in the banana.

This was very good, but I think it is probably 2 servings rather than just 1.  I used 8 ice cubes and added 2 packets of Splenda.  Next time, I will use 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 banana, 1 packet of Splenda, and the full amount of chocolate syrup called for.  ***The 2nd time I doubled the chocolate syrup and omitted the Splenda.  Perfect!

After making this recipe a few times I prefer to use a frozen banana and a generous extra bit of chocolate syrup with the milk and skip the ice…the texture is more to our liking this way… chocolate and banana is a classic combination and if you like that you'll like this….

I did as another user suggested and omitted the ice and used frozen bananas instead of fresh. To do this I flash freeze my sliced bananas and then store them in a zip lock bag until I'm ready to use them. 
Instead of using chocolate syrup I used a TB of Dutch process coco powder, and added a handful of spinach. What a YUMMY treat! The kids and I loved it.

Great! A great smoothie for a chocolate or banana craving! I added about a tbs of sugar, and an extra banana, along with extra chocolate. The banana and chocolate were just because I love my chocolate and banana! My brother had one too, and he loved it. Dark chocolate syrup made it super-yummy :)

I had this for Breakfast this morning. I used a frozen banana to make it a bit thicker drink. I also added a packet of splenda because I thought it needed to be a tad sweeter. Fat free milk and sugar free chocolate syrup. It was perfect and yummy...and a guilt free way to start my day!

this tasted amazing!!! since i was only making one serving, i made the following changes:  1 banana 1/3 cup of milk  1 tsp sugar 1 tsp unsweetened cocoa powder  3 ice cubes  well, i guess i made a change in everything! lol, well the milk seemed too much, and i like my smoothies with a nice, rich, consistency.. so i only used 1/3 of  a cup. also, i prefer cocoa powder over chocolate syrup.. it's more natural and you don't need too much. (note: chocolate syrup has a lot of sugar!!)

Made by my son, Matthew (14), as part of a Health class project. He says: Gives you a summertime feeling, and you can also taste both the chocolate and the banana. I say: Next time we will probably use frozen milk or yogurt rather than ice to cut down on separation. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very easy smoothie. The first time I tried this I made it exactly like the recipe, it was good but too thin. The next time I followed the advice of others and added an extra tablespoon of syrup, omitted the ice and used a frozen banana, which made the drink thicker. Great blend of chocolate and banana, neither is overpowering. Definately a keeper!

The kids and I loved this.  We used unsweetened whey protein powder in lieu of syrup and used 6 drops of vanilla Cree stevia.  I doubled this recipe and then poured the leftovers into those little Popsicle molds to freeze for a later treat.

I thought this tasted alright. I got caught up in the reviews that it might be bland or not sweet enough. So, I ended up adding a few drops of vanilla and a packet of splenda. I don't think it needed it though. I used 1% milk. Overall, it just kind of tasted like a very lightly sweetened icy chocolate milk. It did make 3 servings not 1.

This was yum. I did add some ice cream though which I think made it thicker. I will be making this again when we get bananas again cause they are really expensive in Australia at the moment following cyclone Larry in North Queensland the main banana plantation for Australia.

This is an amazing treat, at first I didn't know what to do with the ice because we had just cubes so my dad helped me out it . It makes 3 cups for me or 1 very big coffee mug. I love that there is just a touch of chocolate that helps make it sweet. I will make this smoothie again!

I like full banana flavor, so I used a frozen banana and omitted the ice. I also didn't have any chocolate syrup in the house, so I just substituted a heaping spoonful of Nestle Quik. After I blended it, it was too thin/milky for me. So to half the milk, I added another banana & spoonful of Quik. In consistency it turned out more like a milk shake than a smoothie, but it tasted wonderful (I almost felt guilty eating it!)! Loved the flavor. Next time to give it a more "smoothie-like" texture I may add a couple of ice cubes (but NOT a full cup--don't want to sacrifice that flavor! :)).

I just made 3 servings of this smoothie but I did not have any chocolate syrup so I used 7 tablespoons of Ovaltine. It was one of the best smoothies I have made.

This is the best smoothie of all time, but since I didn't have fat-free/sugar-free chocolate syrup, I used 1 tablespoon cocoa powder with a few packets of sweetener, and it still turned out yummy! If you want a fat-free version of the chocolate banana smoothie, I would use fat-free milk, too!

This is really good.. I think it's better with a packet of hot chocolate mix instead of chocolate syrup, but then I don't really like chocolate syrup.

This was delicious! Although, I did alter it a bit. I used 2 T chocolate syrup instead of 1, and I used 1/2 c. vanilla ice cream and 1/2 c. milk instead of 1 c. milk. The extra chocolate really brought out the chocolaty flavor, and the ice cream helped to thicken the smoothie, as well as adding a little extra flavor. Without these alterations, I imagine that the smoothie would be bland. I made this for my little brother and I. He loved it just as much as I did, and begged me to make it again. I definitely will! It was so tasty, refreshing, and easy! Who wouldn't make this again?

Eh. I made this for my boys this morning and they were non-plussed. I used frozen ripe bananas that I'd been saving as to not waste in place of the ice cubes. This needs something. I think I'll play around with it and see what I could add next time.

I loved the idea except I decided to use chocolate soy milk instead.  It's a healthy alternative!  Not enough banana flavor to it, so next time I will add extra.  Tasted great anyway!

I combined this one with another banana smoothie recipe I saw. I used 2 bananas (one for each child) 1 1/2 cups milk, 1 T chocolate syrup and 1 T honey. My 3 and 5 year old liked it okay, but didn't finish it. They said it was good, but the 1/2 empty glass told me otherwise. Thanks anyway!

I made a double recipe using two frozen bananas and only four ice cubes with my two cups skim milk.  I used four tablespoons of Hershey's Special Dark syrup, yummy stuff!  I also used four tablespoons of wheat germ as I do in all my smoothies.

great smoothie! I added a little sugar,  1 tsp. vanilla and used chocolate milk. Have lots of bananas to use up so will be making this often. Will try using frozen banana and omit the ice as well.

This was really quite good, although I added some of my own ingredients because many were saying it was not sweet enough. This Is what I did..  1 cup of milk 5 icecubes 25ml of chocolate sauce (I have a sweet tooth!) 1 banana A pinch of vanilla essence  Mix it all together and.......WALLAH!

Chocolate taste in a smoothie isn't for everyone.  I made this for my son who's a 'fruit-reluctant chocaholic.'  However, he said it tasted weird with the chocolate mixed with the fruit taste.  I'm also a chocaholic (who likes fruit too) and I agreed with him.  I would suggest making one and giving it a taste test before making a huge batch.  If you like the combo, it's a good recipe! I may try it again with Nestle powder like someone else suggested, since it's not a sharp as chocolate syrup.

It was good. I followed other reviewers' suggestions, and used 2 bananas and 2 tablespoons chocolate syrup. I am by no means a smoothie lover, but I liked this one. I made the mistake to use not-so-ripe bananas, so I guess, with the right ones, it could have been even better.

To make it sugar free and lower calorie I used 1 T. cocoa powder with baking Splenda (amount adjusted to taste).  I also used a frozen banana rather than ice (it makes it so much creamier!) and added about 2 tsp. vanilla.  Very tasty and a great way to get calcium, antioxidants, and potassium.

Excellent!  Very simple, very easy, and very tasty.  We use 2 teaspoons of unsweetened choco with 4 splenda packets.  This makes for a very low-cal, healthy, delicious and filling snack.

I liked the smooth and frothy texture of this smoothie.  But I thought the flavor was lacking something.  After taking a couple of sips, I put it back in the blender and added honey and some lemon juice to perk it up a bit.  I think if I make this again I'll use a frozen banana and not as much ice.  ***I did make this again, and I did use a frozen banana, in fact two frozen bananas.  I also used yogurt in addition to the milk and added some malted milk powder with the chocolate syrup.  It was creamy and thick and much better.

This is not creamy enough for my liking.  If you want additional flavour and texture, I would add a few tablespoons of fat free vanilla yogurt to thicken it up.

Made this morning & this is a great recipe. Although I can't give 5 starts due to having to tweak it a bit. The base of this recipe is great I However did have to add more chocolate & maybe next time I'll add another banana. All around a nice cold smoothie. My daughter & I are drinking it now & is a keeper.

As many other reviewers have stated this is bland made according to the exact recipe.  Instead of the chocolate syrup I used 3 TBLS. of ovaltine, 1 TBLS. agave (to make a little sweeter in taste), and as with all the smoothies I add 1 TBLS. ground flaxseed and 1/2 scoop of soy protein powder.  This states 1 serving and I got 2.  I will make again with my additions.  This would be great on a hot summer day!

With a few small adjustments, this made a fantastic smoothie.  I used 1/2 cup skim milk, 1/8 cup chocolate milk, 1 tbsp cocoa powder, 1 tbsp spenda, 1 banana, and about 8 ice cubes.  Put everything in my smoothie maker, and it came out great!  Thanks for the recipe.

I just made this for my son that has a sore throat and doesn't want to eat anything. He likes it but I think it's very bland. I added 2 extra tbsp of syrup and a second whole banana. I think it was all the ice. I only used the one cup but the smoothie had a watery taste to it. I will try this again but without ice and with frozen bananas as some have suggested. I give this a 3 because my son is drinking it and not complaining.

Definitely increase the chocolate by another tablespoon or so. I used a 5 oz can of evaporated milk,instead of milk,  for extra richness. The kids loved it.

Delicious, but I made a few changes. Used 2 frozen bananas instead of one banana and the ice. And I didn’t have chocolate syrup so I used a table spoon of cocoa powder and half a teaspoon of honey for sweetness. Then I added cinnamon. Yum

Well, my made a lot of it, so he multiplied all the ingredients times three, because 3 people in my family were gonna drink it. I think it was very good, but it isn't refreshing and it seems extremely "bananey". My family liked it too. I would definitely make this again, but maybe change up the recipe a bit.

My dad and I tried this, but made a minor revision. We didn't have any chocolate syrup, so instead of the 1 cup of milk, we used Bolthouse Farms Chocolate Protein Plus drink. It came out wonderful! Only 3 ingredients, yet so tasty!

Tasty & sweet enough for my family.  Would have liked it just a tad bit more thick.  Next time, I'll use a frozen banana.

Delicious. I just made it with my new blender and it was quite simple to experiment with simple ingredients. I'm looking for more recipes to try every week.

I added sugar, waaaaay more chocolate (I just poured it in until I felt like I was done.. because why not?), and Kahlua (again, why not?). Pretty tasty.

I used nutella-like chocolate instead of choc syrup. Made it taste even better in my opinion. Highly recommend it.

This is a really good recipie but it is a bit bland.  To liven up the flavor I added 1tsp. of Vanilla Extract and a little sugar to cut the tartness of the chocolate!

Nice recipe!  I used a frozen banana instead of fresh and 3 tbsp of chocolate syrup.  It turned out great!

Yummy!  I have a two year old who doesn't like bananas...what a great way to sneak one in!  I did add more chocolate (and used powder).

This is really good. Instead of chocolate sauce, I used a whey protein powder in a chocolate flavor. It tasted so good. I didn't have to add sugar or anything, and it's so healthy!

Since I'm lactose intolerant and mostly vegetarian, I don't use cow's milk for much of anything edible.  My normal smoothie base is soy milk and tofu, with banana for breakfast - and I frequently use chocolate soy milk in this one.  Love it!  When Mom had teeth pulled for dentures, she was getting tired of Jell-o and applesauce - and realized the lack of protein in the Jell-o-and-applesauce routine was making her light-headed, so she jumped at smoothies.  No longer a problem with the tofu addition!  I use a stick blender, right in the oversized glass.  Thanks for posting this!

This was pretty good.  I would probably add more fruit and not as much ice next time.  The kids loved it.

Tasted great.  I didn't have any chocolate syrup and used chocolate milk instead of the syrup and white milk.  I also added a scoop of ice cream.

Very good recipe.  You can very easily change this to your own likes.  Add more chocolate, ice, or even ice cream.  It is very good and very refreshing.  Thanks!

doubled the recipe by adding 10 ice cubes, 1 1/2C of milk, and a bit more chocolate..tastes better than the banana smoothie packets you can buy at the store.

I don't like bananas, but because they're so good for you, I'm on the constant look out for ways to disguise the taste. This was good and easy to get down with the chocolate syrup added in. Thank you Angie!

I agree that this was lacking a bit, even when I added more chocolate syrup. I'll try adding some sugar next time. Four stars because I always end up making this smoothie anyway!

This was between okay and good.  It's just missing a little something, and I'm not sure what.  I did add more syrup and banana, as other reviewers suggested.  All in all, it's not a bad way to eat a banana, but I think I'll go with an all-fruit smoothie next time.

This is a good base for a recipe.  You can tweak it all kinds of ways.  Here is what I added: choco chips, peanut butter, honey, dried milk.  The girls loved it.

I really like this recipe, mostly because it is a little bland and not so sweet.  I feel like I am getting my milk and fruit in one shot and avoiding lots of extra sugar.  It goes so well with toast or a bagle in the morning.
