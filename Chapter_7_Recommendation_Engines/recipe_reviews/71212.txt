I made this as a side dish for Easter this year and got many compliments, although I thought that the chicken was pretty bland.  I cut the chicken into about 1" chunks, which were too big, so I will definitely do the 1/4" strips next time, and maybe pre-season the chicken a little, at least with salt and maybe some garlic or onion powder.  I also used regular orange marmalade instead of sugar free (I don't like the flavor of Nutra sweet) and red wine vinager instead of raspberry vinegar and those things worked just fine!

I brought this to a baby shower last week and it was a BIG hit!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I did make a few minor changes however.  As another reviewer noted, the sauce was a little thick so I added the juice of the orange I used for the orange rind and it was a bit tart so I added a few teaspons of balsamic vinegar.  I used Raspberry Wine Vinegar (Reese's) which I think has more flavor than regular Raspberry Vinegar.  Also, I marinated the chicken breasts in a Balsamic Vinaigrette salad dressing (Wishbone, Kraft, etc.) for about an hour and cooked them on the grill.  I used a rice that was a combination of wild, red, white and brown (Texmati).  It comes in a plastic bottle/jar.  It was very nice because it doesn't stick together.  The marmalade was the secret ingredient that no one could figure out.  Husbands liked it too!

I made this recipe as a main dish and served cold - excellent for a hot day. I liked the flavor contrast. I did not have just wild rice, so I used 3 Success Rice brown and wild rice pouches (did not use seasoning enclosed with them); also, I did not have enough pecans, so I added some cashew nuts, crushed. Everything worked fine, but I thought that the dressing was too thick. Next time I'll increase the amount of raspberry vinegar to make the salad more juicy, and perhaps add more sliced grapes.

this was interesting--very different. my grocery store was out of sugar-free marmalade, so i just used regular--maybe that's why it seemed too sweet and overpowering for me. i'm not sure if i'll make it again, but it was fun to experiment with. the grapes, nuts, chicken, and rice were a great combo, i just might need to do some tweaking on the dressing.

I seasoned the chicken a little, and I used 2 boxes of original rice-a -roni (white and wild rice mixed) without the seasoning pkt.  I loved the flavor!  This is a great side dish for pot-luck.

This was a yummy combination of flavors, and is a great way to use leftover roast chicken, too.

AWESOME!!  THIS WAS A GREAT & EASY RECIPE.  INSTEAD OF COOKING THE CHICKEN AT HOME, I PURCHASED AN ALREADY COOKED CHICKEN (DEFINITE TIME SAVER).  ANOTHER SUGGESTION--WITH THANKSGIVING COMING UP, THIS WOULD BE A GREAT OPTION FOR LEFTOVER TURKEY.

I found this recipe while looking for something to use up grapes.  I made it for my picky family (myself included) with plain white rice, chicken, grapes, and pecans.  We all love it!  We tried the dressing but didn't like it, and I'm not sure what else would work as a dressing for picky eaters like us.  It's nice and light for summer.

Using what I had on hand, I substituted Unble Ben's long grain and wild rice mix, apricot pinapple jam and a raspberry walnut vinaigrette. I also added a touch of caraway. The result was very, very tasty! A keeper. Thanks.

I reduced the recipe down to one serving and something just wasn't right with the directions. My husband said it had too much raspberry vinegar. It was just kind of different. Can't see making it again.

I made this as a side dish (I shredded the chicken and mixed it in) and took it to a pot-luck dinner. I had 2 people ask for the recipe. It is different, and has a great mix of flavors. It is not the kind of thing I would make as a regular dish, but it is great for a special meal.

Basically I used this recipe as a template, cutting it drastically to serve 2.  I did not us any rice, plus I had pre-cooked chicken on hand.  Used most of the prescribed ingredients, except the vinegar.  I substituted some mayo in the dressing in lieu of vinegar, (my husband has a huge aversion to vinegar).  All in all, it worked out quite well.  I served the salad @ room temp in raddichio cups, garnished with basil and parsley. A nice cool salad for a warm evening!

I liked this but thought the orange flavor was too strong. I would probably omit the orange zest next time. It also made way too much dressing - about half would have been plenty.

My boyfriend hated this dish.  He thought the grapes were disgusting and the cold dish idea was terrible.  I didn't mind it, but I don't like it as much as the other reviewers.

My husband is a vegetarian, so I omitted the chicken and cut down the dressing a little bit.  It was a delicious side dish!

This was an interesting dish to make and eat once, but not something I would make a second time.  I think it might have been better with a few things to add crunch.

This is wonderful!!  I seasoned my wild rice by substituting about 1/4C fresh orange juice (the juice of 1 orange) for part of the water called for in the rice cooking directions.  I also added a long strip of the orange rind to the water and a stick of cinnamon, (both removed at the end of cooking) and added 1/4C craisins.  I added about 1/4 C chopped cashews to this salad also and omitted the salt  completely(for health reasons).  This salad has so much flavor that the salt was not missed at all.  I served it on a bed of baby spinach and had it as a main dish.  What a wonderfully cool and refreshing summertime meal!!

You can thin out the dressing by using vegetable stock. I reheated the chicken (already cooked and on hand from a previous recipe) in good vegetable stock, then added the dressing ingredient right in the bowl and mixed. I had to swap the orange marmalade for apricot preserves (also on hand) but I believe it lended the same fruity sweetness the recipe is after. Knowing rice will usually absorb the extra stock once it sits for a while, I made my mixture a tad bit soupy at first, but it ended up the exact right consistency. We had it warm for dinner, and I can't wait for it cold for lunch! Glad I made it!
