The best blondie recipe I have ever tried. It doesn't taste like chocolate chip cookies or is too heavy on the palate. THe recipe makes about 9 decent single-serving size brownies. We used wild turkey bourbon and sea salt and like I said, it was delicious so it disappeared fast.

I loved the flavor of these but have to admit they were too greasy.  Maybe more flour and another egg would help.  I will try it next time and see, ofcourse I'd then have to add more bourbon too. :)

I was a little bummed they didn't have much bourbon flavor and were very greasy. They were simple to make. When I make them again I'll tweak them a bit.

I made one change and used whiskey instead of bourbon. I couldn't really detect the flavor but could smell it when I opened the container I had the blondies in. They were okay but too greasy for my tastes.
