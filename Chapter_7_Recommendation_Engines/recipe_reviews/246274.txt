Delicious! I didn't have tarragon, so I used thyme instead. Baking time was off though. Mine took over an hour to get the breast meat to 165 degrees (they were pretty thick breasts). I added some potatoes, zucchini, carrots and onions around the bird, that roasted up nicely, and went well with the chicken. Will make again!

I made this according to the directions except my bird was about 5 pounds so I cooked it at 425 for about an hour. I also used the rub to coat some steak fries before using it on the chicken and I cooked those in a separate pan alongside for about 40 minutes. The skin was crisp and the meat was moist. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is the only way that we now bake chicken in the house. I had to use other spices that I had on hand  but the whole family just loves it.  
I cook mine at 350 for 1.5 hours. We like crispy skin and the meat is still very moist.

I had a couple of issues with this recipe. First, I am still really surprised that my smoke alarm didn't go off. Having my oven at such a high temperature created tons of thick, eye-watering, cough-inducing  smoke. Second, I found it way too salty. Maybe cut the salt down to half - or even lower. I'm real sensitive to salt and this I really felt, was way too much.  Lastly, I found the chicken (especially the breasts) to be dry. Yeah, the skin was great...lovely and crisp but again, way too salty. I have a method of roasting a chicken, done standing up in a 400 degree oven for one hour and it comes out tender, juicy and best of all...NO SMOKE!!

If you use one chicken instead of the two that the recipe calls for, be careful of the salt amount.  Also, ask your butcher to split  and flatten your chicken for you.  I like a hint of lemon so I just used the juice of one lemon on my one chicken.  I will definitely make again.  Thank You for your recipe

Delicious, Juicy & Tender Chicken!  I tweaked spices to my personal preference then followed recipe after that, minus the lemon slices. I instead used a fusion of balsamic vinegar and Meyer lemon juice.   **I also used convection oven setting set at 425*F  for about 45-50 minutes for a 6.25 lb spatchcock chicken. Chicken was perfect at 160*F w/nice crispy skin (which I always remove for myself).

I tried this recipe when I saw it in the April/May issue of Allrecipes Magazine. It did not disappoint! The chicken was so juicy and the lemon was like candy underneath the chicken skin. We were fighting over it. I have have made it several times.  The hardest part is getting the chicken cut up in he beginning. I got some new kitchen shears so hopefully when I make it tonight it will be easier. Cooking time is adjusted if I am using bigger chickens. Yummy!

This really was quite good. I did it as written and I liked the flavors. The great thing is you can change the seasonings and make it all different ways. 

I used a cut up chicken instead of cutting a whole one and it didn't miss a beat. It was quick and I loved how juicy the meat was. Even better the next day.

Moist and delicious way to prepare chicken. I prefer this way to roasting it whole, no soggy bottom and very little waste.

This was cooked perfectly with a nice, crisp texture, and juicy meat. However it was a little bland in my opinion. I would add more spices or add some sort of dipping sauce to it.

I followed the recipe except I grilled on a weber has grill at 350.
Lid closed. Absolutely delicious. I purchased a whole chicken
( Small about 3 lbs.) and it was a dinner for two.

Very good.  I reduced oven temp to 425.   It cuts down on smoky chicken fat.

The chicken came out so juicy and so much faster! Added some baby potatoes around the chicken to bake at the same time.

This recipe was outside my comfort zone and I was anxious to try it. My husband and I both liked it, the lemon added interesting flavor and the chicken was a good balance of crispy skin and moist meat. It probably won't be my go-to chicken recipe, but I liked enough to use it again in the future!

Amazing. I picked this for it’s simplicity- I was lucky that the guy at the meat counter heard me say spatchcock and cut it perfectly, so I can’t comment on that part of the adventure. This is such a superior way to cook a chicken perfectly. The spices and seasoning technique here are perfect- really great combo and easy to do. My bird was close to 5lb. I cooked at 450 for about 40 minutes.

I used one cornish hen for a family of four. I guess it wasn't enough. My oldest asked for more chicken, which is amazing considering she doesn't always like meat. I was unable to put lemon slices under the skin, but it still turned out delicious.

Spatchcocking is my favorite way to cook a whole bird. As a method, it makes grilling both turkeys or chickens easy on the bbq. Here's a tool-tip: for some larger birds (and even smaller ones), sheers don't always work. I bought a small keyhole saw at my local hardware store just for this purpose. it is now a kitchen tool!

Had this tonight, cooked in broiling pan with veggies on bottom, chicken on top. Had to cook 1 hour but that was no problem. Can honestly say this was THE BEST CHICKEN I have ever eaten! And extremely easy to make! Even breast meat was juicy!

This is the best chicken!!  I added 1 tsp of thyme to the rub mixture.  It is just delicious, and so easy!  I prefer the spatchcock method over roasting a whole chicken.  It is easy and it cooks faster!

We really liked this. Couldn't get herbs under the skin, but it was still great. Also skipped the lemon. Will make it again. May try the lemons next time.

I made this as directed, followed the recipe exactly except I didn't need two chickens so divided the recipe in half for one chicken.   It was OK but nothing special.  Husband said better on the rotisserie grill and he is correct.  This did not cook in the time recommended 
I won't make this again

The roasting time is way off, more like an hour. To prevent problem of dry meat, I always brine any chicken that I will roast or grill. And yes, the salt is excessive.

Crispy, juicy, and easy! 3 words that don't normally go together.  I used rosemary and thyme, pulverized manually with my mortar and pestle, and a bit of lemon pepper seasoning on the small, uncut potatoes, carrots and white pearl onions. I used an open roaster, placing the vegetables UNDER the rack where  the  Spatchcock chicken  roasted, dripping the delicious broth on them throughout roasting.  Not a bite left!

Excellent recipe!  We had a heavy frost last night but I was able to salvage the last of our Mexican Tarragon. I processed it with the oil and other seasonings and applied as directed. The chicken finished nice and crispy with a wonderful color. YUMMY!

My chicken was 5 pounds so I roasted at 425 for 1 hour.  And I covered breast with foil for the last 20 minutes.  I also rotated half way through.  
I used butter and garlic under the skin.  Put the chicken on a roaster with onions and sweet potatoes all around. 
It was delicious

Just curious why the recipe would be posted for 2 chickens.  Do we then cut all ingredients in half if making only one chicken? I did not make this yet but had to rate it to get my question answered.
