AWESOME, MEAT DOES FALL APART IF YOU COOK FOR 7 HOURS OR MORE. I DID 7 HOURS AND THEN I HAVE ALSO MADE IT OVERNIGHT. AWESOME, AMAZINGLY EASY AND DELICIOUS! I CAN'T COOK ANYTHING AND MY FAMILY BEGGED FOR THIS FOR A WEEK. IT IS AWESOME POURED OVER A BAKED POTATO W/ CHEESE AND SOUR CREAM. OR, SERVE WITH RICE OR MASHED POTATOES. I DOUBLED THE RECIPE AND DO SO EVERY TIME.

Anyone who cooked this and had it come out tough there must be a HUGE problem. I followed the recipe to be exact and cooked it all day which was about 12 hours on low heat and the meat fell apart with a fork and the broth was AMAZING!!! Can't wait to make this again.

Super way to utilize a low cost cut of beef.  Added a handful and a half of cooked egg noodles at the end and served it over a toasted french bread bun.  YUM YUM!  Thank you.

This recipe was great since we don't have a grill. Since my fiance isn't a mushroom fan, I changed the soup to cream of celery and it was delicious! The meat was very tender and the gravy was great over rice.  I did add a little more water as well, and cooked on high for 4 hours.

I did not use water, and the sauce turned out very creamy and flavorful.  I added onion soup mix at the beginning along with the other ingredients to give it a nice zip, and added fresh mushrooms about halfway through.  Turned out very well with these revisions.

This was DELICIOUS!!!  I don't know why some people say the meat lacked flavor and it was not tender...we did not need knives and it was so flavorful!!  I served it with homemade mashed potatoes and the gravy was fabulous on them. On the side I served parmesan asparagus and it was the perfect meal.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect!  I guess I probably did cook it a little longer than called for.  I threw it in the crockpot around 10am and served it at 6:30 pm.  My kids LOVED it...which was weird because they are very very picky.  Easy....yummy....fabulous!  I will make it again and again!!

Added half a chopped onion (and sliced mushrooms 5.5 hours into cooking) and cooked on low for 6.5 hours.  The meat was tender enough, but Very dry.  Used flour to make gravy---that was tasty.  If I make this again I'll slice the meat into 1" strips (maybe it won't be so dry), and cook on high for 3.5-4 hours.

The flavor was delicious but the meat was a little chewy.  (After only 4 hours in slow cooker on low.)  I was excited to have london broil fall apart, but it did not deliver there.

I made this tonight and it was delicious!  Added fresh mushroom to the pot.  Served with blue cheese butter, also from this site, mashed potatos and steamed zucchini and onions.  Make me look forward to going to work tomorrow since it will be my lunch also.  Great recipe.

Yummy I made a couple of changes I added 1/2 cup of milk along with 1/2 c water, mushrooms, onions, creole seasoning, couple dashes of worcestirshire sauce, cooked on low for 7 hours then added a cup of heavy cream for additional 1/2 hour & some blue cheese crumbles, shredded meat.  Very tasty!  Served over bow tie pasta & mashed potatoes.

Sorry guys, but this one wasn't for me!  I am a big fan of pot roast, beef stew, and other braised meats, but I did not enjoy this at all!  Although the meat was fairly tender, I did not like the taste at all, will not make again!! Maybe if you seared the meat first, still don't think it would make that much of a difference! Sorry!

I made this in the crock pot overnight and it was soooo tender, I pretty much followed the recipe with these few additions, half packet of Lipton onion soup mix, half of an onion, can of beef stock instead of water and added a teaspoon of beef bouillion.Once done I added about 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream and served over egg noodles, with asparagas. Will serve along side of mashed potatoes next time. Delicious

This is such a great meal!! I made a few changes though. I seasoned the meat with salt/pepper and browned it in olive oil first. I also used a can of cream of celery soup as well as the mushroom. I used a can full of water instead of 1/2c. Also a packet of beefy onion soup mix, plain onion soup mix would work fine too. And about 1tbsp of dales low sodium steak seasoning. Cooked on low for about 10hours, I worked all day and that tough piece of meat could use several hours of cooking anyway. It turned out great!!!! It goes well over a baked potato, a hoagie, or rice. Add a few veggies on the side and you have a delicious supper. Will definitely make this again.

The ingredients made a nice gravy. The meat was ok, not melt in your mouth. Without the gravy over it, it was too dry.  Had very good flavor.

Anyone should be able to prepare this dish because it is so EASY!  So simple and delicious yet is so versatile in that it can be adapted to what type of seasonings you prefer.  For a three pound London broil,  I omitted the garlic cloves but added a teaspoon of All-purpose Greek salad seasoning.  I added a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper and substituted a can of cream of chicken soup.  I cooked for 3 hours on high and then turned to low for 4 hours.  Made a great gravy which I served over mashed potatoes along with green beans, carrot salad and rolls!  Yummy!  Thanks Yvonne for sharing your recipe!

I put a 2lb London Broil from Sprouts in the crockpot. It was frozen. I cooked it on LOW for 12 hours overnight with 3 cans of mushroom soup; 1/2 cup of water; NO garlic; and 1 Tsp organic Italian seasoning (oregano+basil mix).  This morning it is soft, tender, and shredded the way I wanted it. The gravy is divine for the mashed potatoes I will make this afternoon.  The slower you cook the broil the more tender it will be-10-12 hours on Low seems best if you want very tender meat.

Great simple recipe that costs next to nothing to feed the family.  Next time, I will cook a couple handfuls of egg noodles on the stove to serve under this, as the mushroom soup melts into a gravy that reminds me very much of stroganoff.

This was a great recipe.  I followed the instructions exactly how it shows.  Added some onions and mushrooms at about 1-2 hours left of cooking and made a gravy with the sauce. It was a HUGE hit. My picky toddler ate it. And my father in law who is my biggest critic loved it and couldn't believe how tender the meat was.  Thanks for sharing this recipe. It is in my permanent recipe box for future use.

NO KNIFE NEEDED! I added about 1/3 cup soy sauce (didn't measure). Other than that follwed as directed. This is def a keeper and you can change it up in so many ways. I would double the soup and water if you want more gravy because there didn't seem like a lot.

This recipe tasted great on the day I made it, but was even better the next day. I doubled the cream of mushroom soup, but kept all the other measurements the same. I put the beef in the crock pot, then the soup, then just sprinkled all of the other ingredients on top. I cooked it for 10 hours on low, as I used a two pound london broil and it turned out perfect. Served the gravy over egg noodles...delicious!

This was great. I made it per the recipe and it was moist and tender and delicious. I did cut up some potatoes and added them about 3 hours before end time and that was okay. Next time, I'll serve it over wide egg noodles or rice, because it is like a stroganoff almost. The gravy came out perfect.

My husband doesn't like mushrooms, so I took a risk and used cream of chicken instead.  It turned out delicious!  You can't even taste the chicken flavor -- it took on a beefy flavor and was very tasty over brown rice!

WOW!!  This turned out so much better than I anticipated!  A generic brand of cream of mushroom soup (that looked really nasty!) couldn't even keep this recipe down.  The only changes I made was adding a can of mushrooms to the pot and using a 2.29lb london broil as that was what I had on hand.  Kids gobbled it up 2 days in a row!!  Will definitely be adding this to my rotations!

It came out excellent added pearl onions, carrots and assorted small potatoes as well. Would most likely make this again for the future!

This was absolutely EXCELLENT!!! It was easy to prep and the meat was very tender. If you made this and it wasn't tender, you didn't cook it long enough. Most meats in a slow cooker taste way better when cooked on low for a longer period of time, not rushed in a few hours. My husband and I loved this!! Thank you!

I though this recipe was good, but i did make an adjustment or two.  I added beef stock instead of water, and a can of sliced mushrooms.  After 7 hrs on low it was fall apart tender, and I had about a 2-1/2 lb. london broil in my slow cooker. It left a great gravy to put over mashed potates that I served it with.

Super easy, tasted great!!  I'm lactose intolerant so I made a change, instead of cream of mushroom soup I used a can of beef and mushroom soup and then at the end of cooking I made a rue out of the juices before adding it back to the pot (melt 1tbs butter or butter substitute, mix in 1 spoon full of flour, add juice slowly stirring to blend - use as gravy or keep thin and return to pot). I seasoned and browned the beef first, added some baby carrots to the pot at the start of cooking and served with homemade mashed potatoes...Everyone, including my husband who doesn't like it when I use the crock-pot and my on who doesn't like it when I put sauce on stuff, though it was awesome!  Will make again - easiest pot-roast I've found.
*If you season the meat first adjust the salt or your dinner could be too salty
*At 4-5 hours meat was firm like a steak but with good flavor - at 8-9 hours it was fall off the fork tender like pot roast - it was good firm - but amazing at the longer cooking time

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I cooked it as per the recipe BUT added extra thickly sliced mushrooms towards the last 20 minutes and added 1 more can of mushroom soup.  Sliced the meat in strips and put back in the mixture and served over rice.... It was a fabulous/easy meal for the family.  Thanks for sharing.

What a great alternative for london broil! My grill's not set up at my new house yet, so I was looking for a different way to prepare london broil.  This was excellent.  I added a lot of roasted garlic & herb seasoning and pepper, omitted the salt, and cooked on low for about 7 hours. It was a little dry, as expected per other reviews, but was very tender and flavorful.  I coarsely shredded it into the delicious gravy for the last half hour or so and dryness was not an issue at all.  Yum! Definitely will make again!

Although it was falling apart after cooking 7 hours it was still a bit dry. The taste was good, but not amazing or anything.   I do think that this is a good way to cook your London Broil as it is a lowfat piece of meat that is usually quite tough if you cook it fully.

I followed this receipe exactly as written and cooked the LB for about 7 hours.  NASTY!  This was a waste of a decent cut of meat.  (I tried it this way because it was raining and I had to cook the LB that had been in my fridge for several days.)  It was tender but sooooo dry!   LB is a steak and should be cooked on the grill I guess.  It sounded good, too bad.  Sorry.

Made as directed, except I bought cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic by mistake. As a result, turned out a bit more garlicy than I would have liked. However, it was pretty tasty and super easy to make. Served over egg noodles. Meat was very tender and had plenty of flavor.

I was going to make this exactly as the recipe states but tweaked it at the last minute based on other comments.  I decided to throw in a package of Lipton onion soup mix and eliminated the garlic and salt (the onion soup adds plenty of salt).  The meat cooked all day on low, made its own gravy and was very tender...delicious.  Nothing dry about it.  An easy and very tasty dish served with mashed potatoes.  Ten minutes before serving the meat I added a little bit of the gravy to some baby carrots and microwaved them until tender.  A nice side dish.

I always read other people's reviews to get ideas and clarifications. This a 5 star recipe for sure, especially considering how incredibly easy and affordable it is. It basically cooks itself, tenderizes all on its own, and is a perfect accompaniament to potatoes, rice, noodles, and veg. A very user friendly meal for families, busy and/or budget minded folks. I'll be keeping a London Broil in the freezer...the other items are always in my pantry. Excellent!

I put this in my crockpot before leaving for work this morning and came home to dinner!  I was a little groggy this morning and I doubled the water by accident so my "gravy" was a little soupy but a good flavor.  I added an onion at the start as other reviewers did and it makes me wish I'd had some mushrooms to add as well!  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for the recipe Yvonne!

This was very tasty and tender. I added a can of diced tomatoes for a little tanginess.  Next time I'm going to shorten the cook time by about an hour.

Great recipe just as written (although I use a little less garlic - personal preference). I had planned on making this for last night's dinner, but ended up having a crazy morning and didn't get it in the crockpot on time. So, I sliced my 1.5lb london broil, put it in the crockpot and followed the advice of other reviewers and just poured a can of mushroom soup (low sodium), water and onion soup mix on top and cooked it on HIGH for almost 4 hours. OMG! So good and my kids couldn't stop eating it. Success! Thanks for the original recipe and to the other reviewers for their tweaks.

very easy to make, I didn't have any garlic so I sliced up a large onion instead and it was pretty tasty and after 7 hours the meat was very tender.  I served it over rice and will definitely try this again but will add mushrooms next time!

This was a hit in my household....my picky-eater 4 year old daughter loved it.  Of course, my hubby loved it b/c well it contained meat LOL. I cooked it for the 7 hours on low as the recipe called for and the meat fell apart & the gravy was delicious. I served it over rice and it was just GOOD! Follow the recipe as it is here and there should not be any mishaps.

London Broil was on sale so I thought I'd try something new. It was alittle crazy how tender the meat ended up. It was very bland tho - needed something. I was thinking maybe a squueze of lemon, my som was thinking something with alittle more fruit flavor but it did need a zing. Not sure I'll make this again. BTW I cooked about 5 pounds of meat in 2 pieces and it did shrink significantly more then I expected it to

I don't use canned soup.  Beef broth from the box or homemade.  I put  fresh mushrooms in the bottom of the pot,  a whole sliced onion, and some chopped celery.  Sprinkled salt and pepper on the meat with garlic.  About a cup and 1/2 of beef broth.  Cook on high for 5 hours.  Made gravy with the juice and it all disappeared.  They want more again soon.  SOOOO good!!!

This was pretty good. I used cream of mushroom and cream of vegetable as well as everything else listed. Next time I will add some beef broth instead of water and some red wine for flavor. I added potatoes and pearl onions as well here and they were great. Sauce needed more flavor but with the wine and beef brother, that will change next time.

It does have to cook the full 7 hours. I added 1/2 cup more warm water with 1/2 tsp. beef boulion, some portabella mushrooms, onion, and Mrs Dash Garlic and Herb seasoning.

Really good! Added 1/2 envelope onion soup mix with mushroom soup. cooked for 8 hrs and meat fell apart. Sauce was a little thin for gravy so I had to whisk together equal parts (2 TBSP) flour and cold water into a paste then stir into liquid. It made the gravy perfect! Great flavor,served w/ mashed potatoes and peas as suggested for a great comfort meal. The boys in my house loved it.

Delicious flavor. I used a 2 lb London Broil and cooked it for about 9 hours on low. Next time I would double the soup and water quantities because there wasn't enough of this golden mixture. It was so good!

This was tasty and very easy.  My meat was so tender and falling apart by the end (I needed less time than called for).  I added mushrooms and coarsely chopped the meat to make it more of a stroganoff.  I did double the sauce which was nice for the noodles I served it over.

I thought this was a great recipe but I would use 2-3 cans of the cream of mushroom soup and change the water amounts accordingly.  I did not have enough gravy to put over the noodles hence the increase in liquids.  The meat was very soft but dry.  If you change the amount of liquid, you will have enough gravy for the meat and noodles.

Made this for the first time tonight. I slow cooked it for 7 hrs but it still came out pretty dry.  The flavor was good though. My crockpot is brand new so it wasn't the crockpot and the London Broil was 2 lbs.  So I am not sure what went wrong.

This was a good meal after a long day at work!! I didn't add the basil, oregano or mushrooms because I was in a hurry and forgot. I added a dry soup mix. I served over egg noodles with steamed zucchini. Family ate it up!! Suggestion to readers: use only half of the dry soup mix.. it came out a little salty..

This was very good.  The only thing I changed was adding an envelope of onion soup mix and using beef broth instead of water. The meat cooked for about 10.5 hours and it completely fell apart.  The gravy was probably thick enough on it's own to get away with not adding any flour, etc, but was too salty given the changes I made. We had this with the roasted red potato with aspargras recipe also on this site.  Great!

This was a great recipe.  Easy & used ingredients readily available in nearly every kitchen.  I had a two pound London Broil & it was still plenty of sauce to keep the meat covered.  Very tender.  I added a tablespoon of dehydrated onion,  After 7 hours on low, I removed the meat & poured the sauce into a pan & added a slurry for gravy.  Served over steamed white rice with French cut green beans & some garlic cheddar drop biscuits.  Great Sunday supper.  Thanks for sharing.  Definitely a keeper.

Easy and FANTASTIC! Thank you for such a super easy delicious recipe!!  I baked it in the oven at 350 for 2 hours - it was nice and tender.  Next time, I'll use the slow cooker and use the "sauce" as gravy for veggies.  YUM YUM YUM!

I made this yesterday. I used a 3lb LB so used 6 cloves of garlic. Left out the oregano. Added 1/2 c red wine and one can of soup with the water. Boiled up some WW Gnocchi and threw it in last 15 minutes. Starch from the Gnocchi thickened the gravy - love that veloute consistency. Meat was still LB - IMO never very tender or flavorful unless marinated to death. Overall excellent outcome - will try again with a better crock pot cut. The gravy wins the stars.

Ridiculously simple. I made one substitution (beef broth for the water). Cooked it low on for 6.5 hours. Feel apart beautifully, tons of gravy. For those who stated it came out too dry: what the heck did you do?!?

I made this recipe yesterday. I made the recipe exactly as it reads and didn't like it at all.  It had an extremely strange flavor and smell, don't think the spices go well with this.  This is the first time I have ever given a recipe one star.  Will not make this again.

Not exactly what I was expecting but it was good! I used a can of water and used garlic powder, onion powder and italian seasoning. This was just like a pot roast except that it is much leaner than the chuck roast I normally use. London broil is usually on sale at least once a month, we will probably have this for dinner a couple of times a month. Very easy to make, nice to start before work and have it done by dinner time.

Very good flavor, I added some reduced sodium soy sauce and some worcheshire.  I also used Italion seasoning in place of oregano and basil.  I cooked for 6.5 - 7 hrs and meat did fall apart however was very dry, if I make again will only cook for 5 - 6 hrs.

I usually don't do as much garlic, since my people are not garlic people- but it's not too much. This is epic over rice with the sauce.

I'll admit, I did not have high hopes because it seemed too easy.  I was pleasantly surprised that it came out with a rich flavor and was pull apart tender.  (For those who do not love the flavor of Cream of mushroom soup, substitute the Cream of Chicken and Mushroom soup as it will give a better flavor. I would not recommend going straight to the Cream of Chicken because it will be too soupy. You need the texture of the Cream of Mushroom.) The only thing I will do differently next time is double the sauce recipe!

This was a great way to make london broil. I was short on time and cooked it for 4 hours on high -- perfect.  I added fresh mushrooms which my husband really enjoyed.  Will certainly make again.

It was good, but not 'to-die-for' good. The meat was a little dry for my taste, but I will try it again and cook it for less time. Overall, good recipe!

Maybe it comes down to the type of london broil cut you buy, but this recipe was really very dry and flavorless, not even salt helped. Really don't know what people are going on about it being tender, was super tough and dry.

I was anxious to use this cut of meat that I got on sale, and the reviews for this recipe were so positive. However, I did check out the one-star reviews, and I can’t say they were not altogether inaccurate.
Despite what sounded like sufficient spices and cooking for a good amount of time in the slow cooker, the meat was surprisingly dry inside and rather bland. I followed one reviewers suggestion and added onion soup mix to the broth.  
I ended up making a stroganoff type sauce and serving it over egg noodles. It was good, but it was less than I had expected and ended up being a bit more of a fuss than I had anticipated.

The meat itself was fall apart and the gravy part was good from the can of mushroom soup, but the meat was a little dry. I cooked it for about 8 hours. 4 on high and 4 on low, maybe need to do just 8 hours on low? Either way it was good and the dryness was remedied by the gravy!

I made this exactly as written, and it came out great! I served it with couscous and veggies for a quick weeknight dinner (having let it slow cook during the workday). it was tender and tasty, but I think it could be better with some added mushrooms and/or onions, maybe.

I would definitely make this again.  I followed the recipe but used the instant pot instead of the crock pot.  I cooked it on high or 1 hour.  I also added a package of onion soup & used beef broth in place of the water!  Served it over egg noodles.  Using the instant pot it was quick, flavorful, moist & delish.  You can add a little cornstarch or flour to thicken the broth at the end if needed.

I had a 3 pound London broil.  Doubled the recipe to ensure I had plenty of gravy.  Substituted red wine for the water and threw in a packet of dried onion soup mix.  Placed the meat on top of a layer of carrots and large cut up potatoes and poured the rest over all.  It was amazing!  Will definitely make this again.  Everyone in the house raved about it!  It's a keeper!

it was Very good and easy.  It's hard to go wrong with mushroom soup as a base even when you don't like mushrooms as a rule...I don't. But the soup has always been tasty & with the London broil, it was fork tender, & fresh garlic, it went well together. I added Basmati rice & fresh steamed broccoli. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe.

I made this last week and my wife said it tasted like hospital food. It was very bland and very disappointing. I had planned on making a hot wings recipe from your sight and looked elsewhere. I didn't want a second bust this week.

This was very good.  It reminded us of the German dish "Saurbraten" .  I did double the ingredients as my meat was twice the recommended weight . )Other than adding a can of mushrooms, I made the recipe as written (all though doubled) I cooked it for 12 hours in the crock pot and the meat was very tender,.I served  this over egg noodles.  No question,  I will make this again, easy and delicious!

This recipe was super easy and there's really nothing wrong with it, but we thought it was just "ok". The meat was very tender, but still dry and stringy. I think this is because the cut of meat was Top Round which is very lean and tough. The sauce in this dish basically makes the most of the dry, stringy meat by adding a rich creamy sauce. I served it over lo mein egg noodles, because I didn't have wide egg noodles on hand. I think I'm just better off staying away from London Broil - if I'm going to do a roast I'll use chuck roast and if I want steak I'll do strips or flank... London Broil is neither here nor there and it's just not that great.

Made this for the first time today, 8/26/16, and I used the recipe as written except that my London broil was slightly smaller (1.4 lbs. instead of 1.5) and I used minced garlic instead of fresh.  Cooked in the crock pot on low for 9 hours and it was FANTASTIC -- in fact, it may be my new favorite crock-pot recipe!  I had it with stir-fried fresh veggies (will try to post a photo) and everything was delicious.  I bought a bunch of London broil steaks a few weeks ago when they were on sale, so I am SO happy to have this recipe!  YUM!!

I made this recipe with turkey London broil and added peas after it was cooked. It was delicious. The first night we had it with mashed potatoes. For the leftovers my husband had it over noodles and enjoyed it just as well as the first time.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was really good.  The meat came out very tender and the sauce was delicious.  I did add a couple dashes of Worcestershire sauce to the cooker to make it just a hint more flavorful.  Will make this again.

I followed this recipe to an exact 'T' and it was just...  Meh...  OK. My guy really liked it a lot but I thought it was a little too 'herby', the meat was stringy and made a mess when I ate it and the flavor was lacking excitement.  I won't be making this exact recipe again but maybe something similar.  Perhaps I'll flavor with some different herbs, spices, or (like another reviewer mentioned) some onion soup mix.

I made up my own recipe, i chopped onions in chunks chopped tons of garlic (my pref). I cut up meat into chunks its easier to fit in pot. I browned meat set it aside, then in a heated sauce pan i put in onions to start cooking down then when wilted i added garlic and cooked it just before it started to brown. Take hot water and put it in the pan you browned meat in to get up all the bits from pan and dropped it in with onions and garlic. I use 2 containers of low sodium beef stock and you may want to add a beef bullion for flavor & baby carrots. i add 2 bay leafs, italian seasoning, oregano, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and cut up potatoes i put in about an hr and 20 min before serving parsley at the end for color. And yes it does take 7 + hrs to cook the longer the better!!!! Strain your broth. i save half for pot roast sandwiches to dip in and the rest i make gravy. But if you really don't like to use London then your better off using  chuck roast. I also add kitchen bouquet to my sauce plus a little wiltshire. to start it as early as possible. When i make it for the masses i start it at around 9-10 am so i know it will be done by 630 latest.

This was fantastic. The meat was soo tender it practically melted, I might have cooked mine a bit too long because there was hardly any sauce to pour over the meat when served but I loved it regardless. Next time I may cook a bigger London broil shred it, and make burritos or just have it over salad like chipotle. YUM

I followed the recipe exactly. Except I ended up leaving it in the crockpot for 8 hours (on low). There was definitely plenty of liquid and the meat absolutely fell apart; although it was still a little dry inside but I guess that is just due to the type of meat. Pretty tasty meal and super easy! Served with some wide egg noodles.

Great recipe for London broil!  Used low sodium beef broth instead of water and omitted oregano-gives me a headache. Also added a splash of soy sauce as per other reviews. This is a keeper! Thanks Yvonne!!!

I made this the other night and it came out delicious! Even my incredibly picky 5-year old ate it right up! It was so easy to make! The meat fell apart perfectly! Whenever I try new recipes I always ask my husband if he thinks any changes needed to be made.. usually he has some suggestions but not with this! He said it was "perfect! Don't change anything!". Success!! :)

Great recipe. We had a 2 1/4 pound roast (a bit bigger than the recipe calls for).  I added a bit more water and some chopped onions.  Slow cooked for 8 hours, and the meat just came apart, full of juice.  I increased the spices just a touch because of the large piece of meat.  We like recipes with fairly strong spice flavor, and this was a bit on the non-spicy side.  I could have added a bit more oregano.  I will do that next time because we will definitely be using this recipe again.

My meat also came out slightly dry, so next time I will cook it for 6 hours instead of 7.  But the flavor of the sauce is amazing and tastes excellent over rice.  Even my picky father enjoyed it.

This is a easy recipie that can be modified to fit what you have on hand and family tastes. I used cream of celery soup in place of mushroom. I also used chopped onion in place of the onion soup mix. It smelled so good and was a BIG hit with the family. Thanks !!

This was very good.  I added red wine to the mushroom soup and I think this would have been bland without it.  I also threw half an onion and 3 sliced carrots into the pot before putting the meat in.  When the meat was done cooking I removed it from the crock pot and added some half and half to the gravy and turned the pot up to high for about 10 minutes.  The addition of the wine and the half and half made a great gravy! I gave this 4 stars because I think it would have been bland without some tweaking, but over all its a good start!

This was so good! Very tender and super easy. I added a small can of mushrooms to the gravy about a half hour before serving.

I just cooked this recipe and added the Lipton Mushroom soup with 1 can of low sodium chicken stock and put sliced carrots, celery and onions to the bottom of the crockpot before putting the meat on top. The flavor is awesome, but I used a Top Round London Broil and it came out really chewy and dry. I will use the broth for other meats I cook in the future.

absolutely awesome!!! I have tried to cook london broil many times, this is the first time that it was very tender. Hubby loved it. I took another reviewer's sugg. and added onions & mushrooms, good advice.

I made this as a last minute meal with a frozen london broil and after 4 hours in the slow cooker on HI heat it was ready. The meat fell apart and the "gravy" was delicious. Went great with homemade mashed potatoes but next time I make it I'll double everything except the meat so there's more gravy. Everyone went back for seconds and they've been asking for it for a couple weeks.

Very tender, juicy. Will make again with less expensive cut of meat, it tastes more like pot roast than london broil. But still amazing!

Very good! I really liked it and I'm not much of a meat eater. My husband loved it and he always groans when I make london broil. (not his cut of choice) The only thing I would change is I would double the liquid recipe. I shredded mine and mixed with egg noodles. There wasn't enough gravy.

Great simple recipe.  I admit I got a little lazy and used a can of cream of mushroom & garlic, dropping everything but the water.  It turned out equally as good!  Instant mashed (red) potatoes and steamed vegetables from the freezer makes a great weeknight dinner.

I thought this was very good. Although my meat didn't fall apart in the slow cooker. It was good the next day too when I reheated it. It did fall apart then.

This was very good, but the gravy could be much thicker. I'm not crazy about the addition of the water. I think next time I will use whole milk instead. I added some sliced fresh mushrooms I had on hand. I served this with whipped potatoes. This is comfort food!

The meat was dry, but the flavor was okay. I used a 1.85lb London broil and cooked on low for 6 hours. The only difference I made from the posted recipe was to include a packet of onion soup mix as one commenter suggested. Usually the low setting on my slow cooker is too low and takes at least 50% more cooking time than instructed in recipes, so I don't know what happened here. I may try it again, but with a fattier cut of meat or cut the cooking time in half.

Great!!! I added cream of asparagus because my HB does not like mushrooms. And I cook first 2 hours on High and after switch to Low for another 6 hours for 2lb of london broil. I cut it on portion part pieces. Next time I will cut on bite size pieses to make it as a stew. All together - awesom!

Excellent recipe. Very simple to make and the possibilities are endless for variations on this one. I read some of the other reviews and added some egg noodles and mushrooms as another reviewer tried and this was a wonderful idea. I recently tried a variation of this recipe using stew meat instead of london broil for a slow cooker beef stroganoff and it was excellent. Thank you for sharing.

My husband raved about this London Broil.  Meat turn out very tender! Served over brown rice.  Did add some meat tenderizer to the meat.  Also added mushrooms and onions and a can of cream of celery to get more sauce.

I think that since the meat was so tender, it was so easy for some people to eat.  But I really wish that it would've had a better taste to it.

This was a really good meal.  The only comment that I'll make is next time,  I'll add some beef broth.  It needed a little more "beefy" flavor for us.

I used a larger cut - 2.5lbs - but kept the recipe the same and it still was a lovely, not overwhelming flavor and sauce. I did 8 hours on low in the crock pot since it was larger. Not quite “fall apart” but certainly tender, no knife needed, at this size and time. Serviced with rice, steamed green beans and cab sav!

I had very high hopes for this recipe, but ended up quite disappointed.  I think that the recipe was fine, but the London broil was dry and way too chewy after ten hours in the crockpot.  

Again, I don’t think there is anything wrong with the recipe, I think it was just a crappy piece of meat.  

I think I will try it again, but next time with maybe chuck.

I have been making this for many years. Although I use 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom soup, 1 lb of fresh sliced mushrooms, 1 med. onion sliced, and 1/4 C red wine. And yes, cook it on low for a good 10 hours or more. The sauce comes out restaurant style and is to die for. My kids like it best over egg noodles but I've used rice or mashed potatoes too.

The ingredients sound totally hokey, but it turned out really well. The meat was tender and with some mashed potatoes it was excellent. Would make again!

The only thing I changed was using Cream of Mushroom Soup with Garlic because they didn't have regular Cream of Mushroom soup.  I didn't have to thicken the gravy, which we served over mashed potatoes and carrots.  This is definitely a keeper!

I made this and added potatoes and carrots so whole dinner was ready in Crockpot when we got home.   My 2 year old granddaughter loved the meat,  I could not cut up little bites for her fast enough. Vey tender and good flavor.  This goes in my favorites.

This is so easy and just as delicious! Will be making this again and again! P.S.I realized after a few hours Crock pot was in a rolling boil while on low! I was able to rescue the meat by setting the temperature to the warm setting. Where it simmered. Meat finished cooking to fork tender in 5 hours!!! I’m wondering if those people that end up with tough meat are having this problem? I’m going out to get new crockpot today. This one isn’t any good to me if I have to watch it so closely.

I have wrestled with making London Broil a few different ways, and making a cheap but tough piece of meat tender is not easy.  I used my 7 in 1 (slow cooker mode) and set for 7 hours.  I used a larger can of Cream of Mushroom soup and extra garlic (my taste) and about a Tbsp of chili flake for a 2.2 lb London Broil.   It came out amazing and was shocked at how easy the meat just pulled apart!  Thanks for the recipe.

My family of six loved this London Broil. It was our first time ever having it, my first time ever cooking it and everyone loved it so much I barely had any leftovers! We will be making this again, the meat fell apart it was so moist and full of flavor. We did add egg noodles at the end with a tiny bit of beef broth to make sure it was not to thick and it was perfect!

I made this recipe and it turned out great but instead of using a half a cup of water I used a half a cup of beef broth which gave everything more flavor.

So delicious! The only thing I changed was I added a beef bouillon cube after the water, and I took the advice of another AllRecipes member and added a Lipton onion soup package. I also added carrots and let them cook with the meat for the full 7-8 hours. Both the meat and carrots were so tender we didn’t even need a knife to cut it up! I served over buttered egg noodles

Braised the London broil after cutting into 3x3 chunks. Bed of 1/2 onion, one stalk of celery in slow cooker. Ditched the lousy cream of soup, of course,  and made a roux of 1 tsp butter, 2 tsp flour, one beef bullion cube. Chopped a small pack of baby portobello mushrooms, added on top of beef in cooker and poured the roux on top of all. Cooked at least 5 hours on low. Then thickened liquids with approximately 2 tsp corn  starch dissolved in water during last hour.  Excellent.  Went well with a German Warsteiner dunkel

I followed the directions exactly as written. The meat was dry. I marinated it before placing it in the slow cooker, so it wasn't tough. It was just dry!! I had the same experience with the 'Creamy  Roast' in the slow cooker.

I loved this recipe! I’ve been looking for an easy way to cook this cheaper cut of meat for a while, and this recipe really nailed it. You absolutely have to let this cook for at LEAST 6 hours on High. Any less and it won’t be falling apart. I used Cream of Chicken because it’s what I had on hand, and also threw in a package of sliced mushroom at the beginning. They never got mushy. When it was done cooking I made a flour slurry and added it to thicken up the gravy. It was amazing!

I made a boo boo! I love this recipe. I hate to say I didn't follow precisely because I only had the cut of beef they call London Broil. It made that cut of beef delicious, semi-moist. I am making another pot of it again. Most of the beef I give to my dog and the broth I keep for myself and plan on making beef stroganoff with it. (dogs should never eat onions) You see, I happen to cook my own dog food and have for decades and London broil is a fairly inexpensive cut of beef with less fat in it which is good for the dog. I hated London Broil and would never eat it. Well, I do have to say this recipe made it delicious! But most of it will still go into the dog food. I prefer Stroganoff over anything.

I had never prepared a London Broil in my life before I tried this recipe. It was so extremely easy and oh so tasty. It will be something I will do again and again.

I made this and instead of using cream of mushroom soup i used 2 beefy mushroom soup and 1/2 cup water,  i found that beefy mushroom soup is almost like KFC gravy just yummy.

Unbelievably easy! Super time saver. I used more garlic than listed and added a sliced onion around the meat. Pulls apart easily with a fork. Perfect on garlic mashed potatoes. Looking forward to left overs!

This was amazing!  So easy.  I wouldn't ever think to put a London broil with cream of mushroom soup in a Crock-Pot.  
I wish I doubled the recipe!
I made with Jasmine rice and put the sauce on top.    Soooooo good!!

I used Golden Mushroom soup as a substitute and I added a slurry to thicken it. The sauce was really, really good. I cooked my meat on High for 4 hrs. and it was a bit dry. I will defintely try this again to get it right.

Being lactose intolerant I had to change a number of items used in this recipe, but what I made was excellent.

I added one package mix of mushroom gravy, one can of beef broth, one can of diced tomatoes and one small can of sliced mushrooms, and about one cup of red wine. The spices were the same, and I stirred them well to combine and laid the frozen London broil in the middle and made sure it had some of the juice and mushrooms on top. 

I cooked this on high for about an hour, stirred it, and then cooked it on the longest setting and walked out the door. Upon returning, a delicious aroma drew me into my kitchen to see an absolutely beautifully tender and moist London broil.  At dinner it was served over wide egg noodles and we had a salad on the side.  My family loved this, and this dish will be made again and again.

Finally, a recipe for London broil that produces tender meat! Made this with my fingers crossed as I disappointed my family before with trying to serve this cut of meat. Followed the directions with the exception of putting on high the first hour of cooking and then to low for the remainder. Added quartered red potatoes three hours prior to done time, then fresh mushrooms an hour and a half before done time. Also very quickly browned the meat in olive oil and steak seasoning as another reviewer suggested. Excellent! Will make this again!

Not sure if I did something wrong but  the flavor was bland and the meat was dry. Too expensive to attempt again. 3 adults were eating and 2 were planning to order a pizza it was that unsatisfactory to them.

Love the crock pot. This came out very tender after 7 hours on high. Made the egg noodles and topped with this recipe. The sauce was good, next time I will add mushrooms. Everyone couldn't stop eating it. Thanks for a great recipe.

Instead of water, I used 1/2 cup pineapple juice with 1/4 crushed pineapple and 2 tablespoons of water.  I added baby carrots with it.  And why I wouldn't love it and I made it.  It was delicious!

Made this today for the first time.  Watched the video and followed recipe exactly as written. Plenty of juice that I thickened into gravy and served over the meat and the egg noodles I cooked. The meat dry and the juice was the saving grace. Not sure if I will make it again but if I do will definitely add some wine to the cooking process.

This was so easy and delicious! I did add a few things after reading some of the reviews. I added a little black pepper , 1 packet of beefy onion soup mix and I used a cup of water with a beef bouillon cube.
I made mash potatoes and broke the meat apart in he crockpot and spooned the meat gravey over the mash potatoes. Yummy ??!
I will be making this again and have saved it to my favorites.

Everything was great!!! Tender and tasty. Only change....substituted a can of French onion soup for the water! But! Be careful with the salt if you do that! Would give it four and a half stars if I knew how!!! Doesn't seem to want to give me that option.(my first review!!!)

I thought this recipe sounded familiar. My mother used to make something similar to this on the stovetop when I was young. She called it Swiss Steak. It is delicious, and the meat does fall apart. However this is more akin to a pot roast than your traditional London Broil that would be served medium rare.

Great recipe! I used a 2.5lb top round roast, because I had it on hand. I needed to cut it to fit in my crockpot, but it came out perfectly tender and easy to fork shred. I follwed the recipe exactly otherwise. Started it at 10am and by about 6:30, all I had to do was shred and boil some egg noodles and diner was done!

This was really good. Followed recipe but used beef broth in place of water and omitted salt. I don't understand some of the negative reviews. Is it the best thing I've had in my almost 70 years. Well, no...but for a tasty and easily thrown together evening meal it can't be beat. I made some instant mashed potatoes, opened a can of tiny green peas, added a salad and invited my neighbor over. Perfect!

Phenomenal! The meat was so tender that it fell apart with the slightest pressure of a spoon, and the gravy was delicious over mashed potatoes. This is a really simple, delicious, and low cost recipe - the holy grail!

Okay so this would have been good if it wasn’t cooked so long. I think maybe 4 hours would have been good. Although the sauce was awesome.

Tender and delicious. Because I am unable to eat canned cream soups I made my own cream of mushroom soup. I did not add the water asked for. Didn’t need to with my own soup.

Easy and delicious.  I added a half an envelope of Lipton Onion Soup mix for extra flavor.  Was perfect served over rice.  Cooked for about 8 hours on low and meat just fell apart.

I used a 2 lb london broil and cooked on low for 4 1/2 hours.  My husband and I found the meat to be very overcooked.  While it was tasty, I will check the "doneness" of the meat at 3 to 3 1/2 hours the next time I make it.

My family really enjoyed this recipe and I loved how quickly it came together.  I added 1 onion to the ingredients prior to starting. I only had 6 hours to cook this and it was tender & delicious but 7-8 hours would have been better. I served this over plain brown rice and sautéed green beans with tomatoes (also from this site). The sauce was delicious and great over the rice. Definitely will be making this again especially on those busy night when we are all running in different directions.

I made this in my programmable crockpot set for 6.5 hours, then switched to warm for 2 hours.  I used golden mushroom soup because I like it better.  Next time I won't use as much water so the sauce can be more like a gravy.  The meat came apart easily and I served over egg noodles.  Super easy--will make this again.

This made for some really good open-face roast beef sandwiches. The cream of mushroom soup made good, ready-made gravy, and I didn't use milk or water with the soup; just scooped it out of the can and spread it over the meat,  after I first spread a package of onion soup mix on the meat. Maybe the onion soup mix wasn't necessary, but it evidently didn't hurt anything.  Maybe I should have added some milk or water per the directions on the can? I added several mushrooms (sliced and whole). Next time, which will be fairly soon (bought one/got one free), I'll make it without the onion soup mix. Should I add milk or water per the directions on the can?

The meat was wonderful but I agree with many others that it was a little flavorless.  I see that some people added onion soup mix, that sounds great.  I added something some people hate but it really made it super tasty...Gravy Master, about 2 tablespoons.  Perked it right up, I love that stuff.  My boys had seconds.

Only change was to add an onion.  Thought it was a little bland, but was so easy and fall apart tender.  Next time I might follow some other reviewers and add a few extra spices, but this was so easy that I will definitely make again.

This was quite good. Since I couldn't find London broil, I used round steak. I kept it in my slow cooker for 8  1/2 hours and the meat fell apart. The gravy was delicious on homemade mashed potatoes.

Unfortunately we weren't fans of this. The meat was decently tender but we found it to really lack flavor.

I sliced my meat thin and cooked on high for 4 hours due to a time constraint. I doubled the soup and beef broth (instead of water). I also ended up adding carrots and potatoes in the begining and egg noodles at the end plus some extra seasonings to help add flavor. It ended up more like a beef stew which is okay, but my family does not like soups/stews. It could be a decent stew base, but definitely needs more seasoning for flavor. I'm not sure that we would have been able to eat it without the additions for flavor that I had made which still weren't enough. 

Side note: I wish people's ratings showed what area they live in since flavors are so different all over the country. For example, living in San Diego, Ca. I am spoiled with great flavorful food, fresh seafood and REAL Mexican food. So it's tough for me to find adequately flavorful recipes, or when I see Mexican food recipes posted but it ends up being more Tex-Mex. Anyways,  I'm from San Diego and based on the food in my town, I feel this recipe really lacks flavor.

So so so yummy! My family raved about it and my teenager even had seconds which hardly happens! I made it exactly as written except I added one beef bullion cube to the water and a packet of dry onion soup. I also added about 1-2 cloves of minced garlic. I also put it in slow cooker on low for 12 hours (overnight) and then kept it on warm until dinner was ready. The meat just fell apart and was so flavorful! Put it on top of egg noddles with a side of steamed veggies and you have a nice, filling Sunday dinner :)

My husband called this dish major league. I substituted cream of celery soup because I was out of cream of mushroom. It worked just fine. I served with the gravy over mashed potatoes!

This was great!  Gravy was plentiful and delicious.  The meat was definitely tender.  I seared the meat on the stove top prior to putting it in the slow cooker just to get that added savory flavor.  Also, I did not have cream of mushroom soup on hand but did have golden mushroom.  I will definitely make this again and use the cream of mushroom soup just to see the difference.

I didn't know what London Broil was when I bought it but it was cheap and I figured I'd find a recipe online. This was a good one! 
I started with 3/4 of a white onion sliced thinly covering the entire bottom of the crock pot.  I added a can of sliced mushrooms with the juices and some carrots.  Afterwards I took the meat and vegetables out, added some cornstarch paste and turned the juices into gravy to put over redskin garlic mashed potatoes. 
My crock pot is quite large so I didn't need to cut down the meat to make it fit. When I put the ingredients in, I sprinkled all the spices right onto the meat and when I added the cream of mushroom soup I put it directly on the meat and spread it over the meat so it could soak into the meat. I think putting the soup strategically on-top of the meat was the key to making the meat tender. 
7 hours on low was the perfect timing. Once I started it I never lifted the lid, all the ingredients I put in at the start. It worked well for me, and the meat fell apart. Perfect meal for a cold February dinner.

Easy and delicious. I tenderized the meat first and beat it so it would be extra tasty. Didn't add salt and it was perfect!! Made twice already!!

This was a good recipe. A lot like pot roast. But not really anything special. We would not make this recipe again with a london broil. Would probably use a chuck roast instead.

This is a very good and very easy recipe. However, please be aware it is more like a pot roast than a steak. Not that there's anything wrong with that! My family enjoyed it very much served with mashed potatoes and a sals.

This recipe didn't work for me- the meat was incredibly dry. The only change I made was reducing cook time by an hour because I always have to do that with my slow cooker.  At least the mushroom liquid was yummy.

I used about a 2lb piece of london broil that was still partially frozen and cut it in 3 large pieces. I did not add water, but did add a tablespoon of steak sauce and worcestershire and a pack of dry onin soup mix. I cooked on high for 1 hour and then low for 7 hours. Delicious, tender and the gravy was just right, not too watery. Would definitely make again!

This is really good and really easy.  I did have to omit the garlic because I live with a vampire, but otherwise I followed the instructions.  I served it over egg noodles with sourdough bread and roasted asparagus.  What an excellent, easy meal.

The meat does indeed fall apart but is very dry. I used the creamed condensed soup I had on hand (cream of onion) and the sauce tasted wonderful.  There are just some meats that don't need to go in the slow cooker and London Broil is one of them.

this was good.  I mixed the mushroom soup with a can of water.  i think next time, i'll keep the slower cooker lid slightly ajar as the "gravy" got watered down.  added some corn starch to thicken gravy, dashes of sugar/salt and served over mashed potatoes.  easy comfort food.

UPDATE 8/21/2017: this time I made recipe as written with only one change: the addition of Lipton onion soup mix. We all agreed too salty but otherwise well-liked. Will repeat next time with onion soup but no salt. Creates a tasty gravy - served with white rice, but maybe next time egg noodles or even biscuits? 
[ORIGINAL REVIEW: I had a 2-lb. London Broil in the freezer, and based on the size plus some reviews I opted to double the soup and water.  I used garlic powder because I was out of fresh, and Italian seasoning because I was out of basil.  Cooked on low in the crock pot for 8 hours, then shredded the meat into the gravy and changed the setting to "warm" while I finished other parts of the meal.  Served with mashed potatoes and noodles to accommodate some picky eaters in my group.  (I was hoping it would turn out like stroganoff, but would have needed to mix in some sour cream and paprika I think.)  We all thought it was fine/okay. I would try to match the recipe more exactly to give it another chance.]

This was delicious!  After reading the reviews, I decided to season the london broil with salt and pepper first.  It was flavorful and super tender.  We had just enough leftovers for my husband  to take for lunch the next day.  I will definitely make it again.

The meat was very tender but my husband was disappointed with the flavor, thought it was too bland.  I would recommend marinating the meat in some spices 12-24 hours prior to cooking.

Used 2 cans of golden mushroom soup, omitted water. Cooked all day in my ninja, boiled potatoes and carrot to serve with it. Wonderful recipe will be making again and again!

I raced right on in here after dinner this evening to see what it was I forgot in this recipe, because after reading all of the glowing reviews yesterday, I was convinced I made this incorrectly. I put in all of the ingredients to spec, cooked it on low for seven hours and the meat came out all moist and tender, so I have no complaints there. What was lacking is flavor. The taste of the egg noodles I served this with was stronger than the gravy, that's how bland it was. The only change I made was adding a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce prior to cooking. Crazy. At any rate, three stars because the meat did come out very tender and BF said, "It's pretty good!" It's very possible that it's just me but y'all may want to consider spicing this one up a bit.

I made it exactly as written.  I and my Hubby and our daughter all liked it, but we felt it could use a bit more flavor.  Next time I will try the additions in Cindy's review.

This was quick and easy to make.  Since I don't like mushrooms, I substituted cream of celery soup and added 1 tsp beef boullion.  Also, since I like cooking with wine, I only added half the water and an equal amount of red wine.  It made a nice gravy to serve over noodles.

This was super dry!  It was falling part but more out of flakiness rather than tenderness.

The gravy that was produced from the drippings however was nice!

Mmmm Delicious! The family loved it and using the crock pot liner did make it easy to clean- up afterward. Now, to ppl that did get a tender London broil... Several of you didn't follow the directions. By this I mean in cooking "time". You can add or take away items but I don't think you should change the length of time and then leave a negative review. It just doesn't seem fair.

London Broil for the Slow Cooker Haiku: "DANG this was super. Fall-apart and delicious. Great use for cheap meat!" Only thing that I did differently was rub the meat (mine was 2.5 lbs.) w/ a leftover half-envelope of dry onion soup mix that was sitting lonely in the pantry. My husband wanted to strain the liquid after 7 hrs. into a pot w/ some cornstarch to thicken it more into a gravy, but we ended up being just as happy pouring every bit of the mushroomy-juice over the meat and our side of mashed potatoes.

It was delicious!  I don't care for mushroom soup so I added a can of beef gravy and a packet of beef flavoring. It is not a broth just a packet.  However, the recipe is great just as it is. I liked the idea of onion soup added in but I didn't have any.  The beef fell apart and what is left over I am going to make into a stew.

I would have given this 5 stars, HOWEVER cooking it for more than 4 hours COMPLETELY OVERCOOKS this BIG TIME!  (The first time I made it, I cooked it the time recommended, and it was tough and DRY DRY DRY!)  Four hours was PERFECT!  Served it with peas and Mashed potatoes.  Nom nom nom!

This is easy and my family loved it. Per the suggestions, I also served it over egg noodles. I will say that you should cook it at LEAST 7 hours, anything less and it seems tough and chewy.  Also, I have a big family, and had to almost triple the recipe, and you need to add more cook time if there is more london broil

Took the advice of another and added 1 cup of beef broth to make more gravy. Which also thinned it down a little. Cooked the first 3 hours on high and then turned to low for the remaining 5 hours.  Family LUVED it.  This is a keeper

This could not be easier or more delicious. We put it in the pot in the fridge overnight so that in the morning all I had to do was put it in the crock, plug it in and leave it while I went to work. I think next time I might double the ingredients, other than the meat, so I will have more sauce. We had it with couscous and broccoli.

The first time I try a submitted recipe, I prefer, as closely as possible, to make it as submitted.  With this recipe I used a larger cut of meat and doubled the recipe.  Unfortunately, I only had two cans of soup and needed one for another dish.  I substituted a can of beef gravy and left out the water.  The meat was awesome.  Firm yet fork tender and quite flavorful. This will definitely be at the top of my slow cooker recipe box.

This recipe is very good and very easy!  We will make again for sure.  The meat comes out very tender.  My only criticism is that there wasn’t enough sauce.  Next time I will add more soup and more water so that there is more sauce.  Kinda tastes like beef stroganoff.  I served it over egg noodles.  Yummy!

I made this last night, turned out pretty good. I did think it needed more spices then what the recipe called for, was a bit bland. 
I made it just like the picture with mashed potatoes and organic baby peas. That is comfort food for me :)

Anything with condensed soup as part of an ingredient is a HUGE turn off for me!  Good thing I found a recipe to make it from scratch that tastes soooo much better!  This recipe only got a 4 because of the soup....but with the homemade, the recipe is definately a five!  

With the changes, It will be a repeat that's for sure!

I loved this! I followed the recipe and made open faced sandwiches with them. The sauce was perfect on top. Will be making this again!

Great Recipe Yvonne, Thanks! My hubby really liked it. After dinner he told me that "this ones a keeper, this is my kind of meal". The only thing I did different is I added 1/4 c more water and added 1/2 tsp beef bullion granules to the water before adding to the crock pot. YUM! 
I served with Mashed Potatoes, using the soup cooked in as gravy, Buttered Brussel Sprouts, and biscuits.

Awesome -- cooked two london broils with bay leaf, no basil.  Water I think is too much, I'd cut in half.  Also I added a can of mushrooms with the other ingredients.  Cooked 8 hours on low.

My whole family loved this recipe, the only thing I changes was the London broil.  We had steaks that were very tough so I cubed them and add them to the mix; it turned out like a beef stroganoff and the meat was so tender!  It was delicious and has been made many times! Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm not much for improvising so I tried the recipe as is and we all thought it was delicious. Makes good gravy too.

Very good. I normally just put the london broil in the crock pot and pour a can of cream of mushroom soup and an can of french onion soup in it. Thats good too but I like this recipe much better. The spices really give it a little something different. Very good and simple!

This was an easy dinner to prepare before going to work.  My family wasn't wild about it, but I thought it was good.  I slow cooked the London Broil for 8 hours and it was very tender.  The sauce was good, but it needed a little something.  I think I'll play with it and try it again.

Drop the spices. Only use london broil, golden cream of mushroom and 1 Pepsi (not diet Pepsi). Makes the BEST brown gravy ever. 8hrs. on Low.

I made this the other night and the only thing that I changed was that I used cream of celery soup because my husband doesn't like mushrooms...but I added mushrooms to my plate whe I server it and I added 4 cloves of garlic (because we LOVE it)  but it was amazing. I served it over rice and we had no leftovers at all and that is rare in our house!!! AMAZING!

Followed the recipe exactly. The meat came out tender however a little dry.
