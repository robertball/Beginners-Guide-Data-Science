These turned out great! I didn't want to make a special trip to the Asian market for dried prawn for such a small amount so I substituted with diced up cooked shrimp. I dipped mine in soy sauce but hubby chose sweet chile sauce and said it was excellent with these too. I would have liked more sesame oil flavor and will add more next time. Excellent recipe!
