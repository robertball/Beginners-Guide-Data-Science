You’ll never get a good emulsion with the ratio of ingredients in this recipe.This recipe does not totally incorporate all of the vinaigrette ingredients, it separates into layers.   This has equal parts lime and orange juice and then “zested orange.”  Is this supposed to be an orange vinaigrette or a lime vinaigrette?  I mixed this up as written except for using lime zest instead of orange, and it still had very little lime flavor, so I added more lime juice.  The dominating flavor is the herbes de provence, and IMO, there’s a little too much of it in this dressing.  Do give this some time in the fridge, it will  improve the flavor.  I make all of my own salad dressings, and this one was a bit of a disappointment.  David Hall, sorry for the less than favorable first review of your recipe.

Modified this based off lutzflcat's review. I scaled the recipe to half. Used only lime juice- no orange so I doubled it. Lime zest. No herbs de Provence so I subbed mrs dash herb and garlic.  Shook it in a ball jar and it was darn tasty!!!

I really can't give a fair review of the recipe since I only followed it loosely after reading other reviews. The dressing I made was very good. I halved it, using exclusively lime juice and zest (omitting the orange). I used dried oregano, fresh cracked pepper,  and one clove of garlic (minced) instead of herbs de Provence. I also used seasoned rice vinegar.  At the end I tasted it and thought it needed a little more lime juice and zest. It turned out great!
