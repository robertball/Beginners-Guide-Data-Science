I used this recipe for fajitas for lunch a couple of days ago.  I did add some garlic powder and they turned out very well.  It didn't have as much flavor as I expected but good.  Thanks for the post.

I loved the lime flavor in this recipe that made it different from any other flank steak recipe I've tried. I'll definitely make it again

I left out the oregano.  I let it marinate about 24 hours and than popped it on the grill we used it for fajitas
