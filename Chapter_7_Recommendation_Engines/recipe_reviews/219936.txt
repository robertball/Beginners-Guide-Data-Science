This soup is amazing! I made it about 5 times in 4 weeks and everyone was raving about it. I tweaked the recipe each time and this is my recommendations:
1. use 1 can of coconut milk, not 2. Using 2 totally dilutes the flavors. 
2. I add 2 kafir lime leaves, for an authentic Thai flavor. 
3. Instead of straining the broth, I use a large infuser ball and keep the garlic, ginger, lime leaves and lemon grass inside,and keep it in the finished soup product so the soup gets as much kick as possible. 
4. For a one pot cooking method, I sautee mushrooms in the oil, add fish sauce, and then add the broth/infuser ball (with garlic, ginger, lemon grass and lime leaves). After adding the broth, I added an entire boneless chicken leg/thigh and let it cook in the broth. After chicken is cooked, I removed it, shredded it and added it back to the pot. Then I added 1 can of coconut milk, curry paste, lime juice. Finish by garnishing with red onions, cilantro, jalapeno slices and lime wedge garnish.

This recipe was delicious.  There is something missing from the recipe, in step #5 it says to add the lime juice, but nowhere in the ingredients is lime juice listed other then the limes for garnishment.  I used 2 tablespoons because I found another thai recipe similiar to this one and that's what it called for.  Other then that, I followed this recipe to a T, and it was wonderful.  Although, next time I would like a little more heat and will use serrano peppers instead of jalapenos.  Also, this is a light soup recipe, and if your looking to make it more hearty try using basmati rice or glass noodle with it.  They are both great.  Thanks for sharing, will be using this often.

Seriously delicious and very filling. Two minor changes: (i) 1 1/2 lbs. of skinless, boneless chicken thighs & 1 lb. chicken tenderloins rather than all thighs, and (ii) 4 tsp. red curry paste rather than 2 tsp. Chef John’s video for making this soup is worth watching, and apparently reflects the original way he made it versus this version seemingly altered by AR slightly. Great recipe, great soup . . . grand slam homer, Chef John.

Make it easy on yourself and use Gourmet Garden. 1/2 tube minced ginger, 1/2 tube minced lemon grass, 4 tsp minced garlic, you will still need to strain it.  I went to 3 stores before finding the red curry paste, and it really didn't add much spice.  I would substitute ground red pepper and use a lot of it as the coconut milk neutralizes spice.  I used 3 chicken breasts, and added 2 fresh tomatoes sliced at the end of the cooking.  The fresh limes, and fresh cilantro are an absolute must.  Oh yeah, the fish sauce is disgusting, so just use a little salt.  Serve with jasmine rice or rice noodles.  This soup is every bit as good as what I have had in restaurants in Hawaii, Key West, and Miami.  The first time I tried it, I reported to my mom that I just had the most awakening soup that tasted of chicken, lime, and milk.  Bizarre, but it totally works.

Just tried, written directions left out a couple steps, so watch the video (when to add prepared stock and how much lime juice (you squeeze two limes, and stock goes in just before coconut milk)). I loved it and I only like mild spice. I agree with another reviewer, the Thai Kitchen red curry paste is good, but I actually had to add more, and I only used 1 can of coconut milk! But this was very good with brown rice.  Next time I will try the light coconut milk.

I started making soup every Sunday for football season so I am standing in front of a TV watching the Red Zone instead of sitting in front of a TV. I made this soup last Sunday and will make it many times again in the future. The only thing I changed was adding twice the red chili paste like other reviewers, sliced shiitake mushrooms, more broth, and cooked longer because I wanted the red onions softer. It was a challenge trimming the fat off the chicken thighs but worth the flavor and moistness breasts do not give. I appreciated Chef John's tip straining out the ginger, lemon grass, garlic cooking in chunks and using the lite and regular coconut milk. I served it with 1/4 cup basmati rice. This was so tasty it was gone in two days. I am making Chef John's gumbo today. Go Colts!!!!

I made this last night for my in-laws who are "foodies" and members of gourmet clubs. They absolutely raved about this recipe and wanted to know where I got it. They both said it tasted "restaurant worthy". I am not an experienced chef so I like recipes that aren't too complicated. This recipe is not complicated but I do recommend watching the video as I found it very helpful to watch the steps being performed. The grocery store I went to didn't have fresh lemon grass so I bought the minced lemon grass that is sold in a tube. One tube equals 6 lemon grass stalks so I squeezed half of the tube into the chicken broth. It was perfect and I doubt I'll use fresh lemon stalk in the future. Also, I used 3/4 teaspoon red curry paste and the soup was not spicy at all. When I cook it just for me and my husband, I will kick it up a notch. Thank you for sharing such an awesome recipe! Love it and will be making this from here on out.

This is very close to the Authentic Tom Yum soup we made in a cooking class in Thailand. Fabulous! We added 4x the amount of red curry paste and it wasn't very hot, but very flavorful. Love this recipe! A great alternative to boring chicken noodle soup!

I had some problems with the recipe.  First, despite using less chicken than recommended, I ended up needing to add extra broth as there wasn't enough liquid.  Second, even with the extra broth, it was almost impossible to skim the top of fat, as my spoon kept running into chicken pieces and vegetables.  Third, I really think the chicken should be more seasoned on its own, either with some kind of marinade or rub or at least in the skillet with salt and pepper.  Finally, I wonder if maybe the garlic, lemongrass, and ginger should stay in the soup rather than being discarded.  The soup I ended up with was very bland, other than the jalapeno slices, and they were just random heat since they were put in at the end as garnish.  I will admit I did not use the cilantro as I strongly dislike it.  This is the second "spicy" "Thai" soup I've made from Allrecipes that has been bland.  I have a few others to try, but I'm thinking I might have to make up my own recipe.

So tasty!!!  I used chicken stock instead of broth, added a little salt, doubled the red curry paste, minced the garlic and left it in the stock.  I placed the lemongrass and ginger in a colander, boiled them in the chicken stock, and removed the colander after 30 minutes.  I also used 3 lbs of chicken thighs and had plenty of broth for each serving.   I love, love, love the flavor!!  Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe! I made it as it's written the first few time, then I made changes the 4th time I made it. I like it with my changes better as I think it has more flavor, more health benefits and it saves time. I start with cooking my chicken in the pot. I peel my ginger and garlic and throw them in my vitamix until they are very finely minced. When the chicken is fully cooked, I throw the minced ginger, garlic, red curry paste, and lemongrass from the tube in there until well coated. Then I add the chicken broth and coconut milk and bring it a boil, simmer on low for 30 mins. This way, instead of taking 50 mins to make, it only takes 30 but the flavor of the lemon grass, ginger and garlic is even stronger! And you get the health benefits of eating those whole foods. Hope this was helpful to some of you! :)

Was delicious served over jasmine rice. Used 1.5 lbs. chicken thighs and 1 lb. chicken breast. The thighs were definitely more flavorful. Red curry paste was not hot; had to triple the amount to get any heat. Overall, a good recipe.

There are few recipes that I get really excited about, that I can't stop talking about. I LOVE this soup. I will make it again and again.  I did not use the jalapenos as I found the red curry paste hot enough, but I don't like more than a bit of heat. I learned when I made it for a friend (beforehand, thankfully) who is allergic to shellfish that red curry paste usually has shrimp paste in it but a) it is possible to find it without, and b) green curry paste could be a decent substitute. Fish sauce is made of anchovies and I'd suggest that you give it a try if you haven't before, as it keeps it more authentically Thai. (Another reviewer was less enthusiastic.) The lime juice mentioned as missing by another reviewer is now indeed listed. Also the big reason to discard the lemongrass, garlic and ginger is that lemongrass is very fibrous and you don't want that in your soup. It's hard to pick it out later. Trust me, I have experience. But by the time you saute those ingredients and simmer them in the stock, they have done their job. With the lemongrass, chop off the top 1/3 and set aside for a different application, and put the bottom 2/3 in a little food processor and you will quickly be ready to saute. Finally, at the end you can add cooked rice, rice noodles, lightly steamed broccoli, or any vegetables you want to add more bulk but it is great on its own. And don't plan on much else for your meal, as a good hearty bowl is very filling. Well done Chef John!

Great, but WAY too much fish sauce!  I thought 3 tablespoons seemed like a lot, but wanted to follow the recipe to a T.  Yeah... it's too much.  Your hands and breath will smell like you've been eating... not coconut soup.  Next time, I'll only do 1.5 tablespoons.  But don't get me wrong, fish sauce is ESSENTIAL to a coconut soup, as is lemongrass.  Another reviewer said this was bland, but they must have skipped some ingredients, because with fresh lemongrass and fish sauce, there's no way it would be bland!

I really love the thai coconut soups with lime juice.  This one is as good as I have had locally in restaurants.  Thank you for the great recipe!!

Just wanted to note that our thai red curry paste (from Thai Kitchen) was not spicy at all.  It was very flavorful, but in our case the thing that added the "heat" were the jalapenos added (with seeds) just before eating.  Anyways, a  delightful and fun recipe to make.   Definitely look forward to doing this one again.

The soup was very bland when I was finished with it (and I added a chopped jalapeno). 

I added more red thai paste, also added back in the "strained off" garlic, lemongrass and ginger" (I minced mine very fine) ... now we're getting somewhere. I also added some rice. 

 After all the tweaks it tasted pretty good...

This was just excellent as is.  I don't review a recipe unless I make it as written.  I am am sensitive to spicy foods now that I am older, but this needed more red curry paste, so be prepared to add more.  I did not use the Jalapeno, but that was optional.  I threw in some Asian vermicelli noodles when it finished.  It made no change in taste at all.

Loved it.  made my own red curry paste and used the whole 2 tsp.  Add broth right before coconut milk.  I used chicken breast but actually grilled marinated slices and cubed.  Marinated in olive oi, curry and garlic powder.  Wanted to compensate for not using the thigh meat.

I am new to Thai foods and flavors, and this was a perfect way to explore some of these tastes and ingredients.  
 
I could not find lemongrass, so I used the zest of one lemon. 

I also doubled the amount of red curry paste as others suggested. I used Thai Kitchen Red Curry Paste which was not spicy at all as the video suggested. I wonder if he meant "Red Chili Paste"? 

This was really delicious and full of flavor. I am not an experienced cook, but even I was able to make this. I'll make it again for sure!

Ok this is my 3rd or 4th time to make this. I like it ok but husband did not. Tonight he liked it and the basic recipe is the same but  I put 1 head of garlic into 48 oz broth along with double the ginger, lemongrass paste (all I had) and a jalepeno and cooked it all about 30 minutes. Cooked the chicken (3 lbs) in peanut oil (all I had) added the mushrooms (lots), fish sauce, 3 cans coconut milk,  juice of 2 limes, 1 JAR red curry (Thai Kitchen is a small jar and not hot at all), 4 tsp sugar and cooked till chicken was done then added the onions and some sliced jalapenos and left it till wilted. Served with cilantro, jalapenos,  thai basil (made it soo much better), lime and green onions. My husband said it was great! I think it was better too. It is not sweet but it just tastes better.

My husband surprised me by making this for me one evening and it is now a regular meal.  It is especially nice if you are feeling a bit under the weather.  He makes it as is with the addition of rice vermicelli.  I serve it with fresh thai shrimp and veggie wraps on the side and they actually taste great dipped in the soup.

Excellent!  I made the recipe as described except used breast instead of thighs.  While boiling the lemon grass, ginger, and garlic I got a little busy which resulted in a reduction of liquid from 4 cups to less than 2 cups. With a reduced broth, the flavours BURST out of the pot when finished!  Probably one of my favourite soups of all time!

cut this down to 3 servings since it was just me and bf.. i wouldn't call this spicy with the recipe as is.. but after tripling the curry and adding a teaspoon of garlic chili sauce.. it met my expectations.. used a whole lime and half of a lemon.. didn't have any jalapeno so used serrano instead.. ty for the recipe.. ~~UPDATE: it was two years ago when i first tried this recipe and i'm wondering how i made it work back then.. i cut the recipe in half again.. and when i was making the broth this time i felt like it needed more liquid.. so i added another cup of chicken broth.. i used 12 oz of cut up pork chops in place of the 1 1/4 lb chicken.. i salted and peppered while sauteeing the pork, but i agree with another reviewer that it would have been better to have marinated the meat.. i subbed 1 1/2 tsp of curry powder for the paste.. and subbed 2 green onions for the 1/2 red onion.. i added 1 tablespoon of garlic chili sauce.. i used the juice and zest of one lime.. also used light coconut milk.. it was still good but i felt like it was missing something

I made this tonight.  It is as easy as it is tasty.  I am vegetarian so I  made the usual swaps.   Like others I added more curry paste (double).  But other than that, I followed it to the letter.  Fab!!!  I highly recommend watching Chef Johns video as it makes it even easier.
Will definitely make again.

What a lovely soup.  So many flavors!  Based on another review and after tasting the Thai Kitchen Red Curry Paste (no heat at all) I doubled the amount and added a healthy four teaspoons and it added a nice warmth.  I also used a serrano pepper instead of a jalapeno as that's what was in the fridge.  I'm looking forward to having the remainder of this over brown rice tonight.  I'll most certainly be making this soup again.  Excellent recipe!!!

Lovely base soup i would make a few changes. I poached the chicken in the broth .
Only added 1 can of coconut milk or it would have been very bland.  I would add 4 tbs of curry paste next time and more lime juice and keep with the 3 tbs of fish sauce .

great recipe, made it yesterday on a whim. super easy to follow.  like many other reviews, i would  also suggest watching the video. the fish sauce was a bit too strong for our liking, i would try halfing the amount and just seasoning with salt to taste. i will definately  be making this again.

Amazing!Perfect balance of flavors. The only thing I have to mention, which I read in other reviews is ...the curry paste isn't very spicy. I added about 2 to 3 times what the recipe called for. Other than that, a keeper! Thanks again, Chef John!

This is the Bomb! Add just a bit of Kefir lime leaves to make it perfect! (A teaspoon of brown sugar gives it a bit if a sweet edge too!).

Like all the other reviewers, I thought this soup was excellent! A number of people mentioned that the Thai Red Curry Paste did not add enough heat. I think this is because most folks use the overpriced Thai Kitchen Red Curry Paste found in most grocery stores. Big mistake!! Go to Amazon.com and search for Mae Ploy Thai Red Curry Paste. (Be sure to read the reviews.) Much better value for your money and MUCH better quality, with complex and authentic Thai seasoning. Trust me, you will not complain about the soup not being spicy enough. If you do much Thai cooking, this is the item to have on hand, as well as other types of of Thai pastes. (I assume these are also available in specialty food markets, Whole Foods, etc.)

OMG, I think I am going to cry!  I tried this soup in a restaurant years ago and have not been able to duplicate it-until now!  Thank you so much for this incredible recipe. I served it over brown rice- my family loves it. 
Thank you, thank you!

Made this vegetarian using Extra firm tofu.  I have not concocted a veggie fish sauce.  So, I had to go with just soy sauce.  It changes the recipe I know.  But we really liked it anyway.

Fantastic soup as is, but found using one can of coconut milk was fine (instead of two). And to the person who said to use half a tube of Gourmet Garden lemongrass and half a tube of Gourmet Garden minced ginger... Do you realize that equals over 20 tsps of each? I agree it is okay to use the tube stuff, but you only need a few tsp, not half a tube! That would ruin the soup for sure.

I'm rating this again as I was unable to edit my original review for some odd reason.  

*Definitely do not use three tablespoons of fish sauce.  I would either use one tablespoon, or none at all.  Also, as a lover of all things hot and spicy, the red curry paste does not add much, if any, heat.  I used half of the jar and it still had almost no heat.  In my opinion, it only adds flavor.  If you like heat, go ahead and use the curry paste for flavor and buy some chili paste for heat :)

This soup was great! I used two cans of light coconut milk and chicken breast and I don't think it compromised the flavor at all. The supermarket ran out of red curry paste so I used green. I did not get the level of spice that the recipe predicted (or that I wanted) so I added two jalapenos instead of one. Overall this soup was delicious. I served over rice noodles.

I was craving spicy Thai soup so decided to try this recipe .  I made it almost exactly as written, except I used about 1/2 the fish sauce listed (and next time I may use even less since that flavor was a bit strong) and  added about 1/2 tsp of Sambal Oelek (Thai spicy chili sauce) for heat - which I think it needed.  I also used a small amount of grilled chicken breast that I had as leftovers and that worked great (the original recipe seems very heavy on the chicken).    I think I would add some additional veggies to it - maybe red pepper, and possibly some rice noodles to bulk it up - but I really enjoyed the flavor of the broth!   Definitely a good recipe.

This is delicious! I wanted a 1 pot method so I did the chicken, curry paste, fish sauce, garlic, mushroom cooked first then transferred to plate. For broth I minced my ginger very fine then cut lemon grass to bruise for flavor and put that in a cheese cloth tied. Added to broth with Kefer lime leaves simmered as noted then added back the chicken mixture with the coconut milk, I did add dried chili pepper to broth we like it very spicy. Thank you for a great recipe

This chicken thai soup is amazingly delicious as it is. I usually offer rice along with it and usually add extra red curry paste as we like it hot. I've made it a dozen times and it always turns out perfect!

Really good, but chef John highly oversold the red curry paste. I doubled the amount he specified and it still wasn't very  spicey. The jalapenos recommended for the garnish saved the day. I will make it again, but add a couple of unseeded sliced jalapenos with the onions at the end.

This is really good.  Don't make the mistake my hubby made and buy sugar-free coconut milk!!  I did a taste test  after making it  was  definitely missing something.   I felt it seriously needed sugar and my hubby mentioned he'd bought sugar-free.  I didn't notice when adding it to the recipe, so I had to add at least 1/3 cup of sugar before it tasted like it had the right amount.  This soup needs a nice balance of spicy, sweet and sour to taste right.   I used 4 stalks of lemon grass and it was perfect. I had to add at least 2 tablespoons of red curry paste and it still was not spicy but the additional curry paste really enhanced the flavor.  The sliced jalapenos took care of the spicy.  My whole family really loved this soup, however, we all agreed it would probably be better with shrimp in place of chicken thigh meat, which I will try next time.  All in all it is a very delicious recipe.  Just don't get sugar-free coconut milk!  Do as Chef John suggest in the video and get "one regular coconut milk and one light coconut milk".

All I can say is WOW! I had no idea what I could expect with all of these very different ingredients but they came together like a symphony playing Mozart. I made this exactly following the recipe. I do believe that Chef John exaggerated the heat from the curry. I love heat but this is not overly spicy at all. Probably one of the most perfectly balanced dishes I have ever made.  Each ingredient compliments the others so well that you can't really pick any one flavor out. They all come together in perfect harmony. If you can't tell, I love this soup.

Loved this!  Took it to a dinner party of friends, it was a hit with all.  Did not have fresh lemongrass at the store, used the paste in tube like another reviewer suggested, worked beautifully.  Used baby bella shrooms.  I also really like the red curry paste and added a bit more than recipe called for (doubled it!); forgot to buy a jalapeño pepper but the curry paste gave enough heat.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly...easy, simple, delicious!!  Will definitely make this again!  Thanks for sharing Chef!!

I made this. It was easy to make. But it was awful. It does not taste at all like Thai soup that I had in Thailand. Was talking to others that made it and they said it was bitter too. They though they did something wrong. But no we all did the same thing and it taste just like fish. Will not be doing this again.

I made this recipe and the fish sauce completely overpowered the soup. I tried to add more Coconut milk, but in the end I threw the whole pot out. DO NOT put 3 tablespoons of fish sauce in this recipe... it ruined it. I may try again, but I am frustrated that this recipe was so bad.

I loved this. I used a vidalia onion instead of a red onion. Used portabella mushrooms instead of white mushrooms. I left out the cilantro since I hate cilantro. The chicken is added raw and cooked in the soup. Served the soup over pad Thai noodles, and squeezed 2 lime wedges into each bowl.

Fairly bland.  I did not cover the pot while simmering the broth with the aromatics and I would recommend doing as so I did not end up with much broth left to mix with the coconut milk.

This was a wonderful recipe! I followed Chef John's steps and recommendations, and this turned out so delicious! We did up the amount of red curry paste, as we like things spicy, but that was the only difference. I had never made Thai food before, but this was so simple and satisfying that I may have found a new avenue to explore. We have been on a real soup kick, and this will be added to the regular rotation. Awesome! Thank you, Chef John, for yet another easy and delicious recipe! Five stars!

This recipe was alright but really needed some help in my opinion. I thought it was a bit bland. I would at least double the fish sauce and add another teaspoon of the curry paste.

Subtle and complex flavours all at the same time, not too spicy even after adding an additional 3 teaspoons of the red curry paste, also upped the fish sauce by a tablespoon and added a cup of frozen shrimp at the end. The fresh lime juice made all the difference, perhaps adding galangal or kafir lime leaves in the future? Will try next time. A fantastic recipe, thnx for sharing!

Delicous! I added some extra chicken (~2.5lbs total) and sliced carrots to the mixture for some color and a chunkier soup. My local grocer only had the lemon grass in a tube but that worked well too. Also, didnt find it all that spicy (was heavy-handed with the curry too!) so it could be kicked up if you wanted more. I loved this - will absolutely make it again!

amazing!It is an almost exact match to my fave thai soup-tom kha pak
I substiti
uted shrimp and removed them as soon as they were cooked so as to prevent them from becoming rubbery/overcooked.used only 2 tbsp fish sauce and 2cans of light cocnut milk
when I added the onion I also added some red and yellow diced peppers and a pinch of red pepper flakes and a tbsp of brown sugar.
adding a cup of diced pineapple really makes this soup more awesome! next time i will probably add some slivered carrots when i saute the mushrooms for more veggie oomph :)

Awesome soup!  I will definitely make it again.  I will probably add a lot more red curry paste and also increase the amount of lemongrass/ginger/garlic, but that’s just because my family loves spicy foods.  Overall outstanding recipe, easy to follow, and relatively simple to make.

I have made this dish several times now. It is one of my husbands’ favorites. The changes I’ve made are that I use two heaping tablespoons of red curry paste (he likes it spicy) and I use 16 ounces of mushrooms. I have been canning lately and took a class. I asked the instructor if it would be possible to can this soup. She said it would be fine without the coconut milk and it would need to be pressure canned for the amount of time the chicken would take. I did so and it turned out pretty good. I think I would omit the chicken in the canning and add it with the coconut milk when reconstituting as it was a little dry.

Forget chicken noodle soup when you're sick, make this! Or when you're not sick....IT IS SO GOOD. I would choose this over my normal Thai place anyday. (except for the fact that it's always more fun dining out IMO)  anyways, this is my go to "Tom Kha Gai" soup. It's perfect. I add brown rice noodles in it to give it more texture and make it more filling. Then I spice it up A TONNNNN. I don't think the Thai red curry paste is hot at all? Hottest paste known to man. Uhhhh no....anyways stop reading the comments and just go make this!!!!!

My guest and I thoroughly enjoyed the taste of the soup.  However, I was expecting the red curry paste to empart some spicy heat into the flavor profile and it didn't.  I also substituted lemon grass paste for fresh lemon grass.  I think I used approx. 2+ Tbsp.   All in all a delicious dinner and look forward to making it again.

Excellent, authentic-tasting soup. I've made it with stalks of lemongrass diced and with that lemongrass paste you can get at some grocery stores in the produce section. Both were very good.

Rich, flavorful, terrific soup!   We used one can of Coconut milk (as someone else suggested) and doubled the Red Curry paste (I like the heat!) and it suited us just fine.   We used only half  the amount of the chicken the recipe called for and it was hardly missed.  We used the zest of one lemon since there was no lemongrass available.  Perfect.  :)

Awesome! I did the one pot version and had the spices in a diffuser to keep them in the entire process. I also used whole boneless chicken thighs. Turned out fantastic! Some kefir lime leaves or galangal root would make it even better if you can find them.

This dish is called Kao soi in thai, it's not meant to be a soup but rather meant to be eaten with wide rice noodles.  As a soup it's a bit too rich with the coconut milk so I ate it with rice.  It makes Alot so will try it with potatoes tomorrow.  Also I like heat so added more chili's to help cut through the richness.  Overall this was very tasty and pretty authentic KAO SOI.

I just saluted all the ingredients in a pan making it a one pot meal.( I had a hard time finding lemongrass I use the lemongrass teabags) you can find it at the evil empire) (Walmart)?? It was delicious my house smells like Thai. Since I'm the only one ( I live alone)  that likes spice I really went for it. I will take some to my service group for a better judgement of my cooking skills.

Fantastic!  I made it for my brother, and my sister-in-law came over and asked for more. I made it for my other brother, and he said, “You made this??! Tastes like it did in Thailand!”  (I did do a cooking course there). Next time I will make a double batch, although I used all organic ingredients, which makes it quite expensive, so if I make it for other people I will just use regular chicken and vegetables. 
 I made a few changes:  because I like the savoury umami of mushrooms but not mushrooms themselves, I put the mushrooms in to boil with the stock and  lemongrass and garlic. I threw away the lemongrass and garlic, and gave the mushrooms to my brothers. 
 The recipe suggested steaming broccoli to serve with it, and I thought it needed more vegetables, so to be a more of a hearty meal, I added steamed broccoli, plus I julienned a carrot and about a third of a red pepper for colour.  I also had some vermicelli noodles, which I added, which also makes it go farther and makes it into more of a meal. 
 Because I was cooking for my daughter who doesn’t like things too spicy, I started off with the minimum half a teaspoon of the red curry paste, but since this was not hot enough for me, I added some harissa (same as sriracha or sambal olek,  you could probably also throw in Frank’s hot sauce for that matter),  and did garnish with extra cilantro and jalapeños.  While I don’t like the smell of fish sauce when it’s cooking, it does give it that authentic slight fish taste at the

This tastes like an authentic Thai soup and could probably be made with shrimp you’d like.  It could use more of something, as it’s not very spicy at all.  I will be making this again, but next time I will try adding some Chiles.

Delicious but not as spicy as I'd like, next time I make it I'll put in a lot more curry paste and maybe some chili powder.

Not sure what went wrong, but it tasted watered down with very little spiciness. Added half jar of Thai red curry paste, but no heat. (Maybe got a bad jar?)
Recipe was easy, but still didn’t get much lemongrass or ginger. Tasted ok but bland. Wondering if water came out of chicken and diluted everything...

I've made this several times. I usually use chicken breast, and I like to use green onions, cilantro, and lime juice as garnishes rather than adding them to the whole pot.   For reasons I don't understand, my red chili paste has never been super hot as the video claims. 

This is a win!

Meh.  It came out OK, but I added much more curry paste, then boosted the spice with red pepper flake, garlic powder, and ground ginger.  The cilantro and jalapeno slices brought it together for OK.   Needs more depth of flavor...probably need to grate the ginger and garlic to get it IN the soup, know what I mean?

Great soup. I did make a few changes.
 1. I put the jalepeno in the broth with the lemon grass, garlic and ginger. This made the broth nice and spicey.
2. I used chicken breast instead of thigh and I also added pepper when cooking the chicken
3. I used 3 tsp of curry paste 
4. I used 1.5 cans of coconut milk.
5. I added vermicelli noodles to make it more hearty

I followed the recipe exactly and this turned out great. It was a learning experience. I had never cooked with some of the ingredients before. Lemongrass was the hardest ingredient to find but I did get it. One reviewer noted this is a light soup. It is. You’ll want to listen to some of the suggestions for sides if having this soup for dinner.

This soup was great! I watched the video as recommended and used several of the previous suggestions most importantly: only one can of coconut milk, used lemongrass from a tube, added tomatoes and more chili paste because we like things SPICY. We did use a lot of LIME juice at the time of serving. I was blown away that an entire red onion was in the soup. I didn't notice.

This is a WONDERFUL recipe! Reminds me of something you would find on a menu of a Thai or Vietnamese restaurant. I also added about 1/3 cup or so of rice to my bowl of soup. My curry paste was different than what Chef John used and wasn't as spicy, but still had a great flavor. I will add more of it next time to add more heat. I will be making this again soon. This was a simple, easy, one-pot-meal (aside from optional rice) that didn't take all night to make!

I used one can of coconut milk and this was absolutely amazing!  First time I made it with turkey breast and it was such a hit!  I tried Thai food for the first time a week ago, and fell in love, so I was determined to give this a try at home.  We served it with fresh cilantro, jalapeño, and lime wedges, along with a dollop of garlic chili paste like we had at the restaurant.  Wowzers!  The second time I made it this week I used a couple of chicken thighs for a bit more fat and finished the last 5 minutes with shelled deveined shrimp and it was TO DIE FOR!  Only real change I made was les coconut milk, and sort of marinate the meat in lime juice.  I probably triple the amount of lime juice.  Will make again and again.

Doubled the red curry paste, added more lime juice.  5 star rating, because slickness is personal taste and not a reflection of the quality of the recipe.  Will definitely make again!

We made this dish exactly how the recipe was written and we were very disappointed. The sauce never thickened, we had to remove the chicken and add flour to get it even remotely sauce-like. It was also so incredibly salty that it was physically painful to eat.

I used processed lemongrass (tube), and have also made this soup with pork shoulder. All my family loves it with or without tomatoes.

Tasted quite salty the first day - was better the second.  Agree with another reviewer to cut fish sauce in half.  I would also double curry paste next time.  Good recipe for Whole 30ers.

I had a soup similar to this in a restaurant and have been wanting it ever since.  Turned out fabulous; layer upon layer of flavour.
I made my own chicken stock using chicken backs and then used chicken breasts in the recipe.  I cut a small thai chilli pepper in half and simmered in the soup for a few min. then removed it.  I wanted some extra heat as the red curry paste at my grocery store was quite mild.

This soup was delicious. I could not find fresh lemongrass so I got a tube of puréed lemongrass at the supermarket. 1 tablespoon of the purée = 1 lemongrass stalk.  Also used green curry paste instead of red because that’s what was available. My only complaint is that the soup was not spicy at all. I doubled the curry paste and it still wasn’t spicy. If you like it spicy definitely go heavy on the curry paste.

I couldn't find lemon grass in our stores locally so used the paste instead but otherwise followed the recipe and got rave reviews from the retreat guests and shared the recipe. it was a little too spicy for my husband so next time I will not put quite as much red curry paste in it so he can enjoy this wonderful soup. Thank you Chef John!

I am vegetarian so I changed it up quite a bit but this was an awesome base recipe.  I used morning star chicken strips, no mushrooms, a bag of frozen Asian vegetables, somen noodles (although I added too many), lots of fresh jalapenos and scallions at the end.  Yummy!!!  Also, we are hoping all these great ingredients are going to kick the flu right out of our house :)

My first try at Thai and this turned out great. My husband loves heat but even with the thoughtful discussion in the video about being careful with the red curry I actually needed to add extra. Next time it will be four pepper hot!

Amazing!  I can't wait to make it again... next week.  Only changes I made was to use the lemon grass in a tube, I added Keefer limes leaves (which I had ground already), ran the onion, pepper, fresh ginger and garlic through the chopper and left them in the broth, no need to take them out.  Also cooked the chicken in the soup.  Served over an avocado with fresh lime juice and chopped cilantro.  Great dish and a wonderful change to chili on a cold evening.

I make this soup often.  I always add double the red curry paste.  I sometimes use dried lemon grass from Penzey's because lemongrass stalks are hard to find around here.  And I usually just use up left over chicken  and throw it in with the mushrooms.  I love it.

Had to make a couple changes followed some of the reviewers notes, used Chicken thigh/leg and just removed the meat after, keep the ginger, garlic, lemon grass infused as long as possible.  Had to triple the broth (only because my other half likes soup for the broth not the soup) Doubling it would have been fine.  Added extra curry paste, cooked the jalapeno's in the broth and added Red Thai Chili peppers whole to it for more color and spicy....Excellent soup.  Thank you for the recipe...

The soup was delicious, so don't take my three stars as against the taste. The reason this recipe gets such a low rating from me is twofold:

1) This really wasn't that spicy. I was disappointed in this.

2) The recipe directions are pretty terrible. Luckily, my SO figured it out because I would have gotten this all wrong.  This is a pretty big deal to me. If I knew what I was doing in the kitchen without a recipe, I wouldn't be looking online, would I?

I served this over jasmine rice and added upon my second helping. I did say it was delicious!

Delicious! I received rave reviews and requests for the recipe. After watching the video, I only used one teaspoon of red curry paste, but I think two would have been fine for me. It could have been spicer. Next time I'll use a red jalapeño as shown in one of the photos for that extra pop of color. This recipe is a keeper.

This is savoury and delicious!  I made a few additions/substitutions to suit our tastes.  After cooking diced chicken breasts,  I sautéed  the onions, garlic  and ginger in coconut oil for a few minutes, then instead of mushrooms, added matchstick carrots and red peppers to the onions and garlic.  I then added the rest of the spices and liquid ingredients, using a bit more lime juice than called for and  sriracha rather than fish paste.  During the last few minutes of simmering,  I added 2 cups of cooked coconut rice and finished it off with the chopped cilantro.  So yummy!

This is it!!! The recipe I was craving. The only changes I made was I doubled it and added more curry paste than he suggested. It was not to spicy at all. 
I highly recommend it.  Next time I might add shrimp and rice noodles for my boys.

I did add more curry paste because I like things spicy and this was not spicy at all and I added more fish sauce for a bit more flavor.  It was good but I can't begin to compare it to the actual Thai food I had while visiting Thailand.

Super duper!  the only change I had was to add 2 cups of cooked wild rice, I also sautéed red pepper for some colour.  We served Jalapeno bread with the soup and was great.  We also sprinkled diced green onion on top.  Flavours were very good and I'm looking forward to making it again!

I could not find lemongrass stalks to make the broth so I substituted with lemon zest from one lemon. I also used two serrano peppers instead of one jalapeno. Next time I will use chicken breast because the thighs take to long to separate out the parts I'm willing to eat. Lastly I used almost a whole jar of curry paste and the dish was not too hot. It was delicious!

This soup was a hit!  I did cut the coconut milk in half and left the garlic, ginger and lemongrass in (in cheesecloth) until serving as recommended. I also added mung bean noodles for extra hardiness. Family loved it!

I will definitely make this again and again. It was simple enough to make and the technique was brilliant. I would add more chili and definitely serve this with the garnish suggested as it makes the soup. I will experiement with shrimp rather than chicken, add varying amounts of coconut milk until I am satisfied, and play with the amounts of lemongrass. Thankyou!

Delicious soup, just not add spicy as I hoped.  I didn't read the reviews first before making so I might have added more red curry. I also think I should have added the jalapeno at the end instead of cooking it on the soup as suggested. This has tons of flavor so I'm still very happy with the results. I will make again and try a few changes to kick it up a notch.

My family loved this soup, however, even after tripling the amount of  red curry paste, it really didn't add much spice at all.    The only way we were able to add heat was from the jalapenos.  The soup was initially a little bland also, maybe the suggestion of only one can of coconut milk would have made that different.  I added a packet of chicken bouillon powder and that improved it greatly.  All in all it was a definite thumbs up and the family is already requesting it again.

The first time I made this recipe, I made it as it was written. It was good, and simple to make. The second time I made it, I bruised the lemon grass and used all of the lemon grass. ( not just the bottom part), added 10 hand torn Kiefer lime leaves and shiitake mushrooms. It was great! It needed a more asian taste. It was even better the second day.

This was the most rewarding first time try I've ever had. The recipe is perfect, although I changed a few thing because I couldn't find the ingredients.
I used lemongrass paste instead of lemongrass (1,1/2 tsp)
I added more lime juice for an extra kick and threw in a medium hot chilli in the end for extra spice.
And to make it a meal I put in glass noodles which where an amazing touch.
This is going to be my top things to cook when I want to impress guests!

I found this bland and would not do it again. I used unsalted chicken broth (all I had on hand) but added salt to the broth, and used one can light coconut milk and one can regular. I also cut down the amount of chicken from 2-1/2 to 2 lbs., but still found it way too much to stir-fry in one large pot. The chicken and mushrooms were more steamed than I like. We added siracha sauce and even soy sauce at the table to give it some punch

Not spicy at all. I will use 3x the curry paste next time. But the flavor is good. I added hot sauce cholula after the fact to kick it up. I thought I would have to add more broth but it turned out to be the right amount. The mushrooms cook down.

This recipe is delicious and  easy! I didn't have lemongrass so I just omitted.  I added about 5 teaspoons of the red paste which made it just right for us.   I also brown rice and spinach.  I will make again!!

Here's what I did:  Heated the coarsely chopped garlic, ginger, lemon grass paste.  Added the chicken broth with a Kefir lime leaf.  Brought to a boil, reduced to simmer, added the raw chicken breasts to the broth to "poach" for the stated 30 minutes.  Removed the chicken, strained the broth, "forked" the chicken into shredded pieces and put it back into the broth.  Followed the rest of the recipe but only used 1/2 a red onion because a whole one seemed like too much. (next time add some thinly sliced red pepper?).  As per other reviewers, I used more red curry paste.  As per another recommendation, I added a Tbsp on Chili Garlic Paste for heat (I didn't have a jalapeño).  Ladled the soup over some rice noodles, and served (note:  the long noodles increase the "slurp factor", so maybe break the noodles into pieces).

The boyfriend really liked it, and didn't think it was too salty.  I, too,

Excellent! Made a some adjustments.  Used 1 can coconut milk.  Used More Red curry paste (to taste). Added fresh corn kernels, carrots  and 1 red bell pepper.  Used leeks instead of red onion. Didn't have a lime or lime juice, so squeezed a bit of fresh satsuma juice in it - to taste.  Added a bit more mushroom.  Added 1/4 basmati rice. Used 1 tbsp of fish sauce instead of 3.  Use more ginger.  Used lemon grass "paste" from tube.  Brown chix first, then added garlic, ginger, lemongrass "paste", leeks. cooked a bit, then added rest of veggies cooked a bit then added rest of ingredients.

This was a really good cozy night soup! Like some reviewers, I agree that a little more broth would be good. Next time, I'll make it with another 1-2 cups. I also added the jalapenos in a few minutes before it was done simmering to add extra spice. It was delicious! I would definitely make again.

Fantastic recipe. I've made this a few times now and guests absolutely love it.  I know not traditional but I bulk it up with some carrots and potatoes which works really well.  Great for an outdoor event on a cold night!

I don't usually leave reviews, but this recipe was soooo good. I'm going to make a vegetarian version next time so that my boyfriend can eat it. He will love it. I followed the recipe perfectly except that I doubled the red curry paste and instead of the peppers at the end I added sliced tomato. I'll be making this all the time I think! So good.

Savory and delicious with good Thai flavor. Followed the recipe but only used 1.5 pounds chicken and drained after sautéing. It wasn't enough so more like 2 next time. Makes a lot. Used about 4 to 5 teaspoons of the red curry. Didn't have any fish sauce so just added salt. Used green onions instead of red which I liked better. A sprinkle of peanuts might be nice.

I agree with others that this is restaurant quality.  I altered it a bit (lemon zest instead of lemongrass, less mushroom, used 1 can of coconut milk instead of two, cooked the chicken in the broth instead of separate) and it was still fantastic.

I tweak this by adding much more red curry paste (like a whole small jar), adding an extra tablespoon of fish sauce and the juice of a second lime.   I also use thai kitchen thai ginger- I throw a few pieces in.  Also add a bell pepper and a second jalapeño pepper.  
Its messy and kind of a pain to make, but its good.  
Thai ginger is galangal.  Also I used lemongrass paste (found next to fresh spices at grocery store) instead of stalks.. like 3 T.

Delicious! I used 6 cups of broth because that's what I had, so I figured why not? I also sautéed red pepper and carrots with the mushrooms. I didn't have lemongrass, so I substituted lemon zest as recommended.

Fantastic soup, with many variables to play with!
I've substituted shrimp for the chicken with great results, used grilled peppers as an addition - all to great effect.

I did find the soup was more "manageable" with holding back on the coconut milk a bit.  The full dose yielded a very rich soup, even with the "Light" Coconut Milk.

I also found the tube of crushed lemon grass that's available in stores these days was perfectly fine and much easier.

Excellent base recipe. I made some adjustments to meet our family preferences. Used 4 cups of Better Than Bouillon vegetable base instead of chicken broth, increased red curry paste to 2T, reduced fish sauce to 1T, reduced mushrooms to 4oz, added 1/2C chopped red pepper and 8oz snow peas. I added the snow peas during last minute of cooking. Good way to use left over pork loin or chicken. Serve with fresh bean sprouts, cilantro, lime wedges and jalapenos.

I added the full amount of fish sauce as well as 3x the Curry.  I added a bit of spinach that seemed to be a nice touch. I also only removed 80% of the lemon grass etc with a slotted spoon.  I should say that I used a blender to chop the lemon grass, garlic and ginger fine.

Great recipe. Used 1/4 less of coconut cream. My husband is picky with his Thai dishes and this one he complimented twice.

Only minor changes.  One can "lite" coconut milk, one can regular, to lighten it up a little;  chicken breast instead of thighs.   The only problem is that I want to eat half the recipe myself, it's so delicious.  Next time I make this, and there will definitely be a next time,  I will use all lower fat coconut milk and thigh meat.  Also, I'll cut the chicken into thin-ish strips, instead of chunks.  I added french cut green beans to some of the leftovers today, and that also was great.

I made a few mods. I used 4 stalks of lemongrass, about 2 T of red curry paste, 10 garlics. Initially I used 4 cups of chicken broth. After adding back the lemongrass, garlic, ginger infused broth back into the soup, I added about 1.5 cups of chopped carrots and 2 extra cups of broth. The reason for that is because 2 minutes after adding the onions, I added 2 packs of ramen noodles without the flavor packs. Some of that extra broth will be absorbed by the noodles. The carrots were added because they were handy and I like carrots. Oh and I added juice of 2 limes and about 5 T of fish sauce. I forgot to mention that. Came out awesome. Even the kid who said he hates soup lapped it up.

One of the best soups I've made.  I tweaked a few things here and there based on my palette.  I added a bit of brown sugar. My secret weapon in most soups is adding seasoned rice wine vinegar and it added a welcome element in this soup.

The only change I made was to substitute the zest of one lemon for the lemongrass since I couldn't find lemongrass at the grocery store. 

Excellent. Not spicy at all, but very flavorful. Kids all ate it willingly, and my husband and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I'll definitely make this recipe again.

Thanks!

Made some improvs based on what I had at home. Lemon rind instead of lemon grass, Hoisin sauce instead of fish sauce. 1 can of coconut cream instead of the coconut milk. I also added the chicken and mushrooms to the cooked the ginger and garlic and lemon so I made it all in 1 pot and used plain water instead of chicken broth. Truly delicious! Will make again!

I had to make some changes because I didn't have all the ingredients but it still came out tasting like what I've had in Thai restaurants! I substituted peas for mushrooms and white and green onions for red onion (I put the onion in earlier though). I didn't have fish sauce, so I used soy sauce, hot chili paste, and another dry red chili paste (Trader Joe's) that is mushroom-based and very savory. I'll be investing in some fish sauce for the next try!

I found it not spicy enough, I ended up using the whole bottle of red curry and shaking in some cayenne pepper then it started to come around. I also found that it tasted better the next day after sitting overnight and eating at a lesser temperature. Ala in all, I enjoyed it and will likely make again.

I mostly followed the recipe with a few exceptions noted.  1) I substituted galangal for the ginger for a more authentic Thai flavor and 2) I put in lime and fish sauce at the very end before serving so that it isn't simmered away, per Thai practice.   I also added a cup of cooked jasmine rice.  Otherwise, outstanding dish!

I made this for dinner this evening and wanted to review the dish while it was fresh in my mind. First off, very easy to make. I used Thai spicy garlic paste instead of the red curry paste. This was tasty, but would recommend doubling the amount of that. The family loved it.

Very good. Added 4 vine tomatoes. Doubled chili paste and double chicken stock.  Used white meat chicken instead also. Not so much fat. Also use the lemongrass in a tube from grocery worked well. Don't strain out lemongrass garlic ginger. Very good flavor!

I've made this soup many times since finding it.  Easy and so flavorful.  I poach the chicken in chicken stock and then shred to save a step, and it comes out wonderfully.  My son's girlfriend is Thai, and she couldn't get enough of the soup over Christmas, so that tells me it's a hit!

Delicious as written. The only obstacle I had was to overcome the odor of fish sauce. This was my first experience with it and it is not pleasant. Power through that and  the soup is amazing. I used precooked chicken which made it easy.

sometimes I make substitutions that don't turn out perfect but good enough to "do it right"; however, this one wasn't one of them.   I used breasts and lemon peel instead of lemon grass.   Even with doubling red curry paste, this recipe was generally flavorless.  The combination of mushrooms and coconut milk made it taste more like mushroom soup, not Thai flavoring as I know it.  I forgot to remove the ginger, and just as well, b/c it was the only zing this soup had.

What a wonderful flavourful soup! A good base to play around with, like adding shrimp and bean sprouts or noodles. I made a few simple changes, some out of necessity, some by accident and others because of preference.

Awesome recipe. I added celery in with the mushrooms and doubled the red curry, then substituted serranos for the jalapeño for some heat. Definitely squeeze fresh lime juice on top and serve over rice. Mwah. Delicious .

I love this soup. Thanks to all the helpful reviews, as always it helps me put my own spin on the dish. I like the one pot soup. I use minced garlic, left the lemongrass whole (removed the top 1/3rd) but sliced up from the bulb. I'll pull them out when it's done simmering. I want all flavours to blend and I want the maximum from those flavours. I love heat and used thai chili's. Doubled the recipe, button and shiitake mushrooms. Threw in basmati rice at the end for some extra thickness. I will be making this soup over and over again.

Followed the suggestions of other reviewers & put the ginger & garlic in a tea infuser ball (had lemongrass in the tube so that wasn't an issue), doubled the amount of red curry paste, only used 1 can of coconut milk. Put in a squirt of Sriracha for kick. So, so, so good. Like someone else said, chicken soup but BETTER!

This is an excellent soup. It is easy to prepare, and the flavors are wonderful. I recommend using Red Boat fish sauce. Don't be afraid to branch out on the mushrooms, either. There are a number of varieties that work well with this recipe.

I liked this soup but my husband and teenage son both thought it was bland and needed much more flavor.   I even tripled the red curry paste (using the exact same brand, by the way) and it wasn't very spicy.  My son ended up adding lots of Siracha and my husband added red pepper flakes, but both agreed I need to find a different recipe for Thai curry soup.

I made this last night and my husband and I loved it. I increased the amount of red curry paste, but no other modifications.  It was one of the best soups I have ever eaten!!

The flavour was good, when more Thai Red Curry paste was added.  But my whole family agreed that the mushrooms overpowered the dish, and seemed out of place.  I might use this recipe as a starting point, but add a variety of different vegetables: red pepper, chopped greens, etc.

This has always been a favorite soup of mine and my husband, and I have made it many different ways but this is by far the easiest with no sacrifice to the flavor. Other recipes call for more exotic and hard to find ingredients, but you don't even need lemongrass to achieve the flavor you want with this soup because you can sub lemon zest and lemon/lime juice. The recipe's only flaw is you should double the chicken stock. Another winner from Chef John! Thanks!

Very good! I added rice and only half the chicken broth because I didn't want it too thin. It turned out to be a great consistency.

This is fantastic and very easy to make. I recommend using tom yum paste for the red curry paste. Getting authentic ingredients will make or break this soup, and taking the time to go to an Asian market is always worth it. I have the feeling the people who thought this was bland probably didn't do that. This soup tastes exactly like the spicy coconut soup at my favorite Thai restaurant, and I'm very glad I can make it at home now. If you want to make the recipe even easier, substitute silken tofu for the chicken.

So delicious - flavorful yet light. I made a few small adjustments. Salted the chicken as it cooked, and added lemon pepper. My grocery store didn't have curry paste so I used red curry sauce (about a 1/2 cup). Other than that followed recipe to a T. The garnish is a must, it really brightened the dish. Husband loved it; will definitely make again!

I love this recipe!! I spice it up a little extra by adding three times the thai curry paste, some red chili sauce  and adding some soy sauce for extra flavor.

Perfect flavors!! I purchased the curry paste, coconut milt and fish sauce from my local thai market. I couldn't find fresh lemon grass, so I used the lemon grass in the tube in the produce department, a little over a tablespoon. Delicious =)   Thank you chef

Good stuff. To pack the spice you need to add it though, jalepenos & some Siracha will do.

This tunred out amazing and easy. My boyfriend and I used 1.5 lbs of chicken and a pound of small raw shelled shrimp. I added the shrimp in with around 5 minutes left on step 5. Cooked to perfection. My boyfriend said the leftovers are even better than the original. Just a plainly delicious, restaurant style soup.

Extremely happy with this recipe! Had to sub out or omit several ingredients, and it was still excellent! (My changes: no oil, mushrooms, fish sauce, or onions, and subbing out the curry paste for curry powder and dried chilies. Also, used dry instead of fresh ginger and cilantro. And no garnishes.) Still, it's a favorite! I served it over rice, which was a very good choice.

Made this for dinner tonight and it is the best soup I've ever had.  Didn't have the lemon grass so I used lemon rind.  Really good!  I will make this over and over. Oh and I think cilantro tastes like soap so did parsley instead.  I was surprised that I even enjoyed the fresh jalapeno's on top.  Way to go Chef John, I have to say I've enjoyed all of the recipes I've made of yours.

I have made this over and over again. I crave it, it has become a staple. You gotta use thighs, they add so much more flavor, but I will use breast in a pinch. I tend to use a lot more lemon grass, ginger, and garlic than called for, but I love the flavors, my whole house smells SO GOOD!!! I'll make some skinny rice noodles, put those in a bowl, and pour soup on them. Looks very nice. Makes me feel like a real chef, lol;) thanks!

Very authentic, this soup was such a hit with my family! I made a few minor changes... like adding more pureed ginger to the soup once it was all mixed together and I added probably about triple the red curry paste. Delicious!! 5 stars or more!

This was better than the soup I usually get at my local Thai restaurant! Soooo yummy!! I was ambivalent about using fish sauce since it smells like some kind of nasty, but you couldn't even taste it in the finished product. I had a lot of leftover rotisserie chicken so I chopped it up and used that. I also had some leftover spicy green beans I had made so I chopped them roughly and added that too. Other than that I followed the recipe to a T and I loved it!! My husband enjoyed it too and he is very picky and the only thing he ever orders at a Thai restaurant is Mango Chicken. We will definitely make this again next time I have a Thai craving!!

Delicious I thought I had to be from Thailand in order to make a soup this good.  I did not want to eat raw Jalapeno so I added a couple slices to the broth mixture step number and it gave it an extra flavor kick.

I absolutely love this soup.  I've made it twice and there was never a drop left. Served it over some rice noodles.  I also found a Swanson's Thai ginger broth at the store that cut down on the prep and the ingredients and still tasted fresh and wonderful.

Absolutely unbelievable. No changes needed, this is perfect... I did 2 tablespoons of the curry paste the first time and wanted more heat so this time I did 4 tablespoons and for me it still wasn't too much. Amazing soup!! On a Paleo diet and this fit the bill.

Very good, everyone loved it.  I used lemon zest because I couldn't find lemon grass.  I could have used more curry paste, but I didn't add the jalapenos.

I made this with shrimp instead of chicken, and had to substitute soy sauce for the fish sauce.  It was very very good.  I'm not really too fond of spicy food, but this is the perfect amount of spice.  I agree with one of the other reviews, that I think this would be very good with shitake mushrooms instead of the white.  Will have again!

WOW! What a great soup recipe! Easy to make and tastes wonderful...especially on a cold, blizzardy day!!! Dear Hubby and I absolutely loved it...definitely restaurant quality! I have plans on making this the next time we have a soup bar with guests! The kids loved the flavor and did not balk at the spice! The only changes I made were: used two lemongrass (all I had), used shitaki mushrooms instead of the white, and breast meat instead of thighs as did not have any.  Next time I will use the thigh meat. I would like to try shrimp as an alternative to chicken for a change of pace as well. The spiciness of this soup was good for us as a family. May add a bit more curry paste if serving for only grown-ups! We chose to add a spoonful of cooked jasmine rice to the soup and it was a nice filling  meal served with homemade multigrain rolls.  Thank you Chef John for another wonderful recipe to go in the recipe box!

Made this soup for my daughter when she was sick. Followed the recipe (minus the fish sauce) and it was fantastic! Garlic and ginger boost the immune system, and this is a tasty alternative to the standard chicken soup recipe.

So good!!!  I can't wait to make this soup again!  I did as another reviewer had suggested and used the lemon grass and ginger from a tube.  I also used chicken breast because that's what we had.  Definitely serve with the jalapenos, cilantro and lime wedges.

Love this soup, which I've made a number of times. It does have an authentic Thai flavor. In the past, I have not added the lemongrass....not normally something I have. This time I used some of that squeeze tube stuff that you find in the produce section. It did give it another nice flavor dimension. I also threw in some green beans, as well. Great recipe!

Flavourful, authentic tasting and delicious.
I used shredded rotisserie chicken, shallots instead of red onion, and skipped the jalapeño (used what I had!). Other than that, I followed the recipe.

My wonderful boyfriend cooked this for dinner & it was delicious. He followed the recipe to the T except he added 4-5 thai chillies for an extra kick.  In  the future we plan  to add bean sprout noodles to make it more hearty.

I added chopped red pepper, bok Choy, bamboo shoots and about 1 cup cooked brown rice.  I didn't have any chicken so I used some small scallops sauted in some olive oil.  I didn't skim any of the fat off either lol!  It was fantastic.

This recipe was awesome! I was looking for something to help with a cold I got and this HIT THE SPOT!I added some fresh cut tomatoes when I added the onions and cooked the jalepeno's with the broth. I also added some cooked rice I had as well. VERY good recipe! A lot like LaBou's Spicy Thai Chicken Soup! I will be making this often! Thanks you for sharing!

This soup was fantastic!  I made a few minor changes by using the juice of two limes instead of one and I added some chopped tomatoes as well. Like other reviewers I was able to find the tube of pre-chopped lemongrass in my produce section and I found the red curry paste, fish sauce and coconut milk in the Asian section of the store. I used the reduced fat coconut milk. I also agree that the red curry paste did not add any heat but did add flavor and I doubled the amount. The fresh jalapenos gave the soup just the right amount of heat. Great mix of flavors!

I used about 6 drops lemongrass CPTG essential oil (safe for cooking) instead of the lemongrass stalks. It was good. I love that the flavors were so different from what I'm used to. However, it doesnt smell very good, especially the leftovers. Maybe because of the fish sauce?

Divine ...! 
I will do this over and over again! I didn't have light, used both cans of thick, coconut milk. By mistake, I used too much red curry, 3 TBSP instead of teaspoons(!), even with so much red curry it was absolutely wonderful. Obviously, we didn't use jalapeños anymore... We are spicy food lovers indeed! Other than these 2 small and unintentional modifications, no alteration to the recipe. Would never make any changes before trying first the original recipe.
Thank you Chef John!

This was so flavorful and tasty! Better than what I have had in most Thai restaurants. The only changes I made were to use more curry paste and more cilantro than called for.

I was impressed with this recipe, as a Canadian, I made this soup for my Thai sister-in-law and she approved! I rated 4/5 because I did tweak it a bit to my personal preferences - I added more red curry past (as per many other reviews) and also added onion, asparagus, and red peppers because I like some veg in my soups. I also had some rice left over, so I poured the hot soup over a bit of the rice in the bowls. Lovely recipe.

This  delicious!! I had the exact same red curry paste he used in the video and it wasn't spicy at all and I added like half the bottle. Im not a fan of chunks of hot peppers in my food so I garnished mine with lime, cilantro, and siracha....YUMMY!!! Next time I will double the amount of mushrooms. I served this over some instant rice as I forgot to get Jasmine rice.

I cooked the onion with the cubed chicken, then added the ginger and garlic. Simmered the soup with one cup of pasta shells, and added scallions at the end. After some sniffly days, this spicy soup was delicious. Thank you!

This recipe is to DIE for. I made it once, it turned out fabulous and have been craving it again ever since! I followed this recipe exactly, except I turned it into more of a vietnamese soup and added carrots, bean sprouts and then served it over rice noodles. 

My only suggestion if you are going to do that, is DO NOT cook the noodles in the soup. They absorb a lot of the broth so the soup becomes too thick. Cook the noodles separately and then pour the broth over top.

I've been sick for a while now, so I was getting sick of the chicken soups I had available, and decided to try something different. This was delicious. Tastes like my favorite soup at one of the local Thai restaurants!

Really liked this recipe! I halved everything because i'm the only one in my household who eats anything spicy. On that note I actually found the red curry quite tolerable, Id suggest trying the curry first if youve never used it before. I used 1 Tbls(3tps) in a half recipe and it still wasn't unbearably hot. Ive never been a fan of oyster/fish sauce but i went ahead and followed the recipe..it kinda ruined the chicken with the STRONG fishy aftertaste. Id suggest if you don't like it just stay away from it. The flavor combination is incredible though!! Also if you have any kind of rice noodles/Thai noodles it helps balance the soup out.Fresh Lemongrass is hard to find, so i used dry lemongrass(target brand) and contrary to other website reviews it actually worked very well!! I will definetley keep this recipe handy with these few alterations!!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  For the folks that say there's a lime juice step missing, you are mistaken and didn't read the recipe carefully.  The recipe says 1 lime, juiced and then it tells you in the recipe when to add the lime juice so there is no issue with this recipe as written.  Again it is SO good!

This recipe is soooo good. We didn't want to stop eating it even after we were full!  I served it over Jasmine Rice which was delicious! Don't skip putting the cilantro and lime on it before you serve it, the flavors are great together!

Absolutely delicious!  My boyfriend could only say "Oh wow" at first taste.  He then started planning our next dinner party:)

I used Thai Kitchen brand red curry paste and I have to agree that it was pretty mild. I added 2 Tablespoons of it along with a dash of cayenne pepper.  The flavor was spot on even though it had only mild heat.  

I decreased the fish sauce to 2 Tablespoons thinking that I could add more to taste if needed.  But, it didn't need it.

I added some thinly sliced mini sweet-pepper rings and a few raw, peeled, deveined shrimp when I added the onions.  They were not needed at all but I had them on hand and they sure made the dish looking even more appetizing.

I will be making this again.  My boyfriend insists.

I made this for the first time and brought it to a work potluck.  I had several requests for the recipe and had only about a cup left over for myself afterwards.  It is absolutely delicious, but I agree about the ThaiKitchen curry paste, I used 3 tsp but couldn't taste any heat other than the jalepenos so I will use more next time.  Thanks Chef John!

Delicious. Like others, I quadrupled the curry paste and still didn't find it too spicy. I also added chopped carrots, sweet potatoes and red potatoes. It's really great.

I've never had Thai food before but gave this a try. Very good. I added 4Tbs of the red curry paste and it had a nice heat in the back of my throat. Not too much, though. I agree with others that said it would be nice with rice or noodles. I will cook some bulgar or spinach noodles to add to the soup for dinner. I also added a few slices of tomato to my bowl before eating (and to save on calories I used 1 can lite coconut milk).

SPECTACULAR!  Followed the recipe to the letter and was thrilled with the result.  Some reviews say that 2 tsps of the red curry paste was insufficient ...we must have lucked into a stronger paste because it was perfect.  This will become a staple - will likely triple the recipe and freeze batches for the satisfaction of 'instant comfort food' - yum!

This was great!  I didn't have lemongrass so I substituted the chopped up rind of a lemon, and though I'm no expert on thai soups, it came out great for us!  I doubled the curry paste also, and even then my 2 year old could handle the spice, so you'll have to add to your taste.  Also, there was nothing wrong for me with the 3 Tbsp of fish sauce, I thought it added to the thai flavor of the soup.

This was the best and easiest recipe I have found. There are multiple variations of this recipe but this one is the champ. I did use extra paste. So delicious I am having the left overs now. I had to review to let people know.

Excellent recipe. I will make a larger batch next time because the left overs were just as good or better than the fresh made soup. If you like spicy foods you will definitely need to add more red curry paste. I made it almost exactly as described but i used 1 can of regular coconut milk and 1 can of light coconut milk and I ended up with a real orange soup. I pulled enough of soup out for my 2 kids before I added the heat and they absolutely loved it. Some other reviewers said they would add more veggies or pour over rice next time and think that is good advice, I probably would as well. All in all a very tasty and easy to make soup.

This soup was fantastic! My husband asked for it again which is big since he isn't much of a soup fan. I did alter it slightly, I couldn't find lemon grass so instead I put in a bunch of scallions toward the end. They made it a little chunkier too which I prefer. Then toward the end I added some sriarcha because I didn't think it was spicy enough. It came out great though and it will absolutely  be made again and again.

I have made this recipe probably 15x's and it gets better every time I make it! I didn't alter it at all except to add a large squirt of sirachi sauce at the end...I like it extra spicy! He mentions 1 lime in the ingredient list and 2 in the video...I used 2...the lime really helps to make the dish. Also, chop up and prepare all ingredients before you start simmering the chicken broth. It takes a little while to prepare it all!

Perfect recipe for my favorite dish.  Just be careful with the amount of lime juice you put in.  I did two largish limes and found the juice to be a bit too much.  I'd start with 1 to 1 1/2, taste, and go from there.  Still, everything else is fantastic.

Okay, my changes first:

2 older lemon (quite old) grass stalks from last time I made this.

2 tsp lemon zest

about 7 tiato leaves in the initial boil which you strain, you can find these at an asian grocery.

instead of coconut milk in a can I used an actual young coconut. I blended the juice with the meat and between 1/8 and 1/4 heavy cream to as fine a consistency as I could in a standard blender

half jalepeno half habenero

sauteed garlic with 2 shallots with the chicken instead of putting the garlic in beforehand. 

added about 1/4 cup sour cream

used 2 bullion cubes with an extra cup of water instead of chicken stock

used one large king oyster mushroom, sliced and cut into 2 inch by one inch pieces

added 1/2 cup of jasmine rice made in a rice cooker



With these changes the recipe was far and wide beyond the last time I made it. Doing the coconut this way gave it a wonderful texture and the flavors were so intense. It was just spicy enough to get a nice kick and still taste that habanero and jalepeno aftertaste. the king oyster MADE THIS DISH, really soaked up the flavor and the texture is my favorite of any mushroom. This was the first time I tried this shroom and I think it may be my favorite, find it at the asian grocery.

Made this recipe as is and is was good, not great in my humble opinion.  Here are the changes I made the next time:  1) Instead of infusing broth with the lemongrass, ginger and garlic and discarding it 2) I add Thai flavoring from Gourmet Blends 3) Used 1 can of light coconut milk 4) Added 1 tsp of Sambal Oelek for spice 5) Chicken breasts instead of thighs.
