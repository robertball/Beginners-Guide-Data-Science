Great chicken recipe!  My husband loved it as much as I did.  I found that it was easier for me to butter-fly the chicken breast, add the filling, then fold it over then it was to roll it up.  But either way it's a keeper.

Wow this was great!  I am a fan of all things Mexican and thought this was just fabulous! I tried it with my finace's own homemade Salsa, used crushed Tostitos instead of the corn flakes with great results. I served it to my Fiance and my Brother and Sister in law, rave reviews all around!

While my chicken didn't look like those in the pictures, it was very very tasty. My husband actually said it's something they should serve in resturaunts, it's so good. I only used 1 yellow bell pepper, half a yellow onion, and lots of chopped mushrooms (I couldn't justify buying 3 peppers only to use 1/4 of it. We don't normally eat peppers), but it was still very good. Instead of corn flakes, I used smushed up tortilla chips. The smell of the chili powder, seasonings and chips reminded me of the chili cheese Fritos, and I bet they'd be equally as good on the chicken. Served with a dollop of sour cream, a side of yellow rice, and a salad. Yummy.

Excellent recipe!  I spread about 2 tablespoons of cream cheese on each coated breast prior to filling (versus the butter suggested by another reviewer) and it turned out very moist and flavorful.
Update:  after making this delicious dish numerous times, I've dispensed with the rolling and toothpicks.  It comes out just fine with layering the toppings on top of a lightly pounded and crumbed half-breast.  I do add extra salsa and save the shredded cheese for the final topping.   It's easier to prepare and eat this way.

I made these the other day and they were great.  I did make a couple of alterations though b/c I didn't have all the ingredients.  I used crushed tortilla chips and since I didn't have fajita seasoning I used taco seasoning made from a recipe on allrecipes.  For the veggie stuffing, I used a mixture of finely chopped green pepper and zucchini, onion, and garlic (which turned out really good!).  I also used a dab of cream cheese along with the salsa and cheddar topping.

This has to be the best chicken I have ever tasted. I did use crushed tortilla chips insted of corn flakes. This will be a regular meal in our home. I'm emailing this recipe to all my friends.

My boyfriend's favorite meal that I have ever cooked! ~and I've cooked a lot for him :) I didn't have any toothpicks, so I just layered the toppings on the chicken, and it came out wonderful.  I hate chicken, and it was so moist, that even I ate it.

I hate it when people review recipe's that they didn't follow.  However, I just didn't feel like rolling and stuffing the chicken breasts.  Instead I pounded them thin, placed them in my 13-9 baking dish and layered the stuffing on top.  The result was delicious.

Just made this for dinner tonight - LOVED it!!! My husband loved it too and couldn't stop eating :) I used tortilla chips instead of corn flakes just b/c I didn't have any. Also only had green pepper - which was just fine. Served with spanish rice - Two thumbs up!!!

I loved this recipe!  My husband thinks it was only a four star, but I would give it 6 if I could.  I upped the peppers, onions and mushrooms to 1/2 cup each. Then spread the leftover pepper mixture around the chicken in the baking dish.  I also added a teaspoon of cream cheese in the roll up as other reviewers suggested.  I topped it with the extra sauce made by the pepper/onion/mushroom mixture, and sour cream.  Served with Plantains and black beans and rice.  Even my 2 year old loved this!!  :o)

Really liked the corn flake coating, and was surprised how well it stuck to the chicken.  Might experiment with other seasonings besides fajita mix.  Added a dab of cream cheese to the center of each, and topped with fresh salsa.  The chicken was moist and DH said it was perfectly cooked.  Thanks for a great recipe.

this was ok on flavor, but the preparation was in my opinion way too much work for a 3 star meal.  if i make this dish again, i will be chopping up all ingredients, mixing them up and baking.

this was fabulously different!  i found the recipe doing a search for cornflakes, trying to use up the rest of a box i'm tired of eating for breakfast.  i left the peppers out of the ones for the kids but otherwise kept to the recipe.  this isn't something i could eat all the time, but it was a really nice change of pace that we all enjoyed.  thanks!

The flavor of this is great!  But a bit messy for presentation.  I added garlic to the mixture, and used tortilla chips like others did.  A monteray jack/white chedder cheese mixture would probably work better for the cheese.  
Delicious!

I can't believe my luck - recently I made the Black Bean and Couscous Salad from this site, had the peppers and some green onion leftover - stumbled onto this recipe in an attempt to use up my leftover ingredients. This was GREAT! Very healthy, simple and yummy. I brushed olive oil on the inside and top "flap" of the outside to coat w/cornflake mix...even my 3 yr old was dancing for more of it (my hubby wouldn't share his, so I had to : )

This recipe is delicious! The flavors all combine together to make a flavorful, moist chicken dish. I followed the recommendation of others and added a dab of cream cheese in the filling. I also went light on the red peppers and added more mushrooms and tomatoes. The filling can easily be adjusted to suit your personal tastes. I also like that this recipe can be sized for a small or large dinner group. Enjoy!

This is one fantastic recipe!  I substituted saltless white corn tortilla chips for the corn flakes, but I'm sure corn flakes would have been just as good (and probably easier to crush).  Also, I added a tablespoon of cayenne pepper to the mix for some extra heat.  The rest was done exactly according to recipe, and truly doesn't need any other changes.  This meal is healthy -and dammmmnnnn tasty.

This was very good!  I didn't really expect anything special from reading it, but was pleasantly surprised at how the flavors came together.  What I really liked about it is that it was easy to modify each stuffed chicken for the individual.  I set aside some breading without the chili for my young daughter, and left the mushrooms off my own.  We each had our own made-to-order stuffed chicken with little extra effort.

I didn't include mushrooms and used tortilla chips instead of corn flakes.  It was good but not awesome.  For the amount of prep work involved I don't think it's really worth it.

Great recipe.  I am a novice cook, but this recipe was simple to follow.  The chicken turned out tender & delicious.

This dish was just ok.  If I make it again, I will use diced jalapenos and speghetti sauce instead of the salsa.  It lacked something and I just couldn't put my finger on it.  We thought it was kinda bland.

So this was awesome chicken dish...when i mixed the veggies together i added some chili powder and hot sauce to the mix.  also instead of tostitos i crushed up taco shells.  i served it along side a warm corn salsa (i had alot of extra veggies so i sauteed them with some garlic and oil, then added the corn ) and some mexican rice..my fiancee loved this dish

This dish is delicious!!! I took some advice and butterflied the chicken it was still really hard for me to close. I didn't have fajita seasoning so i made my own. I also used one yellow pepper. I cooked the chicken for about an hour to be safe. This was a great tasty dinner.

My family really enjoyed it but it was not my favorite dish. If I made it again, I would change the filling slightly. I was not a huge fan of the fajita seasoning. I would use taco seasoning in the future.

Our family really liked this.  I modified it a little.  I only had green peppers in my garden, so I used all green peppers and added a can of green chilies.  I also used the crushed tortilla chips.  I used the idea about the grate and it wasn't soggy at all!  Will definitely will make again.

I made 3 changes due to what I had on hand...and this still came out wonderfully. I didn't have any corn flakes...so I used bread crumbs.   I also only had 1 very large red bell pepper...so I just used that.   And finally...I didn't have any plain cheddar...so I used a mexican blend shredded cheese. I made this with Spanish Rice IV (also from this site) and they complimented each other perfectly. I'll definitely be making this again.

love this recipe. but of course i did my own version of it. i baked the chicken in the oven then proceeded to cut it up and put it into a frying pan. before that i added butter, mushrooms and red peppers to the pan. put in the fajita seasoning, then the cut up chicken. went on to add sour cream and cream cheese. over that mixture i topped it with cheese, crushed tortilla chips and more cheese. baked it in the oven to melt the cheese. then added salsa on top

I made this awhile ago, and forgot to rate it!!  I thought this was just ok. I had a hard time "stuffing" the chicken, and had a lot of filling left over.  Maybe I did something wrong, since no one else seems to have had that problem.  It was good enough to eat, but not something that I will crave to make again.

If I could give this 10 stars I would!!  This was a HUGE hit with my family and I even forgot a step (adding salsa to the topping before baking).  I only used green pepper cause that was all I had and as per another reviewers suggestion, I used crushed tortilla chips instead of corn flakes.  As well instead of packaged fajita seasoning I used Taco Seasoning I from this site.  This is a MAJOR keeper...Thanks Bob!!!!

We really liked this recipe. Made it as written. I would only make half of the crushed cornflakes next time, as there was a lot leftover. As well, I think I'll spritz the chicken with some spray-oil, as the crumbs didn't stick as well as I would have liked. Definitely will make it again.

I tried this recipe out the other night 
Only alterations:
 -tortilla chips because I had no corn flakes, 
- I didn't have mushrooms.
-I never really measure anything
- I also made a seperate little side dish without cheese for myself

My boyfriend and mom LOVED it. Mum said it should be sold in a resturant. BF texted me the next day while eating leftovers still raving about it, and my cheese-free dish was amazing as well. Everyone has been asking for it again, Thanks for sharing!!! :) The leftover chicken breast was SO good mixed in with salad!!

I swapped the cornflakes for crushed tortilla chips.  I also spread the salsa on the chicken first and then rolled it in the tortilla chips.

For my first effort, I tried butterflying the chicken breasts instead of pounding and rolling.  Next time I will go with Bob's original instruction as with my way, I struggled with the corn flakes.  I did tweak the incredients to make it more Santa Fe inspired by omitting the mushrooms and adding black beans and grilled corn.  I also increased the salsa and added about 1/2 cup sour cream to give the filling more of a sauce texture.  Garnished with fresh avacado and just a dab of extra sour cream.  My husband loved it.  I made twice as much with the intention of leftovers.  I sliced the remainers and used them to make a quesadilla the following day.  A definite keeper!

Awesome recipe!! Its definitely a keeper. Used crushed corn tortilla chips instead of the corn flakes. Served w/yellow rice and canned corn w/the red peppers in it. Delicious meal that everyone raved about! Thanks for a great recipe!

We loved this!  I couldn't roll it (maybe we didn't pound the chicken thin enough) but we folded it and secured it with toothpicks.  It was delicious.

This is just ok for us. I did it with tortilla chips instead of corn flakes because of some of the reviews I read. The flavor is ok, but it just didn't wow me like I thought it would. I think maybe cooking it on a rack might keep the bottom from turning soggy. I served it with Mexican rice and asparagus. My husband is Mexican and he told me to stop searching for Mexican recipes online because Mexicans don't eat like this lol.

I love when people use unexpected ingredients as substitutes. It takes a little creativity. I've tried the cornflakes and whatever I have had at hand when out of breadcrumbs. I've used crackers, bagel chips, tortilla chips just like propp who left you a review. A good cook knows how to substitute. So I'm impressed by your boyfriend. encourage him to continue cooking, you may have a future chef in your hands.

Very good not sure if it's worth all the efforst and ingredients though. I was having a hard time rolling the chicken so I just baked some of them with the veggies ontop and it was really good that way. I liked the corn flake coating I will make my baked chicken with the corn flakes when I don't have the panko bread crumbs. Thanks for the interesting chicken dish.

Oh gosh this was really yummy.  I made this as written with the exception of using a green pepper in place of the orange (didn't have on hand) and used a Mexican blend cheese instead of cheddar.  Will definitely be making this dish again.  My husband went for seconds.....

Kids loved it...I did switch out the corn flakes for crushed tortilla chips though.  Very tasty.  In fact the following week we downsized to chicken breast strips rolled in the chips with the "filling on top.  Rolled them up in flour tortillas...good stuff

Made this for dinner last night & it was wonderful.  I used plain bread crumbs because that is what I had.  You can really alter the stuffing to your taste.  I used finely diced green pepper, red pepper & sweet onion.  Also added chopped fresh celantro & a mexican blend of packaged grated cheese.  I heaped on the pepper and onion mixture & skipped the salsa.  It really had enough mexican flare with the fahita seasoning & chili powder.  At the end, I sprinkled more celantro on top of the chicken, then the rest of the grated cheese before putting back in oven for last few minutes.  This was really wonderful.  I served salsa on the side for those who might want it.  I did not put salsa on mine and thought it was very very good.  Served with Spanish rice.

My husband raves about this everytime I make it.  I just made it for a friend that had a baby and she said her whole family loved it and she asked for the recipe.(I omitted the chili powder since she has small children)  This one is a keeper!

Good recipe.  Add more salsa to keep it from getting dry.  We topped ours with sour cream.

This turned out really good. All the kids ate it which is a plus! I did not have the mushrooms but it tasted good without too. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This wasn't nearly as good as I had hoped. Spinach stuffed chicken breasts and feta-stuffed chicken were both far better.

Sooooooo Yummy!!!! What a great dinner. I used tortillia chips for the coating(seemed more authentic) and used alot more cheese on top. This is a keeper....so much flavor and fairly easy to make. Very messy to make though. Served with easy spanish rice recipe. Will make again and again.Thanks!!

This is one of the best recipes I've ever made. It was delicious!!! I will keep it as a regular. I did take the advice of other cooks to use some cream cheese and to use tortilla chips instead of corn flakes.

This was FANTASTIC!

I didn't expect this to be as good as it is.  The prep time took a little longer than I expected (I cut all the veggies by hand so that they would be a bit chunky - not pulverized like my processor makes them)  The breasts I had were huge and were difficult to tie together (I used string)  But - WOW - what a delicious taste this chicken has!  My fellows loved it and so did I!

I didn't have any salsa on hand, but made it with just about everything else and I really liked it. I think I might like it without the salsa anyway because the focused taste is the peppers. Anyway, really liked it!!!

What a great twist on chicken!!!  I loved this recipe and so did my 4 year old!  Thank you for a great new chicken recipe!  I don't believe in changing a recipe until you tasted it first and I'm so glad I didn't change a thing.  Thanks again!!!

Yum!  My husband and I loved this.  We made it with tortilla chips rather than the cornflakes, as suggested by other reviewers. We also used fajita seasoning that my husband makes himself.  It smelled wonderful while it was baking and tasted even better. It was worth the prep time - I will definitely be making this one again.

I made this one a couple of weeks ago, but kept forgetting to review it! I left out the fajita seasoning and coated the chicken with the corn flake crumbs mixed with ground cayenne pepper. I omitted the mushrooms (hubby hates them!) and used diced red and orange pepper only. I followed the rest of the recipe, except that I sprinkled extra salsa on top of the chicken along with the rest of the cheddar. You might need to alter the sooking time since I found that the chicken wasn't cooked through on all of the pieces. We had to put some back in the oven so that we weren't eating rare chicken!! The end result was very savory and delicious.

Very good!  My husband is hispanic and he thought it was great!  He immediately said put this on your "make again list".  Instead of cornflakes, which I did not have, I crushed some corn chips and used those instead.  I did not roll the chicken, but folded them in half after pounding them flat.  After folding, no toothpicks needed.  Add a bit of red sauce or enchilada sauce over the top.  You don't need to, the recipe stands on its own.  It does add a nice touch though.  Great flavor in any case!

My family loved this flavour!  I used Italian breadcrumbs instead of cornflakes and found I had lots of the breading mixture to spare.  Maybe next time I will split the mixture before and use only half, saving the other half for next time

Fabulous! This chicken Is the BOMB as my daughter said lol I did make a few changes due to what I had on hand. I had no Fajita mix so i used taco seasoning and omitted the chili powder. I did double the peppers and sauteed them a bit before adding it to the mixture! I had no cornflakes so i used rice crispies and some bread crumbs.Also i cubed half my cheese for the filling and used the shredded on top! Sooooo Good!! My family ate every bite! My daughter was looking for seconds..lol

This was just ok for me.  I don't think I liked the fajita seasoning taste.  I'm not really sure.  It was definitely edible but I don't think I'll make it again based on the effort...although it was a pretty dish to serve.

Excellent.  No other words to describe this one.  I made this for dinner on a Monday night for my wife and I, and on Wednesday, she called me from work to ask what she needed to get at the store for me to make it again.  It is time consuming, but very very tasty.

Very good.  I love the crunch.  I didn't have fajita seasoning, so I used taco seasoning. Good overall.  I put too much filling in and couldn't fold it over, but I will next time because the cheese on top would be great.

It was a lot of effort for something that wasn't really great.  All the rave reviews got me excited.  Too much chili powder, and I didn't even use the full tablespoon.  oh well.

This was really good. Like others I used tortilla chips instead of the cereal (as we don't eat that kind of cereal) and I cut open the breast and stuffed the veggies inside. I also added slices of habenero jack cheese instead of the cheddar. YUM! Will definitely make again.

AMAZING!! My boyfriend said I need to make it every week and it's going in our family "must-have vault"! I substituted corn flakes for Panko and made fresh salsa. I added ham inside and boy, it was phenomenal. I butterflied the flattened chicken and it cooked to perfection. Must make!

I was disappointed with this recipe.  The flavor of the coating was too strong, and seemed to clash.  Not something i would be interested in cooking again.

This is one of the best chicken recipes I have tried. We all raved about it!  Pretty quick and easy to prepare too! I will try it with tortilla chips as suggested the next time, which will be real soon!

Excellent recipe, very quick and easy. I used tortilla chips instead of corn flakes but followed the rest of the recipe as written with fabulous results.

Really good. I roasted the peppers, onion and mushrooms before stuffing the breasts and made a low-carb crumb topping from flax-seed meal and almond meal. Our local grocers sell "chicken grillers" that are approximatlely the same as these, but then wrapped in bacon. Grillers come in flavors that include pizza, cowboy (with jalapenos), ham and pepperoni, spinach and feta, Hawaiian with pineapple, etc. All are variations that can be adapted to this recipe. Good job Bob!

I thought this was amazing! I usually manage to overcook chicken, but this came out moist and very tasty! I used a frozen bell pepper and onion mix (fajita vegetables) and thawed them in the skillet and then added to the chicken as directed. My boyfriend suggested adding Jalapenos, so next time we will try that!

This was really good. It did take quite a while to prepare and assemble. But it was worth it. I followed the advise of the other reviews and added the cream cheese in the filling. That really made the dish I think. I also made a sauce with a can of petite diced tomatos with jalapenos, salsa, the left over diced peppers/onions/garlic-sauted, and sour cream. So good!!

This was wonderful - next time I think I will add some red pepper flakes directly to the meat for even more kick. This one is a keeper.

Wow!  This was so good!  I made it for my husband last night and he was in heaven!  It was so simple to make too!! I used Fritos chips instead of Corn Flakes just because I had the chips but didn't have the Corn Flakes, Yummy!  My husband is already asking me to make it again!

This sloppy spicy slice of heaven was synergistic...that is...the finished product was greater than the sum of the individual ingredients.  I will be making this again!

I added the cream cheese that some others suggested and it definitely added to the dish!  I also added a jalapeno pepper for extra spice.

Wow, this was really tasty!  I have to admit that it was better than I expected.  I thought it would be okay, but it was really yummy!  I used frozen tri-color peppers and a regular onion (instead of a sweet onion).  I left out the mushrooms because my husband doesn't like them and it's not worth watching him sullenly pick them out.  :)  My chicken breasts were a little thick, so they wouldn't roll up. I just coated them in the corn flakes and piled all of the other ingredients on top.  Then I sprinkled the extra cornflakes on top of everything before baking them.  I served the chicken with black beans and rice plus a green veggie.  I will definitely make this again!

Very tasty, but messy to make...I used the crushed tortilla chips and added chili powder and taco seasoning to them for a kick!  I didn't have enough cheese for the filling so I used what I had to melt on top for the last few minutes of baking time.  Definately make again! Hubby LOVED IT!  I used the leftover pepper mixture and cooked that with brown rice and black beans and some chicken thighs...easy and SO GOOD!

This was truly delightful.  I wasn't sure that the pepper mushroom medley would be all that great.  However, mixed in with the cheese and salsa it was fantastic.  Also, I used a whole chicken, cut up into quarters.  I followed the recipe exactly for the breasts and then I just dredged the legs in the mixture and topped them with the salsa and cheese, putting the remaining peppers around the legs.  And, I used the tortilla chips instead of corn flakes as suggested by others, which was good, but I wonder if this is the more fattening option!  Great recipe.  We will eat this often

We LOVED this chicken!  We omitted the mushrooms and added the cream cheese suggested by previous reviewers.  We did end up with a ton of leftover crumb mixture, so I will look to half the ingredients for that in the future.  Thanks so much for the tasty recipe!

I opted for the suggestions to pound and stuff the breast and mixed peppers, etc. in with cream cheese to reduce work. Have tried with tortilla chips  ; delicious. Am making tonight using cornflakes.

A quick and easy take on chicken breasts that’s easy to make low carb (no corn flakes) and make a lot of for a week’s worth of meals. Can cut up and use as taco filling, mix with rice or with eggs for breakfast to make it last multiple meals.

Perhaps I did something wrong but we didn't care for this. I did butterfly it and put the filling inside and the filling was the best part. The seasoning and overall taste though wasn't for us.

Great jumping off recipe for  using your imagination to stuff chicken breasts with all sorts of things. As to following this recipe to the letter...I didn't.  I used it for timings and amounts and some of the ingredients. I put the breasts in a ziplock bag and pound with the smooth side of the mallet. It takes time. I lay out all the ingredients in little piles so I don't cross contaminate unused ingredients. As I roll up the ingredients in the breast I turn in the sides as much as possible to keep the stuffing inside. I bake the breasts about 30 minutes then perhaps pour on a half jar of salsa or, if I'm feeling Italian, a small jar of spaghetti sauce, then bake another 30 minutes. Breasts these days are so huge they need an hour to cook then most guests can't eat the whole thing. Perhaps cutting a few in half before serving would be good.

Instead of the regular chili, I used chipotle chili instead. That gave it a kick. My husband loved it. 

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the corn flakes served no purpose.

This recipe was pretty good! I did butterfly the chicken like previous reviewers to make for easier stuffing. Overall it was good. I used frosted flakes that i had on hand and the extra sweetness from the flakes was amazing!

I changed this a LOT but want to give credit where due for a great meal! I was looking for a sort of last minute chicken dish for 4 boneless skinless breasts - and wanted to make do with what I had on hand.
Washed the breasts and cut pockets in them and then let them marinate in fresh lime juice while I preheated the oven and... ground up tortilla chips ending up with about a cup added some spices and was worried if I made and used more there would be too much salt from the  chips... I had a packet of "fresh" liquid green chili fajita sauce  - spread a little in the 9x13 pan. I warmed 2 corn tortillas for each breast and smeared them and the pan so the tortillas had a coating of the sauce. I had frozen about a cup of grilled red peppers and had moved those to the fridge earlier so I sliced and diced including the juice that was now sort of a slush and added about 1/2 of diced sweet onion. I added 3 generous tablespoons of cowboy caviar from Trader Joes to give it a bit more kick. I did have about 4 tablespoons of cream cheese and a small bag of shredded pepper jack so I mixed the pepper jack with the onions. I dredged the outside of my breasts scooped a glob of cream cheese and as much of the peppers and onions mix as I could fit into the breast, placed in 2 corn tortillas with cut side down so it looked like a taco. I did this to all the breasts, sprinkled and smashed the rest of the tortilla chips over the breasts, crossed my fingers. 1hr 350 add shredded cheese last 15 YUM

This recipe was great! I changed a few things, I did 1/2 cups of the peppers and added half of a jalapeno pepper. I also used cream cheese as suggested and instead of the recommended cheese I used Pepper Jack cheese. I also doubled the mushrooms. To the peppers mix I added about a tablespoon of minced garlic and a 1/2 cup fresh cilantro. The veggies that were leftover I put around the chicken in the pan. Instead of corn chips for the crust I used the hint of lime tortilla chips. Very tasty

Great chicken!  I used crushed mexican tortilla chips instead of the corn flakes.  Also, butterflied the breasts instead of rollin' 'em up... and added some cilantro and sour cream to the mixture.  And when it came out of the oven, topped with a bit more shredded cheese and sliced avacados and sour cream...OMG...YUM!

Made this for dinner a few nights ago to entertain a friend....was wonderful. I added a bit more chili seasonings to give it a little bit more of a kick. Was very delightful. Also like some other reviewers I use tortilla chips. 

But next time I think i'll leave out the chips, and just put the veggie spread from the middle on top and baste it that way.

Definitely 5 stars....should've been maybe even 6 or more stars! I was dieing for a mexican recipe involving chicken breasts without having to use chopped chicken in a casserole type recipe. I came across this one and two others and not only did my picky family love it, but so did I and I am not one to like my own cooking. I did, however, use bread crumbs instead of corn flakes and added cumin, garlic salt/powder, oregano and chopped green chilies, then I mixed jack cheese with cheddar cheese and omitted the mushrooms. The only real negative I came across was I couldn't roll my breasts without the contents spilling out everywhere, so I lay them flat and buried the goody mixture on top, served with lime slices, guacamole and sour cream! Mexican rice and (black & refried) beans on the side...YUM! Also, wicked colorful and again loved by everyone...I will definitely do again!

I just made this last night with me and my boyfriend and we loved it!  I followed a lot of people's changes and butterflied the chicken.  I also used peach-mango salsa and tortilla chips with a touch of jalapeno.  I'm sure it's great as the recipe says too!  Definitely making this again!!

This dish is very tasty.  I used crushed tortilla chips as others suggested.  Also I used yellow and green peppers with the mushrooms and red onion because that is what I had on hand.  Instead of cheddar I used a mexican cheese mix.  Our family likes things spicy so I also added a little cayenne pepper in addition to the chili powder in the crushed chips. I had chopped extra vegetables and sprinkled some of them in the baking dish as well.  I love the consistency of the vegetables ...still a little crisp.  And the chicken is nice and tender.  Very delicious!

This was a good recipe that is very healthy. I made with low fat cheese to reduce calories even more and used baked tortilla chips to coat the chicken.  The only problem that I had was that overall it was a little dry.  Next time I make, I think that I will maybe try using laughing cow cheese to give it a sauce, otherwise, very good.

The flavor was great!  It was hard to wrap the chicken with all the great stuff in it!    I had too many peppers, mushrooms and onions cut so I added them to a salad.  I'll try again!  Great taste!

Very tasty. We never eat Corn Flakes and I didn't want to buy them just for this recipe, so I substituted "Spicy Nacho Doritos" and it was great. Probably less work, too. Also I used frozen, precut, pepper strips. It turned out very well. I asked my husband if should keep the recipe and he said "definitely".

Delicious! 5 Stars even with my changes: use tortilla chips instead of cornflakes (I made half with cornflakes and half with tortilla chips.) Include 1-2 teaspoon of cream cheese on each. I put the extra filling on top of the chicken in the pan and even sprinkled some of the extra tortilla chips on top. I used more salsa too.  I didn't use toothpicks, just cut chicken breasts in half lengthwise to make two cutlets and then pound thin just a little bit. Bread, fill, roll up, put in pan seam down. My husband liked with sour cream. Served with Spanish Rice Original.

Great flavor! And pretty easy to make. I used a green pepper instead of yellow, turned out great. You could easily make this a spicier dish by adding cayenne pepper or stronger salsa. Served with cornbread, delicioso!

Delish!! I didn't have mushrooms and I used half fajita mix and half taco mix (it's what I had) and it still turned out wonderfully.  The chili powder added the perfect little kick.

This is the main dish I served with the sweet corn cake recipe.  This chicken was soo moist and full of flavor.  I took the suggestion of one of the reviewers and added some cream cheese to each chicken breast.  This was a WONDERFUL suggestion.  Also I made it without the peppers.  I am not a fan of them.

The fajita seasoning flavor was too overpowering for our taste. It would be a good recipe otherwise; I'd omit the packaged seasoning mix and just season it with chili powder, cumin, onion powder, etc.

This recipe was very good.  I am not a fan of rolling, so I sandwiched the filling between 2 thinly cut chicken breasts and baked for the same amount of time.  It came out great.  Not as messy this way...

This is one of the best chicken dishes I have ever had, without question.  I omitted mushrooms.  Once, I only had green peppers and dried onion and it was STILL delicious.  You know it's solid when that happens...Thanks for a great recipe!

This chicken was outstanding. Even my picky kids enjoyed it. I don't really think I would change a thing- everything balances perfectly.

Very tasty dish!  I only made one change, then had to customize for the kiddos!  I sauteed the peppers and mushrooms and added a tablespoon of chipolte sauce along with some homemade salsa.  For the girls I left the peppers out and just stuffed theirs with cheese.  We all enjoyed this meal, it was served with a pot of pinto beans and Spanish rice!  Great meal!  DH eats regular on weekends, so I did use the cornflakes, however during weekdays I will use some low carb tortilla chips to fit into his diet.

This was great!

I improvised a bit..  Chopped red bell pepper, poblano pepper, onion & tomato (I don't like mushrooms).  I piled all the chopped veggies on top of the cornflake crusted chicken.  Baked for 30 min then added cheese and cooked another 10 min.  Perfect!  yum!

I made this for dinner last nite and my husband loved it. While he was at work lunch today he just could not stop talking to all his friends about the chicken that he had last nite. I will be making it again soon.
