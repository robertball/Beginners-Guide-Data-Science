The batter is fairly thick, so when you pour apples into the center, they don't sink, they just stay in the center, on the top.  I used a small rectangular dish which resulted in the corners not having apples in the pudding.  In the future, I would take a small amount of the apples and mix them into the batter, then pour into the dish, and put the rest of the apples into the center for a nice presentation.  I baked for about 38 minutes, and the pudding was still a little dough-y, so be sure the center is fully cooked...but this was not a huge problem.  Garnished with some sliced fresh apples.

I substituted the sweetener with actual sugar. I only made half the recipe and it worked perfectly. It’s delicious. Personally I would add more apples next time, but even without any it’s still delicious.

this is a nice light tasting treat. I did as the previous review suggested and mixed most of the apples into the mixture. Sprinkled the remaining on top.  I would increase the apples to 3 cups next time
