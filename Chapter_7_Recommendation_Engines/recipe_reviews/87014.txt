For all of the extra ingredients, this isn't much better than just using Italian dressing by itself.  The vinegar is a little overpowering.  The chopped basil did help a lot.

I added a little bit of yellow bell pepper to make up for the lack of red bell I had   I liked it but I do think it got better with time. Let it go three days. That last day for me took the bottle taste out of the Italian dressing and incorporated the fresh basil just so that it tasted like a 100% homemade dressing.
