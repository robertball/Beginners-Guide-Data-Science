I made this as an appetizer for Valentines Day.  I modified it a teeny bit as I used a smaller Brie wheel and sliced it in half spreading apricot preserves and pecans in the middle. Wrapped in 8 oz pkg of the crescent roll, gave it a egg wash, and baked it for 15 minutes, THEN added the honey and pecans to the top and baked it for another 15 minutes. I served it with sliced granny smith apples and seedless green grapes & wheat crackers. My Date went nuts over it. I have never seen him dive into something like he did this. Easy to prepare, makes a beautiful presentation, and is unbelievably good. I will be keeping this recipe.

So easy to make and everyone was so impressed.  I used my own pastry, and omitted the nuts as I had none.  I've made this twice now.  The first time, I put the honey on the top, and it ran down the sides and burned the pan, the second time, I put the honey on the inside, and it worked much better.  Stayed in the dough and tasted yummy.

Five stars, though I did make a few changes off the bat.  It's not that I didn't trust it--it's that I had dinner roll dough and not crescent roll dough.  I used four Rhodes white Texas rolls (you could use six Rhodes white dinner rolls, too--it would come out to the same dough weight).  I pressed the rolls together and rolled them out to a 9-10" circle.  I drizzled the center with honey, sprinkled with walnuts, topped with the brie, and wrapped the dough around it.  Placed seam-side down on the baking sheet, brushed with egg, drizzled with additional honey, sprinkled additional walnuts, and baked for 35 minutes or so.  Healthier than crescent roll dough, and even picky husband loved it!

Baked brie is just good no matter what you do to it.  I used a large wedge of cheese as my store didn't have any rounds.  I baked it in a small casserole, topped  with the honey and pecans.  Omitted the dough part altogether...was still great.

I used a wheel of brie with a hole in the center like a wreath. It took 2 cans of the crescent rolls to cover it. I covered it with foil halfway through the baking to keep it from burning. When I served it I put green grapes in the center and crackers and green apple slices around it. It was delicious and a beautiful presentation enjoyed by everyone. I thought it was best with the apple slices.. Yum! So easy and so good. Thanks!

Absolutely, unbelievably delicious.  When you cut into the outer crescent roll shell, the melted brie oozes out like hot lava.  YUMMY!  Tastes great on apples (better than on crackers).  I'll DEFINITELY make this for get togethers!  I used less honey and pecans than called for.

This is amazing!  I took some of the advice from the others and put nuts and honey inside of the bread too.  I also covered the dish so the honey didn't burn.  You should serve this right away while it is still hot (but can be reheated 1/2 way through the party if needed - not as good as first time but will do the trick).  LOVED it with the apples!

This was a big hit at a dinner party I hosted.  I used maple syrup instead of honey, and let the pecans & syrup spill onto the plate around the wrapped brie, so that when the cheese melted, it went had something to mix with.

Super Yummy! I made this for Thanksgiving. It was a great table centerpiece for appetizers. Served with wheat thins but would have been great with warm pita.

I made this on Christmas as a pre dinner snack and it came out very delicious. I had some problem with the honey getting too hot and browning during the baking and had to change dishes and add the honey at the end. But I was using a toaster oven so it could just be my appliance. Very simple and tasty dish.

I have done a similar recipe before, but instead of refrigerated crescents I use frozen phyllo dough instead.  I also brush with egg whites before I put it in the oven, YUM!!!

Excellent recipe - as many others mentioned, it's quite easy and guests are very impressed! Although I made some modifications, it's very similiar to the original recipe:
Used puff pastry.
One half I used apricot preserves.
One half I used honey and almonds (sliced, honey roasted almonds)...sprinkled a few on top for presentation.
They both leaked out, even though I sealed it. But it didn't burn and I was able to drizzle a little bit on top.
Easy and delicious!
Also, slicing a huge wheel of brie on the horizontal is tricky...but if it isn't perfectly cut in half, no one will ever know. Someone also recommended using dental floss. Will try that next time!

7/30/11  Not too many people cared for this at our family get-together in Prior Lake, MN.  I want to try the recipe again but with a thinner layer of brie. I like brie, but the recipe called for a thicker slab. I will also add honey with the cheese inside the bread. I will definitely try this again, as I think it has great possibilities.

So yummy and easy. I used an 8oz wheel of Brie and half a package of thick & flaky crescents and it was plenty for a small get-together. I don't think I used all 1.5 cups of honey either - think it would've been too sweet. Would give it 5 stars, but it doesn't reheat all that well (the Brie doesn't get very soft and the crescent rolls don't get that flaky crispness once it's been refrigerated).

Not a fan....the pecans were very good and the dough tasted very good.  There was just an aftertaste that was not good.  Maybe my cheese was not good, but we did not like this recipe.

Loved this!  I think the honey got a little too dark, but it didn't impact the taste.  We usually make brie with lemon and almonds but this is my new favorite!

You can't go wrong with this recipe. I had company coming over in 30 minutes and whipped this up last minute when I remembered I had meant to make it..... I took an 8 oz wheel of brie, wrapped the crescent rolls around it however it would fit- not leaving any openings so it could ooze out.... dumped the rest of a half-filled honey jar on top and topped with glazed pecans. I baked it as directed and as soon as everyone showed up I pulled it out of the oven and served it with water crackers and fruit. It was awesome!

I followed a reviewer's suggested and put the honey on top of the cheese, inside the dough, before I baked it.  I brushed the dough with milk to make it shiny, then baked 15 minutes, put the pecans on top and added a little bit more of honey on the outside.  It was really yummy and my book club devoured it!!  A keeper.

OMG! So easy! So delicious! Last night I had unexpected company on their way, so had exactly 30 minutes to come up with a plan to feed them something with a glass of wine (no time to go to the market). I went to my favorite recipe site - allrecipes.com - and did an 'ingredient search'. I put in 'brie and crescent rolls' and got this fantastic recipe. I did follow another reviewer who suggested putting some honey and pecans on top of the brie before wrapping up in the crescent roll, then brushed with egg, drizzled with additional honey, and added additional chopped pecans. This will become a favorite recipe for me, even when I'm not short on time. Thanks, Kim!

This was the appetizer for our Valentine's Day dinner. I omitted the pecans & put honey on the brie before wrapping it in the dough. Will not bake with the honey drizzled on the outside, it just burns in the bottom of the dish. I used less honey, but I will put on the brie before wrapping in the dough and drizzle honey on the outside either after it has finished cooking or in the last 5-10 min. Tasted very good served with slices of Granny Smith apples. Marries well with the honey and brie taste.

Yummy yummy! I made this using homemade *Puff Pastry* recipe from this site, and I put the honey inside (though it all oozed out anyways). It made me wish I had apple slices, that sounds great!

Super quick and easy and everyone loved this recipe.  Used only about 1/2 of the honey called for.

An easy and impressive appetizer for parties.  Put the honey & pecans on after the phyllo & cheese has finished baking to prevent burning.  You don't need as much honey as called for - just drizzle to your taste.  Serve with thinly sliced pears & rosemary-raisin Lesley Stowe crisps & this dish will disappear!

This was ok, but not terrific. It seemed to be way too much honey.  I think I would try the recipe again, but definitely not use as much honey.  Also, it seemed to burn, so I would lower the heat as well and probably skin the round of brie before breading.

Very delicious...I used an 8oz. brie wheel and one large crescent pkg. Centered brie on crescent and covered entirely with honey. Did not measure. Omitted nuts. Baked up very well. Need to cool before digging in!!

This recipe makes for a delicious treat (or meal, considering all the calories).  On my oven, I need to lessen the cooking time. Be sure to cool somewhat before cutting. 
If you love the taste of Brie, you will love this!

The flavor is outstanding, but I wish I’d followed other suggestions, as I may never get the honey/dough combination out of our pottery dish designed for baked Brie!  Also, it was way too much for a party of 9 (I should’ve realized that.). Next time I will:  Use a small wheel of Brie.  Form the crescent rolls into a ball and roll into a circle.  Pre-toast roughly chopped pecans a little and put both the honey and pecans into the center, then top with the Brie and wrap the dough and seal tightly.  Place seam side down on a parchment lined cookie sheet, brush with egg wash and bake to a light golden brown.  Transfer to serving dish for serving.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! I used honey and pecans.  I put some honey and pecans on top of the Brie and then some more on top of the pastry. I brushed some egg yolk on top of the pastry as well. It came out very brown on top so I probably should have covered it but it was still very good. I thought my brother-in-law was going to eat the whole thing!

This was a big hit with my family. I too tweaked  the recipe. I added 1 T pineapple preserves in the middle of the cheese wheel that I sliced in half. I also added pecans, coconut, and  1 T honey in the middle. I baked it for 15 minutes then added a honey pineapple blend (2T of each) and topped it with toasted coconut and pecans. Then I baked it for another 15 minutes.    Let it cool and eat wit a dollop of vanilla ice cream.   So, so tasty.

So good!  I will definitely make this again.  I paired it with sautéed pork belly, bacon/onion jelly, green apple slices and sesame water crackers; along with a nice cabernet.  I used a triple cheese brie wedge from Trader Joe's, wrapped in crescent roll, used about half the recommended honey, half the pecans and baked in a 6x9 pan.  Excellent!

Yum! I made this to see if it was good enough to bring to a thanksgiving lunch. Wowwww I was amazed at how delicious it was! I had habanero honey I was going to use but decided to use my homemade jalapeño jelly instead and it will wow your taste buds! I was pleasantly surprised how well all of the flavors blended together.

I loved the combination of flavored in this recipe. The first time I made this the honey started to burn and cheese sort of leaked from dough. I made again and buttered a tart pan and pieced the dough together well. I sliced the Brie and layered it across the bottom and then poured on the honey and almonds and baked. It came out beautiful.

Heavenly! I only had enough brie to fill 2 small triangles of crescent roll dough. BIG MISTAKE! I was dying for more. The smooth melted brie paired perfectly with the sweet honey.

This one is a keeper! The only complaint I ever get is that some people don't like the rind on the brie. I don't care for it myself but this recipe is so good I just pick it out.

Best baked brie I've had out of maybe 3 other styles.  I used walnuts instead of pecans.  Baked for about 45 minutes since my pastry was huge.  Six out of six people who ate it loved it. Perfect size for everyone to get an appetizer-size portion.

I don't think I did this quite right...the pecans on top nearly burned and once it cooled a little the honey turned into a goopy mess. I think next time I may bake the brie with the rind off, too. Still tasty though. There's deifnitely room for me to try again. I love honey brie spread, so I may play with this recipe.

I made this for my bunco group and everyone loved it.  The only thing is, the cheese is extraordinarily hot coming out of the oven, so it's best to let this cool for a little bit before digging in.  Great served with water crackers.

This was good, but it was really messy.  I served it as an appetizer at Thanksgiving dinner and only about a 1/4 of it was eaten.   I probably won't make this again.

I spread 4 ounces of cream cheese on top of brie before wrapping. I also chopped the pecans.

Soooooo yummy! My guests loved it. The fluffy pastry shell complements the brie, pecans, and honey so well. It disappeared quickly into bellies.
