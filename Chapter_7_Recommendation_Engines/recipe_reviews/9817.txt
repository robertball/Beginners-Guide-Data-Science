Great recipe!  I added 1/4 cup extra flour to dough, due to previous review that it was too sticky to work with and my dough came out fine. I divided my dough into 3 parts and rolled out each part, spread filling and cut into triangles like a pizza. Each wedge was then rolled up like croissants. To the apricot filling  I added and extra tbsp. sugar. My kids and family loved them.

My family and I love this recipe.  It's a lot quicker than the other kolache recipies with yeast, but it tastes nearly identical.  

This would be a great finger food to serve on a buffet or even as a dessert at a formal dinner.  

2 things:  400 on my oven was a little hot.  I turned it down to about 390 or so (just barely before the 400 mark), and they worked beautifully.  Expect the finished product to have areas of dark and like, sort of like macaroons (sp?). 

Secondly, make sure the dough is REALLY cold.  I eventually put mine in the freezer.  Otherwise, you'll have it sticking to your rolling pin constantly.

Try other dried fruits.  Plum immediently comes to mind, but other fruits would work too.  Be aware that if you use jelly (ONLY use "all-fruit" jelly if you're going to do this) it WILL run out of your kolache.

I used regular pie filling (blueberry, cherry, apple, peach) and they were just awesome.  Also, I made circles in the dough and folded it over and used a fork to stick the edges together.  It worked really nicely.  Great, fantastic recipe!!!!  Our whole family wanted more.

My father-in-law loved these cookies!  I did find, however, the 2" squares were a bit on the smallish side, so I used a glass with a 3 1/2" diameter to make circles instead.  I also shook the cookies (after they were cooled) in powdered sugar.  Next time I will probably add a little more flour and maybe powdered sugar to make the dough less sticky.  Excellent recipe!

This recipe is very tasty!  I found that even at 400', 15 min wasn't enough time to brown the cookie.  I am at 6000 ft elevation, that may make a difference.  Also, the squares were difficult to manage, so I rolled out a 9" diameter circle and used a pizza cutter to cut out 12 wedges.  This version looked great, but the filling oozed out. So, I cut out 3" diameter circles and put the filling in the middle-then folded over and crimped the edge with a fork. This worked really well.  OH, the original recipe said "6 servings"...how many cookies is that per serving?  Since I wasn't certain, I doubled the recipe and it turned out that I got 4 dozen from it.  So, 6 servings was 2 dozen (not enough to share with friends and neighbors).  All-in-all, this recipe is great!

These turned out well. I chilled my dough a little longer than an hour because it still seemed a little too soft when I checked it.  The cookie part has a sweet biscuit type flavor.  I will definately try these with other fillings.

Wonderful and easy, I think the cream cheam pastry is luscious as well as much easier and less time consuming than a yeast dough.  The hint of cream cheese also provides the perfect complement to the warm richness of apricot filling.  I added a just a hint of lemon zest to the pastry to accentuate the flavor and it all won rave reviews.  Best of all, the ingredients are all things you can readily have on hand for any time you feel like making a fruit-based breakfast treat or dessert but don't have any fresh fruit handy.  Wonderful!

The dough was very soft and despite using a well-floured surface to roll it on, I couldn't fold up the corners.  I put the smeared little lumps on parchment paper to prevent scorching, and they did taste good.

This recipe was a lot of fun. Tons of butter though (but that's just how I like things). I did not have an issue with the dough being too sticky to work with, I felt that this was the perfect recipe. However, due to the incompetence of the keeper of my parents' kitchen, I substituted the apricots with dried cherries, and I have to say, it was amazing. I plan to make this again and I will more than likely be just as pleased with the apricot filling as I am with the Cherry. Thanks for posting this! It has become a new family favorite!

these were just like my grandmother used to make. My family and friends enjoyed these very much. I used apricot preserves instead. The dried apricots were too stiff and sticky.

These are very close to how my Grandma made them. Only we called them envelopes. Her's seemed smaller though. She only folded over two sides, which made them look like little envelopes (opposite corners). But the bottoms got a little to brown for me. Perhaps I baked too long. She used to use nut filling, cheese filling and prune filling also. Then she dredged in powdered sugar. Ahh...a little taste of childhood memories. Thanks.

When I saw this recipe, I thought they would come out like little danishes... wrong. They are more like a cookie, or rather like Pop-Tart(tm)dough. So instead of folding them like the recipe called for I made them into little Pop-Tarts(tm). 
Thanks to VJGUNKEL59 for the heads-up on the extra 1/4 cup flour to help with the sticky dough problem.
Also the heat was too high for the time... So I lowered the heat to 350 and kept the time.
Other than that I like this recipe.

The  dough was extremely soft and unable to hold much of a shape.  As i read in other reviews it stuck to the surface no matter how much flour I used due to the cream cheese element.  This recipe may be good for desert Kolaches but does not work well for savory ones, due to the sweetness of the dough.
