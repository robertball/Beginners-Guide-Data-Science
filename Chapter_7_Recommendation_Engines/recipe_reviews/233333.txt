Great recipe and very easy to make.   I used dark brown sugar and craisins, wrapped in foil and put in a 9" square pan.  Cooked for 1 hour at 400.   Reheated the next day very well.   Thinking of adding this to my Thanksgiving menu next year.  Will definitely cook again.

Excellent.  I made this in a 9x13 glass pan.  I also had to let it cook about 45 minutes total to cook the sweet potatoes, as other comments suggested.  I used Craisins for the cranberries.  I wrapped it up in a 'hot wrap' to take 1.5 hours to a family gathering, and it was great when we got there.  It also tastes good cold the next day!  Not much left, however!

It's easier to wrap individual portions: one potato, half an apple, and serve the packets that way. Mine took closer to 45 minutes to cook. Good flavor!

Great recipe! I did omit the brown sugar and cut back on the cranberries (less than 1/4c) to reduce the sugar and added some chopped pecans. Delicious! I will be making this again.

Loved this one! Never thought to grill sweet potatoes but they caramelized into a great dish we will have on the grill again! Had a nice sweetness to it that was great!

Easy after the peeling. I couldn't figure out how to core the apples and make rings, so I sliced them.

The family requested I leave out the cranberries, so I did, but it was still very good.  After reading some of the reviews I cut back just a smidgeon on the brown sugar which worked out very well for us.  This was easy and delicious and I love no clean up.

We made this as side dish with chicken.  It was delicious.  We also added chopped walnuts to it.  All the ingredients  blended together so well - the apples, sweet potatoes and cranberries were just so tasty all together.  It will be our new sweet potato dish for Thanksgiving!  So very simple to make too!

I did sub fresh cranberries for dried ones; did not need additional sugar for our taste.  This is a great flavor combination and will be using this one over and over!

I love this. I use it during thanksgiving instead of the traditional sweet potato and marshmallows dish. Its amazing. Almost more of a dessert than a side dish. :)

Made this but cut it in half. No other changes. It was easy and so tasty.  Now that I have tested it, it will be a favorite when I have dinner parties.

These were pretty good.  Next time I would double the sauce (brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon).

Made this the other night and my son and I both really liked it.  It needed some more baking time, though.  I tried it without the butter, hoping to make it healthier, and while it was good, I know the butter would make it even better.

Great recipe. I needed something to go with Smoked tenderloin and this was a perfect side dish. Easy to prepare with great flavor. I did use a little sea salt on the potatoes. I will definitely be making this again.

This was very good!  I made it in a 9x13 pan and just stirred everything together in the pan.  I cooked it on my oven's convection setting, and it was done in 30 minutes.  I am wondering if it would have needed to be cooked longer on a regular cook setting.  Either way, it is quite good and we will be having this again!

My husband normally doesn't care much for sweet potatoes, but he really liked this.  The only change I made was to dice the potatoes and apples.  It was a little sweet because I only had Honey Crisp apples to use, but that just made it more dessert-like.  Can't wait to make it again.

Cooked this tonight to go along with a pork tenderloin. It was delicious, and definitely an easy clean up. Only difference was I used fresh cranberries instead of the dried. They were a great substitution.
