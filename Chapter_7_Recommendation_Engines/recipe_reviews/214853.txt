i altered this recipe to make 24 mini cheesecakes. I lined a mini muffin pan with liners and added just enough crushed oreos (12 regular sized crushed in a ziploc bag with a rolling pin) to cover the bottom. I halved the filling and it made just enough to fill all 24 liners to the top. I added a splash of vanilla to the filling as well and only cooked it for about 12 minutes, or until it was almost set. I topped them off with one mini oreo each, and it took almost the whole box of Snack Packs to do the job, as each baggie only had about 9 cookies in it :( overall, i was really pleased with how they turned out. Can't wait to eat them this weekend at a friend's party!

These are very tasty and quick to make. A good treat for adults and kids alike. However, I gave it 3 stars because the Oreo cookie did not soften after baking. In fact, it was just as crunchy and hard after baking as it was before baking. Next time I will try soaking the cookies in milk or maybe even warm coffee (if serving to adults) to see if this makes a difference. The alternative would be to use Oreo crumbs and make your own crust. Another lesson learned, is go ahead and fill the cupcake liner with batter almost until the top. I filled mine 2/3 of the way and the batter did not rise as much as I would have liked.

These are pretty good. I wouldn't soak the cookie or crush them and mix the crumbs with butter. That takes away the ease of this recipe. I was done with this in no time. Drop the cookie, fill the cups. And to me the cookies aren't too hard. They're not super soft, but they're not hard like they were just taken out of the package, either. I didn't mess with melting chocolate or cool whip. I just crushed some oreos on the batter. I'm docking this because the cheesecake part, which is pretty much the most important part, is pretty much flavorless. It needs something. Vanilla? I'll keep the oreo bottom idea, but find a different cheesecake recipe to fill it with.

This recipe is very good, but like others suggested, I added 1tsp of vanilla to give the cheesecake that extra flavor missing. Remember, cheesecake doesn’t really rise, so fill your cups pretty full. After reading other reviews, I was expecting the cookie to be extremely hard. I dont know if it was because I used generic oreos, or if it was because I made them the night before, but my cookie was very soft. Also, to simplify the process even more, I used Smucher’s Magic Shell ice cream topping for the chocolate drizzle. After I baked them, I let them set for about 10mins, drizzled the MagicShell on top, then refrigerated overnight. Topping looked just as good and a lot less work. Thanks for the recipe!

HEAVEN!!!!!! This it the type of cheesecake that is thick and creamy, not that light fluffy . i made these for my boyfriend when he came over for dinner, and mind you he is just like a critic, he absolutly loved them. When i made these instead of putting a whole cookie on the bottom i crushed oreos and patted them down, I also crushed chocklate chip cookies and patted it down. I will deffinetly use this recipe again.

I made these for my husband's birthday and they were AWESOME. 

I added a tablespoon of vanilla extract and I dipped the oreos in melted butter before I put them in the cups. They cooked up just like a crust (which is just cookie and butter to start with). 

20 minutes for delicious mini cheesecakes can't be beat!

Took these to work and to Friends' Thanksgiving (when we feast with our closest friends) and everyone raved about them!  Oreo cookies make a delicious and creative base (not a boring Nilla wafer) and while the cheesecakes sunk quite a bit, I just spooned some Cool Whip on top and sprinkled with crushed Oreo cookies.  Pretty and tasty without over-indulging!

I was seriously craving cheesecake last night but all I had was one package of cream cheese and some oreos. I halved the recipe to make 6 and since I had no patience to wait 3 hours for it to cool I stuck them in the freezer for a bit. I didn't bother with the cool whip or chocolate drizzle (since I planned on scarfing 3 before bed) and I STILL give this recipe a 5. Easy to make and delicious!

2 packages of cream cheese will make way more than a dozen cheesecakes.  I had a package opened with half remaining and I got 8 cheesecakes out of one half package of creamcheese.  I stirred in a little vanilla and strawberry jam for extra flavor and topped with mini chocolate chips rather than melting chocolate.  I baked for 22 minutes and they were perfectly done.  The Oreos were not hard.  They look cute in Christmas baking cups.  I'm going to make them again for Christmas Eve.

I love the idea of the cookie on the bottom. The whole thing took me about 2 minutes to make. I used and extra 1/4 cup sugar 2 tsp vanilla and a 1/2 cup chocolate chips. If you make them without muffin cups the cookie is a better consistency.

Just made these for a friends birthday celebration at work.  Everyone loved them.  The recipe is SO easy.  This was my first time making anything "cheese-cakey"  I'm glad I did... delish!  Oh, I blended the oreo cookies in my espresso grinder first to make it more like a pie crust.

Did not care for these at all.  I guess my hopes were to high.  Not like a regular cheesecake at all.

These were absolutely fantastic! They were so easy to make and were gone in less than 10 minutes. I followed the suggestions of many other reviewers and added 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla extract to a double batch of batter. I also used double stuffed oreos that i soaked in milk for a couple of seconds. Also, I used semisweet chocolate chips for the drizzle on the top. Also, i would suggest using foil cupcake wrappers instead of paper ones because the oreo stuck to the bottom a bit. I brought 24 of these mini cheesecakes to a tennis team dinner and everyone loved them! definitely a keeper.

Excellent super simple recipe! I've brought these to work several times and I always get requests for the recipe. I've tried it by just leaving the Oreos whole at the bottom of a muffin cup, or crushing them with an espresso tamper to "fill out" the bottom better, since the Oreo has a smaller diameter than the bottom of the cup. Makes a lovely rich cheesecake.

I recently made these for a cookout with some friends. Everyone loved them and I was definitely glad that I added some vanilla extract like it was suggested by other reviewers. Also, I would highly recommend using foil cupcake papers instead of paper ones.  The paper ones stuck to the bottom of the Oreo.

Simple and tasty. Need to add 1 tsp vanilla for flavor, otherwise they are a little bland. Also, use regular oreos, not double stuff.

Amazing. Loved it. The cheesecake turned out very light and airy and the cookie soften just slightly but was still firm.  I added 1 tsp of vanilla like so many ppl suggested.

This is a great recipe, my only suggestion would be to tap the pan down after filling so that the cheesecake goes around the cookie...some of mine were not fully covered on the bottom :D

I really wanted to like these, but as written it is just not right. First, the recipe needs a 1/2tsp vanilla. Second, while I liked the idea, the cookie just does not work. After baking you are left with a hard oreo at the bottom of the liner. The oreo is not only still hard but actually separates from the cheesecake. Not good. I will continue to make my mini cheesecakes with a graham crust and some vanilla.

I added 1/2 cup of greek yogurt to the cream cheese mixture.  (I was out of vanilla, or else I would have added that too.)   I also crushed some Oreos and mixed it into the cream cheese.  This helped with the actual cheesecake.  I am still up in the air about using the whole Oreo as the crust.  On one hand, it was very easy.  On the other hand, some parts in the middle was hard for a cheesecake crust.  Maybe it's because I used generic Oreos?  If I make this again, I would definitely add vanilla to the cheesecake, and maybe use actual brand Oreos.

Love them!!! For a last minute bake sale, I had no time, these were so easy and quick. Plus I hate making crusts for any cheesecake anyways. Maybe I will start using Oreo's in my big cheesecakes!

Me and my husband love cheesecake, so when I saw how easy this was I had to try it for a last minute dessert for the evening.  I agree with most reviewers that the oreo was not that great because it didn't soften at all and the filling was flavorless.  I would try this again crushing the oreos first and making additions to the filling.

These are amazing and so easy to make! My family loved them. I did decided to take the advice of some others and I added so vanilla and a touch of cinnamon to the cheesecake batter. They turned out just perfect. Thanks for the recipe it is a keeper :)

I forgot to add the vanilla everyone suggested, and it was pretty bland.  I'm sure the vanilla wouldve helped.

These were good! My family dinner party LOVED these! They were very easy to make and have ready ahead of time. I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter and I think next time I will add a little more sugar- wasn't sweet enough for me!!! Thank you for a very versatile recipe!

These were pretty good: 3.5 stars if possible.  The cheesecake portion came out a little dry, not really creamy at all, so next time will reduce the baking time by about 25%.

These were so easy to make! I made some for a bake sale, people went nuts over them! I did add 1tsp of vanilla to the batter. I did some with golden oreos and topped them with cherries. I did the others with regular oreos and topped them with chocolate chips. They were amazing. After refrigerating overnight I did not think the cookies were still crunchy as someone else said. I thought they were perfect and crust-like.

I've made a lot of cheesecakes, and even though this is very similar, for some reason the mini cheesecakes lacked a lot of flavor.  It just didn't taste like good cheesecake.  If I were going to make them again, I'd be sure to swirl in a layer, like raspberry or strawberry, in the middle to help make up for the lack of taste.

These were a HUGE hit!  Instead of putting a whole Oreo in the bottom (I read a few reviews about it not getting soft), I crumbled up about 10 of them, mixed them with butter, and pressed them into the bottom of the muffin cup.  They turned out fantastic and I'll definitely be using this recipe again!

I followed this recipe with just a few changes.  For every oreo I placed in the muffin liners, I ate another oreo.  Then while cooking, I ate 12 oreos with milk in honor of the 12 cheesecakes in the oven.  Finally, I taste tested the recipe before serving it to my guests by consuming 2 of the the cheesecakes (one with Cool Whip and one without).  I decided I like the recipe without cool whip.  Final thoughts: great recipe and surprisingly filling for only 269 calories but dropped it a star because it was a little too sweet for a cheesecake (I may reduce the amount of sugar I add next time).  I will say that I also wish it didn't require a whole package of oreos to make.

Super easy and delicious! I had them out for a party, and the oreo did start to get soggy after a little while so if I would recommend not leaving them out.

I changed the recipe by adding in crushed Oreos, replacing the sugar with powdered sugar and 2 egg whites so that it would keep the white color and give the cheesecakes a cookie & cream look. I also made half of the bases full Oreos and the other, half an Oreo and found that the half Oreos were way better so I recommend using half the Oreo rather than the whole thing

I agree with others, these could have used a little flavoring in the cheesecake but overall, these were easy to make and quite good. I had no problem using the entire cookie exactly as stated in the recipe. Everyone thought they were great.

I added some vanilla and 3/4 cup or so sour cream to the batter. I also dipped the Oreo in melted butter hoping this would help prevent them from being too crunchy. They were still crunchy but after 12 hours they seemed to soften a little. They turned out super yummy!

I made this recipe for a potluck. Everyone loved them! I crushed the oreos in a plastic bag with a rolling pin and mixed with 3 tablespoons of melted butter, then pressed them into the liners and followed the rest of the recipe.

Made these for my son's birthday party. They were awesome and very easy to make, what more could you ask for! I did add vanilla like many of the other reviewers. I also dipped the Oreo cookie in a little bit of melted butter, the cookie crust was not too hard or too soft. With these since they're individual servings you don't have to worry about cutting a cheesecake which is another added bonus. Big hit at the party will defiantly make again!

I have a recipe from 40 years ago (with the Nilla Vanilla Wafer as the crust).  It is identical except for the crust and mine has 2 T. vanilla extract added.  I truly did not care for this version at all.  The crust is hard and too thick for a cupcake size cheeseccake.  I did add the chocolate drizzle to the top, but much prefer my original recipe with pie filling added to the top.

I write reviews for recipes in my school newspaper.  I saw this and had to make it!  It was really easy and fast to make, required some cleanup, but not too much.  I brought about 60-70 into my last tennis practice and they were gone like that *snaps fingers*! I'd never even had cheesecake before, and these were amazing!!

I loved the concept and the cookie at the bottom, but despite adding vanilla and oreo crumbles to the cheesecake, it was really bland.  I plan to try the concept again with a different cheesecake recipe...probably one with a little sour cream to boost the flavor.

Made these yesterday for Father's day and my husband loved them! Since many reviewers said the cheesecake part lacked flavor, I added vanilla extract and swirled in some Marion berry preserves and that did the trick! My Oreo crusts were a tad small to fill the whole bottom, so that was a little disappointing but the cookie was not hard or crunchy. I didn't do the chocolate drizzle or whip cream, I just sprinkled the tops with Oreo cookie crumbs.

These could not have turned out any better!  They turned out fantastic looking, with the OREO being very visible as the crust.  They were easily removed from the liners, and everyone loved the taste.  Great, quick way to make cheesecake!

Sort of bland.  And I even went with what a reviewer suggested and added a tsp or so of vanilla.  May have been better if I'd cooked them a few minutes less as they seemed overdone.

I made these mini cheesecakes for a holiday party and they were a huge hit with the kids and adults!  The kids love the "surprise" Oreo on the bottom. They are super easy to make when you are in a hurry and they only use 2 packages of cream cheese as opposed to 3 or 4 for a traditional cheesecake.  I actually was able to make 18 mini cheesecakes as opposed to 12 (as per the recipe).  Great treat for any occasion!

Added 8 oreos and 2tsp vanilla to the cream cheese, eggs, sugar. Cookie was hard like the others had mentioned, but I made for a retirement party and people raved. 

Next time, I will put a dollop of cheesecake mixture, then cookie.

Made 24 half full cheesecake cupcakes and 3 full ones

I made these for a new years eve gathering and forgot about them until same day.   So I chopped up 12 Aldi double stuffed chocolate cookies as I had those in the pantry.  Added a couple tablespoons of melted butter and then divided that between 12 muffin tins lined with paper.  I did not have time to let the oreos soften so I thought I had to go this way.    I tamped it down with a wooden tamper.  Then I poured the cheesecake batter on that.  I meant to add vanilla as others suggested and forgot.   I filled the cups full.  Then I baked them and let them set on counter maybe 20 minutes.  Then I put them in the frig to cool.   After a couple hours I topped them with a chocolate ganache.  I did not have semi sweet chips so I used a hot cup of cream and poured that over a cup of dark chocolate chips and 1/3 cup of milk chocolate stars  (improving with what I had).   I did add a little vanilla (not my norm) into the ganache since I forgot it in the cheesecake batter.   I spooned just a little ganache in the center of each one (boy I made way too much ganache) until it was basically level.  Put them back in the frig for about an hour, then we had to run to the party.   People loved these!  Everyone asked for the recipe.    So I gave it 5 stars even without vanilla.     Doubled the batch today for another event and turned out beautiful.

As much as I want to like these, the cookie being crunchy really throws off the entire cupcake feel.  Even for a crust, it would be too hard.  Crushed, it would be too crumbly to eat while holding.  Until the cookie can be made softer, you're better off making the mini version (with tweaks) because those ended up soft, in my experience.

According to previous reviewers, the cheesecake had very little flavor, so I adapted this recipe by adding 1/2 cup heavy cream, 2 tbsp sour cream, 1 tsp vanilla extract, zest of 1/2 a lemon, and crushed 9 oreos into the batter. I baked them for 15 minutes. It yielded about 18 mini cheesecakes, and they came out nicely.

I added half a bag of white chocolate melted with a little bit of heavy whipping cream. Gave a more rich flavor and helped with creating a velvet texture.

I have been making these for years. My family loves them. The only thing I do differently is-- I take the Oreos apart. I place the Oreo with the frosting --frosting side up--in the cupcake liner then I pour the cheesecake mixture over that. The plain half of the Oreo I crush and sprinkle over the top of the cheesecake mixture before I bake them.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I placed the entire Oreo on the bottom of the muffin cup and added 1.5 teaspoons of vanilla as suggested by other reviewers. I am a total chocoholic so I also mixed in 1 cup of melted semisweet chocolate chips (prior to mixing in the eggs). I also only had to bake for 15 minutes and they were perfect. So chocolaty and delicious, I advise adding the melted chocolate if you are anything like me. Perfect recipe! Would make them without chocolate too and top with preserves (probably strawberry) yum!

Very simple Recipe...and a delicious dessert!  I used the new "Oreo Thins" to line the bottom of each muffin tin liner...and crushed 6 Oreo's and added them to the Cheesecake batter, along with 1 teaspoon of Vanilla Extract.  Quick & easy Dessert!

The cheesecake itself turned out delicious. I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla for extra flavour. However, the bottoms of my cheesecakes (the Oreo) came out a little burnt. You could smell and taste it but it didn't entirely ruin the experience. Phew! Next time I will watch them more carefully as to not burn them! Maybe my oven was just too strong.

This was a hit in my household!  I used 2 tsp vanilla and 3/4 cup of sugar.  Tapped the pan to have to batter surround the cookie as others suggested.  These were divine.  Hubby is volunteering to make another batch he loved this so much!  It was gone before I remembered that we got some cool whip as a topping.

So yummy! I had made few changes just to suit my taste after reading other reviews:
-Instead of regular cream cheese, I used reduced fat. Worked just as nicely.
-I did add 1tsp of vanilla extract as reviews had suggested. 
-My oven bakes a little faster than normal, so I had to take them out 3.5 minutes early.
-To half the batch, i added dark chocolate chips once i poured them in. 
Will definitely make it again!

I added a tablespoon of vanilla like everyone had suggested. It was DELICIOUS. This was a super easy recipe and it turned out perfect. I had extra milk chocolate chocolate chips on hand so I put those on top before throwing it in the oven. The oreo cookie was still crunchy and just chewy enough with the cream cheese layer on top. Will definitely make this again!

This recipe was VERY good! My whole family loved them and devoured them in no time flat. I did make one change however. The original recipe tasted WAY too bitter, and I needed to add about 1 1/2 cups more sugar.

I have been making these for years. Always a request for events etc and quick and easy. As per the oreo being too hard I was told to make them at least a day in advance and it does soften to the point of not crumbling. I also add some chocolate and use fudgeo's for chocolate cheesecakes.

The recipe sounds amazing but it didn't turn out well. After remaining at the bottom throughout baking, the oreo turned out a bit rubbery, soggy, hard to break, and not the amazing taste it should have been. The cheesecake itself was okay, but because of the combo, the entire oreo cheesecake's tastes did not come together well, and I had to force myself to finish the personal-sized cheesecake. I think oreo works better in a full-sized cheesecake.

Delicious and super easy!! I do agree with one of the other reviewers- the oreo cookie did not get softer after baking.  The crunchiness of the thick cookie on bottom made it a little messy when eating, but not a deal-breaker for me.  I enjoyed them and so did my friends!

AWESOME and easy!!! Added a tsp vanilla and drizzled mint chocolate chip on top. No need to crumble cookies in bottom, they will soften. Only recommendation is make more than 12, because the are yummy!!!

Very easy recipe. Very yummy. I did add half a teaspoon of vanilla extract so it would bring out the cheesecake flavor a bit more.
As for the oreos on the bottom, I left them as whole cookies. I tried one about two hours after baking and refrigerating and the cookies were hard. But then I tried one this morning and they were soft and delicious!

I've made this twice and did it differently both times.  
Crust:  The first time I crushed the oreos, mixed with butter, and pressed the mixture down into the bottom of the muffin cup.  The second time I was pressed for time and just used the whole oreo.  The first way was a better texture and a better looking presentation.  
Cheesecake:  I forgot the vanilla this time and it really did make a difference.  It's not hugely flavorful, but it's really easy and it's perfectly good for a potluck, if not a gourmet dinner.

I made this for dessert at a beach barbeque last night.  Everyone loved it! Instead of cool whip topping, I used fresh blueberries and raspberries and drizzled them with chocolate. This was fast, easy, and fun to make. Definitely going to keep this one in mind for our next outing or party!

Why did I ever think I could resist this once it was baked??? I made a batch of 12 with the regular Oreos and boy was it GOOOOOOOOD. I made it in the morning while I was getting the bacon ready so it could be chilled before an afternoon party. Yummy! Is it tacky to eat your own stuff at someone else's party? hahahah...I went and bought more and made 2 dozen minis for the hosts and to share at work...24 mini delights for under $10!!! Magical! 

PS. I did add vanilla and crushed oreos in the batter as others suggested and maybe Im nuts but it wasn't super sweet to me. Meh! for the minis, no crushed ones but I stuck one on the top for flair! :)

These little treats were so easy to make and the kids loved them! I crushed up Oreo's and added them in the batter. Also added some vanilla for extra flavoring.

This recipe was SOOO yummy! I was afraid the Oreos would come out too hard because of the other ratings I read, but they did not..they were perfect!  I didn't change much about the recipe however I did double the recipe and add a tablespoon of vanilla extract.  I can't even tell you how many of these I ate LOL!

The only difference between these and the ones I made is I didn’t add the whipped cream or chocolate syrup. Instead, I crumbled oreo’s and mixed them in with the cream cheese, sugar and eggs.  They were a HIT!

Absolutely loved this and it's so versitile. You can substitute the chocolate on top for any pie filling. My cheesecakes rose niceloy in the oven but they fell when I took them out of the oven so it made a perfect indentation to fill with chocolate, cherries, strawberries, raspberries, etc. Wonderful, easy recipe

Absolutely delicious!!!  I skipped the chocolate drizzle and whipped cream.  Crushed some oreos and put them on the top after they baked (have to stick them in there - not just sprinkle them on top).  Heavenly!!  Next time I will probably crush the oreos for the bottom too, as they were still crunchy, and I like mine softer :)

Made for Easter and these were so good I will be making again.  I can't believe how simple these were to make.  I give them 5 stars.  I crushed a little oreo and sprinkled on top too, to make it more fun.

These are so easy and wonderful!  I love the idea of making them in muffin tins with the oreo on the bottom.  The cookie was perfect - it was soft and delicious.  I don't know why others had problems with the cookie being hard. Instead of chocolate we drizzled a raspberry sauce on top and loved it.  You can't go wrong with cheesecake!!
