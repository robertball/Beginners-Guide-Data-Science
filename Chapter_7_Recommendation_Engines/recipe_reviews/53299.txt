Excellent! Easy to make and everyone loved it! But I did make some changes -- I sauteed some onion, green pepper, and tomato in butter prior to adding the egg/noodle mixture. I also whisked in about a quarter cup of milk, half of the cheddar cheese, and some pepper to the egg/noodle mixture, prior to adding to the skillet. 

Contrary to what someone else said in their review, this was not hard to eat at all! It had the same texture as quiche or any other type of frittata, and the noodles didn't make a difference in that regard, so that person probably botched the recipe.

I served it with turkey sausages and toast!

WINNER!!  I was looking for super quick, super easy, and this is it!  Four ingredients that are always on hand in my kitchen, 20 minutes and it's on the table.  Nothing fancy, but darned good eatting, and kids love it!  
Extra bonus - this is one of those recipes that you can improvise easily.  I added some frozen vegs. to noodles, sauted onion and bell pepper in the butter, throw in some chopped cooked chicken breast or ham if it's handy.
Thank you, Judy, for this recipe!

Just because it's easy to make doesn't make it easy to eat.  Steer clear.

Yum! I really enjoyed this. I'm a college student and need quick, easy recipes like these. Took no time at all and tasted great. Some people complained that this tasted like eggs and noodles, well, that's what it basically is, and I love it! The chicken flavoring that comes with the noodles helps a lot I think. :-) Will make again, maybe using other noodle flavors.

Excellent receipe! It was simple to make and the kids loved it.  I did add a bit of milk to make the egg go further and added some frozen peas and broccoli. It was an excellent way to sneak it some good veggies for my picky niece.

Very easy and good too.  I used a larger package of ramen noodles so the frittata was a little bit dry, I should have added another egg.

Totally easy and yummy. I added scallions as another reviewer suggested, and I'm glad I did. I think next time I will leave out the seasoning packets altogether and use my own seasonings.

I got the recipe out of the paper (not the exact same recipe, but it's not that different) and I must say that the addition of frozen mixed vegetables is a really good idea. I also use chicken and corn flavored noodles instead of plain chicken.
Good recipe all the same.

I too, had my doubts about Cheddar Cheese on Chinese.  It was worth a try because the hubby wanted omelettes and I only had three eggs. Halved the recipe and it smelt good and he devoured it all.  The next time we made the half recipe, I sauteed a mixture of green and sweet onions in the butter first, then I added 1/2 cup well-drained leftover meat and veggie stirfry to the mix. Good thing to try when you only have less than a cup of leftovers. Leftover ham, turkey, peas, 'shrooms, fajitas.  All blended pretty good in there!

I liked this dish but didn't love it. I added some sautéed onions, carrots and red and green bell peppers to it. I didn't have cheese so I left that out and added some water to the egg mixture. I also ended up baking it (at 350 for 20 or so minutes) because I doubled the recipe but didn't have a pan big enough to cook it in. I think it needed more spices the seasoning packets weren't enough or just weren't strong enough for my taste. I would make this again but add more spices next time around. ;0)

I was very skeptical of this recipe. . . ramen noodles? For breakfast? Luckily I'm willing to try most foods at least once. This is so much better than I even thought it was going to be! Really easy to make and can be made to your liking with whatever you like. My personal favorite is adding some ham, onion, and jalapeno. It's not the healthiest, by far, but it's tasty!

This was REALLY good for how easy it was.  I had all the ingredients on-hand and could make it in a pinch.  I did add some extras because I had them leftover in the fridge (bacon and onions).  My girls actually liked it too!  I would definitely make this again as a pinch meal.

Tasty and different. It isnt very healthy, but being on vacation in Los Angeles, my cousin had everything on hand so I gave it a go. I added the cheese to the egg mixture, and sprinkled parmesan on top of the final product. I found this on the Dinner Spinner app. Thanks for the recipe!

This was fantastic and SO EASY!  I added some red peppers that I roasted along with a little chopped onion, bacon, parsley, and my favorite poultry seasoning just to give it a little pizzaz.  Everyone loved it.  Will certainly make again.

I was looking for a quick supper one night and found this recipe. It's great because it uses very simple ingredients, and you can add any other vegetables or meats that you want. Personally, I like sauteèd onions so I added about half an onion worth and it turned out well. I could easily see mushrooms, peppers, olives, diced ham, sausage, or bacon crumbs added to this. Probably not all at once though. haha

My son loves Ramen noodles but would not eat this.  Good!! More for me!  My husband and I really like it a lot. We would not change a thing.  It is very easy and quick to make.  We serve it with fruits or veggies.  Thanks.

I was looking for something to do with my leftover spaghetti noodles and saw this recipe.  I just substituted my left over noodles for the ramen and it worked out great.  I always have left over ramen packets left over from other things so I just used those.  Great easy recipe, thanks!

Thought it was a bit salty--next time I make it I'll cut back on the seasoning packet.  Very fast to make and would make it again in a pinch.

It was good for an easy meal, but not "let's make more!" material. It was too dry and the seasoning packets added too much salt. I could have let it cook a little bit too long ergo the dryness factor. I added peas, milk, and some mozzerella cheese in the egg mixture then cooked it as directed. I might make it again, but not for a long while.

I was hungry, and this was a quick easy tummy filler.  I had pre shredded taco cheese, used that.  Gave it a bit of a Mexican flavor, but I think if I would've taken the time to shred the cheddar, I would've liked it better.  Thanks for the easy recipe!  I will make this again.

My 12 year old with very little cooking experience made this for supper, exactly as posted, when I had a migraine.  She and 3 younger siblings devoured the entire recipe, including the picky eater (no cheese on his quarter).  Wonderfully filling when needing fast and easy, like when Mom is sick.  Definitely needs veggies.  Might add meat.  Better to go low and slow on heat rather than hot.  Worthy of adding into my paper recipe book.

I eat ramen noodles almost every day, and this recipe was a great way to mix it up a bit and add some protein. I split the recipe in half (1 pack ramen, 3 eggs), sauteed some onions, only used half of the seasoning packet, and added some sriracha sauce before the cheese. I recommend using nonstick cooking spray in your pan before adding the ramen and eggs, as it was quite tricky to get off the pan.

Surprisingly good! Im moving internationally and on a tight budget with all my pots and pans already packed .. We are living with odds and ends in the pantry .. I decided to give this a try even though it doesnt sound too good .. I was surprised! And the kids liked it too. I added some Hominey for texture .. I will defiantly make this again and use corn with some other veggies too. The Ramen was like a filling and wasnt bad at all.

Excellent base to build on. My extremely picky and pessimistic boyfriend who loathes ramen noodles absolutely enjoyed it! I am totally stoked about the endless possibilities with this dish. I will continue to make it see what other things I can do with it to really make it pop! Thanks so MUCH for posting this recipe!

I made this by changing the cooking method a little. I put a cast iron skillet on medium low and melted some butter and sautéing a little onion and garlic. Then tossed in the drained an cooked noodles. I spread the noodles out evenly then pours the egg mixture over it and mixed in half the cheese. I let it get to almost set by covering and cooking about 5 minutes on medium low. Then sprinkled with remaining cheese and put in the oven on broil for almost 2 minutes just to melt and crisp the cheese. Next time I will add veggies and maybe meats and my own seasonings. Still a good twist on things you normally have on hand.

It was ok. The main problem was the egg didn't set up like a quiche or frittata should. It ended up being a noodle dish with scrambled egg in it. If that was what I was going for, then it would have warranted more stars, but it wasn't what I was trying to make.

Tasted almost exactly like an omelet.  I followed the directiong exactly but will try it again with more omelet type fillings thrown in for added flavor.  Lots of possibilities!

Easy Dinner! I didn't make as listed cooked chicken with basil and three garlic cloves with a onion chopped up only put one seasoning packet in it. Added that to the cooked noodles and eggs topped with feta cheese and it was fantastic! Also added a can of mixed vegetables for color.

Didn't use the packet of seasoning. Just boiled it for a couple minutes and drained well. I threw in some chopped bacon, that was about it. Doused my portion in hot sauce. Good for a "Dad's gonna be late" dinner.

I am torn between giving this recipes 3 stars or 5, so I compromised & gave it 4 :) My guys loved it. I, however, remembered why I don't make frittatas, sigh. Even with half a cube of butter, it burned. I've always thought that I cook them over too high of heat, but this said medium, & that's what I cooked it at. Everyone said how good it is, awesome & good (which is high praise from my son on the autistic spectrum). Maybe I'll try baking it next time. It was good, I just don't like cleaning pans with burned on food.

I really, really liked this. However my kids who love ramen hated it and my husband thought it was just okay. So instead of five stars I had to give it just four.  I really liked this because it was so easy and something different. I cut the recipe in half and left out a small amount of the noodles because I thought it might get too dry with all of them left in.  I thought the taste of this was just right and it lends itself to a million variations. Next time I'll try it with some peppers and other veggies. The only thing I think I'd change is using american cheese on top instead of cheddar. That's just me though because I have a thing about melted cheddar, I just don't really care for it. I prefer the way american cheese melts. Still though this is really good and really easy and for me those are both great things. I'm so glad I've found frittata recipes...now if I could just get my kids to eat them!!

I like things I can bake and step away from -- things I don't have to watch, so I chose to take the advice of another reviewer here and baked this in a 350 oven for 20 minutes.  It needed more time, so I turned the heat to 375 and baked for five more minutes.  Also, I didn't have the right kind of noodles; I had the kind in the styrofoam bowl.  This was good because it allowed me to add in corn, carrots, and peas.  Nice for color and taste.  I used two of them, cooked them first, drained them, added  1/2 cup of milk, mixed everything together, and topped with cheese.    I like the texture and the appearance.  It needed salsa or hot sauce, as the taste was a little bland -- probably becuase I drained the noodles.  I will cook this again, trying ways to make it better.  When I get it right, I'll serve it to guests.

I give it 5 stars b/c for such a SIMPLE recipe it tastes pretty good. But... I think I attribute that to the Ramen seasoning packet. You can't go wrong with that taste. When I told hubby I was making "fra-ta-ta" he said "rich people food?" I said "nope, its poor people food in disguise." I added lots of garden peppers, hot peppers, onion, fat-free cheese and sprinkled paprika on top to give it that nice presentation (it makes a difference for me- food has to look good too). Five stars for simplicity and "fastness". Thanks for the recipe!

This dish is absolutely amazing! I'm a college kid that eats Ramon Noodles constantly and I was looking for a way to switch it up a little.  I never have much of anything in my fridge and when I looked at the recipe seeing that I had everything it required, I decided to try it instantly.  I love it! It's fast, easy, and like I said, I had everything I needed to make it without a trip to the store.

Very average.  I used Egg beater and sauteed onions and frozen stir fry veggies before adding noodle egg mixture.  I tried it with hot sauce and with salsa - liked it with salsa better.  IF I try this again, will use less egg, less noodle, and more veggies stir fry, onions, bell pepper etc...and perhaps mix salsa in with egg / noodle mixture prior to cooking.

I was surprised that this wasn't too salty with the two packets of seasoning. Not a bad dish! I added a little bit of half and half to the eggs, and first put the the noodles in the pan and poured the egg mixture over them. Instead of trying to flip the Frittata over, I place it under the broiler for 2 minutes. This would be good with crumbled bacon, fresh spinach, chopped ham...Good base to personalize to your liking.

This wasn't bad. I used Chili flavoured ramen noodles which added some *zing*, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I found it a bit dense, so when I make it again, I'll probably add some onions or shallots and maybe less noodles. Otherwise, it was surprisingly good for something so easy !

I tried this recipe and it was really surprisingly good. I do not like ramen, but I made this for the kids. I sauteed green bell peppers and onions in the butter and added a can of chicken breast and seasoned it all with seasoning salt and pepper. The kids loved it (I had to put ketchup on my 2 yr old's). But it was a good way to get them to eat veggies and it actually tasted really good. I'm very satisfied and the kids are too!

Easy and cheap to make.  Tastes like it too.  For an extremely similar tasting dish with even less effort, scramble some eggs with chicken bullion.

Surprisingly good.  I put 1/2 cup shredded cheese in the mixture before cooking and about 3/4 cup of shredded chicken that I had.  I put another 1/2 cup cheese on the top after I turned it.  My son ate almost half of it by himself.  Not an everyday meal, but I will absolutely make it again.

I love this and so does my husband.  (A liking for ramen noodles is a prerequisite for this recipe.)  There is a creamy chicken variety of ramen that works really well, too.  AND it's also really delicious made with mushroom flavor ramen and some sliced mushrooms.  Awesome for non-vegan vegetarians like us.

I added some Mexican cheese, and red and green onions to the egg mixture with some of my own spices. Served with sausage. It was delicious.

I am so excited about this dish! I used one noodle packet and three eggs and cooked the cheese in the pan. It made a ton of food. In the future I'm going to use vegetables. Will definitely make again.

Great versatile recipe using Ramon noodles! You can add just about any chopped meats, veggies, and different cheeses. The possibilities are endless!

This was a very easy recipe and it tasted amazing. Good way to switch up ramen noodles.   I added chicken and I mixed the cheese into it. Will try with different flavors.

Considering how few ingredients it has and how basic it seems, I was impressed. A good meal for the time/effort involved. I love cheese, so of course I added extra. My daughter (20 months old) ate most of what I gave her, yay! Now we'll see how well it reheats . . .

Very flexible recipe - I usually only cook for myself. I use 1 package of ramen and 3 eggs. You can get pretty creative with mixins and other toppings, here is my favorite:

Mix in 2 tbsp of green salsa and 2 tbsp of sliced green onion. 
Top with kernel corn, squeeze of lime, cilantro, and parmesan.

Used Original flavor ramen, added some pepper, pinch of salt, mixed in diced tomatoes and let them cook in. After cooking topped with cheese and diced avocado with a little hot sauce. Great little lunch. Next time I plan on using some bell pepper, and what ever else I can find to throw in.

Simple but yummy for a quick meal.  Made this for my vegetarian daughter who really enjoyed it.  Really is an open canvas, you could add anything you wanted, I added extra sauteed veggies.  Will def make again (and again!)

I made this dish for a potluck I just went to. Everyone loved it!!! The ingredients are cheap and you can customize it to your liking. For me I added bacon crumbles, red and green peppers, and a little chopped carrot. Then I changed two other things. Instead of all the cheese on top I put a little bit in it and then just some on top. The other thing I changed was I cooked it in a casserole dish in the oven at 375 for 20 to 25 minutes. This dish will absolutely be made many more times!

It is fast, it is easy, it is cheap. But with these ingredients its not delicious. Next time I whip this up I'm going to add some broccoli, spinach, onion ...really anything for more flavor and variety. And warning!! One batch makes a TON of food for one person. Certainly worth the try and ill most likely make it again.

This is a Legit dish, I chose to add a diced green onion and garlic to the mix, along with some Lowry's Seasoned Salt... all in all, you can do a LOT worse for a meal that essentially costs about two dollars and feeds four EASY.

kids loved helping to make this dish and to eat it too!  I did change it up a bit. We added 3/4 lb. cooked ground beef and sauteed onion.  mixed together with cooked noodles, eggs, seasoning packets. put in a 9X13 greased dish. sprinkled about 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese and baked at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes - 20 minutes -- being careful not to bake to where the noodles get hard on top. 4 out of 5 of us liked it, that's why the 4 stars.  Hubby thought it could use more spice..I'll try to zip it up a bit next time.

Very easy & quick meal option, & cheap too!

I halved the recipe & then served the frittata with sour cream & salsa on top, it added a little more flavor.  Yummy, & a good twist on just plain ole ramen noodles.

This recipie was extremely dissapointing. There is no real flavor. The whole dish tastes eggy. The cooking directions were not to clear. There was more egg then noodles. I wish I had somthing better to say about this other then its just a Ramen Noodle Omlette.

I have made other Frittata's before and thought this sounded good because I love Ramen Noodles. I used the Picante Chicken Ramen and added some scallions for a little more flavor. It was quite dense and bland even with the scallions and Picante. It was okay, won't make again.

I used the oriental flavor instead and omitted the cheese.  This was in between about a 3 and 4 star, so I gave it the 4 for ease.

Spectacular!!!  Wow...  I just polished off half the pan by myself!  I added onions, green peppers, 1/2 c. cheese, sliced smoked sausage (like kielbasa) and frozen peas before frying it.  So easy!  Delicious!

This tasted ok.  Actually, it tasted like ramen noodles.  I will make it again, but only because it's cheap and easy to make.

I liked this, but didn't love it.

I would make it again, mostly because of it's simplicity.

I made this for dinner last night as a light supper and me and hubby thought it was fantastic!! Yes, you have to love Ramen Noodles and eggs before making this recipe. It turned out great, and I served mine with English muffins. Yummy!!

I was a little skeptic of this recipe at first, but it turned out to be so delicious. It was even better as leftovers the next day!

This is an easy recipe that the kids loved. I make a similar frittata using spaghettini and Swiss cheese. Great served with thick slices of toast. I add green onions to mine. Thanks Judy.

Well I'm not sure what I expected, but I guess I thought this wouldn't taste just like ramen noodles with eggs. Unfortunately that is just what it tasted like. This is easy to make, but I wouldn't make it again.

Easy to make.  Kids thought it was good.  Adults, not so much.

i never thought i would give a recipe containing ramen five stars, but this was absolutely delicious! and it could not have been easier to make. (only changes: i added in the cheese before cooking, and also added a bit of chopped scallions. then i topped with a bit of extra shredded cheese) thanks judy, for this surprisingly great recipe!

This was horrible. I took one bite and spit it out. My 5 year old daughter said yucky!!! I am sorry I wasted 6 eggs on this.

I have Three children and a full time job. This recipe was GREAT! My twins are very fussy as to what they eat. This was a hit! Thank you.
