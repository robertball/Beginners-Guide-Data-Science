I'm sure this recipe is fantastic the way it's written, because we liked it with my changes.  We're dieting at our house and this seemed like a fairly healthy cookie, so I made the following revisions to make it healthier:  whole wheat flour, 2T butter, 1/2 c. applesauce, Splenda brown sugar, 1/2 c. pecans, 2T Cinnamon plus spice blend. I soaked the raisins which helps add moisture to the mix and used an electric chopper to get a finer chop on the apple.  They do have to be formed by hand.  They are a sweet, moist cookie with a good flavor.  We skipped the glaze because they don't need it.  I made a few w/out raisins & nuts for my young girls and they ate them.  And my husband who is picky w/ treats said they tasted healthy, but were really good.  Happy to have found this recipe.  Thanks!

YUM. We went apple picking yesterday and I've been in a baking frenzy... so glad to have found this recipe! I made a bunch of modifications so that the cookies would be super-appley. They came out ridiculously good. Here's what I did: 
1) Put in about FOUR cups of chopped up apple. I know, craziness. 
2) added about 2 cups of rolled oats (to soak up the extra juice from the apples)
3) omitted raisins. I am anti-raisin.
4) doubled the baking soda
5) doubled all the spices and added a touch of ginger
6) used greased cookie sheets instead of parchment 

These changes made for some AWESOME cookies. 

Then I got more adventurous and for the last tray's worth, I added a handful of coconut. WOW!!! That provided a really neat flavor to meld with the apples and walnuts and all the spices. 

My husband has ordered me to get them out of the house immediately, or he will eat them all.

These cookies are delicious.  Very moist and chewy.  I also made them into bars once when I was in a hurry.  Worked out well.

HELPFUL TIPS NOT MENTIONED:  This is wonderful for toddler playgroups because it's healthy & about the only yummy dish that doesn't contain something someone is allergic to (obviously there's no need to add nuts)!  The kids all prefer craisins, and don't complain when I use wheat flour!  If you do add nuts, pecans tend to have more flavor in cookies, so we choose that over walnuts.  We soak our raisins/craisins in warm water while I'm getting the other ingredients ready which allows them to become nice and fluffy to bring out their flavor instead of biting down on dry fruit you can barely taste.  I've also done this several times w/o cloves.  We love sweets in this house, but can't imagine turning this healthy cookie into something that's not by adding the unnecessary glaze.  This turns out to be really soft and we prefer to store this in the fridge or eat right away.  We found no need to use parchment paper especially if you have any decent baking sheet.  One of the few recipes on this site that is delicious w/o a bunch of revisions.

These cookies are delicious-quite a compliment coming from a devout chocolate lover! Because I am not wild about cloves, I did cut the amount called for in the recipe by half-and I used dark brown sugar. My family loved them!A wonderful cookie for the fall season! Can't wait to make them again!

Have just made these cookies with slight alterations and they turned out really well. I love the light, fluffy texture! I only used half of the flour and for the other half I substituted rolled oats. I left out half of the butter and used applesauce instead. And lastly half of the sugar was changed to sweetener. Maybe that is the reason why my cookies turned out really sweet... too sweet actually. I used the sweetener as advised on the packet, the exact amount of the gramms of sugar I wanted and it still didn't work. Maybe next time I won't try to reduce the sugar calories. But overall- loved the cookie!

Very tasty but didn't turn out at all attractive.  As a previous reviewer noted, the batter was quite dry and cookies needed to be formed by hand before baking to keep all the nuts and apples and raisins together.  Next time will add some milk for moisture, chop the apples more finely (1/8 in.) and cut back on the raisins to 1/2 or 3/4 cup.

These cookies are delicious- a little like molasses cookies with fruit.  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe except maybe to double it.  It's clear they aren't going to hang around my house for long!

WOWsers!!!!! These are awesome! Moist and spiced just right. I baked for only 12 minutes and they came out perfectly. They truly don't need the glaze, as they are quite sweet without it. I baked them on foil, shiny side DOWN (as always) and after they cooled, I had only to slide my hand under the foil and peel it gently away from the cookie (as opposed to peeling the cookie off the foil, which you don't want to do because these are delicate and will break) and they released beautifully. I had a big bag of Craisins that had seen better days, so before I began making the dough, I put a heaping cup of them into very hot water and let them stay for about 20 minutes, then drained on paper towels before stirring them into the dough. They add a lot to the cookies, as I'm sure raisins do, as well. I chopped the apple finely, as many reviews said that they found them to not look very pretty, and that's probably because of large apple chunks sticking out here and there. These looked fit for the cover of Bon Appetit. Thank you!

Mmmmmmm! The house smelt sooo good while I was baking these! I didn't use cloves or nuts as I didn't have any, and I probably won't do the glaze because they are so good without it. I used half whole wheat flour too, to make them a bit healthier. You can't even tell I think next time I will use all whole wheat. I don't think I used quite half a cup of butter either, and the batter was a bit dry but I always soak the raisins in hot water first so the moisture from that made the dough perfect. Yum! Will make these all the time from now on!

AMAZING!!! I've made these several times and have been asked for the recipe multiple times! This is like easy apply pie, guilt-free indulgence when it's modiefied! I used half whole wheat and half all purpose flour, half brown sugar and half splenda, (or when I didn't have Splenda I used just 1 cup of brown sugar, which is plenty) half a cup of pecans, two tablespoons of butter and 1/2 cup of apple sauce as suggested. I also added a half teaspoon of vanilla and baked for ten minutes. Makes 26 regular sized cookies. MMMMm mmmm!

These are really really good cookies! I did make a couple major changes to make them healthier and taste super good! First, I added a handful MORE walnuts. Then I added a handful MORE apples. Then I added around a cup or so of dried-cranberries. But I did not apply the glaze since they were already sweet. I then let them cool and stored them in a zip-bloc bag over night. These cookies taste SOOOO much better the next day! And I also cookied mine for 17-20 mins. Since the inside is a bit gooey. But there amazing the next day! follow my changes and your cookies will taste amazing!

These might just be our new favorite cookie ever! So far we have made 5 batches and have not altered the "main" recipe at all. We do, however, omit the frosting. 

Tonight when we made them, our walnut supply ran out. So we substituted pecans instead. Be aware that before adding the apples, it is VERY dry. Don't be alarmed. The apples will moisten them; and while baking, the cookies will spread out like they are supposed to.

We are so addicted to these that we are going to try making them with whole wheat flour next time (just so our guilt level will go down a bit!)

These cookies were incredibly soft and delicious! Only one problem - double the recipe if you want them to last! I soaked my raisins in water for about 2 hours before adding them to the dough and I'm glad I did, prior to adding them the dough seemed really dry - so adding the soaked raisins seemed to give the dough the extra bit of moisture it needed.

Loved this recipe! Apples were a nice touch and glaze added just the right amount of sweetness. Needed to add more liquid - batter was dry.  Will use over and over.

I added 1/2 bag of butterscotch chips, used 1 cup wheat flour, and omitted the cloves. I didn't measure the apples but finely diced 3 apples. I know it was a LOT more than the one cup suggested. The cookies got rave reviews and many asked for the recipe. Yummy and somewhat guilt free???

These made great bars.  No icing necessary.  Baked them in a 10x15 inch pan at 350 for 25 mins.  Spread the batter in the pan with a metal spatula.  Used half whole wheat pastry flour, raw sugar instead of brown, Earth Balance margarine, and only 1/4 tsp cloves and 1/8 tsp nutmeg so not too spicy.  Enjoyed the apples, walnuts and raisins.  Tasted great.  Good, chewy cookie.  Pretty healthy, too, for a cookie!  Thank you for recipe.

Wonderful cookies, very easy to make. I added an extra egg because the final mixture was a bit crumbly and the result was a perfectly soft cookie that still kept its shape. This is definitely a recipe that will be brought up again and again.

I made these delicious cookies today - nearly as the recipe called - other than I thought 1 tsp. of cloves sounded like a lot - I used 1/2 teapoon of cloves instead and left the other spices exactly as the recipe called and the cookies are just wonderful.  I used golden raisins and walnuts and chopped my apples quite fine.  The dough was a bit sticky, however I used a cookie scoop rather than rolling them in balls and I dipped the scoop in white sugar once in a while.  I did not get 60 cookies, but about 48.  They are wonderful., and I did drizzle with lightly with the glaze mentioned in the recipe.

This is the best cookie I've had in a long time. I generously substitute ing depending on what I have on hand. My current favorite is roasted almonds for the walnuts, craisins instead of raisins and a tsp of cardamom with a little less cinnamon. I just can't get enough of this little gem.

Delicious!~ I was scared going in (first time baking on my own), but the cookies themselves turned out moist, wholesome, and have just a touch of fruity sweetness.  I substituted normal flour with whole wheat, and pecans for walnuts (which I think adds a much richer nuttier flavor). 

Trust me, if it's easy enough for ME to make (the Smoke Alarm Queen), you can tackle it, too! =D

I was pleasantly surprised by this cookie. I used splenda brown sugar, allspice instead of cloves (I didnt have any) and a little extra butter (the batter was not coming together) and the end result was delicious. A fluffy healthier cookie. Thank you!

Yummy!!  I made these cookies exactly as the recipe stated (minus the nuts and raisins) and thought they were delicious!  I love the combination of cinnamon/nutmeg/cloves in any recipe - so I personally thought these cookies were to die for!  I would recommend dicing your apples quite small so that you get an apple in each bite!  My cookies turned out soft and puffy on the inside, but just a bit crunchy on the outside!  Will make these over and over again during the fall!

These are awesome! The dough seemed a bit dry so I almost added a splash of apple cider, but I'm glad I resisted - the chunks of apple give off some juice while baking and the end result is a perfectly moist, flavorful cookie.  Didn't even need the drizzle of icing, but I did it anyway.  Great balance of spices and fruit. These will be a regular in our house.  Thank you for sharing!

I guess I took "heaping teaspoon" too literally.  I ended up with 27 very large cookies that took about 19 minutes to bake thoroughly.  But oh what cookies are these!  Thick, cakey, chewy, not too sweet, not too greasy.  I'll be stocking up on parchment paper so I can be ready to make these on a moment's notice!

I LOVE this recipe.  I do not add the raisins, and I shred the apples rather than cut them up.  The cookies are much moister this way, and fluffy.  Family loves them.  Fresh applies make the best cookies.

These were great.  I loved all the chunks. I rolled these into balls rather that drop them the second time to keep the outside soft.  I would love to eat these in the fall with some cider!

I used whole wheat flour, and subsequently added a tablespoon or so of water. Also left out the raisins. These are moist and wonderful. Absolutely my favorite cookie right now.

This recipe needs to be modified to double all ingrediants if you want to have any left overs. This is a very good cookie and easy to make. Hermits are supposed to be dry, and I had no trouble scooping them into balls using a cookie scoop.  Made them exactly how the recipe calls for except I left out the nuts, and I use only Golden Raisins. They are more expensive than the hard black raiseis, but after you try them once you will never go back!  I tried the glaze on the first batch but found the cookie was very good without it and we left the rest plain.

Made this recipe today and it was very close to my family recipe. The only change that I made was adding one more egg and omitted the apples. In their place I added chopped dates in the amount of 1 cup.   It was a bit dry so the extra egg fixed that.  Turned out great.

We cut the nuts, and replaced that with additional apples.  This was amazing, everyone loved them!  I originally made a double batch and had to make another double batch two days later everyone gobbled them up so quickly.

This is such a delicious spice cookie, and they manage to disappear so quickly. The original recipe alone is aces but I modified it to my taste. I'm not a big fan of nuts or rasins in my cookies so I omitted those ingredients and added a cup or two of dried cranberries, added a bit more apple and it was soooo good! Adding more apple and cranberries does make it a hassle to roll into balls, it's a tad sticky and wants to fall apart, so that is a pain, but once you get it, it's worth the hassle. So moist! I was making these for Christmas, so I made the icing with eggnog in the place of milk and my, my, was that a hit!

I omitted the nuts and raisins because of my personal tastes and wish I would have thought to FINELY chop or even grate the apples.  The bigger pieces in the cookies were kind of hard to manage when it came to shaping the dough.  The cookies were SO moist once they were baked that they really should be eaten within a day or two.  It's a yummy fall recipe!

I have made these cookies several times in the last few weeks since I discovered them.  They have been met with rave reviews every time.  The only thing I did differently was add 1-2 T milk to the batter when mixing the dry ingredients and the wet ingredients.  It helped them to combine a little easier.  Great recipe!  Tastes like fall!

I am allergic to walnuts and we don't like raisins much in our house, so I left both of those out, bulked up the apples and substituted 1c. of oats for half the flour. Also found the dough to be a little dry so I added 1/2c. of apple juice to moisten it up. Turned out great!

This is the third and BEST year I have made these cookies. They just keep getting better and better. This year I used organic cinnamon and brown sugar and what a difference!! I recommend all organic ingredients. (I didn't use organic flour but everything else).

I started out liking these because they tasted fine but then I got tired of them really fast.  Also, they are soft and my family likes crunchy cookies best.

Quite good, nicely spiced. I do recommend soaking the raisins at least while you stir the rest up, but perfect as written other than that little tip ;-)

What a delightful cookie!  I loved the combination of the spices with the tartness of the apple and the nuts.  I didn't use the icing, yet it was just superb without it.

These cookies are unbelievable! I made them for my boyfriend because he loves pretty much anything with apples in it. I got tired of making apple pies and apple crisps , so I was very happy when I came across this recipe for something different. They were easy to make and it is easy to put in healthier substitutes (wheat flour for regular flour/Smart balance for the butter). Even with the substitutions, these cookies are very yummy. It has been two days since I made them, and they are almost gone but still have remained moist and chewy. I made them with and without nuts and both taste great. Thank you Aunt Mikie!

These are a very good autumn cookie, but I cannot give them a 5.  They are a tasty oatmeal type (though they have no oatmeal) cookie.  For those who say it is too sweet, you need a life!  If anything, without the glaze, they are not very sweet at all (though I suppose that depends on the apples and rasins to a degree). To get them to better stick together before cooking, I pulsed the nuts and apples in my food processor until they were fairly well chopped and that did work well.

These cookies are just what I was hoping for.  The combination of my favourite spices with the texture of slightly chewy cake is perfect!!! I had to leave out the walnuts due to allergies but can imagine they would be wonderful with the raisins and spices.

These are very good.  I substituted butterscotch chips for the raisins and didn't make the glaze.  I shredded the apples and left out nutmeg and cloves.  These seem to work better with a small scoop rather than the large.  Edit:  changed this from 5 to 4... The flavor is good, but the presentation isn't that great.  They spread quite a bit and don't really hold their shape.

I dunno what I managed to do, but my mix turned out like sand. Maybe I got a bit too enthusiastic with the butter creaming. I added an additional egg and a half a cup of milk to get back to cookie dough. Cookies were enjoyed by all.

I just finished making these cookies and they turned out great!  I ended up adding more than a cup of chopped apples, more like 2 cups.  The batter was very wet so I added a 1/4 of a cup of whole wheat pastry flour and also added a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla because I love vanilla in everything.  Perfect. They are soft and cake like. The whole house smells wonderful.  I will be making these again!

YUMMY!! These hermits are great! I only had 1/2 a cup of brown sugar so I used that plus 1 cup of white sugar and a tablespoon of molasses. Also, the dough was very crumbly so I added about 2 tablespoons of applesauce to moisten it. I did not add nuts or use the glaze,just preference.--  they were GREAT!!

These are amazing!  I am allergic to nuts so I substituted crushed Heath bar chips and they were amazing!  I added cimmamin, nutmeg and a tiny pinch of cloves and vanilla to the glaze.  I flattened the balls of dough a little before they went into the oven.  The toffee gave it a yummy crunchy caramel effect with the sweet raisins and the soft apples - AMAZING!!!  Everyone raved about them and hubby even asked me to make some to bring to work. :)

This is a wonderful recipe especially for fall when apples are in season.  I followed the recipe exactly as written using golden delicious apples ( my favorite baking apple).  Instead of cookies though I baked as bars at the same temperature for about 30-35 minutes.  They came out fantastic.  I didn't get a chance to put on the glaze because my husband had already started eating the bars with such zeal.  This is a winner recipe without alterations.

This is a great cookie full of healthy ingredients.  I gave it 4 stars only because I made some revisions to it.  I omitted cloves as that amount seemed too strong for a mellow, fruity cookie.  I also added wheat flour for a healthier choice.  Then added cherry flavored craisins for a touch of flavor to match the apple.  I then had to cheat a bit because I was craving a bit of sweet...I added white chocolate chips and that a nice touch to compliment the tartness of the apples and craisins.  Perfect for back to school lunches!!

First- I wouldn't recommend these if your not going to finish them the very same day you make them. I made them last night and this morning, they were a mess. I couldn't even pick them up, they fell apart and crumbled to the touch. I was going to package some up for my hubby to bring to work this morning, no chance. He would have to eat it with a spoon. ---- I did make a few changes suggested by other viewers, instead of 2 cups of flour I used 1 1/4 cup of all-purp flour and 3/4 cup quick oats. I added 3/4 cups soaked raisins, 3/4 chopped pecans, and 1 1/2 cup chopped apples. My batter turned out very wet, to wet, maybe due to soaked raisins and apples. I ended up added more oats. I also made them quite big. They were great out of the oven and cooled for 20 mins, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They looked so bad this morning... I didn't want to eat them. Maybe I'll try storing in fridge next time, if I make this again. Also it was to sweet. I would cut brown sugar back to 3/4-1 cup.

Very good! I made them without the glaze and they seemed just abit off but that might have been because I didn't have nutmeg so used allspice.

These are awesome! I took the advice of another reviewer and used 2T of butter and 1/2 cup of applesauce, in place of the 1/2 cup of butter. Also soaked my raisins to get softer and used some dried cranberries as well.  Will be doing these again that's for sure!

I just finished making these and all I can say is "Oh my goodness!" These cookies are amazingly delicious. I kind of panicked at first thinking I had mixed them wrong because the dough was so crumbly. I looked over the recipe then came back and looked here online and Nope I had done it right. When I got back downstairs the dough had begun to absorb the moisture from the apples and this made it easier to shape them into balls to drop on the cookie sheet. The i pressed down on them lightly to make a cookie shape. I would definately reccomend letting the dough sit a few minutes to absorb the apple mosture like I discovered by accident. My husband said these are his new favorite cookies. I may try them again with some dates or craisins next time.

Very good basic recipe, and it allows you to do a lot of customizing.  I grated 2 small apples instead of chopping them, so I didn't have big chunks or any weird texture. I added a handful of oatmeal to help with the extra moisture.  Instead of the glaze, I added 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips.  I probably won't do that next time; no need for extra sweetness.

I made an entire batch yesterday and they are GONE today! I admit, I ate most of them but my 2 year old helped. I am giving this 4 stars because I really think it needs a 2nd egg (which I added). The batter was really dry!! I also recommend making sure you dice your apples pretty fine, mine were a little too big. I put in pecans and did not add raisins. No icing either. I substituted half whole wheat flour, so I wasn't guilty feeding these to my daughter. I think next time I'm going to add some ginger!

These are super good!! For some reason following the directions to a "T" left me with a very crumbly batter. I had to add an extra egg and just a little bit of water to get it workable. Other than that, its a great recipe!!

Honestly, at first I thought I didn't like them. They are not eye-appealing, and I made too much (about 60) for the two of us only. However, two and a half days later, I have realised that they are almost over - no other cookie has disappeared so quickly around here! So, they may not be flashy, but they are quite yummy and addicting! I skipped the glaze, they are perfect as they are.

What a delicious cookie! They are well-spiced, nice and soft and have a wonderful buttery taste! I added replaced 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour with whole wheat, and no one noticed. I didn't put in the nuts, but I will add them next time. I also substituted dried cranberries for the raisins. YUM! I may use applesauce instead of some of the butter and cut back on the sugar slightly next time I make them, so that they will be even more healthy. Thanks for a great recipe!

These are wonderful!  I mostly followed the directions (exceptions: I used only 1/2 tsp of the cloves, and used 1 1/2 cups finely diced apple since that was 1 apple, and omitted the glaze) and I'm glad I did.  They came together very quickly, are very tasty and infinitely "tweakable" which is something I love to do.  :)  I didn't tweak today since I'm bringing them to a block party, but I sure will in the future!  My single batch made 41 cookies.

These cookies are wonderful! I made a few minor changes - 1 and 1/3 cups white flour then 2/3 cups whole wheat. To keep the wheat from drying them out I added 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. Oh and I keep the skins on the apples. Awesome, thanks for a great recipe!

These were so yummy! I put them in jars as a Christmas present to give to some work colleagues and they all stated that they were a delicious soft biscuit. I found the flavour to be subtle yet still there, and the texture was fanstastic.

very good recipe.  As a nutrition student, I am always looking for ways to make sweet things more healthy, and in this case I substituted applesauce for half of the butter.  It tasted perfectly buttery, and had a nice consistency.  After, I realized that I could have also reduced the sugar.  I will next time.

These cookies are delicious! I also made mine per the instructions we have a gas stove with silicone mats, so I did leave mine in a little bit longer. I also omitted the icing and they were perfect - with a cup of hot tea makes a wonderful afternoon treat ;0

Very good cake like cookie. The flavor of this cookie is fantastic, but was a little too sweet. I ended up tripling the recipe but only doubled the sugar. I also chopped the apple supper fine. Also tossed the raisins with the chopped apple prior to baking, they soaked up some of the apple flavor. Cookie was also dry, added milk to get to a drop cookie consistancy. End product was a very moist cookie with great flavor. I took these to my fire department for our meeting night and got rave reviews. Forty hungry firefighters said these were awesome. Guess I may have to make them again.

best cookies ever! I did add aplesauce which added to the moisture, as well as soak the raisins. Didn't bother with the glaze as I wanted them to be healthy, and boy are they ever tasty! thanks for the recipe, will be making often.

We made these, my preschooler and I, for "apple week." Yum, yum, super yum. Couple changes: I used half raisins, half craisins, pecans instead of walnuts, and made an apple juice glaze (although to be honest, they were perfect without it!) Thanks for sharing a killer fall cookie recipe!

excellent recipe.  Easy to make. Everyone requested the recipe for these cookies.  Side note make sure you follow the directions and use parchment paper on your cookie sheets.

Really easy to make, tasty and soft. Instead of sugar and raisins I used organic apple molasses and dried figs ( you may put them in water for a while to soften).. It worked :)

I'm rating this recipe 4 stars because I had to add another 1/2 cup of butter and it only made 45 cookies, not 60. Other wise with the altercations aside, theses are very tasty cookies and my husband loves them! I will make them again but I will be doubling the batch!

This just replaced "Outrageous Oatmeal Cookies" as my favorite dessert.   Perfect with a cuppa coffee.
The dough as made looked like it would be too dry to bake.  It wasn't.  I do wish I had chopped the apple to be more fine, more of a dice than a chop.

I loved the sound of this recipe with all of the spices in it. I didn’t have fresh apples.  I did have a bowlful of uneaten, golden delicious apples that were drying out. 


After peeling and chopping all the apples I found I had exactly 4 cups, so I appreciated CIG’s info on upping the recipe.  


I didn’t have more than one cup of oats so I added the extra flour and doubled the baking soda.  I added 3 tsps of cinnamon, 2 tsps of clove.  I stuck with the .5 tsp nutmeg and added .5 tsp ginger.  I only had about a .5 cup of pecans so I chopped and added those.  I should have just pressed the halves into the top of the cookie for better effect.


I didn’t skimp on the butter, but I only had 1 cup of dark brown sugar and I used 1 cup unsulphured molasses for the rest.  So that came up a little short on the sugar, but I’m okay with that.  If I decided I wanted them sweeter I could always do the glaze.  That would probably help them look prettier too.


I can use any dried fruit, but had raisins to get rid of and soaking was needed to plump them up.


So, the batter initially came out very wet. Probably because of the molasses and 4 eggs.  I added another cup of flour and another .5 tsp of baking soda.


I baked at recommended temp for 15 min.

I followed this recipe to the word and these cookies were amazing. I got 2 dozen out of 1 batch on Friday night.  When my boyfriend came home he had one, when he went to work the next day and when he came home he was like what happened to all the cookies there are only like 10 left. Opppps I ate them. I am the one that will usually have 1 cookie and be good. The were perfect not to sweet not to hard.  The batter after mixed and at first it seems better to use your hands to roll and put on the cookie sheet. DON'T DO IT, use the spoon works 100 times better. Hope you enjoy them as much as  I did.

Love these cookies :)  Only used the Apple but soaked in 1/4 cup of Pineapple Juice first and added the Pineapple juice to the mix.

Made a nice moist cookie!

I loved this recipe, but I changed a few things.   I swapped raisins for butterscotch chips, and walnuts for slivered almonds.  I also added a tsp of vanilla extract.  In hindsight, I should have only put a half cup of butterscotch in, and it would have been enough.   If you really like apples, I suggest adding and extra half a cup of apples.

Just made these but I guess too much moisture in the apples, it all just spread out on the sheet into one big goo. I scooped it up when cooled and put it in muffin tins, cooked another 15' pretty good now and delicious batter. I'll try again and squeeze out the apples.
Made them again - the first time I did only 1 C. flour/1C. oatmeal and didn't squeeze the crushed apples to get moisture out.  Second time I did 2C. flour/1/2 C oatmeal and got extra liquid out of apples, came out very light, puffy, still super moist and quite tasty.

Excellent! Look forward to making these often. I used light butter and a little applesauce, also added a little allspice for a bit more spice, otherwise made as written without the glaze.  Thanks for sharing Aunt Mikie!

Great recipe!! I made some changes.  I didn't add cloves and nutmeg because I didn't have any.  I used 1/4 cup+ 1tb homemade applesauce, cut butter in half and left out milk.  It turned out great! Will keep the recipe! Thanks!!!

Excellent! No changes necessary except just a note that the dough does not spread out so if you make little balls on the sheet, that's what you'll get from the oven.

Excellent recipe. I was concerned that the batter looked dry, but after reading some other comments, I left it as is. The cookies turned out moist after baking. I did add a teaspoon or so of vanilla, because I love it. Like others suggested, I substituted pecans and dried cranberries, because that is what I had on hand. I used about 1 1/2 c of apple. I omitted the icing, because they are already delicious without it. Yum!

These were just okay for me. The batter was incredibly hard to work with and they just didn't end up with all that much flavor. The UPSIDE of these cookies is that I can give them to my two year old and he thinks he's getting one of the usual unhealthy cookies but they aren't nearly as bad for you.

LOVE these cookies!! I followed the recipe exact, minus the icing.  Wow - will definitely make these again! I got a few apples from the daycare where I work, someone had gone apple-picking and shared some apples. I have no idea what kind of apple I used which is too bad, but they weren't pretty and was a little bruised so I used the unbruised sections for chopping up and they were really good in these cookies.  The apple was a little juicy, and a little tart. Yum!

This was the most difficult cookie dough to work with. It was heavy and sticky. Cookies fell apart easily. It was a lot of work and didn't taste that great. I will make an apple cake or pie before I try apples in cookies again.

I loved theses cookies, They were gone in my house after 3 days and it made 45 cookies. I made a few changes: I switched raisins to dried cranberries, and I used white whole wheat flour. We don't like raisins at my house so that was the reason of the swap.

I just made these and brought to a get-together. EVERYONE wanted the recipe. They are deliciously different. I didn't change anything, except to refrigerate the dough before rolling it into balls for baking because it's pretty sticky otherwise. Following other reviewers advice I did not use the glaze.

This recipe was delicious and easy. I did change the flour to whole wheat, couldn't tell. And I left out cloves, nutmeg and the nuts, because I didn't have it. Still turned out great. You do have to use your hand a bit to shape, but a great cakie cookie, my favorite! Kids and husband enjoyed!!

Very good recipe!  These cookies were very tender and sweet enough.   They do not require icing.  I used chopped prunes instead of raisins.  This substitution worked well.

I used 1 C. AP and 1 C. whole wheat flour, added a teaspoon vanilla extract, soaked the raisins before using, added a touch of ground ginger, used 1/4 C. egg substitute, one unpeeled medium size apple (which gave me about 1.25 cups of chopped apple), and 4 tbsp. butter and 4 tbsp. I Can't Believe It's Not Butter.  These are delicious-full of all those yummy fall flavors!

Really nice spice cookie, tons of flavour and a great texture. I ommitted the nuts and raisins (simple because I didn't have any) and added some chocolate chips instead; I thought it could be weird but the chocolate complimented the spices great.

These cookies were really good. I followed the exact recipe. The dough was crumbly but you can easily hand form it into a ball to bring it all together. They were really moist too.

very moist and tasty! I had to add milk, batter crumbly even after soaking raisins, grating apple and letting dough sit for 30 minutes. I used ww flour instead of ap and omitted nuts due to allergy. Had to bake for 20 minutes as they were gooey after 14.

I used CrazyItalianGrandmother's suggestions (4 c apples, double spices and baking soda, added 2 cups rolled oats, used cookie sheets). I also used someone else's suggestion and soaked the raisins in water while I prepped so they were juicier when they came out of the oven. I also had to add some of the soaking water to wet the batter. The results were received with mixed reaction. Some loved them, some didn't care for them. I myself loved them, though!

I think this may be the first recipe I've reviewed on this site. I like this recipe as some other reviewers mentioned because it is good without major revisions. I love spiced things and these are really tasty. My only changes were I cut the sugar to one cup, used whole wheat flour, and soaked the raisins as another suggested. The glaze is really unnecessary. Will make these again for sure!

The recipe was great as it is! Though omit the confectioner's sugar and milk! You don't need the icing because the cookie tastes great as it is. Though if you want to (and don't mind the calories) this will taste fantastic with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. But forget the icing!  Other tips: 1. leave the skin on the apple and try using a mix of 2 (or 3) apples. 2. if the dough seems too dry, just add a litle water. I happened to have some apple juice so I used that instead.  Wow, this one's a keeper!

My family loved these and I can feel pretty good about them nutritionally. I baked them in a baking dish and they reminded me of blondies. The one problem I had was getting them baked enough to NOT be gooey. Of course, that may be a result of substituting organic Kamut flour, which tends to be a little heavier but has an awesome flavor.

Add Oatmeal!!  Used Sweetened Dried Cranberries instead of raisins and soaked them in hot water to soften. Ended up adding a bit too much liquid and they turned out slightly more like cake.

I had a lot of apples that I had to use and decided to give this a try.  In our opinion, there was way too much spice in these.  They turned out very soft, too.  Don't know if I'd waste my time making these again, but it didn't get rid of a few apples!

Wonderful recipe, though I did make a few changes. I use whole wheat flour, applesauce instead of butter, and eggbeaters instead of eggs. Also, I use closer to a cup and a half of apples, but I leave out the nuts and raisins. I also leave off the glaze- these healthy cookies don't need to be ruined with a sugar coating. Additionally, I found that the dough didn't really stick, so I add a little less than 1/4 cup of water to each batch. Just be careful not to add too much water!  I highly recomend this recipes to anyone looking for a delicious, healthy treat. I am now well-known at my school for my "awesome" cookies, largely thanks to this recipe.

I was looking for something to send to my daughters pre-school class when I found this. I substituted soaked craisins for the raisins and made some with and some without the nuts.  They were awesome! I smooshed some down and let some stay fat. The flatter cookies were more attractive but the fat ones stayed more moist on the second day. After that I couldn't say because they were all gone.

These are GREAT!!! I am baking them now and just had the first one out of the oven. I didn't add nuts because I don't like them. I was a bit nervous about the mixture-it was really dry until I added the fruit. I followed the recipe otherwise and they are perfect. I found that 10 minutes was enough time in the oven for my cookies, too long and they tasted oddly

tastey lil cookies. I did not add the walnuts or raisins b/c I didnt have any. I thought without these items, the cookies could have used some more apples. I think it might even be better if you precooked the apples in butter and brown sugar. I will try that next time. But over all a keeper.

This is a delicious, healthful fall cookie! I skipped on the icing and followed the others' tip of soaking my raisins, craisins, and other dried fruit mix in hot water to let them get full and juicy. I also chopped the apples into about 1/4 inch cubes. Didn't have any problem with the apples falling out. My cookies stayed moist well into the next day without having refrigerated. I cut down on cloves (personal preference) and may do so even more next time. I think these are a great holiday cookie when you want to use some seasonal apples!

These are really tasty! I ran out of walnuts at about 1/2 cup, so I added 1/2 cu pecans. I also omitted the raisins, and following the recs of other reviewers, I added about  2 tablespoons of milk and about a tablespoon of apple cider. they were a hit!

These came out GREAT!  Just made them and my house smells so good :)  I didn't have cloves or nutmeg, so used pumpkin pie spice instead, really nice flavour!  Pre-soaked my raisins and didnt have nuts.  I think next time I would put more cinnamon though.  GREAT RECIPE!!

I used white chocolate chips and apples only (didn't have raisins or nuts LOL) and I added 1/2 a tsp of ginger just because I felt like it... I also used a cup of wheat and a cup of white flour...but that's all the changes I made and I will be making these again and again and again!!! Thank you!

Now that I've made these a few times I have some helpful insights into getting these the way you'd like. The more apple you add, the more cake like the cookies will be. If you keep the apple to one cup, the cookies will be chewy like Rachael or Mandlin's photos. If you add more apple, they will be more like pumpkin cookies. You can see that kind in most of the photos. If you add more apple, your dough will be less dry, but it will change your cookie's texture. If you like the cookies chewy, just work with the dry, more crumbly dough. The cookies still taste wonderful and if you dice your apples finely or grate them, they stay together better. We omit the raisins and add butterscotch or white chocolate chips instead. We also like to add 1/2 tsp ginger. If you like chocolate covered lebkuchen, you can make the cookie as described, but add 1/2 tsp ginger and once the cookies are cool, dip in 1 cup of chocolate mixed with 1 tbs shortening (and melted together). Really good. Also, I add half whole wheat flour like some, and my kids can't even tell.

these taste EXCELLENT!!!  I was skeptical putting apple in a cookie but they are so divine! the only problem I ran into was getting the dough to the right consistency. It was quite crumbly so I tried to form cookies by squishing it in my hands and it was SUPER sticky!!! eek! I would recommend adding an extra egg and just spooning the douh onto the cookie sheet! I also only used half of the ground cloves.. it seemed that 1 tsp. would be a bit overpowering... GREAT cookies overall though!! I used only 1 cup of sugar and added the glaze! FANTASTIC!!!

These were great, my son loved them.  They turned out a bit hard, but if you stick them in the microwave for about 7-10 seconds, they soften right up.

I work for an all organic farm and made these cookies with all organic ingredients and they turned out wonderful! I brought them for all my co-workers and they were eating them all day. I used organic whole white spelt flour and they went flat and chewy and then used organic lightly sifted spelt flour and they turned out fluffy and cake like. I'll be making these again!

I was looking for a good apple/cookie recipe when I stumbled upon this one. I actually left out the apples for the first two batches, left out the glaze completely, and added a tablespoon of ground ginger. The cookie alone reminds me of a soft gingerbread or molasses cookie. They're fairly small as a sing tablespoon because mine didn't flatten (i did flatten the apple batch, still a bit small) BUT they were great and actually make me feel a bit festive. I might make them w/out apples and glaze for a holiday party! [:

Turned out really great. I only made half the recipe and got 20 cookies. My dough was actually a bit wet. I used granny smith apples (diced like tomatoes), Blue Bonnet homestyle spread, less sugar, egg whites, and soaked the raisins in hot water for 15 min. I think the spread was what made the dough wet (plus I used one egg instead of 1/2 because I was only using the whites). I also used my hand to mix the dry ingredients with the wet ones and when I put the nuts, raisins, and apples in. I wasn't exactly sure what size to make them though because 30 cookies seemed to be an awful lot for the dough I had. Next time, I will make the whole recipe but with less raisins. But all in all, they turned out fantastic! Definitely recommend!!!

I love making these cookies! I don't like walnuts, so I don't use them. Also, I never make the glaze because I don't like putting glaze on any of my desserts. But these cookies still deserve 5 stars!

I made these today for a Pot Luck at church and everyone LOVED them.  I did put my egg and raisins in a blender to chop the raisins fine.  I also made an icing using butter, milk and confectioners sugar and spread thinly on top of cookie.  I could not believe how fast they went - DELICIOUS!!!!!!!

I shipped these to my boyfriend who is in the navy and he said that they were delicious. I used granny smith apples and I used golden raisins because we have a lot of them where I work at. I love how spicy these cookies are. you can really taste the cloves.

Very tasty and moist. Used 1 granny smith apple. Didn't make the icing, and cut the sugar to 1c, though could probably even do with less. Thinking about adding some chocolate chips next time!

Yummy! I was happy to find a recipe to help me use up some apples and raisins without oats (I ran out.) I didn't have nuts to use, but I will use them next time. They still were great without the nuts. I think I may cut 1/2 cup of sugar next time, too, because they were quite sweet. I didn't make the icing for that reason. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour, too. Thanks for a good recipe!

Absolutely wonderful! Tastes just like the hermit bars my mom got for us from the bakery. Love the cloves. Making the cookies was sticky, and I found it's easier done as a bar. So good, though.

These yummy spicey cookies were all gone in under 2 hours and my family and been relentlessly begging me everyday to make more.  The only change I made was to sub dried cranberries for the rasins as was all out.

I loved these, I used a cookie scoop and only got 48. Also I only had about 2/3c walnuts and was out of nutmeg so I used allspice. Skipped the frosting they were sweet enough. My apples were really tart but even so I think I could've gotten away with less sugar.

These were awesome!  Originally I baked them for my son, but my husband and I were soon eating them too.  I didn't use the sauce on them and they were still delicious.  I did have one problem which I deem completely my fault!  They turned out very flat and a bit crumbly, anyone know why?  I did use mostly oat flour, and smidge of flax meal could that have been the cause?

Yummy.  I just ate one of these hot out of the oven and it is so good as is. I haven't even got to the glaze part yet.  I didn't have 1 cup of rasins so I used 1 cup of dried mixed fruit (cranberries,rasins,apple and pineapple)

Delicious. I'll probably never make these again considering I can't keep my hands off them. Kidding, of course. Didn't have walnuts but I have a feeling it will be awesome. I used ground oats, wheat flower, and added a little ground flax. So good. Might cut back on the sugar next time though. Good job!

These were good, but nothing spectacular.  The glaze is a must.  Otherwise, they're lacking something.  The dough alone I would give 5 stars.  I wish I would've just eaten that without baking them at all!!

These cookies were really yummy even though I messed up the recipe by putting the confectioners sugar INSIDE the dough...oops.  They still were great despite the flub.  Will make again, but the right way next time:)

Delicious flavor, but seemed a little too chunky to hold cookie together. A few small changes (cutting apples smaller and using parchment paper--whatever that is) may help.

Great recipe.  I changed up the frosting used cream cheese, powdered sugar, and milk to make it.  The frosting was great.

These were yummy.  They were a little tough to get to stick together before baking them, but they taste really good.  Perfect for a fall day.

Taste good, but the cookies were mushy the next day (perhaps I didn't bake long enough).
