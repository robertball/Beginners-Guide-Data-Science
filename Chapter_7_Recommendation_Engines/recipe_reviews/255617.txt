This was excellent. My husband ate pepper and all, and he usually leaves the pepper and just eats the filling.  The only question I had was that the recipe doesn't say if you are supposed to put them back in the oven after filling them, but my potatoes and peppers were cooled off enough that I thought they would be better reheated a little. So I sprinkled the tops with more cheese and put them in a 350 oven for about 15 minutes or so. Then I put the cream topping and the rest of the bacon on after taking them out.

I made this for Valentines Day dinner and it was the bomb! I left a little of the charred skin on the peppers because we like it that way and added more cheese even though it wasn't necessary. My timing was off and these ended up getting cold before the rest of my meal was done so I stuck them under the broiler for a few minutes right before serving and this was a nice touch as well. The stuffing got a nice golden crunch on the top layer. These were excellent! I had the privilege of spending time  with the lovely ladies that created this recipe  as it was being created so I thought maybe I was just being partial but hubs had no idea this was their recipe and he raved about it the rest of the night. He even asked if I made any extras so that he could take one to work and show off. 5 stars all the way!
