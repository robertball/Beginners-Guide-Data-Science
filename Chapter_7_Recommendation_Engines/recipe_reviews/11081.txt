To keep the frosting from being granular be sure and frost the brownies when they're still warm! My father in law and friend's husband started counting how many they saw each other eat...funny!

My friend makes this recipe but she adds mini marshmallows to the top when the brownie part is done cooking then returns it to the oven to melt the marshmallows cools then frosts. I used a smaller baking pan and mine came out thick and cakey with longer baking time needed (I don't have a jelly roll pan). I didn't make the frosting but the brownie was delcious.

It was more like cake than a brownie. It was not chocolately enough and the sugar did not dissolve well in the icing even though I left the icing on the heat longer than I would have otherwise.

i have the same recipe it was handed down to me from my grandmother about 37 years ago. the only differnce is that she added 1/4 cup of mini marshmellows let them melt and then pour over the cake.

These were pretty good although the icing came out a little granular once it cooled. A great way to get rid of old chocolate sauce in the fridge. I took them over to a bunch of my guy friends and they demolished them (but I'm pretty sure they don't chew). Had several comments on leaving off the icing next time. I'll let you know!

Hmm...ok. I'm the "baker" of the family and am always cooking one thing or another. I like to use homemade recipies because those have no hydrogenated oil. Even though I'm a teenager I've made a lot of brownies and I followed this recipe to the letter. (I ommited the frosting entirely though.) The brownies were good but I recommend less butter (it didn't blend well) and less sugar. The mix was thin and resembled a cake more. I added melted marshmellows and that improved the flavor a ton (: hope this helps.

Love these brownies. The frosting seems to turn grainy or sugary. I did exactly as the recipes called for and frosted the brownies while they were still warm but it still turned grainy. My aunt's recipe called for 1 c. sugar insteadof 1 1/4c. plus 8 large marshmellows(1 large =8 mini's) and boil 1 minute instead of 3 minutes and then on low till marshmellows melt. I think the boiling three minutes turns it too grainy. Add the marshmellows with the chocolate chips.

Almost everyone loved these and they were SUPER easy to make. I think I'll use less sugar next time but then again perhaps because I used Betty Crocker Chocholate Frosting in lieu of the can of chocholate syrup...I did lessen the white sugar to 1/2 a cup or so though. Still it turned out like a nice light sweet cake (not quite a brownie tho)...not very chocolatey (i'll add more chocholate chips next time)...I cut them into bite sized pieces and ended up eating 1/2 the cake by myself while watching tv. egads! dangerous....but basically foolproof yay!

batter is very thin ie 1 1/2 cup of fluid to 2cup solid is very poor ratio for brownies

An 80 year old friend of mine explained that she never made homemade brownies after the invention of boxed brownies because homemade never seemed to turn out as good. I have to agree with her on this sentiment to date. I found this recipe kind of dull - not chocolaty enough and the icing was just sweet. I will continue to search for a perfect homemade brownie none-the-less. It is a super easy recipe (in defense) and likable enough to prepare as a last minute desert.

The brownies turned out better with a little help: 1) less butter I would use a half cup instead of a whole. I drained about 4 TBSP off after baking with the original amount. 2) less eggs with all the reviews saying they were cake like I used only 3 eggs. 3) substitute 1/2 cup brown sugar for that gooey moistness most are looking for in a brownie. After these changes I came out with a better final product.

These were a major hit at my sister's birthday party. Absolutely delicious. They can be a bit rich but if you tone down the amount of chocolate (or maybe it's because mine was dark) it should be excellent but I think they are already magnificent.

These are just not brownies. To me brownies are chewy on the bottom and crispy on the top. Brownies taste like chocolate. These are squishy all the way through and they taste like sugar. I am disappoint.

Pretty dang delicious! I am a total chocoholic though and after reading past reviews I added an extra heaping tablespoon of cocoa powder and a couple squirts extra syrup (I had a bottle not a can). I also put the chocolate chips in the brownies and skipped the frosting. the result was super fudgey and chocolatey! Thanks for a great basic recipe- perfect for experimenting!

Chose this brownie recipe over the others because i already had all the ingredients. Once i read the review about it being cake-like i followed one of the reviewers suggestions (drkauffman) for a chewier version which were: 1) less butter I would use a half cup instead of a whole. I drained about 4 TBSP off after baking with the original amount. 2) less eggs with all the reviews saying they were cake like I used only 3 eggs. 3) substitute 1/2 cup brown sugar for that gooey moistness most are looking for in a brownie. After these changes I came out with a better final product. I also omitted the frosting and added the chocolate chips right to the batter. It was still too cake-like for a brownie but the flavor was pretty good. For those of you looking for a true chewy brownie look else where

This was okay. Maybe it would have been better had I not substituted more chocolate syrup for the cup of sugar. The texture was less brownie-like and more fluffy but not cake-like. And b/c of the substitution it wasn't too sweet which I did like. A good complement to ice cream or something else.

These aren't the best brownies but they are still pretty good. They have the consistency of cake but other than that I liked them.

I brought this in for my 7th grade FACS class. We had a ton of fun making it and it turned out great! YUM!
