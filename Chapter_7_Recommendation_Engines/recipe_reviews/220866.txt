Pan-fried Falafel Haiku: "Followed recipe, but didn't use all that oil. Taste was super-great!" I've found that when making falafel or black bean patties, that it's much easier to patty 'em up in plastic wrap and freeze them for as long as needed until ready to prepare. They hold together much better, and go easily from freezer to skillet. Oh, and while I used all the ingredients and followed the directions, I didn't use all that oil, as it didn't seem necessary; they browned up nice and crispy just fine w/ just a light coating of EVOO in the pan. Ate mine w/ Sriaracha; TASTY!

Made these tonight, and they turned out great! Flavor was fantastic, they weren't too dense or mushy, and fried up nice and crispy on the outside. They did fall apart a little while frying, but I think they just needed to be formed into tighter patties. Definitely a keeper!

The taste of these were just too strong to me and they are also really dense. I was unsure, if I had gotten to the right texture. I believe a little less than 1 cup of bread crumbs would have been fine. I was thinking because they were homemade, and from the main pic, that they might be a little more mild tasting or lighter. The recipe came up when I searched for a recipe with beans. It looked pretty easy, and I had the ingredients on hand, but it took me a long time to make them between the blending, mixing, frying, clean-up, etc. I decided to cut the frying oil amount in half and quite honestly, could have cut it back even further after making them. These are pan-fried, but even half the oil covers them completely while cooking. If you like traditional falafels and fried foods, though, you may enjoy these.

Made this as a side for my Indian Butter Chicken.  Was a little heavier than I anticipated but the flavors were great and they were delicious.  Not too dry but always good with sauce.

This was great! I've never made falafel before and this recipe looked easy. It took me a little while but probably just because it was my first falafel attempt. I didn't have coriander so i put in some celery seed. Also left out the parsley. Tasty!
