This is a "repeat" recipe that we enjoyed. Great for any meal.  I pre-baked the crust, 20 minutes and used a pie shield to prevent the edge from burning during the 2nd bake.  1 tsp salt  was too much. I used pepperjack (all I had) with mozzarella since i don't like the pepperjack flavor.

ok so I have my crust in the oven now and I don't think this is working because there is a pool of potato-water in the pan....the potatoes are very soggy and while I tried to squeeze out the water, apparently I didn't do enough.  The recipe says nothing about straining or squeezing out the potatoes....I shredded my own and did not use frozen hash brown mix, but the recipe does not say either way.  so for now....two stars.

What a nice recipe--like a quiche with a hash brown crust.  I used shredded new potatoes (skin on), and baked in a 9.5" glass pie pan, which worked well.  This recipe is a good base to modify based on your flavor preferences--next time I will add green onion, more spices, and possibly a stronger cheese like gruyere.

This is a great brunch dish.  The eggs hold everything very well, and it can be seasoned to taste.  Highly recommended!

Very good! I will be making it again as this recipe is a keeper. Next time I think I will add some green peppers and minced garlic. I did bake the hashbrown crust for 20 minutes prior to adding egg/ham mixture and found that to be a good recommendation from others.

This recipe was good but next time I will make a few changes. I did bake the potato crust for 20 min. before adding the filling and it still could have baked longer for a crisper bottom crust. I substituted sausage for the ham and added green peppers and some hot sauce and paprika.It tasted really good but I would add some extra spices next time to spice it up for our liking. Thanks for the breakfast recipe-it was a great Easter breakfast for us!

I was looking for a breakfast option but didn't want to go to the store.  This recipe was perfect because we had everything on hand.  I baked the potato crust first for 15 minutes and next time I will bake it even longer to brown before adding the filling.  I also added one clove of garlic for a little extra flavor.  Otherwise a good simple recipe for an easy one dish breakfast.

A pleasant pie, ideal luncheon fare. As one guest is vegetarian I omitted the ham and added a little extra cheese.The next time I make this pie I will put the dish lower in the oven in the hopes of crisping up the bottom crust. My original one was some what soggy.

I loved this recipe because it was fast to prepare and made good use of leftover ham. While it cooked I prepared a salad cleared the kitchen opened a bottle of wine and dinner was ready! Great.
