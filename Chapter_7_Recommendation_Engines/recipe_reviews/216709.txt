I used red turnips that I had planted in a foodplot.  After my daughter picked some I had to try something.  These were wonderful.  I used a dark lager.  You don't taste the beer but the turnips taste like a potato.  The whole family enjoyed them.

I really liked this simple recipe. I used a large yellow turnip which is harder than a normal white turnip. After an hour in the oven, it was still hard, so I boiled the whole mixture on the stove top. It was well worth the extra effort as it came out perfect. In fact, this dish could be addictive!

I used a bottle of stout on a larger portion of turnips than the recipe called for.  The beer never baked off, and the taste of the braise was overpowering.  This is the first recipe I've tried from the site that was definitely not a success
