I haven't tried this recipe, but I thought I would let everyone know the cecret to mac n cheese from a box. Make it according to the box directions, Adding about a tablespoon more milk. Then add 2 slices american cheese, and 1 tablespoon of philly  cream cheese. Stir over low heat until melted. This is the best.

I was looking for a way to make low-fat mac and cheese, and this is definitely it! Didn't taste low-fat at all, and even better than regular mac and cheese in a box made with tons of butter. It was, indeed, very creamy and VERY simple and cheap to make. Not only that, but the servings were pretty big. I ended up using cream of mushroom, because that was what I had on hand, and it was pretty good. Next time I will try the cream of chicken, or maybe even cream of brocolli. I do suggest adding the 1/4 cup of milk, as it may be a bit gooey without it. This is the way I will be making boxed mac and cheese from now on.

I'll stick with the recipe on the mac & cheese box. This was gummy and weird -- not even ketchup could save it. 11-year-old son and husband concur.

This is a good base recipe to add things to.  I added cooked chicken breasts and broccoli to the boiling macaroni the last few minutes before it was done.It turned out very delicious and was a super easy meal. Add pepper to taste.

I gave this 4 stars because The Boy loved it but I, myself, didn't care for it at all. It was very, very salty so I think the next time I make it, I'll use low-sodium soup. The recipe didn't call for any milk, but I think it would taste better with about 1/4 c. or more added with the soup. This makes a super-creamy pasta dish that would be great comfort food if it were a bit less salty.

I thought this one was really good. My 2 yr old daughter and 1 yr old son loved it. That's all it takes to get a good rating out of me, my kids are very picky eaters. I, however, actually liked this recipe also. I prefer my mac and chesse with extra butter, salt and pepper, but this was actually pretty good. I will definitely make it again.

This recipe is very easy but it is not very tasty.  It is too salty for our taste.

Used what I had on hand, which was white cheddar Kraft mac. This recipe is not my favorite, tastes more like chicken than cheese. Next time Iâ€™ll see if only adding half the can of soup with regular Kraft does it.

This was ok for something different, but I wouldn't make it again.
