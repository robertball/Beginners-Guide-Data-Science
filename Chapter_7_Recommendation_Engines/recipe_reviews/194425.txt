You're right on using sour cream in eggs.  It is a great dairy item to use even without the cheese.  This is a great variation on a brilliant theme.  My favorite is chive but any herb will do just great.  ENJOY!

I make my scrambled eggs like this all the time. But sour cream or creme fraiche goes in AT THE END. Just about 30 seconds before you plate them. Most pictures I've seen of this show the eggs are overdone. Scrambled eggs should be creamy ALL the way through. The crux of them is that they should finish cooking ON THE PLATE.

Mmmm this was a quick and easy breakfast.  The only thing I added was a sprinkle of sharp cheddar cheese on top, just because I like the bite.  I think this would be great to serve for breakfast or brunch if you're having people over...it's fresh, quick, can easily be made in large quantities if you multiply the recipe, and the basil adds an unexpected twist that makes this dish seem a little more "gourmet" than regular old scrambled eggs.  Thanks timbertiger!

I never added sour cream to scrambled eggs but Hubs and I found we enjoyed it. Since there was already mozzarella and fresh basil going on here I added halved grape tomatoes, instantly creating "Eggs Caprese."  If you like Caprese salad, you'll like these eggs too. Nice.

Quick, easy and delicious breakfast!  I used chives and shredded Colby-Jack cheese.  Adding the sour cream gives the eggs a nice smooth texture.  My whole family liked them.  I love the fact that they are versatile.  You can add whatever herb and cheese you want.  Thanks for sharing!  I will be making these again.

Delicious breakfast. I added basil pesto because I love the galic taste. I can't believe I've been eating eggs so plain all these years.

It tastes wonderful.  To add flavor, i mixed in minced garlic.  I tried diced fresh tomato but i wouldn't recommend it, the fluid made everything sort of runny, even when it was all cooked.

Wow - these really are "Creamy and Cheesy"! I would have never thought to use sour cream in scrambled eggs before, but it was a nice change. I added a little garlic and used a combination of mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. I also added some cherry tomatoes for some additional color and flavor. Plus what goes better with fresh basil than fresh tomatoes? This was great for breakfast with a side of whole grain toast and OJ!

Loved this recipe for even a late night snack, I actually added diced tomatoes and jalepenos, it gave a great twist and a little flare.  My husband and I are huge fans of spicy, savory food!  All in all this is a great recipe.

Very good. I used green onions instead of basil because I needed to use them up. I look forward to using basil next time! My husband really enjoyed this!

Very tasty.  Out of curiosity, tried this as an alternative to my usual scrambled eggs, because this is somewhat similar.  I will stick with my recipe, however, because the results are at least as good without all of the cholesterol.  You can replace at least half of the eggs with silky (soft) tofu, cutting the fat content drastically.  I use cheddar (fat-free is okay and more healthful) instead of mozzarella for the added flavor, and I use more fresh basil, preferably without mincing it.  As an option, avocado and mushrooms both add a lot.  With plenty of cheese and the optional ingredients, you don't even realize that your eggs are really faux scrambled eggs!  I also cook them in olive oil instead of butter.  In short, mine is not a modification; it is a different recipe with health benefits.

Made these for a Sunday breakfast and we really enjoyed them.  We had just picked up some fresh basil last night, so the basil was just filled with flavor.  Had to substitute Monterrey Jack for the mozzarella and it was great.

Surprisingly good! Serve alongside some cold poached salmon, a FRESH fruit cup (peaches!), and a special toast or muffin and you'll think you woke up at a Bed & Breakfast!  Using a Teflon pan will help you get the eggs out of the pan.  I also liked  substituing sharp Cheddar for the Mozzarella and adding a dash of garlic powder as someone suggested.  Another idea I like... is topping my sunnyside-up eggs with a few small basil leaves a minute or so before they're done... adds color and spice to them!!

These are simply fabulous eggs.....love them, love them, love them.  All 3 kids (11,8 & 4) enjoyed them too.  I'm sure hubby will devour them :)  I was all out of basil so I used diced green onion instead and they still turned out wonderfully.   I needed a new egg recipe for my low carb way of eating and this is perfect.  Thanks so much for sharing.

Yum! But instead of just adding minced basil I added some pesto I had on hand. Also a mixture of mozzarella and parmesan for the cheese. I had never tried sour cream before in eggs. Delicious! And super easy.

Found this while looking for something different for our usual Sunday morning brunch.  Followed the recipe except that I used 5 cheese Italian because I had just about 1/2 cup left from another dish earlier in the week.  At the end, I stirred in the basil (not quite a tablespoon), sprinkled the top with shredded sharp cheddar as another reviewer suggested, turned off the stove, and covered the skillet with a lid just long enough for the cheddar to melt.  My husband really liked it and so did I.  Thanks for the recipe!

Deliciousness. These had an Italian flavor. Moist fluffy curds, sweet herby basil, and rich cheesy goodness. How can you not love this? I'm not even a fan of scrambled eggs as they are too plain, too eggy, and just weird unless I cover them with Tabasco so it was surprising to me that I loved these and heartily ate every single morsel on my plate. I NEVER do that with eggs. It was hard for me to tell when the eggs were set though as the cheese melted and it was wet looking so I may have overcooked mine but oh my goodness, these were fantastic!!! Thanks so much for the wonderful egg recipe.

This was way off, texturally, and very bland to boot. It came out this bland, soggy, tasteless mess. It seemed much more like it should have been baked, and cheddar or feta would have been better choices for the cheese.

WOW!!! Where has this recipe been all my life?!?! The sour cream gives the eggs a completely different texture which is unbelievably creamy. I added some chopped peppers and onions which nicely complemented the basil. This will now be the only way I make scrambled eggs! Thank you!!!

Cut this recipe in half for a single serving just this morning, and loved it.  No mozzarella on hand so subbed in old cheddar.  Very tasty.  This recipe has definitely changed my approach to scrambled eggs -- love the sour cream addition.

Fixed this for breakfast today.  It's the only way I will eat scrambled eggs from now on.  I used a dry Italian blend of herbs.  About 1/8 of a teaspoon.  Mexican 4 cheese blend and added a little onion powder.  I used very little salt as I am afraid of over salting things.  I don't think it needs salt at all.  I'm a salt lover, but I'm trying to be a good girl and cut back on it as much as possible.  This is a winner.  Thank you for this awesome recipe.

Loved this!  I used Egg Beaters to save on the calories and cholesterol.  Also used just a bit of dried basil as I didn't have fresh....YUM!

It didn't come out as it sounded in the review. My kids asked if it was powdered eggs!!! I'll try it again or maybe find another recipe.

A nice, simple twist of plain scrambled eggs.  These were very creamy, as are any eggs you cook on low and stir constantly.

This was great. I measured everything to a tee (which I never do), and it was perfect as written. Can't wait to make it again with some different herbs and maybe some added veggies.

These are great!  Easy, quick and healthy.  Don't be shy with the pepper.  I found that it really does add to the overall flavor of the dish.

I loved this version of scambled eggs, especially since I love using fresh herbs over the summer, they were light and fluffy and so flavorful.  I also make this recipe using fresh parsley, and a mixture of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese both are great!

Very good.  Received recipe this morning and decided to make for brunch.  I did not have sour cream, but I substituted plain yogurt, which worked except it made the eggs 'weep' a bit on the plate.  Cut fresh basil from my garden and fixed dish in no time.  My husband even liked it and he seldom will eat eggs not fried or simply scrambled.

I added tomatoes which was a mistake.  Not only did it get really watery, but it made the eggs kind of curdle.  I tasted great, but didn't look so pretty.

made this on a whim this morning. followed recipe exactly, except substituted 1/2 tbsp dried minced basil leaves instead of fresh. I thought it was okay, nothing I'd make for company. The mozzarella flavor came through nicely. My husband thought the basil was heavy. He would try it again with less basil.

I was very disappointed in this dish.  Thought it would make a fun breakfast for dinner, but the flavors just didn't come together.  I think maybe too much basil?  I took it from my plant, so it was very fresh.

This egg recipe was only okay.  I was not very awake when making this and almost forgot the cheese.  I added shredded Italian blend cheese to the pan when the eggs were mostly cooked. I also used 1 tsp of dried basil, since that's what I had on hand.  I doubt I make this again--it was NOT spectacular in my opinion!

My dear Mom came up with this recipe from a cooking class over 40 years ago - only difference was using grated cheddar instead of mozzarella.  Love the addition of the basil. Thanks for bringing me back to my youth and my Mom's great cooking.

yumm this was really good, made the eggs nice and fluffy, i didnt think 4 would be enough (because it usually doesn't make much) but this recipe made a perfect amount! I added garlic salt instead of using regular salt. Excellent!

Nice change of pace for eggs, although I found the basil to be overpowering.  I'd certainly make them again with less basil.  Love the cheese and sour cream mixed right in!

I have made eggs this way for years and sometimes substitute 
tarragon for the basil.  Always creamy and yummy.

I used a tsp of dried basil.  Flavor was good, but the texture was strange.  My eggs were not creamy, but almost crumbly and watery, if that makes sense.  I really do want to make this again and see what I can do to perfect it.

I made these like the receipe said but they turned out watery. I used tillamook regular sour cream.  I will use cream cheese next time as that makes them light and fluffy.

These eggs were a nice change to our Sunday morning breakfast.  I used cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella because it was all I had.  I also increased the butter just a little and included a dash of onion and garlic powder.  So good!!!

This was a great recipe for scrambled eggs! I used milk instead of sour cream, and I sliced some country style skinless pork sausages and added them when the eggs were partially firmed. I also chopped up some fresh chives from my garden and added them with the basil, which was also fresh. At the end I sprinkled more mozzarella on top of the eggs once the were cooked and let it melt. I served it with green grapes, toast, and yellow cherry tomatoes. My whole family LOVED it and said that I should make it all the time.

I really enjoyed this version of scrambled eggs (as someone else said, how did I eat plain scrambled eggs all this time?!).
What's even better is that my fiance who doesn't care for scrambled eggs really liked it.  This is definitely a keeper for the recipe box! :)

Yummy!  Something new and different for breakfast, but doesn't take any longer than regular scrambled eggs.  Used cheddar cheese because that's what I had.  Can't wait to try again and maybe add some Red Bell Peppers.

Used what I had in my fridge/pantry:  plain yogurt, instead of sour cream; med. cheddar, instead of mozzarella; dried Tuscany blend spices for the basil. Threw in chopped fresh tomato for a complete meal. A very versatile foundation for a special treatment of scrambled eggs.

These were the lightest and fluffiest scrambled eggs I have ever made.  I will add more spices next time for our personal taste, but with the sour cream and cheese these were incredibly light.  My compliments to you for the idea.

The key here is to stir the eggs the whole time.  I'm not fond of cheddar in my eggs so I may try something else next time.  Without basil they were just yummy scrambled eggs.

Very creamy consistency to the eggs; I made with cheddar cheese as that's all i had on hand. Think I'd add more veggies to this to make it extra special; perhaps some chopped onion, chopped seeded tomato, even some chopped bacon.

This is a great way to have eggs!  Due to dietary restrictions, I had to substitute Egg Beaters for the real eggs, and olive oil for the butter.  Egg Beaters get boring after a while, and the sour cream, mozzarella and fresh basil gave this dish a very new and wonderful flavor.  Scrambled eggs make a stuck up mess on my cast iron griddle, so after spraying the griddle with non stick spray, I drizzled the oil and made sure to spread the egg/sour cream mixture over the entire surface of the griddle.  I did not stir them up. When the eggs were almost set, I sprinkled on the mozzarella cheese and minced basil and folded them in half for a very pretty and tasty omelette.  I will use this several times a week, as I have discovered a new and delicious way to have my formerly boring Egg Beaters.  Thank you for the recipe.

This recipe is great. I have a beautiful basil plant growing in my herb garden and look for different ways to use it. The only thing I changed was I used butter cooking spray, low fat sour cream and part skim cheese to lower the calorie count.  I give this recipe an A+.

So much better than we thought it would be.  We had a lot of basil we needed to use, so we thought we would try it.  We added some cherry tomatoes from our garden and the whole thing was so delicious and super quick and easy to make, I can't wait to make it again!  Thank you for posting the recipe!

Very good for a quick, light supper or a fancier scrambled egg brunch.  Since I was in a hurry and wanted some garlic, I added garlic salt instead of fresh garlic - but I did take the opportunity to use some fresh basil from just outside my door!  Will definitely make again.

Try using ricotta cheese in your scrambled eggs. Whole milk of course. It makes them light and fluffy. They almost puff up as your cooking them.

As someone very new to the cooking world, these were extremely simply to make and came out perfect on my first try. Might add some cheddar on top next time because my girlfriend is a cheese fanatic. Great recipe!

I used prepared pesto rather than fresh basil. I loved the result but I did find the texture a bit odd. Creamy non-the-less!

I'm not a huge scrambled egg fan; I usually have to douse them in hot sauce or salsa.  This is the first recipe for them I've found that I don't have to add anything to... delicious!

I didn't have any basil on hand, so I substituted Italian seasoning. It turned out to be an okay recipe with some degree of flavor. I'm not sure if I would make it again, but would make modifications if I do.

I made it for a breakfast group that i cook for. They enjoyed it and felt they were having a gourmet breakfast. I felt it was a bit bland, needed some punch. I will substitute parmesan cheese for some of the mozzarella. Probably will add garlic and maybe some italian seasonings.

Lovely, tasty and easy as pie to make! I did not have any mozzarella around so I used a tbsp or two on grated locatelli Romano cheese I did have. Used 2% Greek yogurt instead of sour cream for the extra protein and added the basil towards the end of cooking, as recommended. Next time, will use the mozzarella because it will add a bit of sweetness and gooey texture. Thanks for the recipe!!

Oh wow, what a great spin on eggs.  The flavor of the eggs is incredible, a whole new experience. Couple notes: Butter? Nah, no one cooks in butter. Cook them in some flavor,  local smoked bacon grease!!!!!! Add some garlic with fresh parmesan, unreal!

Eggs-cellent! Something different and a nice change from standard scrambled eggs. I used parmesan in place of the mozzarella. I can see adding some chopped tomatoes to this, as well, and a little garlic powder wouldn't hurt. Will make again!

Too, different from my usual scrambled eggs, beatin with milk.  I cook slowly in BACON drippings for flavor and season with S & P and Poultry Seasoning.  Sometimes add scallion greens and/or cheese, but mostly plain.

wanted a recipe for a breakfast group that would need to stay warm and not dried out and this worked great. The freshly grated cheese - I used gouda - and the room temp sour cream (added to warm large saute pan with heat off) kept this dish warm and creamy. Used my large cast iron because cheese would stick otherwise and to retain heat. Used my garden basil more as a garnish but also my garden cilantro would be a nice taste

I've made these 4 times and the sour cream does  add a nice richness to the eggs. I like to add a little cheddar cheese or American cheese sometimes too!

I often use creme fraiche or a click of spread cream cheese like Philadelphia or Creme Bonjour in my scrambled eggs. It makes beautiful colour on the food. 
Just noticed that in most of the pictures the food was way overcooked. Scrambled eggs is not supposed to be dry but creamy and fluffy. Take the pan off the heat before the food is done!

I love eggs in all forms.  This recipe is great because sour cream makes it easier to achieve the right consistency I love ( under done).
Last week, I ate this kind of egg every morning. 
 It is great with parsley and a dust of paprika on the top.

Not awful but it's hard to mess up scrambled eggs. It wasn't "creamy" so I'd rather just stick to butter, milk and eggs. I didn't even bother with the basil

I did a few different things in this recipe, but I believe I got an excellent result nonetheless.  Instead of sour cream, I used plain nonfat yogurt, and while mozzarella is a good cheese, I find it rather bland, so I used feta instead.  I also used cilantro instead of basil.  In the oven, I par cooked some hash browns with bits of onion, red pepper, and minced garlic.  I then added the egg and yogurt mixture and cooked that the rest of the way.  Upon removing from the oven, I sprinkled the feta all around, and then topped with cilantro.

Fagé Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and some goat cheese, what was at hand ..Excellent! Definitely will remake. I was afraid the continued stirring would lead to rubbery eggs but low and slow works!

SO.......these were probably the best eggs I've ever eaten.  I would have never thought adding sour cream to eggs would transform them like this .  The texture and the taste was amazing.  I added a few more spices at the beginning, ie, garlic powder, pepper, onion powder, minced onion, and all purpose greek seasoning.  The mozzarella cheese was very subtle...I might add a stronger cheese next time.  Great recipe!!!

I sub in plain greek yogurt for sour cream as a healthier option. I'm very curious what the substitution would taste like in eggs. It's terrific with Mexican food, that's for sure.

Did not care for the Basil .I wasn't sure how much to use because I used dried Basil. Used One teaspoon. I think it would have been much better with fresh. I also used cheddar and it was yummy.

Not a mozarella fan so I used shredded pepper jack and (real) bacon bits.  Fabulous!  Anyone late for breakfast misses out, because it's gone in a flash.

The sour cream made these eggs very creamy. I did not measure anything, just threw it in.  I also added some homegrown fresh garlic chives and red pepper flakes. Will try different herbs and cheeses next time.

Made this for my family and they LOVED it! I added in some onions and garlic and wrapped them up in a wheat tortilla. Kids gobbled 'em up!

I used egg whites and followed the recipe portions exactly.  I used dried basil since I don't  keep fresh around.  This came out great!  A nice change of pace to my usual scrambled eggs.  Great flavor combination.  I will definitely make again!

Good!  I prefer grated cheddar tho.  Chickiep and others who find their dish is ''watery''...you have overcooked them.  Use a lower heat and gently bring them together with a spatula.  They will cook more if left sitting on the plate so serve immediately when just creamy and soft.  This is advice from a Grannie with years of experience.

I love this recipe!  The day I made it I didn't have any basil so I just added the cheese and the sour cream.  I will never make my eggs again with milk.  The sour cream makes the eggs so light.  Excellent!

This is outstanding!  It is wonderful as written.  Eggs are among my  favorite things!  Next time, I might try using olive oil in place of the butter... I always use olive oil when making fried or scrambled eggs...  As I said, I tried the recipe as written - and it was delicious... But - olive oil seems that it would also be good with this recipe.  Thank you, very much for  a simple, yet delicious, version of scrambled eggs.

I love eggs just about anyway you fix them and this was excellent. I seldom make "plain" scrambled eggs so the cheese and herbs were nothing new but the sour cream was a new addition for me and I'll definitely be using it again.

I made this recipe as written except for one tweak. I added the sour cream close to the end of the cooking cycle as several other reviewers recommended. I thought the recipe came out pretty good and had a lot of flavor.

this recipe is on the right track, but the eggs should be cooked at at a  medium low heat  and the sour cream should be added near the end of the cooking time, just before plating. otherwise, there is a good chance the eggs will be overdone. try this with chives!

Because I am a single person, I halved the recipe.   The eggs vere delicious but not creamy.  I slowly sauted onion and garlic prior to adding the eggs and pepper jack cheese with the sour cream and basil, salt and pepper.   My analysis of  the eggs not being creamy are possibly (as others have mentioned) the sour cream not being added at the end or because I scrambled the eggs too long.  At any rate I'll make this recipe again and add the sour cream at the end and maybe not cook the eggs as long.

This was a nice, and easy, change to our usual scrambled eggs.  We added pepper jack cheese as suggested, and it was just the right amount of morning pick me up. I think this would be a great base recipe for omelets or even quiche. Thanks for a recipe that will keep on giving!

Cooked eggs as directed, but used dried basil still tasty. Added a few squares of American cheese on top and tossed with green chiles, jalapeños and black olives. Next time I will substitute the mozzarella for pepper jack.

I have always eaten my scrambled eggs with a scoop of cream cheese-- YUMMY! 

But now I can add this awesome recipe to my weekend menu!

I use Daisy Light Sour cream. I've used provolone, sharp cheddar, gouda, swiss, jalapeno monterey jack (pepper jack), (all of the cheeses being the light version too) and they all came out great! 
Thumbs up Timbertiger!

Delicious!  I made this receipe for breakfast today ~ what a perfect way to use some of my fresh basil.  I'm not usually an egg eater and will only eat scrambled eggs.  This receipe was a keeper ~ I'm hooked on it!

Was OK - nothing special - continue to make as I usually do, just adding a little milk to my beaten eggs!
