Great recipe!  Instead of baking this, I heat up wok in high heat, sauteed ginger, garlic, chili pepper and browned the fish on both sides (whole fish cutted in half) then toss in the rest of the ingredients, covered, cooked on medium heat until done.  Did not add any water, but actually thickened sauce with a little cornstarch (mixed first in cold water), had to add a little more sugar since it was a little salty for my taste (fish sauce).  overall it tasted great!  Hubby loved it.  served over rice.

This is awesome!  I used Mahi fillets instead of a whole fish, so I couldn't exactly stuff the fillets with the basil.  Instead, I seared the fish in the peanut oil.  Covered it with a little of the sauce that is made on Step 4 of this recipe and some basil leaves, and then baked it for about 20mins in a 375 degree oven (cooking time would vary depending on your fillet size or fish choice).  Served it along with the leftover sauce over Jasmine rice and Broccoli!  LOVED IT!  GREAT SAUCE! Thank you for the recipe!

This is the absolute best! Great flavor, easy and quick. I didn't have any fish sauce so I had to substitute my favorite stir fry sauce but it was still good. This one I raved about to everyone and I NEVER rave about my cooking. I think this sauce would be good with chicken also. I'm going to make up a big batch to freeze and have on hand.

Great blend of flavors. I had to use dried basil instead of fresh, and used cherry tomatoes cut in half. Used olive oil instead of peanut oil (not available here). Didn't have any brown sugar, used a tablespoon of prepared honey mustard instead.

This was very good!  I did not use a whole fish, just fillets so I skipped the searing and put it straight in the oven.  Used orange bells instead of yellow, and that tomato topping is delicious!  Thanks!

I used Harissa as a substitute for the chili in this recipe - it was fabulous! Otherwise, I did not stray from the recipe. I will add this to my repertoire!

This was a wonderful recipe and I'd definitely make it again. Do what the other reviewers say and don't leave out the brown sugar. The ginger and wine vinegar make it. I didn't brown it first and it crisped right up in the oven.

One of the best dishes I've ever made! I 'made-do' with the ingredients I had on hand, and it ended up perfect!

I didn't have any red chilies, I used 1/2 fresh jalapeno diced, 1/2 fresh habanero diced. Instead of bell pepper/tomatoes, I cooked sliced japanese eggplant along with the ginger/cloves. Oh, for fish sauce I had only oyster sauce on hand. Lol, and for the snapper I used a pound of really fresh filets.

I sort of layered the basil (thai basil) into the layers of filets, and lightly coated with the oyster sauce - I'll likely add a little water next time to be able to brush it on and distribute a bit better.

Okay, didn't have peanut oil either, so used the last bit of the sesame oil I had (I think it adds a bit more flavor).

All in all, very similar but done without having to go shop for ingredients. Thank you to Chili Spice for the recipe! Very much enjoyed and have to play with it even more next time :)
