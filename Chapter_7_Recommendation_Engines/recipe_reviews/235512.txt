I have a similar recipe titled, "Pumpkin Crunch Souffle," that differs only in a large can of pumpkin puree instead of sweet potatoes.  It's outstanding!  My recipe goes into the microwave uncovered for 13-15 minutes.  If you use pumpkin instead of the potatoes, be sure to let it cool off a little while because it will "weep" if it's still too hot.

This is great as a side dish or dessert and is just like pumpkin pie but without the crust.  You don't even notice the spices are missing!  Thanks for posting, jaqpink. I live in mortal fear of losing my recipe!

I've made this recipe for years and the family can't imagine Thanksgiving without it.  But many years ago I felt it was more like a dessert then a side dish, so I adjusted the amount of white sugar and now use between 1/4 to 1/3 cup.  Much better!
