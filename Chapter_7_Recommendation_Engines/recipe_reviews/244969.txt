So yummy! And guilt free..and my 2 and 4 year old give it 2 thumbs up. I didn't have frozen berries, but frozen mangoes tasted awesome. Doesn't make enough though! Next time I would triple the recipe.

Wow, it is just like pudding, except for the berry seeds. I put in half as much milk, but maybe the rice milk I'm using is watery... I usually add extra cocoa powder or blueberries, depending on how healthy I want it to taste. Dessert for breakfast, yay!

Made double recipe. #yum!
Used honey instead of agave, cashew milk instead of soy milk (7 oz instead of 8 oz to compensate because I only had one medium banana).
Added 1 tsp. ea. almond and butternut extract, 1/2 c. blueberries, and extra avocado.  And, although it would be better with the right amount, it was still great!
I'm out but it'd be really good to add flax seed or black chia seed, too!

This was the creamiest smoothie ever! I didn't have agave nectar, so I substituted for it with maple syrup. In lieu of mixed berries, I used frozen blueberries. I also switched out coconut milk with regular milk. I doubled the recipe and used the extra to makes popsicles for my son. Thanks for sharing!

Have made it several times. Found the berries direct the flavor. I've only used blueberries so far. It has a blueberry taste. Want to try with strawberries or raspberries- would probably taste like dessert then! Thanks for the recipe.

It didn't really taste like chocolate pudding to me - too strong a banana flavor to really pull that off, and the berry seeds gave it away too. But it's definitely chocolatey and quite tasty. I might try increasing the avocado next time, and trying berries like blueberries and strawberries instead of raspberries and blackberries, to avoid the largest seeds. Overall, delicious and guilt-free, even if it didn't make me think I was having pudding.

This was just like chocolate pudding and is chock full of good stuff. Mine was even as thick as pudding so I added an extra 1/2 cup of milk (I used almond milk). As far as taste, it was just ok. Can't beat the nutrients though. Thank you for the recipe.
