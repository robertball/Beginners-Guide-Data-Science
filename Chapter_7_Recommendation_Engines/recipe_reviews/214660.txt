I marinated the pineapple in the fridge covered with 1/4 cup rum, 3 T brown sugar and 1/4  cup water for 2 hours, before grilling.   The addition of the mascarpone cheese was elegant, but I added 2 extra T of honey to sweeten, along with 1 t. light rum to add more flavor.  The nuts didn't fit with the taste of the sweetness of the fruit.

For those of you who are looking for a dairy-free version, simple marinate the pineapple (I used canned) in the honey and lemon juice for half an hour and then grill. Yum!

A very nice dessert, but I'm surprised that no one mentioned that only ONE container of mascarpone cheese is needed. It is more than enough for 4 plates. We all enjoyed!

This was just o.k.  It's expensive to make and for the price, I want outstanding.  Fortunately, I had most of the ingredients on hand.  I cut the mascarpone cream in half because 16oz for 8 slices of pineapple seemed like a lot!  It was a good decision.  After placing a heaping spoonful on the pineapple, I still had half of it left over.

I haven't grilled the pineapple yet, but I have eaten the cheese on toasted pound cake. Could not find hazelnuts so I used toasted sliced almonds. Really light dessert. I am going to try grilling the pineapple this week and update my review. Definetly make again

Had this at a friends house but she opted to top the pineapple with Nutella and plain mascapone cheese. It is absolutely the best dessert ever!!!! Have made it at home many times since.

I fell in love with this recipe the moment I saw it. I just made it for Father's Day and it was definitely a hit among the whole family. Perfect summer dessert that is refreshing and lower in calorie.

I haven't made this YET as I have just read it.  I am running out to the store to buy the pineapples and the mascarpone cheese as soon as I finish writing this.  I have not written a review  before but I will as soon as I finish eating this...

This was a special side dish for our dinner! I made it with agave syrup instead of honey.

Actually, I microwaved the pineapple because I had so much food at the BBQ that we never got to the pineapple. Anyway, probably because I microwaved it, each piece was so juicy that is filled my mouth with juice and it was hard to not spill it out. Lol. I also thought the mascarpone/lemon mix should have been sweeter.

Made Homemade Mascarpone Cheese off AR. I only had 1 pineapple so I halved the recipe to make 4 thick slices of pineapple. Even using 1 cup of mascarpone cheese, I had a lot of leftover. I'll reduce the mascarpone cheese to 1/2 cup and adjust lemon zest, lemon juice, and honey accordingly. Kidlets loved it! With making my own mascarpone cheese, it was a lot cheaper than buying store bought .
