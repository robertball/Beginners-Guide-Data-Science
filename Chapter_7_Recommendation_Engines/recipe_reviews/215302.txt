Very similair to a chipotle chicken I have been making for several years. If you really like to cook with chipotles, here's a hint.  Puree a can or two of chipotles in adobo. Put in a jar, keep refrigerated & then you can call it "chipotle paste". I add a spoonful to broth when making soups. Also, use this same recipe and instead of chipotles use a basil pesto sauce. Excellent over linguine or fettucine.

This is a nice, flavorful, and easy crock pot recipe.  I made this as is but put my chicken breast in frozen.  It came out great :) I cooked this on low and it was done in my slow cooker after only 4 hours.  The chicken was moist and the sauce is nice and creamy with a smoky kick.  I served this over rice with a side of broccoli.  I will be making this again.

Ok, so I only made 3 changes to this recipe (that is a MAJOR accomplishment for me). The first being that I didn't use the butter (I didn't think it was necessary with the richness of the other ingredients), added a can of mushrooms and I added slivered onions for the last 40 minutes of cooking. I increased the broth to 3/4 cup to make up for the loss in liquid. I also solved the issue some people had with the "chunky" sauce without having to pre-heat all the sauce ingredients. I heated my broth in the microwave for about a minute. I then added the cream cheese chunks and cooked at 20 second intervals until it softened somewhat. I then put the broth/cream cheese, soup and peppers in the blender and hit pulse until it was blended and creamy. The sauce went into the crockpot with the frozen chicken breasts and a small can of sliced mushrooms (drained) and was done about 40 minutes later. We served it over rice and it was a hit! Thanks for the recipe :) I know this recipe would have been just as great as written but we're trying to cook a little healthier.

This is a nice recipe, but it will need some work. Next time, I'll warm up the cream soup, broth, adobo sauce and butter in a saucepan on medium heat, then whisk in the cream cheese until it's thoroughly blended. Then I'll put the remaining ingredients in the slow cooker and pour the sauce over it all. Something is still off, though. Maybe it needs something strong but light to balance the heaviness of the smoke and the richness of the cream cheese; I'm thinking fresh ground coriander seed. Definitely needs chopped cilantro and onions at the table to perk it up.

Love it ... tasty and moist.  I did alter the recipe by using what I had on hand.  Substituted cream of chicken with cream of mushroom and the chipolte pepper with jarred roasted red peppers.  Mild smokey flavor not spicy, if you don't like hot spice try it with the roasted red peppers.  Delish!

I hardly ever give a recipe 5 stars, but this is one of the exceptions. My family thought it was a bit spicy, but I loved it, so the heck with them...  :)

This was fabulous. I didn't want to wait til the next day to make it in the slow cooker, so I cut up the chicken and pan seared it. Then followed the directions. I let it cook in the sauce for about 20 minutes and served it over rice. This was definitely restaurant quality, thank you for sharing!

EXCELLENT! Only made minor changes: added 1 can of roasted diced tomatoes, and ommited the chicken stock due to the extra liquid in canned tomatoes. Added sauteed thinly sliced onions, red pepper, green pepper, and poblano peppers to last 45 minutes of cooking. Served over cilantro rice completed the "Mexican" flavors of this dish.

Absolutely excellent!  The chicken was extremely moist and flavorful, the sauce was perfectly creamy with a definite kick.  I made it exactly as it was written and my VERY picky boyfriend piped up right away saying to put this recipe in the "keep" pile.  Will definitely make it again.

I loved this recipe. The only changes I made was to use fat free soup and sour cream to cut the calories, and guilt I feel when going for seconds.

This is absolutely AWESOME with so much flavor and spice.  I served this with steamed jasmine rice and it paired perfectly.  Others mentioned about the cream cheese being chunky thoughout the sauce, but there is a very simple fix for that.  I softened the cream cheese in the microwave, stirred, then added the soup, peppers, broth, and pepper sauce right into the cream cheese mix.  I stirred until it was all mixed and smooth and poured over my chicken.  No cream cheese lumps at all and it turned out perfect!  Thank you so much for an amazing recipe.  This one is added to my favorites for sure!!

This recipe is really good and easy to prepare. I pounded the chicken thin and put some of the adobe, cream cheese, some red pepper and onions inside the chicken and then rolled it up and placed in crock pot.
This is a keeper!
Thank you.

I thought this was super easy to prepare and very tasty.  I agree with another reviewer - we had little bits of cream cheese floating in our sauce.  It didn't bother me in the least, but it really turned hubby off.  I believe that's the only reason he says he didn't like it.

I made this exactly as written. The sauce was delicious - I had the lumping problem as well, but solved it easily by removing the chicken at the end of cooking and whisking the sauce in the crock pot.

6 hours on low is way too long for this recipe. I left the chicken breasts whole and they were still dried out.

Made this last night and it was awesome! I didn't have Cream of Chicken soup, so I used cream of celery. Otherwise, I made no changes. As suggested by others, I checked the chicken after 4 hours and it was "fall-apart" tender and juicy. Also, as suggested, I heated the sauce on the stove in order to incorporate the cream cheese and the sauce was velvety smooth. I think the sauce could be made stove-top and used by itself as an adjunct to other dishes as well. I will definitely make this again.

Sooooo delicious! I made my own cream of chicken from this site using flour chicken broth and milk and some spices. Make your own if you can it was much better than canned. Also I openly used one big pepper bc I'm a wimp but I used all of the sauce in the jar and it was perfect. Still spicy but not too spicy. I also seasoned the chicken with fajita seasoning and cooked on the stove top then removed the chicken and made the sauce and threw the chicken back in. Also sauteed mushrooms and threw those in there. This is a must try!

Simple creamy spicy comfort food. I did read about the problem many had with the cream cheese separation. I was using my own homemade chicken broth and had to defrost it anyway in the microwave, so I added the cream cheese into it and whisked it until nice and creamy, then poured it into the crock over the chicken. I did use 1/3 less fat cream cheese and added in a whole chopped onion for more flavor. I missed the butter part, but I don't think it needed it anyway. My breast were still frozen when I started this, took 7 hours to cook on low. We served over white rice. The kids were over and liked it so much they're taking home the leftovers.

I made it as written the first time and it was SOOOO hot, my family couldn't take it. The second time I used a couple of tablespoons of adobo sauce and no minced peppers and it was DELICIOUS.

Delicious!  I cooked this in a skillet because I wanted to make it for dinner the night that I found the recipe.  Everyone really liked it.  I only used two peppers and it was plenty hot enough for my family.

I was concerned about doing chicken in a slow cooker, but this was excellent; a little spicy for some, but just right for most.  I did check chicken after 4 hours (1 high and 3 low) and it was coming apart - next time will check after 3.5 hours. Thanks for sharing.

Used the whole can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.  Very spicy but my husband and I loved it.  Added chopped onion.  Will definitely make again.

I've been making this for awhile now and finally got around to writing a review.  I cook this in a large skillet, not a slow cooker.  I chop up the chicken and saute it before adding the other ingredients.  I cook it over low/medium heat for a bit (I've never really timed it) so the chicken is tender. The last time I made it I felt it needed something else so I put in sliced red pepper.  We eat it over rice.  It was awesome and the hubby loved it too!

Fantastic recipe! I'm generally not a fan of recipes that call for canned/condensed soups, but this was really good. 

To make it healthier, I omitted the butter completely, used low-fat cream cheese (neufchatel) and 98% fat free cream of chicken soup. With three chipotles it was very spicy, but we like it that way! 

I softened the cream cheese and blended it with the broth until smooth, then added the soup, chipotles and garlic. I didn't add any salt or pepper - doesn't need it. Cooked on low for four hours and then turned to warm for another 1.5 hours. Perfect!

This was a great, quick, easy and tasty recipe. Followed directions as posted and had excellent results. My chicken was done in 4 hours on low, so make sure you watch your chicken. It might have something to do with the size of your crockpot. I have one of the larger oval ones so my chicken breast laid flat with little to no overlap. If you have a smaller pot, you might have overlap which might call for the longer cooking time. In any case, if your looking for something differnt, try this. I will definately make again.

This turned into two absolutely delicious meals! I added the entire can of chipotle peppers (I love the heat) and served it over pasta.  I used the leftover sauce to make more crockpot chicken the next day, adding an entire diced jalapeno and more chicken stock to make chicken enchiladas. As others have stated, the butter is not necessary at all, nor is all of the cream cheese. Great recipe!

Left out the butter, used garlic salt on the chicken, and added the minced garlic directly into the sauce. Only used 2 minced chipotle peppers, and it was plenty spicy! I think it would've been way too hot if I'd added a third pepper. As written, this recipe makes enough sauce for 5-6 chicken breasts. 
I served over plain white rice mixed with yellow corn - in a word, delicious!

To make it more healthy I used, 98% fat free cream of chicken soup, Fat free cream cheese, and Fat Free chicken broth.  I softened the cream cheese in the microwave. Combined the garlic, soup, broth, cream cheese, peppers and adobo sauce so it was smooth.  Poured the melted butter over the seasoned breast and then added the mixture.  This dish had a lot of flavor without all the fat!  I did not miss it at all... My cook time was only four hours and the chicken was tender falling apart.  Served over rice with sliced avocado slices.  Will make again.

This was good, but not as great as I thought it would be by the smell of the sauce.  I only used 2 peppers, and I am glad I didn't add the third...WOW!  It was spicy!  I will try this again, but maybe in the oven or on the stove.  And maybe with just one pepper!

I love this recipe. It's quick and simple to make. I serve this with egg noodles rather than rice and it's always a big hit. Thanks for this recipe.

The sauce is creamy and full of flavor. I added a few more chipolte pepper & adobe sauce. Spicy is a staple for our dinners. Sauce was really good over the rice. Chicken tender & moist. My husband cut the chicken in bite sized pieces and mixed it all together. He loved it.

This recipe is  a keeper! I, like other reviewers have suggested, heated the cream of chicken, and cream cheese in a small sauce pan. I also sauteed about a cup or two of freshly sliced mushrooms to add and threw in 3 or 4 chopped green onions. When the chicken was done we shredded it a little and served it over brown rice. The next night we made spanish rice and made soft tacos with lettuce, tomatoes and the leftover chipolte. YUMMY!! We've made this twice in a span of a month or two and will be making it again soon.

This recipe was great but a bit spicy - and I live in the southwest and like spicy!  It was too spicy for my kids but my husband and I loved it.  To tone it down a bit next time I guess I would use less peppers or adobe sauce and/or dilute a little with more chicken broth or water.  I have cooked with chipotles before and thought they were very mild and have eaten chipotle salsa - also which is mild so maybe I just stumbled upon some hotter ones.  Still a good recipe to try again!

This was yummy!  My only complaint is that the cream cheese did not melt the way it was supposed to, so it looked gritty.  I removed the chicken from the sauce and used a stick blender to blend the sauce for a creamier/prettier look.  Will definitely make again.

So good. Tried it once with the rice in the crock pot but it was not a successful experiment. The rice came out mushy. Cook the rice separately as directed and it us delicious and the sauce is so tasty.

I made this dish due to its simplicity. The one change I made to the recipe was that I shredded the chicken. Yes, I shredded the chicken into small little strings and served it as a dip. The guys were going crazy over it. The whole dish goes a long way with the shredded chicken.

I made this the other night and thought it was really good.  I made only a few slight changes.  I doubled the sauce and used one can of C/O chicken and one of C/O mushroom, because thats what I had on hand.  I used 4 chipotles because we liked things spicy and it was perfect.  I added a few splashes of worchestire sauce because I felt like the taste of cream cheese was over powering.  Other than that, it was really good.  USed the leftover chicken and sauce in soft tacos a few nights later.

It was great! Skipped on the butter and it was amazing! My boyfriend is very picky but loves chicken and spicy food so it was perfect... I even got him to eat enchiladas made with the leftovers and he couldn't get enough... definitely going to make this again. Thank you

I did everything the same except added 3/4 c chicken broth instead of 1/2 cup based on another reviewer.  I also only added 1 1/2 peppers instead of 3 once I saw all the seeds in it.  Even with cutting the peppers in half, it was pretty spicy!  I shredded the chicken and put it on white rice.  Delicious!

I LOVED this recipe!  It has a kick to it, but isn't too spicy (I'm a wimp).  When I make it again, I will definitely melt the cream cheese beforehand in a pan with the broth (it didn't melt all the way after being in the pot with the rest of the mix for 6 hours.  And next time I will use half the butter.

This recipe was good and the gravy was good over mashed potatoes.  I had never had these type a peppers, but they were good and there was a fair amount of heat to the dish.  I used 8 chicken thighs and there was still plenty of gravy.

Good, flavorful sauce, depending how you spice it.  I used 5 chipotle peppers, cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken, added diced jalapenos; I omitted the butter and used sour cream; I mixed together the sauce first in the crockpot and then placed the chicken inside to insure that the sauce gets mixed well.  I served it over rice but I actually think this would be great with penne or as a spicy pasta sauce.

Wow is this good!...Thick and creamy and full of flavor....I seriously love spicy and did not think this was spicy at all....just had a wonderful smokey flavor from the chipotles. Will add the full can of peppers and adobo next time. ( I am talking about the small can...not a soup can size). Served over rice. Delicious!

Delicious but unfortunately i forgot to put the cream cheese in...i suppose it saved some calories, fat and sodium though. i did not think about making this in advance so i just made it on the stovetop. i suppose it wasnt really this recipe but it did have all the flavors of the original recipe--i just prepared it in a different manner.

i added rice to the pan and cooked for 10 minutes. Then i added cauliflower and carrot cut up, covered and cooked for 12 minutes more.

The Most Delicious Flavor. I love chipotle.

This was too spicy for any of the kids to enjoy it much. We kinda picked it apart and gave them the inside of the chicken which wasn't as spicy but that kinda defeated the purpose. I thought the flavor was decent but seemed like it could have used a little more...something.

Not happy with this at all.  Too much sodium left us very thirsty, and I had used reduced sodium broth.  The cream cheese was not integrated well into the sauce, I would add it in the last hour already softened.  A little more flavor was needed somewhere, just can't put my finger on it.  Tried adding fresh cilantro and still wasn't too good.  Really hoped this was going to turn out good since I love the smokey flavor of chipotles.

Delicious!  I eliminated the butter completely and used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it was perfect.  Seasoned the chicken with sazon prior to the garlic.  Very flavorful!

I made this recipe using the exact ingredients. However I ended up shredding the chicken and using the mixture as a filling for corn tortilla quesadillas which I grilled on my George Foreman grill. I added some chopped tomatoes with green chilis and white onion. I'm sure there are other things you could add. They were so delicious!! Perfect party finger food too. I would definitely make this recipe again.

My husband really liked this but it was WAY too hot for me.  I couldn't taste anything because I couldn't get past the heat.  But - I will try it again and dial down the chipotle a little because I think I would probably like it then!

I followed the recipe just as it was and it tasted amazing. The only change I had to make was mixing some corn starch with water and throwing it in with the whisked sauce, as it was  far too watery. My Partner and roommates said this was a keeper, even though one dislikes any kind of spice.

I replaced the chipotles with green chiles because that's all my grocery store had, combined the sauce ingredients before adding to the cooker, cut the chicken breasts into thick strips, and only cooked it for 4 hours. It turned out great! Will make again!

I recently took this dish to a potluck and it received many compliments.  It is very flavorful and had the right hint of spice from the chipotle peppers, perfect served on top of rice.  My chicken was a little tough though and I probably cooked it a bit too long.

This is one of my all-time favorite recipes. I don't add the chicken broth and instead add about 1 tablespoon of chicken soup base (from Sam's Club). After it has cooked I shred the chicken and serve over rice. I also run the can of chipotle peppers through the food processor, package in 3-4 small containers and freeze so it is ready to go whenever I need it.

We love spicy food but this was a little more than we cared for.  It seemed very hot but missing some flavor.  I think less pepper and more garlic would work better for us.  I'm sorry, I'm glad I tried it but I'm not sure I would make it again.

This was pretty good. As always, I never rate a recipe unless I make it EXACTLY as the recipe is written. The taste was really good and I'll certainly make it again but next time I'll soften the cream cheese and cream the chipotles and adobo sauce in it, then put it in the crock pot. I ended up with little hunks of cream cheese in my sauce that didn't melt even though I cubed it relatively small.

I forgot the butter part and i don't think it mattered.  Heck--maybe that cut down on the calories a smidge.  Easy to make, nice and spicy and tasted great with some brown rice.

This was delicious! But! I didn't chop the peppers. I seeded them but left them otherwise intact and it gave me the perfect amount of flavor and spice. Next time I would make the sauce in a separate bowl and then pour it over the chicken. The cream cheese didn't mix in very well when left to its own devices.

One of our favorites - even my kids love it!! The only thing I do differently, which solves the lumpy cream cheese issue, is use the Philly Cooking Creme, Santa Fe blend. Adds great flavor and solves the lumps!!!

This was awesome!  But very spicy with 3 chipotles!  Kids couldn't eat it, but the hubby and I LOVED IT!  I tried to tone it down by adding the rest of the greek yogurt I had in the fridge and sour cream.  I also added another can of cream of chicken soup, but to no avail....kids were a no go!  But it was delicious!  And I threw a whole bag of roasted corn in from trader joes!  YUM!

I left out the butter as I felt it was not needed.  I only used 1 tablespoon of the adobe sauce and it had a nice spice but not too hot. I did not put in the minced chipotle peppers at all.  

I removed the chicken and whisked the sauce to a smooth consistency.  My husband just loved it.  I spooned the sauce over oven roasted potatoes.

Sauce was delicious.  I followed the directions exactly.  The chicken itself was blah but very tender.  I think this would be better with thighs.

Eh. Although a nice spice, it felt like it was missing something (onion? mushrooms?). We put over rice. Not sure we'll make again.

WOW really hot!..would only use maybe 1 pepper.  I put this over egg noodles and put in mixed frozen veggies at the very end while the noodles were cooking.  It looked good with the all the colors of the veggies.  I also used fat free cream cheese and it was fine.  I even partially melted all the wet ingredients on the stove and some of the cream cheese still did not melt all the way.  Didn't bother with the butter, it doesn't need it.

Everyone really enjoyed this recipe.  It was easy to prepare.  I followed some reviewers advice and softened the cream cheese in the microwave.  Then I put the chiles in my Magic Bullet and processed and then added the cream cheese, cream of chicken soup, chicken broth and sliced garlic cloves and processed all till smooth.

This is great just how it is, just sometimes I add a little less peppers. Depends on how hot I feel at the time. We crave this and you have made a fan of Chipotle Peppers out of me. Flavor is awesome 5 stars. Simple to make 5 1/2 stars.

This is delicious! I'll usually double the recipe (everything except the cream cheese) and use the leftovers to make enchiladas the next day. We also like things hot, so I add the whole can of peppers and adobo sauce. If you want a really smooth sauce, blend melt the cream cheese in a pan with the broth and cream of chicken soup and blend it with a hand blender. Quick, easy, delicious!!

This dish was wonderful and quite addicting. The next time I make it I will definitely be reducing the amount of chipotle as a few in my family couldn't handle the spice.

Very good!  This does have quite a kick so if your heat sensitive cut back on the chili's.  For us it was perfect though ;)  Served over rice with all that delicious sauce!

Super yummy and very flavorful!  I served this over rice for dinner, but I had extra leftover sauce that I put over grits the next morning for breakfast... OMG... Yumm-o!  Next time I think I will serve over grits at dinner.

The butter isn't neccessary.  I used a little bit of olive oil instead of butter.  I also used healthy request cream of chicken and nonfat cream cheese.  Next time, I would use normal cream cheese... The fat free didn't melt very well.  Overall, SO YUMMY!

This was a big hit in my house!  I followed the ingredients exactly, but did adjust the cooking method. I melted the butter in a saucepan, then added the soup and cream cheese and cooked it on low to melt the cream cheese, then added the other ingredients and poured it over the chicken in the crock pot. It was very good.  Thanks for sharing such a delicious and easy recipe.

My Family loved this recipe.  My husband was especially fond of it.  It does have a kick but not burning bad.  Very tasty.  I mixed some cornstarch in with some water at the end to make a thicker sauce. I also put my chicken in on the frozen side.  It came out nice and moist and tasty. Also, I had never used Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.  In case you don't know because I didn't  it comes in a can.  I will be making this again and again.  Thanks, tnahinu for a great recipe.

This is a fantastic dish. I slow-cooked frozen chicken breasts on high for 2 hours, low for 2 hours, and it turned out amazing. I didn't have cream of chicken, but substituted jarred Alfredo sauce for the cream base. The chipotle flavor with the cream is wonderful! I also added a couple tablespoons of mild green chiles and served with cauliflower 'potatoes' from this site for a nice low-carb comfort food meal. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Was a great recipe and turned out very tasty! I used a smoked chipolte seasoning from New Mexico I had on hand because I felt the peppers would have been too much for my family's preference of chipolte peppers, since I am the only one who loves them. Using just a tsp of the seasoning gave it the taste I love and did not turn my family off from the strength of the peppers in this recipe. It was delicious with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies.

Outstanding!  I did cut back on the amount of chilies as they quite large.  The sauce turned into a nice gravy served over mashed potatoes.  Husband loved it.

I was afraid the chicken wouldn't be very tasty since it isn't browned first, but I was so wrong.  It was REALLY tender and the cream sauce was WONDERFUL.  I served it with Spanish rice and the sauce made the rice so tasty that my husband, who normally doesn't like rice, went back for seconds just to have more sauce.

I loved the idea of this and had all the ingredients to use but needed to make it more figure friendly...  I skipped the butter entirely and instead of adding cream cheese I topped with a little sour cream.  That helped cool it off a bit because it has a good kick.  I ended up shredding the chicken and serving it and the sauce over rice.  Easy and satisfying week night meal.  Thanks for sharing.

I usually do not enjoy spicy foods, but this was a fabulous recipe!  The chicken was so moist and flavorful.  I also put my chicken in frozen and cooked on high for about 4.5 hours.  YUM!

I made this as written, but I heated and blended all of the cream ingredients ahead of time to minimize cream cheese chunks. It was a little too spicy, for us, as written. The taste of the sauce is great, it's the aftertaste that really rocks your world. So, with rice it's a little bit too spicy and I think that the next time that I make it that I will go a little lighter on the peppers and adobo sauce. I also discovered that it’s a good idea to go lighter on the pepper at the beginning, it seems that simmering in the crock pot 'wakes up' the spiciness of the peppers, so even though it was just right before putting it in the crockpot, afterwards, it was a little bit too much. Also a fun little discovery: although it was too spicy for us with the rice, if you dip corn chips in it, it makes an amazing chip dip!! Perfect for a SuperBowl party or whatever!!!

Wow!  What an amazingly flavorful dish!  My husband and I love spicy food so we added 5 chipotle peppers and a little more of the adobo sauce than what the original recipe called for.  I read the other reviews and made sure to melt the cream cheese and stir with the chicken broth and soup for better continuity.  I would highly recommend you try this dish, you won't be disappointed!

The sauce was a fantastic base, but I found the kick incredibly hot.  I'm rather used to spicy things and so is my husband, but both of us could barely eat it.  I think if I try it again, I would either use green chilies, or drastically reduce the number of peppers.

This was so good!  I followed one reviewers suggestion of blending all the sauce ingredients together and warming them through before pouring over the chicken.  I skipped salt, added a little bit of cumin and decided to more than double the chipotle (I used the whole can, adobo and all).  The sauce is incredible.  Thanks for sharing

OMG!!! Fixed this as written except only used one chipotle pepper. Next time I will use two and add more chicken breasts. I had alot of sauce left over, which I spooned over brown rice. Would be delicious over noodles too. My husband kept saying, "this chicken is sooo good!". It will be added to my Favorites folder...thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!

This chicken was awesome & very easy. I doubled the recipe (8 chicken breasts) so we'd have an easy "warm up" dinner later this week and cooked on high for 4 hours. Turned out perfect and definitly delicious.

I did something wrong as sauce was runny.  Next time less butter and will use all the cream cheese.  I used about 4/5 of the cake, but.... Definitely need to mix /stir sauce to get cream cheese lumps out.

Like some others, we made this chicken in a pan rather than a slow cooker. We pre-cooked the chicken in the pan, then added the sauce and cooked for 20 minutes on low. The chipotles are spicy, and even spicier the next day!

Melted cream cheese with broth and soup as suggested and poured over the chicken. Checked the chicken at 5 hours and it was perfect. Served over rice. Still needed something so I added Serrano chilies and green onion.

I used smoked red peppers cause the guests don't like hot or spicy things. I needed to add salt to my portion (which I never do) and the sauce was waaaay  to watery. If I were to make this again I would have to alter many things in the recipe. I also put the chicken/sauce on chopped cauliflower with chopped green onions and carrots instead of rice---still needed more flavor.

Super easy and delicious! Combine ingredients first on stove before putting in slow cooker to avoid clumps and it's well combined. Goes well with broccoli and white rice.

We all loved it.  I had to use chicken legs since that is what I had in the freezer.  I omitted the butter and then mixed all the sauce ingredients in a bowl, microwaved 45 seconds, stirred 'til smooth and poured over the chicken in the slow cooker.  I added an additional pepper since we like a lot of heat.  Definitely will make again.

I added the cream cheese and 2 cups grated parmesan at the very end of cooking.  This gave it a really nice alfredo taste and it was not lumpy at all. Yum!

I double the recipe and speed it up by cubing the chicken and sauteeing it in butter and garlic before putting it in the crockpot. Also melt the cream cheese in broth before it goes in the crockpot. Then, it's done in 2-3 hours.

A tasty throw together meal for a busy day!
We found this to be a flavorful, tender and moist dish.  As an alternate as suggested, I Halfed the recipe,  and chose a 2T pesto base (eliminating the peppers and sauce), then added 1T chopped sundried tomatoes, 1T sliced marinated green olives (at the end) and instead of broth I used boullion powder.
For two generous chicken breasts 3hrs on high was perfect. Upon completion I added a slurry of water and 1T corn starch for a thicker sauce.  I served this over pasta. 
We will definitely make this again. 
In addition, we look forward to preparing the chipotle base. The flavor should be outstanding!

My family loved this recipe. It was very delicious and so easy to assemble and put in the crock pot. The only change I made to this recipe, was leaving out the extra tablespoon of adobo sauce. It still came out with a mild kick, but not overpowering. I served it over my own cilantro rice that I cooked in my rice cooker.

Doubled sauce.   I warm cheese & soup in microwave and stir together before pouring over chicken.   I add 1 mashed chipotle and 2 tblsp. sauce.   I often pre-cook chicken and leave slow cooker on "warm" setting all day when @ work.  Family loves this served over rice from Trader Joe's.  Could not be easier!

Awesome recipe. I implemented some  of my own touches. First   I pan seared the breast  then mixed in everything for the sauce then blended it with a mixer to get rid of the lumps before adding the breast then setting to low for 3 hrs. about in hour in i add about 3/4 cup of  sliced thin onions then the last hr i added about 4oz of sliced cramini mushrooms. Deff making this again!

Soooo delicious.  I made it with all the ingredients except the spoon of adobe; I used a blender to mix all the ingredients except the butter and chicken and then poured it in the slowcooker where I had placed the chicken.  Half way through I added some spaghetti pasta and it came out great.  I took some to work and they also loved it.  Will be making some AGAIN!!

My husband works late Sunday nights, so I've been playing a bit of a game where I cook a new recipe every week. It has to be a different one each time, and I have to surprise him every time. Well, I made this meal one of those nights - and he's already asking me to make it again! He LOVES it (and so do I!) The only thing I did differently was I couldn't find chipotle peppers at my grocery store, so I got a Chipotle mexican cooking sauce and added a few tablespoons of that over the chicken. So good!

Pretty dang good! This was my first time cooking with canned chipotle peppers in adobe sauce. Very different from what we're used to, but was definitely a great recipe! Flavor is hard to pair with anything but rice. We served over mexican flavored Knorr rice and it tasted absolutely terrific with the gravy/chicken over the rice... and then served with yellow corn for the side. This definitely has some heat, so be prepared. I have some diagnosed tummy issues so I have to be careful with 'super' spicy stuff, and unfortunately had some problems tolerating this dish because of the heat from the chipotle peppers. Otherwise we both thought the ease of the meal prep & the end result/flavor were both absolutely fantastic! I could not believe how moist the chicken was! I don't normally get that kind of result from other similar soup recipes and wonder if it the added butter, and/or the smoky chipotle peppers contributed to that. Definitely doesn't need to cook much more than 5 hours... I let it go 5-1/2 on the 10-hr smart crockpot setting (lowest setting I have that gently simmers) while I went to run errands and it was perfect!

Was a five-star recipe for me and my husband! But our younger children found it a tad spicy. Used slices tenderloins instead of breasts and served it over jasmine rice and I loved it. Would have it again easily!

Truth be told, my family said they didn't like it but would "choke it down" so it didn't go to waste. I followed the recipe exactly. Personally i didn't think it was that bad but wouldn't want to eat it again.

Great recipe! One thing I did changed was to mix the chipotle peppers and the adobo sauce together and used 1 tbsp of the mix per pepper substitute. Served on a bed of rice. Will be making this again.

This isn't half bad, but could use a bit more kick for my taste.  I also had the "lumpy" issue.  I transferred the chicken onto a plate at the end of cooking and hit the sauce with the immersion blender.  Voila:  smooth sauce!

I cut up the chicken and added chopped onion to it. Made it just perfect. Be careful not to put too much Chipotle Peppers in it. For varity I occasionally will roast garlic and add it to the sauce.

I made this recipe for my family and they loved it!. The only things I changed were the amount of chipotle peppers ( I used 2 instead of 3 and they were plenty spicy I think 3 would of been tooo much) also I used chicken tenderloins instead of breast and went ahead and followed the advice of others and mixed the cheese and other ingredients in a pan and combined it on low heat so I wouldn't have the lumpy problem. I also sauteed some onion and added that Lastly I agree 6 hours is far to long to cook this 3 1/2 was enough for my chicken to be fall apart tender. I served it over rice and it was an instant hit.

This recipe helped me discover that I can't stand either chipotle or adoba sauce, not sure which one was the deciding factor. It smelled and tasted like ham, which I can't stand.

Made exactly as written other than doubling recipe and adding portabello mushrooms, and used one can of cream of chicken and one of cream of mushroom. Aerved over brown rice. 18 year old daughter, myself, and husband really liked this. I couldn't believe how moist and flavorful the chicken was! I doubled the recipe in the hopes it would be good so I can freeze some of it for later meals, glad I did!

This was ok, but not great.  I found it a little bland.  The flavor didn't really get down into the chicken like I think it should have.  It may be more flavorful the next day, but it was not my favorite.

YUM! This is simplicity at it's best - several basic pantry ingredients and a little ingenuity combine to create a star quality (and easy!) dish. I didn't think for a moment that this would be as flavorful as it was. Joking aside, I could literally drink the sauce (it was THAT good). Other than using only 3 chicken breasts (all I had), adding half of a (small) minced onion and cooking everything on high for 3 hours (ran out of time...), I pretty much followed tnahinu's directions to the letter. TIP: You only need to slightly soften your cream cheese to avoid an unsightly lumpy sauce. It's not necessary to melt your cream cheese completely OR on the stovetop. I briefly zapped mine in the microwave, added the remaining ingredients (including onion) and stirred. A few tiny lumps remained, but they were small enough to melt completely during the cooking process. The result was a velvety smooth, SUPER flavorful sauce. Rice was the perfect complement to serve with our chicken (and was divine topped with the delicious sauce!). Steamed broccoli rounded out our meal. Thanks SO much for sharing your awesome recipe, tnahinu. This was the BOMB! :-)

Oh my.  Made this for the first time today... I think I could've ate all of it myself!  YUM.  I did heat up the soup with the broth first, and then let the cream cheese sit in the soup mixture just a little while to let it 'melt' a bit before adding to chicken.  Also instead of breast halves, I used 3 breasts cut up into large chunks.  Just was hoping it would cook faster and it ended up taking only a few hours.  Seems to make a lot of sauce but the sauce is what makes it so good! Great on top of rice but now anxious to try it with pasta!

I took the advice of some other reviewers and whisked all ingredients together (except the chicken) in a bowl and poured it over the chicken in the slow cooker and didn't have a lumping problem.  I also added some thinly slices onions, peppers, jalapenos and a packet of sazon to give it some color, flavor and a little kick.  There's a lot of sauce, which goes great with rice.  It was really easy to make and pretty good if you're looking for a nice chipotle flavor.

So easy and delicious.  I froze the remainder of the chipotle peppers and sauce for the next time I make it so it would not go to waste.  Thanks for sharing.

This was great served over rice, didn't even use the butter and it was great. My husband and I love spice, so I added an extra pepper and an extra tablespoon of adobo sauce. Will make this again.

Very creamy and delicious. Fantastic served over rice. I added a bit more of the chipotle sauce and it was very good. For some reason the cream cheese would not melt all the way into the sauce so I took the chicken out and put the sauce in the blender to smooth it out.

As written I ended up with way too much sauce but I saved the extra and used it over tortellini the following day.  I added mushrooms and some spinach too and served the chicken over rice.

This was great!  But I didn't really follow the directions.  I put the soup, butter (I used less), cream cheese, chicken broth and chipotle peppers (twice as many because I LOVE flavor and spice!) in a saucepan and whisked smooth over low heat.  I also threw in a spoonful of capers and some pepper.  NO EXTRA SALT NEEDED!  Then I spooned a small amount of sauce in the bottom of the crockpot, layered 2 breasts, added more sauce, layered 2 more breasts and realized I had enough sauce for 5 - so added more sauce, layered one more breast and covered with sauce. This worked out because my package of chicken had 5 breasts in it.  I only cooked it on low for 5 hours.  I stirred twice in the first two hours then left it alone and it was perfect!  I also added sauteed onion about 10 minutes before serving.  FAN-FRIGGIN-TASTIC!  I'm usually not a fan of cooking things BEFORE cooking things in the crock pot, but in this case, I thought the sauce would smooth out better if heated first, and it was only one extra pan - so no biggie.

Awesome!  Tasted almost like Voodoo Chicken from the restaurant Heaven on Seven.  I did not have a can of Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, so I substituted 3 tablespoons of Chipotle sauce I had available.  Therefore it was not as spicy.  Next time I will use the chipotle peppers with adobo sauce and shred the chicken and make enchiladas.   A keeper for sure.

This was a bit one-dimensional for me.  All I could taste were the chipotles (which I love) but I wanted something more.  I just need to make a rule not to make crock pot recipes that call for cream of chicken soup.  Yuck.

This was good, but not extraordinary. I used the exact ingredients, but prepared the sauce in a saucepan before adding it to the chicken in the crockpot. My husband and 3 kids thought it was "ok" but weren't keen on the idea of having it again. On a positive note, it's an easy recipe with quick prep time. I'm glad I tried it, but it won't be one of my go-to recipes.

Great flavor but WAY too spicy for a family meal. Next time I will only use 1 pepper and I going to try that new Philadelphia Cooking Creme in place of the cream cheese. I will make again for sure.

This was delicious!  Since I lost my sense of taste about a year ago, I'm always looking for recipes with some serious zing because I can feel the heat of hot peppers.  I used 3 large chipotle peppers and really enjoyed this meal.  Terrific!  Didn't change a thing except to use butter flavored spray instead of melted butter.

This was great! I used reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat cream of chicken soup and it was still delicious. I also mixed all the sauce ingredients up before and heated it in the micorwave for a minute to soften it, then emulsified it to make sure there were no stray "chunks" that other people have commented on. Next time I'll add mushrooms and onions to give it a little something extra. It had a good kick to it, perfect for me. My husband likes things reeeeally spicy so I blended the leftover chipotle/adobo sauce and he added extra to his afterwards. Will definitely make again!

this as DELICIOUS!  I can't believe how easy it was to make and the chicken came out sooo moist.  I had guests over for lunch and everyone raved over it!  It was kinda spicy, so if you don't like a lot of spice I would try either reducing the number of peppers you put in or omitting them altogether.

I have to say is that this recipe is amazing! I am a huge fan of chipotle flavor but my husband usually not so much but he loved this dish! It's even better the next day, we put it in a corn tortilla and had a chicken chipotle taco.  The only changes I made was to pre-mix everything before pouring it over the chicken and then added a little cornstarch once it was done to thicken it up a little. Chicken  was falling apart and it was delicious. I will definitely be making this dish again and again...thanks for sharing this recipe!

Wow. This recipe is SO good. Got rave reviews from my boyfriend. I wanted to make enough to have plenty of leftovers so I doubled the recipe for my large crockpot. Had to make some changes for this though (added another cup of chicken broth & a can of cream of mushroom soup). Based on other's reviews I added a can of mushroom and left out the butter. Because my bf and I both love spicy food I added the whole 7.8 oz can of chipotle peppers and sauce. It was spicy & very tasty. :) Thank you for sharing!!

This is the best crock pot recipe I have ever made.  I hate crock pot meals, but this came through on my email today, I had everything I needed, I made it, and I don't want to stop eating it.  SOOOOOOO goood.  I used 2Tbsp butter but only because I saw a review that said it didn't matter.  So it is probably fine any way, less or more.  OMG, this flavor is great, it was easy, I love it.

The recipe is pretty good.  It was very easy to make.  I put it in the slow cooker before I went to bed and it was ready when I got up.  A previous review said the sauce didn't blend well, I disagree.  The sauce was a smooth consistency.  I actually ate this with scrambled egg whites.  It was a little spicy for me and I didn't really like the smell.  The chicken was moist and the sauce tasted good with the egg whites.

Quick, easy and delicious.  My husband is not a big fan of chicken and he thought this recipe was really good.  That should tell you something.

Made this last night for dinner, taking someone's suggestion and blending the soup, broth, cream cheese and chipotle peppers before adding to the crockpot, and served over rice.  So easy!! My husband loved it and my 35 year old son said it was up there with high dollar restaurant meal!!  Will definetly make again, even for company.

So good! The whole family loves this recipe. Be careful with the peppers and adobo sauce, the heat can sneak up on you. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.

There was something missing.  I added about 1 tea ground coriander, about 1/4 tea of ground cumin and a pinch of cinnamon. Once I added the cinnamon, I would say this is 4 stars but the original really needed some work.

Easy and tasty.  The sauce was a bit runnier than I anticipated.

Very tasty!  I had my tastebuds all set for this recipe, but when I went to the fridge my cream cheese was out of date, but I had velvetta.  I used the velvetta and added a little more chicken broth.  The only other change I made was to sprinkle the chicken with a little cumin.  I shredded the chicken and added it back to the sauce.  I served over rice one night.  Tonight I heated flour tortillas in a skillet for a couple of minutes and used it as the stuffing and topped with sour cream, green onions and cilatro.  YUMMY!  I can't wait to try it with cream cheese, but I just wanted to let everyone know that it is yummy with velvetta too.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

This was surprisingly good!  I reduced the chipotle peppers to 2 to try it out and next time I will use 3 because we like spicy food.  I had no problems with the cream cheese clumps as others did and I threw everything in the crock pot (1 hour on high, 3 on low) and it was done.  So good served over yellow rice.

I made this the other night and did not make any changes to the recipe.  I thought it was fantastic!  This chicken does have quite a kick if you put the sauce on with it. I'm not a huge spicey fan so I tried to get a piece with most of the sauce off of it. My 6 year old liked it was well with that. My husband loved it with the sauce for that extra kick. We served it over an almond rice cooked with chicken broth and it was very tasty.  The whole house smelled wonderful. The chicken was done in well enough time.

This is excellent! You do want to watch the chicken so it's doesn't get over cooked but it's soooo good. I used Fat Free cream cheese and that didn't seem to make a difference.  I also doubled the amount of peppers as I knew everyone eatting eat liked spicy... and spicy it was!!!

We used chicken thighs instead of chicken breast and it still came out great. Adding three peppers made it a bit too spicy for our son so we'll probably reduce it down to one pepper next time.

Good, easy recipe. Unfortunately I couldn't find chipotle peppers, so I used a jalapeno. I don't think I got the desired effect though. Maybe I'll try some chipotle salsa next time? This recipe could also be done in a deep frying pan, if you don't have a crock pot.

Absolutely delicious!  The chicken cooks down a lot.  Next time I would add more, then shred it an hour before serving and let it soak in the sauce.  Also would make a great party dip!

WAY to spicy! And I can usually handle heat. No one but my husband could eat it. I suggest taking the seads out of the peppers and maybe only use 2 instead of 3.

This recipe was very easy to make. I used chicken breasts instead of legs I dredged the chicken in flour and browned both sides in evoo before putting it in the electric skillet to simmer for 30 minutes. I was expecting more heat from the peppers but wasn't spicy at all.

Hot, hot, hot.  This was way to hot for our midwest palates.    I don't think I cut the cream cheese blocks small enough, because there were still little lumps 6 hours later.  We may try this again, but leave out the peppers- or, at a minimum reduce them.  They seemed to add heat but not much flavor.  The idea of a cheesy chicken meal slow cooked is a good one though.  I made the recipe as is, no changes.
