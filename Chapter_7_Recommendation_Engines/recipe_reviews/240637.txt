These were very good, with a subtle eggnog flavor. I did cut the nutmeg back to 1/2 tsp, but other than that, followed the recipe. Great way to use up leftover eggnog from the Holidays. I'd make these again! The kids added chocolate chips to theirs, and gobbled them right up!

These were SUPER good! And super easy and quick to make which was nice! (We did add a small dash of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla to ours, and next time I may cut the nutmeg just a TINY bit). But these were fantastic, and turned out VERY fluffy!  (after the batter sits in the bowl 5 min, it's better) This recipe made us 3 large pancakes. (Also we were just a little shy of the required eggnog -which was just regular eggnog btw, not really thick- so we added a bit of half & half cream which probably helped!)

This was good. I took the advice of other reviewers and reduced the amount of nutmeg to 1/2tsp. Just be forewarned that these are pretty sweet. They really didn't syrup, but warm applesauce was a nice complement to the pancakes.

These were really good, great texture... Although I forgot to add the egg! Such fluffy pancakes, I'm not sure if I will ever add that egg.  Only thing I'd recommend is adding slot 1/4 TSP of salt if you're using homemade eggnog. I didn't and these were a little bland.

Pretty good, but too much nutmeg. I also felt that these needed salt.
