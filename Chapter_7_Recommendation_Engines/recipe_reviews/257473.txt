You know what I really liked about this dish? The pesto didn't over-power the dish like it can sometimes do. We loved that there was a lot of "juice" that we could soak up with some crusty bread. The flavors in this just worked! My Italian hubby made one suggestion, which I will do when I make this again, and that's to take the pasta out of the water a couple of minutes before it's "al dente" and finish the cooking of the pasta right in the pan with the clams and shrimp. Really nice recipe!

What a great recipe! My husband and I both enjoyed this very much. I was concerned that either the pesto or the clam flavor would overpower the dish but neither of them did. It was a perfect balance. This recipe is easy and quick enough to whip up on a weeknight and also one that is worthy enough to serve guests. It is impressive both in taste and in presentation.

This dish turned out well, and the clams and shrimp were cooked perfectly. There was plenty of sauce, and I served it with a crusty baguette for dipping.
I may play around with the sauce a little next time, to see if I can give it a slightly deeper taste.
