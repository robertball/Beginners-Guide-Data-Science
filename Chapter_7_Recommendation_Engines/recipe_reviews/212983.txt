My family and I have eaten various recipes of this classically delicious Filipino dish.  This one is just as tasty!  I added tripe, coriander, hot pepper flakes and cardamon to this base for a little extra YUM!

This recipe was good.  I recommend adding a little spice to it.  It will give it a little kick.

Looks like a good recipe, only difference would be that i'd add 1 cup of Peanut Butter instead of just 3 tablespoons. I like the peanut butter taste.

I made this with boneless short ribs instead and it turned out delicious! I also sauteed the eggplant, green beans, and (baby) bok choy with garlic before I put them into the stew.  My Filipino hubby gave it 2 thumbs up!

missing some important but hard to find ingredients like banana flowers and some tuber.
