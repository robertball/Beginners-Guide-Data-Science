This is a nice seasoning mix. I put it on corn. I'd like to try it on salmon. Thanks for the recipe. *update-This was good on fried sausage and potatoes, and also on saut√©ed zucchini and mushrooms.

I liked this recipes. However, I had to omit the celery seed and poppy seed because I didn't have any on hand. Still, was very flavourful and everyone enjoyed it.

Very good but I used too much red pepper flakes. A little too spicy for me but my husband likes it

Pretty tasty! I used it in some meatballs. I ran it through my mortar beforehand. Thank you for the recipe.

I left out the seeds because I don't do seeds.  I substituted a favorite herb blend for the Italian seasoning and parsley.  Everything else was per the recipe.  It worked beautifully on a beef cutlet.
