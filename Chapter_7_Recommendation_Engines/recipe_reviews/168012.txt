These bars are perfect!  I was looking for something to imitate a CLIF bar because I am sick of buying them and these may have been even better than the real thing! They are packed with protein and vitamins and minerals with all the nuts and grains.  They are very filling, as well. I added hemp seeds in with the nut powder for a little extra kick, and they kind of overtook the flavor of the rest of the nuts.  So I may go lighter on those next time.  I also substituted Agave Nectar for the honey because it has a lower glycemic index.  I am excited to try out different dried fruits and other sweet things such as peanut butter with this recipe.  It is perfect as is, though, too.  Thanks!

very good, I substituted more oatmeal for brown rice cereal, and sunflower nuts for soy nuts. I used whey protein powder in place of the milk powder. In place of all egg whites, I used 2 egg whites & 2 whole eggs. these freeze very well. I dbled the recipe & shared with the workout team.

These bars are the best homemade granola bars ever. They are chewy and moist but maintain their shape when cut into bars. Packed with healthy ingredients.  Only change I made is I’m not a chocolate lover so I left the chips out but added more nuts and grains. Didn’t have rice krispies on hand so I used a crunchy oat cluster cereal. Other than that, these bars are perfect and it’s a great idea to place them in baggies for those times you need a quick energy snack. Another idea, crumble these up into a container bowl and keep in fridge because it makes a great topping over yogurt and berries. Will definitely make again!

I made these following the recipe exactly and they are excellent.  I've tried to make my own also but they don't stay together as well as these.  The great taste is a bonus.  Good job.

These are excellent!  I changed the flavors a bit since I am not a chocolate fan, instead using lemon flavored chips (like chocolate chips, but lemon:), dried raspberries, and pistachios rather than walnuts.  The success of this recipe however goes to JDS800 for creating a bar that holds together, has great texture and just the right sweetness!
