Wasnt bad but this drink wasn't for me. All the 3 components made it too sweet. It does need a little crispness to balance it out. Maybe substitute the lemon-lime soda.

I tried this only because of the title. I'm such a Scrubs addict that I say "frick" obsessively. It's good, just a little sweet. I used apple pucker and peach schnapps. Good combo, just need to tone down the sweet. Maybe with using a ginger ale and a shot of vodka?

This is a great deck/poolside drink or when it's hot outside.  Very easy to make and you can even make this in a pitcher to serve at parties where guests can help themselves.  Very light and crisp but I think this is a girlfriend drink since my husband said it tasted too sweet for him.  Love that the apple schnapps gives this a tinge of light, green color to the drink when served in a clear beverage glass.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Decent!  Too sweet for me personally, but my mother loved it.  Maybe next time I'll use club soda to cut back on the sweetness.
