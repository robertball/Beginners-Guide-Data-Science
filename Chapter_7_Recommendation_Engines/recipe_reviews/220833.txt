Morels are so packed with flavor, they don't need a bunch of help otherwise. This is the way we always fix them, (except slight difference) I deep fry in 350 oil. Some people I know dips them in beaten egg and fine cracker crumbs. I have fried in butter, but I like the results with oil. Could always drizzle a bit of melted butter over them after frying, if desired.  The most I've ever found is enough to fill a grocery sack. If you've found some I'm jealous.

We dip ours in egg first, then flour, but just dipping in flour is good, too.  It's hard to do it wrong!  This recipe is sure making me want some!

I use full fat butter. I find that it tastes even better than shortening.

Being a cajun its hard to eat other regions food. When I came here I wa's dissapointed in most food and just ate at home. I had some friends over and they brought these. It was the best thing I ate around here.  I fix them a bit different. Flour is the best I agree.  I use butter to fry in. Butter is always better in a skillet. Also I use Tony chacheres creole seasoning. If you haven't had it get it. It much better than season salt with more flavor less salt.

Perfect recipe for cleaning and frying fresh morels! Do not fry in butter unless you're willing to change the butter after every panful. Hot oil & fast frying to retain moisture!

This is how I have made them in the past and I should have stuck to this recipe. I thought I'd be smart and do half flour half cornmeal for a change. I should have stuck to all flour. Lesson learned! Until next Spring...

Good base recipe! I usually soak them longer - overnight - and prefer to fry in butter or butter flavored shortening in a cast iron skillet, then salt liberally!

FYI: I would soak them a little longer than 5 minutes to get all of the bugs out...Anywhere from 1 hour to overnight should be alright. Also dip in egg before flower.
