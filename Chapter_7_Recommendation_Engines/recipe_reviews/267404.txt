Whoa! This is good! My reason for the 4 stars it is too spicy! I used a 3lb squash and made the recipe in an 8x8 dish. The directions are a little choppy, but everything turned out good. I would personally go with 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes next time. My husband doesn't like squash, but he couldn't stop eating this! Very comfort food!

This is delicious! I love the creaminess and the other veggies added to this. I made it as directed the first time and with Italian sausage the second time as an option with meat. Bother weâ€™re great.
