When I want chocolate cake, nine times out of ten, this is the cake I make.  Whether eaten plain, or my favourite way, which is sandwiched with dulce de leche and topped with chocolate ganache, it's brilliant!  One little thing though:  the directions are fine if you want to serve your cake in the pan, but if you want to unmould it for prettier presentation, your pan will need to be greased and floured, or brushed with bakers' secret (which is no secret: combine equal parts oil, shortening, and flour).  This means you should mix the cake in a separate bowl, but hey, it's still really easy and cleanup is minimal.

Now!  For all you people nervous about the vinegar:  there is a simple reason why it's there.  For a cake to rise, you need an alkali, and an acid.  When the alkali and the acid combine, they react with each other, giving off carbon dioxide, which is what makes the cake rise.  All cakes other than yeast cakes are risen this way.  The alkali/acid deal is present in baking powder (already mixed for you), and in recipes that call for baking soda (alkali) and, say, cream of tartar (acid).  In this case, you have baking soda (alkali) and vinegar (acid).  They react with each other and make the cake rise.  You CANNOT taste the vinegar, so relax, make the cake, and enjoy!

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could! My son was dignosed with an egg allergy about 6 months ago and I've been dreading his birthday ever since (it's this weekend)! I've been trying to get a decent egg free cake ever since. Last night in utter desperation I googled "egg free chocolate cake" (all my soon to be 3 year old wants for his birthday is an "chocolate Thomas (the Tank Engine) cake" - I found a 3-d train cake pan but every cake has flopped until today - until I tried the crazy cake - IT IS PERFECT - words cannot thank you enough! The only thing I would like to do now is try how to make the subsitition that amatullah suggested (cornstarch and orange zest instead of the cocoa) for an orange cake for my daughter's birthday - so if anyone knows how much cornstarch to use PRETTY PLEASE let me know!

I don't understand the bad reviews for this cake.  When I make a cake, this is the one I go to all the time.  I don't change the ingredients, but I DO change the method, so if anyone is interested I will describe.  I grease and flour two 9in cake rounds.  Sift all of the dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl.  Add the wet ingredients, and stir with a spoon until it's combined.  The vinegar will bubble with the baking soda.. it's supposed to.  The batter will be thin, but that's normal from what I can tell.  Although the recipe calls for a 13x9, when I baked it in that pan it took much longer than called for.  In the two 9in rounds, 30 minutes is perfect.  The cake is moist and there is ABSOLUTELY NO Vinegar taste.. AT ALL.  If you want a super duper chocolatey flavor, replace 1c of the water with coffee.  I know it sounds weird, but you won't taste the coffee.. only enhanced chocolate.  I'm no expert, but like I said.. every time I prepare the cake with this method, it is perfect.

This cake was delicious!  My father is undergoing chemotherapy and is on an extremely strict diet.  He couldn't eat eggs, so the recipe was a good base.  He also couldn't eat vinegar or chocolate, so Amatullah's suggestion about the orange cake conversion was great.  I substituted the cocoa with cornstarch and the vinegar with orange juice, and I added a teaspoon of orange zest.  I also exchanged the baking soda for baking powder.  It turned out perfectly!  If you're making the orange cake, I would suggest frosting it with Adora Marchi's "Mom's Buttercream Frosting," sprinkling a pinch of lemon zest over the frosting, and putting a slice of fresh orange on top.  Be sure to cool the cake completely before applying the frosting.  Thanks Amy and Amatullah; you made my father's birthday very memorable.

Wonderfully moist & flavorful - you'd never know this was egg free!
I usually halve the recipe & bake in an 8" pan for about 30-35 minutes (test for doneness).  Great when you want cake but not a huge panful.  Also makes great cupcakes (which freeze easily!)
I love how easy it is to change the flavors!  Our favorite is orange - just omit the cocoa & vinegar & use orange juice in place of the water (same amount as called for in recipe).

My mother made this cake for the last 40 years that I am aware of and it is always the best.  There is one difference in her recipe though, instead of two cups of water we use 2 cups of cool coffee, makes a BIG difference, try it.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!  I was also worried about the vinegar in the cake so I very tenatively tasted the batter...couldn't taste a bit of it.  I am a total chocolate fiend and have been placed on a special diet where I can't have any dairy products, I know what a chocolate cake should taste like and I was not disappointed in the least.  I will most likely continue to make this recipe even after I can eat normal foods again!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

One of the better egg free chocolate cakes!!  Add 1/3 bag of milk chocolate chips to the batter and it is spectacular.  It really adds a lot to the chocolate sensation.

Amazing. Have made it several times and it's worked great.
Couple of tips.

1) use ice cold water. if you remember your chemistry classes, the colder the water, the slower the baking soda + vinegar reaction will be. And you want as much reaction happening AFTER you put the cake in the oven, not before.


2) Mix (sift) the dry ingredients together in 1 bowl. Mix the wet ingredients in another bowl (or measuring cup). DO NOT mix the wet and dry ingredients together until everything else is ready (oven hot, pan greased, etc). 


3) If you are having trouble getting the cake out of the pan, throw the entire pan + cake in the freezer overnight. That will prevent the cake from tearing when you take it out. I found the cake easier to frost when semi-frozen too.

this is an unbelievable cake!  it was very moist.  the taste right out of the oven was a little off...but if you let it sit for a day in the fridge all that will change and you will have a wonderfully moist and chocolately cake.

This cake tastes like any other great chocolate cake, which is why it's absolutely fabulous.  No eggs, super easy and quick, and it tastes like you spent the entire afternoon making it.  I tried it once with cake flour and it was so moist like it came out of a mix.  It's what I always make now when I'm having guests and am pressed for time.  This will be the only chocolate cake I ever make.

I made this as cupcakes - a half recipe makes 12, baked about 22 minutes.  I wanted them with no frosting for a change, so to get some sweet and creamy chocolate richness without it I threw in a half cup of mini chocolate chips.  If you don’t have eggs and you’re looking for a good, moist chocolate cake that’s neither  too dark nor too light and not too sweet, so that it can support a sweet, rich butterceam  frosting or none at all, that rises nicely, creating perfect cupcakes (in my case), then make this cake.  If you DO have eggs and you want a cake like this, make this cake.  Note: I did have eggs.  I just think today's a crazy day which is why I chose this recipe.  :)

This cake is so easy, delicious and versatile! We don't have any allergies & we're not on any special diets and this is still a cake we will make over and over again! This chocolate one is wonderful and you can sub cold coffee for the water for a more intense chocolate flavor. I've made a vanilla version by subbing extra flour in place of the cocoa powder and throwing in a little extra vanilla extract. The orange one is AMAZING!!!  You sub extra flour for the cocoa powder in the recipe, orange juice for the water and add the zest of one large orange to the batter.  Topped with whipped cream or an orange glaze -WOW!  I've seen lemon and spice versions as well and I can't wait to try them!!

I have been making this recipe since I was a teenager.  There is one helpful thing you can do to make sure this comes out right: starting with just the dry ingredients take a fork and blend them all in together so there's no pockets of cocoa or flour, etc.  Then if you want to make 3 wells in the dry ingredients and add vanilla in one, the oil in one and the vinegar in the 3rd (you don't actually have to do this for this cake to turn out great, but it's fun, especially if doing it with younger kids). Then pour the water over the whole thing.  Now take a fork again and mix gently until all liquid and dry ingredients are mixed up, checking the sides and corners.  Check for lumps of dry ingredients and "fork" those. Do NOT beat this or it will be not be tender and moist.  We

My sons are allergic to eggs, and I have made this cake many times.  This recipe is so easy!  I just made a fantastic 'coconut cake' version.  I omitted the cocoa and used coconut milk instead of water and I put coconut flakes over a white icing.  The results were very, very good.

We did this cake when I was young, but to add to the craziness, mama would chunk it up, put it in a big bowl, make a pan of runny chocolatey peanut fudge frosting, pour that over it, and add whatever dried fruit she had soaked up, put it in a big dish that looked like a flower pot,  made sure the frosting was soaked up into the cake so it looked really messy then took our homemade gumdrops and rolled them into little cylinders, so they looked like worms and called the ' mess' our garden cake.  Made the cake go a lot further, and I used it when I was raising my two girls alone.  I think about that flower pot cake, every time I pass a package of gummy worms, to this day, and I am past 85.

This cake is great as is but if you decide to make it with Gluten Free Flour it comes out even better tasting, like a flourless cake so then its Egg Free, Dairy Free, and gluten free but tastes amazing.

i've read a lot of shock at putting vinegar in a cake batter.  this is a common replacement for baking POWDER which often contains aluminum.  1 tsp baking POWDER = .25 tsp baking SODA + .5 tsp cream of tartar.  if you do not have cream of tarter you may substitute an acid such as lemon juice or vinegar.  in that case you would use .5 tsp baking SODA + 1.5 tsp acid (you triple the acid).  although you may substitute lemon juice you absolutely NEED an acid for the cake to rise properly.  DO NOT JUST LEAVE OUT THE VINEGAR!!!!  i guarantee that it does cause a funny aftertaste as it 's only function is to cause a chemical reaction with the baking soda to cause the cake to have a light and fluffy texture.   additionally, i often decrease the amount of sugar in this recipe (i can't imagine a cake with MORE than 2 CUPS of sugar in it) and it stills turns out DELICIOUS.

I followed the suggestions that others made:  used cake flour, put in 50% more cocoa (I used dark cocoa) and used cold coffee in place of 1/2 the water. Turned out great!!!  Oh- I also added chocolate chips, but I don't think it needed them.
  Although my daughter has an egg allergy that prompted me to look for an egg-free recipe, I've had 3 people ask me for the recipe that don't need to worry about eliminating eggs!

I LOVE this recipe. Not only is it super easy and very tasty, but it's also "vegan" - meaning vegetarians who don't eat eggs or dairy can eat this cake. Most vegan cakes are like cardboard, but this one is moist and fluffy. I was leery at first, fearing it wouldn't rise. But it turned out great and my whole family - even the non-vegans - gobbled it up. I will make this many many more times.
Note: I frosted it with "Best White Icing Ever" from this site, using half shortening and half margarine. Very creamy, very easy and also vegan.

I really love this recipe! I had to try it, after tasting it at a friend's child's birthday party. With so many of our friends' children having egg allergies and having some vegan friends, too, this recipe is perfect. Even my egg-loving dad says the cakes come out tasting very good.

After reading other reviews, I've made the following adjustments:

Chocolate (original) version: I subbed cooled coffee for the water, which gave it a richer flavor.

Vanilla GF version: I replaced the amounts of the AP flour and cocoa powder in the recipe with GF flour, and doubled the amount of vanilla extract. My hubby actually preferred this over the original, with and without frosting.

Orange version: For the recipe halved (9 servings), I replaced 2/3 of water with OJ and, added the zest of 1 large orange, and subbed orange extract for the vanilla. I baked it in a Wilton giant cupcake pan for closer to 50 min. My mom thought it was too sweet, but my dad and 3yo chocoholic son loved it.  I might have to reduce the amount of OJ, or do only fresh-squeezed next time. It doesn't even need frosting. 

I usually do one small cake for my children to blow out the candles, and the rest are cupcakes. The cupcakes usually take as long as the box mix versions do. 

I will be making the original and vanilla versions for my daughter's first birthday party next week. I'm so glad my friend referred this recipe!

I need eggless cakes due to my daughter having an egg allergy.. and this recipe is perfect!  The cake is moist, fluffy and just delicious.  Couple things worth noting:  You can use canola oil instead of vegetable oil if anyone has a soy allergy - either oil works fine and tastes the same.  You can also make this cake into vanilla cake by omitting the cocoa and using vanilla Jello pudding mix instead - delicious vanilla cake (I added just a tad bit more vanilla if making vanilla cake).  Delicious cake!

I've used this recipe for years, I just mix all the ingredients in a bowl and bake in a pan I spray with cooking spray. I bake it in an 8x8 square pan or increase the ingredients 50% and bake in a 9x13.  As is, it is the best cake you'll ever bake because you probably have the ingredients already and don't have to worry about not having eggs.  For variety, I've added a 1oz bottle of red food coloring for a Red Devil's food cake and if you really want rave reviews, substitute the two cups of water for two cups of cold coffee.  Talk about enhancing the chocolate flavor.  Top with a cream cheese frosting (try Cream Cheese Frosting II) and accept the blue ribbon.  I told my son, who I make this cake for all the time, if he learns to make this cake (and he is trying) the ladies will be knocking at his door (in a few years.)  I almost made this cake yesterday, but already had a jar full of chocolate chip cookies and I didn't want the guilt fest.  An easy recipe to teach kids how to bake.

I attempted to sub cocoa for carob - don't do the same! While the taste was alright, the smell was so overpoweringly carob hat no one wanted to try it.

My mom has been making this cake since I was very young, and still, it is my go-to EASY recipe for a dense, moist chocolate cake. I frost it with a decorator icing with almond flavoring... If you REALLY want a decadent treat, drizzle some chocolate ganache on top and let it set. Yumm-0h! Oh, and if you want fat free, substitute apple sauce for the oil. If you want less sugar, just put half the sugar in it. It really is a versatile recipe.

This is going to be my go-to recipe from now on.  I added 3/4 cup of cocoa and a 1/3 cup of chocolate chips because other reviewers complained it wasn't chocolate-y enough. I also decreased the sugar and used 1 1/2 c instead of 2. It was plenty sweet! 
I made a big cake and after it cooled, I used dental floss to make two equal sized layers. I filled it and frosted with the Chocolate Ganache recipe that can be found on this site. 
it definitely takes better the next day and the day after that!

Fast, easy, and turned out fabulous! It was so moist! I was afraid that using under a cup of cocoa it wouldn't be very dark or rich- I was wrong! I made 2 batches for a teired cake and did not have enough vanilla for the second batch, so I used almond. It was really good too. The cake has a small crumb and is great for decorating! Easy to frost and held up really well. It was so moist! I can't get over that. It was still really moist and good the following day too.

This wonderful recipe saved me a trip the grocery store this morning.  Remembering that my son needed cupcakes for school tomorrow, we decided to make chocolate cupcakes, and then realized we had just used the last of the milk and eggs on breakfast.  I found this cake recipe, made it into cupcakes, and they were perfect.  I have tried to adapt other chocolate cake recipes into cupcakes, and have had a few mishaps.  But this recipe worked very well, baking up beautifully.  I topped these with decorator frosting (from this site) and then made spiderwebs with melted chocolate.  My son was thrilled with the outcome and I was thrilled that I saved a trip to the store.

This cake is so easy to make and delicious it deserves 5 stars based on just that.  I gave it 4 stars because when I baked this cake as stated it had a weird taste.  Increase cocoa pwdr to 3/4 cp and this is a 5 star recipe.   This is not the best chocolate cake, but considering how simple and quick it is to make .... one has to be CRAZY not to love it.   I just dump all the dry ingredients into a 9 X 13 pan ... make sure baking soda does not have any lumps ... mix thoroughly ... add all the wet ingredients in a jug and pour over dry ingredients ... mix thoroughly with a fork until uniform consitency ... It cant get much simpler.    If you don't have vingear subsitute equal amount of lemon juice.  Tastes better after refrigeration and is great for freezing.  I actually bake this as cupcakes and freeze as an easy snack to pack for lunch.  My kids look forward to finding this in their lunch box.

I follow the recipe as stated, except I do increase the cocoa a bit.  This recipe also halves easily for an 8X8 cake with the same great results. I have been using this recipe for years and it never disappoints. Thanks for sharing!

As a mom of a son who's allergic to eggs and milk...thank you so much!! What a great recipe. The only thing I changed was I added 1/2 cup brown sugar (because the first cake I made just wasn't quite sweet enough). The addition of the brown sugar was perfect! The cake even holds together. (try making a cake with no eggs..falls apart easily) I made a Spongebob cake and iced it with (vegan)buttercream icing and it was a HUGE hit at my sons birthday party.

This cake is awesome! Can't even tell that it doesn't have eggs. Perfect for my son as he is allergic to eggs. I used 1 cup of Hershey's Special Dark cocoa and a cup of mini chocolate chips.

This cake is THE BOMB. It's so incredibly easy to make, and out of all the times I've made it, it's never let me down. It always bakes so beautifully! I threw in a little espresso powder to give it a more coffee-like taste last time... delish!

Great cake recipe! I’ve been using this one for every holiday or family party I’ve gone to for the last year. I was looking for something my nephew (who is 4 and allergic to nuts, soy and milk) could have. I changed the oil to canola and everything else was good to go. He loved it and was glad he could have cake again. Thank you so much for submitting this recipe!

I have been searching for this recipe for a long time! My mom use to make cake this way all the time, but had lost the recipe. I remember how tastey and fully it was. 
One of the other benefits to this recipe (besides growing up with it), is that it is also Vegan. No eggs, or milk! My brother is Vegan, so I can make this for him as well!
Thank you for posting!

I have been meaning to review this for some time, and let me just say I found this recipe about two months ago and I have made it 4 times already.  Do exactly as she says and you will have a perfect, moist cake. If you want to get it out of the pan when your done just grease it with oil or shortening pretty good before you put the batter in there.  BUT keep your eye on the cake and make sure it doesn't over cook. Or else it will be a sad cake =(

I love this recipe! I was skeptical at first, but I followied the ingredients and recipe exactly...right down to mixing with a fork. This cake came out perfectly moist with a great chocolate flavor. I normally do not like chocolate cake, but this is delicious! I believe the "mix with the fork" portion of the directions is crucial. You don't want to overbeat/over blend the ingredients or you won't get a moist cake. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

This is a very similar recipe to one I've been using from the Greek Orthodox Lenten Recipe book to which I made one modification - I used Rasberry Wine Vinegar to give the chocolate a "kick". For all those who haven't tried this cake yet, it is absolutely delicious and so light!

At our house the only frosting for this cake is junior mints! - once the cake comes out of the oven, sprinkle a box (or two!) of junior mints on top and put the cake back in the oven for a minute or two until the mints are soft enough to spread - YUMMY!

I beleive this is the best chocolate cake I've ever eaten...and I've tried a lot in search of the best recipe.  I added about 1/2 cup hot fudge topping (the ice cream hot fudge) into the batter.  So good and moist.  My friends rave about my chocolate cake.  I use chocolate buttercream frosting.  Don't forget the milk!

This is really good!  It tastes a lot like a brownie, and the texture is somewhere in between a light brownie and cake.  This is the first cake I've made without eggs, and it's an easy one with ingredients most people have on hand....in other words it an "it's raining and I can't go to the store but I need chocolate right now!" kind of cake :)  I frosted it with chocolate cream cheese.  I will make this again sometime, and maybe try a lighter frosting and chocolate chips.  Thanks for the recipe!

the perfect recipe as written!  only change i made was to use a bowl versus making it in the pan.  so delicious.  great for vegans, people w/ allergies and anyone looking for a great chocolate cake recipe.  almost too simple to believe!

I made this tonight as directed and thought it was a wonderful cake!  I made as directed except that I put all the ingredients in a Kitchenaid mixer and then poured the batter into a pan sprayed with cooking spray.  I loved that this was so easy to make!  I also loved that this was vegan-no dairy or eggs.  I thought the cake was moister than most home made chocolate cakes-lighter.  This will probably be my "go to" cake for chocolate cakes.

Great cake! Comes out very moist and with a nice flavor. I was kinda worried it might taste tangy because of the vinegar but it really doesn't.

SO EASY and so delicious.  I substituted the water with coffee and frosted the cake with cream cheese frosting.  The coffee will really help bring out the flavor.

This has been a staple in my family for as long as I can remember. The only thing I do differently  is that I substitute leftover coffee for the water sometimes. It gives it even more chocolate depth.

I misplaced my crazy cake recipe that I'd used for years, so was very pleased to find this one. My recipe was for a single layer in an 8X8 pan, and this is very close to it, if I halved the ingredients. The only difference I see is that my recipe called for 3 tablespoons cocoa & 6 tablespoons oil. Otherwise, this recipe appears to be exactly doubled.  I love this cake, which is so moist, I never felt the need for any kind of frosting, just occasionally would put a dollop of whipped cream on top. It's so easy to whip up, right in the pan. I always this when I'm having a chocolate craving, and it satisfies it perfectly!

Very good and easy, but my advice - DO NOT make it in the baking dish. Instead, please use a bowl and pour the mixed ingredients into the baking dish. I began by following the recipe exactly - pfff - I had to pour it into a bowl to get it mixed right and then pour it back into the baking dish. What a mess!!!

My grandmother told me about this cake when I was little, explaining that she made this during the Depression quite a bit. I make this every once and a while with my eldest and tell him the same stories that she told me, to keep tradition. It's dear to me for that reason. That being said, though it turns out a moist cake, it dosen't have much flavor other than sweet. It's not a favorite of mine.

I love this recipe!  I've been an eager eater of this cake for YEARS and YEARS!  I finally made it to my grandmother's standards just recently and I was eager to see if there were other recipes and how they differed.  They are all pretty much the same, except my recipe has a tsp. of cinnamon in the cake mix.  I would urge anyone to add the cinnamon to their cake mix the next time they stir one up...just to see if there is any difference!  Happy baking!

This is the first recipe I learned how to make as a child and is the birthday cake of choice in my family.  I've never made it in the baking pan, though.  I always mix it in a bowl, then pour it into whatever baking pan I'm using.  I've even baked crazy cake "muffins" (didn't have any cupcake liners and wanted cupcakes!).  It is the only cake my husband will eat, too!  I do have a suggestion for when mixing the batter in a bowl: use a whisk to combine all of your dry ingredients (well, except the baking soda...I'm still a kid at heart and love to watch "chemistry in action").  This will keep your cake nice and light.  Also, don't overmix the batter...my mom has made that mistake several times!  We'll top it with buttercream frosting, penuche (caramel) frosting, or usually just a very generous dusting of powdered sugar.  Enjoy!

Great Recipe! This was the last egg free recipe I had to make for my son who just passed his egg challenge and is NO LONGER ALLERGIC TO EGGS!!! Funny thing... we'll still make this cake even though we don't need to. It's easy enough that my 4 year old can help prepare it, I always have all the ingredients on hand, and it is delicious! You'd never know it was egg free. Plus I love that it doesn't have that heaviness that many scratch cakes have. Thanks for sharing!

What a wonderful recipe works well with Gluten free flour. I use fibre mix
Kids love this cake and make it egg and gluten free for birthday parties and other children do not know it is not a "real" cake.

My son is allergic to eggs.....thank goodness for this recipe.  I make this cake (or cupcakes) and bring to birthday parties, holiday parties, etc......I would hate for my son to miss out on the treats because of his allergies!  I have made it with the cocoa and also tried the orange version (substitute corn starch for the cocoa, use orange extract and orange zest.....as mentioned in another rating)....they are both fabulous, moist, and everyone loves these cakes!

I have several severe allergies, eggs being one of them...I keep trying to find good cake/cupcake recipes, but with no luck! After reading the reviews of this one, I decided to give it a try and it turned out perfectly! My family (none of them have allergies) says it tastes identical to regular chocolate cake with eggs, they can't stop eating it! I baked at 350 as the recipe says for 36 minutes. It's even better the next few days! Thank you so much to whoever submitted this recipe, you've finally allowed me to enjoy cake after all these years!

I have made this cake many times as written but when I needed to bake a cake that was not only egg free but chocolate free I substituted the cocoa power for the grated rind of one orange. It was fantastic! Everyone loved it! I used the juice of the orange in the icing and decorated the cake with candied orange and lemon slices.

I helped my 12 year old make this cake and though it was moist and fluffy, it lacked taste.  I think I will try this again and add chocolate chips as another reviewer suggested.

One reviewer said it tasted like "flavored flour" well I agree. It was a bitter flavored flour. I tried to cover up the bitter flour taste with Hershey's syrup n my fam ate it. I will not make again...

First time I made this, I followed directions exactly.  Turned out terrible since I could not mix it well in the actual pan.  When the cake was done, it stuck to the bottom - impossible to get out!  And the unmixed flour/soda was a bitter, unwanted surprise in each bite! The second time, I put everything in a bowl so EVERYTHING could be properly mixed.  I GREASED the baking pan.  What a difference these 2 simple steps made!  Now, I can absolutely agree with the raving reviews - decadent!!  Oh, I also added some chocolate chips. 3 stars due to the modifications from the original recipe.  With the modifications, 5 stars!!

Edit- 10-21-2016: this is the only chocolate cake I make now (with modifications aforementioned). I did try subbing coffee for water and adding chocolate chips - both will boost up the chocolate flavor. Be forewarned, it is very rich! So rich that my husband won't eat more than 1 piece due to it being too chocolate-y (such a thing?)

This cake is good, but the process of sifting all the dry ingredients into the cake pan itself was a bit annoying, I think you're better off sifting and mixing everything in a large bowl.  The cake itself comes out very moist and tasty though :)

Not bad at all! I changed the recipe a bit because I didn't have any cocoa. I used brown sugar instead of cocoa as you would with a blonde brownie, I also added a bag of chocolate chips to the batter, then I frosted the cake with Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting found on this website. The family loved it! It was dense but moist and full of flavor. I can't wait to make it again with the cocoa!

I've made this twice (halved, in an 8x8 pan) and it is delightfully easy and tasty.  My only complaint is that the center tends to sag.

The second time, I replaced the water with mint-flavored milk (St. Patrick's day special) and added 3/4C chocolate chips to make a mint-chocolate chip cake (delicous - highly recommend!).

I'm giving this five stars because it was so easy, texture and flavor were both great!!! We added a little shredded coconut to ours because I bought way too much and need to use it up, we liked that addition as well, but that is the only change we made.

If I could give more stars, I would! I followed the recipe EXCEPT for one thing, instead of adding 1/2 c. of cocoa powder, I added 1 cup. I truly recommend this recipe, I will turn to this one! Thanks Amy!

Wow, so so good.  I put very little effort into mixing the cake and doing precise measurements & baked for 40 mins.  I added in a cup of mini semi sweet chocolate chips and it turned them into soft/gooey texture, like soft brownies because the chips melted and mixed in during baking. It was a huge hit at my office and so little effort.  I would recommend adding different chips to the recipe for extra flavor, like peanutbutter or butterscotch chips too.

I wanted to try this to see if it lives up to its reputation in the reviews...and it almost did! Next time I will add some dark chocolate chips to give it a little kick. I felt that the recipe called for too much to fit into a 9x9 pan, so I halfed all the ingredients and it came out fitting perfectly well in a 9x9. Before I dig in I like to pop it in the microwave for 15 seconds - tastes much more decadent warm!

I love this cake. Wow. So easy to make, not too many ingredients and you can add/adjust and still come out with a perfect cake! I'm neither vegetarian nor lactose intolerant but I wanted something simple that I could tweak if I wanted (and if the eggs weren't around) and this is it! It was just so easy. Thanks!!! P.S. This cake is good with spices such as cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon added. It rose very nicely too. And even though I didn't grease the pan, I guess the oil (I used olive oil) made it so nice and moist that it never even stuck too much to the pan so I could scoop each piece out clean with a fork or spoon.

I made 24 cupcakes with this recipe. I sifted all dry ingredients together and then combined wet ones. Slowly mixed with blender until it was well blended. Baked at 350 for 18 mins. It's a really nice chocolate cake...moist and a bit more dense than a box mix.

I call this a crazy dump cake.  I dumped everything in one bowl and stirred with a whisk and put in a 13 x 9 pan.  The only different thing I did was to add two teaspoons of instant coffee to enrich the chocolate flavor.  I learned that from the Barefoot Contessa to add either liquid coffee or granules to make the chocolate even better.  The cake is so simple that a novice cook can do it.  Great cake, thanks.

Pretty fantastic, especially for an eggless cake. I made it for my mother in law's birthday (lord) because my brother in law has an egg allergy. The first time I tried it it was fairly dry, so I added 1/3 cup milk the second time, and it was perfect. Nice cake!

This is the same recipe my husband's grandma uses...and all the cake makers behind her ;).  The only difference is her recipe only uses 2 tsp vinegar and 1 tsp vanilla and back it for 40-50 minutes at 350.  This recipe is fanastic!  Rich and delicious!  Use a fudge frosting and it's to die for!

Great dessert cake for my vegan and non-vegan family.  I do like to add an extra tablespoon or two of cocoa powder and I cut back the sugar (I use organic) to 1 1/2 cups.  Delicious every time!

I was always looking for an eggless cake and chanced upon this cake. I have made this cake so many times and it never fails me. It is so simple and fast - easy to clean up too as there are not that so many dishes. Not only adults, but my toddler also loves it! I have omitted the cocoa powder to make it a white cake and that too came out very well. I have put some raisins and nuts in it to give it a richer flavor and that was very well appreciated. Thanks for the great recipe.

I had never made this cake before, much less heard of it till I got married.  It is my husband's favorite and now I love it. You can cut, place in ziploc bags and freeze too.  This cake tastes great with out a frosting, but if you want to frost it should be a light frosting.

This was suprisingly good and easy!  I made half a recipe and added about 6oz of milk chocolate chips to the batter.  I did mix the batter in a bowl, and lightly greased my 8" square pyrex pan, baked about 35 minutes.  This reminded me of snack cakes that my mom used to make when we were kids, no icing, just simple and good.  So glad to share that memory with my kids, thanks to this recipe!  By the way, I also did manage to make a "yellow cake" version of this (to a HALF recipe, I added 1/4 cup flour, 1 additional tsp. vanilla, and a few drops of yellow food coloring to get that nice yellow cake color).  I bet you could make all kinds of yummy cake flavors though, I will try mint chocolate chip next!

I made this cake last year with my son. I got the recipe out of a magazine. He has been bugging my since to make it again he enjoyed it so much. The best part about it is that it's easy enough for a six year old to make but it taste like it took time to make!!! Great chocolate taste, too!!!

I've been making  this recipe for over 60 yrs-learned from my grandmother! Its always light as a feather. Don't be afraid of the vinegar-I think it reacts with the b.soda to make the cake so light!! One bowl-great for the little chef in your life.

This recipe fails to explain the purpose of the vinegar. Vinegar reacts with the baking soda to create a moist and tender crumb. As an acid, the vinegar mixed with the baking soda releases carbon dioxide to "raise" the batter. It is important to immediately put the batter in the oven because the air bubbles can be lost over time.

I suspect the negative reviews who think the flavor is "off" either did not mix/combine well, or let the batter sit too long after mixing before putting in the oven. 

Grease your pan ahead of time. 

It is best to sift the dry ingredients over whisking. Whisk the liquid ingredients in a separate bowl. Then add the liquid ingredients to the dry ingredients and use a whisk to thoroughly combine. Pour in the mixed batter and put immediately into the oven or you will lose the bubbles formed by the vinegar reacting with the baking soda.

Another step to ensure it is moist is to make it a day ahead. This cake gets more moist after several hours if you do not eat it right away.

For more chocolate flavor, you may increase the unsweetened cocoa powder to 2/3 cup (instead of 1/2). And/or reduce the vegetable oil to 1/2 cup (or substitute applesauce).

Finally, a scratch made cake recipe that didn't fail me!  Traditionally I have not had good luck with cakes, but this one turned out perfectly.   I wanted to make a spice cake so I used 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp allspice, 0.5 tsp nutmeg, and 0.25 tsp cloves in place of the cocoa powder in this recipe.  All else was the same.  It turned out beautifully!   I couldn't find my 9x13 pan, so I used a Bundt pan, and it baked in around 55-60 minutes.

I halved the recipe for an 8x8 dish, and it came out perfectly moist and delicious. Next time, I'll make the 9x13 because it went fast!

My grandma used to make this cake but called it Hard Times Cake - a depression era recipe. Love that it doesn't taste as sweet as other cakes. Great with powdered sugar sprinkled on top.

I feel the chocolate level is far too low, even after substituting some water with coffee.  I would recommend at least doubling the cocoa in future batches.

This vegan cake is better than most box mixes. However it lacks the depth of flavor that butter and eggs usually provide in a home-made cake. After the first time I made it I've compensated by doubling the vanilla and cocoa, and this is now a favorite around the house.

This recipe is the absolute best. My younger son is allergic to eggs so I've been trying different recipes . This one was a winner ! I've made it quite a few times.  I altered it a bit though...I added 1/2 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips, a handful of cranberries and I also added 4 tsp of baking powder( I found it strange that the recipe didn't call for it so I've never tried it without ). The chocolate chips melted n the cranberries added a pleasant burst of  flavor. On the last occasion I substituted melted butter /margarine for the oil. I found that the texture was superb. Think I'm gonna stick to that one. In any event, This ones a keeper for sure.

Very delicious!  Made cupcakes with recipe (made 24) for a birthday party and they got rave reviews!  I used coconut oil instead of vegetable.  The fact that they are vegan was a plus.

This is my family's favorite cake!! I have made it for years as well as my mother and grandmother. In addition to chocolate chips, I have also made this recipe by omitting the oil and adding a can of cherry pie filling. I also place plastic wrap or tin foil over the pan soon after taking it out of the oven and allow it to cool covered. By doing this, it makes a "fudge-like" topping on its own! As always, we top each piece with whipped topping! YUM!

Loved the moist texture of this cake,and I can tell it would be amazing if I had been a slightly more experienced cook. I followed one reviewers suggestion to make the orange cake by substituting cornstarch for cocoa and orange juice for water. Well a 1/2 cup of cornstarch was awful in this. Texture was great, but flavor had horrid aftertaste. Follow the reviewer who suggested substituting flour for cocoa, not cornstarch.  Apparently cornstarch is meant to be used in small amounts.......:)

Good base recipe. Note to self... do not use peanut oil (which is what I had in the house) since it gives it a peanut buttery smell to the recipe. I substituted sugar for maple syrup since I didn't have any at home. Even with the changes it turned out really good. ^.^

GREAT chocolate cake!!!  You dont even miss the egg or dairy!  I did not mix in the baking pan like instructed.  I used 2 seperate bowls; one for mixing the dry ingredients and the other for mixing the wet, then I combined them together.  Made a little bit of cream cheese frosting and it was awesome.  Even my super picky toddler loved this, thanks for sharing.

A neighbor of ours taught my mother how to make this cake back in the 70's, the only difference is that it was made in an iron skillet. I remembered it the other day and searched for the recipe on this site and low and behold here it was. I remembered the ingredients just didn't know the quantities. I made it for two 9 yr. old's and they loved it. One boy told me that he didn't like chocolate but after trying this cake,, he'd changed his mind. He said it was the best cake he'd ever eaten. The cake was moist and rich and just as wonderful as I remembered it from when I was a kid. Thank you so much for the recipe, it's definitely going be the only chocolate cake recipe I use! I frosted it with the rich chocolate frosting from this site and it really was just phenomenal.

First time to make Crazy Cake (or Wacky Cake, which appears to be the same thing).  Discovered too late that I was about 1/2 c shy of flour. Subbed 1/4 c cornstarch for 1/2 c flour.  This came out great.  Delicious flavor, with a soft crumb.  I made a sheet cake out of it and baked about 20 min.  I also mixed the ingred in a bowl instead of the pan (sifted dry ingred, stirred with whisk until well mixed, made the 3 wells as described for the 3 liquids, then poured the water over all, and whisked it thoroughly).  This recipe is a keeper.  You would never ever guess no eggs or milk.  I frosted with a melted butter vanilla almond frosting: melt 1 stick butter, whip in 1/2 of a bag of powdered sugar, 1 tsp each of almond and vanilla extracts, and a few tsps hot water until lump-free, and desired thickness.  Pour over hot cake, cool, Enjoy!  Great combo.  Great recipe.

Edit: made this again using my directions above for a sheet cake, took more like 25 min to bake. Also to have enough frosting for the sheet cake, I had to increase my butter to 1.5 sticks, and p. sugar to 3/4 bag, and add a bit more hot water. Great recipe. To be honest every bit as good as one I have using buttermilk, and the Ina garten one using coffee.

My grandmother made this cake for years and it was the 2nd (the 1st was a pineapple upside down cake I made in home ec class) cake I ever made from scratch. I used to take it to the church socials. everyone loves it because it's so moist. I never frost it. It doesn't need it.

This is a solid recipe.  I just baked this one, and is cooling on my living room table.  This is quite a soft cake without any eggs.  This has to be because of the oil, baking soda, and vinegar.  

I followed the ingredient list exactly and instructions.  The flavor is quite good, although, I felt it was not chocolately enough with 1/2 cup of cocoa.  It very well could be the powder im using, but I dont think so.   This is a solid cake recipe.  

One thing to note, when making, when you add the liquid, and start mixing it will seem pretty liquid like.  After some time, it will thicken up turning into the consistency of a normal cake batter.  Dont worry if it seems too wet at the beginning of the mix process.

A very moist, fluffy cake.  My favorite non-dairy cake option so far.  I would increase the chocolate content a bit personally, but otherwise it's pretty good.

An old fashion cake that got better the 2nd day. I always highlight a recipe if it has a feature like NO EGGS for those times when it will come in handy. A denser cake but moist.

My fiance is the one who threw this together- He combined all the dry ingredients, then made one 'well' in the middle for the wet ingredients and mixed it all up. He opted to use leftover coffee from the AM instead of water. Baked for 35 mins, which was a little too long- 30 mins would have been perfect. Didn't ice or glaze it. Had a slightly odd taste and texture after baking, but the next day both improved greatly and is comparable to a traditionally made chocolate cake. Just don't over-bake!

My mom would make this cake and she always made it so dramatic when she added the vinegar to the soda.  Can't wait to make this with my grandchildren someday.  Hint: replace water with coffee (my mom loved coffees and always had a cold pot sitting around) She also used coffee in the chocolate buttercream frosting we put on top (let the cake cool before you add frosting)

I have been making this cake for years.  It's what everyone expects from me for chocolate cake.  The favorite seems to be for me to bake the cake and while it's still hot sprinkle about a cup or so of semi sweet chocolate chips on it.  When they get soft I spread them around.   I also love it it with brown sugar icing or 7 minute icing.  But the chocolate chips always win with my family.

This is perhaps not the ultimate cake, but it is very, very good.  We substitute WHOLE WHEAT and RAW SUGAR for a healthier version of this, and it is very good that way, though we pull it out a little before it can 'pass' the toothpick test.  Be sure to crush all baking powder lumps!  We have found that sometimes the flour needs more moisture, but I can't tell when, so when we use whole wheat, we simply add a half to a whole extra cup of water, and given a tad extra time, it bakes down to the proper moisture without any trouble (otherwise, sometimes we have to add more water after the initial stirring, which leads to a more tough/dense cake).  Love this best with cherry pie filling and chocolate chip ice cream - on rare occasions we splurge that much.  Yummmm!

This is a fabulous recipe. No one could tell it's eggless.

However, i am wondering if it's strong enough to be stacked as 2-tier fondant cake?

This is SO good! Super moist but not soggy, not crumbly, SUPER easy to make and it didn't have one of those classic cake feeling of "oh my gosh this is so much sugar and chocolate I don't even want the whole piece." Really good, will use again.

I used to make this exact recipe as a child and it was always so much fun! I remember making up excuses to convince my parents to let me make another! So excited to find the recipe again after so many years. I intend to make it for my vegan friend sometime very soon!

Really easy and tasty! I've used both melted butter and melted coconut oil in place of the vegetable oil and they come out perfect. My husband can never wait for them to cool, but we still find they satisfy the sweet tooth warm. I have let them cool in the fridge and they became more dense. I scooped out some of the inside and stuffed with a peanut butter frosting. They tasted like snack cakes- a big hit!

I loved this cake! Dairy free, cheap to make, quick, and tastes great! I followed the recipe and added 1 cup of Ghirardelli mini-bittersweet chocolate chips to the batter. Also sifted all the dry ingredients before hand and mixed everything up in a big bowl. Keep an eye on the baking time so it doesn’t dry out. Was a bit hit in my office! Thanks for sharing!

This is the cake we call "Lazy Woman's Cake" at our house--because you don't have to wash a mixing bowl!  :)  Except I always do, because it's easier to wash the bowl than to mix cake batter in a shallow pan.  We love it with chocolate chips added.  Also, I have cut the amounts in 1/4 when I wanted a very small cake, and baked it in a bread pan.  This is a recipe to keep handy!

I LOVED this cake and that it doesn't use eggs or dairy. Some other readers didn't like this cake and said it has a weird odor, but I disagree. I did read through others' suggestions and added a 1/4 cup cocoa powder and mixed everything separately in a bowl. I also sprayed my pan with cooking spray. For my own taste, I substituted liquid stevia for half of the sugar used in this recipe. My husband and I both agreed that this is our new chocolate cake recipe!

My 9 year old made this for my birthday - I was a little nervous at the appearance when it came out of the oven, kind of like a lava cake interior, but it set and was very moist - even after sitting out all day.  The flavor was great - better than the store-bought cake someone else picked up, and truly easy.  We didn't have white vinegar and subbed apple cider vinegar, couldn't tell the difference.  Will make again, definitely!

I used my KA mixer because I made cupcakes out of them. I just made the 3 wells in there and it worked fine. The cupcakes took about 18 mins in my oven. These were delicious. VERY moist, almost like a brownie. I will definitely make these again.

This is the best and easiest chocolate cake ever! I love that there is no egg or milk, and since I was out of white sugar I subsituted it with brown sugar which gave it a slightly richer flavor. I have made this now  times, and it never fails to be a crowd pleaser. Thanks for sharing this simple and delicious recipe.

I made this for a friend who had a heart attack. It is the best cake ever. Very moist, and choclately. I made it into cupcakes,because I was taking them to the hospital for him. I baked the cupcakes for 15 minutes as suggested by another reviewer and they turned out perfect. They rose high. I know no one will be able to tell they have no eggs, in them. I just sprinkled with confectioners sugar instead of a frosting so there wouldn't added fat. Next time I make them I want to try to glaze them. I will make this recipe again.

I love this cake!  So moist and chocolatey!  You'd never know it was "modified" to exclude eggs etc.  Doesn't even need frosting - although it is delicious with a chocolate buttercream.

So excited to find this recipe. I've been making this cake from my mom's recipe for many years and was always curious about the directions, if it was just something she put in to make it "crazy". Not so! Low and behold, here it is. It is and always has been my favorite chocolate cake. So easy, rich, and moist! Enjoy!

I can't stop making this cake! When I first try a recipe, I follow it as directed. After that, if its worth keeping, I play around with it a bit. The last 2 times I made this, I added 1/2 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips and also a box of chocolate or devils food pudding and 1/3 c. extra water. I have layered this and used raspberry/cream cheese filling. And also Whipped cream cream cheese frosting on this site. Wonderful. My mother also has an egg allergy, so this is perfect! I have no reason to make any other chocolate cake! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

My vegan friends really like this because it is free of all animal products but still tastes awesome! Very light and fluffy. I like that it is not overly rich like other chocolate cakes.   The directions say to mix it all in an ungreased cake pan, but I did find that the cake stuck to the pan. The second time I made it I mixed it in a bowl and greased the cake pan and it did not stick that time.

We enjoyed this moist and easy to make cake.  Instead of using 2 cups of water, I used 2 cups of brewed coffee that was leftover from breakfast.  I'm still amazed that the recipe doesn't have eggs or milk and is so moist.  I will have to pass this on to my vegan friends who are always in search of eggless recipes.

Phenomenal! I mixed it all in a bowl and then made cupcakes. I found that about 15-16 minutes was just right for cupcakes...they were very light and moist. I got about 24 large cupcakes out of this recipe, but you could probably get more if you made them a bit smaller than I did.

This is exactly the recipe I grew up with and didn't even know there different chocolate cakes out there.  I had forgotten how delicious this cake is until I recently make it for someone's birthday.  I was reminded why this cake was, is, and always be my go-to recipe for chocolate cake.  The only difference between the one I've always made and this one is the name.  Mom called the cake "Whacky Chocolate Cake".  It's very possible her mother (who married in 1937) passed this recipe to her.

Overall this was super quick and tasty. I cut recipe in half, used strong coffee instead of water, added 2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 cup mini semiswt choc chips., cooked in 8" corningware dish for 35 min in middle of oven @ 350. pulled out of oven, poked holes throught out cake with back of wooden spoon, poured caramel topping(for icecream) in all the holes and across cake, set in refrig. to cool completely. Covered with whipped topping and served.  Very rich and tasty!

Easy, moist, and delicious.  First made this specifically to avoid eggs.  Later made a half recipe for a single round layer as a reward if grandchildren eat their vegetables.  It looked pretty dusted with powdered sugar.

I made this last year in the form of cupcakes. This recipe is great, easy and the cakes came out very moist and delicious. Very easy to make and a huge hit with my family.  Yummy!  5 stars!

This cake was great! I made it for my 1 year old birthday (he's allergic to eggs) and I thought that we would just suffer and eat the cake for him but it was FANTASTIC! This is the cake that I'm going to turn to for egg allergies or not! Everyone loved it!

I was pretty boring and the consistency was weird.  I could also plainly taste the baking soda.  I would only make this again if I was making it for a vegan or someone with severe allergies.  A little cream cheese icing did perk it up a bit.  I also think that a handful of chocolate chips might help it out, too.

I made this cake yesterday to bring to a dinner party, and everyone loved it and couldn't believe that there was no eggs or butter in it. It was really easy to make and tasted very good, I frosted it with cream cheese frosting. It was really good!!

I didn't like this at all, you could taste the baking soda.  After all the raves I thought it would be great, but it was AWFUL!  My fiance said it just needed icing, not even icing would have made it taste better.  :-(  I am just glad I found out before I made it for my daughter's birthday on Thursday!

This cake is good for when you're out of butter and eggs, but don't use it as a substitute for normal cake if you can avoid it. It was good, but something about it was a little off.

this cake is a winner.  evryone I have made it for loves it .  We changed nothing! It is perfect.  as soon as I take it out of oven, I poke holes in it all around, and then place a first coat of icing(we use the frosting on the cocoa box-yum!!),and then cover for about 5-10 min to let the icing soak in a little.  We then finish putting on the frosting, and serve warm .  it is also a great dessert to serve warm, top with vanilla ice cream, and drizzle the same frosting that has been heated up on top.  it is my go to recipe. easy to whip up.  I do reccommend mixing up dry ingredients very well in the pan before making holes and adding wet ingredients. and then mix well with wooden spoon.  so easy, no mixer needed, and only 1 pan for everything.

I have eaten this cake since I was 4 yrs. old and love the tenderness and richness of this cake.  My parents adopted me and on my first birthday with them my new Mom made this cake with just a simple white buttercream.  It's also great with a frosting made of powdered sugar, butter and lemon or orange juice and of course a little zest from the citrus...delish!!!

My mother taught me how to make this cake when I was about 10 years old. It has been a favorite of mine for the last 55 years. We used a home-made white marshmellow icing on it and it was to die for. A big slice and a glass of cold milk were the thing.

What a SUPER, SUPER easy cake to make & I had all the ingred. in my kitchen.  Unfortunally I didn't get to try it, since the cake plate came back empty!  I was told it was good, but, not great---however, for a quick homemade cake in a pinch--this is it!

I really like the way the cake looks. I made cupcakes and one small cake with this recipe. I tasted one cupcake, and it seemed like it could have been a little sweeter. Maybe with the frosting it would be perfect.

So glad to find this recipe!  My mom used to make this when we were kids, but I'd lost her recipe.

The only thing I changed in the recipe was the amount of oil.  I try to keep things healthy in our house, so I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce + 1/4 oil for the 3/4 cup of oil.  Still turned out perfectly moist AND I was able to pop the cake out of the pan without much cake tearing away.  

I made the cake in a round pan for my daughter's 10th birthday party and the girls all loved it!

Very good recipe! I used a bit less sugar and added some semisweet chocolate bits and the cake came out moist and dense. However, I think it's best the second day. I tasted it warm yesterday and it tasted quite oily and bland, but today it's just terrific and my boyfriend can't stop eating it! I'll definitely make this cake again!

Thank you Amy!  This recipe is wonderful as is :)  My daughter is severely allergic to milk and eggs and I used this recipe for her 1st Birthday Cake.  It was so yummy even without icing...which to me is the true test of a good cake.  Will absolutely make this again!

Wow!  This was not the BEST cake I've had, but it was surprisingly tasty considering the ease of preparation and the readily available ingredients.  The cake was quite sturdy and perfect for a time when you GOTTA have chocolate cake or you need a quickie for some kind of function.  I used the frosting recipe from the back of the Hershey's cocoa container.  I'm sooo glad I tried this one.  THANX!

This cake is very good and I was making for my friends that are allergic to eggs. I would have given this 5 stars but couldn't quite do it because for me 5 stars is perfect and this was almost there but not quite my reason is because I had to keep baking it and it was still raw not a huge fan of cakes without eggs but still great!

I made it EXACTLY as written and I couldn’t have been happier. In all honesty, I picked this recipe because I was out of milk and although I was skeptical, i really didn’t want to run to the store. Like I mentioned, exactly as written with a 9x13 pan. No grease, dry ingredients sifted into pan, etc. At exactly 40 minutes, it was beautiful and fluffy and needed no extra time in the oven. I took this cake for my daughters birthday dinner and almost everyone got second pieces.

Made this for the first time today, cut it in half to make an 8” cake. Was very surprised it was Wonderful!! Wasn’t sure how it would turn out or taste with no eggs or baking powder. Will add it to my most loved recipes.

Favorite from my childhood.  Used a boiled chocolate frosting on it.  Had a distinct flavor and is very moist.

My mother in law gave me this recipe 40 years ago! It makes an amazingly moist, fudgy cake that everyone loves. If you're a real chocoholic try a fudge frosting on it. You really don't even need frosting, but I love it with plain old vanilla. My children are grown with their own children now. I can't wait to share this recipe with my grandchildren!

I've made this cake ever since I was a child, in the 70's, I love this cake! Up here in Minnesota we call it wacky cake and it had wacky frosting with it. I've lost the frosting recipe my mom used to make and can't find her's either. It's just not the same without it. So if anyone has that recipe, I would love a copy.

This was my mother's "go to" cake recipe when I was a girl growing up in the late 50's early 60's.  She and her sister made it often and they called it "Funny Cake".  What sweet memories this conjured up for me. :-)

I was very impressed with this recipe. My granddaughter has an egg allergy and loves chocolate so I wanted to make her a birthday cake that she could actually eat. It was a huge success. My husband that he never had a cake is moist as that one. The crazy thing is I already had a similar crazy cake recipe that had been given to me at my bridal shower from my aunt. Never tried it forgot about it until I got this recipe. I also found that you can mix it in a bowl and pour it into the pans. So if you want to make a two layer cake you can still do it. I say give this recipe a try and keep it in your recipe box you won't be disappointed

Super easy cake.  Smelled delicious while baking!  DH ate two pieces as soon as it was frosted and raved about it. Watch it carefully, though!  I overbaked mine slightly and it was a bit tough at the edges. Frosted with Basic Chocolate Buttercream from this site. It was equally yummy!  Thank you for sharing.

This is a wonderful, not so sweet, chocolate cake.  Might be a change for most, but this is a must-have dessert in our house.  where I cut the sugar amount in most recipes,  I don't have to in this one.  Super decadent with just a light dusting of powdered sugar--no frosting required.

When I make chocolate cake, I use this recipe. I sometimes add chocolate chips and switch out 1 cup of the water for cold coffee (to deepen the chocolate flavor). Best recipe for chocolate cake that I’ve ever made! The family loves it.

Yes!  This is the one to make!  My mother used to make this for my birthday cake every year, and everyone loved it.  Don't let the lack of eggs and butter scare you off from trying this... it is wonderful.  Do not over-mix the cake, but be sure that it is fully combined.  Excellent cake!  Try it.

I made this cake mostly out of curiosity (and because I was too lazy to go to the store to buy eggs.) Can cake be made with out eggs? Short answer: Yes. Long answer: the product of this recipe is indistinguishable from normal cake, until you put it in your mouth, at which point you will notice differences in taste and texture.  No, it does not noticeably taste like vinegar or baking soda, and yes, it does taste like chocolate cake, but it's not a super delicious chocolate cake.  It did improve after the cake had completely cooled--when warm the strange mouth-coating texture was more pronounced. Long story short, if you're vegan, or allergic to eggs, go for it. If not, just go buy some eggs.

Perfect recipe for my little one who has an egg allergy.  My husband and I love it too.  To make cupcakes, I filled each liner 3/4 full and baked at 350 degrees for 22 minutes.  The recipe made 30 cupcakes.

I make a couple of different changes to the recipe.  I use cold coffee instead of water for the liquid.  Also sprinkle the top liberally with cinnamon and sugar before putting it in the oven.  The top will end up crisp.  Making these two changes led to a Blue Ribbon at our county fair.

I absolutely loved this recipe. Personally, coming from a vegetarian perspective, this was one of the best chocolate cakes ever. Like most people, I (at first) worried that the vinegar would make the cake taste sour but when I tasted the batter I was surprised by the rich flavor. I would rate this ten stars if I could! I am famous for this recipe and get asked to make it all the time. Overall, I would recommend this to all chocolate cake lovers out there. I like to serve it with icing sugar on top. When you put frosting on it, it still tastes good but doesn't have the same luxurious taste that it does with icing sugar.

this is my go to recipe for an eggless chocolate cake.Easy to make and tastes great on its own as well.Have made this many times and it has never failed me.I always add 1 tspn of instant coffee powder to bring out the chocolate flavour.Also,adding chocolate chips to it is great.U cant taste the vinegar at all in the cake.In fact,my friends were surprised when I told them this was an eggless cake.

My great grandmother made Crazy Cake often. She raised a family in the great depression and it never occurred to me that she made this cake because eggs were hard to come by at that time. So happy to find this recipe.  My family loves it.

I have made this cake many times and we love it! I use cold coffee instead of the water but that is the only change I make. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

My original version of this recipe called for ice water and was ver surprised when a friend I shared it with called to ask if she should remove the ice cubes before baking! This cake has always been a favorite and am making it for a birthday today.

Wonderful recipe. This recipe will always give you a reliably good chocolate cake. There are more moist cake recipes out there, which I tend to prefer. However I enjoy making this cake when I don't have the ingredients on hand for those other recipes, and especially when I am making a cake for others who may not eat dairy and/or eggs. It's a quick cheap yummy cake - thanks for posting!

Wow! perfect for little helping hands. My 21 month old loved to mix and taste the batter. We made this for a little girl who has allergies.  Dairy free, egg free, people!  it is sweet. you could probably cut back a little on the sugar and add extra cocoa powder to make it more flavorful. It is a beautiful dark cake with red tint!

Delicious and simple to make.  I was a little worried that the batter was so runny when I was done mixing, but baked as directed with no problems.   The cake is moist and spongy.  It paired wonderfully with peanut butter frosting.   I can't wait to try it with ganache!

Delicious! Baked this for a customer whose child is allergic to eggs. No one could believe it because it was so good! I divided into two 8x8s so I could stack it. It's not a very firm cake, but I made it work!

Very simple and easy to make. I used coconut oil and didn't put vinegar (didn't have any). The cake turned out beautifully! One review says it is too sweet, but really its alright. I also added a pinch of raisnins that gave additional melty feeling, chocolate chip will do too.

Man,  I wish I'd made this cake for my wedding instead of the bakery one we did!  One of the best,  easiest, most wonderfully moist chocolate cakes I've ever had.  Even the strange preparation of mixing it in the pan... Easy. Only change was before baking,  I added some chocolate chips.  Amazing.  My go-to cake from now on!

I have now made this twice, and both times it was delicious and very moist.  Lots of compliments, stacked well.
Edit: now my go-to cake because it just always works!  Always make it with coffee instead of water, and topped with chocolate sour cream frosting for a nice big of tang.

This is the families all time favorite cake ever. I follow the recipe but sometimes I will add 1/2 tsp almond flavor along with the vanilla (try it u will love it). Also, I frost with a fudge frosting that is awesome (I also add a little almond flavor to the frosting too)

My mom (who grew up during the Depression) made this all the time when I was a child in the 1950s and 1960s. She made a smaller version (same ingredients) that she baked in an 8-inch square pan.  We called it "Funny Cake." It's definitely a winner--and great for those with egg or dairy allergies.

The cake is VERY moist! The vegetable oil makes it super soft to the touch, though it nice, next time I might reduce the oil to 1/2 cup or 2/3 cup instead. It's hardly sweet, so it's okay to eat a big piece ;-). I made a white chocolate topping (though not perfect because I poured it very hot), it was still good. Topping recipe (1 cup (chocolate) chips (I used white), 1/4 cup evaporated milk, 2 tablespoons of butter, now melt in microwave. Once combined, add 1cup of powered sugar, mix well till incorporated, let cool off a little bit, then spread before it thickens too much. Enjoy!) I added red food coloring to one with sprinkles and other just pecans on top.  I made this cake twice, I followed a reviewers advise to add strawberry jello and strawberries (chopped or puréed) and  that was the biggest mistake ever!!! Leave the recipe as is, please, unless u like mushy-baby-food-like-cake, yuck, I can chew thank you. Anyway, beware it doesn't work. I was going to post a pick of it in the trash but decided against it. This recipe is easy and quick as is, especially when you run out if eggs & milk at home, but want dessert.

I cant believe how good this cake is. I didnt have eggs in the fridge so I looked up egg free desserts and this came up. The only thing I did differently was to mix it in a bowl (I still made the wells in the dry ingredients) and I baked it in two round pans. I used strawberry jam to hold thr two layers together and we ate it with ice cream.

This was fantastic! I followed the directions exactly and what I ended up with will make you slap yo' mama. I made a vanilla butter cream frosting to go with it and tried very hard to wait for my kids to get home from school before trying it, but to no avail. I caved when it was still piping hot. 

Buttercream frosting: 1/3 cup margarine, 2 tsp real vanilla extract, 2.5 C powdered sugar, 2 tb sweetened condensed milk. Beat the margarine (yes margarine, not butter) and sugar til creamy, add the rest and beat for a min. YUM. 

Thanks for this recipe. It's a keeper.

Best chocolate cake I've ever made! It's very easy to make and clean up is simple. The first time I made it I cut it up in small squares and used it in a trifle with homemade vanilla pudding, and dark sweet cherries! It was delicious! Going to make it again!

This recipe was amazing. Very very very moist. I didn't know a cake could be this moist. I also tweaked to by adding a cream cheese filling inside the batter marbled mixed. The chocolate flavor was very dark. Just how I like it!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!! I made this for Thanksgiving, and the cake was gone in an hour! I did make a couple of changes, but only because of a lack of ingredients or extras laying around. Instead of using white sugar, I used light brown sugar (same amount). And since I didn't have any vinegar on hand, I found that four tablespoons of orange juice will suffice. And last but not least, I added a big handful of chocolate chips to the batter, and was finding little gooey bits in the cake the whole time I ate it :). The batter is thick, almost like you're making brownies. Don't bother too much about the wells, it's alright if something overflows. I used a 9x13 pan (don't forget to grease and flour it lightly). Don't worry about it being thin either, the finished product has a nice thickness to it! For me, I could see the cake was done when the top started cracking a bit. Remember, if using the toothpick test, you don't want the cake to be stone dry. This cake needs no frosting; it can be eaten on its own. But for presentation's sake, I dusted it with powdered sugar after giving up on trying to make butter-less frosting. If you break a little bit of the cracked top off the top of the cake after it comes out of the oven, it tastes just like a chocolate poptart. The cake was thick, and gooey, and delicious. Hope I helped. :) Enjoy!

This is the most versatile cake recipe in the world.  I use it for every kind of cake.  I'm writing this review waiting for apple cinnamon cupcakes made using this base (minus the cocoa).  Try subbing 3/4 cup of brown sugar for 1 cup of the white, 1 cup of sweet apple cider for 1 cup of the water, adding 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp each ground ginger and clove and 3/4 cup dried currants.  Fill the muffin cup (lined) halfway, add a tsp of apple pie filling, then put a tbsp of batter on top.  Bake at 350 until they're done (I time nothing, lol).

I have been making this cake since I was a child - my grandma helped me the first time, a great memory for me.  I love to substitute cold coffee for the water - wonderful flavor enhancer - try it! VERY moist cake, we usually do not frost this as it is so moist.

Not only is it my favorite chocolate cake, it's incredibly simple AND vegan! I can't give it enough stars. The only modification I ever do is sometimes I add chocolate morsels, but the cake is really great even without that.

Wow!  I made this two days in a row.  First I made one as a bunt cake for a potluck (dusted with powdered sugar).  The next day I made it as a half sheet cake for a birthday party.  Everyone was amazed when I told them it was vegan.

Had friends over last night and needed a good easy desert.  We all really enjoyed this...very good & very easy.  I put peanut butter chips in at the last minute on a whim and it was great.  Followed the recipe except I decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and I never use oil, but applesauce instead.  Thanks!!

Nice and moist like most vegan baked goods are. Super easy too, my 7yo made it with only some help from me (mostly the oven). Doesn't need frosting. It's kinda like a cake brownie.

I am very thankful to have this recipe because I was able to make cupcakes in a way that all of the food allergies in our family were taken care of.  It is still very sticky, but here is what I did that may help others.

**note: I needed it to be dairy, soy, gluten, egg, and nut free.

I used gluten free flour (a blend that works nicely in baked goods), I used applesauce in place of the oil, and I added allergy-free chocolate chips.  They have a very good flavor.  They are very moist.

Since I did cupcakes, the sticking was the big issue.  The first batch stuck really bad to the papers, making them difficult to eat.  So I ditched the papers and used olive oil on a paper town to greese the wells thoroughly.  They slid right out!  I then placed them each in a paper for presentation and ease of serving.

1st time I ever made a chocolate cake from scratch, was very easy and came out very moist and nice. I did add choc and butterscotch chips, so reduced the sugar just a bit and subsituted the water with coffee. will definately be making again, will also be trying the white vrsin with white choc chips.

I have been using this recipe for years. You can also substitute the oil for applesauce for a denser sweeter cake.

Modified it to make it a real dark-choc treat:
Upped cocoa powder so that it was about 1/2 the amount of sugar. I also reduced the amount of flour a smidge to make up for the dryness of the cocoa.
Finally, I used strong coffee to highlight the choc flavour instead of water. I mixed it all with an electric mixer to make everything easier. Yummy.

I never stop to take the time to review any of the recipes, I really should I have found many wonderful recipes on here, with that said, I HAD to write and review this one. This is by far the BEST chocolate cake I have ever made. Can not believe there is no dairy in it. It is better then any of the cakes I have made with dairy. I will be using this as my chocolate cake recipe from now on. OH not to mention it is so easy to make. Thanks for posting!

Came out pretty good without the use of eggs! However, I used a wheat flour which may have altered the taste a bit. I still enjoyed it along with a homemade cream cheese frosting.

I am very surprised a cake without eggs would turn out so good.  Was also amazed how easily it came out of pan without greasing it.  Moist and tasty.

Love this cake, I make this for my son that is allergic to egg and dairy.  I've used half whole wheat flour, brown sugar instead of white, and sometimes use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  Doesn't seem to matter what I do this cake comes out perfect.

this is the recipe I use every.single.time I bake a cake from scratch. I love it. It is kind of dense, but not heavy. Not like those super fluffy cakes that makes you want to eat 15 pieces of to satisfy your craving for chocolate cake.
Thank you so much for the recipe! 

I would like to add something very important about this recipe: I would suggest letting it sit for a day to rest before you eat it. it is MUCH better on day 2 or 3. 

I make it as the recipe calls for to the "T", most of the time. sometimes I use whole wheat flour, and sometimes I use applesauce instead of oil, and I am never disappointed.

I chose this cake for cupcakes for my daughter's birthday to bring into her classroom where there is a dairy allergy.

I made this recipe with two changes: 1: I added 1 tablespoon of vanilla vs. 2 teaspoons and substituted 1/2 a cup of chocolate soy milk for 1/2 cup of water.

We sent these in as cupcakes (which took an even 20 minutes to bake) without frosting and the kids just loved them.

My daughter loved the flavor so much that she asked me to make her birthday cake this morning from this recipe, which I am doing now.

For a dairy free, delicious cake, this *is* a winner.

This cake was amazing. It held its shape well, was dense and while not moist, not terrible dry either. It lacked a good chocolately flavor, but I rolled out a can of almond paste and topped it all with tart cherry spread. Heaven. Pure, simple heaven. Will continue making this for all my cake needs.

This recipe has been around for decades, for good reason - it is cheap and easy to make and absolutely delicous!  My mother made it year round, but at Christmas instead of frosting it she served it with real whipped cream flavored with kirsch, chopped nuts and cherries.  This recipe is one everyone cook should have in their arsenal.

This recipe has been around for generations, known as Whacky Cake.  My grandmother made it back during the depression, when eggs were prohibitively expensive. It was a favorite of y family's and my children, for birthday cakes. Still a family favorite!

Made this for a football party & everyone loved it. I made mine in a bowl & poured it into a greased pan. Made a cooked chocolate frosting & poured it over while cake & frosting both were still warm. It is heavier/different than the average cake & very moist. This is a keeper, thank you very much. Highly recommend you try this for something different.

Awesome cake, and since there are no eggs, you can taste the batter.  I know this as Wacky Chocolate Cake and have been making it for years.  I usually use half the ingredients and bake it in an 8 X 8 square pyrex pan for about 30 minutes.  I sometimes sprinkle a little powdered sugar on top instead of frosting it.

The best chocolate cake I've ever made from scratch. My husband is really picky, and rarely eats sweets, but he loved this cake. You can't tell that there's no egg or milk, and the chocolate flavor is perfect. I made this while waiting for Irene to hit us and it made for a nice treat during the days after when we were without power and bored. I made a chocolate glaze to ice it with and it was divine!

I made this for a friend who is watching his cholesterol. It was wonderful. I added about 1/2 cup or more of mini choc chips. When warm it is especially good.  I frosted one half with store bakery icing and the rest with a coconut extract flavored version of the supermarket bakery frosting.  It was GREAT with the coconut flavor. I will make this again. It tasted just slightly different then a cake mix and will be a great sub. when I don't have a cake mix around.  My friend is going to adore the fact that I was able to make him something with no eggs.  I made this in a bowl but still used the 3 well method and make mini cupcakes and standard cupcakes with it. I got 48 mini's and 14 standard from this size batch.

I was looking for a recipe that didn't have shortening in the ingredients (cause transfat is horrible for your heart) and this recipe is AMAZING!! I made them into cupcakes and since it made so many I gave a bunch to some family :) They are really moist and delicious! This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

This was such an amazing chocolatey moist delish cake!  I made it for my son's birthday because one of our guests has an egg allergy.  No one could tell that it was eggless, it was a HUGE hit!

My mom used to make this when I was little. I wanted to make this into a double layer cake, but I knew that the preparation of this cake was important for the finished product. So essentially I made two cakes in two cake pans. It came out wonderful!

I was surprised that this cake came out so well, very tasty but just a bit too dense for me.   This is a great recipe if you are out of eggs or cant eat them.  I put a chocolate coffee butter cream on top made it even more yummy.  Would make again.

I just made this and it turned out Really tasty.  I even messed it up and I think it made it better too :-)
I forgot to add the sugar and didn't realize this mistake until after I had put it in the pan (I licked the spoon and it didn't taste sweet at all).  So I put about a cup powdered sugar on top then folded it in, though not too thoroughly because I didn't want to over mix the batter.  The end result it yummy.

This recipe has been in our family for many, many years.  I have found using apple cider vinegar and hershey's cocoa powder make it super moist.  It is also more moist the second day.  (I make it late in the day and that way there is some left over for day two!)

I have been making this for several years now because my daughter developed an egg allergy.  Comes out perfectly every time and is very easy.  I use a combination of dutch-process cocoa and black cocoa(both from king arthur) and it makes a very dark, decedent cake.

Wonderful, moist chcolate cake!  My family didn't think that a cake with vinegar in it could be good, but, boy were they wrong.  They loved this cake!  One note- Make the well for the oil large, the one for the vinegar medium and the one for the vanilla small.

Excellent, especially for our dairy- and egg-allergic son!  Everyone loves it.  We use 1 c white and 1 c brown sugar, and 2 c vanilla soymilk instead of the vanilla and water.  Sometimes, just for added yummy guilt, we add non-dairy chocolate chips to the batter.  Our favorite is to make it in a Bundt pan and glaze with a simple vanilla soymilk/powdered sugar icing.

Five stars for a chocolate cake without eggs or milk in it.  Its not going to be exactly like more traditional chocolate cakes but it is a great cake for those who can't have eggs.  I made this exactly as written and I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks for the recipe!

This makes an incredibly moist, soft cake. I'm only giving it 3 starts though because it does have a weird taste to it. Not bad, just not rich, decadent chocolate cake. Also, it was hard to frost, the edges kept crumbling off. Considering it's a vegan cake though, not too bad.

This was okay. I made this because I didn't have any eggs on hand and followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding chocolate chunks to the batter. I sliced and drizzled with hot fudge and sprinkled with powdered sugar to mask the oily flavor that I think took over. Very moist though- probably due to all the oil.

There was something wrong with the texture. I used a bowl instead of the pan, but otherwise followed the directions. When it came out of the oven, the top and edges had crisped but the insides were still undone. It was also a strange reddish color, which might have been the fault of the Hershey's semisweet cocoa I used. I might try this again - but with dutch processed cocoa and some baking powder instead of baking soda. Clean-up was definitely a breeze, though!

My first thought when I saw the recipe was how would it turn out with no eggs? But it was yummy. The only change I made was to only make 1/2 the recipe which is something I do often. I got a perfect cake from an 8" round pan. I mixed everything in a bowl first until just combined then transferred to the oiled pan. I put ganache on it which was a mistake. The cake itself is good. Maybe my tooth just isn't sweet enough for the ganache.

I grew up on this cake, and it is by far one of my favorites. I'm so glad to have found it here! Definitely don't be afraid of the vinegar. You cannot taste it. It's very moist and chocolately. BUT, I definitely let it cool completely before serving. As one reviewer mentioned, the flavor isn't as good straight out of the oven.

i would like to thank amy for sharing this recipe. i remember making this back in the late 50,s. it was published in a kid's  cookbook. it was the first cake i made by myself. since i no longer have the cookbook i no longer have the recipe and was happy to see someone did. i started making  this when i was nine years old.  it's fun to make and great for young bakers.

This was incredible! This is the first chocolate I've ever made, and it was such a success, and this is without any frosting. Will definitely make this again and again. I will try variations next time, by adding coffee or cinnamon, or making this into an orange cake. Thanks for sharing this with us.

I have made this cake for many years for our family's Thanksgiving meal. It's known in our family as a Wacky Cake. I spread a jar of marshmallow cream over the top of the out-of-the-oven cake then when it is totally cool, add a semi-melted in the oven can of fudgy frosting...my hubby thinks it's terrific.

I've been making this cake for 25 years and it is always the bomb! Frosted or unfrosted, this cake is a hit every time.  It's awesome served with a little whipped topped on the side if you don't like frosting.  It's a moist, rich and heavy cake sure to satisfy any chocolate craving.   When we make this, we make the three wells and split all the ingredients over all three wells and then pour the vinegar into each well before we add the water and watch the "volcanoes" start to erupt before adding the water.  Fun recipe to make with kids.

My kids LOVED it! I made it for my birthday and now they all want it for their birthdays! My youngest has multiple food allergies and we are thrilled that he can have something that is "normal". Really rich and very moist. I think I'll add a cherry topping next time!

this cake is AWESOME! i baked it for 30 minutes and it came out moist and just perfect! i am so pleased. i also like that it doesn't require eggs or butter, so that cuts out a bit of the fat. i also paired it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze i found on Allrecipes. what a fantastic combination!

This is it!  I have made lots of homemade cakes, but this is THE best one I have ever made!  I followed the recipe as written and found the end result to be perfect.  I'm still looking for a really good frosting recipe, but until then the store bought goes just fine.  Thanks for posting a fantastic recipe!

Moist, delicious chocolate cake. Made this for my daughters bday cake. I added 1/2 tsp instant coffee & about 1/3 c. choc chips as per other reviewers. I also sifted as stated & i added the wet ingred. to the dry & mixed well before placing in a grease/floured glass pan. I will def. make this again. Its better than a box recipe without all the extra chemicals & ingredients that we don't need.

I am an avid baker and decided to make this cake for two reasons: #1 I didn't have any eggs and #2 There is a salmonella issue with the eggs. But, this cake was okay, not great! It had a strange texture and a weird aftertaste. Probably something I will not make again. The only thing that made them somewhat pleasant was the Milky Way Frosting I put on them. Sorry for the review, but I had to be honest.

This was truly a moist cake! I loved that I could put all the ingredients right into the baking pan, reducing my dishwashing time. The only problem with mixing everything in one dish was that some of my ingredients didn't mix well, therefore, some pieces of the cake had a distinct baking powder taste, which is the least bit appetizing!

I wanted to make 1 dozen cupcakes, so changed the yield to 12 servings...ended up with 12 regular cupcakes and 10 mini cupcakes.  I think next time I would change it to 9 servings from the orignal 18.  Also added 1C mini chocolate chips to the batter.  Baked regular cupcakes for 20 minutes and they were perfectly done.  Tops didn't sink at all and they had a great rich choclate flavor, and were EASY!

This will be my go-to cake of any flavor from now on. Good chocolate flavor, wonderful moist texture. I halved everything and made it in a 9x9 pan to take to my Grandparents who are in their 90s and served with coolwhip, and it was a huge hit! Added a dash of baking spice and will maybe use coffee in place of water next time. I'm not a cake fan, but I love THIS cake.

This was a big hit in my family and at the office!!  I made the cake for my husbands birthday...it reminded me of a cake his grandma used to make, but by the time I asked her for the recipe, her memory wasn't what it used to be.  Followed the directions exactly!!  Turned out very moist!!

I did not care for this recipe. I couldn't get a hold of my mom for my grandma's recipe, so I used this instead. Batter seemed to taste fine, and the texture was good, but it tasted like chalk. What a disappointment, not even close to the real thing, and no her recipe didn't use eggs either.  Also, how is everyone on this site "expert" level? I thought you either had to be a chef by trade or grandma to earn that title. :)

This is be the simplest, best chocolate cake recipe ever. I've made this cake several times with and without adjustments. Here are some tips: usually I only use 1 cup sugar (otherwise the cake is too sweet when frosted), instead of just using all-purpose flour I used 1 cup whole wheat, 1 c whole rye flour and 1 cup white flour (much healthier but you won't notice the difference in taste), and sometimes I add rum extract instead of vanilla or dissolve a teaspoon of instant coffee in one of the cups of water. Also, 2/3 cup oil is enough. Why add more when it's not necessary? I mix the ingredrients in a bowl instead of the pan, and grease/flour my pan before pouring in the dough. That way the cake is easy to remove from the pan after baking. Turns out super every time!

The best vegan cake I've found yet. I don't eat vegan, but I friends who do, and I find myself wracking my brains trying to find desserts that don't have eggs and butter in them. This is it! Once you turn it out of the pan, I recommend covering it with plastic wrap or foil while it still warm. It moistens it up and melds the flavors really nicely. It can be a little dry if you leave it uncovered to cool. I think this is because of the lack of eggs as the binding agent to help hold the moisture in. Fantastic! Finally a vegan dessert that meat-atarians will eat too!

I grew up on this cake, my mother is not the best cook and she always made it fun for me. I got to make the 3 holes to put the rest of the ingredients in, then mix it. As a kid that is something you never forget. I have read some reviews on how others said it turned out dry, this has to be one of the most moist and fluffy cakes I have ever tasted. You have to make the 3 holes in the pan, my guess is they did something different. Anyways for others that say it has no flavor, well it has a ton of flavor, but our little secret is we add just a pinch of cinnamon to the recipe. I would say no more then just a teaspoon. I had to write a review just because this will always be my favorite cake. :)

Easy to make, and the flavor of the vinegar really does not come through.  Mine came out a bit dry though so I had to do a simple berry glaze to moisten it back up.

My goodness!  I wanted to make something chocolaty but didn't have eggs or butter and was short on milk as well. I typed in the ingredients I wanted to use and this cake came up.  I used coconut oil since I was low on vegetable oil.  The cake was amazing.  So moist and delicious.  Plus it only required mixing everything in the pan so, very few dirt dishes.  My husband and the kids love it, even my youngest son who normally only eats the frosting ate this up.  Thanks for this great recipe.

My 2 year old has severe egg allergies but I still felt strongly about having a birthday cake for his party tomorrow.  I have not even frosted the cake and I am writing a review already!  Along with one round cake pan, I used a cupcake pan for the little kids to much on.  I just tried a cupcake and I am so blown away by the taste and texture!  As an added bonus, it is incredibly easy to make.  I love that it isn't overly chocolatey and is so moist.  Nobody will ever be able to tell that the cake is eggless.  I am about to make "One Bowl Buttercream Icing" from this site to go with it.  Thanks Amy Parsons!

I almost never leave reviews, but I had to make an exception in this case.  My son is allergic to dairy and eggs and I've spent 7 years looking for a cake recipe that can be served to people who actually know what a real cake should taste like.  This recipe is not only easy, but it is honestly just about the best chocolate cake I've had.  Moist and fluffy, not too sweet or fudgy... and it holds together like no other dairy-free/egg-free cake I've tried... even the expensive boxed brands made specifically for allergies.  This recipe makes twice the amount of a cake mix.  I mixed it in a separate bowl (I can't imagine mixing in the baking pan would yield great results) and baked in two round pans for a dual layer cake.  I can't wait to try this recipe with other flavors!

Yikes.  I'm very disappointed after reading all the rave reviews.  I decide to bake this on a whim because it looked easy and I had all the ingredients on hand.  The batter tasted fine, but it came out very dry (and I tend to underbake a tad for moistness) and very bland.

Texture is perfect, but flavor leaves something to be desired. It needs more cocoa powder and sugar, then it would probably be perfect. I left out the vinegar because I figured it was the cause of the funny aftertaste some reviewers were complaining about.

This turned out wonderfully! Stays moist for quite a few days. I paired it with the "pudding frosting" from this site and it was chocolaty without being overly sweet.

Neat recipe!  Made as directed.  I enjoyed the fact that it wasn't overly-sweet, and when dusted with powdered sugar this was just what I wanted.

This is the second time I have made this cake and it is my new favorite! For the first one I used margarine instead of vegetable oil because I didn't have any. This time I used applesauce instead and it is so good! Both are perfect substitutes! Thank you so much for sharing this AWESOME recipe!!!

This recipe is pretty easy to make, but I didn't care too much for its taste. My husband, who loves all things chocolate, said that it was okay, but nothing special.  The only change that I made to the recipe was to add some semi-sweet chocolate chips to the top of the cake after it had set up a little bit.  I made this addition because I didn't want to make frosting for the cake.  One note - it did taste a little better the next day after sitting.

Simple and delicious. Topped with a chocolate buttercream. I made the cake in the single pan and couldn't get it out of the pan in one piece, so I will probably throw this into my mixer so I can grease my pan. I didn't try it with coffee instead of water but I think I will next time. Also I realized part-way through making it that it's a vegan recipe, and that's kind of nifty that going vegan for dessert saved money during the Depression era! UPDATE - I learned that these are great mini cupcakes, between 7-8 doz yield. I baked them for maybe 20mins, but that varies. I topped them with vegan icing (shortening + water + confectioners' sugar) so I can share them with most all of my friends. They're so perfect as minis.

Very, very good, especially considering all the things that AREN'T in it!  I think my pan was a big smaller, so even strictly following the baking time/temp, I ended up with an almost "fudgy" layer on temp - probably not intended in the recipe, but it tasted great anyhow!  Used a soft spread/peanut butter/powdered sugar frosting

Nice one ;) The ingredients seemed a little weird to me at first but I still went ahead with them and it ended up great! I'm impressed, so is my family. Thanks for the recipe, other than adding a little bit more cocoa powder, I didn't change a thing. It's good with cream cheese frosting too!

One of my favorites. This is a recipe I grew up with and truly one of the few chocolate cakes I actually like. I seldom frost it, this cake doesn't really need it. Moist with just the right amt. of sweetness. Thanks for sharing.

This is the same recipe I have made for several years now, with the sole exception of using vegetable shortening rather than the veg oil this calls for. If you want to punch up the flavor without traditional buttercream frosting, make a glaze from OJ concentrate, and powdered sugar. Also, I find it makes better cupcakes due to a tendency for the middle to not quite set in a full size cake. No doubt because of the lack of eggs. Killer recipe!

This recipe has been popular in my family since I was a little kid (over 30 years).  So moist, and so yummy.  I don't make any other chocolate cake.  Nine times out of ten I don't even bother to frost it, it doesn't last long enough:-)

I made this cake just because it sounded good and it IS good!! I know this really defeats the whole purpose of not using eggs but I topped with my seven minute frosting. Everyone LOVED it!! One person even wanted me to make this for their birthday cake.

I really liked this recipe, although I was skeptical at first!  I was making dessert for a dinner where vegans would be eating.  I have made my standard chocolate cake using egg substitute before, which didn't turn out very well.  this was great!  Moist, light, very delicious!  I pretty much followed the recipe, but i used cake flour, and added little more cocoa(per other people's suggestion.)  I may even make this when i'm not baking for vegans!  I also used peanut butter frosting (from cook's illustrated) delicious!!!

My cake baking skills are so-so, honestly, and I only had one nine inch round pan and some bakeable bowls at my disposal. My oven bakes hot, my air is humid. Makes life difficult, but this cake came through! It is tasty without being overly sweet, and it's a -gorgeous- colour of deep dark chocolate brown. This will be the recipe I use from now on!

UNBELIEVABLE !!!  It tastes like a Hostess Cupcake !!!  Our kids are allergic to dairy and eggs so this ?  Is fantastic.   BTW I beat it with my mixer.  It comes out fine like that.

This so good. I brought it over to a dinner party and they loved it. We did not even need milk to eat this cake. It was so moist and great. I sprinkled a little powder sugar on top to make it look pretty.

I mixed this in my mixer then poured into two round cake pans instead of a 13x9.  It made a nice looking layer cake.  As for taste, I liked it and my husband didn't.  The difference is I had to give up dairy and soy so the recipe gave me the chance to have chocolate cake.  If you are looking for a fudgey chocolate cake (like my husband expected) and can have typical cake ingredients this is not the recipe for you.  However, if you are like me and have to take what you can get this recipe works.  My suggestion would be to wait to eat it because it tasted better a few days later.  It is a moist cake and the recipe is easy to follow or modify if you would like.  If these are the ingredients you need to work with this recipe is worth a try.

Interesting...I picked this recipe because I had everything on hand and liked the fact it didn't have eggs. It was moist and came out great.

Awesome cake!  We tried this when my daughter ate the last 2 eggs for breakfast :)  It was fantastic!  My 10 year old did the work on this one (after eating all my eggs).  We put a simple vanilla/milk/butter/powdered sugar icing on top of this.  I must say I had it for breakfast and lunch the next day and it is verrryy filling!!  Yum.

I altered the recipe, (still turned out okay :)  (Oh yeah!  I made cupcakes: some with semi-sweet chocolate chips, and some without.  I think the ones without tasted better.)  Update:  After about 10 hours, the ones with chocolate chips in them tasted better.  (I think this cake product tastes better while it's still warm, than after it's cooled.)

This recipe is great. The only thing I did differently was add less sugar. I used 1 and 1/2 cups sugars instead of 2 and that was plenty. My niece is allergic to dairy so my SIL and BIL were thrilled when I brought this to the super bowl party tonight! I guess now I'm making her birthday cake every year! :)

This cake is surprisingly good! I made it with my 8 year old son (and help from my 3 year old daughter) as a science and math experiment. We only made 1/2 the recipe- which my son figured the conversions. It was fun teaching the reaction of the baking soda and vinegar, too! We were out of vanilla extract, so we subbed mint extract. The end result was great! The kids all loved it! I KNOW we will be making this one again!

The first time I made this cake it was excellent! The second time I forgot the baking soda. It still got eaten, but it was more of a dense heavy brownie than a cake! (Baking soda is a must!)

Made with 1/2c applesauce and 1/4c oil, 1 1/2c sugar and added organic chocolate chips.  So good!  The bad thing is that I'm eating teh whole thing by myself instead of sending to boyfriend's workplace...

Flavor was good, not great, but mine did not turn out very moist at all. They were tough & chewy. It was a big flop for my party. I probably won't be making this cake again-sorry:(

Truly good.  I am cheap with three hungry boys to constantly feed, so I liked the fact that it had no milk or eggs.  Very inexpensive to make and very moist.  I whisked dry ingredients in a large bowl then made a well and added wet and whisked for about a minute.  Poured in 9x13 and baked at 350 for about 43 min, just shake it a bit and when the center is set, it's done.  Did a chocolate glaze and my kids said it was the best cake they ever had.  Who da thought??

Wonderfully easy, cheap, and tasted great. I used a good quality cocoa and increased it by a few T, and mixed it in a bowl instead of the pan (I don't think I'm that coordinated).

Very light and wonderful chocolate cake. I have to say that I'm a skeptic turned fanatic of this recipe.
Works wonders time and time again!

The only change I made to this recipe was adding 1/2 c. chocolate chips to the batter before baking. I mixed the batter in a bowl and greased/floured two 9" pans prior to pouring the batter in. I think they baked for about 20 minutes. Make sure you heavily grease and flour the pans as the cake is stubborn coming out. I agree that it tastes better the next day. Thanks!

I made this cake because I was out of butter, milk and eggs. It is a perfect pantry staple recipe. My son and I tried it while it was warm and were not impressed. The taste was bland and the texture was not very moist. Per a comment below we covered it up and let it sit all day until after dinner. Sure enough it had a nice chocolate flavor and was very moist. We are not big sweet eaters so we did not put any frosting on the cake and it was perfect. But I can see this being a very versatile cake. You could use it for cupcakes, muffins with chocolate chips and german chocolate cake. Next time I cook it with kids we will do it in a bowl. The pan method was pretty messy, but we all had fun.

This cake was awesome.  Certainly the best I've had in the seven years since I stopped eating eggs.  I mixed it in my stand mixer and greased the pan with butter and flour, it unmolded beautifully.  I also substituted half the AP flour with cake flour.  Very nice.  A ganoche-esque icing made with sweetened condensed milk and chocolate melted together was a deliciously rich way to finish this cake.

This cake is good because it uses readily available ingredients and doesn't take long to prepare.  However, it is different from a regular cake.  It's not as dense, and is moist to the point of almost being wet.  The chocolate flavor is not as strong as I like, but I think adding chocolate frosting to the top of the cake or chocolate chips to the batter would help that.  I didn't like mixing the ingredients in the 9x13 pan as it was more difficult to fully mix the ingredients than it would have been in a bowl.  My favorite will always be, "Hersheys Deep Dark Chocolate Cake".  That's what I make my family if we need a chocolate fix!

Yummy! I've been making this for a couple years now. It tastes so good, you don't even need frosting. Just serve with some Cool Whip or homemade whipped cream - that's the best way. Very refreshing!

The cake was not as sweet as I would've liked, but 3 out of 4 Brownie Girl Scouts liked it.  It was simple to put together and allowed the girls to test out new skills.  The cake was moist, had good flavor and was easy to put together.  We would make it again.

This is an absolutely lovely recipe.  My daughter had to bake a cake for a class report.  She baked this cake and not only received and A+ but all the children loved the cake also.  Thanks for a enjoyable cake.

Whoever came up with this recipe should've been knighted! I've been very allergic to eggs my entire life, so I can't say whether or not it's the best cake recipe in the world - it's the ONLY cake recipe in the world. Couldn't someone come up with an eggless white cake, yellow cake, upside down cake? (I won't ask for angel food.) Why isn't it good unless there's an egg in it?

This will be my go to chocolate cake. Followed recipe exactly and baked in 9x13 pan. Perfect texture, moist, and deep chocolate flavor. Used Dutch processed cocoa. Delicious!  Next time I’m going to try using coffee in place of water as others suggest.

This is just as quick as a box cake but it is homemade. Excellent one bowl cake ready in minutes. I thought the cake was moist, rich yes but it’s chocolate cake! Skip the icing this cake can be served with a dusting of confectioners sugar a dollop of whip & some fresh berries. Definitely making this again.

I made no changes to the ingredients - only to the order they were added because I wanted round cake and couldn’t mix it in two round pans. I will definitely be making this again, it’s easy to make and tastes delicious!

I made this cake but change the sugar ratio to 1 1/2 cps, after reading how some people thought it was too sweet. I made a cream cheese glaze to top it.  It was perfect so moist and  delicious. I will never buy another chocolate mix again.

Awesome! I've made it 3 times now and it's worked beautifully each time. I use cold coffee instead of water. I've found that frosting tends to overpower the cake, so my favorite so far is to use a simple chocolate ganache. 8 ounces of cream and the same of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Heat the cream and pour over the chocolate. Whisk, whisk, whisk until glossy and pour over the cooled cake. I put it in the fridge for about a half hour to set. I love this because it's not so sweet and lets the cake shine.

A great recipe to use extra fine harina...I live in Mexico and fine is more readily available in my barrio.  I cut back on liquid....used jarred caramel sauce with my own salty buttery blend.  The texture is smooth and light.

I used brown sugar instead of white, and buttermilk and coffee instead of the water.... What an amazing cake!!! My new go to recipe for chocolate highs. Update: I looove the way this recipe needs no advance planning... No butter and eggs to keep out, no special ingredients.

I didn't think it had enough chocolate flavor. If I make this again, I'd use more cocoa and strong coffee instead of water. I don't think this is worth making again when there are very good one bowl chocolate cake recipes that are really tasty and just as easy in my opinion. My husband is usually a dessert junkie but he hasn't touched it since the night we tried it.

It's very good and very chocolatey. It's pretty moist also. I frosted it with a sugar, milk, and chocolate chips glaze. Yummy! It's so easy to make, it'd be great for children to attempt. There's basically no cleanup.

I have made this cake for my family for years. And for the last 10 years I’ve been making it as one of our desserts  for 9 separate camps, ages 6-adults. Everyone loves it. And as mentioned by others, it’s great to use for those that have egg allergies

I have been making this cake since my oldest son's first birthday. He's now nearly 11 and has five younger siblings. Out of 8 family birthdays per year, this cake gets made more than any other. It's special enough for a birthday and easy enough to whip up when you just feel like a good basic chocolate cake. I reduce the sugar just a bit for our palate and at this point I can safely say this isn't a cake we'll ever tire of.

Thank you for posting this recipe.  After my mother passed on most of her recipes were lost and this was one of them.  I have seen this called several things; GD Cake (Great Depression), Dump Cake, Crazy Chocolate Cake, and now Crazy Cake.  It could also be called Vegan Cake!  My mom’s recipe was called Dump Cake with a version that had 2 ¼ - 2 1/2 cups of sugar called Crazy Chocolate Cake.  
Anyway a dense, moist, great flavor, not too sweet cake!  Excellent cake and I will make it again.  My Vegan daughter loves it too.  I saw one suggestion to add 1 cup of chocolate chips which sounds great.

I've made a smaller version of this cake for years.  I use whole wheat flour and cut the amount a little bit.  I've made it with carob powder and I've made it as a spice cake.  It's very forgiving to ad hoc changes so far as flavoring goes.  I also cut the sugar by about 1/2 and it still tastes great.  The latest version used a powder for Mexican hot chocolate instead of carob or cocoa ---- added an interesting flavor.    This is a cake you can "mess with" successfully.

The first time I made this cake I thought it was horrible! It kept nagging at me, though; how can you mess up a chocolate cake? I realized I had forgotten most of the sugar!! Made it again & it was delicious. I am always looking for smaller cakes so there aren't as many leftovers. Will certainly keep this recipe & will make it again. Just need to stay focused.

This recipe is very good. However I think on my part I will have to tinker with my oven so the outer layer doesn't come out too dry. I was skeptical  since the recipe had no eggs in it. Lo an behold I was greatly surprised. Like others have pointed out, this recipe is easily garnished. I made half the recipe and got about 6 little bundt type and 5 cupcakes. They are very moist on the inside and the flavor is excellent. It is absolutely not overly sweet. They taste good without any frosting and with ganache or ice cream! Will definitely make it again!

I love it.  It a healthier option than brownies.  I am satisfied.  I mixed it in the bowl instead of directly in the pan just like the recommendation of a reviewer.

I have been making this for years.  I did some experimenting and  didn't use the cocoa.  I made spice cake  using pumpkin pie spices, and I've made apple cake by adding cinnamon and finely chopped fresh apples.  It's about the easiest cake to make there is and it always turns out well.

Easy cake to make. Followed the recipe as written. I did not grease the pan as instructed and it did stick a bit. I would make it again especially if time or energy was short.
I topped it with snickerdoodle buttercream and it was very good.

My mom made this when I was growing up- often sprinkling the batter with chocolate chips and then sugar, before baking. It makes a crackle topping and saves time because you don’t need frosting. 
This is still my go-to chocolate cake recipe.

My mother made this cake in the 50’s.  It was only half this recipe for an 8x8 or 9x9  pan and always made  with a dark chocolate boil frosting for extra richness.  She called it a Whacky Cake.  Simple and fun to make, especially to have young children help.  Glad to see the recipe is still around.  Great taste!

I have made this countless times in a thousand variations.  As the recipe reads, it's great.  But, u can literally throw anything in there u think might be good and chances are it will be.  Works great for cupcakes too.  My 10 year old is getting into baking from scratch, no boxes, she of course starts and realizes we have no eggs, but we have about 9 gallons of Costco vinegar, so we tried this.  It was great.  We've tried every 3 days or so since, she's thrown everything in or on there, Snickers chunks, swedish fish, gummy bears, it all worked out to varying degrees.  She altered it unassisted to red velvet, which was cool, aside from the mess.  My favorite, replace the water with cooled strong dark coffee, add some coconut flakes, almonds, and some nutella, I got a thing for chocolate though.  By "some" I kind of eyeball it, but maybe half a cup or so, or to your taste, add a little water or coffee if it thickens too much...usually 2 8 inch silicone pans  buttered or sprayed, or cupcakes in the paper liners is real easy...

I have been making this recipe for 40+ years. It was one of the first things I ever made and baked by myself. It doesn't sound right, no milk, no egg, using Vinegar?? It is moist, chocolatey and delish. Doesn't even need frosting. I use dark cocoa, coconut oil and Apple cider vinegar. Got to go now. Time to take out the cake!!!!!

Easy dairy and egg free recipe that is delicious! I always add about 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips to add a richness to the chocolate flavour.  Easy, quick, no messing with eggs and butter. Love it.

I love Wacky/Depresion Cakes! I made this today, instead of 2 cups of sugar I only used 1 1/4 cups as the frosting will be sweet enough. Delicious and moist, thank you for a great and classic recipe!

My grandmother and mom maxes this growing up. It’s amazing!  Do not put frosting on it... cool whip or whipped cream only. I use apple cider vinegar instead. This cake can sit on counter uncovered for a week and will still be just as moist as the first day.... but it absolutely will NOT last that long!! Promise!

This is the first cake recipe I've made for my vegan (no eggs, no dairy) daughter that didn't disappoint! Typically, cake recipes labeled as vegan have been...in my experience...gooey, sagging in the middle, and almost too fragile to frost. But this recipe had a really nice rise and crumb! Tasted great! And easy!

I made it in a 9 x 13 pan and did the things suggested by others...upped the cocoa to 3/4 cup and substituted cold coffee for half the water.

Thanks for a great chocolate cake recipe!!

Loved it!  As a vegan, I was happy to find a recipe that doesn't have eggs. I took someone's advice and added (vegan) chocolate chips which added to the intensity of the chocolatey-ness. It was a hit at the office and made me look like a star baker!

For some reason, mine didn’t rise to be cake-like. It turned out dense like a brownie - and tastes just like a brownie. Still good! I will try this one again.

My family calls this WACKY Cake  , we've made it for years !! -  Great for a weeknight  when there is no dessert - no extra mixing bowls, mixers, just stir right in the pan -  pop in the oven and sprinkle over some powdered sugar and/or  a scoop of ice cream right out of the oven ! It's a crazy recipe and SO good !  sounds crazy - but it's great ! I add a little cinnamon sometimes I squeeze over some Hershey's syrup ribbons

Superb! A real devils food cake, I frosted with buttercream icing/frosting. Made 1/2 recipe which is enough for 2 people for 2 or more days, most likely 2 days, you'll eat more than 1 piece.

The recipe says "an ungreased cakepan" - NOT correct...make sure you grease and/or flour the pan - it will NOT come out, lol. Very disappointed.  Cake tasted good, although half of it was still in the pan and half out.

Even a troop of Girl Scouts couldn't tell that it was an eggless cake! Then they couldn't  figure out the secret ingredients that replaced the eggs. It's a moist, tasty cake and I make cupcakes too. Never again will I feel desert deprived due to my egg allergy.

It was absolutely delicious! I made it as a birthday cake for my sister's birthday and it kept lovely and moist for a few days afterwards too. I would say this is by far the best chocolate cake recipe I've ever tried and I would definitely recommend to everyone who enjoys chocolate cake.

Delicious eggless cake!  Followed the tips from another reviewer- Skwerl- and it was perfect!  I used 2 9-inch cake pans and cooked for about 35 mins.  The cake was moist and delicious.  I did add about 1/2 a cup of chopped chocolate chips which everyone loved.  Happy to have found a good chocolate eggless cake!! Thanks for sharing the recipe :)  Its definitely a keeper

Such a quick and easy cake to make and quite tasty too!
Had completely forgotten about two cake recipes I was given decades ago, which are quite similar.  One was called Wesson Oil Cake, the other Wacky Cake.  They were nearly identical to this recipe, only used hot water instead.  Cannot locate those recipes now, but thankfully this one arrived on time.
As I always do when baking something for the first time, halve the recipe so nothing is wasted if we don't like it.
Had everything on hand in the pantry.  Sifted the dry ingredients into one bowl, using a tad less sugar than written, as I always prefer to do.  Used 1 c cold coffee rather than water; everything else stayed the same.  Added the wet ingredients together in another bowl, then mixed all together with a spatula, poured into an 8x8 pan, and baked 30 mins.  It was perfect!
After cooling in the pan about 10 mins., sifted confectioner's sugar on top, then just had to try a bite and it was great!
Later, ice cream was added for a wonderful dessert.
Can't imagine anyone having any trouble with this recipe.  Batter was just the right consistency, not too thick nor too thin.  Worked perfectly and will be made again and again.
Thank you for sharing!

Always looking to reduce the sugar in everything we consume so I was shocked at the 2 cups BUT the simplicity of the cake was tempting.  I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and it was good!

I have been making this cake since the late 1960s when a friend gave me the recipe. It's my go-to cake for when I need to make a fast, easy dessert, and I have been especially happy to be able to offer it to people with egg or dairy allergies. Since I don't like white flour spots in the final cake I mix the dry ingredients completely in a bowl before adding the wet, and then pour the batter into the baking dish. I usually make a half-recipe version in an 8" square glass baking dish but have also made the full version in two layers in metal baking pans. I've made a simple frosting for the top (and between the layers when I've made layers) but the cake is also fine with just icing sugar sprinkled on top. BTW, I've even baked it in a pan shaped like a star of David for a Jewish potluck in a synagogue, as the recipe is kosher. I'm going to try some of the variations suggested by other reviewers, as I'm sure they'll be great.

I have made the smaller  version of this cake.  The frosting recipe is also chocolate.  The cake is absolutely great, especially considering the ingredients.  The people during the depression had to conserve and they certainly came up with a great cake reciper!!!

This is a delicious cake, but since my Hubz has to watch his sugar intake, I always have to cut back on that ingredient in recipes.  I cut the sugar in HALF, using just 1 cup of it, and I SWEAR you will love it just as much!  It's PLENTY sweet!  ALSO, when I pulled it out of the oven I immediately put half a large marshmallow on what would be each piece of cake, once cut. Popped it back in the oven for 2 minutes, then smashed the marshmallows down somewhat.  I drizzled a small amount of white and then of chocolate frostings, just for looks, while the cake was still hot.  YUM!!!

I made this for the first time today and wow! The cake is delicious.     I substituted Raspberry  vinegar  for the white, and coffee for the water  and added some chocolate chips.    Divine :)   I like that I didn't need eggs or butter for it.

I am 15 and I love to bake this is a very easy cake and we always have the ingredients on hand. My mom loves the fact that you don't get very many dishes dirty. It is such a delicious cake and it only takes me 10 minutes to mix up. I just made it for my gerbils birthday. I would recomend this cake to anyone

This is an awesome recipe utilizing ingredients you normally have in the pantry.  I substituted 2 cups of coffee for the 2 cups of water that the recipe called for, and it gave it an extra "cocoa-mocho" flavor!

Yesterday was my moms birthday. I was having her and my siblings come over for dinner. A few hours before they got here I realized we had no cake and I had no car to run to the store for eggs. I made this cake with just a variation in the method. First I sifted all the dry ingredients in a bowl. Then I added the wet ingredients. When I took the cake out of the oven I put aluminum foil over the top to keep it hot and moist until dessert time. When it was time to serve I sifted powdered sugar over the top instead of making frosting. Everyone loved the cake and came back for seconds. It was a nice fluffy and moist cake with the perfect amount of chocolate flavor. The chocoholics and chocolate haters all loved this cake. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Used Splenda in place of sugar, left out the cocoa, and added cinnamon. Topped with strawberries with syrup/sauce, whipped cream, and cherries. Great recipe!

After trying a handful of vegan cake recipes, I stumbled upon this one, which is really like the holy grail.
Have baked it 10ish times now (have a vegan daughter and grandkids) and even the non vegans declare it's the best cake ever.
I mix dry ingredients with a whisk in a large bowl (I add a half teaspoon of baking POWDER also) Then mix together wet ingredients, subbing coffee for water. Stir together LIGHTLY (doesn't matter if there are still streaks of flour)  Pour into two 8" pans and bake for 35 mins (150 C fan forced)
Double test with a skewer (wiggle it too) as it's a bit slow to set in the middle.
Sandwich together for an awesome birthday cake.
Absolutely no vinegar taste for me! (I use cider vinegar)
Best of all? It actually tastes better on day two, so you can get it all squared away the day before the party. One less thing to do on the big day.
Edited to add : There may be a slight vinegar taste at first, but it disappears COMPLETELY within a couple of hours. Don’t bin your cake, just try it again later!

This is the same recipe that has been handed down in my husband's family for generations, it always turns out great, and is a favorite of the family. It is quick and easy to make, my kids always liked joining in, helping me to mix it in the pan with forks.

no vinegar taste, rose nicely,  used cold coffee in place of water   and did not give it a coffee flavor, either but had a gorgeous color and deep chocolate flavor.  no frosting necessary, just powdered sugar sprinkled on top  and my family was happy!!!!!!!!  oh, low on sugar so subbed half of it for powdered sugar  {1 cup granulated sugar= 1 and  3/4 Cups powdered sugar}  cuz i had plenty of that. Also, didn't do the " easy" technique as the recipe called for, baking is easy enough for me, so i just mixed dry ingredients in a bowl,  wet ingredients in another bowl, combined the two bowls  and then  greased and floured a 9x13 pan and poured the batter in. its a fairly wet/watery batter- makes for a moist cake! By the way, we have  no food allergies, but on tight  budget and out of eggs. great recipe that i will gladly use again and again! update: made this again with a totally different approach---taking the suggestion of another reviewer, subbed corn starch for the cocoa, and turned it into a lemon/lime blueberry cake. Omit the vanilla, add 1 small pkg of instant lemon pudding, juice and peel of an entire lime ( pulverize it in the blender){oh, did not have fresh lemons, thats why I used lime} then  add 2 tablespoons lemon juice to the recipe). This came out lemony, but not overpowering. Also, i used 2 cups of sour milk instead of the water.  I save sour milk in fridge for baking, and use it every chance I can.  This was delicious! next time I will increase the natural citru

This was an easy cake to make. I simplified it further by mixing dry and then in a large liquid measuring cup I mixed all the liquid ingredients. I then added all the liquid to the dry and it turned out amazing.

Another change I did was that I used 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1 1/2 tsp of almond extract. This made a cake that smelled and tasted like it had a hint of maraschino cherry to it.

I transferred oil from a large container to a smaller one and there was 1/2 cup left in the bottom. I needed to use it up so I could toss the large container. That is why I decided to make this recipe. I actually have it in a cookbook and have made it before. After reading the reviews I remembered the results. So, I decided to add in a box of chocolate pudding mix and substitute the water with a 16.9 oz bottle of diet cola hoping to get more flavor. It was alright but it was still lacking the depth of flavor that I like. I would follow other reviewers suggestions and stir in some chocolate chips. I also thought maybe adding some cinnamon might help but didn't try it. It is so moist it really does not need a frosting but I think a dollop of cream would be good. I had to have a glass of milk after eating my piece. I also followed another reviewers suggestion of combining all dry ingredients and then adding the liquid ingredients. Although it said to stir with a fork I mixed with my mixer on low to combine and then on medium for about 2 minutes. Some reviewers said their results were flat and I thought the extra air from the electric mixer might help.

This is my new go to cake. I am gluten free, so I substitute a mix of rice, almond and tapioca flour.  This cake is great and with a few tweaks anyone can eat it. I have also substituted zyletol (not sure of spelling) for the sugar for my diabetic friends.

What a good recipe! I had my in laws visiting and wanted to make a quick sponge, but had forgotten to buy eggs! So came across this recipe- it's really good, no taste of vinegar. I did have to cook it for a little bit longer, but did use a deep tray.

Very good egg free cake recipe.  I have never made an egg free cake before, but was having over my daughter's girl scout troop and one of the girls is allergic to eggs.  I searched, read the reviews and decided to give this one a try.   The batter was not very chocolaty so I added a little bit extra cocoa and a few chocolate chips.  If I make again, will still add more chocolate.  It turned out pretty good, not spectactular, but good.

It is the most moist and delicious cake ever. Everyone loves it. I've made it several times, using regular buttercream, chocolate buttercream, mint buttercream, and peanut butter buttercream icing on it. All recipes are here on Allrecipes app. Love this app and I love this cake!!

I halved the recipe, except for the cocoa (I like a stronger chocolate flavor), substituted coconut milk for the water, and baked it in a 9x9 pan for about 22 minutes.  An awesome chocolate cake!  I wouldn't know that it was vegan!

This is fun to make with kids, because of the whole vinegar/baking soda thing. But they won't want to lick the spoon!
It always seems to get moister and more flavorful by the second day.  But it's better to eat it quick because the extra moisture makes the frosting slide off (2-3 days) and it will mold faster than a box mix too(5-6 days?)!

This is my second time making this cake and it's great.  The first time I forgot to adjust the baking time as I made cupcakes.  However after cooking for 30 minutes it was still quite good.  The second time around I baked it for 18 minutes and came out perfect.  This will definitely be my go to chocolate cake recipe.  I did add a tablespoon of instant coffee and lessened the sugar to 1.5 cups.

I made this & it's was delicious!  Very easy to make . My 13 year old niece made it. We used a package of chocolate sugar free pudding in place of the cocoa powder because we didn't have any. It came out super moist...I think I'd do the same thing again.

This has been a recipe I have made for birthdays and school functions forever. I originally got it from a Home Interiors Cook Book by Ms. Crowley. Great with people with dairy allergies. great with  german chocolate frosting topping, however we usually eat it without frosting.

It's really moist. It seems ok but the flavor is a little lacking do me. I didn't use coffee as others suggested but did add a good amount of chocolate chips. I think it really needs some frosting. Maybe that will give it the flavor punch I think it needs. It was a fun- crazy- cooking process. I'll give it that it that with the vinegar & all!

Followed the recipe, reduced ingredients in half.  First mixed dry ingredients in a BOWL, added vanilla to oil, water to vinegar and added all to dry ingredients.  Stirred vigorously.  Didn't have to use hand mixer.  Added all to greased baking dish.  Great! Very moist and tasty.  Enjoyed with a little powder sugar and a cool glass of almond milk. Will use again.  Delic!

This is one of my favorite cakes.  I use it for cupcakes, then add my favorite cream cheese frosting, drizzle a little caramel sauce on top then finish it off with some bacon sprinkles.

OMG!!!! This cake was so easy to make and super delicious!!! I cut the recipe in half because I wanted to see how it would come out first. First greased and floured the pan. I changed the method, by sifting the dry ingredients in one bowl, and mixing wet in another, then used my mixer to blend them together. I added cold coffee instead of water as some reviewers suggested to make it more rich.  Another reviewer suggested making it the day before you need it... OMG yes please do that!!!! I made it last night and it was delicious, but when I had a piece this morning it was even better.  I made it for a friend who has dairy allergies and she absolutely loved it, she wants more.. Thank you for posting this recipe. This will be my go to chocolate cake for now on!!!

This recipe is so easy and not expensive at all to make.  It uses the pan you are cooking in to mix all ingredients.  I used coconut oil in mine and it was FABULOUS.  The only complaint I have is I would have liked the recipe for the icing on the picture.

Also I did to it without cocoa powder  and the vanilla cake that was made was AMAZING!!!!

The whole family loved it! I didnt have any cocoa powder on hand so i subbed it for 1/2 cup of flour and turned it into a vanilla cake! We let it sit overnight to cool and iced it with cream cheese frosting and it was very yummy! i liked how dense it was as well and would be really yummy with ice cream

This turned out exactly like I had hoped it would. It was so easy and my daughter who doesn't even like chocolate cake loved it.  I spread store bought icing on it and it was delish! I will definitely make this again and again.

This is a great recipe, I don't make eggless cakes and was really surprised at how soft and moist it turned out. I added a cup of coffee and a cup of buttermilk instead of the 2 cups of water. It isn't very sweet but I put chocolate ganache on it and was great.

THIS CAKE WAS THE BEST THING THAT IVE EVER PUT IN MY MOUTH!!!!! it was moist and amazing and i love it soo much i didnt follow the "well" instructions, instead i put the wet and dry ingredients together seperatly and it turned out perfect! i used a sweet vanilla and cinnimon frosting and it tasted amazing with the cake, i definately reccomend this  cake to everyone on this entire earth, i do reccomend greasing the pan though, as it says not to in the instructions.

Added one cup of coffee in place of the one cup of water, still used the other cup of water.  Possibly the best chocolate cake I've ever had. Made this for a friend who's mom used to make it, she said it tasted just like her mom's.

Thank - you for this fantastic recipe!  On a whim one afternoon, I thought some of your "crazy cake" was in order since all the ingredients were sitting in my pantry.  It came out of the oven moist and chocolaty (but not too sweet).  It became an instant "keeper".  Since I have also halved the recipe for just me and my hubby and it turned out perfectly!  This is a fantastic simple and super easy chocolate cake recipe!

This was pretty good!  It tasted good and kept its moisture.  It could use a little extra boost of chocolate.  Maybe add more cocoa powder or some chocolate chips?  It made 24 cupcakes at 350F x 22 minutes.

I love the fact this is eggless and dairy free. I had everything on hand, and made the cake as called for. The texture is super soft (not mushy soft, but this lovely soft airy texture). I took one star off because I think (and this might just be my own opinion) the sugar level was pretty low. Maybe I'll add 2-4 tbsp sugar next time I make it. I might even add 2 c cooled coffee instead of cold water to enhance the chocolate flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

This is my go to cake for my kid who has egg allergies. You would never guess it isn't normal cake. I usually mix it in a bowl and make cupcakes and multiple smaller cakes out of it.  It turns out just fine. No need to mix in the pan if you don't want to!

Wow. This recipes is amazing. I've seen the crazy cake video on FB but hadn't tried it yet. This is the same idea. I've been looking for a go to chocolate cupcake and this will be the recipe I use, which yields 2 dz cupcakes baked for 15 min each at 350c. Like someone else posted I mixed in a bowl and substituted 1 cup of water for a strong brew of coffee. I then made them into cupcakes! A great combo is with orange glaze (1 c icing sugar and 2 tbs of frozen orange concentrate and then add by 1/2 tbsp until you get consistency you want). Amazing flavour of the choc and orange to the taste buds. My sister doesn't like chocolate and orange together but she couldn't believe how amazing these were!

I admit that I was skeptical when I saw this recipe. I halved the recipe (and baked it in a square pan) just in case it wasn't a success.  I was surprised that the cake was moist, fluffy, and delicious.  I blended the dry ingredients before adding the wet ingredients. I wish that I found this recipe sooner; it would have satisfied countless late night chocolate cravings! Now I can have chocolate cake any time I desire. Try  it!

Made it many times! I mix it up, sometimes I make lemon or orange (like today), and also orange chocolate is very good. It's very moist. I also switch veggie oil out for healthy and tasty Coconut oil. Fantastic taste with orange or lemon cake. For either orange or lemon, I throw in a tablespoon or two of zest (organic of course) and some diced chunks, and fresh squeezed juice from the fruit. Delicious! Another variation I do is add a 1/4 of orange liqueur, like Cointreau. MMMM.

I didn't make a single change and this is by far the best chocolate cake I've make.  I took some to our pool league for a teammates birthday and the folks there went nuts over it.  Like a few others, I've added a cup full of mini chocolate chips in the batter.  With or without, this is the best Chocolate cake I've had.  Now I'm wondering if there is a white or yellow version of this formula?  Anyone out there know, I'd appreciate a recipe for one!

Used to believe the best thing about cake was the delicious frosting... then this recipe came into my life.  This cake is beyond delicious, it is perfectly moist and there is no need for frosting.  This is my favorite cake recipe as of yet!!!

My family loves to make this cake. We use 6 T. cocoa instead of 1/2 c. For the top we either dust on powdered sugar or drizzle a combination of powdered sugar and water or milk.

Fantastic cake; I halved the recipe and used coffee instead of water (just dissolved 1 tsp instant in 2 tbsp hot water then topped up with cold), also used GF flour for an allergen-free cake. Might have also slightly increased the amounts of sugar and cocoa to boost their flavors. Very crumbly, as you'd expect for an egg-free recipe, but still delicious and moist.

So glad this recipe was shared on here.  This is one of the first cakes my Mom taught me to make when I was in elementary school.  It was always so much fun.    Now I have a son the same age and he loves to help.  I have passed on the "hole making" baton to a new generation.

It was as fun to make as I remember, super easy and delicious!

i tried the recipe but i am not satisfied.. it was not fluppy... i baked it for 30 minutes.. the outside texture was crispy but inside is too moist like a clay... i used 2 tablesspoon mineral water instead of 1 teaspoon baking soda because i dont have any.. maybe that was my mistake..

I've been making this cake for my kids' birthdays for the past 2 years and it is a HIT!! They don't even want the store bakery cakes or boxed stuff anymore, and I feel so much better knowing what's actually in the cake.

I wish I could give this cake 100 Stars.  This is the only chocolate cake I make.  9x13, layer, and cupcakes.  To all those who say the cake falls : it will.  At less than 30 minutes of baking a toothpick will come out clean and you will think the cake is done.  Because it is such a moist cake it can bake the full 40 minutes.  At 40 minutes I find the cake will not fall.  The only change I make is the coffee for water and I frost with a whipped ganache.   Wonderful!!!!!

This is amazing!!!  I made these as cupcakes, following another person who told me 350 for 18 minutes- they turned out perfectly!!!  I did use 1 cup of the cocoa powder and used cold coffee instead of the water per the others' suggestions.  I'm so thankful for this recipe- I needed it to have a cupcake my daughter could bring to a birthday party. She has an egg allergy.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipe!!!

I'm trying out vegan cakes for a friend and wanted one you can make from scratch.  This one is great. I was worried because the batter seems runny, but it came out great.  The flavor isn't quite as rich and the texture isn't as dense/fine crumbed but on its own merits, it's excellent.

I make this but with hot coffee, and a little bit of sour cream or yogurt (at the end) for even more moistness. A++

This was delectable!  But, I did make some changes, incorporating some of the others' advice and making my own changes.  I'm usually not a "recipe changer", but this was was good!!  For the dry ingred,  I used 1 c sugar, and 1/4 c xylitol.  For the wet ingred,I used 3/4c melted unrefined coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  (If you don't like the hint of coconut flavor, use refined coconut oil.  Although, I thought the hint of coconut was a fabulous addition.)  I also replaced 1 tbs white vinegar with 1 TBS dark chocolate balsamic vinegar.  THEN, I brewed 1 c of coffee and melted ice until it equaled 2 c.  It was room temperature when I added it to the batter, which I think helped keep the coconut oil in liquid form.  Then, I combined all the dry ingredients in a big bowl, made a well, and added the combined oil, vanilla and vinegar and stirred gently until moist.  THEN I added the coffee/water, incorporated it (there were lumps), and poured it into a 9x13 VERY lightly greased glass pan.  I poked some of the lumps with a fork, mixed them in and put it in the oven for 30 minutes.  It turned out perfectly!

This is a very good and certainly an easy cake.  I have been making this cake for over 50 years....yes really.  I love the chocolate taste and moist texture.  I made this in three layers and used it to make an ice cream cake for my husband's birthday.

I have been making this same Crazy Cake recipe since I was 19 years old...52 years!  I do not sift the ingredients, use cider vinegar, and it doesn't matter what kind of oil you use...it always comes out great. You can just mix the dry ingredients in the cake pan...make the 3 wells and pour the water over and stir it all up with a fork (the way my mother-in-law taught me...or do it all in the KitchenAid stand mixer.  Don't over beat it. You do not have to grease or flour the pans...but if you decide you want to bake it in 2 round pans and want to layer them afterwards, lightly grease and then dust the pans with the dark cocoa powder so as not to have any white residue on your cake.  We cut ours in squares right out of the 9 x13" pan and just cover after frosting or sprinkled powdered sugar with foil.  It keeps well but never lasts too long!  Dark, rich and not too sweet...love this cake!

This is a very delicious, moist cake.  Took advice of previous reviewers and used (iced) coffee instead of water, upped the cocoa to 3/4 C, cut the sugar to 1 cup (I used coconut sugar + 1 tsp stevia powder) and kept the oil per the recipe.  Super good cake forget the eggless part!  Can't wait to try the orange version.  Thanks to the OP for posting the recipe.

This cake is amazing!! I have an allergy to egg and I found this recipe to be very helpful! It tastes wonderful! I did have to adjust a few things though. I made the cake vanilla because I also have an allergy to chocolate so I added corn starch instead of cocoa powder and put extra vanilla. I was a little critical at first because of the thick texture of the batter, but it was hands down one of the tastiest cakes I've ever made/ had! Thank you for this recipe!!

This is the cake my mother made all the time with a thick fudgy icing. It's the one cake I didn't get the recipe for, but I recognize it all the same. The cake is fudgy and dark and delicious. If it's too sweet, swap out some of the sugar for a sugar substitute. This cake was a favorite at all our annual family reunions and where Mom got the recipe. Enjoy it. It's a chocolate lover's fantasy.

This is absolutely my favorite chocolate cake recipe! I've made it at least ten times in the past year.. for friends, family, and colleagues. It always gets rave reviews and requests for more! (No one believes that it is made without eggs.) I slightly decrease the sugar, add instant coffee to the water and chocolate chips (per some suggestions in other reviews).

I grew up eating this cake and I can't believe I found the recipe here!  My mother and I have both moved multiple times over the decades and her recipe eventually disappeared.  After all the chocolate cake I've eaten in my lifetime, this is still the most moist and choclatey homemade one, not to mention easy and fun to make.  It never falls and it doesn't have time to dry out in the pan, because there are no leftovers. (We always had it in the pan, rather than bothering with trying to turn it out. It's a simple family cake, not necessarily a dress-up cake.)  I always liked it best with a fluffy vanilla or chocolate butter cream frosting and love the idea some of you had of adding choc chips. Can't wait to make this with my 7-year-old granddaughter and surprise everyone!

This is spectacular!!  I am pleased to say its one of the best chocolate cake recipes I have made.  Im not a package cake maker and this was so easy and a favorite of mine now.
Very moist and it does not need frosting, I may use a dollop of whip cream or  sprinkle of powdered sugar.

I learned to make this cake over 20 years ago in home ec class in 8th grade and it has been a favorite since. I make it into cupcakes or cakes all the time. I haven't met a person who doesn't like it.

This was not the moist cake I expected.  Even the addition of a thick fudge frosting didn't help. My husband asked not to make again.

This was a simple ingredient good cake, especially since it didn't contain eggs, butter or milk. I had cupcakes out of this and had them in the oven for 18 minutes. Would make again.

My mom used to make this cake all the time.  She did come from the depression era, too.  I like sweet chocolate cake and this one's for me! Add some red food coloring and you have a Red Velvet Cake... Awesome!

My "go to" chocolate cake. It's easier and tastier than a boxed cake mix! I like to make cupcakes with it and pipe on any kind of frosting -- buttercream, chocolate buttercream,  or peanut butter frosting. But this cake is delicious even without frosting.

Need to find my other crazy cake recipe as this one needs some fine-tuning (the vinegar is NOT the issue, for those put off by the vinegar).  1) I will NEVER make a cake in a 9x13 pan again.  Very hard to mix well/evenly and even stirring gently, I sent powder everywhere, creating a bigger mess than simply washing a separate bowl.  2) I used a high quality cocoa (AND replaced one cup of water with coffee as I always do with my chocolate cakes) and this still was barely chocolatey. Definitely needed more cocoa, although a moderate choc fan might have been satisfied. 3) This was not the fault of the recipe, but just a comment: My cake went from not done to nearly burnt very fast, so watch it closely the last five minutes. 4) Texture was good -- a wee bit oily, but probably needed that to come out of pan.  Very moist & rose well. My biggest issue was the lack of chocolate taste and the one-bowl method.

I made  this cake for my nan as she cannot eat dairy - I actually added two eggs and an extra 1/4 cup of cocoa, as I wanted it to be a bit more indulgent. I turned out really well, especially as I sprinkled chopped roasted hazelnuts on top before cooking. 
The batter was really huge - I ended up using an 11" round tin which was perfect. 
Will make it again, it has a lovely pudding-like taste.

Easy to make! Made it with my one and three year old boys and both helped. Wasn't too sure about how it would turn out because of the ingredients and the way it's made, but it's a great tasting cake and very moist too.

I used 1 1/2 cup of sugar but added 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Also my recipe called for warmed water. I gave it 5 stars because of the easy preparation, nice taste, quick clean up and my husband loved it.

My mother used this cake recipe for nearly all of my Birthday cakes while I was growing up.  It is moist and chocolatey and is great with a seven minute white frosting.  We stirred all of the dry ingredients into the cake pan, made two shallow depressions into which we added the liquid ingredients then stirred it all together right in the pan and put it in the oven.  It's a fun cake for kids to help make and as easy as any box mix out there; you do not need to grease the pan.  This is also a great mix for a layer cake, but now you will have to grease and flower the layer pans and put wax paper in the bottom so the cake layers release easily.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this cake. My mom has made this cake since I was about 5 years old and this is the only chocolate cake my brothers and I wanted her to make. Super-duper easy and absolutely delicious. Even as a grown woman I still ask her to make it. Just one bite brings me back to my wonderful childhood and moms great chocolate cake.

I made this cake for my daughter's birthday, since her best friend has an egg allergy.  I was nervous about it, but it turned out great!  I subbed in a cup of cold coffee for one cup of water, and I also made it in a mixing bowl and baked it in two 9" round pans so we could have a layer cake.  It has wonderful flavor and is very moist and delicious.  
Two thumbs up!

I made this exactly as written, except that I mixed it in a bowl so I could make 2 round layers. I used 2 - 9" pans, and they overflowed the pans, making a huge mess in my oven, then fell. I managed to salvage them, but they were kind of thin layers, which I filled and covered with "White Frosting" from this website. The texture of the cake was good, all things considered, but I will not be making it again.

The first time we made this recipe as is and it was delicious but a giant pain to get out of the pan.  We lost half the cake to sticky pan syndrome :)
  We have since tried it a few more times and so far our favorite enhancements are to use 2 cups of brewed cold vanilla or hazelnut coffee instead of water and toss in a handful of chocolate or peanut butter chips.  We also mix the dry ingredients in a bowl and then add the wet.  This allows us to grease the pan well.

I've had better chocolate cakes, but for its simplicity and versatility, this one's a keeper.  We don't eat a lot of eggs in our house, so we almost never have them on hand; this recipe's great for when we want cake but don't want to make a special trip to the grocery store.  I followed one reviewer's advice and cut out the cocoa and replaced the water with an orange-mango juice blend, and it was very good!  I've made three variations already.

I have used this recipe exclusively -- modified only for the pan sizes I've used -- since 1965.  Everyone says the recipe product is FANTASTIC !!!TO change it to a very moist ORANGE CAKE, eliminate the cocoa and substitute frozen orange juice concentrate (bring to room temp) for the water.  Add your Orange Zest, and do the same substitution for the liquid in the icing.  It's GREAT !!!

This is the moistest cake I have ever made!!! The first time I made it I didn't frost it and it was gone before the end of the day. I also like to microwave a little hot fudge and pour it over the top just before serving.....also great with ice cream. I mixed everything in a bowl and then poured into pan.

this is really good. I made for years it has been in our grandmothers home cook book. she added nuts and raisens to hers and some times if she didn't have pumpkin on hand she replaced it with squash . I personally like it better with squash because we grow more squash so I can my own and it is easier to do.

This was an amazing cake. Very moist and simple to make. Mine was a bit dry but I am thinking it is my oven with the issue as it seems everything I cook lately is either over done or underdone in the suggested time. I will be making this again and often as I always have these ingredients on hand but don't always have eggs

A deliciously moist cake we didn't even put icing on because it's great all by itself.  My family raves about it & it's gone in a snap, I feel guilty to accept all the compliments because it's so easy & you don't even dirty a bowl or beaters to make it (or even grease the pan).  Easier than a box mix...maybe it should be called Lazy Cake :)

My nephew has an egg allergy.  I was looking for a dessert for him.  This cake was a perfect fit!! I was totally surprised by how moist and fluffy the cake turned out.  I have looked for several years for a cake recipe better than the box cakes.  This is it.  The only thing I did different from the original recipe was I had to use two different cocoas.  One was special dark and the other original Hershey's cocoa. I will definitely make this again and again!!!

The note about it being popular during the depression makes sense. My grandparents were married 2 days before the stock market crashed in 1929. We have loved this cake for all family gatherings. I have been trying modified versions with oils and vinegars that are fruit infused, give it a try.

We call this puddle cake because of the puddles formed by pouring the liquids into the wells in the dry ingredients, it's been in the family for generations! We sometimes sift some powdered sugar over it instead of frosting it, and sometimes eat it out of a bowl with milk poured on it.

This is my go-to recipe for chocolate cake. My family and I enjoyed this cake!!!  My elderly grandmother said this reminded her of her grandmother homemade cake. Thank you for sharing such a delicious recipe. Oh, and the vinegar isn't detected at all, only needed to make cake rise.

I got this recipe from my Grandmother, and she's been gone since the 70s.  It has been in our family for so many years. This is the best cake on earth and the easiest to make.
I've passed it down to our kids and our grandkids.  Everyone just loves it. And being egg free is great. A lot of people can't have them. This really does deserve 10 stars.

a neighbor gave me this exact recipe years ago and I have taken it to so many functions and always have to give out the recipe each time, as someone always asks for it.  It is so easy to whip up, great if you don't have eggs, or are vegan.  I always do mine in a bundt pan so I don't make the 3 wells.  I do always add the vinegar last.  so super moist. a winner every time.

Great cake! I made this for one reason, I had no baking powder on hand and I needed to make a cake fast! I remembered having this once before and I knew that the vinegar would be my "baking powder" for the moment. I turned this recipe into about 23 cupcakes (1/4 cup batter). At the party, I watched these cupcakes go one by one and I even saw people go back for a second. Great! I will use this again!

This cake deserves MORE than 5 stars! EVERYONE raved about it! great flavour, dense, moist, and cuts wonderfully. also keeps very well for a week (the only reason it lasted so long was because I made 3 layers for my final cake class project and couldnt go)

Have made this cake for several friends and all love it! This is an amazing recipe, quick and easy! I absolutely give this 5 stars!!!!
I do sometimes taste the vinegar but I think it's because I KNOW it's in there. 

P.S I also added about a tablespoon of instant coffee or sub cold coffee left over from the morning for the water. Compliments the cocoa.


THANK YOU FOR SHARING !!!!!!

This is the moistest, most flavorful chocolate cake recipe ever. My family has made crazy cake for years and our own "tweaked" version is a tradition for every special event. Our recipe is basically this exact one, but we always add a teaspoon of almond extract to the cake itself, and a dash of almond to the buttercream frosting. We also always melt chocolate chips and drizzle and swirl them into the frosting. Nothing better than breaking through a hard chocolate shell to get to sweet creamy frosting and rich, moist chocolate cake!

This cake is amazing. I followed the recipe exactly as written and the cake turned out perfectly. It was moist and very chocolate-y but not too rich. I topped it off with a drizzle of powdered sugar icing with a subtle orange flavour. (Better Homes & Gardens recipe. Make sure you keep tasting it or you could end up with a very orange-flavoured icing!) I served the cake at a birthday party and it was a hit. I'll definitely make it again! Thanks for sharing!

an excellent recipe.  it's fun to play around with things to use instead of 2 cups of water.  i've tried fresh brewed coffee, a pureed can of beets (use everything from the can and about 1/4 cup water to equal 2 c), and almond milk with great success.

I have three kids, and one has food allergies (peanut, egg, soy, and corn).  I love looking for recipes for him, and we all eat the safe foods that I bake or cook for him. Therefore, if we don't like it, I don't serve it to him.  This recipe is so unbelievably delicious that frosting is optional.  I love that it can be served to anyone, and they would never know that anything is missing, as compared to other cake recipes.  Now, I need to figure out how I can turn this recipe into a red velvet cake and how to make cream cheese frosting that's safe for my son.  Thank you for posting!!

We make this cake in our house at least once a week at our house.  It works so well for my daughter who can't have dairy or eggs.  She is so excited to be able to eat chocolate again.  Thank you for this recipe.  It has made teenage girl years much more "bearable"

I added milk chocolate chips as another reviewer suggested.  I just sprinkled them on top before baking.  I think it increased the chocolate flavor and sweetness of the cake.  I also used bread flour per another suggestion.  I don't know if this made the cake more moist as the reviewer said it would. The cake turned out very moist whether from the bread flour or just the recipe as a whole.  For the topping, I spread some sweetened condensed milk on the cake followed by whipped cream and crushed oreos.  Yum!

My daughter made it and rates it poor.  It stuck to pan, tasted oily and had coarse texture. Also not chocolatey enough!  Will stick to other recipes.  She followed it very carefully.

I have been making this cake for years and it is my go to recipe for a fast and yummy treat! I love how its not a real sweet cake but sweet enought to satisfy those cravings. And what could be better than a cake that's made in the pan it cooks in!

I've used this recipe for a very long time! My grandmother gave me the recipe for my cooking class back in high school and it managed to win our bake off. Even managed to beat out a fabulous Turtle chocolate cake! The version I use is usually halved but it is still an amazing recipe that has become one of my specialties. I've used it for just about every holiday there is! This recipe also makes REALLY good cupcakes!

I was so skeptical about not greasing the pan and stirring the recipe in the pan itself but to my surprise it did not stick and the cake was so delicious. I would recommended to mix well because otherwise there may be white mix at the bottom. Overall great texture of the cake and I used chocolate ganache glaze and put pecan pieces on top. My husband is not a chocolate on chocolate cake lover and this is his new favorite cake. :) thanks for the recipe Amy Parsons.

I love love LOVE Crazy Cake. Its simple, with so few ingredients, and also vegan friendly! This cake is absolutely perfect, the same way my mother made this cake!

I have my wedding coming up in October, so a search for a vegan friendly recipe for our cake was a must for family members who are attending!

I never review anything.  

But I am so delighted to have found such a great cake without eggs.  My daughter has an egg allergy and she gets so bummed when she can't have cake at birthdays.  Not only is this eggless, but it's really, really good cake.  not too sweet, but really chocolatey.

Made as written except didn't mix in pan and added mini choc chips.  excellent, thanks!

Took these to my daughters hockey game as it was her birthday -  got rave reviews from all the 16 year olds who had no idea there were no eggs.  Making it for the second time in two days - we made them as cupcakes as directed but in a large baking bowl so we could make the three wells.  A keeper!

So good!!  Next time I'll try to substitute half the oil for applesauce to cut down on the fat.  Still loads of calories, but worth it once in a while.  We didn't ice the cake, just sprinkled with a dusting of icing sugar.  Love it like that, not as rich or as calorie dense.

Definitely easy to make, but not exactly the flavor I was looking for.  I was hoping this would have a stronger chocolate flavor.  I made cupcakes and mini cupcakes decorated for Valentine's Day.  Cupcakes baked for about 16-18 minutes and mini cupcakes for about 8-10 minutes.  They were nice and moist and got rave reviews from several people.

Ifound this recipe as I was looking for something without eggs as I had none and it was my mothers birthday and didn't have time to go to the store before they arrived. I was totally happy with teh results of the finished product and so was all the other birthday guests. My mother in law is allergic to eggs and milk so this was the best cake ever... EVERYONE loved it... I will be making this again and again even if I have eggs and milk in the fridge...

I love this cake. I'm 15, and cakes are not my forte, they always turn out AWFUL, but this one was amazing! So easy too, you cook it and prepare it in a pan, no mess practically, which is good because I hate cleaning! Definately the only cake I'll be making other than cake mix.

I was afraid that it would be bland since it was advertized as a cake without a normal ingredient found in cakes....This cake was soooo good!  Much better than the last cake we tried off of this site.  Moist and Dense!

I've used this recipe for years we called it a Wacky Cake. So moist and great if you don't have or can't have eggs in your diet.

the best cake i have ever made!! I did a little substituting though because i did not have cocoa powder, instead i doubled how much cocoa powder you needed and used that many chocolate chips. Then i added the original 1/2 cup of flour instead of cocoa powder. So my ingredients were 3 1/2 cups flour, no cocoa powder, and 1 cup chocolate chips. Everything else was the same! This cake was gone in 2 days when we made it partly because we were trying to save it! It was the best cake i have ever tasted including ones from the store. I did not put frosting on it and it was great. The texture wasn't crumbly and wasn't dry and that is always good. I took it to school with me once and i gave my lunch table some to try. Since all the other times i made apple cake, not a fan of them haha, they were very especially because it was white with chocolate chips in like every bite! They said it was amazing and the next time i brought it in everyone wanted some i was left with 1/4 a piece for myself. Great CAke

Do not be afraid to try this cake, it is SO good!!! By not using any butter or eggs, the fat and calories are significantly reduced without giving up any taste. To me, this cake tasted similar to coca cola gave, it was awesome!

Awesome cake! Followed this recipe to a T, made the batter into cupcakes. They were so moist, everyone raved over them. I had to use apple cider vinegar in place of white. All I had in the house. And used about 2/3 cup of cocoa powder. Came out very dark and luscious!

This has been one of my very favorite cakes since I was a kid.  I started making it when I was about 12 years old.  It is a great cake to have your kids help you make, it's super easy to measure out and mix right in the pan, no pouring.

This cake is awesome! I made it last night for my dad's birthday and topped it with cream cheese frosting. Everyone loved it, especially my dad, who has to watch his cholesterol. With this cake having no eggs and the frosting made with fat-free cream cheese, it was perfect. =)

I was worried about making this cake because the instructions are CRAZY and don't seem like they'd really work.  But, I took a leap of faith and it turned out GREAT.  It's my kids' favorite cake now.   We like to top it with cream cheese frosting.  Yummy!

So yummy and moist!  Can't even tell there are no eggs in there.  My favorite chocolate cake and I always have the ingredients on hand.  You can frost it or dust powdered sugar on it.

I'm really not sure what to think of this cake, The taste was off, I think because it's eggless. It is super moist though and even though it didn't taste just like chocolate cake made with eggs I couldn't stop eating it! I did add half a bag of semi sweet chocolate chips, that added to the flavor. I made a white chocolate ganache to poor over it, which was a nice complementing flavor to it as well. however I do not think I'll be making this again.

Wow! my daughters & I made this cake over the weekend for a get-together, we followed the recipe as written with the exception of using olive oil & organic ingredients & it came out so good & moist. We received only complements! One of our older guests that eats only homemade cakes said "this is the real thing, very good" You can't go wrong with this keeper!

Yum! This cake was wonderful - I actually made cupcakes. I cut the recipe in half and it made 12 regular size cupcakes. I used special dark cocoa powder for 1/2 the batter and tried a mix of cornstarch and powdered sugar to make white cupcakes. The chocolate came out delish and the white were ok but I'll try with just cornstarch next time. Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe. I will most definitely make these again.

Crazy cake is crazy delicious. I have never had great success with most chocolate cake recipes, but this one was amazing. My friend said it was the best chocolate cake she ever ate - and she doesn't really like chocolate cake. It was wonderfully moist and kept its moisture for days. It was such a hit I had to blog about it.  I made mine in a silicone bundt pan, so it took about an hour to bake. Don't hesitate - make this cake.

My Mom made this frequently when I was growing up. She lost her recipe and I was so very delighted to find it here! It tastes exactly as I remembered it. I use fudge frosting cooked to soft ball stage. My Mom cooked the frosting to hard ball stage so it was actually 2 desserts in one...fudge and cake!

This cake is very moist and fluffy. It came out better then most cakes that have eggs in it. My husband was afraid to taste it but said it was delicious and coming from him that means something. I think this will be the chocolate cake that I use from now on.

Hmm this was delicious.  I didn't have any milk or eggs and was craving chocolate cake and this really hit the spot.  I liked it so much I make it instead of my previous go to recipe.

I was really hesitant to make this cake, but I'm glad I did.  It is really wonderful!  My husband loves it.  I am about to make it again.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I had to use apple cider vinegar beacause it was all I had on hand. Needless to say, my cake didn't rise. The batter tasted good though. So I know it could have been a great cake.

I've been making this recipe for a few years now as "Wacky Cake".  It is fantastic and fool proof, not to mention cheap!  Do what you want this cake turns out and is so good no matter how you mess up!

Wow, so cool to find this recipe. My mum made me crazy cake all through my childhood and I have been making it for years, but couldn't find the recipe tonight so searched for it with no expectation of finding it.. (somehow I thought it was particular to our family - silly me!) Great to discover that so many others love it too.  Absolutely my favourite cake. It shouldn't turn out dry, perhaps people are skimping on the oil? As for flavourless, we usually double the amount of cocoa! It's also really lovely with a jar of morello cherries stirred through the batter at the end, or you can use coffee instead of water to make it mocha. Once I mixed marshmallows through it, turned out very intensely sweet and chewy.. mmmm.   Does anyone have the recipe with cup/spoon measures rather than weights?  Cheers.

Both, my grandma and my hubby's grandma, made this cake. One called it "depression cake" the other "Crazy cake"  but we both grew up loving it. Him with caramel icing and me with peanut butter icing... we LUV this cake. Our grandmas have passed but whenever I serve this we have all of the warm snuggly feelings of our grandmas being with us. Today is my hubby's 55th birthday,,, guess what I'm making for him... of course with the caramel icing.

I had this recipe years ago & loved it then too. It is super moist. I made Saturday evening & it was still fresh enough Wednesday to cut in to pieces, decorate and give to my mother-in-law to serve at her community meal. (I had to get it out of the house before I ate the whole thing!!)

Wonderful texture, moist cake, but definitely needs frosting or some sort of topping.  I would have liked more flavor to this cake, but it is great with both chocolate mocha and peanut butter frosting.  I'll likely add a smidge of vinegar to all of the cakes/pancakes/waffles where I want a little more rise from here on out.  I often whip egg whites seperately in recipes for lighter results, and this would be a much faster method...Why didn't I think of that before???

Other than cut the sugar down to 1.5 cups, I changed nothing.  What I don't understand is why mixing everything in the 9X13 pan instead of in a mixing bowl with  mixer?  But anyway, the cake is very moist with a little strange after-taste.  Definitely a keeper for someone who has egg intolerance.

My 3 kids love making this cake.  They have nut, soy, egg, and dairy allergies so it's nice to find a recipe that tastes really good!  We also added Vegan chocolate chips. We have made this a few times now and it's top on our list of desserts to make!

I had low expectations for this recipe since it didn't have eggs. I was quite surprised with the end results. Moist, fluffy, and very good. I did use a 4x4x4 pan and used 1/3 of the batter. Next time I'll use 1/2 the batter (for the same pan) because it didn't rise as much as I expected.

Super yummy! Hubby begged for more! I like to serve it with warm fruit vinagrette (fruit simmered with red wine or balsalmic, a sprinkling of hemp oil and salt, and plenty of date sugar), or simply with blue agave syrup (sweet like honey but more alkaline). Baked in a glass 8x8 dish for 60 min.

This is the cake I used to make for the family when I was growing up. Then made it for my own kids as they were growing up. Somewhere along the way I lost the recipe, but now I have it again. I made one an hour ago and just ate the first piece. Yummy!!!!

I didn't really like it. I actually threw away most of it. Mixing it in the pan was difficult and not effective. I will try to make this again but will mix it in a bowl first before pouring it into the greased pan. The texture was just not consistent because it was not mixed very well in the pan. It also was not very chocolaty. Next time I will add chocolate chips to the batter like some others suggested and see how that turns out.

This is unbelievably good.  And I love, love, love the way you mix it in the pan.  No dishes to wash!  I have only tried it with the coffee instead of water.  Also, I used peanut butter icing (YUM) and irish cream icing (double YUM).

Wonderfully moist, and a great texture, especially for an egg and dairy free cake.  Not particularly chocolate-y though.  I'm definitely going to make it again, but I'll add more cocoa powder and maybe some chocolate chips.

This is an EXCELLENT chocolate cake recipe. It's not overly sweet and it's moist and flavorful. I like the idea of no eggs! :0) I complimented it with a dark chocolate frosting which really gave it extra good flavor.

Tastes great! Although, it does kind of tastes like a moist cake you'd buy from the store..not sure if that's good or bad.  I did use cold coffee instead of water.

This was delicious. Definitely a keeper. I also did the Orange  version and was not impressed. Will have to have a play with that one. The chocolate one however was lovely,moist and chocolatey. My son has asked for it as his 16th birthday cake.

This was super simple and cheap to make and it produced a really moist, tasty chocolate cake. Now that I know how to make it, I will try making layered cakes with this recipe. I like more frosting in between.

This is good. I made half the recipe and baked it in a 9-in. pan. It should be baked about 30 minutes, even with the recipe cut in half. It could possibly be stellar if chocolate chips were added and/or coffee was used for part or all of the water. Better than a mix, and in a way easier!

Really good, no-mess recipe.  I made half the recipe and used an 8x8 pan.  Also added chocolate chips per other suggestions.  Moist.  Was a bit crumbly...wonder if a day in the fridge will solve that.

I made this on a whim because I had the ingredients on hand and was craving some chocolate. I cut the recipe in half, because if there's that much chocolate cake lying around I'm going to eat it! I made the cake as directed, adding 1/4 C semi sweet chocolate chips and covered it with a chocolate cream cheese frosting (took a container of cream cheese frosting and added 1/4 C cocoa, whipped until fluffy). My boyfriend thought it was alright, but not chocolatey enough for him. Although I agreed with him, that it's not very chocolately, that's not necessarily a bad thing. My big complaint was that it was kind of dry; I prefer a moist cake. All in all, pretty good and I would make it again but I'd try to find a way to make it less dry.

What an easy cake!!!  I was only going to make a half batch, but at the end added the whole 2 cups of water!!  So I had to go back and add the additional flour, sugar..etc.  Well this cake was SO easy I just sifted it all into the batter I already mixed in the pan and re-mixed it again.  It cooked perfectly! I made a Buttercream icing from scratch (2 sticks butter, 1/3 bag powd sugar, heavy cream, cocoa powder & light corn syrup)  it was a great cake to toss together and with an easy clean up.  THANKS

Very good!  Moist, chocolatey and delicious. Added 2 teaspoons of instant coffee to the water just to give it a richer chocolate flavor.  Frosted with buttercream frosting. Can't go wrong with this recipe! :)

My 15 year-old son just made this cake tonight and it was delicious!  The boy doesn't cook anything more complicated than, say, a breakfast burrito.  I am finding evidence of un-orthodox measuring practices such as a liquid measuring cup with traces of flour in it and a dish that he apparently set a measuring spoon in so it would catch the excess when he "poured" baking soda into it.  Point is, this recipe seems to be pretty much fool-proof.  It's simple, it's quick, and it's good even without frosting.  This is something I know the boys will be making after school or when they have friends over.

I so wanted chocolate cake but was out of eggs.  I had the same skepticism about the vinegar but you won't even taste it.  I guess it reacts with the baking powder for rising purposes.  Quick and easy.  I can see us using this one several times a month.

Yay, this is our yatchie recipe which has followed me from childhood to uni - we've now renamed it 10 o'clock chocolate cake because its so quick to make, we always have all the ingredients and it fully satisfies late night chocolate cravings! Never lasts till the morning either!

This cake is awesome and definitely work baking.  The nice thing about this cake is that these are ingredients you have on hand at all times. I used a cream cheese frosting, delicious the Kids at it all up.  Nice & fluffy you can't go wrong.

excellent recipe for a deliciously moist chocolate cake.  i also halved the batter and make two 8" x 8" square cakes, baked at 350 for 35 minutes (until toothpick came out clean).  One for home, one for work!  Iced them with Whipped Vanilla Frosting and some fresh strawberries on the one I left home.  Would definitely recommend and will make again!

This is the exact recipe my 85 year old step grandmother shared with me after we had a gathering together for the first time and she made this.  It MELTS in your mouth.  She called it beat and bake cocoa cake :)  This one is an old one but a keeper for generations!

I have this recipe from my mother-in-law.. we call it "Screwball Cake". It is SO wonderful! We make it into cupcakes and cut the center of each cupcake out and fill it with peanut butter frosting. YUM!!!!! It's a requested favorite at family gatherings!

My mother also made this cake when I was young.  She called it 3 hole chocolate cake and used melted shortening instead of vegtable oil.  This recipe is very easy to double or triple, always comes out great.

Very easy to make, though I found it a bit flavourless. I added walnuts, more of which would have made it better. Has anybody tried adding fruit? I'm sure raspberries would go well but perhaps someone can suggest a cheaper alternative?

Also my only other problem was finding a vegan-friendly frosting recipe that I could make using ingredients I had on hand (note: I live in a country where icing sugar is impossible to find). 

But, overall a great, simple cake.

This truly makes the perfect Chocolate Cake!  With no eggs is great for those who are allergic.  I also used applesauce instead of oil to make it a little lower in fat.

Thank you so much for posting this recipe.  My five siblings and I grew up calling this cake "Cockeyed Cake"!  With all the moves, each of us managed to lose the recipe.  I've made it from memory several times, but it had been awhile and I was forgetting some of it...till my brother found it.  This one!  Although we live states and states apart, it's still our favorite and most-used cake recipe.  :-)

We called this wacky cake (a name my son gave it when he was 3) and used it when the children wanted to bake as they couldn't mess it up and loved the idea that they made it all by themselves, great with or without icing.

Wonderful chocolate cake! You won't belive how rich and moist this cake is without eggs or milk. I cut the recipe in half and made it in 1 round cake pan because it was just for my husband and I but now I wish I had made the full recipe! Great!

Awesome cake for those with Egg Allergies! My mom made this same one when I was little but it was called "Wacky Cake". Tastes awesome! I added about 1/4cup more cocoa just to punch up the chocolate flavor.

Very chocolately and moist.  Only thing I didn't like about it was that it was too crumbly to eat by hand

My mom made this recipe for me for every birthday, i am so glad i found it! Once you have had the crazy chocolate cake, no other cake really stacks up. I use a fudge type homemade icing and put it on while both are hot. The icing melts right into the cake and i don't think it could be better. A favorite in my family and friends, always asked for.

i was very sad after reading all the rave reviews, and then trying this cake. it was a very thin batter, so i had to cook it longer than it called for in order for it to be sufficiently cooked in the center. this made the edges all chewy. The taste was really bland, it needed more chocolate, and maybe a little less vinegar, the taste of it didn't cook all the way out. It was VERY easy to make though, i probably had it all mixed up in about five minutes, and the cleanup was a cinch, but the end result was sadly lacking. i was disappointed, i don't think i'll be making this again.

I'm so impressed with this cake. The family raved over it. Would've never thought this didn't have any milk or egg since is was so moist. This is perfect,even without the frosting. Only thing I added, was a handful of chocolate chips. Very light and airy. Great for vegans too.

This cake is wonderfully moist and delicious.  I started making this recipe for my daughter who is allergic to eggs.  I made cupcakes today for her preschool class, since one of her classmates is allergic to dairy.  It got rave reviews once again.  I have nieces who normally don't like cake - they always ask for seconds of this cake.  I always add 1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and increase the sugar by about 1/4 cup.  It is always so moist, friends are shocked when I tell them that it has no eggs or milk.  I will continue to make this recipe even when my daughter outgrows her egg allergy.

I made this cake (as well as the yellow cake version mentioned in a previous review) for my daughter's 2nd birthday, as she's allergic to eggs. Both came out very well--for eggless cake. Once she grows out of her allergy, we'll definitely be back to regular cake.

I'll admit I was skeptical.  But this recipe is fantastic, I added a touch more sugar and vanilla because I like my cakes really sweet! I frosted it with peanut butter icing and it was absolutely amazing!! Thanks for this recipe!

This cake was great.  Everyone loved it. I can't believe how quick it was to make.  I used Cream Cheese Frosting II (with only 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar instead of 4 cups).    This is a new favorite.

This has been a family favorite since I was a kid. Our favorite is when its frosted with a coconut pecan frosting (traditional german chocolate frosting). Its best when made the day before and then frosted just before serving.

I used to make this when I was little and was so happy to find the recipe on this site 5-1/2 years ago! THE best quick and easy chocolate cake recipe, hands down! I have 3 boys and a husband, and for each of their birthdays, they always request Mom's crazy cake.

This wasn't a bad cake recipe but it wasn't the best. I divided the batter in half and cooked in 2 9-inch round pans for about 25 min. The texture was very nice, it came out moist and airy, and the presentation was very appealing. The problem was the taste. I found it to have a very floury flavor that might have caused a lot of disappointment if it weren't for the great frosting I put on it. It could have been because I decreased the sugar slightly but I'm not sure.

Great recipe. I made cupcakes from this recipe for my daughter's birthday party. Some of her friends have dairy allergies and this reciped allowed them to enjoy cake along with the other kids.  I used a non-dairy white icing made from confectioners sugar and shortning topped with rainbow sprinkles. They were a hit!

My daughter and I had a fun time whipping it up, and it tastes great. It is the most moist chocolate cake I have ever made from scratch.
