Loved this simple way to prepare acorn squash.  I wondered what the crush saltines would do texture-wise to this dish.  It baked up crunchy, chewy, sweet, salty and delicious.  Due to a time crunch, I started the squash in the microwave with the cavities filled and microwaved for about 6 minutes.  This made my small halves almost completely cooked.  I then put them in a toaster oven at 350Â° to finish baking, about 15 minutes.  My son ate the second half for his lunch the next day and I received a text that read "That squash was awesome!"  Yep, that pretty much summed up the taste of this squash - awesome!

Exactly what I wanted!
I made it twice, the second time I increased the amount of saltines and I also added walnut pieces. Delicious.
Thanks!

It was good.  I think next time I will reduce the butter.  It seem at little much.  I will make this again.
