I really enjoyed these hamburgers, i did however change a bit. I added 1/2c. Water, Used more bacon bits, And instead of onion i put onion powder. They were wonderrrful, My family loves them. I'll definitley be making these again! Thank you for the recipe.

I will say that I could tell there was bacon bits in the meat because it was a different texture but I couldn't really taste it.  So I am going to try it w/o the breadcrumbs and egg next time.  And I will add 1/2c of water to make them more juicy.

My kids and I thought these were great however my husband didn't care for them. He thought they were like meatloaf on a bun as said by other reviewers. I agree they did taste a little meatloafy but I like meatloaf, what can I say. I'll make these again when my husbands not around. Great topped with cheese sllces!

Good meatloaf sandwich recipe. Next time I'll add catsup to it. I don't eat garlic, so left that out. I'll use freshly fried bacon for more bacon flavor.

This recipe was alright; overall, it wasn't quite moist enough and the bacon was difficult to detect under the flavor of the onion.  There are definitely better burger recipes out there.

These had a nice flavor and were meatloafy/salisbury steak-like in texture. I eyeballed the garlic salt and was afraid of going overboard so I was sparing I guess as my husband said they needed something more for flavor. And I said, maybe garlic salt? And he said yes that would help. So next time more garlic. Good burgers Lea and definitely 3.75 stars for these!

I thought these were good.I added onion powder instead of onion raw and added pepper,I went light on the garlic but next time I won't because it could have used more. Overall much better tan a plain hamburger!

Too much like meatloaf on a bun for us.  Will continue with seasoned meat and top with bacon strips.

Excellent Recipe! After combining all the ingredients, I let the burger sit in the fridge covered so all the flavors blend together. My husband loved it! My son who is a picky eater  loved it, too!

When I first saw this recipe, I thought it rather strange with the egg and bread crumbs.  But I gave it a shot and think it's excellent.  The burgers smell soooo good on the grill!

Growing tired of the same old hamburgers I decided to give this one a whirl. Yummy! I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs. I really liked the incorporated bacon bits. I was scheptical at first, but it all worked out in the end. Dee-lish!

I skipped the bread crumbs and used salt, paprika and dry garlic for the seasoning. Also, I used double the quantities but only one egg for 3lbs of meat. The result was phenomenal.

We will be making this burger recipe again, although we did omit the bread crumbs and egg and added  2 Tbs of Worcestershire sauce, and 1/2 C water that helped with the burgers being so moist. My husband really loved these burgers. We also cooked 6-8 min. on each side. Although I will add more garlic salt than we did, It still tasted great.

We thought these hamburgers were great! The bacon and onion added a nice texture and flavor to these burgers, and definitely made them better than ordinary burgers. All three of our boys enjoyed these too, even the one that is usually not much of a meat eater ate almost all of his. A lot of times when we make hamburgers we have a hard time getting them to stay together on the grill, but these weren't a problem at all. The combination of bread crumbs and egg was exactly right to keeping them together. Great recipe and we will be making again. Thank you, LMORTER!

This burger has a really good flavor.  The only thing I changed was using real bacon instead of bacon bits and   I will definitely make again.

This recipe is, by far, the best hamburger's recipe I have ever made.
