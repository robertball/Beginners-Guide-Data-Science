FAB! I have made green beans like the this forever.  The only thing I do differently is I rinse my beans a couple of times and it helps get the taste of the can away from them..They are really, really good.

This is my recipe so of course I am going to give it a 5. I have noticed some people saying that it was too salty. If you are going to cook the beans for more than 20 minutes try using salt free green beans or add water throughout the cooking process. These are "easy" homestlye green beans. The recipe I submitted was for a great side in little time. You can cook them for hours you will just need more beans, water, boullion and be sure to taste them throughout the cooking process.

I substituted chopped ham for the bacon.  I let the ham, and onions simmer a while in the liquid from the beans with the bouillion. When the onions were cooked then I added the green beans.

Always rinse your cans of green beans! It takes out the can-y taste.

These were very quick and easy to make and tasted great!  I used fresh beans instead of canned.

I was very surprised by this recipe. It was easy, cheap and very tasty. I doubled the recipe and added more chicken bouillon and onions (frozen chopped onions). Simmering is what brings out the flavor. Went great with a beef tenderloin and potatoes I prepared. Will make many more times I am sure.

These are good. I doctor these up with a touch of bacon fat, salt, pepper and garlic and/or garlic powder. Let simmer a good while for best taste.

Good but still tasted like green beans out of a can. I like the cooking style so I'll still give it 5 stars because this will be good with thawed frozen green beans or fresh ones. Thanks.

So easy & very good!  Tastes like Grandma's beans she'd cook all day long.  YUM!  I had to more than quadruple the recipe for the party I was serving them at.  I would suggest reserving the liquid from the cans of beans and then adding in what you feel necessary.  Mine were a bit soupy.

These beans were flavorful & tasted like they sat on a stove cooking all day.  My kids loved them & so did my husband. This is a keeper that I'll use for those quick suppers that I need to put together at the last minute.  By the way, I used no salt added green beans.

Used fresh haricots verts rather than canned green beans and shallot rather than onion.  Boiled the haricots verts about 5 minutes, then immediately transferred them to an ice bath.  Meantime, I sauteed the bacon, shallots and some minced garlic, then added the haricots verts just long enough to heat them through. Didn't use the bouillon.

This is how I've made green beans for years; I learned it from my mother-in-law. They are delicious and always the first thing on the table to go. It is key with canned green beans to drain and rinse them well to get rid of that canned taste. I just add about a can of water to make up for the lost liquid.

I would have given it 10 stars if I could!  Yum!!!  I pretty much followed the recipe, only modifying slightly.  Here's what I did.  I used very meaty bacon.  I used a whole sliced onion. I rinsed the beans and discarded the liquid.  After adding the beans to the onions and bacon, I added about 1/4 c water and sprinkled with about 1/3- 1/2 a seasoning packet from Top Ramen.  I tried it twice.  We liked the beef packet better than chicken.  SOOOO yummy.  I don't think I'll ever make the traditional green bean casserole with cream of mushroom soup (which I LOVE by the way) again because this is so much better.  Thanks Jenn

To get rid of the canned taste, one really does need to rinse the beans a couple times draining  out of canned liquid and cook in chicken or vegetable broth or use Goya Ham seasoning for a real southern taste. Using broth reduces the sodium content that bullion cubes have.

Easy dish to make and who doesn't love bacon. I used frozen green beans instead of canned, so I added about a half cup of chicken broth to compensate for the water you'd get out of the can. I made my broth using some chicken base, so I left out the bouillon cube. Didn't feel it needed it. Also couldn't help it... I had to add some fresh chopped garlic. Everyone liked them and I served them along side some sauerkraut and kielbasa. Thanks for the recipe.

Made this a while back and forgot to review it.  I thought that it was pretty easy and good.  I used the powderd chicken bouillon and it seemed to have pretty good flavor.

If I could give this a ten I would! I made this for Thanksgiving and my husband and kids LOVED IT!! My husband said that noone can make green beans like his mother. That hers have such amazing flavor to them. After he tried it, he was in shock! He said they were better than his moms and he didn't think that was possible! He like it so much, he said I should get the recipe tattooed on my arm so I never loose it. Just so you know, I'm not doing that. LOL
That  is the ultimate compliment! Thanks for the amazing recipie.

Delicious! I used a 28 oz. can of beans. I doubled the bacon as well but drained off the grease before cooking the onion since it was way too much and the recipe turned out great. Otherwise it would have been too greasy. Will make again my family loved them!  Thanks for sharing,

I would hate to count the sodium in this recipe.  Canned beans, bouillon cube and bacon.  Don't try it if you are concerned about your sodium intake.  Unfortunately, foods high in salt are tasty.

This is for those who thought the beans tasted like the can.  Just add a tsp of brown sugar per can  You'll never know that they're not home canned green beans!  Also try cooking them with jowl bacon (available at all supermarkets).  The old fashioned way of cooking!  Don't use the whole piece, it doesn't take a whole lot to flavor the beans.

These certainly were good. You would never know they were out of a can. I used precooked bacon and dried minced onion (about 2T). There were no leftovers and The Hungry Teen had seconds saying, "You know Mom, green beans are my favorite vegetable ever". Yeah, they are really good this way. Tastes like you spent all day in just minutes.

Best green beans i have ever had. They really did taste like the ones my great grandmother made when i was young, and so easy. My 80 year old Father In Law raved about them and asked what I did to them. He was surprised when I told him and how simple it was. Do rinse the beans before cooking. It really makes a big difference in the taste. I also used bacon pieces from a jar ( not bacon bits ) to cut down the time of frying the bacon.

This is a very good recipe.  I followed it exactly as written with exception that I used dried minced onion with a little onion powder, instead of raw onion.

These were fantastic! My whole family loved them. As someone raised on heavy, southern cooking, I was glad to find a recipe that reminded me of my grandma's, but with half the time involved. They were incredibly salty due to the bullion, but still very good. Next time, I might settle for using half a cube of bullion instead.

Made this super easy recipe for a family dinner.  Everyone loved it.  I was glad as I do not make green beans often since my husband does not like them.  As others stated I did not use the water in the can, but added my own.  They did not taste like canned greens.  i will be making this again.

This was just the recipe I have been looking for!  Even better actually because it was so easy.  Next time I will try making it with the no salt added green beans because it was a little salty, but great homestyle flavor!

Using the canned beans I had to rinse the canned taste off then I made a few changes by adding virgin olive oil to the skillet so the beans wouldn't get to dry or soggy I omitted the bouillon the bacon seemed to add enough salt. I also added fresh garlic along w/ the onion.  Would def make again!

Too salty.  This would probably be better if made with fresh green beans instead of canned.

Very good recipe! I took the advice of others and started with "no salt added" green beans to reduce the salty flavor of the dish.  I used veggie boullion because that's what I had on hand and I doubled the recipe otherwise I followed it exactly and everyone loved them.  They only get better as leftovers!

Easy to make; we thought it tasted better after sitting in the frig for a day. Unsalted beans might work a little better.

Pretty good grean beans, but not the flavor I was going for. I used frozen green beans that I had boiled a little, so I added the boiling liquid. Maybe too much? After simmering for 1.5 hours, I didn't have much bacon or onion flavor, just the grease.
Dinner guests seemed to like it. I thought it kind of tasted like a blander version of Cracker Barrel's green beans with all the grease. My favorite green bean recipe on this site is still the "Best Green Beans".

Loved that can beans could taste so good. Made it once by the recipe, then made it to better suit my needs. Rinsed beans. Added 1 tsp minced garlic to onions. Removed crispy bacon from the pan and added at the end. Used 3/4 cup chicken broth instead of bullion. Rave reviews!

I used 1 12oz bag of green valley frozen steamers (cooked per directions on bag) and thought this was good but agree with other reviewers that it was a bit too salty. Next time I may either add more green beans or cut back to 1/2 or 1/3 of the bouillon cube.   Next time may also add a dash of garlic powder along with black pepper.

Made these tonight with Garlic Mashed Potatoes Secret Recipe. I used fresh green beans but otherwise followed as instructed, and they only came out OK. Will try again and adjust rating as necessary. Thanks to OP and other reviewers for contributing:)

Delicious. My husband could not believe how tasty these turned out. He recommended we add them to our family Christmas Dinner menu (over his slow-cooked green beans and my au gratin broccoli/cauli bake). I didn't have bacon on hand (but I did have bacon grease). I cut up some ham lunchmeat and fried it with the bacon grease and the onions. I also used fresh green beans, following the poster's recommendations. We all had multiple helpings. Thanks you for the great recipe! We are trying with turkey bacon, tonight.

This remains the best recipe, I add 1/4 tsp. coarse black pepper for that "Indiana Church Supper" taste I grew up with. I double the recipe and freeze individual servings to take for lunch. They freeze well.

This is a pretty good recipe. I like to add potatoes tho which take away alot of the salt and leaves the flavor. Then you can salt to taste.

These are excellent.  I have been making a similar version for years.  I never put in chicken broth before and I always do it in the microwave.  I make this type of green beans for every holiday or occasion when we have a get together; almost everybody loves them.

I didn't change a thing. I used green beans without salt. It was delish. I followed the advice of another user and washed the green beans to get rid of the can taste. My son (10 years old) devoured them.

My family LOVED these! I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 a can of beef stock, since I didn't have chicken boullion. I simmered them for 1 hour. They tasted like they cooked all day. My 6 year old ate 3 helpings!

Delicious! I used fresh green beans; cut off the sides and boiled for six minutes,saved a little boil juice, and then added to the bacon and onion mix. The bouillon really adds the perfect flavor for these green beans! Very easy for such wonderful flavor! Can't wait to make these again!

I'm giving it 4 stars as I didn't make exactly as written, although rates as 5 stars with us.  I omitted bacon and used chicken broth instead of boullion.  Tasted a lot like the traditional green bean casserole, without all the calories.  Will definitely make again.

These green beans were yummy and my husband prefered them to the recipies with fresh beans.  The only problems I found was that after the 15 minutes, the greenbeans were breaking up and there was still quite a bit of liquid in the pan.  Next time I will add less liquid and try cooking it for less time.  But I will definitely make again.

I didn't have any bacon on hand so I tried this with Bacon Bits... it was really good. My husband, who hates green beans, even admitted they were much better!

Not too bad.  Just a little too salty for us.  Tried it a second time, drained the green beans and then used water in place of the liquid.  Tasted less salty.  Thanks for sharing.

this recipe is AWESOME!!!! I omitted onions, used frozen green beans (boiled, then drained), used almost a whole can of chicken broth for liquid, and sprinkled the boulion on top. I've NEVER liked green beans, but loved these--and my friend who's always loved them, said they were the BEST he's ever eaten. THANKS!!!!!!

I made these per recipe and then with my preferences.  I know for the quickness, definitely canned beans, rinsed.  But having the time and prefer, I used fresh beans, used a ham hock and chicken broth, did add a bit of bacon. Always add a little garlic, a pinch of brown sugar.  I tend to stay away from bouillon, but in a pinch would use Goya ham.  With the changes they were beyond excellent.

I loved it but I made some slight changes: instead of bacon I used turkey deli slices(all I had in the fridge). I also added some complete seasoning and instead of water I used chicken broth for more flavor! my bf loved it! Next time will definitely try it with bacon! I also added 1/4 of the chicken bouillon only because the chicken broth added and the complete seasoning already added a lot of flavor to it!!

Loved this! So simple and really spruces up a side dish when you only have time to use a can of veggies. Only thing I changed is I added some minced garlic and pepper. Amazing, thank you for the recipe.

These were so good. But I would cut back on the bacon or bouillon because I found this to be a tad on the salty side and I love my food salty.

This is the best recipe I've found for canned green beans. It's simple, quick and easy to make. I changed two ingredients to cut down on the amount of salt: I used turkey ham instead of bacon and eliminated the chicken bouillon. My husband (who basically hates veggies)  liked this side dish.

These were good, but nothing special (IMHO).... I hosted Easter dinner this year. I needed to find a side that involved little prep since I had to devote most of my time and energy to the ham and other sides I was preparing. I had all of the ingredients on hand (except for the green beans - go figure!), so I opted for this recipe. Everyone really enjoyed these (including my mom and my bf, a confirmed canned green bean HATER!). I wanted a second helping (mainly, because I didn't care for the ham), but there were none left! I forgot to rinse my beans (many reviewers warned about saltiness), but despite this, I didn't mind. I would make these again, but only for special occasions. Thanks for sharing!

I fry the bacon a little crispy and break them up more before adding the rest. Even my one year old eats them.

These are very good and easy to make. I made them for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them! You can adjust the onions and bacon to your taste as long as you make sure you adjust your seasoning to match. I cooked them in a crockpot on low for a good while and upped all the ingredients. Great recipe!!!

These were good, but WAY too salty. I didn't have any bacon so I sauteed the onions in olive oil, and added Hormel Real Bacon Bits (about 2.5 tbs). They reminded me of how I ate green beans as a kid. Nobody really got enough, and I really wish I'd made two cans of green beans. My toddler even ate them! Next time I will use low sodium green beans. Thanks for sharing.

Love these beans!!!  I tripled the recipe and added mushrooms for Christmas and placed them in a crockpot.  I used the chicken granules which makes it 
easier.  To off set the salty taste I just added water until it tasted perfect!  YUMMY!!!

I modified this a little.  I had turkey stock handy, so substituted that for the bouillon.  I used more bacon and onions because I like them.  Turned out super.  Couldn’t be quicker or easier, my kind of recipe.

Really liked this...something different.  I do agree with previous reviewer that it is a bit salty.  Thanks for the post.

The bouillon cube made this quite salty.  I might try this again with more beans using fresh blanched beans.

This was a very salty recipe.  Next time I try it, I will substitute chicken stock instead of the chicken boullion.

Great recipe. It was so easy to acheive such amazing flavors. I let it simmer for about an hour and a half...I used "no salt added" canned green beans & it still came out a little too salty.  Also, next time I would cut the bacon in bigger pieces, so I could remove them from the beans when ready to serve.  We thought the bacon gave it great flavor, but there was too much of it to sort through - to get to the beans!

They do taste like my grandmother's beans that took her all day to cook.  Quick and easy- didn't have any bacon so used turkey smoked sausage instead and these were fantastic!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good. I used beef bouillion cube and frozen french style green beans, cooked them in microwave first then added to pan. My 2 year lod loved them as well. This is a keeper.

I wanted something special besides steamed beans at thanksgiving so I made this... and while they were simmering, I couldn't keep my fiance's hand out of the skillet. He kept sneaking "testers". Differences are that I had frozen beans andI used homemade turkey stock for the juice, so I omitted the boullion. A keeper!

This was just very OK for me.  My husband thought there was too much bacon (which isn't the type of thing you'd normally expect him to complain about).  I don't think you're going to fool anyone that these are from a can.  I guess this is an easy way to fix up canned grean beans.  I just wasn't particularly impressed.

This is an awesome quick and easy recipe. I made this with mashed potatoes and fried pork chops and my boy friend gobbled it up. Next time I might get frozen beans so it tastes less "canny," even though it tastes great the way it is. PS- it much better the next as leftovers!

Altered a little instead of bacon I used some ham trimmings and it was a hit.
