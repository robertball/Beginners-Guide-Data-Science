Because I am a fan of red wine I had to try this recipe. It is OK. The baking time was right on though you need to be careful with chocolate cookies because you can't tell if they are browning correctly. Baked at the longer time they come out crisper for a while but eventually they turn kind of soft like those baked at the shorter time. The smell of the wine is apparent in the beginning but that dissipates. This is an interesting concept and would be an interesting nibble at a wine-tasting party.
