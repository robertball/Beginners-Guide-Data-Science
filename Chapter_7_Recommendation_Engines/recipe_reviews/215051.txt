This is a quick and easy to prepare dessert that calls for just a few, simple ingredients and yields delicious results with a beautiful presentation.  Nice balance between the banana and orange flavors, with just the right hint of butterscotch flavor from the brown sugar. We'll make this again when the need for an instant gratification dessert strikes, tho’ next time we both agree we’ll add a little more sugar as it wasn’t quite sweet enough for us.

Recipe Group Selection:  31, May 2014 ~ A quick dessert that is different from common desserts.  The syrup has a nice flavor with the juice from the orange added. I did toast the almond slices and the crunch was a nice contrast to the ice cream and the bananas.

A very easy, perfect dessert for our Valentine's Day.  Made exactly as written; but used crushed walnuts in place of the optional almond slices.  Will make this again; it is a keeper for me!!  Thanks, PAMELA D, for sharing.

Recipe Group Selection for May 31, 2014 – I’m a little behind at getting to this recipe group selection, but I’m so glad I finally made it because it is a wonderful dessert.  Fast, easy, and delicious.  I also toasted the almonds as others had recommended.

Elegant, simple and easy dessert which we enjoyed very much.  I followed the submitter's advice and toasted the almonds.  I also added a pinch of cinnamon and garnished with a cherry and chocolate mint. Thank you, Pamela D. aPROpos of nothing for sharing your recipe. Glad I voted for this Buzz Group Recipe selection on May 31, 2014. It is a keeper!!

I really enjoyed this "Skinny Foster." I made a dairy-free (vegan) version with coconut oil (instead of butter) and coconut ice cream and reduced the sugar. Thank you PAMELA D. aPROpos of nothing for sharing your recipe.
