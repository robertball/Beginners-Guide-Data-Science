Snow day (and the cover of allrecipes magazine) inspired me to bake donuts.  I say "inspired" especially because I made plenty of my own mods:
* 1/3 whole wheat flour * scant 1/2 c brown sugar + scant 1/2 c white sugar * 1/2 c applesauce + 1/4 c melted butter to cut down on fat *  2 whole eggs

Then baked as written, just till they sprung back to the touch.  These were AMAZING.  EXTRAORDINARILY tender.  I glazed half of them with a simpler maple glaze: ~1/4 c powdered sugar + 1 splash of pancake syrup + 1 splash of milk.  I will be making these LOTS AND LOTS.

I made these in muffin tins. Mini size tins & standard tins lined with paper. They are delicious. Taking two dozen to church with me tomorrow. My husband loved them!

I screwed this up.  Next time mix together dry ingredients and the liquid ingredients in separate bowls and then combine.  Also, add the egg YOKE, not the white.  Don't take phone calls from your mother-in-law while baking, and make your husband help.  I used mom's doughnut pan, which was likely 1/2 as deep as the recipe calls for. It made 18 tasty doughnuts.  15 min was not quite long enough. I would cut the glaze in 1/2 next time and not let it cool--it was very difficult to frost the doughnuts with hard glaze.  A great recipe despite my numerous deficiencies.

These doughnuts are AMAZING!  They are good with or without the icing, but the icing puts  it over the top!!  I didn't put any pecans on  mine and they are divine without!  
It did take a little longer than 3 minutes to brown the butter, but we got there and the end results are delicious!

Yummy donuts!  Be sure to mix all dry in one bowl and all else in another and just fold in dry until white of flour is gone. I used a baggie to pipe batter into donut pans...3/4 full for perfect size, and sprayed with Bakers Joy prior. I baked 14-15 mins and let cool 5 mins in pan before flipping over onto cooling racks.  For glaze it takes about 5 mins for butter to brown...I omitted the br sugar. Spooned about 4 tsp over a donut then pecans quickly. Had to make another batch glaze. This was my first attempt at donuts...fun!  Got great pans on Amazon...Wilton..2 six donut ones, non stick. Perfect pans!

Followed the recipe as is, I ended up with 12 doughnuts and 5 cupcakes. Enough frosting for all too. They’re moist and delicious, and the frosting is perfect! I’m taking them to game night at church.

Oh my Lord! These are absolutely scrumptious!  I had to make them into cupcakes because I did not have the doughnut pans.  I filled the cupcake spaces 3/4 of the way and I baked them for 21 minutes at 350.  They came out wonderfully soft and decadent.

I didn't have the doughnut pan so I baked in my brownie pan.  Everyone loved them - even my cousin who was visiting and doesn't like pumpkin.  She took only half so as not to offend me and then returned for the other half!  Delicious flavor - moist cake - as satisfying as a doughnut without the frying!

Delicious and moist! I have made these twice, first time I forgot to put the pumpkin spice in - so I sprinkled a bit on top which was good for the senses when u ate it. So on second batch put 1 1/2 t pumpkin spice in the mix and sprinkled the rest on top of the icing. Do the icing quickly as it will seize up. Also learned to put icing then pecans then sprinkle with spice. Yesterday sprinkled spice and tried to put pecans on but icing too hard by then to stick- lesson learned. We love with or without icing. Thanks for great recipe!

Great little cake donuts, enjoyed by my daughter, husband, and me. It was hard to stop eating them! Very quick and easy. I used powdered buttermilk, so that powder was mixed with the dry ingredients and the water with the other stuff. I found the icing difficult to frost with until I started rolling a ball in my hand and then flattening it, then laying it over the donut and taking out the center. Made sleek, smooth, professional looking donuts! Did not add pecans, but may try that some other time. Will definitely make again. YUM!

Found the glaze to be too sweet for the family, so added mini chocolate chips in batter, then made a coffee mocha buttercream icing for the top, then sprinkled with walnuts. The coffee buttermilk frosting recipe is on this site. This is a great pumpkin recipe! I made muffins too - just need to cook a little longer. Thanks for sharing!

The list of ingredients is very confusing. I put the 1/4 cup butter in the batter and didn't notice the 1/2 cup of butter until after they were baking. This is the first time I've ever baked donuts and they came out pretty good in spite of being a quarter cup short on the butter.

TOTALLY AWESOME!!!!   Made exactly as outlined in the recipe, except 2 very minor changes.  I used only 3/4 cup of confectioners sugar in the glaze, per our preference.  I also used 1 1/2 tsps of glaze on the doughnut.  THESE ARE DEFINITELY A KEEPER.  SOOOO VERY DELICIOUS!!!!

This recipe is simply fantastic! The texture is light and moist and the glaze is to die for! I guess I will be making these again as they have all disappeared! ??
