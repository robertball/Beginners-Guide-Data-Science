We had leftover chili, and my husband loves chili cheese fries so we just had to try this.  We thought the whole cheese sauce part was a bit uncalled for so we just made the fries as directed, heated up the chili and poured that over the fries.  We then took some shredded cheese (cheddar and sharp) sprinkled that over top and put the whole thing back in the oven until the cheese was melted.  We got out a couple of forks and couple of drinks and it was gone in no time......

Because I did not have enough cheese slices to make the cheese sauce for this, I went with Velveeta's Ultimate Queso (which is basically Velveeta melted with Ro-Tel). I used shoestring fries and homemade chili in this recipe. The boys thought that I was the best wife/mother ever. GREAT boy food and excellent for a mother who just wants to make a quick Sunday treat for her boys.

We love chili cheese fries. Instead of the whole process of making cheese sauce I just sprinkle Monteray Jack and cheddar cheese, crumbled up bacon and jalapeno peppers or green onions and throw it back in the oven until the cheese melts. Love it.

Great afternoon snack that held us over until dinner time. The only change I made was chili WITH beans because we love the beans. The cheese did however seem to get lost in the chili so I just added some shredded to the top along with some green onions and MMM MMM good!

I made fresh cut french fries but have made this in the past with frozen -- waffle cut are the best cause they hold the chili on better when eating, we also drizzle ranch dressing over them when they come out of the oven...we also use shredded cheese

The cheese sauce is very bland when made as stated.  I even added more cheese and it still wasn't good.  I recommend you use a prepared cheese sauce or just plain melted cheese.

Very yummy, didn't make the cheese sauce I had cubed cheese that you just melt in the microwave or on the stove top and you can use the chili with or with out the beans per peoples preference.

Very good. I did mine with Frito cheese sauce, you just nuke it to get it warm, and the canned chili, frozen fries, and sprinkle some cheese on top, Yum!

We made these using S & W chili mix and fresh ground beef, adding extra chili powder and cumin.  Made cheese sauce with shredded colby-jack cheese instead of american.  The kids loved it! P.S.- I had mine over sweet potato fries for a bit of nutrition!!!

I used Ore-Ida tater tots (that I seasoned with salt and pepper and baked) and leftover homemade chili instead of the canned stuff. It gave me just the indulgence I was looking for this afternoon...thanks! :)

YUM! I also used prepared cheese sauce, chili WITH beans and I made homemade fries (only b/c I had no frozen or I would've used those). I added some shredded cheddar to the top just to 'hold' it all together. I think next time I'm also gonna add some onion and bacon too...mmmm! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a fun way to use up leftover chili. I didn't have any American cheese to make a cheese sauce, so we just put some shredded pepper jack on the fries while hot, dumped some re-heated chili on top, more shredded Colby-jack cheese, scallions and jalapenos. I know that changes the recipe some, but the idea of fries, chili and cheese is a great idea. My son and husband really enjoyed dinner. I would like to try it next time with some sweet potato fries.

After following the recipe, I gave it to my niece to sample it. She liked it, but when I tried it, I found it too bland to want to eat with the fries. I added sharp cheddar, queso, and salt. It tasted better afterwards. I guess I'm used to queso-style flavors now, because the queso really made it better.

Use real cheese if you are going to go through all the trouble of making a cheese sauce, not processed cheese. Don't need a sauce anyway. It is too runny. Just cook some fries, any kind you like. Then make any type of chili you like. Then put some fries on a plate or in a bowl, cover with chili, and then put cheese on top and it will melt.  Real shredded cheddar is best and it's cheap. Even velveeta is better than processed slices.

This was a wonderful idea.  I used leftover chili for ours.  What a great way to use up leftovers, so you don't get tired of eating it over and over.  I will make this again next time we have chili.
