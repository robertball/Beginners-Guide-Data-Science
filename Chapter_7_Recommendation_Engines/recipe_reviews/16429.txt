I've been doing ribs by this method for years and you appreciate it even more in winter where grilling 5-6 hr ribs is not an option.  (In winter, you would finish this recipe off topped with the sauce in a 450 degree oven instead of on the grill.)  A few suggestions from my experience.  I add a bit of liquid smoke to the vinegar mixture so that it permeates the ribs when baking (also throw in a few cloves of garlic, bay leaf, salt and pepper).  I take off the foil after 45 minutes of baking but continue baking until the yummy liquid evaporates(the flavor gets more concentrated in the meat that way).  The beauty is that this step can be done even a few days ahead.  When done baking, I just let the ribs cool and refrigerate until I need them.  Then, just take out 1 hr before party/ dinner, baste generously w/sauce and grill/ bake until nice in color.  Perfect for treating kids to their favorite dinner in the middle of the week even for a busy mom/ dad or for throwing a no hassle BBQ party.

Whole family just LOVED these!! I cut the recipe in half and only thing I changed was cooking method. I didn't grill them, after cooking them with water and vinegar for an hr. and making the sauce, I marinated the ribs in the sauce for about 1-1/2 hrs. Then baked them in the oven on 350 covered for 45min, then uncovered for 10min. They came out PERFECT!! Meat just about fell off the bone and the sauce is wonderful!! The hot pepper sauce was hardly noticed so I might add just a little more next time (hubby likes spicey foods). These would be excellent for a barbecue get together!!  Thanx for the great recipe!!  :)

I fancy myself a good bbq'er, and am always open to new ideas and techniques. My Dad taught me everything I know, and I've read and experimented like mad to get better. So when I sprung this little ditty on him, and his comments ranged from "You got a good scald on that!" to "Forward this recipe to me please? That was good!" I knew I had a winner! 
Given the time to do this properly, this stuff came out DELICIOUS!!!! Pork was just falling off of the bones! I used country style ribs, added 20 minutes on the oven time due to thickness of the meat, and added in about 1/4 cup more brown sugar to give the pork a sweeter, thicker taste. 

You cannot go wrong on this! Wonderful dish! Wow!

We loved this recipe, the ribs were tender and we like them that way! The only thing I changed was added a little onion powder to the sauce and a little bit more brown sugar. This was wonderful Boo! Thanks for sharing this! :)

Great to bake ahead of time and grill whenever the bbq was ready - after appetizers and drinks were going,so I could appreciate the guests.  Everyone wanted the recipe from the person in charge of the actual fire (the boyfriend).  Note:  behind every good man - he got all the credit but I got to relax let him enjoy the praise.  Got more ribs to make the next day.

The sauce for this recipe is fabulous! It was great to use everything right out of my pantry, I even added a little (2T) maple syrup to give a extra sweetness. I had bought some spare ribs on sale and wanted an easy recipe for them and this was it. My only complaint was the meat I bought was still tough after baking first for an hour, then grilling. We put the ribs back into a covered roaster pan, poured the remaining sauce over, then baked again for another hour at 300 degrees. YUM! YUM! I'm sure baby-back ribs are more tender to begin with than spare ribs.

FANTASTIC!!  My husband and I tried these.  They were wonderful and full of flavor.  We made 1-1/2 times the sauce for 8 lbs. of ribs.  Added a little more brown sugar.  After the required grilling time, my husband wrapped each rack of ribs in heavy duty foil and put back on the top grill to steam for a few minutes.  Let sit in the foil for about 15 minutes before cutting.  They were fall off the bone good!!  Being from the Lone Star State, I was a little skeptical about all the pre-cooking in the oven, but it was wonderful and didn't take 6-8 hours like we are used to!  Thanks Boo!

Finally a BBQ sauce that's not too vinegar-y!  I made boneless country ribs, and they were delicious!  The sauce is wonderful and could be used for many different dishes.  Thanks for a BBQ sauce that beats all others!

Super recipe! Like others I deviated a little from the recipe as published. To start with, the bbq sauce tasted a little too tangy for me so I added more brown sugar. Next I baked the ribs for one hour in the water/red wine vinegar. After removing the ribs from that liquid, I let them marinate in 2/3rds of the bbq sauce for 1 1/2 hours like someone else posted. I then baked the ribs for one more hour in the bbq sauce with a foil cover. Then kicked the oven up to 450 and baked the ribs for an additional ten minutes uncovered. They were so good and had the coloring was perfect. The ribs had great flavor and were very tender.

The sauce is the bomb!! Truly amazing. I would have suggested baking them at a lower heat for longer or marinating a while before baking to help with tenderizing.

These are the best ribs I have ever tasted. I cooked them in the red wine vinegar and water just like the recipe. I then baked them with half of the sauce covered for 45 minutes at 350. Then I added the rest of the sauce and cooked an additional 10 mins. uncovered. I did not have hot pepper sauce on hand but it was good without it. Will definitately be making these again.

I used pork spareribs for this and they were GREAT!!  Baked them for an hour and then grilled them.  Next time I think I will use two racks of ribs... so we have more leftovers (don't need to double the sauce though).  Hubby also suggested that next time I add a touch more spice to them.  But overall, very very good!

I read all the reviews...all of them....and not one of them warn you of the horrible awful smell that will invade your home...but don't be scared...it goes away and you are left with very yummy food! The smell does NOT linger or permeate your home. Only one person mentioned how yucky they appear when they come out of the oven...but again, don't be scared....once the basting and grilling is complete they are beautiful. Overall this is an excellent recipe and I will be using it again!

I modified this slightly, adding scotch and molasses were the main changes. I also baked the ribs longer than 45 minutes. I left them in the oven for about 1 1/2 hours.

This was fabulous, and flexible.  I didn't have any cider vinegar, so I substituted red wine vinegar with no problem.  Also, I'm not a fan of spicy stuff, so I didn't have any hot sauce in the house.  I did squeeze some honey into the bbq sauce.  I made half the bbq sauce and it was plenty for 3 pounds of ribs.  Because of my work schedule, I cooked as the recipe said for 45 minutes on 350, but I had to wait to put it on the grill.  So I turned down the oven to 200 and left the ribs in there, covered for probably 1 /2 to 2 more hours.  It worked fine.  When this came off the grill it was sticky, chewy, crunchy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside and absolutely NOT dried out!  PERFECT!!

I am giving this 5 stars only for the cooking method; I did not try the BBQ sauce yet.  I will try it next time and update my review.  I will always continue to cook ribs this way from now on.  I've finished them off on the grill and in the oven at 450.  Both ways work great.  When I did them in the oven, I saved the water mixture and used it for soup.  I refrigerated the broth overnight and removed the fat the next day.  It made GREAT soup.

Very, Very Good! I browned mine in a frying pan and towards the end I added the red wine vinegar and water, continuing to brown until I achieved the correct color. Then took the meat to a 6 quart pan and added the sauce, Covered with thin sliced lemons and cooked for 1 1/4 hours with the lid on in the oven at 350 degrees! Excellent!!!

These were the best ribs I ever made! Plenty of sauce too! I did cook these entirely in the oven since it's been like 9 degrees here in Buffalo but they were so darn good I never missed the grill flavor. I can only imagine how much better these will be in the warmer months when I can stand outside & grill. Thank you for an outstanding recipe!

These ribs were fall off the bone, can't get enough, GREAT!!!  Will definitely use this recipe often.  My only complaint was in regard to my hubby who misunderstood my instructions and put the bbq sauce mixture in the pan with the ribs so had no bbq to marinate with when grilling, but they were awesome without the sauce and my picky girls who won't eat bbq sauce, loved them.

I really liked this recipe. I added 1/2 cup Merlot and two cloves of garlic to the vinegar/water mixture, and marinaded it over night. The next day,I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Our guests are still talking about this meal.

AMAZING sauce!  I'm usually a bottled sauce girl, but I thought I'd give it a try.... I don't think I'll ever buy a bottle again!  It was well worth the little bit of effort!  Didn't use the hot pepper (don't like the heat) and used a bit of extra brown sugar.

These were good, but not fantastic.  Having never made ribs before I followed the recipe exactly... I used boneless pork ribs... maybe with a bone they'd be better.  Still found them kind of dry... The BBQ sauce was yummy though, but probably could have used just a bottle of any kind and it would have had the same results...

This recipe was good right out of the printer!  I have always basted my ribs in the vinegar solution in the oven, so that was pretty much a given.  This sauce is fantastic, although I am not a friend of spicy.  I made one batch spicy, and one batch for wimps like me.  The sauce is also fabulous for BBQ chicken, or brushed on burgers.  Haven't tried it on salmon yet.....hmmmmmmmmmm...

This was fabulous!  I followed the directions fairly closely, just utilized a few of the suggestions made by osorkin-added some garlic cloves and liquid smoke to the marinade.  Very, very tender ribs and sauce with loads of flavor.  We loved it and our kids (6 & 9) did as well.

These ribs were great.  They were juicy and tasty and did not take long to make.  The sause is probably one of the best ones that I have ever had.

Absolutely perfect!  My husband usually complains that bbq sauces are too sweet or too smokey but this one was just right.  This recipe will definitely be the only one I use for bbq from now on.  I have some left over sauce which I will use on grilled chicken tomorrow.

I tried to follow the recipe exactly, but of course, had to add just a little something extra. I added more brown sugar and used rice vinegar in the sauce instead of cider.  Ribs had an excellent taste but were close but not fall off the bone tender. I think next time I would bake a bit longer in the vinegar marinade and at a lower temperature first.  We loved them though and are a definite do again!  They looked picture perfect coming off the grill.

This is the BEST bbq sauce I have ever TASTED.  We used a smoker box with wood chips in the grill to give it that perfect smoked flavor.  I was shocked the ribs were so delicious with such a short cooking time, but they WERE!

Excellent and easy recipe.  I baked the ribs about 40 min. longer in the oven as I like my ribs tender.  I used to marinade my ribs with a rub over night and then bake them for 6 hours in the oven-that is A LOT more work than this recipe which turned out great.

Really a wonderful recipe!  I used a tad more brown sugar in mine as the sauce was a little too vinegarey for my taste... but the extra brown sugar took care of that. I've made this twice and it's a huge hit at our house.  I've passed it on to many friends.  Thanks!  Just know that the sauce is quite thin.

These ribs rule!  Guess I should have known by the name.  I had country style ribs so I cooked mine in the vinegar 20 minutes longer per another reviewer's suggestion.  Finished them in the oven with the heavenly sauce on 375% for 12 minutes each side.  My three year old couldn't get enough.  We will definitely make these again.   Thanks, Boo!

My guests thought I had slaved all day and couldn't believe I made BBQ sauce from scratch. I didn't tell them how incredibly easy this delicious dish was to make! Prep time is very quick, but you have to stick around for an hour to stir the sauce occasionally as it cooks.

Definitely a 5 star recipe based on the cooking method only.  I've been making my ribs this way for a number of years, but with different ingredients.  This way is much more economical and the end result the same.  Just one small change on my part, oven temperature was lowered to 300* and baked for approximately 2 hours.  I will try the sauce at another point in time, however your favorite BBQ sauce will do just fine.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, MYSST. Excellent.

This recipe was good but I had to change several things. I used country style spareribs so I doubled the cooking time. The sauce tasted too much like vinegar after simmering for a half hour, so I added more hot sauce, more brown sugar and honey. I also added seasonings to give it spicier taste. I grilled the ribs on an indoor grill and just long enough to get grill marks. After all the changes, it was much better. If I used this recipe again, I would definitely cut down on the amount of vinegar.

What a great recipe!  I followed this recipe exactly and they turned out delicious!  I have never made ribs, so for a first try I was quite pleased. Not too big of a mess and the sauce was perfect.  Make sure you simmer the sauce for the full hour and it will come out a nice consistency.  I halved the recipe and it was enough for 3 adults, with side dishes.

I just finished with this recipe. I have to say some of the best ribs I have ever eaten.I was born in Fla and now live in NH . I remember that vinegar grilled sothern BBQ. MMMMMM so good. I only had one rack of ribs so I had plenty of extra sauce. In fact tonight I prepared some chicken in the exact same way and used the extra sauce. The chicken was not as good as the ribs but nothing is.

Perhaps this recipe would be great for those who need ribs on the same day (or within a couple of hours), but as far as great ribs are concerned, they fall short.  The flavor just does not permeate the meat enough to be great ribs.  Marinating for a significant time is a must!

On the other hand, I found the sauce to be delicious.  It certainly is a great finishing sauce.  Bravo to that!  Like a previous reviewer, I doctored it up with a bit of onion powder to perfect it, but do as you choose.

The author tells you to use baby back ribs.  I would recommend sticking to baby backs, and make sure that you peel the tough membrane off!  If you choose to use spareribs, cut the skirt running across the top of the meat.  That piece is pretty tough.

I'm going to try this recipe again, but this time with marinating.

Wow, these were delicious.  The only changes I made were,  I left my spareribs in the oven for an extra 20 minutes and  I thickened the sauce with 2 T. cornstarch.  We just prefer a thicker sauce.  Definitely will be using this recipe again and again.  Thanks for sharing.  Wish I could of given it ten stars.

Ok, I do not like vinegar based Bar-B-Que sauces at all. This was wonderful! Did not use my grill and baked it in the oven at 300 for 1 1/2 hours then   drained off the water red wine vinegar base and drenched it with the BBQ sauce and let it slow cook at a lowered the temp of 250 for 3 hours or so.
AMAZING! Left over sauce has been put in the freezer for future use. I will sooooooo do this again!

Very, very good!   The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the sauce is too tangy and vinegary as written.  I added a good sized glug of honey, and another large spoonful of brown sugar, and it was perfect. Yummy, fall off the bone goodness!

These ribs went so fast at our party that I didn't get any but hubby said 4 stars. Bought more ribs so I can do it again. I did the first part of cooking a few weeks ahead then popped in freezer in the sauce.

Wonderful - the best ribs recipe I have tried so far. Tastes almost the same as the ribs from our favourite restaurant. I did use a slow cooker for a couple of hours instead of baking the ribs but made the sauce as written. If you are looking for great ribs make this!!!

If you like a sweet & tangy BBQ then this is a recipe for you!  The sauce is not thick and sticky and coats the meat wonderfully.

This is a very versatile recipe.  I did not have all the ingredients and had to make some substitutions:  Chicken Worcestershire instead of regular Worcestershire, White Vinegar instead of cider vinegar, sugar and molasses instead of brown sugar.  The only regret I have is the Chicken Worcestershire.  Regular Worcestershire would have contributed more depth to the flavor of the sauce.  But despite that regret, the sauce was very yummy indeed.

My only quibbles with the recipe are with the cooking on the grill.  Because the BBQ sauce has such high sugar content I would not advise coating the meat with sauce before putting it over the coals.  The sugar can easily burn.  Also, the cooking time on the grill is too long (or my coals were way too hot.)  I would keep an eye on the ribs and pull them once they browned to your taste.  Generously apply the BBQ sauce after the ribs are finished cooking.  If you would like to caramelize the sugars in the BBQ sauce, let each side cook for a minute or two but watch closely to prevent the sauce from charring.  

I will make this recipe again.

AWESOME!! That is what it is! It is now a permanent family favorite. I had some fun and added a 1/2 cup honey and two tsp cornstarch with two tsp water and it gave it zing! The consistency is perfect. I am so glad to have found this recipe. It is also perfect on chicken as well!

Really easy-to-follow and even easier if you use store bought BBQ sauce.  I like to substitute Balsamic vinegar, but would encourage everyone to experiment with your favorite flavoured vinegars.  It gives the ribs a great taste.

This is the most AMAZING Bbq sauce I've ever tried.
I hate using the bottled stuff with all the high frutcose corn syrup in it, but every time I try making my own sauce, my husband asks for the bottled stuff. THIS sauce IS OUTSTANDING! The only thing I did different was use maple syrup instead of brown sugar.

These are amazing! I chose the hottest day of the year to make ribs, and I wasn't about to die outside grilling, so I just baked them.  Heeded the warnings about them being "Too Vinegar'y" and only filled the 1/3 measuring cup about halfway with the Red Wine Vinegar. In the water / vinegar mix, I added 2 bay leaves and garlic powder.  (Baked just short of 2 hours, uncovering after an hour and basted a couple times).  For the sauce, I also cut the white vinegar to about 1/3 cup, used SPICY BROWN mustard, and instead of hot pepper sauce, I used a pinch of Penzey's Hot Cajun season, then added 2 tbs honey.    Baked for about 45 minutes more, basting a couple of times with sauce (and added a bit of Famous Dave's Rich & Sassy, as well).  WILL MAKE AGAIN!!!

OMG! (Oh my gosh!) No wonder this recipe has a 5 star overall rating!  I didn't have all of the ingredients, or even a BBQ for that matter, but the reviews sounded so good, I made it anyway.  Had to use balsamic vinegar and water instead of the red wine vinegar but baked the ribs as described otherwise.  I also didn't have the sauce ingredients so used a favorite bottled brand.  And, last but not least, I donn't have a BBQ so put the sauced ribs bake into the oven for 30 more minutes.  But the thing is, it's all about baking the ribs with the vinegar/water combo!  It makes them so tender, but yet toothsome, and you can do anything you want after that.  They are fabulous!

These are the BEST!!!!
I have made these many times with great results everytime.  Yes, the suace is thin and not a thick sweet barbecue sauce, but it is so delicious when made with baby back ribs.  Follow the recipe and perhaps leave in the oven a few minutes more.  Then put on the grill. I make these on a gas grill.  They fall off the bone and they are not "chewy" at all.......melt in your mouth actually!

I was really disappointed with this recipe.  It ended up being just okay.  The auce was way too thin and tangy for my taste.  The meat turned out pretty good, but I just expected so much more, especially after reading the other reviews.  Sorry.

This was my first attempt at making ribs, and I was afraid my husband was going to eat the bones.  They were absolutely delicious.  The sauce was exactly how I like it, not to sweet and not to sour.  I followed the recipe, it works great.

Great recipe and very easy. I was pressed for prep time so I cheated and used a bottled sauce. I will make again and try the recipe for the sauce as I am sure it is delicious. Served with sausage and sauerkraut in the slow cooker, succotash, mashed potatoes, and a green salad for a Labor Day BBQ.

Very good flavor - I only used one small change.  I poured a can of root beer over the ribs before baking insead of the water and vinegar.  I got this idea from a pulled pork recipe I made a few weeks ago and they were very flavorful

These were simple to make and my family seemed to like them pretty well. I think they like a thicker barbecue sauce, but other than that, they were good. Thanks!

Made this for the family this last weekend. Ribs were a hit ! Only alteration I made was to add a bit more brown sugar to cut the vinegar in the sauce.

The Best!  I've cooked and rated 12 other rib recipes from this site and have given 7 of them five stars and this one joins them - my guy says that this is the best for a southern bbq flavor and I have to agree.  I followed the directions for the sauce exactly.  Since I wasn't grilling I followed suggestions of others.  I baked ribs for 45 minutes as directed.  Then marinated the ribs for 1 1/2 hours in 3/4 of the sauce, reserving some for basting. I baked ribs covered for 45 minutes, basting occasionally - broiled ribs for 10 minutes at the end.  We are having them again next week-end!  Thanks submitter!

The only bad thing about this recipe is that the ribs are gone too fast.  If the meat wasn't delicious enough, the sauce made up for it. We made double the sauce and saved it to marinade chicken, pork chops and other meat.  Definitely do this because it's even better after letting the flavors sit for a little while. 

I did take all of the advice of previous users by adding garlic, bay leaf and salt to the roasting with the ribs.  I also then put them in the oven at even lower temp and let them cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, threw them on the grill fully basted...the meat just fell off the bone.

Awesome ribs!  We were skeptical of the BBQ sauce, but when it was all done and on the ribs it was great.  I will probably use the sauce recipe for chicken in the future.  We will use this recipe again for sure!

yum yum yum. Like others, I didn't grill them, just baked them for about two hours in the vinegar/water and then another hour in the sauce. I also reduced the vinegar and it was still on the edge of being too vinegar-y. Very delicious!

I tried this recipe 2 weeks ago and was totally blown away! I have been searching for a "vinegary taste" sauce without having way too much and this was it!  We will be having this tonite for dinner and many more nights to come!

I have made these ribs twice now and both times they turned out wonderful. I made no changes to the recipe other than baking them for just a bit longer to ensure they are cooked and tender. Be sure to baste as recipe calls for - they are tangy just like we like them ~
Thanks for sharing!!

AWESOME! This was my first attempt at preparing bb ribs. This recipe is very easy and very tasty. Even my gfriend loved it. ( She's not a big ribs fan )

For the Sauce:
I left it simmer for 2 hours instead of 1 and added a 2 tablespoon of butter to thicken it a little.

I have also added 3 tablespoons of maple syrup to bring an additional woody kick to it.

TRY THIS, a day earlier bathe a wooden plank (20"x10")of any hardwood in water. (I use pine) Start the grill, place the plank in it for 10 minutes and then place your ribs on it for 7 minutes each sides. Then remove the plank and cook another 7 minutes on each sides directly on the grill. IT'S AMAZING !

Outstanding!  The sauce was good and we added a bit extra hot sauce.  I was skeptical when I took them out of the oven before basting on the grill because they didn't look that appetizing, but once the sauce was on them they were excellent and beautiful.

Really quite good. I added 1 tsp. cornstarch mixed with 1 tsp. cold watter to the boiling sauce to thicken it up.  Also, half way through the baking, instead of basting, I drained the vinegar and brushed on the bbq sauce for the last 20 minutes and recovered with the foil.  This infused the flavor of the bbq sauce into the meat much better.  The bbq sauce recipie makes enough for a second batch.  Kids and hubby loved it.

Loved these ribs.  I was afraid the sauce would be too vinegary but it was not at all.  I do not like sweet sauces and this one was perfect.  I finished mine off in the oven (because it was too hot outside to grill) uncovered basted in some of the sauce.  I cooked mine for a total of 1.5 hours just because I was  doing a double batch and potatoes so I felt they needed a little longer.

I have never liked ribs or anything else that is smothered in bbq sauce...Until now, I LOVE ribs! It's all because of this sauce! This sauce is soooo good and the ribs came out tender too. I'm going to try this sauce on chicken wings tomorrow and I bet it's going to be awesome!

Used this for my first time making ribs.  Turned out fantastically!  The BBQ sauce is amazing.  I did add a little local unfiltered mesquite honey as I like a sweet sauce.  I can't believe how simple and delicious this was!  I kept seeing recopies that took hours or even days to prep and cook.  These taste like you took all day to make them.

While the flavor was good, you just will not get tender ribs in 45 min plus some grill time.  I think I am spoiled with my 7 hour smoked ribs

This was SO much better than the "Barbecue Ribs" recipe I tried on this site.  This recipe is tangy and not TOO sweet, like the other recipe.  If you don't like "candied meat" then this recipe is for you.  Great base for the sauce, you can add whatever spices or heat you prefer.  I used raspberry red wine vinegar instead of cider. I didn't have cider vinegar and I wanted to get rid of the raspberry vinegar.  I added garlic powder, smoked paparika I bought from a gourmet store, and a few dried hot peppers. 
I also boiled the ribs for an hour and skipped the vinegar baking step. They were a hit with my family!  For those that complained the sauce is too thin, just simmer for awhile on the stove with no lid on the pan.  I changed a few things, but I'm sure it would still be great if followed exactly.  Thanks!

this was my first shot at ribs, I made them for the mother and mother-to-be on mother's day and they said that I was hosting the dinners from now on..lol..the only thing to note was that when I adjusted the recipe for 6lbs of ribs...the amount of BBQ sauce I made was waaaay more than we needed...I had no clue what to do will all that BBQ sauce!!! I double checked the recipe to make sure we weren't supposed to cook the ribs in the sauce, found out we weren't.  I used it to baste repeatedly and even put the ribs on a platter and then poured it over, and I still had more than half the amount...the food itself though was absolutly delicious

My boyfriend just wanted some direction as to how to bake the ribs before grilling so I searched for a recipe that would include baking them in the recipe.  This one was it!  I think we have been accidentally using apple cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar but it's still great.  He makes his own barbeque sauce, but I really believe the beginning baking process makes these ribs fantastic.

This was my first attempt at ribs and they turned out great!  I'm a bit of a rib freak.  The only thing that I changed was the bbq sauce.  But that's just my own personal preference.  Good recipe.

These were really good, however they were just a tad bit dried out.  Next time I probably won't leave them in the oven quite as long and will probably leave the lid up on the grill while they are cooking.  But all in all very good, we will definitely be making these again!

These are absolutely delicious!  Melt-in-your mouth.  In fact, they fell apart on the grill they were so tender.  A keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

Yummy and delicious!  My ribs were very thick, so it needed about 2 hours oven time to get tender.  I loved the sauce!  Not sure why some people had trouble with it being thin, if you simmer the full hour it thickens up quite a bit.  Finger lickin' good :)

I used this recipe for my first attempt at ribs. My boyfriend(who is particular about his ribs) and I loved them! I now make them all the time. I also make the sauce and pour over shredded, slow cooked pork to make pulled pork. Incredible!

great flavor.  since it was winter and we weren't grilling, i put 2.5 lb of ribs in the oven for 45min at 350 degrees and then dropped it down to 300 for another 2 hrs.  no great science to the time or temp, but they fell off the bone so it worked.  i had also covered the ribs with aluminum foil the whole time.

The BBQ sauce is to die for.  I've done the rib recipe twice in the oven. The first time it turned out great with the ribs extra tender.  The second time they were a little tough.  I plan to try them on the grill later to see how they turn out.  Last night I actually poached chicken breasts, pulled the meat, and then dropped the pulled chicken in the BBQ sauce that had been on the stove for an hour.  We made BBQ chicken sandwiches and they were awesome.

Fab, Fab, Fab.  These are the best ribs ever.  I have been trying alot of recipes and these are by far the best.  I had an appointment and left them in the oven about 45 min. longer than recipe said and they were falling off the bone.  It still worked.  My husband loved them.  I did add a little onion and garlic powder to the sauce.  Delicious!!!  Thank you for the recipe.

Tasty however a bit dry.  It may be me and not the recipe though that caused this.  I still have not mastered the art of making juicy ribs outside of the crock pot!

My mother was bugging me about how to cook the ribs she got, I found this recipe and I am very pleased! I didnt have 2 roasting pans, so I just cut the 2 slabs and put it into 1 pan with the vinegar mixture, added a bit of liquid smoke and basted a bit more often than once. The sauce was terrific! I was running low on reg. mustard so I substituted Stadium Ballpark Mustard (only made in Ohio)and also added liquid smoke. The sauce came out nice and tangy, but not too sweet or hot (Im a spicy lover but everyone here is not)
Used with a cheap cut of ribs so the meat wasnt as tender as I had hoped, but the way they were cooked made all the difference. My picky 6 year old even ate them. RAVE REVIEWS :)

I never made ribs before trying this recipe, but I followed the suggestion in OSORKIN's review to bake with added spices for 45min., then remove the foil and continue baking until the liquid evaporates. Hubby finished them on the grill the next day, and everyone raved!  Prebaking allows them to cook long enough so that they are not tough, as has been the case when our friends have tried making ribs at home!  A huge success for us with our guests!  Thank you for helping to make us look like amazing cooks!

I was looking forward to this recipe.  I feel a big let down.  My ribs turned out tough.  I've tried many rib recipes from this site.  I like vinegar but there was way too much!  The kids were saying it smelled bad.  The sauce did not thicken, it was runny and bland.  I think that seasoning the ribs, also maybe rapping them individually in foil would help the flavor and toughness issues.  Sorry... I generally hate giving bad reviews.  This one wasn't for us.

I use the bbq sauce recipe part of this recipe as my base. I add 2 tablespoons of honey, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, Minced onion and instead of the called for mustard I use 1 tablespoon of prepared ground mustard. This is a basic flavorful recipe

This was good.  I thought the sauce was a bit too sweet for my husband's taste but he didn't seem to think so.  Not sure I would make this again, the sause was a bit time-consuming and you can buy great BBQ sauce bottled these days.

Very tasty!  We made these on a dark winter evening so we didn't fire up the barbecue and just baked them for about an hour.  They turned out moist and full of flavor.

Delicious! My wife and I used this recipe (after much "barbecue ribs" online searching) for our first attempt at ribs. I must say they turned out better than I expected. Very tender and tangy. Will definitely use again!

We wanted ribs for dinner but all the recipes called for a number of hours to prepare...and we didn't have that.  I found this recipe in a pinch and gave it to my husband (the Grill Master) to make.  He was hesitant of making the sauce ("I can just regular BBQ sauce.") But I told him that the reviews were awesome so he gave in and made the sauce.
We just finished eating these ribs...and we LOVED them.  Not only that, but my husband is planning on making the sauce again and pulling some pork some time next week for pulled pork BBQ.  This is definitly a "do over"

I think reviewers on this site are sometimes way too generous with stars. IMHO, only a relative handful of recipes really deserve five stars. This is one of them.
Next time I'll cut down a bit on the brown sugar and use a bit more hot sauce to suit my taste, but it is outstanding as it is.

Made these for Father's Day and my husband and 21 month old loved.  I thought the sauce was great, but didn't think the ribs were very tender.  Will try other recipes, but this one is good and would recommend for first timers like me.

Very good and easily adaptable! I used less than three lbs and found 1/2 of the sauce to be plenty.  Otherwise, I followed ingredients exactly and LOVED them.  Next time I will play with the sauce a bit.  I encourage you to make it by recipe first though because it is awesome.

The sauce for this recipe is to-die-for!  I let it simmer longer to thicken it up, but it is just the right amount of tangy-ness for ribs.  This recipe takes some effort, but is great for a weekend barbeque.

This is a great sauce. This is the second time I have made it and this time I added 2 Tablespoons of dehydrated onions.  Made it even better.  I left tthe lid off the sauce pot and simmered for 40 minutes. The sauce was a great consistency.  Nice and thick. I will be using this often.

These turned out great. I had some thicker ribs so baked them for about 90 minutes at 300 degrees. Next time I'll stick with baby backs. Used my own sauce but will try this one next time. Will definitely make these again.

I have now made these ribs twice.  I think they are fantastic!  For the folks that say the sauce is too thin - simmer it uncovered instead of covered for part of the hour and it will thicken.  The left over sauce is great on anything bbq - chicken, salmon or whatever.  I bake the ribs for about an hour  and then grill them using indirect heat.  We serve them with just some homemade coleslaw - that's it, nothing else required!  Thanks Mysst, fantastic meal!!

So this is my second review - the first was based on how I think they would have tasted had I not burnt them to a crisp by using the wrong setting on my grill.  As I stated in my previous review, if you have a Weber gas grill, all cooking is done with the top down, direct or indirect heat.  This time I cooked them over medium indirect heat (instead of direct), and they came out perfect.  The sauce is delicious.  I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because even though they are tender and juicy, they don't "fall off the bone" the way many baby backs do.  I love when the meat just literally falls off leaving the bone clean.  But for a quick method, this recipe is definitely a keeper!

Although I agree with the sause being too thin by preference, that was easy to over come and I enjoyed the vinegar tang.  I will make again.

I am certainly in the minority but these turned out so tough they were barely edible.  Followed the recipe exactly and even tried cooking for an extra hour but still tough.  Sorry  - wonder if anyone else had this problem.

Best sauce I have tasted on ribs and very easy to make....We will make this again for sure.....Had a taste test against Sweet Baby Rays and even my girlfriends kids picked this recipe. This was my first attempt at Baby Back Ribs on the grill and I over cooked just a bit but the flavor was still wonderful....I did listen to other reviewers and added just a 1/4 cup more of the brown sugar but other then that I made it as directed....Thank you very much for posting!

Love the BBQ sauce, it has that traditional southern rib sauce taste.  It will smell a little vinegary until it's grilled, don't be discouraged, that goes away when it's cooked.  And the ribs turn out tender and moist.  Just perfect.

This is my first time cooking ribs and they were delicious.  I followed the recipe to the "T" and they were every bit as good as any restaurant.  I used about 3 lbs of ribs and it was enough for 2 of us.  The meat fell off the bone. My husband said this was going to be a recipe that we'll use again and again.

Fabulous! My first attempt at ribs and cooked them for my rib expert brother-in-law, and he raved!  All he's asking for x-mas is the recipe!  The ribs looked and smelled so good that even the familly vegetarian had one rib!  

Fall off the bone delicious! And easy!

Wonderful recipe. Instead of grilling, I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of liquid smoke into the sauce.I drained the vinegar liquid and baked the ribs in some of the sauce for 20 minutes, then ran them under the broiler. Delicious!

I made these last night using 2lbs of boneless country style pork ribs. I cooked them in the oven for 1 hr. and then dipped them in the bbq sauce while I was waiting until time to grill them.I dipped them again before charcoal grilling and again when I turned them! EXCELLENT sauce and overall flavor! We gobbled them up,even my 13yr old who had turned her nose up when I said that's what we were having for supper! I made the whole amt. of sauce even though I had 1/2 the amt. of meat and  froze the rest for later. I served them with fresh corn on the cob and scalloped potatoes!Let the sauce cook longer if you want ...it only gets better.

These ribs were awesome!!!! They were tender and moist.  I didn't have baby back ribs on hand so I used the country style ribs instead which have a lot of meat. I had enough to use on grilled chicken the following week. THANKS FOR A GREAT RECEIPE

This is wonderful!  The meat is just as tender as if you spent hours cooking it, and the sauce is probably the best I have ever made!!  It is absolutely worth a try!  Thanks for this new family favorite!

Scrumptious recipe!  I made it mostly as written with the addition of a bit of liquid smoke (per another’s review) in the water-vinegar mixture and about two tablespoons of pomegranate molasses in the bbq sauce. Sticky delicious!

this is a great recipe.  I used tomatoe paste instead of catsup. 
This BBQ sauce is just right not to sweet, I love the tang! My family and friends  loves it and wants me to make it often!

Love them.  Always a hit!  I add a couple of bay leaves and some liquid sauce to the vinegar mixture for the oven.  I make the sauce after putting the ribs in the oven so they cook longer than the 45 minutes suggested probably more like an hour and a half.  We haven't done them on the grill but pour the sauce on top of the ribs and pop them back in the oven for 30 minutes or so.  Excellent!

I was gonna send a photo...but there were only rib bones left! A HUGE hit! The BBQ sauce is awesome. Not sure I can ever use store bought BBQ sauce. Used country style ribs (cause I went shopping the day before Memorial Day, and no baby back ribs to be found). Cooked them 20 minutes longer than the recipe notes. Will definitely use this recipe again! Thanks

While the ribs were nice and tender the sauce was mediocre at best. I will not be making this again.

I've made a lot of ribs in my day and decided to try these because the weather was going downhill and I didn't want to spend a lot of time at the grill. These were absolutely delicious. I used the spare ribs and ended up cooking them about 2 hrs. at 325 degrees. With that sauce and a little grilling to get that char going, you can't go wrong. This is a keeper!

Really nice flavor.  I used TrialbyFire's cooking method.  Turned out very tender.  Wished I could have finished up on the charcoal grill, but was thwarted by pouring rain.  Next time

Superb and traditional, "fall off the bone" if you slow oven roast and then char, ever so slightly, over a low layer of hot coals! We added wood chips on the coals to give an even more rustic flavor!!

I have always been intimated to make ribs. Never did it. Avoided it. Love them but only get them in a bar or restaurant. This Father’s Day I broke out of my comfort zone, thanks to this recipe. Boom. Nailed it. Followed the recipe as is. Thank you, Allrecipes. My marriage is safe for another year - or more. Our 5 kids thank you.

Do not change a thing.  Such tender ribs every time.  I follow the cooking instructions to a tee.  If you’re short on time you don’t ya e to make your own sauce.

I was new at making ribs and chose this recipe as it looked so simple. I always thought it would take all day! This is so simple and delicious. It made so much sauce that we have grilled ribs three times already. I only wished I took a photo ! Fabulous!!!

Oh my word! My fussy family loved it! I will definitely make it again! I had a lot of drippings after cooking ribs in the oven with foil (way to much to just evaporate off) so I poured that into a can, and then I put that incredible sauce on and my husband barbecued them another 1/2 hour. PERFECT! Kids loved it too!

Wow, these are so good and so easy!  I used boneless pork ribs and they turned out great!  I only had to use one pan in the oven as they easily fit.  I did cook in the oven an extra 15 - 30 minutes,  just long enough for the barbecue sauce to simmer for an hour.  The barbecue sauce was slightly thin for my tastes so next time I will simmer it with the lid off.  My husband who is very picky, couldn't get enough! They grilled up to perfection, I basted about every two minutes.  Thank you, I plan on making these again and again.

We've made this 3-4 times now and it's great!!  If you like your ribs a little more tender give them about 10 more minutes in the oven. We usually baste & flip on low heat several times on the grill to really give it the deep flavor like it's been on the grill for hours.

Amazing!  Restaurant quality!  Definitely will make this again!  Start the sauce before you put the ribs in the oven, so it has time to thicken.

The first time I made these I followed cooking times exactly. They were horribly dried out and overlooked! Since I still had really ns of sauce I tried it again a couple of days later. This time I covered tightly with foil while baking. Then I cooked about 4 min a side on grill before adding sauce. I basted and turned them every 2 minutes for a total of  8 minutes. They were fully cooked but not dried out. I'd also recommend serving with extra sauce. Second go round was about 4 stars

The ribs did not fall off the bone or even close.  The sauce, however, was very good. It good thicker as it cooked.  I didn't put the lid on the sauce as it was bubbling like crazy on the lowest heat on my gas stove in my Allclad sauce pan...I stirred it periodically and it reduced.  Sorry, won't be making this again.

I’ve used this recipe for the last couple of years and will never stray from it. It is now requested by my friends, even when the cookout is at their house and I have to grill! The sauce is superb. The only thing I changed was temperature of the oven, and the bake time. I lower the temp. To 300 and I bake them for sometimes 3 hours (depending on the thickness of the meat on the ribs), and I turn them every 30 minutes in the process. Basically, I bake them until it’s obvious that much of the fat is cooked off. It’s a labor of love, but totally worth it! By the time they reach the grill, I’m really only keeping them on long enough to get a char on them. By then, they are pretty much falling off the bone. People can’t get enough of them. Thanks for such a great recipe!

great ribs. I used equal amounts red wine vinegar and water for the 1st step. I did remove the foil and left the ribs for 20 minutes to absorb the liquid. i grilled these guys at a lower temp and and while longer. the best ribs i have ever made and eaten. i'll lie in the future and say i came up with this recipe.....!

After numerous blasé responses after my attempts at cooking delicious ribs, these ones finally hit the mark. My husband told me I can make these as often as I like, which will be every time ribs go on sale!! The kids gobbled them up, too. We have also used the sauce on chicken and it's fantastic. It's company-worthy!!!

What an easy, superb recipe! I had all of the ingredients on hand and was able to make it in stages. I cooked the ribs (I used spare ribs) for an hour while simmering the sauce, then marinated for a few hours while we were out. Per another reviewer, I baked them an hour instead of grilling. Be sure to cover the roasting pan with foil before placing the ribs, or the sauce will burn and stick in areas. I will try grilling next time because I'm sure it'll add even more to the final flavoring. Lastly, I never know what to use for "prepared mustard".... is that yellow mustard? I used Stone Ground Mustard and everything tasted great.

I made these for a July 4th cook out for 15 family and friends.  It was unanimous that these were the best , most tender and juiciest ribs ever!  This is the only method I'll ever use for cooking ribs!  The only change I made was to the BBQ sauce.  I am not a fan of sweet BBQ sauce, so I omitted the brown sugar and substituted Woody's Cooking Sauce for the ketchup.

I placed the ribs in a pressure cooker on low for 50 minutes.  Then grilled.  It was the perfect tenderness.  I used baby back ribs.  Yummy sauce!  Will make again.  Better than anything I can buy in the store.  Thank you for sharing.

So easy to make! Tender and tasty.  Used cider vinegar because I didn't have red wine vinegar and, as suggested in other reviews, slightly increased the bake time.  Excellent! Making this again for the Memorial Day weekend.

Melt in your mouth, fall off the bone, lip smackin good!  I stuck with the original recipe except for the final cooking portion. I followed Gigi9801 directions by letting them marinate in the sauce after the initial cooking for an hour and a half.  I finished them in the oven baking them covered for 45 min then uncovered them for additional 10 min on each side.  I had lined my broiler pan bottom with foil so clean up was super easy too.  Definitely a keeper.

My adult children, who love ribs, ate them up!  Next time I will do some "tweeking" of the sauce. Add some of our own flavor to it. Like garlic.  Over all very juicy and good.

I made these for a neighborhood rib cookoff and won 2nd place out of 13 entries. I hit the slabs with some salt and pepper and put a layer of onions, garlic and a few bay leaves on the racks before pouring the vinegar over them. I also added a few drops of liquid smoke to the vinegar and water at the suggestion of another review. Very good!

Me and my husband used this recipe for ribs AND chicken and it is great. I could not find hot pepper sauce so I added some red pepper flakes instead. (I just threw in a spoonful) We did spareribs and cooked them for the additional time and they came out fine. Thank you for sharing the recipe. We are using the recipe again for the second time tonight :)

Excellent flavor. Not too difficult to make. Sauce was a little runny; double the meat and only make 1.5x the sauce; don't double it. This is the first time I tried it and everybody loved them!

These are the best ribs I have ever made. I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used balsamic vinegar. Still was great. Tender, juicy. They were better than any ribs I have had in restaurants around here and I live in Memphis. We are known for our ribs.

I was skeptical of this recipe because it didn't require much pre-marinating and the cook time was much shorter than I expected.  I made it exactly according to the directions and the meat just didn't get tender.  Ribs meat should almost fall off the bone.  The vinegar marinade wasn't enough to cover the ribs (I did baste them halfway as instructed.)  I have them back in the oven to see if I can salvage them.  The rib meat was from a farm CSA so it was really good quality meat and I was sad to have them not turn out well.

Have been looking for an amazing rib recipe - just found it with this one.  Unfortunately, my ribs caught on fire after about 15 minutes and I had to pull them off the grill and into a 425 degree oven for the last part.  Once they hit 180 degrees (internal temp), I just poured on the rest of the sauce and left them in the oven with the door open for about 1/2 hour. (I really didn't know what I was doing, but I read that somewhere).  I wasn't expecting much because the bottom was sooo burnt - however, the bones were burnt only - these were so amazing.  I want to bottle the sauce and make some money off of it - thanks for helping me find the elusive amazing rib recipe.

This was my first time making BBQ sauce and grilling ribs.  It was a big hit with the family. Meat fell right off the bones. I will definitely make this again. The only changes are: I baked it for about 1 hour, turned off heat and left it covered for another 30 min. I also added some cayenne pepper and 1/4 cup more brown sugar.

Takes a bit of time, but everyone liked them, even the grandkids.  Used spareribs, I'm going to try the baby back ribs next time.  Upped the baking time to an hour, but everything else I did exactly like recipie said.   Not spicy at all.

What a great easy & quick way to get delicious ribs.  I cooked them for 50 min in the oven and then followed the directions for the grill.  The char on the outside was great.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

tough, had to pull them off the bone with teeth and a lot of force, the sauce was runny and couldnt taste it on the meat.  followed the recipe exactly as written.  Best thing about these ribs is that I'm not out a whole lot of money as they are fairly inexpensive

Very good- needs lots of changes. BBQ sauce way to vinegar add sugar added some apple butter that was amazing. Cooking was disaster. Needs to be cooked on way lower temp for way longer ie 250 for 3 or 4 hours. Very tough.

Great cooking method! I baked in the oven a total of about 2 1/2 hours before grilling. We have a smoker, and we have made ribs by smoking for hours and hours (8-12). These ribs were far better than on the smoker.

I prefer "fall off the bone" type of ribs.  Next time I will boil them or bake at low heat until tender.  But the sauce was excellent.

I made this last night and it was a huge hit at my house. Im a college student with not a lot of cooking experience I pulled this one of perfectly! The recipe makes a lot of sauce so it could be used again on chicken or something. It wasnt spicy or anything either. Will be making this again soon! (I made it with spare ribs and it took the same amount of time)

I thought this was great.  I've never made ribs before and these were absolutely wonderful.  The sauce was just delicious.  I did not cook them on the grill as long was suggested.  I would highly recommend this to everyone!

Made this recipe today for our Memorial Day cookout and it was AWESOME!!  So many rave reviews!!!  It sounds like a lot of work, but it's not bad at all.  I used baby back ribs and followed the recipe to a "T."  This is definitely a keeper and I would highly recommend it!!  The sauce made enough that I also used it on the burgers we grilled - very yummy!!

I decided to try this rib recipe on the spare ribs i'd just bought, because i didnt want to soak overnight.  Everything was going fine . .  until it decided to rain.  I tried to light the charcoal anyways, but no luck.  So I cooked them under the broiler at 325 -- FANTASTIC!  Even my very picky 8 yo son decided it was "ok" and then asked for extra sauce!  DH, who is canadian and doesnt much like BBQ, said it was quite good.  And my daughter, who is always asking for ribs, was in 7th heaven!
