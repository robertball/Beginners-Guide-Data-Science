I'd like to clarify a couple of things about this recipe. I submitted this particular recipe, and to Beth, who made a comment, you are correct if you are going by the picture. I don't know where this picture came from, but its NOT my pudding! The picture looks like a cake. I wrote a long time ago to the webmaster to delete the photo because it is misleading. My grandmother's father, whose last name was Mitchell, was born and raised in Mitchell, Indiana. This recipe came from his family. I hope to get my own pudding photo uploaded to replace the one there now. Thanks :) -Kerry

I am from Mitchell, Indiana, home of the Persimmon Festival, Persimmon Capitol of the World and all that.  This is NOT how we make our persimmon pudding.  This recipe is more of a persimmon cake.  Not that it doesn't still taste good, its just not persimmon pudding!

I haven't tried this exact recipe but I know and eat Indiana persimmon pudding.  Have made it and purchased it pre-made.  Always DELICIOUS but it is an aquired taste.  If you like sweet potato pudding you will probably like persimmon pudding.  Serve with whipped topping!

I to am from Mitchell IN, and i agree this is not Persimmon Pudding, at least not the kind here in Indiana, If you are wanting to make true pudding dont use this, this is a persimmon cake of some sort, i tried it as i do all the other pudding recipes and it is good but not a true pudding :)

Ahhhh! I am a born and bred Hoosier, and this is amazing. I live in New England now, and have persimmon pulp shipped to me from Dillman Farms in Indy. It's worth every penny. This is delicious served with fresh whipped cream. Everyone here who has tried has loved it. It reminds me of Indian pudding. Enjoy!

this is very similar to the recipe that my great grandmother used...that all my family uses and we have been eating it all our lives. some family members like whipped cream on top, some prefer milk or cream over it, no matter how you prefer, it's still a great recipe well worth keeping around for generations to come!

I gave this 5 stars because it is almost exactly like the recipe that's been handed down in my family from the same era, and it is simply heavenly!  Living in Texas for 25 years, I still crave persimmon pudding at Thanksgiving.  I'll be contacting Dillman Farms this year!

I've never made a pudding before, so take my feedback with that in mind!  This looked to me like it would be a kind of bread pudding, but the consistency wasn't fluffy like a bread pudding.  Mine turned out not as dark as I expected and more sticky, like a paste.  I added a few seasonal spices to the recipe as well since the persimmon flavor is so light.  The taste was great and it is perfect with some vanilla ice cream.  I'm not sure I would make this again, as I followed the recipe to the letter and the presentation at my function was doubtful!

I am from Henryville, Indiana, originally from New Albany. My Nanny (grandmother) always made this for the holidays, however I was a little confused when I was checking her recipe against the recipes on here. Ours is never stirred, it is meant to have a crust and the consistency of pumpkin pie only thinner. That was always what I loved about it, that chewy outer layer and the gooey inner pudding is to die for. So I guess what I wanted to say is that, it is just as good if not better and a lot less work to just leave it cooking and not stir it. Yes it does come out more cakelike but it is delicious. I think as with all old recipes that it just depends on how our ancestors prepared it and if your all's ancestors are anything like mine were about 1/2 of any recipe was in their heads and up for revision with each preparation. I think if you put all the right ingredients in it, there isn't really any wrong way to make this stuff, it's yummy no matter what. Also, Kerry anyone is allowed to upload a picture of the recipe, there can be 10 or 20 different pictures of the same recipe, people just have to scroll through them, but I agree this picture looks nothing like the traditional Persimmon pudding we make around here, but it doesn't look that bad, I'd eat it. LOL Happy Turkey day.

I suspect the reviewers who complain that this is more like bread than pudding didn't stir the concoction every 15 minutes as per the directions.    I followed the directions, except cut it off after about an hour and a half of total cook time, (my oven might run hot, I don't know) and got a thick, brown, traditional pudding from it.

Okay, this is a relatively obscure recipe. That being said, I can't encourage you enough to try it. I used fresh persimmon and followed the recipe to the letter. The result? Well, my family RAVISHED the result. It's simply outstanding!

This is a completely different recipe than what I grew up with in Indiana, but definitely as good! I'm used to a cool, moist "pie" texture.   This comes out of the oven very thick and hot, best when poured over vanilla ice cream! I do have two suggestions to add a little more flavor, I added One Tbsp. of ground cinnamon and 1 Tbsp. of ground cloves. To quote my 7-year-old nephew: "I don't know what this stuff is, but it's DELICIOUS!"

Finally, a recipe that tastes like I remember it.  Adding a little amaretto in place of some milk is a possibility, but pleasant smell of persimmons permeates the house for two hours and one can actually taste the persimmons in this recipe.

I am born and raised in Indiana and this is EXACTLY like my grandmas! It is wonderful. The only things I did different were that I added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon (because Grandma always did) and I used baking powder instead of soda. This is gooey yummy goodness that brings me back to Grandma's farm.

Lots of work for not much persimmon flavor. Followed the recipe exactly and am an experienced baker. I was very disappointed.

Recipe seemed very easy. Followed and cooked exactly as written. Don't know what went wrong or if it was just the recipe, but the end result came out like a tasteless paste. When cold, it was too hard to eat, and when warm, it was kind of sticky and flavorless. Nothing at all like any persimmon puddings or cakes I've had growing up. Very disappointed. :(

This is the pudding I remember. Stirring it gives it the consistency of a steamed pudding. It’s definitely not a cake.

Super-easy recipe, but it makes a BIG pudding!  I usually have to cut the amounts in half.  Made it last week and Dad is still pestering me to make another.  (He noticed the persimmons in the grocery store ads!)

This is a very good recipe to try. Looks bad, but it is very good. Were from Indiana and eat this every year for the Holidays. Stay away from the ones on the tree though. Sour as hell.
