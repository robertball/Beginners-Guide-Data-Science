These were very good!  I made them for brunch.  I didn't have dry mustard, and I know it is more potent than prepared mustard, so I used a tablespoon of dijon mustard for each teaspoon of dry mustard that the recipe called for.  Also, I didn't have steak sauce, but substituted worchestersire sauce of the same amount.  I got a few more out of the recipe than it said...but I may have rolled my dough a little thinner.  By the way, we discovered that the cheese sauce for this recipe was also very good on the home fries that we made to go with the brunch.  I'll definitely make this again.
