This recipe was very good and easy to make.  I was craving key lime, so I substituted the strawberry pudding with vanilla pudding and added sweetened lime juice and almond extract. It sets up so nicely that I think the vanilla or chocolate pudding might make a good middle for an ice cream sandwich type of treat too (just place choco wafers on the outside).

I used strawberry cream cheese and cheesecake pudding. They turned out really tasty, but I wouldn't leave them out too long because they aren't very easy to handle when they start melting.

I love the idea, but I don't know where to find strawberry pudding.  i tried using strawberry jello powder, but it made the cheesecake a little grainy.  And I found it a pain to take them out of the cups bc they just didn't sit pretty out of the cups.  It did not look as cute as the picture for the recipe.  I'll try it again making a homemaid version of strawberry pudding.

I was excitted to used these as a pick-up dessert, but after being out for a very short while they got too soft to hold.  I thought they tasted more like frozen pudding than cheesecake. I made them ahead for a party so they were very frozen.  But they were either too frozen to eat or when I let them stay out for a very short time they were  too soft.   But i did try a variation.  I used chocolate pudding and added kahlua.  Then once in the cup I added a drop of dark chocolate syrup and swirled it around with a skewer.  They looked cute.  I just wish they would have held their shape.
