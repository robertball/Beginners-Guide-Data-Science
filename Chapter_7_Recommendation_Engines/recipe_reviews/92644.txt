A good beginning to a delicata squash recipe. My changes included using olive oil to saute the shallots/garlic, and a little roasted red pepper that I added.  In addition, you should definitely cook quinoa (and rice for that matter) in veggie broth... not only does it add nutritional value, but a great deal of flavor!

Terrific recipe! I altered slightly by using leeks instead of shallots and sliced almonds instead of pine nuts. I also added goat cheese on top of the finished product. Just delicious. I would make this again and would definitely serve to guests.

great recipe but no need to bake the squash - cut it, seed it  and steam it - I use a rice cooker and put the sieve/strainer in on top of the quinoa -- everything done at once -- then saute the rest of the ingredients and add to the quinoa when it is cooked --

This was absolutely delicious!  I was a little confused by the photo though because that definitely is zucchini squash, not delicata, which have completely different flavor profiles.  I made a few changes which made this awesome: I halved the delicata, seeded, and sprayed with some I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray.  I then put them into a preheated 425 degree oven with no water for 30-45 minutes until they were soft and had a dark roasted color (the cooking time will depend on the size of your squash).  In the meantime I sauteed half a red onion (I didn't have any shallots) and garlic in some canola oil which is actually healthier than olive.  Then added 1/3 cup chopped walnuts (no pine nuts on hand) and chopped leaves of one celery heart, the tender yellow ones.  When that was all soft and fragrant I added the quinoa and sauteed until it glistened, and then added 2 cups of vegetable broth and some freshly ground black pepper.  The broth, celery, and pepper took care of the bland flavor others mentioned.  When the quinoa was done I stuffed it into the squash cavities, sprinkled with grated parmesan, and returned to the oven until the cheese was golden brown.  It was truly DELISH!!

Enjoyed this dish. I used acorn squash as that's all that was available at the supermarket. I also left out the garlic as I'm not a big garlic fan and I thought the shallots would be enough. Tasty dish, and very nutritious.

I made this almost exactly as described, except I doubled the amount and cooked 2 squash...and it was great! I will definitely try it again. The quinoa is a perfect compliment to the squash and I got rave reviews from the 4 people that ate it with me.  As a side note...I think it is funny how others have rated this recipe after they changed it and then give it a poor rating...lol

like rice, quinoa has a very neutral flavor and the ingredients used in this recipe did not do it justice.  It was okay, but definately not worth all of the fat or calories you will eat from the butter and pine nuts.  I will not make this recipe again.

This is a very good way to make squash a complete dish.  I used 2 squash because there's lots of filling.  My squash took longer to bake.  I used 2 little red onions because that's what I got from my CSA farm.  I cooked the quinoa in broth and added 1/2 package of Boca breakfast links.  They were a great addition and gave the dish more flavor.  My husband and I both really enjoyed it and I'd make it again.

This recipie was very good, but even better after I tweaked it. I added zucchini in with the shallots and garlic and I stuffed red peppers instead of squash. I think they have more flavor than squash.

My rating is as such because I would probably not make this again. I don't know what I was thinking wanting to make a "stuffed squash".  I have two young kids and stuffing the squash just to turn around and unstuff it, to cut off the skin and serve to them made no sense for me. I also wasn't that thrilled with the delicata squash, perhaps I don't like it since I had never had it before.  

 I will however, make the quinoa(and with vegetable stock again)  because it was delicious.  I guess I will just try another way to liven up the squash.

Overall, the dish was delicious and light.  Substituted couscous for quinoa, pecans for pine nuts, minced red onions for shallots, and added chopped bell pepper, kale and oregano/thyme/basil seasoning - all sauteed in olive oil.  Topped filled squash halves with shredded truffle cheese (Trader Joe) and broiled for 2 minutes. Yum!!!

I've made this dish several times and it always turns out delicious. My husband asks for it. That's always the sign of a good recipe, especially a vegetarian recipe like this. I've also made it with walnuts when I didn't have pine nuts on hand -- also very delicious.

I cooked my quinoa in 2 cups vegetable broth and a tsp. of salt. It was good, but definitely needed a little acid -- like a squeeze of lemon in the quinoa broth, maybe.

I loved this so much!!  I had a bunch of delicata squash to use from a local farm, and this recipe did not disappoint.  The only substitutions I made were to use Earth Balance instead of butter; I sprinkled Italian seasoning on the squash before roasting; I subbed raw sunflower seeds for pine nuts as I didn't have any; and I added a generous handful of sun-dried tomatoes to the mix.  It was to die for-- thanks a milllion!

I used veggie broth instead of water, and added sauteed zucchini to the shallots and garlic.  I also used peanut pieces instead of pine nuts on a second try because I ran out of pine nuts.  It was great!  I also added goat cheese to the quinoa mixture.  Great flavor enhancer!  Overall, a wonderful recipe.

Excellent, excellent, excellent recipe. My whole family loved it.  I did alter it to our tastes a bit. I used one of the previous reviewers rice cooker method. I didn't peel the squash, just seeded & diced.  I also added a tube of Jimmy Dean sage sausage and snow peas. Didn't have plain nuts of any kind in the house, so just left those out. Best quinoa dish to date & the first time I've ever had delicata squash. Thanks for the great recipe.

I had to substitute butternut squash, zucchini  would have been better choice b/c I couldn't really stuff the butternut. Quinoa was delicious. An EZ tasty dish.

We had a bumper crop of delicata this year so this recipe was a wonderful change from our usual roasted squash. Fixed this recipe tonight and we'll be adding it to our regular repertoire. Thank you for the great recipe.

The recipe came out great but I made a few modifications.  Instead of delicata squash, I used zucchini because it was on sale at the store.  Olive oil was substituted for butter.  I also added some finely chopped mushrooms to the Quinoa mixture. 
The recipe was truly delicious and easy to follow.  I will definitely make it again.

I can't give this five stars because it was the most bland recipe I've ever used. I agree it is a different taste but it isn't enough taste. I shall have to try it with some of the other suggestions. My grown daughters tried it and thought it bland.

Very good!  This is the first time I've made squash into something other than soup and it was really yummy.  I modified it some as others suggestedand used veggie broth for the quinoa.  I also used leeks instead of shallots and added diced zucchini and a couple slices of chopped bacon!  Basically added everything I hadn't used up yet in my CSA box!  A few dashes of red peppers later and I had a fairly quick and delicous meal!  Will definitely make again!

First recipe I've used Delicata squash! The quinoa in the squash "bowl" part was perfect, but a tad dry as part of the bed of the dish. But overall, I've made it 3 times in 2 weeks on request, so everyone clearly loved it!

As usual I didn't have the right ingredients so I improvised.  I cooked barley! in chicken broth, added left over spicy black beans, scooped the mixture into the roasted squash (olive oil, salt, and pepper), covered with Parmesan, and baked until the cheese melted, about five minutes.  Yum!

This was so good!
We had a smallish delicata, which I just halved for 2 of us. Added about a 1 tsp of finely chopped fresh marjoram atop each of the quinoa-filled squash halves.  I added that as a standard to my copy of the recipe, as I think it really added a nice flavor texture.
I will use olive oil next time, too.

An easy, pretty quick recipe that we will make again!

Excellent!!  My husband raved about it; even his co-workers commented on it the next day!  He said it was equally as good leftover warmed in the microwave.  Will keep this as a staple in my recipe box.

Hubby especially loved this. I thought the quinoa was bland as is, so after following the recipe I added about 2t sage and another clove of garlic, along with some Spike herb seasoning. It still tasted a bit bland, but once it was combined with the squash, it was much better. I also roasted my squash (450, no water), because I prefer the flavor it adds. A definite keeper, and super easy!

I used butternut squash because I couldn't find delicata - that seemed to be a fine substitution but I had to bake it longer. A great side dish for tofu parm!

I thought this was a tasty way to make the delicata squash I received from my CSA.  I did use vegetable broth instead of water to cook the quinoa as well as used leeks instead of shallots.  It was delish!  Thanks for the idea
