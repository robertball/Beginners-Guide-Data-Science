Superb... but best with an ale preferably a cream ale... no generic beer will do the job as well...

I followed this recipe to the letter with the exception of wasabi powder(couldn't find it)which we replaced with wasabi horseradish (1 tbsp).We used it with ribs and it was superb.Can't wait to try it with chicken!!!!

Really GOOD. Left out the cilantro due to allergy. Wonderful flavor.
