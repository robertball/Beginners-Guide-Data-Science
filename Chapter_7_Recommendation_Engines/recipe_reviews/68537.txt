I needed to use up carrots and celery so I doubled the broth and wine, and also added chopped garlic.  I also added lemon zest, a bit of lemon juice, and turmeric.  The turmeric makes the soup a bright color and adds a bit of flavour.  This takes longer than the 35 minutes listed to cook.  I let mine simmer for an hour and the veggies still weren't soft.  I pureed a bit of it and ate it because I was starving, but I let it cook for another hour.  It tasted much better.  I will make this again, but I will give myself a lot longer to make it.  I'm thinking that this would make a good slow-cooker soup.

Great tasting!  I pureed the carrots and celery to give it a creamier texture.

This is a tasty soup that I have been making for years.  It is delicious as a light first course for lunch or dinner with a hearty sandwich.  I also add several garlic cloves that have been minced.

This was very good! I used 4 carrots and celery ribs and 1/2 a minced red pepper to the onion.  I used chicken broth and a can of italian diced tomatoes and garlic cloves. I  pureed about a 1/4 of the soup before serving.  This is awesome if you add a dash of hot sauce and some lemon zest.

Fairly good. I added a bit of black pepper. I didn't have any white wine, so I used 1/8 cup white wine vinegar and added some sugar to balance it. I put some crushed crackers in the soup, and it makes for a decent lunch. It might have been better if I'd actually had wine to put in it, but as I did it, it was ok.

The wine is a necessary addition. 
I had to go without the tarragon and I compensated with garlic and some half and half. It was deeeelish.

It's great !! every now and then to have a recipe that doesn't serve 16 people.  This is a nice recipe for two people with a left-over.  The feedback from the supporters of allrecipes is also very valuable and appreciated.

This was a pretty good soup, considering how simple it was. I made it exactly as written and the wine definitely makes this soup! After 15 mins of simmering, the carrots and celery were still crunchy. I ended up simmering the soup for about 30 mins, covered. By that time, a lot of the liquid had reduced down, so I added about 1/2 cup more broth and just under 1/4 cup of wine and simmered an additional 5 minutes. I have to admit, when I tasted it the first time, before it was fully cooked, I didn't care for it much. Once it simmered for 30 mins, the flavors really developed and concentrated and turned into a simple soup that's packed wth flavor. The tarragon is a nice touch, so don't leave it out!

Great recipe. I'm a big fan of soups and the white wine gives this one a very special flavour.

Very tasty!  I didn't have the veggie soup, so I used chicken bouillon.  I'll definitely make it again.  A great solution for extra celery and carrots.

This review is for my own use really.
Tried to make this for the Daniel fast, so no wine. I added a bit of grape juice as a substitute. Neither my husband nor I particularly cared for this. He added hot sauce and I added soy sauce to our respective bowls and to no avail.

Vegetables need to cook much longer than just 15 minutes. They were crunchy and barely cooked. The recipe takes longer than the stated time.

Loved it! I did male a few changes. I used a vidalia  onion and vegan "no chicken" broth which is similar to vegetable broth but does not have any tomato paste in it. This was the broth I had on hand, so I used it. I used an unoaked pinot grigio wine. It was fantastic! I will definitely make it again.

This is a great and simple soup all by itself and can be used as the foundation for adding any carbs, veggies and protein which may be on-hand.  So make plenty!  
One day, I added 1/2 c bagged chopped Asian salad to a bowl of the soup.  Another day, I added leftover orzo and tofu.  Still, on another day, I added rice and veggie "meat' crumble.  I think I'll try some type of bean next...
So. all-in-all, a quick and easy lunch on a busy day.

It tasted like a soup half finished.  I added some beef gravy,  more carrots, pepper, 1 lb browned ground beef and several potatoes.  Then it was good.

I added 1lb cubed chicken thigh for protein after the onion and thin vermicelli noodle toward the end, make it a 1 pot meal - great comforting soup for cold night for the whole family, even for our picky little one. I also added 3 cloves of garlic, pinch of salad and 1tsp of ground pepper.

This is such great soup! I made it today, following the recipe exactly, and scarfed it down with a pretzel roll. This is a new favorite I'll be making for years to come.

Love this soup very much! Easy and quick, but taste too good! I did not have tarragon, so I used  marojam instead and cooked longer than 15 minutes (about 30 minutes) It was really good. I have made this soup twice already in the past week! Thank you.

Made it based on the recipe once and then started adding veggies. I always have a ton of vegetables to use from my farm box so I frequently max out the veggie. 5 stars as a base.

I adjusted recipe to 6 servings to fill my 2.5 qt. slow cooker and used defatted homemade beef vegetable broth, adding beef bouillon cubes to taste. I substituted freeze dried red onions for fresh, added 1/2 t. of Mrs. Dash Lemon Pepper Seasoning Blend, 1/2 t. of ground Tumeric, and 1 t. of ReaLemon juice. I did not saut√© the vegetables but instead put them in the slow cooker raw. This eliminates a good amount of fat. We live near Hatch, NM, "The Chile Capital of The World," so I used Green Chile wine
