While I couldn't detect the mellow coffee flavor the submitter describes, the coffee (and a good pinch of salt) no doubt did heighten the chocolate flavor because for some reason it just does.  I was not entirely happy with the recipe as is, preferring to nearly double the butter, which I didn't melt. By doing so I got the fluffy "chocolate ice cream" look and mouth feel I was after, and a frosting that wasn't overly sweet.  I used this to frost "Chocolate-Zucchini Cupcakes," also from this site.

I used a little more butter and milk just to get to the consistency I was after, but the basics were still there. Good flavor and seemed easy to tweak for what I wanted, which is much appreciated.

Delicious! Need to stay out of it so there is enough left to frost the cupcakes. It reminds of a frosting my grandmother used to make- none of that artificial flavor of canned frosting. I made it with margarine because that was all I had and it was fine. I also used coffee that had been brewed and that was fine too. I used only one tablespoon of milk.

This frosting had a good flavor. I made it for a faceless recipes (recipes without photos) for the website. I am just still trying to think, what to use it with. It's 10x better than using canned frosting. Although, I couldn't really taste the coffee. It tasted like a good rich chocolate frosting. The color was like a milk chocolate. I thought it tasted a lot like a frosting version of fudge. It is really sweet, but that is to be expected. Maybe, a lightly sweet shortbread type cookie would work. I will update with a picture, when I figure it out.

I LOVE this frosting! I love chocolate, I love coffee, so I definitely love this mocha frosting! I just have one major problem : don't use melted butter!!! Use softened! When the butter's melted, this comes out more like a glaze than anything else. When it's softened, it has the texture of a real frosting. As long as the butter isn't melted, this recipe is great.

I made this using a little more milk and powered sugar. Plus I used 1 1/2 tbsp of coffee (I wanted a stronger coffee flavor). Love coffee!!! I got it to the consistency that I wanted and put it on my one bowl chocolate cake 3 (from this site). Just wonderful together. Thanks future _chef for this easy and great recipe.

This is delicious ! I added about 4 more tablespoons of milk; I honestly didn't measure; just added a bit at a time until it was the consistency I wanted. I also used 1tblsp of instant espresso powder. Scrumptious!

This made the perfect amount for a two layer cake.  It spread beautifully and had wonderful flavor.

I used this recipe for my Buche de Noel this past Christmas.  I figured since it was my first 'Yule Log' i'd take a chance with it.  Instead of the traditional white filling I used chocolate mousse (my son's favorite dessert) and this was perfect.  It complimented the richness of the chocolate cake & creamy rich mousse perfectly.  I did however use brewed (strong almost like an espresso) coffee  for half the milk.  It was a huge success...requested for next years dinner if not sooner

I wanted more mocha flavor, a little less sweet and a more creamy texture.  So easy to manipulate.  
I had doubled the recipe for a layer cake, which gave me enough leftover for everyone to have a spoonful.  I used 3/4 of the sugar called for, almost tripled the coffee, and added a bit more milk. So good!

This was pretty good, although I did have to add a bit more milk to get it to a spreading consistency, and I also resorted to using a hand mixer rather than a whisk.  I do think the instructions could use a little finesse - perhaps whisk the dry ingredients together, then add the wet ingredients.

Used a heaping tablespoon of instant coffee and had to eyeball the powdered sugar, since I buy in 10 lb bags.  Super easy and ingredients I was able to pull from my nearly empty pantry.  Used it to frost a red velvet cake.  Yum!

Great taste, but had to add a lot more milk than it says, luckily its easy to keep adding milk until its the right consistency. I just added milk from the fridge, I didn't bother warming it up after the 2 tablespoons.

I loved the results I had with this chocolate mocha icing.  I didn't make any changes except to double the recipie.  It was gooey ooey!  Just perfect!  The texture was ideal in that it was very easy to spread on my cooled cake. I waited an hour for the icing to set on the cake so I could take a spoon and make fancy swirls.  I will definitely make this icing again.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with the measurements of the ingredients as some have said.  See for yourself like I did.

Can I give this more than 5 stars? I followed the recipe exactly and this is the best frosting I've ever had. The BEST frosting I've ever had! I actually don't even like frosting, but this, oh THIS! So so so good!!! Obviously, everyone else liked it too. On top of it tasting so good, it took about 3 minutes to make from start to finish. Thanks so much for sharing!

I had to modify this recipe for a dairy free person and I couldn't get any instant coffee last minute so I used 2 espresso shots in place of the milk and instant coffee.  I think it gave it a little more coffee flavor.  Turned out pretty good!

Thank you! I've never made frosting (I don't do a lot of baking) and I hate all the trans fats in canned frosting. On a jones, looked up a recipe and found this one. I didn't have instant coffee, but after reading the reviews I see how malleable your recipe is, so I brewed some espresso and added that. I actually added about 3 TBLSP and it has a nice bit of coffee flavor. YUM!

It was ok. Not a big fan though.
