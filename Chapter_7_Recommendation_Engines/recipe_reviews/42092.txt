I found the Lemon Snow Filling to possess a very light and delicious flavor.  It was easy, quick to make, and very cheap.  Instead of using rasberries and rasberry sauce for garnish however, I used strawberries and strawberry sauce.  I also thinly sliced lemons and used them to line the edges of the crepe for decoration. It complimented the lemon filling better than I expected.  Just remember that only a little sauce is needed to flavor your crepes. I recommend this recipe to anyone.

This is a great recipe. I tuned down the cream a little to about 2/3, with a little less sugar to about 1 1/4 cups. This was to make the filling a little less fattening (even though I left the whole cream cheese in :) ).  It also made it have a more cheesy taste, which I personally love.   This goes GREAT if added into strawberries! Cut the leaves off the strawberries to make a flat base. Cut the other end about half way to expose the inner hole of the strawberries, and pipe in the filling. Garnish with icing sugar to make it look nice. Serve cold as the filling tends to run if it warms up. Absolutely fantastic.  I'm going to be experimenting with adding other flavors to the mix instead of just lemon, maybe some strawberries themselves, or even chocolate.  Good recipe though, served me well :)

This sounded good and light in theory, however, upon execution, I found it cloyingly sweet.  If I make it again, I will definitely reduce the amount of sugar.

I enjoyed this filling very much with crepes!  The only change I made was reduce the confectioners sugar to 3/4 cup instead of 2 cups.  If you top the crepes with fresh fruit and a fruit sauce, there is plenty of sweetness from that.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this recipe! I hosted a brunch get together and made these along with a few other types of crepes....my goodness. These were the best. I added a bit more lemon zest and they were wonderful. Already gave the recipe out to a few friends. A few dozen friends, I mean :)

thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!Will make again very soon.

This was sooo yummy! I love the lemon! Everyone at my house loved this,even my picky one who hates any type of cheese anything. I only used about 1 1/2 cups of sugar and I think the sweetness was just right. Thanks so much for sharing. Will definitely use this over and over again!

Really is very sweet. Next time I'll reduce the sugar. Also, it makes about 4 cups of filling - way more than we need for crepes. We think it'll be excellent for frosting cakes or as the filling for cookie sandwiches.

A little too sweet for breakfast, but these would make an amazing dessert. Try it with raspberry jam heated up in the microwave.

You know how sometimes you can look at a recipe and tell it will be amazing?  This recipe was like that.  And I was right, the Lemon Snow IS incredible!  I followed the recipe exactly after halving it and we don't think it's too sweet.  This was so good in crepes with freezer strawberry jam.  It would be great spread on top of a sheet cake or piped into tiny cupcakes with a lemon glaze on top.  Lots of possibilities!

Delicious. Light and subtle. Loved the lemon peel, really gave it flavor. Made this for a filling for crepes with strawberry sauce on top. Big hit!

Lemon is for some reason a wonderful accent to the crepe flavor so I tried this recipe and wasn't disappointed.  I think it would also be good as a type of topping for a fresh berry pie or perhaps a frosting layer between a lemon cake.  As other reviewers said, it is deceptively light tasting.  Perfect with fruit.

Wow, this was absolutely DELICIOUS! Very fluffy and airy and just Y-U-M! 
I added 2 teaspoons of sugar to the whipped cream, but I'm not sure if that affected the taste at all- whatever, it's delicious; enjoying it right now with some vanilla crepes.

Light yummy taste.  I was a little shocked at the amount of icing sugar it asked for, and immediately reduced it to just under 1.5 cups.  I added diced ripe pear once as well but this recipe lends itself well to working with all sorts of fruit.

Amazing!!  Made this recipe several times and the whole family loves it!   This last time I forgot to buy the lemon, so I threw in a banana instead - WOW!!  It was almost better, but I'm partial to the lemon.

Thanks for the great filling!!

This is a great recipe makes every one in the house want to lick the spoon and paddle when I'm done.  you can add a deeper flavor note by adding 1 teaspoon of vanilla to take it up one more layer.

This filling was really good, and it really deserves 5 stars, save for the fact I had to decrease the sugar by 1/2 a cup. Other than that it was awesome and creamy. Everyone loved it!

Lemon is my favorite flavor next to vanilla.  I've made this twice now, always hoping that maybe the next time will be even better.  I really like it when it's first made, but something happens to it later.  I can't quite put a finger on what it is.  I have used it on my Swedish pancakes (think crepes), and it is tasty.  I love the name of it, too!
