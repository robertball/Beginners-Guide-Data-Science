This recipe is BEST! when you use fresh whipped cream instead of Cool Whip. Basic yellow cake, baked , cooled and cubed. Instead of Angel Food which is very sweet and has no texture. And topped with a few toasted sliced almonds.

FANTASTIC!!! I was craving a light dessert that screamed summer and this was it! This was just sweet enough and didn't leave me or my dinner guests feeling heavy afterwards (as most desserts do). While I enjoyed this, I do prefer TABKAT's strawberry angel food dessert a *tad* better - but only because I like that the strawberries in hers are coated with yummy glaze. :) NOTE: To help control portion sizes and for a fancier presentation, I made individual trifles. I layered all ingredients in stemless wine glasses and garnished with a sprig of fresh basil (too cute!). I also used all fat-free ingredients and no one could tell the difference. I will DEFINITELY be adding this to my "keeper" file for sure. Thanks for sharing your yummy recipe, Michellelauren! :-)

I made this exactly as the recipe stated.  I took it to an Easter potluck and everyone loved it. More than one person had seconds. It's easy and looks great too! I will definitely make it again.

I took it to a square dance party and it was a hit.  There was none left to take home.  I made it just the way the recipe was listed.  I am making it again for Mothers Day dinner.

Easy to make.  I made it exactly as specified in the recipe.  I personally think it is a little too sweet, but my family enjoyed it for a light summer desert!

My husband said this was one of my all-time best desserts. I layered it into individual sherbet dishes for a beautiful presentation.

Added amaretto drizzle over angel food cake layers and toasted almond slivers to berry garnish on top. Used both strawberries and blueberries . Everyone raved.

I didn't make any changes but may try making it with low fat/no fat next time to compare.  It was a hit at the dinner party where I brought it.

This was yummy. I could only have a little though because it tasted overly sweet to me.
