I had some pears I needed to use, so I decided to try this recipe. It was good, but did need more flavor. I used less milk, as the full amount would have made the final result runny. I think a little more butter, some salt, and extra spices would help this. The directions don't state what size sweet potatoes or pears to use, and different pears have different flavors and textures. I imagine this could affect the outcome as well.

Very, very tasty and I didn't even have white wine...just used water.  It almost had a caramel type taste from the pears.  I only used 1/8 c. sugar and 1 tbsp. butter in an attempt to keep the calories down.  It really didn't need any more. My only complaint is that it was too watery despite the fact that I drained the pears and let the sweet potato dry out a little in the pot.  I only added about 1/3 c. of the evaporated milk.  My pears were quite ripe...maybe that's why?  Ended up putting it in the oven for a while to try to dry it out a bit.

AMAZING!  I was very skeptical of this recipe, but had both sweet potatoes and pears that I needed to use and wanted a relatively healthy recipe....WOW!  I will add this to my regular routine!  I have to admit that I do not measure out ingredients when cooking, so I cannot guarantee exact results every time.  I also omitted nutmeg because I do not like it, but trust me, this was delicious! (My husband who does not like my adventurous recipes was even surprised at how well it tasted.)

I have not tried this yet, but it sounds very interesting. Been cooking long enough to know what goes well together, and always looking for something new. I will try this soon and get back to you.

I hate the taste of wine in anything.  I substituted apple juice for the wine and it was beyond wonderful.  A wonderful Thanksgiving addition.  It was gone in seconds.

Flavor wise, it needed salt desperately, but with some salt, it was delicious. Texture wise, mine came out soupy. I have never cooked with sweet potatoes before and am wondering if maybe the potatoes I used were smaller than normal, casuing the soupiness?

I had pears that needed to be used and found this recipe. The pears and sweet potatoes are a great combination and for that I'm giving 4 stars. My objection is there is no need for any sugar and certainly not 1/4 cup. I used none and would have preferred a little less sweetness even then. Perhaps I was looking for a vegetable side dish and this is more of a dessert. I didn't think vanilla sounded good either - so left that out and substituted a bit of cardamon for the cinnamon and nutmeg. Also like other reviewers I recognized a whole cup of evaporated milk would make this very runny, so just poured in a little, perhaps 1/4 cup.

I hate reviewing recipes I've altered, but I only altered because of a lack of ingredients. I couldn't find pears at the store (I guess they're out of season?), so I used gala apples I had at home. I also added salt to the pot of boiling water. I have no idea how much, but I was pretty liberal with it. Also, I measured a cup of milk (not evaporated) and added slowly until I got the consistency I wanted (it turned out to be about a half a cup). I didn't realize I was out of nutmeg, so I just doubled the cinnamon. My 4-year old is a cinnamon lover, so she loved the flavor! The result was absolutely scrumptious!

Based on other reviews,  I used half the sugar, and I baked the potatoes instead of boiling them which solved the problem of this being runny.  I made them vegan by using the poaching liquid instead of milk.  I liked the suggestion to use cardamom.  I would definitely make again!

Came out very tasty! I used all the ingredients but omitted the brown sugar. All the other ingredients I put a little in and tasted as I went and it came out great. I used 1 TBSP of butter instead of 2 TBSP, used a pinch of salt, &  1/4 C of milk and it was perfect!

Superb w/ minor tweaks.  As others mentioned:
1.  used 1/4 cup milk at the most (cow's milk works just fine if you don't have evaporated milk on hand).
2.  add at least 1/2 tsp salt
3.  used slightly less nutmeg, unless you're a big fan.  with 1/2 tsp the nutmeg comes through with a strong flavor.
4.  For the pears, just used water.  

Thanks for a great recipe!

As saltless recipes go, this was surprisingly good without salt, though we added a small touch of salt after tasting it as is.  CHANGES FOR NEXT TIME:  use only 1/2 C milk at first (whatever kind is on the rotation for the day: cow's, soy, milk or etc), & optionally use vegan butter if butter is needed at all.  Cook pears down to a caramelized mixture next time like another reviewer did - just to see if that adds much oomph.  If that doesn't impact the flavor much, them just add the pears to the same pan as the sweet T's after a few minutes of cooking.  Hmmm, thinking of caramlized pears makes me think of caramlized onions.  That might go well mixed in here too.  Either that, or serve with onions sauteed with oil, honey, cinnamon and topped with a touch of walnuts. /// OH, I DID SOMETHING I WOULDN'T DO AGAIN..., I used a hand blender to smooth out the texture in part because I figured that if I whipped all of the sweet potato bits into smaller bits, it would interact with the moisture and be a bit less soupy.  That worked well both at smoothing out the texture and thickening the mixture.  Everyone liked this anyway, but I'll skip the blender wand next time because it was a touch too smooth.  OR if I decide to use the blender wand, will only apply it to a small portion of the pan's contents.

Have not tried this recipe yet.
Sounds like a terrific combination ... off to Publix for pears.
