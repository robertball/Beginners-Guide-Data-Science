This is so easy!  I would have liked a bit more flavor so next time I will probably add lime juice when I purée the mango.

Fresh and light. I layered it in a tall 5 oz. cup by putting about 1/4 cup of the mango & whip cream on the bottom, a couple tablespoons of mango purée on top of that and finish with another 1/4 cup of mango whip cream. Garnished with a fresh slice of mango and a sprig of mint. Yummy!!
