This was fantastic! The only changes I made were to use 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white (instead of all white), added a pinch of red pepper flakes to the blender mixture, and sprayed an 8x8 baking dish w/garlic olive oil (I don't have a cast iron skillet). This was certainly full of flavor and I will be making it many times over!   The only bummer is that it only uses 1 cup of zucchini and I needed to get rid of a lot more than that.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Baked in four mini loaf pans.  Served with chili.  Delicious and will definitely make again.

This would probably be 5 stars without my tweaking, if just a bit less favorful. I used yellow summer squash (but don't think that mattered), adding approximately 1/8 c. more squash. I used half the salt & added a little Cajun seasoning. For half the onion I substituted crushed French onions from a can. Very tasty & moist!

Great unusual use for zucchini. It went well with the turkey chili from this website. My husband loved it and couldn't tell that I had hidden vitamins in it!

This was wonderful. I made it once according to the recipe, and once with some slight tweaking with whole wheat flour, brown sugar and 2 cups of zucchini. Both turned out awesome. Even Hubby who doesn't particularly eat either zucchini or cornbread really enjoyed them. Thank you!

I found this a little bland also, but then I left out the cheese as another reviewer had done the same with no complaints.  I think however it would have been better with cheese.  Texture very moist and pleasing, though!

A deliciously moist and savory cornbread!  I made it to go with chicken and dumplings, and it was a big hit!  The blender really smooths out the zucchini and onion.  I used sharp cheddar, it was a nice complement to the zucchini.  I will definitely make this one again!  Two thumbs up!

We were apprehensive to try this based solely on the fact that it had so few reviews. This was EXCELLENT. Probably some of the moistest cornbread we've ever eaten. We left out the cheese, as it didn't seem necessary and scaled back just slightly on the onion and it was still fantastic and flavorful. Perfect companion for hot chili!

definitely use yellow summer squash if the eaters are picky about green flecks in their cornbread.  I freeze shredded yellow squash just for baking.

This was pretty good. Followed recipe exactly, except I didn't have a cast iron skillet- so I just used a glass (pyrex?) baking dish. It came out perfect and golden brown and just a little sweet. We ate it with the turkey chili- also with zuccinni.

Really delicious and savory,  I served this with bacon and egg breakfast.  Would be delicious drizzled with honey when served, or add more sugar if you like it sweet.  This versatile recipe is a keeper in my book!

I just made it tonight and the zucchini and onion that I grated made a very nice favor.  With butter spread on a piece it made a wonderful midnight snack.

Very good recipe.  I made mine into mini muffins so only took about 15 min. to bake.  I may add a spoonful of honey next time for a discreet bit of extra sweetness, but good as is and very nice texture.  Perfect to go with our chili.

Cast iron preheated is the best way to make cornbread.  I put a tablespoon of butter in the skillet before preheating, and this creates a nice golden brown crust.  I have made this with other veggies - red bell pepper and scallions - instead of zukes and onions.  Both are good.

I LOVED this, nicest cornbread Ive ever had. My zucchini had gone off, so I used broccoli and fresh corn, otherwise all the same. It was amazing. Thank you so much. I will definitely make this again

I made a few changes (more onion and roasted green Hatch chiles plus 2 ears of fresh corn kernels instead of zucchini) and it came out delicious. The texture was moist on the inside and crisp on the bottom which is exactly how I like my cornbread.  Thank you.

Easily adapts to DIABETIC and GLUTEN FREE.
Use fat free milk, artificial sweetener instead of sugar, all-purpose gluten free flour mix, and soy/rice/almond cheddar cheese.  
No other changes required and recipe cooks up very well.
If you use a lined muffin tin - cook the cornbread 25 min or so.

This cornbread is so so good.  I'm always trying to find ways to use my zucchini from my garden.  Made it for my family this week and going to a cookout this weekend....this is what I'm taking.

Moist and tasty!  I didn't use a full cup of cheese as we try to go light on cheese, though we love it!  I just threw in a good handful of sharp cheddar and it was fine.  My husband also commented how good it was.  We didn't even need butter or hummus on it.   Yes, I know.  Who uses hummus on cornbread?  He uses it on lots of things!

I left out the sugar and used vidalia onion relish instead of chopped onions. I shredded the zucchini and used less salt, because the cheese is salty. I used coconut milk and Dayia dairy free cheese and avocado oil. Everyone at our gathering loved it.

This is an EXCELLENT cornbread recipe!  I left out the cheese but otherwise followed the instructions.  I put half of it into a 6" cast iron pan to go with my burritos and made the other half into waffles to go under some bbq beans tomorrow.  The pan and the waffles each turned out beautifully.  The one in the pan is moist and delicious.  The waffles are crispy and delicious.  This one is a keeper.

I made this last night. It's very dense & moist. The flavor of the onion was more strong than I personally cared for. I also didn't think it tasted much like CORNbread, although it was actually quite good & my bf nearly ate half of it in one sitting, so it was definitely a big hit! I will make this again, for sure, but probably reduce the onion by half (out of personal preference). Oh! Almost forgot, I didn't have any milk, so substituted buttermilk & reduced baking powder by 1 tbs. Blending the "wet" ingredients was an interesting concept for me.. It worked fabulously!! Thanks so much for this new-to-me take on a classic cornbread recipe.

My husband loved this recipe. I thought maybe some diced Chiles or jalapeños might kick it up a notch.

Very pretty with the little green flecks in the yellow, and it was moist. But it was not sweet enough and it had a weird crumb. I'm eating it but if I ever make it again, I'm increasing the sugar.

I make this recipe so often!  I make them in muffin size and freeze them.

Because I wanted a little bit of spice, I used fresh jalapenos (seeded) instead of zucchini and this recipe worked well for that. It turned out wonderful!

since there were only 2 reviews, i was cautious to test this out.  TURNED OUT PERFECT.  instructions were accurate.  the cornbread was easy to make and tasty, more moist than most cornbread (must have been from the zuke).  amazingly, it did not stick and looked perfect in the skillet.  everyone thought it tasted great.  for anyone who thinks it is a little bland, add extra onion and shake in some pepper flakes.

We did not care for this recipe at all.  Not a lot of flavor.
