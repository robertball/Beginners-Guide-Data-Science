Made this for the first time today.  Very easy, and very tasty!! Used black pepper instead of white, and added more blue cheese than called for.

You gotta like bleu cheese to like these cucumbers.  I made a half a recipe because I'm the only one in this house who likes it!  These cucumbers and onions are very good, but, boy do they have a bite to them.  Next time I'm going to cut back on the bleu cheese just a little.  Thanks for sharing a different type of creamed cucumbers.

I made this for a family dinner because it looked good and was something out of the norm. I added a little bit more blue cheese then the recipe called for I think it's a taste preference  (my family loves blue cheese). It was the first dish gone everybody loved it and wanted the recipe...Definitely a keeper :)

I made this to go with some buffalo hot wings... it was perfect!  The sour cream and blue cheese with the crisp coolness of cucumbers went perfectly.  We thought this was much better than simply using a blue cheese dipping sauce.  I didn't change anything from the recipe, but I have to admit I don't usually measure these types of recipes.  Thanks for a great new way to accompany wings!

I love cukes and blue cheese, but had never had this type of salad before. That has changed forever. It was a crowd pleaser at our Thanksgiving table and is going to be a recipe I make frequently throughout the year as well. I used English cukes which have no seeds. I did peel them, but I am sure that is not needed. I replaced the onion with shallots and having no white pepper, just used black. Only a purist would tell and then it would be difficult due to the dill. I made it the day before so it had ample time for the flavors to marry. Excellent salad and one you should try soon. This was just one of four, five star dishes on our Thanksgiving table this year. Thank you Allrecipes.com and all those who contribute. I am a devoted fan.

Very good! Nice combo of flavors and we really enjoyed the slight sweetness from the sugar w/ the salty blue cheese...VERY refreshing and a great side to dinner tonight! I kinda decided on this last minute, so I didn't get to allow my cukes to drain much, b/c I wanted to get this in the fridge to blend the flavors, so mine was a little runnier, but that was my fault and I will plan ahead for it next time~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Great cool creamy summer salad. I make a salad very similar to this, just no blue cheese. We all love a good blue cheese and it was a terrific addition. I added the exact amount called for and thought it was perfect. Of course my cukes were pretty large. Some caterpillars ate my whole dill bush so I had to use dry dill, worked fine, but I know fresh would be much better. We served this along side Chipotle burgers on this site.

This was so delish!!! Was a splendid addition to dinner this evening! I used dried dill instead of fresh & I didn’t deseed & cut cucumber rounds into halves. I also cut my onions slightly differently too; I didn’t dice them into small pieces. I also added extra bleu cheese & added tomatoes. The dressing is so delicious, I absolutely love this dish & will be making again very soon!!

I just didn't care for the flavor combination. I will save the blue cheese for other salads and leave it out of the cucumber salad.

Had to add a lot of extra vinegar, salt, and sour cream to make it taste right but it turned out very good.

This was delicious! I love blue cheese, and just the addition of it takes the standard cucumber salad to a whole new level. I would never have thought to add it to a salad like this, but it really works here. The onions also add a nice sweetness. Thanks madermouse for the great recipe and for the info on the sour cream as well!

If you love blue cheese, you'll love this dish.  Lindsay recommended this recipe on the Buzz, so I knew it had to be good.

I had a huge almost two foot cucumber that was a gift and I was unsure what to do with it.  This recipe was perfect.  My only issue was that the salad still got watery and I don't think the cucumbers sat long enough.  When I make this again, I will let them sit longer.  Very nice and delicious salad!  Thanks!

We're really not big cucumber fans, but we do love blue cheese. This is a fantastic recipe for anyone who likes blue cheese.  The dill is a nice touch as well. We didn't use sugar and it was not missed. I have never salted cucumber to draw out moisture before and I think it was absolutely necessary to help the sour cream to not go watery. I'm glad this was included in the directions. Thanks for a keeper madermouse.
