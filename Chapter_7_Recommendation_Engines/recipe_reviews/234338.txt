Made as written except that I sliced the jalapeno instead of dicing it so that I could broil them along with the shrimp. The only negative thing I have to say about this recipe is that the coarse salt made these entirely too salty. I suggest leaving it out altogether. The shrimp really soak up the marinade and there is plenty of salt in it. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!

The result was dried out salty shrimp. Not a good recipe.
