This came out really good! I didn't have the peppercorns, unfortunately, so I probably was missing something crucial, but I still really liked it. The sauce was tasty, but simple enough to let the taste of the salmon come through. Will definitely make salmon this way again!

Excellent way to cook salmon! I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder, skipped the whole black peppercorns (hubby doesn't like too much heat) as well as the oven step, and just pan seared the fish. Flavorful and yet not over-powering. Used the same sauce for shrimps too for a great side.

I have had two wild salmon filets in my freezer for a couple of months that were given to my husband by a salmon distributor.  We are not big fish eaters-ok, I am not a big fish eater but I decided I was tired of looking at them in my freezer and chose the recipe to give it a try.  I made this exactly as stated in the recipe and it was actually pretty good - for fish!  My seven year old son even kept commenting on how good it was - once he got over the shock that I actually cooked fish.  I would highly recommend it to any fish lovers out there.

I hate salmon, as does my husband, but the doctor recommended he start eating it weekly. This recipe was AWESOME! I almost didn't wake my toddler up from his nap just so I could eat his. In the end, motherly instinct won out and guess what? Even a three year old loves this recipe.

This was really good. I used a lot more lemon then usually because I love lemon but overall it was really good. I did skip the oven part to make it quicker and just cooked it over the skillet.

Absolutely Awesome!!! I didn't have the peppercorn or parsley the recipe called for so it may have been better if I had all the ingredients :-) I put the salmon over angel hair pasta w/ roasted garlic alfredo sauce... Delicious!

This was a wonderful recipe. Didn't change anything. I like fish, but am afraid to make it because it never turned out right. This one turned out perfectly, even as leftovers. My 3y old even liked it. This one is a keeper.

This was the easiest salmon recipe I've ever made. I love how quick it was b/c I throw together last minute dinners all the time. The ingredients are usually on hand and if not, easily substituted. Thanks for an awesome, quick dinner idea!

This sauce is the BEST thing ever.  I LOVE it on potatoes, maybe even more than on the original chicken.  It's great on the chicken too, but it's so versatile-- you can cover everything on the plate with it-- your chicken, your veggies, your potatoes... heck, cover a gym shoe with this stuff and I'd eat it!

I cooked this and the 12 minutes recommended still had my salmon raw had to cook for like 15 more minutes. 
And do you cook in the oven with the skin side up too?

This recipe came out great!  I didn't even have all the ingredients.  I skipped the peppercorns and since I didn't have parsley, I used rosemary instead.  It seared beautifully and looks fantastic.  I can't wait to eat it.  Thanks for posting this quick and easy recipe.

I cooked this one for my husband, our 3 1/2 yr old son, and a houseguest and it was a big hit!  That's saying something because our son is a very picky eater...i served it over seasoned rice (with old bay, baltimore style) and with a fried squash recipe from here also!  Many rave reviews!

Amazing. I am no expert cook, but this recipe came out absolutely delicious. The boyfriend was well impressed too. I garnished the cooked salmon with some onions fried in the remainder of the butter seasoning...served with petite pois and mashed potatoe...yum! Definitely making that again!

My husband loved it, I altered it slightly by using the air fryer for 7 minutes on 350 degrees after searing it then I brushed the mixture over the salmon again once it was done

It’s really good, I used fresh cilantro and basil leaves instead of parsley and did 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper. Definitely making this one again!!!!

I made this without prior planning, so did not have fresh parsley, but this was melt-in-your-mouth delicious!  This will be my "go-to" salmon recipe from now on!

I had frozen salmon that was sitting in my freezer that needed to be used before it expired. My husband wanted me to prepare it differently than I usually do, which is broil with an Asian style dressing. I found this because we like lemon pepper seasoned seafood and chicken and it was a recipe I gad all the ingredients . The only thing I did differently, was that I used fresh chopped garlic instead of garlic powder, ( fresh garlic is always better!) My husband and I loved it.

OMG I loved this. I didn't  change anything, only I added additional lemon pepper (between 1/2 and 1 tsp). I will be baking this time and again! Thank You!

Excellent as written. My husband, who does not like salmon, ate his entire portion. This is also compliant with the candida diet.

Easy recipe, but I wish there was more seasoning. Instead of baking after sautéing, we just sautéed for 5-6 minutes instead which made the skin even crispier.

Great recipe. Got my family to try salmon with this recipe. I use a grill pan which gives it nice blackened strips

This turned out really well, but it didn't sear very well. There was too much sauce, so it almost boiled the salmon on the stovetop rather than sear it. The flavor was great and the salmon was moist.
