These enchiladas were delicious!!! I used garlic powder inplace of the minced garlic. I also "charred" my tortillas over an open flame before filling them. Yumm Yumm Yumm!! Very simple to make, I used 2 large frozen chicken breasts that I boiled in seasoned water then shredded.

These were yummy and easy, very Americanized though. I would skip this recipe if you're looking for something more authentic tasting, but as it is it's a very creamy, comforting dish. I didn't have the special Philly shredded cheese so I just used a regular bag of Mexican style cheese and added a couple tablespoons of cream cheese to the sauce mixture in the pan. Next time I'll probably add some cumin and cayenne to punch up the flavor a bit, and maybe use more salsa. Will make again.

These enchiladas are actually really delicious. I'm not big on cooking, nor am I really good at it, but this recipe is really simple. The directions are easy to follow, and they are tasty. 
I seasoned my skinless chicken breast fillets with salt and pepper and cooked them on the George grill and then shredded the chicken. Delicious!!!

Not bad. As Hubs put it, these were "a solid three," but they would have been easily improved with more sauce, plain and simple.

This recipe was AWESOME! We will definitely make it again :) The only thing I did differently was shred my own cheese from bricks (mix of jack and cheddar) and I seasoned 3 chicken breasts with homemade fajita seasoning (though, you could use store bought), pan seared them for 3 minutes per side, put a tight fitting lid and removed from heat for 20 mins. I shredded the chicken in a bowl with 2 forks and poured the pan juices over top. I wiped the pan and used that for the onions and, ultimately, the mixture for the insides of the enchiladas. I also cut the tortillas down to 6. We have 2 adults and 2 kids in the family. This was enough for 2 full dinners. I served it with Cuban inspired black beans, Vigo yellow rice, and an ensalata garnish.

Also, I assumed tomatillo salsa and salsa verde were equivalent because I used Pace's salsa verde.

Very simple to make and very tasty. I bought the 6in tortilla as the recipe calls for but it made 20 enchiladas! They turned out great so the way I see it, the more, the merrier!

We loved this!  Super easy.  I added some cumin and ancho chili seasoning to this for some extra "punch".  We will be having this again.

REALLY good!  Even the kids ate it (13, 11, and 8)!  My slow cooker cooked the chicken perfectly for shredding; then I  used regular salsa, didn't have garlic or green chilies. I added extra of the cheese and sour cream/salsa mix on top and voila!  Happy family! Will make again.

Four and a half stars. I used a quality tomatillo salsa in the chicken mixture and added a teaspoon each of cumin, mexican oregano and chili powder for more punch. I used sharp cheddar cheese and increased it to use a full 8 oz. block. I also used corn tortillas and fried them in oil before using them. This actually made enough to fill one 9x13 and one 8x8 glass baking dish. I used one thirty count package of corn tortillas. The big baking dish was served for dinner tonight and I covered the smaller baking dish with foil for my husband to warm for his lunch tomorrow after noon. I paired this with spanish rice and refried beans. I will make this again.

I really was not impressed with this at all.  Needed some spices to it.  As it is written, will not make it again.  If a white or green salsa was put on top, or a red sauce, it would give it some spice.  There was also too much sour cream for this and I really didn't like how it was put together with everything blended together and put in a tortilla.

I'm so glad I found this recipe! I've made these enchiladas several times and they always come out perfect. I love that most of the ingredients are usually already in my fridge. So easy to make and delicious!

Very, very good!  I didn't have any chili's so I used some spicy seasonings for a kick.  Other than that, followed it exactly.

I couldn't believe how great this recipe turned out!! Even my picky husband and son loved this one.  I used left over shredded pork that I cooked in the crockpot a couple days earlier instead of the chicken, but next time I will try it will leftover rotiseree chicken.  This was great with shredded pork, and only took a few minutes to throw together.  Great dish for a quick weekday dinner.

Pretty delicious and easy, but certainly not the most healthy dish.  Even my husband, who really dislikes chicken, thought they were pretty delicious! Good for nights when you don't have as much time!

I made this not long ago, and my Sweetheart LOVED IT...   Said they were the best Enchiladas he had ever had...   I had some of the chicken mixture left over after filling the Tortillas, so I poured it over the top of the Enchiladas before I covered with Salsa Verde, and Cheese...   This was a FABULOUS Recipe...   If you Love Chicken Enchiladas and you haven't tried it yet you should...  You won't be disappointed.

I use corn tortillas for enchiladas and freshen in hot oil long enough to soften them then pat dry with paper towels.  Uncover last 10 min with more cheese on top.

These were OK, DH and DS ate them, but they were very low on flavor.  These would be good for people who do not like spicy food.  Probably won't make this one again.

The chicken filling was delicious, no question.  The recipe calls for flour tortillas and I made exactly as directed but heated up the tortillas before filling because a reviewer recommended it.  After removing from the oven, the flour tortillas were soggy and ruined the whole meal.  My family loves food like this but I recommend using corn tortillas as is the norm with enchiladas. Bon Appétit.

Made exactly as written and while they were a crowd pleaser for a party with kids, I thought they were a little bland. I'll make again at home but spice them up some with cumin and cayenne or something. Pretty good and very easy which is great for big groups or week nights.

Cooked this a couple of different ways.  Did it up as a casserole (used the tortillas like lasagna noodles and didn't add the cheese until I started putting the whole thing together.

Tonight, tried it as filling for a chimichanga.  Just needed to thicken up the sauce with a little corn starch.  Turned out very nice!

I love this recipe! The only change I made was that I didn't use quite as much sour cream and I shredded 4 chicken thighs instead of the chicken breasts. Will definitely make this again!

I liked how easy these were.  Especially because I used canned Chicken - even easier.  The flavor was good and really hit the spot.  They did feel like they were missing something though.  Perhaps next time I will throw in some tomatoes or like a previous reviewer mentioned some chips fr crunch.  I cooked the enchiladas according to the directions and they were barely warm.  Next time I will increase the temp.  The other thing was they weren't all that saucy.  It was like baking them made the sauce just absorb into the tortillas.  Next time I will make more sauce, heat it up, then drizzle it on top when they come out the oven.  I will definitely make them again though - just with minor adjustments!

This recipe was a wonderful comprimise for my mexican loving husband and I. I tend to like more amernicanized mexican food and this was just what I've been looking for. I boiled and then shredded 8 chicken tenderloins and chose to use whole wheat flour tortillas to make it a little healthier. At my husband's suggestion, we made some queso blanco (white mexi cheese, half and half and green chilis) to put over the top. The enchiladas were large and I only ate one as a meal, but we are looking forward to the leftovers.

Made this for dinner tonight. It was great! To speed things up, I put a couple of chicken breasts in the crock pot before work this morning with a can of Rotel. Shredded it when I got home and fixed supper! My toddler wouldn't eat it but my husband and I both enjoyed it!

The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because I used ground turkey instead of shredded chicken.  This was very simple and very good.  I browned the ground turkey with the onion and minced garlic. I also seasoned the meat with a little salt and pepper while it was cooking.  I also just used mild salsa. Everything else I did as the recipe said.  I had a little of the meat/salsa mix left so I just sprinkled it over the top with the salsa/sour cream mix and cheese.  The whole family really liked it!

I used ground beef in this recipe, and did not have tomatillo salsa, so just used medium restaurant style salsa instead. I stayed true to everything else in the recipe and these turned out pretty good. I'll definitely make them again, but with chicken and tomatillo salsa for a different taste!

Very delicious.  My husband and I loved it.  I used regular salsa and added cumin, cilantro, and a dash of cayenne to the chicken.  This recipe also reheats very well.  The flavor is almost better the second day.  Great for lunch!

I will definitely make this again.My husband  and I both loved it. I tweaked to our tastes but the blueprint recipe was perfect. We like a little kick so we used medium heat salsa verde. I prefer Goya and used the entire bottle. I added cumin and black and red pepper to the meat mixture. I also put a thin layer of the salsa verde on the bottom of the baking dish - the corn tortillas just soaked it up. Added a little more cheese to the chicken mixture and added a drizzling of salsa verde over the sour cream mixture on top. Definitely be sure to cover with foil when baking. I honestly would not change a thing after tweaking and appreciate this great recipe!

Super easy and tasty! I would use corn tortillas instead of flour...I felt that flour made it a little mushy/doughy. I also added frozen corn and a can of black beans.

Surprised how well this turned out. Used canned green enchilada sauce and mostly Greek yogurt in place of sour cream, because I didn't want to use up all my sour cream. Also made double the sauce to use up the enchilada sauce; would probably not make quite that much next time. For meat I used frozen cooked pulled pork I had on hand.  Marinated and freshly cooked meat of course would be better. Would add cumin and cream cheese to the meat next time, too. This is a great basic enchilada recipe!

This was awesome I did make a couple of changes though. I cooked the chicken in McCormicks Fajita Seasoning and chicken broth let the liquid reduce down to a quarter cup of rouex add to your enchilada filling. Substitute minced garlic with garlic powder and onions with onion powder since I didn't have either on hand. Added 1/2 cup more of salsa Verde. These were gone my guys loved them. Served with Spanish Rice and refried beans. Will make again.

I'm rating this four instead of five stars, because the sauce needs to be doubled in my opinion.  I added some cilantro on top.

Super easy. I use 2 cans of Costco Kirkland brand canned chicken for the cooked chicken, and everything else exactly as written. Love it. Rated #1 in my recipe book meaning the family will all eat it for dinner. All of them. Wow. ;)

When first reading through, I thought it needed more seasoning. While cooking chicken I added  2 tablespoons of taco seasoning. I also used small can jalapenos instead of green chiles. Only had corn tortilla on hand--forgot to warm them before rolling--big mistake; half the corn tortillas CRACKED. If using  Mission Organic Corn Tortillas, warm them first. The "casserole" turned out tasty, the tweaking improving the taste.

Loved this... great, easy and  tasty way to use leftover chicken! I did add black olives to the topping and my husband added extra sour cream.

My wife and I love a roast chicken, but neither of us are fans of breast meat. This is where it ends up, deliciously so. This is a mild dish and some may want to kick it up with some diced fire.

My family loves the way it tastes and I love how quick and easy it is to make. We didn't make any changes to the recipe, but it would taste great with additional sauce, toppings of avocados, sliced black olives, diced tomatoes, or salsa and side dishes of refried beans or Mexican rice.

A relatively easy recipe to throw together on a work night.  I used a small rotisserie chicken for convenience which yielded 3 cups of chicken. I also added an additional 1/2 cup of verde and 1/2 cup of sour cream to have extra sauce on the top, and added about 2 T. of creamcheese to the mix since I didn't have the 'touch of phili' cheese. It seems like the bake time is underestimated, more like 35-40 was needed to make hot.  An easy Cinco De Mayo dish.

I added cilantro, corn, and some green peppers to the filling. These were great! I loved that I could make them ahead and mix them up as I wanted. Leftovers went fast! Will make again!

Great and easy recipe. I usually slow cook the chicken in taco seasoning and a little water. Easier to shred and adds flavor.

Great!  I used lite sour cream and shredded a block of Colby jack cheese.  When baking next time, I would cover for 15 minutes and then uncover for another 15 minutes.

Instead of sour cream, I use cream cheese and melt that in a pan on the stove with the salsa, then add the chiles and chicken when it's hot. Roll in tortillas, top with enchilada sauce (I use red), and add cheese the last 10 minutes of cooking. Yum!

I used this as a base. I added a lot of Cilantro to the inside of the enchiladas and heavily garnished the top with cilantro also before baking. Be creative with Veggies. I am always generous with fresh garlic. I also added cumin and coriander to the Chicken/veggie mix when it was cooking. Making your own green sauce/salsa is best with fresh tomatillos. I find the canned stuff has to many undesirable ingredients. Adding the Sour Cream to the salsa/sauce made for a very nice texture and flavor.

I made this *almost* as written, except for 2 material changes. I used CORN tortillas (because enchiladas do not use flour tortillas, and just bc I prefer them) - and since I couldn't seem to roll them without breaking them, I just layered everything into an enchilada casserole. It was delicious!! I should've heated the tortillas before layering to add a little texture and reduce sogginess, but it also turned out fine without preheating them.  But all the rest of the ingredients were used exactly as written, and it really is quite a yummy recipe.

Good start!!  If you want a more spicy cheesy kick, try this:  Season the chicken before cooking.  Skip the tomatillo salsa and shredded cheese.  Whip up two cans of Fiesta Nacho Cheese Sauce and spread that on the inside of the tortillas before you fill them.   It is mildly spicy, so adjust it to your taste with hot sauce, red salsa, or Frank's.  To really make this unhealthy and yummy, make extra sauce and  pour it over the pan of enchaladas before baking.  Add olives on top!

The cheese sauce is actually Campbell's soup, but you only mix it with half the milk to make it creamy.  When I make these, I don't even bother making side dishes.  We eat ourselves sick!  They also freeze extremely well for make-ahead dinners.  **If your tortillas get too soggy with the cheese sauce, grill them slightly before filling.

I love it. As is, it's delicious. Our family doesn't like a strong sour cream flavor so I'll add more salsa and a little  less sour cream. I don't really measure everything out and usually use about 12 tortilla's.

My husband loves this!  I love this recipe. I have also played with the recipe and added ingredients like bell pepper to the onions and switched up the chicken for beef or pork.   Using this recipe as a guideline I've incorporated ingredients I had on hand and it always turns out great.

Very good and an easy recipe. In Texas we use corn tortillas (fried slightly in oil and dried). Made as is with the addition of one can of Campbell's cream of chicken for flavor. I did also add cilantro to the enchiladas, as well as on top for presentation and extra Tex-Mex flavor.

Super yummy! I added 2 tsp cream cheese since I didn't have shredded cheese with Philadelphia. I saved some of the sour cream mixture and put on top with tomatillo salsa. Great for a person who loves Mexican without super spicy! Gonna add a few jalapeños next time.

It's a good and tasty recipe that's a great way to use leftover meat.  I used pork but it really would be good with any kind. I used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  It was good, you can't mess this up.  It is a bit mushy to me, next time I make it I would proudly use less salsa.  I also thought I would crunch up tortilla chips and throw them in to add some crunch.  Over the Border makes a verde salsa that's what I used instead of tomatillo salsa.

This was delicious! I used wheat tortillas and it was still absolutely amazing. I seasoned the chicken with some cayenne pepper powder and paprika. Other than that I used 100% to the T of the recipe. Amazing and easy to cook as well

Made them pretty much as stated in the recipe.  I added a touch more tomatillo salsa, and added 1 cup canned corn to the onion/garlic sauté.  The packaged Mexican Cheese blend was a 2-cup package, so used the whole thing.  My better half loved them--said "this recipe is a keeper!"  Very very easy to make.

Very family friendly and simple to put together. If it were just for me I would probably add more spice but it was perfect as is for my husband who doesn't like much heat. This ended up making about 10 enchiladas but I did use a large onion in the filling. Additionally I took the suggestions previously posted and used extra sauce- probably about 3 cups instead of 2. As with most recipes like this be sure to season as you go because it could get bland fast without some basic seasoning.

These enchiladas are very Americanized as another reviewer mentioned. I used jalapeños instead of chilies and it was very spicy- which was great since my husband likes spice. I also used half an onion and the sauce seemed to be sweet. I'm not sure I'll be making these again but the ingredients are simple and I happen to have everything the recipe called for.

I liked it but i inly give it three because next time i make a dish like this i would prefer the sourcream and salsa and chilis seperate on the side. I like to dip a hot enchilada into cold sourcream and i didnt like hie the cooked sourcream and salsa mixture loiked after baking. The flavors were nice together i will just tweek it to my taste and my kids taste next time. Chilis are a ni go for my kids and. Perhaps less onions. Yah my kids are flavor wimps.

Simple and delicious, hitting the spot for me! 
Used a pack of chicken finger cutlets which I "coated" in cajun spice and left for 30 mins before boiling and shredding the chicken (cooked it for about 20 mins until it was falling apart in the water). Added 1 whole jalepano to the sour cream/tomatillo sauce.

We have tried many variations and have loved every one of them. Examples: used regular red salsa, added green peppers, hot peppers, more cheese, less sour cream at times. We boil the chicken. Really fast, easy and quick dinner for those last minute nights.

I didn't have the cheese so I used regular Mexican cheese blend and 1 ounce of cream cheese. I like my enchiladas saucy so I also added a can of enchilada sauce to the last half of the salsa and sour cream mixture. Turned out awesome. We also used 10 inch tortillas and it made 7.
