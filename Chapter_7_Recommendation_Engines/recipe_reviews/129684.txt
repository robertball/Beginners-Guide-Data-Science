Very good.  Loved the lemony flavor.  I added tsp. of lemon zest and juice from one lemon.  I also used traditional graham cracker crust.

I made this cheesecake for Easter and everyone loved it! The lemon was just the right touch to make it a really wonderful, "Springy" dessert! I didn't have to change a thing, in the recipe.

This is a great cheesecake!  The batter comes out very thick (unusual for a cheesecake) and I was nervous, but it baked up beautifully (used a water bath).  I did not make the topping (no one seemed to miss it).  For the crust, I did not have the full amount of Nilla Wafers on hand, so I made my normal graham cracker crust, substituting 1/2 cup of crushed Nilla Wafers.  It added just the right touch of vanilla to the crust without overpowering it.  Loved the crust so much, I'll probably do the same on other flavors.    I still get compliments on this one, three weeks later!

This cheesecake is FANTASTIC! I don't top it with the Cool Whip, though. I serve it with either frozen raspberries or frozen strawberries in syrup. Everyone really enjoys this! :)

Absolutely divine! I made this a few years ago at Easter and came back to this recipe last week. My family loved this when I served it at a BBQ, but after it sat two days in the refridgerator it was even better. Yum factor, five stars.

Made this for a church supper and everyone loved it.  It was light and very lemmony.  Would recommend it. Don't change a thing.

I made this over the weekend for a party we were having and it was delicious!! I did make a few changes.  I spread lemon pie filling over the top and put the cool whip around the edge.  Instead of the chocoalte curls I just grated white chocolate over the lemon pie filling.  The whole cake was gone!!!

Very easy and very good.  The only thing I did not care for was the texture the pudding gives the cheesecake.  I thought it more of a ricotta cheese texture, but great flavor.

I made this recipe for my future mother-in-law and her friends, and they really enjoyed it as did I. I followed a recommendation from another reviewer and used strawberries in syrup instead of Cool-Whip.This recipe does produce a cheesecake that is less dense than a typical cheesecake, which I loved. However, the lemon pudding mix does take away from the "cheese" flavor.
