I doubled the broth mix, added another bell pepper, and used yellow curry.  Its now my wife's favorite dish.  I guess I'll be making it again soon.

My husband loved this recipe and he is very picky.  It was quick and very easy.  A great way to add some variety to everyday meals.

We really loved this! I found this recipe because I had a jar of mango chutney in the fridge that I didn't want it to go to waste and I'm really surprised at how great this turned out. My boyfriend said it was the first curry dish he actually liked!

Great recipe! I added more curry powder plus some hot sauce for a little kick. Will definitely make this again!

I thought it tasted good, but my boyfriend really loved it.  The only thing I sugest is cutting the celery insted of 2 inch, much smaller.  I would make this recepy again.

This was a great tasting dish.  Just beware that it is spicy.  I added 1 cup of the broth instead of 3/4 cup and a little more shrimp.  My husband loved it too!

Excellent.  I also added more broth and used red curry paste because that was all I had.  I didn't have any mango chutney either, but loved it anyway,
tasted gourmet.
Thanks for sharing.

Wow, I loved this! I think the only thing I'll do differently next time is add more red peppers.  Wonderful!
