I made this recipe with cauliflower, carrots and sweet peppers.  This taste great. I also halved the red pepper flakes ( I can`t take the heat). The only change I would make is to cut the salt. Other than that it's a great recipe.  I will make it again.

I have made this twice now and those who have tried it love it!  I personally have not tried because habaneros are too hot for me.  I used habaneros instead of hot chili peppers because it is what I had.  I also used a pickling spice blend as a sub for the allspice berries.  I will be making this every time I can find nice cauliflower at a good price.
