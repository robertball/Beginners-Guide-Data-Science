Excellent recipe. I added parsnips, which I regard as essential in Irish stew (mostly because I love them). Also, I used cornstarch instead of potato starch, since that's what I had in the pantry.

I used my trusty enameled cast iron pot. First I simmered lamb shoulder and leg cuts that had a lot of bones in 4 cups beef broth for about 2 hours. Then I cooked the veggies and herbs following the recipe. I added the meat which had been cleaned off the bones and 2 cups frozen white corn at the end. It was really yummy! A little sour cream on top is nice.(Extra broth is going into a lentil soup)
