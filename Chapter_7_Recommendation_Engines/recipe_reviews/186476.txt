This drink is one of the BEST drinks I've ever had!  It's even better than my own pom martini recipe, which is saying a lot!  Hubby and I have never had limoncello before, but the local liquor store had a coupon, so we decided to try it.  It's wonderful - think Lemon Head candy in liquid form!  This drink is a great combo of ingredients.  I did cut the pom juice down to only 2 oz. so it wouldn't overpower the limoncello, and it was just right.  My favorite brand of juice is Pom Wonderful, it has the best color and flavor.  Thank you so much for this drink recipe!

This was excellent! It reminded me of a cosmopolitan. I made some home-made limoncello and was looking for recipes to use it in. I find plain vodka strong. So, I did 2.5 oz of the limoncello and left out the vodka. For the pomegranite juice I used cranberry-pomegranite. I poured it over ice. Awesome!

Very tasty, but for me once was enough.  Tip...don't waste the Grey Goose on this drink. Any old cheap vodka is good enough.  You really wouldn't be able to taste the difference anyway.

This is absolutely the best Martini variation that I have ever tried. When I first tried this drink we were preparing for my daughters engagement party. We had covered nearly all the bases when I saw this recipe, we made a small batch and tried it, WOW it was wonderful. Made it right after the recipe, perfect!!! We made 10 Gallons of this Martini, and we ran out not even half way through the party. Made 10 more gallons, we had about 2 glasses full left at the end of the evening. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.

Too funny!!  I glanced at the review dated July 9 from "Dianne" and thought it said "Porn Martini."  That sure got my attention!  Thanks for the laugh.

As soon as I saw this recipe I ran to the kitchen with homemade Meyer lemon limoncello in hand.  Made as directed this martini was a little sweet for our tastes but adding a bit more vodka rectified that issue.  I am sure that it many people would find the sweetness spot on, however.  Next time I will use 2 ounces of pomegranate juice.  This is a very good drinkâ€¦kind of a cosmo on steroids.

Mother Goose, I had the same "reading" you had. I had to enlarge the font to make sure it was OK. Anyway, this is a fabulous take on a martini. Lots of yummy antioxidants to counteract the alcohol. Really delicious, but not too strong. YUM-O!!!

Liked this drink recipe a lot. We usually use fresh pomegranate, but when serving many people, it is too expensive. So, we did use Pom juice from Stonewall Kitchen. This particular brand is not too sweet. We also cut back on the Lemoncello and added a little more Vodka.  Did put some Pomegranate seeds in the champagne goblet when serving. A nice, festive  cocktail. Thank you.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and it is perfect!  I've had a hard time finding the right pomegranate martini.  I don't have to look any further!

This was okay and I agree that you should use a cheap Vodka as the other flavors overwhelm the taste. Seemed more like a punch than a martini. I perfer a good old Cosmo for a flavored martini
