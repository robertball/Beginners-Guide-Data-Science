This is SO good!!! I did add 8 oz diced mushrooms and 1 green pepper to the onions and bacon. This recipe makes about 5 1/2 cups of soup, so a serving is just under one cup.

I didn't have the McCormicks Steak seasoning so I used their Chicken seasoning. I think this a recipe that is good as is and could also be a good base to add any veggies or other proteins.
