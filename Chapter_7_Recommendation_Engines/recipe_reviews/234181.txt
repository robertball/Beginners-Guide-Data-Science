With these changes I would give it 5 stars:  Use chicken broth instead of water; coconut oil instead of olive oil; garlic powder instead of garlic; about 1/3 of an onion.  Add salt to taste.  Add 1 to 1 1/2 T shredded coconut.

Coconut Chicken Curry:
One small to med. chicken breast, cut in bite size pieces.  cook in 1 tsp. of coconut oil.  add spices to drippings to toast.

Great recipe! I substituted coconut oil for the vegetable oil for more coconutty flavor, and kicked up the spice with some red pepper flakes.

This recipe was good if you like a blander curry. There was no kick to it so I probably won't be in a hurry to make it again because we like spicy food. The only thing I did differently was use about double the oil for the paste as 1/4tsp wasn't enough and I added about double the cod as well because I looked at the amount asked for and it didn't seem enough. I'm glad I did.

This was just ugh.  It was bitter.  I am not sure what happened.  I tried adding sugar, lime juice, peanut butter, soy, and it was still barely edible.

This is such a hearty, comforting soup! My husband and I love it! I made a few changes to brighten up the flavor. I used chicken broth instead of just water, and I added carrots to sweeten it and give it a little more color. Lastly, I added a tablespoon of Chana masala to round out the curry flavor and give it a little spicy kick! I will definitely make this again!

Didn't have any coconut milk so I used coconut water.  Once it cooked off, I dredged my fish in egg and coated with coconut so I ended up with a crunchy crust instead of a sauce.  Also added some cilantro with the tomato at the finish.

A good starting point for a very mild fish curry. I used grouper cheeks. Totally needed salt and spice/heat.

This is a wonderful recipe. The first time, I made it as written. Today, I doubled the recipe and added a head of cauliflower. It's great!

Great quick dinner dish!!!  I substituted Coconut oil for the Olive oil as another reviewer (edon581) did; doing so seems to integrate the flavors better than the Olive oil (just add a bit more of the Coconut oil than what the recipe calls for with the Olive oil; it will help with pasting the seasonings).  I also added a bit of corn starch dissolved in cold water at the very end of cooking to thicken it some.

I served the curry over bowls of mixed wild rice and added fresh diced Thai Basil on top just before serving.  I splashed mine with a little lemon juice as well.

Another House favorite!!

Bland, no mention of salt or what kind of pepper to use.  If I do it again I'll use fresh curry and ginger. Way too little oil to make a paste or carry the flavor.  Thin, maybe will just use pure coconut milk or substitute chicken stock for the water like others suggested... but most likely, I'm just movin' on.

This is a good recipe. However, I made a couple of changes: I used fresh ginger, added a bit of garam masala and chilli to add a bit of a kick and I used some cornstarch to thicken the curry because I found it too watery.

I made the Coconut Fish Curry as the recipe showed it. I am giving it a four-star rating because, truthfully, the more we ate the better it tasted. My husband went back for seconds/scrapings. I loved the aftertaste, too. Next time I will add more seasonings because we like it spicier. I also think I will make it, refrigerate it overnight and serve it the next day.

Delicious! I used catfish instead of cod and added green peas and boiled potato cubes as well as cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit. Colorful and an awesome curry on top of a bed of rice.

A nice mild flavor but I am glad I read the reviews and used chicken stock instead of water. I also put a bit of salt and cayenne pepper. Otherwise I think it might be a bit bland. It is nice served with coconut rice and naan bread.

Very bland, no depth of flavor.  As one other person did, I added double the oil to make the paste. Very watery, so I thickened slightly.  Won't rush back to this recipe
