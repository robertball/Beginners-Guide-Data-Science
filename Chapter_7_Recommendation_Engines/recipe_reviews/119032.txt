YUM, we really enjoyed this dip! I did reduce the amount of cumin due to personal preference, and I didn't have any red pepper, so I just omitted them and topped it with some extra cheddar. This had such a wonderful flavor, and was great served with both crackers and Frito Scoops. I will definately be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)
