Delicious! I used toasted pecans. My pesto has a brownish color with flecks of the bright green basil. I used some on pasta and froze some for later use. Great recipe - I will be using it again! Update - I made this again with raw pecans. This time I got the lovely green color we all come to expect from a good pesto. I love what the sweetness of the pecans do for this pesto. Truly delicious!

Which type of basil leaves do you use? I grow sweet basil, boxwood basil and spicy basil.  Which would you recommend?

Thanks for the idea of using pecans! I will make this again. FYI, I toasted the pecans in the microwave first to add more depth of flavor. (Melt 2 tsp to 1 tablespoon butter or margarine in medium bowl; toss in 1 1/2 cup nuts. Spread nuts out evenly on large microwave safe plate and toast 1 minute at a time, stirring at those intervals until a nice toasty smell develops ~2-5 minutes. Check often as microwaves differ of course. Also, if the nuts seem too crowded, toast in more than one batch.)

I made this for dinner tonight.  Used pecans fresh from Georgia and basil freshly harvested from my garden.  Followed the proportions of the recipe exactly.  I didn't have parmesian cheese so I subbed pecorino romano and it worked out fine.  The recipe is silent as to which kind of olive oil to use-- I decided not to use EVOO in favor of lighter olive oil.  This pesto has a lovely delicate flavor that my family enjoyed served with crispy gnocchi.  Glad to have a delicious affordable alternative to pinenuts.  Thank you grettagirl for the delicious recipe.

I was so happy to find a recipe using pecans instead of pine nuts since realizing how expensive pine nuts are. I did  not toast the pecans and the pesto stayed green and was absolutely delicious!!

I always have a TON of basil in the summer. One day recently I wanted to make pesto, but only had pecans on hand. I saw that someone else had made it this way, so I knew I was good to go. It was tasty and just as good as traditional pine nut basil pesto. Thanks for confirming what I thought would be a good recipe.

Love this!  I cut back to 1 cup of pecans (not toasted) and it seems just right to me.  I put everything into the food processor except the oil, chopped it all up, and then added the oil through the tube as the processor was running.  Made a double batch last weekend and will probably do that again this weekend (storing in the freezer).  Food Network has a page of 50 things to do with pesto which has some great ideas.  Thanks for sharing your recipe; I never liked those pine nuts!

This was my first try at making pesto and it turned out wonderful.  So glad I tried this recipe.  I tried several others after this one, but none were nearly as good.   I made a big batch and froze it in ice cube trays.  The thawed pesto was very good as well.

Awesome!!!!  I used 1 cup pecans and 1/2 cup pine nuts, then added some lemon juice at the end.  Had some good quality parmesan cheese and basil from my CSA box.  This is a keeper!!

The fact that I could use  pecans, basil and garlic that I grow is always a plus and then the ease and taste take it over the top. Mixed it in spaghetti squash and it was an awesome side dish.

Great recipe but it came out a bit too dry. I added a good deal more olive oil and I also added some apple cider vinegar to give it a bit more tartness.

This pesto was on the rich side thanks to the high ratio of nuts in the recipe, but it was absolutely delicious! 
I will definitely use it again!

I have a bumper crop of basil this year so I wanted to turn some of it into pesto. Pine nuts are so expensive so when I saw this recipe called for pecans I figured this was the one to try. It is delicious!  I added 1/4 tsp of fresh lemon juice to it to help it keep its beautiful color.

I prefer pinenuts. But when all you have is pecans and your basil is ready to go, this recipe is great! I froze mine. They save really well in the freezer.

Very tasty pesto recipe!!  I always add a few leaves of fresh spinach to my pesto to give it a nice fresh green color.  Basil tends to turn murky brown when processed.

I have made pesto using almonds but wasn't sure about pecans.  Googled it and came up with this recipe.  Made it tonight and Yum!  I tend to have pecans and almonds on hand so now I know I can use both.
