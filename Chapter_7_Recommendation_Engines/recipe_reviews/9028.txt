We loved the premise of this recipe!  But, I have to say, I did change it quite a bit.  First, I doubled it and put it in a 9 x 13 pan.    I left out the bacon and mushrooms and all of the spices.  I used 4 cups of broth and 1 cup of water (broth comes in a 4 cup container) and added 2 cans of cream of whatever soup to add a bit of creaminess.  For spices, I subbed in 4 T of curry powder which gave it a great spiceyness.  I used leftover chicken, whatever I had on hand.  Then, I chopped the veggies I had in the fridge and sauted them with the onions before mixing it all together.  A mixing tip, mix the soup with the veggies and then stir into the broth and barely - makes the entire process go better.  Topped with shreeded soy cheese...  It took 1 hour 20 minutes to bake, but my oven tends to be slow.  Over all, a great idea of a recipe that seems easily modifiable into whatever you happen to have on hand!  We will definitly make this again.

This was nice but bland.  I made a few changes - I added celery (with the green peppers) to the veggies. I also added in some dried sweetened cranberries.  I omitted the crushed bay leaves and bacon, and used olive oil to sautee the veggies.  I used boneless chicken breasts instead of dark meat.  If I make this again, I might add in 1/2 can (or a whole can) of creamy soup (crm of mushroom maybe?) to make the dish a little creamy.  Great as leftovers.  I sprinkled some crumbled blue cheese on the leftovers and it was really yummy!

This was tasty -- a great change from chicken & rice.  After reading others' reviews, I did make a few changes:  1. I omitted the bacon.  2. I didn't sautee anything in advance -- just mixed everything together in a baking dish and put the raw chicken on top.  3. I doubled the marjoram and parsley and halved the thyme (don't like thyme much).  4. I salted/peppered the chicken breasts and sprinkled extra marjoram on top of them.  The verdict: Easy, moist, healthy, and delicious!

I made this recipe and my husband had 'three lots of 2nds'.  He was a bit weary about the barley, as I have never cooked with it before, but he did enjoy it.  My kids who are 'picky eaters' ate more of the vegetable mix than I expected them too. I tricked them and told them it was a type of rice. I'll definitely cook it again. Having never cooked with Barley before, I wasn't sure whether you had to soak the Barley, before putting it in the dish. I boiled it while I was preparing the vegetables.

Very good.  I added a little tumeric ( adds a nice yellow color), omitted bell pepper and stirred chopped cooked chicken into the casserole with the other ingredients instead of laying chicken on the top.

this was superb, but wouldn't use crushed bay leaves again. No matter how fine they are someone will find a sharp piece.

To really punch up this recipe, use an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce in addition to the chicken stock.  Additionally, use fresh herbs. . . a wonderful cool day, put in the oven & foget, tasty chicken dish.

I omitted the bacon, used chicken breasts, and skipped the green peppers (because I don't like them). It turned out pretty well. I like the suggestion some made of the cream of chicken (or cream of mushroom) soup. I think that would add a lot.

Wonderful flavor and texture, I discarded all but 1 Tbsp. of bacon fat before sauteing the vegs. This will be a mainstay for chicken at our house.

Delicious! The flavours all come together to make a really rich-tasting dish. I did omit the bacon (oh the horror! but we'd already used up our bacon "rations" for the week) and browned the chicken in a mixture of butter and olive oil. Also, I was able to fit in 8 small boneless, skinless chicken thighs, which was plenty for 4 adult servings. Will definitely make this again!

I found this recipe very time consuming and the finished product was very greasy.  My kids wouldn't eat it, and they are NOT finicky eaters. I love barley but this recipe was definitely not worth the effort.

This is very yummy and filling with a few changes made. First, I used turkey sausage instead of bacon. I added way more veggies and didn't rest them on top as suggested- I just dumped them all together. Also, instead of dark meat, I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. All in all, a great recipe to play with- it's an excellent way to use up all the odd bits of veggies in your fridge!

It's really good with a can of cream of mushroom soup.  One suggestion, saute the mushrooms with the onions and a clove or two of garlic.  It brings out their flavor and keeps them from getting too soggy in the casserole.  I will definitely have this again!

Very good recipe.  I did not add any bacon or green pepper since I did not have any, and I used chicken breast instead of dark meat.  Also, I did not add mushrooms because of my husband.  Next time I will add celery and more carrots to make it even healthier.  The only downside is that my 2-year-old did not like all the seasoning and tried to pick it off the barley.

This is a great recipe!  As one of the other members suggested, I did add a can of low sodium Cream of Chicken Soup, which made the barley mixture even creamer.  It was so good there were no leftovers!

The recipe wasn't bad. It just wasn't anything special. We love barley in this family, and we decided it was better to make a seperate barley side dish, and something with a little more flavor as a chicken dish. I will keep it handy as a back up, because it is a nice change from the norm.

I used three slices of Nueskes bacon, which is a thick slice, smokey flavored bacon.  Also changed the vegetables to what I had on hand: one small shallot, one clove garlic, red pepper, green and yellow zucchini.  I had cooked chicken so just added that to the pot.  It was delicious!

This recipe is yummy!  I didn't add the bacon or mushrooms because I didn't have any. I also used basil and oregano the second time instead of the recommended spices, just because our family likes the basil/oregano taste better.  This is a staple meal in our house now!

Very tasty weekday meal. Just a couple of changes. I also sauteed the veggies first and added celery instead of the green pepper.  Also used 3 tsps of poultry seasoning as I had no marjoram on hand and it turned out to be quite delicious. The sage and smoky bacon flavour go very well together. I also used 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs along with 2 boneless skinless breasts to please the white meat eaters in the house! I would probably decrease the liquid to 2 c. of stock rather than 2 1/2 as I found it quite runny even after 1 hr & 20 minutes in the oven. 
All in all, very good.

Loved this recipe!!  I was looking for a chicken casserole and it seemed every recipe was just a variation of something else.  This one stood out as different.  The first time I made it I took my time to get everything as the recipe called for (I didn't trim the fat from the bacon though).  Now I just breeze through it.  It's shocking how much this recipe makes, I was a little skeptical when I had all my ingredients prepped and was about to start cooking, but was pleased when I was cleaning up and saw I had enough for lunch the next day.  Thanks for the great recipe!  It's an instant classic.

I followed talltexan's advice and mixed all the ingredients in a greased baking dish, topped it with raw chicken, and sprinkled the chicken with herbes de provence and cracked pepper. Instead of measuring out each spice I just used around 1 Tb herbes de provence in  the dish itself and subbed a whole bay leaf for the crushed. The end result would have been perfect but mine was so runny that I had to use a slotted spoon to serve. It was almost like a stew. I will definitely make this again with less broth or try baking it uncovered.

this was pretty good, I did have to add about 1 c. more chx broth, as my barley wouldn't softed up like I wanted.  I also omitted the carrots and green peppers, as I didn't have any on hand.  I did add some curry powder as per another reviewers suggestion.  Overall a good recipe, not mind blowing, but easy and tasty.

Slendid recipe.  A little sauteing and then pop it in the oven.

My family loved this recipe. I added okra and garlic,  and followed the recipe.  I will be making this again for sure!

We loved this hearty casserole!  I read the reviews and made made a couple changes. Did not use bacon but will include it next time. I cooked a whole chicken to make my own stock and used the meat from the whole chicken as well as my homemade stock. I also added celery, pea pods and zucchini.  A few cooks added a cream soup for binder and thickener but I used 4 oz cream cheese.  Very good for a cold January night in Minnesota!

This is a nice fall recipe. A bit bland though. I used chicken breast instead of dark chicken because we like that better.  I added more herbs and some cream of mushroom soup to add more flavor. Will make again with some changes.

I cut the chicken into chunks and mixed into barley mixture.  Added a bit of white wine.  I ended up cooking about 20 minutes longer with the cover off to help evaporate some of the liquid.  Very tasty and filling.

I made this twice.  Once with the chicken as a meal but I found the chicken to be dry.  However, I made it as a side dish and we liked it so much better.  I cooked the bacon but omitted it from the recipe.  I used the bacon grease to sauté vegetables.  I used carrots, zucchini, onion and garlic.  I chopped the zucchini and carrots into very small pieces.  I added all of the spices and cooked it in a casserole dish.  We really enjoyed it as a side dish, but not cooked with the chicken (I did the chicken separate).

Good but it was a bit bland. So next time I will double up on the herbs and add a dash of tumeric.

This was really tasty. I used homemade chicken stock and chicken thighs and the flavour was lovely. My BF even took the leftovers to work the next day.

not a big hit at my house.  way too bland, despite the use of cream of mushroom soup, and garlic, in addition to the spices from the recipe.  the bacon seems really out of place and pointless, i thought it would lend some salt and flavor but it didn't.  i'll finish what i made, but won't make it again.

Yum!  I also used white chicken breasts instead of dark.  Didn't have any mushrooms or carrots, but I added chopped celery and halved grape tomatoes.  This was very tasty and satisfying!
