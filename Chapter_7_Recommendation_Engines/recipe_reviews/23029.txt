This recipe did not work at all for me, maybe because I do not have a bread machine.  I followed the recipe to the letter and kneaded the dough as I do with all my other (successful) bread doughs, but it did not rise at all.  I tasted it anyway and it wasn't bad, but obviously it isn't like a normal bread. My husband was really looking forward to this bread as his Polish grandmother used to make it, and needless to say, we are both disappointed!

To the person who said they used the oven instead of the machine: thanks! My mother and I have been using my great great Babka's recipe for years. It's still handwritten. I just joined and will be posting it. Thanks to Verla for having at least one version of it! I can now make it at home til I sneak the recipe from my mom! It is delicious, but you really do need it to be made in the oven. A bread machine does not do this justice. Make sure to add walnuts to your mixture and use REAL butter. The milk should be at room temp, as should your eggs. It will give the bread an amazing quality! I promise! From one Polish fam to others!

Our family roll recipe from here on out!  I have a bread machine, but it's packed up, so I mixed the order up ...  the yeast needs sugar to proof so I put it in with the milk, butter, sugar.  After it dissolved,  I added vanilla and sea salt then the flour.  I had no problem getting it to rise every step. 20 minutes in the oven...  like butter!  Yummy! Thank you!  If you don't agree you're dong it wrong.

This was a wonderful bread just what I was looking for. Followed the recipe and it came out perfect. I think it was even better the next day.. Made two loaves and I froze one and when I thawed it it was just a good as the fresh.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I tried to make this recipe two times.  Each time I got the same results.  The dough never came together into a ball - it turned into just a mixture of dry ingredients.  My only guess is that it needs more than the required 1/2 cup of milk for the 4 cups of flour.

Alright people if you don't have a bread machine PROOF the yeast first my recommendation is taking a half cup of that milk(before scolding it), warming it up some how...add the yeast, and in addition to what the recipe calls for add a tablespoon of sugar..Let sit for about ten minutes and there yah go!

This recipe turned out really well.  I don't have a bread machine so I had to guess some about the yeast, but it worked out well.

DELICIOUS!!  Almost like a hawaiian sweet bread. Everyone loved this bread! It was gone by the end of the night. I did it in my breadmaker under sweet bread setting. I will make this again for sure!!

This recipe brought back wonderful memories from my childhood, but it was 1000 times easier than the way my mother makes it by hand.  I love my bread machine.  I made the recipe in the bread machine then used it to make braided breads instead of using loaf pans.  I topped it with green colored coconut and jelly beans over an orange juice flavored confectioners sugar glaze.  Beautiful and delicious.  I also cut it into thin 6 inch strips and twisted into bunnies, in the shape of an upside down memory ribbon twist, and put a small round ball of dough to make a tail in the twist junction.  I also frosted those in the orange frosting nad dipped the bottom in green coconut so it looks like a bunny sitting in grass.  Happy Easter!

This dough did not rise.  I'm certain the yeast was active, as I proofed it before using it in the recipe.

I dislike recipes that claim their simple but require an a expense for buying machinery. be honest and say you need to own an odd piece of machinery like a bread maker. Its not a recipe its a group of ingredients thrown in a machine

This bread is AWESOME. I changed the topping, though; instead of doing the crumbly topping that the recipe says, I made a honey and egg mixture and brushed it onto the top before baking. You still get the sweetness that you'd get from the crumble topping, but without as much of a mess.

2nd time making this. It turned out great again. Substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour for one of the 4 cups of bread flour. The family loves it!
