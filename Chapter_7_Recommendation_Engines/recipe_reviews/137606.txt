Let me start by saying, I love garlic every which way... except raw. By the time the eggs were cooked properly, the garlic was still pretty raw. I really wish I would have sauteed the garlic separately before adding the eggs. I loved the cilantro and thought it was the perfect amount, but the garlic killed it for me. I'll make these again, but cook the garlic a bit first. Thanks :)

I really enjoyed it, using home grown cilantro (very strong) and extra parmesan.  Others that I shared it with liked it but were not as excited about it as myself, as they were not big cilantro fans.  If you like cilantro you gotta try this!

This is good.  There is a very strong cilantro taste, so it could be cut down a bit. However, bf and I liked it.  Thanks!

Thanks for this recipe idea. I only ever eat eggs over easy, boiled, or in omelettes/frittatas, so this was a good incentive for me (being a BIG garlic and cilantro lover) to have them scrambled. I eyeballed the amounts and used more of both in my eggs. Tasty.

The cilantro gave the dish a very fresh taste but was a bit overwhelming. I'll cut down to 1 TBS next time.  And, even though I love garlic, I'll be sure to use a smaller clove next time.  But we did enjoy it - yum, sour cream - and will make again, perhaps as an omelet with cheese inside!  Thanks!

This is a nice variation to the boring scrambled egg.  I made it exactly as written - here is what I will change next time I make it:  instead of garlic, I will use garlic powder, I will add chopped onion and omit the parm cheese.  A little hot sauce, and I think it will be perfect!  I eat an egg everyday and was looking for a new way to prepare - this is the perfect canvass to build on in my opinion.  (I didn't use the full amount of cilantro)

Considering the fact that I used Egg Beaters, fat free sour cream, no added salt, and no butter (used spray in pan), it helped put some flavor into those Egg Beaters. I still would prefer to have eggs with mushrooms, onions, red peppers and a little bacon, so for that reason I have to give this 4****.

This is tasty! I left off the parmesan and used plain yogurt instead of sour cream. Also sauteed my garlic first and added a dash of cumin. Ate them with a small extra dollop of yogurt.

I have a lot of trouble finding good scrambled egg recipes as I am not a big fan of plain eggs.  This recipe turned out great though!  I took the suggestion of cooking the garlic some before adding it to the mix.  Over all, very good recipe.  I liked it a lot.

Pretty delicous.  It gives you opportunity to add other things as well, sausage, corn tortillas, onions.

I really thought that I was going to like this one but I was surprised that I was just not that impressed.  May try it again but saute the garlic instead of putting it in with the eggs.

Let me start off by saying that I don't eat eggs.  I made these for my husband and he said they were good but needed something... he suggested some diced tomato so we'll add that next time.  I made mine with skim milk and reduced fat sour cream and I found that there was a lot of liquid in the pan even after the eggs were fully cooked.  Not sure if that's from the above mentioned items or not.  I drained it before serving.

I really enjoyed the flavors going on in this dish, I used extra cilantro sprinkled on top before serving ... my boyfriend found it to be a bit too garlicky for the morning ... I'll make this again but use slightly less garlic to keep him happy!

I love scrambled eggs, so I had to try this version. Since I was out of milk, I omitted it, but I didn't notice any effect on this recipe. Also, I added the salt and pepper to the final product rather than putting it in the egg mixture. After I ate mine, my father requested a serving for himself. (Guess I'm heading back to the kitchen!) Thanks David!

I used only about a tablespoon of cilantro, any more would have been too much.  I tried cooking this omelet style (I still mixed all the ingredients together but then omitted the butter, used cooking spray and tried to cook it as one flat product that I could fold onto sandwiches), but this did not work.  The eggs were not holding all together.  This is really meant to be scrambled.  Still tasted pretty good!

Whenever you have fresh cilantro on hand, you absolutely must make these eggs.  Don't be afraid to be a little heavy with the black pepper; it really does add to this overall flavor of the dish.

I thought this was good.  The cilantro was a little strong for me, but that could have been just a personal taste.  Otherwise, great!

Excellent.  I used garlic powder (as I had no garlic cloves) and added onion powder.  Also, I subbed nonfat yogurt for the sour cream.  Great recipe!

Whoa. So yummy!! and a tasty spin on salt & pepper-seasoned scrambled eggs. I used cilantro/parsley mix, garlic/parsley butter, and left out the milk because it doesn't agree with me (though sour cream is fine), and crema agria (mexican sour cream) + powdered parm (kind used for spaghetti). So delicious!!

Good recipe. Unable to find fresh cilantro - so had to use dried. This probably impacted the taste. Boys enjoyed it - sure beats straight-up scrambled! Would do it again.

I am not a big egg eater in the mornings but my husband likes them so thought I would try this one.  It was different than the normal scrambled eggs. I could eat this again.  I didn't have fresh cilantro so used a little dry. Thanks for something different!

Was looking for a way to use sour cream in my eggs, this was a fun change. I don't like cilantro though, I used avocado and paprika instead.

The dish was very lovely! I made this without realizing that this was an actual recipe! But I didn't use the garlic. Instead, I used a pinch of Jonney's Seasoning and it was equally good.

Delicious- I had some ingredients in fridge I wanted to use up, so I added a couple things.  I sautéed the garlic with cumin and diced jalapeño and red onion, then added the eggs (with the cilantro and extra sour cream bc I am out of milk) added salt and pepper to taste.  I added extra fresh cilantro on top (I LOVE cilantro & it’s good for you!!), some chili lime hot sauce, & some salsa verde. YUM! Thanks for the recipe!

I made as directed and thought they were good but a little too heavy on the garlic. Maybe the clove was just too big  or too strong. Either way I would omit next time and maybe add a cayenne or hot salsa.   We have a lot of cilantro in the garden right now so it was a great way to use some of it.  The sour cream was a nice change too. Good recipe! Thanks.

The cilantro worked well with the eggs however it needed other flavors to bring it all together.

This was absolutely delicious and my family loved it. Instead of parmesean cheese I used feta cheese and it was soooo good.  I had to substitute the cilantro with parsley.  I will try cilantro next time but it was delicous anyway. I will be making this again and again.

Every one in the family enjoyed this one.  I did use less cilantro than was called for just because of how strong it is.

After reading the reviews I opted to crush the garlic rather than mince it - turned out beautifully. I substituted dried cilantro for fresh (about a 1/2 T) and added a little white wine. Superb!

This was really tasty!!! I love the fresh herb taste that really livened up the eggs! I used liquid egg whites and omitted the sour cream and milk. I just left it as an omelet and didn't scramble it. I will make this again.

This is a excellent recipe. I did adjust the recipe a little. Instead of putting the cilantro in the eggs, I stopped at my local mexican restaurant and bought some salsa and topped the eggs with the salsa. Excellent!:-)

This was good and different.  It tasted garden fresh!  Good way to use up some cilantro.  My 4 year old wouldn't touch it, but that was expected!

This was a nice change to the traditional scrabble egg. Great flavoring. We love garlic and cilantro in this house so this is definatly a keeper!
