I took the warning of the other reviewer and left out the sour cream, so this salad looked lovely and tasted pretty good.

I pretty much knew when I added the sour cream to the dressing that this was not going to be an "eye-pleasing" salad, and I was right.  I didn't think the sour cream added anything to the flavor and made the dressing just look like a milky liquid.  We all "eat with our eyes, so that was one strike against it. I also think this just had too many different herbs, and after chilling for about an hour, was soggy and limp.   I followed the recipe to the letter, and this one just didn't work for us (and this is a house that loves cucumber salads).  I'm sorry to be so harsh for the first review, but I also want to be honest.  And I'll admit that this review  could be just a personal taste preference on our part.  I'm giving this 3 stars because I don't want to discourage others from trying it, but I won't be making this again.
