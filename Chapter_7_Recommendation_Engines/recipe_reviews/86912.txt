Left out the cilantro (not a fan of it), otherwise followed exactly as printed...and WOW!!! Took this amazing recipe to a Church potluck, and wished I'd had the foresight to print off about 20 copies. It was well received. Thank you Kiki, great job.

Awesome recipe! I've taken this to several parties & always leave with an empty bowl and many requests for the recipe. I usually do use serrano peppers though, just for a little more heat. And I also add freshly sliced red onion to the marinade. Looks good served in a large glass bowl.

I agree with a previous reviewer - this is an odd combo and not good. There is no shrimp flavor - just an overpowering marinade that is sour/sweet in a very strange way. Hate to rate this so badly but I can't recommend to anyone to waste a perfectly good batch of fresh shrimp on this recipe.

I didn't love these. A little too sweet for my tastes. I'll keep looking for a marinated shrimp recipe...

Wasn't a big hit with my company.  Kind of bland.

We only had a hour or two to marinate it, and I slightly over cooked the shrimp on the BBQ, but the taste was still great.  Looking forward to next time when we will allow the shrimp to marinate longer and cook shorter.

It wasn't really bad but it wasn't a shrimp type taste. Just kinda odd. I don't think we'll be using it again. Thanks anyway though. :-)

Everyone loved this!  I marinated it for about 36-40hours.  I couldn't find any cilantro so I left it out.  I will make it again.
