This is one of the best recipes I've ever tasted. My husband made this. The only thing is that it was a little dry, so we added a small can of tomato sauce. To make it a little spicier we added some cayanne pepper. Otherwise, this is the best. My husband said that this recipe is a keeper! (And coming from him, it's a big compliment.)

This is a great base recipe. To it I always add green pepper, red pepper, jalapeno, and a little salsa. I also double the cumin and chili powder. Overall an excellent base and good thick chili

This chilli is really, really easy to make.  I thought it was a bit strange that you don't brown the meat before everything else but it made the ground beef less chunky this way.  The flavor isn't too strong like some chilli's are and my roommate loved it!  Don't count on it feeding 6 people.  More like three.

Excellent base chili recipe; if you follow it word for word, I could see how some would say this dish was bland, but with a little creativity you’ve got a winner.  I added green & red bell peppers, corn salsa, diced tomatoes with green chilies, poblano pepper and some Tabasco sauce.  Next time I do make this I’m going to omit the whole tomatoes and just double up on diced tomatoes, maybe pop in some jalapenos too (to make it have a little more kick).

Excellent. One of "The" best *Chili's* ever made. I make this recipe at least 2 times a month. You can freeze it or leave it as leftovers. It is very savory, hearty, just the right amount of spiciness. Not too liquidly, or too chunky. I add a little more tomatoes, and some chives ( which I understand most  people would not like in theirs though). A must have for your recipe box, viva la chili.

Really great recipe for beginners. This was the first time I made chili and this recipe was simple to follow, pretty quick and tasty. I definitely had to play with the measurements in order to get the desired flavor but the recipe provides a great base for flavors. Great recipe : )

While making this, my partner and I thought it lacked a bit of oomph, so we added a can of corn kernels, and a jar of salsa. With these additions we reckon its a 5 star recipe and will be making  it often! Thanks for a great base recipe!

I was intrigued by the unusual technique of this chili recipe. Usually you don't think of making a roux for chile but...it works! Followed directions exactly and spiced it up a bit with some chipotle chili powder and chopped jalapeno,cheese on top and it was perfect for our taste.

This was so good, added some bell peppers, and extra chili flakes. Served it with tortilla chips and a side of uncooked sambals to my husband and his friends, and they loved it. It goes really well with beer, and the more they ate, the more they drank! :-) Will definitely make this again.

Great recipe and easy to follow. I did do some modifications like adding the spices to the onions while sauteing them,  browning the mince  on its own then add a cupful of beer. We like spicy food so  I jazzed it up with chili garlic sauce and Cajun seasoning. Cooked it till thick but still with some liquid left in the pot as it will thicken upon standing. Served it on rice and topped with grated cheese and crushed corn chips. DH loved it, had seconds, even thirds and brought leftovers for lunch the next day.

Like others have said- this is a great base! I used ground turkey instead of beef and used cayenne pepper, ground mustard, more chili powder and even added a little sugar at the end for a little sweet/spicy kick. Served over rice. Next time I'll serve with corn muffins. This is a keeper!

Good. Loved it myself, being the first time I made Chili con Carne, added heaps of Cinimon though because im crazy about it and served on rice with cornchips because it was quite HOT. (too hot for my mother) But everyone else enjoyed it heaps.

I am now the BEST chili cook in my family thanks to this recipe.  I added some cinnamon for a different feel, and this time will be adding Tobasco.  Also, I didn't have any paste, and added double the amount of tomatoes.  I am back online getting the recipe again to make a 4x batch.  It just goes soooo fast!

Yes, very easy to make, used steak instead of ground beef. Took many liberties with the spices,(could see it would be bland) was still seasoning while I was getting ready to serve. Will make again.

NOT for spice lovers!!  Easy to make, but Very Bland and "Tasteless".  Needs more spices and maybe some hot peppers and tobasco sauce.

Very mild foundation chili with the right flavor. Ready for whatever hot spices people would like to add. 
I didn't have tomato paste. Still tasted fine. 

For me the salt and pepper wound up being: 
salt (1.25 tsp salt minimum)
ground black pepper  (1.75 tsp black ppr) 

Notes: Be careful at the beginning not to burn the garlic and onions.  I also found it a little too easy to cook off too much liquid, but you can always add a little water back in.

excellent recipe that I serve with a couple pieces of American cheese and chopped sweet onions.  Put under broiler for about 2-4 min.

Very fast and easy to make.  I agree with other reviewers in that this chili is not very spicy.  I added several dashes of Tabasco and some crushed cayenne pepper to fix it.  The only real complaint I have is that the chili was not "soupy" enough; it was very chunky and was better eaten with a fork.  I think added a little bit of water next time will make it better.  Overall, very delicious and I will make it again.

Scaled this recipe to 30 portions and it only just made it no seconds. Also added more tomato paste than the recipe suggested. Otherwise a good recipe nice flavour and texture.

I thought it was easy to make, but a little bland.  Deffinitly not for people with a spicy taste for food.  I would make it again, but adding a lot more spices.

I tried this recipe because I was bored with my usual one for chilli - I had to omit the coriander because I couldn't get hold of any.
It made a tasty dish as it stands but I like to add some hot mango chutney to give it a slightly sweet finish.

As with any recipe, one adds/adjusts to the amount needed or for personal flavour.  I used 'extra hot chilli powder' but in slightly less quantity and loved the build up of the warmth. 

In addition, I used more tomato paste as well and added an equal amount of the white kidney beans to the red beans.  All in all, it was the perfect base as is and also for tweeking as you like.

I served it on a bed of steamed white and wild rice mix. Perfect also with some french croustillant bread to mop up any juices.

It came out perfect!  I was lucky to save a bowl for lunch the next day because none was left.

First of all it's hard to cook onions without some oil.  Secondly the texture is weird because the beef is not browned first, thirdly the times quoted are all out of whack and finally, it does really only feed four.  Other than that, it tasted pretty good (except for the beef texture).

I loved this Chili really full of flavor and easy to make, kinda reminds me of Wendy's Chili which is one of my favorite chili.  The recipe does not call for Jalepenos (hot) peppers which I appreciated since I am not a person who likes super spicey (hot) tasting food, but if a person wanted to they could add it to this recipe for their taste.  This chili was spiced just right for me.  This will be a regular meal in my house!  Thank you
