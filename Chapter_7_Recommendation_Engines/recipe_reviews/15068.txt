Simple, light, quick, and really quite good.  After a couple of bites we declared this dish an everyday keeper. It even looks attractive on the plate.

I do think the recipe is improved by taking a moment to add a little seasoning. Here are the details of what I did:

Instead of using a greased cookie sheet, I used parchment paper. 

Before cooking, using a paint brush, I brushed each side of the eggplant slices with olive oil to coat the entire surface and then seasoned well with salt and black pepper on both sides. Then I sprinkled on some dried basil (had no fresh basil on hand). Topped this with the tomato slice and then topped that with FRESH grated parmesan cheese. 400 degrees for about 20 minutes did the trick; timing was not too critical.

I thought this was delicious!  I did it a little differently though.  I layered it this way:  eggplant, parmesan, tomato, pepperjack cheese and topped with basil.  This is a great variation.

Following some suggestions here, I brushed the eggplant lightly with olive oil and lightly seasoned both the eggplant and the tomato with salt, pepper, and basil. With a ripe heirloom tomato and freshly grated parmesan, this was delicious.

This was a good way to use eggplant, although the recipe should note the eggplant should be peeled.

Very good starter, much better than similar recipes which call for tomato sauce. I brushed the eggplant with olive oil and sprinkled them with garlic salt. I also added oregano on top of the cheese. It turned out wonderful.

I made this appetizer instead of dinner yesterday. It turned out very tasty and looked great with few alterations. 
I took the eggplant skin off (just my preference) and lightly brushed each circle with olive oil. I added seasoning (salt, pepper and basil) in between the eggplant and tomato and tomato and cheese. I used some mozzarella and some Parmesan cheese since this is what I had on hand. I baked it covered at 400 degrees for about 35 minutes and then uncovered for about additional 15 to make the eggplant soft  which is the way I like it.

This is an extremely easy and delicious recipe!  I did not brush the eggplant slices with olive oil to avoid unneeded calories, and they came out just fine.  I did season with salt and pepper.  On a couple I layered some spinach between the eggplant and tomato slices, and those came out good too.  Highly recommended recipe!

Scrumptious!  I took the advice of some others and added spinach, mozzarella and fresh basil on top. This is definitely a keeper!

YUM! I'm not a big eggplant fan, but this was delicious.  I added all the extras: a little olive oil, italian spices, salt & pepper, parmesan, and some mozarella. It was like pizza without the bread.

This was alright.  My family was not impressed, but I think this could be better very easily.  The main problem is that the texture of the eggplant is a big make it or break factor for this dish.  Cooking as directed for 10-15 minutes was not long enough.  This would taste awesome if the eggplant were tender, but it was tough and chewy.  I might try this again, but I'll cook it longer and/or slice the eggplant thinner next time.

Wow! These were really good! I'm not a big fan of eggplant either. I brushed tops with olive oil, added parm. cheese, tomato, and then topped with fat free mozarella. Delicious!!

I poured a little olive oil over the top of the eggplant, this makes them not so dry. I added some tomato sauce over the tomatoes, and used deli sliced mozzarella. I also grated a bit of smoke gouda over. Could use smoked mozzarella, as well. I sprinkled some garlic salt over.

Loved it .... after adding salt and pepper, pesto, and EVOO.  Even though this added calories, it is still next-to-nothing calories.  YUM.  I think it's more like an appetizer.    I left on the eggplant skin and baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes was nice.

Deliciously awesome! If you like eggplant, you'll love this dish. I made just a few changes - I very lightly brushed all sides and edges of eggplant slices (except the top) with olive oil, then lightly brushed a very thin layer of pesto (cuz I had it in my fridge) on the top, then added a bit of salt, pepper and dried basil on top of that before adding the tomato slice. I sprinkled more salt/pepper/basil on the tomato then put some mozzarella on that. I baked it for about 20 minutes and it turned out oh so good!

I salted the eggplant rounds and let them sweat for 30 minutes and rinsed. That is key to removing bitterness and honestly I think it helps the mush factor.  Otherwise I made these exactly as written with a hint of garlic salt and it was amazing. I baked for 15 minutes and these weren't mushy at all but still tender enough to eat.  All of my ingredients were from my garden. Even those around the house who don't like Eggplant liked it this way. Thanks for sharing.

This was fantastic!!  I had never eaten eggplant before and was looking for a simple recipe.  This fit the bill perfectly.  I took some advice, but I put a little twist on it.  I sprayed my pan w/non-stick spray, then I used Wishbone Italian Vinaigrette Salad Spritzers and sprayed one spray on top of the eggplant.  I then used salt, pepper and italian seasoning (dried), layered w/the tomato, sprayed another spritz w/the dressing and topped w/1 tbsp of part skim mozzarella.  Each piece came out to only 37 calories!!!!  It tasted absolutely amazing.  I will ABSOLUTELY make this again.  Thank you for posting it.

Looked pretty and is healthy enough, but the taste is entirely based on how flavorful the tomato and eggplant is, and of course freshly grated Parmesan cheese only!  Nothing too exciting.

I am a vegetarian and I thought this was the perfect meal! I forced my meat-loving boyfriend to try a bite and he ended up eating three of these! I read some reviews before I made it and saw that some said it lacked flavor so I spread garlic over the eggplant before topping with cheese and the tomato slice. I also sprinkled salt and fresh basil over top and it was amazing!

made some of the changes suggested, adding garlic powder, Italian seasonings etc. and did one more thing.  Having some left over Prego spaghetti sauce, I added that to half my eggplants rounds, and used tomato on the other halves.  Prego won out.  Thought I would share in case anyone is a Prego fan.  Originally was looking to use eggplant without breading due to a gluten allergy.  This was perfect!  Thank you, original contributor.

Super Super Easy!! I peeled the eggplant, glazed with olive oil then put a little cheese on top of the eggplant. Then I put sliced tomato with italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and a little more cheese. Delish! And it only took about 20 min to bake. Oh, I broiled at the end for a couple mins.

I had a small to medium sized eggplant and was looking for ideas.  This was it!  I peeled the eggplant to get the kids to eat it.  I would like to try it with the peel on.  I sprayed the eggplant pieces with a little olive oil and used dried basil and salt and pepper(can't wait to try with a fresh basil leaf).  I topped each eggplant with a bit of parmesan, placed tomato slice on top with a little bit of salt and baked for 15 minutes.  I then put on a thin slice of fresh mozzarella and put under the broiler to toast.  It was fantastic!  At first I told the kids it was potatoes and they loved it! Then they asked what was the green part, so confessed.  A definate addition to the family table.

Wow, very good and healthy I enjoyed this very much. I did not use any oils, I added some spinach and sprinkled a bit of garlic powder betweent the eggplant and tomato. I also added fresh basil on top of the parmesan cheese.  My brother described it as pizza without the bread.

It felt very substantial, but I had to add some basil and used a different kind of cheese to add some flavor. And pepper and olive oil too.

Very good, and so, so simple! My first time making eggplant. Substituted thin slices of mozzarella instead of Parmesan. Delicious and low cal!

As is, I would give it a 3, but I took advice of previous raters and did a bit of basil and mozzerella.  What really made it wonderful was garlic powder -a must.  Took 20 min. in my oven.  Don't even think about using canned powdered parmesean - use fresh, sharp, hard, grated cheese.  I may skip the mozzerela next time because the garlic powder gave it what it truly needed.  Thank you for a great base recipe!

Not so good. I think the eggplant should be breaded or something to add more flavour.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  I sprinkled with a little salt first, then brushed each round with olive oil, one layer of parmesan, tomato, one more layer of parmesan. A definite keeper.

YUMMY!! That's all I can say. Perfect! It wasn't dry at all. I used ff Mozzarella, because I didnt' have Parmesan, and I added a little onion on each "stack". So good! I'll definitely make it again.
Juicy, tender, flavorful.

Soooo boring and the texture is a bit funky! This just has nothing special to bother.  Tomatoes and eggplant together-meh-nothing special.  This recipe needs some spices, or perhaps some sprinkling of Italian breadcrumbs and olive oil.  I would not bother making it again.

This recipe was okay. It defintely needed lots of seasons and extra cheese added too it though.  I am not sure why but for me it turned out very juicy.  This was my first time cooking with eggplant, so perhaps its supposed to be that way.  Anyway, I gave it a four because my husband liked it and he is generally not fond of foods that are different.

ok so I made a lot of changes but this is a great recipe by itself.  I didn't have any parmesan but provelone was wonderful. I layered my eggplant then fresh basil a slice of tomato grind of fresh pepper and then the slice of cheese.  I grilled the whole thing until the cheese was brown and bubbly.  Fantastic!

very delicious!  I did combination of feta, mozzarella, and parmesan cheese.  I rubbed the eggplant with olive oil and sprinkled top with an Italian seasoning.   Tip: if you think eggplant has a bitter taste, then before you cook sprinkle with salt and let sit.  It draws the bitterness to the surface.

This recipe was delicious! I took some of the tips and added basil and garlic salt to each layer. I think it would have been a bit tastier if the eggplant and tomatoes were soaked in the olive oil mix so the entire piece absorbed the flavor. Great recipe, will be doing it again for a side dish or appetizer!

We had leftovers so I cut them up into in bite size pieces and added it to a whole jar of traditional pasta sauce and simmered. The flavors of the the ETB infused into the sauce and came out wonderful!

My husband and I loved this.  Served it with white fish.  Put eggplant and fish on same large cookie sheet and baked together...20 minutes in a 400 degree oven. I also peeled the eggplant and used extra spices and oil. Also, used a sharp swiss cheese in place of the parmesian and added a sprinkling of crushed Ritz crackers on top of the tomatoes.  What an easy way to make dinner.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was good. But like others, I changed it a little. First, I brushed the eggplant with olive oil and broiled it. Then I topped it with the tomatoe and feta with some dried basil and put it under the broiler for an additional minute or two. Yum.

I really enjoyed this dish. It was quite fast (except the peeling took a bit long) and relatively easy. I added some olive oil and some salt free all purpose seasoning onto the eggplant before putting the cheese on and then added a bit more seasoning on top of the tomato. I love how it smells while baking and feel like it's a relatively healthy dish. I made this for my boyfriend last night and he really liked it as well. 
I've made this dish twice now and will add it to my permanent collection of favorite dishes:)

My husband prepared this as a side dish to our cod dinner.  Our eggplant was small, so he didn't bother peeling it.  We ran out of parm early, so he put slices of mozzarella on top of the eggplant rounds, topped with fresh chopped tomato, a little parm, then any herbs and spices that looked interesting.  Super easy, and it tasted really good.

Really yummy! I made a few tweaks. I marinated the tomatoes overnight in balsamic vinaigrette and oregano. I also coated the eggplant with garlic butter and used mozzarella instead. It took about 5 minutes longer to cook but well worth the wait!

This was really delicious. I did however, make a few minor adjustments after reading some reviews & for my own personal preference. I took the skin off of the eggplant and brushed on a little olive oil, sprinkled the eggplant with salt, pepper, and basil. Sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. Top with tomato and seasoned with pepper, salt, and basil and topped with mozzarella cheese. I baked for 25 minutes and served over pasta. It came out wonderful. My husband, mother-in-law, 6 yr. old step daughter, and 18 month old daughter, and I LOVED it! It will absolutely be making it again! Thank you for this excellent recipe :)

Made this today. To get the eggplant a little softer, lightly brush the eggplant with olive oil.Going to peel the skin next time, and cut them thicker. Besides that little tweak, excellent idea. Easy, delicious, and healthy.

Loved this! Very easy. I just added some typical low/no sodium spices (pepper, garlic powder, morton lite salt)and a little spinach leaf on top for color and then placed a fresh slice of garlic on top of that. My eggplant slices were pretty beefy so some spots were still a little chewy...just need to increase the cook time, overall flavor was wonderful!Was a big hit with the hubby and one of two sons (the second son has texture issues, hopefully he will like it when its baked longer) I can't wait to try it again!

So simple and awesome. I sliced the eggplant to 1/4 inch rounds and tomatoes even thinner otherwise followed the recipe and it cooked perfectly at 400 for 15 minutes.  Love healthy recipes like this!

This is a great recipe as is,  and what I like is that you can add to it..I overlap, on a cookie sheet, eggplant, potatoe and tomato..Brush with a little olive oil, and top it off with fresh basil..everyone loves it...

no taste, though I ran out of the cheese it called for, and used a different cheese on hand.   Would have still been missing something.

This was okay, I have never tasted eggplant so I was willing to try something new.  Used the olive oil and added salt and pepper to the eggplant first.  I liked that. I should have peeled, the skin ruined the flavor for me.  Unfortunately I would have had twice as much tomato and cut the eggplant thinner.  My 5 year old wouldn't eat it and my husband just ate the tomatoes off the top.  Nothing against the recipe I think we just are not eggplant people.  Super easy to make though!

This was so easy, quick, and yummy! I followed recommendations from other reviews and brushed the eggplant with olive oil, basil, garlic salt, pepper, and then sprinkle a little mozz cheese as well as parmesan cheese.

Perfectly simple and delicious as is.  I made a variation with some fresh basil leaves and a fat slice of mozzarella. Another, with crab on top of the original recipe.  You can really get crative with this basic idea.

Followed advice another reviewer and brushed with olive oil, and seasoned with salt before adding tomato and cheese. Baked at 400 for 20 minutes...turned out great.

I give this five stars as a healthy food rating! It could of course be more delicious if it wasn't so low calorie but this is a great week night side dish or main meal if only serving two people. I added garlic salt, pepper and fresh basil from our garden. I will definitely make this again when I have fresh eggplant available. Thank you for an easy and low calorie dish!

This is GREAT!  The only reason I gave it four stars was because I made some changes...  I warmed up some olive oil with some chopped garlic in it...then I dipped both sides of the eggplant in the warm garlic olive oil.  Sea Salt and Pepper on both sides.  Then I placed the eggplant on parchment paper and sprinkled the top with dried basil and parm cheese.  I dipped the tomato slices in the oil and then put them on top of each eggplant slice.  Then I Topped THAT with a slice of provolone cheese.  I baked that at 400 for 30 minutes.  It was the first time I have ever cooked with Eggplant, and I was SOOO pleased!This may become a Sunday afternoon staple!  YUMMY!

This appetizer is simply delicious!  I used a grated three cheese blend rather than the Parmesan.  I seasoned the eggplant and Tomato with salt, pepper and Italian seasoning.  I'll definitely make this again!

I thought these were ok. The eggplant was too chewy for my liking. I will make them again with a few changes. I will definitely slice the eggplant very thin and grill or fry covered instead of baking and add some lemon juice and seasoning.

I really liked this recipe and so did my entire family! Next time though I am going to let the eggplant sweat before I bake with it because it seemed a bit too watery, but I will definately make it again.

For a novice chef, who is not accustomed to eggplant the recipe seems bland.  There must be more that can be done to make the eggplant tender.

My husband and I loved this recipe, but I made a couple of changes. I lightly coated the eggplant in olive oil then sprinkled salt, garlic powder, and italian seasoning on it. I then added a slice of tomato, and a square of mozzarella cheese to the top. I baked it for 18 minutes until the cheese bubbled and toped it with grated parmesan cheese once it had been removed from the oven. YUMMY!

This recipe was a BIG hit with the family!  A couple pointers: use Italian eggplant, it's smaller and more tender, but the perfect size to pile vine tomatoes on.  I brushed the eggplant with olive oil per other comments, the eggplant was very tender.  I also put a sprinkle of mozzerella cheese on the top of the parmesean, it was perfect!

This is a simple recipe and turned out just great.  However, I would recommend the changes made by other reviewers.  Don't take this at face value - treat it as something basic to be modified per your personal preferences.  Here at my house, I mixed up some salt & pepper, garlic powder, and dried basil flakes to shake on top halfway through the baking.  It was a great addition.

Made this recipe for a birthday party. While I didn't try it (I don't like tomatoes) they flew off the serving plate so I think they were a pretty big hit.

I got a lot of groans when my family was told they were having eggplant for dinner, but I didn't have any left when dinner was over.  I did play with the recipe a bit, perhaps too much.  I brushed the peeled eggplant with olive oil then salted and peppered.  Then I laid a leaf of fresh basil and topped it with fresh grated parm.  I topped that with the tomato, then put on grated mozzerella and a touch of dried oregano.  My 11 yr old daughter eats next to nothing, yet she ate 3 helpings!

omg..this was so easy and so tasty..i followed other suggestions of using parchment paper and brushing with oil and seasoning with salt & pepper along with oregano.  I was looking for a different way to cook eggplant without using alot of fat and this did the trick.

Great recipe! Simple, easy, healthy, and versatile.   We used a variety of cheeses (each type by itself): swiss, meunster, feta, and aged hard cheese.  Pick your favorite!  We also enjoyed adding sprigs of fresh basil.

I thought this was just ok. We weren't crazy about the eggplant part of it, and we enjoyed the tomatoes on top much better. I'm not sure I would make this again.

This was not a bad recipe overall, but I would definitely add more spices or herbs so it isn't as bland, and would recommend peeling at least some of the skin off eggplant.

I like this recipe as a base but I add a lot to it. I usually put a little salt and pepper over the eggplant, along with some mozzarella and even ricotta (sometimes). I put some of the cheese over the tomato too along with a dash of Italian seasoning. I serve it with sauce over top and a side of pasta. Yummy recipe!

I took other reviewers suggestions and added some seasoning.  I used Morton Nature's Seasoning on the eggplant and the tomato.  This is an easy recipe and it's quite tasty.

It was kind of good. Not something I would make all the time. Definately needed salt. I added Cavender's Greek seasoning which gave it some flavor. I'd probably add more seasonings next time.

This was pretty good. I've made it a several times and have experimented with different cheeses, also with sliced turkey and ham. It is kind of watery but I somewhat fixed that with the sliced ham on top of the eggplant and under the tomato. It is also a little tough with the skin still on, should I peel it first? The cheese I've also are American, Muenster, and Swiss. It is a very quick and easy snack or a light lunch.

This was fantastic and soo easy!  I sprayed olive oil on each slice then added a tomoatoe slice, some italian seasonings and some reduced fat mozz cheese.  It tastes great reheated and on top of some lettuce!  Great South Beach Diet lunch!

Maybe I made this wrong but it was so dry and had a terrible flavor to it.  I feel like the eggplant needs something else besides just tomato and cheese to make it taste better.  Definetly won't make again.

It's cheap, it's easy, it's nutritious.  The taste is not great, but I think it just needs some spices and it'll be good.  Unlike most reviewers, I prefer it if my eggplant is NOT moist, so I sliced it and sprinkled it with salt earlier in the day so it'd dry out a little bit.  The tomatoes and cheese provided plenty of moisture without adding any to the eggplant.
I sprinkled the eggplant with onion salt, black pepper, and some parsley before adding the tomato and cheese and I liked this a lot better on my 2nd try.

Loved this! Surprisingly my husband did too. We added parmesan cheese in-between the tomato and eggplant and then again on top. We cooked them for 20 minutes instead of 15 and then added mozzarella cheese to top! Yum!

I made it tonight for a snack and we loved it. I made some changes to it. I sliced it in rather thin slices coated both sides with evoo, then seasoned with garlic salt, lightly coated with panko bread crumbs and parmesan, added sliced tomato, then covered with asiago and English country cheddar cheese mixed with parmesan. I baked it approx. 20 minutes and it came out delicious. I would make more changes next time by adding marinara sauce, basil, which I forgot to add, and thicker slices of tomato. I never peel eggplant but I will for this recipe, it was difficult to slice after it was baked. Easy to make and plan to do again as we are big on eggplant!

Different but bland. I brushed the slices with olive oil, sprinkled onion salt on both sides and dipped both sides in an Italian herb mixer and all my taste buds felt was, "meh". A healthy snack when I'm by myself, similar to apples and peanut butter but I wouldn't serve it to anyone else.

This was delicious, simple and low fat. If you can use a little protein, I made candied walnuts (which are so simple to make) and sprinkled them on top.   AMAZING!!!! It gives a little more flavor. I will be making this again next week!!!!

I have made this with the eggplant skin on and off and we enjoyed it both ways.  I also brushed with olive oil and added seasonings.  I love eggplant and enjoyed it my brother and husband who are a bit more picky enjoyed it as well.  I did slice the eggplant thinner as well probably about 1/4"

I've made this multiple times. BF loves it. I salt the eggplant slices for 20-30 minutes to bring out the moisture and improve the cooked texture. Sometimes I add basil pesto between the tomato and cheese.

I followed the suggestions of another review which added an additional layer of cheese & fresh basil. I also seasoned with a bit of garlic salt. I cooked it at 400 for 25 minutes. Great flavor. I will definitely have this again.

Don't underestimate this simple little recipe. It's delicious!  Cover the entire pan with parmesan, and you'll get crunchy rich baked cheese "skirts" that you can fold over on top of the towers... so yummy!  Goes great along side some pasta with marinara sauce.  And, if you have a garden overflowing with eggplant and zucchini like I do, this is an easy awesome way to make use of God's blessings :)

There is no way to go wrong with this. We like eggplant very tender. I baked it at 375 for about 45 minutes and then added pesto to some slices and marinara to others and topped with sliced roma tomato and a bit of mozarella and baked a bit longer. YUM!! Also some I dipped in egg wash and then panko and it was absolutely WONDERFUL! It is also good topped with spinach or basil or anything like a little pizza!

So the recipe can be kept just as it is or played with cause it is so very very fun! And so much better than a soggy mess that my eggplant often comes out when I fry it and salt it and make it weep. This texture is perfect. I just need a bushel of eggplants now!

Great base recipe.  I was always afraid to cook with eggplant because of the "salting" and moisture issues you read about, but I've made two variations of this in the last two weeks.  This second time I cut it, put a little spoonful of no salt added tomato sauce on top, seasonings, put a slice of tomato on that, and then a slice of skim mozzarella on each round (half the eggplant is about 6 rounds, so I get 4 meals of out one eggplant and two tomatoes).  I have also tried putting a little olive oil on each round and dusting it with bread crumbs, but without is MUCH better.  The breadcrumbs just get soggy in the microwave. Thanks for posting this.  It was so easy; I wish I had found it a long time ago!

I saw this and immediately knew I would use it. I had a lot of eggplant around, so I was already making some baba ganouj. I spread some of that on each piece. I also used asiago cheese instead of parmesan for a stronger flavor. My eggplant was oddly shaped, so some of the slices were much larger than my tomatoes. I used another half slice one those pieces to cover the difference. The result was very tasty!

Good flavor, bad texture. I followed the steps exactly and my eggplant was *so* soggy. I did add some seasonings and a little mozzarella on top, so the flavor was nice, but the eggplant was just mush. Thanks for sharing with us! :)

I really enjoyed this recipe. I did brush on a little olive oil with some spices and it turned out delicious. This might be my new favorite way to cook eggplant.

This is a great option if you're trying to drop a few pounds... or even if you're not! Anyway, I put salt, pepper and dried basil on the eggplant. Then placed the tomato on top and put the same seasonings on it with a light sprinkling of light mozzarella cheese. Two of these and some steamed shrimp made for a satisfying diet meal.

This is a great starter recipe.  I made mine with eggplant and tomato (of course) and I used olive oil, sea salt, pepper, and oregano.  For the cheese, I used parmesan.  They came out great, but I think next time, I'm going to omit the salt (because the cheese is salty enough for my taste) and include one layer of mozzarella.  So easy and yummy, even reheated!!!

This was so easy and is now my favorite eggplant recipe.  I used pesto instead of plain olive oil and rubbed it over the eggplant and tomato slices before layering.  I was impressed how well the two fruits complement each other.  This will be an essential recipe in my house from now on.

YUMMY! This recipe is easy to do. I read some of the other comments, and I was very thankful for the tips. I used garlic powder on the eggplant layer, and then a little bit of oregano on top of the tomato layer. Served it with whole wheat penne pasta. Good dish when you personalize it.

This was very tasty.  I took another reviewer's advise and seasoned the eggplant with basil, salt, pepper and garlic powder and then layered the tomato on  the eggplant and added the cheese.  This got mushier than I would like but was super tasty. Will probably make again.

Delicious and insanely quick and simple to put together. I used thin slices of extra sharp white cheddar because it was the only cheese I had on hand and topped each with a leaf of fresh basil.

I liked this but IMO there is something missing.  I did add fresh grated Romano cheese and lots of herbs and garlic.  Still something not perfect about it yet.  I will definately make again because the potential is there for this to be a FABULOUS ( and low fat ) meal.  Thanks for the post!!

A+ recipe! Had way too many tomatoes from my garden and needed ways to use them up.  This was a great recipe.  I used fresh basil from my garden and topped some off with provolone and others with shredded mozzarella cheese.  Super yummy!

Wonderful! You saved my family from having to eat yet another boring dinner tonight when I looked into the fridge and realised, "I have only eggplant and tomatoes... what do I do?!" and the cheese of course I luckily had as well~! Never would've thought of baking them together like this and it is SO SIMPLE and tastes SO GOOD! This will definitely be a regular at the dinner table now! I always love finding recipes that are quick, easy, healthy AND tastes great! Thank you!! ^_^

This was a first for me to try, since I had some eggplant given to us by a neighbor. I followed the exact recipe, and it was just okay. After reading other suggestions, I will try to use olive oil to brush both sides of the eggplant, and use basil as suggested. I may even try to use regular parmesan cheese. But will try again!

Awesome..my first time doing any recipe with eggplant.  I did the same with a light basting of olive oil and topping it all off with basil...yummy!  What an incredibly quick and easy dish to do for yourself or a dinner party.

This recipe didn't turn out at all and I'm not sure what went wrong as I followed the directions.  The eggplant was complete mush.  Yuck.  The tomatoes didn't hold up so well either.  I dumped the whole batch.  Too bad, because I love eggplant and hated to waste it.  :(

This recipe is wonderful and soooo easy. I didn't think that I would like the cooked tomatoes, but it was delicious. I also added some mozzerella cheese and salt. I will be making this often.

This was just OK for me.  I liked the tomatoe, but the eggplant just didn't do it for me. I don't think I'd make it again.  Sorry

I thought the recipe was simple, but it wasn't enough.  I cut the eggplant 1/4 pieces and added salt and pepper.  I think it would have been better with fresh parmesan.  I used grated parmesan cheese and added a little mozerella to the top.  I found that I had to cook it for almost 25 minutes to soften the eggplants.  My husband loved it.  I thought it was okay.

I ended up spraying the eggplant with non-stick canola Oil after it was in the oven for 10 minutes. I sprinkled a seasoning called Vegeta and added some ground black pepper for taste. This turned out so delicious...Mmm I will def. make this again

I brushed the eggplant slices with olive oil and tossed salt and pepper on them as well. I didn't have enough parm so I added slices of provolone on top of some of the tomatoes, and those turned out really yummy. Dusted a little garlic salt over everything once out of the oven. Delicious! And wonderfully simple!

I had ricotta cheese that I wanted to get rid of, so layered that on the eggplant, with the tomato and a drop of pasta sauce. I love it and will make it again.

Very tasty. I slipped some sliced avocado in between the eggplant and tomato to give it a bigger nutritional boost. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was great! I did take the suggestions and brush the eggplant with olive oil. I also sprinkled the eggplant and tomato with basil, salt and pepper. It was delicious and filling. I ate it as a dinner but it would make a great side dish too.

We really liked this. Although I did take other reviewers' suggestions... I added some salt and pepper and sprinkled a little dried basil on top. I also used regular Parmesan instead of fat free. I couldn't imagine it being as tasty without these changes.

I breaded the eggplant first.  Otherwise I followed the directions.  I did add mozz. cheese on top.  However, it still was bland.   I had to cut it up and mix it into my pasta with sauce.  Next time I would use heavy seasoning to give it a taste.

the left overs I layered in a baking dish and put sauce and mozzarella on.   came out great.

Pretty good, a nice mix of flavors.  I added a little dash of seasoned salt and some bread crumbs on the top of the slices of eggplant.  This recipe does NOT make for good leftovers, though.

Take my rating with a grain of salt--it's how I imagine the original recipe.

In my version, I used canned tomatoes with sauce (it's winter!), real parmesan cheese, and real mozarella.

It is easy--simple, even.  However, it was nothing special.  Coat those eggplants in breadcrumbs for some eggplant parmesan, and you'll enjoy it more.  Even without the egg (and added fat).

Nonetheless, it is an easy way to get a couple servings of vegetables and a dose of calcium, although if you're doing it for purely health reasons (not to lose weight), you're best with skim cheese, not nonfat--you'll absorb more vitamins that way.

To enliven this simple dish, I treated it like a pizza: trying different cheeses, basil, etc.  Also, I brushed the eggplant with eggplant so they wouldn't dry out.

Really easy to make and looks very presentable.  Nice with some crusty bread.
