I made this recipe but had to make a few changes.  The mixture was very soup-y after it was all mixed together, so I added and extra 1 cup of flour.  Which seemed to make it perfect.  This corn cake is very light and moist.  I love the slight cinnamon taste it has also. I only used 1 cup of frozen corn kernels also. I didnt like the idea of having whole corn kernels in this, if I make this again I would use creamed corn.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  I'll post the pics tonight!

I'm sure this was supposed to be good,  but apparently I'm no cook... epic fail.  mine turned out more like something out of Goodyear's laboratory with buttered corn on top.   I'll try again someday...

This was absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe exactly without any modifications. This is corn "cake" NOT corn "bread" so it's supposed to be a little soupy. Also, use FRESH corn kernals as the recipe states. Yes, this means I used 4-5 corn long corn ears and shaved the kernals off the cob. If you use canned or frozen corn..may be why turned out soupy or didn't turn out at all. Follow this exactly and it will be perfect. I usually can tell if the recipe will taste good if the batter tastes good and wow, I knew this would be a winner.

I made this recipe several times now and it´s a hit with everyone. Chef´s tip: As the recipe states, use FRESH corn kernels (right off the cob).  If you use canned corn you´ll end up with a soupy mess due to the excess of water in canned and frozen corn. This is not corn Bread, but rather a corn Cake, so expect it to be sweet, kinda like carrot cake.

This recipe reminds me of a sweet corn muffin. I made this with fresh corn from my garden hoping for a yummy cake but it came out the opposite.   I should have known calling for 1 1/2 cups of butter and 8 eggs were a bit much. My cake turned out egg/custard type on the bottom and a buttery corn type topping, which I know it shouldn't have been.  I am a pretty darn good baker and this recipe just didn't meet my expectations.

Not at all what I expected came out more like a custard, than a cake!
