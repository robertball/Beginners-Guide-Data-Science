I changed this a bit, which is why its only 4 stars, but my alterations were PERFECT!  I used 2 cups flour.  1/3 c white sugar, 1/3 c brown sugar, 1/3 cup applesauce. 1 1/4 cup banana. And 1/4 c butter instead of oil. Loved this! I made 2 mini loaves w/ chocolate chips and 2 without, and it was just SO YUMMY! So pleased it turned out good, because I needed an amazing fix of something peanut buttery & banana, and chocolate. This did it!

This  is so good!  None of the ingredients overpower the other.  Perfect taste of bananas, perfect amount of peanut butter.  Just like the sandwich!  Yum.  This came out beautiful. I made no changes and I was able to get two loaves from this recipe. THX

I found this recipe very "floury".  I would take that half cup of flour out and maybe add more 1/4 c sugar(a moisturizer), then bake it for 15 more minutes. I'll try it and let you know!

I changed this up some; I used 1 1/2 cups of bananas, apple juice instead of milk and apple sauce instead of oil.  I made mini loaves for Christmas presents that I plan to freeze.  Great peanut butter taste!  (I'd much rather taste the PB than the banana's!) These turned out very moist and yummy!

as written, 4 stars. My general rule of thumb is 3 dark bananas per loaf; that gives the bread the even amt. of moisture, and taste. doubled the recipe to make 2 loaves, and had 1 small mini loaf. mini loaf took 35 min. in my oven and I didn't have to cover it. definitely use foil to cover the last 15 min. the tops do brown @the 45 min. mark. Used full fat JIF crunchy, and subbed applesauce for oil, and buttermilk for the milk. Makes a tender loaf, moist, and this is much much better the next day. more moist and w/more flavor. would suggest making a day ahead of serving for flavors to meld better. this is a heavy loaf, and a heavy batter; that is a good thing if adding add-ins such as chips or nuts; they won't sink to the bottom and will be more evenly distributed throughout loaf.

Not bad... the flavor was good, but it came out a little bit dry when I made it.

Judging by the reviews, I realized that this recipe was pretty malleable.  I used 1.5 cups of flour and 3/4 cup of peanut flour (instead of peanut butter).  I also replaced the oil with 1/2 cup of applesauce.  Left the remaining ingredients the same and it came out extremely moist and delicious.

I did cut back on the milk by a teaspoon and I added a teaspoon of vanilla and because my bananas were really ripe, I cut back on the sugar by half. Honestly, there wasn't near enough liquid for the flour called for in this recipe. I added two more large bananas and then, it was just right. I had a feeling just looking at the recipe it wouldn't be enough. For me, this was quite a bit more than 12 servings. I made muffins out of this and I got 20 muffins out of one recipe. 18 minutes at 350 degrees was just right for muffins. Good recipe, with some tweaking. If I made these again, I'd cut out a cup of flour. There really was too much.

I am just learning the concept of "from scratch" and was really worried about making any breads. THIS IS EASY!!!! I have made it twice now and will continue to make it anytime i have extra bananas! Makes me feel like I can make anything!

This recipe is so easy. I followed the recipe exact and it turned out just right. I like spreading butter while it is warm for more moisture ( like cornbread) Peanut butter taste shows up after the bite. Yum

Great! Everyone loved it! The only thing is that I had to bake it for about half an hour more, but maybe that's just because my oven is ancient.

Now this stuff is yummy!  I changed the recipe by using 1/2c brown and 1/2c white sugar, subbed butter for the oil and used creamy peanut butter.  I also added probably a teaspoon of vanilla too (I always just dump in vanilla).  Also, I thought that sugar was considered a "wet" ingredient, so I did not mix it with the dry, and combined the wet and dry by hand.  Also, I had a few milk chocolate chips that I threw in, maybe 1/2 to 3/4 cup.  I got two loaves out of this as my bread rose more than I had expected.  This was so good fresh from the oven with a little butter.  This is my go to for brown bananas from here on out.

I followed this recipe exactly but I baked as a batch of 12 muffins at 350 for 24 min. and they came out perfect.  Great taste and good moist texture!  I wouldnt change a thing.

It was dry, but tasted good! After it cooled off,  I warmed some up with butter, and added a little bit of grape jelly, yummie!
