Good recipe, but I found pre-boiling the peels to be unnecessary. I sliced the kumquats horizontally in about 1/4" slices. The middles were easy to "punch" out with a finger. I boiled the peels in the sugar solution about 15 minutes because I lost track of time. I strained the peels, saving the syrup to sweeten tea, and placed the peels on a mesh drying rack so air could get to both top and bottom. When the peels were almost totally dry, but still a little tacky, I shook them in granulated sugar. A great, fun snack.
