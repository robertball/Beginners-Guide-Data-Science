To be honest, I didn't like this the day I made it.  It tasted nothing like pizza and the flavors didn't seem to mesh.  But the next day and the day after that, it was AWESOME.  I wanted to eat it for every meal!  I used frozen chicken burgers as the base to make "personal meatza" and topped with store-bought pizza sauce and our favorite pizza toppings.  Add a dash of oregano to really bring out the flavors.  I will be making this again!

This is an excellent alternative to pizza while on South Beach phase one.  I add tons of veggies and use sugar free pizza sauce.  We all enjoy this -- it kills the pizza craving until we are able to have some whole wheat dough!!

I always try to follow the recipe pretty closely when I first make something and then tweak to perfection as I go.  I really like the way that this came out EXCEPT for one exception.  It was really salty. The recipe calls for 1 T of salt plus garlic salt and I will never make it that way again.  I think I will just use garlic powder and not add salt at all.  The pepperoni and tomato sauce have enough salt to go around.  Other than that I thought it was very tasty.  As someone that is new to the Low Carb/High Fat lifestyle this is definitely an enjoyable substitute to regular pizza!

Really good.... Added fresh veggies instead of pepperoni, baked it 5 more minutes then finished under the broiler. I even topped with some fresh greens when serving!

I loved this! I'm doing a gluten free low carb diet and this was perfect. I did make variations. I used organic tomato sauce and added Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder and Parmesan cheese to make my own low-carb sauce. I had some pork sausage so I added that to the beef. I added Italian seasoning and didn't use caraway seeds. I added green and black olives, fresh mushrooms, pepperoni, and a Mexican blend cheese. YUM will make this a lot as I love pizza and this is better than a flour crust to me!

I cut all of the seasonings in half, added 1/2 tblsp ground flax seed. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I also didn't add the salt. it turned out pretty good. I wish I would of made the hamburger bottom really thin because while cooking it shrank and got twice as thick as it started. I used premium grass fed ground beef, there wasn't much grease it just grew. I have to say 2 days later it did taste alot better than when I made it.

Really liked this recipe- will make it again! A few tips though. I'd use less salt than the recipe calls for (you can always salt to taste when served). I used 90/10 beef and turkey pepperoni which worked great! I used vodka cream sauce and low fat mozzarella which both tasted awesome as well. Also, add diced onions, peppers, and olives when broiling for a great crunch.

This was SUPER easy to make.  The TABLESPOON of SALT is WAY to much.  Next time I will use a teaspoon.  Though we are not gluten free it tasted like pizza!  I think a side of garlic bread would have made it perfect.  Yummy!  My family enjoyed it and I will make it again.

Used fresh garlic instead of powdered. Made the meat mix before work and the flavored blended well.  A hit!

Excellent as written... Other than the amount of salt. I cut that in half. Kids loved it so much they BEG for me to make this. After 4 times I have changed to sugar free pizza sauce vs just tomato sauce and we have found we love the uncured pepperoni, sliced olives, and mushrooms, plus extra red pepper flakes on top.

Delicious! 
- In place of the ground beef and spices mixture, I used 1 lb ground beef, 1/2 lb regular (mild breakfast) sausage, and 1/2 lb hot sausage mixed with the eggs and 1 tsp garlic powder.

- For the topping, I used a pre-shredded bag of mozzarella and provolone, jarred homestyle pizza sauce, pepperoni, red onion, and mushrooms.

- Because I made this on a hot  summer day, I made personal-sized pizzas in the toaster oven, one at a time.

I only used 1 tsp sea salt, used all organic veggies, onion, olives, tomatoes, green bell pepper, grass fed beef only used 1 1/3  lb,  all organic cheese, and uncured organic pepperoni, i found the seasonings that were used to be an awesome contrast, those carraway seeds tasted absolutely fantastic with this pizza, we are not on low carb diet, but we are on gluten free diet, this is an awesome pizza! And so easy to put together!

My family really enjoyed this. Made two slight changes. I used less salt and used store bought spaghetti sauce. My kids ate it over pasta and my husband ate it on toasted garlic French bread. I can't eat gluten and enjoyed this as is.

Really good. used ground beef and italian sausage, no fennel, no salt. Seasoned meat and top with italian seasonings, oreagano, garlic and onion powder (not salt). I'm  a big salt lover, but this combo didnt need it at all.

Tastes great! Makes several meals for a single person. Love it fresh-made and as a re-heated leftover. Substituted the pepperoni for sausage. That was great too!

So fantastic!  Hubby and I are watching carbs and this was a huge hit!  I used marinara sauce because it was on hand, and left rest of recipe as-is. What a great idea to get ‘pizza’ back in our diet. Thank you!!!

My whole family loved this. I did make some changes. I used half ground beef and half italian sausage for the base and made my own pizza sauce. I also added mushrooms and olives and sauteed onion to the top with the pepperoni.  It was very good. I did notice the crust bottom shrank and got very thick. Next time I made it, I used less of both meats and made it thinner. Still shrank, but it was a better ratio of everything to the base.

I added olives, onion and bacon.  It was okay I guess.  Next time I plan on using half the ground beef it calls for.  It was just too much.  The flavor was too ground beefy tasting.

I made this! 
I did change a few things as I didnt have some of the items. Mainly the pan, i had a cast iron round pan that i used vs a flat pizza pan. 
i used ground chicken instead as well. I mentioned to my family we can change some of the toppings to match a more local favorite, like a magarita, i think that if you are trying to do it healthy using the ground chicken might be better for you. 
other then that, it tasted like a normal pizza would. minus the crust. the "crust" still tasted like a pizza crust it just now lacks the dough. 
try it once, and see what you think you can change. 
i see a BBQ version coming, a veggies, a meatlovers(ha!) and just cheese. 
enjoy!

Came out great!  Quite a bit salty for our taste so will reduce the teaspoon of salt down to a third.

Absolutely 100% a keeper and perfect for SBD P1 day 1.  I did cut the salt in half and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Family loved it.  Ground chicken or turkey could also be used for the "crust."  Can't wait to make it again!

This is a great dish and you can do a lot with it to make it your own. My family loves this one and it's carb friendly!

Like others, I left out the tablespoon of salt and exchanged garlic powder for the garlic salt.  I also cut the recipe in half.  My husband said it was tasty.  He's looking forward to the leftovers.

My son made this for us last night and it was amazing! To be honest, I didn't miss the crust! We went with garlic powder instead of garlic salt and fennel seed because we didn't have caraway. Great easy recipe for gluten free households or those just trying to cut down on bread. Thank you Adpa!

very good, I followed the recipe except for a few things: I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I'm pretty sure the meat is not cooked thru in 15 minutes, so check carefully, but otherwise great recipe...tasted amazing!

We loved this.  Used a pizza sauce in place of tomato sauce.  Added onions, mushrooms and olives.  Added some oregano on top of the cheese. Used Italian blend shredded cheese in place of the Parmesan & Mozzarella. It was just my husband and me so it was 3 meals with a Caesar salad.  Made it on the weekend and ate it one day and 3 days later - froze 2 servings for later.  Tasted best on day 3!

Very good and super filling.   I may end up using a bit more tomato sauce and some other toppings on the next one.  You also can't beat this one for super quick and very few dishes used (my son loves that part since dishes are his chore)

Very spicy.  Hamburger "crust" was dense.  Some way to make the crust lighter and crunchier would be appreciated.

First time made as written but eliminated the salt, added more vegetables and used 1/2 beef and 1/2 Italian sausage.  was fantastic.  Second time, I forgot about too much salt and my wife would not eat it.

This was super yummy and extra easy to make! When i was baking the beef  I cooked it for  10 minutes on one side and 5 on the other! It made a flatter surface and was able to get A LOT more grease out of it!

Ok I tweaked the recipe. I used 1 lb lean hamburger and 1 lb Italian sausage. 1 tsp salt. Next time I’ll only use 1/2 tsp. All other spices in recipe I used but I also used 1 tsp Chicago pizza piazza (which may be why is was a bit salty). My pizza preference is red onion and green pepper so I also topped it with that. Used only 8oz of cheese which was plenty. Spread in a 9x13 inch pan and the meat was still very thick. I baked at 425 for 15 after adding meat, veggies and cheese, then turned the broiler on high for just a few minutes to lightly brown the cheese. Didn’t miss the crust at all. Will make again! I may try as a taco also and add taco seasoning instead of Italian. Cut the salt to 1/2 tsp the 2nd go around and still was very salty for some reason. Maybe the Italian sausage, or the pepperoni.  I use garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Tried baking all at once and would not recommend that. Too much floating grease. Also tried it with just 1 lb of Italian sausage and no hamburger in a 9x13 pan and it was too thin so will go back to the 2 lb mixture.

This pizza is a great concept for anyone on a low-carb diet that still wants pizza. This stuff is GOOD. Ill give it 4 stars though because the salt content is absolutely absurd. The recipe calls for Parmigiano (one of the saltiest cheeses), garlic salt, an entire tablespoon of salt, and pepperoni on top of that? No way. Next time I'm gonna drop the tablespoon of salt entirely.

Loved it!  A great quick weeknight meal.  I only had 1 lb of ground beef, so cut all ingredients in half - it was perfect.  Definitely a keeper!

I made this exactly except I lowered the amount of salt because  of personal preference. It was really good but next time I think I will use less hamburger and make a thinner crust - again, just personal preference.  :)

It was extremely too salty for my taste. I may not do this recipe again. Hubs and I didn’t like the hamburger meat for crust.

I definitely cut back on the salt, I cannot handle that much. I piled on mushrooms, peppers, onions, olives and fresh tomato slices. I used roasted garlic, and  hot pepper flakes . No pepperoni as I really felt it was meaty enough. It was good and very filling. . For those of us with gluten  sensitivities and watching the carbs it  is great.  Add the spices and herbs you like. Thanks Adpa, this  is  going in my recipe collection.

Love this idea, this was great for my baby who loves to only eat the pizza toppings. My second try i made it with sausage and hamburger combo (which i accidentally made too spicy for the kids--oops) but it was a hit with some feta and spinach! I avoid a lot of carbs this way... LOVE THIS IDEA!  I might even turn it into a tacos without the shell recipe!

This reminds me of a Pizza Burger in a pan.  I really do recommend using the size baking sheet that it noted in the recipe, because I used a slightly smaller one.   Because ground beef shrinks from the fat cooking out, even though using 90% lean, that means your  meat-crust base will be thicker and smaller, in the smaller baking sheet.  Using the larger baking sheet will stretch out the ground beef mixture to a thinner base and be larger for you to top with the goodies.   

I made ours with turkey pepperoni, chopped green/orange peppers, onion and canned mushrooms.     

Nice idea for company to make a few burgers for buns at one time in the oven, then cut in squares.  should make at least 6-8 burgers.

Thanks for posting.

I only rated it 4 as written but it was a 5 once I switched out the tomato sauce for pizza sauce and added some of our fav pizza toppings and a little bit more of Italian seasoning. I also used pizza mozzarella cheese which made it even more like a pizza. Very filling and so DELICIOUS!Thanks to the reviewer who suggested making the day before serving to let the flavors blend.

Papa John's sausage pizza... that is the first thing that came to mind when I first tried this. My suggestion is to add a little bit a franks red hot to your piece before taking a bite. I think the hot sauce really made it taste like a sausage pizza from papa johns. My husband doesn't like hot sauce but he is happy with his piece just the way it is. I'm making this again as I type this.

My 18 year old son has been on a Low Carb diet and I have been trying to find recipes for him, but also want meals that my husband and I will also like.  We really liked this recipe. After reading the reviews I cut down the salt content, used all other spices called for in recipe and also sprinkled some basil on the meat before going in the oven. I did choose to use the caraway seeds and I thought that it really added a very nice balance of flavor.  I wasn't sure I would like them, but I did. My family and I enjoyed this recipe very much.

OK, but tasted like a hamburger with toppings.
