I made this for our Allrecipes Allstars Canada challenge for Lunar New Year. I did make some changes, just because I have a new Instant PotÂ®, so I added the chicken, the 1/4 cup water and the coconut juice directly to the pot and pressure cooked for 11 minutes. I followed the recipe for everything else. It was good, very moist, maybe needed a little something but I don't know what. PS - the ingredient list calls for green onions "with white and green parts separated", Step 1 says to "spread ginger slices and green parts of the green onion on top", then Step 3 says "add green parts of the green onion" to the sauce. Should Step 1 call for the white part of the onion instead of the green part? Otherwise I don't know where the white part would come into play. That's what I did.
