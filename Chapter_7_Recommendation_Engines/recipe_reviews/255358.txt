My Brazilian boyfriend said that this recipe was perfect and ate almost the entire thing himself. It is pretty moist--so I'm not sure what the reviewer who said it was very dry did to it--and not an airy cake. I thought it was better the second day. It didn't last any longer, so I don't know how long it's good for :)

I saw this recipe in the Magazine and I just had to try it! This cake was awesome! I didn't have enough time to make the chocolate frosting, and I put white whipped frosting on instead. The cake came out moist and had a really good flavor. I had to bake it more than 40 minutes (probably because I'm in Houston) and it took about closer to 50 minutes to cook. I took the cake to work and everyone loved it! I will definitely make this again.

I like my cakes light and fluffy, with some whole grains and not overly sweet, so this is what I did-
I used 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour and 1.25 cups white pastry flour. 
I separated the eggs and blended the yolks with the rest of the batter and separated the whites, whipped them separately to stiff peaks before folding them into the rest of the batter as a last step before putting in pan.
I cut sugar to 1.5 cups- used 0.5 of that to whip with the egg whites.
I added 2 tsp vanilla bean extract
I topped it with a scant layer of turbinado sugar before baking and skipped the frosting. 

Result was a very moist, light and tender cake that was not overly sweet and had lots of carrot flavor shine through.  The crunch on top was a delight. 

My family devoured it warm with coffee or milk (for the kids). My 2 year old could not get enough! Thank you for the base recipe. Loved the end product with tweaks.

I've made this cake several times, including for my son's 1st birthday cake. It's ridiculously easy and so delicious. I'm not sure why some reviewers comment that the cake is too dry. It has never come out dry for me. The chocolate icing is optional but a yummy addition. Like another reviewer I have also experimented with reducing the sugar amount. Reducing it by half is a little too much, so don't go that far. But reducing by 1/4 or 1/3 is fine. But even made as stated it isn't too sweet. A lovely cake I'll make again and again.

Easy recipe to follow and overall looked great. Taste-wise, it was a little dry, but everyone who tried it enjoyed it! Especially great accompanying tea or coffee. I think next time I will try adding grated carrots into the mix (to see if it helps make it moister) and use milk chocolate instead of bittersweet for the frosting.

The recipe that was sent to me had the recipe in grams so I weighed everything and it called for caster sugar. This was a delicious moist cake.  I don't own a jar blender so I used my stick blender. The carrots were undetectable in the finished product. Can't wait to try it with the chocolate frosting.

Saw this featured  in an issue of the allRecipes magazine.  I Needed a non-dairy dessert with a healthy halo and this fit the bill.  I reduced the sugar by 1/3 and improvised on the frosting to make it non-dairy.  I melted some non-dairy semisweet  chocolate chips and some cocoa butter (2:1 ratio about 3/4 cup altogether after melting)  in the microwave  and mixed in some honey (about 2 tablespoons) and a bit of corn oil (roughly 2 teaspoons) into it until it was spreadable.  I'm sure the frosting listed  in the recipe is better, but this cake is so good with any chocolate frosting.   Will make again.

The cake is very moist and not too sweet.  My family enjoyed it!  If you like a lot of icing then double the icing recipe.  What the recipe calls for is a very thin layer on a 9x13 cake.

I made it for a Brazillian friend who had family visiting. They enjoyed it very much but said I should double the chocolate frosting! I loved using the blender instead of a stand mixer. Can chop the carrots in the blender first!  Great recipe!
