THANK YOU so much for this wonderful recipe! I made this for a party of 12. I was in awe of how it turned out-fab presentation!!  I felt like I created a tavern on the green original. One note-do be very careful and WATCH the internal temp closely!! Remove from oven when it's 140 for medium-which was my goal. The temp will go up (for me it went 8 degrees more) while the tenderloin "rests" 10-15min prior to slicing and serving. It came out PERFECT-so juicy and flavorful!! I did put the garlic- in small chunks from the marinade on top of the tenderloin prior to putting it in the oven. Everyone raved! This is my new fav guest/dinner party menu item .....the only downside is the price of beef tenderloin ($13.99/lb) or we'd have this more often and not just special occasions. The cheese sauce was great-but it gets thick once it cools....I'd suggest to keep it in one of the thermal gravy type servers if you have it avail.

Oh My Stars! I screwed this recipe up and came away with a complete winner that has blown us away!!!!! Hubby and I were preparing our Valentines dinner, we had two strip steaks. I didn't read the recipe correctly. I halved the amounts due to just having two steaks. I did not marinate the meat, we grilled it with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I then put ALL of the ingredients together in a saucepan. The exceptions were that I used FETA cheese and used the garlic out of the jar from the produce section. I used a really good Merlot that we had with our dinner. This gave the mixture a  pink appearance that was PERFECT for Valentines Day! I was worried in the beginning, but it turned out beautiful (candlelight makes us all look better - LOL!) We served this over the steaks, sauteed onions, jumbo cooked shrimp along with a baked potato that I had coated in olive oil and sea salt and then baked at 425 for one hour. We couldn't eat our salads. This needs to be submitted as its own recipe! My husband kept going "mmmmm" during the meal, LOL!  *** 2/14/05 Made this again tonight for my children for Valentines Day. I only added a splash of Teriyaki sauce and 2 splashes of Worc. sauce and hubby and I liked it much better. My son went crazy over this! Delish! Thanks :-) ***Updat - Made this for Christmas Eve 2005. I made it exactly to recipe and it was DELICIOUS! Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!

Delicious! My husband and teen loved it. I made this with a beef rump roast since tenderloin is out of our budget.  I increased the garlic in the marinade to 4 cloves since we are garlic fanatics, used Merlot for the red wine, and increased the marinating time to about 3-4 hours for a less tender cut.  I cooked the rump roast in a shallow pan at 325 for about 1/2 hour per pound for medium rare.  Next time I think I will try a London Broil, and cook it using the tendeloin method described in this recipe.  The sauce is outstanding, a wonderful blend of flavors, and the blue cheese taste isn't overpowering.  We enjoyed the extra sauce on our baked potatoes.  Thanks for a keeper.

I served this to 20 with some modifications.  Everyone loved it.  Try roasting 2 lbs. of thick cut mushrooms with the roast.  I used Shitaki, Cremini, Button....coated in 4 tablespoons melted butter and 2 teaspoons minced garlic.  This makes an excellent side to serve along with the blue cheese sauce.

I chose this recipe because it used a sauce, instead of rolling a layer of blue cheese inside of the tenderloin.  It was a great choice.  Not only was the sauce delicious (both on the beef but on baked potatoes), but it gave those who didn't like blue cheese a way to enjoy the flavorful meat.  Even those who claimed to not like blue cheese approved of the smooth-tasting sauce.  My only changes were, as others suggested, to increase the garlic to three cloves and to marinate it for a longer time.  Great recipe!

I made this for my father's 60th birthday dinner and got rave reviews. We all love beef and blue cheese, so the combination was perfect! I had a 6 lb tenderloin. I baked it without stringing it, as I wanted some parts more well done than the middle, as we had a pregnant woman and at least one person who liked their meat well done. That worked out perfectly! I served fresh roasted aparagus and roasted garlic mashed potatoes with it.

I am always looking for new ways to prepare beef tenderloiin. The sauce was incredible and I have also used it on grilled ribeyes. The second time I made the sauce, it was a bit salty but that was due to the brand of blue cheese. I always serve the sauce on the side. Tremendous flavor.

The meat was a little more well done than our family likes. Those non-blue cheese lovers thought the sauce was too strong.

I just didn't like this sauce.  I love blue cheese but this sauce was not good and I ended up throwing the whole thing out.  What a waste.

This tenderloin was fabulous. I made the blue cheese an option - most of the guests thought the beef was so juicy and flavorful with the red wine and teriyaki they chose not to even add the blue cheese (but it was quite tasty) it.   This will definitely be made again and has now been passed on.

Really nice sauce! Very smooth and creamy and not too overpowering. Even teenage daughter, who doesn't like blue cheese, loved the sauce. Marinated the tenderloin for several hours then seared on the grill and finished off in the oven.  The marinade imparted great flavor to the meat.  Only alteration to the recipe was adding 4 cloves of garlic to the marinade and chopped chives and fresh cracked pepper to the sauce. Will make many more times, thanks for the recipe!

This was really good!  I live in Mexico where the beef is not aged.  The beef tenderloin has very little flavor here so I marinated this for 8 hrs and then sliced it in about 3/4 in slices- put it back in the marinade while I put a little olive oil in a pan and heated the pan to 250 (electric skillet) then seared the beef slices for about 2 min on each side- then served it with the blue cheese sauce.  The meat was fantastic and very tender with a great flavor even without the sauce.  I will be trying the marinade on other cuts of beef also. Muy Bueno!  I have made this numerous times and I now use the leftover marinade by first sauteeing 1# of sliced mushrooms in a little butter until almost done- then add the marinade-(reserve 1/2 c.) and let it come to a boil- then add some flour to a jar with remaining 1/2 c. marinade-shake it up and add to the mushrooms-simmer until thickened.  Pour the mushroom gravy over the cooked filets.
Delicioso!

This was outstanding! I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. I did as others suggested and put this in a shallow baking dish with the sauce. I used roasted garlic teriyaki sauce which worked well. The sauce was very good but we love blue cheese so we added more to it. Will definitely make this again.

We didn't use the blue cheese dressing as we found it unnecessary.  The beef was melt-in-your-mouth fantastic!  I've baked the beef as directed and also grilled it.  I've made it numerous times now and  have found that this marinade works great on chicken breasts also.  Only change was I seasoned with fresh ground pepper while marinading.  Note: my tenderloin was not whole, it came in 1 inch thick slices from the butcher shop.  Flip the slices or chicken breasts at least once during marinading.  Thank you so much for the recipe!  Yummy, yummy, yummy!!!

I love this dish. Instead of cooking it on the broiler pan though, I leave it in the wine/teryaki mix and cook it in a shallow pan. I then use the juices after cooking to make a gravy.

I used this for a couple of rib eye steaks.  I marinated the meat for about six hours.  I thought this was very good...the meat came out so tender and had an excellent flavor.  The sauce was missing something...I think next time I will increase the Worcestershire to 2 teaspoons and see if that will do it.  Overall a good recipe that I will make again.

Absolutely delicious... I prepared it exactly as written with the exception of marinating the meat for almost 24 hours (scheduling issue!). It turned out tender and moist..  and the bleu cheese sauce was wonderful!

I used Beef Medallions that I grilled in place of the tenderloin.  I also used Gorgonzola in place of the Blue Cheese (because that is what I had on hand) and the entree was delicious!  Our guests asked for the recipe.  The SAUCE is a KEEPER!

This was just OK for me. I had this a couple of years ago... my sister made it for Christmas Eve dinner. I cooked mine the SAME way, but, for some reason, I just wasn't as happy with the end result (hers tasted WAY better than mine did). I marinated my 3.5 lb. tenderloin (couldn't find a 3 lb. one - all were between 3 and 4 lbs.) in a large roasting pan since that's all I had on hand. My sister used a small Pyrex baking dish to marinate hers. Perhaps this made a difference? My tenderloin started to smoke in the oven (i.e. the the pan juices were burning). Had I used a smaller baking dish, this probably wouldn't have been an issue. My tenderloin was not burned, but it sure gave me a scare (can you imagine ruining Christmas Eve dinner??!!?!?)!!! I had to take my roast out of the oven when it was medium-rare. I do not like any meat cooked less than medium-well (I actually prefer well done), but all of my guests like theirs RARE (I was outnumbered again... sigh). I sure got a good deal on the tenderloin. If you live in the Chicagoland area, go to Caputo's Italian Market. They always have good and affordable cuts of meat (I got my tenderloin for $20; my sister paid double this in St. Louis). Served with blue cheese sauce, potato gratin with chicken broth, garlic and thyme (by Pam Anderson), steamed asparagus and Ghirardelli individual molten chocolate cakes for dessert. Thanks for sharing!

WE tried this about a week ago and used Oregon state blue cheese and a fine Oregon Sirah. Wonderful!
We substituted Elk back strap, which is much better for you and can cut down the expense considerably. It will lower your cholesterol, specifiacally the "BAD" stuff(LDL). For those that don't hunt, this recipe is an arterial clogger. I am a physician and watch that at least 80% of the red meat we ingest is game.

I made these using filet mignon steaks that I marinated for eight hours and put them on the grill.  I topped each steak with the blue cheese sauce and it was wonderful!

Loved it! Wasn't too sure about the blue cheese sauce, but it was excellent! A great addition to a perfectly seasoned tenderloin.

The perfect way to show off a nice piece of tenderloin. This has become my annual meal for my Un-Valentines' Day party with all my single friends.

I chose this recipe, as much as anything, because of the sauce.  It turned out delicious, and absolutely restaurant quality.  My only complaint was that the sauce came out a bit grey or muddy looking.  Tasted fabulous though!

I was so excited when I came across this recipe and saw all the great reviews, so I decided to give it a try. I went and purchased all the items. Yukon gold potatoes to mash and carrot to steam along with the tenderloin. I followed the recipe completely. I am a huge fan on tenderloin and bleu cheese. I think that the teriyaki/wine marinade had a very over whelming flavor once the roast was done to medium. The bleu cheese sauce I hoped to enjoy and save to use for another meal during the week. I found to sauce to not tickle my taste buds and the aroma was so over powering that I couldn't have it sit on my dining room table. I wasn't able to use it.  It was a good experience and perhaps a great recipe for people with tastes other than mine.

Very delicious! Deserves more than 5 stars! Was a bit worried the marinade would taste strange with the teriyaki and was afraid of trying a new recipe on such an expensive cut of meat but it was perfect. Anyone who has said anything bad about the sauce must not like blue cheese, because it was also amazing. Followed the recipe exactly except marinated for a few hours. My husband love it too. Would be very impressive for company.

This was exquisite! We made this for family and it was out of this world! It was so tender and the sauce was a wonderful blue cheese taste. Since we didn't have a broiler pan we put it in a casserole dish when it was done marinating for 4 hours. We broiled it for 7 min then baked it for 30min and it was perfect! We also added some garlic powder to the sauce for just a little kick. I will definitely make this again!

The best tenderloin I have ever prepared.  The sauce was outstanding and very easy.  Reheated well.  One son is putting the left over sauce on everything.  This is a keeper.

Family thoroughly enjoyed the meal. The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars, is because the tenderloin was plenty flavourful without the sauce. If you are preparing this, definitely serve the sauce on the side as blue cheese is an acquired taste anyways. Sauces can be a quick fix to make a bland meal tasty, but if you go to the effort of letting the meat marinade, you really don't need the sauce. It's just a nice accompaniment. Thank you for the recipe though, I will indeed make again.

Superb!! There are few words to express how delicious this dish is.  It is a recipe that I will serve not only on special occasions or to special guests, but to family when tenderloin is on sale. I followed this recipe exactly and it could not have turned out better.  Thanks so much for a wonderful way to prepare Tenderloin.

The Blue Cheese sauce for this recipe is very strong.  A little bit goes a long way.  When we served this, most people avoided the sauce, or if they did have some, they only took a small amount.

Wonderful restaurant-like recipe!  I didn't have beef tenderloin and replaced it with an inch thick, well-done beef sirloin.  Blue cheese on top of beef makes a great, tasty combination!  I added extra blue cheese for good measure; 1 ounce of blue cheese wasn't good enough for me! :-)  A side dish of sour cream and chive potatoes along with a good bottle of red wine add great flavor and ambiance to this great recipe.

Good recipe - I loved it more than my husband.  We had to buy tenderloin steaks and hubby just can't completely enjoy them if they're not cooked on the grill.  Next time, we won't buy the steaks if we can help it.  Great recipe!

I bought 2 tenderloin steaks and used 1/2 the marinade. I baked the steaks at 400 for 9 minutes and then broiled them for about 1 minute a side.
I started the sauce after I took the steaks out to rest. It took about 5 minutes. (Basically it starts out creamy I just heated it up)
This might be the closest thing to perfect I have ever tasted :) It does get scary to throw a marinade on a tenderloin steak! But it was the perfect amount of subtlety.

I'm giving this 3 stars because of the marinade.  30 min. is NOT long enough to impart any flavor.  Next time I'd try marinating about 4 hours.  The flavor of the marinade was virtually nonexistant.  The beef itself was delicious as was the blue cheese sauce.

Made this recipe last night and it was my first attempt at making beef tenderloin. I followed the directions exactly, although I added a bit of parsley to the cheese sauce. As far as the sauce goes, YUM!!! I'm not a huge fan of blue cheese, but am slowly acquiring a taste for it. This sauce was delicious and not overpowering. As for cooking the tenderloins...mine were a bit thick - maybe 2 inches - and although I kept pulling them out every five minutes and taking the temp... I overcooked before even hitting 140. They were medium well :( They were still very tender though, thanks to the cut of meat! I'd say don't put them at 450 for the full 15 minutes if you have a new, efficient oven! I will definitely be making this again though and will just have to tweak the directions as far as cooking the meat goes so it suits my oven better! My tip for you is to cut open a tenderloin after about 20 min at the 375 temp to make sure they are not done already! Served with maple dill carrots, garlic mashed and green beans. Sauce was great on the potatoes!

Just made this for the second time in two weeks. Made exactly as is except I used a London Broil rather then a Tenderloin because I couldn't find them either time! Walmart for you. Excellent. Truly delicious.

Excellent recipe for whole beef tenderloin.  I marinated the beef for a few hours in the refrig.  The beef was tender and flavorful and the blue cheese sauce was delicious.  I kept the saucepan on the lowest simmer and stirred often to melt the cheese and keep it warm.

Only followed the recipe for the blue cheese sauce as for the tenderloin, I like only a little butter, olive oil, salt, and pepper! (I'm a purest with tenderloins! )  The sauce is amazing!!!!  the next night we made sandwiches out of the tenderloin and the sauce was even decent cold or room temperature!  Yummy!!!

so delicious! i was originally looking for a recipe for venison tenderloin but couldn't find much. this worked perfectly. the only thing i would change is i'd probably cook it a little less time. maybe 25 minutes. 30-40 minutes made it close to well done and i like my meat a little pinker than that. otherwise A+!

This was great.  Super easy!  The sauce is delicious, but completely unnecessary which such a great cut of meat.  That wouldn't stop me from making it again.

This is probably the best tasting beef I have ever enjoyed.   I wanted to make something special for my wife's birthday and this was perfect.   I bought the best looking (and probably most expensive) beef tenderloin I could find.   I marinated it for about 4 hours.     I personally am not a big fan of blue cheese but my wife is.    I only applied a thin layer of the sauce to mine and she applied a thicker layer to hers.   She tells me that this is a lighter and less rich version of the sauce compared to what she has had in restaurants.     With a side dish of asparagus and mushrooms and a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon, it made the perfect birthday dinner for her.

This was awesome. The only change I made was instead of 1/2 cup of teriyaki I used 1/4 cup teriyaki and 1/4 cup soy sauce. Also, I marinated mine overnight, a full 24 hours. I didn't the use the blue cheese sauce on my own serving but everybody who did raved!! Thanks for such a great recipe..it's a keeper for sure!!

I made this for Valentine's Day and it turned out perfect!  The marinade wasn't too over powering and the blue cheese sauce was amazing!  I let the blue cheese sauce cook a little longer than I should have and that caused it to separate a little, but that was my fault.  It still tasted great though.  I would recommend this to anyone!

The beef was succulent, the marinade fabulous.  That deserves 5 stars but then the blue cheese sauce was too strong and overpowering destroying the amazing flavors of the meat.  I suggest cutting down on the blue cheese, probably in half and adding maybe 4 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce to compliment the blue cheese.  With these changes this might be a great meal but as of right now I can only give it three stars.

I will make this again for sure.  However, I'm not sure if this is DIVINE.  It is a great recipe for one who is not sure how to prepare a tenderloin roast.   Also, the cook time varies.  You have to use a thermometer, and be aware of actual weight after 'trimming' the loin (if you buy the tenderloin not trimmed).  Still this is a great staple recipe and will impress.

I have made this on 3 different occasions and each time it was a hit.  The first time I made it exactly as written, the last 2 times I added rosemary to the marinade.  I also like to let the meat come to room temp before I put it in the oven.....yummy and a keeper!!!

I have to admit that I just thought this was average. The marinade might have better served a cheaper cut of meat. The sauce thicken quickly after removing from the heat so it wasn't really a sauce. The flavors were fine but with the cost of tenderloin I expected something that didn't mask the quality of the meat. This wasn't horrible.. I won't try this again. Sorry!

This was thoroughly enjoyed by the whole family.  We kept the sauce on the side as not everyone liked it.  I'll be using the leftover beef and sauce to make a dinner salad.

The bleu cheese sauce for this makes it a 5 star! It is so simple and so delicious. A beef tenderloin is an easy meal for a dinner party. The sauce makes it elegant as well. We prefer to grill the tenderloin, but "searing" it with high heat in the oven before slower cooking seals in the tenderness too when baking. So good my HUSBAND requested the recipe to pass on!

This is definitely a "keeper"   I needed more than 30 - 40 minutes to get the meat to an internal temperature of 135-140.  It was medium rare and absolutely delicious after sitting for about 20-25 minutes.

The sauce on this tenderloin was a hit with my dinner guests! The reciped called for 2/3 cup of sour creme; I used a full cup to lessen the intensity of the blue cheese taste.  I would do that again and most certainly use the recipe again!

We really enjoyed this.  I used a 3 lb sirloin tip roast because I didn't want to have to go buy a tenderloin.  I marinated it for about an hour and it worked out great.  Very tender.  My kids don't care for blue cheese so I served their pieces without any sauce..even without the sauce the meat had a very nice flavor from the marinade so it's a recipe that you can easily serve with the sauce "on the side."  Everyone cleaned their plates!  Served with baked potatoes (my husband liked the sauce added on his potato, too) corn and warm buttered bread.  A keeper.

I went with goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes crumbled over the finished tenderloin instead of blue cheese.  I also reduced down (after it was brought to a rolling boil) the remaining marinade and spooned it over the beef.  It was very well liked by everyone in my family.  

The marinade itself is very good and am thinking I'll try it for chicken some time.

Thanks for the recipe!

This was wonderful!!! I cooked it for our Valentines dinner and everyone swooned! My 2 year old who is not much of a beef eater ate more than her big brothers. I did have to cook it a bit longer since we don't care for rare meat but even with a longer roasting time it was tender and delicious. The sauce is all too fabulous, I had to restrain myself from eating it with a spoon!

I made this for our family Christmas and came out wonderfully. My father (the ultimate carnivore guru) thought this was the bomb! To prove how easy this was to make...I am a vegetarian and even I was able to prepare this entree without too much difficulty!!

This was very good. I couldn't find a tenderloin, so I used filet mignon steaks. I had to tweek the cooking so as not to over cook them. The blue cheese sauce is very rich. We loved this dish. I will make this again...for special occasions seeing as how expensive the meat is.

Wow- such an easy gourmet meal!! I used 4 tenderloin steaks & cooked them in my TOASTER OVEN!!! (works great) I should have halved the sauce. Take note- it takes at least 15 minutes for the cheese to melt. (I used Gorgonzola) Also- definitely marinate longer- I did for 2 hours & next time I will try at least 4. Thanks for the great recipe!

The marinade was so delicious, but I just couldn't get into the sauce. I'm a blue cheese fiend, but it was just too bitter and overpowering for me to give it any more stars. Obviously, judging by the overall score, I'm in the minority with my thoughts! :)

I adore this recipe!  The marinade is amazing.  The second time that I made this, I marinaded the meat for about two hours.  I also used and injection baster to baste the meat a few times while cooking it.  The meat was much juicier the second time.

I made this recipe for a dinner party and it was wonderful.  Lot's of reviewers said that they didn't use the marinade recipe (just the blue cheese sauce), but the marinade was EXCELLENT.  I cooked a 6lb. tenderloin roast from Sam's Club and doubled the marinade.  I let it sit in the marinade for 3 hours before roasting.  It was perfect.  I also cut the roast in half to help ensure more even cooking.  Not everyone tried the sauce, but those that did LOVED it.

Like a lot of other reviewers, I didn't make the tenderloin, but I made the sauce.  It was delicious!  I made a London broil using another five-star allrecipes marinade, then sliced the meat thin and arranged it on a bed of mashed potatoes.  Then some of the blue cheese sauce!  Delicious.  I will make this again for company.  One thing I would do differently is NOT serve any other light colored sauce-like condiments at the same meal, such as salad dressing.  Perhaps it is the appearance of the sauce or something, but it just seemed wrong to have just eaten something else that looked the same but tasted so different.  Call me nuts, but that is my suggestion.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!!  I made this recipe last night for Valentine's Day and it was delicious!  Even my boyfriend, who is a chef, said I've outdone myself!!  I did add a little garlic & onion powder to the sauce, although it sure didn't need it!

I had 2 filet mignons in the freezer, so I used them, same marindade, baked as the recipe said instead of grilling...
Took longer in the oven than I guessed for medium rare. 
I sliced at an angle and served w/sauce drizzled on. Both my husband and I loved it.
Served it with a rice dish that had some walnuts in it, a gourmet night, good compliment of flavors!

I had a dinner party with 10 and chose this as the main dish.  A few people stated beforehand they don't like bleu cheese so I told them I would just put it on the side.  I added a little extra garlic to the marinade and let it marinate over night.  The following night I cooked, and I received only extraordinary compliments.  Even those who had said they didn't like bleu cheese were asking for more sauce to put on top.  I definitely reccomend this recipe.

Fantastic recipe!  I added herbs d'provence and some extra garlic to the marinade and increased the time to 1 hour.  The bleu cheese sauce is very nice, and those who don't care for it can simply leave it off if you serve the sauce on the side instead of serving it over the beef.  A tasty and elegant party dish!

I made this using Jack Daniel's Honey Teriyaki marinade (already made from the grocer's).  Everyone loved it.  I would probably add more blue cheese to the sauce the next time I make this, but that's just my preference.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Absolutely delicious! Instead of roasting it, I cooked it on the grill (using a meat probe to ensure it remained rare). The only other change I made was to marinate the tenderloin for about 1.5 hours, turning it frequently.
The blue cheese sauce was excellent -- not too piquant as to overpower the meat but not too subtle either.... just right. This has become my "go-to" blue cheese sauce for any type of meat or poultry although I still prefer a stronger one for grilled vegetables.

Unbe"beef"able - super delicious! I took a risk and made this for a dinner party without trying it out first. The results were fantastic - it also helped that the hubby cooked it a perfect medium rare. The sauce was a fabulous complement to the tenderloin. Love - Love - Love - yum- yum -yum.

Had this for easter and was a hit. Didn't have teriyaki sauce so substituted soy with some sugar (googled substitue for teriyaki) and it was still wonderful.
Will make this again.

I only used the sauce recipe.  I added 1 Tbsp of horseradish to the sauce.  Excellent.  Spread the sauce mixture on Kaiser rolls with very thin slices of left over tenderloin for sandwiches.  AWESOME.

I've been wanting to try this for a long time and it was worth the wait! Mine turned out a little more done than I intended, but it was soft, tender, and very flavorful! Thanks for sharing!

I used a different cut of meat..but the results were incredible. I don't even like beef, just made it for my boyfriend. Not only is the marinade fabulous...that sauce is incredible! I woke up and ate it for breakfast too! I used a large sirloin and broiled it the same way. I imagine that any somewhat fatty cut of meat would be great.

Excellent recipe.  Note, it's cheaper to buy tenderloin as a whole, rather than filets anyway.  Also, make sure you buy quality blue cheese as it does make the sauce.  I followed the recipe and it was fabulous.  I did change the cooking method slightly.  I put the tenderloin in the pre-heated oven at 450 degrees for 15 minutes.  I then had my hubby grill to an internal temperature of 120 degrees.  Wonderful!  Will definitely make again.

Didn't use the marinade recipe because I ran out of time. Just let the tenderloin come to room temp, sprinkled generously with Canadian Steak Seasoning and pan roasted until med-rare. Made this sauce with reduced fat mayo and lite sour cream and used about 2 tsp of worcestershire. Sliced the tenderloin very thin, placed on thin slices of baquette and topped with this sauce. Can't wait to make this again!!! Absolutely wonderful!!!

Melt in your mouth delicious.  We used a 6 lb. tenderloin and didn't have to double the blue cheese mixture but we doubled the marinade.  Marinated it for 8 hours or so.  I was definitely a keeper but it's really expensive!  Thanks!!!

This deserves 10 Stars!.  Made this for Christmas.  Used a 7lb tenderloin. Made just as directed and wouldn't change a thing.  My mother in law went on and on how good it was. It was so easy too and the blue cheese sauce really topped it off just right. A DEFINATE KEEPER.  Can't wait to make again.

This is a really great recipe.  I have used this twice on New Years.  DELICIOUS both times. I always put the sauce on the side.  The tenderloin is expensive, but if you're only cooking for a small amount of people (2-4) for a special occasion, it's ok. I have always served with garlic slow cooker mashed potatoes from this site and sauteed asparagus. When I have leftovers the next day, I toast some roasted garlic bread  (from Costco) and use the sauce cold as a spread.  I slice the cold tenderloin really thin and it made an AWESOME sandwich.  This is one of my favorite recipes.  You know you have a good one when the leftovers are just as delicious, if not better the next day.  Thanks.

Really don't see what all the hype is about- Just okay...Cooking time & temp was to high and to long if not watched would have been a total bust! plus the bleu cheese sauce needed something... maybe a little lemon?!? won't make again

We made this for Christmas Eve dinner.  Everyone really liked it.  The blue cheese sauce was tasty, but we only made half of what the recipe called for as it was just poured decoratively on top and not on the side.  Fantastic, but expensive.

I did not make the sauce but used this recipe for baking the tenderloin. It was the best I have ever had. Starting in a hot oven and then turning it down makes all the difference. Can't wait to try the sauce next time

Can I just say delish?!  I am a blue cheese fanatic, so this hit a big home run with me!  Serve with a nice big leafy salad, with a thin blue cheese dressing, or just oil an vinegar.  Makes great left-overs too!

I was looking for a special recipe to make when some old friends were coming into town. Now, the meat was expensive but if you are looking for a recipe to use with expensive meat, this is it. It was absolutely fabulous. Better than going out on the town to a 4 star place. Just great!

I did not make this with tenderloin (too expensive). My mother prepared a roast for Christmas dinner and I made this separately to go with. Oddly enough, I don't really like blue cheese but when I saw this recipe I really wanted to try it. I'm glad I did because it complimented the beef so well. This could not be any easier to prepare and cooking it over the stove really mellowed the blue cheese flavor. Since I didn't marinate the roast I just added a sprinkle of garlic powder, a dash of teriyaki, and a dash of port wine (very small dashes I might add). I would definitely make this again because again, it goes really well with the beef. But, make sure you serve it on the side!!!

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner last year and everyone LOVED it.  I used Gargonzola and my family who doesn't care for blue cheese raved over the sauce.  I am definitely not the best at cooking meat, but this was impressive.  I used a digital meat thermometer, so achieved the perfect temperature.  This has been requested for Christmas Eve dinner again this year.

Love this recipe as an appetizer.  Cut tenderloin into pieces, marinade, and then bake for 20+ minutes.  I buy untrimmed, "bulk" tenderloin, and then do the trimming and cutting into pieces myself to save ALOT of money.  Great recipe - thanks!

The sauce is a good idea to accompany the meat.  Use the marinade because the tang is a nice contrast to the rich sauce.  I notice many reviewers said the meat was too weel done.  I thought the time on this looked long.  I heated to 400 degrees and turned it down as soon as the meat went in the oven cooking for only 30 minutes total - I used a meat thermometer and for rare you want 130 degrees farenheit.

Excellent!  I tried this for the first time for a dinner with my in-laws.  The blue cheese sauce is to die for! I admit it could be used on other meats too.  The tenderloin came out a bit more done than I wanted it, but it was still great! (admittedly I had it in the oven on warm for about 30 minutes because my in-laws hadn't arrived yet) My husband is not much of a blue cheese lover(I am a blue cheese fan, btw!), but he really liked the sauce, it wasn't too overpoweringly blue cheesy.  I used Maytag Blue and it was awesome! I will definitely make this again and again!

Oh goodness, I have found a new weakness-the blue cheese sauce that is posted here is absolutely incredible-creamy and flavorful but not overpowering.  Tenderloin was $15.99 a pound the other day-yikes.  So, we settled with sirloins and they were fine-I am convinced that sauce would make anything taste good!  I doubled the recipe for the sauce, we used it on some asparagus and it was wonderful.  It also works as a great dip-I had some late last night with pretzels and it was delicious.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe-this one is a definite keeper!

This is an unbelievable recipe!!! So quick and easy too. Tenderloin is a bit expensive for a dinner for two so I used 1 1/2 in sirloin steaks an did the recipe the same!!! What a perfect Valentines day dinner!!! My husband is a picky eater and this definately got him to clear his plate.  Five stars!!!

I made a different beef tenderloin recipe, but this blue cheese sauce and everyone LOVED the sauce. I kept it warm by putting it in a silver gravy boat, and it did not get too thick. It is a great compliment to the beef.

Delicious!  I marinated the meat all day, so it would really be flavourful.  The could have cut the meat with a spoon!  The sauce was delicious, and because we love blue cheese, we didn't find it overpowering at all.  We served it with horseradish mashed postatoes, and pan fried asparagus.  It was the best meal I've made!

Well I wasn't too thrilled with the blue cheese sauce, it was a tad strong.  However I did enjoy the taste of the marinaide in the beef.  I decided that 1/2hr wasn't long enough and did 7hrs instead.  It was mouthwatering.  Hubby likes his meat well done so it will need to be cooked for longer than the recipe stated. Prob another 25-30 minutes would have done it.

I used the blue cheese sauce with the London Broil II (which was excellent) recipe from the night before. I had leftovers and wanted to spice them up. I used Maytag Blue Cheese and it was just awesome. Everyone loved the blue cheese sauce, they even dipped potato chips and steamed shrimp in it as well. I saved the extra sauce and refrigerated it. Its also great on sandwiches and salads. Definitely a repeat recipe for me.

I made this recipe last night and thought it was exceptional. This morning I made my husband a sandwich for his lunch with the left over meat and spread a layer of the sauce on one slice of bread. It is something I will make over again!

We made this a few years ago and it was fabulous . . .  but just made it yesterday for Christmas day and it was just okay.  I'm not sure what the difference was, maybe the grade of the beef.  Since tenderloin prices have gone way up, I bought the less expensive "choice" tenderloin.   I added extra garlic and marinated it for several hours as recommended by other reviewers.  It was just okay, not a lot of flavor.  So very disappointing when spending $50 on a piece of meat.  The blue cheese sauce was really good, but the beef was just okay.  Next time I will just make the Beef tenderloin with shallot  sauce (which I've made several times and is always good). . . unless we splurge for a higher grade meat.

So grateful for this recipe it has been my go-to fancy dinner for company for years now.  Although a major change is length of cooking time. We do the initial 15 min at 450 then only 20-23 min at 375 depending on preference. It is a beautiful thing cooking a whole tenderloin as you get variations of doneness throughout the cut of meat from the end to the thick middle and other end so something for everyone. I have found a roughly 3-4lb chateaubriand cut or that portion of the tenderloin at 20 min at 375 ends up more rare to medium rare which I love so add a few minutes for more doneness if you prefer, just be careful how much time you leave it in as I find the 30-40 min at 375 overcooked it for my preference. But love blue cheese, love this sauce, and cooking method for the whole tenderloin. Thank you!

Oh and just a tip - I buy the whole tenderloin at Costco about 6.5-7lbs, but trim it and cut off parts myself so you usually end up with somewhere between 3-5lbs of the chateaubriand cut/tenderloin to cook. If serving with sides like potatoes etc this consistently feeds 8 for dinner with a little left over or I’ve fed 9 with a few slices leftover. 10ppl would leave nothing to spare so have some filling sides as well. Next day you can reheat slices in a saucepan with the blue cheese sauce or a broth just to warm up and it’s delicious all over again as long as not overcooked the first time around.

I was nervous trying this recipe for the first time off a dinner party of 16. Several told me it was the best tenderloin they'd ever had!  Marinaded just as described. The 30 minutes at 375 after the first 15 at 450 created a perfect pink center-not too rare and not too done and so moist. When you take it out, remember it will cook a little more so trust the internal temp of 140-150 as done enough.

Loved this recipe .. I did make a few changes  since it was just for my husband and I. I used two table spoons of Duke's mayonnaise  a table spoon of sour cream and  a teaspoon of garlic powder I didn't have  Worcestershire sauce so I used a half of teaspoon of soy sauce and it turned out delicious  we used it  to top our ribeye steak and a  tbone steak . I will be making this again

Very easy and delicious.  I used a thicker roast because there wasn't any tenderloin when I was shopping.  Consequently, it turned out too rare for most of my family.  I will make again using a different cut of beef. The blue cheese sauce was delicous!

Beautiful flavour .  The only thing I did was add a couple teaspoons of horse radish to the cheese sauce.  Even a beginner cook could pull this one off.  Loved it!

This was a great recipe. The marinade can be used for any kind of meat. It was really amazing. As far as the blue cheese sauce: If you don't like strong blue cheese flavor, then use the crumbled BC in the container. If you want a strong distinct BC flavor, get a good veined wedge and crumble it yourself.

I served mine with Prosciutto wrapped asparagus and garlic roasted butternut squash. A good wine pairing would be a dry red. I went with a bottle of Old Vine Zinfandel but any deep red blend or cab would be great with it. Just nothing sweet. 

Also, instead of a roasting pan, I used a cast iron skillet that I let heat up while the oven was preheating. I flipped the steaks once during the 15 minutes at 450, to equally sear both sides.

It is a little overcooked for 30 mins. Maybe I will try 20 mins and flip it each 10 mins

I used a tri-tip because beef tenderloin was $50 at the grocery store.  Meat turned out great, sauce was amazing.  Everyone that tried it absolutely loved it.  This was an easy recipe that I will definitely make again in the future.

Nice basic recipe, although the cook time seemed to be a little long. Very basic marinade & sauce was a nice accent. I served the sauce on the side, as the kids prefer the meat plain. Only change would be to get a meat thermometer to ensure the ends wouldn't be over cooked.

This recipe was perfect for our Christmas dinner. The smallest (least expensive) tenderloin I could find at my grocery was 7 lbs.  I asked the butcher to cut it in two pieces.  I serve the 4 lb. portion to my family (there were 9 of us) and it was the perfect amount.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. I love blue cheese and loved the sauce.  However, I will say that a little goes a long way.  Just tell your family to try a little of the sauce and not drown it should be great!

Everyone loved this tenderloin and several asked for the recipe.  It was easy and delicious and I'll make it again and again!

This is the best beef dish I have ever made. Everyone raved about it. The marinade is simple and easy to make. The blue cheese sauce is also fabulous. I did not make any changes and it was perfect. I have been afraid to cook beef based on past experiences and ruining expensive meat but will definitely make this again.

This recipe is delish! The marinade really adds some great flavor to a cut of beef that is already perfect. And I'm a sucker for anything with sour cream and blue cheese. We have adopted this for our Christmas Eve dinner every year.

Delicious!  Took the roast out of the oven when the internal temp reached 125 degrees, let sit for 10 min.  Middle of the roast was perfectly medium rare!  Definitely will make again and again.

This was pretty good. I used a london broil since tenderloin is so expensive & marinated it for 4 hours as per reviews. I cooked it according to the directions & it was a little well done. I will do it for less next time. The sauce had a little too much of a Worcestershire taste but it was good. Thanks.

This is so good! What a fantastic recipe. I have been looking for the perfect marinade recipe and this is definately it! So light and flavorful. One note, however - I used a tenderloin that was a little over 2 pounds, about 2.3, and had to cook it about 15 minutes longer to get it medium. Juices were still red when I checked on it after the recommended time. Still very very good. Served w/Honey Roasted Red Potatoes from this site, steamed asparagus and cornbread. Very good!

This is the best tenderloin ever. My husband even liked the sauce and he usually does not like sauces. I did bake it a bit longer then the time given so that it was well done - it was still very tender!  This recipe is a keeper.

This sauce is by far my hubby's (and mine as well) favorite.  He requests it all the time and like some of the other reviews I am looking for different ways to use it, maybe with little crustinis or on baked potatoes.  Regardless, DELICIOUS!

This was the BEST!  I served with baked asparagus, and baked potato.  The meat was tender and delish, however, it needed to cook much longer than the suggested time for it to come out medium rare (middle) / medium (at the ends) about 1 hour longer.  I used a 3.5# roast.  The blue cheese sauce was excellent.  I also used it on the asparagus and potatoes.

Yum! I loved this marinade and the way it paired with the bleu cheese sauce. My husband didn't think the steaks we grilled had much flavor after marinating for 6 hours, and he doesn't like bleu cheese (although he at least tried the sauce) so this recipe isn't for him - but the flavor blend was exceptional! The next night we had leftover sauce (since I was the only one eating it) and we marinated chicken the same way - JUST AS GOOD! The marinade and sauce were a wonderful pair. I will at least be making the bleu cheese sauce again, and I'll sneak the marinade in as often as I can. Loved it!

Very good & simple.  Next time I would use kraft horseradish sauce for a little zip in the sauce.  Will make again.

All I can say is wow!  Of course how can you go wrong with tenderloin.  I absolutely loved the sauce.  I actually put some on the steamed veggies I had on the side as well.  Wonderful dish - thanks for the recipe!

I agree that the sauce was a bit overpowering, but the marinade was great. I was only cooking for two, and the tenderloin didn't look all that great, so I used sirloin and broiled for 5 minutes on the top rack and 8 minutes on the bottom for medium rare. I'd also recommend marinating for a little longer and using more garlic. But overall--it was delicious.

This blue cheese sauce was amazing.  I used gorgonzola because its a little milder.  My entire family loved it, even my son, who doesn't like blue cheese at all.

I thought the meat was good.  I cooked it only 30 minutes and would go even less next time.  The sauce was wonderful.  I used cream cheese instead of mayo.  I saved the remaining sauce to go on sandwiches!

I'm a blue cheese lover and I didn't care for this sauce, it seemed to overpower the delicious marinade. I let my steaks soak for about 4 hours and then grilled them, they were perfect. I'll use the marinade again but never the sauce.

Pretty good, I used 1/2 cup of cream cheese instead of the mayonnaise and cut the sour cream in half and also added a little cayenne.

Made this for a party of 14 on Valentines day.  This received rave reviews from every guest.  The only issue was the cook time.  We bouth the tenderloin and took a little more than an hour so we were late serving.  Will definetly serve again.

this recipe was excellent though i would recommend making half as much blue cheese dressing, the meat has such a great taste that many of my guests declined the sauce.

The flavor of the meat is heavily dependant on the type of teriyaki you use, so be sure to get one you like.  As for the blue cheese sauce...it's almost like horseradish.  It has a tangy/bitter bite.  Unfortunately, the sweat sock smell (of the blue cheese) and the fact it tastes almost like store bought horseradish isn't enough for me to make this again.

The blue cheese sauce is great. I marinated t-bone steaks and grilled them in place of using the tenderloin.

I only made the blue cheese sauce and put it on top of a NY Strip Steak which I grilled with just salt and pepper.  Yummy!!  I made half the recipe which was more than enough for two medium sized steaks.  Next time I will add extra blue cheese to the sauce since I love blue cheese..

The blue cheese sauce was great, I've made just that and poured it over burgers and chicken.  I was not too impressed with the tenderloin.

My man absolutely loved this combo of meat and blue cheese. I served the sauce on the side, so I think the tenderloin it's self needs an extra kick. Maybe some rosemary. Overall excellent recipe!

My husband loved it! The kids were so-so. The blue cheese flavor was rather overwhelming.
