This was great.  I wanted to experiment with edamame and found this recipe.  Did reduce the oil to 1 tsp and added minced garlic.  Otherwise made it as given.  We really liked it.  Great crunch and the natural veggie sweetness came through.  I would have never thought to use seasoned salt.  Good choice.  Thanks, Christine.

Steaming Edamame, lima beans and corn save lots of calories.  You can make yummy succotash by steaming these veggies together and then just adding some Butterbuds, salt and pepper.

This was awesome! I took a lot of liberties...eliminated the oil, added kidney beans, a bunch of different spices. It was great all around. You could make this a bunch of different ways, and never get bored.Great idea to substitute the edamame for the lima bean. I never did like lima beans.

Love this! I like lima beans, but love edamame, so I'd take this recipe over traditional succotash any day.  Only thing I do differently is add some dried thyme, but you could season it any way you like.  I may have added a clove of garlic from time to time, too!  Frozen corn works well, too.

This is really good. It makes alot, I think next time I will cut it in half b/c we had alot leftover. I made exactly as written using tastefully simple seasoned salt to spice it up. I will be making this again. Thanks!

This isn't bad. You have to like edamame to really appreciate this dish. It's got a very strong flavor. But it's a nice alternative. I might make it again.

I had never tried soybeans before and was looking for something different.  I tried another soybean recipe on here as well, and didn't like it either.  I would have liked it better with lima beans....and I eat lots of healthy things other people won't touch....

Used 3 ears of corn instead of canned/frozen as it was in season, and butter instead of oil.  Yum

I loved it.  Added red bell pepper.  There was something red in the picture!  I steamed everything and just placed the cut pepper in the bottom of the strainer.  A little butter and salt and done.  Next day I ate the leftovers chilled with a splash of balsamic vinegar and it was very refreshing.

Delicious, simple healthy meal. I added two boneless skinless chicken breast fully cooked via skillet and oil to the final product and the whole family gobbled it up!

I have never cooked with edamame in recipes but enjoy them in salads, etc. In many ways I started with this recipe as a base for a large family gathering (25 people!). On a stovetop, I cooked frozen lima beans, edamame and corn as directed on package, adding each separately as they required different cooking times. In another saucepan I melted butter and added a fresh red pepper. I also added fresh herbs (thyme, rosemary, cilantro) and dried herbs (thyme and savory), along with salt, seasoned salt and white pepper to taste. Mixed all together after draining veggies and served. The edamame was a big hit in the succotash.
