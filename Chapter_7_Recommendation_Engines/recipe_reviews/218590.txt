This is a beautiful dish. I used sun-dried tomatoes instead of grape tomatoes and they added a wonderful flavor. I had feta cheese, so I used that in place of the parmesan.  I also served chopped avocado and arugula over the top. The leftovers made a perfect breakfast the next day.

I used spinach instead of chard, I used red peppers for the red and green effect for Christmas brunch  frittata!! I love them because they are crustless! Goat cheese as well instead of regular cheese! Everyone loved them!!

I used cooked Swiss chard with feta to the recipe and it was delicious.  See Allrecipes Swiss chard and feta recipe.

I used what I had & it was fantastic! My veggies included onion, leftover broccoli, tomatoes, red bell, and a little spinach. I also didn't add the cheese - still great!
