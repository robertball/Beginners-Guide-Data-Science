Didn't have lime leaves and did use tomatoes & less fresh ginger (personal taste).  Added some baby bok choy and used ramen from my chineese grocery store.  Loved the Cook's Footnotes.  Awesome.

This is delicious.  I made this for my fussy family and my husband loves a rich depth to a soup or sauce.  I made this and exchanging the lime leaves for zest, and no chicken.  I was looking for a flavorful broth and it delivered.

So good... another win at home!  I changed the lemongrass to lemongrass paste, changed the lime leaves to lime zest, used ginger paste, and doubled the sriracha.  Everyone loves!

LOVED IT! I use to frequent a restaurant and would order this.. I've ben craving it for 15 years, and always wanted to make it myself. and then I found this recipe!! I changed it a tad, as I hate cilantro, and had a whole chicken to use.. came out just better than I remembered, and was even better the second day! Thank you.. the footnotes were great. I used more lime juice, and siracha as I like it tangy and spicy..cant wait to make it again! Thank you!!!!

I like Thai soups with lemongrass, so I thought I'd try this recipe.    I personally liked it and my son did, too, but my daughter and husband weren't really fans.  I couldn't find the lime leaves in the store, so I omitted them.

This is the 2nd time I've made this dish and it is quickly becoming one of my favorites! This time around I modified the recipe slightly, but still came out delicious.   
- I used shrimp instead of chicken (which I added in later in the process due to the shorter cooking time). 
- I was out of carrots this time so these were missing in the recipe.   
- I added ramen noodles (with the flavoring packet excluded) to include a starch. This would probably also be good with a rice such as Basmati.
