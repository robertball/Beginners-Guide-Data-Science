This is an excellent recipe.  I added a few drops of worcestire sauce and garlic salt to the turkey. Also, I added ricotta and feta cheese to the mozarella and spinach mixture, along with one egg to bind them.  Lastly, I brushed the top of the loaf with a mixture of the pasta sauce and chili sauce.  Thank you very much for the recipe.  I will be using it frequently

This was a very tasty meatloaf, full of flavor and good for you too. I didn't have soft breadcrumbs so I used dried Italian style breadcrumbs but reduced the amount to a 1/2 cup, I also always add a tbs of olive oil per lb of turkey to add a little fat the the mix since turkey is so lean other than that I followed the recipe as written. Those who made comments about this tasting like a giant "meatball" are pretty close to the truth. Honestly though, how far can you expect the taste of this to be from a meatball when one of the main ingredients is pasta sauce? If that really bothers you or you wanted to achieve a different end you can always forgo the pasta sauce and use the more traditional ketchup. However, I liked this recipe very much and will be making it again I am sure :)

I got some good ideas from other reviews. I used dry stuffing mix, added extra spaghetti sauce, Worcester sauce and cooking sherry to soften and crush it with a fork. After adding turkey to ingredients it was too moist so I added 1/2 cup of oatmeal. I used fresh baby spinach wilted in the microwave then chopped and added some feta cheese to the mozzarella cheese and spinach. I added a little chili sauce to the remaining spaghetti sauce, spread it on top of the roll, sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top for last 10 min in oven. Even Judy loved it!

Easily one of the best meat loafs I've ever had. I am not a big fan of turkey meat, but this recipe knocked it out of the park. The only change I made was to pour the remainder of the sauce on top of the loaf with the some cheese with about 10 minutes to go. Very good, will most certainly make again!

This recipe is a keeper!! Although I don't really see how it could be considered 6 servings, as 2 adults and 1 toddler devoured the entire thing. (Along w/ various veggie side dishes.) I used 3 slices of honey whole wheat bread, torn into pieces, and browned at 225 deg. w/ a little olive oil and fresh herbs, then pulsed in the cuisinart quickly for my bread crumbs. Also added 1/4 c. diced bell pepper and 1 TB worcestershire sauce to the turkey. I was nervous about the rolley part, but it was quite easy. I just wish mine had come out looking as elegant as some of the pictures here! Appearances aside, it tasted delicious! We opted not to serve additional spaghetti sauce on top, but I know that the next go-around, I'll add more sauce to the turkey, and up the seasoning a bit for a little more zip. I didn't have a problem w/ the mildness of the mozzarella inside; in fact, I loved the gooey, cheesy spinach bites, like little meatloaf surprise explosions in my mouth!

Tastes like a giant meatball. If that's what you're after, go for it.Honestly, I may make it again, but with garlic salt. It was alittle bland.  I think the suggestions of using fresh spinach are good too. I used frozen. All in all, it's worth another try but with some changes. I was little nervous of Rolling it, but I was pleasantly surprised, it was easy.

This was amazing! I used a 4 cheese sauce and added real yellow mustard instead of ground for extra taste.I also used fresh baby spinach and sauted it with green pepper & onion in grape seed oil first before adding it to recipe. I grated mozza and cheddar cheese over it and again when done over the top. It was mouth watering to say the least. This will be one of our regulars now :)

This was delicious BUT the meat mixture was so soft, they went flat as they baked. I may add some hamburger next time to see if that helps.

This was easy to make and very good.  Personally I'd prefer a bit more flavor - maybe adding some cheddar cheese to the mozzarella, more garlic, and some grated veggies?  I ended up using more sauce than called for as well.

This is one of the best dishes I have ever made! Everyone was speechless, enjoying the flavor. I think the reason a lot of reviewers did not like it is obvious because their review includes major changes they made to their version (fat-free cheese, half the meat called for). This recipe has perfect proportions as is. The only thing I did differently was... using fresh, blanched spinach instead of frozen, and fresh herbs (tablespoon instead of teaspoon) instead of dried. Also, to make it a little healthier I used rolled oats instead of bread crumbs. I took other reviews into consideration when I made it. I cooled the flatten meat in the freezer while I got the spinach all chopped. I baked the loaf for 35 minutes then added the sauce and cooked another ten.

Good Turkey Meatloaf! Next time I will add a little more spices. I didn't have wax paper and found the dough to squishy to roll neatly, so I simply placed it on a baking sheet in a large circle with a slight indent in the middle and put the spinach in the indent and sprinkled the cheese all over, came out great!

Good but could be better, kind of bland.  I followed this recipe as stated except I added a little salt to the meat and spinach mixture.  I think this recipe has potential if it is spiced more to taste but as written it is bland.  If I would make again I would add parmesan to the spinach mixture and a more flavorful cheese other than mozzarella.  The mutz gives absolutely no flavor to this recipe only added calories.  It did smell wonderful when it was in the oven, but it kind of fizzled out when you tasted.

My husband felt the need to open a bottle of wine to accompany this MEATLOAF!  Who knew a pound of ground turkey could become something so AWESOME!!  Tweaked the recipe a bit for what I had on hand: Quaker oats instead of breadcrumbs, no ground mustard- used sage.  Excellent, I've already made it twice!!

This turned out very well for me. Both hubby and I liked it and will make it again.   Used Colemans Mustard , added more garlic and after patting the meatloaf mixture out on the wax paper, put it in the fridge until I was ready to add the spinach mixture and bake. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I left out the spaghetti sauce and used 1tsp onion powder instead of the chopped onion and it turned out fantastic! I also use about 1 and 1/2 cups of herbed stuffing instead of bread crumbs which added great texture. I gave some to my mother to take to work and she instantly had 5 people ask her for the recipe! This one is a keeper!

This is so good. I never have whole wheat bread crumbs so I always use 2/3 cup of regular or Italian style bread crumbs and it works great. I also add about 1/4 c to 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese. The spaghetti sauce really makes the flavor great so make sure to pick one you really like. I leave out the onions bc we don't really like them that much and it is still good. I don't think you can mess this one up - thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good--might try adding parmesan to it next time to up the flavor some.  One warning:  Since I love spinach and wanted to get some extra veggie servings, I decided to add more to the second batch.  Didn't turn out as well as I had hoped.  So, I went back to the original measurements the 3rd time.  Oh well.

I use prepared mustard instead of ground mustard, bagged spinach and added another ½ cup of bread crumbs (1-1/2 cups total). I ran out of mozzarella so I shredded parmesan cheese on top of the spaghetti sauce with 5 minutes left in the oven.  I’ve made this recipe four times so far and it’s delicious every time!!

This meatloaf came out beautifully and tasted great.  Smelled soooo good while cooking.  Hubby raved!  I followed the recipe closely with a couple minor exceptions:  had some onion burger buns to use up so made my own onion-y breadcrumbs, used onion powder instead of mincing onion, and six slices of mozzarella instead of shredded.  A little tricky rolling this sucker, refridgerate the turkey rectangle for a half hour or so to firm it up a little before attempting the roll.  I also used Pam spray on the wax paper.  A winner!  Thanks, Delia, one terrific meal.

This is delisious and easy to make...so good that it's the first recipe I've ever come back to make!  My whole family loved it and immediately asked when we could have it again.  I've changed the two eggs to three egg whites, just to save a few calories, but otherwise I make it as written.

Our family really loved this whole idea. I didn't season it like they said though. 

We left out sauce, and used parmesan instead of mozzarella. We used dried sandwich bread instead of crumbs, and seasoned it with onions and Mrs. Dash -- reducing sodium. You can't mess it up. Just season it like you would any meatloaf an use the same procedure!

I was surprised how it held together. What a neat concept! Passed this recipe on to many friends of my husband's at work, after he warmed it for supper they all started saying how good it smelled and wanted the recipe!

I was lazy and simply mixed the ingredients up instead of making a roll. The flavors were great, we were just looking for something saucy to do with our healthy low fat ground turkey!

This was recommended to me by someone on the recipe buzz. It tasted pretty good and it looked kinf of fancy to. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have soft whole wheat bread crumbs, so I just used plain bread crumbs. I didn't have waxed paper but parchment paper worked fine to roll it. We enjoyed this today thank you.

Definitely a keeper. It wasn't the greatest meatloaf ever, but so many brownie points for the visual appeal! More garlic next time.

I LOVE this meal!! Instead of serving it with the remaining spaghetti sauce on top, I tried dipping it in Asian dumpling sauce. It sounds very strange, but it was delicious.

This was fantastic, and very easy to put together. I used about 3/4 cup dry bread crumbs, and fresh baby spinach that I wilted in the microwave. I had a bit of feta left over, so I threw that in there too. For the last 10 minutes of baking, I put more spaghetti sauce on top and sprinkled with some (Mexican!) cheese so it could get all toasty. Super delicious!! Served it with a pasta salad and champagne for New Year's Eve.

I made it exactly as written.  It was definitely below average (hence two stars).  It is bland, and the flavor it does have is less than impressive.  Sorry!  It appears that most people who rated this higher didn't make it as written.

I really liked this recipe. I used fresh spinach instead of canned or frozen and it worked great. I used a tomato basil sauce which complemented it well. Will make again but I may add some more seasonings was a little bland.

For the first time I messed up a recipe by not paying attention. I put the whole cup of sauce in the mixture and couldn't roll it up so I shaped it into a loaf. I doubled the feta as well as the seasonings. The loaf turned out well.

The best compliment I could possibly receive from my husband: "you should give this recipe to my mother".  Made the recipe using dry bread crumbs and toasted onion (didn't have fresh), and like other reviewers I covered the roll in extra sauce and cheese for the last few minutes of cooking.

All in all pretty ok. The spinach lacked flavor though. Followed recipe to the letter, next time I will try fresh spinach and maybe flavor the spinach with garlic or ranch spices.

not so much.  my changes included approximately doubling all of the flavoring ingredients - herbs, spaghetti sauce, etc, but did not double the turkey and used fat free mozz...it wasn't that good.  very mushy, not great flavor and too much stringy spinach.

We really liked this.  I added some diced bell pepper and used cheddar instead of mozzarella.  It was a little on the mushy side - I think I will use more bread crumbs next time and try to roll it a little thinner.  Great recipe though!

Excellent recipe.... I had to double it for a big family. Didn't have exact ingredients. Used cracker crumbs & oatmeal, 3 eggs, 2 T. hot mustard, Worcestershire, cheddar cheese, Tabasco sauce. I used bread pans & layered it up. Really great flavor. I will definitely make this again. TY

I was a little unsure about this one, as I searched for a decent 'turkey' recipe. But, I was beyond impressed with the end result! -- The turkey keeps the roll a bit lighter than with beef and adding in a little turkey sausage added a great kick. The cheesy, spinach center was the real standout - a great way to make a boring meatloaf into something way more special.

Could not have been happier!  This was my first turkey meatloaf, and it sure is a keeper.  Hubby loved it, too.  We both love spinach, and all I had was 3/4 bag of fresh baby spinach, so sauteed it with a little garlic.  It wasn't enough, so opened a can, squeezed it dry, and used it all.  The only thing I did differently was use one egg instead of two.  Rolling this into a beautiful loaf was no problem.  Thanks for a new favorite for us!

very yummy. i had a hard time rolling it up so i just layered meat than spinach/ch and then meat again. I also added mushrooms but it made it a little runny - I'd cook the mushroom and spinach more next time. Then again i used frozen onion so that may have added to the water. Flavor was delicious just had to drain it and then cook for a few more minutes.

I made this exactly as the recipe directed.  It was tricky to roll because the meatloaf mixture was so soft (I even put the rectangle of meat in the freezer for a few minutes hoping it would help but it didn't).  It smelled delicious while it was baking.  The finished product wasn't very pretty and the texture was a little mushy but the flavor was very good.  My husband loved it.  It was good enough that I'd make it again, maybe using a smaller amount of dry bread crumbs and only 1 egg. 2 eggs for 1 pound of meat seems like a lot.

Be aware, the meat mixture really is quite mushy. I used dry breadcrumbs and ended up using about a cup and a half to make it workable. I think I would consider using just 1 egg next time. To the mixture I added some rosemary and thyme to the other ingredients because I love how they work with ground turkey. The mixture firmed up during baking, and this dish had a really good flavor, but to be honest, as strange as it sounds, I think one package of spinach is too much. I do plan on making this again, but I will do so making those changes.

I live in a low carb world and this was absolutely delishious! I used fresh spinich and substituted chopped green peper for onion. This has a meatloaf like texture, and we ate it with spaghetti sauce. Next time I will put it on the top before I bake it.

This is a pretty neat recipe. It was a little bland, though so next time I'll add some salt. I'll definitely use fresh spinach next time as well. Make sure to only put 1/4 c. of the spaghetti sauce in the meat loaf. When I read "1 cup divided" at first I thought it meant 1/2 cup. Unfortunalty I was in a rush while preparing it the first time around. I definitely plan on making it again, though. Just needs a little tweaking.

This is my second time making this and my family and I absolutely love this. I used everything the recipe called for, except for the garlic cloves, because I never have them on hand. The meat mixture was a bit too juicy, but I still love it. I give this 2 thumbs up.

This was fantastic! We totally perfer this over the beef meatloaf. I did a couple of things different though. I used italian bread crumbs and green onion because that's what I had on hand. Also, I chopped up an extra garlic clove and put in the middle with the spinach and added cheese to the meet as well as some in the middle. Would definately make again!

One important note - this recipe needs salt!   Use 1/2 to 3/4 tsp. according to your taste.  That said, this is so delicious.  I make it over and over for my family and they gobble it up.  I actually used 1.25 pounds of turkey because that's the way it's packaged in our stores.  I just added another 1/4 cup of crumbs and a bit more seasoning.  Mine baked up much faster than 50 minutes but then I do use a convection oven.   Use an instant-read thermometer and pull it out the minute it reaches 160 degrees.  This I will make again and again.  Easy!

Hubs decided to top with A-1 steak sauce before I got to the spaghetti sauce, and I added some Montreal Steak Seasoning to the mix.  I also added about 1/2 as much more bread crumbs just because my ground turkey was rather wet.  I don't have mozzarella so subbed with cheddar.  Pretty good--my hubs only complaint was the spinach in the middle--I guess he isn't a fan of that in meatloaf, but otherwise it was a good meal with rice and peas.  thanks for the recipe!

This was VERY good! I added a little more cheese, but other than that kept it as is. Will make this weekly!

Lovely recipe. Added two cloves minced garlic to the spinach and two cloves minced garlic to the ground meat before rolling. We put this together and froze it until we were ready to cook it. Froze beautifully.

Since other reviewers said it tasted like a meatball, I left out the garlic,  added only half the oregano and only one egg.  I also  used smoked gouda instead of mozarella.  very good and DIFFERENT!!!

I have no idea why this got such good reviews.  I found it extremely bland.  Also, the meat mixture was too moist with two eggs, so I had to add additional bread crumbs.  All I tasted was spinach.  It needs more seasoning & more tomato sauce in the meat to give it some flavor.  Also a stronger cheese may help.  Mozarella is too mild.  I doubt I will make this again.

The smell was a little unappealing, but I think all meatloaf smells unappealing! And my husband LOVED it!

Yummy!! Mine wasn't dry at all. I used fresh baby spinach that I sauteed and then drained about half of the liquid out.

Great use of ground turkey. I used frozen spinach, which was good, but I think using wilted fresh spinach would be better.  Had to serve it with a lot of extra spaghetti sauce as it still tasted dry to me, but I know that it just because it is made with turkey instead of beed

I'm not a big fan of ground turkey meat nor do I particularly like spinach, but I decided to try this recipe anyway. And I'm so glad I did. I LOVED it! My husband says he likes it better than beef meatloaf. I made only one change. I used a half cup of catsup instead of spaghetti sauce in the meatloaf and never felt the need to put any sauce over it at the end. The flavor was already terrific. I also feel that if you're a person that doesn't really like spinach, you could leave it off without any problem. It would still be just as good.
