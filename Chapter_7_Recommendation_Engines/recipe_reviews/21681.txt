This recipe for chess squares works very well, and is easy. I cut it in half, and it fit a 9" round pan perfectly. They are really, really sweet and very rich. 

The recipe makes a lot of the cream cheese layer, you could easily cut it in half if you want less sugar. 

Overall, if you like chess squares, this recipe is great. If you think it's too much sugar, you're obviously not from the South.

Enjoyed by all, but I only used one package of cream cheese and 2 cups of confectioner's sugar for the topping and reduced the cooking time to 30 minutes. Turned out perfect.

This is great. I added a can of cherry pie filling on top and it tasted just like cheesecake.

Excellent!  Richer and denser than most chess square recipes.  My co-workers RAVED (and raved some more).

The best recipe for this great dessert!  Any cheesecake lover will love these.  For those that say they're too sweet, they just don't know what a good southern dessert is! If you're looking for an original chess square recipe, this has to be it. Thanks for sharing!

They taste exactly how they should.  I lived in the south (Mississippi) for 2 and a half years and yep, this is how they make em.  I love em, they are super yummy and I've always had rave reviews when I make them too.  I recommend this one!  My only complaint is that the recipe doesn't tell you that the cream cheese part rises up quite a bit.  The person who said a 9 in round must have used 1/2 the cream cheese part because I too used a 9 inch round and half the cream cheese is sitting at the bottom of my oven in my smoke filled kitchen.  Don't use a 9 inch round people.

I made the mistake of first tasting these when they were warm and it was too much but once refrigerated, they're better.

I originally got this recipe from my aunt 'cille (Lucille) years ago and had misplaced it - I am so happy to have found it with you again!  I have also made this with German Choc. cake mix and it was great for those also needing a little choc. in there-- great recipe I will make it time and time again.

I have made this recipe several different ways, for those that say its too sweet I have a suggestion. Use the low fat cream cheese. I made some and it cut down the sweet and made them a bit tangy but they cooked up the same.

I followed another reviewer's suggestion and only made 1/2 of the top layer.  I also accidentally used lemon cake mix instead of yellow and it was really good.

My husband LOVED it and I didn't. So we compromised at a 4 star rating. I thought there was too much cream cheese but we both loved the pecans in the crust. (93)

My grandmother used to make these for me as a kid, and I never had the recipe, nor could I find these in most bakeries. I gave this recipe a shot and I'm so glad I did! They come out so gooey and dense. They are also so simple to prepare! This is a perfect dessert for busy moms. Also, these definitely need to cool before you try them. I tried it warm and thought I had done something wrong because they were still a little runny. Once they cooled, they were absolutely perfect! This is a wonderful, almost fool proof recipe. Thanks so much for submitting it!

WOW! These are awesome!!!! I made this exactly as indicated except I used 3 1/2 cups of sugar since some suggested it may be sweet. They turned out perfect. Very rich, but oh so very good. Highly recommend. I will definitely make these again. Made them for a get together and everybody loved them. Also, I use butter cake mix rather than white.

These were excellent and SO easy and quick.  I left out the pecans, due to being in a pinch and not having any and they were still delish. I cut them up in to bars for a bake sale, they were not hard enough to have sharp edges, but that was their appeal, they were visibly moist and soft and SOLD like hotcakes. Will make again for my family.

OOOOOHHHH so wonderful.  I had these years ago and came to this wedsite just to look for this recipe.  I made it both with and without the pecans.  I prefer without.  My husband shared a couple with his work buddies.  They all give you five stars

I made these for a Thanksgiving get together and everyone raved!!!  I thought I would have some left over to bring home, but they were gone in just a few minutes!!  Some people took some home too and everyone wanted the recipe.  I've made other similar recipes for chess squars, but I really think this is the best recipe I've made.  Thanks for a great recipe; now everyone thinks I'm a great cook.  And it was so easy.

This recipe is wrong! Most of the recipe is doubled but it doesn't say that. It should be 2 boxes of cake mix and 2 eggs going into crust. I followed recipe exactly and it turned out awful! I have checked against other recipes since it was such a flop.

A great way to get a sweet fix! I made these last night at my husband and father-in-law's request. They turned out good, but slightly burnt. I cooked them for forty-five minutes like the recipe suggested, but next time will check on them after thirty minutes. Will try again with a shorter cook time!

Great recipe!   Also good with lemon cake mix instead of yellow.  Gives it a nice citrus-y flavor.  Can't go wrong either way!

The crust was too dry, but the cream cheese layer turned out well and was very delicious.

The nuts threw me off a little.  Chess squares I have had from other people have not included nuts, and it seemed as though the cake part of the recipe turned out drier than it should have but overall the taste was good.

I'd lost my original recipe so I tried this one. It turned out great. Everyone loved it. If I had to critique something it would be it taste more like cream cheese cake square than like a chess square. I would recommend adding a tbsp of vanilla extract to the cream cheese mix if you are looking for that chess pie taste.

I cut the  recipe in half and baked it in a 9 x 9 square and it came out perfect.  I did leave out 2 or 3 tablespoons of powdered sugar in the cream cheese mix, because it tasted more then sweet enough.  I also added a half a tablespoon of vanilla to the base and the cheesecake filling just for more flavor.

Made two different varieties. In both I used only 3 cps sugar. In both I omitted the nuts because I was baking for a public function.  First with chocolate cake. Daughter claimed it was the best thing she ever ate! The second I used lemon cake mix and drizzled melted seedless raspberry jam over the top. This was fantastic tasting! Not as pretty as I'd hoped, the edges bubbled up and were brownish. Nothing a dab of cool whip couldn't cure!The centre of the cake was beautiful and swirly.

This is a great recipe! I never had these with the pecans. Now pecans are a must! The only thing I did different was, I only used 1 cup of sugar and vegan butter.   "PERFECT "!   Thanks for this recipe. Very easy!

This is one of my absolute favorite desserts, and this recipe does not disappoint!  I made a 'test' batch of these to make sure it was what I was looking for, and I had to try really hard not to eat the whole pan myself - SO good!

Thank you so much for this recipe! My boyfriend has been wanting chess squares for the longest time, but didn't know anyone that knew how to make them except for his grandmother who he only sees once a year. Im not much of a baker, but they turned out wonderful and everyone LOVES them. =0 I would recommend not eating them right out of the oven. They are so much better after they've been refrigerated.

This recipe is good for serving buttermilk pie to a crowd. Very easy to make with ingredients I had on hand. Also, the flavor is poplular with a lot of people. I had another recipe similar to this and I will probably follow it next time. I would reduce butter to 1/2 c. and omit pecans. The cake part on the bottom swelled too much and wasn't very crust like. At any rate, with these changes I think it will be closer to the actual buttermilk/chess pie.
