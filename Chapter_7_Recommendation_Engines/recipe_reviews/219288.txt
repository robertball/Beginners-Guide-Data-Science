Easy and very flavorful. I varied the recipe a little. After taking the pepperoni topped chicken out of the oven and removing the foil I poured on spaghetti sauce and topped with mozzarella. EXCELLENT low carb Chicken Parmesan!!

This is my new favorite meal! My dad and I make this every other week or so! You can either use provolone (which I suggest) or sprinkle Parmesan on it but I do both (I like cheese) Great with angel hair pasta in a buttery sauce or a spaghetti sauce! This is so yummy!!!

Mmmm. So easy and so yummy. My 4 year old daughter even eats it (trust me that's saying something). This is simple requires very few ingredients and is an excellent spin on boring old chicken breasts. Try it!

This was a hit with my family we all enjoyed it; the combination of chicken pepperoni and cheese was delicious we'll likely be adding this recipe to our monthly rotation. Thank you for sharing this recipe Rae it was a hit.

This is easy and comes together quickly for a week-night dinner. We liked it and thought it tasted best with marinara sauce. I served it with spaghetti.

Pretty blah..sounded more interesting than it tastes. Maybe it depends on the type of "zesty Italian Dressing" used and/or the thickness of the chicken breast.
