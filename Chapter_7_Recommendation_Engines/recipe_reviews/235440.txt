This is as the title says the best sweet potato casserole. Good hot or cold. This is good enough for dessert. A real keeper of a recipe.

Made this today for Thanksgiving  2016. Absolutely Awesome. 5 stars! I added 1 TBL of cinnamon and 1/4 top of nutmeg. It's definitely a keeper.

Love this! I was looking for a recipe like the one they make around where I grew up and this is almost as good. I left out the coconut though. I've made this several times now and have been told that it is excellent.

Best sweet potatoes ever! I baked the potatoes and then peeled them. I used half & half instead of milk. Everyone gave my casserole rave reviews.

I had planned to do a different recipe, but I forgot about my sweet potatoes in the oven and way over-baked them. I had no options but something mashed. And I'm so glad! This recipe turned out to be amazing and everyone loved them for Thanksgiving dinner. My BIL commented that you could just put these into a pie crust and eat them for dessert! The pecan topping was by far the best part. Forget marshmallows, this is the way to eat sweet potatoes.
I didn't add the coconut because several people in my family don't like it, so I look forward to making it again with the coconut. My changes were 1 more cup of sweet potatoes when I saw the amount of butter and sugar (and they were really sweet still) and I added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg to the potato mixture.
This is my new sweet potato recipe!

Hands down best sweet potatoes I've ever had. I didn't change anything in this recipe & wouldn't! The coconut really adds great flavor.
