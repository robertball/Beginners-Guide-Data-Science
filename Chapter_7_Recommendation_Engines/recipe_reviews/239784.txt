A fun, fast and easy recipe to make for a Halloween party for the kids.
My daughter said they look disgusting, just what I wanted to hear!

Thanks, Chef John for this: "Ewww! That is disgusting and gross" recipe! We had a lot of fun making it! Only change we used ketchup and cayenne pepper on the knuckle cuts. Happy Halloween :)
