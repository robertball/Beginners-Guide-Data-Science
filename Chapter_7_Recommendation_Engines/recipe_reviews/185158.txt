My avocados weren't ripe enough, so I made this without, and it was still delicious. You can really make this according to your preference: I used 16 oz whole-wheat fusilli, omitted the broccoli and onion, roasted my own peppers, and made my own Greek dressing (red-wine vinegar, olive oil, garlic, Dijon mustard, and fresh oregano). A great combination of veggies with lots of contrasting textures and vibrant flavors! It makes a ton, but as with any pasta salad, it's better the longer it sits. Can't wait to try this with avocados! UPDATE: The avocados added a nice creamy texture, but not much flavor. I think I'd rather just chop them up and mix them in with the rest of the veggies.

Loved everything except the artichokes and the zucchini. I think they gave it a sour/bitter taste. But I'm not a fan of either. Would leave them out next time. I used whole wheat pasta and it was great. Make sure you get a really ripe avocado!

Wonderful veggie & pasta salad.  I skipped the avos & broccoli and made my own dressing (Absolutely Fabulous Greek House Dressing) I added a carton of crumbled feta and some chickpeas too.  Delicious still several days later.

I made this with 16 oz rotini and no avocado or dressing. I used some of the oil from the various jarred items to moisten the noodles and added grated zucchini and carrot. It was very flavorful and fresh tasting, not soggy or oily like I might imagine this would be with so much dressing added to it. The flavors worked nicely together.

The picture shown, is not for this recipe.  Nonetheless, I made the recipe, omitted the broccoli and used black olives instead of kalamata olives.  It was so good and relatively healthy. If I make it again, I will add some avocado chunks to the pasta but then I love avocado!

Super good!! I made a homemade dressing, but Im sure the a bottled one will work just as good. I left out the olives also. It did make a lot of food. There was 3 1/2 of us eating (the half was a small portion). There was still enough leftovers for another meal. It was a little expensive to prepare, but very healthy and tasty.

Really enjoyed the salad. To me it had lots of flavor. I added feta to the salad.
