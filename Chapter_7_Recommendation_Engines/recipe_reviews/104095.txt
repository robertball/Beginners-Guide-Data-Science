This recipe was very yummy. Don't go into it thinking it's going to taste like pumpkin pie, however, or you will be disappointed. This is a pumpkin flavored, cheesecake. I used three cups of graham cracker, instead of 2 1/2, as well. I will make this again.

This recipe is really easy and tasty. My crust was really thin, so next time I think I'll use 4-4 1/2 cups of gram crackers. I also baked a pumpkin and used the pulp from that.  This increased the prep time, but I think it gave it more flavor (with the addition of pumpkin spice).

I had to alter this recipe a little bit, because I did not have all of the ingredients. I only had 1 cup of graham cracker crumbs so I added 2 tbs. sugar to it and 4 1/2 tbs of melted butter, I used a 9X9 pan. I only used 1 cup of sugar, and 1/2 cup sour cream, everything else I left the same. I added about a tsp. of pumpkin pie spice, and baked for 45 min. I'm not sure if pumpkin pie filling is different from just canned pumpkin, but my only problem with the finished product is a lack of spice. Next tme I will add a lot more pumpkin pie spice. Other than that it came out really good, very creamy!!! Thanks for sharing.

This was absolutely delicious. Even a guest who doesn't usually like pumpkin liked it. I will make this all fall long. Thanks for sharing it.
