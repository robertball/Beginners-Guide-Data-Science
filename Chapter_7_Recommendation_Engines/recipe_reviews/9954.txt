These were superb, and I have to disagree with the reviewer who said a good Madeleine should be dense and buttery (like the ones from Starbucks). Have you ever had a REAL French Madeleine? They're lighter than air. Starbucks serves very nice molded pound cakes, NOT Madeleines.

Easy and precise.
For those who have similar questions like me. 
You need a madeleines pan. I got mine at Bed bath and beyond. I used muffins pan earlier and it was a disaster. 
If you wonder whether baking powder is needed like in other recipe, and the answer is no.
Make sure the eggs mix is thick before you fold in flour and butter, it took about 10 minutes at high speed.

I am a real beginner, but I had no trouble with this recipe at all. The hard part, actually, was selecting a madeleine pan - there were many different ones to choose from at the cooking supply store, from $10.00 - $79.00, depending on size and material. I bought the $10.00 metal one (which makes one dozen 3" madeleines), and it worked absolutely fine. So no need to spend a fortune to get good results.

These are the best madeleines I have ever made. This was the pastry that Marcel Proust enjoyed for inspiration - and it seems to have worked for him! The only problem with the recipe is that it yields so few of the cookies. I doubled the recipe last time and I only made about 16 servings. My madeleine pan is a little bit larger, but still, the cookies were gone in less than fifteen minutes. Usually a good thing, but I had wanted to enjoy a couple later. I added a touch of honey and I thought it turned out to be phenomenal. Good luck and thanks for the recipe!

Perfect recipe!!  Whole family loved these delicate cookies.   I bought my pan a year ago and finally made madeleines.  Like other reviewer said, no need to by expensive non stick pan, grease and flour as directed and they pop out fine. I even greased and dusted with sugar instead of flour, worked great.  These are authentic in taste, light and airy.  If you want dense ones (like what starbucks sells), you can double the butter; but then you are really eating mini pound cakes, not madeleines.   I had to beat the eggs/sugar mixture the full 10 minutes.  I think this is the first recipe I reviewed that was 100% accurate and did not need one thing changed to perfect!!!

I used part cake flour (about one third of the total) owing to a Cook's Illustrated recipe and I added 1/4tsp orange flower water.  They were heavenly. And they looked so perfect that they could have come from a bakery.  Thanks for this keeper!

Very Good. Used my kitchen aid mixture. Did not fold in flour and zest. Just threw it in and blended it a little.

Update: 1/1/10

I would definitely recommend folding in the zest and flour. It will allow your batter to stay fluffy. My daughter and I visited the French Pastry School in Chicago and were taught how to make them. The key is to butter and flour every nook and cranny of the madeleine pan, so they come out perfectly shaped showing those deep ridges. If you get the belly bump, that's considered perfect. I never knew that, I thought they were incorrectly done if you had a bump. Well, those are tips straight from the horses mouth. Oh, I used a metal pan from Sur La Table. I'm one of those people who are wary of these non-stick/silicone/caphalon pans/cooking utensils. Its more work, but our grandparents did it, so can we!

This recipe is horrible!  Does not taste like Madeleines at all.  Madeleines are not supposed to be light and airy.  They should be dense and butter-y, like Starbucks!

I have never been tempted to review a great recipe... until now!! I'm not crazy about desserts but this is the first sweet treat I have experienced love at first bite in a long time. I'm am also no big on sliced cake or cupcakes. Madeleines are the best for portion control. These little cakes are the lightest, airiest, tastiest things. Do not use anymore flour than suggested, this is the biggest mistake. You want to taste eggy, buttery, vanillary, light and not dense and floury. If you do not have an electric mixer, or are too lazy to whip them for 10 minutes, you can put 1/4 tsp of baking powder. Mine come out perfectly light and airy. I added more sugar and vanilla than suggested, and it was perfectly tasty.

Recipe was very easy to make and came out almost perfect.  The Madeleines came out beautifully and great when warm but then as they cooled they were not as airy.  Perhaps this is they way they should be.  However, I would have preferred a more buttery and airy cake.  I used regular large eggs, non salted sweet butter and madagascar vanilla.  Perhaps tweaking the quality/grade of the ingredients will make the improvement.    But I still rate it a 5 because they were extremely easy to make, delicious and everyone loved them.  I would highly recommend a strong mixer.  I have a Kitchen Aid Pro which made beating the batter easy.  Would like to see someone post what "thick and pale ribbons form" looks like ( as specified in step 4.

Okay, so as far as the recipe goes, it's a well rounded Madeleine recipe. But instructions for the bake time was a bit shady. I noticed in the video they used a light pan and the one I own is a dark pan. So I figured to check them after ten minutes of bake time. These cooked up really quick. In just about 9 minutes they were done and in my opinion a bit too done. So if you have a darker pan like I do I very strongly suggest you wait only 7-9 minutes at 375. Otherwise they will be burned to little french crisps.

I am an amateur and found this recipe very easy and useful.  To the previous reviewer who said that they used muffin pans and had a disaster, Im not sure what happened, but I used a muffin pan(with paper liners) and only dolloped 1 heaping tablespoon of batter into each cup. This yielded 2 batches of 12 Madeleine  half-cupcakes which my girlfriend and roommates loved.  Hope this helps

I made these for the first time today and what a hit!  My husband ate most of them which is impressive since he doesn't usually like desserts.  These turned out so soft, spongy and moist. I used my Kitchen aid mixer on super super high speed and made sure I followed the recipe exactly, using the high speed for about 7 minutes. I used the pan which is not non-stick but I buttered it well and floured it and they didn't stick to the pan at all!  Will definitely make these again.

What a fab recipe!! I spent 9 months in Paris and these Madeleines are the real thing! They are just great! When I make them, they are wolfed down within minutes and I get complaints that I don't make enough! I bought the Madeleine pan from Fenwicks, was a pan for 12. The pan is like rubber which is really good, when you want to take the Madeleines out they pop out which I think is a lot easier than using a metal pan! If you are looking for Madeleines, MAKE THESE!!!

Excellent!  Just make sure not to over bake them.  I used the mold for miniature madeleines, and found that in my oven, nine minutes produced the ideal result.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe. The directions were easy to follow to. The only change I made was using only 1/4 tsp. of grated lemon zest, because I always feel the flavor is over-powering in recipes. I didn't know what to expect these to taste like. They kind of remind me of individual yellow cakes dusted with powder sugar. It works for me because I do not care for frosting too much. The recipe makes it seem that the cakes will come out of the pan immedietly. I had to wait about 10 minutes just like other cakes for them to pop out. I used a plastic butter knife to slide around the edges as my pan was non-stick on that part of the directions. I enjoyed trying this new recipe.

This recipe was so easy to make and they came out tasting so delicious! Definitely do NOT skimp on buttering and flouring the pan before pouring the batter in. Also I would bake them at 350 degrees next time and only for 5-6 minutes. I ended up slightly burning my batch because I thought it would take 14-17 minutes.. of course every oven is different, but that much of a time difference?? Make sure to closely monitor them! And madeleines are supposed to be light and spongey… please don't compare Starbucks "pastries" to this recipe; thats why you have to whip the eggs at the beginning until light!

I think this recipe is great! The only thing I would change would be to bake them for less time. I always go with the shorter time suggested on recipes, but 14 minutes was a little too long for these. I would suggest baking them for 12 minutes and letting them cool. Otherwise they get really dry. Other than that, I think my hunt for a madeleine recipe is over!!!

These are Great the recipe is very good, I had an old recipe from a french friend but I lost it. I just want to write that I read a review and it said that Madeleines are not supposed to be light and airy but dense like Starbucks I just want to say that they are WRONG the actual recipe is that they supposed to be light and fluffy and I give 5 stars for you because of that , bravo !!!!

I was disappointed in the final product.  I followed the recipe to the letter and found that resulting madeleines were a bit rubbery and overly lemony.  They weren't unpleasant...just not the delicacy I was expecting from the other reviews.  They were missing the subtlety in texture and flavor of a really good madeleine.  I think that Proust would have only been inspired to write a Harlequin romance after eating this.  I also found that the batter yielded only enough for 10 madeleines.  I thought I'd overfilled, but they ended up coming out at exactly the right size.  Perhaps my "large" eggs were too small.

Love the taste but think they cooked too long at 14 minutes.  Will try again and check at 10 minutes.

this is a great and easy recipe.  i made both the regular & chocolate version...i think that i will reduce the bake time---however, this all depends on your oven---mine was a bit dark when it came out.  also, i followed another suggestion to beat egg mixture for full 10 mins. definitely a yummy recipe, i loved it :)

Fantastic and easy to use recipe. The most important step is quickly mixing the eggs, vanilla, salt and sugar so it's light and fluffy!

This is a great madeleine recipe! Good directions! I used Pam baking spray and it worked nicely. I love that it makes just the right amount for one madeleine pan. I tried both the chocolate and regular varieties and they are both delicious. Delicate and light as madeleines should be.

Good - easy, but a little "eggy".  Will try again with medium sized eggs.  Also did a batch of Green Tea Madeleines - cut the lemon zest to 1 tsp and sifted 1 tsp of maccha into flour.

It makes a nice little cake but it doesn't really have the best elements of a traditional madeleine like a dense, moist crumb or the crisp crust.  It's lighter and fluffier, almost like a sponge cake.  My daughter likes this version a lot because it seems less heavy but if you are like me and you like traditional French pastries in all their buttery, rich glory, you might be disappointed.

I just made these (at 3 in the morning!) and they were really good.  I didn't have any lemons, but I did have lemon juice, so I added about 1/2 teaspoon of the juice (should have added more to get more of lemon flavour, but I like the hinted lemon in my Madeleines).  And my oven hates me, so it baked my cookies a little dark, but the crispy edges go really well with the light and cake-y (?) center.  Yum-mm!

I got inpatient with my batter, and didn't beat it for the full 5 to 10 minutes (it didn't get to the thick and ribbony part) but they still came out great.  I am making these for my family for Christmas, and I think I'll try different flavors (rum, cinnamon, chocolate, orange, and maybe some of them dipped in chocolate?).  I'm so excited to bake more of these!!

Very good recipe. They were fluffy and light (hopefully like the real ones..). There's no need for baking powder - it can spoil the taste. It was 2nd time I baked madeleines. Next time I have to get the 'ribbons'...

These were yummy, but they easily broke the first day.  They seemed to firm up after that.  Maybe I should have cooked them an extra minute.  I'll make these again.

Great recipe! Easy to make but pay attention to the directions--extended beating of the eggs gives great airiness. These are really delicious and easy to make. I did not bother to dust with powdered sugar, they were good enough without the gilding.

These were fantastic!! I didn't have any lemon zest so I used 1/4 tsp lemon extract and they were a definite hit with a finicky crowd.  We now call them "Encore's" cause they're so good you want more! Thanks!

Devastated. I am a seasoned baker and I am utterly dumbfounded as to what went wrong. Thoughts or advice? 

Per the great reviews, I thought I had finally found a fool-proof madeleine recipe because they can be so finicky. The batter smelt amazing! Yet for some reason, at the 14 minute mark, they were burnt all over. David Lebovitz's version freezes the pan before adding the dough... maybe that could have saved these. It's a pity because the batter looked and smelt so promising. Heck, even the burnt cookies look pretty! On to the next one.

Absolutely deliiiiicious!!! This recipe is perfect the way it is. Two tips: everyone's oven is different so watch the oven to make sure you don't over bake. 10 mins was perfect for mine. Once you see the sides start to brown, it's time to take it out of the oven. Also, I beat for a full 10 mins, the longer you beat the lighter your cookies will be. I love this! t was light, it was airy.  I ate the whole batch right out the oven.

Just did the recipe . Posted two photos.  First madeleines, so they turned out pretty good maybe a little bit "dense" for my taste, I was expecting fluffier madeleines. But again these are my firsts.The first batch didn't get the "bump" but then the last batch came out with the "bump" so I was thinking maybe the batter needs to "rest for a couple of minutes, but then I don't know. Needing here some expert advise, by the way I read the some of the reviews before making them. Anyway I am going to try the recipe again some other time.

This recepie was awesome! I've just finished making mines and it tasted delicious. I subsitute the madeleine mold pan for a cupcake pan because I didn't have a madeleine mold pan which works perfectly fine. My family loved it. Some Vanilla bean ice cream and whip cream aside and BAMMM. a perfect combination!

I halved the vanilla, added 2 teaspoons rosewater, and used confectioner's sugar, cake flour, and browned butter. The proportions given by the recipe were perfect, and these changes made it outstanding. I also did not have any problems with sticking to the pan, though I used mini madeleine pans. (This recipe made just over 3 pans of minis, or about 65 tiny madeleines.)

These cookies are absolutely fabulous.  They're really simple to make and taste delicious.  I know it's a bit disappointing that the batch only makes a dozen, but that's for the best since they're best eaten the day they're made.  Not that that's an issue- these cookies will be gone long before the day is over!

I made both the original and the chocolate version. I forgot the butter in the chocolate version and it still came out pretty good. :) Make sure you start w/ a good egg foam or you won't get the nice spongy texture. Delicious... and I finally got to use the madeleine pan I brought back from France!

My 14-year-old daughter and I made these for her French class project.  They were easy to do and tasted great!  However, we made a double batch and the first dozen were light and airy and tasted better than the second dozen because the batter sat until the first batch came out of the oven.  The batter settles too much and makes the cake more dense.  Next time, I would make the batches separate even if it is more work.  Very tasty recipe.  We will make them again for eating at home!

Not my favourite madeleine recipe, but tasty!  Depending on how long you keep them in the oven, they can come out either dense or light and fluffy.

These were delightful and very easy to make. I used a non- stick madeleine pan and followed the directions as given. They baked in about 8 minutes. I am bringing them as refreshments tonight to a program on Monet's Garden - very appropriate. Thank you for the recipe!

THESE are Madeleines. The whole point of baking is to make things authentic...not like at "Starbucks" or store bought. I love madeleines and so I am very critical...this recipe, if followed exactly, is a great recipe for madeleines. Starbucks and others have nothing on authenticity. Pfftt!

Extremely nice recipe, light and fluffy as it should be. I would recommend decreasing the oven temperature to 350 max, though...

This recipe was easy to follow and the madeleines came out light and airy . A number of reviews said that the madeleines tasted eggy so I increased my vanilla to 1 teaspoon.I used silicon moulds and greased and floured them well so the madeleines came out easily. 
So irresistible that I had 3 as soon as they came out of the oven!

Great recipe, but too sweet for my taste. I'd cut back down the sugar to 1/4 cup maybe less. My madeleines came out sorta burned when I did 375 for 14 minutes, I think that's way too hot. I'd use 350 degrees next time for 14 mins. 

It's sorta like a sponge cake cookie but it's a good copy cat Madeleine. Thanks for the recipe.

I was glad this recipe had a video to follow.  I found a madeleine pan at Goodwill, and I knew exactly where to go to find a recipe.  This site! These Madeleines came out fragrant and dense, sort of like a little bite of pound cake.  They tested done with a toothpick at 11 minutes, so I would suggest to check them at around 10 minutes.  They were pale,  but definitely done.  I made them the day before Christmas Eve, and froze them when they were cool, as we were not going to have them till the day after Christmas and I was afraid they would get stale if I left them on the counter for 3 days.  They are great dunked into hot coffee, as the recipe suggests.

This recipe is fantastic! My mother is from France, so she really loves that I can make these homemade- and she thinks they are better than most French ones. I've found two small things that makes these way better-1. Use a small bowl to mix. For some reason it makes the eggs way smoother and the entire recipe is more fluffy. 2. Bake them for only 10-12 minutes. At least with my oven, they got way to crispy for anything more. 
Thanks for a great one!

Great and easy recipe, minimal ingredients and preparation.  Made it for the first time yesterday and they were awesome, but I would shorten the baking time by a little next time since I have a non-stick pan and they looked very brown (not burnt though).

I bought my self a madeleine pan and found this recipe. Yum! Not that much work for such a tasty pay off. The chocolate version rarely lasts long enough  around my kitchen to ice, but they are great with cream cheese icing.

Very nice recipe. I found that when I used my 12 by 3 inch pan it made 18 madeleins. I also removed the zest and added cinnamon instead. Very tasty.

Absolutely scrumptious! I too have a mini pan and tried them at 8 minutes as recommended on the directions.  They came out a little more golden than I have seen before, but my oven's a bit unpredictable so they were baked at slightly higher than 375. However, now that I look again, they do look just as caramel-colored as the photo here.  They were perfectly cooked in any case - just sweet enough, light and soft yet with a scrumptious crunch. AMAZING!

Loved this recipe! I substituted the vanilla extract for orange emulsion and dipped the back of the Madeleine's in chocolate. I hope they turn out well! The recipe doesn't make enough to fill a whole pan, I encountered the same issue as some other's who have reviewed, but I still love they way these are turning out! Thank you!

Mmmmm!I've had a madeleine pan for years, but this is the first time I've used it. My pan is nonstick but I still buttered it. I experimented, coating half the pans with flour, and half with confectioners sugar. It honestly didn't seem to make a difference. Also, I was baking these for a group of picky eaters, so I left out the lemon zest, and increased the vanilla to 1/2 TBSP! These were light, fluffy, and looked amazing!

These madelines turned out perfectly!! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the vanilla extract - I put a full teaspoon of vanilla. I'm a big fan of the Starbucks madelines & was pleased with how similar these are! They were more lemony than Starbucks but a similar density & texture. Loved this recipe.

A dissapointment, a failure and a flop. We hoped to create similar cakes to the ones sold at Starbucks :) but were very unsuccessful. More eggs and butter might improve them. Also, make sure not to bake them for more than 16 min. because they brown quickly.

The recipe was very easy to follow (easier than finding the Madeline pans...Wilton Pro at select BB&Bs). I used eggbeaters instead of eggs, since that was what I had (I very rarely have real eggs on hand.) So, I'm not sure how much that affected the outcome.  I doubled the recipe and came out one short of filling my two trays. The cooking time was shortened to around 12 minutes...which I think may have been too long as they came out pretty dense. They were very eggy smelling and tasting. I think they would be an excellent savory item with a little modification. Other than the eggbeaters, I followed the recipe except for the lemon zest (not a fan of lemon flavoring.)  The Madelines were edible and I would try the recipe again, but maybe with some of my own modifications and the use of real eggs instead of eggbeaters.

Great recipe, but, use almond extract, instead of vanilla, and omit the lemon zest. Had these in France, and that was how they tasted.

This was a delicious recipe with excellent texture. I made the chocolate variant. One thing I did note was that they came out VERY ugly; they didn't hold the shape of the shell mold at all and pretty much just look like flat stones. I'm willing to take the blame for that, though. Pretty or not, these had a slightly crispy shell and the insides were completely light-as-air and melt-in-your mouth. DELICIOUS! It was almost like eating meringue in cake form. Next time I make these I will try to fix the shape and update.

Liked this but I used a hint I saw on the Great British Baking Show that may have heoped. I buttered the madeleine tins and put them in the freezer while making the mixture. Floured them very lightly after removing from freezer, right before filling. Also only baked them for 12 minutes at 375 degrees in my oven and they were perfect. Popped out of pan very easily.

Directions were perfect - was worried that batter was too thin but it all worked out.
One thing: when adding powdered sugar, wait until they cool as sugar will melt and disappear when madeleines are straight out of oven.

The Madeleines got burned around the edges. Also, I left them for 12 minutes and they burned at the bottom as well. I followed every step and I have no idea what happened. Maybe I should try to set up the oven at a different temperatures? Any ideas or suggestions? Thanks

14 minutes was WAY too long w/ my crappy apt oven, but the taste is outstanding. 
will try again w/ varying times and see if that helps.
very easy and straightforward - just disappointed that they didn't cook even! swine oven :)

I must say that I went into the recipe without taking my usual precautions so here are my suggestions: Follow the recipe as stated,if your madeleine mold is of the dark kind,lower the temperature by about 25 degrees less, so bake at 350 instead, watch the baking time and do not bake longer than the 14 minutes. When I made mine, I noticed they came too browned which immediately led me to lower the temperature and watch the cooking timing. I also noticed I had some leftover mix enough for baking 2 more which surprised me as everybody says it only yields 12. After correcting the baking temperature and time, I found out that those 2 that I baked last were much better not too browned nor crispy and a tid bit denser but as my french partner told me: now this is tasting closer to it! My french partner says madeleines are not supposed to be crispy or too brown looking so there is my advice! As an overall, I would say it tasted very good I will just be more careful next time I bake.Certainly will continue adjusting until the dozen comes out nicely soft brown and airy!

Ever since I found this recipe I have been using it and tweaking it to try and perfect it. At first I thought my oven wasn't working properly and I altered the temperature and time. I also removed the lemon zest completely and then reintroduced it at a much lower quantity ( 1/4 tsp). At this point I have made this over a dozen times and while the time and temperature seem accurate (they are golden and have the little mound) at 375 for 9 minutes, they are still incredibly dense and dry. I'm not sure how to avoid this since everything but the lemon zest is in normal quantities and I have altered the beating time from 3 minutes to 5 to 10. They remain a bit dry. My husband and daughter love them but I'd like them to be perfect.

I altered this to be gluten free with very good results. I used 1/4 c. King Arthur gluten free flour and 1/4 c. Almond meal with a pinch of xanthan gum and sifted them together before adding to the batter. I think bringing the eggs to room temp first would help make the batter thicker when beating and be a little quicker.  Baked  for 14 minutes which was just right. The taste was excellent. Now I can have a little cake that is easy to make!  I sprinkled with organic sugar as I wasn't  sure exactly what was meant by granulated sugar, regular or powdered?

As a beginner, this was simple and produced delicious results. I doubled the amount of lemon zest to get a little more lemony flavor, and quite enjoyed it. The "gentle folding" was more like careful stirring in my experience. Made 12 large-ish Madeleines and 6 smaller ones, so there is some extra. Baking time actually took a total of less than 10 minutes in my oven. Be sure to add extra butter to the pan, as my Madeleines were reluctant to leave their indentations. Proustian and yummy.

This was simple and the results are lovely. Next time I'll use the whisk attachment for my mixer though. That will probably make them even lighter. I'll be making these a regular thing at my house now that I have the pans and the recipe. Can't wait to try the chocolate ones!

these were good, BUT they are not Madeleines. Madeleines are supposed to melt in your mouth, buttery.

My daughter and I love the madeleines from Starbucks because of their dense buttery yumminess and I have to say this recipe didn't disappoint after some tweaking to the recipe. I doubled the recipe, added an extra 1/4c butter, omitted the lemon zest and replaced it with 1 t almond extract otherwise I followed the recipe except adjusting bake time to 11 min exactly because I didn't have a Madeleine pan so I used a non-stick mini cupcake sheet that I did butter and flour just to be on the safe side and they came out perfectly and then sprinkled white granulated sugar on them and voilà delicious bite-sized madeleines!!!  They did have a slight eggy smell & taste, however, after they cooled a bit it dissipated. Excited about trying the chocolate version!

Just a suggestion...I have tried two types of pans--the traditional aluminum version and the non-stick. I suggest the non-stick version and reduce cooking temp by 25 degrees. The madeleines stuck in the traditional pan in spite of greasing the "shells." Cakes pop right out of non-stick pans.

I have made Madeleines multiple times, and enjoy trying new recipes now and then.I have only one comment/recomendation... I doubled the recipe and all of them present too much of an egg taste. They are stil rich and buttery, but I believe you need to seperate 1-2 egg yolks in the recipe. So, one wole egg and one yolk for a standard batch and so on and so forth. Thanks!

I love this recipe! It is so easy to make and comes out so good. I just double the recipe as the original doesnt make enough for me. Its best fresh and hot out of the oven, but its good the next day warmed up too. I love the lemon zest and added a little more than the recipe called for. This was super easy and I followed the recipe and overall the time took less than 30min to make from batter to mouth. I used a madeline pan from William Sonoma and just sprayed Pam on the pan and floured just slightly. Had no problem with it sticking. Made it for friends and they thought it was the best madelines they had ever had, better than most restaurants and bakeries even!

I tried a professional chef recipe and this works better!  I used vanilla sugar for added flavor.  These are best hot from the pan, but are still light after they cool.

Well, I just finished eating some of my 1st attempt at this recipe. For the record, I used 1 tsp. of vanilla and only 1/2 tbsp. of lemon zest. Next time I will definitely use more zest or add lemon extract as the flavor is too faint for my taste buds.

I got 18 madeleines out of this recipe. Something to consider for those of you who don't have more than one pan available. The cakes were ready after 12 minutes in my convection oven and the texture was light and spongy. 

I will definitely be trying this recipe again, but with more zest or extract for flavor.

These are amazing! I made them for my husband to take to the office and they loved them! I made both chocolate and almond/dipped in chocolate. I just substituted 3/4 tsp almond for the lemon zest (mixed in at the same time as the vanilla) and they came just right!

I didn't have lemons so I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of lemon extract.  They were very good.  I can only imagine how delicious they will be with real lemon zest.  You do have to watch the oven time.  Mine were done at almost 9 minutes and I used the big size  Madeleine pan.

Simply wonderful! I love the lemon zest it really gave it a burst of flavor. As an inexperienced Madeleine maker this recipe was extremely easy and uncomplicated. I cooked them in a 3" silicone Madeleine mold that made six. This is a recipe worth trying!!!

I really like these Madeleines. I had Madeleines for the first time in France over the summer, and fell in love with them! Mine were not quite as pretty as the ones in the picture, but this is my first attempt at making them. Next time, I may drop the mix into the tin with a melon baller or ice cream scooper. I dressed mine with powdered sugar. They taste divine! Cannot wait to share them with my friends and family.

Wonderful buttery treats. My 2, 6 and 9 year old kids love them. They don't last long around our house.

I've fallen in love with madeleines ever since my favorite coffee shop started to sell them (albeit only on the weekends).  I realized I needed another source so I bought a madeleine pan by chicago metallic ($15).  The chocolate version is AMAZING.  We had to ration how many we could eat per day.  I will try baking an almond version next (1 tsp? of almond extract subbed for zest and vanilla).  We will see how that goes.

Of all the recipes, I chose to try this Madeleine first, based on reviews (though other photos were better).  These are VERY FUN TO MAKE, which is great!  I felt like a fancy-pants.  And they taste wonderful!  I beat the egg-sugar mixture for ages, as was recommended.  Everything else to a 'T'.  Thanks!

So good that we might have to go out and buy a madeleine pan!  Surprisingly easy and quick.  We beat for the full 10 minutes.  It filled 10 muffin cups about half the  amount we would put in for cupcakes or muffins.  SO GOOD!

mine turned out spongy but they taste magnificent. My batter didn't get to a full ripple stage. maybe because I live in humidity. i filled each shell with a cookie scoop. I'm getting up to get my 4th cookie.

The only criticism I have is that it lacked finely ground almonds. If you were going for a non-traditional recipe, please change the name of the recipe from madeleine to butter cake or butter cookie.

I tried it 2x - once I followed the recipe as written, and they came out nearly blackened!! So burned I threw them away.

The second time, I baked them for literally 7 minutes at 375 (half the time at the same temperature), and they came out STILL a little overcooked but overall much better, very light and airy. 

I will 100% make again, but I’ll try baking them at 6 minutes or even 5. Not sure if my oven is just crazily powerful or what... I did it at the recommended temp and everything!

Perfect on the first try!  This receipt is spot on!  After reading reviews, I made a double batch and every single one is beautiful, light and flavorful.  I can't wait to try the chocolate version of this recipe!

The video was a little bit deceiving because in the instructions it says to beat the mixture until ribbons form, but in the video the mixture is beaten until stiff peaks. This made it hard because I didn't really know which to follow, the recipe or the video, but in the end, my madeleines turned out amazing without stiff peaks. Also, the baking time on the recipe is a bit off. I baked my madeleines at 375 for about 11 minutes and they were almost burnt, but still tasted great. I also didn't use the lemon zest because we didn't have it at the time and everyone in my family  wanted madeleines, and it was fine. So overall, I would say that this recipe is great, even though it might need some tweaking.

I'm from Europe and these are as good as any I've had at home. Not sure what that last reviewer is thinking but if your only experience with Madeleines is from Starbucks, all you've tasted is over-processed, chemical laden, frozen then plastic packed cookies. Real madeleines taste like air, and when you dip them into coffee or tea, they take on the flavor of the beverage. Couldn't be happier with this recipe, its excellent.

I made it without lemon zest - but taste was great! My mom said it was nice. Gonna make another batch next time. I need to adjust the temperature as well, it almost burnt before 14mins of baking lol.

They tasted much better than the ones I buy from the local grocer, but were a little tough.  I am not sure whether I should have folded in the butter in more thoroughly.   I will readily admit that they are all gone.  (And, don't tell M.S., but I couldn't find my GOOD vanilla!)

The batter tasted great, but I was using a dark madeline pan I found on Amazon and they were burned badly in the bottoms at 6.5 minutes.  They were tasty on the tops though... My oven was at 375 and I've used it for other recipes without an issue, but I'll have to test to see if it runs hot.

This was my first time making madeleine’s and i was really happy with this easy recipe! A couple tips: the longer you beat the eggs the better!! Obviously don’t go overboard but mine took about 20 minutes to get the “ribbons” and i worried that it was taking too long but it turned out perfect! Also mine got a little too browned so just make sure you watch them when they’re in the oven! Love, love, love this recipe!

This recipe is amazing! It perfectly made 12 delicious madeleines. I zested one small lemon which produced around a teaspoon of zest and the lemon flavor was perfect. I think a tablespoon would make it too strong.

Follow this recipe and you will have some legit madeleines. I varied slightly from the recipe at the end and added a tbsp of lemon juice and poppy seeds. I will definitely use this in the future

This was my first time making madeleines, and they were delicious! The recipe is easy to follow. I love the lemon zest! I did make an adjustment to the bake time;  9 minutes was perfect. The recipe states 12-14 minutes, which is excessively long. It could be  due to the dark pan I used. 

Things I would do differently (next time), I won’t butter the pan. The pan I have is non-stick. The butter left the madeleines a bit sticky. Also, I didn’t add sugar after baking, but maybe next time I’ll dust them with powdered sugar.

These were amazing!  It was my first time making these and I had researched many recipes and decided on this one since it was the most highly rated that I found.  I used a silicone madeleine baking dish (from Sur la Table) and I did spray it with PAM (however it was not needed).  If you have never made it before make sure to beat the mixture until you get the ribbons and to "fold" in the flour, lemon zest and butter as it says.  They were simply divine!!  I will be making these often!

This recipe is super simple and the Madeleines came up fantastic! They were really light and airy and taste delicious. I didn’t have Madeleines pan so I used mini cupcake molds and they turned out really well. I sprinkled some cocoa powder on mine to change it up a bit. Overall I love this recipe! Will definitely be using to make more!

I made both the lemon and chocolate versions. The chocolate was pretty good, but they both seemed to need a little more flavor. Otherwise the texture was nice and fluffy and the recipe was easy to follow. Next time I'll try amping them up a bit.

These were nice and light tiny butter cakes, just like they are supposed to be.   The flavour is very subtle and buttery, and they have a nice crispy crust on the outside.   I omitted the lemon zest as we don't enjoy that flavour.  I'll make these again when I crave Madeleines!

Great recipe, to help get the signature bump on the back of the madeleines since this recipe uses air instead of bicarb to make them fluffy it helps to fill your pan and put it in the freezer for a little while before baking. Overall tasty light madeleines!

I like this recipe very much. However, it does ask for some leavening powder, which I did not see in the ingredients. So I added "levure chimique" to the recipe, as I learned it in my youth. That is what makes it rise!

Thanks!

I make these all the time, however, I have never frozen them to keep them fresh for Christmas.  Would anyone be able to share if they have frozen them prior to serving and how these were, please?  Thank you in advance

Though I personally messed up the baking, and slightly burnt my cookies, all my fault, the cookies still came out great! The zest adds a certain taste that you can really taste, and the cookie itself is very light, and would probably be even better if I had just buttered my pan (myself for not having read that part of the recipe). The only thing I can say is that, with this amount of batter, I came up with about 13-14 cookies, so be prepared to use that sheet twice.

The time to cook is WAY to long. I cooked mine for about 8 mins and that was almost too long. They would be burnt chips at 14 mins so be aware of that. Not sweet enough either. I’ve had oodles of Madeleines in France so know what a good one taste like.

These were amazing! All of you idiots saying madelines are not supposed to be light and airy, these are TRADITIONAL FRENCH MADELINES. Starbucks just sells glorified pound cake. So all the negative reviews you see are fake. :)

I didn’t have lemon zest, so I used lime zest instead. It does not make too much of a difference, it just adds a little tang at the end but it would be good without it too. They taste so much better when eaten the day of. I baked for exactly 14 min and it was perfect timing.

These are so so good. The recipe calls for 1/4 c melted butter but watching the video, it says 1/2 c melted butter. That was confusing. I used 1/2 c butter after looking at some other Madeline recipes. I put my dough in the fridge for an hour or so and it made it very easy to bake. Great with morning coffee. Easy to make

Love this Madeleine recipe! This is the only recipe that I don’t need to reduce the amount of sugar listed.  In my first attempt, because I was tired, I had forgotten to add the butter but they still came out delicious.  The madeleines were light and airy.  My coworkers love them.  I could taste the egg and not the sugar, like all of the store bought madeleines I had.  I did however change a few things in the recipe.  I used cake flour instead of all purpose flour because that what I have in the house.  Also, I did not put lemon zest but instead I put 3/4 teaspoon of dried, ground edible lavender in it.  Last, because I’m watching my sugar intake, I did not dust mine with more sugar after they were baked.  I regretted getting the silicone Madeleine pan because the grooves are too subtle so they taste good but looked so so.  Anyway, this recipe is definitely worth keeping!

These are.....Delicious! The first time I made them I used my hand mixer. Bad call; I was mixing forever. They tasted amazing. My daughters ate them all. The second time, I found my stride. I used my kitchenaid mixer. So much easier. I made a double batch. They looked perfect, and were devoured shortly after they came out of the oven. luckily I was able to set a few aside, for my tea this morning. You will not be disappointed if you try this recipe.

Instead of vanilla extract I used vanilla creamer. 

Also my madaliene shell molds had been put to use for making aluminum ingots so I used a well seasoned cast iron crappie mold instead

Turned out pretty good I think!

I didn't have a lemon for zesting and I ran out of vanilla, but my Madeleine pan had just arrived in the mail. I couldn't resist! I instead added 1 teaspoon of almond extract to the eggs. Everything else I followed with the omission of the vanilla. They came out beautiful and delicious. After I go shopping, I will make the Madeleine cakes true to the recipe and I'm sure they will be awesome.

real easy to make. We didn't have a lemon and I didn't want to go to the store, so we upped the vanilla to a tsp. Turned out great. Lemon zest would've made these perfect.

This is a delicious, light, lemony cookie. My Madeleine pan is dark, so I need to remember to turn the oven temp down 25 degrees and cook them a little longer than the minimum time.

Recipe is very good..  I'd recommend letting the batter rest before spooning out and baking.  My first batch was difficult to get out of pans but the second slid out like butter.  Wonderful recipe..  thanks

14 minutes was too long for my oven and I didn’t adjust it... So the Madelinesa are a bit dry. My fault. I will try it again soon. It was a little eggy And I wanted more lemon zest. I zested 2 Lemons. Not a lot of lemon flavor.  I was tempted to add lemon juice but I really thought the Madelines would be screwed up.  I didn’t make any changes except for what was in the recipe.  I used a non-stick pan with spray. There was no problems with Sticking. Madelines.  I used a stand mixer. I screwed up the first batch just because I didn’t read. If I get the taste and texture right, then I will double the batch. One batch accommodated one Madeline pan.  I will make it again.

I love em! However, recipe only made 8 and a quarter, (I must have a big pan), so I baked them and some burnt at the top. Then, I made another batch, adding a quarter to everything, (and just another egg), the batch made more and ended up making 18 more! The last batch turned out the best, because each time I lowered the time. It ended up only taking 10 minutes for the last batch to be perfect. Otherwise, lovely!

This was my first time making madeleines and they were delicious.  I added a tablespoon of lavender flowers rather than the lemon zest.  My only disappointment was how brown they got.  I cooked them for only 15 minutes, checking them before that.  I suspect it was the dark pan (my first time using it) as they browned too much on the bottom before they looked done on the top.

I've made these twice in a 24 hour period. The first time they came out a little too dark but it's because the pan is really dark, BTW I bought my pan on Amazon, and I thought the lemon zest was too much. But they were still really easy to make and tasted awesome. My teenager daughter and her friends ate half on them. The second time I put just a little bit of lemon zest and baked two minutes less and they're perfect. They're not overly sweet which I like. This will definitely be one of my go-to recipes.

I'll have to try this again. First time making Madeleines and they burned on the edges and brown on the shell side. Top side had the correct color excluding the edges. The recipe wasn't light and airy but dense. I made Emeril's Madelines the same day and those were lighter. Will remake sometime later to see if I get the same results.

This turned out really great, but I noticed that it won't have the appearance of a madeleine unless you add more butter and wait for the bubbles to burst a little. Otherwise, it's a great recipe.

I loved making these! I loved to butter my baking pan and get everything together. I made them the way the recipe called for but one thing I would change is to get very good vanilla. I only had imitation vanilla and it did not do it justice. These are so light and fluffy my coworkers loved them! Just make sure to leave them out in an airy space because I put them in a Tupperware when they were warm and they got a little soggy

Absolutely amazing! I followed the recipe exactly (except I substituted lemon juice for the lemon zest) and they came out so, so perfect! You definitely need an electric hand mixer so that you can whip the batter so it's light and smooth. They turned out light and buttery and so perfect. My daughter's name is Madeline and I will make these to serve at her birthday party in a few weeks!!

These are great and easy. I actually in a hurry and  misread the recipe. I mixed the butter and sugar as one would for cookies instead of melting it. They turned out just fine.

Super easy to make. I made my 1st batch with gluten free flour and baked for 15minutes. They were a little darker than I'd hoped but I put that down to the different flour. They still look and smell great. ??

I have now made this recipe twice, once as listed, and just now with the chocolate variation. Both are fantastic! With a little preparation I am able to get my 2 and 3 year old to make them with me!

Fluffy, light, easy. Refrigerate even just ten minutes before baking and you'll get the coveted "hump". Thanks for this fantastic recipe!

Delicious! I had not had a Madeleine before I made them but they will be regulars here now! The recipe was easy easy to follow and they came out perfectly compared to the photos. I did clarify the butter first because I read that elsewhere. Delicious!!

Had a bit of a strong eggy aftertaste. It might be because I'm a complete beginner in this and don't have a mixer so everything I hand mixed. 

Also used a muffin pan and was totally fine, just don't completely fill up the cups.

Beautiful madeleines. Cut baking time to 9-10 minutes if using dark pans, or they will be overdone. I made my first batch following the recipe exactly, and they were dark and a bit tough, and a bit too lemony (my husband thought they were lemon flavored). I baked a double batch today, swapped out the lemon zest with a few teaspoons of orange juice and reduced the baking time, and they are perfect! Tender and buttery.

These were awesome. So warm and the lemon zest smells lovely. Note: don't fill the mold all the way or else they will be too fat. 
Also, dip in hot herbal fruit tea for maximum enjoyment.

Made these, they tasted amazing! Instructions were easy to follow. I played with a few variations: I subbed the lemon zest for lemon oil (few drops), butterscotch flavor, and also left them plain (no flavoring) - all tasted great and relatively similar. First time I cooked for 14 minutes and cakes came out too brown, so next time I stuck to 13 minutes (I have one of the larger sized madeleine molds). The only problem was unsticking them and trust me I tried everything - butter and flour, butter and flour heavily caked on (no pun intended), only butter, and nothing. All times they weren't quite perfect but butter and flour of decent amount worked best. Still had to pry cakes out with a knife. My tray was a light aluminum color, I might try a silicone one or dark non-stick to improve this issue. Be sure to store in a container within a few minutes of cooling as the outer side of the cake will harden quickly.

So tasty and fluffy, how I remember proper Madeleine cookies from my coffee shop days and so rarely can find them like this today. I have had a Madeleine pan from my boyfriend's mom for so long and am happy to have finally put it to use. The recipe is so easy to follow too.

Les Madeleines, along with tarte aux pommes  were among the 1st attempt to making French sweets for me as a teenager.
I probably made hundreds of Madeleines  so far, using different recipes. And I know, that Madeleines usually have a dense texture, but I really like the soft, fluffy kind that this recipe produces. I prefer to sprinkle them with some powdered sugar after they are completely cooled down.

These came out light and fluffy but stuck to the pan a lot even after greasing the pan.   Came out perfect at the 15 minute mark.  Didn't look so great (will do a much more thorough job of greasing the pan next time!!!!), but they were delicious and light and airy!

My madeleines turned out really bad. Not sure what I did wrong because I followed the instructions. The baking time said 14-17 minutes at 375*F and this is WAY too high. My madeleines got burnt and I took them out at exactly 15 minutes.. They were too brown & became dry. If I were to try this recipe again, I will probably do 350*F and take them out at 10 minutes.

These turned out perfect, made it twice already! I tried 2 other recipes before I got to this one and they all didn't taste like a true Madeleine until I tried this recipe. The only thing I didn't have on hand was the lemon. The only thing I would change is the temperature and time, I set my oven on 400 degrees and they are only in there for 6-7 minutes.  Also, I got my Madeleine pan on Amazon, it was only 10 dollars with prime.  This recipe is worth making, believe me!

These are delicious! I took off one star because I had some issues with browning/burning...I had to turn my oven way down and reduce the baking time. One other note- I made a double batch due to another reviewer saying she barely got any madeleines out of the recipe...this was the wrong move! I got at least 30 cookies, which is too many unless you have a lot of friends to share with. They don't keep for more than a day or two. Only make what you need that day!

Super easy and delicious! The  crispy outside and sponge inside is perfection. I should have kept an eye on them in the oven though.  14 minutes at 375 was about one minute too long.  I wasn't sure if you're supposed to fill the pan molds or fill 3/4 like muffins. I opted for filling  them and they're perfect. Next time I will double this recipe because I can't seem to stop eating them.

loved the flavor I never made Madeline's with lemon zest before! Great twist and the process in making these was a lot simpler then the previous recipe.

Excellent and accurate. This recipe turned out exactly 12 cakes and was very tasty. Will totally be making them again.

Very good! I just used vanilla and left out the lemon. Then I dusted with powdered sugar while they were still hot.

My 5-year-old daughter and I made these tonight -- and between us, she probably has more skills in the kitchen! Needless to say, they turned out WONDERFULLY!! Perfect taste and texture. I only needed to cook mine for about 9 minutes and they were done. I guess that's ovens for you. But super easy peasy -- and 10 times BETTER than the Starbucks ones! :D

They tasted ok. I usually buy the madeleines at Costco and wanted to make some like those since they are pricey to buy at the store. I got a madeleine pan from Macy's and tried out this recipe. They were a lot lighter and cake like than the ones I got at Costco, I like the thicker rich moist center with crispy outside. I guess I will have to tweak the recipe a little bit. Also in my oven I think the temp. was a little too high and time a little too short. I know this can be different with different types of ovens.

Terrific recipe!  The only thing that I changed was cutting back on the butter a little, and I dipped the finished cookies in melted milk chocolate.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a good recipe.  Very delicious.   Used caster (superfine) sugar instead of regular sugar but next time I will just use the regular sugar.  It may have been a little too sweet.

These cookies taste fantastic however the cooking time needs to be reduced if done at 375. The first time I made them, I baked at the directed time and the cookies came out burned to a crisp! The second time, I reduced to 350 and baked for 10 minutes. The cookies turned out much better that 2nd time and still with the perfect little lump on the back!

I am so bad at baking. But this recipe was perfect. I like my madeleines sweet so I added 1/2c instead of the 1/3c asked for. They turned out so good and soft and yummy.  thank you so much.
