The cakes came out great, but no one really liked the filling. The texture was perfect, but it was missing flavor. Followed recipe exactly.   Might try this, but with different filling recipe.

I had a similar recipe years ago that i got from an old Pennsylvania Dutch cookbook but had lost it, much to my disappointment. I never liked the whoopie pies with the marshmallow cream filling because it was always way too sweet, so i'm really happy to find this recipe.  Thanks!

Cakes were great!! Didn't care for the filling much. If you do decide to make this filling, I would suggest dividing it in half. Makes way too much, even with being generous.

The cakes were good, but the icing recipe was off. I agree with other reviewers that there was an excess of bland flavored icing. I tweaked it and the result was delicious...essentially I would follow the recipe but change the icing proportions as follows:
1 cup milk
3 tablespoons of all-purpose flour
3/4 cups vegetable shortening
3/4 cups butter
2 cups white sugar
1 Tablespoon of vanilla (or almond) extract

These are delicious, the only drawback for me was the richness of the filling. I really piled it on the cakes, and it was just too much. I will definately put less filling next time. I also used a tip from another whoopie recipe and wrapped each one in plastic wrap, then refrigerated them. They are good straight from the fridge.

Thought the cake was ok not the best, I had trouble with the frosting and didn't end up making it instead I put vanilla Icecream in the center 

I would recommend you to add melted chocolate o top if u are using Icecream as the chocolate whoppie pie tastes a little bland with out it

Also if it is  hard to make perfect cirles for the pies so I just spread it out in an even layer on a greased cookie sheet and then cut squares ( could also cut into circles)

Filling was a total flop, but the cakes were really good. The filling was one of the most disappointing (and time consuming) of my baking endeavors. Will use my grandmothers recipe next time for the filling, but might stick with this recipe for the cakes. I definitely learned from this recipe though!

JUST like my family recipe for the filling! I, however, beat this for 20+ minutes and it fluffs.  Also added a bit of vanilla... 
I cheat and make the cakes themselves with cake mix - using 3/4c (or less) of water instead of 1 1/4c. cake mix *with pudding* gets sticky so avoid that kind.  
Use ice cream scoop to keep consistent sized cookies regardless of recipe used.

This is the best tasting whoppie pie I have ever made and eaten.  You will not be disappointed if you decide to make this for your family.  The recipe does not say to refrigerate after making but I leaned on the side of caution and will keep them cool since it is a milk base.  The cooler temps do not affect the pie at all if you give it 5 minutes to warm up a little before eating.

I did like this recipe.  Although, despite it made a lot of icing.  Speaking of icing,   I must say this icing is smooth.  However I had to make some adjustments to it,  for it was a little bland.   As experience rules,  I used powdered sugar instead of regular granulated sugar,  much fluffier and smoother.  As far as the cake goes it was fine.

Cakes were ok but flavor was a little lacking. After reading reviews I just used canned frosting which worked great.

These were good!  The cakes were kind of dry, but I suspsect that was because I replaced half the shortening with butter.  Will be making these again
