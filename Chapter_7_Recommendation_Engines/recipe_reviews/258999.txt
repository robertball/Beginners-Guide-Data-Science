I'm not sure how to rate this because mine leaked out all the butter and honey from underneath the rounder.    It would have been good because I used all good ingredients, and I was as careful as I could be to make sure all seams were firmly in place.  I guess if I were to rate how it looked, I'd say it was a 5, but the taste?  Your guess.  Sorry so very much to the contributor of this recipe!
