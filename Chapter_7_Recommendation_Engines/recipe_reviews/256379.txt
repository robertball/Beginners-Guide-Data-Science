I enjoyed this. It's especially good for those who don't want dairy or almond milk. Cacao powder never seems as strong as cocoa powder, but the butter and MCT oil help to make it a little richer.

Not bad.  I think next time I'll use a vanilla protein powder like Syntha-6's Vanilla Ice Cream (the best kind I've found).  Without something like that, this is too watery and oily.  I think the vanilla protein powder will act as a good emulsifier to make it creamier, like real cocoa.

I liked this well enough. It doesnâ€™t have body like a milk based hot chocolate, but it is tasty. I added an extra tbsp of cocoa. Thank you for the recipe.
