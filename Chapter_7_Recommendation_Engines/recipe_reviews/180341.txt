This was very good - unfortunately flat irons are not available in my area but my butcher recommended sirloin steak instead.  Everyone, even the kids, loved it.  We will be enjoying this one again.  Thanks!

Anyone who likes steak is sure to love this.   I made a bunch of them.  Some I used Mozzerella but I ran short on that and put Bleu Cheese on the others.  The result was KILLER.  The Bleu cheese and balsamic made a great combo.  Either cheese was great, but if you like sharp, try some bleu cheese you will not be disapointed!

One word, awesome!....my local grocery store was out of flat iron steaks so I used skirt...only thing I did different was I added a healthy amount of salt and pepper to the sliced tomato and avocado...I also added some purple onion...instead of waiting to the end to drizzle with balsamic, i added about 3 cap fulls to the oil when cooking the meat...wife loved it, will definitely make again...if using skirt steak, make sure to cook quickly over high heat and always cut against the grain...enjoy!

It was really delicious. I added a little salt to the avocado, but other than that it was amazing!

Giving this recipe 2-* is a high rating. These "sammies" simply lack flavor even with the balsamic vinegar, using leftover marinated flank steak from the previous day and sprinkling a sm.amt. of salt to the filling.  Another issue was having most of the filling falling out when trying to eat the sandwich. Perhaps wrapping the sandwich in foil and heating the fresh mozzarella would go a long way to keeping the ingredients together.  Using arugula in place of the spinach which has a slight peppery bite may enhance the otherwise lacking in flavor of the sandwich.  To sum it up, the original preparation left me "under-whelmed".

good concept but flat iron steaks, unless they are marinated are not tender enough for this sandwich.  not a lot of flavor either.  My husband and I found this bland and will not be making again.

Yum!!!!  I seasoned the steak with salt and pepper before searingg and then sliced it thin for the sandwiches...  I also used lettuce and roasted red peppers in lieu of the tomato and avocado and slapped a little mayo on the bread!  Delicious!

These were excellent.  My whole family enjoyed them.  Flat Iron Steak is a perfect steak for these sandwiches.

Was told by my grocer that most stores can't get flat iron cuts because the resturants buy them up so fast.  So I just bought the thinnest cut I could find.

All the flavors of this recipie worked well together, however in order for it to work you need to puchase your flat iron stakes extreemly thin otherwise they are too tough to eat.  I bought two different packages, one cut a little thicker then the other and there was a huge noticable difference.
