Excellent use for leftover cottage cheese, but definitely not worth actually buying cottage cheese to make them.  NOT very chocolately at all.  They need something - maybe cinnamon, granulated coffee, chocolate chips... something to give them more flavor.  Everyone who has tasted them so far has tried to be polite about the flavor... These are by far one of the worst cookies I've made in a while, could ruin my reputation as a good cookie baker - and I still have 2 more batches to make out of this dough that is supposed to make 72 cookies!

I've been reading the reviews for this and I don't understand why most people don't like how they turn out.  I've been making these for close to 20 years, they are a family favorite and everybody else that tries them asks for the recipe.  As for flattening them out, they are supposed to be cake like in the way they rise.  And when it comes to rolling them in powdered sugar, you need to make sure there is a deep enough dish of it to coat them really good.  It doesn't soak into the cookies then.  I just made a double of these this last weekend and shared them with all my friends in my apartment building and they wanted more.  I'm sorry some of you didn't like them.  One other thing, since I don't like nuts and my daughter-in-law- is allergic to them, I never add them.  The cottage cheese in them feels like a soft nut anyway once they are baked.

Great receipe for leftover cottage cheese. Tastes like chocolate cake.  I made a 1/2 recipe and added 1 cup mini chocolate chips (equal amount to pecans).  This was a huge improvement on the recipe.

Stay really moist. I shipped some 2 weeks later to daughter and son-in-law (he hates cottage cheese) and they loved them!! I substituted slivered almonds for pecans. Really good!!!

I give five stars to my modified version. I doubled the amount of cocoa powder and the chocolateness was perfect. I was out of vanilla and used a 1/4 tsp of almond extract instead. Also, I added about 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper, which gave them just a touch of spice...reminded me of a red hot. Because the recipe made so many cookies I cut the recipe to a quarter. I recommend flattening the dough balls on the pan, as they did not spread at all once cooked. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening. These were very very moist and tasted just like a brownie. I found the powdered sugar step to be pointless, as the sugar gets absorbed into the dough and makes the cookies look grey. Next time I'll dust with powdered sugar after removing from oven. Good use for extra cottage cheese. Oh yeah, I used low-fat and it tasted great!

Made em once. They were okay. Everyone ate them and enjoyed them for the moment. It might have just been us because the ingredients make me think this is a really awesome cookie just looking for the right home to impress.

I very much liked these but had to take off one star because I did not feel these were very "cookieish". Like another reviewer commented, these were more like Brownies than cookies. Flavor was excellent, texture smooth and moist.  Next time I make these I will probably use a mini muffin pan.  I think they will turn out just like 2 bite brownies, Yumm!!

One of those "I'll eat them, but won't make them again" camp.  Taste was fine but they were an utter mess to make.  After 3 hours in fridge they were still soupy.  I mixed in about 1/2 cup more flour into the half batch (which made a ton) and put them back in the fridge overnight.  They were still sticky and hard to work with but did set up into a nice cakelike cookie.

I have been making these for years.  When I first tried these, I wasn't told that they had cottage cheese in them because they knew I didn't like cottage cheese.  But you don't even taste the cottage cheese, it just taste like a chocolate soft cookie. I use the small curds.  Top them off with cream cheese icing....mmmmm good

Almost like mini brownies.  They remind me of Chocolate Crackles, but soft and chewy.

Not very sweet but excellent with coffee.  Adults raved over these.  I omitted the pecans but I'm thinking maybe adding raisins the next time.  You really have to mix the batter good, and you will know because it will have a very moist dark chocolate look.

This was a hard one to rate. At first it seemed pretty tasteless when warm and I would have given them a 3 stars but I am thankful I put them in the fridge for the night because they are much better cold.  Texture was a little off for me.

This cookie is more cake-y than crisp. I rolled it in "sparkling" sugar sprinkles rather than powdered sugar which made it quite a bit more pretty. I agree that it could benefit from a little something extra....the addition of choc chips or maybe even a teeny pinch of expresso powder could be interesting so I may try that next time.

We love these cookies, although I've never included the confectioner's sugar. Unfortunately, when I was copying the recipe into my recipe book, I inadvertently omitted one of the ingredients. I'm so thankful I came across it here. Hallelujah! I can now start making them again. Thank you.

I also altered the original recipe. I did not have any pecans so I substituted walnuts, butterscotch chips and choc. chips using more then the 1 cup total required for pecans. (About 1/2 cup to 2/3 cup of each. I did not roll them into balls, I used my cookie scoop I did not flatten them I left them as balls but no powdered sugar. They family liked them but it's not a love thus the 4 stars and not the 5. Dough is very hard to mix so the 20 min prep was longer for me since I had to do the mixing by hand. My hand mixer would not work in the thick dough. If you have the stand mixer and dough hooks it may take the 20 minute prep time.
