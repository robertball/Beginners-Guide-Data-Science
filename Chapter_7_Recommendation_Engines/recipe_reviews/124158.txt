This is the first time I have felt the need to rate a recipe because this one is AWESOME!  I used old-fashioned (not quick) oats and substituted two tablespoons of honey plus two tablespoon of maple syrup for the sugar.  I also added a large apple, finely chopped.  Yum!!  I am going to try it again with two apples. This is going to be a regular breakfast at my house.

I use half a mashed up banana in place of the egg.  It works great and, I think, makes this recipe taste even better.

These are THE BEST!  I've tried several oat bar recipes in the past, trying to find the right one, and I think I've found it.  I've made these twice, the first time with dried cranberries pre-soaked in OJ, then the second time with fresh strawberries.  While the strawberry taste was great, these were a little too moist with fresh fruit, but with the cranberries they turned out PERFECT! I subbed applesauce for oil both times, and doubled the recipe to bake in a 9x13 pan.  DELISH!

The something different for breakfast I was looking for. I never had baked oatmeal and would describe this as a soft delicate oatmeal cookie that is cakeylike. I used buttermilk and only 1/8 c. raw sugar and the taste was wonderful, so much better than oatmeal made the traditional way. Since so many reviews stated they were crumbley I baked until just set and that was at 20 minutes for me. I would say they are delicate as oppossed to crumbley and I have no problem cutting mine into bars when they are cooled and they cut even better when the leftovers are refridgerated. They are delicious warm or cold and the recipe can be altered to taste and preference such as applesauce for oil, egg whites for whole egg, buttermilk for milk, brown sugar for part or all of white sugar ... you get the idea. You can eat as a bar or broken up in a bowl with milk. Either way a winner! and a great snack too.

I am from Amish country and this recipe needs a little revising. First of all, the oats should NOT be quick-cooking, but can be used in a pinch. Definitely increase the oats to 1 3/4 cups, use only brown sugar (not white), add 1/2 tsp. vanilla and a dash of nutmeg.  After mixing, allow to set a few minutes so that the oats can absorb some of the liquid, then pour in baking dish.  The nuts and raisins are optional.  This is fabulous plain, but ,you can add raisins, grated apple, dried cranberries, chopped or sliced nuts, etc.  This is so good you will want to double the recipe and use a 9x13 dish.  Serve hot with a little milk (or a lot) poured over squares.  Can be made ahead of time.  Put individual portions in baggies and freeze.

These were delicious. I will be making them again. My daughters and my husband all loved them. They are an easy quick breakfast that you can take with you. The only thing I changed was using applesauce instead of oil. Thanks for the recipe.

Wow! And I mean Wow! this recipe is just fantastic. I am almost 15 and love to cook. This recipe was more like a cake, but not too fluffy like, I doubled the recipe because it really doesnt make much, also, I substituted water for milk because I am intolerant to dairy products. This is really good with pure maple syrup drizzled on it. Enjoy and God bless!
I also used pure fructose in place of sugar

This was tasty, sort of like an oatmeal-based coffee cake.  I prefer the overnight recipes (ie, Baked Oatmeal I) because, since you mix them up the night before, all you have to do in the morning is throw them in the oven.  This one would take longer, and I'm hungry when I get up in the morning!  But it does turn out quite well and makes a lovely dish that I would probably bring to a brunch potluck.

variations: I discovered midway through that I was out of nuts, so I used dried apple instead.  It worked fine; my guess would be that you can use any combination of dried fruit and/or nuts.  I also used a bit more cinnamon.

We loved this. I don't even like oatmeal, and I liked this. I was inspired to make this because an earlier reviewer used buttermilk (which I need to use up) and because she described it as tasting like a cakey oatmeal cookie. That is 100% accurate. Those of you who downrated the recipe because it isn't a hand-held bar (IE granola bar) are doing the recipe a disservice. Granola bars are held in the hand; bar cookies which contain flour are also held in the hand; this is oatmeal cobbled together with some wet ingredients, sliced into quarters and served with a spatula, and eaten with a spoon or fork. The only drawback to this recipe is it lacks published nutrition information, which is of course easily remedied. Thanks for the recipe, I know this will become a weekend favorite!

Very tasty. It looked like too many wet ingred to me so I used less milk, a little EVOO & applesauce. I only used 1/4 c brown sugar & lots of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice & cloves. Thanks!

I was surprised by how good the results were with this! Usually, my attempts at baking oatmeal dishes end up bland and boring, but this had lots of flavor--especially with the peanut butter I added to the top. I might add some wheat germ next time to the mix. I took some suggestions and did 1/4 of white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar, because I like baking with brown sugar. It was almost too sweet for me (as a breakfast dish), so I might alter the sugar next time also. Great recipe, thanks!

Oh my! This is WONDERFUL.  I changed it around, using applesauce in place of oil and using half brown sugar, half white, used half mashed banana and half egg, and half fresh ground nutmet and cinnamon,  and put in dried cranberries and apples (my son is allergic to nuts).  Holy Cow, what a hit!  Even my youngest (10 months old) says Mmmmmmmm when she eats it.  I put it into muffin trays instead of an 8-in pan and only cooked them for around 18 minutes.  They turned out beautifully AND I didn't have to cut out bars.  My husband likes them because he can eat them on the way to work.  Can't say enough about this recipe.  Its very versatile and a good healthy breakfast or snack.

I have made this recipe many times now as it's good and very convenient for a quick breakfast or snack choice. By using buttermilk and leaving out the oil, I find this is not as delicate and holds together better. I bake it in muffins tins (yield 8 with 1/4 cup batter per cup) for 20 minutes. These freeze well. I sometimes bake a double batch and toss in the freezer to have on hand for an extra quick breakfast - great alternative if you don't have time to bake it fresh in the morning. This recipe is very flavorful, with just the right amount of sweetness. Kid friendly, too. It's a keeper.

I think the trick to these not falling apart might be to press them firmly in your pan, letting them sit in the oven another 5 minutes (turned off) then waiting until they are cooled to cut. I had no problem with mine falling apart and this is all I did different besides eliminating the sugar for stevia.

This was pretty good.  Even the picky 6 year old liked it.  I plumped the raisins in hot water before adding to the mix.  This was the only deterrent to following this recipe exactly. I dinged this a star because of it being slightly crumbly, and that surprised me since I plumped the raisins and added a small amount of additional liquid as a result of doing that.  I would imagine this would be even crumbly-er if I hadn't done this.  Other than this slight imperfection, this is a keeper of a recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

This is exactly what I was looking for, a tasty portable version of oatmeal that's just as healthy. I made a couple changes: applesauce for oil, 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1/2 white, and all raisins (no nuts). Turned out great! And so easy! yay

It didn't turn out to be "bars" at all.  I'm an accomplished baker-all my ingredients were measured correctly-it was baked for the proper amount of time-and it turned out badly.  Besides the fact it was crumbly, the taste was bland.  Sorry.

I love this Recipe! I make it every 4 days for my husbands breakfast i double the recipe leaving out raisins and nuts, instead using a chopped apple. i bake it in an 8 by 8 greased pan and when it cools cut it in 4 large squares that my husband warms up every morning and pours milk over it for a quick delicious and healthy breakfast. Thanx a bunch!

This is a great recipe in which you can throw together within minutes. The only thing I did was omit the oil and added 1/4 cup of applesauce instead. Great for a quick breakfast on the go!

Flour is needed to hold these squares together! I made these twice & they didn't hold together. Then I added 2 tbsp flour & they held together. I also made a few other changes based on my taste. I toasted the oats first on the stove in 2 tbsp butter. it brings out their flavor. Then added only an additional 2 tbsp oil. I used 1 tsp cinnamon & brown sugar instead of white. For milk I used the new Silk brand coconut milk and shredded coconut instead of nuts. It was outstanding!!!

I used a small banana instead of the oil and used a mini muffin pan.  They taste great and are firm enough to eat without a fork.  Will be a healthy snack to bring to work this week.

This was REALLY good!  I told my 3 year old that it was oatmeal cake and wouldn't you know, she loved it! :)  I did at 1/2 tsp of cloves and I really like it, although it may be a bit too sophisticated of a taste for my kids.  I also subbed 1/2 c of applesauce for the 1/4 c of oil.  Yummy.  Thanks so much for this recipe!!!!

We loved these- my 2 year old just ate 1/4 of the pan, as did my DH, who has always said he hates oatmeal!  He even knew it was in there!  The only things I changed was to add a finely chopped apple, increase cinnamon to 1 teaspoon, and cut the sugar to 1/3 cup.  Wonderful- they're going into our breakfast rotation once a week!

These are wonderful.  I don't like traditionally cooked oatmeal for breakfast, so was thrilled to find this recipe.  I borrowed a bit from another recipe and used brown sugar,  1/8 c  vegetable oil with 1/8 c melted butter.  (Although I think they TASTE better when using all melted butter). Increased the cinnamon to two teaspoons.  The raisins and walnuts to 3/4 cups each.  Also added one teaspoon vanilla.  
To prevent being too dry  I only baked for 13 minutes & they turned out great.
Update: I tried adding 1/4 c whole wheat flour as someone suggested & thought they did NOT taste as good.

My kids went crazy over this! However it was quite crumbly instead of coming out in squares. More then likely my own fault though. I followed the recipe, but I did double it and maybe it just didn't bake long enough to set right. Only thing I may change in the future would be to add more spices like nutmeg, cloves, or apple pie spice.

I loved this recipe! Like many others, I used applesauce instead of oil, and I upped the oats to 1 and 3/4 cups, used 1/2 cup plus an extra splash of rice milk instead of dairy milk, coconut sugar (tastes like brown sugar), roasted almonds and upped the cinnamon to about 1tsp. Instead of an egg I used 1 tbsp flaxseed meal soaked in 3 tbsp water.  Once baked I let the bars cool in the baking pan for 10 minutes, then flipped out the bars onto a cooling rack and covered them with a melted milk chocolate Ritters bar. I sprinkled them with chopped almonds and walnuts, coconut flakes, a sprinkle of sea salt and a sprinkle of course 'glitter' sugar that I usually use on cupcakes. Then I let them cool in the fridge. The result - AMAZING!!!! I found that they held together perfectly as bars and the taste was crazy good.

This is a great recipe that you can tweek depending on ingredients you have on hand! For instance, I used applesauce instead of oil, added an extra egg, threw in some yogurt that was a little "past due" that I didn't want to waste, added more oatmeal to compensate for the extra moistness. I also ground up almonds to disguise them, instead of chopped nuts. They turned out fantastic-----time to make more.

The result was tasty.  But the ingredients didn't hold together properly in the pan, and the result was a very dry, crumbly mess.  Admittedly I was trying a double batch because all I had was a 4.5 qt pan, but there's no reason doubling the proportions wouldn't work with this recipe.  I'll try it again, but with more liquid next time.  The good news is, the dry crumbly mix tasted great when it was 3 days old and had milk poured over it. :)

Those that ate these liked them a lot.  But they were passed by by most people at the breakfast buffet.  I made them in muffin cups.  Though they weren't beautiful, they were good and healthy and I'd make them again.  Kids like them with vanilla yogurt on top.

Not a great recipe.  Too crumbly, have to eat with a fork.  Taste is okay.  I probably won't make these again.  We were disappointed.

I love it!t my hubby loves it! and best of all my 3 kids love it!  It's a keeper.  I make in cupcake tins, use a little less white sugar than it calls for.  I also cooked for a little longer which seemed to help them not fall apart.

Very good!!  I did swap the oil and used the same amount of unsweetened applesauce with great results.  I also used cranberries instead of raisins and left out the nuts in case I sent these to school with any of my boys (nut free school).  Really enjoyed these squares, nice and hearty, came together in a snap!

I like the simplicity of the recipe. After reading several reviews I made the following modifications: applesauce instead of oil, 3/4 cup honey instead of sugar, added 1 small chopped up apple, and 1 T ground flaxseed. I also added 1/3 cup whole wheat flour. I was concerned about the moisture content. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan. The texture and firmness was excellent. Next time I would add more cinnamon and a dried fruit (cherries or cranberries).

Very tasty! Very yummy, and soft! I added 3tbsp of flour in the hopes that they wouldnt fall apart, too badly. I also let them sit in the oven for a couple minustes (oven off). then let them completely cool before i cut them! Great snack to take on the go! I plan on freezing some and taking them as snacks when the family is out and about!

Not sure what happened, but  it never help together.  I ended up crumbling it up and making granola.  Still tasty, but I would have rather had bars.

I doubled this recipe and baked in a 9x13 glass pan.  It took 45 minutes in my oven to bake through!  Also - I used dates instead of raisins and added 1/3 cup flour - because I thought the mix looked too liquid.  I was right - the flour added just the right consistency - not crumbly at all!!!!  It is supposed to be around 26 degrees for the next three nights here - so this will make a nice evening dessert (topped with a little vanilla ice cream, of course!!).  Will use this again - many thanks!!!

Like everyone else seems to do, I made a few changes of my own, and it was scrumptious!  I substituted applesauce for the oil, used 1/4 C. Splenda brown sugar blend, 2 T honey, 1 t. vanilla, and 3/4 t. imitation maple flavor. Also amped up the amount of cinnamon and raisins. I covered my pan with foil as it cooled to seal in the moisture.  It cut and served nicely when I was ready to serve.  Awesome "cakey" alternative to oatmeal.

These turned out really yummy and I especially liked the short cooking time compared to other baked oatmeal recipes.  I used applesauce instead of oil, 1/4 C brown sugar, 1/4 C white sugar, and added one apple cut up, also a touch of nutmeg.  I mixed it up the night before and just poured it into the pan in the morning and popped it into the oven.  Healthy, tasty, and quick, what more could you ask for.

Theese were amazing! I took the advise of others and added the applesauce instead of oil, and put in fresh grated apple and bananna my kids loved them. This was fast and cheep to make, and you can add all kids of stuff to make them taste different every time. I doubled the recipe the secont time:)

My family raved about this, which I used both as a healthier dessert and sweet breakfast. I ended up substituting applesauce for the oil too. Also, I wanted things fluffy, so I used 1 1/3 c. of oats and 1/3 c. of flour. Thanks!

What did I do wrong? The cooked mixture never set up to become bars.  It was all crumbly and fell apart. Is there some adjustment for high altitude?

These bars were moist, flavorful and fantastic!  I can see endless variations to this basic recipe!  I did make a few changes--I doubled it, replaced half of the sugar with brown sugar and replaced half of the milk with buttermilk.  I reduced vegetable oil by half and added a little more milk.  I also grabbed the pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon but it was a good mistake.  We topped with maple syrup and the kids had peanut butter on top.  Excellent!

Very good bars.  I did use old fashioned oats and let them soak up some of the milk before baking.  I will try some chopped apple the next time..

Excellent Recipe!!! So easy to whip up on a Sunday morning.  My hubby (who doesn't like a sweet breakfast) said it was good, and my daughter loved it too.  Will make a larger batch next time to take to Sunday School and share.

I made this with honey instead of sugar, and soy milk instead of cow's milk.  I used a 9" pie pan to bake these in. I thought they would hold together better than they did!  Other than being crumbly, they were very good!

I made these twice. First time I followed the recipe as stated. They tasted awesome, but did fall apart...they really couldn't be eaten as "bars" per se. The second time I followed the suggestion to use buttermilk, no oil, and bake in muffin tins. Voila...no crumbling. These are amazing, and full of flavor and nutrition. Breakfast on the go! I also added coconut and dried cranberries, and have a new favorite treat.

This recipe seemed to fall apart so easily, hardly a breakfast bar but more a bowl of baked oatmeal.  Probably won't make it again.

It was a hit with the boys. I do think I will add more dried fruit and nuts, a little less sugar, and a little flax meal. I might even substitute the cooking oil with applesauce like some of the other reviewers suggested. Overall, great recipe.

Really easy and quite tasty. I only used half the sugar (1/4c) and they were more than sweet enough. I used half almonds and half cashews for the nuts. These make a really nice quick snack or breakfast. I have to agree with other reviewers though that these are not exactly portable "squares" per se. They do hold together but are delicate and may fall apart a bit when you eat them. Next time I will try subbing in some banana as other reviewers have recommended. Sounds delicious.

A quick, nutritious breakfast! I have  substituted apple butter for the oil and cinnamon and sprinkled the top with wheat germ before baking. I've also used coconut oil.  We sprayed with nonfat butter spray when serving and enjoyed these!

This is the first time I have reviewed a recipe and I should have rated it when I first began to make it.  It is very easy to put together, quick to cook and hits the mark every time.  I have substituted pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds for nuts due to a family nut allergy, and even reduced the amount of sugar by 1/3 with no noticable difference. I have used dried cranberries, blueberries and cherries alone, and in combination with raisins.  Even the non- oatmeal lovers in the family love it. Really the best oatmeal bar you could make at home and way better than anything you could buy. You can sub in a variety of wholesome add ins, making it different every time. Great, great go to breakfast.

Yum!  I omitted the raisins and added 1/3 cup dried cherries, used 1/4 cup chopped pecans and added 1/8 cup chopped almonds.  I used a generous 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 2% milk, and sunflower oil.  Baked in an 8x8 pan this makes 9 squares, at 205 calories each. I've been eating it in the morning with my coffee and a glass of milk, and it keeps me full until lunch and doesn't raise my blood sugar.

This is so delicious!  I did what the other reviewers have said and replaced the egg with half of a banana, and the oil for unsweetened apple sauce.  I also used dried cranberries instead of raisins and no nuts.  I would call it a cross between a bar and a cake - so yummy!!

As delicious as something this healthy gets! I subbed apple sauce for the oil, 1/2 banana for the egg and soymilk instead of regular milk and quartered the sugar and it was still delicious!

Guilt-free, gluten free, low sugar and vegan.

Great!  We wanted to go as low-fat and healthy as possible.  So, we skipped the nuts and doubled the raisins, used agave instead of sugar (only need 3/4 as much agave asm sugar), skipped the oil minus the amount to spray the pan.

Having experiemented with other recipes, this one was closest to my ideal. I replaced the white sugar with slightly less loose light brown sugar, increase (2%) milk to 1 cup (so the end product holds together), replace oil with 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, use pecans, increase cinnamon to 1 teaspoon, add 1 tablespoon vanilla extract/flavoring, and add 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg and allspice. I also double the recipe and bake in 9 X 9 pan for 35 min. After cooled, I cut it into 8 pieces to put in snack bags to freeze. Thaw in fridge overnight, add a bit of milk, warm for 90 seconds in microwave and serve with more half & half. Perhaps these are enough modification to call it a new recipe. Enjoy.

Yum!  I used dried blueberries instead of raisins.  It was just a tad too sweet for my tastes.  so next time I will cut back on the sugar, but I never like my breakfasts too sweet, so that’s just my preference.  Very yummy and hardy!

This was really yummy!  I used 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup brown sugar and used frozen blueberries instead of raisins. I also topped it with a small amount of finely chopped peanuts and powder sugar.  I will make it again!

Delish! Made in muffin pan (eight muffins). Loved how moist these were. Used 1 tsp cinnamon, soy milk, baking powder instead of soda (was out of it)and craisins instead of raisins with pecans for the nuts. I also added 3 TB of ground flaxseed and next time will add more. Used canola for the oil.
Makes a healthy snack!

This is delicious! Since I don't like nuts and raisins in my oatmeal, I substituted chopped 1 1/2 chopped apple and substituted brown sugar for the white. The texture is consistent with other baked oatmeal recipes I've tried -- crumbly and soft -- just the way we like it!

Yummy! I halved the recipe just to try, added quarter a chopped apple instead of nuts and raisins, reduced the sugar by half and added more skim milk. Also used baking soda because that is what I had on hand. This turned out very moist, but still pretty crumbly. Will definitely make again as a healthy snack.

well i finally got around making this recipe. I made as written except for the nuts and raisins. I'm the only one who likes nuts so i just sprinkled a few on top of a few pieces. I'm out of raisins so i just added a few frozen cranberries. I really loved the flavor of this recipe, but like the majority it didn't hold up just crumbled. The verdict i'd probably make it again. Maybe i'll try adding some flour to see if that helps hold them together.

Ok, so I tried the recipe again. This time I made a single batch, decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup, decreased the salt to 1/8 teaspoon, and added chocolate chips instead of raisins. These ones are much better, but still a strange texture. I guess due to no flour.***I don't know what I did wrong, but these were way too salty, had a weird texture and were too sweet. I'm really sad because I had doubled the recipe to freeze them for my daughter's lunches so I wasted a lot of food that I can't afford to waste :(

First time I tried baked oatmeal and am so glad I tried this recipe.  I loved it!  I subbed almond milk for milk and agave for the sugar.  I added an apple and reduced the oil to half the amount.  Great recipe.

Taste is great!  It got 4 stars from me only because the bars fall apart very easily and do not hold together.  I had to eat it with a spoon because it was in crumbs!  It is delicious though!

Pretty tasty. I subbed the 1/2 cup sugar for 1/4 splenda and 1/4 brown sugar splenda and a dash of Agave nectar. I also skipped the raisins. This was quite the treat, cant wait for tomorrow so I can eat it for breakfast.

OK with some changes. I added 1/2 cup more oats, used apple sauce for the oil, used cranberries instead of raisins, used raw sugar, added a sprinkle of cinnamon, and added 1 diced apple to the batter. I was able to cut into squares with no problem. Held together nicely. More like a very dense cake. My toddler loved it

I love this recipe.  I make it as is or with a few variations.  I have substitueded either peanut butter or applesauce for the oil.  I've also thrown in what ever fresh fruit I have, bananas, apples, pears.  I peal it and then dice them into small bits.

I just made these with the kids. We accidentally dumped in too many oats so we added some applesauce and went ahead and chopped up an apple too. When done the taste was good, but needs more spices. Also still too crumbly,maybe my fault. We crumbled it up and ate like like cereal with milk and sugar on top!.......... Update: I made these again. Doubled cinnamon and added another 1/2c brown sugar, 1 cup applesauce, whole chopped apple. When done I covered in "Vanilla Glaze" from All Recipes and let it sit til cool. It cut into bars nicely and had a sticky sweet top!

Very good. I used 4 0z of applesauce in place of the oil, added extra cinnamon, pumpkin spice, nutmeg, and cloves. Very flavorful. A keeper. 6/20/09 Made these this morning using 1/4 c of Splenda Brown sugar blend, in place of the sugar, and added 1/2 of a mashed banana. Delicious

This would have been good if I just followed the recipe as written.  Instead I halved the sugar as suggested by many...it wasn't nearly sweet enough for me but I think it would have been delicious with the full amount of sugar.

Kids loved them. I substituted equal amount applesauce for oil and Splenda for sugar. Used a combination of raisins and dried cranberries. Were very good when eaten fresh. Covered the leftovers with plastic wrap and served for breakfast the next day- became very soggy but still tasted good. Quick and hearty breakfast for the kids.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  The taste was okay, but it had a weird texture.  They came out dry and crumbly when baked despite all the wet ingredients.  We didn't care for these.

I made 2 batches of these, the first with applesauce instead of vegetable oil (and craisins and walnuts), and the second with grapeseed oil with a tablespoon of maple syrup added.  The consistency of the second batch was very crumbly, but the first was excellent and held together well.  Next time I will double the recipe as others suggested so the squares are a bit thicker.  Nice healthy recipe - thanks!

Wonderful!  I used regular oats and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  We just spooned it out of the pan because it didn't really cut into squares easily.  I eat it plain but husband eats it with milk. He loves it and looks forward to the leftovers! This is the only way I can eat cooked oatmeal-it's great!

Super easy staple recipe in our house. Freeze pretty well too for toddler snacks at school. We add all kinds of things from the pantry. I would recommend baking in a glass dish as they turn out better (they did for me).

Yes, it was delicious, but it COMPLETELY crumbled.  I was going to bring it on vacation, but no longer.  But if it works for you, you could consider skipping the cinnamon, raisins, and nuts and adding chocolate chips.  I just wish it stuck.  Otherwise, it was good. :(

I love this recipe :) I did take a few of the suggestions from other reviews and substituted apple sauce for the oil which I think gave it a little more flavor.  I also added some chopped walnuts and almonds for the nuts and dried cranberries with the raisins and finely chopped apples.  Overall, it made a delicious breakfast bar that I will definitely be taking for my morning ride to work! The only thing I regret is that I didn't cook them quite long enough and they came out a little more cake-y than I thought they would.  Otherwise, if you like oatmeal, you'll love these! :)

Delicious! I make these sometimes when I feel like being fancy for breakfast. Super easy! They aren't granola bars, you still have to eat it with a fork or spoon, but it's cakey, and so good! I like it with craisins in it.

I made these baked oatmeal squares today and I am waiting for them to cool.  The recipe does not call for any flour.  Is this correct?

These came out way better than I expected! They were not at all bland, and had a nice nutty flavor. Variations: omitted nuts, and added chopped dates. After reading some of the other comments, I might try these with honey and applesauce rather than sugar and oil. My only complaint is that they were crumbly and fell apart, instead of sticking together in a bar form. It is a great recipe though, and I will definitely be making these again!

The flavors are wonderful...everyone, including my oldest son, who is a very picky eater, loved them.  We had no leftovers.  I made the recipe exacty and it did cut into bars, although crumbly ones... not so much of a grab and go breakfast, but a sit down and eat one.  Yummy!  I already have requests to make this one again!

Great recipe! At 9:05 this morning I remembered I meant to look up something like this and make it last night for my son who was leaving for a week...oops! He was being picked up at 9:50 so I whipped together 2 batches and had them baked, wrapped and ready to go by the time he walked out the door! They taste great-mine also seemed to have a bit of a problem holding together but I normally would have let them sit in the pan for a while-have a 3rd batch in now and am sure it won't be a problem. Thanks for posting this!

I'm always looking for gluten-free recipes for my wife and daughter, and when I came across this, I was excited.  Little did I know that it will NEVER, despite repeated efforts, yield bars.  Crumbles and mash, success!, but bars, not a chance.

I made 2 batches of these today. I used Brown sugar in place of white sugar, and Smart Balance Oil in place of vegitable oil. I also didn't measure the cinnamon. I made the basic recipe, and to the first batch I added 1 1/2 diced apples. Then I sprinkled the other 1/2 apple and some chopped walnuts on top. The second I... put the following dried fruit: raisins, dates, figs, cherry flavored craisins. Then I sprinkled chopped Pecans on top, and drizzled some honey over that. Both were SUPER yummy, and all my kids loved them, though they each had their own opinions as to their fav's. I will DEF make these again, and continue experimenting with them!

These have a good taste, but they completely fall apart - no "squares" about it. You have to eat it with a spoon. I may try it again and add an extra egg and a little bit of whole wheat flour.

I couldn't believe how tasty these were.  They were so simple and needed so few ingredients, I wasn't expecting them to be as good as they were.  Everyone who tried them was just as surprised definitely a go to recipe for those unexpected guests.

Excellent recipe!!  I tried it out in Lancaster, Pa. and this recipe is as close as I've found to what I tasted.  The only thing I did was omit raisins (my husband doesn't like them) and added more chopped nuts (I used pecans).  Thanks for the great recipe!

I can only give this recipe a 3 and that's mainly for taste. These taste great but they crumbled completely. I cut them into squares but when I tried to get one out of the pan, they fell apart and that was very disappointing.

I really wish people would give 5 stars if a recipe is the best they've had, 4 good, 3 okay.... I like to use the rating to decide what new one to try, but when almost all recipes have 4 or 5 stars it doesn't help much. This recipe fell apart, my son licked it from his plate because he couldn't pick it up! taste was okay. I have made many different breakfast/ oatmeal/ granola bars and this one ranks low.

Absolutely loved these! I made them with mashed banana instead of the egg since I had some bananas that needed to be used. I also soaked the raisins beforehand so that they would be a bit softer.

Exceptionally delicious! I just ate this for breakfast with a few changes - I omitted the nuts and raisins and replaced the oil with applesauce for a healthier alternative. I also nearly halved the sugar and replaced it with brown sugar, instead. Before baking, I sprinkled half of the bar with chocolate chips and in the other half, I pressed walnuts into the bar and layered banana slices over the top. Five minutes before baking time was up, I removed the pan and spread the chocolate, sprinkling marshmallows on top for a s'mores effect. Scrumptious warm with a smooth, thick oatmealy flavor, and the bananas paired beautifully together with the bar in texture! SO simple - a definite keeper!

This is AWESOME!!  I substituted regular oats, and instead of rasins and nuts, I used two average sized pears.  I also used soy milk instead of regular milk   (lactose intolerant), and it came out GREAT!  Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe as is, but when I learned about my son's food intolerances, I made some changes.  I thought maybe others who shouldn't have cane sugar, eggs, or milk would like to know what I did.  Here goes...

For a DOUBLED recipe, I used: 1 whole, overripe banana (instead of 2 eggs), 1 cup sugar-free hemp milk, and 2T raw honey, 2T maple syrup, and 1T blackstrap molasses for the cane sugar.
They came out a nice color and very moist, but not sweet at all.  If you want to satisfy your sweet tooth, I would poke holes in them after baking and drizzle additional maple syrup on them, maybe brushing it on (my husband's wonderful idea).

I'm still playing with this recipe.  It's delicious, but it does not look like the picture.  It's so crumbly.  I made it the first time exactly as the recipe said.  I could not cut it into squares.  My 2 year-old hates raisins but he ate this... and a LOT of it.   The second time, I substituted chopped golden delicious apples for the nuts so I could give it to my 9 month old.  I also used half sugar and half brown sugar and used applesauce instead of the oil.  I will also try to bake it longer to see if maybe the problem I had the first time was that I under-baked it.

I had the same problem as others with it being crumbly.  So, I crumbled it all up, put it back in the oven at 250 for 45 minutes.  Turned out to make a great cereal.  I only put 1/4 cup sugar in it and 3 tbsp honey.  I did not put nuts in it because we have a nut allergy in the house, but use 1/4 cup of coconut instead.  Worked out great.  I think next time instead of raisins I will used dried cranberries.  It is just a tad sweet for me.

This is not what I was hoping for in an oatmeal square!  They completely fall appart! Definitely NOT what I would even begin to call a bar! Also, BLAND! I even added extra cinnamon and some vanilla and nutmeg, but the only richness came from the sprinkling of chocolate chips! Interesting. I was thinking maybe you could drop these onto some vanilla ice cream and it might taste good, but what's the use??

These were great- tasted almost like oatmeal cookies!  I substituted applesauce for oil like some other suggestions.  Batter can also handle more raisins and nuts, so I increased each to 1/2c, but for a heartier bar, could use even more.

Well, I changed things because I can't seem to make anything without changing it. :)  I did 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  I added a mashed up banana.  I still did the egg; I just thought the banana would be good. :)  Instead of just raisins, I used a "berry medley" that had raisins, cranberries, blueberries, and cherries.  I also added a dash of vanilla, more cinnamon, and allspice.  It turned out to be quite tasty!  I would probably do more spices next time.  It crumbled some, but nothing major.  Delicious warm!

I mixed this recipe exactly as given, then realized my 8" square pan was not available. I poured the batter into a 9"x13" bar pan and baked it for 20 min. I then turned off the oven and let it set for another 5 minutes. At that time I opened the oven door and let it cool slowly. When I was ready to serve it up, I cut it into 6 portions, and found it was as crumbly as other reviewers said, but still moist and chewy. I crumbled one portion each for my 3 year old twins and 2 each for my older kids (age 7&8) and my (pregnant) self into bowls. I then served it with milk poured over it. The kids loved this "home-made granola cereal" and the picky 7 yr old asked for seconds! (It was all gone though.) I will make this in the same way again & again with the only change being to double the amount of cinnamon called for, we like our cinnamon & it's so good for you.  I felt this was a pretty healthy recipe as is, I used canola oil & walnuts, so I didn't feel the need to modify anything else and was pleased the kids liked it so well. However, since it is supposed to be a bar recipe I could not give it 5 stars because it would be nearly impossible to eat as a bar. Thanks for a great breakfast option for the kids & me!

Not too thrilled with this recipe.  Followed directions, came out of oven looking good, but let it cool a bit and cut it into bars.  It was very crumbly, unlike "breakfast bars".  Was a tad salty, too, I thought, but my wife didn't seem to think so.

Great recipe! I decided to leave out the fruit and nuts so that I could just have simple baked oatmeal and it turned out absolutely delicious. I added brown sugar and milk to the bowl afterward and it tasted like heaven.

Tasted okay, but I obviously didn't bake long enough or something went wrong, because they didn't "stick" together - I couldn't cut them into bars, and they would have required a spoon to eat! I might try again hoping for better results.

My kids (and husband) love this recipe!  We make it healthier by cutting the sugar in half and using applesauce instead of oil.  I then serve it with milk poured over top.  Delicious!

This is so good.  I did make a couple of changes - I use applesauce instead of oil and add a handful of choco chips...mmm...it is a great thing to bring to work - an easy, cheap and healthy option to doughnuts!  I continue to get lots of compliments on them.

This recipe was fantastic! I added a bit more cinnamon and omitted the raisins (didn't have any) but otherwise it was great. I used canola oil (healthier) and I think next time may try it with brown sugar rather than white but will definitely make these again! Super easy, too!

The recipe as is deserves 5 stars, but I can never leave well enough alone and had to mess around with it to make it a little healthier. First, I used zucchini puree in place of the oil (garden is overflowing with the stuff so I'm adding it to EVERYTHING). Secondly, I used yogurt in place of the milk. I cut back slightly on the sugar because the yogurt was sweetened. Thirdly I added an additional 1/2 cup of dried blueberries along with the raisins because I wanted to use the rest of the package up. I also threw in a fistful of wheat germ. I did have to increase the cooking time (40 min) , but its well worth it. These turn out moist and chewy and I'm planning to make sure I have some always on hand this  school year. All three of my kids love them for breakfast. "You mean I can REALLY have cookies for breakfast?"

This recipe was great! I made a few adjustments to make it a little healthier and they were delicious and disappeared very quickly.  I came home from work one day and my dad and brother had eaten them all.. guess I'll have to make more next time.  Instead of sugar i used one tablespoon of honey and one tablespoon of lite maple syrup, as another user suggested.  I also replaced the vegetable oil with 1/2 of cinnamon apple sauce. I used 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts, but next time I will use a bit more.  I replaced the raisins with craisins because that is what I had. I used a whole teaspoon of cinnamon but will use more next time to increase the flavor.  Overall these were awesome, a great nutritious snack.  I loved the texture, they were very soft and chewy.  I'll definitely be making these again, thanks!

These bars were good.  Not quite the taste I was looking for, but they will be a good snack for the garage sale I'm participating in.  I'm thinking of a way that can be iced to make them a little sweeter/crunchier.

Update:  People loved these!  I will also try again with dried cranberries or cherries.

I think this recipe is wonderful.  I have made some changes.  I double the recipe in the 8x8 pan for a thicker square.  I also add craisins and instead of nutmeg, I add 2 tbs. of allspice.  I have made this with cream instead of milk, too.  Each time, it has turned out great.  I have also substituted the sugar for Whey-low, a diabetic sugar substitute.  It didn't change the taste at all.  This has become a staple in our family's breakfast.

I made this with only 1/4 cup sugar, and it was plenty sweet.  If you plan on using sugar on top, you might even be able to omit the sugar.  I also mixed in dried cherries that I had soaked in orange juice and walnuts.  Baked in a 11x7" pan, but next time, I would use an 8x8".  Topped with brown sugar and warm milk.

This is decent. The flavor is sort of strange to me--maybe because I accidentally added too much salt. I tripled the recipe and baked it for 5 minutes longer. The oatmeal stuck together for the most part, but didn't cut nicely into squares, which is too bad because I brought it to my office to share.

I wasn't impressed by this one at all. Sorry. I only had one kid that liked it. It seemed almsot wet on the bottom which turned us off. It really also needs more flavor.

Absolutely the best!!  My husband likes cinnamon chips, so I substituted them for the cinnamon, and we both enjoyed the squares very, very much.

I thought these were good but my husband wasn't too keen on them.  I increased the recipe by half and used a combination of brown sugar and white sugar.  I used applesauce instead of oil and added a half tsp. of vanilla and a few sprinkles of nutmeg.

This was wonderful.  It has a great taste and was super easy to make.  I baked it in a smaller - 6 inch round stone so that it was thicker.  Next time I will double the recipe - it's that good!  Thanks for sharing.

Tastes amazing. I love baked oatmeal. Turned out more like something that needed to be eaten with a fork than like the granola bar type thing I was expecting. I didn't use nuts or raisins but added dried cranberries - YUM! I would definately double the recipe to make it thicker next time (it was very thin in my pan) and if you're serving it to any number of people even tripple the recipe. I might add a little less oil next time.
