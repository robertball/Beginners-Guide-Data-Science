I just made this recipe for a brunch and everyone really enjoyed it. I used stuffing instead of breadcrumbs, replaced eggs with an egg substitue, lowered the butter amount, and also used non-fat milk. It came out delivious. In the future, i will add more carrots/celery and reduce amount of stuffing for a lower carb meal.

This was excellent. I made it as is plus threw in some onions and garlic. I had to bake it a little longer than stated to make sure the centre was set, but that may have been my oven. (I did just over an hour at 350) The family gave me rave reviews. Serving it with gravy added more flavor but was not really necessary. This was a great dish.

My family loved this recipe.  The way i prepared it reminded us of Thanksgiving.  As I didn't have certain ingredients on hand, I sub. the milk, broth, and butter with 50 oz of cream of chicken (large can from GFS).  didn't put eggs in because one doesn't like them and after eating it, I don't know how it would fit in.  used cro√ªtons (4 cups). I had cauliflower to use up, so I put that in too.  I would either dice my potatoes smaller or precook them as some still weren't cooked all the way and may cut down on some cooking time (I admit, mine were a bit inconsistent in size).  Also, I added fresh ground pepper, oregano, and thyme and used no salt.  Could easily be used with Thanksgiving leftovers, including the stuffing.  Will definitely make again with other variations that come to mind.  This recipe sparked some creative cooking ideas.

This was a pretty good dish, but definitely serve it with a gravy.  I chose not to, and it was pretty dry.  My husband and I thought that it was a 2-star dish without gravy, but that it would be close to a 5-star dish with the gravy.  The number of servings is off on this recipe - I halved the recipe and it was the perfect amount for two of us.  If you halve the recipe, decrease the cooking time - I didn't and it came out too dry.  I used breadcubes used for stuffing as they were readily available the week before Thanksgiving.  There were some pieces of rye bread in the bread mixture which gave it a nice flavor.  I cooked the chicken by broiling it in white wine at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.  For the sauce I used nonfat milk and this worked fine.  Otherwise I made the recipe as is.  It definitely has potential!

I used boxed stuffing mix instead of bread cubes/left out the potatoes. I also added an extra egg as I like my Stratas alittle more custardy. When I first mixed this up I really questioned this/when it came out it was really good I used leftover chicken great way to use up leftovers!

This is definitely a "keeper"... I used egg-beaters in place of real eggs, and I didn't have fresh carrots, so I used a package of frozen carrots and broccoli.  I also added a couple of dashed of cayenne for a little zip.  Awesome dish for left-over chicken!  Thanks for sharing.

I made this as directed. It's between a 3 & 4 stars, as is. It was just like Dressing or Stuffing.   We didn't have gravy, so I made a sauce from mayo, milk, chicken boullion cubes, pepper, and parm cheese. We liked it with that! With your own flair, this can be great! It was very dry for us, like it needed more broth.   If I make it again, I will precook the diced veggies with the chicken. I will use less bread and maybe add cheese on top. I will not do the second 45 minute bake. Not really a 'bad' recipe. There is room to customize for sure. Maybe add Cream of Chicken soup in it or on it after. The ideas are open! Experiement and enjoy!

I used flavored crouten cubes so I didn't add salt, pepper or parsley. I made half and still cut back on bread because others said it was dry. Added green peppers, it needed the taste and color.

I loved this, I used Wheat Bread for the Bread and I added a few cloves of garlic, and this was delish.  It made alot more then I anticipated!  Next time, I would decrease the bread and liquids by half.

Didn't care for this too much.  It was bland to me and my family.  Will not use this recipe again.  I prepared the recipe as the directions stated.  It was not dry but not enough flavor for us...even with the gravy.

This one wasn't all that great.  My husband hated it.  I found it dry, but the flavour was alright and my daughter seemed to like it.  Not sure how to fix this one up but I probably won't make it again.
