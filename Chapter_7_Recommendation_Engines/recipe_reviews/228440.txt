Very good! I did use a bit more mayo and cheese and regular ranch dressing instead of FF. Also, I had no fresh parsley, so I used some dried. We LOVE trying new potato salads, and this one was a nice surprise...A definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Excellent. My kids loved this recipe and so did my husband. Brought it to a family BBQ as well and it was a big hit! Will definitely be keeping this one. I did use a little more mayo and regular dressing.

This was decent but lacking flavor - I was very disappointed.

This was easy to make and super delicious!! I only had 2 pieces of bacon so I used that and some ham that I had on hand. I used 8 smaller russet potatoes and 5 eggs. I doubled the sauce mixture because we are having this for dinner tomorrow. I loved loved the fresh parsley it was a nice addition. 
I WILL make this again and again! So good, thank you for posting!!

Superb! I love my potato salad n i love this even more with ranch dressing! I made the dressing using the dry hidden valley ranch not ff bottled. I also used more dressing since i love my ps creamy. I omitted the pickles n eggs, since im not fond of either in ps. Def a keeper! Tnx!

It was extremely dry.  Added more ranch, mayo, (used sweet relish instead) and seasoned to taste then it was amazing.  Great base recipe to add your own twist for sure!

I've made this potato salad twice now.  It was requested a second time because they liked it so much when I made it at a prior engagement. I did change it up a bit.  I used 1-2 cups of homemade ranch dressing (I like my potato salad creamy and they tend to dry out).  It's not fat free by any means but really does make the yummy flavor.  Also, instead of mayo, I used miracle whip.  I feel like it gives it more flavor than mayo.  Also, added a little horseradish and didn't have parsley the 2nd go around so used dried.  It tasted just as good as the first batch that had the fresh parsley.  Everything else I left as is.  This is a keeper recipe!  Thank you.

I doubled the dressing and that amount was about right. My husband thought it was worth trying again, so next time I would omit mayo and use extra ranch because the ranch flavor wasn't strong. I would also maybe leave out the bacon because that flavor didn't come through anyway.

What a great recipe, thank you for sharing! I made ranch dressing from a recipe on the side, using Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Just my attempt to make this a little bit healthier! Of course I doubled the bacon and thanks so that probably cancels out any healthiness,

I made this for an Easter brunch expecting to have leftovers. It was such a hit that I brought an empty bowl home and received lots of requests to make it for the next family potluck!

I loved this, however, my hubby wasn't as thrilled with it as me and didn't get seconds.  He thought the  dressing was a bit too mayonnaise-y.  I did take what others said and doubled the dressing, however, I didn't use all of it as I didn't want it too runny.  I used my left over dressing as dip for carrots.  Yummy.

Made this for my Memorial Day Party.  Everyone who tried this liked it.  Was told this was a first for trying a potato salad that had a ranch flavor and by the end of the party it was gone.  Thanks for the recipe.

We enjoyed this potato salad! Look at the list of ingredients, what's not to like? Just add a little more ranch dressing to this for the perfect mouth-watering flavor and consistency!! I definitely will make this again! Thanks for sharing!

I subbed bacon ranch dressing for the FF ranch for an added bacon blast, and sprinkled more cheese on top.
