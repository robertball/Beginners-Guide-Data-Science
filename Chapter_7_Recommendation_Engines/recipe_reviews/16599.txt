I thought this recipe was only okay. The flavor was good, but not amazing. I have recipe dip similar to this that I think I will stick with. If I were to make it again, which I probably won't, I would blend all the ingredients together and then top with the cheese instead of layering the ingredients.

This was the BEST dip I have ever made.  I have made it several times in the last 5 months.  I have since given this recipe out about 10 times.  I would like to say that if you like spicy dips, you will want to add jalapenos to it.  I have also added black olives, too.

This is a great recipe that is quick to make.  I added chili powder and onion powder on top of the chili.  It was not a spicy dish at all, so for the people who like spicy food I placed a hot sauce and a bowl of hot salsa next to the dip.  Everyone was asking for the recipe by the end of the night.  I also had to make a second helping, because the first one was finished right away!!

Very, very bland...I ended up added quite a bit of cayenne just to give it a little kick.  I will not be making this one again.

I threw all the ingredients for this into my little crockpot and let it go all morning. I used reduced fat cream cheese, Nalley chili (Washington reppin'!), a full can of the mild diced green chilies (isn't a small can of chilies a quarter cup?) and sharp cheddar. YUM! We've been snacking on it for the last hour and it sure is good! Great way to make a special treat and use up a few more cans out of your pantry.

WoW Kim! Soooo addictive. My family couldn't stop eating this. This is wonderful dip/spread. When we ran out of Tortilla chips, they dragged in stalks of celery...since I always have celery laying about! Great with celery...probably great with anything! Thanks so much.

All the kids went nuts over this great Super Bowl or any excuse for a party appetizer. The kids and I love anything that even resembles mexican and this was just what the doctor ordered. We baked our chips in the oven to make them nice and crispy and also used chili with the beans as we really like the flavor they add. Thanks for a really wonderful and very easy recipe Kim!!

I'm giving this 5 stars because my boyfriend LOVED this dip. Next time I will double the ingredients. I topped mine with diced red onion. Oh I mixed everything together except the cream cheese instead of layering. Turned out great!

VERY GOOD!  I halved the recipe and baked 15 minutes.  My daughter and I really liked this, but son and hubby said it didn't have enough heat.  I will make again and add hot sauce or sliced jalepenos.

This recipe was given the highest rating out of the five appetizers I served recently for a jewelry party.  I used turkey chili w/no beans and light cream cheese to reduce the fat.  I put all the ingredients in the food processor rather than layering, as the chili can be quite chunky and pulsed it a few times until it was blended.  When prepared this way you can choose the amount that you want to serve and can be made ahead and refrigerated.  I did not drain the chili's without any adverse affects and used the entire can.  It was great!

This was pretty good, but if I made it again, I would definitely buy chili WITH beans (and maybe even add an extra can of beans as well.) The dip wasn't liquid-y or anything, but it could have used more of a "bite" to it. As a side note, I just mixed everything together before baking instead of layering it.

We doubled the recipe and except just one can of chili with beans, spread it out on large ovenproof platter, used sharp cheddar cheese and topped off with jalepeno slices  Very pretty to look at and was finished off before half time ! thanks  !

I make this ap in the crockpot all the time too, you are correct, there are never any leftovers.  You can really play with this recipe.  I like Chilli with beans, I also can make lasctose free with soy cream cheese and lactose free cheese. I've seen it served with corn in it too.

This recipe is a good starting point. As is, I found it kind of bland for my tastebuds. I added chopped garlic and a little salsa to the chili as well as adding a little bit of taco seasoning to the cream cheese. After making those adjustments, I couldn't keep people away from it!

I have been making this for years.  It is a standard at all get togethers.  I have gone to using light cream cheese (can't tell the difference at all!) and I usually use a taco or tex mex blend for the cheese on top.  I have played around with the types of chili.  The standard beans in hot sauce is always good but I like to use Stagg chili with the bits of steak in it. There is NEVER any left over! YUM!!

Quick, easy and tasty.  I have been making this for years w/out the green chilis, but will try it that way.  We like it with giant corn chips (ie Fritos Scoops)

This was just ok. I used a quality chili but it was still greasy which was gross. Next time I will make this when I have leftover chili and never use chili from a can again.

A better and faster version of this is to leave out everything but the cream cheese on bottom, chili in the middle, and cheese on top. microwave the cream cheese for 40 seconds before spreading. then heat the chili for a 1 1/2-2 minutes in microwave and spread on top, followed by the cheese. DEFINITELY a keeper, and must be eaten with Frito scoops chips to seal the deal. Especially great for kids' tastes

Great dip! I usually double or triple it and put it in a 9x9 or 9x13 pan for family events. I add browned hamburger on top of the chili, add black olives and jalapenos to spice it up. It's great with monterey jack cheese too. Everyone loves it. If you want extra spice you can get the hot chili without beans.

I had a craving for this last night..and couldn't find my recipe. This is exactly how I make it. The only thing I change is to add about a half can of Rotel..so it has the green chiles but also some tomato. Thanks for the recipe..this one is a keeper!

I have made this for several Steeler parties throughout the season and everyone loves it, kids and adults alike. I will be adding a little less chiles for the kids for the Super Bowl and adding some taco seasoning to the creme cheese and some sliced black olives to the top of the chili (may try with beans this time).

This was very blah.  I tried to spice it up by using jalapenos instead of diced green chilis and the "hot" hormel chili but it still didn't do much for me.  Maybe I just don't like chili from a can.  I may try this again next time I make homemade chili and see how I like it.

The green onions overwhelmed the taste of the chili, if I try this again I will use less green onions and more chile and green chilis.

not a huge fan.  If I made it again, I would probably cut the cheddar cheese serving in half as well as the green onions.  had too much of an onion flavor.

Great dip.  Next time I might mix the chili and cream cheese together, but this is fantastic either way.  It was gone in 30 minutes on Super Bowl Sunday.

I make this dip but do it a bit differently.  The cream cheese gets spread into a bowl and up the sides then I put the chili in and add cheese to the top.  I either use a jar of nacho cheese or the canned kind and heat.  Excellent!!

I made this for my superbowl party and I just mixed this all together and it was GREAT!!!  I kept in a "football" crock-pot and that kept it warm.  Also, I used Velveeta instead of the cheddar cheese and it was really smooth.  I thought I had regular chili, I didn't but I had vegetarian chili with beans, and it really was good.  I served it with Fritos and it was the first thing to go!

I think the brand of chili you use can make or break this dip. Unfortunately, I used a generic store brand chili that wasn't so good.

Like the other reviews said, the plate was licked clean!  I finely chopped some jalapeños (without seeds) & some yellow onion.  I mixed this with the chili.  I also added spices: pepper, chili, cilantro, & garlic.  It was great!

I'm giving this a 4 because I thought it was a 3, but ALL my guests raved about it. I found it a little bland, but my tastes seem to be spicier than most. Next time I think I would mix cumin into the cream cheese and put some chopped cilantro on top. It must be good as is though because everyone thought it was so good.

This is a great basic recipe.  With a few modifications, it was delicious.  Here's my two cents:  I used reduced fat cream cheese, and lost nothing in the flavor.  I sprinkled a little cayenne pepper on top of that for a little heat. Used Hormel chili, but I bet homemade chili would be incredible. On top of the chili, I spread a 1/2 c. of medium salsa.  This seemed to give it the kick others said was missing. I kept the green onions aside and sprinkled them on top after baking.  This gave it a nice flavor.  All in all, definitely worth trying.  Perfect for watching football!

This was a definite crowd pleaser! I made it in a small casserole dish so all you saw when I pulled it out of the oven was the bubbling hot cheddar on top. Everyone loved it and I'm making it again this week!

I made this for a get together we have every Friday - it was gone before you knew it.  The only change I made was I used chili with beans - I forgot to write without beans on the shopping list for my husband.  It was a HUGE hit and I make a dip every Friday and I have never had one go so fast!

Pretty good dip- I used reduced fat cream cheese and Hormel chili with beans. I mixed some chili powder in the cream cheese and a whole can of roasted chilies with the chili- still a little bland.  Still got gobbled up at the super bowl party!

This was a good tasting recipe that was simple to make! We followed the directions except using vegetarian chili instead of the chili without beans. The vegetarian chili we got, however, (Hormel) was very watery and watered down our dip. Next time I would go with a different vegetarian brand.

Dang this is Good! We've made it dozens of times, never anything left.  We're not big on the Chiles and Onions so we leave them out..We have learned to love it with Wavy Lay's potato chips also..it's addictive!

I made this dip last night for an impromptu family gathering and since these are all items you keep on hand, this recipe was perfect to serve!  I did not use the green onions since we don't like onions, I didn't have any, and I honestly don't think this dip needed them - the flavor was incredible!  This dip was devoured within minutes of coming out of the oven.  Very easy recipe...one that we will make again and again!  We used Fritos Scoops as our "dippers."  Yummy!!

I have made this numerous times, because I get so many requests for it!!  I never have any left.  The only change I make (only because it's what I keep in the cupboard...) is that instead of beanless chili, I use chili with beans....

While I was not too crazy about the blend of flavors here, everyone at my party raved about it and it was GONE in no time.  They were actually using the tortilla chips to scrape out the last remnants in the pan.  I will make again.

This is easy to make and tasty. It needs to cook for about 25-30 minutes for me, not 15-20. Also,  I think it would taste better if the ingredients were mixed not layered, and the cheese sprinkled on top.

We loved this recipe. It tasted so good and was really easy to make. Great for the Super Bowl. We subbed Mexican Cheese Blend for the Cheddar because it's what we had on hand and used jalapeno slices instead of green chilies because that's our preference. Also used reduced fat cream cheese and couldn't tell the difference. I will definitely make this one again and again.

I used chili with beans. I also added green onions, jalapenos and hot sauce for extra kick. I mixed everything together and topped with cheddar cheese (all I had). Then I just heated it in microwave. Tasted great and was so easy to fix.

I think I've only given out one other "5" in the past - this is definitely a "5" Bar-none, the best natcho dip I've tried. I only found chilli with beans - no problemo - went well. Made no changes other than that. People will be impressed if you serve this recipe.

pretty good recipe. Didn't read the reviews before hand, but I should have added hot sauce. Nice flavor though, just not as spicy as I would have liked it to be.

Fantastic Dip! Quick and Easy! I have made this twice.  Both times I made it, everybody wanted the recipe.  This dip didn't last more than 20 minutes, from the moment I set it down on a table with all the other appetizers!

Wow. This couldn't have been any easier. I almost ate the whole thing myself. I will try a different chili next time just to see how they differ. I used hormel beanless this time. This is a keeper.

This was a great party appetizer.  I assembled it ahead of time and then popped it into the oven when the guests arrived.  I forgot to add a few minutes to the baking time to compensate for it being cold from the fridge, but it was still delicious!  Next time I'll use spicy chili instead of mild to add some zing.

Made this for a Super Bowl party and it was gone in a flash.  Served it with Triscuits and they were perfect (sliced baguette would have worked too).  Wish I had a way to keep it warm when outside the oven as it is best eaten warm.

Tasty! I made it with Neufchatel cheese (1/3 less fat than regular cream cheese) and Kraft 2% Milk mild cheddar to cut out some of the fat. The hubby still liked it and it disappeared pretty quickly at Superbowl party we went to.

I thought this was really good although an interesting thing is that the flavor and texture improved as it sat out.  It was set up and tasted much better about 45 min. to an hour after it came out of the oven. This could be very good at a party that goes late.

I was a little disappointed with this recipe.  I took it to a Superbowl party & it was not a hit.  I added the jalepenos for flavor, like other users said.  But, the recipe ended up tasting just like plain chili.  The cream and cheddar cheeses did not even cut the strong chili taste.  I think I would've gotten the exact same flavor if I would've just heated up chili.  Also, the dish did not have the most appetizing appearance and so many guests skipped it.  I will not make it again.

Perfect football party food! 
I substituted chopped jalapenos (from a jar) for half the green chiles, though, adds some more spice!

This was very good. Instead of the canned chiles I used chopped jalepenos without seeds.  Next time I will add seasoning, such as cumin, cilantro, ect.

This is really good. I had a version of this befpre with just chili and cream cheese. This is definately better. I think this needs a little more kick. Maybe some chopped jalepenos. And no green onions.

What an easy, but delicious dip.  I use Tortilla Scoops to serve this dish.  And I have made it using chili without beans and chili with beans - - both were great.  If it is not spicy enough for you, simply add jalapenos or hot sauce.  It is quite a versatile recipe!

So easy to make and tastes good following the recipe alone. Adding some of  you're own ingredients makes it even better. I like using spicy hot chili and hide some more veg in there, and low fat cream cheese. Delish!

Very good and simple dip. I made it for the super bowl and I just threw all of the ingredients into a crock pot for the night. I'll be making this again.

This tasted amazing (I was able to taste past the canned chili). I made it as a side to "burrito lasagne" and spanish rice. The group loved it! Even the picky eaters. The one thing I did differently though was mix the chili with the cream cheese then start the layering. I feel like that is what made it so good. Also, next time I might just make the chili at home or buy a vegetarian chili. Canned meat is always gnna have that canned meat taste.

I have made this several times for gatherings and as an appetizer/meal. I live near a Wendys restaurant and have used their chili instead of canned version I usually purchase a large size. Since I love their chili, this is a win-win. Yum! Also, if you use Hormel canned chili, they have an extra spicy brand that gives the overall dish more of a kick. The green onion really adds something and I agree with another reviewer, Frito scoops do seal the deal.
