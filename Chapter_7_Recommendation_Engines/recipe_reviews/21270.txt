I have made this recipe for years to rave reviews, with a couple of adjustments.  I always put in a 2 lb. bag of hash browns instead of the 1 lb. that is called for here.  Also I use cream of celery or cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of potato.  Finally I add the crushed corn flakes mixed with a little butter on top to give it a little crispy topping and this is my holiday potato recipe.  The best part is that it can be made ahead of time, like the day before (keep refrigerated), which is a big plus at holidays.  Just don't put the crushed corn flakes/butter on top until ready to bake.

This recipe was really good, almost tasted like my "loaded maashed potatoes.  It was great with a few modifications: I peeled my own potatoes instead of using frozen has browns (about 9) and boiled them on the stove in water for about 30-45 minutes.  Once they were cooked and drained, I mixed all of the ingredients together and substituted a can of cream of mushroom for cream of potato.  I also added bacon bits and salt and pepper to the mixture.  I only had to bake them for about 20-25 minutes since the potatoes had been boiled.  Really delish!

Hope this helps!

This is a good side dish.  I did make a few modifications though.  I didn't use all of the cheese that was suggested.  16oz seemed like quite a bit.  I mixed 8 oz in with the potatoes and sprinkled about 1/2 cup on top.  In addition, I mixed in 1/2 cup each of onions and green peppers.  I omitted the potato chips.  Delicious!

I used the basic recipe here with a few changes.  I boiled 10 raw potatoes in water, cubed, for 30 minuites. Then drained and added to pan with cheese, cream of mushroom soup and sour cream (8 oz).  I topped with cheese, bacon bits and potato chips. This received rave reviews from kids and adults alike! Thanks for a really nice crowd pleaser!

Great dish - brought it for a Holiday party at work and everyone loved it. I recommend using half the amount of butter and extra potatoes.

Our family's favorite way to mix cheese and potatoes! This is a very cheesy dish, and I can't eat a lot at one time because of how rich it is, but boy is this a great recipe!

I liked this, though I wish there had been a higher potato vs. other stuff ratio.  It was a little too saucy for me.  I think I would use twice or half as much more potatoes next time.  Also, I found the butter to be unneccessary; the grease from the cheese and the water from the potatoes seemed to provide plenty of liquid.  I left off the potato chips and topped it with more cheese, which I allowed to melt and form a crust. I think you could make a "lower fat" version of this if you used low fat soup, cheese, and sour cream, etc... All in all, a good recipe.

Excellent and easy potatoes. I don't think I'd make for Thanksgiving  or other formal affair but I will make again with other everyday main dishes! Also, I didn't add the potato chips...tasty without!

Doubled the potatoes, used a little less than half the butter recommended, and skipped the potato chips.  Always a favorite at pot luck dinners.  Occasionally, for a change, I add bacon pieces.

These were ok. A bit bland for my taste but I need a recipe without onions since two people in my family cant stand them. They LOVED this dish. Everyone else thought it was lacking a little something. 
If I added onions they would be perfect. Other than that they were good. 
I did add an extra 1/2 bag of hash browns like some of the other suggestions or it would have been too "soupy". That was a great tip. :)

I omitted the chips and butter because of other reviews.  I made this to use up some hashbrowns I had bought in bulk.  I also made this in a big casserole dish so added onion soup and mushroom soup.  My kids and picky husband loved it!  I will make this again with boiled potatoes next time.  Thanks!

I give this five stars for how easy and yummy it is.  i usually perfer not using canned soup but i needed somthing quick.  To cut down on the time I first heated the potatoes through on the stove, this also makes them a little crispy. All I had was cream of chicken. I did not follow any of the measurements since I am only cooking for two and didn't know how much potatoes I was actually using.  I just put it together so it was creamy enough.  Used butter and bread crumbs insted of chips.

Very good recipe.  Be sure to use an extra 1/2 lb. of potatoes and only 1/4 lb. of butter.  This is a keeper.

I think the cream of potato soup needs to be omitted and cream of chicken soup used instead.  The cream of potato soup is extremely thick, and adds nothing.  The butter can/should be reduced to 1/4 cup (MAX)  This is a "comfort food" casserole.

Good recipe..very quick and easy. I usually boil my potatoes with the skin on and peel. This cut alot of time has I was rushed. This came close to what I always made. The taste of real potatoes is the best I think.

My grandma used to make this.  She called them "funeral potatoes."  I guess it's because it's the ultimate comfort food.  Just a few minor changes - I don't add butter at all to the mixture, and I do add onions and garlic.  Instead of corn flakes, we've always used Rice Chex.  Use your melted butter with the cereal on top FTW.  :)

This was really good - I use to have a similar recipe that I loved even more..but I can't find it anywhere! Perhaps it wasn't quite the same because I used fresh potatoes instead of hashbrowns..but it was still really good and everyone loved it!

I agree with the rest of the reviews to cut down the butter to 1/4. I also put corn flakes (instead of chips) on top after it was done baking, to add another texture. I brought this dish to a potluck :) Very delicious! Thanks for the recipe.

this is a recipe that most other people may like. I do not like the texture of scalloped-like potatoes.  the combination of ingredients; however, were very good.  I may use this recipe again and just adapt it to be more like mashed potatoes.

We did quite a bit of revising to this recipe (due to supplies on hand). We used frozen potato wedges in place of the hashbrowns, french onion sour cream chip dip in place of the sour cream, and cream of mushroom in place of cream of potato. We didn't have shredded cheese, so we mixed all ingredients as directed, then placed cheese slices to cover on top, under the crushed potato chips (used way more chips than recipe called for too). We omitted the butter all together (seemed like it would be to greasy). Even with all the revisions, It came out quite well! Will definetly make again (maybe even the right way!). The kids loved it.... :)

This dish calls for too much cheese and butter. Everything was swimming in butter and all that cheese was sickening to the stomach.

This is a favorite in my family, one we look for every holiday as our special treat.  The only difference we've made to this recipe is to use corn flakes on top instead of potato chips.  It's a little less fat and grease.  ALWAYS a crowd pleaser and my son just "gobbles" it up at Thanksgiving! :)

Although i have not tried the way the recipe reads i didn’t want to risk it and made some changes to procedure and ingredients which made it a5+ star recipe! I used real potatoes and cut them into small cubes. Importantly , i brought the water to a boil then threw in the potatoes (i believe his helped keep them together and not mushy) and pulled them just as they became soft. I used a handful of left over fancy aged and seasoned brine cheese i had from a party and grated that up along with a little cheddar for the base mix. What really put this over the top i believe is i used about a half stick of cream cheese as well as replace 1/4 cup of milk with heavy cream. I mixed these all together to make a mix then spread half the mix over the bottom of the casserole pan then threw the potatoes on top of that and folded the rest of the mix into the potatoes. This totally helped with coating them. Lastly i used corn flake bread crumbs instead of potato chips and then topped that with just cheddar cheese. The topping was crispy and creamy. I can’t wait to make this again. I think i might add salsa next time or taco seasoning for a twist! All credit to the original creator who has an excellent recipe!

the 1st time i made it i followed the recipe to the tee except i didn't use the crushed potato chips and it was good but it tasted to much of sour cream, I'm not a big fan of sour cream. the 2nd time i used half the sour cream it was awesome! thanks for the recipe, its one of my favorite side dishes to make and every year at the company christmas party everybody always ask if i can bring it.

I made this recipe in order to use up a half bag of frozen hash browns I had. I had less than 14oz of hash browns to put towards this recipe and I do agree with others, a full 2lb bag would probably be better -- I only put 12oz of cheese because 16oz did seem like a lot (and that's coming from a cheese addict) -- I used a 14oz can of semi-condensed cream of mushroom soup which probably contributed to the more soupy consistency, however I think this would have been totally fine with using 2lbs of potatoes -- the butter is totally pointless in my opinion, there's enough grease from the cheese, sour cream and soup to omit this -- I didn't top it with the chips since I was portioning this out for the week and couldn't afford the calories. Over all a tasty dish, if I make it again I will increase the potatoes to 2lbs and omit the butter.

Well these were a huge at our weekly family dinner. The only minor change I did was to use 1/2 the amount of butter and added bacon to the potatoes. A definite keeper.

Added bacon and cornflakes.  It seemed very rich.  I'd probably cut back on the sour cream.

Fantastic taste and presentation. I made the diced potatoes (Southern Hash browns) from scratch. The only thing against this is there is WAY TOO MUCH Butter! 1/2 C allows a ton of grease on the top that I mopped off with paper towels. I think a 1/4 stick would be plenty. I did not use potato chips for a crust, just everything else.

I have made different kinds of cheezy hash browm potatoes but none like i had at a church dinner.It was the same as this cheezy potatoe recipe.It was so creamy cheezy.The only difference that i could see with the recipe was that it had potatoes cut into big chunks.no cornflakes on top.This made such a change to the old hash brown casserole.I didn't know it was the same.I was told that you can buy the potatoes cut up like that in the frozen food.They put alot of cheese on top...yum yum

I've been making this recipe  for over twenty years now and it's always a huge hit at parties, potlucks, etc.  In fact, once I brought it to my then work's first potluck, I was told that I could never bring anything but this dish ever again (LOL).  My recipe does call for a few different ingredients, though: cream of chicken instead of cream of potato soup and crushed Kellogg's corn flake cereal instead of the potato chips, but I'm sure the taste is equally delicious either way..

Oh man these were good.  We actually doubled the recipe and used fresh cut yellow potatoes (skins on) and they were fabulous.  It perfectly fills a 9X13 doubled, you will just need to cut them small bite size and cook just a tad longer.  Thank you for submitting this one!!

This is a potluck favorite.  The only revision I made was to increase the potatoes by about 1/2 lb.  Just looked like it would be too soupy otherwise.  Thanks for a keeper!
