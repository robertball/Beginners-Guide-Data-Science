These are amazing! I love that it uses a cookie mix - so easy. I used a different filling: 1 stick butter, 1/2 cup peanut butter, 3 c XX sugar, 2 oz cream cheese. Sandwich, then refrigerate for an amazing treat!

Very good cookies, and simple to make.  Filling is a little sweeter than my family likes, but overall, very good.

I have had rave reviews about these cookies.  They are really moist and you can't really taste the banana.  I made a couple of small changes that worked out great.  For the filling/frosting I used vanilla yogurt and added 2 oz. of cream cheese.  Then instead of making sandwiches out of them I melted choc. almond bark and coated the bottom with choc. I just used a spoon to spread it on the bottom and laid them choc. side down on wax paper to let them cool.  Once cool I put the frosting on top with choc sprinkles.  They were a hit!
