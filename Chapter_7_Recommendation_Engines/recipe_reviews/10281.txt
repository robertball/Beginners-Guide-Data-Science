I added butter instead of margarine,  yeast instead of baking soda, chia seeds instead of cocoa and  pureed chicken meat instead of eggs. And let me tell you, it turned out AWFUL! The person who wrote this recipe should delete it. Please, don't use this recipe! I can't believe i was so dumb to use it.

I was looking for an easy, quick fix for my husband's chocolate craving...I found it!  The fact that they do taste like brownies was a bonus.  They were easy to make and they were delicious.  Definately drop them by the teaspoonful or less, they spread. The only problem I experienced was they stuck to my cookie sheet something aweful.  Parchment paper might work, though I didn't have any...wax paper did not work.  However, lightly greasing the sheet worked beautifully.  I will definately make these again.

I give this recipe a zero! It was horrible. I followed the recipe. Made one pan of cookies and I had a mess. I couldn't get the cookies off the pan, they all ran together into one big awkward shape, and they were so thin they fell apart when you picked them up. It said to add 2 cups of flour, I put 4 and it still wasn't enough! Whoever came up with this recipe seriously can't cook. I think that this reciped should b removed from this website. The cookies ended up everywhere. I could not even eat one cookies because i couldnt get it near my mouth without it falling to the floor in pieces! It was horrible. I will never use this recipes again.

I was looking for chocolate cookies that didn't require chocolate chips. This recipe is just what I wanted. I used butter, since I was out of margarine, and made sure it wasn't too soft. They turned out best when I didn't grease the cookie sheet.

The instructions for this recipe really should indicate chilling the dough. It will cut down on the flatness of the cookies. Even with chilling though they are still fairly flat cookies, but there isn't anything wrong with that is there? They are delicious, moist, and chewy. Like the edge piece from a pan of brownies. I put an unwrapped Andes mint on each as they came out of the oven and swirled the chocolate after it was melted to make a yummy mint cookie for my holiday baking.

These tasted delicious, but the batter was a little awkward. Definitely keep the spoonfuls very small and chill to help firm it up some. I cooked for 10 minutes. I sprayed my sheet with Pam also and didn't have any problems with the cookies sticking. I wouldn't suggest making these for a potluck or party because they look messy after cooking. Has a nice brownie texture though.

Very tasty, I must say!  I was surprised that they didn't taste too "cocoa-ish". I used 1/3 cup pecans, 1/3 cup whole almonds & 1/3 cup slivered almonds instead of using walnuts (had none)- and it was quite a good substitute. Also, instead of all that margarine (too many transfats), I used 1/2 cup butter & 1/3 cup canola oil, and it turned out just fine.

I have made these cookies often, having found the same recipe in a Taste of Home magazine. They are one of my "go to" cookie recipes. Only diff in their recipe is butter instead of margarine, and the addition of one and a half cups of chocolate chips. I change it up sometimes and use dried cranberries and chips or Heath brickle bits,etc. Don't understand the problems people have had with this, just like a Tollhouse cookie only chocolate.

I chose this recipe only because it was the only one I could find with ingredients I had on hand. VERY GOOD! I used butter instead of margarine and pecans instead of walnuts. They do taste a bit like brownies. Chewy and rich!

GREAT cookies! I think the people who have complained might have used low-cholesterol margerines, which are not good for baking. Be sure to look for "Great for Baking!" on the labels, and never use a whipped margerine for cooking. I actually didn't have any baking margerine so I substituted 1/2 cup butter and 3/4 cup butter-flavored shortening. They turned out great! I added some pink Komen Foundation M&Ms into the mix for a little extra color and chocolate. :-)

Pretty great recipe.  I used softened butter and did not chill them, and they turned out well.  Also added some extra vanilla and extra cocoa powder for a fuller chocolate flavor.

Great tasting cookies! They turned out a little flat but personally I like thin cookies. I used butter instead of margarine. I don't know why people were complaining about these cookies. If you keep the batter chilled and I dropped them by the teaspoon onto the tray they turn out perfect. They also slid right off the pan no problem. Helped calm my chocolate craving in a pinch!

So delicious! The only thing I substituted was butter instead of margarine. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND you chill the dough for a while before you bake them. It helped to keep the cookies from spreading too much. Otherwise this recipe is fantastic.

It's too bad that people put such bad reviews because I tried this recipe and it was just perfect for what I wanted! I made them very tiny, about teaspoon sized, and cooked for 7 mins at 350. I then made mint filling and made homemade mint oreo sandwiches. They were PERFECT! They are a little tough to get off the pan but I switched to a metal spatula and that was just fine. Just make sure to leave them on the hot pan for about 2 minutes. Also, they do flatten out so if you put them too big/close together-- then yes they will run together. But mine formed into perfect circles for my oreos! I even refrigerated them (bc of the filling) and they were still chewy! Just watch baking time because I left my last batch on the pan for about 5 mins and they were more dry & crunchy. The rest were perfect baking 7 mins, sitting on pan for 2 mins.

I followed this recipe for the first two batches.  The cookies were amazing but I had to leave them in the oven a lot longer.  They stay moist and delicious though and don't get hard.  I added Andes mints to the other batches.  A-MAZ-ING!

My daughter and a friend wanted some cookies and I had no chocolate chips, so I found this recipe and made the cookies and they loved them, as well as my son and husband. I loved the fact that they were light and low in fat but very flavorable, very good will keep and make again.

I read most of the reviews for this recipe, and agree that chilling the dough first is a good idea.  Most chocolate brownie cookie recipes work better with the dough chilled.  I did cut back the butter that is listed to 3/4 cup this help to make the cookies stand up rather than spread out.  All in all it is a good recipe and the cookies are delicious.

This recipe made beautiful cookies! I used 2 sticks(1 cup) of butter instead of margarine, and baked them for 6.5 minutes and they turned out awesome! Very chocolatey and just the right amount of chewy. I had no problems with them sticking to the pan.

I threw these together last-minute to take to a potluck at work.  They were so quick and easy, and I was able to make them with basic ingredients I had on hand.  One comment I got was that they had "the perfect chocolate flavor."

This recipe is awful. The consistency is nothing like brownies or cookies. I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out like cake batter. The cookies were flaky. "Ungreased cookie sheet" - only if you'd like to peel chunks of cake-cookie off of your baking sheet. Overall, an awful waste of ingredients. I don't recommend.

I just took these out of the oven and had one (ok maybe two) and they are great. They were very easy to make even for a baking novice such as myself and really satisfy the chocolate craving. I used butter instead of margarine since that is what I had on hand and it worked fine.

My family really liked these cookies. I refrigerated the dough about 20 min. before making the balls, lightly sprayed the cookie sheets with no-stick spray and made small balls. I didn't have any problems with sticking or spreading and they were good-looking small round cookies. I actually would like to give these a 4 and a half stars.

Excellent recipe! The secret to getting this cookie right is the temperature of the butter. I did not use margarine. If the butter is to soft you will get a running cookie. If to cold it won't blend. I used a 1 ounce cookie scoop and did not flatten on the pan. They baked up show quality and very pliable.

These cookies were super easy and delicious! After I dropped the dough by spoonfuls onto the ungreased cookie sheet, I added a dollop of peanut butter to each. The peanut butter melted into the cookies as they baked. The final product was amazing! If you like chocolate and peanut butter together, you'll love this recipe!

I gotta say, we liked them. They are great for a chocolate fix. If you aren't watching calories though, don't try them. We however, will make again!

These cookies are very good. They do taste like brownies. I had to chill my batter because once they sat out waiting to to be baked, the batter gets to soft. Do keep them small because they do spread. I love them and they are easy.

I really liked these. I wanted some cookies but didn't have any chocolate chips. I left out the nuts and put a full cup of cocoa powder in them and they are yummy. Almost like a brownie, but not. They turned out perfect. Didn't stick to the greased cookie sheet. I will keep this recipe in the books! **UPDATE** I kept these cookies in a container on the counter and they lasted a long while (I made a lot!). They stayed soft and chewy. Some people said they got better every day! Love these cookies!!

Very tasty but...first batch were very flat and undercooked.  Second batch, cooked 2 minutes longer were a bit better but still too undercooked.  I used one user's tip about cooking for 15 mins and were much better and not quite as flat but were a little crunchy around the outside...just the way I like 'em!  
I read recently that if your baking soda is expired it will cause your cookies to flatten.  I'll try again with some "fresher" baking soda.  Also, here's a great tip:  if your cookies are too crunchy for your liking, put them in a sealed container with a slice of bread and within a day they're perfect!!  The longer they sit in the container, the softer they will become.

i was looking for a fluffy, moist cake or brownie like cookie that wasn't too sweet. perhaps it did TASTE like a brownie, but it definately didn't have the right texture. they came out flatter than i usually like (and i like really big and puffy cookies). they also come out really greasy and were a little too sweet. i don't think i would try this recipe again

I followed the recipe but added peanut butter chips. They came out really good but I wanted more of a peanut butter flavor so I added peanut butter to the last two trays. Oh my goodness, THEY CAME OUT AWESOME!!! So flaky and delicious. I will definitely be making these again.

These cookies came out far better than I ever expected. They were quick and easy, with little to no real clean up. I had about 2 dirty bowls, a few measuring cups and a spoon, so not bad. The batch made about 3 dozen cookies or so, I had rolled them into little 1 inch balls  before baking. I also froze the left over dough for a week and it thawed nicely and baked without issue. Over all these are a new favorite in our household.

There is nothing at all wrong with this recipe—it is an excellent, basic recipe. If you use margarine, use 80% fat margarine, NOT reduced fat margarine.  Butter will,work and give improved flavor, but the butter must also be 80% fat,  not reduced fat.

These are delicious - chocolatey and soft.  I recommend letting them cool on the baking sheet for 10-15 minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack.  They crumble/break a little if you try to move them too soon. But the cooling process kind of glues them back together.

2 stars because I like chocolate and the rest taken away because there's no excuse for wasting money on good ingredients to make a bad recipe. Because that's what this is. Followed it to a t and the first batch were flat and greasy. This is the chocolate equivalent of drinking bacon grease from the pan. I grew up making cookies with so many traditions around them and there are so many good recipes out there, there is no excuse for publishing a bad one. I tried adding more flour for future batches which made it slightly more palatable... But when the five year old rejects a cookie, you know there is something wrong.

These turned out fabulous! They DO taste like brownies, but they didnt stay chewy. It tasted more like the crispy edges of the brownie but its still delicious! They were flat the first batch but I chilled the dough and they didnt flatten out as much. I think the one star ratings are being dramatic, these are amazing!

We absolutely adored these cookies. We added powdered sugar on top, they were pretty rich but if you have a delightful glass of milk handy, they taste superb! 10/10 would recommend! I baked them for my daughters soccer team and they all requested i make them again for next time!

These are so good! I, personally, love edge pan brownies. Anyone who feels the same should make these cookies! They taste more like that than cookies. Piece of advice , I used butter instead of margarine. I know they are supposed to do the same thing but I’m not sure if it changed the taste.

I have never reviewed a recipe before, but, these are so fabulous, I felt the need....I made some modifications, I used butter instead of margarine per many of the reviews and I used dark chocolate unsweetened cocoa powder. I also added dark chocolate chips to the mix . So very good. This recipe is a keeper.

I don’t understand the hate around this recipe! These are SO good and very addictive. Few tips: use parchment paper and do not melt butter, just soften. Delicious, gooey, chocolate cookies that hit the spot!

Love this recipe, I made it with chocolate chips instead of walnuts last time, was extra chocolatey! I may go for half and half next time. Very much like a brownie cookie, if you love chocolate you'll love these!

This was a disappointment.  No way were they like brownies, they spread out terribly, and they no way looked like the picture.  Maybe putting the dough in the refer for half an hour might keep them from spreading out flat.

I used butter instead of margarine, left out the nuts and threw in about 3/4 a cup of semi sweet chips. Chilled the dough between each batch-these were AMAZING. Yes, they fell, and were more like crinkle brownie cookies. Just wonderful.

After reading the reviews, I was reluctant in making these cookeie.  THEY TURNED OUT AWESOME!!!  I did use a SilPat cookie sheet liner while baking and I kept them to a teaspoon drop per each cookie.  Be brave and try to make them before you "write them off."  They are super easy and require minimal ingredients.  They are worth it and I can't wait to take them to a party or cookout this summer.

They taste great, but the cookies came out totally flat. It surprised me because the batter was really thick when I spooned it out. They're definitely chewy and chocolately but way too thin for my liking.

If you could give less than one star I would. I followed the directions exactly provided by allrecipes.com and had choclate ooze all over the inside of my oven. I don't know if the web site gave the wrong amounts or not but it turned out horrible. Then I cleaned out the oven. I still had half a batch of dough left after the first cookie fiasco, so I filled a couple baking tins half way and put them in the oven with hopes of a brownie treat. In five minutes the tins where starting to over flow. Thats my review.

The absolute best!  This recipe was exactly what i was looking for.  It tastes like a brownie, but bakes up like a cookie.  I add peanut butter chips instead of walnuts and my family can't get enough of these cookies.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

My goodness these taste wonderful! I had to let them go for 11 minutes instead of that recommended eight, and then when I went to remove them they were the consistency of pancakes! As I speak the completed cookies are in a huge mass on a plate. Use SMALL teaspon fulls when placing these on your cookie sheet, and as recommended, refrigerate a while before forming into balls. This will assure a plumper cookie. As for chewing, sweet, and satisfying, this recipe is perfect! Make sure you use those walnuts, because they make the flavor perfect!

These were very tasty, but did bake up a bit thin. I rolled them into balls after chilling for a few minutes.  I found 10 mins. baking made these a bit too crunchy, 8 mins. was better.

chips in addition to the walnuts...They
are even better! To keep them moist &
chewy, store in freezer in freezer bags
(if you have any left)

These cookies were great! They were soft, chewy and moist, even the second day! I dropped the dough from a teaspoon and ended up with about twice as many cookies as the recipe indicated. The recipe made about 7-8 dozen 2 inch cookies.

I made sure to do the first set of ingredients in their own bowl then the dry ingredients in a separate one to make the consistency correct. They’re perfect! I followed the recipe completely without anything changed and I made 1 tablespoon size balls and baked for 11 minutes. They came out soooo good. They taste like brownies but they look like cookies. I’d recommend this recipe always, it’s perfect.

Made exactly as the recipe stated. Perfect chewy cookies at 10 minutes then fully cooled.  Made half a batch plain and then added chips to the second half of the dough a few days later. Great results both times. Super easy! This recipe is a keeper!

I made it according to the recipe. They are delicious!!! I liked the fact that mine came out a bit flat. I added peanut butter to some and Nutella to some and made sandwich cookies... Oh my! Fat girl food!!! 
Next we're adding meringue, cool whip or marshmallow cream. The possibilities are endless!!!  Did I mention easy too!!!

These cookies were a mess. I followed the recipe precisely as I am an engineer. The recipe indicated 48 so the batter was divided into 4 and each quarter portioned into 12 cookies. Then while cooking they went flat, ran together and stuck. It was not possible to remove them from the cookie sheet intact. This rating service would not allow a zero star rating.

These are SO easy and simple. Make sure spoonfuls are small because they do spread. Please do NOT remove from the website. When making multiple substitutions, people should know that they may not turn out.

These came out pretty awesome, super light and fluffy, baked fully, and delicious! I would definitely recommend... I don't get what the 1-star reviews are talking about (maybe they melted the butter instead of creamed it with the sugar?) I think these are great!

Substituted butter for margarine and only had about 1/2 c of cocoa. Still came out great. They did flatten a lot but I had used small spoonfuls so that wasn't much of an issue. Made peanut butter sandwiches out of about half of them.

They definately have a "brownie" softness.  I added chocolate and peanut butter chips.  Would love to try this recipe but with different flavors.. apple cinnamon instead of chocolate perhaps... mmm

The only change  I made was no nuts. I used Andees miniature chocolate mint pieces instead. Yummy. So soft.

I'm 38 and I haven't EVER made cookies in my entire life. I scraped up the ingredients here in Taiwan and was close but not quite exact. I substituted 1/4 cup coconut oil for the last remaining 1/4 cup of butter and it was BOMB. They were chewy as hell. I also used Pecans instead of Walnuts. All my co-workers raved about the cookies. I'll be revisiting this recipe with slight adjustments in the future!

Easy and yummy! I made these for a Christmas party when I was out of chocolate chips. I only had butter on hand, so I substituted that for margarine. I'm at >5,000 ft, but the altitude didn't seem to affect the recipe. I used a measuring teaspoon to measure them, which made them about half the size the recipe called for. Given the smaller size, I baked them at 175 C (350F) for 8 mins 30 seconds, then removed them from the oven and allowed them to cool for 2 mins on the pan before moving them. They turned out simple but tasty, remaining chewy even after they'd cooled. The smaller measure yielded about 90 five cm (slightly under 2") cookies. Everyone at the party loved them just as they were, although I do think some mini semi-sweet chocolate chips or some white chocolate chips could have enhanced them too.

A recipe from home ec in middle school called for an additional 2tbsp of cocoa, added that. Decided to forego the walnuts.
Have added to previous batches, chocolate chips and marshmallows (halfway through baking or after completion).

Very chocolatey and a bit brownie-like.  The dough seemed too dry but I rolled it up in balls and baked and they came out fine.  The family loved them and that is what counts, right?

Really good. Mine spread thin, so we had crisp edges and chewy middle. I added 1/2 tsp peppermint extract. Definitely a keeper.

Very good.  I used butter flavor shortening to prevent excessive spreading and that worked well, but the flavor wasn't as buttery as I like.  Will likely do 1/2 and 1/2 next time.  Baked for about 10 minutes; might try 9 next time for a bit more chewiness.

I used butter instead of margarine (salted butter, since we don’t have unsalted butter at the moment, so I omitted the salt, as well). My first batch came out extremely soft, flimsy, and thin, so I followed others’ advice and chilled the cookies before baking. I prefer crunchy cookies, so I ended up cooking later batches for 13-14 minutes. They still ended up thin (nothing necessarily wrong with that!), but were crunchier and sturdier. They were still moist and perfectly chocolate-y. Definitely a good go-to recipe to fix a chocolate craving!

i make them almost every weekend for my peers teachers and soemtimes strangers. they're the easiest cookies ever, and they're delicious. everytime i make them everyone asks for "my recipe" and i say its a secret haha. everyone always asks for seconds. i made them tonight for a potluck and it took less than an hour to tri ple the recipe and cook them all. they taste great and the work is minimal. just dont box them until they're 100% cooled or they will get soggy.

These were so easy and delicious! I added The new Nestle toll house peppermint truffle chips, used real butter and omitted the nuts. The dough was very soft, I used my small cookie scoop, and dipped it in powdered sugar to help the dough release from the scoop.

We chilled the dough in the fridge for an hour but other than that, followed the recipe exactly...amazing cookie!  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.  We have also tried this with a peanut butter cup in it or a candy cane Hershey kiss, both were delicious.

Good basic recipe.  I made some improvements. No offense to Ms Wells.
1. Forget margarine; who even uses this vile oleo anymore. Walnuts are bitter, almonds are better. Premium cocoa is very important.  To make this recipe a cookie to remember Substitute:
1/2 c unsalted butter (softened)
1/2 c raw cocoa butter (melted)
1/4 c organic coconut oil (softened)
3 eggs (large) room temp
Additional 1/2 tsp almond extract
3/4 c Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder
Lightly toasted slivered almonds 
Mix with stand mixer with whisk attachment; work from lower speed to incorporate your ingredients to a higher speed at the end to add volume; it's more of a light dough at this point; gently but thoroughly fold in the almonds with a rubber spatula and portion on lightly greased parchment lined sheet pan with a one once scoop; a nice rounded scoop will produce 18 beautiful cookies.  Now, instead of having to admit you ate 5 of the original recipe, you can now declare you only had two! They are done when there is no visible bulge from the ball shaped scoop, they will be nicely rounded cushions. 
Bake time should be 10-12 minutes on these.
Leslie, Thank you for this buildable template for incredibly elegant chewy chocolate cookies.

This is a solid recipe with just the right amount of cocoa powder for a rich chocolate taste. I used butter instead of margarine because I never have margarine, I doubled the salt, and added semi-sweet chocolate chips as a fun add, although these would have been great without.

LOVE this recipe! They have a great taste, very similar to a chocolate brownie, and the texture is almost exactly like the chewy Chips Ahoy cookies. I cut the ingredients listed in half and still ended up with 24 regular sized cookies. My only tip would be to chill the dough for about 30 minutes to make it less sticky and easier to work with.

I have made these cookies twice now.  I baked them for 20 minutes each time to get them done.  They spread and spread so I will be cutting them to have a cookie.  They are good, but something needs to be adjusted.

I didn't have any chocolate chips so I thought I would try this recipe! It did not disappoint! I substituted butter for margarine and didn't use walnuts. They were a hit with my husband and I hope it will be at the cookie social also! Made about four dozen cookies for me

Just made these.  Followed the recipe exactly - turned out great!  Will be my go-to chocolate fix from now on.   It would seem that "donut"  of "most helpful negative" has nothing better to do than trash a recipe and bring down the "stars" of a very good recipe.

Will definitely make these again.  I used butter instead of margarine because that's what I had.  Read a couple reviews that said to chill the dough before scooping so I chilled it for about 10 minutes and it they didn't spread too much at all.  Also used a small cookie scoop instead of a spoon and it made perfectly shaped smallish cookies.  I didn't add walnuts (didn't have any) but I did add milk chocolate chips.  These really do taste just like brownies.  My whole family (and the neighbors) loved them!

Great recipe for a chocolate craving. Not too sweet, not too chocolately. Just right!! 
The instructions should mention: 
1)Mix the egg/sugar/vanilla separately from the powdery ingredients, mix the powdery ingredients in a separate bowl, then combine powdery ingredients gradually. 
2) grease parchment paper and put on a baking sheet, keep the dough small and ball it up, and give a little press onto the sheet. 
3)Put prepared sheet + cookies in fridge 5-10 min before baking. I baked for 15 min. 
4) LET COOL!! Slide the cookie+parchment paper off of the baking sheet to let it cool completely. No mess !

I used butter instead-- and melted it for more chewiness, but then seemed too soft; I added a bit more flour until I got the texture I liked. That should solve some issues other reviewers were having about it being too flat and runny. The other alternative is cooling the dough first.

Super easy recipe to follow, they came out great! I used butter instead of margarine. No issues with then being flat or doughy. Tasted great, and were definitely soft bake cookies!

Are you kidding me? Cut the recipe in half and glad I did. Followed the recipe exactly. Chilled the dough as well. Garbage. Used a cookie scooper and made them perfect. Before they baked. The whole pan was covered in a big uneven cookie. They flattened to almost nothing on the outer half. Middle half was jiggly and needed more time.  Couldn't add more time as other half would burn. Taste was good but not presentable in any means. This was a joke

I swapped out the walnuts for caramel chips and added a caramel drizzle and they turned out great! They didn’t spread out too much but did flatten out enough (but I think that really depends on how big the dough balls start out as). A perfect mix of chewy inside and crunchy outside

I subbed out the eggs for flax eggs (allergy) and reduced sugar to 1.5 cups and added stevia drops to taste. They turned out very very well. Next round I'm going to sub out sugar with xylitol/stevia. I will also be trying these with carob powder instead of cocoa (allergies).

I followed the directions and the batter was more like a cake batter than cookie dough. It says to drop by tsp. but it's just a runny mess... I don't get this recipe at all.

I made nutritional changes that worked. Instead of 2 cups white flour, I used 1 cup gluten free flour and 1 cup regular. Then 1 c organic palm sugar and 1/3 cup white sugar instead of two cups white sugar. I used 1cup melted coconut oil and 4T butter instead of 1 1/2 cups margarine. I had to flatten the dough balls a bit before baking. Cookie is a bit crumbly, but a little less guilt for me :)

I will admit I substitute a few things which probably did not help the recipe and I was also pretty drugged up from a surgery a few days before but I enjoyed making them and they did have a nice taste to them but they weren't very pretty and not how I expected.

I stuck to the recipe. They are very delicious, but there is a learning curve on how to make them. I did my first batch without chilling the dough. I used parchment paper in my pan. I used fairly small balls of dough. This batch actually turned out better than expected. My second batch the only difference is I chilled the dough for about 8 minutes. These took a few minutes longer to bake so keep that in mind and they still looked cakey but they look really good after cooling.

I followed the recipe exactly except substituted butter for margarine.  I find using real butter works much better.  The cookies turned out perfect.  They don't look like the picture - much flatter as many have mentioned - but tasty!  I didn't refrigerate the dough and I used parchment paper, as I almost always do when baking.  There is not a problem with the recipe.  It's great.

The mixture was too soupy to make cookies. I poured it into a cake pan, and it needed to cook twice as long as the recipie called for, about 20 minutes. I wasn't sure how it would come out, but it was good. Sort of a cakey-brownie. The 3 stars is for the recipe not turning out right, I'd give it another star for the yummy brownies.

Very fine cookies.  I did, however, use butter.  I mean, these aren't a health food, so why use the inferior-flavored margarine instead of butter?  I do not understand anyone who bakes cookies or cakes with margarine.  I didn't have the problem with them spreading as other people did, and I feel like the wide variance of oils used and water content of "margarine" is the culprit behind the issue there.  Peeps, just use butter.  Or like at least use a stick margarine, not the tub stuff.  That should help.

These cookies tasted awesome but I will say the texture was softer than expected. Almost like brownies. Which is not a bad thing. The only change or alteration that I made was that I added 1-1/2 tsp of espresso powder. These cookies are awesome with ice cream! Great recipe I will make again!

These cookies are fabulous! I exchanged butter for margarine and everything else was the same. I wanted very large cookies(4") and they turned out just perfect! I'm not sure why other reviewers had so much trouble. I used and ice cream scoop to place the dough on the cookie sheet and flattened with my hand. I didn't chill the dough. Don't be afraid of the bad reviews! Go for it! They are worth it!

These did not turn out well for me. They were chewy, but flattened out and came out very thin and flimsy, and not cooked all the way through even after a full 10 minutes. The flavor was not what I was expecting either. Overall I found these disappointing and I would not make them again.

Followed it but only had butter on hand. The flour was too much compared to the sweetness. I should have rolled them in sugar before baking. They sure were not chewy. Not happy with these hmmm. Maybe I did something wrong..

I made these with my 6 year old daughter who LOVES chocolate. We added chocolate chips to make it extra chocolaty! They turned out delicious. I used parchment paper so they wouldn’t stick. And I only had one egg so we just made half a recipe. Yummy

This is a simple and easy cookie recipe. It took me less than an hour (I had guests coming over). It impressed everyone and tasted equally so. 
I used 1 cup butter instead of margarine and added one and half cup sugar and half cup brown sugar. Also, I added a pinch of instant coffee powder with the flour mixture which enhanced the chocolate taste. 
Well, the whole batch got over in no time :-)

I used butter instead of margarine. I chilled the dough for about 30 minutes, rolled into balls and coated in powdered sugar to make a crinkle cookie. This is an easy, delicious recipe. Had all ingredients on hand. Cookies were a hit for everyone in my house who have differing opinions on what a cookie should be. I had no issues with sticking like some reviews indicate. I always bake on a stone. Highly recommended!

Added another -just under- 1/4 cup of cocoa and tried 3 sizes of cookie. Best was 1 1/2 tsp. Ungreased sheets. Any bigger and the center fell out while cooling on the rack and was doughy not soft. Smaller was good too, but family prefers bigger than bite size ;) . 
Tip: make sure the butter is softened by mircowaving at 20 sec intervals and whisking in between. Then do the creaming. Also used pure cane sugar, which is more granulated and not over processed. 
Great cookies!

Cookies tasted great, almost like bite sized brownies or a muffin top. Had no issue with cookies being too thin. Whether the dough was chilled or room temperature they still cooked the same. Will be making them again.

At first when I put the butter and sugar together, I was astonished at how much there was! I hadn’t looked at the serving size but I had assumed it was standard 24-28 cookies. The more the married though! I made the cookies a little bigger than anticipated in the end, because I only had so much space on my cookie sheets. I would highly reccomend this recipe! The chocolatey cookies are very tasty and the walnuts are a nice touch, but the cookies won’t be boring without them. My only reccomendation is that you bake the cookies for a little longer, maybe 12-15 minutes until the edges are firm. My cookies were practicaly raw after cooking for 10 minutes! It may have just been their size though. Overall I highly reccomend this recipe, it’s delicious.

If you’re subbing butter, only use 1 cup. If you’re not using nuts, you need to either add more flour, or sub in another moisture-absorbing addition such as raisins or coconut shreds. If you don’t understand your ingredients and how they work, then don’t tweak a recipe. Margerine has thickeners and coagulation agents that obviously help hold things together better. Similarly, coconut oil in cookies doesn’t spread as much. Butter spreads. So understand this. My cookies using 1 cup butter, and 1 cup shredded coconut turned out absolutely perfectly. Amazing texture and flavour. Just like a brownie. 

Know your ingredients before you tweak peeps!!

These soft cookies are rich and delicious! 
I substituted coconut oil for the margarine and left out the walnuts. While the coconut oil seems to have created a flavour that I believe one individual described as nutty, these cookies were still a delectable treat! Next time I might try adding dried cranberries.

I don't know why this recipe got any negative reviews. I followed the recipe exactly (except I used butter instead of margarine) and they were perfect! At 8 minutes of baking they were still pretty gooey, but held together once cooled completely. I prefer mine a bit more crisp so I baked for 10-11 minutes. So delicious!! Crisp outside, chewy inside, and perfect chocolate flavor!

These are brownies in the shape of cookies. They're good though! They won't crumble as long as you keep the ratios correct. After mixing, you will get a brownie-like batter, and that is completely fine! Mine came out great at 10 minutes. Thanks!

These taste good but I think it has too much butter.  The cookies take a while to be hard enough to take off the cookie sheet.  And they leave your fingers greasy.

Delicious! I substituted butter for margarine and added 2 tbsp of milk. 
They turned out chewy with a crispy edge that was so so so good! I finished by dusting them with a bit of powdered sugar.

I used a special "black" cocoa powder from my family's favorite Amish store and it made the cookies "black" as well. They taste amazing and it was very aesthetically pleasing, I suggest using dark cocoa.

This cookie was the perfect addition to my Christmas cookies! I didn’t have walnuts so I added chocolate chips instead and they turned out amazing. I was able to make 30+ decent medium/large cookies with this recipe.

Big hit! I used butter instead of margerine and used a teaspoon scoop (so, about two teaspoons per drop). This recipe made 4 dozen plus two cookies.

I put Ghirarderlli pepermint chunks in it and it was delicious. I chilled the batter for 10-15 minutes and used 1 1/4 cup of butter instead of margarine. I was very satisfied with the end result. I only made the cookies about a teaspoon of batter on the pan, but they turned out to be a great size. I would definitely recommend this recipe and will be using it again.

I made this using vegan butter for my husband’s dairy allergy and they turned out great! Couple of things, to the people that these turned out flat, make sure your butter is soft not melted, and chilling the dough for 30 min also helps keep them nice and cookie shaped. I didn’t use walnuts but instead semi-sweet chocolate chips and topped them with a little sea salt to cut the richness. They were a HUGE hit!

Love these! I saw the reviews that said the cookies spread and so I turned this into a cookie bar/brownie instead of forming cookies and it was perfection. I use it a few times a week as snack for my lunch program at school and the kids are always asking for more. The only thing I changed was baking it for 2-3 min longer.

These cookies are the best I've ever made. The recipe is so easy to follow and the cookies turned out so moist. I did remove the walnuts because I dislike them. Added gheradelis peppermint chips and baked for 10 min. Perfect cookies and family loves them.

Used 1/2 butter, 1/2 butter-flavored Crisco. It goes back to my southern grandmother telling me that cookies won’t flatten if you substitute 1/2 shortening for the butter.

For the individuals who did not have success with this recipe, make sure you use parchment paper! Also, if you want chewy fudgy cookies then bake them less (8 minutes). When they come out of the oven, let them rest a good bit before you put them on a cooling rack or they will fall apart. Also, these cooking times are for relatively small cookies (I used a regular spoon to measure dough, came out maybe 2 inches in diameter after cooking). If you want huge cookies, I would definitely cook them more like 10 to 12 minutes depending on your oven.

Had to make cookies at the last minute with what I had available— subbed 1 cup coconut oil and 1/4 butter for margarine, whole wheat all purpose flour, and dark chocolate cocoa powder, and added some coconut flakes on top. Baked on parchment paper. Came out awesome!

Sickening sweet. I am not a sweets person, so we will see what others say. Space them way out, they spread quite far and most of mine ran together. used 2 different pans, my copper chef worked very nice, but, Wilton no stick, stuck slightly and cracked when they baked.

I had an unopened can of unsweetened cocoa and no idea what to do with it.  I googled " cocoa cookie recipes" and took a chance .  The first couple required some unusual ingredients (yogurt?  Didn't have any, and if I did, it would have been flavored).  This was the first recipe that didn't require a trip to the grocery store.  The ingredients were basic staples I had in my baking drawer...the cocoa was the most exotic thing needed.

The instructions were clear and simple.  I lined the cookie sheets with parchment paper because I am lazy and using parchment paper means I don't have to clean greasy cookie sheets.  The cookies slid off beautifully.  They weren't chewy, but instead very light and crisp, which I prefer.  In the interest of full disclosure, I should admit that I didn't have 1 1/4 cup margarine.  Maybe a trip to the store was in order after all.  I used a stick of butter (I prefer butter to margarine in baking) and added 3/4 cup of canola oil.  As soon as I finish this review, I will write this recipe down on  3x5 card and put it in my recipe box (including the butter and canola oil substitution). This one is a keeper.  Both kids loved it.  My husband isn't home yet, but I doubt these cookies will still be here in two days.  These are great.  Easy and quick to make and they only require what is usually in my kitchen anyway.  This is definitely a "whip up some cookies on a whim" recipe.

I used unsalted butter instead of margarine and measured the flour by scooping into measuring cup and leveling off with knife.  I used parchment paper to line the cookie sheets.  Cookies came out perfectly.  They taste like brownies, only lighter.  Will definitely make again.

Very good. I substituted butter for margarine and left out the walnuts (i honestly hate them). I used a small cookie dough scoop to get even cookies. 

I will say I had to nearly double the cooking time. I don't know if the recipe maker has a super oven or if my oven just needs work, but in 10 minutes my cookies came out as dough. 

My first batch came out very very flat. I chilled the second batch and ended up with a flakier cookie that's airy and puffy--the way i like it! The next time I make these I'm definitely adding marshmallows and an extra pinch of baking soda though! 

They also look cute with a bit of confectioners sugar sprinkled on top. Fun cookie, very sweet, and a little more original than a plain chocolate chip.

Oh my goodness!! What a mess these made. I was looking for a simple, good recipe to make with what I had in the cupboard. I did every single thing step by step just like the recipe said. I ended up throwing the whole batch in the garbage. They spread out flat as a pancake on the cookie sheet and just made a huge blob of a mess. I'm not one to complain, but I really feel this recipe needs to be taken off of here. I made the mistake of not reading the reviews first but if I had, I definitely would have skipped this recipe as there are several others that have said the same thing about them making a huge blob of a mess. What a waste of ingredients to have to throw in the garbage.

Horrible recipe. Did everything the recipe asked and ended up with a blob of uncooked hot dough. Note that I left it in the oven for over thirty minutes and it didn’t even slightly cook.

Cookies did taste like brownies and weren't so messy.  They broke easily so I will add 1T more flour next time to keep them from spreading out so much.  
Great! Sue B.

This recipe DID NOT Work. They came out way too flat, and I couldn't even get them off the the cookie sheet without breaking them. Even when I chilled the dough  in the fridge, they still came out flat and were still a pain to get off the sheet even when it was greased. Please note I followed the recipe exactly.

I wouldn't exactly call these cookies "chewy"... they're basically just brownies in the shape of cookies. They also don't expand the same way that cookies do.

These are the best chocolate cookies I have ever made.  They are like brownies, soft and chewy.  I like to add chocolate chips and I used dark chocolate in place of milk chocolate.

Replaced the margarine for butter and voila! They baked for 10 mins and came out perfectly chewy with a little crunch on the outside. Truly tastes like a brownie :)

I followed the directions exactly and they were fantastic, just like a brownie. They were really simple to make, this will definitely be my go-to chocolate cookie. One suggestion, I always bake cookies on silicone baking liners, My cookies came off the pan perfectly!  Yeah, they're flat. So what?

I followed the directions exactly and at 8 minutes, they were burnt. They also were flatter than a pancake! I finally cooked a batch at 6 minutes, they were still overdone and flat.

I never make cookies with margarine so butter was used... I’m thinking they should of been chilled or more flour.. On the cookie sheet they got really big and I had to cook them for about 5 mins more.. I’m making the next batch in a pan like brownies.. may be safer as now my oven has cookie drippings on the bottom..Most were not done and still gooey...

Made this recipe once with walnuts & second time using chocolate chips instead.  Very tasty.  I will be making this recipe again.  I needed to adjust baking time slightly by adding 2 mins, but that is because of my oven.

I read all the reviews and, nervous because of some 1 star reviews and I'm no baker, I cut the recipe in half-ish. I never use margarine so I used butter. I used less than half of the suggested butter because other reviewers said they were more successful with less butter. I added more cocoa because a reviewer said that's a good thing. I used sunflower oil as a light, very light, wipe on the cookie baking tray. (it's the best oil for frying hot and I thought that might help keep the cookies from absorbing more oil) My cookies are delicious and not flat at all. They didn't spread or stick on the tray. I did not refrigerate the first batch because the batter felt pretty stiff but I noticed as I got to the end it was getting sticky so I put the batter in the fridge for the next run. Because the batter was stiff, I was able to roll each cookie into a tight ball. I let them cook for about 8 minutes and I let them sit for a minute or two on the tray to cool. They slid on the tray as soon as I pushed against them with the spatula. I was able to pick them right up off the tray and they are fat and beautiful! They taste like chewy, chocolatey, brownies! I will never buy a boxed cookie or brownie kit, again!! I wish I could show a picture in this review.
1 cube of butter
1 cup of sugar
1 egg
1 tsp vanilla
1 cup of flour
1/2 cup dark cocoa powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/16 tsp salt
2/3 cup chopped mixed nuts

Followed recipe exactly and they came out great! Moist and chewy, great chocolate flavor. Just added a dusting of confectionery sugar. The cookie dough does spread, so two inches between cookies is good. Highly recommend!

I halved this recipe and substituted 1 low-fat cottage cheese single-serving cup (equals about 1/2 cup) plus 2 tablespoons butter for what would have been 5/8 cup soft margarine.  They were chewy and GREAT tasting!  That's 178 calories rather than 458 if all margarine had been used.  I don't like walnuts so I left them out as well which is another +/- 400 calories removed.  I'll make these again that way when I need a not-too-naughty chocolate fix.  Didn't chill the batter but that can help with this non-doughy type batter -- I always use non-stick foil because I'm too lazy to wash a cookie sheet.  :-)  I made them big and they came out nice and raised and cracked on top like brownies.

Omg literally made an account just to talk about how good these turned out. I used vegetables oil and it worked out fine. I also didn't have any walnut. This recipe is easy. I think the key is to not leave it in the oven for more than ten minutes. Very good. Try it!!!

What a great recipe. 
I substituted  margarine with Butter and white sugar with brown sugar. I also chilled in the fridge for 30 minutes and scooped them on... they seemed to hold their shape by doing that.

My family loved these cookies! I didn’t have nuts,so I added some chocolate chips, then I sprinkled sugar over them before baking. Yummy.

Best Gluten Free Cookies! I made these for our Gluten free family using the Namaste Foods Gluten Free Flour and they turned out amazing!! They taste like chewy moist brownies!! My husband said I shouldn't tell people their GF because nobody would know otherwise. Their the best cookies we have come across in receipt or store. super quick and easy!! 
A few adjustments though: 1.5 C sugar, GF Flour, mix melted butter in with sugar fully before  mixing in other ingredients, and bake for 12-14 min. Leave them really moist in center when removing from oven to finish cooking on table. Moist and chewy! You won't regret making these!!!

These cookies were terrible. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out flat and slightly burnt. They all oozed onto each other and just tasted awful. Should have checked the reviews first. We had to throw everything out. What a waste.

I felt I needed to leave them in the oven longer than the recommended time.  Since they are a dark cookie it is difficult to tell when they are done. But oh so yummy!

Great recipe! I substituted peanut butter chips for the walnuts and what would you know, this same recipe was on their bag! These cookies come out chewy and perfect but will crumble if you try taking them off the tray before completely cool.

I halved this recipe and it made about 3 dozen normal-sized cookies (the raw size was about the size of a 3/4 - 1" ball, about 2" apart). I used 1/2 cup + 2Tb real butter (no shortening) and 1/2 cup cocoa (more chocolatey that way!).  I did chill the dough while the oven preheated, and put it back in the fridge in between cooking each batch. I used parchment paper, and the cookies came off very easily. 
I wanted these to be flat and chewy, so when I pulled them out of the oven, I kind of let the cookie sheet plop down on the counter, and they deflated automatically.
These were not overly sweet, and had a nice cocoa flavor. As someone else pointed out, they taste like the chewy edges of a pan of brownies. They are not, however, brownie-like... I thought they held their own as a very good chocolate cookie. Mine all turned out pretty too... could be taken as a housewarming, potluck, or given as a gift.

These cookies are so good! I used 1/2 cup shortening and 3/4 cup butter. I also lined my cookie sheet with non-stick foil. I let them cool on the cookie sheet for a few minutes and then slid the foil onto my cooling rack. When they we’re completely cool they slid right off the foil. I saved the foil to use on the next batch. These would be good as ice cream sandwiches or whoppie pies! Will try that next time!

Just like a brownie! My cookies weren't flat and did not crumble. The only changes I did make was i used baking powder instead of soda and I cooked 6 cookies at a time and put the dough into the fridge in between . They were chewy, chocolatey and so yummy!

Really excellent flavor!  Soft and chewy, and reminiscent of a brownie.  However, the recipe as stated will result in cookies that won't hold up or spread out far, far too much. Some simple changes: Use butter instead of margarine, and only use 1 cup. Add 2 extra tablespoons of flour.   Use parchment paper to prevent sticking,  and use a cookie scoop for perfectly round cookies.  DEFINITELY chill the dough between batches. When I made it the second time with those changes, I had an excellent cookie!

I used butter and the first batch of cookies went all flat. The flavour was good but the consistency was not. I added another whole cup of flour and half a teaspoon baking soda and that seemed to do the trick.

These came out pretty decent! I uses margerine  and I added a little bit of cinnamon. Which added to the smooth and mild cocoa flavor. The cookie does sprea while it bakes, but they are nice and plump. I had no issues with getting it out of the cookie sheet. Could be because I used margerine instead of butter, which gives you more slip.  But they are delicate, so be careful. I  wouldn't say this cookie is for chocolate lovers, its not going to caln your chocolate addicted heart. But if you want something that is more mild on the sweetness, then this cookie would be great. I would even pair it with tea or the like.

I had a happy little accident while making these. I got impatient and melted the margarine with the sugar, but for the most part followed the recipe (added a bit of instant coffee but that's normal). Ended up with cookie-shaped brownies, and while they were somewhat stuck to the sheet (which left the sheet a bit messy), they ended up delicious. 10/10 would make at 4:00 AM again.

This recipe was great.... just not for cookies. All the times I tried to make this batch off cookies, something went wrong, the cookies got stuck to the pan, weren't cooked through, some sort of mess up. But then I decided to pour the batter in a brownie pan and it worked great! The brownies were delicious and cooked well! I suspect the reason the cookies would have "tasted just like brownies" is because it is a brownie recipe

These were DELICIOUS, even after cutting the sugar in half! I also used butter and dropped rounded teaspoon-full dough onto a greased tray. They made little rounded brownie bite cookies.  Next time I will be more generous with the size and probably flatten them a bit so they aren't dome-like. I did not chill the dough beforehand. I don't know how people got flat cookies. These were packed with chocolate and marvelous!

I didn't want to rate this recipe too harshly but I knew something was wrong with the recipe once I saw the finished batter. It is not the  consistency of cookie batter, waaay too thin. Instead I made cupcakes which turned out delicious. Although they did fall in the middle which was fine for me since I put a scoop of ice cream on top.

Loved it! Very easy, and absolutely delicious! Will definitely make again. I  seriously doubt the cooking ability of anyone who gave this one star. I used butter that was only slightly softened, so they weren't flat. I also cooked them a little less, about 6-7 minutes. Also, I added dark chocolate chips and toasted walnuts. It did make about 40 cookies, but I'm not complaining about the little things. Delicious and easy, 5 stars!

Edit: a lot of people say that they were too messy, if you let them cool on a wire rack for about 10 minutes they should be a little better.

Excellent! Just what I was in the mood for. I used a cup of butter instead of margarine, but otherwise stayed with the recipe. Sometimes at the altitude here (8400 feet) there are problems with baking...not with these. Saludos de Cuenca, Ecuador.

I've made these twice and both times they were terrific. First time I added yogurt morsels and dried cranberries. Second time I just omitted the nuts. Both times I used oil infused with 7grams of marijuana. Two birds with one stone! Love this recipe!

Delicious! I cut the recipe yield in half. I did not have vanilla, I added a dash of original soy milk to add some moistness, and used only a half cup of  sugar. I chilled the dough for about an hour, then baked for the minimum amount of time on an ungreased cookie sheet. They are dense, soft and chewy, and like a brownie. Great recipe!

I think whoever said these cookies were horrible really screwed it up somehow because I mad them and they were definitely not super thin and running together at all. My only thing is I would add chocolate chips but I didn't have chocolate chips and that's why I chose this recipe! But I think chocolate chips would be an optional way to make this recipe so much tastier.

Was having a serious chocolate craving and found this recipe.  Love it!  My son is allergic to nut so we left out the walnuts and added white chocolate chips.  I used my Pampered  chef medium scoop and put the dough in the freezer for about 15 minutes before baking and baked them for 12 minutes.  They were perfectly cooked and not flat at all

I only had almonds so I used those instead of walnuts. Still tasty. And everyone said they tasted like brownie cookies. Not too sweet. I wish I would have blended the almonds instead of just chopping them. I think that would have been good. Not 5 stars because they weren't the best cookies ever but they were pretty good.

I didn't read through the recipe before combining ingredients.  I put all dry ingredients in a bowl and wet plus margarine in small bowl. I moved wet to larger bowl to accommodate all mixing and added dry slowly mixing low setting till mixed through. They still turned out perfectly. My cookie sheets worked perfectly, no sticking and I used no oil or parchment. I too was looking for an easy chocolate cookie fix and these delivered.

These are very chewy fudgy chocolate cookies. The taste  and texture are  fabulous! Mine spread too thin while baking though so when I make them next time I will increase the amount of baking soda to 1.5 tsp or maybe even double it to 2 tsp.

Great recipe. Everyone raves about the "brownie cookies". I've put chocolate chips, peanut butter chips or mini peanut butter cups in them all to equally favorable reviews. This is a winner!

Pretty good. 
Made the first batch without nuts and it was pretty thin like they say. 
I added a cup of peanut-butter and chilled the dough. 
Still came out fairly thin but way better. 
Also added another 1/4 cup of both coco and sugar.

Yum! These were easy breezy to make and super delicious. I used butter instead of margarine (simply because I didn't have any margarine) and they turned out great. The definitely spread out, I only put 6 per cookie sheet.  I will definitely make these again.

These are terrible, flat and unappealing, not chewy.  I think they either need to be chilled or use less butter.  I will honestly just use another recipe with less sugar and less butter.  I didn't care for these at all.

These cookies were awesome!  I made two changes. I put in 1/2 cup of butter flavored Crisco with one half cup of butter instead of all butter, and I omitted the 1/4 cup. The cookies baked up quite nicely, chewy, and did not spread too much. I also did not chill the dough.

I used butter instead of margarine, and I also added 2 oz. of melted  unsweetened baking chocolate to the butter sugar mixture. They weren't very chewy but they were delicious. I made "whoopy pies" by sandwiching cream cheese frosting between them. Excessively indulgent? Yes. Would I do it again? Definitely.

These are awesome!  I live in Florida where it's humid even when it's not, so I usually add extra flour to my baking recipes, including this time.  Just enough to stiffen the dough a little, about a 1/2 cup more +/-.   Also, I use non GMO cane sugar instead of plain white sugar. Delish!   So soft, like little brownies.   Made a batch 2 days ago, family ate a bunch along with the neighbors, didn't last a whole day.  Today is Christmas Eve, and I'm making more now!  I highly recommend this recipe!

Great cookies but took a lot longer to bake than 8-10 minutes. I added chocolate chips to my dough and I thought that really perfected the recipe. I would most likely make them again.

I'm giving these a 5 for taste, but I'd give a lower rating for looks. Though, it's likely my own "fault", as I chose to substitute butter for the margarine it called for. 

I swapped these ingredients one-for-one, and maybe I should have modified it as some other commenters did, but using a portion of butter and a portion of canola oil. Mine came out flat and unattractive, and they spread out a LOT. I'm not a cook or a baker, so not sure what exactly to recommend.  I did make the dough the day before, (double the recipe for  a Christmas cooking-making party) and made them into logs so I could slice them easily. Everyone LOVED the taste, though.

I don't like walnuts, but I didn't make this for me, I made it for my husband. I misread the ingredients and did a 1 teaspoon of cocoa and I didn't have enough white sugar, so I used a cup of brown sugar, and everything turned out great! Except it wasn't truly chocolate, which was okay.  If I liked walnuts and could taste it, this would probably get a 5. Though I did taste the dough before the walnuts, and it was delicious.

I was a little skeptical at first because the "dough" was not firm at all, it was more of a mix between a batter and a dough. After cooking them though, the flavor is great. It is almost like a brownie when it comes to flavor. But (now here is why it got four instead of five stars), they are VERY flat. Like pancake flat. I tried using baking powder instead of soda hoping that they would rise but even that didn't work. Overall, if you are looking for something with a good appearance, you might want to look elsewhere but if you're like me and just looking for a chocolate fix, these are great.

Perfect brownie cookie, soft inside with the chewy edges. I added 6 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate chips in addition to all the other chocolate! Taste like the double chocolate brownie cookies the local bakery makes. Need a glass of milk with these! Let cool on the pan for a minute and get them off with a thin spatula to a cooling rack. You could also make a pan cookie with this recipe I would think. For those of you who had problems with spreading during baking, you need to chill the dough overnight for best results.

I added a couple  tablespoons of peanut butter instead of the walnuts (not a huge fan), then I popped the batter in the freezer for 10 minutes so that it really firmed up before using a tablespoon to blob the batter very roughly (no shaping or flattening) onto a baking sheet greased with butter. They turned out moist, chunky and spread out  the perfect amount! So quick and easy too :)

Really is a delicious cookie. Just like brownies. I have made this a couple times now and will be again tomorrow. 

The key to perfect cookies is the roll the dough into a big log and chill for a few hours in the fridge. Then cut and place on cookie sheet to bake. I've added about 7 drops of peppermint essential oil to my last batch and they were heavenly. Really really good.

I have made these cookies countless times and they have never failed to satisfy! Their brownie-like texture and rich chocolate flavour make them a perfect "milk and cookies" evening treat!

Love these cookies! I added a teaspoon of instant espresso powder and used pecans instead of walnuts! Will be baking these for the family this Thanksgiving! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

These turned out fantastic! They are hard to remove from the pan but only because they are soooo soft.  I baked for an extra five minutes and let them sit for awhile on the pan for easier removal.  I added MINT chocolate chips, soooo delicious!

Delicious!  I used butter, not margarine, and they turned into chunks of chewy chocolaty goodness.  The walnuts added a good texture.  Since they spread a fair bit for me, I'd put them at least two inches apart and refrigerate before baking for 9 to 10 minutes.  Once again, delicious!

Easy to make and bake. Perfect when craving a chocolate cookie. 

I discovered as I was assembling ingredients I didn't have butter. I substituted margarine which made the chewy part of this recipe cook right out. Other than that it changed nothing. Still made a delicious but crunchy cookie. Next time I am sure they'll be even more awesome.

I replaced 1 of the 2 cups of sugar with 1 cup of ground walnuts in my vitamix.  (2 cups of sugar is too much)
Also, instead of 1 cup of chopped walnuts, I used 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts and 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.
Amazing!

After reading about the flatness and other problems, I adjusted the ingredients. I really want to sell this cookie in my shop, so I need a good shape and hardy cookie for taking home. My cookies turned out perfect! Not at all flat. 
I changed: butter- 100 g (one stick), sugar- 260 g, flour- 260 g, cocoa- 100 g
I rolled 40 g balls in my hand, and pressed to make a bit flat. Baked for 15 minutes!

They were very tasty but you may want to replace the baking soda with baking powder as they came out flat and dense.

Good recipe but I will cut the vanilla in half next time and maybe add a bit more sugar. But I think it's the excess vanilla thats making it  taste a bit off, so I'll try that first with no extra sugar. Nice texture, still a good cookie/brownie.

Used cacao powder for a deeper flavor. Added coconut  flakes  to entire mix. Baked 1/2 batch with just coconut flakes, 1/4 batch with walnuts, the last 1/4 batch with just almond slivers. Liked the coconut almond slivers the best, mildlynutty flavor. Great recipe. A friend kept chomping down the coconut ones. I'm about to deliver the rest to two neighbors. They're addicting and I'll eat them all if they don't leave the house this morning. ;-)

This is a very good cookie. I just made them. Literally. The only reason I'm not rating it at 5 stars is because I would love for the cookie to not be as thin; other than that it's fabulous. I did not alter the recipe at all other than omitting the nuts and chilling the dough prior to baking. That's it. I'm not sure what went wrong with the negative reviewers but we enjoyed these very much! Thanks for the great recipe!

Not used to making "chewy" cookies because they look sort of different when you pull them out, but I loved the taste and texture when they cooled down a bit. Will definitely make this again. Makes the house smell nice, too.

The bake time for me was about 10 minutes. I had ZERO issues with the cookies being runny or a mess. I don't know what happened to the negative review cookies but mine did not have issue. Only minor change I made was leaving out nuts just because I don't like them. Perfect recipe.  Maybe the runny cookie people are not measuring properly or creaming the butter. That is the only thing that I can think of.

I read the reviews before I baked these, and I used some of the advice from other reviewers...1) I refrigerated the dough before baking 2) I used parchment paper on my cookie sheets and 3) I placed small amounts of dough for each cookie, and gave each one plenty of room. These cookies turned out fabulous!! They did not stick to the parchment, and they are a great crisp, yet chewy texture. Love them!!!

I thought this was great! They are very much a brownie-like cookie. I was ill prepared for this recipe: I didn't have margarine or enough butter, so I used shortening. I didn't have vanilla, so I used Grand Marnier, and I didn't have walnuts (skipped the nuts all together, though I think they would have been great). I halved the recipe and put the dough in the fridge for half an hour before baking on parchment paper. Wonderful! As others said, these spread, so I used a tea-spoon rather than a tablespoon to drop.

Needed a dessert for church tonight and had limited ingredients on hand. This recipe looked simple enough so tried it. IF you make these, CHILL THE DOUGH! They won't spread as much. I also baked them for about 14 minutes so they wouldn't be gooey in the middle. Gooey is usually ok but not on this recipe. I will make them againt. Seriously though, I rate as a 3, too much butter in this one, chill dough to avoid serious spreading, bake a few minutes longer than recipe calls for and USE STONEWARE! Comes off the pan much easier!

These are great! I have seen a lot of people say it didn't work for them. Let me give you a few pointers as to probably why. The butter gets a little melted from mixing so pop them in the fridge and the dough will toughen up an little so it's not so messy! This will also make the cookies less flat. Don't touch these cookies until they cool. If you touch soft chewy cookies like this before they cool they will fall apart. I am positive the problems with these cookies are purely user error. I also tried them out with real butter not margarine and it still worked great. Remember chill and then don't touch! They will toughen up and not be so soft they are going to fall apart as they cool!

I made a half batch incase they didn't turn out, but they turned out wonderful! The kids loved them and my husband who doesn't care for chocolate even loved them. A little crunch outside and chewy inside. Perfection!

There are a lot of complaints. 2 things this recipe is very similar to my mothers all time. 1) low temperature is better. I cook mine 25 degrees less. Second don't flatten the cookies. When the come out will be poofy, following the last step makes them settle into perfection (leave in the tray out of the oven for a minute) DO NOT OVER COOK

Super easy and so yummy. They do have a brownie consistency. They stay moist even over night. I added chocolate chips and left out the nuts for my little boy. He loved them. They do end up being a little flat but still taste great.

Batter was weird, however cookies were perfect for me. Left them a little longer because we enjoy hard cookies. Middle was still nice and soft like a brownie.

These were some of the best cookies I've ever made.  I'm not sure why people had trouble with them.  The first time I made them I halved the recipe and got about 20 cookies using my cookie scoop to measure.  They came out really soft and chewy after about 10 minutes in the oven, and they were all gone within 24 hours.  I'll make these again and again.

My six year old daughter and I made these, they were awesome! We used 1 cup butter and 1/4 cup coconut oil. We don't eat margarine over here! 
We also didn't put the nuts. 
They are like brownies more than anything... careful the dough is really good. ;)

I made these cookies without the walnuts and everyone in my family loved them. They tasted like brownies but still had the cookie consistency. They took about 14 minutes to bake completely. Once they cooled for around 5 minutes, it was easy to take them off the pan.

Definitely a milk-and-cookies kind of cookie.  Had no problem with making them, but came out slightly crunchy on the outside and gooey inside (sort of like store bought brownies).  Tastes good though.

Excellent! I can't have any sugar, so have made it with Truvia Baking Blend, as well as Swerve. I use unsalted butter. Even my husband likes them! Easy to make. Have no idea why some people complain.

I thought these cookies were great. They come out like brownies. I subbed butter for the margarine and followed other suggestions to let the dough sit in the fridge before cooking. I have made two batches, the one that cooled the longest came out thicker than my initial batch which was flatter.

I halved the recipe, using butter instead of margarine, and let the butter soften just until soft enough to cream with the sugar, egg, vanilla and salt, then added the dry ingredients.  Baked on silicon baking sheets.  They set up beautifully, didn't fall flat or run together, easily slipped right off the baking sheets once cooled, and were absolutely delicious!  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

Just baked up a 1/2 batch and the are very good! They taste like my favorite part of a brownie. Had to make some substitutions because I didn't have some of the ingredients. Use canola oil (using the allrecipes substitution chart)  instead of butter and 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar. The batter didn't run as some reviewers stated. Cooked for 10min. and let them cool a bit before removing from the parchment paper because they did crumble a bit when they come from the oven. This recipe is a keeper!

These were okay, not fantastic.  I made them for Halloween to be witches hat cookies and followed the recipe exactly.  They have very little flavor, so I wouldn't make them as a stand alone cookie.

If you do not like cocoa I would not suggest this recipe.


I halved this recipe because I didn't want to make four dozen cookies and replaced the margarine with softened salted butter. I also skipped the nuts all together.


In my first batch I greased half the cookie sheet and didn't notice a difference between taste or easiness to remove from the sheet. I didn't regrease the sheet and continued to have zero problems removing the cookies so long I used a metal spatula. 


I chilled my cookie dough in the freezer between batches. The last batch, which had been chilled for 90 minutes was not too different from the first batch which was only chilled for the amount of time it took to preheat the oven.


I made balled 1 teaspoon cookies, so even with the halved recipe I ended up with just under 40. 


These definitely turned out more like brownie bites (that tasted like cocoa) than "normal" flat cookies.

I have made them following the recipe exactly and they were amazing. But I wanted them to be more like a brownie in a cookie form. Before adding any of the dry ingredients I mixed a box of instant vanilla pudding in with the wet ingredients. I then added another 1/2-1 cup of flour to the dry ingredients. They came out looking like cookies but tasting exactly like brownies.

This recipe was so easy and good until the last crumble! As I always do with new recipes, I cut it in half just in case I didn't like it. I should have made the whole batch! I put the batter in the freezer at the same time I started to pre-heat the oven and it made it easy to put on the cookie sheets. These cookies are soft and chewy on the inside and are the perfect mix between a cookie and a brownie. So delicious! These would be perfect with ice cream!

Great cookies! My family's favorite, especially when I chop up a dark chocolate bar [or two] and mix it in! I use real butter, and Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder. Dough needs to be chilled if you want to avoid a gooey situation. Also, baking parchment works wonders for these; makes removal and cleanup so simple. The more you bake these, the better they turn out, as ovens all vary and it takes time to fine tune the details like exact time, temp, position of oven racks, ect. My kids call these "Death by Chocolate Cookies."

My family and I LOVE this recipe! The cookies were moist and tasted fantastic! The only tweak I made was to add a little extra cocoa powder.After that, they were even more chocolatey.

Needed a quick cookie that had the minimal ingredients  that I had in my cupboards - this one filled the bill completely!  And as my step son said "These cookies are addictive." (also you can use half butter and half crisco and still turn out wonderfully)

The Recipe is for 48 servings unless you change it which i only found out after i made it the cookies were totally gooey nearly overflowed also they fell to bits when i tried to take them off the tray and  they took nearly three times as long to cook as it says they do. They taste okay but the effort it took to make them was not worth it!!!

Regarding the folks that had a really hard time with this recipe...mine came our perfect, but I also had ran out of butter, so I only used just under 2 cups and then attemped to even out the recipe by lowering the flour by about a 1/3 of a cup.  If you try again, I would highly recommend lowering the butter content or increasing the baking power so its able to hold onto the contents a bit.

I love this recipe! (First I made it to a tee, just a little flat that time)  And I can't make cookies to save my life. Second time -  I didn't add the vanilla (didn't have any) and no salt, used baking powder rather than soda (didn't have any again ;) there is a reason I can't bake)and whole wheat flour.  first batch was flat so I added about 1/2 cup more flour and they are fantastic.. definatly taste like a brownie and didn't have an issue with the pan

I loved these cookies. They really were like eating a brownie. I think that they would also be very good with some pecans or fudge. Thanks I will be making these again. :)

I thought this recipe was great! As far as the cookies setting up, I found it helpful to use cold margarine and using a little extra flour to make more of a dough consistency, then putting it in the freezer for 10 minutes, before spooning onto the cookie sheet.

Really good recipe, with just a few changes I made to make them cholesterol-free and keep them from getting flat...Use baking powder instead of baking soda, and the cookies will hold their shape more.  Also I substituted the margarine with butter flavored shortening and peanut butter--this also helps keep them from flattening out.  I also used egg beaters and whole grain wheat flour.  Even the kids thought they were FANTASTIC, even though they were "healthy".  Great basic recipe, thanks!!!

Our family LOVES these! They're simple to make and sinfully good. I've made them many times and they have always come out great. I used baking stones, so I added about 7 minutes to the baking time. I would strongly reccomend this recipe. (I once decorated them with a swirl of peanut butter frosting. It was a nice twist on the flavor)

These cookies are very good.  The recipe makes big, flat chewy cookies.  They are great with whipped cream on them.

this recipe was rediculously delicious!!
i would reccommend cooking them for more like 15-20 minutes though because they were a little undercooked after 8-10 minutes.

they were yummy, fluffy, and certainly did taste exactly like brownies!!
i will defenitly use this recipe for all occasions 

:)

I made the recipe as written, except that I used butter.  They do spread a bit, but I had no problem removing them from an ungreased pan.  They have a chewy, somewhat grainy brownie-like texture, which I really like.  Excellent.

A very good recipe if you don't have a lot of ingredients on hand, but you do have a chocolate craving! I also lightly greased the cooking sheet first and it made a big difference. I was careful about how close and big the cookie batter was placed as well as warned in other reviews. They don't look pretty but they taste really good!

These cookies were easy and delicous.  Great for a chocolate fix.  Instead of walnuts I added mini m&m's, which were a big hit.  We made them giant-sized, too.  They were chewy and soft, but they were flat and spread out quite a bit on the cookie sheet.  We baked 8 giant cookies on a sheet instead of 12.

These cookies are great! Mine didn't come out soft and chewy because I cooked them a little longer but I loved them anyway.  The second time I made them I added peanut butter chips and my family devoured them.  Super easy to make too!

Well i thought it stayed really soft without any gooey stuff in the middle. It is almost like a brownie. It wasn't flat and thats a good thing because most of my cookies are flat. Didn't taste the best but that doesn't mean it was bad. It was good and the best i tasted so far with the limited ingredients i have. '-'
