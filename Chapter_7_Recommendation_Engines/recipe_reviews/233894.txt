This is good but let's just tweak the preparation a bit. The chicken does not need to be marinated. Saut√© the chicken in the marinade ingredients but do NOT add the egg white and add the cornstarch later. Next add in the veggies and then add the minced garlic - careful not to burn it. Make a slurry with the cornstarch and chicken broth. Pour over the chicken and veggies. Stir to coat thoroughly. After tasting it I added about 1 tsp chili garlic sauce. If I make this again I'll add in some red bell pepper for color.
