This cake was absolutely fantastic & we are VERY VERY PICKY.  I made it when there were NO reviews at all last week.  I'm glad I did.  In fact, it was soo good we made it a 2nd time 3 days later when the first cake ran out. I am a closet gourmet chef & only eat desert usually if I make it (don't waste time eating store bought sweets).  I'm not a cake fanatic, but this one yum.  This took 3 hours like it says & turn off & leave for 30 more minutes -- I made it exactly according to the recipe -- we serve it on a plate with a side of ice cream (butter pecan is good or mint chocolate chip) & drizzle chocolate sauce (just a smidge) on top of ice cream & cake & top w/ whipped cream (can is good for this).  I've made this twice & plan to make it a 3rd time any day. Tastes like devil's food. Smells soo good cooking.  Don't heat it up in the microwave fyi or you may dry it out.   Leftovers stay well for a few days w/plastic wrap atop & left in crockpot w/lid on if you like unplugged of course.  I'm not sure why people are saying rubbery, tasteless.  because that's furthest from the truth for us.  Maybe they used Canola oil - u Have to use a heavier oil - like vegetable oil.  I used Crisco veg. oil)  I have a large oval Rival pot.   I am searching for great recipes for my crock pot cookbook as I've found a lot of crock pot recipes are awful.  This one is a keeper.  Just like the italian sandwiches on this site for the crock pot.  yum  I've passed this recipe off already.

The recipe does not say how large of a crockpot to use.  Mine is 3 qts and it took longer than 3 hours.  However, it was delicious.  My husband who does not like cake had seconds.  It was moist & rich.  I used evaporated milk in lieu of regular milk  because that is what I had on hand and I would not change a thing!

Wonderfully moist cake.  I made some changes to reduce overall calories.  I used egg beaters, substituted 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for the oil, used 1 cup Splenda and 1 cup granulated sugar, 1% Milk, and lite salt.  I added 1/4 tsp Cayenne pepper for some heat, great with or without it.  Original version 313 calories per serving.  My version 164 calories and every bit as good!

Love this cake, and I am not a chockoholic.  I always pass on choc. cake.  Husband loved it.  He is a chockoholic, but has diabetes, so I had to change somethings.  1.Used Splenda instead of sugar.  2.  Used Egg Beaters instead of eggs.  3.  Used applesauce instead of oil.  4.  Used coconut milk because it was in the fridge and needed to be used.  It came out fantastic!  Cooked for 3 hrs. left it in in covered cooker another 30 minutes.  Then we had warm cake.  Wow Hoo

OMG.....awesome!!!!  Thank you!!!!  It will take 3 hours to make, per directions, if using a 5 - 6 quart slow cooker.  Using a slow cooker smaller than that may require more cooking time as the cake will be thicker than if you use a larger slow cooker.  I saw a lot of reviewers were upset because it didn't specify what size slow cooker to use and their cake took longer to bake than specified.  I figured I would add this to my review in the hopes it will help people. Just keep checking it.  As soon as you see the cake starting to pull away from the side of the slow cooker, it is done.  Turn off the slow cooker and follow the rest of the directions.

I was impressed with this and I've been cooking for 45 years. I did change the order of mixing. I mixed the entire cake and then whisked in the boiling water. This gives it that dense moistness that you get from Texas sheet cake it also heats up the batter to cut down on cook time. I always put a towel under the lid to absorb condensation. The last time I made it I topped it with a can of cherry pie filling, delicious!

We were amazed!   This is one of the best chocolate cakes I've tried, and it can't get any easier.  I used a 3 qt crock pot and cooked it for 3 1/2 hours.   Not fully cooked in the center, but we love it that way.  I also used vegetable oil, even though I faithfully use olive oil for all my other cooking.   I read in one of the reviews that vegetable oil makes a better cake, and it sure didn't disappoint us!

This is perfect.  So easy and everyone loved it.  Reminded me of the pudding cake.  Very rich and moist.  I dusted with powdered sugar for looks only because it is very sweet.  Used half sugar and half "sugar free" to reduce amount of sugar grams.  No one knew.  Took approximately 3 1/2 hours to cook.  Try this one.

This cake was tasteless and not moist at all.  I would not recommend following the mixing directions, however the amounts of ingredients seems to work well.  I think it would be much better in the oven and with butter rather than vegetable oil.

My husband requested "something chocolate" for Father's Day dessert. This recipe came up when I put chocolate in the search window. Wow! We all loved this. I do admit to a few modifications. We are a gluten-free family so I used my gluten-free flour blend and added 1/2 tsp xanthan gum and used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. The slight coconut flavor was reminiscent of eating a Mounds candy bar! This one is a keeper. I like that I can store the few leftovers in the crock-pot too!

Very good only complaint was the timing was off i had to cook it almost 4 hours an was still slightly gooey in the center. Hubby even approved of this and said he liked the center the way it was LOL. Changes I made was as follows. (1) I used Ghirardelli chocolate cocoa (2) did make sure to temer the mix with the egg when adding the water.  (3) I used EVO instead of veggie oil and only used a 1/4 not a half.

Before I tell you why I give this a 5-star review let me say that when cooking you know you will have to use your judgment when it comes to timing. In our older crock pot (the old fashioned deep UNremovable pot type) it took longer because of the depth (4+hours). In our newer oval more shallow pot it took exactly the amount of time the recipe states. I suggest you reread the recipe and try it again. Assume lid is on. Why did I give this cake 5 stars? It was somewhat gooey in the center, chocolatey, easy, had the texture I beleve a slow cooker cake should have, unique and a true hit at our Sister's Day. We had this cake with vanilla ice cream. In a few days I will be preparing a couple of bags of dry mix for my older sister to have on hand while she is away on assignment. ANYTIME I am willing to remove ingredients from my kitchen tells me I truly believe in a recipe! Next time I will add nuts to the top of the cake during the last 15 minutes. Excellent recipe.

Absolutely fabulous. I had serious misgivings when I saw how thin the batter was, but this cake was beautifully moist and delicious. I added a dash of cayenne to really bring out the chocolate flavour. Yum.

Great easy recipe! I cut the recipe down to 4 servings and made it in my small crockpot. Baked on low for 2 hrs and it was perfect. (Also subbed evaporated milk for milk because I was out.)

WOW! I have never bothered writing a review before. But since this one is such GEM.. I just got to!
I've always wanted to try making cake in crockpot. I had doubts looking at the calories. So I made it healthier using 1 cup wheat flour 3/4 AP flour, unsweetened apple sauce instead of oil, only 1 cup sugar and 5tbs lo cal sweetener that I use for my drinks,  add 3 tbs ground flax seeds, use low fat milk, use only 1 yolk and 2 whites.... And I ended up in chocolatey Heaven! A note though.. I didnot get the gooey center. So I think I'll cook it 2,5 hrs. But that does not matter. It's up to you to prove it:D

This cake is fantastic and I'd serve it to company - which says a lot because I always serve company nothing but the best.

This cake is moist & delectible - sort of a cross between a chocolate lava cake and devils food. Follow the directions - including "mix well" & use VEGETABLE oil(don't use canola oil- it won't cook properly). Don't lift the lid while cooking and make sure you let it rest with the lid OFF. 

Now here's the really amazing part - I used 1 1/2 cups Splenda & 1/2 cup sugar ... it was STILL great.

Turned out great. My wife who always insists on vanilla cake loved it and cannot stop eating it. After about an hour or so, I checked on it and noticed that one side seemd to be cooking faster, so I waited a bit longer and turned the removable porcelain pot 180 degrees. If your slow cooker cooks unevenly, this is a great solution. After 3 hours, it wasn't done yet, but seemed to be cooking very evenly. So, I ended up falling asleep and it ended up cooking in the pot for over 4 hours, maybe close to 5. I was worried that it would be over done, but the cake was so moist that I bet it could've stayed in for another 30 minutes and come out fine. Speaking of moist, I cooked with the lid on and a lot of condensation built up on the lid, usually falling back into the sides of the cake. Still turned out great. After it was done, I took the lid off, turned off the cooker and let it sit for 30 minutes. After that is when the sides of the cake seperated from the sides of the cooker and all I did was remove the porcelain insert and flip it upside down, easily dropping the cake onto a plate with a layer of powdered sugar on it, which coated the bottom nicely and kept it from sticking to the plate. Next time, I'm going to use coconut oil like a reviewer on here said and maybe even use coconut flakes and walnuts. It is great and will make it for company.

I tried it but would not tell anyone else to cook it. Quite dark and bitter, and extremely difficult to get out of the bowl!! A tad of powdered sugar on top is a good toping! To each his own. Good Luck

This worked out perfectly.
I reduced the sugar by a bit, but not much. I also replaced the vanilla extract with real ground vanilla. Other than that, I went exactly with the recipe, also for the cooking time.
It was delicious with simple vanilla or stracciatella ice cream.
It’s good warm, but also cooled down after a day or two.
I made it in a large (6 quart?) slow cooker.
Don’t use a small one, or chances are the cake won’t cook properly.
It was still gooey in the centre, but not really undercooked, just deliciously soft and creamy – and only when served still warm.
I will definitely be making this again, it’s very easy.

Wowzer! Rich and chocolately. Was a little worried at first, especially after 2-1/2 hours and it didn't seem to be doing anything, but it worked! Used the 5qt slow cooker and had it go for closer to 3-1/2 hrs before turning off and letting it rest/cool somewhat.  All I can say, is 'addictive'.

This recipe, minus the specifics for a slow cooker, is identical to the one on the back of the Hershey's Cocoa plastic tub.  As a cake baked conventionally, it's very tender and delicious.

So moist and really great taste! Made it exactly as directed. Cooked for 3.5 hours and let sit on warm for another 30. Would be incredible with some chopped walnuts added in to serve with coffee!

Make this cake a day or two ahead to bring it to the peak of flavor and texture.  It took just over 6 hours in my old crockpot.  We loved it!

Does not have a standard cake texture to it, however, this is moot point as it is delicious served with a scoop or two of vanilla ice cream with some rasberry and chocolate sauce drizzled on top. WARNING: DO NOT SKIP THE BOILING WATER AND ADD COLD WATER INSTEAD. I did this my second time making this as I was feeling lazy and figured what could go wrong and the cake ended up not cooking correctly. Instead of being completely even and done the outside was burnt and the inside was mush. Follow all the steps and measurements to the exact amounts in the correct order and you can't go wrong.

I made this cake for a barbeque, and everyone liked it. It stayed moist for days, and I loved that I didn't have to turn my oven on during a hot summer day to have cake! Served it with homemade vanilla ice cream and it was delicious!

I tried this recipe and it was very easy to put together. I was so excited because it is summer and I didn't want to make my house hot baking. The cake was very fudge-y but had no flavor. I had to cook it an extra 30 minutes because the center was still very raw after 3 hours. Even after the extra 30 minutes of cook time and 30 minutes of resting parts were still molten looking and not in a good way. I had read all of the reviews and did not open the slow cooker until the 3 hour cook time was up, so I don't know what happened. I was very disappointed.

AMAZING! Moist with very nice chocolaty flavor! For you baker types who like your cakes light, perfectly spongy, and dry to the touch, this is not your cake. It's SO GOOD, it doesn't need frosting. I used my large, oval crock pot with the removable ceramic insert. Perfect size and cooked evenly. I made sure the water was boiling when I added it. This kick starts the cooking process. I was concerned about how it would cook through. My 12 yr old boys were home alone babysitting the cake, so after 3 hrs, I had them turn the pot to "warm" for 30 mins instead of turning off pot and letting sit for 30. Then they pulled the ceramic insert out to cool. PERFECTION! It was ready to eat  immediately after 3:30. Made this last nite. I'm making another today so I can try with vanilla ice cream.

The flavor of the cake wasn't the best I've ever had, but the combination of texture and moisture was incredible. It was definitely one of the best cakes I've ever had. I didn't follow the recipe exactly, due to the fact that I'm lactose intolerant and also didn't have enough room in my slow-cooker. Here's what I did: Instead of milk, I used rice milk. The cake turned out great, even with this change. Additionally, I was already making "Slow Cooker BBQ Chicken" (find it on AllRecipes), and decided to get creative. First, I put my BBQ chicken into my slow-cooker, then I prepared my chocolate cake mixture by halving the recipe and pouring the mixture into a prepared ceramic baking dish. I then wrapped the ceramic dish in aluminum foil and gently placed it on top of my BBQ chicken. The sides of my slow cooker actually prevented the dish from sitting atop the chicken, which created a double-boiler effect for the cake. Six hours later, I had delicious BBQ chicken, and an ultra-moist chocolate cake. In short, the recipe is very tasty, and with a little creativity you can kill two birds with one stone.

This was very good chocolate cake. I decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and replaced the oil with applesauce, which added back some sweetness. It turned out great!

This cake is fantastic! Added two cans of cherry pie filling to the
bottom of the crock, then added batter.  Cooked for 3 hours.  It was
perfect.  Family loved it.  Bring on some more slow cooker cakes please!!!

It was ok. Had a flat chocolate taste, wasn't very sweet. Had to cook it longer as my slow cookers is deep and not large. Probably better if the cake was thinner.

Absolutely perfect texture and extremely moist. I'm allergic to dairy, so I used almond milk instead and it turned out perfectly! Also, it only took 2 hrs 50 min.

Rich, dark chocolate cake that is so easy.  I cooked on low for 3 hours in my 6 qt Hamilton Beach crockpot.  I then unplugged it and left it sit overnight with the lid on.  Perfectly done, not too heavy but a great chocolate treat.  I did use Egg Beaters but followed the rest of the recipe.  I'd make this again.  Serve with a dollop of whipped cream.  Yumm!

I cooked this on low for 3 hours and it was still completely liquid. I had to turn the slow cooker up to high and cook it for an additional 2 hours. Just be prepared that your slow cooker may cook a little too slowly!

This cake was fantastic.  It is so very moist, and the flavor is so wonderful it doesn't need frosting or ice cream.  It takes my crock pot 4 hours instead of 3, but it's so easy to throw together and forget it till done.  I made the recipe just as written and I have recommended this recipe to lots of people!

I made this twice because I couldn't believe that it didn't taste good the first time, and it got such good reviews here.

I followed the recipe exactly, each time. I really didn't like it when I first made it and I thought that maybe the eggs were old. So I threw out that batch, bought very fresh eggs and tried again.

I still didn't like it. I have to say that I loved the consistency. It was moist and gooey and I love that. But the taste was so bland and not sweet at all.

If I'm going to eat something that's bla tasting, I'll at least eat something healthy. Chocolate cake is supposed to be really tasty or else it's not worth the calories.

No one in the family liked it. I hate wasting food but no one liked it. It's only redeeming quality was that it was nice and moist.

To blancdeblanc and all the great cooks who left reviews!  Tried the recipe for the first time today and loved the taste, texture and ease of the recipe.  However, I have one question.  I have a large slow cooker and left the lid on.  But in 2 hrs. it smelled like it was done, so I removed the crock inside to cool for the 30 min. as cited.  The sides had pulled away from side and bottom was slightly crusty.  The recipe did not say whether or not to cook with lid on.  Love to hear comments but cake tasted so good and moist.  Will just make adjustments for cooker.  Loved it!!!

THE FLAVOR OF THIS CAKE IS WONDERFUL... MY SLOW COOKER MUST HEAT EXTREMELY UNEVEN - THERE WERE DRY BURNT PORTIONS AND UNDERCOOKED GOOEY PORTIONS - HOWEVER THE PORTIONS THAT COOKED CORRECTLY WERE FANTASTIC - I WILL TRY ANOTHER OF MY SLOW COOKERS AND HOPE FOR A MORE EVEN TEXTURE - IF THAT DOESNT WORK I WILL TRY THE OVEN - I AM DETERMINED TO MAKE THIS RECIPE WORK... AS WE LOVED THE FLAVOR! THANK YOU!

This was fabulous.  I did find, however, I had to cook longer than 3 hrs.. it was more like 5.  It was moist, chocolatey, and warm!!!  I made it at work, so the smell of cake drifted throughout the office... it made for some hungry coworkers..  Thank you.. I would think you could make a cake mix & slow cook that with the same success... will try it next!!

Moist and delicious exactly as written! You can tweek this a bit if you like with chocolate chips (or peanut butter chips - yum!) or even some nuts. I substitute unsweetened apple sauce for the oil and I use almond milk in place of the regular milk. It comes out so moist and delicious!! It helps to put a paper towel over the crock pot top (don't let it fall down onto the batter) and let the lid of the crock pot hold it in place. This will absorb excess moisture and keep your cake perfect.

made this cake did not change anything just added a tablespoon of rum and it was delicious, I have a larger crock pot and it turned out light and fluffy, even my husband who insists he does not like puddings had a helping of this cake with pouring yogurt and he said it was delicious and then asked me to keep the recipe!!! his words "its better than christmas pudding" I agree with KITZER the lid of the crock pot should not be lifted until the 3 hours are up!!

Ohhhh boy was this moist! Excellent texture- I did not have vegetable oil- having read Canola oil was healthier, I just bought that and I was a little concerned a few of the reviews indicated - not to use Canola oil. I was still determined to make this today so I went ahead and used the Canola oil and it was just fine!!!

It was fun making a cake in the Crock Pot since I had never done that before and the house smelled amazing!I like the idea you can throw it together and leave the house to do errands while a dessert is slow cooking. I had some left over chocolate ganache we drizzled over the top and it was delicious. Any favorite topping would work as well as frosting. Because of the oval shape from the crock pot this would make a great base as a giant easter egg all decorated! And Easter is right around the corner! Loved this! I want to try a yellow cake the same way! Gotta eat this warm!!! Kind of the whole point...

Like other reviewers, my crockpot cooked this unevenly and took longer, with the sides coming out very tough, but the rest of it was absolutely delicious, devils' foodish and super moist. We found that after leaving it overnight, though, the sides softened up perfectly and we had a perfect consistency throughout. In future, we'll resist the urge to eat it warm and save for the next day. Will definitely make this again!

I'm not really into cakes (more of a pie person), but when I found this recipe my husband surprised me by making it. I'm a convert, it is fantastic - so moist, so chocolatey, but not too sweet. He (me) decided it needed more time, and although it could have done with a little longer still, it almost had a thick, mousse texture on top (which firmed somewhat upon standing). Make sure to let it sit a little before cutting, as it will come out easier. We couldn't wait though and used a spoon, serving it with vanilla ice cream. For a couple who don't do dessert, it disappeared in no time. In fact, I'm making one this minute.

I tried this recipe some time ago and have been pondering how to describe its texture.  First, the flavor is awesome, very deep chocolate.  Second - I love the use of the crock pot.  That being said, the texture was very odd.  As others posted, mine cooked uneven (I did not peek and let it sit after it was done).  The outer edges were bitter.  The correctly cooked part looked awesome and even came out in slices like a normal cake.  Its when I bit into it.  I wouldn't describe it as rubbery but the best was I can describe is like a cake pop (which I detest).  Looks good but tastes gooey like it has been soaked in something.  BE WARNED - this is not your typical light and fluffy cake.

I made this to try out a brand new replacement crock pot. Since it's summer and hot outside, I didn't want to try my usual crock pot fare (soups, etc) so I figured dessert would be nice!
This had a very interesting texture at different parts. The outsides and bottom are inedible (to me) and rubbery. The top and middle are good, though still odd. I'm guessing others might have more luck depending on what kind of crock pot you have and how hot it runs. I won't be trying this again in mine, though. At least I know it works!

Yes this was an extremely moist cake.  my husband did rave about it and I would probably make it again. The only thing is I don't see the advantage of using the crock pot. Since it only took about 3 hours to bake I had to "babysit" it. Kind of a fun thing to do and tell your friends about though. I would reccomend this one.    

 I am adding this last thought after realizing it is going to be about 100 degrees here today.  I now  see the advantage to using a crockpot....  :)

Will not make again. Some parts were hard and chewy and others were mushy. When I turned the pot upside down to get the cake out it broke into pieces. Didn't taste great either.

This cake was awesome!  We had ice cream with it, and it was moist and gooey and chocolatey! Thumbs up from my whole family, even my D.I.L.  However, you absolutely MUST spray the pot with cooking spray! I am still trying to clean it.

This was really good. Definitely took longer to cook about 4-ish hours, and more like a great soufle.  It was great with ice cream or whipped cream and wonderful the next day warmed or cold. will make again and serve with berries

Fabulous!  Followed recipe exactly, and my, was it delicious!  A family winner & keeper, for certain. Took 3 hours in my 6 Qt crock pot; then turned it off & let it set 30 mins, per recipe.  

The cake was immensely moist, immensely tasty, wonderfully dense, and perfectly rich.  Not too sweet, not too anything -- except for being too good! :o) I took one reviewer's suggestion to tautly lay a towel across the top of the crock pot & secure it with the lid.  GREAT IDEA!  Thank you for that helpful hint!  Glad I did that. 

We found the edges got a little too cooked/tough [about 1/2 inch from edges inward; but one child liked that part], and I'm sure that's b/c my crock runs a little hot; it always does.  So I will reduce the cook time next time -- and there WILL be a next time! -- by 15 minutes or so.  

I doubted this would be that good, and tried it just to have my 6 yr old have fun making a cake for the crock pot.  I am so glad I tried it, and am so glad I was wrong. :o)  Highly recommended! Just so yummy!!

Wonderful! I made it accordingto recipe. Will make it again.

 For the person that said it was stale need to check the date on your flour.  Old flour will make make it stale and terrible results.

After two hours on low in my slow cooker, my  chocolate cake was totally BURNED on side and bottom!  The recommended time of three hours is crazy.  No chance to try the recipe as the technique made eating my cake impossible.  Never Again will I "bake" a cake in a slow cooker.

This is wonderful.  So moist and rich.  I used 1/2 Splenda for the sugar and 1/2 regular sugar as ia am a diabetic. Tasted great.  No one could tell.  Have made this 3 times in 2 months.  Great every time.

Made this in my 3.5 Qt. Crockpot - it was awesome!!! Used 1 cup sugar & 1 Cup Splenda to cut down on the sugar.  Cooked as directed for 3.5 hours - then turned off for 1/2 hour.  Served with frozen Cool Whip - next time I may use all Splenda & see how it works since my husband is a diabetic. Will definitely make it again and am going to share recipe with my friends!!!

My rating is because I couldnt get it to turn out at all.  The sides overcooked and I had a puddle of cake batter in the middle.  This could definitely be the cook and not the recipe.

I have a 6 quart slow cooker, so decided to try this cake.  Husband does not like chocolate cake, but he liked this.  Very Chocolately.  However after 5 hours, lid never lifted, cake was still fudgey rather than cake like.  Doubt I will make it again.

This is by far the Best Cake I have ever made and eaten. The first time I made it the only substitution I made was Splenda for Sugar. The second time I made it I didn't have any milk so I used an 8oz. can of Chocolate Enterex, which is a diabetic drink. Unbelievably chocolaty and delicious! I would actually make it this way again. Both My Husband and I are Diabetics, so I am always looking for a treat and this is the one!

I wish I had read the reviews before I tried the recipe.  I used a 3 qt. cooker and the cake did not get done.  I was so disappointed because it smelled so good while it was cooking I couldn't wait to try it.  After reading the reviews, I will try a larger crock.

Followed the directions..did not turn out as well as expected..I have a 6 qt. slow cooker..top of the line when I got it. The cake was chewy, to say the least. Flavor was not bad..but I don't think I'll do  it again. Perhaps the low on my crockpot is too hot.

We tried this one, and sadly to say, learned our slow cooker cooks very unevenly.  One end of cake was burnt, and the other was still uncooked.  We find it is much easier and better to just use the cake mixes.

I live at 5600' so wonder if this is part of my problem.  I followed the recipe, but it began to burn at the pointed ends of my 6 qt oval crockpot.  The center was still undercooked after 3 hours even though it was burning. Left it in a little longer but finally took it out at 3.5 hrs even though the top was still gooey.  The non-burned parts taste very good.  I'll try my 5 qt round crockpot and see if this helps.  It has been in the high 90s around here so I didn't want to turn on the oven.  Another post said this was similar to a lava cake, I would agree on that one.

This was easy and delicious! I did let it cook about a half hour longer, so 4 hours on low. I'm sure this is probably normal depending on what size crock pot you are using. Yummy!

I actually followed the directions for this recipe, for a change.  The aroma was awesome and it looked wonderful.  The flavor was very good, but then it is chocolate and its hard to go wrong with flavor there.  The cake itself was extremely chewy.  Rubbery is pretty close.  The very middle was a lovely texture, but the rest, well we chewed through it anyway.  Like I said, great flavor!

Any way you make it, it's good!  I only did two minor adjustments to it which were, reducing the sugar by 1/4 cp (personal preference) and using fresh brewed coffee instead of boiling water.  You actually don't need the water to be boiling either, it just needs to be hot (as if you just brewed coffee).  The trick is, don't just chuck in the water/coffee and hope for the best, wait until you've mixed the batter and then add the coffee/water.  It's supposed to be a super runny mix.  Mine did take closer to the 4 hour mark.  Once my toothpick came out with 'cooked' lumps, I set my pot to 'keep warm' and let it sit a while longer.  This cake is dense and is rather gooey, but that's what makes it.  If you bake this recipe in the oven, it won't be as gooey, since it rises more.  I'll probably stick to making it in the oven, but this is a great variation for those hot summer months when you just don't want to turn the oven on.  You can also switch out veg for canola oil and there shouldn't be any difference.

I would describe this as "interesting" for texture and "pretty good"  for taste.. I made it exactly as written using a Hamilton Beach 3 Qt. Oval Cooker.(cake was about 4- 5 inches deep when done)  I let it cook covered on low for the 3.5 hours (never lifted the lid)  and then sit uncovered for 30+ minutes. It did pull away from the sides and cooked evenly throughout.  -  and it came out somewhere between a very moist cake and a pudding-definitely very moist- slightly rubbery around the edges but was  definitely not lava cake like which I was kinda expecting.  For the amount of sugar- it wasn't particularly sweet- and had a *slightly* overcooked chocolate taste( I used a high quality Trader Joe's unsweetened cocoa powder thinking that would make a difference in the "flat" taste others mentioned- wondering if it might need more salt to bring up the sweetness and correct the flat taste?).  Scooped it out with a spoon and served it with vanilla ice cream and tart cherry preserves and everyone seemed to like it- and they even had seconds. It was definitely warm and rich and good for a winter evening.  And while it was fun to experiment with this cooking method I probably wouldn't do it again based on my preference for a lighter cake.  However I made this for company and I was really  nice to start it early in the day and ignore it while I was preparing dinner and have something warm when we were ready for dessert so that was definitely a plus.

Loved this; definitely the BEST on the first day, warm out of the pot with melted ice cream on it.  When it cools, it's not as mind blowing and almost seems to lose flavor.  Easy recipe to complete; time it for when you have guests over so that at the end of dinner they can have a steaming bowl of cake/ice cream.  Any kids (and adults too) in the crowd will think you're the best thing since....well since chocolate cake.

This is my "go to" recipe when I crave chocolate cake. It is incredible! I have used both vegetable oil and coconut oil with success. I always substitute boiling hot coffee for the water (it enhances the chocolate flavor). I will also throw in some chocolate chips, and a pinch of cinnamon! Yum!

Hmm. I followed the directions exactly and after 3.5 hours I opened my slow cooker. What looked back at me was more like chocolate pudding. The edges were cooked but the middle was soupy. My husband and I still ate some of it and it was more like a chocolate lave cake. It did taste yummy but it just wasn't cake. I think I'll stick to the oven for cakes...

This was very easy and most of the ingredients I already had which was a plus. However, mine wasn't completely done in the middle after 3 hours. I scooped out the parts that were done and let the rest cook for another hour on low. It was very moist and tasty so that was a plus just needed to cook longer.

Took longer than the mentioned time to cook and wasn't as flavorful as I would like. I could have baked the cake faster, but it was fun to try.

I substituted honey for the sugar and in turn reduced the oil from 1/2 to 1/4 cup, added pure almond extract and also used chocolate almond milk bc WHY NOT?!?? Only sad about 1. the lack of crock pot size in relation to cook time and 2. no direction on keeping the lid on or off. Mine, probably due to the honey, is pudding in the center but SMELLS AMAZING!! So now the lid is off while it continues to firm up.... can't wait to try it!! I think the next time I make this I'll figure out a way to add coffee to the mix and perhaps a little cinnamon. YUMMIER!!!

absolutely delicious!!!  VERY moist cake and tastes even better after cooling down in the fridge over night!!!  had to cook the full 3 hours, only lifted the lid twice.  wouldn't change anything about the recipe!  only part i didn't like was having to scoop it out of the crockpot, doesn't make for a very beautiful cake...

Hmm...I bake it in the oven of course. And I replace the water with coffee. I did try this in the crock pot. It was not finished in 3 1/2 hours but I have a big crock pot, 6 qt I think. I had thought that might make it get done faster but apparently the opposite is true.

This needs more precise instructions. Mine never did cook in the center. I think it was the size and shape of the crock. Mine is very large and oval. Also, it heats from the bottom instead of the sides. I think this needs a round one to cook evenly.

Definitely moist but not particularly tasty as you would think. Served with ganache topping and vanilla bean ice cream; that saved it.

Loved the idea of my slow cooker doing all the work without heating up our oven on a hot summer day and so went to town on this recipe last Sunday.  Three hours in a 6-quart slow cooker on low turned into four and then five...six...seven plus hours until I finally gave up on getting the cake cooked through.  My son and I ate around the edges and found the texture, flavor and moist factors all heavenly.  However, the middle remained the consistency of unset pudding.  Still love the idea and plan on making once again but on medium heat in my slow cooker. I've also considered purchasing a newer slow cooker as the one I have may not be heating to the appropriate levels. Am giving 4 stars as I have faith that this recipe can be mastered!

This cake turned out great.  I just did half of the recipe.  I put it in my almost 44 year old Rival crock pot on low and it was done in 2 hrs. and 15 min.  Very moist.  Delicious with a little vanilla ice cream on the side.  I will definitely make again.

put a paper towel just under the lid and do not look at the cake until its time is done. the lid will caught the water (condensation) and it comes out great.

BURNED.  It was completely soupy after 3 hours, but the sides were pulling away. Then I fell asleep and woke up. It was completely black in some places but light colored and wet in other. Went horribly, my house smells terrible

I made this last night using half the recipe as I had a small crock pot.  I didn't time it at all, I just would walk over to it and give it a touch now and again.  It came out very well.  I inverted it on a plate and covered it with cream cheese frosting (that I had stored in the fridge).  The only reason I hold of on giving this a 5 star rating is because it was slightly lopsided.  I presume that had something to do with the heating element of the crock pot.  I will keep this recipe handy as it was so simple.

Amazing recipe. I used 25% less sugar and it still tasted awesome. Moist and tasty.

I tried this twice, and both times the cake did not turn out well at all. The edges would burn while the middle was properly cooked, but the flavor was not "amazing."

Followed directions and did not get good results.  The crockpot burnt the sides of the cake after 2 1/2 hrs on low.  The top still had wet spots, and the burnt smell of the sides spread the burnt flavor throughout the entire cake.  Total flop!

The first time I made it, I cooked it an extra 20 minutes because the top still looked too moist, but I think the listed time was actually perfect for my crockpot. The top should actually still be a little moist to the touch, and very soft (it will firm as it cools); the regular "knife comes out (mostly) clean" test seems to work better than testing the surface for moistness. I replaced half of the sugar with Splenda to be more diabetic-friendly, and sprinkled the top with powdered sugar, which worked as more than a garnish because it really made it tastier. I've also tried it with olive oil and orange extract instead of vegetable oil and vanilla, but the original is better. I'll probably make it again, because it's pretty good for how easy it is.

It's definitely the best chocolate cake recipe. Here in the mountains of Nepal we have also cooked it in a dutch over or covered stockpot on top of a stove or open fire. (The metal cake pan should be raised on a metal trivet or empty tin inside the stockpot.) have also made it many times in a dumpling steamer, making sure that the cake pan is well covered with foil or a metal plate, to avoid too much moisture ruining the top of the cake.

This is a wonderful recipe! I used an all-purpose GLUTEN-FREE flour blend and 2 tsp XANTHUM GUM instead of wheat flour and it was AWESOME!!!
There's a rich deep chocolate flavor and a moistness that makes you crave another piece.  Absolutely delicious! I used a 5-qt crock pot/slow cooker and the batter filled the bottom third.  By the last hour of cooking it rose to almost filling the pot.  When I took it out of the pot it measured 3.5 inches.  I will be making this again, guaranteed!

It was easy to create yet took over 4 hours not 3 to cook and the flavor was off. Now to be fair, I did throw in chocolate chips for added chocolate flavor so that could be the reason but we just did not like this. The smell was unfavorable, the consistency was not what we expected and the flavor was weak. So hopefully it was because of the chocolate chips we put in it however I won't be making this again.

This cake was AMAZING!  Used coconut milk-as suggested in another review, applesauce instead of milk and special dark cocoa powder.  Had the consistancy of a pudding cake when finished.  Served with vanilla ice cream and it was perfect!

I signed up just to review this recipe. It was the most delicious chocolate cake and super moist. All I had was olive oil, and it still came out fantastic. I wonder if I could use butter instead? My kids and husband loved it. I also substituted half the sugar with stevia. They cant wait till I make it again.

Made this yesterday for a pot luck.  It was ok.  Flavor wasn't bad, but the texture was a bit off. My husband wouldn't eat more than a bite, and one friend couldn't bring herself to finish her portion. We all agreed that it would have been better with something to offset the 'feel' of it.  Mint chocolate chip ice cream would have been divine with it.  Or maybe even fresh strawberries with whipped cream. But alone, this was too mushy.  Also, not a very pretty dessert.  
It was really easy to cook, and definitely fulfilled our craving for chocolate.  All the ingredients are kitchen staples, so it was a great "oh my what will I bring tomorrow" item.  Might try it again, and experiment with toppings.  Just not great by itself.

Actually pretty good, but when it's all said and done, our family prefers a whaky cake made with whole wheat, raw sugar, extra water (preferably milk, but not necessary), and cooked until it is only almost done.  That is actually a creamier cake than this one, and not much more trouble (though it has to be watched much more closely to be sure it is pulled from the oven in its 'creamy' state - that is the plus of this recipe, which doesn't require such close watching, and it did mix up quickly and easily.  very nice flavor, just doesn't meet our expectations for an easy cake.......)

wow!  It was prepared as written (using whole wheat flour).  And except for a couple of small, somewhat firm spots on the outside of the cake likely due to uneven heating, this cake came out surprisingly delicious.  It tasted even better the next few days.  Definitely a keeper for its simplicity and taste.  TY to original poster.

I followed the recipe exactly, and I believe that it turned out how it was supposed to, I just didn't care for the texture. It was more like a warm bread pudding than a cake. Once it sat over night, it did firm up, but I still wasn't crazy about it.

This was very yummy! And I like that it's not from a box but all scratch ingredients. The only problem I had is I cooked it for longer than 3 hours because it was still wet on the top. This made the bottom section of the cake tough. But the rest of it is great. I'll trust the 3 hour time limit next time.

Wow!  I wouldn't have thought this would work, but it turned out amazing.  I used soy milk and olive oil and I did reduce the sugar and salt, but that's a personal preference.  My family loved it and were very excited that even on days that are too hot to heat up the oven, we can still have fresh homemade cake!  :)

Great recipe, easy to make, whole family liked it. 
Being diabetic I substituted the 2 cups of sugar with 1 1/2 cups of fructose. Baking time in my slow cooker was about 4 hours, I didn't lift the lid till I thought it was ready. Will definitely make this again.

Easy recipe and really yummy.  My only complaint was that it didn't cook very evenly.  The edges were overdone while some of the areas were still liquidy.  Still, I would make it again!

I saved this recipe awhile back when there were no reviews.  The weather was scorching hot, so to avoid turning on the oven, I made this for my husband's birthday.  His favorite is chocolate cake without frosting and vanilla ice cream.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out ok.  Flavor is a bit "oily."  The cake popped out of the crock without any trouble, but it had a hard crust on top (which would be the bottom of cake that was in the crock).  I don't think I will make it again, but it worked for just the 2 of us for an easy cake to throw together and not need the oven.

Perhaps I did something wrong, but I followed the directions and this did not come out well at all. The consistency was all wrong and my husband and I couldn't get past the texture.

This recipe came to the rescue when my oven broke & my son's birthday was approaching. The only change I made was to reduce the white sugar by about 25% since we tend  to like our desserts less sweet. I also sprinkled just a bit of confectioners sugar on top prior to serving. I made fresh whipped cream (again, less sugar) & it was absolutely perfect! I will definitely make this cake again.

I followed the recipe exactly. I did have to cook closer to 4 and a half hours but it turned out ABSOLUTELY PERFECTLY! Best cake recipe I’ve made or even eaten in a very long time! I added some vanilla ice cream when serving for my new favorite dessert!

This cake was delicious! I only did one thing different-I reduced sugar from 2C to 1 1/2. Cake was done in just a little over 3 hours and I left it in crockpot  on "keep warm" so it would stay warm for our dessert that night. Came out of pot with no problem. Added vanilla ice cream on top--everyone loved it! Will make again for sure. I did put a piece of paper towel under lid while cooking to absorb moisture (don't let it touch batter).

Joking until he looked in the slow cooker, fun!  Not too sweet or sugary, that's what we like.

Easy to make and the cake turned out great except it stuck to the crockpot even after spraying with cooking spray and it burned where the crockpot wall meets the bottom. It was so good though that I'll try it again with a few tweaks next time.

Mine completely failed. Will try again in case it was operator error. Hah. Stayed wet forever. Cooked it for hours and hours. Crock pot is new and properly functioning so perhaps I measured wrong. :/

The cake was AMAZING the day I made it. Moist and delicious, and a deep rich chocolate flavor- there was something almost tres leche about it in consistency.  But by day 3 it was more cake like - still great flavor, but it had lost some of that incredible moisture it had on day 1 ( and it was stored in a lock n lock). So my suggestion would be, in order to enjoy this cake at its best,  plan on having it for only 1-2 days.

A nice quick and easy dessert to prepare.  Our slow cooker tends to cook faster than most, so I shaved 10 or 15 minutes off the time and was glad I did.  The result was a moist cake, very similar in flavour to Devil's Food Cake.

Hubby loved the cake (I made it for Valentine's Day, served with chocolate whipped cream) but I think I will use my 7 quart oval Crock Pot next time - used my 5 quart round slow-cooker this time and found the middle was still very wobbly after 3-1/2 hours, so I cooked it for another hour and a half - it was worth the wait.  Thank you for the recipe!

Great cake. Very moist. I didn't have the time to cook it in my crock pot, so I put it in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. 
I changed the recipe a little based on other comments. I used apple sauce instead of oil and I used 1 tablespoon of Stevia to replace 1/2 cup of sugar. Could not tell the difference. Next time I am going to try using more Stevia and less sugar.

Add this to the list of apparent home runs on Allrecipes, that ends up being a big strike out. I don't have anything good to say about this at all. Next time, back to the oven for better, consistent results. This wasted a lot of time and money.

This is the exact recipe as the one on the back of the Hershey's cocoa container. The only difference is the method  of baking.  Personally, it was much easier just to bake it in the oven. 
I don't understand how that one reviewer could say that it was not at all moist. This is the most moist cake of any chocolate cake I have ever made. It is almost too moist. If you hold it, it sticks to your hand. I think the only way it could be dry is if it were over baked. 
I love this recipe. It is my go to cake when I am in a hurry or when I just want to put some cake layers in the freezer for a quick desert.

Flavor was good but hated the texture. From the pics it looks like a nice fluffy cake. But the texture is more like a bread pudding. So, if you're looking for a chocolate bread pudding then this is perfect. If you're looking for a fluffy chocolate cake, I'd just bake one rather than crock pot it.

I made one addition.  While cooking I put a paper towel between the lid and crock to catch the condensation.  I had read about this technique while researching crock pot cake recipes. The paper towel worked.  The cake was moist and cooked through.

This cake turned our perfect but had to add about 45 minutes to cooking time, It says it is rich in the description which is not understating it at all.

My first time making this cake....the idea intrigued me.  I let it "bake" for 3 hours on low and let it sit for 30 minutes.  It was still undone in the center.  If I make it again, I'll let it cook for about half an hour longer.  I called it "chocolate pudding cake" and everyone enjoyed it.  Very tasty, but not worth the time.  Similar to a Texas Sheetcake, but takes much longer to make.

I made it following the recipe, but after 1 hour in the slow cooker it was very liquid, so I added more flour and baked it in the conventional oven for 20min. It was the best chocolate cake ever. I will make it again but in the oven and adding more flour.

Extremely disappointing recipe. After 5 hours of cooking this, exactly as was noted, I turned off my slow cooker & dumped out one horrible gooey mess. Won't make this again.

I made this cake for a small gathering and everyone loved it!
I did not change the recipe at all. The only reason I didn't give it  5 stars is because the timing was off. I started checking on it after cooking about 2 1/2 hours because it smelled a little like it was starting to burn. The edges were getting quite brown so I turned it off and let it rest for 30 minutes like the recipe said. It turned out really moist and delicious with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. I will make this again! Thank You!

Followed the recipe exactly but after 3 hrs on Low it was still very wet, took 5 hrs for the middle to be mostly cooked but was still a bit wet while the outer edge was burnt & bitter tasting. I'll stick with baking.

I made this recipe in a 2 quart slow cooker. This recipe was for a much bigger slow cooker I'm sure, but it turned out surprisingly awesome. it was like a chocolate lava cake. I gave it a bit of a turn to mix the gooey back into the cake. It was a huge hit!

Didn't make any changes.  Had to cook a little bit longer because of the size of my slow cooker.  Only gave it 4 stars because the chocolate cake recipe I use for the oven is a lot lighter .  Very different for what I am use to.

A great cocoa powder is the key to this recipe, I used a bit less,  and it came out great! I also added the water before the other wet ingredients, this bring out the favour more. This is truly a thumbs up recipe!

Made this for the second time today. Substituted almond essence for the vanilla, otherwise exactly as recipe which resulted in a perfect pudding both times. My Morphy Richards Sear & Stew slow cooker needed its medium setting rather than low.
Dead easy and absolutely delicious!

This cake was pretty ok for a crock pot cake. I followed the directions, but was a little afraid the cake may be bitter because of the cocoa, so I put in a little extra sugar. In the end, the cake tasted horrible around the edges but pretty ok in the middle.

I have no idea what the problem is. I followed the recipe exactly and all I got was hot pudding. I even tried letting it cook for an extra 3 hours!!!! The picture made it look like a real cake so imagine my disappointment when we got sludge. I have no problem taking credit for a fail when I do something wrong. The upset here is that no changes were made and it was still a disaster.

Made this exactly as as listed for dessert at a BBQ we had this weekend. Despite leaving it on an extra hour on warm it turned out great. Everyone loved it. Served it with vanilla ice cream on the side. I will definitely make it again!

Fantastic. I have an old-ish crockpot so cooked for 3 and 3/4 hours on low. I'm also a coffee lover and plan to add 1 cup of black coffee instead of water the next time around. Mocha!

This chocolate cake was amazing. It wasn't too sweet. It doesn't need frosting. I made half of the cake recipe, and I was worried that it wasn't done after 3 hours. After I let it cool for awhile it was fine. I have frozen the leftovers.

Made this for the teachers at school and they scraped the crockpot clean!! They loved it. I didn't get a taste, so I only rated it 4 stars, but I'd say it was a success! Will be making it again. (I didn't alter the recipe at all.)

I rated this 5 stars on behalf of my friends because I brought it to a party and by the time I got to it, it was finished! I halved this recipe, because 
1. Cake in a crock pot sounded a little weird, like it would burn on the bottom and 2. I substituted the baking powder (baking soda and lemon juice) and forgot the water. Made correctly, this cake would be incredible!
Guests (at a cooking meetup, no less!) said it was delicious and several asked for the recipe. Let your crock pot make this incredibly easy dessert, you won't regret it!

This was amazing!  I couldn't believe you could bake a cake in a slow cooker, but sure enough you can!  When I first tried it, I was a little unsure.  Its definitely a dense cake and it tasted a little funny to me at first, but once it cooled down and I had more the next day, it tasted like a normal homemade chocolate cake.  I will make this again and impress all my friends.

When I came across this recipe I was very intrigued. I'd never made a cake with a slow cooker. But chocolate is my favorite food group so I thought I'd give it a try. The recipe was super easy and you end up with a pretty big cake. I made it for a dinner party and served it with some caramel whipped cream. Everyone loved it

I made this with only one substitution. The milk. I have a dairy allergy and I used almond milk. I cooked for 2h 50min. It was cooked and super moist! Even more moist day two. We topped with whip cream and loved it! I may add chocolate chips next time for fun.

Same as a lot...sides (especially one side) and bottom burned while center was completely raw.
However the parts that did cook right (about two inches between edges and center) were delicious! We even scraped out the center and baked it again to salvage. 

One alteration: I used 2 Tbsp Coconut Oil, 3 Tbsp Olive Oil and 2 Tbsp Vegetable. This might have been why ours tasted so good compared to some reviews about tasteless or rubbery.

Easy to make moist cake. Family loved! I followed directions but it took a little longer to cook (5 hours) because I'm unsure of what low is on my cooker. Making it again today. Yum!!

This cake is addicting, It's in the crock pot for the 3rd time this week. It's fluffy & moist, so delicious. Today I added 1 cup of crushed walnuts to make it a bit healthier & Im craving walnuts. Also used 3/4 wheat flour. Would have used apple sauce for veggi oil but none on hand. I am completely addicted to this cake, the recipe written as is & also the healthy version. I used 3/4 wheat flour the 2nd time I made this & I couldn't tell the difference.

I thought it tasted like a cross between cake and brownie.  I wasn't too fond of the flavor but my two kids loved it and my husband and in-laws did too.  It took longer than 3 hours.   It wasn't the rich choc. flavor I was hoping for.

I made this exactly as recipe specified and cooked for three hours.  The edges were all burnt and inedible.  However with that said once I cut the edges off by about 1/2 inch all the way around the cake seemed very moist.  I smelled the cake burning before it was anywhere near done in the center….

Not bad but I really wish I had known what size crock pot was used to begin with for the amount of ingredients. I used a 2 qt crock and it overflowed at 1.45 hours. I ended up making mini muffins out of the batter I scooped out of the pot, but what a mess! Once I removed half of the batter, mine cooked up in 4 hours.

My first review! :) Made recipe exactly as stated ( I don't agree with others who change and then rate ). This cake was incredible. Per the author incredibly moist, and so easy to put together. My daughter just had a piece with ice cream and said was the best cake she had ever had; moist like a brownie but light like a cake. Definitely will be making again and again. My only issue was how to get it out of the slow cooker in one piece, not that it matters but any hints would be appreciated!

Made this recipe tonight. Did not change anything. It was okay,but a little dry. I did NOT take the lid off until it had cooked for 3 hours,then sat for 30 min. as recommended by many other reviewers. So I am not sure why it is dry,although I did turn my slow cooker on to preheat while I was making the batter. Maybe that made a difference.I actually thought it would be too soft and moist as the batter was so thin! Has a good taste though,we put Reddi-Whip on top.

Excellent moist and very chocolatey cake!  We loved this.  The only thing I changed was using coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  Will definitely make again.

I really loved the cake . But i want to try sour cream instead of milk to see which way i like it better. What can i say , our family uses sour cream in just about everything, your way is less calories & probably healthier.
 Great job. A+++++

Neither the texture nor the flavor worked in my house.  It was too dense and almost rubbery.  The flavor was...  aggressively bland.  I didn't think it was overly  bitter as some others have complained,  but it definitely wasn't pleasant.

Don't make this if you are in a rush; I thought I could cheat and cook the cake on high for less time.  It fell in the middle and was burnt around the edges.  Even though I burned it, I served it with ice cream on top, and it still got eaten and people enjoyed it.  The only thing I did differently is I added chocolate chips to the batter.  I did that based on the reviews that this cake isn't chocolaty enough. I didn't love it, it's not insanely delicious (even if it wasn't burnt it didn't pack a decadent flavor that I like in a dessert), but it is good and easy to make.  I think it should be plated with a dusting of powdered sugar if you're not topping with ice cream or whipped cream.

This cake did taste good, however it did not bake well.  I had to leave it in the crockpot well over an hour over what the recipe says, and it still wasn't baked all the way!  The edge pieces were baked well enough to eat.  I think the recipe needs to be adjusted in some way so that the baking time is more accurate.

I made this yesterday, managed NOT to lift the lid during the slightly over 3 hours I left it on.  Probably could have turned it off right at 3 hours, but I was watching for it to pull away from the sides, which it finally did after I switched off the heat.  Except for being slightly overdone (a little rubbery) around the edges, it was very moist and tasty.  My husband & I enjoyed a big, warm chunk with ice cream on top.  Very easy to put together.  I think mine is a 4-quart crockpot; it made a pretty oval-shaped cake!

Was looking forward to this recipe but was disappointed. Needs more chocolate flavor and sweetener. Was not in love with the texture as well

This was outstanding and so easy. I just mixed up the ingredients and followed the recipe. The family loved it and so did I. This is definitely a keeper! Thanks so much for the recipe.

I just made this recipe for the first time and was a little apprehensive after reading some of the reviews.  I followed the directions, used a large, 6 qt. crock pot and cooked it with the lid on.  It wasn't done after three hours and ended up cooking for 4 hours.  I pulled the ceramic insert out, and turned the lid to vent the steam while it cooled for 30 minutes.  The texture is hard to explain.  It's very dense at the bottom, where it cooks the most, and creamy, almost like a mousse at the top.  It's got a fantastic chocolate flavor.  We had it with whipped cream on top, but I can't wait to try it with vanilla ice cream when I make it again!

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was insipid and rubbery.  It was easy to prepare and I had high hopes for it.  I will not be making again.

On my 5qt Electric Pressure Cooker, it separated from the wall, I found it was moist,spongy, when I stuck the tooth pick it came out wet.
I probably lost something of understanding the directions of this recepie.

This was crazy good!  Don't know if it's better than any other home made cakes, but it was simple and very moist.  I added dark chocolate chips after I put batter in crock pot.

Tried the recipe.  It would have been great if it hadn't burned.  Temperatures on crock pots differ so make sure you check on it after about 1 1/2 hours to see how well it is cooking.

Like a pudding cake with no sauce.  Very moist and dense.  I lifted the lid at the 3 hour mark and it was still liquid in the middle so I left for another half hour untouched and then removed the lid for the 30 minute rest.  Only change I made was I only have Special Dark Cocoa powder in my pantry and I'm definately not missing the chocolate flavor!

This is not a  fantastic chocolate cake.  It wasn't sweet enough.  It didn't have a lot of chocolate taste.  It took longer than the 3 hours to get the middle to solidify.  I'll stick to the oven way of baking a cake.

This was a fun experiment.  It wasn't amazing.  However, we did like it with vanilla ice cream but I probably won't make it again.

Super rich.....must serve with ice cream.  I might need to cook longer, since it was the consistency of bread pudding, which I don't prefer.  Super easy! :)

This is excellent! I had to sub corn oil for vegetable oil, and accidentally added extra hot water (about 1/8 cup). Also forgot the vanilla extract. Still, the cake came out delicious, rich and moist, with a texture somewhere in between custard and cake-the top half was custardy and bottom half more cakey. It does not taste undercooked at all, though it was still plenty wet on top near the center(I cooked for exactly 3 hours, then removed top after 30 min. like recipe says-it did pull away from sides). No need for frosting, but perfect with vanilla frozen yogurt. Can't wait to eat this straight from the refrigerator! I love the fact that the entire mixing process can be done quickly with a whisk instead of a mixer. I'll be sure to add extra hot water each time to get the same results. Thank you for this delicious recipe!

one of the best cakes i've ever had! i will be making it again for sure. moist and very flavorful and above all else, it had a true chocolate depth without being overwhelming. sometimes chocolate can be a punch in the face, but this is a well balanced cake that can be served to most age groups. you don't really need to add anything save a dusting of powdered sugar. perfection!!!

Super! I have now done a re-calculation for 8 as the original is too much for 2 people.  I use spelt flour for all my baking and carob in place of chocolate.  Turns out beautifully - rich, tasty and very moist.  Thank you to the person who supplied the recipe.  An extra bonus...since it's so hot right now, I just put the slow cooker on the balcony - no inside heat!

I was so excited for this cake and followed the recipe exactly. Kept it in a little longer though. It amazingly was very tasteless even though it looked very chocolatey. I would not recommend this to anyone.
