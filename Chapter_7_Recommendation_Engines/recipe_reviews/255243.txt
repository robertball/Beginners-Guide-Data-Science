2.8.17    I'm  typically the one who's always saying "it's too sweet," but for this recipe,  I did add some sugar after blending the smoothie.  I used unsweetened soy milk and thought the maple syrup just might bring enough sweetness, but felt the unsweetened cocoa just dominated.  That little bit of sugar balanced it out (could be personal taste preference).  You definitely will taste both the chocolate and the strawberries, and I like the way this breaks down nutritionally.
