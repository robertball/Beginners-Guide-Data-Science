I did the exact same as the original recipe however I prefer a meatier pizza. I cooked 2 chicken breasts and sliced them in to pizza style strips and threw them on there. The result was the most delicious pizza I've ever tasted. Amazing recipe.  PS I went to Dominos to get my pizza dough and they sold it to me for a $1.00. They even rolled it flat for me eliminating the hardest part of this recipe.

With some changes my husband thought this pizza was awesome.  First I always use Jay's Signature Pizza crust from this site (love it).  Second, we microwaved our potatoes to speed up the process.  I used a combination of sour cream and low fat hidden valley ranch dressing (as suggested by others) and it was scrumptious.  I'm glad I did that because I feel that the sour cream alone would have been very bland.  We really enjoyed this new spin on our pizza...thanks for sharing.

This is too funny, I have this exact recipe from a calendar I got last year.  Word for word, measure for measure with one exception... my recipe has 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup ranch.  It really is a great recipe, don't be shy about piling it high either!

Definitely a 5 star recipe!  Delicious!  I followed the recommendations to add chicken strips for heartiness and use half sour cream and half ranch (I used bacon ranch) to boost the flavor.  I also used more cheddar than mozzarella and added some sharp cheddar for additional flavor. Really easy - especially if you take advantage of the $1 premade crust at Domino's.  Just for fun I may try mixing chili seasoning with the sour cream instead of the ranch, but I'll definitely make it this way again.

My husband and I play cards every Friday night with friends. When I made this for our friends they absolutely loved it. There was not one piece left. To make it quicker I have put the potatoes in the microwave and cooked them. You cannot tell the difference

This pizza is awesome!  My husband kept saying, "we are making this again".  We bought the pre-cooked and crumbled bacon to reduce the time and that worked great!  Another way we reduced time was to cook the potatoes in the microwave, worked just as good.  I also took another reviewers advice and mixed 1/2 cup ranch dressing with 1/2 cup sour cream.  This is definately a must, it really helps give more flavor to the pizza.  The spices on the potatoes smell so good and taste great as well but next time I think I'll double (if not triple) this.  1/4 teaspoon did not seem like enough.

My BF and I were skeptical about this but it was surprisingly very good!  I tripled the seasoning and added garlic salt and garlic pepper.  I also followed others' advice and used 1/2 C of sour cream and 1/2 C of ranch!  Thanks for the recipe!

This pizza was divine!  If you are into easy pizza recipes with a gourmet flair, then this is the one for you!  I followed the recipe to a "T".  I used the Jiffy brand pizza crust.  It was delicious!  I agree with some of the previous reviews, that the addition of ranch (maybe half ranch, half sour cream) would really shine in this pizza.  I also felt like it needed a little salt, but that is personal preference!  Even with the changes I mentioned, I still had to rate it 5 stars "as is" because it really is worth trying!

I used to buy a baked potato pizza from a local deli until they closed down. This is a very close match, and perfect when you want a change from traditional pizza.  I made this recipe almost exactly, the only change I made was I mixed sour cream and ranch dressing.  Very, very yummy.  Thanks for the recipe!

This pizza was delicious!  I cut it into small cubes for a Super Bowl party, and everyone loved it!  I made a few small changes to this recipe, as suggested by other reviewers.  These include adding cooked chicken, which I cubed, and using ranch dressing to replace half of the sour cream.  I also microwaved the potatoes to save time.  Next time I try this, I will cut the potatoes into smaller pieces, and I will use homemade dough.  This recipe is a keeper!

I loved it. My husband thought it was ok but he's not a sour cream fan. I mixed ranch with the sour cream to add some flavor as suggested in previous reviews. I also diced some left over italian sausage and added it to my husbands half and sprinkled to some blue cheese crumbles on my half. It's a great  "clean the fridge out" recipe.

Not my favorite, sorry.  I love loaded baked potatoes and wanted to try it.  I read most all the reviews and decided to go with as is.  Unfortunately,  I thought it was pretty bland and unremarkable.  It needs salt, pepper, seasoning, etc.  Mine turned out to be a bit labor intensive as I had not baked the potatoes in advance.  If you're going to make this, make sure you have your potatoes and bacon ready before preparing.   I'm giving it three stars because my guys 'sort of' like it (not their favorite though) - but if it were just I, it would be about two stars, especially considering the carbs/calories.  Thanks though - it's always nice to try something new!

Wow! This was really good. I did make changes per other reviewers and I'm glad I did. First, I cubed the potato's and boiled them. I mashed them up by hand with salt, pepper and garlic (left out the italian seasoning) I used 1/2 sourcream and 1/2 ranch for the base. I switched the cheeses around and used mainly cheddar with a little bit of mozz. The hubs didn't want it leftover the next day, but I insisted he eat it. He LOVED it leftover over too. Thanks for a great recipe. However I highly suggest the 1/2 sourcream and ranch to give the base more flavor.

I am rating for the idea, which is great!  BUT, READ SUGGESTIONS FIRST!!!!  As is, I don't think it would have been worth making again.  Doctored up, its great, very hearty.  Make sure your crust will hold up to toppings as well.  I happened to find one that worked so well.  I did read comments before making this.  I used half ranch, half sour cream.  I Prebaked the potatoes well in advanced, I thnk 3 may be too many if adding other toppings.  I had a super flavorful crust with garlic and italian seasonings, so the sour cream/ranch was good, but I added one minced garlic clove, and about 1/4 cup parm cheese to that, added potatoes, cut 1/2 ring of Kielbasa and mixed with some onions, put 2 handfulls of Colby Jack shredded cheese and that is it.  Baked it for about 16 min or so.  Turned out great this way.  Would be great with ham and swiss cheese or cheddar.  Just keep in mind the number of potatoes you put on, if your gonna put on meats.  Make the 3 spuds, but if you don't use them all, just mash them up and use them for something else.

Thank you Gina, as this is a terrific recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to use proscuitto instead of bacon.  The next time I try it I may use frozen hash browns, just for the convenience.  Baked potato pizza...what a great idea!  Thanks.

This is good. I didnt have an ranch (as other reviewers suggested to add) so I added a little French onion soup mix to the sour cream. Next time I will play around with the flavors of the sour cream. I also will cut the potato a little smaller.

Very easy; I used a premade crust and then just added the ingredients on top. If you are looking for something a little different this is it. Could be used for any meal! Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner!

YUM. We had some modifications:

• Tripled the spices. Didn't have Italian spice so we used oregano, basil, and pepper.
• Added about 1 cup of broccoli. We just added it frozen right before putting in the oven.
• Instead of 1 cup sour cream, we did 1/4 c sour cream, 1/4 c ranch dressing, and 1/4 c pizza sauce. I think this was the biggest improvement. (My husband was skeptical about the pizza sauce so we actually did half the pizza with the sauce and half without, but we agreed the half with sauce was better.)

We'll be making it again!

This was just ok for us.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out tasting very bland.  I am not one that uses much salt, but we had to add salt and more sour cream on the top to make it taste like an actual baked potato.  A loaded baked potato would have tasted better, and been much less work.  Even the kids didn't like it.  I won't make it again.

I wasnt sure about this, but I tried it anyway and it was good.  My only change I would make next time is to add more sour cream and spices

This was different, but good!  Maybe a little too much starchiness for me in one sitting, but it was fun to try!  I cheated and used the real bacon pieces by Hormel cause I didn't realize I was out of bacon.  For the crust I used Valentino's Pizza Crust from this site!  Nice pizza!

This was definitely and different pizza recipe, I felt it was a little bland as far as the sour cream sauce. the sauce just needs a little more pizzazz.

My family loved this, with my elderly mother declaring it was the best pizza she ever had.  I'm using their ratings rather than my own since I'm not a potato person.  I used thin crust pizza in a tube (11 oz) from the grocery refrig case which pressed into a jelly roll pan.  As per other suggestions, I mixed the sour cream with spicy ranch dressing - a great modification!

I followed other reviews and added 1/2 a cup of sour cream and 1/2 a cup of ranch, except the ranch was a chipotle ranch! It had a nice little kick to it.

I made this using a premade whole wheat thin crust.  The only changes I made was using red potatoes instead.  I cubed and boiled them instead of baking the potatoes.  I also didn't use quite as much cheese.  This is the second time I have made this and I definitely will make it again soon!

I also used 1/2 ranch & 1/2 sour cream - which I think is a must on this (it needed that extra flavor).  I made homemade crust (actually used Jay's Signature pizza crust from this site as suggested by another reviewer).  My potatoes were from the garden & huge so I only used 2 - I chopped them & boiled them instead of baking because they were so big I was worried they wouldn't bake well.  I used some extra garlic/italian butter & brushed the crust with it because it was a thick crust.  I made the bacon & crumbled it on the last 5 min of baking or so because I didn't want it to get soggy from the cheese - I don't even think it's necessary to bake it with the bacon on & 6 pieces was enough but could always use more.  Very filling & obviously not the healthiest dish - but really tasty.  Looking forward to trying the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

I like the idea of this recipe and as written we felt it lacked flavor and depth and was only a 3 star recipe.  The second time I made made changes and it turned out much better.  First, I brushed the crust with garlic olive oil and prebaked it for 5 minutes.  Then I did use the half ranch, half sour cream mix others recommended but used less - only 3/4 cup total.  I used less mozzarella, more onion and more bacon.  The most significant change though, was the preparation of the potato.  I thinly sliced 1 potato only and cut the slices in half.  I then sauted the raw slices in a little bit of butter with salt and pepper until they were tender, yet had a slight crunch on the outside.  I laid them on the crust and then added the onion, bacon and cheddar.  This was so much more flavorful and balanced and is a pizza we'll repeat.

I am always looking for creative ways to use potatoes, and this pizza was awesome...it really did taste like a loaded baked potato pizza!  I served it with ranch dressing as a side to dip in.

As written I give this 4 stars but with some little tweeks it is 5 stars. Suprisingly delicious. Yes it does taste like a loaded baked potato. I thought my hubby would complain about no meat for supper but he enjoyed this dish LOL. I did as past reviewers suggested and used half sour cream and half ranch dressing. The seasonings could be upped a bit also. I added 5 green onions and more bacon. I agree with another reviewer that some added cubed cooked chicken would be a nice addition. Make sure you grease your pizza pan well as I had a terrible time with it sticking.

I just made this pizza and it was SO GOOD.  I used a prepared crust instead of making my own, and it was smaller than the one in the recipe, so the next time I make it I'll reduce the ingredients a bit. I also added ground beef to the bacon.  I think it's still missing something though, but I  can't put my finger on what it is.  But I will definitely make it again.

With the combonation of ingredients, this would be suitable for a main dish or an appitizer. It was easy to make and tasted great. If you like a good baked potato, you will have fun with this. Get The Kids Involved!

I made this yesterday, my family loved it. It is something different. I did the half sour cream half ranch like suggested. I made two pizzas one like the original recipe calls for except for more bacon and the second I used some left over BBQ chicken (slow cooker bbq chicken from this site. My family liked that one the best. But both were great!

Excellent and filling.  I made homemade crust ("Quick and Easy Pizza Crust" from this site).  Doubled the garlic powder and Italian seasonings (used a rosemary garlic italian mix).  I used 4 russet potatoes instead of 3 medium potatoes because they seemed on the small side.  I cubed the potatoes and boiled them and then mashed them with the melted butter and seasonings.  As other reviewers advised I did 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup of ranch dressing.  I saved a bit for dipping because it seemed like a lot to put on the pizza.  I used vegetarian bacon (so the meal was vegetarian).  I used about 1 cup of cheddar cheese on top.  I did not use the mozzarella.  The pizza was not bland at all.  Next time I would consider putting broccoli on it.

Very good!  I read the recipe wrong so I added the potatoes with the garlic, sour cream, butter and mashed them all together and it turned out perfect! Next time I will add 1/2 cup of ranch like the other's suggested because I think it will add the zip it needs.  I also topped with brocolli and didn't add the mozzerella and only topped with probably 1/3 cup of chedder chesse.  I also used a pre-made crust to save time.  yum, yum yum!

Awesome idea with mass appeal! I agree with the other reviewers that this is a little bland as written, but certainly easy enough to season up to your taste. Fat- and carbtastic, this is a great guilty pleasure lunch or dinner - and very simple to make. I used a prebaked crust to make it one notch simpler. I can see doing several of these ahead of time for a game night or casual party. Thanks for the recipe!

I used light sour cream and one-third of the Pizza Dough II recipe (that recipe makes 3 crusts), then baked it on a pizza stone at 500 degrees for about 8 min. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. It came out wonderfully. Actually it was even better the next day at breakfast.

This is almost the exact recipe I have been trying to submit to AllRecipes for 2 years now.  Maybe I should submit to Taste of Home first as they seem to get the recipes on here faster.  Sorry for the rant - this recipe is really good and you won't be sorry if you try it.

I made this as directed and something major seemed to be missing... I can't put my finger on it, maybe an herb or something. It is a good basis to start with, so I'm sure if you played around with it it could be great, but as is, is not something I would make again.

Followed the recipe as written and this didn't turn out well. The flavors were pretty enjoyable, but the pizza was too bulky with ingredients and awkward to eat. Also, the edges of the crust burned before the middle became hot. Will have to work on this, but as written, it didn't come out well for me.

Don't know what I did wrong, thought I followed recipe to the tee. It was SO bland, something needs to be changed here. But, don't think I'll try again.

My kids recently visited a pizza restaurant near us that specializes in a baked potato pizza and loved it.  I was really pleased to find this recipe and I followed it exactly.  My kids loved it.  It is very easy to make and a great change from traditional pizza.

Excellent!  I cook homemade pizzas usually once a week and this turned out to be a great addition to our menu.  The only thing I change, was homemade pizza crust and added a sprinkling of garlic salt to compliment the flavor.

I made this yesterday and it was very fun and different.  I did as other people suggested and used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 ranch.  We added more bacon and we needed something to spice it up so we added jalapenos.  Will make again!

I was looking for something different for our annual New Years Eve theme dinner party. This year was pizza night. My family and especially myself were so impressed with it, I made it again for the Packer game 2 days later. I chose to make a homade crust but Im sure the outcome would've been just as good! Very very yummy.

This pizza was okay tasting. I thought it was a bit of a carb overload. I subbed a little ranch dressing in with the sour cream, and that addition tasted great.

This was a little difficult to make for me but I have never used pizza crust mix, and I had a hard time rolling it out.  The overall product was good but I thought it was a little bland.  However, I may have had high expectations as I thought this was going to taste just like Uno's pizza skins.  But it was good

Loved it!! Made it for a New Years Eve Party and ended up whipping up another one because everyone loved it! I made the first one exactly like the recipe says. The second one I was out of Italian Seasoning so just seasoned with some garlic powder and seasoning salt. I also did half sour cream and half ranch. Liked it better with the ranch and no Italian seasoning. Great recipe though!!!

could be great with tweaks.....  i made this as instructed and it didn't scream baked potato since many bites only had one or two flavors.  if i make it again, i would mash the potatoes (without milk or butter) for a more even base, use less sour cream (it was a lot for a 14" pie), not use mozzarella at all and increase the cheddar cheese.  also, i wasn't a fan of the seasoning on the potatoes... porbably would just use salt and pepper next time.

Great recipe. My son who is a pizza fanatic loved it. I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup ranch dressing as suggested in other reviews. Also, I had some real bacon bits which was an easier alternative to cooking and crumbling bacon.

This has to be one of best pizzas ever!  I did use homemade pizza crust and omited the Italian seasoning (personal preference).  I also seasoned the potatoes with some salt and pepper. My husband even took leftovers for lunch, which he never does.

I loved the potatoes, bacon, green onions, & cheese.  I used a packaged crust mix (which I rarely use) and was not happy with it at all.  It was bland and didn't brown properly.  I think next time I will make a homemade crust, combine the sour cream with some ranch dressing, and omit the Italian seasoning.  I'll stick to basil & garlic instead.  Thanks for the recipe-- I will definitely make it again!

Definitely a keeper!  Substituted ham for bacon only because I had some already cooked, and chose to add 1/2c sour cream & 1/2c ranch dressing for a little more flavor.  Son said he really liked the potatoes and spices and asked if I would make them as a side dish sometime.  Great recipe, thanks!

So good!  I really don't think it needed the italian seasoning if you add Ranch instead, but that was about the only thing I would change.  We also just used canned potatoes (since that is what we had in the kitchen) and it still turned out amazing.

This is good, but needs a few changes to be a five star recipe.  First I would use garlic salt rather than garlic powder on my potatoes next time and double the Italian seasonings.  Using just sour cream for a  base is 'bleh'.  You really need to use ranch dressing, at least half ranch, half sour cream, although I will make it with all ranch dressing next time.  I like to eat this with salsa.  I will make it again with all of these changes.

I followed this recipe pretty closely, but I thought it was just okay.  I wish I had done as other reviewers suggested and used half ranch dressing in the sauce.  I tried dipping my pizza in ranch and that made it much more flavorful.  My main complaint about this recipe is that it's somewhat bland.  If you love baked potatoes, though, you'll probably like this pizza.

This was REALLY good.  I used pillsbury pizza crust.  Doubled the garlic powder and italian seasoning.  My husband LOVED it. My picky 6 year old even took a few bites!  Will make this for friends at first opportunity.

This is good.  I used Turkey bacon for this and 1/2 cup ranch dressing and 1/2 cup fat free sour cream for the sauce.  This seemed like too much so I used the rest for dipping sauce.  Thanks for a unique recipe.

I decided to search out a Potato Pizza Recipe after missing my old pizza place in my old town. This recipe was very close! I decided to use fresh dough from Publix (already made in a ball). I baked it at 450 for 7 minutes until it was a little brown. Then I changed the temp to 400 and baked for 15 minutes and it came out perfect. I think one of my potatoes was a little too big as there was quite a few on there which seemed to dry it out a little. Next time I might try and cut the potatoes like scalloped potatoes as that is how it was at the restaurant. Husband says it needs more bacon - but he loves bacon! Will definitely make again!!!

This was delicious!  My family loved it! I made it just as the recipe stated, but I substituted light ranch dressing for the sour cream.  I also used a dry crust mix.  It turned out wonderfully and I have even given this recipe out!  Bravo!

I used the refrigerated pizza crust in a can. I think next time I won't put it in the oven first, it came out too crispy and made the overall taste too crusty and not enough like a baked potato. It was still good, but I will definitely tweak the recipes ingredients if I make it again.

Great alternative to the usual pepperoni pizza.
