Excellent! These were very creamy as the recipe title states! I cut the recipe in half and since I didn't have goat cheese, light cream cheese fit the bill.  I also lightened them up by using Land O Lakes light butter and skim milk.  I added a little salt and pepper and loved the fresh dill and chives. This was the perfect accompaniment to breaded pork chops!

Mmmmm, these were some gooood mashed potatoes! Hubs won't eat goat cheese, so cream cheese was an easy substitution. I used unpeeled, baby Yukon Golds and didn't measure the rest of the ingredients, just added them to taste along with salt and freshly ground pepper.  The creaminess of the potatoes, made even creamier with the cream cheese, along with the fresh flavors of dill and chives made these irresistably delicious.

I did not have chives or dill at home but I made them still and used whipped cream cheese instead of goat cheese, left the skins on, and whipped them with an electric hand mixer and they were the creamiest potatoes ever! No gravy needed

Oh my goodness.  I used cream cheese and added a few tablespoons of butter that I had sauted fresh garlic in.  My usually ho-hum mashed potatos were transformed into something heavenly.  The kids didn't even want gravy on them they were so good by themselves!

Great!  Used Parmasan and a touch of basil.  My theory is that almost anything is better with Basil!  So I skipped the dill...LOL

This is one of our favorite potato recipes!!! I have used both chives and green onion and both work well.  Super flavorful! Yay for some seriously tasty tatoes!!!

I really loved it, but my dad and my aunt only just like it and my mom said yeck, I hate goat cheese. So I guess this dish isn't quite for everyone, but for me, personally, I woulld give it a five.

I like creamy potatoes, my family likes them a little stiffer & thicker, I just cut down on the milk, drained most of the water, when I mashed them I left some little chunks, not hard, just something to bite on. My husband said his father would like these because they are  kind "soupy". The flavor is ok, just don't add gravey or you have potatoe soup.   Maybe I did something wrong & will try again. The picture they show is not the best! Looks a like a big glob.

I haven't made these yet but I can only imagine how good they will be with goat cheese. I'll bet if they didn't know it was goat cheese they would still eat it. GC is better for your gut than cream cheese and mixed with chives and dill you wouldn't be able to detect it. It would be super smooth!

Didn't have any goat cheese last time I made them so I used triple cream brie instead. Next time I'm going to use caramelized onions instead of the chives.  Great base recipe as it stands but easy to change a bit & is still really good!

Not as good as the goat cheese idea sounds like it could be - doesn't add to the flavour much. This recipe is decent as far as mashed potatoes go, but nothing to rave about.

Delicious! Very easy to make, and a great mix of flavors. The goat cheese makes the potatoes really rich, and the dill and chives gives them a nice seasoning. Definitely one to make again when I need a versatile side dish.

For these sour mashed potatoes, I used fresh ingredients as suggested. The goat cheese is a very powerful flavor. This is a good dish that is best eaten in small quantities.

My guest raved about them. My husband is eating leftover  right now. If Mr. Selective likes them then all should like them. I am not a potato eater, but found them very good.

An expensive potato dish, but if you like goat cheese you will enjoy this.
