Generally very good taste, comparable to restaurant quality.  Recipe did not say to blend/puree after cooking, which I think is necessary.  I found the worcesterchire added a sour note and will omit it next time.  I made it without added salt and did not feel it needed salt when served.

This soup was very delicious!  The only thing I did different was puree the vegetables in the food processor after cooking and added a little heavy whipping cream which made the soup creamy and yummy!  I will definitely make this again.

YUMMY! I'm 16 weeks pregnant and craving tomato soup like mad since coming back from India this week. This cured the craving and I know hubby will LOVE it!

I didn't have many fresh veggies since returning, but I had onions. And, I used 1 can of crushed tomatoes and 1 can of seasoned tomatoes with onion and celery. Because of the heat level in India I had to add more hot sauce though. 

I'll make this again!

----- October 23, 2008 ----

He loved it, and it is a classic staple in our kitchen. Thanks Corwyn, your soup recipes are the BEST. Google Corwyn and you will find great soups :)

I served this for our weekly "Meatless Monday" along with grilled cheese sandwiches and a green salad.  Even our teen that doesn't like tomato soup had 3 bowls (I had adjusted the recipe for 10 servings).  I did tweak this recipe a bit.  My basil plant is looking sad, so I added about 2 TBS fresh pesto.  Instead of simmering on the stove top, I put everything into the crock pot on high for about an hour and added fat free 1/2 and 1/2 at the end.  I left out the Worcestershire because we didn't have any vegetarian and no hot pepper sauce as my hubby doesn't do spicy.  I added veggie broth to the veggies after sauteing and simmered them a bit and ran that mixture through the blender.  I put the tomatoes in the blender too, but left some chunks.  I boiled up some fun shapped pasta for the kids to add in if they wanted.  There is not a drop of this soup left.

Great recipe! I added a bit of soy milk for a creamy texture (cream probably works well, too). I also added 1/2 tsp. each of cardamom and garam masala and a pinch of sugar. Everyone loved it!

LOW SODIUM VERSION
I made this soup today and it was delicious!! As most people do I made some changes to cut down on the sodium to make a reduced sodium version. I sauted some carrot, celery, onion and cucumber in olive oil with garlic  and worchestshire.Then I added no salt chicken stock and with my hand blender blizted til smooth. Then I added a can of italian plum tomatoes (Gigi brand) and blitzed.  These tomatoes only contain natural salt no added salt. I let this simmer for an hour. I did also add a dash of sugar to help with the acidity. This soup was wonderful.

My husband really loved this and I didn't like it quite as much. I only put in half the salt, but it was still too salty for me. It was also a bit heavy on the Worcestershire sauce. I would make it again, but I would put in half the Worcestershire sauce and maybe just 1/4 tsp salt.

OK.  this was not what I wanted, I wanted a smooth tomato soup so even after pureeing, didn't give me what I wanted, but the flavour....yum, yum!  Still a delicious soup, on day two I added a half cup of wild rice blend with barley and stuff and it was even better!  I would definately make this again.

Simple and delicious.  A classic tomato soup.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable and regular worcestershire and pureed the soup at the end with an immersion blender.  Yum!

4.5 stars. I did change a few things i.e., fresh tomatoes vs canned, 1/2C of carrot & celery, used my own chicken stock and left out the worcestershire and hot sauce. I added a few additonal herbs (parsley/rosemary). I did saute the carrot/celery/onion in olive oil. I had approx 8 cups of cleaned/chunked up of my own grown tomatoes. After everything simmered for awhile in a large pot, I used my stick blender & went to town on it. Because I like my soup smooth, I then utilized a fine mesh strainer to get rid of excess pulp/seed/skins, etc. I used roasted garlic vs raw & instead of salt I used 1/2 tsp Mortons 'natures seasoning'. Yes, I spent more time by doing things this way but it was fantastic. I added about 1/2 C of 2% milk b4 serving for a creamier soup. Easy to adapt with fresher ingredients and I'm thinking some shredded zucchini or spinach would be good addition too! Well, get creative and make it your own. :)

This is the perfect recipe. I've tried many on this site, and this one is the only one we use now. The only thing I do different is use fresh tomatoes and crush the garlic. Thanks! :)

Excellent soup!!!  Wow!   I used regular worcestershire; and fresh tomatoes along with the canned.  I added spinach to kick up the nutrition.  As a last step, I pulsed it through the blender.  Thank you for sharing!!

I have been making this soup weekly for 6 months. We love it. I use fresh tomatoes, same weight amount, diced and added with the celery and carrots. We love it chunky or blended. We eat it plain or add meat, vegetables, beans or pasta.

I'm not a huge fan of tomato soup but this is fantastic! After I simmered the soup, I went ahead and took half of it, pureed it and added it back in the soup for extra tomato flavor. If you like it completely smooth like traditional tomato soup, then I suggest pureeing the whole thing; but I like a little chunk in mine.

As a tomato soup lover....I thought this soup was disgusting. Not much flavor.  Had to add more salt and pepper and parsley and bit of cream just to eat it....

Yum!!!! Sitting here having my 1st bowl of this fab rich hearty soup. Just the recipe I have being looking for. Trying o be good and keep things low fat so I just used a cooking spray instead of the oil and next time  I might try basil instead of a few chili flakes to replace the hot sauce I didn't have. Colour and texture are fab!

I wanted to find a good tomato soup recipe, but was very disappointed in this. It tasted like pasta sauce. After cooking as directed, I added every dairy product I could find in my fridge (low fat milk, half and half and finally sour cream.) It helped, but I still felt bad serving this to my family. Won't make it again, even with changes.

Delicious!  Just a couple tweaks: I left out the worchestshire per other reviews and omitted hot sauce since I wanted my kids to eat it (let my husband add that to his own after).  I added some diced red pepper for a little sweetness and extra healthfulness.  I also pureed and added some cream to creamy it up after.  YUMMY!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Used this for a Youth Group luncheon.  Converted it to feed 150 along with grilled cheese sandwiches and it was a hit.  I pureed the onions, carrots and celery for those that like a smooth tomato soup.  Requests to serve it again for other functions.

Great recipe that you can change around as you like. My first batch I added extra zip with crushed red pepper, Ro-tel spicy, more garlic, etc.  With those left overs, I added more plain canned tomatoes and two handfulls of pasta. My 9 yr old said that was the best soup he ever had!  Next time making it, I added a pound of ground turkey for a very filling meal.  Thanks for a keeper recipe!

The worcestershire sauce made it inedible.  This could be my fault as maybe vegetarian worcestershire isn't the same; as in completely different??  If I'd had the hindsight to leave out the worcestershire it might have been a 3 as written.  It needs to be pureed or some rounds in the pan with an immersion blender and personal preference it needs some heavy cream to make it creamy or otherwise with the ingredients left, you have a generic pasta sauce.

Very successfull soup for a difficult eater (daughter) who does not like homemade soups. (I suspect the tinned soups are full of sugar)

I was not a slave to the ingredients here. I just took what I had in the cupboard herb wise, and included dried basil (which is always nice with tomatoes) and one sweet potato. I did not use celery as I dont really like it. I used red onions as I prefer their taste. 

I lightly fried the onions, garlic, herbs, sweet potatoes, carrots, salt and pepper then added the stock/broth and worchester sauce with one cardboard container of chopped tomates and boiled until the onions were tender - which was about 15 to 20 minutes. Blend and eat directly with a french baguette Delicious . You could add a second box of crushed tomatoes if you want a thicker soup.

So all you should need to buy are onions, garlic and tomatoes depending on how well stocked your store cupboard is. I always have worchester sause in as I use it to marinate white fish (15-20 mins) which I then dip in bread crumbs and fry - takes 5 mins to cook and is a delicious late night supper.

DEE-licious! I omitted the worchestire sauce though, due to my own personal taste. Also, pureed for just one quick whirl and the soup turned out smooth-chunky, just the way I love my soup. I would highly recommend this recipe.

I made this soup in a dinner for mother's day, and everyone loved it!
I followed the recipe exactly like mentioned, but i blended it at the end to get a softer texture.

So yum! Made a huge batch of this and some cheddar biscuits and having been enjoying it a lot these past few nights. The amount of pepper might be a bit spicy for some. Just play with the spices and get it how you want it. I also added some oregano, then white sugar to balance out the saltiness. Turned out perfect :)

I love tomato soup, but can no longer tolerate the sweetness and often chemical taste of canned soups.  This recipe is what I have been looking for.  My only tweaks were to reduce hot sauce by 1/2, add 1/2 tsp more salt, and add 3/4 tsp sugar (to eliminate the tang/sourness).  With tweaks, definitely 5 stars.  Yummy!

I added 1/2 a sweet pepper to the mix of vegetables and blended it all together after cooking, like a couple of the other reviewers. It was fabulous! This was my first attempt at making tomato soup and I will definitely do it again!

I wanted to make tomato soup for lunch and didn't have any canned soup.  I was lacking in a few of the ingredients.  I had to use dried minced onions instead of fresh.  Instead of carrots I used a pint jar of home canned sweet potatoes.   I had some left-over frozen turkey stock from the holidays.  Such a simply delicious recipe.  I also pureed it to hide the veggies from my picky kid.  A big hit in our house and it was my first attempt at tomato soup.

This soup is amazing... I didn't measure the worcestercer and added a few more drops of hot pepper sauce (by accident!) and got a spicy delicious very warming hearty vegetarian soup. Try it, you'll like it!

Recipe is a good starter.  As is, is bland. I seasoned to taste as follows: added onion & garlic powder; fresh lemon juice & zest (whole lemon), 1/4C red & white wine; sauteed other veggies-eggplant, red & green peppers, leeks & red pepper flakes.  Also added appx 1/4C heavy cream, feta & cream cheese to taste because I love! After additions, soup's divine! I just threw all ingredients into pot quickly, bro't to a boil, simmered & processed.  Next time I'll take time & roast tomatoes & other veggies 1st.

Great Recipe! I added upon recomendation some half & half,  along with some sugar, a can of corn, and a few other micellanious spices. I was hoping for a more creamy soup, as in texture. However, the tomatos were pretty big chunks, in a watery broth. I pureed about 2/3 of the soup, and it made a much nicer consistency.

Hey everyone, I just made this recipe.  Just a simple change up.  I sautéed the veggies in olive oil, then poured a little of the tomato puree in the pan, then whipped this real good in the vitamix, then continued with the rest of the ingredients.  Very simple and vegan.   We dipped toasted cheese sandwiches in the soup, perfect for fall.

I loved this. I didn't add celery, thyme, or Worcestershire sauce though. I premed at the end. I was a little worried about no cream or milk in it, but it definitely didn't need it. Great as is. Will be making again for sure!!!!

I made this soup yesterday and we loved it!  I made a couple changes to make just a bit healthier.  I sautéed the veggies in dry white wine to omit the fat and we wanted a pureed, creamy soup so instead of adding heavy cream I added a can of white beans, drained and rinsed before pureeing.  Makes it thick and creamy and all you're adding is healthy fiber and protein!  I also added a handful of fresh basil, just because I love the flavor.

I won't lie--followed the recipe exactly, and it just kinda tasted less like tomato soup and more like really watery tomato sauce. I thickened it up and used it the next day for a pasta sauce, but my normal pasta sauce tastes better so...probably won't make again.

Excellent tomato soup!  It's very easy to make and tastes great so I make it often.  I stick my immersion blender in the pot and blend it until smooth.  This is my favorite tomato soup recipe!

It's a rainy day in March and I feel like I am eating right out of the garden in August.  This soup is SO very fresh tasting.  I added a spec of heavy cream but it almost felt sinful because it was already way delish.  YUMMY!

Great recipe! I doubled it to have some for freezing. I made a few changes... I used olive oil, homemade chicken & turkey broth, diced tomatoes, regular worcestershire sauce, and added a red bell pepper. I let it simmer about 35 minutes and used my stick blender while it was still hot to blend it up smooth. Doubling the recipe I ended up with enough for about 6 or 7 lunches and enough for another 2 servings I sent home with my Mom.

A lot of work to make this soup.  I like creamy soup without chunks so I used the emersion blender and then strained it to make a smooth soup.  The flavor was nice but I would cut down on the worcestershire sauce, it is a strong taste.  I think I will try another recipe next time.

Loved this recipe! Very quick and easy to make and quite filling. I added bell pepper to the vegetables that are sauteed (which I had diced up quite small), used rosemary for one of the seasonings, added just a splash of cream, and had to use onion powder since I didn't realize that I was out of onions. I did not use any of the other seasonings listed except a pinch of salt. Also, I used only one of the 28 ounce cans of tomato (I used diced) and then added one large fresh tomato, pureed to the sauteed vegetable. Threw in the last bit of spinach I had just to go ahead and use it. 
These are a lot of changes but I think it shows how versatile the soup can be if you stick with the base ingredients. I will definitely make this again and would consider using this as a pasta sauce.

This is an excellent recipe and I will make it again! I made a couple of changes: fresh tomatoes, diced red peppers instead of celery, a few sloshes of red wine instead of W'shire sauce, and I added about a cup of soy milk at the very end after I pureed the soup. Delicious!

I didn't have nor particularly care for thyme so used Italian seasoning and substituted vegetable broth for water. 
I also used the canned tomatoes with basil.

It was so good my daughter said she wants Tomato soup when she gets sick instead of chicken noodle.

This will definitely be part of my monthly menu. Taste good hot or cold and can be for lunch or dinner.

Very good soup. I omitted the salt and Worcestershire (I'm a salt lover and this soup definitely didn't need the addition). It was a bit acidic, so I added some sugar. Chopped the carrots very thin so that they'd soften nicely. I ended up simmering for about 50 minutes to thicken it slightly. The resulting texture was very good and needed no blending.

Very good. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, stewed tomatoes because that's what I had, omitted the Worcestershire, added a tsp. or so of chicken boullion and pureed the whole thing before simmering. YUM!

One addition just to cut the strong tomato tartness was a bit of sugar or brown sugar.  Just a little at a time to your liking will mellow the tartness.  I would recommend running the sauteed veggies through a processor also just to keep the pieces very small.  Overall very nice recipe.

This was delicious! However, I eliminated the worcestershire sauce and once the soup was cooked, I blended it together and made it nice and smooth. I put the soup back in the pot and added 1/4 cup of cream. Served with grilled cheese and it's the perfect winter meal!

This was good, but just as others have said, it definitely needs to be run through the blender. After it was complete, I still didn't think that it had enough tomato flavor so I added another can of crushed tomatoes at the end.

It was simply gorgeous! I made it yesterday as a light dinner and it tasted great! Follofing pkvermont suggestion, I omitted the Worcester sauce, and blended the whole thing. I never cooked a homemade tomato soup before, so this was a good start! The trace of celery on the soup made it much better.

Awesome soup! I don't remember the last time I was going back and forth between kitchen and living room until the soup was finished. It is just excellent. I used less onion though, no celery, added some chili sauce and meat balls.

This was not very good... it tastes like thin tomato sauce. I had to add an extra carrot and two potatoes just to cut the acidity, but it still didn't work. I pureed it so that the carrots and potatoes wouldn't be chunky. I refuse to waste food, so I am eating it anyway, but only with a large dallop of sour cream and deep hunger pangs that make me so desperate for food that I'd eat anything.

I would have given this five stars, but my husband didn't like it with the carrots. I had to use beef broth because that's all I had. I did add chili peppers and meatballs just to make it a complete meal for us. It was a terrific rainy day supper.

This soup was excellent and easy!  I modified it by melting down some feta cheese and mixing it in!  It made it a little bit creamier and added a hint of that yummy feta taste!  I really like that this is a thick, hearty soup.  Great with a crusty role or cheese bread.

This is very easy to make and it is delicious. I tweaked the seasonings a little by adding onion and garlic powder. I puréed the soup in my Vitamix, then added some heavy whipping cream ( tips from other reviews). Served with cheddar cheese and beer bread. We love it!!

This is good, however, I made several changes.  Like mentioned in another review, I pureed the soup after cooking and then added half and half (1 pint) then  I added parmeggiano  cheese on the soup when served.  I also sprinkled with dried basil.

I look for basic recipes that can be modified to make my own "homemade ________" and I was looking for a good starting point for a tomato soup as I have never made it before. It's not something I care for from the can, so I just don't have it often.

Last night I made this recipe and I gotta say this is a perfect starting point! The hint of spice and the leftover hints of the worcheshire are good suggestions for ways to add a lil unique flavor to your own homemade version this will inevitably snowball into.

I do recommend the suggestion of pureeing the soup after cooking it. The carrots I used was shredded carrots and that, along with what is still left over from your other ingredients, will puree well and make your soup almost creamy. Finally, I used chicken stock instead of vegetable stock and used 4 cups adding additional time to it simmering to help boil off the additional half cup. 

I will most definitely make this again and I will update this review with suggested changes in the recipe

Yummy!   Followed the recipe except left out the celery (didn’t have any), put everything in my Pampered Chef Quick Cooker for 30 minutes, used hand blender to puree at the end then stirred in a little heavy cream.  Delicious!

Was really good! Used 7-8 fresh tomatoes, chicken broth (no salt) and no worshire or hot sauce. I personally like the freshness taste, but some might think it too bland.

Unlike others, I chose not to puré as I chopped up the vegetables very fine in the beginning and enjoyed having that little bit of texture (seemed right considering it was homemade and I like a heartiness feel to my soups) I omitted the added salt as I used canned soup that contained salt and found that sufficient.  I also decided to add some sugar (unmeasured - approx. 1/4 cup) at the end to cut down on the taste of acidic canned tomato's.  My husband had an extra bowl, my teenage daughter who does not like tomato soup, enjoyed this with paninis I served alongside.  I personally loved this and will make again.

Everybody loved this recipe.  Made exactly as stated and did not puree it.  I chopped the onion, celery and carrots very small. 
 Next time I will cut the salt and pepper in half since it will allow each to add the amount they want.

Very good! But I made some modifications. I wasn’t a fan of thyme so I added basil, and cream and I used an immersion blender for a creamier soup.  I may use a food processor next time. My family loved it!

Made exactly as the recipe describes except for the Worcestershire sauce. I used organic crushed tomatoes.  Instead of 20 minute simmer, I let it simmer for about an hour. I blended the soup in batches until smooth and and creamy. Make sure to not overfill the blender or you will have a tomatoey mess all over the kitchen (pulse before letting it blend). I think the servings stated is incorrect. My batch was about 8-10 servings. Loved it. Will make it again. Check out my picture.

This was not good at all.  It's the first recipe I have tried that no one liked...I can usually get at least one person to like a new recipe, but all 4 of us were spitting this soup out.  I followed the directions exactly.

This was exactly what I was looking for to use us the massive quantity of tomatoes I impulse bought from the market! Super healthy (I tripled the carrots and celery) but still hearty. The heat was an awesome touch. I used and immersion blender and then strained (I had a lot of skins from using whole tomatoes.) I served with grilled cheese on whole grain bread and my daughter and husband both loved it. Will definitely make this a go-to recipe!

This is a great recipe for a quick and easy tomato soup! But for veggies, I added green beans, corn, peas, and a little chopped red pepper. I also added a little sugar, pieces of fried bacon, mini noodles, and some parmesan cheese. I recommend this if you really want to step up flavour! It was delicious! :-p

I made it per the recipe and it was way too acidic. I probably added 2 tablespoons of sugar, doubled the salt, 1/4 teaspoon oregano, 1/8 teaspoon of cumin, 2 tbsp sour cream and some penzies turkish seasoning. It turned out ok with that but without it tasted like tomato sauce...and that's it

Omitted the the hot sauce, as the kids don't like spicy food.  It was still way too spicy with all that pepper. I recommend halving the black pepper and then adding cayenne pepper once you have tasted it.

I have made this recipe multiple times. I love that it is easy and simple and very tasty - and I frequently have all ingredients on hand so it's a staple too. I don't use Worcestershire sauce in anything else so I don't use it for this either; instead I will sub in a little balsamic vinegar.

The thyme was a little over powering. I added some soy milk and blended mine. I'm glad I did, even after blending it was a bit chunkier than I prefer.

Made this on a rainy Sunday afternoon when I didn't have any ready to go. Swapped vegetable oil for butter, omitted carrots as I didn't have any, used the immersion blender, and finished with a 1/2 cup of heavy cream. My two 7 year olds ate it all (with goldfish crackers on top), husband and my mom went back for seconds. Will make this again.

I made this recipe for a graduation feast for a club I took part in during high school. I ended up making about 10 gallons of soup and my guests and their families said it was among the best soups they ever had. One of my friends parents even mentioned how they had something similar in Paris but this recipe topped it. Tastes great, would recommend.

Not much flavor in this recipe.I made this as written and then when i tasted it -it was bland..i then added 1/2 tea.garlic powder,1/2 teas.basil,1 TBL's parsley,1 TBL's sugar & the next time i will saute the onions in butter and not use the olive oil. this will add even more flavor. After  i added these changes to the soup the recipe was a keeper & i have added it to my recipe book.

This was pretty yummy. I used coconut oil to saute the veggies (a staple in our house). Also as others mentioned I put the soup in the blender, since I have a Vitamix, I put it in on the "hot soup" option and didn't bother with the simmering as long. It made enough that I'll freeze a good bit of it. I would probably cut in half when making it again.

This was a very easy soup to make so very delicious!  I used fresh tomatoes and went by the recipe. However, I also puréed everything after cooking, then put back in stove and added some heavy cream to smooth it more and little thicker. Made this for my sick father-in-law and he loved, loved it.

Great basic recipe! I used fresh tomatoes and tomato paste instead of canned crushed tomates and as other reviewers mentioned I puréed everything after simmering then brought to a simmer again. Served with some homemade croutons. Delicious! Will definitely make again.

Super good. I added some stewed tomatoes and hit it with the stick blender to get a nice semi-chunky texture. Delish!

Awesome soup. Had to make it without the pepper & worcester sauce (used chili flakes instead) and it still turned out so delicious. It even changed my Mom's mind about tomato soup! Before i made it, i asked her if she liked tomato soups: a clear "No, i really don't". Challenge accepted, made the soup, and once she saw and smelled the finished product, she couldn't resist and in fact now loves tomato soup. Thanks for this recipe :)

I gave this a 4 because something was off...some suggested you puree it. That would have helped since my tomatoes and onions were still chunky. Others added some cream. That may have done the trick. I also didn't have carrots or celery so I didn't use them and needed to add about 2 table spoons of sugar because it was so acidic. Even with all this said, I think this was super easy and had a great flavor. I'll definitely make it again!! Very healthy and tasty.

We liked this a lot - I used beef broth instead of veggie broth and regular Worcestershire instead of vegetarian. I used my hand blender at the end to make a wonderfully, smooth soup. My son loved dipping his grilled cheese sandwich into it.

Followed exactly but skipped the worcestershire sauce as I don't like that flavor.  It was quite good!!  Used my stick blender at the end to puree but it still has a nice, thick texture.

Amazing. Definitely needed to blend at the end. Added some adobo seasoning which is a staple in my house. But everyone wanted more they liked it as a dip for tostitoes black bean chips which was a side. I made it with a grilled cheese turkey burger sandwich. It was a perfect balance of flavors.  Hubby got excited when he heard I wanted more.

Made exactly as instructed except added a can of seasoned tomatoes with chilies (it's all I had). Added a lot of heat, so skipped the hot sauce.  Blended after it simmered. Delicious!

This was alright but a bit tangy. I did use my immersion blender to smooth it out some. The leftovers were much better the next day.

Excellent tomato soup.  I followed the recipe, using Tabasco sauce and loved the result.  Not too spicy for me but I can see where people who don't like spicy food would leave the hot pepper sauce out.  The tomato with the Worcestershire sauce has enough kick to it.  Will make this again.

This soup was great and I usually hate tomato soup. My husband would have preferred the carrots and celery to be cooked a little longer. Plus, this recipe makes way more than six servings in my opinion. Overall, it was awesome.

Delish!! but had to make some changes, I sauteed celery carrots onion and garlic first. Deglazed with 1/4 cup red wine. Then pureed in blender. I added pureed mix to dutch oven with 2 cans crushed tomato, broth, 1 tsp. not TBSP worcestershire, hot sauce, salt and pepper, 1 tsp basil, 1 bay leaf, 1/4 cup cream. AMAZING!! Thanks for the great recipe!!

I didn't have any vegetable stock so I used water and added a teaspoon of vegemite.  I also pureed it, then served it with a dollop of sour cream.  YUM!

It was thick and not tasty at all. I didn't puree it maybe that was the problem...worst tomato soup I ever tasted. Sorry!
