Had to try this recipe especially after I tried this dish in Taipei recently.
Didn’t use basil on my preparations.  Also butterfly’d Three huge skinless chicken breasts and pounded to 1/4 inch.  Used all other ingredients and followed the balance of the instructions.
Turned out great... will use more cayenne pepper and salt next time... but very good recipe

It's a must to sprinkle them with a salt based seasoning after you double fry them. I love the flavor of Thai basil but once fried it turned bitter.
