I have made this recipe twice- first I made it exactly as listed and then on the second try I made it with some modifications and loved it. Here is what I did and I think it made it a 5 star-
4 cups milk
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 brown sugar
1/2 cup long grain rice
1 tablespoon butter
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1/2 tsp cinnamon
raisins
Directions-
1. Stir 4 cups milk, white sugar, brown sugar and rice together in slow cooker till you dissolve sugar. Add extracts and raisins, cinnamon and butter. 
2. Cook on High for 2 hours and 15 minutes.
3. Beat egg and Temper the egg by stirring a small amount of the hot rice mixture into the egg mixture to gently warm the egg without cooking it; stir the egg mixture into the rice in the slow cooker.
4. Cook on high 15 more minutes.
5.Transfer pudding to glass baking dish then cover with plastic wrap, leaving two corners to vent, for at least 1 hour.

I made this the other day, and it was perfect! But, instead of white rice, I used brown because that's what I had on hand. And I used equal parts coconut milk abd regular. I also recommend adding a cinnamon stick when you put the milk, rice, and sugar together, and let it cook with the cinnamon

Super easy - turned out much better than the old oven method.  I doubled the recipe but instead of doubling the sugar - I changed the 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup (instead of a whole cup for double batch).  It was still plenty sweet.

I have always had trouble making rice pudding...don't know why...but I simply adore it. Was in the mood today for some, found this recipe and this will be my go to recipe. It is wonderful!!  Simple to make and very tasty. Very creamy which is something I could never achieve with other recipes. I added a couple of handful of raisins before it was done...simply out of this world!  Thanks for sharing! Almost forgot, I added some half and half in the milk mixture....

First of all, I really liked the flavor of the pudding with the almond extract. I'm going to have to try that again with rice pudding. Secondly, the consistency of the "pudding" was nice and creamy. Mine got a little eggy, but that was my fault for not mixing it in slowly enough. The problem, was I let my pudding cook for almost 4 hours on high, and the rice was still crunchy. I didn't have time to let it cook anymore and it was starting to burn on the sides. So, I had to eat crunchy rice pudding, which I really don't ever want to do again. I don't notice with other recipes that my crock pot cooks at a lower temp. I saw that one other reviewer had to cook for 5 hours, and I'm sure another hour would have made a difference.

Just finished making this and although it is still hot, it is very yummy. It's not too sweet (which I like) so if you're looking for a sweet dish I would add extra sugar. I didn't have almond extract so I added more vanilla extract to make up for it. Topped it off with powdered cinnamon.

My slow cooker must run pretty high, because after an hour almost all the milk was cooked out. Luckily, I was keeping an eye on it. I turned it to "keep warm" & added about 1/2 a cup of half & half and stirred. I liked the consistency so I went ahead & added a little almond extract & about 1 tablespoon of  light brown sugar. I have to say, it was pretty tasty! I had added some raisins at the beginning & they were nice & plump after an hour. I did not add anything else to it. I would make again. EASY & TASTY!

Easy and excellent recipe! Hubby loved it, and it was so easy to make. Followed the recipe as stated, only added a cinnamon stick to the milk at the beginning. Did I mention easy? Was a bit runnier than we are used to, so just took the lid off and let the moisture evaporate. It smells lovely as it is cooking, then the pudding set up real nice after in fridge for a few hours. Easy.

I thought this recipe was really great.  Instead of regular long grain rice I used a short grain rice - choose something suitable for sushi or risotto.  I also added 1 whole clove, some cinnamon stick and 1/2 whole vanilla bean, split and scraped out the paste.  I found this had to cook for almost 5 hours (maybe because I used a short grain rice?) before the pudding came to the consistency I wanted before adding the egg.  ok, I added 2 eggs (i have lots of eggs).  but it is a great recipe, especially to launch off with your own flair.  I run a dayhome so I often put "puddings" on in the morning with the kids so it's ready for afternoon snack time and they loved this one.

I don't normally write reviews but on this occasion I thought that I ought to, I search endlessly for a decent rice pudding recipe  to be cooked in my crockpot slow cooker and finally I found theeee best recipe ever!! Thank you.
I read most of the reviews before hand in order to avoid making mistakes but to be honest there is nothing to it, it's dead easy. I followed the instructions as it is but the only thing I did was doubling the amount because I thought the original quantities not enough for a big family! So 1 cup of rice and 8 cups of milk and kept the same measurements to the rest of the ingredients!!! Haven't said that it took 5 hours to cook and I must say that after 2 1/2 hours I opened the lid to check because nothing was happening and milk still the same so I gave it a stir and added another additional hour!!! After the hour has finished I checked again and still too watery, gave it another stir and added another hour! Then I started see results!!!  when the hour was over I followed step 4 and added another 1/2 an hour and when I scooped it out it came out to a tee!!. Will definitely definitely recommend and make it again

Amazing. could do with a little less sugar. very soft and delicious. I made with almond milk, jasmine rice, and butter. Much easier than the stove top method and much better results.

Pink Elephant, I made this recipe in one of the original 3-4 qt. crock pots - the kind that does not have the removable crock. Some crock pots, especially those with the removable crocks, cook much faster. I know mine does. I almost always try to use my original one if possible. If not, just keep an eye on it while cooking and make adjustments if needed.  Enjoy!

My roots are British so rice pudding was a staple dessert when I was growing up. When I served this at a family dinner, my sisters were so impressed. This was just like our Mum's.  Just the right amount of sweetness and super stodgy (thick).  I served it the same way my mother did by adding about a cup of raisins near the end of cooking  and passing a jug of evaporated milk around to pour over it like a sauce. Comfort food heaven!  Thanks for this easy recipe and trip down memory lane.

This was great.  I was worried there was not enough rice as it was very liquidy, but after sitting in the fridge for a few hours, it set perfectly.  Raisins next time.

I'm not a big fan of rice pudding, so made this for my hubby I had a taste of it and now I am a rice pudding fan! I used butter instead of margarine as that's all I had, I was a bit worried at first as it looked very runny but turned out in the end,, I added raisins and sprinkled hot chocolate powder over the top,, amazing

Ok...so I made it...and I def. give the recipe 5 stars...but I give myself 2 stars lol.  I read a lot of different recipes and a lot of reviews on all the diff. recipes and I think I just let too much go to my head. I think it came out a bit too chunky because I felt like it sounded like just way too little rice vs amount of liquid. so I added 1/4cup more rice.  I also used 2 fewer cups of milk and added a 14oz can of sweetened condensed milk.  So it ended up being more...caramely. Not what I was in the mood for!  It's not the worst..but I wish I would have just followed the directions and I bet it would have been awesome!  Next time I won't doubt the recipe! Shame on me. lol.

This is outstanding! For years I tried to make my mom’s rice pudding better. I should have started by NOT using cooked rice. We are enjoying this with fresh berries, and I’ll make my own batch with fresh peaches next time. Found a new standard go-to dessert. Thanks Susan!

Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it was way too sweet for me. My husband loves rice pudding and he devoured it, but you can cut the sugar and extract flavorings in half and it's perfect. I ended up transferring to stovetop because even after 3.5 hours on high in my slow cooker, the rice wasn't cooked. (But that was my issue , no fault of recipe)

I added 2 fresh vanilla beans and 1t Ceylon cinnamon when cooking. Only other thing I’d change is omit almond flavor, just double the vanilla flavoring. Only added a pinch of salt and 1 1/2 the recipe using Fairlife 2% milk. More protein ?? cooked about 30 mins longer. Was runny until it set in fridge. I would cook it a little less as it was a tad too firm after setting.. It is awesome and easy!  Also stir midway through so it doesn’t stick to bottom.

I didn't know how much it would make so I made a double batch and it made a lot. I used 1% milk and plain white rice as that is what we had in my house, I cooked it for 3 1/2 hours and it came out perfectly creamy. I found it had the best flavor and consistency the first day, by day 3 the rice was not holding up well and the flavoring was off.

Loved it!  Super easy and it turned out really well.  I had all the ingredients on hand too.   Doesn't work well if you double the ingredients though.

It tastes great, but it is not thickened properly. I made this recipe 2 times. The first time I screwed up the timing and didn't cook it long enough. The next morning I dumped the mixture into an enamel coated cast iron pot and cooked it on top of the stove on low until the rice was done and it was thick. I also added another beaten egg at when I put it in the pot. It turned out great after recooking and adding the extra egg. 

The second time, I was very careful with the timing. This time it was creamy and the bits of rice I tried were done. It's been in the refrigerator for 2 hours. It's totally cooled and still runny, though not as much as the first batch was. Some of the rice isn't done this time either. This is thin enough to drink and I may just blend it smooth in the blender and drink it.

I think my slow cooker is weak because I left it on extra long and the rice was still fairly firm. Looks like I'll have to buy a new one and retry this. Although it turned out really soupy, it tastes fantastic!

Growing up, my grandmother's rice pudding was always a treat--thick, sweet, cinnamon-y... It was something my father and I looked forward to. So, when I stumbled on this recipe, I figured "hey, this looks like an easy way to start making rice pudding." I'd never made a batch of my own, and grandma left a, well, let's call it "cryptic" breakdown of her process. Consequently, I made this recipe to try to rekindle some of my childhood and bring a bit of joy to my father's face.

The flavor on my final product was good, though I'd skip the almond extract next time out. That said, I have a couple issues with this particular recipe. A half cup of rice to four cups of milk? I did use whole milk, but the pudding turned out like rice-filled sweet soup. Again, good flavor, but incorrect consistency. I posit that more rice/starch is necessary to thicken the mixture.

Also, my rice didn't quite cook all the way. It wasn't awful, but it was far from perfect. A longer cook time (coupled with more rice) would probably make this work better--but I AM an outlier with this rating. It seems that most people have had great success with this recipe, so I may have just had a bit of bad luck.

The conclusion? I'm not turned off of this recipe. It has potential, and maybe I just missed a beat. I may make it again to see if I get the same result, but I'm definitely looking for a quality stove top recipe that more closely resembles my grandma's.

This was very good and easy in the crock pot.  I followed the recipe except I used coconut oil instead of butter and I doubled the rice because it was very watery when it was almost done.  I made it a second time with almond milk and I left it in the crock pot for an extra half hour and it was too mushy.

Will definitely make again.  The only reason it is not 5-stars is the almond extract.  While I normally love almond extract, I thought it was an odd note here.  I did add cinnamon and nutmeg to the beaten egg, before it went into the rice.  My daughter was so impatient, she had to eat the pudding warm (as they do at her school) and she really enjoyed it.

Flavor is amazing but next time I'll use half the sugar on the recipe because it was just too sweet for me , also 2.5 hours wasn't long enough for the rice to cook I had to do 4 hours on high for the rice to cook but super easy recipe and great flavor , also I really like the flavor added from the almond extract ! Yum

Oh rice pudding recipe, where have you been all my life? This is delicious and easy. Just the right amount of sweetness. I love the addition of a tiny hint of almond extract. I made it just as it was written with basmati rice and whole milk. Perfection! Thank you ever so much!

I just spooned some fresh out of the crock & I'd say it turned out well. My notes:

ingredients list says 2 T milk twice, first ingredient should be 4 c

I used brown rice and 1/2 c Splenda, then added a few Tbsp brown sugar near the end

I'll add cinnamon sticks at the beginning next time 

It seemed to be taking forever to start thickening so I added a few Tbsp of Chia seeds. Perfect :)

I clearly need more practice tempering eggs, as there are cooked bits in here. Not terrible, though.

Will definitely make again with a few adjustments.

I Made minor adjustments -added golden raisins and used 2 cups of canned coconut milk and 2 cups of 2% milk.  This pudding is simply addicting!  I added golden raisins in the mix for the last hour of cooking. I would reduce the sugar to my liking in the future as the raisins add their own sweetness. I made it again and used a can of coconut milk and a can of evaporated milk.  I did not add the egg mixture or the butter.  Really creamy and delicious.

This was easy and delicious. I substituted one can of condensed milk ( not sweetened) for some of the milk. I didn't have almond extract so I added some rum extract and added some raisins in the last few mins. I I used brown rice but you can't tell. Yummy.

Made this for the second time today. Used 1/2 White sugar and 1/2 Splenda. Didn't have enough brown sugar so squirted in some sugarless maple syrup. 1 cup raisins and chopped walnuts. Really delicious. Will make this often. Thanks for the recipe! Diane

This is a fantastic recipe and makes a really good rice pudding.  I used coconut milk instead of regular milk and butter instead of margarine (yuck).  I also added a cup of grated coconut.  It was so delicious!!  I will be making this again and again!

anyone with under cooked pudding is just the variations in temps of the pot. When cooking puddings I use my 9x 13 crock pot casserole dish. I double the recipe and put the eggs in right away mixing all the ingredients except the rice with an immersion blender to make sure sugar is dissolved and eggs incorporated , If I add raisins I do it last half hour so they don't get too plump

Cooking time took a couple hours longer than listed. I didn't really like the egg in it. It tasted more like a custard than a rice pudding. It was good but not what I was hoping for.

This is the first time I ever made rice pudding. I have been looking for a simple recipe, and this one is it.  Made two, separate, batches and they both turned out great. The recipe is simple enough that you can add your own flavouring, without, changing the end result of the recipe. I added one cup of raisins and a half a teaspoon of cinnamon, for the first batch, the second batch I added the same thing but one and a half of Rose Water, and it still turned out great.

Very very good. I was surprised at how creamy it was. Seems foolproof too.  Next time Im going to double the recipe, since using just 1/2 cup of rice doesn't yield much pudding.

5 stars for ease and taste!



I have to admit that this is better than my mother's ( baked in the oven )recipe. I did, however, add about a 1/2 cup cranberries.

It was way too much milk. The finished product was really soupy. I'll cut off at least a cup of milk if I do this recipe again. Also, the vanilla and almond flavors together was too much. It tasted like medicine. I'll still do the vanilla next time but substitute cinnamon for the almond flavoring.

Easy and delicious! I have tried to make rice pudding in the past and it was an epic disaster.  This recipe is simple and the result fabulous! I am health conscious and use 1% reduced fat milk and cut the sugar by 1/3. I  originally made this on Thanksgiving  and have my fourth batch in my slow cooker right now. I love that I can tweek this recipe to include lower fat and non gmo/organic ingredients to meet my dietary needs.

Added raisins, nutmeg, and a touch of milk when it was done cooking otherwise would have been too dry.  Came out great.  Going to make it again.

Loved it. I will be making it again. I put a little caramel sauce in bottom of my 1 cup containers, put the pudding on top. Just stir them up before eating, so good.  I just grab one out of the fridge and have my evening snack.

I did make it with butter instead of margarine. Also didn't add almond extract. I did add a small cinnamon stick while doing the cooking process.  Next time I  will add less sugar, thought it was a little too sweet. Very easy recipe and will make it again with some tweeking.

This is a fool proof recipe. I use whole milk.  And butter. I prefer it that way.
Leave the egg and two tablespoons of milk out while the pudding is cooking. Then you're  not adding cold egg to pudding. I do temper the egg and milk  with the warm pudding. It has never "scrambled."  I have also doubled this recipe because the grandchildren devour it.
No need to stir pudding over the hot stove for 20 minutes. 
Absolutely delicious.

This was my first time ever making rice pudding.  I was very impressed with how creamy and flavor-able the pudding was.  It was also super easy using the slow cooker.

This is an awesome recipe for rice pudding!  I used Amaretto Liquor  and omitted the vanilla! Depending on the slow cooker,  check frequently while cooking to make sure it doesn't scorch. This one is a winner!!

I should have taken it out of the crock pot sooner, the consistency was perfect when I took it off and it got too thick as it cooled.  I’m going to try again and only stir the egg in until it’s not quite as thick.

I really enjoyed this recipe! It was super simple and came out tasting just how I like my rice pudding. The recipe didn't state weather to use already cooked rice or uncooked. Some comments mentioned using left over rice which makes me think some have tried it with cooked rice but I opted to use uncooked and I think the rice was cooked perfectly this way. I'm sure it will be great either way just a little more or less mushy. The only change I made was that I used vanilla paste instead!

I freaking love this! Instead of using normal milk I used 2 cups heavy whipping cream and 2 cups 2%milk. Made it extremely creamy! I didnt have almond stuff or even good vanilla extract (was making it at work and I can't use the good vanilla with alcohol.). But it worked beautifully with imitation vanilla. Thanks for the recipe.

I like the flavor but had some issues with the consistency.  In the recipe ingredients it calls for 2 Tablespoons of milk but in the instructions it says combine 4 cups of milk with the rice in the slow cooker... So 4 cups of milk per 1/2 cup of rice? It is VERY soupy after almost 4 hours on high. Do you still put the egg and refrigerate? cook more?

I am not sure where I went wrong with this. I followed the recipe to the letter and it just didn't work. I cooked it for the length of time stated and it actually took 2 hours longer. At the 2 and a half hour mark it was still liquid. I let it go for 2 more hours and it finally seemed to firm up. It was quite mushy. I don't know if it was my crock pot or not because I use my crocks a lot. I gave it a three rating but like I said, I am not sure where the error was. All in all the taste was good but not a good texture. I have made a similar recipe with better results. I may give this another whirl and use a different crock altogether.

Great recipe.  The only change I made was to add a little cinnamon when I transferred to baking dish to cool.  Super creamy and tasty.

My family loved this rice pudding!  I have switched up flavorings using coconut extract in place of vanilla and sweetened coconut in place of raisins.  What a hit!

Absolutely delicious. I like my rice pudding a little on the sweater side so I added 1/4 cup of extra sugar and 1/4 of brown sugar. Also added a pinch of nutmeg.

I made this using only the ingredients listed. Because my slow cooker usually curdles the milk, I scaled it first, beat the egg, tempered it, then added it to the rest of the ingredients in the slow cooker. I cooked on low; it was done in about 90 minutes or so. It was very creamy when I removed it from the slow cooker, but I knew it would thicken as it cooled. It sure did! Next time I shall add a bit more milk after the cooking is done, to hopefully, promote a creamier rice pudding. It was delicious! I liked it best served warm. Unfortunately my husband did not like it, so next time I shall do it without the egg. And, maybe add raisins, he will not like that, but I will! We finished it off in about three days, it did not make as much as I expected. Will definitely make again.

I just tried this recipe today, and I doubled the ingredients. Smelled great cooking and was very simple. Only had to stir it a few times to prevent it sticking and burning to the bottom. It's in the fridg now cooling but the spoon I licked tasted great can't wait to eat some later tonight.

This was such a simple and delicious rice pudding recipe. It was a little too sweet for my taste, but others I served it to felt it was just right. I used brown instead of white rice because I had some on hand, and it worked perfectly. The instructions suggest cooling it for an hour, but I snuck a taste before putting it into the refrigerator, and it was delicious warm. I think I would have preferred eating it warm, but I didn't time it correctly in order to serve it warm. Next time....

Very good but very soupy.  Had to add heat and add an egg with a small bit of cooked rice to get the consistency right.

Because I made changes, I am giving the original recipe 4 stars. With my changes, and following suggestions of other reviewers, it was a 5 star dish. Changes I made: 1 can of low fat coconut milk for one cup of milk. I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Added almond and vanilla extract. 1/8 tsp. Cardamom. I have a removable crock pot by black and decker. I used Uncle Ben's "cooks in 10 min" basmati rice. My consistency was fine with the set timelines. Other than tempering the egg, I just threw everything in all at once in the beginning, coming back to stir at intervals.

Delicious!!  My family loves rice pudding so I doubled the recipe.  I made just a couple of alterations and used coconut milk instead of regular milk and coconut extract instead of almond extract, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Quick and easy to put together.  Will be making again!

Finally found the right recipe for a creamy delicious rice pudding!  Thank you so much for sharing.   I followed the recipe as directed except that I added the extracts directly into the milk and rice at the beginning of cooking it.  I also omitted the salt.  I used jasmine rice.  The end result was superb!

This is a great recipe.  I made it using medium grain rice, which meant that it was more mushy than if I had used long grain rice, but still delicious!  I did not have almond extract so I used a little more vanilla.  Some reviewers suggested adding a cinnamon stick at the beginning.  I did so, but will not do it again, as it made the pudding brown and the cinnamon flavor was too pronounced for me, although everyone else loved it. I added about 1/2 cup raisins at the beginning also. I also used butter, not margarine, and whole milk. I had to cook this for an extra hour before it became the right consistency. I'll be using this recipe again and again.  Very easy. A winner.  Just keep cooking it until it gets right.

Very tasty. I made a double batch. I used 1/2 skim milk and 1/2 heavy cream.That is what I had on hand.  I went by the cooking time that was listed as a start then kept watching for the liquid to absorb. My husband loved it. Thanks so much for the recipe.
