It came out on the almost too moist side and I even extended baking time by 5min. I may try this recipe again but cooking at 375F instead. I tasted the sweet potato/bacon/onion mix before I mixed it all together and it was yummy, but the muffin didn't have the sweet potato flavour at all. I thought it was ok (although I wasn't sure what to expect) but my wife really liked it... it reminds her of a ham/cheese biscuit.

I think i overmashed the sweet potato which made it on the overly moist side, I'd recommend cooking the sweet potato just a bit under, so the mash is chunky instead of really mushy.

This is a completely savoury muffin, no sweetness at all once cooked, so if that's what you're aiming for, this is great, or if you want a hint of sweetness, recommend adding a tad bit of sugar.

Made them as is and LOVED them! Husband and 2 year old approved with a demand to save the recipe and to not change a thing. For me, I think I might use half the curry just because the curry flavor was really prominent. Thanks for the recipe!

Great savory muffin. There was enough of the recipe that I actually extended the baking time considerably. Next time I'll lower the temp a bit for a more consistent overall muffin. The top finished more than the body. May also attempt my favorite thing lately which is making a loaf form and using it for French toast. Mmmmmmm.

Even though the sweet potato flavor wasn't prominent I enjoyed this savory muffin. The onion, cheese,bacon and curry powder  all came through. I thought I had an issue due to making the recipe with gluten free flour but alike another reviewer I had to cook for additional time because the muffins were really moist inside. I would make this again with a few small tweaks.

I really wanted to like this recipe, but the flavors ended up muddled. No one would guess this was sweet potatoes.  Most of the folks from work who tried this thought a little sugar might help boost the flavors
