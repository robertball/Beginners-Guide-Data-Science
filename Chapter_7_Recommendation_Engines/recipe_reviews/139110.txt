I made this in a skillet, sauteeing all of the veggies and fresh garlic.  I did not use the vinegar or mustard.  I added the fresh basil at the end and sprinkled the parmesan on top before serving.  Let it melt first!  My husband came back for seconds!

I tried this recipe as written and liked it; however, I have always made it by simply layering the vegetables and adding grated pepper jack cheese just before it is finished baking.  Salt & pepper are all that is needed as the tomatoes make enough juice as it cooks.  We love it with the pepper jack.

I thought this was an excellent combination of flavors, but I did modify it somewhat so that I could prepare it as a skillet veggie side instead of using the oven to bake it.  I have created a "custom" recipe for my preparation method...

The topping was wonderful according to my 6 year old son, he ate most of the topping of the whole thing.  However there was too much liquid in it for me. But it wasn't too bad.

I liked this dish but it is a bit on the vinegary side. I might try it out with a very small amount of balsalmic vinegar next time.

I drizzled veggies with olive oil and layered; made a gluten-free thickened cran-cherry juice sauce from the drippings of six seared chicken breast and baked with pepper jack cheese and garden herbs tucked under the chichen for about 40 minutes. It was delish. Kids loved it and that makes me smile. I did use the produce from my garden. Healthy and Happy. Cheap. Thanks for the recipe!

Added thinly sliced red skin potatoes, Zucchini, tomatoes, onions omitted vinegar, basil,and mustard, sprinkled with oregano drizzle with olive oil and oregano. Added light layer of shredded Mozzarella then Parmesan. I would rename this to a Gratin -Potato, Zucchini, tomato, and onion.  Additional ingredients could include garlic and rosemary.

I made this recipe, as written, last week and it was an instant hit. There was a tiny bit left for someone’s lunch the next day. This week we are vacationing at the beach and I made it again with a few additions. I generally don’t like when people change recipes but I needed  to feed a few extra people...so in went yellow squash, carrot curls  and asparagus. I also cooked off some chicken tenders and added them. I made triple the sauce and also made a pound of pasta ...again, only a little bit left for next day lunch.

Zucchini Tomato Onion Casserole Haiku: "This dish bummed me out. Too much red wine vinegar, otherwise 5 stars!" I was not happy w/ this dish, such lovely summer veggies from my garden getting the vinegar and cheese treatment when I probably would've been very happy w/ just the garlic salt, basil and butter. My husband absolutely LOVED this side dish, but I just wasn't feeling it, and I did make it exactly as written.

I doubled everything except the cheese.  I think I'd add less vinegar next time and more tomatoes although it was fairly juicy as it was.

I had to do a bit of modifying based on the things in my fridge but found this fast, easy and delicious.  I didn't do it in a skillet but really like that idea, then pop it under a broiler.  I thought there was a lot of liquid but I served it with Quinoa and the juice was delicious with the grain.
