10.26.16   Interesting combination of ingredients for cornbread.  I made half a recipe, and it was done in 20 minutes.  The savory herbal flavor is what you taste first with the pumpkin lingering in the background.  It was moist with good texture, and I could totally see adding some sausage, chopped apples, and broth (don’t think you’d need much else) for a delicious Holiday cornbread stuffing side dish.  The house smelled wonderful when this was baking; really made me start thinking about Thanksgiving coming up next month.,
