I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did not have sake so I substituted with  a few (3)  TBSPs  of mirin.  I also did not use cream.  I did not find it needed any added salt.  The salmon was melt in the mouth delicious.   Thank you Everettrj

Absolutely scrumptious--arguably better than the recipe it copycats. I wanted to make my wife a dish that would make her enjoy salmon for the first time, and this floored her. Meanwhile, the sake butter sauce was what really blew me away, super zesty and rich and packing a lot more flavor than I'm used to getting from a restaurant. It does take a lot of steady whisking, but if you can manage it it's worth the effort.

It came out AMAZING, we had separate pre-made sticky rice so I just threw the snow peas in 3 min after the ginger when I made the sake butter sauce and took them out before I put the cubed butter in. It's the first time my snow peas turned out right! This recipe will have you licking your plate!

Made to the T except used wild rice as I can't eat white.  This was a lot of work, but really amazing. My hubby really enjoyed it as well.  I will probably save it for special occasion or weekend dinner.
