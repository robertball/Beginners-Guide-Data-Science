We loved these potatoes! Beautiful rich color from the caramelized onions and deeply flavored. Definitely worth the extra effort and time it took to caramelize the onions.  Just enough horseradish and Dijon to make these interestingly different, although I wouldn't hesitate to add more horseradish.  I found I didn't need the extra butter at the end - the butter used to caramelize the onions was enough.  It was nice to find a different and delicious spin on mashed potatoes.

Fantastic recipe!  I added a couple of cloves of fresh roasted garlic, but add garlic to almost everything.  I also added in a couple of dashes of white pepper!

This side dish was great - my family (kids, too!) liked it...a nice flavor with a little tang, but not too much for those who don't like spice.  It didn't take too long to make and didn't have any unusual ingredients, that is nice when you have a family and house to keep up while preparing meals.  It made a huge heap and we served it with pork tenderloin and steamed broccoli - it was perfect.  I'd recommend it - a nice twist on mashed potatoes...

This recipe is fantastic! The only change I made was to substitute the white wine vinegar to half white cooking wine, half cider vinegar, because I didn't have white wine vinegar on hand. For the small amt. required, I doubt it would have made much difference. But the flavor! I had 3 helpings, my boyfriend loved it as well. I know I'll be making this again & again. Thanks for the recipe! ADD-ON So, I made this again, and it was even better this time. I boiled the potatoes with minced garlic, used skim milk instead of half & half, and this time I sauteed chopped cabbage (about 2-3 cups) in bacon grease 'til tender, and added along with the onions. It was very simaler to Irish colcannon and tasted great with the corned beef I prepared. Everyone who loves horseradish and potatoes should try this dish!

I thought this was really delicious.  When I went to make it I found I had only 1 rather elderly potato.  So I made instant mashed and added the seasonings. It was great and my guest had no idea I hadn't made it from scratch!

Yummy side dish!  I did have to add more 1/2 & 1/2 to make it creamy enough and also a bunch more horseradish, because we like spicy!  :)

Wonderful, wonderful wonderful potatoes. Made these for a dinner party to serve under Beef Burgundy. Simple, easy, tasty, full flavored. I did use Yukon Gold potatoes instead of russets, because that's what I had on hand this time around. Will most definitely make these again. It goes great with beef.

Very nice twist on regular mashed potatoes. I omitted the horseradish (I forgot it), and all 5 of us loved it. Would suggest that the onions are cut up more than just 'sliced into rings' because it was somewhat difficult to eat with long rings. Very good flavor.

I LOVE the zing that horseradish adds to mashed potatoes!  My onions always take longer to caramelize (an hour or more, usually), and I don't generally bother with the vinegar, thyme, or mustard.  Sometimes I'll even omit the onions -- that's how much I love the kick of the horseradish!  Butter and milk/cream to taste to finish.  This is an excellent, tweakable recipe.

Simply amazing. I would recommend chopping the onions a little smaller otherwise they are too stringy in the mashed potatoes.

Great change to regular mashed potatoes! I followed the recipe except I didn't use the thyme(don't like it) or the vinegar (didn't have it). I do try to follow the directions exactly the first time but they were wonderful this way.  Will definitely make them again!

These were a nice change from my regular garlic mashed potatoes. I still prefer the garlic but will make these occasionally.  They're excellent fried up the next day & smothered with cheddar cheese!

Wow!  This was fantastic.  None of the flavors are overwhelming and they blend well.  I added some minced garlic (1-2 tsp) to the onions in the last 5-10min of cooking.  Otherwise I followed as written.  Very flavorful.  Will make again for sure!

This was so decadent. The kids didn't like them but my husband and I fought over the leftovers. Only change I made was adding a couple cloves of minced garlic.

wonderful! Would suggest cutting up the onions into bite size bits before adding to the potatoes, as they were quite stringy and LONG in with each bite of what was, essentially, mashed potatoes.

These were nice potatoes, and an inspiration for a change in my own menu.  I used to enjoy eating Hot German Potato Salad (the kind with bacon and vinegar), but these days, I'm skipping bacon quite a bit, and smoked turkey didn't sound right, so I thought I'd be skipping anything even remotely like that more common dish.  Well, when I added the vinegar and thyme to the caramelized onions, and then looked at the mustard sitting on my counter, I began to think that this might turn into a great substitute.  I don't quite have it all down right yet, but I'm getting close.  With extra vinegar, a little less mashing, and an added dose of mustard, some garlic added to the onions just before adding the vinegar, and possibly a good bit more horseradish (depending on who will be at table on a given evening), this should be a close second, if not a better replacement.  I already enjoy this recipe, though I used soy milk instead of the cream, and oil instead of the butter, which sounded questionable to me.  Given time, I think this will be one of my very favorite ways to make mashed potatoes!  Thanks for the inspiration!

This is one of my new favorite recipes!  Only change was to add more butter, I probably will add a bit more cream next time we make it.  Also I agree with the other reviewers that you should chop the onions rather than leave them in rings; that's what we did and it was nice and easy to eat.

What a great potato to have on the side of BBQ ribs or prime rib! Thanks for the recipe!**Had to update and change to 5 stars. I make this every time I have bratwurst or ribs. Instead of half and half I use sour cream. I also like to use plenty minced garlic:)

I halved the recipe for my husband and served with roased chicken.  I made this because my husband loves horseradish and he loved this recipe, but I'm not a big fan of horseradish and it was only okay for me.  I needed some minced garlic for my tastebuds to go WOW!  Will definitely, make again, though, for hubby and guests.  Thanks for sharing!

Gave mashed potatoes the wow factor.  Lots of flavor.  Didn't have white wine vinegar so used red wine vinegar and it still turned out great.  Husband had a second heaping helping.  Caramelizing the onions took longer than planned; next time I'll do those ahead of time.

These were very good.  I cried the whole time (sooo many onions :), but I thought it was worth it.  This makes a huge batch, so if it's just 2-4 of you then I would scale it back because we had a lot leftover.  The horseradish gives it a very unique (in a good way) flavor and overally I really liked this kind of mashed potato.  These were also very easy to make!

I used red skin potatoes and nearly double the horseradish. The flavor was still quite subtle but very good. We will definitely make these again. I left the onion rings whole and would do so again but without the largest ones. It's a little weird to pull out a forkful of potatoes and have a long string of onion pull out of the "mash" and dangle to your plate.

Pretty good.  I made these for Easter lunch and they went over well.  We thought they were actually a little better the next day.

These mashed potatoes were really good. Definitely worth the time and effort to make them! This had just the right amount of spice to make this more interesting than ordinary mashed potatoes. Before I made this I was afraid that the mustard and the horseradish would be too much for my six year old and two year old to eat, but they ate it right up. I made this along side baked chicken and steamed broccoli, but these potatoes would be versatile enough to go with almost anything. Can't wait to make these again! Thank you for the recipe, brightlightz.

I loved this recipe but did not have cream so I used full fat sour creme and I also substituted balsamic vinegar for white and used fresh thyme.
It was a hit with my family and will make it again. Beats boring mashed potatoes!

OFF.THE.HOOK. Loved 'em! Hesitant about so much horseradish so I didn't use as much, that was a mistake. Used a small can of evaporated milk in place of the cream. The only thing that would make them better is to have seconds. I did. Thanks for the recipe!

These are definitely worth the calories!  They were creamy and delicious.  I served them with pork chops and then with a Dijon-shallot chicken cutlet.  Fantastic!

This was ok.. I did find that the vinegar was a bit overpowering so I would definitely cut back on that. I chopped the onions and used fat free 1/2 and 1/2. Would try again with some changes to our taste.

My husband loves horseradish, so he was thrilled with this.  No one else in the family cares for it, so it was only a hit with the Hubby.  None the less, this is a great recipe - I loved the caramelized onions in the potatoes.

I was concerned about the horseradish being to strong so I cut the amount in half, which turned out was a mistake on my part.

My husband liked it but he told me next time to use more as he could barely tell it was there.

So the second time I made it, I used the amount the recipe called for and he loved it more.

As for the onions, the first time I did cut them into rings but the second time I cut the rings in half.  I like it better with the rings cut in half.  My husband thought it didn't matter since it tasted same. 

This is more a special occasion mashed potato since it does take extra time to caramelize the onions.

I've been wanting to try these for sometime now, so when my husband came home with one of the biggest yellow onions I've ever seen I knew this was the time to try it. I knew we all would love them since we love all the ingredients. I did use milk and sour cream, since I didn't have any half and half, but they were still wonderful.

A few ingredients can really change plain old mashed potatoes into something very different and delicious! I used half of the onions, and it was plenty. I would always add something like horseradish and mustard gradually, because it could be too much for your own tastes. This went well with the Easter ham dinner. Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe! I made it for Easter dinner and it was a big hit! We do like things spicy, so tonight when I make them again I will probably double the horseradish and Dijon mustard. Thank you for making me look so good!

This was very tasty, but required more milk, because I didn't have the half 'n half and added more butter to make up for the fat content.  It took quite a bit of liquid, before they were smooth and fluffy.  Unfortunately, I didn't measure, just kept adding, because with the amount the recipe called for, it was dry and lumpy.  Maybe my potatoes were too large to start with, but what is a large baking potato?  If the recipe had stated 6 pounds of baking potatoes, then it would have been more helpful.

Just tried this recipe, absolutely delicious.  Instead of the butter and half and half I substituted Krafts Garlic and Herb cooking cream.  Next time I think I will add a bit more horseradish and maybe some garlic.  I used this as a side dish with slow cooker beef stew.

Great! I added 3 tsps of sugar to onions for better caramelizing. I also think that it helped to balance acidity from vinegar. I used balsamic vinegar instead of white wine, 1 tbsp of dijon and 1 tbsp of sweet mustard from the seeds. Thank you!!!

I loved these mashed potato's, I have no regrets  made as directed, except, I chopped the onions smaller to carmelize, so no stringy situation, as some have reported, you got it right with the horseradish and above all, the best, will make these with beef at least 2 times a week, will be a regular rotation in our meals, thanx for sharing.

These are really good. A little heavy on the horseradish which is why I gave it 4 stars, but love the addition of the caramelized onions! That is genius! Thanks!!

I've been using this site for nearly every recipe that I've made for years and I've never left a review, but this was awesome! I made a few changes due to what I had on hand. The only local-grown produce at the farmers' market right now are sweet potatoes and turnips. I've never cooked, or even tried, turnips so I grabbed a couple. I found recipes that boiled them with potatoes and mashed them together, but when it came time to prepare the meal, I was looking for that recipe and this one definitely caught my eye! I love onions with everything! I don't like horseradish or dijon mustard, so I left those out. I don't have white wine vinegar, so i halved some cooking sherry with rice vinegar. I also love sour cream with my mashed potatoes, so I halved that with 2% milk in place of the half & half. I didn't add any butter at the end because I had only sauteed one onion (adding a couple cloves of garlic near the end) with the 3T of butter, so there was plenty when I mixed everything together! The potato to turnip ratio that I used was 2:1, so it was a smaller batch than what this recipe makes. I will definitely make this again, but with more onions next time! Thanks so much for sharing this :)

Seriously delicious. I used apple cider vinegar in place of white wine vinegar, parsley in place of thyme, and sour cream in place of half and half. That's what I had on hand, but in the future, I'll probably make it according to the recipe just to see the difference. I agree with other reviews that the onions could be cut a little smaller. They were a little stringy, but oh so good.

I didn't love these flavors. I was really confused too, to the onion in the recipe. Is it 4 slices of onions or 4 onions? I assumed it was slices, however mine were fully cooked in like 6-7 minutes so now I don't know. I followed the recipe exactly except I made 1/2 recipe and used milk instead of cream. They taste just like they state as caramelized onion and horseradish. I thought I would really like the combination, but thought the flavor was just okay. It was a bit strong.

I really enjoyed these potatoes, but my family didn’t enjoy them as much as I did.  I loved the addition of the golden onions and horseradish; I thought it added a lot of flavor to the mashed potatoes.  I served these with ‘Slow Cooker Roast Beef’ from AR, and it made for a very nice meal.

made these for christmas dinner and it was very good! used yukon gold potatoes and turned out fine. i was concerned with horseradish overpowering the taste, so i only put in 1 tbs, but will increase next time. very well received at dinner

Absolutely loved this recipe!  I made exactly as written, the flavors are outstanding.  I served this with filet of beef, perfect combination.  A familiar side, but the bold, hearty flavors make this a nice updated companion to beef.  A keeper and a definite do-over.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR.

I liked it very much, but I made the mistake of preparing it beforehand and then heating it up in the evening and I found I didn't like it at all,  Far too sweet.  I will try it again, because I did like it when I was making it.

Awesome!  Served with the Garlic Prime Rib, managed to burn my onions, so those were omitted, but even without them it was great!

I think i could have had more horseradish, and garlic.  It is hard to mix the potatoes and horseradish together without your eyes water!
