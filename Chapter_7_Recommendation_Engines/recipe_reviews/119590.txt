This is the absolute BEST pumpkin roll EVER! I have been using this recipe for years, and everyone goes crazy for it. It is so simple to make and so moist and delicious. Sometimes I put the nuts and sometimes I don't, but it doesn't matter because it's fantastic either way! This also freezes VERY well. Give this recipe a try, you will not be disappointed! :)

I made this recipe for my work thanksgiving party. It was a big hit; and it was gone well before the party was over. I was a bit intimidated by the process of putting the cake together as I had never made a cake roll before. However, it was much easier than it sounded. I made it the night before, and it was wonderful. There are a lot of steps but it was well worth the effort. 

Update (November 2009)

I have made this several times since, and the only issue I've had is the cake sometimes cracks while rolling. I've started making extra cream cheese icing and just frosting the top; and even if you make a *huge* crack, nobody can tell.

I have been using this recipes for many years, and I am always asked for the recipe. The easiest way to turn out your roll is to first line your pan with wax or parchment paper, 2nd spray your paper with baking Pam ( the one with flour & oil mixed) cook till cake springs back , turn out onto linen towel covered with confectioner sugar, prior to rolling the cake sprinkle confectioner sugar on top of the cake and than roll, it will unroll with no problem.

Pumpkin roll turned out great! My cake did crack but I'm sure with a little practice I'll perfect it. The only thing I did differently was use pumpking pie spice and cinnamon then added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract into the batter.

This is one of my very favorite desserts.  I could eat the whole thing.  It's much better than plain pumpkin pie.

Delicious.  Make sure to flour the towel ALOT.  My roll stuck to the towel and some pieces tore off, which i reattached with the icing.

I used to have trouble with my cake cracking until I tried this trick.  I wrap an empty cardboard tube from paper towels with wax paper.  I place it at the end of the short side of the cake where I will begin rolling.  I then roll the cake around the cardboard tube.  It supports the cake so that it doesn't crack.

After following to a "t", my cake crack, crack, cracked w/every roll I made. I WILL conquer thsis& then it'll get a 5 star rating. The cake is great, the instructions easy to follow. I just can't get it to roll without breaking. I ended up making a trifle w/it, using a pumpkin mousse recipe from Taste of Home. Fabulous!!

This did not turn out well at all. The cake ended up very dense and chewy.

I loved this recipe...follwed it exactly. Yum! I only gave it 4 stars JUST because I think 1 cup of walnuts is waaaay too much unless you just want to eat walnuts. I only used 1/3 of a cup and I thought, "Oh, this will be good." It wasn't until  I rolled it up that I realized now all the walnuts are clustered together in the roll! There are just too many walnuts in every bite. Definitely love the recipe though!

I didn't have wax paper, so I used parchment paper and greased it with butter.  Still worked great.  Used lots of icing sugar on the dish towel.  My nieces and nephews loved it!
