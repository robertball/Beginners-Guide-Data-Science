I made this cake once, and ever since my husband's family demands it at every autumn gathering.  The only thing I changed is that I think it needs a lot more rum.  Before adding the whipped cream filling, I brush the interior side of the cake with rum (enough to soak through a little but not so much to make the whole cake soggy).  I also add more rum to the filling.  As other reviewers have mentioned, I too had a hard time finding toffee (without chocolate) so I used Werther's Originals.  

As a tip, if you are baking and you recipe calls for just a little bit of alcohol (such as this one), you can usually go to a well stocked liquer or party store and buy the mini airplane bottles for $1-$3.  It is so much more reasonable than buying a $40 of alcohol that you won't use for a couple of tablespoons!

Bravo. Delicious and Magnifique!!  Never would have known it was this easy if I hadn't found it here!! Gotta try this!! I did find the gelatin mixed with the rum part was a bit tricky, and I boshed that a bit, so I added whip cream from a container and an extra tablespoon of the rum to cover my mistake...no problems, it worked great! I'm making this again at Christmas for a party and I am going to omit the gelatin part altogether and save the hassle, since no one even noticed anyway and everyone loved it last time. It's a keeper!!! Thanks!
I thought it would take time to make this recipe by the way, I had to send my hubby out for a missing ingredient too and was cutting it close to when it should be done, so when I finally was able to begin, I was amazed at how fast I was able to put this together. Looks like a lot of work, soooo easy though!! forgot to brush the cake with rum too like someone suggested, I think that will be great! I will have to write it into the recipe so I won't forget. the cake part...must use cake flour...it's so flexable. Otherwise it will definately break when rolling. Yummo!

This is a really awesome recipe.  I love it.  Two comments, though.  One, it seems like you ought to roll it from the short end, not the long end (but I used the long end, anyway, for more servings).  And I just threw all 10 tbsp of toffee into the whipped cream and was done with it.  Who'd know?

This was the best pumpkin roll that I've prepared. I made it for Thanksgiving last year, and it was a hit. You can bet it will be on the dessert table again this year.

This was a huge hit at Christmas.  It was actually my first attempt at a pumpkin roll, so I was worried on how it would turn out.  I used (greased)wax paper on the jelly roll pan before I baked it.  This seemed to help get the roll off the pan much faster onto the towel.  As for the taste, I personally thought it was a little too decadent.  Next time I might cut back on the toffee pieces.  But, that being said, everyone else loved it!  It was an instant hit and people were begging to take some home with them!

Very difficult to make.  But if you're a good baker, maybe it's easy for you.

I seem to be the only one disappointed in this recipe! I have been trying to find a Pumpkin Roll recipe that rivals one I tasted years ago in the Bahamas. It was made by a local resident and was out of this world! The cake portion was very dark in color, and that is why I chose this recipe because it looked dark compared to other recipes I've made. Well, mind didn't come out dark at all. It was much lighter in color and I didn't like the texture of it at all. I thought it was very bland also. I've made other pumpking rolls with a cream cheese filling which I prefer over this toffee cream filling. I just was not impressed with this at all.

I made one for home and four for work and all five were devoured. It's rather sweet, and the rolling is a bit tricky, but the result was delicious and it will surely be made again. Used Captain Morgan's for the rum.

I finally found it!!!! I have been looking for a Pumpkin Roll recipe that would rival the one that I got from a very upscale restaurant. I moved and misplaced the recipe - I was just sick about it. Then I discovered this recipe and decided to give it a try. I'm so glad that I did!! It is incredible!! Just like the one that I used to make!! This is an absolute family favorite - something that I must make several times in the fall. I had no problems whatsoever making this pumpkin roll. I did use a couple of other review suggestions, but other than that I followed the recipe to the letter. Excellent!!!

My first pumpkin roll to make and recipe was easy to follow.  Took it to my book club and received rave reviews and requests for recipe. It was light and not too sweet.  I thought it was heavenly.  The best pumpkin roll I've ever tasted.

Fabulous!! My 13yr old daughter made this for her first dessert this Thanksgiving. She had a blast making it, and everyone loved it. The only change we had was that we couldnt find butter toffee. So we ground up the Werthers butter toffee flavor candies instead. Tasted great. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe...

I love this cake!  It's a family favorite.  Easy to make, yet VERY impressive!  The most recent time I made it, we were making caramel ice cream to complement an apple, pie so I decided to substitute the ice cream rather than use the caramel sauce.  It was a terrific substitute.  The first time I made this, I was intimidated by the whole rolling part, but it's not an issue at all.  Just remove the cake from the pan almost immediately upong removing from the oven.  It slips right out of the pan.

This recipe was okay for me..I think the cake tasted funny, like it was grainy or like it wasn't fluffy enough.(hard to describe!)It also took me a while, and mine cracked in the middle, and became quite soggy..Expensive to make,too, when you add in all the ingredients, like rum.. I will definitely give it another try, though, with some modifications I'm sure it will be wonderful!

I made this Pumpkin Roll and another from this website side by side trying to decide which to bring to Thanksgiving this year, this one won hands down. It was so delicious and the filling is light and fluffy, not too sweet. I think next time I'll add pumpkin spice to the mix, possibly to the filling just to give it a little extra and I think I'll make about 1/3 more filling. I would just say to be sure to get the caramel they say in the recipe, I could not find it anywhere so I just bought caramel candies and melted them down, such a pain, hardened so fast I couldn't even drizzle before it cooled. I love the toffee as a change of texture in the dish. Also I only waiting 20mins with the cake wrapped in the damp dish towel (That's the length of time on the other recipe) and it was still pretty warm when I unrolled it, didn't crack anywhere! I didn't force it, just unrolled it enough to get the filling in there and quickly but carefully rolled it back up before it cooled. So delicious and it looks fantastic!!!

EXCELLENT.  I made this for Thanksgiving and it got gobbled up so fast there wasn't even a slice to take home!  Very sad!  I think this is probably the best-tasting cake I have ever made.

i could not get this dessert to roll like the recipe says. it ending up breaking and i had to serve it flat. after topping it, it looked like a pan of mush. the taste is not lacking but without being able to roll it up, the dessert was a complete failure
