Good basic recipe, although you really want to start off frying the paste first with the oil for a couple minutes and then add the creamy part of the coconut milk.  Let the two mix better.  I also didn't add peanut butter, because I think that's cheating kind of and another user complained about the thickness of the curry (I like mine soupy, too).  I would just use peanuts, throwing them in with the potatoes or at the end, and maybe peanut oil to fry it all up with.

This was FABULOUS!!  I always order this dish at my favorite Thai restaurant -- I made this for dinner tonight and it was just as good, if not better!  I used lite coconut milk and I added some carrots, basil and unsalted cashews.  I didn't have tamarind paste, but here's a good substitute:  I processed equal parts dried apricots, prunes, raisins and lemon juice.  IT WAS TO DIE FOR!!!  I served it over brown rice and both my husband and I loved it.  THANKS!!!

I couldn't find massaman curry paste anywhere, so I had to use red curry paste. I also used sweet potato instead of white and added onions and carrots as per another reviewer's suggestion. The texture of the sauce was perfect, but I found it almost needed to be a little sweeter. I might add a little more brown sugar next time. Overall, we liked it quite a bit and plan to make it again.

I love the Massaman Curry from the Thai restaurants in this region, and I had high hopes for this recipe. Unfortunately, this dish did not meet my expectations.   While I approached the called-for addition of 1/3 c. peanut butter with some skepticism, I added it anyway. I should have stuck with my instinct - Massaman Curry isn't supposed be this thick!  This tastes like Peanut Butter Stew! The flavor is decent, but it's NOT at all what I expected.  I recommend starting with half the peanut butter that's called-for and evaluating the consistency after 5 to 10 minutes. The dish will thicken a bit as it cools, so take that into consideration, too.  On a personal note, I prefer a "soupier" massaman curry, so in addition to reducing the peanut butter I would also reduce the amount of potatoes to 2 cups from 3c. I would also add 1/2 cup of minced onions for dimensional interest.  I will probably use water to thin out the leftovers from last night.

***This was much better after adding water to thin to my liking. When I added water, I also added more lime juice to balance the taste.

White chicken, white potatoes, white coconut milk, white rice... too many white foods.  Flavor was good, but the dish was bland in color and texture.  I'll make this recipe again, but next time, I'll include colorful veggies and crunchy textures.

This was good!  And fairly quick to make.  I followed the recipe very closely.  I could not find tamarind paste, but a quick check online says that Worcestershire sauce is a substitute.  I accidentally bought chicken breasts that were pre-flattened for scaloppine, which turned out to be a blessing in disguise.  They cooked up a lot better than regular chicken breasts and did not dry out.  I also added a can of peas because that is what our local Thai restaurant puts in their Massaman.  Once everything was cooked, I added the peas in and let it sit for a few minutes so they could heat up.  Oh!  And I added some pepper flakes because we like it spicy.  My only complaint is that there was too much potato.  I will only use 1 potato next time.  Thanks!

We recently moved from NYC to NC and I was really missing this great Thai dish. I made this recipe for my husband last week and it was awesome!! The only thing I substituted was equal parts Worcestershire sauce for the Tamarind paste. I also added onions, sw potatoes and a few strips of bell pepper. It was fantastic, can't wait to make it again!

Too much PB! I put 2 cans of coco milk to stabilize it. It's not as good as the restaurant but in a fix and to save money...why not?

Outstanding!  Just as good as what you'd find in a restaurant.  I used sweet potatoes instead of white ones and added chunks of bell pepper to add some color.  Also, swapped Worcestershire sauce for the tamarind paste as my grocery store didn't carry it.  One of my new favorite recipes!

Excellent recipe: here are some changes I made due to lack of ingredients & what I read in reviews.  Used Mae Ploy Panang curry mix b/c could not find Mae Ploy Massaman curry mix.  Substituted 3 tbsp of minced prunes + lime juice for tamarind paste.  Used 3 tbsp of peanut butter.  Added 1/2 c. water to thin out sauce at start of step 2 before adding 1.5 c. cubed potatoes, 1 sliced green pepper, 1 sliced med onion & 3/4 c. frozen green peas.  Tasty!!

My husband LOVES Thai and Indian food and almost always orders Chicken Massaman Curry. We live in a small community with limited ethnic food options so I have been trying to recreate our favorites at home. I followed the recipe and just made minor adjustments as noted by others (less peanut butter, tamarind paste substitution, red pepper flakes, chopped onions and carrots, 1/2 can water and a handful of peanuts). It was AWESOME. My whole family loved it, especially my husband who ate the leftovers for lunch TWICE!! This is a huge compliment as I can rarely entice him to leftovers for lunch. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

this was absolutely amazing!  i cut the fish sauce and the lime in half, but that is just personal preference.  i also added a sliced up onion (big slices) on step two which adds a little something and whole salted peanuts on top as a garnish.  all in all an incredible recipe. delicious!

Great basic recipe!   Although we tried using much less peanut butter (2 spoons) and replaced the rest with chopped peanuts (about half a cup).  We also had a much larger chicken so we needed more liquids. We used chicken stock and water along with the coconut milk.  The decision to make the recipe was spontaneous and we were stuck without tamarind paste and palm tree sugar. We used mashed dates paste and more lime juice and it came out fantastic.

This was so delicious! I made this about a month ago and my whole family enjoyed it so much! I didn't have tamarind paste but I used a few table spoons of soy sauce. Honestly it was delicious with that! I would recommend using the peanut butter with chucks as it gives a more delicious texture. All in all...I am making this again tonight. Just scrumptious!

I made this as-is and was very disappointed. Tasted like melted peanut butter with some potatoes thrown in.

I made this and subbed tofu for chicken, and skipped the fish sauce (I'm a vegetarian). I also felt that tamarind paste sounded like it would be too much so I reduced it to 1 TBSP. The recipe was sooooo sour! Extremely sour, and left a sour after-taste in my mouth. I attempted to salvage it with extra brown sugar and additional salt. It helped, and the curry is edible, but not that great. Definitely not a traditional Massaman Curry :(

Me and my boyfriend loved this! Our local store did not have tamarind paste and was out of fish sauce so I followed others recommendations and used soy sauce and worcestershire. We also used half white potatoes and half yams. I added in a package of asian stir fry veggies at the end and served it over jasmine rice. The sauce had great flavor and the chicken was tender. Although I'm glad that we mixed up the potatoes and veggies to give the texture more variety. We will make this again!

Pros:  The taste is unequivocally amazing and is nearly identical to our favorite neighborhood Thai restaurant.  The texture is smooth and silky.  Easy to prepare and will only take you 30 minutes if you keep the potatoes finely diced.  The cost is very reasonable if you keep key ingredients on hand in your cupboard.  Cons:  I prepared this nearly as written, save for the tamarind.  Next time I'll purchase it and add it to see how I like it as written.  Also, I added four cloves of garlic as I sautéed the ginger and I had no brown sugar so I used white.  I think this would work better with noodles rather than with rice, and that is how our local restaurant prepares it.

This is the second time I've tried making Massaman Curry (the first was with a different recipe), and this was TEN TIMES better. I did cut down a lot on the peanut butter (putting only about a tablespoon in) since I like my massaman runny too, and I cut down the lime to 1 tablespoon but I still think it overpowers the dish -- this may be because I was using lime from a bottle, not fresh. I think next time I'll use just a bit of fresh lime. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! Thanks1

Unlike most of the previous reviews, I was terribly disappointed by this recipe. I followed the directions but omitted the fish sauce and I thought it was terrible. My husband commented that it was, "too sweet." My curry looked much darker than the file photo. :(

I love this recipe! I skip the potatoes and tamarind paste, but add cashews, avacado and rice. It always takes longer than the 35 minute cook time (I like to thicken the sauce), but it's worth the wait.

This is a very good basic recipe.  I used red curry paste.  I also used the substitute of worcestershire and added carrots.  The recipe make a significant amout of sauce, make sure you do use a large sauce pan.  If you are looking for a spicy recipe you may want to add additional red pepper.  Although at first taste the fish oil does not stand out, it does linger a bit in the after taste.   Overall this is an excellent recipe.

Perfectly mild curry - I love super hot stuff, but my wife doesn't like spice at all - and we both love this. Throw in some red bell peppers for some more color.

I did not care for this recipe.  I just think the flavor of tamarind was way too strong.  The unfortunate thing about recipes is that pastes and sauces can vary widely in terms of concentration.  So this recipe calls for 3 tablespoons of tamarind paste.  I used one tablespoon and the flavor completely overwhelmed the rest of the dish.  Maybe my paste was more concentrated than other pastes.  I will not be making this recipe again.

This was fabulous! I didn't have the fish sauce or tamarind paste, but it still turned out great! I added a bit of chopped onion which was nice.  My husband is a very picky eater and rarely tries new things, and even he enjoyed it! Thanks! Will definately make it again!

I live in Thailand and this is one of my favorite curries! Warm and cinnamon-y! This recipe is very plain, and several things will make it phenomenal-- first use Massaman ( or masman, their English isn't always spelled the same) curry-- normal curry lacks the cinnamon flavor. Essential. This is "Muslim curry" in Thai- so it is supposed to have a regional taste. Second, my Thai friends all make this with broth also-- to match the meat. (Additional to coconut milk.) Third, add carrots ( big Thai veggie!) and onion if you want the street food version. Last, they often add pineapple to this recipe too!! Yum! Love this dish, but needs some upgrades to be quality food that tastes like is made here. Basic recipe as is.

FANTASTIC! I created an account just to praise this recipe!! I made it exactly as indicated, and it tasted exactly the same (and had the same consistency) as our favorite Thai place. It is well worth your while to hunt down the correct ingredients. Use MASSAMAN curry paste - it's out there!

This recipe is fabulous! I omit the potatoes (and onions that other reviewers suggest) and add cashews and chunks of avocado...which is the way my husband ate it at a restaurant...and is absolutely amazing! I know avocado seems off...I was skeptical too...but seriously, it is delicious!

This was really, really good!  I added some carrots, just to have a little more veggie in it, but honestly it didn't do anything for the flavor, so I don't know that I'd do that again.  Our favorite Thai restaurant makes this minus the potato and serves the sauce over slices of chicken and avocado with cashews sprinkled on top - next time I will try to do it that way - the flavor of the sauce is so incredible!

I had high hopes for this recipe, but was pretty disappointed.  It was OK, but I wouldn't make it again. Is there a specific curry paste for Massaman curry?  I couldn't find one, so I used red curry paste.

This was a great recipe, I used what I had available which meant that I substituted fish sauce with two jumbo scallops, no tamarind paste, and I added cashews and avacodo slices- b/c that's how they serve it at my favorite thai place.  Excellent!! and I added salt to taste.

The fish sauce is much too overpowering!  Could 3 Tbsp really be the correct measurement?  I ended up having to run out to get another can of coconut milk and doubling other ingredients (besides fish sauce and tamarind paste) to tone it down.  It still wasn't great, but it was edible.  Pretty disappointed as I love Masaman curry, but I will try it again and significantly decrease the fish sauce.  I added strips of vidalia onion and used 2 white potatoes and 1 sweet potato.  Very glad I did that as it helped with the flavor.  Also decreased the PB to 1/4c and added 1/4-1/3c roasted peanuts. I forgot to add the lime juice so I can't comment as to whether that measurement seems off as well according to other reviewers.

My husband surprised me by making this last night as Massaman curry is my fave Thai dish. He used Maesri red curry paste in a can from Thailand( I tried to make a similar dish using Indian curry paste and the flavor is alot different from the Asian curry, was disappointed).       He added onion and carrot, but next time we will add more onion, maybe vidalia for its sweetness. We will probably par boil the potatoes as they took a long time to cook and i had to keep adding water to thin out the consistency.  Also added an extra tbsp of brown sugar. It still needs a little tweaking but was so good I ate it again this am for breakfast!!!

This has an excellent flavor and is just like our favorite Thai restaurant.  I didn't have fresh ginger and used powdered.  I'm sure fresh would have been better.  I used Mae Ploy brand massaman curry paste, which was great.  I also didn't have any tamarind paste, so I just left it out and I forgot to add the lime juice, even though I had the limes.  I served it over brown rice because I like the texture better.  Even with these changes, I loved this dish and will make it again without hesitation.  I'll make it by the book next time.

Ok for a base recipe, but I'm trying to find Massaman like my favorite restaurants and this isn't quite there. Unfortunately, I don't know enough about Thai food to get there.

This recipe was awesome! Massaman curry is my husband's favorite meal, and I decided to try to make it at home. I also used Worcestershire instead of tamarind paste, as the other reviews said. I would recommend less peanut butter though. Next time, I will probably only use 1/4 cup. Still great recipe though!

I followed some suggestions in other reviews (this always helps me out) and thought it made the recipe outstanding.   I substituted worchestershire for tamarind and cut the peanut butter in half, also added large chunks of onion and bell pepper.  Great recipe!

Tasted just like the restaurant we normally order it from. My man loved it as well. I added onions and used tamarind chutney because it was easier to find than tamarind paste. I also reduced the amount of peanut butter and potatoes as other users have mentioned as well. Was yummy.

This was excellent.  Not sure if all red curry pastes are salty but ours was.  Other than the salt issue, was excellent.  Like some others, minced onions was added w/ the minced ginger.  Def. a keeper.

We really enjoy Thai food and I have been looking for massaman curry recipe for a long time. I could not find massaman curry paste so just used hot curry paste I had. Could not find tamarind paste in the stores here. I actually did not know what it was. I found several suggestions for substitutions . I went with one that called for equal amounts of chopped dried apricots, raisins, lemon juice and prunes but I did not have any. Cover with boiling water and let sit until fruit softened. I then blended it with my hand blender. It made a nice chutney like blend. It was flavourful and smelled great when cooking. I used sweet potatoes,green onions ,carrots and a bit of red pepper. We both enjoyed it and will make again. Probably used a little bit less peanut butter.

This was WONDERFUL! I swapped the white potatoes for sweet and added half an onion and a red bell pepper. This is how I have eaten this at my favorite Thai place. I also wanted to have more of the "soup" so I added another can of coconut milk. Wonderful recipe and I think the spices and everything were just perfect.  definitely will make again.

I adapted this to be vegetarian by taking out the fish sauce and adding in some carrots with the potatoes. The sauce is very good! I did leave some of the peanut butter out as others have recommended, and it still turned out somewhat thick. This is so easy to fix with some water that I barely think it is worth mentioning it. We had it with basmati rice and it was awesome.

This was really good. I used red curry paste and also added some garlic. I cut the amount of peanut butter down about half. I did not have fish sauce or tamarind, so I used 2 Tbs of Worcestershire sauce instead. I also added carrots, bell pepper, and chopped peanuts to mine. I will make this again, after purchasing the missing ingredients. Great recipe!

Excellent recipe. I added large squares of sweet onion, cashews, and avocado slices.  Chunky peanut butter adds texture. Instead of adding more sugar, the onion and avocado sweetened the curry just enough.

I made this with a vegan fish sauce alternative and left out the tamarind (didn't have any)and it still came out excellent. We used quinoa instead of rice, mixed veggies instead of potatoes (because why follow the rules when there's no one making you) and it turned out so good. Experiment!

Tried this recipe last week. It turned out great, and was as good as I've had in Thai restaurants. I live in very rural Maine, so having Thai means at least a 2 hour road trip one way, so I've been trying my hand at various recipes. Even the 3 finicky teens loved it.

I love this recipe although I altered it quite a bit over time.  I normally double the recipe, substitute the fish sauce with worchestershire sauce, and make my own tamarind paste (puree dried apricots, prunes, and dried dates with enough lemon juice to make a thick paste- I end up putting about a cup of this in there).  I also use sweet potato instead of white and put some onions slices in it after the potatos have gotten less firm, maybe when there's about 15 minutes left.  Also I add yellow curry (about 2 tablespoons) at this point as well.  i also add a little more peanut butter than it calls for and usually have to add a half can extra coconut milk.  Love it!

I followed the directions and used the stated ingredients but the dish didn't turn out with a golden color.  Instead it was dark brown almost black and all anyone could taste was the tamarind.  It was still good but not like Massaman dishes I have ever had.

Absolutely delicious!! I cook thai and indian recipes all the time and this is by far one of my favorites! I added about half a cup of diced onions to the oil/curry paste mixture as well as a tablespoon of curry POWDER because I love both flavors. Tamarind and fish sauce are integral to the flavor of this dish so don't try to substitute. I didn't have lime juice so used lemon but it gave it just enough acidity and bite!! Top with cilantro, green onions and cashews - TO DIE FOR!!

YUM!This is a great curry recipe. My grocery store didn't have the tamarind paste, but it tasted great without it.

My husband and I eat Thai food on a regular basis--from restaurants as well as from our own kitchen. Massaman curry is one of our absolute favorite dishes, but this recipe failed to live up to our expectations. Three Tbs of lime is definitely way too much, but the biggest problem is with the consistency of the sauce. The Massaman we're used to has more of a soup-like consistency, whereas this recipe caused it to be much, much thicker. It was almost the consistency of something like ketchup! Overall, I was pretty disappointed.

Absolutely DELICIOUS! I made it for dinner with friends and they all just LOVED it! I would definately make this one again. The only thing I added was whole Basel leaves on top, but next time I'll chop them in advance. Thanks for this wonderful dish.

Made this without the peanut butter, used raw cashews added mixed Asian stir fry that i had on hand , and ditched the potatoe. Cubed up a couple of firm Avacados instead and tossed them in just as I was taking the wok off the heat. Spiced it up with some chili garlic paste. Delish! 5 stars for the way mine turned out

This was very tasty - but too strong on several of the flavors - and I cut the coconut milk in half, used only 2 tsp tamarind paste, used curry powder instead of paste (since I didn't have),  and 2 tbsp fish sauce.  The sauce was very good - but so very glad I only put a bit of brown sugar because it was too sweet.  So I added siracha sauce.  I didn't add potatoes, which may have absorbed some of the flavors.  And I agree - add onions.

We loved it! I followed the recipe except for substituting palm sugar for the brown sugar and I added a can of coconut milk. Also used Massaman curry paste.  I'll probably add onion next time. But the flavor is perfect.

There is a Thai place near us where we've had this many times. This recipe tastes exactly like the restaurant version. It's great, and the first time I made it, we liked it so much, I made it the next night too.

Excellent. My fish sauce had expired so I substituted soy sauce.  Did not hurt it at all - still delicious
I also sauted the spices first.

I have made this countless times over the last few years and everyone loves it! It is good over rice or just alone in a bowl. For the most part, I follow the directions exactly but I do sub a couple of ingredients. When I began making this, I had trouble finding tamarind paste. So I consulted my Malaysian friend about how best to substitute this. She  suggested raisins and a bit of water. I use my immersion blender to make a paste. Also, instead of using white potatoes, I cut up sweet potatoes. It complements this dish well. We will continue to make this over and over. Everyone loves it!

Rachael Auwae here and I have made this quite a few times as this is one of my favorite curries ever.  I do adjust it slightly as I add some carrots and broccoli.  I nix the tamarind paste (hard to find and a bit spendy). I also use the "lite" style coconut milk.  It seems to be a flexible recipe as you can add and subtract the things that you'd like to use.

I made it per the directions and could not escape the overpowering tartness of the tamarind paste.  I even tried to salvage the dish by doubling the coconut milk, peanut butter, and brown sugar to tone down the tart, but ended up having to sacrifice the entire thing to the garbage disposal.  What a waste!

For some reason, I found this pretty salty. We made changes to it, adding lemongrass, ginger and garlic. We also added more veggies: broccoli, red pepper, 2 tomatoes and 2 hot peppers. We also added fewer potatoes and  it cooked down a little in order to cook all those vegetables, so that could have been it. Still, great flavour. Did not add the peanut butter as my husband doesn't like that flavour so much. I would like to try it though.

When I worked in NYC I went to a nearby Thai restaurant and ordered this for lunch all the time.   This tastes pretty close to what I remember.  If you're using natural unsweetened peanut butter then 1/3 cup should ok but if you're using regular peanut butter with added sugar then scale back to 1/4 cup or even 3 TBSP.    I can never find tamarind paste so I've been substituting  Worcestershire sauce as others have suggested.   This is one of my favorite dishes and it's super easy to make.

I make this several times a year, and my husband loves it! I don’t have tamarind paste or curry paste - I just about 1/2 c of trader joe’s Red curry sauce. And I also add extra peanut butter!! And serve with cilantro.

Love making this. I've done it a little differently every time. The last time I made it, I added the mostly-cooked rice right into the pot with the rest of it. I usually freeze a bunch of it for later and it's just as good.

I had a hard time finding some of the ingredients so i substituted a great deal.  I had no curry paste and no tamarind paste. 
3 T yellow curry powder
1 t smoked paprika
1 t chili paste
2 T ginger paste
2 T fish sauce
1/2 C peanut butter (i like extra)
2 cans coconut milk
Sweet potatoes instead of regular 
Add 1 whole diced onion
Add 1/2 red pepper diced 
Add 1 C green beans

I cooked my chicken in pan first, i have issues adding raw chicken to my sauces even though i know fully cooked. Then i added potatoes. Then put spices including ginger and in stirred, until fragrant, 15 seconds. Added coconut milk and peanut butter and fish sauce. Simmer 20 minutes. Add onions and green beans in last 5-10 minutes when adding fresh lime juice. While its simmering, make rice. 

Very good, i would definitely make this again!

There has to be a BIG mistake in this recipe. It turned out horrible: sour, sour, sour (and I tasted and did not add the lime juice at the end!!!) - but I bet the tamarind paste has to be cut to maybe 1 tablespoon, or less!
It went down the drain, a perfect waste of time, money and effort to please...

I was so excited to make this dish as I love curry and this looked very doable. I wish I had picked up on the fact that the 5-star reviews almost all didn't use tamarind. I actually had it and used it according to the recipe and was completely overwhelmed by it. It was so sour, so strong, but I didn't want the whole dish to go to waste so I ended up adding potatoes, chicken, coconut milk, sugar, all to balance the flavor of tamarind.  It still doesn't taste quite right and now I have too much curry. Really wish I stopped at 1 tsp (yes 1 teaspoon, and the recipe called for 3 tablespoons!).

Not sure what I may have done wrong, but this had very little flavor.  It wasn't bad just didn't meet my expectations of flavorful curry.

We've made it three times and have had to improvise, but it gets better every time.  After the first try, we've eliminated the brown sugar, and it's still scrumptious.  I top it with cilantro and coconut, my husband tops his with fresh basil.  It will be a go to recipe in our kitchen.

oh my god!!!  soooo good!  i halved the peanut butter, added carrots and onion, and used sweet potatoes instead of russet or red.  PERFECT with a cup of jasmine tea!  This is definitely a keeper!

Super flavorful and delicious, but I added more substance to it later to bulk it up - potatoes, red and green peppers etc

Great recipe as is.  I also tried it while adding carrots and sweet potatoes and it works very well together.

This was easy to make and delicious. I just used red curry paste and soy sauce and worchestier (sp) sauce. I didn't use peanut butter, i used actual peanuts. I added a white onion and a carrot. I will definitely make this again.

I have actually made this a few times and done some lovely variations each time. This is a fun leaping off point for this gorgeous curry. Things that I learnt along the way? Use tamarind concentrate, the real thing made in India if you can. It is gorgeous. I added kafir lime leaves to mine, lovely!!!  I used almond butter in mine, very nice! I also used two cans of coconut milk. One in the cooking process, as indicated in the method, and one right at the end a couple of minutes before the lime juice. Don't let the curry come to a boil after that last can goes in.  ??

Yum.  I had no tamarind so a Tbl rice vinegar, a few dashes worcesthire = whalah!  I also am shooting for low carb so only used one potato and added carrots and onion (and of course garlic!) instead.  I hate to taint recipes, preferring to follow exactly but I was on a roll and this combo was a success. I will definitely make it again.  I highly recommend. Better than  the local restaurant

Already dreaming about the day we make this again!!! So incredibly delicious and tasted similar if not better than the curry at our local Thai restaurant that we love! The tamarind paste was a little hard to find but found it at Fresh Market and not our local grocery store. Added a chopped onion. We used chunky peanut butter which added a nice crunch to the dish.

Turned out great!  Didn't have tamarind either so I used a previous commenters suggestion of apricots, raisins and lemon juice.  May cut back the fish sauce just a little and add carrots next time.

This was the first time I made curry of any sort (and I am not any kind of master chef, just a college kid) and it turned out perfectly! Two changes: First, I couldn't find tamarind paste so I used Worcestshire sauce. 

Second, I had heard from a couple of people who had cooked curry before that the longer the curry could cook, the better it tastes, so I decided to convert this recipe into a slow-cooker version. 
I sauteed the chicken in the oil and transferred it to the slow-cooker, leaving some oil/juice behind. Poured in one and a half large potatoes and three medium carrots, peeled and chopped. Then I made the curry sauce, combining the other ingredients in the order of the recipe. Poured that over the chicken and vegetables, cooked on high for 3 hours and then on low for 2 hours. Served over jasmine rice, dressed with ripe avocado and cashews. Perfect and tasty meal for a cold night!

It was pretty good.  used 3 large boneless chicken breasts which were much more than the 1 1/4 pounds in the recipe, so I decided to double the recipe.  I wasn't sure that the curry was a true concentrated  "paste" , so I added some of my organic powder. It was called "Korma curry with creamy coconut and spices. Since it already had coconut, I just added one 13 ounce can of the coconut milk.  I also added 1/4 of a chopped vidalia onion and 1 chopped bell pepper. I reduced the potatoes to about 1 3/4 cups. I also substituted worcestershire sauce for the tamerind. The recipe called for starting the chicken first and adding the potatoes later, but it ended up taking the potatoes a longer time to get tender.  As a result, the chicken was not as juicy as I would have preferred. ( Next time I'll add them before the chicken). I also did not double the peanut butter. I used 1/3 cup. Everything else was as written in the recipe. ( but doubled).It had a yummy  but mild taste. I think I'd like more of a "bite" in it though.  I served over fluffy brown rice.

We really enjoyed this but because of previous reviews I cut the amount of peanut butter in half and increased the coconut milk to 1 1/2 cans. We like it spicy so we added hot pepper flakes.  We sprinkled peanuts on top.  Delish!  Very rich but all the men went back for seconds!  Glad I doubled the recipe.

It was awesome. I added an extra 1/2 can of coconut milk. Used sweet potato and added 1 tbsp of maple syrup, 1 tbsp rice wine vinegar and 1 tbsp lemon juice to replace the tamarind. Quick and easy recipe definitely will repeat this one.

I did not like this adaptation of one of my favorite dishes. Too much of all of the wrong flavors and turned out a thick, colorless mess. It is rare that I choose to waste food and skip a meal on my budget.

I took the advice of another and used fruit substitute instead of tamarind past and I loved it.  I used 1/2 c diced dried apricotes 1/2 c of dried cranberries 1/2 c of pitted prunes (yep) and it turned out fantastic.  I only used 1/2 c of peanut butter and added 1 T worcherster sauce & 1/4 c of raw cashews at the end to sauce.  Turned out great!

Very tasty. I would use about half the potatoes, because they gave it a weird texture, and substitute a different vegetable, something more crispy and maybe more colorful, just to augment the visual appeal. I will try a bit less brown sugar next time too, as it was somewhat sweet for may taste.

I thought the flavor was very good, but a little too intense.  The second time I made this I added extra coconut milk as others suggested and halved the amount of curry paste and tamarind paste.

This was extremely easy to prepare, and came out tasting as good as the better Massaman curries I've had at my favorite restaurants. I added some sliced avocado near the end (add it to early and it squishes). I used Mae Ploy brand curry paste.

This was a delicious recipe! It was a little bit too limey for my taste when we first ate it, but when we heated up the leftovers the lime flavor cooked out. Perhaps I just didn't cook it long enough in the first place. I added carrots and onions to the recipe and will add even more of those next time, as well as peanuts!

Fabulous!  I didn't have the tamarind, and I had to use lemon juice instead of limes, but it still turned out great.  I added peas and used red curry paste for color, though 2 tablespoon of the red curry paste made it way too spicy for my family.  Also, I cooked it almost an hour longer than the recipe stated and the potatoes were still crunchy.
