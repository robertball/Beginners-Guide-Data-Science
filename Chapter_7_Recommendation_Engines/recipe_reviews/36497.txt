Tasty brown rice recipe. Always use chicken stock and add extra corn. Any type of spice blend that you like will work.

This is very good - but it's plain, the word "spiced" does not belong in the name.  The rice cooks up nicely and tastes good, and the corn goes well, but you'd have to add a lot more spice before you would notice it with all that water and cooking time!  I used fresh corn and stirred it in for the last few minutes.

Surprise: An instant favorite for my husband!
I was doing it for a gathering and used one 2-Cup pkg brown rice, 1 teasp salt, 1 teasp fresh ground cumin. The can of Veg-All I had in the cupboard did not spoil the lovely flavors at all, but improved them.
As Asians sometimes do, I made a garnish of egg strip. My speed method was to whip 3 eggs, add salt and pepper, microwave 2 minutes, lift to allow egg to nuke uniformly, cook 2 minutes more and slice in 1/4 inch slices. SO....this accidentally turned into an entree. We're filing in _favorites_. Thank you very, very much Laurie, for this rare swift and easy GOOD recipe!

This is a great recipe and very easy to make. I boiled the rice in vegetable broth and added just a little bit of onion and shaved carrot - not enough to overpower. It was really good.

Very easy and tasty.  I like the texture of the brown rice and the cumin is a nice flavor.  Next time I will probably add some chopped red or green pepper to give it a little color.

I agree that the word spiced does not belong, but a nice change of pace for brown rice. I doubled the cilantro (which I used fresh) and i will add much more next time as it seems to get lost in the rice. Thanks for the post =)

This was quick and easy, but I added some ingredients as other readers suggested to improve the flavor.  I added 1 can of Rotelle (?sp) with chile peppers and about 1/2 c of onions.  I also ommitted the olive oil and used chicken stock instead of water.  Will make again.

I didn't have cumin seeds so I substituted ground cumin (1/2 t.), Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as written. I would make this again. Hubby liked it as is I would prefer to add sauteed  onions to the mix after cooking. all in all a good  recipe

I prepared this with quinoa instead of brown rice in the interest of time. The protein is a great bonus too. Otherwise, I followed it exactly. It turned out wonderful and even my 4 year old who won't eat quinoa generally loved this. It was meant to be a side dish next to the tacos I made, but everyone loved it IN the tacos. Awesome!

This was great, but I made a few changes as I didn't have cilantro or cumin seeds. I added two chicken bouillon cubes to the water, added garlic and onion powder, and 1 tsp of dried cumin. It may not be visually striking, but great on the taste buds!

This is a great recipe for brown rice which, I think, can tend to be rather dull, otherwise.  The only changes I made was to lightly brown the rice in the olive oil before adding the rest of the ingredients. I followed others' advice and used chicken stock in place of the water. I also did not have cilantro, so I didn't use it.  I used frozen peas instead of corn and used ground cumin. I know I made quite a few changes, but it turned out so delicious. I am sure I will use this recipe frequently when making brown rice.

This was pretty good!  I doubled the recipe because I didn't believe that only 1 cup of rice would have been enough for 2 people (I was wrong).  It was more than enough!  The only thing was I think it could have done without the cilantro...maybe that is just my personal taste, though.  I also used vegetable broth instead of water as some others have suggested.

This was pretty good. I doubled the spices and made with chicken broth, but it was still a tad bland. Next time I will definitely add something more.

Easy to make and tasted great.  I didn't have any cilantro on hand so I used dried basil.  I am not a fan of rice but know it is good for me, so this works for us!

This was yummy and a fantastic side dish, but I made a few changes.  I used low sodium chicken stock instead of water, used dried cumin instead of cumin seed (and probably used three times the amount), and used fresh corn instead of frozen.  I added the fresh corn almost at the end of the cooking process, just to heat it though.  Thanks for the recipe!

Good basic recipe.  I used garlic spiced chicken broth, added peas and corn and a can of fire roasted tomatoes.  Because of the extra liquid, I used 1/4 cup more of the rice.  Cumin, oregano, onion and pepper.  Nice side dish.

Instead of plain water, I used homemade chicken stock. I also used a good amount ground cumin instead of cumin seed. I made no other changes. The little ones liked this but my husband and I didn't much care for it. I'll make it again for them.

This recipe needed a little kick, so I added chicken stock, a lot more cumin than called for, thyme, greek seasonings, and substituted kidney beans for corn.

This is delicious and so easy. The only thing I changed was to use chicken stock instead of water. It's not heavily spiced or very "spicy" but the cumin flavor comes through nicely. It's a terrific complement to Mexican, Latin American, or South American flavors.

I can't rate it accurately because I changed it a bit. I sauteed a small onion and 2 cups frozen corn in olive oil and added 1 tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp salt, and 1 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro to a family size boil in bag package of brown rice (cooked in 1 quart water with 4 chicken boullion cubes). Loved it this way. :)

This was good. Not fantastic, but not bad at all. Just a good side dish to complement a good main dish. We would probably make it again, with something that is full of flavor. We added three cloves of garlic and it was yum.

it seemed a little too bland to be called "spiced" but it was still good. i did it in my rice maker and pulled back the water by 1/3. next time i'm going to try to add a bit more spice to jazz it up even more... even tho i enjoyed it as it was.

This was a good dish but, I have had better.  Took note of all the water and cook time and added tabasco sauce to kick it up a bit and I also added green peppers.  Was good and had it a gone at the end of dinner but, I will try some more things with this dish.

I added chopped mild jalapeno peppers, and omitted the cilantro (not a fan). This was a delicious side dish to a chicken enchilada casserole. Nutty, yet the peppers and corn added sweet crunch! Very good.

I like this as a side dish even though the flavor or "spice" is pretty subtle. It goes well with tacos or burritos or any Mexican meal, and it feels good to have something healthy to pair with those meaty-cheesy dishes.

I made this stuff to go with the Chicken Balsamic off this site- went together really nicely.  We were out of cilantro, so I used basil instead.  The spices arn't overpowering- it was a nice side dish.

This recipe didn't have much flavor.  It didn't taste any different than plain brown rice to me or my family.

I used 1 Tbs of fresh cilantro instead of 1/2 tsp of dried cilantro and it taste amazing. The cilantro and cumin flavor kill the dead flavor of the brown rice.

Good simple recipe. I add a bit more cumin for more flavor. I usually make this rice with chicken satay (a night that i will be eating by myself).

Too bland for our taste buds.  It smelled wonderful while cooking but lacked any of the spiced flavors. Followed the recipe, disappointed. Thanks for sharing though.

I did not have Cilantro, so I just put a little parsley in it.  I also cut up an onion and threw it in there as well.  I used ground Cumin.

It looked like fried rice, but the initial taste was disappointing.  The texture was good.  I used speckled butter beans instead of corn, since that's was on hand, and basil instead of cilantro.  I put juices from the slow cooker BBQ chicken on the rice and this helped the flavor.

Maybe if I were in a more generous mood, I might give this four stars, but it would be cutting it close.  It was just okay.  The corn was an interesting addition, but there was nothing "spiced" about it really.  Maybe if it had other spices?  But then again, with rice, you're not usually looking for a lot of flavor, so maybe that's the way it's meant to be.  Just didn't work for our family.  Sorry.

Doubled the peas to not waste any, and I actually love it (and I hate peas by their self)! Great, easy side dish. Will definitely make again.

Starting with my leftover rice, this made a wonderful and healthy lunch!  It's so easy to adjust the spices to your liking.  I will make this again - Thank you for sharing.

I used cumin powder since I didn't have cumin seed, minced fresh garlic and it was delicious. Easy just like the name.
