Amazing fries!  These were so good, and just the perfect balance of crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I made them just as the recipe directed, and we loved them!

Great recipe,  i've been making them this way for quite a while.  i like to add salt and garlic powder to mine.  These work amazingly well for chili fries, or cheesey fries also.   sprinkle shredded cheese on them before tossing with the season so it melts best.

Followed the recipe exactly and dumped 1# into my 5 quart fryer. Worked great. I am not sure the boiling water step is required but I’ll experiment some more.

I followed the recipe, but used more cayenne pepper. They were delicious! I didn’t expect them to be because after I started making them, I saw the tip that red potatoes wouldn’t work at all. Perhaps it was a fluke, but they were awesome! I did pick up some russets to make next time

Followed recipe except I added some turmeric for color and bit of smoked paprika. I added sea salt right before serving. They looked and tasted delicious and all gone!

Best Air Fryer fries, so far. I made these as written with the exception of adding more  cayenne. I will definitely make these again. Thanks for another great recipe!

Dusted off the air fryer I got for Christmas 2 years ago! This recipe made great fries. I soaked the peeled fries in hot tap water 15 minutes, 3 times to remove starch, followed recipe exactly otherwise. They were crispy and delicious! Thanks, Chef John!

Easy and delicious! I cut into steak fries because that’s what hubs prefers. Also use regular salt and no cayenne.
Definitely worth the extra steps for perfect fries.

Best air fryer fries yet... something about taking the starch out by soaking them... last time I did it, it was trash, this recipe works.
