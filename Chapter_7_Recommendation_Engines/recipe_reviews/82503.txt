Good cooking method, but the original recipe is not so tasty.  Made this to a T the first time and all I tasted was taco seasoning, taking away from the nice, sweet flavor of the sweet potato. So since then, I've tossed the potatoes in a large ziploc bag, drizzled with olive oil (about 1-2 tablespoon), and lightly sprinkle with kosher salt, sometimes with pepper if the kids aren't eating and toss to coat.  I bake the first 20 min. on 400, last 15-20 min. on 425.  1 hour is too much and burns them.  I've dipped these in ranch sauce (kid's fav), garllic aioli or just eat plain.  Good way to get the kids to eat sweet potatoes without frying - full of vitamin A and beta carotene.  Also great with steak dinners.  2 stars for original recipe - 5 stars with changes. Tip - put a greased sheet of foil on your cookie sheet - no sticking and no mess.

I'm giving this recipe five stars because I want people to *try* it. However, with the minor changes below!!  I made them and, sure enough, they burned on the bottom.  Didn't even need to flip them; the top was crispy enough. My suggestions pretty much go along with the rest listed in the reviews:

Cook at a lower temp ~ between 400-425 (NOT 450!)
I cut them into approx. 1/4" sticks (regardless of the size, I still think a lower temp is necessary to stop burning).
I just used kosher salt and fresh ground pepper, olive oil..tossed in a bowl to coat.  No extra spices.
Most certainly coat your cookie sheets with oil and you really do need to put them in single layers.

Follow these tips, and you should enjoy crispy, healthy, tasty sweet potato fries!

These were excellent!  I used olive oil in place of canola, and Cajun seasoning instead of taco seasoning.  Also lowered the temperature to 400F for the first 30 minutes and turned it up to 425F for the last half of baking.  The key to keeping these from sticking is spraying the pan with cooking spray - I had no troubles.  They were soft and crispy all at once and were fantastic paired with the Actually Delicious Turkey Burgers from this site.  Definitely recommend these fries, and don't be afraid to play with the seasonings to suit your taste!

These are great if you follow the recommendations of other reviewers.  I used three sweet potatoes (there's only two of us, and we even had leftovers), cut them like fries, and tossed them with chili powder, garlic powder, fresh pepper, kosher salt, and 2 Tbsp. olive oil.  I baked them for 40 minutes at 400 degrees (flipped them halfway), and they turned out so well and so healthy!

This recipe was good, but I made a different version. Instead of the taco seasoning, I used Lawry's seasoned salt. And olive oil, although tasty, isnt necessary. I just sprayed the pan with some nonstick cooking spray and that did the trick. Baked at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes and they come out crispy on both sides after turning, delicious and super healthy!

As per previous reviewers stated lower oven temp--I also changed spices up and have been making them as potato round with my crinkle cutter for years using just enough olive oil to toss with paprika spinkled on (sounds odd but its good!)  have also just used french fry seasoning on them. Dunk in ketchup as desired!  I swear by using Reynolds non stick foil and can get by with less olive oil--they get crisp faster with less oil and less baking!

Who'd have thought that fries could taste so good AND be healthy?! To speed things up, I microwaved each sweet potato for about 2-3 min. (make sure you prick them several times with a fork to let the air out).  This allowed me to only have to bake them for a half hour total time. Also, instead of using the spices the recipe called for, I used old bay seasoning (it's all I had at the time - and it's what I'll use from now on!) and everyone loved them! This will be a recipe I'll always come back to.

MMmmmm. Tasty. I also lowered the cooking temp - 425 and cooked them for about 45 minutes. They weren't as crispy as deep fried one, but they had a slightly crisp exterior. The second time I made them, I steamed the potato sticks until nearly done, then put them in the over for about 20 minutes. Much quicker, and they seemed to crisp up more. DH loved them! Great dipped in cranberry-mustard sauce. Just mix canned cranberry with a good quality mustard. Honey-mustard is my favorite. Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty - I added in some extra seasonings - brown sugar, onion powder, paprika and cajun seasoning.  
I will make these again for sure.

LOL...these reviews are freaking hilarious, how do you completely change the recipe and still give it  5 stars? its a completely new recipe... So anyways keepin with the trend here i figured i minus well add my 2 cents. ok So i made sweet potatoe fries, not this recipe at all. Cut the fries, added them to ziplock with olive oil , season salt, pepper, and garlic power, shaked, then baked. They were great. not this recipe but i will give it 4 stars for having me want to try to make sweet potato fries in the first place.

First off, forget the nasty PAM spray and use PARCHMENT PAPER. You get a perfectly browned French fry. I cut my fries, rinsed them, pat dry. Place in a bowl. Add about three tablespoons of olive oil; Toss well and spread out potatoes on your parchment lined cookie tray. I sprinkled them with sea salt, pepper, paprika, and a dash of cayenne! Bake at 425 for 15 min, then stir, bake an additional 10-15 and enjoy! (keep an eye on them the last 10 minutes). I used one VERY large sweet potato for the two of us!

Great side dish.  I have not had luck cooking these directly on a baking sheet.  To ensure crispness, place fries on a PAM sprayed baking rack, the one used to cool cakes and cookies.  Place this rack on a foil lined baking sheet, preferably a sheet with sides.  Having the fries raised on the rack allows the heat to circulate around the fries.  It works successfully for any type of fries even the frozen version from your local grocer.  This technique cannot be new.  Try it!

I made these using the suggestions of others... I only used 3 potatoes (which was more than enough for my boyfriend & I - with plenty of leftovers). I drizzled them with olive oil, sprinkled them with kosher salt, ground black pepper, and brown sugar. Put them on baking sheets with greased foil, baked them at 400 for 20 mins, turned them over, and baked at 425 for 15 more minutes. Perfection!

This was extremely good! I made it exactly as written except I used brown sugar instead of taco seasoning. It was a nice blend of sweet and spicy! I couldn't stop eating them! I baked them on parchment paper at 450 degrees for 30 minutes on the middle rack. They were perfect!

YUM! I really loved these!! I made a few adjustments to suit our taste..I used olive oil  instead of canola. I didn't use taco seasoning..I chose to use: salt, pepper, Old Bay, and cayenne pepper. My husband added some cajun seasoning to his. We baked the fries at 400 for 20 minutes. Flipped them, and baked them at 425 for an additional 15-20 minutes. Came out fantastic!! Even great re-heated the next day at lunchtime! Thanks so much for this recipe!! We will be making these again for sure!

Preheating the cooking sheet helps crisp them up.  Lining the slices up not touching also helps cook them evenly and keeps them from steaming and being soggy.

These were wonderful.  First batch used olive oil, which I believe made it burn quicker. 
Second batch, used veg oil, skinned sweet potato, cut ends and sides of potato to make chips, and used the rectangular potato to make perfect in size from one end to the other.  Placed on center rack, instead of top rack.  These are great!  
I didn't have taco seasoning, so made the homemade stuff off this web site and it was great also.   "Taco Seasoning I " by Bill.   It is so good!

Great idea...I wanted to make Sweet Potato Fries like the ones in some restaurants and I found this recipe. First batch came out limp and gooey.  Try using peanut oil (although expensive - has many uses). Use a paper towel and soak it a bit in the peanut oil and rub on cookie sheet. Don't do the bag thing or else they turn out gooey. Add crushed sea salt and they are very tasty. Tablespoon of melted butter on the pan before adding the fries also enhances flavor. Do not refrigerate the sweet potatoes before cooking...can ruin flavor. Also Sweet potatoes are hard to cut no matter how sharp your knife is...try microwaving for 30 seconds or less to soften up for the cut. Excellent low cal nutritious side dish (even with the butter and peanut oil)!

I served this dish with bbq tofu sandwishes (recipe on this site with my review) and fresh cole slaw.  I used two large sweet potatoes--it is all they had at the market--and after cutting them into fries, I ended up only using 1 1/2 potatoes for my husband and me.  There was so much leftover that we had lots to feed our two dogbabies.  I seasoned with salt, cracked black pepper, cayenne, and coriander.  This made for a sweet and spicy seasoning that didn't overwhelm the potato flavors.  I only used a tbsp on oil, as I have heard too much oil can actually just make them soggier and soft.  I spray the foil with pam and put the potatoes on a baking pan, like others have suggested, and I made sure to put the fried in a single non-crowded layer.  In my gas oven, I baked the fries at 450 for 20 mins, turned them, and baked ten more minutes.  I ended with a short broil, 2-3 minutes, to crisp them a bit.  This made for perfect fries.  They were not super crispy, but they were delicious.  I give it a four because of the changes I made, but I hope you will try this simple, nutritious (packed with beta carotene and vitamin A), and delicious recipe.

Overall the method is very good but I only used kosher salt and pepper as seasoning. A warning to those who have electric ovens, turn it waaaaay down. Even 400 was too high for my oven, my first batch burnt for the most part. My next batch I cooked at 350 for 30 minutes and then went from there.

I loved these.  I prepared the fries chip style using my mandolin.  I read alot of reviews so elected to toss in olive oil and then sprinkled 1/2 with plain salt and pepper and the other half with cajun seasoning since that is what I had.  I cooked at 400 degree oven and put fries on sprayed foil on the sheet to save me some labor.  they took 40 minutes and were crunchy and soft in the middle.  Wonderful!

First of all, an IMPORTANT WORD OF WARNING: Do not combine the sweet potatoes with the seasoning mix earlier in the day!!!! The first time I made this recipe I did this, and the potatoes leached moisture and ended up being a soggy, disgusting, completely inedible disaster. I baked them, hoping they'd "dry out" but it didn't work... I had to sacrifice the entire batch. :-(
My second attempt at making these was much more successful! The only thing I changed from the original recipe was to substitute the Canola for Olive Oil and reduce the cooking time to 40 minutes in total. They were crispy, tasty, and a reasonably healthy alternative to regular fries.

Although some will be soft in the middle and some black or hard on the ends, they are delicious. I skipped the taco seasoning. I like them with McCormick Seasoned salt, onion powder, ground pepper, garlc powder, and a small dash of curry powder. You can totally play with the seasonings! 2 good size sweet potatos made a large pile enough for 2-4 people depending on portion sizes. Like another reviewer said, make sure you use a sharp knife and a non-slip cutting surface as it is a little difficult cutting a raw sweet potato into french fries.

I used olive oil, fresh chopped garlic, rosemary, season all, fresh ground black pepper, and sea salt and it was great! 

I followed other's directions as far as the oven temp.  i love sweet potato fries!

I have made this twice now to accompany a hamburger.  I've been using "marisella Oct, 31,2007" review.
She uses chili powder, garlic powder, fresh pepper, and Kosher salt (all to taste) and two TBS olive oil.
400 degrees for 40 minutes.  She has it down pat!  For just the two of us; two smallish sweet potato's are plenty.

Delicious!  I changed these just a little by cutting the sweet potatoes into large wedges, like steak fries, and also used a little light brown sugar to really crisp them up and get them brown.  So much better than deep frying.

All i can say is to forget the taco seasoning! Replace it with a sprinkle of french fry seasoning and cinnamon instead. You won't be sorry.

I decided to get these done a little faster, and make it easier to cut up.  So I put the potatoes in the microwave for about 3-4 minutes so they were cooked a little bit.  Than I cut them up in to fries.  My cayenne was on the very top shelf, and I am short so it got left out.  It could have used the spice, the Taco seasoning didn't come out for me.  I did put some salt.  My fries cooked for about 30 minutes and were quite crispy.  I think pre-baking the sweet potatoes helped.  These were really good, and will be made again.

Great and fun for the family.  If you don't have taco seasoning, just through some salt, pepper, chili powder into the mix.

Still searching for a sweet potato fry recipe that is crispy on the outside.  Not sure if this is possible, but this isn't the recipe.  Since I was just making this for the two of us, I eyeballed the seasonings according to the amount of fries I was making.  Tasty, tender on the inside, but definitely not crispy.

I cooked them at 375 degrees for an hour, they were a little to crispy. I would decrease the time by 15 minutes. Other than that they were great. I loved the flavor.

Tastes good - and dark color good for me - white starch is no good for diabetics.  Problem:  How do you peel these varmints?  Or do you leave the skin on.  I used a potato peeler.  Wont do that again.  Please tell me how to peel without all the agony!  Parboil?

Unless you are cutting really thick fries, the oven temp and cook time are too much. I put these in at 375 for 15 minutes, turned and baked 15 minutes more which was perfect. Other than that, I followed the recipe and they were great!

I love the idea of this recipe but I must have done something wrong - my fries were quite soggy - I followed other recommendations re: cooking time - 30 mins at 400 then 30 mins at 425. They were still tasty but I was missing the crispy factor. Any ideas???

Wow!  Spicy with just a hint of sweet! I loved them, but hubby thought they were just a tad too hot for his likes. Next time, if I'm feeling nice, I'll cut back on the cayenne for him; but I liked them just as is!  Went great with our grilled brats.

I really love how the sugars in the sweet potato caramelize on the outside.  Tough to get that right texture with crispy on the outside and not soggy on the inside but once you do this a few times and figure out the right timing/thickness of fries in your particular kitchen it turns out great.  I usually add more spice and like adding chipotle pepper flakes to the mix.

These were tasty but it seemed like the taco seasoning overpowered the sweetness of the potato but I did enjoy the spice from the cayenne.I will make this again but instead of taco seasoning,just cayenne,paprika,chilli powder and salt.

I like others used a different seasoning, also used olive oil, tasted good but one side of the potatoes burned the other side didn't brown enough, I used parchment paper so they didn't stick but they were not crispy.  Will try this again but at a lower temp. or not so long.

I really enjoyed this side dish!  I love sweet potatoes and I especially love spicy food.  This was a great combination of flavors.  I did cut down on the heat and the amount of seasoning for fear of them turning out too salty for my taste.  Excellent!

I really enjoyed these! Unfortunately, I didn't have the taco seasoning on hand but they tasty even without it. My only complaint is they tend to be soggy and I found them to burn easily so keep a close eye on them. Next time I will just use sea salt to season.

I make sweet potatoes too and put them on my large stoneware bar pan, then I don't have to turn them.  I put them in a bowl and drizzle with olive oil and lightly season them with salt, gourmet pepper and vegetable seasoning mix. Then I spread them in a single layer on the pan. They are ready in about 30 to 40 minutes.

I took the advice of previous reviewers and baked these in a 400 degree oven on a cookie sheet lined with tin foil. I used 1 tblsp of cajun seasoning mix as well as 2 tblsp cornmeal. The cornmeal really added a nice crispness to the outside of the fries. These were delicious!

I cut the recipe in half & I cut the sweet potato into 1/4" slices instead of fries...it only took a total of about 40 minutes to cook that way but they still didn't get very crispy even after I broiled for a couple of minutes. We didn't care!!! These were soooo tasty! We dipped them in Honey Mustard Sauce (from allrecipes) & they were fabulous!

This was really good..however I took the advice of others and lowered the temp to 425-400...and it still burned@! Maybe next time I will cut the pieces bigger...but regardless it was still very good and my fiance loved it. He ate the whole pan! I put the cut potatoes in a bag, drizzled olive oil and pepper & salt shook the bag and put on a sprayed pan. They did not stick at all. I also sprinkled 1/2 cajun spice on half of the batch. VERY good!

The spices on these fries make them addictive but I've made them twice now and haven't achieved quite the right texture yet.  The first batch had skinnier fries and many seemed to dry and shrivel.  The second batch I made thicker fries but they never seemed to get crisp on the outside, they were just kind of soggy.  Hmmm...

Be careful to cut the fries all the same size so they cook evenly. Otherwise, some will burn while others won't be cooked enough. Also, feel free to mix up your own blend of spices to personalize your fries! We found 2 large sweet potatoes made more than enough fries for 2 people.

These were very tasty, but very easy to burn. Watch them closely and I also recommend a lower temperature, 350. I also used coconut oil instead of olive oil, much tastier and healthier. I seasoned them with kosher salt and black pepper. I will definitely make these again.

The coating burned long before the potatoes were cooked. Perhaps lower temperature for longer would have worked.

These were delish! PLEASE make your own taco seasoning. There are many great taco seasoning recipes on this site. I used Taco Seasoning I, omitting the pepper. Another twist on this recipe is to use cinnamon sugar instead of taco seasoning - that makes it sweet instead of savory. I personally like them better as written than what the other reviewers suggest. It's just up to your mood, I guess.

I don't understand why these fries don't have a five star rating--they're delicious, AND healthy! My mother and I made these for Thanksgiving dinner (we're Canadian--that's October for us) and loved them. Hint: if you don't like spicy foods, leave out the cayenne pepper.

Also gave 5 stars so people would try, but like many others I did not use taco seasoning. I used chili powder, sugar, and kosher salt. My whole family LOVED them, even the 3 year old, said "yummy mommy!". Thanks for the cooking method and recipe.

These were delicious but I did take the advice of others and lower the temp. I also had a problem with the fries getting stuck to the aluminum foil I had baked them on..make sure to use some type of cooking spray prior.

This turned out wonderfully. Instead of canola oil, I used olive oil.  Plus, I dipped the fries into fat-free sour cream with a little bit of curry mixed in. VERY yummy! Also good dipped in ketchup with a touch of curry.

Very good, with some adjustments. Based on what others said in reviews, I used cayenne, salt and pepper to season and about 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Cooked at 400 for just under an hour. They turned out great!

These were quite good even though mine did burn a bit (at 425).  I think next time I'll omit the taco seasoning (maybe there's is sugar in it?) and just go with salt and pepper.  Definitely will try again as we LOVE sweet potatos!

top of baking 30 mins then bottom of roasting approx. 30 mins.  Watch so they don't burn.  Shake in bag like recipe says - I sprayed tatos first with spray oil before placing in bag and shaking.  I used powdered garlic 7/4/10.  Need to use something spicier.  Try Old Bay or Cajun Shake or Foreplay.

Very good! I've tried other sweet potato fry recipes before...this is one of the best. Next time I will use my own spices rather than the taco seasoning. I did add some fine bread crumbs to coat the potatoes. That seems to soak up some of the moisture that makes them limp. They cooked in less time than the recipe called for.

I used actual sweet potatoes which are not orange(those are yams). I sprayed a stoneware cookie sheet with olive oil spray & sprinkled with taco seasoning. Pre-cooked the potatoes in the microwave for 5 min and the sliced uniformly.  Laid out in a single layer on the sheet and sprayed with the olive oil and sprinkled them lightly with the seasoning.  Baked at 400 for 25 min, then flipped and baked for another 20 min.  They were slightly crunchy and pretty good.  Next time I will broil them for a couple minutes for extra crispness.

I followed the advice from mommyfromseattle, and these turned out great! I omitted the taco seasoning and cayenne pepper so the kids would like them, and they were delicious. I drizzled olive oil over the potatoes and sprinkled salt over them and tossed to coat. I then baked them in the oven for 20 minutes at 400 degrees, and then 425 degrees for the last 10 minutes. Very good!

Very good but needs a little more spice. Also, bake on a cooling rack set on a baking sheet to get them crispier.

This recipe is awesome.  I did make a change, instead of the seasoning and corn oil I used olive oil and 1 tablespoon of Emeril's essence seasoning.  You can not stop eating these.

I gave it a four star only because some of the ingredients in the original are not healthy & needed to be changed. Canola oil is an unhealthy oil.  I won't use packaged taco seasoning either. I prefer to mix my own from healthy ingredients. Other wise, this is a great recipe! Great way to get children to eat a healthier version of fries (with the change in ingredients)!

I make these all the time;however, I only season them with salt & paprika, & use olive oil. Bake for 30 mins at 425;then turn the broiler on for a few mins, that wil crisp them up a bit. Yes they are a pain to cut up into fries, but I use my santoku knife & it's a breeze;definately worth the effort-these are so good you feel like you are cheating!!!

In my experience, sweet potato fries have to be cooked at a much higher temp than this- like 500 for 30 minutes and flipped a few times to ensure even cooking. Otherwise, they won't get at all crispy. Like another reviewer, I have never seen "small" sweet potatoes, so I too used two large ones. The flavor was great though. I will make again, just with the baking temp and time tweaked a bit.

These were really great! I also baked at 375 for 20 minutes each side and used olive oil. I sliced them thin and they were perfect!

I only used two sweet potatoes b/c I had big ones. I don't know why this recipe calls for 6 b/c I've never seen small sweet potatoes, but I guess they exist. I also didn't leave them in the oven as long as the recipe required b/c they started to burn. Good recipe though. I would suggest maybe 30-45 minutes in the oven. I only left mine in for 30 but I like my fries squiggly.

A bit too spicy for the kids, but I loved them!  Use parchement (sp?) paper on your baking pan for easy flipping!

What a great recipe!  I cubed the sweet potatoes, seasoned them as directed and grilled them in a foil packet.  They were the best.  Will definitely make them again.  Thanks!

Love sweet potatoes in all of their many forms, but the cooking temp and time  on this needs to be adjusted to I don't know what.  Cut mine into what I would consider to be a normal size, even some a bit thick thinking that they would shrink when cooking.  They burned within the first 30 minutes at 425 degrees.  I have a gas oven...Three stars because I know that this recipe has potential.  I've had frozen chipotle fries at home and enjoyed the them, and the seasoning on this tastes just like those...I may try to make this again, first steaming the fries, then either bake at my normal cooking temp of 350 and monitor them very closely, or briefly pan fry.

Cooking time/temp is way off. It does NOT take 30 minutes on each side. Less than 10 minutes into baking these they were almost black on the first side. Turn frequently, bake at 400 and 7 minutes each side. I didn't even preheat the oven fully.

A mushy, mushy mess. I cut two batches of different widths for testing--one just as the recipe says, one thinner. Both were a mushy mess.

Delicious!! Coming from someone that didn't start eating this beautiful orange veggie until about 2 years ago I loved this! Nice a spicy and sweet! Big hit with the family. Think I may fry them next time though, just to get a better texture on them. They were perfect inside, but outside was almost overdone.

Followed others responses... cut them relatively small, salt, pepper (lots of both), 1tbsp of olive oil and a sprayed baking sheet. 400 degrees, 25 mins, then 425 for 15 - pretty crispy, very delish, really easy!

We tried a few different seasonings...the cajun and salt was my husband's favorite, and mine was the cinnamon and sugar.  We baked at 400 for 20min and then flipped and baked at 425 for another 20 minutes.  Perfect, and endless topping options (we want to try the old bay seasoning next time)

Mine only took 30 minutes to cook.  I used the taco seasoning, but used olive oil instead of canola and added couple dashes of Old Bay Seasoning.  Very good!

I've never prepared sweet potatoes before & this was a good example.  I baked at 425 degrees for 25 minutes on one side & flip, then 20 minutes on the other.  I nixed the taco seasoning & cayenne pepper & instead use onion powder, garlic powder, salt & pepper.  Excellent with ranch dip.

I followed others suggestions and tried to cook these on 400 for one hour.  Some were black and others were mushy.  Not what I hoped for.  I will have to look for another recipe.

These were very good even though they were burnt after 25 minutes of cooking. My oven is very accurate and I cut them to the same width as shown in the picture. I should have read the review before cooking but was in a hurry! Next time I will lower oven temp and cook for 10-15 minutes and then flip over for another 10-15. A whole hour and these would have been petrified and inedible!

I, like some other users, think 2 tablespoons of taco seasoning to way too much.  It took away the sweet taste of the sweet potatoes.  They would have been a lot better if I didn't use as much seasoning, but they were, overall, pretty good.

Sweet potato fries are delicious and versatile, but this recipe didn't work for me. I didn't even use the spices recommended here but just the recipe as a starting point. I used olive oil and also oiled the baking sheet. I did bake at the suggested temperature, but still found it took well over 40 minutes on each side, and even then most of the fries turned out soggy. I think cutting them very very evenly is key, and every oven varies so it's good to just keep a close eye on them and adjust as needed. I will definitely experiment more with this though as the fries are delicious as is, or with any variety of spices.

The 425 oven setting was too high -- 375 is hot enough, especially if your fries are on the thin side.  Used paprika, garlic powder, cinnamon, s & p to flavor.  Served with a nutmeg dip.  GREAT!~

My first attempt making a fry that I love! I had one huge sweet potato and I used veg oil, kosher salt, and pepper in place of the other spices. My fries really stuck to the greased foil, so I might use extra oil/spray to avoid the sticking problem in the future... But they were sooo tasty! Next time, I'll also drop the oven temperature a bit. Thanks for sharing!

I've made this several times, and never have a problem with burning. However, I use a  glass baking dish and spray with Pam. I generally use one large sweet potatoe for the two of us. I do not peel them, and I cut into fries not too thick. I toss them into a bowl, add salt & pepper, add about 2 cloves of diced garlic and about 2 tablespoons of virgin olive oil. Mix to coat. Microwave on Baked Potato setting, then toss to mix again. Bake at 375 for about 30-40 minutes. I add about 1 tablespoon of butter, and mix just before serving. Awesome!

I used the Taco Seasoning I recipe instead of store bought mixes (It is yummy). I still added the cayenne pepper to it. These fries were delicious and had a nice kick to them!

After reading all the reviews, I didn't even try the taco seasoning.  I used Tony Sachiere's (sp?) instead.  I've made it twice now, following the cooking instructions, and both times they burned around the edge of the pan.   I'm going to try one more time and use more potatoes (so the pan is more crowded) and slice them a little thicker.

These are not good at all. No one in my family liked them even a little bit. I turned the oven down to 400 like some others suggested and after 30 minutes the bottoms were black. So, half of them burned but they were actually the best tasting because they were the only ones that weren't soggy. Plus, cutting sweet potatoes is hard. I will not make these again. Maybe chips would be better.

With adjustments, 5 stars. Not the prettiest fries, but so good-- I love them to taste like sweet potatoes (not seasoning) and they are wonderful. I just don't like the process of cutting the sweet potatoes into fries. I did try making these with the seasoning, and that deserved 1 star, definitely recommend leaving that out. You also don't need a lot of oil.

These fries got scorched in my oven on both sides after only 25 minutes!  I'm thinking it was probably my oven that's at fault.  Still, I would not waste the energy to make these again.  :(  Maybe I'll try again and re-review if we get a new oven.  Thanks for sharing the recipe though!

This was great.  I substituted the taco seasoning for chipolte chili pepper, cumin pepper like the previous rater, and salt and pepper- fantastic!  The rest of the recipe I followed as it said and it was great.  Thanks!

UNBELIVABLE  My husband and I just finished it all right off the pan..Mind you we used 2 potatoes. But it was so amazing we couldn't even bring ourselves to use plates..   We upped the cayenne pepper for a spicier treat

I am so in love with these! I have a hard time getting them really crispy like regular fries. Maybe I will try broiling them a little next time. You can add as much or as little seasoning you want. Heck, change it up once in a while too! GOOD and Good for you!! don't forget to leave the skins on, more fiber that way. Winner! Thanks and will make again and again.

These are really tasty. After reading the reviews I cooked them for 30 minutes at 400 and then to crisp them up I broiled for about 2 minutes.  The broiling really helped, but they will burn quickly if you don't keep an eye on them.

These are good, but it is difficult to cook them without burning them or having them be limp.  I recommend slicing the fries very thinly and turning them frequently.

I followed a review to first bake for 20 min at 400, then 20 at 425. Well, after 10 min ( when I finally got around to checking my oven) quite a few had burned, upsetting as I hate to waste food. Cut these bigger than you think they should be-- they shrank a lot while baking and became small and puny. I'm thinking maybe 30 min at 400 is best...I only used salt, pepper, paprika, and chilli powrder, but it didn't come through much/ Also, use less oil than you think--I used 2 TB and it made the potatoes more moist. Do not use any wax paper--it sticks to the potatoes and also takes away from the crispiness.

DELICIOUS! I used olive oil and a little sea salt and lightly buttered my baking sheet. I cooked them at 425° for 20 minutes on each side and they were perfect.  The sugar in the "sweet" potatoes comes out when cooking and may brown a little darker than you expect, but adds to the taste. . . sort of like roasted marshmellows!  We'll definitely use this recipe often. Thanks for sharing it!

Loved it!!! A great way to incorporate a powerhouse vegetable.  My son usually doesn't like sweet potatoes but he ate these with some dippy sauce.  My husband and I both loved them especially b/c they had a little kick. I will definately make these again!

I have to give this 4 stars because I love spice and I love sweet potatoes, but I am usure what happened with the cooking instructions. I didn't spray the pan before baking and definately should have because I could even get them off the pan to flip them. I also agree the outside ones burned and the inside ones were mushy, luckily my family liked them that way. The second time I made them I cooked the potatoes first then cut them in fries tossed them with seasoning and broiled them for about 5 minutes, perfect!

Nice easy recipe to follow. As others have mentioned, separate the fries on the baking sheet or they won't crisp up. I like the fact that you can simply change the seasonings and get a whole different fry. I used garlic & parmesan the other night

Maybe I did something wrong? I wouldn't make these again. Some reviewers said their fries burned, so I used parchment paper to avoid them sticking to the pan, and it worked, but they never got crispy. They were also too spicy for me, but I used the recipe for the taco seasoning on this site, and I think it would have worked better if I omitted the cayenne pepper from this recipe. I also have never had sweet potato fries, and in my opinion, the sweetness of the sweet potato fries clashes with the spices. I ended up throwing them away.

Oh my gosh, these were so good.  I seriously couldn't stop eating them.  I think I ate half before my husband even got home for dinner.  I baked them at 425 for 20 minutes on one side, 15 on the other, and broiled for about 2.  Next time I think I'll lower the temp and broil longer to make them crispier (they were already starting to burn when I tried to crisp them).  But they were awesome.  Served them with Veggie Burgers from this site and it was an awesome meal (albeit a tad time consuming).

Yum. These were really good!  They were a healthy option for a night when I was craving sweet AND salty, and was tempted to go for fries and a chocolate shake. I'm so glad I made these instead.  I used 2 sweet potatos and threw them in a bag with 1 TBS. olive oil. I didn't have taco season, so I threw in some garlic powder, Lawry's seasoned salt, cumin and black pepper. Mixed it up and threw it on an oiled pan. I did 20 minutes at 425, then mixed them up/turned them and did another 25 minutes. They were a bit soggy, but a quick 1 minute under the broiler crisped them right up!

We love sweet potatoes, so it's hard to mess them up in our opinion. I cut them into probably nearly 1/2 inch fries and only tossed them with oil, then shook a little salt on. Baked 20 min at 400, then maybe 12 min at 425. The edges were crip, but we were fine with that.  They still held the shape and were able to be dipped.  YUM!

This was good but it is tricky to get the fries to be crispy, but not burnt. Mine were half and half. I  would say follow the others suggestions about lower heat and oil the pan and I would add that you have to stay by the oven and be vigilant, turn them often with a metal spatula, also be careful not to cut the fries too thin, 1/4 inch is good.

Went very well with my turkey burgers the other night.  I too experienced mushy fries, however I don't know that there is a remedy without frying (for sweet potatoes, anyway)!  I added some cumin to the mix and thought these were fantastic.  Thank you!

I used the exacts on this recipes except i also changed the temp to 400 and i only baked them for about 15 min on each side. My husband loved them and they seemed to be the perfect combo of soft and crisp.

My boyfriend and I love these.  I cook them on 375 for about 40-45 minutes, turning occassionally.  I don't use the taco seasoning, just a mix of spices, garlic, chili, etc. No, they don't get super crunchy like french fries, but they aren't fried.

I've made these twice already. My family loves them. I went for something different as a side dish for Lamb this time. The natural sweet flavor of the sweet potatoes just added such a nice contrast to the savory Lamb. 

This is a definite keeper.

love em love em love em...I bake them hot (400 degrees) with plain olive oil brushed on the wedges (not too much!  3 - 4 T max), 45 min.  served with miracl whip and ground chipotle chili pepper shaker on the side...watch carefully for burning...they will be soft with a little browning...dip one side in mayo and the other in a teensy bit of ground chipotle chili for a delicious hot/cold sensation!!

I generally love sweet potato fries, but this recipe was a major disappointment. Not only did the seasoning burn at 425 degrees, but also the fries were only edible if dipped in a caramel sauce. Will NOT make again even with modifications!

YUM!  I've made these probably five times in the last few weeks!  So easy, and delicious.  They don't crisp that well, but because these are so much healthier than regular fries I will gladly overlook it.  I cut the fries thin and they never need as much time as called for.  Maybe I'll try turning down the oven next time.

Delicious! Not crispy enough though. I didn't have any of the spices that the recipe required so I used dried basil, lots of paprika and salt, and olive instead of canola oil. They weren't as  spicy but I loved them and will definately cook them again!

These were absolutely delicious!  I served them with mango kechup, four parts sweet mango chutney (find in the Indian foods section) to one part prepared ketchup.  I cut them a little larger than a prepared Wendy's size fry (they shrink while cooking).  I used peanut oil and Tony Cachere's seasoning (thanks previous reviewer).  I checked and flipped at 20 and 40 minutes, and they were finished at 60 minutes. Next time I'm going to try them with sweet curry powder and kosher salt.  Thanks!

I can't believe so many people had a problem with the fries burning.  Mine took over an hour to cook, and I think I sliced them thin (about the size of Wendy's fries).  My family loved them.  I used 4 large sweet potatoes and three of us gobbled them up looking for more.

BURNED!  With all the work I did to cut the sweet potatoes too!  Next time, I'll just bake them.  What a waste!  Maybe mine were too thin?  Dimensions may have helped.

These were great because I don't like regular potatoes. I made them with cinnamon spice and a sugar/salt mixture. They do get crispier if you cut them up in smaller strips so I reccommend that. I bet you could dip these in some great sauces....

I made these last night and they were so amazing, I'm going to make them again today! I added a pinch of salt, paprika and black pepper to my seasoning. I baked them as directed, but today I will try frying them since they didn't come out as crispy as I'd like, but they were still awesome.

i used one humongous sweet potato. i tried my best to use the right amount of seasonings (about one sixth of the original recipe.) and my cook time was ten min per side at 400 degrees. turned out pretty good, about like any other homemade sweet potato fries. the seasoning was an interesting change. i can't seem to get my family interested but thats not the recipes fault, i guess they just prefer regular fries.

We like them the first batch. The second time I brushed them with coconut oil and left out the taco seasoning and used a bit of Mediterranean Sea salt. 
It now one of our favorite side dishes.

Not sure what I did wrong, but they weren't crispy at all!  I even broiled them to the point where some of them started to burn.  Maybe I used too much oil?  They still tasted ok, but I like them crispy.  I even cut them fairly thin, thinking they would get more crispy.

Made these tonight. I only used two sweet potatoes – there were enough fries for me and and my husband, and then some. I spiced them with a ton of Cayenne pepper and a tiny bit of Lowry's seasoning salt. The spice provides a nice contrast to the sweetness of the potatoes. They were DELICIOUS!!

Took FOREVER to cook! At 45 minutes in the oven they were STILL not crispy, so I left them in a little longer. They burned. Ironically, I cut them really thin too!

These were great!  I cut them very thin.  I love the idea of shaking the seasonings and oil in a bag.  I also added a little garlic salt.  Thank you!

The flavor was good on these but the crisp/soft consistency was not so much. I started them out in the oven at 425 and after 15 minutes they were burning. So I turned the oven down to 375 and baked a total of about 45 minutes and they came out soft and not crunchy at all, which is what I was hoping for. Maybe if I would've cooked them for a whole hour they could've had more crunch?

Fantastic! My only complaint is that I couldn't quite get them to crisp as much as I'd like, but maybe i just need to have them in the oven at a higher temp for longer...

These were WAY too spicy! I followed the recipe to a T, but these burned and had little flavor. I had to add sea salt to give them some flavor. If I do make these again, I will cut down on the taco seasoning and the cayenne, and add garlic pawder, sea salt and cracked pepper. I think the temp and cook time was not right, because these burned

I had already mixed in the Mexican spices (taco seasoning less the salt) by the time I read all the reviews that said that was a bad idea but once we tried them out, we thought it tasted great!

It's a good recipe to try, and the fries that didn't burn were really good! Cook at a lower temperature and watch for a good cooking time.  Mine was no where near an hour.

Didn't read most of the reviews till after I was done cooking them. Will try again with a lower heat. Other then burning on the bottom and watching them closely after that, they were awesome. Will try again at a lower heat.

Still tasted like sweet potatoes, and I'm not much of a fan...  they came out soggy rather than crispy, and some of them burnt.  I guess they'd be alright if you were a big fan of sweet potatoes...

Don't know WHY I can't get these to come out crispy - but my 6yo and her friend have dubbed them, "The best thing EVER!"  :)  I went simple with EVOO and kosher salt.  Added cinnamon/sugar to half of the batch.

I loved these sweet potato fries, but as others have said you need to lower the temp to 400 or they will burn. I only cooked them for 20 minutes on each side. I made homemade taco seasoning and it tasted good.

All of us liked these, including my 8 year old son! These will be our new recipe when we eat fries. I used seasoning salt instead of the taco seasoning. I can see that oven temperature and cooking time will have to be worked on. I did adjust per other reviewers and I am sure it is all to do with how thick you slice your potatoes. I have a french fry slicer so I can make consistant sized fries each time. As healthy as these are and as delicious as they are I think they are worth working with to help us get healthy. A definite addition to my regular rotation.

These are just so gorgeous.  I did follow other people advice and lowered the oven temperature.  I used PAM spray instead of Canola oil and also used Cajun seasoning in place of taco seasoning.  The only negative for me was that I could not get these to crisp, next time I will cut back on the oil and play around with them a bit.  Even so they were still wonderful.

I skipped the taco seasoning as suggested by another reviewer and just used olive oil, salt and a light sprinkling of cayenne pepper. Simple, healthy and well worth the effort, I'll be making these often, especially since even my picky two year old (who won't eat mashed sweet potatoes) liked them.

I ended up using too much oil even though I followed the reviews instead of the original recipe. I will cook it at a higher temp for a shorter time with less oil next time I do this. I also added different seasonings.

i don't like sweet potoatoes, but wanted to eat a low glycemic carbohydrate...so i tried these. They definately mimicked a french fry and the flavor was good, so i will make these again as a healthey alternative....but i still don't like sweet potatoes. i gave it for stars for how palatable the seasoning and cooking method made this root veggie.

I thought they were quite good actually. Mixed them in a ziplock with some EEVO,pepper, garlic salt, seasoned salt (just a bit) and a teaspoon and a half of cayenne pepper. They were about as crispy as your going to get them unless you leave them  in a bit longer but 20 minutes at 400 degrees one side and turn them and bake for about 23 minutes more and they turned out great.

I made these with a mixture of seasoning salt and a few dashes of cayenne.    Lower temp. oven reduces the chance of burning, especially if your fries are on the thinner side.  Hubby is now a sweet potato fan!  Can't make enough batches for the family.  I'm so glad I gave this a try.

Cutting up sweet potatoes is a pain in the neck, but so worth it!  I even just made these with the oil and then put kosher salt on them for the last 5 minutes of cooking.  Delish!

I think I must have done something wrong. After reading all the reviews, I adjusted the spices to our taste (used garlic powder, chili powder and seasoning salt) and had high hopes. But no matter how long I left those things in the oven, they were not crispy at all.  They came out a floppy mess, and I figured maybe my oven doesn't cook hot enough.  I will try again with a hotter temperature because the flavor was fantastic.

This recipe was great with a little change. I did not do the taco seasoning but the cayenne pepper tasted amazing on it alone. wow. so much flavor. however, mine kept burning so i turned down the heat a bit and flipped them once. I also did not coat in oil. I drizzled evoo on top lightly and then sprinkled the pepper. I think that if they did not burn, they would have been crisp!

By changing the seasoning (salt, garlic powder, turmeric, ginger, mustard powder, and paprika) I got these to taste great. They were not as crispy as I would have liked though.

I tried to take into account all of the reviews, but these still turned out like a disaster. The sweet potato and taco seasoning just didn't match up well. I can see how these may be good with cinnamon, sugar and butter, but not as is...

I have tried these a couple of times.  I followed other suggestions and lowered the temp.  They either turn out soggy and not burnt or burnt and crispy.  I cannot find a happy medium.  They taste good, but I cannot get a texture I like.

Have made this several times now. They never really come out crispy but they're still pretty good. Great healthy alternative to regular fries.

A great and easy recipe!! I followed the directions, but cooked them only about 40 minutes, turning them over 1/2 way through. We like spicy foods, so the taco seasoning and cayenne pepper was great!!

I did what others said to and used a cooling rack on top of the baking sheet and they cooked well without needing to turn them.  I also used Seasoned Salt instead of taco seasoning and loved the flavor.

I made these fries with turkey burgers I found on allrecipes submitted by: Krickett.  I am not a fan of spicy so I eliminated the cayenne pepper and just used the taco seasoning.  These fries were great!  My dinner guest has already asked when I will make them again!

I made these fries last night.  They were delicious!!  I did my own little experiment.  I took the advice of one of the other reviews and used a cooling rack over a baking sheet (greased both) for one batch and used my Pampered Chef bar stone for the other.  By far, the cooling rack method won!! The fries cooked on the stone were burned.  I would recommend sprinkling with brown sugar when they come out of the oven.  I'm planning to make them again tonight.  They made my kitchen smell so good!!!

For a yummy dipping sauce, mix a litle curry powder into ranch dressing.  Perfect complement!

These were a big hit at our house; even one of my pickier children loved this and went back for seconds and thirds!  I peeled my sweet potatoes and cut them into wedges. I used olive oil and instead of taco seasoning, I used Penzey's Cajun Seasoning. I followed the suggestion of a couple different reviewers and raised the oven temp to 425 the second thirty minutes. They were delicious!

4 stars because I technically didn't do the exact recipe.  I added my own spices instead of using a taco seasoning packet and next time I think I may even just coat them with oil and sprinkle with some pepper and kosher salt.  I think I prefer plain and simple with sweet potato fries.  I also agree with reviewers on baking lower at a lower temp (400F) for 40-60 minutes, watching closely starting at 40 minutes to ensure they do not brown.

I'm rating this on method only.  I reduced the oven temp to 400 for about 20 minutes and then raised the oven temp to 425.  Within minutes of raising the oven temp the fries became black on the side that was down.  They were still edible but not very pretty.  If you started them at 425 as written I think they would be ruined.  I will try again with a lower temp (375-400) and then to crisp up I will broil for just a few minutes before serving.

Perfect!  I cut the potato in slices so they are round and then I season with brown sugar on half and chili powder/garlic powder for the other half. I also have to cut down the cooking time and temp. These are great for adults and children!

I feel kind of bad rating this recipe since I really didn't follow it and followed all of the reviewers suggestions instead. I made my own seasoning mix and the family loved them. Thank you so much for the idea though. I'll be making them often now.

Fries that are actually healthy for you - - go figure!  I baked mine on a rake inside my baking sheet at 400 degrees for 35 minutes, flipping 1/2 way.  OK, so they weren't super crispy, but they were not mushy either.  We didn't get too much of the taco seasoning taste so next time, I would add a pinch more.  Delicious.

Excellent!  I have made these several times as written, and like to change up seasonings occasionally.  Much healthier than regular french fries, and tastier too!

Made alot of changes but very tasty!
i gave the original recipe a 4 but my recipe is a 5.  peel potato and par boil because otherwise it's too hard to cut up.  Mix with olive oil, kosher salt, pepper and montreal steak seasoning. Put on foil lined, greased pan in 400 oven for 20 minutes, then reduce to 350 for 20 minutes and then back up to 425 until done. I did this becasue of what i was cooking with it (biscuits) not because it's better...it just worked. be very careful not to burn, check the bottoms and flip.  slice thin.

This was just okay.  I followed the suggestions of others and cooked them at 400 for the first 20 minutes and then 425 another 20 minutes.  They were simply soft baked potato sticks; they only crisped up where they burnt.  I did use cajun seasoning instead of taco and olive oil instead of canola.  So no complaints about the flavor.  They did taste good, but the texture just was not what I anticipated.

Made these because they are obviously healthier than regular fried potatoes, but they turned out a bit mushy.  We tried broiling a bit to crisp up but the smaller pieces just burned.

As per the suggestions of other reviewers,I skipped the taco seasoning and used just kosher salt and cayenne pepper. Although the fried did not get crispy, they were good anyway. I would suggest baking in the middle of the oven, as the ones on the bottom rack burned way before the cooking time was over. A great go-with idea, adapted from a local restaurant is chipotle mayo for a dip. I used about 1/2 cup of mayo and a tsp of dried chipotle chili powder, and it was great for us. Of course, adjust the heat to your own tastes. It really adds something to the sweet potatoes. Now, if only I could find a way to really make them crispy without a deep fryer. Thanks for the inspiration!

very good.  the flavour is just okay, it is quite spicy.  mine cooked in 25 or so minutes.  here is how.  i seasoned the fries and put them in the microwave for about 8 minutes, which was until they were cooked.  then to make them crispy, i put them on the barbecue on a aluminum foil tray and flipped them.  this is a great way to make sweet potato fries QUICKLY! :)

I made these with olive oil, Emeril's Original Essence, and ground sea salt (and baked them a bit lower, at 375/400 degrees) and they were phenomenal -- even my kids and people who didn't like sweet potatoes loved these. Great balance of sweet and spicy, and lots of beta-carotene. Yum!

I give this recipe 5 stars b/c the flavor is awesome! I love the sweet and spicy flavor together. My ONLY complaint is that they came out rather mushy (which I think can be fixed, but need to find the "trick".I wanted them crispy.

Instead of cooking them for 30 minutes on each side I cooked them for 15 minutes on each side.  Eventhough my fries were soft, I can only image how they would taste crispy. I have one large sweet potato left and I'm going to redo them tonight.... can't wait.  I had these with the Actually Delicious Turkey Burgers from this site and it was the perfect combination

Absolutely the best sweet potato fries. Added some seasoning salt after cooking and there were none left. Very kid friendly recipe, even the picky older child ate them.

Like so many other reviewers, mine never got crispy.  Wish I had read the review earlier that mentioned baking sweet potatoes at a higher temp (500) for 30 min. That probably would have worked better than baking at 400-425, as others suggested.  Oh well, still edible!

I add just a touch of cumin, some cyanne pepper, light brown sugar, some cinnamon, and nutmeg, it's really good like this, and yes one hour is WAY too long, I couldn't eat them last time because they where so burnt. :(

These were very good-I peeled and baked the sweet potatoes in a 375 degree oven for 30 minutes and then broiled them, turning them periodically.  I only seasoned with olive oil, salt and pepper and let the kids dip them in sugar free syrup-yum!

I used 4 medium sized potatoes and left out the cayenne (afraid it might be too much for the kids).  I also baked them for about 45 minutes - plenty.  They turned out really yummy!  I will make these again.

These were really good.  I cut them in about 1/4" slices lengthwise and cut them in 1/2 lengthwise, tossed with about 1/2 the packet of taco seasoning.  I didn't use the cayenne and it had just the right amount of spice.  I baked at 425F for 30 minutes, turning after 15 minutes.  They came out soft but not soggy.  Delicious.

I took the advice of other reviews and lowered the temp,reduced cooking time and used less taco seasoning than the original recipe called for.  I wish I had followed the recipe because they weren't at all crispy or spicy.  However, they were still very tasty.  I will make them again, but will follow the original instructions.

These were very tasty with just olive oil drizzled on them and kosher salt as another reviewer suggested.  The cooking time was just right at 400 degrees for the first 20 mins and 425 for an additional 15.  Keep an eye on them as they can burn very quickly.  My son loved them and so did I.

I considered other reviewers suggestions and cooked these 20 mins at 400 and 30 mins at 425. Most of them were crispy around the edges and they tasted wonderful!

These are very good.  The only change I made was to lower the temperature as suggested by others....but still ended up with burnt fries.  So - watch them carefully.  Mine went from ok to burnt in a matter of minutes.  Some were salvageable and were GREAT!  I think I'll try with cinnamon and sugar next time.  Will definately make again.

I agree with other reviewers: a great side dish if you make a few adjustments. I used 3 average sweet potatoes, 1-2 T. oil, 2 T. taco seasoning and the recommended amount of cayenne (1/4 t.). I tried following another reviewer's suggestion to bake at 400 for 20 min., then 425 for about 20 more. They didn't turn out crisp like french fries and were starting to burn, but the flavor was awesome and my husband and I loved them anyway! I will definitely make them again; but next time I will try baking them at a higher temp for a shorter time.

I substituted olive oil for the canola oil and used about half of what the recipe called for.  I did not have taco seasoning, so just used sea salt, pepper and cayenne.  These were a hit with my husband!

This was not a favorite.  They were a bit spicy and did not crisp up all that well.  I will probably make again with a new spice combo.

I also reduced the heat to 400, and used olive oil.  I made up  my own spice mixture as well.  Very yummy alternative to french fries.  Will definitely make again!

Great idea!  I used another's suggestion to roast with oil and cajun spices.  I cubed and tossed the potates (skins on!) with a combo of olive and canola oil and mixed with 2 tbsp. of Louisiana Cajun spice.  Roasted in my cast iron dutch oven (cover on) for 30 minuntes, stirred, then roasted another 15 minutes.  Fantastic side dish to the turkey enchiladas I made!!!!

I used cajun seasoning instead of the taco seasoning. I found that these were starting to get soggy, as other's had experienced.  So, I turned on the broiler for the last 5-10 minutes of cooking.  Watch 'um if you decide to do this, but it really crisped them up and they were a big hit!

try the creole seasoning or cajun

The spices were not evenly spread on the potatoes, and some pieces were burnt, but since I fried mine on the grill, I was expecting a more rustic experience. Perhaps a little flour would help crisp up the outside or perhaps deep frying. That would increase the oil and calorie count. It was nice for something different with sweet potatoes.

Overall, these were good/average but I wish they had been crispier though I used my convection oven. Kids wouldn't touch them. Went well with BBQ sandwiches.

Oh so tasty. I scaled the recipe in half, and did a mix of my own seasoning. I only have two complaints: I only need 30 minutes to cook my fries, and I had them cut like thick steak fries. Secondly, and this is not the recipe's fault, after I cooked them, I wrapped them in aluminum foil to keep them warm while I put something else in the oven, and they got a little soggy. Otherwise, they were good, and my 13 month old thought they were intense, but tasty.

These really were easy to make!  My neice watched me make them and then made them for my dad (her grandpa) a few days later.  We didn't dip them in anything.  Served with turkey burgers for a healthier burger 'n fries dinner.

I cut mine into sticks, sprayed with cooking spray to baked them  then tossed then in butter and sprinkled with cinnamon. Some people also sprinkle sugar, but being on Low Carb just forget the sugar hit.

yummy! I cut the sweet potato very thin and they only took about 30 minutes to get quite brown. They were great to eat. Next time (like tomorrow)  I will cut them quite a bit thicker so they will be even tastier. J.David

For those fries that were not burnt, the flavor was very good but getting all of the fries the right amount of cooking even when all of the fries were exactly the same size was a challenge.  I'll stick to deep frying...

We enjoyed the taco seasoning on the fries.  I checked them after about 30 min and they were already cooked and starting to burn so next time I will use a less hot oven.

I've made these a couple of times already as the recipe calls for except I used  only 3 potatoes . On my 3rd run I again used 3 potatoes and used my left over pork shoulder seasoning and flipped as usual at 20 minutes and broil the last leg, eyeballing to assure I'm not burning em! Always Awesome, especially with the Blackened Salmon from AR ....... Yum!

Pretty good.  I just can't seem to find a recipe where the fries are crispy though.  Anyway, I did what other's did...used olive oil, 400-degrees for 20 min., then flipped them over and 425-degrees for about 10 more min.  My oven is electric and it cooks fast and hot.  I caught them just before they burned.  The flavor was great, I just eyeballed the spices: garlic and onion powders, salt & pepper, cayenne and chili powder.  Just the right amount of spice for us!  I will make these again.

These cooked super fast and burned with in the first 25 minutes. They ones I was able to salvage were delicious, but I would suggest to turn them over after 15-20 minutes.

Good idea, but I prefer to shake then in a bag with olive oil, then a little garlic salt, chili powder, and cayenne to make them spicy.

I didn't have taco seasoning so I made them plain and they were still very good. I must say that the oven was too hot and they scorched on the first side, though they were still edible. I recommend lowering the oven to 200 C and watching them carefully.

Most importantly they do taste great: however, the recipe, in my view is wrong for the following reasons: It calls for 6 potatoes and then the remaining ingredients. I used just 1 large sweet potato and cut the rest of the ingredients by a third which should have been plenty, right? Well it's not even close. You need probably twice as much as recommended to coat the potatoes. Also the oven temperature for the amount of time recommended was wrong. They were beginning to burn after the first 20 minutes so I would turn the temp down to 400 max and watch closely for burning and turn after 20 minutes.

Followed other recommendations to just do olive oil, salt and pepper and basically they were either burnt or ‘ok’.
Threw the recipe out - don’t waste the money or time.

This is by far my most favourtie side. I LOVE sweet potatoes. But i don't like any recipes that call for sugar in any shape or form. Sweet potatoes are sweet enough and with the extra pop of flavour from the Taco seasoning makes this an outstanding side!

This recipe turned out wonderful.  I've been looking for a substitute for white potato fries, and I think I have found it!  I substituted olive oil for the canola oil, and it made the fries crispier.  I also added a dash of cayenne, and used a little bit less taco seasoning than the recipe called for since my husband likes a bit of spice.  It was just right.  This will become a regular item on our family's menu.

Delicious! I had to cook them at 400 F since I was dual-purposing the oven with roasted broccoli.  Definitely make sure you check your fries during those 30 minutes, and mine got a little bit darker than I had anticipated.

I am guilty of not measuring out the taco seasoning... I just sprinkled it onto my fries as I was tossing them in the oil.  So if you're looking for a review that does the recipe to a 'T', this isn't one of those.

Anyway, as a final recommendation.... pair this with sriracha mayo!  Ommgggg...... sooooo good....

I made the sweet potatoe fries recipe because it is traditional to have sweet potatoes with Thanksgiving Dinner. However my family does not like sweet potatoes. Many local restaurants now serve sweet potatoe fries on their menu so I decided to try this and they loved it.

I seasoned these exactly as the recipe states and I found these fries to have a lot of heat. I enjoyed these alongside some sliders. I cooked them at 425° for 15mins, flipped them and cooked them an additional 10minutes, at this point some were starting to burn so I pulled them out. I only used two potatoes and they did not get crispy but they still tasted good. 

Side note: I really struggled with cutting up the sweet potatoes because it's such a solid vegetable and my knives aren't the sharpest. So I peeled them and put them in boiling water for 2 minutes, and then removed them. This made them much easier to cut up.

The first time I tried this recipe I gave it 3 stars, but I made it again today listening to the advice of other reviewers and it was much better.  I didn't add taco seasoning and cayenne pepper.  I added Lawry's Seasoning salt and used olive oil.  Also, last time they burned so I set the timer for 10 minutes at a time and it only took about 30 minutes total.

Make a version of this recipe numerous times and it is a favorite.  We do switch spices on a regular basis according to our moods.  Great recipe that is quick and easy.

If you have a "sensitive" mouth . . . The cayenne in these fries actually actually make them WAY too hot for me!   Next time I would try them with less spice.

These were delicious! But I did not use the taco seasoning, and I cooked them for much shorter time. Mine were done at 40 minutes, but I cooked five minutes longer to make them crunchy and ended up burning quite a few. So next time 40 minutes will be all. I sliced them fairly thin and seasoned with Tony Chachere's, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. They were soooo good.

these were good, but a bit too spicy for our family. I like them better seasoned with Lawry's seasoned salt. also that heat was too high, so the first batch got burned.

I've been making something along this line for a long time and the kids loved them.  I just spritz with olive oil and sprinkle cayenne and cumin.  And I don't cook at quite that high of a temp or as long.

Didn't have any taco seasoning but did have a nice little packet of hot chili seasoning.  No cayenne, gotta buy more but this seasoning was very good.

Awesome!  I love these fries....I don't think I will ever eat plain old fries again. I made them exactly as directed in the recipe except I added another 2 tbsp. of canola oil. Can't wait to make them again. Thank you for this recipe!

I would have given this more stars, except that the consistency was a bit off for me.  Tried to get them nice and crisp on the outside, but inside they were downright mushy.  Any suggestions as to how to alter cooking time to get a better consistency would be appreciated!

Very tasty. I loved the spiciness they had to them. The cook time/temp was way too long for my oven. I burned them after only 15 minutes on my first try. Turn the heat waaay down and let them slowly cook for better, crispier fries.

I don't like sweet potatoes but I thought I might try these to see if I just didn't have a great recipe for them.  I think that they probably tasted ok, but I couldn't get past the texture.  I had trouble getting them to crisp like other reviewers, and they were very mushy.

I would give the original recipe 3 stars but the edited version 4. I cooked the sweet potatoes in the microwave because I was in a time crunch. Then I cut them and seasoned with olive oil, pepper and Lowry's. Then roasted in 425 oven for 30 minutes, turning half way through. They were delicious.

I could not get these crispy enough to my liking without burning them.  I tried this twice (with Red Robin french fry seasoning which was delicious), but both times the fries burned.  1 hour at 400 or 425 is way too long.  If I try this again, it will be at 350 for maybe 40 minutes max.

Burnt Burnt Burnt. I really should have gone with my instinct on this one. It seemed like such high heat and long cooking time. The flavor was REALLY good. I will try this again. However, I will lower the heat and cooking time.

I followed the advice of others and cooked them at the lower temp with just some oil and salt instead of the taco seasoning and cayenne pepper. They came out burnt, mushy and terrible! I made them for my husband who loves everything sweet potato and even he didn't like them. I won't be making these again.

I cut these into fries about 1/4" thick and I could not get them to crisp up. I baked them first at 450 for about 20 min, then put them under the broiler for another 5 min. They started getting black spots and I pulled them out, but they STILL were not crisp. They did have a great flavor, but to get crisp I think I have to fry them in oil next time.

Mine always turn out soggy! I'll turn the temp up but then they burn too quickly. The only way I can think of getting crispy fries is by deep frying them. And I am afraid of deep frying.

I love the idea of these.  I just can't figure out how to crisp them.  I've tried broiling, but even for a short period (2-3 minutes) I end up with burned ends and smooshy insides.  The taste is wonderful, but I really wish I could crisp them up.

good but not sure why we keep rating this recipe because I used the methods discussed below of cutting the sweet potatoes into fries then mixing with olive oil, salt and pepper. I also added a hint of lemon and garlic salt. Delicious result!

These are pretty good.  They don't turn out as crisp as I'd like but I don't think you can get that crispness without deep frying. I add cumin to the mix and leave out the taco seasoning but that's just a personal preference.

Well maybe I did something wrong but I really didn't like how these came out.  The spices tasted nice (I did chili powder, garlic powder, a tiny bit of cinnamon, and salt) but they came out chewy.  The insides were nice and soft but the outsides and especially the skins were tough and chewy.

I only used 4 sweet potatoes and did not measure the oil and used too much so they were oily. Will try again with less. I used a gallon ziploc baggy to pour the oil into and added 1/2 pkg of taco seasoning and poured in some honey. They were delicious but too oily. I will definitely try these again, they are a nice addition to a mexican meal.

This is a great recipe and a tasty alternative to white potato fries. However I found the cooking temperature way too high and my fries almost burned. I think maybe cooking them at 350 for 15 minutes on each side will work out better next time.

I love the cooking method, but used a different seasoning and made my own dipping sauces. They were so yummy they have been requested once a week atleast since I made them a few weeks ago. I love making them because they are much healthier. YUM

I was so hopeful that by trying some of the 'tips' others gave that I could get the crisp I wanted. Flavor was good but like many said, soggy. I'll try again though.

Just ok. Sweet potatoes just don't crisp up when you bake them instead of frying them for fries. They are kind of limp and chewy. Not bad, but probably wouldn't make again.

These were good.  I took a fair bit of review advice and cooked them 20min at 400 then 15m at 450.  This worked well, but they needed to be turned partway as the bottoms were crisping faster than the tops (even on Pampered Chef stoneware!).  2 Tbsp oil was WAY too much.  I'd reduce it by half next time.  Instead of sprinkling salt on the fries, I soaked them in a salt-water bath after cutting (about 2 hours before cooking), and used Mrs. Dash extra-spicy seasoning instead of taco seasoning to keep the sodium down.  Too salty otherwise.

These are really good!  I used salt, pepper, a sprinkle of cayanne, and garlic powder.  Ketchup cooled down the spice (I'm a wimp), and the hubby loved them.  Nice to add something healthy to a hamburger dinner.

I'm giving this four stars for taste. I really liked the taste of these fries (I used Taco Seasoning I from this site). I baked these at 400 for 15 minutes and then 425 for 10 minutes. I had to take them out at that point because they were starting to burn. As a result, hardly any of the fries were crispy - only the skinniest ones got crispy on the slightly burnt ends. I can't imagine how these would have turned out if I'd baked them according to the original recipe, though I'm certain they'd have been crispy.

I really really liked these.  I cooked them 2 ways and found that when I cooked the fries on a pampered chef pizza stone that they cooked faster and were pretty crispy.  I followed the other reviewers suggestions and cooked at 400 for 20 min and then 425 for 20 min.  Only a couple fries burned but otherwise they were perfect.  Loved these!!

I didn't care for these.  They were just more soggy than crispy, which is not how a fry should be.  I followed advice about using less taco seasoning, etc.  The flavor was okay, but they were just soggy.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, if anything. This recipe only gets one star because there's no option for 0 stars and because my husband didn't think they were terrible. They burned right off the bat, but the ones in the middle were sitll mushy. I have a newer, state-of-the-art oven. I followed the directions, even tweaking the temperature a bit at the advice of the other reviewers (making it a bit lower). The seasoning suggestions sounded not the greatest, so I stuck to olive oil, sea salt, pepper, and a pinch of cayenne pepper. The seasoning actually tasted ok, but clashed horribly with the flavor of sweet potatoes. I ended up throwing away the burnt ones, giving my sweet-potato-loving husband the mushy ones, and cooking regular fries for myself and my kids. Not good. I will not make this again.

Delicious! I used the suggestions from the previous users and only seasoned them with salt and pepper. Also I shortened the time and some of the smaller ones still burned so 1 hour is definitely way too long!

I haven't tried the seasoning yet (which I'm sure is delicious), but I'm not convinced by the cooking method. I prepared the sweet potatoes just like the recipe said - oil, 30 min one side, 30 min on the other - and they sure didn't look like the picture. I broiled them for a bit to crisp them up, but they still ended up mostly mushy (and with crispy/burnt tips). I heard a rumour that the secret is to bake them in a coating of egg whites, not oil -I'll be trying that next time with this recipe's seasonings.

I will make this recipe again but with serious modifications. 425 is way too hot; several fries burned before they were completely cooked. 1 hour total cooking time is way too long. The only way the fries can stand that temp for that long is if you cut them into giant steak fries, which isn't what the photo shows. I'll make them again, but try a few modifications mentioned in other reviews. I especially want to try different seasonings even though the taco seasoning was quite good.

Tasty! I've made these several times now. Sometimes I use the taco seasoning, and other times I just sprinkle the fries with salt, fresh cracked pepper, a little cayenne and some garlic powder... it all depends on what I'm serving them with and what I'm in the mood for. Great recipe though, and I'm glad I found a healthier alternative to regular french fries. Thanks for sharing!

I love these fries. Instead of taco seasoning, I used cajon seasoning. They are my new favorite craving!!!!

I give this recipe five stars for the recipe idea, but you do need to change the cooking time, which is why I docked off a star.  1 hour total is too long and will burn your fries.  I tried an hour the first time and had to throw away half of them and then tried 40 minutes (20 on each side) the second time and they came out much better!  Also added extra seasonings as my boyfriend and I prefer it that way.  Very good idea and great with the Turkey Feta Burgers on this site!

Really good, I wrapped the fries in tin foil and did it on the bbq, it cooked for about 40 minutes and turned out really well. I didn't have taco seasoning so I didn't use it.

I did omit the taco seasoning, and just tossed the cut fries in a bowl with just a little olive oil and kosher salt, and then sprinkled lightly with cayenne pepper after placing on the baking sheet.  They turned out very well.

The taco seasoning masked the flavor of the sweet potaoes and some of the seasoning burned.  I love sweet potatoes so I will make these again but will only use salt for seasoning.

I like the idea of baked sweet potato fries, but I had a hard time getting mine to crisp.  Some  burned, and others were still mushy.  I used Sea Salt and Ermil's seasoning instead of the taco seasoning.  I am not sure I will try this again, as I am not patient enough to futz with trying different temp/time combinations.

These were very good. I coated them in canola oil, cajun seasoning and a light sprinkle of sea salt and they were delicious. I did have some burning issues and will experiment to get the right temperature settings.

Yum! I used a Pampered Chef southwestern seasonoing in place of the taco seasoning. I also used olive oil instead of canola...I'm sure either works. I cooked these in a 375 oven for 45 minutes and they were done...check them periodically to make sure they don't burn!

Yummy flavor. I might cut back on the cayenne next time for my kids. DH and I liked the spice! They were a little hard to get crispy...that could have been because I microwaved them briefly before baking to shorten the cooking time.

I served these with veggie burgers and a salad when I had my vegetarian in laws over for supper – they were a hit! Like other reviewers, I too had trouble getting them to the perfect crispy stage. I tried them on stoneware and also on an airbake pan. The airbake pan worked best and I did broil them for a minute or so – this helped crisp some of them up but it also set of my smoke detector! Haha. Definitely have to be careful but they were very tasty served with ranch dressing to dip.

We made these with olive oil and sea salt rather than other spices.  I thought they were a good, fairly healthy way to eat sweet potatoes.  Most everyone liked them, but nobody seemed overly enthusiastic about them.

I had extra sweet potatoes left after thanksgiving, so I made these last night with turkey burgers. We didn't have taco seasoning, so I just used some Lawry's seasoned salt and pepper. They were great and our convection oven made them nice and crispy on the outside.

I have made this recipe several times and it is always a favorite for us.  I did try to increase the amount of Taco seasoning, but quickly found out that a little goes a long way.  I now stick to the original recipe since it's great just the way it is.

I cooked these at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.  I used oil, cornstarch, salt and pepper, tossed everything together on a foil lined pan.  I should have flipped them halfway through but they still were really great.  I used one very large sweet potato and really just eye balled everything.

"Amazing" doesn't even BEGIN to describe how tasty these fries are!  Used black pepper, garlic salt and sea salt instead of taco seasoning, and found that 30 minutes in the oven was enough (although I only used 2 sweet potatoes, so maybe that made a difference on the timing).  I can't wait to make these again!  Great with ketchup.

My fries just didn't get crispy and they were in the oven for at least an hour but they didn't burn and they tasted great, so all was good.  The children loved them and I like that they are getting something good for them.

These were great.  I used olive oil and also cooked them at a lower temperature as suggested in earlier reviews. I served them with baby back ribs and a salad.  They were the perfect compliment.  My husband loved them!

Not sure what I did wrong, but I thought these were gross.  The kid ate them right up and my boyfriend didn't mind them though.  I may try the recipe with regular potatoes and see if that makes a difference.

My husband loves these and asks for them all the time.  I didn't have taco seasoning so I used cumin.  Tasted great to me.  Also, yes they are not too crunchy so I just call them, "FORK FRIES".  No complaints only raves.

My husband and I love sweet potatoes, and this was a nice change from traditional ways of cooking them. The flavor was wonderful but, the cooking temperature was way to high, and way too long. I wished I'd listened to other reviewers and reduced the temperature. There were done and burned at 425 degrees, but there were some that were salvageable. I couln't imagine cooking them for the entire hour at this temp. They were good enough that I would definitely make again, but at a lower temperature and less cooking time.

These were great! I did alter the recipe slightly - I only used 1 large sweet potato, cooked it in the microwave for 2 minutes, used veg oil, salt, pepper, and chili powder, and then baked it at 375 for about 40 minutes. They did burn slightly, but they were still good! If you are making these - don't expect them to be like regular fries. They don't get really crispy, but they were still yum. I will make these again. Thanks!

Yum!  A bit mushy for my tastes, but delicious nonetheless.  We will add to our list of "regulars."

I loved the idea of this when i first came across it, but the required amount of spices didn't give it much flavoring at all.  I only used 2 potatoes as opposed to 3, too.  Just didn't care too much for it overall.

These were okay.  I think part of the problem may be that we don't normally buy sweet potatoes, so the flavour takes some getting used to.  Also, even after following the advice of several reviews and lowering the temperature, some of the fries still burned quite badly.  I may try this again if I'm ever feeling adventurous, but I'm not really in a hurry to try again.

Really good! My young daughters love them - I cut out the cayenne for them and use olive oil, fresh ground lemon pepper a bit of sea salt - yum.

I need to experiment a little bit a little with this recipe before I can say for sure if I'd recommend it or not... I didn't cook them as long as the recipe and a lot my fries burned... I don't think I cut them unusally thin - pretty normal sized fries - but they just burned and didn't crisp up right. The flavor was great though, and I'll fiddle with the time and temperature and try again! :)

These are great!  I used olive oil and sprayed the baking pan and had no trouble with them at all.  I have made these twice now.  I really enjoy them the second day as well.

Pretty good.  I think they could've been spicier, but they burned everyone elses mouths!  I love sweet potato recipe twists, this one's awesome!

I made these and my husband and I enjoyed them.  I liked them more than my husband did, though.  I also reduced the temp. to 400 and the biggest thing about not having them burn is to WATCH them.  Seems like common sense to me.  Anyway, I just shook on some cajun seasoning to part of the batch and all of them turned out very good.  Yes, they weren't as crispy as regular fries but if you like sweet potatoes, you will like this recipe.

Very tasty, however they stuck to the bottom of the pan and I lost the bottoms of all of them when I turned them over.  I also had to turn the heat down because they started to burn.

These were delicious!  I didn't have cayenne pepper, so I omitted it, and they were still very good.  I'll definitely cook these again.

Perfect blend of seasonings! It didn't take me as long to cook though, only about 45 min. They were a hit at dinner!
