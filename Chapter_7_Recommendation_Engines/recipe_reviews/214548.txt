OK, though I don't like reviewing a recipe that I didn't follow exactly, this definitely needed a review so others could see it was tried! I HAD to alter it to what i had on hand: pearled barley already cooked instead of potatoes I added some carrots that needed used. Other than that, followed closely and Marci, YUM!  We went ahead and used the shrimp on hand. Usually, my younger kids do NOT like fish but 2 of 3 ate it, one saying it was delicious. It didn't LOOK really good, but that was probably the barley and the mushrooms we added in. I had expected it more creamy, but it was a mellow creamy texture and not chowdery. Overall, VERY tasty and a forgiving base for alterations. Thank you.

Gave this recipe a try tonight with tilapia and shrimp (what I happened to have), and otherwise followed the recipe exactly but was pretty disappointed with the flavor. The recipe as it stands lacks the nice spice (even with the cayenne) and flavor that I enjoy in a great soup. So I added some Old bay seasoning, lemon pepper, season salt, lemon juice, and a touch of hot sauce (optional). I sprinkled some shredded cheddar on top and served with toasted garlic bread - delicious!

Fast and delicious. Great for a week night dinner. Might add a bay leaf next time. Everybody gobbled it up.

Great flavor!
My changes:  I used bacon drippings (instead of butter) and  smoked paprika.  And I used the fish I had on hand - whiting fillets, no shrimp or shellfish

I love, love, love this recipe. I made it with cod and shrimp and it came out great. More salt is definitely needed and I added a splash of lemon juice. Otherwise, this is a great soup when you don't want something heavy.

This was way to prepare and delicious. The only thing I added was a 1/4 teaspoon more of Cheyenne pepper and salt, and 1/2 lb more fish.

It's a cold day on the east coast and I wanted a quick meal to give to my father after his dialysis using langostinos and left over whiting.  Needless to say, my father loved it! I made it more of a stew than a soup and between my father and my son they ate it up in one afternoon.  It was delicious.

Delicious! I used half the cayenne and it was too spicy for our kiddos, just FYI. I will definitely make this again!

Yum.  This was terrific.  I thought I had an onion but it was starting to go bad so I didn't put any onion in it.  I also used chicken broth instead of
vegetable.  It says 4 servings but my husband and I
ate all of it so if I were making it for 4 adults, I'd double the recipe.  I am giving this one 5 stars.

Super easy and quite tasty.  I used langoustines and hake.  I also added carrots.  Even with the cream, this dish was fairly light.  The garlic was wonderful in it, but I used quite a bit more salt.
