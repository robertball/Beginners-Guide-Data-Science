I just threw everything in the crockpot, raw chicken and all, and cooked on low for 5 hours.  Although I did use 1/2 can pure pumpkin instead and left out the tomatoes, coriander, and cornstarch b/c I didn't have it.  I added 1/2 cup water instead of 1/4 cup.  Added some garlic and cayenne pepper.  So yummy and healthy!

This was a great way to use my leftover pumpkins from Halloween.  I didn't have chicken, so I used pork shoulder instead; also, I cooked this dish overnight on my slow cooker's low setting for 8 hours.  After it cooked, I added a little black pepper to taste.  Otherwise, I followed this recipe and it came out great!  Great flavor and a warm, hearty meal on a cold day.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was worried about the amount of liquid (specifically the lack of) in the beginning but it turned out great. Only thing I will change next time is use less cinnamon because I am sensitive to it. Otherwise, a great dish for a cool Autumn Sunday evening!

This was delicious! I loaded up on tons of extra fresh ginger and simmered it on "low" all day (8 hours). This caused some of the pumpkin to break down and the ginger flavor to be strong but not spicy. I served this for guests and it was a smashing success. I will definitely make this again!!

I made this recipe as stated, and it was delicious.  I used home canned tomatoes, not drained. The only thing I'd change is cut the pumpkin in smaller cubes.  Cutting and peeling the pumpkin was a drag, but worth it.

Also, it's been mentioned people used leftover Halloween pumpkins.  Really, sugar pie pumpkins is what you'd want to cook with for best results.  In a pinch, cubed butternut squash would be a good alternative.

This recipe was AWESOME! The only exception I made was instead of using pumpkin, I used sweet potatoes. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T and it was so declicious. My whole family loved it! A very fall kind of recipe!

This recipe was wonderful!  I could not find a 3-pound pumpkin so I substituted butternut squash. My family asked me to add it to my recipe collection. I would definitely make it again.

Great dish but prep time is WAY more than 30 minutes. Maybe I didn't have a sharp enough knife, but chopping up a pumpkin and squash is much harder than it looks.

Loved this recipe and so did my friend I cooked for.  I substituted a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis plus a couple of roma tomatoes for one of the cans of plain diced tomatoes to add some kick.  I also used a can of pumpkin instead of fresh, and black beans instead of garbanzo.  I added some garlic powder to it as I add that to everything.  This recipe was perfect for this time of year and very easy to make!

This was delicious and not too hard, even for a horrible cook like me. I was not brave enough to attempt to cook a real pumpkin, so I used canned pumpkin based on another reviewer's suggestion, and it was still yummy.

Great recipe. Didn't have any trouble with the water level and the pumpkin was tender and delicious. I added some canned yams to the mix and they blended beautifully.

I made this recipe exactly how you said and it is amazing! Very healthy and filling. It also made the house smell great! The only thing I didn't like was having to peel the pumpkins...I don't have the best peeler so it was a pain, but definitely worth it!

I made it exactly as directed except I did  not have garbanzo beans so I substituted a can of black beans. This is delicious and healthy. I used precut sugar pumpkin so prep time was minimal. Will definitely make this a regular. Thanks!

Just made this dish for my family and they loved it. I took the advice from previous comments. I added garlic, 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp of brown sugar, and I substituted one of the diced tomatoes for a can of green chilies and diced tomatoes for a bit more kick. No added water was needed. I roasted my pumpkin whole in the oven for 45 minutes to an hour. It was much easier to cut in half, take out the seeds, and scoop out the meat of the pumpkin. Since I didn't have much time I cooked this recipe on the stove. It was done in 30 minutes. Very yummy!

This was a delicious meal.  My entire family enjoyed. This recipe was outside the box for us...I've never prepared a pumpkin dish, and so I was skeptical.  My 16, 14 and 8 year olds had seconds, not to mention hubby.  I did things a little differently: I put the boneless dark meat in the crock for about 3 hours before I added the rest b/c a friend was bringing me the tomatoes and pumpkin and hadn't arrived yet. Then I followed others suggestions and added a little less cinnamon and some garlic powder. Also, I didn't have coriander and I halved to olive oil.  I chopped approx. 5 roma tomatoes since I didn't have canned and we live where some sort of green pumpkin/squash (calabasa) is sold in chunks, so I used that instead of orange pumpkin.  The mixture wasn't really soupy, so no need for the cornstarch addition.  I just spooned the mixture into bowls and served with bread on the side.  I would say this recipe could be thrown in the crock in any way, and it wouldn't matter...it would still be delicious in the end.  This is a keeper for us.

My husband and I liked this recipe. I made it per the instructions and put it over quinoa instead of noodles or rice. I will put it over that again in the future. We felt it was missing flavor and that the cinnamon was over powering. I'm not sure what to add, but I will add something in the future and I will reduce the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp or 3/4 tsp. Great use of pumkin and a different spin on goulash!

I made this last night and it was well liked by the whole family.  The only changes I made were using pumpkin puree instead of chunked pumpkin (it is not pumpkin season), left out the sugar and water, and used fresh ground coriander.  I made quinoa cooked in butternut squash soup instead of water.  It may sound weird, but it was delicious.  Besides, this is the only way I can get my husband to eat pumpkin or butternut squash.  ;-)

Loved this! Substituted a can of black beans (including the liquid) for the garbanzo beans, but kept everything else the same. Got rave reviews from family and guests!

Made exactly as described, and we liked it very much.  It reminds me of chili.  I think it would also taste great with a little curry added, so will try that next time.

Delicious! Used extra broth and it came out like a soup. Will follow recipe as is next time.
*Note: The extra broth was nice leftover.

Makes a ton- half recipe in the future.

This recipe was just ok. I didn't bother with the saute pan steps and put it all in the crockpot for 5 hours (1-2 hours were on high). It cooked fine and much easier. Overall, I felt it lacked some flavor, but we definitely ate it.  Not likely something I would make again.

I subbed beef (stew cuts) for chicken, added (2) small, chopped green peppers, fresh basil, fresh bay leaves, fresh sage and doubled the quantity of all herbs and spices.

This is a good recipe. Not great. Just good. It could use a little pizzazz. Maybe some cayenne pepper, or something spicy. It is good for the kids and I an always add my own hot sauce later.
