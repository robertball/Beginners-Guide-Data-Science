I added 1 tablespoon of butter the second time I made it in place of the bacon grease.  Thought the bacon grease gave it an off taste.  I also used the pre-cooked bacon the second time, warming it up for 20-30 seconds.  I took it to a get together and everyone raved about it.

This was pretty tasty, but definitely need to reduce the time in the microwave. Mine was bubbling in less than a minute and the second time in the microwave it started to burn at about two minutes. I'm sure it varies a lot with each microwave.

The recipe can vary greatly with microwave strengths. I have best luck with 3 minutes and then 3more minutes. This recipe is just a little too long for my microwave.

Next time I'll make it the day before so it sets up longer & I won't add the bacon grease because it leaves a greasy flavor in your mouth

Question, because of the bacon, do you store it in the refrigerator?

I used butter instead of bacon grease as some others suggested. The taste is fantastic!  I didn't microwave it long enough (for my microwave) on the first try and it didn't set up properly (it was chewy rather than hard). I put it back in the microwave and re-melted it and let it harden again. I got lucky in that it hardened properly and didn't burn. The microwave method is fast and easy but you give up control over the temperature.

As per another review, I used butter instead of bacon fat and found it gave the brittle another flavour dimension. I also, lightly toasted the pecans first, for a nuttier flavour. Be sure to mix the sugar and corn syrup together, before microwaving it or the sugar may not liquify. Work fast, when spreading it on the parchment.
