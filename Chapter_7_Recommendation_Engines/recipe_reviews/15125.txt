I have been using this same recipe to make my peanut butter fudge except it never told me how high the heat should be for boiling the mixture. It's wonderful tasting fudge but I would always end up scalding the milk on the bottom of the pan and the fudge would end up marbled looking. Hopefully now I'll get my perfect fudge! Thanks!

This turned out great!  It was easy to make and it set up wonderfully! (This is coming from someone who FAILS with fudge all the time!)  I would recommend it to anyone!

This turned out absolutely delicious! I used 2/3 cup evaporated milk instead of regular milk, and added 2 tbsp butter. So smooth and creamy! Will definitely make again.

This is was of the best peanut butter cookies I have ever eaten. I did alter the recipe some . I use 1 cup of dark brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar,1 cup of peanut butter instead of 3/4 cup and butter instead of shortening. Yumm  Yumm!!

Very easy. Sets up well. Fudge develops flavor after completely cooling. Stored in a cool place, the fudge becomes very tasty.

This is as easy as it gets!  This was the first fudge I've ever made and did not expect it to turn out (always thought you had to have a candy thrmometer).  Super creamy and loads of peanutbutter flavor.  My daughter and I couldn't stop eating it!  Need to make a second batch for Christmas!

Great recipe! Been using this for 15 years or more! Everyone loves it. Just remember to remove your pan from the heat when adding the fluff and peanut butter. Also spray your dish with cooking spray you are pouring the fudge into so that it doesn't stick.

Very very good. Everyone just remember to count the 2 1/2 - 3 min once it starts boiling. Then count till smooth and then mix in Marsh. & P.B. till starting to thicken and become smooth then put in dish and cool.

Best peanut butter fudge ever!  The marshmallow creme really makes the recipe.  I even place extra in my freezer and pull out a piece at a time when my sweet tooth kicks into high gear. **Update** This was one of the first recipes I tried after finding Allrecipes.com. Everyone loves it. I shared this recipe when attending a "recipe exchange" bridal shower for a bride who claims she cannot cook. Now she makes this for gatherings and is always complimented. An easy recipe that can make anyone feel like a cook.

I really wanted to make peanut butter fudge for my boyfriend for Valentine's day. I tried a different recipe and scorched the sugar pretty fast so I was worried about being successful at all. I tried this recipe and was amazed at how super EASY it was! And before the mixture completely set up I was able to mold and form it to cut out heart shapes with cookie cutters. This recipe is awesome and the peanut butter flavor is perfect. Not too sweet which is also a plus! Try this recipe!!

This is the easiest recipe!  I had no marshmallow creme, so I used miniture marshmallows.  After I boiled the sugar and milk for 3 min. I added about 2 1/2 cups of miniture marshmallows and the peanut butter.  It was so smooth and creamy, I just love it.  Thanx a bunch, this is one recipe I'll use again.

This is by far the best peanut butter fudge recipe I have tried. It is very soft in consistency and doesn't always look pretty, but the taste...AMAZING! People request this from me every Christmas. I have made this recipe for at least the last 3 years.

Oh my my my son made this and is so GOOD!!!! Hard to be patient for 3 minutes because the time is to short not to stir it and go do something else, but well worth it. The Peanut Butter bomb. (Washing measuring cups not too fun. but worth this also.)

Delish!  I put in 1 1/2 c. peanut butter, but kept everything else the same.  Set up perfectly and was firm to the touch and melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Easiest fudge recipe I've made, and just as good as the hard ones.  Husband is a huge peanut butter fan and thought this was fantastic, too.  As easy as it was, I can imagine doing all sorts of fun things with it.  Let it chill in the fridge and then cut into tiny squares and dip in chocolate.  Set and serve as PB-choco candy.  Pour fudge out into graham-cracker-crush-lined baking pan to 1/2" thickness, let firm up, then coat in thin layer of chocolate and crushed peanuts and serve as PB-choco candy version 2.  It's just such an easy recipe to work with, and clean up was a snap, too.  Thanks so much!

The flavor is very good, but it is not the consistany I was hoping for, having a hard time cutting it into squares without bringing most of the other pieces with it. I just stuck in the fridge to see if that helps.
If I try this again, perhaps I will cut down a bit on the amount of milk.

I love this recipe, we use it every year, fast and easy.  It is more of a peanut butter candy than fudge.  It is always one of the first to go on the cookie platters.

'Saw how simple and knew I had the ingredients so I headed to the kitchen...so simple and YUM! I never have whole milk so I used 1/4 c. evap. milk w/ 1/4 water. Used 1 creamy P-nut butter and 1/3 crunchy natural. Creamy and setting up nicely. Oh...and I used 8x8 (don't have 9x9) 'Will be a great gift for Christmas giving.

This Recipe was delicious and set up just fine. I did add a 1 tsp of vanilla and I used a cast iron pot. I find the cast iron pot distributes the heat better. Delicious and easy! Thanks.

Easy, Easy, Easy!!!  It would be really hard to mess this one up.  I have tried many different peanut butter fudge recipes and this one works the best for me.  The recipe and directions are clear, concise and easy to follow...the results are wonderful!!

Super easy and super good.  Doubled the recipe by exactly doubling the milk, then using a whole jar of peanutbutter, (slightly more than the recipe called for), and 16 oz of marshmallow fluff (Used the marshmallow fluff with the red lid).  Turned out creamy and perfect.

Easy to make yes. Good peanut butter fudge. NO. I followed the recipe to the letter at first, but as I was mixing it. I noticed the color was almost white. What kind of peanut butter fudge is white? I took a quick taste and realized that it barely tasted like peanut butter. It was more like marshmallow with a very slight hint of PB. I ended up addinG ALOT MORE peanut butter just to get the slightest taste of peanut butter in the final product.

It WAS quick. It DID set up good and it was not bad for a quick "candy type" treat. Mine was not "taffy like" as others have said but I think it's because I added so much extra peanut butter. It is not creamy, it was more sugary and the color was way off. I have made "quick, no mistake fudge" type fudges before and everytime I make a peanut butter one it actually LOOKS the color of peanut butter and is smooth and creamy.

I will not make this again. It was definitely NOT fudge. Candy, yes, FUDGE, no. As a "candy" it's not bad. I should add that it did all get eaten in my house, but everyone who ate it said it's definitely NOT fudge. One reviewer mentioned using evaporated milk instead of regular milk. That would probably definitely help with the smoothness of this candy as most good fudge recipes call for evaporated or condensed milk, even the ones that use fluff. Anyone who has never made real fudge before though would not know this. Anyone looking for a true fudge recipe, this is not it.

I give this recipe 3 stars only because it wa

This was the first time I made fudge and it turned out great.  I added 3/4 cup of peanuts and used crunchy peanut butter to make it even more peanuttier.  Next time I will double the recipe for a 9x13 pan and use 2 cups of peanuts.

I changed the recipe  to 1 cup of marshmallow creme and boil for 5 minutes.  Came out perfect!  Make sure to have your marshmallow and pb  measured ahead of time because it will set fast.

I just made this a few minutes ago and it turned out wonderful! I did tweak the recipe just a tad though: I omitted the marshmallow cream (didn't have any), added a tablespoon of butter, and added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. It has been a while since I last made fudge and I was so glad to have found this recipe because it is very similar to the one I used to use years ago. I will definitely be making this again.

The taste was very nice delicious even! However it just did not stiffen up. Even after hours of refrigeration. It was a great flavor, but for me it was more of a super sweet peanut butter goop. Not fudge. Although it may not have been your recipe it could have been a mistake that  i made... I don't know it just did not have a fudge texture

My husband thought this was good, but not peanut butter-y enough for him. Didn't stop him from eating half of the batch in one night and getting a bellyache. I used Skippy super-chunk and had no issues. It was easy, I'll admit.

I like the recipe because it is easy and because it doesn't have that many ingredients or steps... it's fast and easy.  However, I think it needed a more peanut-buttery taste.  I will add more pb next time I make it.

I've never made or eaten PB Fudge, so I'm not certain how it turned out.  It has a good taste, and just a bit crumbly.  I used crunchy PB.  I think I'll try another recipe next time & compare.

This fudge is great. Friends and family loved it. It was easy to make. I like the texture of it, smooth, a little crumbly..I don't like pb fudge that is sticky. It reminded me of my Grandmothers fudge. I will definitely make more over the Holidays!

WOW!!! The best thing about this recipe is that in less than 10 minutes you will be satisfying that peanut butter craving (though it will still be warm.)  It is super easy and, for me anyway, it is stuff that you already have in your cabinet (I used 2.5 cups of mini marshmallows because that is what i had).  I also mixed in 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips at the very end and just barely stired them so there was a ribbon of chocolate. Delicious!  I made a half recipe because I wasn't sure if my fam would like it.  It was gone after an hour.  Thank you for an easy and delicious recipe.

This is the first fudge recipe that actually worked for me!  I kept to the specified time for cooking/boiling and it was very accurate.  I also used 2 1/2 cups mini marshmellows as a substitute.  Very quick and little ingredients.  Great recipe, will definitely make again.

This fudge was very easy to make.  I was afraid that I would over cook it and it would become brittle and dry, so I didn't cook it for quite 3 minutes.  I was worried when it was taking a long time to "set up" while cooling, but it turned out very creamy and yummy!  Will make again!

I tried this recipe as an alternative to the one I usually make, because I was out of evaporated milk. I made it exactly as specified.  Though it tastes fine, the appearance is not smooth and glossy, the way I like.  This fudge is also a bit crumbly.  I won't use it this recipe again.

I'm not sure....I boiled for exactly 3 minutes on med-high & it was very hard to stir & get out of the pan. The top was raggedy- I pressed down on it with some Pam-sprayed wax paper. I guess my heat was too high or I boiled it too long. That said, everyone is eating it with no complaints- although it is somewhat crumbly. I guess next time I will lower the temp to med & maybe boil for less time.

I don't normally rate or review recipes on here, but after making this the last time I decided I should.  This is a great fudge recipe for beginners. I love to bake but rarely make candy because I usually mess it somehow and it never sets.  This is a no fail recipe, and it's great not having to use a candy thermometer! The last time I made it I was doubling the batch so my husband could take it to work.  I did so many things "wrong" and it still tasted like I'm a pro! I accidentally let the sugar boil too long.  I added the marshmallow creme and realized my pot wasn't big enough (duh) so I switched to a bigger one right in the middle of making.  I added my peanut butter much later than I probably should have. Still, this fudge set perfectly and even more important tasted great!  Try this recipe.  You won't regret it!

I have been craving peanut butter fudge, and this fudge filled the bill!
However, I did tweak it a little.. I cooked the sugar and cream (2/3 cup instead of milk) about 3 1/2 minutes (or until, when a small amount of the mixture is dropped into a cup of water, it forms a soft ball). I also added a tablespoon of margarine after adding the peanut butter and marshmallows (I used a cup full of whole marshmallows)and then a teaspoon of vanilla.. Tastes great.. I just finished making the fudge, and it has already set up..:)

Made this recipe exactly as stated, and thought it was wonderful.  Have made this twice and taken it to work, and got raves from everybody and also was asked for the recipe.  This will be my "go-to" recipe from now on....I even think this rivals my Mom's recipe - and I've always thought hers was the best, but I just couldn't get her recipe to turn out well.

Great recipe! i added a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the fluff and peanut butter. I also blend the fluff , peanut butter and vanilla  in a bowl before i add it to the sugar mixture so i can get it all in faster. i also lined my pan with plastic wrap for easier clean up.

I took this recipe to a summer bbq when someone asked for a peanut butter dessert.Everyone enjoyed it so much and said it was the best fudge they ever had!  The only change I made was to drizzle the top of the finished fudge with chocolate.  Thanks for the recipe!

Super easy and delish!  I made it with soy nut butter (peanut butter substitute) and ricemellow creme (marshmallow fluff substitute)  and it turned out perfect.  I even threw some carob chips on top.  I know all strange ingredients but we are a highly allergic family.

This is an amazing recipe! I've never been very good at fudge and didn't have any condenced or evaporated milk, so it worked out perfectly! I added about a cup of chocolate chips to the mix during boiling, as well as added a handfull of mini-marshmellows since I only had about 1/2 a Jar of creme to use. They seem to be setting very well and my kids are anxious to try them! Very happy with this recipe! Thanx!

I liked this and felt it was very easy.  However, I did have some problems with the mixture scorching a bit on the bottom of the pan and giving the fudge a marbled look.  Maybe my cooktop is too hot and I need to turn down the heat a bit once it starts boiling.  This was REALLY sweet so small pieces were in order.

This fudge is so good and so quick and easy to make. My husband and 20 male co-workers loved it when he brought it into work the other day. I have made this 3 times in the past two weeks for my husband to take to work and he says that is does not last long. Everyone tells him how good it is, best fudge they have ever had. I will make this every year for my husband and friends along with Aunt Teen's Creamy Chocolate Fudge by Kelly Phillips. Thanks to Kelly and Myra, Debra

This recipe was easy and quite tasty! It has a wonderful peanut butter flavor. I had marshmallows but didn't have marshmallow fluff so I melted the marshmallows and it worked just fine. I will definitely make this again :)

It tastes good but came out like carmel. So instead of having peanut butter fudge I made the most of it and rolled them in Wax paper and made them into Peanut Butter chews. Still tasty though but just not like fidge. I must have did something wrong. Maybe I need to grease the dish of maybe there needs to be more of something? I brought to a boil for only 3 minutes and stirred in my mallo and PB..meh. Should be called peanut butter chews.

I have never made fudge of any kind before. This was very simple to make. I made it exactly as directions indicated and it turned out with a smooth texture and solidified well. I really like the fact that this did not turn out unbearably sweet. I used natural peanut butter and I thinked that helped to give this really good peanut flavor.

This recipe was easy to follow and set very easily. I have had difficulty getting peanut butter fudge to set in the past but this was simple and no candy thermometer required. Will definitely use again.

PERFECT!!! Soooo quick if you need something in a hurry this is the recipe for you,I made a few subtle cahnges I added 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter to make it more rich and the recipe said to boil for three minutes and I started the three minutes when my sugar and milk started to boil(some people may start their time when they first put them on the stove)But overall it was very tasty and creamy and I will be using this recipe alot!!!

Very easy to make, minimum ingredients needed.  I had all these on hand and made it in no time.  Very sweet.  Made me want a big glass of cold milk to go with them.  Will definitely make again.

This was a really creamy fudge! I stirred in 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips at the very end and that made it tast like a creamy, decadent reese cup. I like that the fudge was not too hard, nor too soft. It was just right!

Great recipe.  Very easy, followed directions, started timer when boiling began and it turned out perfect!  My kids ate half the pan as soon as it was ready!  I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk.

Great recipe and really tastey! If you use splenda don't use it for this  recipe. It dissolves quickly and if you don't watch it will burn. I tried the peanut butter but made chocolate too and used Baker's baking chocolate. Really good!

This recipe is great. It tastes a lot like a scotcheroos. I'm not sure how everyone else's turned out, but mine was a little soft. Not soft enough to be a problem though... or to stop me from eating it! I would highly reccommend it!

Wonderful! My husband was skeptical when I said I was making peanut butter fudge using ACTUAL peanut butter instead of chips. But he liked it too! I used about 1 3/4 cups of sugar, and maybe 1 cup of smooth PB and 1/2 cup of chunky PB. The nuts added a nice crunch to it. :) It turned out perfect! Thanks for an awesome, and easy, recipe!

On my gas cooktop 3 minutes was way too long; could hardly get it out of the pot.  Flavor was good and would like to try again if someone could give me a temperature to boil to instead of minutes....?

Good flavor, but I don't think three minutes of boiling was long enough.  It didn't set well at all, stayed very very soft.  But it did taste great.  Next time I think I will use a candy thermometer instead of just timing it.

This was a HIT at my friend’s Christmas Eve potluck!! So easy and delicious that there wasn’t any leftovers!! I did make a substitute because I didn’t have white sugar..I used 2 c light brown sugar (what I had on hand) and added extra 1/3 c peanut butter and BOY OH BOY it was devoured! Made another batch for Christmas Day! So yummy!!!

Some people prefer a more crumble type fudge, this one is very soft and creamy. I like both types. I make this recipe a lot. I love peanut butter so I actually add two cups of peanut butter. It doesn't change the way it comes out. It's very delicious!

I used 35 marshmallows instead of marshmallow cream.  I added them after boiling the sugar.  Melted them into the sugar on low heat and then added the peanut butter.

The flavor was pretty good but the fudge was not creamy. It was fairly hard and crumbled a bit. I timed the 3 minutes exactly.

Great recipe! A pinch of salt if your peanut butter is unsalted though, and marshmallows can be substituted for the marshmallow cream!

Super easy for my teenagers to make for Father's Day.  We sprinkled some choc chips on top after pouring in the glass dish.  When they melted spread with a knife across the whole top. Yum!

Tried this because of the reviews. Lost my recipe. Doubled it as I needed it for a bake sale. Put it in the fridge overnight because after an hour it wasn't setting. Big gooey mess when I tried to divide it up into bags for sale. Luckily I had some mini loaf liners
to put it on or I would have chucked the whole thing. Will probably have to buy it back. Will look harder to find my original.

this recipe is just like she said. easy to make in a few minutes. What i did different was at the last minute before putting the fudge in the pan is to add a cup of chocolate chips. the heat will melt them just a little so they form swirls in the fudge. If you keep the fudge refrigerated, the fudge will have chunks of hard yummy chocolate! Its delicious!!! I feel like im gonna get fat because i cant put it down!

Substituted evaporated milk for whole milk. Didn't measure the marshmallow creme so I maybe had a little more than 7 oz because I used about 1/2 of a 16 oz. jar. It was a huge success! Everyone raved about it! And it was so quick and easy!

A great fudge recipe but I changed it just a little. I added 2 Tbls butter to the sugar and milk, then 1/2 tsp vanilla with the peanut butter and marshmallow creme. I constantly stirred before and while it was boiling to prevent scorching. It turned out really creamy and yummy. I couldn't find my old recipe but this will definitely be my favorite!

I used this as the filling for Chocolate covered peanut butter balls, along with Ghirardelli Candy Chocolate.  Everyone raved over them.  I did freeze the peanut butter balls for 20 minutes prior to dipping them in the melted chocolate.

I made this along with a assortment of cookies for the family holiday gathering. It was a big hit and I would make it again. This will be a new addition to my recipe box. I followed the recipe exactly as stated and it turned out perfect. I used creamy peanut butter as a number of family members perfer creamy. For myself, I would have used crunchy, but either way it's just plain good and easy to make.

Sinfully yummy and easy! Melts in the mouth! It is a bit soft, but considering the ingredients- that is a given.  If I want to firm it up next time I'll add a bit of chocolate.

After the birth of one of my children, a friend brought a plate of this fudge over. I asked for the recipe...and, this was it!

Smooth, creamy and EASY! The peanut butter flavor is pretty mild, but absolutely rich and delicious! Yum Yum YUM! :-)

Wow, this recipe is great. My first time making peanut butter fudge and I am impressed. I used Peter Pan Peanut Butter just cause I'm a big fan of it. I was looking for a real peanut buttery tasting recipe and this hit the spot! Thanks for sharing, it's a keeper at my house.

Everyone really loved this fudge and it was so quick and easy to make.  I took it to my bridge club Christmas party and it was a big hit.  I'll definitely make it again.

Tastes delicious, but I gave it 3 stars because when I followed the recipe exactly, my fudge was runny and did not set up, even after being refrigerated.

Easy to make but not my favorite. I have tasted a lot better Peanut Butter Fudge then this one. I think it was because more marshmellowey then peanut butter taste.

I liked the taste, but the fudge was grainy. I followed recipe, but I add vanilla flavoring maybe that is what it was. Next time I'll leave out the flavoring. The trouble was me, sometimes fudge turns out for me other times it doesn't.

This recipe is a very easy recipe to follow. I've made this 2 times! The first time I cooked it about 30 seconds too long (on a gas stove) and it took too long to stir in the ingredients...  The second time I had everything waiting so i just threw it in immediately (as it says) after I turned off the heat! I have ruined fudge in the past! Very simple and cost efficient to make! Husband loved it! Will make for Christmas baskets!

This fudge has great taste but like someone else commented, mine was also like taffy consistency. Like i said, the taste of it was on point but was too messy and taffy-like to eat.I'd really like to have an easy peanut butter fudge recipe so If anyone can tell me what i may have done wrong i'd appreciate it! shelettm@yahoo.com

I went through dozens of fudge recipes looking for one that seemed the easiest, and tried this one. All I can say is WOW! This is really delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great....even if, in truth, I didn't wait for it to cool totally before trying it. I'll be making this one again.

I am rating this a 4  because I don't know if it was me or the recipe.  So many people have raved about it but mine has a rough texture and was hard to get out of the pain as others have stated. I have a gas stove so maybe this heat was too high. I may try a recipe that has butter in it next time because my chocolate fudge came out beautifully!

So easy to make and delicious! I've never even made fudge before and it came out perfectly. I took someone's suggestion and used a 9 X 13 pan as well. My best friend ( a real foodie) loved it and made me give her some to take home right then!

Great recipe.  It was easy to make and delicious.  After I poured the mixture into my pan (I used 8x8), I added peanut butter chips to the top.  A great treat!

This recipe has opened my eyes to a new kind of fudge. This is not a gooey-type confection as I had hoped. Instead, it is silky and it melts in your mouth! I have a candy thermometer, and cooked the milk and sugar to exactly 240, (soft ball stage) which was for me about 3 1/2 min. As I was adding the marshmallow fluff and peanut butter, the mixture began to stiffen up a lot, which worried me. It had a crumbly texture, and I thought I had messed it up. I patted the fudge into my greased 9x14 pan (I made a double batch) and let it cool completely befre cutting it into tiny squares. i wouldn't even call the candy "fudge" as the results weren't, well, "fudgy". But it is a nice tasting candy with big peanut butter flavor. Can't eat too many without getting a tummy ache!

This is the first time I've made fudge and I absolutely love this recipe.  I wasn't sure about timing the fudge instead of doing it by temperature, but I couldn't find a candy thermometer.  I made sure to bring the milk and sugar to a boil before starting the timer.  And then stirred the milk and sugar continuously.  Mixed the peanut butter completely and then the marshmallow creame.  I lined a 8x8 pan with wax paper. Poured the fudge in and let it cool for about three hours before I cut and it was wonderful.

Made this with my kids.  I altered it and made half peanut butter and half chocolate and layered it.  Taste great!
