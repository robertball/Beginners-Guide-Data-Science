This tasted great; however, next time I will double or even triple the sauce mixture so I will have enough left over to spoon over rice or noodles.  Unfortunately, there was no sauce left over after I basted the chicken with it.  My five year old loved the chicken when he finally sat down to eat it, but he complained the entire time it was cooking that it "stunk."  The end product was very good, however, and I will definitely make it again!

Not enough sauce to baste the chicken.  I followed the directions carefully and the sauce immediately reduced down in the pan. The crackers on the chicken all fell off while cooking and stuck to the bottom of the pan burning along with the sauce.  Nice idea the recipe sounded good but you will definately need to triple or quadruple the sauce recipe.

I thought this was delicious.. It gets 5 stars for flavor but the recipe needs some adjustments.  As everyone else has mentioned... not enough sauce... 3-5 times needed.  Also, browning this then dipping in crumbs and then brushing with sauce, results in the bread crumbs being smeared off into the sauce...  I tried it the way the recipe stated even though I was pretty sure this would happen... better idea.. dredge raw breasts in crumbs, brown and then lightly spoon sauce over top.

This had a very good taste to it. I really liked It, however I agree with the other reviewers, I just could get the amount of the sauce right. I doubled it, but still didn't seem to be enough. Next time I'll triple it or quadruple it. I recommend this.
