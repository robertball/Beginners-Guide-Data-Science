Wow!  Amazing!  Having worked at the OG I made a few minute changes.  I added 1 tbs of crushed red pepper, salt & pepper to taste, a little cornstarch and water to thicken it up, mashed a few of the potatoes, and added freshly grated parmesan cheese. (Though I like my toscana a little thick, I don't recommend this if you like it thin.)

This soup is awesome but only 4 stars for me because it should be made with spicy ground sausage, it should have a lot more potatoes, and the broth is a little thin compared to OG's.  I worked at OG for a long time and the kale is added when the pan is refilled and served immediately.  The longer it sits, the more the kale softens up, but most days it doesn't get to sit for very long.  Next time I will add more potatoes and try to figure out how to thicken it just a bit more, maybe whisk a little cornstarch into the broth before adding other ingredients.  Oh yeah, I tripled this recipe and used 2 packages of ground sausage, 1 lb. each, and I used all chicken broth, taste was wonderful!!!

I Really loved this recipe.  I used to work at the OG for quite some time and this recipe is easy to follow and tastes even better than theirs!  I just used crumbled sausage, added red pepper flakes and more potatoes and kale.

Very good approximation of the Olive Garden recipe, with the exception that I used bulk italian sausage instead of pork sausage links.  I also took the advice of the other reviewer, added red pepper flakes, salt and pepper, and a little corn starch for thickening.  I also used 2 C chicken broth and 2 C water instead of the 2 T chicken broth and 4 C water.  I also used 1/2 C cream instead of 1/3.

I didn't have enough italian sausage on hand so I added chicken and it was amazingly good!  My daughter said it was her favorite soup and evn my husband, who hates anything green, raved about how good it was.  I garnished it with fresh parmesean and diced tomato and served with crusty bread.  Will be making this soup again and again, thanks for sharing!!

This recipe must have an error; 2 TB. chicken broth? I think it should say CHICKEN BASE! That's what I used. I used 1 pound ground hot sausage, drained. I have even doubled the recipe and 1 pound of sausage was fine too. I have started steaming the kale (I like extra) separately to get my perfect texture (pile ripped leaves in pot, add 1 inch water, and steam until tender but still somewhat firm). A bit less water suits me better too. This was very good, thanks =)

I gave it a 4 star as written but with these adjustments it is definitely a 5 star. The one thing that is missing from this recipe is bacon. Instead of using vegetable oil to cook the onions in, use 2 strips of bacon cut up in small pieces. I used 2 large cloves of garlic and 3 potatoes. I removed the sausage from its casing, broke it up and browned in skillet. I then drained it and added 1/2 cup flour to the sausage and mixed it up until the flour is invisible. I used chicken broth instead of the base and water and I added 1 tablespoon crushed red pepper. Amazing!!

At the end, the soup is very hearty.  I think I would have preferred less "stuff" in it to resemble the restaurant soup, but that's a matter of taste.

I tried using the pork sausage and crumbled it instead of using sliced sausage.  That made the soup too greasy.  On a second round, I drained the grease first before adding it to the soup.

Otherwise, very tasty.  I love the potato/sausage/kale combination.  I will definitely make it again.

Excellent Soup - My changes were the following:  Used 1 Box (4 c) Chicken Broth instead of water and soup base; 1 pkg Mild Italian Sausage Links (casings removed) instead of sliced sausage links; 1 pkg spinach instead of Kale.  This was fast, easy, tasty and hit the spot!  Will double the recipe in the future--it was gone too fast!  This is a keeper!

Finally, a kale recipe we love! Like many other reviews, I doubled the amount of potatoes. I didn’t add the cream to the pot, I finished the soup in the bowl with heavy cream and a poof of parmigiano reggiano cheese. This soup keeps for several days and re-heats fine if you don’t add the cream to the pot, but at finishing. Note for kale novices: be sure to cut away the woody stem and only use the leaves.

Will definitely be sharing this recipe with my family! I did a few changes, but overall this recipe is phenominal. The changes I made: I used 1 pkg. of Johnsonville Hot Italian Sausage brots and cut them into slices and instead of using any water - I used 3 cups of Swanson's Chicken broth, and definitely double the potatoes! At the end, I mixed 1 Tbsp. with 1/2 Tbsp. of cold Swanson's Chicken Broth to thicken it a bit. Also added the kale at the very end, turned off the burner and added the heavy cream and served with garlic bread and salad - very very great!!!

This is one of the best soups! I used "Bob Evans" sausage  and browned and chopped into small chunks while cooking. Removed sausage and added 1 T. olive oil,  browned onions until translucent, then added garlic for 1 minute...added 1 box/32 oz. of prepared chicken soup broth   1 heaping Tablesp. chicken base, 1 teaspoon dried oregano leaves, 1 even tablespoon "Mrs. Dash" Italian blend seasoning , shake of ground black pepper, 4 large diced potatoes. Simmered that for 15 minutes ,and transfered to crock pot along with..2 cups water, and sausage..... continued to cook until potatoes were done. Skimmed top to remove grease with a grease skimmer.Then added evaporated milk and frozen spinach (that I drained well and squeezed dry between paper towels), and 1 cup jarred button mushrooms quartered....  and cooked for 1 more hour on low. One of the best soups!!!!!!!!Thanks

I found this soup quite bland. If I ever make it again I will make it with chicken broth and not water, in order to add some flavour. I used some of the tips that people suggested but it only made a small difference.

The best use for kale I've found. Wow! This soup is so good that even my DH who hates green stuff likes it. I have made this twice in a week. I used 4 small potatoes, 4 large Johnsonville sausages, and about 2/3 cup heavy cream with 2 tsp cornstarch mixed in it to thicken it up a bit. I also added about 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes because I like things a little spicy.

A good hearty soup.  Great with some crust rolls.  Made some changes based on some suggestions here.  I used ground Italian Sausage, a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and an 1 extra potatoe.  I used light cream and whisked 1 tablespoon of corn starch into it to thicken up the soup.  I will make this again.

Great soup!  Very easy and lots of flavor.  I made some changes to the recipe. I added more of the potatoes and Kale than called for, about twice the amount.  I also did not use sausage links, used regular pork sausage, a 16 oz. roll, and cooked before adding it to the soup, very good. I used chicken broth instead of the water and soup base.  Because I used more potatoes, sausage and kale I had to use more liquid also.  Probably about 7 cups of broth and a cup of heavy cream.  The soup was very yummy!!!

This soup was great-tasting.  I did not have heavy cream, so I used a 'milk and butter' substitute instead.  Will be making this again!

This soup is delicious. It is different than Olive Garden, as it is more thicker and meatier. Actually, going to cut down on the meat next time I make it. I added extra potatoes & extra kale. I also added an extra chicken boullion cube. I added a little instant potatoes to thicken up the soup just a little. But, overall - hearty, wonderful, and delicous soup with a kick to it!

I've made this soup and it is identical, if not better, than the one you get at the big famous restaurant (wink, wink).  I add a bit more pepper flakes though as I like a bit more kick.

This was a great soup recipe for those cold winter nights. I took a few other reviews into consideration and added a couple of teaspoons of crushed red pepper flakes. I also added a pinch of white pepper and instead of the sausage links I used spicy ground pork sausage instead of links, I would recommend using the ground sausage!!! Delish!! Thanks for the recipe.

I give this recipe 5 stars, only with a few alterations. First, I used more chicken broth than water. I only used two cups of water and I didn't measure the broth, but I'm sure it was more than four cups. Once I had the broth/water mix boiling with the onions, garlic, and potatoes, it was very bland, so I seasoned it with seasoning salt and pepper. I boiled the potatoes in the broth for about 35 minutes (15 minutes was not long enough to make the potatoes soft). I used 1/2 more heavy cream than the recipe called for. I also used Mexican Chorizo sausage instead of spicy pork, and spinach instead of kale. My family was very pleased with the outcome. It is now a favorite soup, and the first I've ever made.

I havent tried this particular recipe but if you want it to taste more like OG's zuppa toscana, you must finish with 1-2 tablespoons of balsalmic vinegar and a capful to taste of vanilla flavoring. Thats how you get the unique flavor that OG achieves with their zuppa toscana. The sausage should be hot italian (well drained) You would also want to add about a cup of chopped celery to the onion for a more flavorful broth. Just made it again for Holiday potluck and as always, it gets rave reviews and everyone's like, OMG, this is just like that soup at OG!! For reference, you can go to the food network website and review Aunt Jojo's Politically incorrect sausage and potato soup. Just add kale and cut back on the  excessive amount of cream used in that recipe and there you have it.

Delicious!  I doubled the potatoes and kale, and substituted 1 can evaporated milk for the cream.  I also used 1/2 of a smoked sausage diced for the meat.  It was very easy and VERY tasty!  We'll make this again!

I have made this several times. I add a lot more seasoning and chicken broth for flavor. I don't care for the flavor of Italian sausage so I use regular Jimmy Dean sausage for the meat. This is a great recipe for kale.

This is a good starting point for a recipe with kale.  I had 4 cups of kale, so I used 6 cups of chicken stock, 2 lbs potatoes, and 2 lbs of italian sausage.  I would recommend using: 2 cups of stock: 1 cup of Kale: 1/2 lb of sausage: 1/2 lb potatoes next time.  I would also take the onion, garlic, stock and half the potatoes and blend it to make a base.  This leaves you with a thicker base and will help to feature the kale.

This is really good, except I don't use the spicy sausage, just regular Bob Evan's Original sausage. Hubby adds red pepper seeds to spice his up a little. Other than that, we LOVE this recipe!

My husband loved this! I think it could use a little more cream. The chicken base is key. I've made versions of this soup with and without it and that is the trick to getting the Olive Garden taste. I panfried my sausage after removing it from the casing and I did not slice it (crumbled it instead).

Made this last night, it's my husband's favorite soup at OG. It was soooooo good that even my kids wanted seconds, which in itself says A LOT! I did use Jimmy Dean Spicy ground pork sausage instead of the links, as I don't like dealing with the casings. I cooked it on the stove and put it in a strainer while the soup was cooking. I like the kale softer, so I let it cook a bit longer. It was perfect. NOTE: The spicy sausage and chicken base give it TONS of flavor, so don't be tempted to add any other seasoning!

Similar to Olive Garden's Zuppa.  I used turkey sausage, making it bulk & added crushed pepper seeds.  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

The store was out of kale, so I just used spinach.  I used low-sodium chicken broth for all the liquid (instead of broth and water) and I also used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream, to keep it healthier.  Absolutely deelish!!

I stuck as close as possible to this recipe based on the ingredients I had on hand. It was 5pm and I had nothing defrosted for dinner so I made this last minute and did not have very high expectations for it. Boy was I wrong!! For such simple ingredients, this soup was bursting with flavor. So delicious! I don't think five stars is enough.  We don't eat pork, so I substituted spicy vegetarian links (from wegmans).  I also used 4 cups of homemade roasted veggie stock in place of the water and chicken soup base - next time I will try it with chicken and see if the stock was the reason for the soup being so extremely flavorful. Instead of kale, I used frozen spinach and instead of heavy cream I used 1/2 cup of half and half.  I also added salt and pepper to taste and some cayenne pepper for additional heat.  I usually serve a butternut squash soup for Thanksgiving and I think this year I will replace it with this soup instead.

Followed recipe to the t...and it was so yummy! I've never tried kale before in my life, only hearing that its juice is healthy but disgusting. But thank goodness it cooks nicely in the soup...will definitely make again on a cold winter day!

My family loved this, I make it often, My kids ate ALL of the Kale and love it :-)  I was lazy the first time and fried the sausage, but you have to bake it, otherwise it's to much fat in the pot.

This is a very good base for the soup.  However, I think you need to brown the sausage in the dutch oven, drain and then cook the sausage with the soup for the added flavor.

Fabulous. I have done chunks and slices both good (I like sliced potatoes best). Once I did not have italian sausage so I used some of the ham ends and pieces that I buy for beans and it was just as good. I have used turkey italian sausage and it also is just as good. I use milk when I don't have cream. I sometimes throw on some parmesan cheese. It is hard to mess up this soup and it is very satisfing and comforting. Thanks for the recipe.

I love it and so do 2 out of my 3 children. (The other one wont eat foods if they touch each other!) I substituted smoked beef sausage for the pork and didn't have cream so used milk. I used alot more Kale cuz we can't get enough of that. Very good recipe.

I made this, but followed others suggestions.  I thickened the base a bit with some cornstarch mixed with warm chicken broth.  I didn't use water at all...I had some chicken broth left over from a boiled chicken and used that instead.  I added the red pepper flakes to add some heat, salt and pepper to taste, a carrot, a stalk of celery and some mushrooms.  And 1 full cup of whipping cream, extra broth and some white wine too.  Topped it with grated parmesan cheese like they do in the Italian restaurant.  It was very good, much more hearty than what the restaurant serves.  My husband scored it a 9 out of 10, so I guess we will be having it again!  I'm going to try to freeze the extra soup to be served another time.  This is a lot of soup for 2 people.  Crumbled bacon might be a nice addition.

This recipe was so easy and sooooo good!  My husband loves this soup from Olive Garden and I thought I'd have a problem finding a copy cat version.  It tastes just like Olive Garden! I did use two large mild pork sausages links that I got out of "Sprouts"(natural grocery store) meat case instead of the 12 links listed.  I only had to add a touch of sea salt, and some fresh ground pepper.  LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!

Absolutely wonderful!  The family loved this soup.  The only change I made to this recipe was to use fat free 1/2 & 1/2 to help cut the fat down a little.

I used one 5 pack of Johnsonville's mild Italian sausage links and used chicken bouillon instead of chicken soup base. I definitely kept adding more than the mentioned 2 tablespoons to add more flavor. If I had more time I might have made chicken broth from chicken bones for more flavor but the chicken bouillon worked just fine. Didn't have cornstarch on hand so I used flour instead (mixing it in hot water before adding it to the broth). I like my soup with more potatoes so I added 3-4 more. Be sure to add the kale just a minute or two before serving so it won't overcook (and turn into a not so nice shade of green). Served this as part of Thanksgiving dinner with my family and they loved it. Be careful not to add too much salt because the once the sausages sit in the soup it might get too salty.

This is a spectacular soup and so easy.  I used mild sausage b/c I wanted my kids to eat it.  Also, used spinach instead of kale because it's what I had on hand.

This was really good! It was really close to The Olive Garden's version. We loved it, but I think next time I am going to make it a little thicker and use ground sausage instead of links.

THIS.. is amazing!  I've never had it anywhere, so I have nothing to compare it to.. but i've given it to several friends and ALL of our families love it!  I live in a small town & fresh produce isn't easy to come by at certain times of the week.. so I had to substitute frozen spinach for the kale.. but we LOVE it!!  It's super easy to make with easy to find ingredients.. I substituted the link sausage for some spicy ground instead.. I can't say enough about this recipe!!

This soup was absolutely AMAZING!!!! I wouldn't have done anything different. I could not believe how easy it was. The flavor, consistency and texture was right on point. Now that I know how to make this soup I will not be ordering it at the Olive Garden anymore. If you follow the recipe as is you should have the same results. Witht the exception of what type of sausage links you use. The flavor of the soup has a lot to do with the sausage and obviously the chicken base. Now that I think about it I use chicken boullion seasoning instead of chicken broth. The flavor was more potent and tasted like an actual soup!!! I noticed that some reviewers said that the soup was too thin but it's supposed to be that way. Just an FYI. Thanks for this terrific receipe.

This soup is alot like a certain chain restaurant. It's a great way to use kale. I do, however, use fat free evaporated milk instead of the heavy cream. I also use smoked turkey sausage instead of pork. I do like my soup a little thick so I add about 2 T. of cornstarch with 4 T. water and add it to the broth to thicken.  My little girl even likes this one.

Very tasty.  I made a few changes to lower the fat content.  I used ground spicy turkey sausage and 2% milk instead of cream.  I thickened it with a little cornstarch and water.  I also used 4 potatoes and increased the amount of kale.  I'll definitely make it again!

I agree, there is a typo in the chicken broth ingredient.. it should be a 2-1 ratio with water..2 cups of water- 1 cup chicken broth.. i make a big batch so i use 8 cups water and 4 cups chicken broth after tweaking my toscana recipe out  i cant enjoy olive gardens version.. too plain for me, one more note- if kale is not aval. use fresh spinach or greens..( collard, mustard etc ) ..

This soup was great! It really did taste very much like the one at OG.
I took some others' recommendations and used 1/2 water, 1/2 chicken broth instead of all water and a Tbsp of broth. I also put in parm cheese and a Tbsp of cooking sherry.
Great recipe!

This is my hubby's favorite meal.  We double it, and use about 1/3 lb. Spicy bulk sausage, plus about a pkg of plain pork sausage links sauteed in the pan, rather than baking it.  I also can't find anything called "nutritional yeast" at my grocer, so I just use the miso, and it's excellent!

This soup was both easy and DELICIOUS! I used Johnsonville mild ground Italian sausage instead of the links and everyone thought it was great! My picky 11 year old gobbled it up (except for the kale which I made her try) and my even more picky 5 year old ate the broth (he was not having the sausage, potatoes or kale - which I made him try as well)! For those of you with super picky kids, you can understand that this was a giant leap/victory in the quest to get my kids to eat a variety of foods. So thank you, Ken Miller, for this awesome recipe!

very good start to the recipie, I made a few changes. I used 1 lb of hot Italian sausage, I browned it along with the onions and garlic, omitted the oil all together. Drain the sausage and onion and blot with a paper towel to remove excess grease. I also added 6 cups of water and 6 tsp of chicken base, and increased the cream to 1 cup. I sliced the potatoes with my mandolin slicer on the thin setting and they came out perfect, next time I will add more potatoes. I will also cut the Kale in to smaller pieces, while the big green leafy pieces make a beautiful presentation, it's a real pain to get on the spoon. Thanks for sharing!

This was a huge hit at a holiday party.  I didn't use links of sausage.  I got a package of Italian style sausage from the butcher and browned it up.  I also used a chicken bouillon for the soup base - just followed the directions on the jar.  Everyone loved it.

LOVE this soup! My boyfriend has dubbed it his favorite that I make. I didn't have kale on hand so I subbed spinach and to give it a bit more of a savory flavor I changed to 2 cans of Chicken broth to 2 of water. 
Because of this soup it's a staple to have whipping cream in our fridge.

This is my favorite soup at The Olive Garden and I just HAD to get the recipe to make it at home, I have made it several times, sometimes with more or less of some of the ingredients depending on what I have and it's ALWAYS delicious!

I made this and it was so good! I used Chicken stock concentrate instead of chicken broth and added some salt and pepper. I also used ground sausage instead of links. Overall a great receipt and will use it regularly!

So good! Spicy, peppery and hearty. Substituted the sausage for Morning Star Farms Italian Frozen Veggie Sausages- worked great! Really easy to make. I also substituted the chicken base for a couple bouillon cubes and some chicken broth. I think you could easily just use chicken broth. When you simmer everything together at the end- the flavour really cooks in mmmm.

I gave this 5 out of 5 based on my changes. I only used 3 large hot Italian sausages and changed the kale to swiss chard. I also used 6% lite cream instead of heavy cream and it was still delicious. I also replaced the chicken soup base and water with organic chicken stock because I think dry chicken stock is pretty salty. I will absolutely make this again!

This was great made with cubed ham too.  I also substituted the cream with skim milk and still ended up with a great broth.

So easy to make, my husband and I loved it.  I actually used a half of a can of cream of chicken soup instead of the 2 TBL chicken broth - my mistake in reading the ingredients actually ended up making it taste really good.  I froze most of it and took it to work.

The taste is amazing, however I had to cut the amount of sausage in half and double the potatoes otherwise the amount of sausage was overwhelming.  I also ended up adding 2 tablespoons of corn starch to thicken it up, otherwise its just way too thin.  I've made this 4 times now and with my tweaking this will be a staple for years to come, plus it is super quick and easy to make!  The whole process takes maybe an hour and it tastes as if I spent the whole afternoon making it!

Pretty good.  I exchanged fat free half and half for the heavy cream and used low calorie nitrate free healthy chicken sausage instead of pork.  I also only used 6 sausage links and still had tons of sausage.  Made in this manner, it is only 3 points on Weight Watchers' for 1 1/2 cups.   Very filling and satisfying.

Very easy, and yummy. I grilled my sausages - went very quick whilst I preped other ingredients. I added 1 teaspoon sambal oelek for some kick. And couldnt find any Kale here in Australia so used silverbeet instead. Dont think the silverbeet was correct, but still yummy in the end :-) thanks

This soup is amazing!!  I love the OG soup and this is as close as you can get to being inside the restaurant!  I modified mine just a bit: I tripled the recipe because I wanted to fill an 8Q stockpot.  I used 12c of chicken broth (didn't have any base) at first and no additional water.  Because I added a bit too much crushed red pepper, I ended up using 1pt total of heavy cream (no waste that way!) and an additional small can of chicken broth to level it off.  I would definitely recommend adding the kale only if you plan to serve all that you make right away.  Otherwise, toss a few slices into the serving bowls as it's eaten so it stays fresh and bright green.  This recipe is phenomenal, I am so happy to know the secret now!

Recipe is great. Made it several times. I will say that it does make a difference as to which brand of sausage that you use. I tried a couple of leading brands and there was quite a difference in the soup between them. Overall a teriffic recipe!

Added a can of white beans, carrots, mushrooms (had them left and needed to use up) and used spicy Italian turkey sausage. Great as leftovers, too.

This soup was so satisfying and delicious!  I don't eat meat so I just added some fennel, salt, pepper and red pepper flakes to the onions for a 'sausage' flavor.  Awesome!

This recipe is very tasty! I've actually tried it twice, once using sausage and spinach (instead of kale) the 2nd using diced chicken breast (instead of sausage) and kale. I preferred it better w/chicken. The kale definitely gave the second attempt more flavor and texture than the spinach. I prefer my kale tender so I added it in the beginning. I also substituted w/olive oil, don't care for onions so I used onion powder and extra garlic. I would prefer the cream base to be a little thicker but I will definitely be fixing this again.

I used the Jimmy Dean Hot sausage in a tube and chopped it up then cooked it with the onions and garlic I also used 4 cups of chicken broth instead of water and put more potatoes in  using half first and half later so they would break down to thicken it.

This was awesome! Just like OG! I added extra potatoes and red pepper flakesand that is about it. Yummy with fresh bread or crescent rolls.

Good, but not quite like OG's. I did only use half and half instead of full cream so that might have made a difference. I also used crumbled up Italian sausage (the kind that come in bratwurst form) rather than the sliced smaller links and a whole cup of chicken broth.

This was soooooo good. My children even loved it and they don't even like potatoes unless it's a fry. But they asked for seconds and even took some for lunch at school. I made it two days in a row. I made it non-spicy for the kids and on day 2, I made it spicy. This is the best ever. My children said they had no idea that soup could be that good. Thank you so much!!!!!!!!

This soup was good but I needed more flavor than what this recipe calls for. I doubled the recipe and used my food processor to crumble the sausage. Some came out in chunks but no matter what there was sausage in every bite. I doubled the amount of chicken broth and added salt, black pepper, crushed red pepper and minced garlic. The kale was great - I had never had it before and was a bit nervous. It's a lot like spinach. I recommend slightly mashing the slices of potatoes while simmering, just to break some of them up.

delish!  i agree with other reviewers to use crumbled hot italian sausage.  it's also good with frozen chopped spinach instead of kale.  i sometimes add a chopped red pepper for color. yummm...

I absolutely love this soup. I have made it several times and it never fails. Sometimes I use link sausage and sometimes ground. I always use chicken broth rather then water and cubes. Thanks so so much for this yum yum soup.

I need a 1000 servings of this!  It disappears from my kitchen so quickly. I made it the first time exactly as the recipe calls for. I am not good at tweaking unless I have a baseline. My only complaint was the sodium content. Made my mouth draw up. A reviewer stated that crushed red pepper is great. I liked the spice but my daughter stated that it was too much. Begrudgingly I eliminated the crush red pepper. I put less chicken base and NO salt to curb the sodium. It was good but it lacked that spice I liked. I now make either 2 batches or One with a medium heat. LOVE!

We make this all the time. So, delicious. I use ground pork. I mix half spicy and have regular. So good. Just like the one at Olive Garden. I like to make it myself because I can make it gluten free.

Tried this last night and it was great better than at the restaurant. I used spicy Italian sausage from my local deli and it really makes the difference. Also I used 2 cups chicken broth and 2 cups water. My husband likes the soup when we go to OG, and he really liked this one. And it's so quick & easy to make too.

I followed all of the directions, but the potatoes came out too hard. The soup tasted bland until I looked at the reviews. Then I added chicken broth, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, and Parmesan cheese. It tasted a bit better but I still didn't like it that much. I only used 4 sausage links though compared to 12.

This was soooooo good!  I used some smoked sausage that my husband smoked in our smoker.  We had  about 3 good sized links left over and it was the perfect amount.  I am not sure what kind you would use 12 links unless they are the small breakfast sausage links.  I did add salt (not much) and my husband thought it was a little too salty.  The reason it isn't in the recipe is because the sausage has plenty of salt already in it.  I didn't have kale so I used spinach.  My husband wants this soup every time we smoke sausage.

I've never cooked raw sausage before and I had to turn up the heat to 400 to get the inside of the meat to 165. Also I would have probably drained the meat after cooking it so there wasn't so much fat. I used a box (32 oz) chicken broth instead of water and base. And after simmering the potatoes I mashed them up a bit. It was DELISH. My husband loves the OG version and I think this went over lovely!

Yummy! I changed it up by adding ground turkey breakfast sausage - cooked that with the onions and garlic, then added cubes of chicken bouillon. I also added a dash of oregano and black pepper. Oh, and I used double the amount of kale!

Fantastic soup, we loved it.  Followed the recipe pretty closely, though I added carrots and celery, a bit of savory and a tiny pinch of thyme.  Instead of heavy cream I used a can of evaporated milk.  Altogether a great soup, can't wait to serve it again.

yuuuuuuuuuum!  found this recipe when i got a bunch of kale in my co-op basket this week -- turns out my husband, 1 year old and i LOVE kale.

i used 1 lbs sausage (1/2 sweet, 1/2 spicy) and fried it up with the onion and garlic, then drained the grease.  added a couple extra potatoes, then pulled 1/2 potatoes out and pureed and added back in for thickness...then needed an extra cup of water.  used whole milk instead of cream and worked fine.  only did 1 1/2 TB boullion but it was still really salty (and declicious!)

thanks for the recipe, we're saving it for the next bunch of kale!

UPDATE: got another bunch of kale, made this soup again, still love it!

Very good with some of the modifications suggested by previous reviewers.  Used more potatoes and steamed the kale.  Used all chicken broth and added some cornstarch to thicken.  I only had turkey sausage patties from Jimmy Dean and they worked well after chopping them up.  Also added some red pepper flakes.  Will definitely make this again.

Superb recipe! I absolutely love this dish and is one of the family favorites (kids included)! I crave this at least once a week, but have to pace myself so we don't get burnt out on it, we love it so much! I've even made it without the cream (mashing some of the potato for thickening instead) and it still tastes great. Thanks Ken!

LOVED this soup.  I did not follow the recipe exactly.  I added carrots and celery and mushrooms to the onions browned and set aside.  I then took the sausage out of the casing and browned that in the bottom of the soup pot.  Added it all together and added the rest of the ingredients. I did thicken my soup with cornstarch. I have to say the mushrooms made this soup great.

Make this all the time but I LOVE to add white wine to the recipe and serve it with warm bread sticks, salad and my version of "chicken scampi" from that restaurant as well :)

This is a spectacular soup - I made it last night!  When I followed the recipe it seemed it needed more broth for the amount of sausage and potato it had in it. So I would and 5-6 cups of water instead, and you can add more cream later if you'd like to even it out.  I also did HALF the sausage and added twice to three times the amount of kale asked.  The flavor of this soup is incredible and it's more hearty than the one at a certain Italian restaurant.  All in all an outstanding soup. Thank you.

We are vegetarian so I left out the meat, added orzo, left out the cream (less fat) and used a not beef base vs chicken.  It was very good.

I made this last night and I am eating right now for lunch! This was amazing... It is similar to OG's not exactly, but I think it is better... However I did change it up to match my taste. I used (from sunflower market) fresh spicy italian pork sausage and spicy sweet italian chicken sausage, just to give it a deeper flavour. Instead of veg oil I used a little butter and the sausage drippings just again for more flavour. I also added black pepper, lemon pepper, and a little spicy montreal seasoning(mccormick), all to taste. It came out amazing, spicy but in a good creamy buttery way! This is a perfect winter dish! I reccomend it to anyone!!! THANK YOU FOR POSTING THIS!!!!! ^_^

Wonderful....I did use lower fat options...such as hot turkey sausage, fat free low sodium chicken broth, fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and a whole bag of fresh spinach instead of kale. Delicious! I also added one can of small white beans drained and rinsed for a fiber/protein boost. Loved this soup! Added extra crushed red pepper flakes to my bowl. Thanks!

I thought this recipe was great and I'd give it 5 stars, but I modified the recipe some.  I doubled the recipe (b/c serving for 5 just isn't enough).  I used chicken stock instead of water, added extra kale (nearly doubled), and thickened the soup with cornstarch.  It was great and even my kids loved it!

Very good! I also did the bulk sausage, as that is what I remembered from O.G. I got the spicy italian sausauge and hubby and daughter thought it was too spicy. I think next time I'll get the sweet italian sausase FROM MY FAVORITE ITALIAN deli next time (not just the grocery store brand) and add just a bit of red pepper flakes. I read several reviews of this and used 4 small(ish) potatoes, and thickened it a bit with cornstach w/ water. I realized that (maybe I'm wrong??) that when this said 2 TBL chicken stock that it should have been two cubes or 2 Tbl granulated chicken bullion - when I made again, it was EXCELLENT!!!! Because of this addition! I changed from a 4 star to a FIVER!!

This is a wonderful soup.  I usually substitute two cans of chicken broth for the water and buillion.  Also, I add a little bit of red pepper flakes.  I took this into work one day and one person declared it the best soup he had ever eaten.

I had leftover kale and found this recipe as an amazing way to use it! Being veggie, I used veggie italian sausage sliced. I made the first batch with potatoes and cannelli beans, and the second with just the beans. You do need the potatoes in there - that starch is vital.

Fantastic soup! My family doesn't really care for hot sausage, so I used regular Italian country sausage and it was really good. Great cold weather dinner.....sooths the soul!

Great soup but I modified a few things.  I used Bob Evans sausage instead of the links and also the whole can of broth and only 2 cups of water.  Needed more spice though.

Very good!  Husband and 3 yr old also liked it.  More like stew than soup.  Used reduced fat ground sausage and spiced up w/ crushed red pepper and italian seasonings.  Used small box of frozen spinach (rinsed and drained) instead of kale.  Left out the cream b/c it tasted delicious w/o it. Thanks for a great easy recipe!

I love this recipe, simple and delicious!! Usually I only change a recipe after I have made it once, but with this I added 2 more cups of kale because I wanted to use the entire bunch and I used bulk mild Italian sausage for 2 reasons..1. I am nursing a baby so no spicy foods and 2. the only sausage I can find without msg or msg derivatives is in bulk. So I made little sausage meatballs and sauteed them and then added them to the soup.

I wound up using homemade turkey broth because that's what I had on hand.  I, too, used red pepper flakes because I saw another recipe using it.  I used sweet Italian sausage, though.  I think it tastes great.  One comment...I think Ken probably meant 2 T. of chicken bouillon plus the qt. of water, not 2 T. broth.

This recipe turned out great. However, I did make a few changes I used ground Italian style sausage, 2 cups chicken broth, 2 cups water, and added a little garlic salt.

This recipe was outstanding! As other reviewers suggested, I used chicken broth instead of water. I also used a grilled onion I had leftover in the fridge-delicious! Thanks for a great recipe, will be making this again and again! :)

this recipe is great but I also made the changes of adding red pepper flakes and the parm cheese. I also used hot turkey sausage and canola oil to make it a bit healthier.
I would recommend once adding the cream to add additional cream, chicken broth, or any other seasonings to taste.
But this recipe is a great starting point.

I doubled the water and cream and used a boullion cube instead of chicken broth. I also added another russett potato and some crushed red pepper, and a few shakes of salt and pepper. Also I simmered a bit after adding the Kale to soften it up a bit.  YUM!

This was fantastic.  I was planning to make the Restaurant Style Zuppa Toscana, but without bacon on hand, it led me to this recipe.  I loved it.  Ended up crumbling the sausage and cooking it with the onions and garlic...used almost all chicken broth and replaced the kale with spinach.  Adding a touch of ground red pepper really took this dish over the top.  Can't wait for the leftovers - thanks, Ken!

Delicious, just like Olive Garden!!  I would only recommend using hot Italian sausage links with casing removed.  I took advice of using more chicken stock instead of all the water, a winter favorite now!

I've used a very similar recipe to this for 20 years. Guests love it. I have made it without sausage for vegetarians and it was still very good. For chicken stock, I find Wyler's Chicken Bouillion about 1.5 tablespoons really gives great flavor. And it's easier to store dry bouillion.

Love this recipe! I used linguica and put twice the collards (that’s what I had in my garden) than the recipe called for and let it simmer a while before I put in the potatoes. Added a dash of red pepper flakes and used sour cream since I didn’t have cream. Oh and I added black beans. Delicious.

Like this recipe but prefer it with ground sausage instead; however, we’ve made it with cubed pork as well.  It’s just a good recipe perfect for a soup kind of day!

I've made this more times than I can recall at this point and have tried several of my own variations at this point as a result. I usually use whole milk (it's what I always have on hand), mild browned ground sausage instead of spicy (so the kids will eat it), and add some crushed red pepper flakes to the adults bowls when it's finished. Amazing. My favorite soup. Very forgiving with mixing things up as needed. Perfect as written, but easy to make kid friendly.

I am lactose intolerant so I just omitted the cream and it’s still really good. Also my husband, who doesn’t like soups because they generally don’t fill him, loved this - without it’s creamy goodness and all. I will definitely be making it again.

I have less-common food allergies, so I make my sausage from loose ground pork and add in my own seasonings. Used Yukon gold potatoes and evaporated milk instead of cream because that’s what I had on hand. Turned out great. I did add a lot of black and white pepper and it worked well. Very picky eater liked it a lot and requested the extras for lunch the next day.

I love love love this soup.  I make it a few times a month and usually add two cans of white beans as well as more potatoes and kale to make it thicker and heartier.  It’s so quick and it’s absolutely amazing.

Sooooo good!!!! I used a package of crumbled sausage and doubled the potatoes, cream, water and chicken bouillon. Like most other reviewers, I also added crushed red pepper. I found it easier to cook the sausage in the soup pan first and then added everything else in as directed. I also used spinach instead of kale and added right before serving. What a hit!!! I will definitely make this again.

I made it and it was really good.  When doubling the recipe and I would recommend not doubling the amount of sausage.  It was a bit too much.

We ended up using smoked sausage and a can of chicken broth for some of the water . . . with a little less of the chicken base then, of course. It was fabulous.

Ummm this is absolutely delicious. Tried a couple versions of this soup and this is the best. Kale is much better than spinach for this soup but be careful, do not over cook it! You’ll love it!!

I didn't really know what to expect as I've never had this at OG, but it was delicious.  I did follow some of the reviewer suggestions and added crushed red pepper.  I also made bulk Italian pork sausage rather than bake the sausage links.  Ultimately, I definitely will be making this one again.

This was a horrible recipe. Even after simmering for 4hrs, the textire of the kale maintained stiff. The spicy sausage flavor did not mix w the kale at all. I tried everything to save it but in the end the entire pot of soup went in the garbage. I was very disappointed esp bcz it was so easy to make.

This is delicious. I did make a few adjustments because of some comments and I’m glad I did. I used ground sausage, extra potatoes, red pepper flakes, and thickened with cornstarch. Fast and easy to make. We will definitely have this again at our house!

This recipe needed improvement so I added fried up bacon & mild Italian sausage. Used chicken Broth, not water. Added a good pinch of  red pepper flakes.
It was a 5 Star after that !

This was really good!! I couldn’t find any good looking sausages, so I used ground maple sausage.  The chicken base made it a bit too salty for me hence the 4 instead of 5 stars. My 2 and 4 year old picky eaters ate a ton of this stuff!!  We will be making it again for sure.

Missing Oregino and a Bay Leaf. Chopped Peppers or even chili flakes help. I use chicked stock and not a cube with water.. Still a great simple soup. I prefer to crumble the sausage cook it with the onion and then add chicken stock.

Fast, easy and delicious! I made it as a vegetarian dish using vegetable stock, instead of water and chicken base,  and spicy veggie Italian sausage.  More potato and a whole bunch of kale. Delish!

I have celiac disease and can longer dine at that infamous beloved Italian restaurant. This soup is Spot. On. It's wonderful to have a perfect replacement that I can make in the safety and security of my own gluten free home.

This soup Is delicious !   I Doubled it and cooked the spicy sausage in a frying pan Instead of in the oven.  I also cut up some baby carrots and threw those in along with the   Potatoes.   Always looking for more ways to get vegetables into the hubby.  He loved it and went back for seconds!

We enjoyed this soup very much.  I did make minor changes.  I used whole milk in stead of the heavy cream.  I also purchased hot Italian sausage loose (not in casing). It was delicious but next time I will try it with sweet Italian sausage.  I also used 10 oz. of kale.  I separated the kale from the thick stem.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks to the submitter of this recipe!

Very good soup. I didn't add any salt or regular pepper but did add some red pepper flakes to make it even more spicy.  Even my husband liked it with the kale and he's very fussy about veggies.

Fantastic!!! I won't downgrade this because everyone is free to implement changes on their own specific taste but if you're a beginner my recommendation would be adding extra kale, sausage and potato if you like soup loaded with goodies!

Gave it 4 stars instead of the 5 due to proportions. Cooked 5 mild Italian turkey sausage (and there was plenty) with the onions and then the potatoes. When they were cooked through, i sliced them. Used 2 large red potatoes (@4 cups) sliced thin. And had red kale, which I used. Added 2 1/2 cups more broth. Since I used mild sausage, I added red pepper when served. To cook ahead, make the soup and leave out cream. Add cream when reheating.

I've made it twice using different sausages and both times turned out really good! I used turkey Italian sausage the first time and chicken Italian sausage the second time. I also used all chicken broth without water the first time and used both chicken broth and water the second time. They both tasted exactly the same. You can really play around with this dish using different ingredients. It's a new staple in our house for those cold nights.

IT was AWESOME after adding more spices. I think the recipe needs more spices, I was warned by the other reviewers that it turned out bland, so I decided not to let that happen. I used a couple pinches of the following and it was GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!

- 1/2 tbls spoon dried crushed oregano 
- two pinches coriander
- two pinches cardamom
-salt and pepper to taste

We loved it.  I did change it a bit mainly because I didn't have the Italian sausage, I used smoked  sausage link and I used spinach with crumbled bacon on top.  Will make this many more times.

Soups are my favorite thing to make,and I make quite a bit. Last time I made this exact as recipe-fantastic! this time I did spinach. I also used chicken broth and a full 4 cups of chicken base, used 1/2 & 1/2 instead. This time its just as divine! Used 6 sweet sausage w/caseing pulled off,cut up. Added a little sage and rosemary,wow-this soup is yummy! Hubby lovs it too!

Very yummy!! It does turn out a bit watery for my taste. I read the reviews and I added 2 extra potatoes, then I took about 1/4 to 1/3 of the finished product and puréed it in the blender, then returned it to the pot. This helped to thicken it. I added the spinach last (I substituted spinach for the kale; not a big kale fan). Will definitely be making this again!!!

Better than the OG! Love this stuff, cues any virus lol. I used bulk hot Italian sausage, browned it in my cast iron Dutch oven (it's fairly small), scooted it over, cooked the onions, moved them over, cooked the garlic for a minute, stirred it all together, added 4 cups of chicken broth, then the rest as in the recipe - added the potatoes, simmered for 15 minutes, then LOTS of kale. I don't add the cream until serving so I can reheat easily. Plus, it's so good I skip the cream half the time.

Love this recipe. Followed some of the suggestions from other reviewers...like cooking the onion in bacon grease instead of vegetable oil and I added sliced mushrooms and red pepper flakes.  I was going to use cornstarch to thicken it up when I realized I didn't have any. So I decided to mash some of the potatoes. That did the trick. I also added grated Parmesan at the end. This is a keeper. Even the hubby loved it. Delicious!

Good base recipe but I took a few shortcuts: used a box of dried scalloped potatoes and half a bag table-ready chopped kale salad mix,  added white beans and used milk instead of cream to lower fat content.  Removed casing from one large link sweet Italian sausage, broke link up into small bits before frying in pot used for the soup.  Soaked 1 tsp fennel seeds in some boiling water and added just the water to the soup to boost the sausage flavor.  The sauce mix from the scalloped potatoes gave the soup the creamy texture needed; finished it with a little white wine.  I'll make it again.

This recipe was amazing! I used regular rolled hot sausage (1/2 pack) and used 6 cups of water, I scrambled my sausage then added my onions and followed the recipe from there. I also used three tablespoons of soup base.

I just got done making this and it turned out really well. I cut back on the soup base (used 2 teaspoons not tablespoons) and used two cups of water and two cups of low sodium chicken broth. I had kielbasa so that's the meat I used and it turned out well. Only rated four stars for the sake of having to tweak so many things

This was way better than Olive Garden. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and added some red pepper flakes and additional seasonings while sautéing the onions.

Super good meal!  I just used four cups of chicken broth comma instead of the chicken soup base. I just used regular ground hot spicy sausage and leftover potato boil potatoes from the night before. everybody gobble it up to the last drop. It was pretty good.

I added 1 additional potato and pureed it to make the soup liquid a little thicker. Also added a dash of Tabasco and some ground pepper. Will definitely make it again.

I LOVE IT!!  I read all the comments and used a lot of the suggestions.  I actually used one pot.  I added the sausage at the same time with all the other ingredients and boiled until potatoes were soft.  Did the taste test, added more seasoning and crushed red pepper, then finished it off with the cream and kale.  I think this helped it with flavor putting it all in at the same time to simmer.  I'll have this for a winter meal quite a few times.  thanks

My husband has heart disease so I made a low fat version by substituting chicken tenderloin strips for the sausage; and skim milk and nonfat plain yogurt for the water and heavy cream.  It was terrific!  Had guests over the first time I made it and they loved it too. Everyone had two big bowls!  Sauteed the chicken in olive oil and poultry seasoning.

I make Tuscana Soup all the time cuz family and I love it! I used to make this recipe this way when I first tried to recreate it but now I've stepped it up a bit so it's not so blah! These are my changes that I made a long time ago! I use 3 leeks (white parts only, sliced & cut into 2" segments & rinsed of sand) & some chopped onion too! I use 1/2 hot Italian sausages & 1/2 sweet or all sweet, then add pinches of crushed red pepper! (I find it is better to take casings off of the sausages first then crumble & pan sauté, easier to chew & chunks not so large!) I make sure I pack plenty of potatoes & all other ingredients into the soup because I take a 1/3 out and puree them, then put it back into the soup which thickens the broth. Oh yes, I use chicken broth only & salt/fresh ground black pepper to taste too! The cream is important, don't skip!enjoy!

Made it for my husband and I. First try was a success! If you are not big on spicy though, I would suggest adding mild Italian sausage and adjusting the spice level by adding cayenne pepper to the broth.

Made this last night and the family loved it. I made no alterations to the ingredients, though I used the larger gourmet Italian sausages so used only six. I did make some changes in preparation, in order to preserve as much of the sausage drippings as possible. I first grilled them in an oven safe skillet until brown on both sides then covered the skillet to bake them. I removed the cooked sausages to a plate and sautéed the onions and garlic in the sausage drippings, throwing the potatoes in briefly as well. I added some of the chicken broth (that was my one real ingredient change) before transferring it all to a pot. When I cut the sausage to add to the soup, I put the cut kale on the plate I'd taken it from and tossed it in the last of the sausage drippings there. I cooked all the ingredients, besides the cream, for a good bit longer together than the recipe called for, to maximize flavor. I only added the cream at the end. It was heavenly.

So good! I used 1lb of sweet Italian chicken sausage and added three slices of bacon then cooked the onions/garlic in the oily pan instead of adding extra oil. Also, used 1% milk instead of cream to cut the calories a bit. Even my picky 7yo liked it. Kale and all!

Delicious. I didn't add as much water as called for, only 3 1/2c because all I had was a Knorr concentrated chicken stock but it turned out great, just a little chunky.

Great recipe!  Made a few adjustments because we like our potato soups a little more hearty. Used 6 potatoes, 4 cups of kale, red pepper, and fresh Italian sausage (instead of links).

Delicious and easy. I substituted Chicken sausage for the pork but will try it without sausage next time.

I made the recipe almost exactly as listed, but added some fried crumbled bacon and about a cup of the whipping cream. I also mashed some of the potatoes once they were cooked to thicken it, and added red pepper flakes. I used ground Italian sausage, and made sure to sauté my onions in the bacon fat with the garlic for extra flavor.   I made this for my boyfriend since it is his favorite soup from Olive Garden and he said this turned out better.

I too am a big fan of the OG version, so I was skeptical at first. I made it with the bulk cajun sausage first time I wanted to follow the directions exactly. Except when I got to the grocery store I was questioning what kind of pork sausage...breakfast sausage or the bulk sausage? Also it would've been helpful to know what kind of potatoes I just used Idaho. What kind of onion?  I used white. And lastly, it's very confusing because the recipe said to use broth but the directions say to use the soup base. I used the soup base. Turned out amazing!!! I would say an instant classic in my home! Next time, I may modify just to see what everyone else is talking about but I think it's perfect just the way it is!!

Everyone really liked this soup including my picky 4 year old. She gave me double gold stars!!!! Only thing I did differently was I added almost 2 tablespoons of flour to the onions after sautéing them with the garlic and made a roux to help thicken the soup a bit. I also did a half cup heavy cream. It turned out perfect!!!! Better than the restaurants!! I will be making this again and again.

It's good, but very salty. I did double the recipe so there were plenty of leftovers, and I'm thinking I shouldn't have doubled the chicken base. I'll probably do this again because it's good and really fast. We'll see if that change makes it a little less salty.

I didn't have chicken soup base, so I substituted part of the water with a can of chicken broth. I used precooked Italian Chicken Sausage links in place of the pork sausage.I sliced the chicken sausage links in bite sized pieces and sauteed with the onions and garlic. If you are not a big fan of kale, try using spinach. Delicious!

This is my families favourite soup. My changes included using chicken broth instead of water. Also, I used sausage with fennel..squeezed out of the casing and cooked. The fennel adds a fantastic flavour and zip.

My husband asks for this soup every week. I do add more potatoes, kale, and sausage. I use the kind that just comes in the tube not the links of sausage because that is what we prefer. I also add more chili flakes because we like it with more kick!! I also just use Swanson broth instead of cubes. It is awesome!

Love it! This soup is so easy to make and really hits the spot. I added some wild rice to mine and it thickened up just enough. Serve it with garlic bread and you've got a very filling and healthy meal.

Quick, one pot meal! Used Italian sausage links but took them out of their casings. Cooked those up in the bottom of a big pot. After those cooked through, made a hole and dumped in the diced onions. Sautéed them a bit till they're almost translucent, then added minced/smashed garlic and stirred it all together with the sausage. Added broth and diced sweet potatoes (because, it's Fall), simmered until cooked through. Added kale and touch of cream, stirred, covered the pot, turned off the heat and let the kale cook down for a few minutes. Ready!

First couple of times I made this as is. WONDERFUL! Third time I got more daring and made some changes, mostly because I had some stuff I wanted to et rid off. Cannellini beans really set this top! Zucchini is good in it too. I also browned some ground Italian sausage and added..MMMM.

This soup was so tasty!  I used bulk sweet Italian sausage and just browned it in the pot rather than baking it separately.  The flavor was great, but I can see how it would be even better with spicy Italian sausage.  My 2.5 year old wouldn't necessarily agree - so for now my husband's making due by stirring some tapatio in to his soup.

This was so good. As always we are the husband wife duo!!! We added in double the amount of heavy whipping cream, 1 cream of potato soup, and 1 cup fresh mushrooms. Mustard or turnip greens could be substituted for kale, but would not recommend. Hubby loves this soup. He says "this is this best soup he has ever had bar none."

I was pretty happy with how this turned out.  I think the chicken base is really important so make sure you have good quality--I had some but not great quality, and it did feel like something was missing with the depth of flavor.  I found the kale texture not that appealing, thought its flavor was so good... might try a different green like spinach next time and see how that works.  Overall a good recipe to try on a rainy day!  Must have some bread with it!

I have made this recipe several times and Love it. I do add half and half, carrot matchsticks and mushrooms for added nutrition. I also add fresh garlic. My husband doesn't like kale but loves it in this soup. I also add a lot more kale as I love it. Like others I also add red pepper flakes for a kick.

This was good, but not fantastic.  It's a great soup to dip some nice crusty Italian bread in.  Chopped up the kale very small so the kiddos would eat it :)

This is one of my favorite soups now.  I make this gluten free by using GF chicken broth and GF sausage which I crumbled and fried.  Also used spinach because I didn't have kale on hand.

I've never had this soup at OG, but this is very good. I also added corn starch to thicken it a bit. I used bulk spicy sausage instead of links. No need to add red pepper flakes like some other people have said if you use spicy sausage. I will definitely be making this again.

I love this recipe! I add crushed red pepper as others suggest or just use spicy bulk sausage. I also at least double the potatoes. And I use a combo of water, chicken bouillon, and milk as I don't keep cream on hand. Made it a few times and everyone loves it. You can't go wrong with this recipe!

Really good.  Fast & pretty easy too!  Used 4 cups of low sodium chicken broth and 2 cups water.  Microwaved the potatoes for 2 minutes to soften up a little.  This came together quickly.  Like other reviews, this needs some additional spice - we added red pepper flakes - next time, would use spicy sausage.  Also, upped the half-n-half to 1/2 cup.  Will make again.

Out of all of the Toscana recipes I have ever tried, this one is by far the best. I loved the result that came from following the recipe exactly, but the last time I made it I used 1 cup of cream instead of 1/3, and a whole 14 oz. can of chicken broth instead of 2 tablespoons. (Not because I thought that would make it better, but because I had to use up the cream and I was too lazy to store the rest of the chicken broth. Haha!) Still good!

Very good! My family loved it!! I altered the recipe a little after reading other reviews.  I used turkey sausage & cooked it on the stove stop instead of baking in the oven. . Turned out very good & cut down about 10 min of prep time.  Also used evaporated milk instead of the cream & thought it worked out great. I also added some crushed red pepper for a little spice.  Will definitely make again!

Just made this and it is DELICIOUS!! I followed others recommendations if using chicken broth instead of water and cornstarch to thicken the soup. I also browned and drained the sausage and doubled the potatoes. Will definitely be making this again!

I made this and have had many people enjoy it. They've even requested the recipe. The only thing I did differently was I sautéed the onion in bacon grease and added some bacon greases to the broth. In my opinion the bacon grease enhanced the flavor of the sausage.

Was excited to try this recipe and it didn't disappoint! I did double the recipe except for the amount of sausage- simply because I prefer less meat- however this was a perfect soup for a cold rainy day!

Absolutely loved it, I combined both sweet and spicy sausage and it was great. Maybe a tad salty but I was thrilled at my first attempt to make a soup!

Like many reviewers I made some substitutions. Instead of Breakfast sausage I used hot Italian Sausage, instead of chicken base I used chicken broth (33% fat free), and I added fat free half and half rather than heavy cream. I liked my version better than the restaurant version.

Definitely a winner!! I have grown kale in my garden for the last two years and this is the BEST soup recipe ever.  I add pepper flakes, a splash of cayenne pepper, as well as more kale and an extra potato just to make it heartier and go a bit further. Thanks Ken for submitting...

Since trying this recipe, we have made it dozens of times this year.  Being from the South, I use chopped collard greens in place of the kale. (The frozen collards are perfect in a pinch).  This is a simply terrific soup.  Great for a chilly day, even better for leftovers, if you can get lucky enough to have some left over.  Thanks for the recipe, it is a family favorite.

This is one of my favorite recipes on this whole site.  I used to be a BIG fan of going to a certain restaurant because of this soup.  I would always end up getting the soup, salad and breadsticks there just for this soup!  Once I found this recipe and started making it myself, I have not had an urge to return to that restaurant. This is so much better than the restaurant version, and you can control all of the ingredients you put into it to make it your own.  I, however, stick pretty much to the recipe as written.  I ALWAYS use Johnsonville Italian Sausage in my soup.  That is one thing I never substitute.  It just tastes the best out of all of the sausages on the market.  I have used both the links and the ground and I prefer the ground in this dish.  You can go spicy, mild, or sweet with it according to your tastes.  I mostly go with the mild unless I will be serving it to my husband, which then I will use the spicy sausage.  I will also use milk or half and half in place of the cream simply because I never have cream in my fridge. Other than that, it is exactly as written.  It is delicious!  The only problem with this soup is my own self control!  I have to make myself stop eating it :-)

I would give it more stars if I could! This is my number one soup in the winter. Always comes out perfect. Spicy sausage a bit much sometimes for my kids so I usually mix 1/2 mild, 1/2 spicy. I add more kale too just because it's the only time my kids will eat kale. this is my go to dish if I have people over, always a hit and so, so easy!

We doubled it for our family of 5. I loved the amount of sausage and the addition of bacon was a great touch. We used precooked chicken apple sausage and it was amazing.

Fantastic!!  Tasted very, very close to the one served at Olive Garden!!  I did use ground turkey sausage, and browned it leaving it in big chunks.  But other than that, followed the recipe.  Even my soup-hating hubby, ate 2 bowls!!!  Will make this again, and again, and again.......

So I have to write a review even though I didn't follow the recipe as written (which I know is a heavy foul on my part, but I can't help myself.) The recipe has so much potential! As it is, however, I doubt that it would taste any good to the average person. I used 3 potatoes instead of 2 and ground sausage instead of spicy pork links. I ended up with a lot of "stuff" in my soup which I enjoyed, but isn't necessary if you don't want it. I seasoned the garlic, onions, and sausage to my taste while frying, which did include red crushed peppers like other reviews suggested. Lastly, I used 4 cups of chicken broth instead of water and light cream because I had no heavy cream. The soup came out amazing! I can stop eating it! Especially when I sprinkle parmesean on it. So the recipe itself probably would have been bad (hence the 4 stars), but with a little tweaking, it can be better than the OG's and personalized to fit your tastes.

We *love* this soup and it's a recipe that's made it into my regular recipe rotation now.  I try to cook seasonally with local ingredients and since kale and potatoes are ready at the same time, it's a perfect spring and fall meal. (Potatoes keep a long time and hoophouse production extends the production of kale into the winter in my climate, so I actually can make this through most of the winter, too.)  I usually use ground spicy sausage--sometimes andouille or chorizo (both locally available) and I add 1-2 cans of white northern beans to give it a little more of a "stew" consistency vs. a "soup" consistency.  I also usually add as much kale as the soup will comfortable absorb.

I used TJ's chicken sausage (Sundried tomato and basil) as that is what I had on hand. Used 1 more potato, and pureed some of the potatoes so I didn't need to add the cream. Used better than bouillon as I didn't have chicken stock. Added chilli flakes like someone else commented. Also added garbanzo beans for more protein. It came out delish! Easy to make soup, would make it again.

Made the recipe as is and it was wonderful.  DH loved it and asked for it again, with more broth. I like to add bacon bits as well. Serve with fresh bread.

This soup is awesome.  The only sub that I made was frozen spinach for kale and it worked well. 

I was a little skeptical when my dinner started to smell like breakfast, rather than dinner.  It all came together at the end, though. As a big soup fan, I approve!

I have made this several times. The original recipe gets 4 stars. It needs more potatoes and I prefer the sausage either ground or diced

I made two versions of this soup, one by the directions and a vegetarian version.  With a little pepper, salt, and red peppers, this one wasn't so bad.  For the vegetarian version, I added a bit more red pepper and used a vegetable broth. It added a great kick to the end. My roommate, who is vegetarian enjoyed it. It definitely needed the salt and pepper though. The only additional comment I would have is that the kale took a while to fully cook, so add it a little early.

I made this soup using italian chicken sausage removed from the casing and broth instead of water and broth cubes.  It was so boring and bland.  I added red pepper flakes as suggested as well as the salt and pepper.  It was hearty, but so flavorless.  I would never make this soup again or recommend it.

My Husband and I love this soup!  During the summer months, I like to buy fresh turkey italian sausage at the grocery in the fresh meat case.  I buy half spicy and half sweet.  I also like to remove the casing and fry the sausage.  It makes the soup have a little more flavor, but can turn a little greasy if not drained.  Very Yummy!

This was just ok!  It lacked flavor.  I had to add a lot of seasoning and it was still just ok.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  Sorry but I won't be making this again!

Our whole family loved this, but I substituted chicken broth for 3/4 of the water, and low-fat turkey sausage cut into 1/2" lengths.  Delicous!

We always order this at the OG.  Now I can make it at home.  Used Jimmy Dean roll sausage and next time I'll use the spicy variety.  Thanks for an excellent recipe.  Now we just need a recipe for the OG breadsticks!

Really good.  I made this yesterday for dinner, had it for lunch today and shared it with my mother-in-law who loved it and asked for the recipe.  
The only change I made was to add a can of Northern beans.
Fantastic!!!!!

I have made this three times in the past month and a half. I made a few slight changes; added four cups of chicken broth instead of the water the recipe called for, browned a pound of bulk spicy pork sausage instead of the links and added the onions in with that.

delicious soup for a cold day. After reading the other reviews,I tweaked the recipe just slightly. Used Jimmy Dean Hot sausage roll and all chicken broth and one extra potato. I prefer a thick soup so i added some cornstarch and water to thicken.

I loved this recipe. Instead of chicken broth I used 4 chicken boyon cubes and added the crushed red pepper (for that extra spice). It turned out spicey and delicious. I enjoyed it so much I will most likely make it again soon:].

Used twice the kale, twice the broth, and a Bob Evans-type sausage (frozen in a big chunk).  Added cayenne to spice it up a little.  Even the boys liked it!

This was a wonderful recipe.  I used crumbled sausage which I recommend using hot, and even added extra red pepper flakes.  Everyone went back for seconds.  Also, adding extra potatos and chicken stock made the soup go further and made it more filling.  Loved it!

Warms you from the inside out. 

I used mild Italian ground sausage and omitted the oil and added some red pepper flakes. Yummy with garlic bread and a Cesar salad.
