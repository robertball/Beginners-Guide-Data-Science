This was pretty tasty, even though I found out by reading other reviews that I had made a mistake!  I didn't top it off with tortillas, only the cheese, and didn't realize it was supposed to be covered.  So, I baked it, uncovered, for 40 minutes and let it sit for 5 minutes, and I think it turned out pretty good! I think the fact that it turned out good and not soupy like others have mentioned, is because I didn't cover it in the first place! LOL.  I like the addition of the cream of chicken soup/sour cream base.  I also sauteed fresh chicken strips with a little olive oil, cumin, and chili powder since the recipe doesn't exactly say what to do with the chicken. I think I'll be making this again.

This was a great recipe.  Kind of like Mexican lasagna.  I made the following changes based upon the previous reviews: 1. cut chicken breasts up into bite size pieces, then saute in a little olive oil, with some cumin and chili pepper (yum, this was a surprise) 2. cooked casserole entire time uncovered 3. added half can black beans to chickent mixture-very pretty and liked the texture 4. substituted corn chips for middle layer of tortillas-not sure if this mattered. 5. went low fat on soup and sour cream. This was a great "comfort" food recipe!

Fantastic recipe!Super easy to make and it tastes great! It was a big hit with my family. I did make a few changes,I shredded my chicken after boiling it. I used 2 cups of salsa instead of 3 and added one can of black beans(drained) to the salsa. I also added the green chiles to the sour cream, soup and chicken mixture.

This is an awesome recipe.  I tore my tortillas into pieces for easy serving.  Used a regular onion that I cooked with my chicken.  Hot salsa and added chilli powder and cumin.  Great to make a few days ahead when you know your going to be busy.  Thanks !

We had this casserole for dinner tonight and were very pleasantly surprised!  It was better than anything we've had at our local Mexican restaurants.
I added a can of corn, a can of black beans and a small can of green enchilada sauce when assembling the casserole.  Then, in addition to the suggested garnish of sour cream and black olives, we sprinkled fresh cilantro on top.
Extremely flavorful.

This is a great dish to prepare for family or company! I have also made it by putting a portion of the diced chicken/sour cream/green onioins/soup, green chilies/cheese mixture into the center of 8-10 flour tortillas, rolling them up, and placing them in a Pam-sprayed blong pyrex casserole dish. I put the remaing mixture over the top and cover it all with more cheese. Bake, as directed (uncovered) and serve with the salsa as your garnish. This way, each person knows where the servings are divided and has his/her own enchilada. My family loves these! We also serve them with homemade guacamole. (2-3 fresh, ripe avacados mashed; 1-2 T. lemon juice; 1 small chopped onion; 1 t. salt, and 1 dollop sour cream. Mix until smooth and serve with tortilla chips.) YUMMY!

My family loved this recipe. The only bad thing is the recipe wasn't finished, it was like somone forgot to type in the rest of the sentence, and I am new to this cooking thing, so I had no idea what I was suppose to do with the chicken breast halves until after making the casserole. But it tasted great anyway.

Loved the recipe. 2nd time making it I changed the following. I reduced the salsa to 1 1/2 c and added 1 can of enchilada sauce. Instead of using all flour tortillas I substituted about 1 1/2 cups of crushed corn chips for the middle layer --which added a nice flavour. I also did not cover the dish while baking.

So easy and so delicious! I've been making chicken enchiladas like this for a long time. I tend to dislike recipes based on "cream of..." soups but this is one of the few that I wouldn't change at all (other than light sour cream and Healthy Selections soup).

I boiled the chicken, used corn tortillas, and added a can of corn and left out the onions. I will probably add a can of black beans next time.

This was pretty good, but not amazing.  Brought it to a potluck and brought half home so we had it for dinner the next night.  Much better the second day.

This is a good recipe, will definately try again.  I cut the sour cream in 1/2 and added 1/2 cream cheese, used only sharp cheddar, and added drained black beans. Instead of flour tortillas in the middle layer I added large corn chips which actually made it taste more like an enchilada casserole! I think next time I would substitute all of the flour tortillas for corn chips or corn tortillas.

This dish has good flavor. I mainly tried it because it is similar to my own chicken enchiladas that my family loves. Thought it would be nice to try something a little different for a change. The salsa and sour cream are a good combination, and the salsa made it spicier. Instead of cream of chicken I used cream of mushroom soup (I prefer its flavor) and added a can of creamed corn. Will make again!

This is an excellent basic recipe.  I say that because I used all the ingredients listed and added a few of my own to personalize the taste (don't we all, lol!!!).  I took one reviewers advice and tore the top tortilla into pieces for easier cutting.  All in all I am very pleased and will definitely cook this dish again!

Pretty good - I followed tips: baked uncovered for whole time, added layer of tortilla chips in middle.  Added a can of each black beans and corn.  Also switched 1 cup of salsa for enchilada sauce.  It would have been 5 stars if it was a bit more "saucy".  So next time, I'll add more salsa and enchilada sauce.

I've made this several times now. The first two or three times, I made it following the recipe. It was okay, but it was too runny. Also, for our tastes, it had way too much salsa and not enough chicken, and we prefer fresh salsa to jarred anyway. Now I substitute a can of enchilada sauce for all of the salsa, and mix that with the chiles instead. As for the chicken, I boil 5 or 6 boneless, skinless breasts and shred them when they're cooked, and then mix that with the soup, sour cream, and green onions. I follow the recipe for the rest of the instructions, and we top it with extra sour cream and my freshly made salsa.

This had real good flavor.  Tortillas were a bit thick in the middle, will only use one layer of tortillas next time.  Maybe my pan wasn't the right size?  It was easy to make and I will make this again, just wont be in my regular rotation.  Thanks Jeannie for submitting this recipe!

Being a former dedicated bachelor chef, I used to pride myself in the stuff I could throw together. I came to this site and this was the first recipe I researched. What a great thing! I used the recipe and added a couple of my own secret ingredients and it was a party favorite. Thank you Jeannie and thank you allrecipies!

This was absolutely delicious!  I did make a couple of changes though.  I cut up chicken breasts and sauteed them in olive oil then added taco seasoning with the water the seasoning called for.  I omitted the green onion since I didn't have any.  I mixed the seasoned chicken (without the liquid) to the sour cream and soup.  I used a mexican shredded cheese blend and left the foil off for the last 15 minutes of baking, broiling for 5 minutes.  This was to die for!  Even my 18 month old loved it!  I will definately make this again!

Every week my class and I cook for the teachers at our school and this week we tried the easy enchiladas. I am writing to tell I tried some of the enchilada casserole. At frist it looked nasty but when I took one bite it was very good. It was good and spicy. A little. I enjoyed it. I would make it again. The teachers loved it too.

Doesn't look attractive, but the flavor is outstanding. I thought the leftovers the next day tasted even better. Used a colby/montery jack blend instead and it turned out really well.

Good basic recipe!  We made a few changes, as suggested by other reviewers, and really enjoyed this casserole.  Boiled the chicken in mix of chicken broth and water, then shredded.  Due to a too quick reading of the recipe we accidentally mixed together everything except the tortillas and cheese, so we had one less layer.  Added black beans to the mixture.  Used a mixture of Monterey Jack and Cheddar Cheeses.  Baked uncovered and let sit for 5-10 minutes afterwards - no problems with sogginess.

This was awesome for a cheap, quick dinner that will feed many! I was in a hurry so I used pre-cooked chicken strips (the kind you put on salad), that were already seasoned with a fajita seasoning. Also, I added black beans, cilantro, verde sauce and jalapenos. Everyone loved it, thanks!

I liked it well enough, but probably will not make again.  My friends loved it.  If you're going to make it, I reccommend using less salsa.  Be prepared for a runny casserole with a lot of flavor.

It was good and it was easy. I made guacamole to go along with it. I would make it again.

The picture doesn't do this recipe justice! I've made this many times sometimes adding bean and we love it everytime.

My husband really liked this recipe.  The only thing I did differently was add some of my own seasoning... cumin, cayenne, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.

Absolutely fantastic.  I grilled the chichen first.  I didn't have the chicken in very small pieces so when I went to layer I decided just to make one big layer...shells on the bottom and then again on the top.  This was very yummy.

This was really good!  Better than expected.  I used whole wheat tortillas and low fat sour cream.  I also added black beans with the chicken, soup and sour cream mixture.  Cooked up chicken tenders with some cumin and garlic powder.Cooked uncovered for about 35-40 minutes.

I made this recipe with a few minor changes... to make the picky children happy.  I left out the salsa and green chiles (we, the adults, just added it to our plates later).  I also added cream cheese to the mix. (yum!)  I topped it with cheddar cheese and served this with refried beans.  Also, to save time and work, I used shredded canned chicken.  So I only had to use a can opener, fork it, add some seasonings and it was ready to go!!

I'm not a huge fan of this. I will say that I really liked the idea. I made according to recipe except I left out the chilis, used mexican blend cheese and added a little smooth taco sauce to the top before the cheese. It's just lacking something. Or was there too much creamy... I'm not sure. I can say I will probably never make it again. Sorry.

made this for dinner last night. a few alterations based on personal preference and i think it may have come out better! i only put about 1 1/2 cups of salsa, no peppers and instead of mixing it the way it says; i mixed the salsa, cream of chicken soup, and sour cream together the sprinkled the chicken on top of the layer istead of mixing it in. the chick stood out more in the flavor and it tasted great. 
and because we only have 4 people it made for a good bit of left overs (which reheats well, i might add)

I thought this was "good" but others in the house thought this was great. It didn't really solidify as I would have hoped but it was still good in taste. If I made this again, I might add a little more chicken or bake it uncovered a little longer to improve that aspect. Served over a bed of shredded lettuce and this makes for an easy and filling meal.

This was quick and easy to make, and my family throughly enjoyed it. A tip for those of us with kids, make the tortilla stripa a little smalller to ease the eating for the tots.

This recipe was much better the second day.  I only gave it 4 stars because I would have been embarrassed serving it to guests on the first night.  The tortillas were too hard, but the second day they were great.  I shredded a rotisserie chicken instead of boiling chicken breasts, it was faster and cheaper and tasted great!  I am not sure I will be making this anytime soon.

Love it!  This has taken the place of the one I used to make that called for mushroom soup in the sauce and cream cheese mixed with the chicken (BH&G red and white checkered cookbook).  I had no salsa, and a three year old who doesn't care for it, so I drained out a can of diced tomatoes and used that instead and it was still really yummy (I halved the recipe the time I did that).  Great recipes are forgiving recipes in my opinion, and this one is just great!!

Wanted to save time and effort so I browned the chicken and then dumped all the 'sauce' ingredients into the chicken pan and stirred. I layered tortillas, 'sauce' goop, tortillas, 'sauce' goop, cheese and then baked uncovered for about 30 minutes. It was great! We stuffed ourselves last night and are eagerly awaiting lunch so we can finish it off. :)  Oh, I also didn't have sour cream so I used cream cheese instead; great substitution, but I can see where it would be too rich for a lot of people.

Very good recipe!  Perfect combination of soup & sour cream doesn't make this dish watery at all.  I shredded boiled chicken breasts ~ a little time-consuming but well worth it ~ and will be adding black beans next time as it was suggested by another member.  It was also suggested by another member to tear the tortillas into pieces for the top layer.  Very good suggestion as those last five minutes uncovered make the top layer a little toasty and harder to slice through.  Based on my calculations for the ingredients I used, one serving was equal to approximately 13 WWpoints.  I will be lowering that number next time by using low-fat cheese, WW Tortillas, and adding beans.  Can't wait to try it again!

Wonderful and easy!  the only thing I did different was used only about 1 cup of salsa (it was all I had left) and it turned out great!  My husband ate 3/4 of the pan the following day, told me I could never make it again since he couldn't stop eating it.  Definately a keeper.

I liked it because even the tortillas in the middle got crunchy. To much salsa, next time I think I'll only put 2 cups in versus the 3 cups. Overall the taste was very good. The kids did ask if we could have it again the next night!

This was great. I made a few changes to make it a bit healthier. I used a 9 inch round pan so only needed 3 whole wheat tortillas. I also used light sour cream and 2% cheese. It was still delicious. ThaNks for a great recipe.

Excellent!  I added two diced garlic cloves to the onion mixture.  I also rolled the ingredients in a tortilla and baked it for the recommended time for a more traditional enchilada.  Served sour cream and salsa on the side.  Yum!

My husband absolutely loved this dish.  It was a nice change from the standard mexican food I usually make.  I thought it was a little heavy, but in small doses it is excellent.

YUM! The easiest Mexican food I have ever made...I cut up my chicken and cooked it in a skillet with taco seasoning, added a little extra cheese to the mix and VOILA! A quick, easy, DELICIOUS Mexican meal!! Thanks!

This was a little work, I guess if I had chicken already cooked it would have been easier. It wasn't very attractive looking, it seemed to ooze out everywhere & I only used 1 cup of salsa & let it sit for 15 minutes after taking out of oven. I also mixed the salsa mixture w/the chicken mixture..seemed silly to mix it separately when it was going right on top of each other in the end. I added chili powder, cumin, & garlic powder to the chicken mix as I was cooking it. Tasted good, will probably make again w/a little tweaking.

Delicious!  I made this for my husband and my brother and they both loved it!!  I made it exactly as directed except I added taco seasoning when cooking the shredded chicken.  I baked this in a 9x13 pyrex dish and had enough for 6 meals!!  Its a hearty dish.  Next time I make it I will only make half -- in a square baking dish.  It does rehead well, not as good as the first time, but good nonetheless.  Will surely make again!

This was good but not great.  My bottom tortillas stuck to the pan.  I think it needs a thin layer of sauce along the bottom of the pan.  I'm also not sure why it ends with tortillas and cheese.  I think the top should be sauce and cheese.  Not sure if I will make it again.

Served this recipe for lunch and it went over very well.  Did not use as much salsa (used about 2 cups) and left out green onions.  Was worried about the tortillas becoing too mushy but they were just right. Will make this again!

What a great recipe! It had plenty of flavor, even though I used mild salsa and omitted the green chiles (I have little ones who can't do spicy foods). But there was still plenty of flavor even without the extra kick. This will definately become a regular at our dinner table!

We loved this recipe!  I thought it was really simple to put together and it tasted like something ordered at a restaurant.  Only changes made were adding olives to the chicken mixture, using hot jalepenos, and using light cream of chicken soup and sour cream.  Oh, and let it sit for about 10 minutes if you want it more solidified.  It is a little soupy after letting it sit for only 5 minutes - but it is so good we hardly noticed!  This is going to get made a lot at our house! We served it with a side of black beans.

This recipe was good... definitely worth trying.  I will do some things differently next time, though, like add sliced olives INSIDE the mixture, and a few more green onions.  I also felt there was an overabundance of chilis and tomoatoes... I did use "medium" salsa which could be why this seemed a bit spicy, so I may use mild salsa next time, cut the amount to two and a half cups, and maybe use a 1/2 or 3/4 can of 4 oz can of chilis.  Also, whats the point of having a chicken/sour cream mixture and a separte salsa mixture to layer?  Next time I'll put that all in one big bowl,mix it up good and layer that with the tortillas and cheese.  Still, all in all this was good, easy, and enjoyed by everyone.  One last note:  this was cooked as suggested but not hot, maybe cause I live at 3500 elevation ... next time I will cook at 375 and for additional time.

This was just o.k.  It was certainly easy, but really lacked flavor., although I added taco seasoning., and used sour cream with chives.  Fortunately, I used my own, home canned salsa, and that saved it.  The next time I make it, I will add even more taco season.   I also think the cook time is far too long.

I pretty much made it as written, but did take the advice of others and: shredded the chicken and added almost a packet of taco seasoning, used 1.5 cups of salsa and 1 soup sized can of red enchilada sauce (mixed the chicken and soup together and the sour cream, chiles and red sauce together), tore apart the tortillas, and did NOT cover it while baking (which my husband didn't like, but I loved!).  This is even better the second day.  It was not watery and perfect to serve with extra sour cream, gauacamole and anything else to give it an extra zing!  This is a keeper!

Great recipe. I made it using all the ingredients, but added some corn and black beans like some else reviewed earlier. Instead of flour tortillas, I used corn (I'm not a big fan of flour torts). I will be using this recipe again.

This recipe was amazing!! The only thing I did different was instead of cutting the chicken into chunks, I boiled it for 45 mins and then let it cool. After it was cooled I shredded the chicken. It made it easier to work with and easier to eat, instead of it being in big chunks!! Family LOVED it!!

Very easy to make and my girlfriend loved it! I buttered the pan and started with a tortilla bottom and then a tortilla top, sprinkled cheese and baked uncovered making it crispy on top. This way, 4 layers altogether using 8" tortillas was perfect for an 8" cake pan. Sour Cream is a must and I used hot sauce. Plenty for two people with leftovers.

I just made this for my family. It was REALLY good. Since it is a very hot day today I was reluctant to turn on the oven. So I decided to try making this recipe in an electric fry pan. I put it on medium low for 1/2 hr. Everyone loved it. Will make it again .

This is a tasty dish, I mixed most of the cheese in with the chicken mixture and it made for an easier assembly.  I chose a medium salsa but next time will go with hot as the flavor was not as strong as I had anticipated. Great recipe!

big hit and even good reheated!!! i used the suggestions from other reviews substituting a can of black beans for a cup of salsa. i also put the green chili's with the soup mixer to give color. definitely sautee chicken in small pieces with chili powder and cumin to taste! excellent variation.

This recipe is SUPER yummy!  I cooked up the chicken breast, cut them up and shreaded the pieces to they were smaller bites.  You can freeze the left-overs or save it for later in the week because it tastes better the next day! YUMMY!

This recipe is great...I would have to agree, it does not come out of the pan, the prettiest....but it tastes darn good!  I did make some modifications:  I baked my chicken breast with chili powder, onion flakes,garlic and pepper(black).  I also make it with light sour cream and Healthy Request soup.  To the chicken/soup mixture I added 1 can each corn and black beans because I omitted the green chilies b/c we don't care for them.  I also had to cook it uncovered for the entire time(ran out of aluminum foil)and the top turned out extra crispy and we did not have any complaints about it being too soupy. Great recipe....this one is a keeper.  Thanks so much.

I used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. I also added a can of diced jalapenos and a can of diced mild green chiles. I didn't find this to be bland at all. I will make this with chicken next time. Great recipe!

This is a great recipe! So easy, and the leftovers get even better! The first time I made this it was a little hard to serve since the tortillas wouldn't cut with a spatula. This time I lightly scored each side of the tortillas in a grid pattern with a pizza cutter. Much better!!! I also used chicken tenderloins and pounded them a little with a meat tenderizer. They cooked a lot faster and were easier to shred. I'll be making this recipe a lot more!

Good flavor.  I sauted the chicken in olive oil and seasoning first.  I used pepper jack cheese and low carb wraps (all we had) will use flour next time.  Very easy and makes a huge pan full.

Took this to a family reunion this past weekend.  It was easy to fix and transport and several people asked for the recipe.  My daughter rated it "a keeper."

I thought this was really tasty and very easy to make.  I added corn and black beans to the chicken mixture.  I also reduced the amount of salsa slightly.  I used whole wheat tortillas and light sour cream and cream of chicken soup.  Very tasty!

I served this to the church youth group and they all loved it.  I would recommend shredding the chicken, not dicing it.

I have served a similar recipe at 3 casual dinner parties and my guest absolutely raved.

I actually make "enchiladas" by rolling up chix, green onions, olives, salsa verde and shredded cheese in to 8-10 tortillas and lining them up in a light greased baking dish.  Then I mix the can of soup and the sour cream together and spread it thickly over the top.  Bake it in the oven and the sourcream/soup mix melts down.  Cook just to heat through!  Delicious!
