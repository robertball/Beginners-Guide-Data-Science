Excellent salad!  I did not make the tartine, but rather compiled the salad and then crumbled the cheese on top.  I also used pecans instead of hazelnuts, and all arugula instead of a mix.  The flavor is outstanding-- the sweetness of the beets blends very well with the tartness of the cheese.  The avocado and pecans make it rich and decadent.  Yum!

I left out the tartine and just made the salad, which was very flavorful. I used raw, grated beets; otherwise I followed the salad recipe exactly. The avocados and beets went well together, and the simple dressing was a perfect complement. If you don't want to make the tartine, you can just toss some crumbled goat cheese into the salad.

Couldn't ask for a finer salad. Elegant and delicious.  Impressive presentation.  I used fresh basil for the crostinis, raised the ratio of olive oil to vinegar to the 3:1 I prefer, used a mix of romaine, arugula and baby spinach (what I happened to have in in the fridge) and toasted pecans.  Awesome good.

This was SO good. I made it with garlic and herb goats cheese, white balsamic vinegar, and sliced almonds as that's what I had on hand. Absolutely delicious. Will definitely make again. Thanks so much, Kat!

Yum, yum, yum. I made this as a starter to our meal. Next time I'm skipping the "dinner" course and eating more of this one. Thanks for the recipe!

Great salad dressing. Some variations: I used regular lettuce, since I didn't have arugula, sunflower seeds that I toasted in the oven while I was making the tartines, and added about a teaspoon of the beet juice to the dressing. I felt the salad lacked texture, so half way through eating, added cucumber slices. Also, I'm not sure the basil is a great compliment of the other flavors. I don't know what would be better, but I was a little turned off by the combination of goat cheese and basil.

Super Yumm-a-licious! I skipped the tartine (goat cheese is expensive!) and just spread some alouette on water crackers for a side-crunch. This salad makes me want to have ladies over for lunch!

This is a 3+ - quite edible, but for all the work just not worth the effort. The bruschetta topping that Trader Joe's sells is better - factor in your time and it's cheaper.

This was excellent--light and very tasty.  French hubby and I both loved it.  I used pine nuts instead of hazelnuts.

Did it as an appetizer for our Christmas meal - was a hit! Only minor change was the fact that we had more hardened goat cheese and therefore cut it into slices to place on the nut bread slices - then shook basil on the slices. As usual, all I could find was avocado that wasn't ripe enough (too hard - only used 1).
Very, very nice - will do again - (ripen them at home on the counter).

To an earlier review regarding texture - I imitated a French restaurant's recipe by adding thin strips of sugar snap peas to give the salad some crunch. Flash steam / boil the sugar snap peas (around 1 min), then chill in fridge and cut into very thin strips before tossing with salad.

This salad is delicious!  The first night I made it with the tartine, and it was divine.  Then, for a quicker option, I just made the salad.  It was perfect for a work pot luck and quick evening meal.  The hazelnuts are key, and I made mine with red onions and one package of arugula and one package of baby spinach. I LOVE THIS SALAD!

My boyfriend and I LOVE this salad!  It is ridiculously easy for how good it is.  This only thing I changed was to slice (3) fresh raw beets, mix them in a bowl with a little olive oil & salt, then grill on medium-high heat for 3-5 min on each side.  With the Chevre Tartine, it's virtually a meal all by itself!  YUM!

This was delicious. I used a spring lettuce mix. My husband loved this salad and so did I. The dressing was very good, but I added extra cheese to thicken. The avocado on top make it great. Will make again for sure!

I made this as a simple salad- as other reviews did, I didn't use any bread. Also, I used pine nuts as that is what I had on hand. Since I had some feta, I used that instead of the goat cheese. I did make the dressing- which was delicious. I used straight arugula too.  I loved this salad! It had great flavor and the beets were great.

Delicious salad.  I made it for my book club and it was a big hit!  I used roasted beets and added some hearts of palm and cucumber.  I didn't have hazelnuts, so I used toasted almond slivers.

Really lovely salad! I used toasted pine nuts instead of hazelnuts. Can be served up with all sorts of other things to keep it interested. I put some smoked salmon and cherry tomatoes on the plate with it. It looked and tasted really great!

I made this at Thanksgiving  for all the beautiful color, but it was so delicious I made it again for Christmas.  Now making for Easter.  The dressing is simple and delicious but since I make a giant salad, I make a bottle of dressing to go with!  I added garbanzo beans as well.

Very good, although I deviated from the recipe a bit. I skipped the tartine/crostini. My goat cheese was older than I thought, so instead I used blue cheese (stronger and would have preferred goat cheese). I used a combination of arugula and baby spinach.  Good dressing and did a 3:1 ratio of oil:vinegar. Healthy, big dish dinner salad!

Really great taste!  The picture looked like quinoa on a salad.  If you use the prescribed proportions it is more like a quinoa/goat cheese dish with a little arugula mixed in.  Next time I would use  about 3 times more arugula, 1/2  the quinoa and goat cheese.  Wounder ful blend of flavors and a vegetarian meal as presented.

I will definitely make this again.  I had no pecans so I used slivered almonds other that that I made as directed.  A real treat for those of us who love beets.  So few options for cooking with beets.

I added some stuff I had in my fridge-some radishes and red onion I used only one avacado. Very good! My husband loved it and asked for seconds. I bet it is pretty good for you too. The tartine was great and I served it with some steak.
