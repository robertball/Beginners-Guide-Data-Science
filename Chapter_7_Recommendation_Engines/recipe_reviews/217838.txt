I just made this stew and it smelled so heavenly all day!!  I added chicken broth and instead of yams, I added Yukon gold potatoes, and the diced tomatoes were Fire Roasted Diced tomatoes.  I also added about 1/2 jar of Green Chile Sauce.  So delicious!!  This is a keeper.

Made this the other night and it came out great.  Made a few changes on the recipe just to spice it up a little bit.  Took 1 1/2 lbs chicken and 1 lbs pork and sauted them with the onions and garlic in a saute pan.  Seasoned this mixture with fresh ground black and cayanne pepper.  Once the pork and chicken were lightly browned I deglaced the pan with white wine and reduced by 1/2.  Added this mixture to the slow cooker with the remainder of the ingredients plus 1 14oz can of chicken stock and another sprinkle of cayanne on top.  Turned out great and added an extra layer to the flavors of this chili.

The combination of seasonings in this recipe create the perfect heat in a wonderful chili/stew. The Yams give it a hint of sweet for the sweet/savory flavors. I did add a can of chicken broth to make it soupier, and used fire-roasted tomatoes. Didn't change a thing on the amounts of seasonings. It's just perfect!

this is really really good. here's some changes/subs that i used: added 2 cans of fire-roasted tomatoes instead of 1; threw in 1/2c jim beam; about 1/4c open pit; 1tsp chipotle tabasco; butternut squash cubes instead of sweet potatoes; threw in a bunch of beet greens that were going to go to waste. tastes awesome. this recipe is very amenable to wacky switch-ups based on what you've got on hand.

I just want to throw this idea out to everyone, fresh roast your cumin as whole cumin seed in a dry pan then grind to use, (I have a coffee mill reserved just for my spices).  The enhanced flavor is worth the extra 5 minutes.  Roasting spices makes even more of a difference than if you roast your peppers before using and everyone knows how much better a roasted pepper is.

Was a bit skeptical, but this turned out great!  Used about 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth as suggested by others and used leftover grilled pork tenderloin.  I also added a red bell pepper.  My veggie hating husband and my three year old even approved.

Didn't have a pork roast handy so I used 10 oz of chorizo and added diced potatoes.  Used butternut squash instead of yams.  What a great recipe.

This was great. I modified by using 1 Lb of taco seasoned turkey, and 1 Lb of turkey sausage. I also added 1 15 Oz can of chicken broth to make it more of a soup. Served with sliced avocado.

I don't eat pork so I did a combo of chicken & turkey breast.  Came out good but I would shorten the cooking time & add a bit more spice to the mix,  I did add the can of chicken broth that was recommended in an earlier review.

This is best chile verde recipe I have ever tried.  I am not big on yams, though.  So I added 5 fresh tomatillos instead.  Did not add diced red tomatoes.  Seems to have better flavor with green tomatoes -- just my opinion.  My husband loves this dish and so do neighbors, as we like to share food.  Thanks Linz.

I added some avocado to the bowl when serving and it was delicious. Great addition to a good recipe. My sister loved it and asked for the recipe as soon as she tried it. I cooked it overnight on the 8 hour setting and it worked great.

Great recipe! The hardest part was dicing up the pork roast which would have been easy if my knife had been sharper. I would add more hot sauce or a hotter pepper for some extra flavor next time.

I made this recipe as is, but I cooked it with a big handful of chopped cilantro. In my opinion, adding a can of broth would make this soupier than necessary. I served this over rice and it had a nice amount of liquid to wet the rice a bit. I made a traditional Spanish rice. I also put a bit of fresh cilantro and chopped green onions on top when I served it. Vey excellent.

I recently made this stew.  My daughter purchased a pork shoulder roast so I had to work with that cut.  After a bit of trimming, I had pretty pieces of meat.  I took the advice of several other reviewers and browned the meat and onions.  I also added chicken broth.  I added 1/2 of the yams because I was fearful that they would cook faster than the meat.  They did.  So I added the remaining yams after 4 hours.  The meat cooked to incredible tenderness.  The stew was delicious.  We can't wait to make it again.  This is a great recipe.  Thanks Linz.

I've made a very similar recipe for 45 years that's a family standard so this interested me.  I love yams and am always looking for a new way to use them and this did the trick.  The next time I make it I'll add a 15 oz. can of red beans and use the yellow hominy from my recipe in place of the corn.  It's a wonderful cold weather recipe and I enjoyed Linz's use of pork as an alternative to the beef I use.  Thanks for sharing this with us.

Made this with a left over smoked pork tenderloin we had.  I used gold Yukon potatoes instead of sweet potatoes and used only 1 can of diced chilies and added 1.5 cups of chicken broth.  Cooked it on the stove for about 20 minutes.  It was OUTSTANDING!!

Yum! I used one can of hot peppers and one of mild. It was a great balance of flavor and heat, as well as the sweetness added by the yams and corn. I might try hominy instead of corn in the future.

Delicious! I didn't have a slow cooker so I just put everything in a Dutch oven, brought it to  a high  temperature, then reduced the heat to simmer. It was ready in about 3 1/2 hours.

I did tweak it a little used Tomatoes with Jalapenos about 1.5 tablespoons of Melinda's Habanero sauce also used 1/2 of a small Africa yam threw in some Goat meat also since I do not have a slow cooker I just put in on the stove top on low in a 4 qt pot for 12 hours.  If you use Goat meat do not forget to remove the skin.

I've made this several times and we love it!  I happened to have hot frozen green chile from Costco and I probably used a little more than called for in the recipe.  I used a whole onion and 3 sweet potatoes, so added a little of my homemade veggie stock.  My house smells sooo good!!

I made this with butternut squash instead of yams, and used the Moroccan spice Ras al Hanout instead of thyme.  It was amazing--a combo of heat and spice that seemed just right to me.

I think i wound up with too much yams and too small a piece of pork.  This would be my fault, not the recipe.

My husband and I both loved it.  I basically followed the recipe, but spiced it up some.  I used 2 cans diced tomatoes (instead of 1) and 1 can of chicken broth.  Because I use low-salt everything, I added more spice:  I used 1 generous tablespoon of cumin and 1 generous tablespoon of oregano.  I also added most of a bunch of fresh cilantro and 3 diced chipotle peppers in adobo.

I made it as detailed for my first run; great recipe.  We enjoyed the flavor of the different veggies.

I left out the hot sauce. It had a nice flavor without it and guests could add it at the table if they wanted. I also served sour cream on the side along with the cheese.

My own little flair:  For some extra spice, I added four 4oz. cans of "hot green chiles", with 2 teaspoons of hot pepper sauce.  Used pork loin that came with a mesquite flavoring.  It all come together really well, even the sweet potato (which is what I assumed what meant by "yams").

Great flavor. Left out the corn, used tomatoes with green chillies (2 cans) and reduced tobasco to 2 tspn. Plenty of heat!  Chunks of pork shredded at end when I tried to cut into smaller bite size portion and added additional flavor.

It was just average. The concept looked great, loved the idea of Yams and corn. My husband doesn't want to eat it for leftovers. I wish it were good but I have to give it a thumbs down.
