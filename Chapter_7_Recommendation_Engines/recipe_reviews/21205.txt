This is definately a keeper.  I used Golden Delicious apples, and put them through the food processor VERY FINE before I started.  This way I didn't have any lumps, and didn't have to mess with hot butter later on.  We like really spicy apple butter, so I increased the spices a little, but then added 1/2 tsp. ground allspice.  I also only used about 2 cups sugar.  Put it on before I went to bed, and then in the morning took the lid off and let it cook another few hours where I could watch it to get the consistancy I wanted.  (I checked it by putting a spoonful on a saucer and looking after it got cold to see if there was any water separation.)

This recipe was ok, but I found that the cooking time once the lid was removed needed to be longer.  I made one batch leaving the lid off for the suggested one hour and the butter was more like apple sauce. I found some suggestions from an extension service.  They said To test for doneness, remove a spoonful and hold it away from 
steam for 2 minutes. It is done if the butter remains mounded on the spoon. Another way to determine when the butter is cooked adequately is to spoon a small quantity onto a plate. When a rim of liquid does not separate around the edge of the butter, it is ready for canning. Also in my first batch I reduced the amount of sugar as some suggested.  I think this was a mistake too.  The second batch was much better using the entire 4 cups.

This is a great recipe.  I had no idea it was so easy to make apple butter.  I had a lot of apples on my trees this year.  I love this recipe but I did try a couple of variations.  I used just over one cup of sugar.  I liked it better a bit tart.  I cut the apples into chunks instead of small pieces and then put them in the crock-pot on high; I would add more apples as they cooked down so my crock-pot was full.  I let them cook, covered on high overnight.  After they got soft I removed the lid and let them cook down while I was at work (about 6 hours).  Since they were in chunks the thinner liquid made them not stick and burn like a thick liquid would have.  They reduced down to between 2/3 to ½ of a crock-pot.  When I got home I took my immersion blender and blended them up and the thickness was just about perfect.  I tried the saucer test for doneness.  I put them in my sterilized jars and put them in a hot water bath for 30 minutes.  Now I have my Christmas presents ready to go, cheap, fabulous and homemade!  It just doesn’t get any easier.  I made this with pears also and it was good but not quite as good as the apple.  I also tried one batch with unpeeled apples and there is a huge difference.  Take the time to peel the apples.  Thanks for this recipe.  I ended up making about five batches and each batch made about 9 half pints.

Like other users, I found this a bit too sweet... ok, a lot too sweet.  I use nice, tart Fuji apples and about a cup of sugar.  Also, I find that I have to cook this down on the stove after it comes out of the crock if I want that nice, thick buttery texture, but it's worth it to start it in the crock because it gives it a sort of caramel aftertaste that's hard to get on the stove.  Remember: you can burn fruit butter, but you can't overcook it!  The longer you cook this stuff, the better it will be: if you get tired of it one night, put it in the fridge and cook it some more the next night!  My very best batch ever was cooked over three nights and canned the third.  

Another idea: If you make too much, there is a fabulous recipe for Morning Glory Muffins ( http://bread.allrecipes.com/az/morningglorymuffins.asp ) here on AllRecipes that calls for apple butter and is out of this world!

This is excellent. I used 2 cups of sugar and  found that to be enough. During the last hour with the lid off the crockpot, I used my handy dandy mixer (the kind with one blade that you can use to mix various ingredients in a tall glass) to break up chunks of apple. It gave the apple butter a great smooth texture that I couldn't achieve with the whisk. I made three batches of this apple butter last year to give as gifts and I am back to this recipe to make it again this year. I was curious to see my review of this recipe from last year and discovered that I forgot to write a review! A year late but sincere just the same. I hope you give this a try. It is so easy and you will look like a pro to your family and friends. The more you give this out as gifts, the more you will hear people tell you that they have/had a relative who used to make apple butter. Enjoy!!

I replace the sugar with ~ 3/4 c. honey. It's better for you and tastes great.

Terrific, apple butter. I made this in two crocks. One batch with sugar, I cut the sugar down to 2 cups, added more cinnamon,and nutmeg.  The other batch I made it sugarless,I used the herb stevia (I grow my own), added white grape juice (unsweeten) for some liquid.  Both turned out great. Plan to make this again soon.

An excellent recipe. Well worth the time. I did not cut the sugar, I added 2 more pounds of apples instead.  I canned mine in a hot water bath, so I didn't have to put them in the freezer.  Thank you for a great recipe.

I halved the recipe to see it I would like it.  It was great.  My crock pot was almost full with half of the recipe.  I could not have made a full recipe.  I cut the sugar down by half as others had suggested.  Next time I'm going to try putting it on right before bed and letting it cook overnight.  I used Jonathan apples.  I saw on another site that said Jonathan, Golden Delicious, and Macintosh apples were good choices for apple butter.

This is a WONDERFUL recipe and is SO easy!  The smell alone is worth making it for; it is very reminiscent of autumn.  I used my apple "corer/peeler/slicer" (which, by the way is definitely worth the money if you make lots of apple pies, apple butters, etc.) and prepared just about the recommended 5 1/2 lbs. of golden delicious apples.  I cut those slices into tiny pieces and filled up my slow cooker.  I whisked together 3/4 c. sugar, 1/2 c. brown sugar, the cinnamon, ground cloves and salt, and, at the recommendation of other reviewers, added 1/2 tsp. of allspice.  I poured that mixture over the apples and stirred with a wooden spoon which seemed to coat all the apples with some of the sugar and spice mixture.  I kept the slow cooker on high for one hour, then turned it down to low when I went to bed.  Got up in the morning and used my stick blender (another GREAT tool) to puree the apple butter completely smooth.  Let the apple butter cook on low for the rest of the morning and around noon I took off the lid and let it cook for another hour to thicken slightly.  This is a superb recipe and would be an excellent gift.

Very tasty version. Just be prepared for MANY HOURS of cooking! The final reducing stage (supposed to be 1 hour) really took 6 hours in the Crock-Pot. You don't have to "tend" it during this time, but you should be prepared for the time. I cut sugar down to 2 cups and it was still super sweet, so it might be eligible for further cutting. Also added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. Delicious!

This was a GREAT recipe!  I filled my crock pot with washed apples (mounding a little), then peeled and cored them.  Threw them in my food processor batch by batch.  I added a little more cinnamon and cloves (because I like them a lot).  Let them sit for 1 hour and then cooked for 1 hour on high, then cooked on low overnight (about 13 hours - I slept in).  I used a whisk to smooth it out and then let it cook for about another hour uncovered.   This was perfect.  Those of you who are cutting the sugar, you are going to have problems getting your butter to thicken.  Sugar helps it to gel properly.  Sugar water turns into a syrup and thickens as it heats. Processed for 10 minutes and we have delicious apple butter for us and family and friends (I have a 6 quart crock pot, used honeycrisp apples), and this made about 9 cups of apple butter!  Definitely will be making more!

10/4/11  Ok, I've made 4 batches of this now.  This is literally the best recipe I have ever tried.  Using 1 cup of brown sugar for one of the cups of white sugar makes it much richer.   I have never had a problem with just whisking it to smoothness at the end (and I've used red delicious).  Also if you want a lot of apple butter for gifts or self.  Call your local orchard and ask about 2nds or windfall apples that you pick off the ground.  I purchased 2 bushels for $10 (88 pounds of apples).  Hence the 4 batches.  Let me tell you this is better than slaving over a stove ALL day!  TASTES SO GOOD!

Very simple and easy recipe.  A few helpful hints for those that are making apple butter for the first time.
1. Look at your choice of apples before peeling.  Some apples are tart, sweet, crisp, soft… some are ideal for baking and others for eating.  The sweeter the apple the less sugar you will want to put in your butter.  So make sure and taste your apple before you put your sugar and spices and everything nice in the pot.
2. Peel, then use your kitchen gadget to core and slice at once.  No need to finely chop it will cook down then you can use a stick blender if you need.  
3. I use a cheap slow cooker and I have found that it takes longer for my butter to “thicken” up after the hour uncovered.  I cook mine uncovered on high for an hour, and then move to low for another hour or so.  Stir that bad boy and you can visually see when that butter is ready even before doing the “test”
4. Do the “Test”, put your saucer in the freezer an hour or so before your butter is ready.  After taking the cold saucer out, put a small teaspoon of the butter on the plate.  If your butter is runny, then keep cooking, you are not ready to jar it up.  Once it mounds up and trust me you will know what I mean when you see it, then you can jar that yummy goodness up :D 
5. And last but not least, PLEASE, taste your butter as it is cooking.  Before you thicken it up you can add a lil of this and that to make it just perfect for YOUR tastebuds.

Excellent recipe!  I halved the recipe since I didn't have enough apples.  I used 10 Golden Delicious apples and 1 1/2 cups of sugar.  I cooked it in the crockpot for about 10 hours, the last hour uncovered.  I stirred every hour or so with a wire whisk.  I sealed my butter in Ball jars inside a water bath for about 15 minutes at a boil.  If you don't know how to do a water bath, check out "Water Bath Canning for Dummies" on Youtube.  If you don't have the giant water bath can and equipment, you can use another large pot, but be sure to place small towels between jars while boiling so they don't knock around into each other and break.  I hope this review helps!

For Barb Maxwell--I have used this test also to check for the right consistency. The method I prefer is to stand a wooden spoon straight up in the middle of my apple better. Let go and if it remains straight up, your butter is done.

I can't say enough great things about this recipe.  This was my first try at making apple butter and I couldn't ask for an easier recipe to follow.  I used less sugar like other reviews had suggested and ended up using 1 cup brown and 1 cup white sugar.  I double the amount of cloves because it's one of my favorites, and also used 2 heaping teaspoons of cinnamon.  Not too sweet, not too spicy... Just pure perfection!  

I filled my 5-quart slow cooker to the brim with the chopped apples and used a fork to press down the sugar mixture before putting the lid on.  After 11 hours had passed I transferred the apples to a blender in batches and pureed the butter until smooth.  I then returned the puree to the slow cooker with the lid off for another 1 1/2 hours.  

The batch took a total of 12 1/2 hours and yielded an exact 8 cups of butter.  I have processed it all in a water bath and they are sealed and ready for the holidays!  Thank you Terri for this amazing recipe!  It will be used again and again!

There is no reason for all the sugar.  I used just one cup and it came out great.  Take my word for it, 4 cups is not necessary.

In my opinion, this recipe needs some serious tweaking. The first time I made it, I used only three cups of sugar, and it came out so sickeningly sweet I could barely eat it. A few others enjoyed it, but not most. The second time I made it, I used Braeburn apples and used 1 1/2 cups brown sugar. I used 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. cloves, and 1/2 tsp. freshly grated nutmeg. It was perfect with those changes. I really can't see how it's possible to choke it down with all the sugar in the original recipe.

Very good recipe.  Where my husband grew up in Ohio each fall they had a festival that included homemade Apple Butter.  With a few minor changes, this is much the same.  I used 4 different varieties of apples (the more the merrier I say).  I filled my 6qt. crock-pot to the rim with the peeled and diced apples.  Topped with 1 c. white sugar and 1 c. light brown sugar.  1 heaping tsp. cinnamon, a few sprinkles of each of cloves, nutmeg and ginger.  Covered and cooked apples on High for three hours. Stirring about every hour.  Then turned down to low and cooked with the cover tilted to allow the steam to escape for 6 more hours.  Stirring every so often with a whisk to break up apples.  Finished by blending with my hand blender just to to make it a little smoother. 
Perfect !!

I have made this recipe several times, and it is to die for!  But the first time I made it with the 4 cups of sugar and found it was WAY too sweet.  So the next several times I made with half or less and it was wonderful!

As for peeling the apples.....forget that!  I use organic apples only, so I simply wash them.  If you core and slice them with a pampered chef slicer, or similar, it makes things go very quickly!  Then, after slow cooking for the entire day, or overnight, you can use a quality immersion blender and you'll never know you left the peels on!  And, you've added some extra healthy fiber to your diet!  Trust me....no need to peel!

The number of servings sounds overwhelming but it really isn't... Keep in mind they consider a serving to be the amount you'd spread on 1 piece of bread. I tried cutting down on the number of servings the first time I made this and was sorely disappointed with the outcome amount since the apples shrink so much in the process. 

Awesome recipe though. It also works fine if the sugar is replaced with Splenda (I used the same amount of it as was called for of sugar) for those with Diabetic dinner guests.

I think that with some tweaks this is great. It does rely heavily on the type of apples used though.  The sugar and seasonings can be adjusted depending on the apples and your own preferences.  I used 6 pounds of McIntosh apples. I peeled and cored them and chopped finely then put them into the crockpot as directed.  I reduced the sugar by 1 cup and added some additional baking spices to suit my tastes (two kinds of cinnamon, pumpkin pie seasoning, maple powder).  After the first hour cooking I took my immersion blender and broke the apples down, but left it with some chunks. Then for the next 10 hrs I stirred occasionally while it was on low.  I really thought this wasn’t going to come together, it looked soupy, but I kept going because it smelled great anyway.  When I took the lid off for the final hour, I  used the immersion blender to smooth it out and let it simmer for the hour.  At the end of that hour, surprise surprise, it was a beautiful dark brown, consistent, rich and delicious. So don’t give up, see it through to the end and you will be rewarded!

This was so great! I am not a very experienced cook but this was SO easy. I used 6 pounds of Golden Delicious apples that I peeled, cored, and ran through the food processor to get them very fine. I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 1/4 cup light brown sugar. I didn't use the cloves and used about a tablespoon of cinnamon. I actually cooked mine about 12 hours with the lid on, then about 3 with it off, stirring with a whisk occasionally to get it smooth. So good!

I've been making apple butter for 3 days now and the house smells great!  This recipe is easy because you don't have to babysit the butter.  However, it does keep you involved for a full 24 hours from start to finish if canning the butter.  On the up-side, it is very flavorful!  I opted to follow other reviewers suggestions and added more spices; 1/2 t. allspice, 1/2 t. ginger, 1/2 t. nutmeg and cut the sugar down to 1 3/4 cups (1 c. brown sugar and 3/4 c. white sugar).  It is so sweet and so good!  I found to get the thick consistency, I had to keep it in the crockpot for many more hours than written.  1 hour on high (lid on), approx. 12 hours on low (overnight) and then approx. 6-8 more hours with the lid off.  I did not need an immersion blender, I was able to whisk the butter easily into the desired consistency of apple butter.  I only got 3 pint-sized jars from the 5 1/2 pounds that the recipe calls for...that's why I've been working at this for 3 days.  As soon as I can 1 batch, I start another one, as it takes 24 hours.  I plan to give these as part of my Christmas gifts and hostess gifts for the many gatherings ahead in the holiday season.  I do love the recipe and will probably always prepare the apples from my tree in this manner.  I makes me think of the great products my mother used to make from the tree when we were little.  :0)

This is an excellent way to use up all those extra apples that you bought at Costco because the price was soooooo good. The apple butter is dark and delicious. I doubled the recipe, but didn't quite double the sugar. I cooked it for one hour on high then about 11 hours on low and then about an hour uncovered. Used my immersion blender at the end, and it became really smooth. Great recipe. I processed the jars in a hot water bath for about 30 minutes for long lasting storage. The jars will make perfect hostess gifts.

Fantastic!! I did a few things differently, but the results were awesome. I didn't weigh my apples. I just filled my 7Q crockpot within an inch and a half of the top. I cut the sugar down to 2 cups even though I'm sure I had more like 7lbs of apples. I increased the cinnamon to 1.5 Tbsp, the cloves to 1/2 tsp, and then added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. I kept the salt the same. This was my first apple butter and it was fantastic. My extremely picky children were happy too! One more thing, get these going while you sleep and take the lid off in the morning so that you have plenty of time to let the apple butter condense. It took mine more like 5 hours after taking the lid off. Make this!!!

I used MacIntosh apples and I peeled,cored, and chopped them. I did use a total of 3 cups of sugars.Half and half amounts of brown sugar and white sugar and it was not at all too sweet, just yummy. I used 3 teaspoons of cinnamon, 1/2 teasponn each of salt, ground cloves and allspice. After cooking (covered) on high for 10 hours, I blended the mixture to a smooth consistancy and then cooked (uncovered) for about 1.5 hours. I was told by my husband that this is the best apple butter he has EVER tasted! Excellent recipe!

I love slow cooker recipes.  This one is used every year in the fall when I get a pile of apples for cheap from the farmer's market.  I typically use Jonathan apples, although JoniGold's were lovely and allowed me to reduce the sugar a little. I would recommend finding your own spice combination preference.  This turned out a bit strong for me.  Perhaps use a spice combo from an apple pie recipe that you like.  It's a great recipe and I think the spices are very "personal" -- each person needs to find their own exact combo.

Good and easy. I put 13 large peeled & cored apples though the food processor to shred them.  I only used 2 c sugar.  Freezes well.

I had never made apple butter before and was very pleased with the results of this recipe.  I decreased the recipe be half and chopped the apples (golden delicious) very fine in the food processor so I wouldn't have to deal with chunks later on.  I only used 1 and 1/2 cups sugar.  I increased the spices a little.  I didn't have allspice, so used a substitution I found for it on another site with states 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon plus 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves plus 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg can be substituted for 1 teaspoon ground allspice.  I will make this again, and only use 1 cup of sugar.

We used Braeburn apples, with 1/2 the sugar and it turned out PERFECT!  Jonathan’s with 1/2 sugar have a slight tartness...experiment.  Make this with the kids, they will have fun, my daughter would give it 10 stars.  4H project in the making.
We used the Cuiseart hand blender to puree the apples in the crock pot, and then left the lid off to thicken.

Growing up on a farm, where mom canned everything apple butter was by far my favorite.  This was just as good as mom used to make.  After reading several reviews and after watching it cook for 9 or so hours, I was concerned that I would have to use a blender to get it to the right consistency.  Don't!  Who wants the added mess.  Just let it cook a little longer and use a whisk like the original recipe says to.  I read somewhere that best apples for apple butter were Jonathan, Golden Delicious or Macintosh.  I used Macintosh and it was great.  I froze the extras in little half-pint containers. I wished I had made more to give away to friends.

Absolutely delicious! You really can use a cup of sugar and it's still pretty sweet. Also, it seemed kind of thin towards the end, but in the last hour, 9 1/2 exactly, the apples started to turn into the apple butter consistancy and it was perfect!!! I love having such a great easy recipe. We like it a bit chunky so I chopped by hand and it was still pretty creamy. It lasts a long time, too!

This is way yummy!  I was really sure that the recipe wouldn't work out when I put it together and started the slow-cooker before I went to bed last night, but it turned out stupendous!  I used 3 cups of sugar but may cut it back by another half a cup.  Also, I cooked it uncovered to thicken it almost 3 hours.  It smelled soooo gooooooood while it was cooking.  Thanks

Real apple butter requires a copper kettle, lots of firewood, and apx. 8 hours of constant stirring. We do several hundred quarts every year at church. It turns out rich, dark brown with a luxurious texture. This is thick applesauce.

This is a FABULOUS recipe.  I did alter it a bit because I don't like it really sweet.  Because my apples were Golden Delicious and Galla, I only used 2 1/2 cups sugar.  I used about 10 apples. I didn't have ground clove, so I used 3 whole cloves tied in cloth. I also didn't finely chop the apples.  They were coarsely chopped.  It still had a great consistency.  It turned out to have tiny pieces of apple. The smell it gives to your home will bring you much comfort!!!  Thanks for a great base recipe!!!

Great! Don't take the time to chop and peel though. I just used a corer that also slices them at the same time. Threw the slices in their peel and all and then blended it. You couldn't even tell. Saved me so much time since I was using smaller apples. I'm always looking for shortcuts

This was a wonderful recipe!  I also halved the sugar as some recommended because I like a less sweet butter than that sold in the stores.  It was really easy because I used an apple pealer-correr and then shreaded the apples in a food processor.  After it was cooked I pureeded in the processor again and then canned it.  Yummy!

I used golden delicious and rome apples. I shredded them with the food processor. I used 2 cups of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar. I put about an 1/8 teaspoon of cloves and allspice. Cooked for 11 on low after the first hour and about 5 with lid off to thicken. 3 cups of sugar is enough to make it sweet and not over powering. If you like tart butter then i would cut it back to about a cup of sugar. I ran it through the food processor before I let it cook without the lid.  If you have a big crock pot you can double the recipe it fits fine. It will yield about 50% of what you started with.

I thought this recipe was great. I also used less sugar - about 2 cups, one cup brown and one cup white. I cooked on high for one hour, overnight on low (12 hours), I then threw the mixture in my blender and put back in the crockpot, still on low, for another 8 hours (it seems to keep separating when I did the saucer test). New to canning, I had no idea what I was doing, and the instructions that came with the jars was talking about using a processor - which I don't have. I finally found the video: Tips for Water Bath Canning for Dummies on YouTube. Of course, I watched it after I started the canning process. I look forward to making it again - with the canning knowledge I have now. The recipe though - great!!

I am glad I read the reviews before making this recipe.  I also cut back on the sugar (I used a little less than half and was still plenty sweet) but used the same amount of spices.  I used golden delicious apples...yummy! It turned out wonderful!  I also let it cook longer than stated in the recipe, and it turned out better.  I let it cook about 10 hours with the lid on, and 2 hours with the lid off.  Turned out wonderful!  I froze some, and canned some.  When I made the full recipe amount, I actually got more than 4 pints...almost 5 pints!  I have gotten many complements on it so far!  It was easy using the crock pot..I let it cook overnight so I didn't have to worry about it most of the time.  It was great.  Will definately make again!

So good!!  I had mine done in about 7 hours because I was really excited and couldn't wait the 11+ hours.  lol  I kept my crock pot on high for about 3 hours and then turned it to low for the remainder.  I used a blend of Pink Lady and Gala apples so I cut the sugar back to 2 cups.  I recommend tasting all along the way and adjusting the sugar and spices as needed.  Amazing!  Never would have guessed that it was so easy!

REGARDING THE AMOUNT OF SUGAR - Obviously, it depends on what type of apples you are using.  If you are using tart Granny Smith's, you'll need to use the full amount.  Sweet apples won't need as much.

To the delight of every grandkid and big kids, I have made this several times. Here it is the middle of May and youngest GK told me I was almost out of apple butter.  I just started another batch using this recipe.  The only thing I do differently is add a handful of the little red cinnamon candies as the apples cook.  We love it on buttered toast, biscuits or with potato pancakes on special weekend mornings.  It is utterly delicious and is served in my home year round.   Thank you so much for an excellent recipe!!

Amazing!!! I started around 9am...after cleaning, peeling, and cutting apples got then going in crock pot by 950...followed others suggestions and used 1/2c sugar and 3/4c brown sugar...used the ground cloves, cinnamon, and salt...added a bit more cinnamon and cloves. Let them go on high for about hour..then turned town to low..took lid off around 730pm and ran through my baby bullet because it was really lumpy...let go until about 830 then turned off...let cool then put in jars in fridge..just had a piece of toast and omg it tasted soo good...just like all the other apple butters I have had at restaurants etc. A bit thicker then I have seen but tastes soo yummy!

This was my first time making apple butter and my first time canning...and I will definitely do it again!  I have an oval crockpot.  I filled it to the brim with chopped apples then added 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup splenda as others have suggested plus 2 tsp cinnamon and a sprinkle of cloves.  Left on high for a couple of hours, then turned to low overnight.  when I got up I tilted the lid to let steam escape and approximately 3-4 hours later I used an immersion blender, let it reheat and then canned it.  Tastes wonderful!

This is the best Apple Butter I've ever had. The recipe was simple. I slow cooked mine on high for 2 hours, used an immersion blender, and then let it sit on low for 20 hours. I used the immersion blender several more times and took the lid off for a couple hours. This is the smoothest and tastiest I have had in a long time, better than from the store. A keeper for sure.

Man, this stuff is GOOOOOOD. I only used half the amount of sugar and used half white, half brown. I also omitted the cloves. I doubled the recipe and the results were so absolutely delicious. I used my immersion blender to smooth but you really didn't even need to. By far the best recipe that I've tried for apple butter!

This is a wonderful recipe - so easy and tastes fantastic. The only thing I did differently was to cook it a bit longer (was in slow cooker for 14 hours, then with lid cocked for another four) because I like the super concentrated, rich, dark brown color. I also don't like lumps, so I gave it a spin in the blender before cocking the lid to let it cook down. No changes to the recipe ingredients though - super fantastic stuff! I will definitely be adding this to my fall recipe collection and will make it time and time again. Thanks, Terri, for the wonderful recipe!

A GREAT and EASY way to use up some of the bumper crop of apples we got from our tree this year!  I canned it in the very small jam jars and used it in baskets with fresh apples and home-made baked goods for holiday presents.  Everyone loved it!

This is delicious - very tempted to eat it right from the cooker with a spoon.

I doubled the cinnamon and added two teaspoons of ground ginger. Used 24 small gala apples. Ended up cooking it for one hour without lid on high, then eight hours lid on on low, then two hours on high no lid. Used my immersion blender which I would think is very necessary if you want a smooth velvety texture.

This was delicious but very sweet (even using just half the sugar).  I would suggest to start with just 1 cup of sugar rather than 4 cups, and then add more sugar later during the cooking process if you want it sweeter.

Very tasty.  I used fresh picked Golden Delicious apples from a local apple orchard.  Instead of using 4 C white sugar, I used 1 C white sugar and 1 C brown sugar.  This was still quite sweet with the reduced sugar quantity.  I slow cooked this for 16 hours lid on, 2 hours lid off.  I recommend preserving this recipe, because you will want to enjoy it all year long!

OH YUM!! Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe! I grew up in Lancaster Pa, so I was never far away from a yummy jar of Amish-made apple butter. But now I live in Australia and no one even knows what apple butter is. Although a great recipe, I did take on some of the advice left by other reviewers. I used 2 cups of brown sugar and added 1/4 tsp of Allspice. I too left it to cook overnight and then uncovered the next day. The only problem with this recipe is getting the appples peeled, cored, and chopped (a bit of a pain.) But I found a handy little gadget at a kitchen store that does all three things! Couldn't be easier. My 5 year old and I just made our 3rd batch. And while we want to share the goodness around to those who have never tried it, we also all like it too much to give it away!!

Ok, this is going to be a long review.  I grew up eating my MaMaw's apple butter.  I loved that stuff.  Then I bought some at the grocery store.  Let me tell you, that was NOT apple butter.  I resigned myself to the fact I would never have "real" apple butter again.  Then I ran across this recipe!  Thank you so much.  I cooked mine over 24 hours to get the consistency I wanted.  I did cut down on the sugar and increase the spices.  I love this on hot Pillsbury frozen biscuits for a evening snack.  Thanks for the post.

This spiced apple butter recipe is perfectly balanced and fantastic on roast pork.  Coat the meat with the mixture for the last half hour of cooking.  When I made this recipe I used the sweet Fuji apple and was able to cut down on the amount of sugar to just 3 cups.  The colour is a beautiful golden brown colour and the aroma is pure heaven.

Reduced the sugar to two cups and it was still sweet, might be able to reduce it a bit more.  We cooked it overnight and then on low covered for an extra couple hours. Cooked it about 2 hours at the end uncovered and it turned a wonderful rich caramel color and smelled wonderful. We used a hand blender to smooth out the chunks and it turned out to be the perfect consistency and color. Used whatever firm apples we had on hand. We canned and froze the batch, we had about 7 half pint jars from it. We will make this again.

This recipe is wonderful!  Easy and delicious, perfect for gift giving.  I used red delicious appes and cut the sugar back to 2 cups and it was just sweet enough.  Probably could cut it back a little more, but my family likes it sweet.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

This is a great recipe -- a really nice change from the usual strawberry/raspberry jam!  It's the first time I've tasted apple butter and my husband, kids and I are hooked!!  I filled the crock pot in the evening and filled my jars in the morning.  Thanks, Terri, for this wonderful recipe -- it's a keeper!

According to my husband and kids this was our best batch of apple butter ever.  We used Gala apples (this time of year in PA they are at the end of their picking season and very juicy and sweet).  Filled the crockpot to the top and based on previous reviews cut the sugar.  We added 1 cup sugar, 3 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp cloves and salt and 2 tsp vanilla.  Cooked in the crockpot for about 9 hours and then placed in blender to puree.  (only pureed half the batch since I like mine with more texture).  I did follow canning directions for placing them in jars (boiled jars & lids - waited for the "pop") but the apple butter is so good I don't think we will need to worry about a shelf life - it will go to fast!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was my first time making apple butter and this recipe was delicious!! I used one cup brown sugar and 3 cups white. I thought it was perfectly sweetened. I upped the spices slightly. I used 2 heaping teaspoons cinnamon and a heaping 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg. I like it spicy. I filled my 6 qt. Crock Pot to the brim with the peeled, sliced apples and then added the sugar and spices. After it cooked down a little I stirred it. Went to bed and in the morning took the lid off to cook down and stirred with a whisk. I wanted it a little chunky. I let it cook down about 4 hours then canned it in half pint jars. I filled each to within 1/4 inch from the top and processed for 25 minutes in a water bath. We loved it and will be making this every year!!

Wonderful.  I started with about 6 pounds of macintosh and fuji.  I cut the sugar to two cups and added another 1/4 tsp. of cloves.  I canned half of it and then added a tsp of double strength vanilla to the rest before canning.  It was really nice and softened the flavor a bit.  Mine made 10 half pint jars and it was a fun first canning experience.

DELICIOUS!  I had about 2 1/2 lbs. of apples that were starting to get soft spots so I was happy to find this recipe.  I cut the recipe in half and it took about 7 hours to cook.  I did the spoonful on a saucer test to tell when it was done.  This tastes awesome when spread on cinnamon raisin toast.  Thank you Terri for sharing your DELICIOUS recipe!

This was so easy, yet so difficult.  Difficult in making sure I start this at a time where I can deal with it the rest of the day.  Easy because it was super easy.

Started it at 9 in the morning, and was able to jar it by 7:30 at night.  I did modify the recipe slightly.  Instead of the various spices, I cheated and just used about a tablespoon of Pumpkin Pie spice (key word is about; i just started sprinkling it all over the top), and I cut the sugar in half and used brown instead.  I used all kinds of Apples:  Mostly Granny Smith, but some Pink Lady and some Fuji as well.  This gave a very interesting and VERY tasty blend.

I will TOTALLY do this again next fall.  We have a place called Apple Hill near the Sacramento area where we get nice, good apples.  I will look forward to possibly making this a tradition!!

UPDATE:  Easy solution...  Start this the night before.  Let it cook overnight.  1.  You don't have to worry about the timing as much, 2.  It makes the whole house smell wonderful as you wake up in the morning.

I make apple butter in the crock pot and it isn't necessary to peel.  I cut, core and quarter and that's all I need to do.  Be careful with your sugar, it really depends on the sweetness of the apples you use.  If you're using a sweet apple and you add too much sugar you are going to end up with too sweet Apple Butter.  I run the mixture through my Ninja for less than a minute, then pour into hot jars and the canning process.  Easy peasy!!!

I had 10 lbs of apples to use so I used 2 crock pots. I used 1/4 c brown sugar, 1/4 c apple juice, 1/2 tbsp cinnamon and 1/2 tbsp pumpkin pie spice in each crock pot. I let it cook for 9 hours with the lid on then 4 hours with the lid off, I used my immersion blender to make it smooth. It made 21 cups in total. I think next time less time with the lid on and more with it off to thicken more.

Delicious!  So easy to make!  I used a variety of apples since we had bushels of all different kinds from our apple picking trip. I used Rome, Jonathan, Macintosh, Granny Smith and Honey Crisp and it was wonderful.  Definitely passing this receipe on to others =)

This was a fabulous recipe. I used 6 1/2lbs of apples-Rome, York, granny smith & fuji (all locally grown & fresh from an orchard in Virginia) I cut the sugar to 3 cups and used all splenda. I also used the suggestion of others and put the apples through the food processor after I cored them. Once I took the lid off it took about 5 hours to thicken up. It made 5 jelly jars worth and I canned them (boiling water bath for 10 mins.) I can't wait to make this again. I am going to do a double batch though - it's a long process for only 5 jars!

I was kind of cautious at first if this recipe was going to be worth it after I added only a few ingredients. I have never made apple butter before, but this was excellent! 5 stars! 

My family wants me to make more of it. I think that for Thanksgiving and Christmas this would be the perfect gift! I'm going to the store today to get some mason jars and ribbon. :)

I used 3 lbs of apples and 1 cup of sugar. Cored and sliced the apples, cooked them for 10 hrs covered and 2 hrs uncovered then ran them thru the mill(to remove the skins. The best I ever had, even better than the Amish make.

This is the best!  It's even good if you end up cooking the apples 2 or 3 days because you don't have time to can right away!  I generally only use 2 cups of sugar and double the cinnamon and cloves and also add allspice and nutmeg.  Also, I put it in the blender just before I can it since it looks better in the jars.

This was the easiest recipe for apple butter that was also great in flavor.  I cut back on the suger because it was a little to sweet for my taste but it is a keeper.

This was a wonderful recipe.  My husband loves Apple Butter but hasn't had any since his grandmother passed away. I saw this recipe and decided to try it.. He LOVED it.  This is going to become a tradition in our home.  Thanks for sharing a wonderfu recipe!

At first this came out as sort of a thick applesauce...So I used my emulsion blender and after that it thickened right up and became a thick, wonderful, gooey apple butter. I also added about 1 1/2 tbs all together of cinnamon because I love it so much and it was amazing. My only problem is that I used only 3 cups of sugar and it still came out a tad too sweet. Next time I will use Granny Smith apples (because of the tartness) or use less sugar. Lovely stuff though!

This was excellent!  I used up some old apples I had and boy was that a treat.  My husband and I really liked the results of this recipe!  Just a side note, I had some homemade applesauce in the freezer that we weren't eating, so I just added that to the recipe as well.  It worked out great.

This is just a perfect recipe!  We used some older soft apples that were too tart to eat, so everyone left them alone.  The recipe was easy to make and the house smelled fabulous after cooking.  We were eating spoonfuls out of the pan!  I will make this often. Perfect topping for autumn cakes, pancakes, oatmeal and more.  Yum!!

This is my second batch the first went quick!  I would have given it five stars but decided on  4 due to a few inconsistencies in the recipe.  #1.. prep time is longer than 30 minutes.  I used a countertop apple peeler that moves quickly but dicing them takes time.  The first tie I diced them rather finely but found it makes no difference.  #2. Even with the fine dice a wisk did not create a smooth product.  Use a immersion blender, works lie a dream.  #3.  Time after removing lid is more than an hour.  Mine ran about 3 hours.  I suppose this could vary due to how juicy your apples are.  All things considered in will continue to use this recipe.

I grew up on apple butter. In fact the village I lived in hosted an Apple Butter Day every year and still does. Nothing beats homemade apple butter! This was my first time attempting to make my own apple butter and I kinda battled with it but it still came out good, though next time I'd make some modifications. I used Jonathan apples but probably would try a different kind next time. Like others, I cut down on the sugar and used only 3 cups. I also added allspice as some suggested but may have added too much because it was very spicy when it was done, will probably leave that out next time. I tried to cook my apples the 9-11 hours as stated but by the 8th hour, a lot of the liquid was gone so I had to stop. It was still very chunky so I threw it all in a blender and that helped to smooth it out. I got over the flavor, being a little too spicy, but as it sat in my fridge, it thickened up a lot and became almost too gummy. I ended up using most of it in an apple butter spice cake, which came out really nice. Will try again next Fall. It did make the house smell wonderful! :)

This is wonderful!  I did not peel the apples, (didn't read the recipe right). When the cooking time was finished, I pureed it in a blender.  You can't even tell there were peels on the apples, so I am going to do it the same way the next time.  I will definitely be making this again!  Will not buy storebought Apple Butter ever again!

Made this yesterday to give as Christmas gift.  It turned out great.  I couldn't keep my 15 year old out of it.  The only issue I have is it did not take 1 hour with lid off... it was more like 3 or 4 hours.  But it turned out great so it didn't matter.

I gave this recipe three stars because I think there needs to be some clarification/extra instructions included. This took WAY longer than stated. My main reason for the rating is that it calls for "finely diced" apples, but it really should say "shredded" because after about 15 hours in the slow cooker, my apple pieces were still pieces. Either that, or there should be a final step of how to blend it at the end. I used my electric mixer after 15 hours, and when it still wasn't smoother after about 18 hours, I just put the mixture in my food processor to FINALLY achieved the smooth texture apple butter is supposed to have. Don't get me wrong, the flavor was excellent, though!

This took longer than all day. Next time I will make it "all night" apple butter, starting it in the evening, then turning it down and going to bed. It should be ready to can when I get up! A friend of mine tried it this way and worked very well.

So yummy! I used Mcintoshes and I cut the sugar in half but it was still a bit sweet for my liking. I'll probably just omit it altogether if I do this with Mcintosh apples again.

This was my first try at Apple Butter.  I adjusted the spices a little. I reduced the cinnamon to 1.5 tsp and added 1/4 tsp of all spice. If you want to speed up the process, put the crock pot on high covered for  4 hours, uncover and cook 3 more hours. I used a immersion blender to smooth the butter.

Love Apple Butter-and this recipe was so easy and so delicious! My husband and I love it on toast and also on pancakes. I used 5.5 pounds of Granny Smiths and 3 1/2 cups of sugar.  I got a little over 4 pints after 9 hrs. in slow cooker-one of those hours with the lid off-stirred frequently with a whisk-no lumps and nice and thick!!! Thanks for sharing!

Thought I should probably come back and rate this since I've been using it for a few years now.  This is fabulous!  I have an apple tree in my yard that always leaves me with more apples than I know what to do with and this recipe is the solution.  I make it exactly as the recipe is written for most batches, just cut down the sugar in one batch for my in laws and either way it's delicious!  I can it and enjoy homemade apple butter all year.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Totally worth the wait, for sure. Plan on it taking much longer than suggested though, especially when it comes to reducing it at step 4. Mine took several hours to reduce (and my slow cooker boils even on low). It's ready when there is no visible liquid. I increased the spices by double and used only 1 cup of honey with sweet orchard run Gala apples. As the submitter suggests, the amount of sweetener used depends on the apples you use. My results were quite sweet but still pleasantly tangy.

This was absolutely delicious. The only ingredient change I made was the sweetener: I substituted 3/4 cup of honey for the sugar (I was starting with already-sweet gala apples I'd found on sale, so I knew it wouldn't need much). If I'd used white sugar, one cup would have been plenty. I prepped and started the apple butter before I went to bed at night, which gave it a long cooking time (the house smelled heavenly when we woke up!). The only issue I noted with the recipe, which someone else also mentioned, was that it took a long time to reduce. I ended up turning my crock pot on high with the lid off and it still took three hours for enough liquid to boil off. The end result is sure worth it though! This is a perfect fall recipe.

I can not imagine making this as written and giving it 5 stars.  The recipe calls for WAY TOO MUCH sugar.  But like others have said, with a few tweeks this is a 5 star recipe!  I used 7lbs of apples (cored and peeled) and placed them in the food processor to get them very finely chopped.  Then I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 1/3 cup white sugar.  I also added an extra half tsp of cinnamon and 1tsp nutmeg.  I was worried the entire time that the butter wouldn't setup, but finally after simmering with the lid off for 2.5 hours it did set up perfectly! The last hour I took a stick mixer to the butter to get out any remaining chunks and to get it nice and smooth.  The total cook time was 16 hours but worth every minute of it!

Delicious recipe!!  Next time I'll cut sugar down even more to 1 and 1/2 cups.  Amazing flavor though!  A definite keeper. :)

The apple butter is super good.  My only gripe is that the recipe prep time took more like 2 hours.

This had a wonderful but very sweet flavor. I used it on the pork tenderloin and it was amazing!  It does take a very long time to complete but it was worth it.

My family and friends adore this recipe.  I actually have cut the sugar down by 1 cup and have increase the cooking time (mainly because it makes the house smell so warm and inviting).

Because of the comments about too much sugar I cut out half a cup from the recipe, still was too sweet but all my gift recipients loved it! Next time I will omit a cup of sugar.

This is my first time making (and even tasting) apple butter and all I have to say is - YUM!  I halved the sugar and it was still very sweet.  Next time I think I'll cut the sugar down to one cup or a cup and a half.

This recipe is definately a keeper!  I used a combination of Winesap, Cortland and Jonagold apples.  Made exactly as directions state.  I did cook an extra hour to reach the desired thickness.  Got rave reviews from all who had tried it.  Will be giving this as Christmas gifts this year.  Thank you for sharing!!

I couldn't imagine using that much sugar, not if I wanted to personally eat it. So I dropped it to 3/4c unpacked brown sugar, and it turned out great. My apples were of a sweeter variety to begin with.

I made 2 bathes this weekend!! It's great and so easy, the hardest part having to peel and slice apples--not hard! :) I used fugi apples and only 3 cups of sugar, I also used apple pie spice. I cooked it for about 12 hours on low and uncovered it and cooked on high another 2-3 hours so could thicken up! It's great!!

The apple butter turned out terrific.  After reading many other reviews, I used 3 cups of sugar instead of 4, but I also added a little honey. 

I had never made a jam before, so I learned how to preserve jams/ jellies by using the water bath method.  I just put the little jars of apple butter into a boiling pot for five minutes.  It was easy and fun!   What a great autumnal gift they make.

This was by far the best apple butter I've ever made!! I used a variety of apples and a little less sugar.  I cooked it for a bit longer so that it was less runny and then used an emersion to make it smooth.  Delicious!

This apple butter is DIVINE!!  I made it exactly as the recipe states, and I used Cortland apples that I ordered in bulk.  I used about 20 medium apples, and it made 4 pints of apple butter.   I can't wait to try this with another kind of apple!

My husband's family always makes apple butter. This year we thought we'd give it a try. Between this recipe and the family one, it turned out really good. We did the apples like the recipe said. We added 1 cup of sugar free grape juice. We then stirred in 3 cups of sugar and 2 tsp of cinnamon. Cooked the way the recipe said. I made it over night, getting up once to stir. Turned out really good. Had enough for 3 pint jars and 3 sandwichs! Will be making again next year!

I cooked my apples on the stove first until they were like chunky applesauce. I blended it with a stick blender and then I transferred into the crockpot for a couple more hours until it was thick.  I also added a little nutmeg and ginger.  I cut the sugar down to three cups. By cooking it first it took a lot less time.

Fabulous Apple butter. We live in WV and are very familiar with good apple butter. Normally, true apple butter take many hours of cooking in a copper kettle. Most families make it an event. This is easy, easy, easy! The taste is great. It took ours less time and I halved the sugar content. I used Winesap apples from my father's trees and it was still sweet. Hats off to the originator of the recipe.

I used about half the sugar called for and I cut back a bit on the cinnamon (allergies in the house)... I also used my stick blender to blend up the lumps near the end of the cook time, then let it cook for another 30 mins or so on high. Quite yummy! Thanks for sharing!

All I can say is "yum-mee", never thought I could make apple butter from scratch but it wasn't hard at all.  I did subsitute half the white sugar for dark brown sugar and it worked out great.

Delicious!  I used 1/2 peck of Jonathan apples for my apple butter, with 2 cups white sugar, 1 cup Splenda, 1/2 tsp cloves and 3 tsp cinnamon.  I did have to let it cook for quite a while (4 hours) with the lid off for it to reduce, and it probably could still have gone a little longer.  I then ran it through the blender for increased smoothness.  I'll be making apple butter all the time now!

I used a 4 quart crockpot and filled it to the rim with diced apples. I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, I forgot to add the salt. This was delicious!!! I will be making this every apple season.

This is just wonderful! We live close to an orchard, and have a few trees in the back yard so I was just looking for ways to use all these apples up and this is it! I made half a batch the first time, canned it, and then my in laws came over and I have none left! Making a double batch now and hopefully will be able to at least freeze some for myself before the rest is gone. Guess I know what everyone is getting for the holidays!

I followed the cooking instructions more than the amounts listed for the ingredients. I filled my crock pot and could only get about 3 lbs, and then added a 1/2 cup white and a 1/2 cup brown sugar. The reduced sugar was plenty sweet enough. It turned out great :) I canned it in 4 oz jars and am now giving it away to everyone I know.

yum yum, yum!!  I can't stop eating this stuff straight off the spoon. sooo good.  did cut the sugar by 1 cup, so glad I did bc it would have been way to sweet otherwise. Next time I think I will actually cut the sugar by 2 cups.

Great recipe.  I tweaked it a bit by cutting the sugar by a cup and used a mix of brown and white sugar.  I also added a 1/4 cup of honey and a 1/2 cup of Pinot Noir to give it a umpf.

Simple, easy, no-frills recipe! I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 only because I made it and didn't need any sugar at all - if I'd added any sugar I would have had to throw it out. I would recommend adding in all your spices, cooking it up, and then adding the sugar a little at a time as you think it needs it. Will definitely make this again!

TO DIE FOR! no changes made. Cooked in the crock pot. Blended in my blender once finished (for a very fine, non-apple sauce like consistency.) Tastes AMAZING!!!!!
I have not received a negative (or even NEUTRAL) comment about it yet!!!!

Best apple butter we've ever had!  Used a combination of Splenda and sugar in a 3:1 ratio.  Will be making regularly!

This is the best! and so easy! I used 5.5 lbs gala apples, minced using a "slap chop" device, and did not alter the sugar measurments. I did add a bit more cinnamon and cloves and also add a bit of allspice. This was cooked on high for an hour and then on low covered for about 6 hours. I added about 1.5 tbls of vanilla and then left to simmer(simmer option on crockpot) during the night(about 5hrs). In the morning turned back up to low for an additional 2 hrs and then left uncovered to finish for 4 more hrs. Then I put it in blender to blend the little peices into a more smooth texture (worked wonderfully) did a waterbath can, and the end result was about 3.5 pint size jars of heaven!! it is SO good! will def. make again and again!

Absolutely perfect!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used two different types of apples (some tart green apples and some red delicious).  After peeling and coring them, I ran them through the food processor so that they were very finely chopped.  

I stirred the mixture at least once per hour and didn't have a problem with anything burning in the crockpot.  When it was almost finished, I used an immersion blender to blend everything for a nice, smooth texture.  I found that the very last step where you leave the lid off the crockpot and let the mixture cook down required a much longer time than given.  I let it go for at least three hours and it could have maybe gone a little longer.  

I poured the mixture into sterile jars and canned them in the pressure canner for about 10 minutes (same as for applesauce).  

The end result was a smooth, kind of thick texture and a stunning deep red color (not like the "peanut butter" color in the main picture on the recipe page).  It has been delicious on homemade scones.  One thing I noticed is that the scent and the taste were a little different from each other.  When I tasted it, it didn't taste exactly like I expected based on the smell.  Still absolutely delicious and very, very easy.  This one is a keeper!

Excellent recipe, although I did cut the sugar in half- the Gala apples I used were already sweet enough. I used this to make the Spiced apple cake on here- used inside the batter and on top of the cupcakes... tasted fantastic!

Autumn is quickly becoming my favourite season. Reason being,  I love using traditional recipes that celebrate this time of year. Not much tops the humble apple. Pies, cakes, dumplings, Betty's, crisps and Ohh the aroma of homemade cider warming on the stove. With prices low right now I took advantage and bought a few bags of MacIntosh apples to give this apple butter a go. I don't often toss superlatives around lightly but this  recipe is the exception and well worth every little slice of apple painstakingly prepped. McIntosh apples are known to be crisp, a little sweet and yet a little tart. A good choice as the added sweetener can be adjusted to suit varying preferences. I used 1 1/2 cups in the first batch and just over 1 cup in the next. I love to taste the tartness so for personal use I will keep trying a little less till I find my ideal amount.  Yes, unless you own an apple peeler (the crank-able kind) it does take some time to prep all the apples. Next time I'm armed only with my old fashioned little handheld peeler, staring at all those waiting ruby beauties, I'm going to invite a couple of friends and make a day of it. As the slow cooker does its magic, you are in for 11 hours of aroma splendour. Intoxicating!

I made this with Honeycrisp apples after my kids got a little overzealous at the pick-ur-own orchard.  I used 2 cups of sugar and it was OH SO SWEET. (I'm a dessert girl, so this usually isn't a problem!) However, I was hoping to use it on a turkey and brie sandwich...... I don't think it would work in that situation, but it was delicious as a spread on muffins.  I found it very spicy in a good way ( I added nutmeg) and nice and thick (I cooked it with the lid off for three hours as an oversight, but it worked!)  I think with the appropriate apples and still less sugar this recipe would be perfect!

This is one of the best apple butter recipes I have ever tasted. We love it! I only had about 2 1/2 pounds of apples (after peeling and coring) and adjusted the servings and followed the recipe. The smaller crockpot that I used for this cooks very hot, even on low. The whole process was complete in approx. 9 hours. After taking the lid off the last hour, I used a whisk and it worked perfectly resulting in a smooth, dark, very flavorful apple butter. I will be making it again very soon. The first batch is almost gone! Thanks for sharing!

The only diappointing thing about this recipe was that it didn't make enough for my large family.  :)  Very good!!!  I didn't have ground cloves on hand so I used nutmeg.  It worked out fine and tastey!

So listen, I'm about to make my fourth batch of this stuff and I bet I've gotten to eat less than a tablespoon of each of the first three batches.  I think I like to make it with 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and I think I like to mix my apples 1/2 Granny Smith and 1/2 whatever is handy.  I also think I like to add a pinch of Allspice.  Notice that I say I think...  I never get to eat enough of it to know for sure.  I'm making a bigger batch this time and after I run the jars through the canner (don't know why I bother, it never lasts that long), I'm going to hide a couple for ME!

Awesome! The only thing I changed was I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and cut the sugar down to 2 cups; 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I found I didn't have to cook it as long. Perhaps it was the type of apples. I just used the apples in my yard. My husband hates apple butter but loves this!

I am a HUGE fan of apple butter, and this recipe is the BEST I have ever tasted!  Like others, I used Golden Delicious apples and cut way down on the sugar (1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup dark brown sugar).  I also added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp. of allspice.  I put the chopped apples through my food processor, then used my immersion blender to break up any remaining apple bits toward the end of the cooking time.  The result was silky smooth, nicely thick, richly spicy and oh so heavenly.  I will never buy apple butter from the store again!

I liked the balance in flavor for this recipe. I made alterations. 1. I first simply quartered and cooked the apples in water. 2. I strained the apple juice through cheese cloth. I then used the juice to make Candy Apple Jelly a recipe submitted by All Recipes' Betsy Porter. The remaining pulp I ran through my fruit strainer so it was smooth. I finished the recipe as directed here and obviously reduced the cooking time. I was happy with the results and have much product as a result of my labor. I have 11 jars of Apple Butter and 8 Jars of Candy Apple Jelly perfectly set and sealed ready to be given away as gifts. Not bad for only 5 1/2 lbs. of apples.

Like always I read alot of reviews before I began as I always find it helpful.  I used Fuji Apples, I had almost 5#.  Used 3/4 cup each brown sugar, white sugar and splenda.  Used rounded measurements of the spices.  I think it should be called all night apple butter since I started it at 8pm, next morning at 9 I turned it up to high, took lid off and cooked another 2 hours. Then used stick blender to smooth it out.  VERY VERY GOOD!!!

Oh so Yummy, this is the very best,I made two batches with two different apples, and they both came out wonderful. I only used three cup brown sugar, which was my only change, and I did that only for a more richer dark color. 10 stars....

Good! Fills a crock pot.  Makes 4 pints, I used a food processor to smooth out.  I used the full 4 cups of sugar , and Jonathan apples.  I also canned the pints in the pressure cooker so that I could store on the shelf rather than in the freezer.  Also i used a apple peeler, corer, slicer to prep apples, then just had to chop the slices into smaller bits, very easy!

I loved this recipe.  It was easy to do without having to stay with, like others.It was the first time I have ever tried making apple butter.  The only bad thing was, I didn't have enough to go around.  It only made four 1/2 pints.  The next time, I will have to double the recipe.  You can also put the jars in a canning pot & let them boil for 25 min., take them out,let the the seals set & put the jars in a cool place.  This way you don't have to put them all in the frig.

I'm making this for the second time by request.  My husband talked for days about how great it made the house smell.  Now I'm making it for Christmas gifts for teachers.  I love to serve it warm over brie cheese.  It's delicious on crackers that way.  Thanks!

Love this recipe! I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and increased the amount of spices. Extremely easy to make and the house smelled wonderful! I'm giving jars of apple butter as gifts for the holidays, this year.

This was so wonderful tasting. I also added less sugar and it was still sweet. My 9 year old son helped me make it. I might peel and grate the apples the night before so it makes it easier for this busy mom to make next time. I only let it cook about 7 hours and it turned out great. I canned them in 8 - 8oz. jars and had a little left over. My 1 year old son loves it on his toast. Nothing says it is the holiday season better then this apple butter.

We have a couple yellow transparent apple trees in our backyard. The apples are a bit on the tangy side and made wonderful apple butter.  I wasn't certain how many apples made up 5-1/2 lbs so I filled the crock pot almost to the top. I cut the sugar in half - down to 2 cups - and added same amout of spice as given.  It turned out great. My mom is diabetic and loves apple butter. Though I gave her a small jar of this I am going to try making a batch with Splenda and see how it comes out.  Really really good and was fun to make.

My husband made this recipe last year and was upset because he couldn't find the recipe this year. Once again the wife came through.  He followed the recipe as written using wild apples picked from our yard.  After placing in sterile containers and the jars popped to seal they were stored in the pantry.  Refrigeration or freezing was not required.

Made this last night after a day of apple picking.  I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions and cut back the sugar by half.  I cut the apples in a very tiny dice and let them cook in the crock pot overnight.  The next morning (about 11 hours later) I pureed them with a handheld blender and left them to cook, uncovered for 1 hour more.  Really delicious.  I had to cut the recipe in half in order for it to fit in my crockpot.  I ended up using about 9 cups of different types of apples.  Going apple picking again next weekend and will definitely be making more!

This was the first time I had ever tried to make apple butter and it was soooo easy.  It turned out great, even my mother in law raved. I cut the sugar down to 3 1/2 cups and added nutmeg. I will definately make this again and again....

I made two double batches of this to freeze, the kids love it on their toast in the morning (it's been 2 months and they have yet to ask for something different).  I did cut back the sugar and diced the apples in a food processor to make the process quicker, and a hand mixer really made it smooth in the final step.  I'll make this every year.

I think this recipe deserves 5 stars just for the sheer genius of employing the slow cooker - having spent many an afternoon babysitting a pot of apple butter to make sure it didn't burn or splatter my stovetop and kitchen counter, it was *so* nice to be able to load the apples into the slow cooker, set it on low or warm, check on it and stir it occasionally, and know I could leave it for a few hours on warm if I wasn't ready to can it yet.  The slow cooker and my hand-crank apple peeler/corer/slicer gizmo have made it super-easy to turn my backyard apples into yummy apple butter.
Here's what I did:  peeled/cored/sliced enough apples to fill my cooker (probably about 5 lbs), added 2 c sugar and 2 tsp cinnamon, and set cooker on "warm" overnight.  In the morning, checked on it, stirred it, turned heat up to "low", kept it simmering, tasted to see if it needed more sugar, turned it back to "warm" when I had to leave the house for a couple hours, came back, alternated heat settings between "warm" and "low" and stirred occasionally until it looked ready to puree with the immersion blender, then let it continue simmering with lid off, stirring occasionally, until it looked thick enough for canning.  And by this time the apples have concentrated down enough that the splashes from the thick bubbling apple butter are contained within the walls of the slow cooker.

This is the best apple butter recipe EVER!  I cut the sugar back to a total of 2-1/2 C. using 2 C brown sugar and 1/2 C white.  I hit it with my immersion blender to get it smooth and silky.  This beats my old recipe where I had to cook the apples down with apple juice, then puree in the food processor (which never got it as smooth as this one), then put it back in the pot to cook for hours.  I start this one at night, and by the next morning I'm ready to finish and put up in jars.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I have tried this recipe before finding it on the web; but I never used sugar. hum; wonder why or what makes the difference. Any ideas, all are welcomed. Also wonder if I add a little pectin if it would give it a bit of a "jam" texture? I made this again last night and used 1 1/2 cups of sugar & 1/2 cup of honey. The consistency is great. Looking forward to ideas on the pectin, thanks.

I have been using this recipe for about 6 months now, every time I have a bag of apples that is about to have to be thrown away, I pull out the crockpot. Family and friends rave about it, and have gotten to where they request more!

I just bought a home that has an apple tree and I have no idea what kind of apples they are, but they're small, red and quite tart.  Still, I used half the sugar, and used equal parts brown and granulated sugar.  I also used 2 tablespoons pumpkin pie spice in place of cinnamon and cloves.  Rather than the slow cooker, I cooked this in a heavy saucepan on medium heat for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.  Then, I reduced heat to simmer and covered, cooking for 8 hours, stirring every few hours. Then, the last hour, I cooked the apple butter uncovered and allowed the liquid to reduce until almost completely gone.  I used an immersion blender to grind up the peel (I never peel my apples for apple butter and my immersion blender makes it a non-issue).  This apple butter turned out like a caramel, spiced candy apple butter and it's DIVINE.  This recipe inspired me, though clearly I didn't follow it at all. lol  Enjoy - this would make great holiday gifts. :)

Used twice. Best apple butter in the world. My one friend said it was like a drug. She couldnt stop eating it. I use brown sugar. I think it makes it thicker and richer. Im making some for Christmas gifts this year.

I used 1 cup Of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar and that was plenty. I made two batches - the first batch I followed the cooking directions and it took 13 hours. The second batch I cooked it on high for 70 minutes on the beginning with the lid on, them 6 hours on low with the lid on and then 2 hours on high with the lid off. Came out great.

Having a big box of mountain apples to use, I decided to make this recipe yesterday. It is fantastic! Once the initial chopping is done, it is nice to just throw everything in the crockpot and let it cook all day.It is also nice that the recipe calls for ingredients I keep on hand, no trip to the store necessary. I did place the apple butter in jars and processed for 20 minutes in a canner in order to keep on a shelf instead of freezer. Nice way to make gifts for Christmas, etc. Thanks for a great recipe!

AMAZING! Use a variety of apples it completely cuts down on how much sugar your going to have to use.I cored and skinned my apples, spray them lightly with lemon juice and let sit on counter, I cooked skins in my roaster on 350 with a half a cup of water for two hours. The threw out the skins and threw in the apples WHOLE cooked them with half of the sugar it called for and substituted nutmeg for the ground cloves. Cooked for about 15 hours at 250. Put in food processor and then back in the roaster for another couple of hours.  If your mix seems runny just take the lid off but stir every 15 or so.
We made this for a fundraiser bake sale, we sold out! and everyone keeps asking when Im making it again. Thanks for the great recipe!

I used 1/2 cp brown sugar, 3/4 cp white sugar, 5 oz. apple juice, 1/8 tsp cloves, 1/8 tsp salt & 1/2 tsp allspice, cooked about 20 hours total, mostly covered.  Use a potato masher or immersion blender to get a smoother texture. I used 3 lbs McIntosh, 3 large Gala apples.
Delicious!

This was so easy!
I've made it with the half the amount of sugar and another batch with no sugar (using very sweet apples - I can't for the life of me remember the type).
At the end of the cooking time I blended it until smooth and it was perfect.

That was great! I used Jonagold apples because that is what I had at home, and wow was that good. I cooked it all night and blended it with a hand blender to get a smoother texture at the end. The whole house loves it!

This is super uber good. I burnt the first batch but that was my fault. The 2nd batch took 28 hours but it was well worth it. Everyone has loved it! Great to give as gifts!

Super easy.  If your apples are sweet, it doesn't need so much sugar.

MMMMM...I love this apple butter. I folowed the recipe and by the end it was way too sweet. So I added a few tablespoons of lemon juice and cooked it a bit longer. Then put in my blender and poured it into jars.  It turned out perfect then!!!!

This was my first try at making apple butter and this did really well.  It was easy to fix and I seasoned it to my taste.  I started with one cup of white sugar and one cup of brown sugar.  After it cooked all night, I added one more cup of white sugar.  I used cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger since that is what I had as far as spices.  I am going to try it again soon!

Love this recipe! I made 3 batches-two regular and one sugar-free(used Regent apples). Cooking time took much longer than the recipe says to get it thick enough. But other than stirring occasionally and using an immersion blender to smooth it out once the apples were soft-I left it while I slept and went worked. I used less sugar than recommended (1 1/2 cups).  I chopped the apples in the first batch but after that I left them quartered to save time since I was going to blend it smooth. Also, once it had reduced enough to get into my smaller crock pot I transferred it so I could get another batch started.
I grew up eating apple butter and had never found a recipe that was as good as I remembered until now :)

This is so easy!  Made a double batch in my large oval All-Clad crockpot.  At least 6 additional hours of simmering on low with lid off after blending with the stick blender.  Used half the amount of sugar and added an extra tsp of cinnamon.  Total of 4 cups sugar and 5 tsp cinnamon for a double recipe.  All other ingredients as written. Fantastic!  Made 6 pints when doubled.

OH MY GOODNESS!  This is sooo good! I had 30 lbs of fresh, North GA apples so I've made 3 batches of this.  The 1st batch was Fuji apples  (already sweet) but not knowing how much sugar to use I used the full amount...very sweet but still GREAT & we can spread it thinner.   So good I made two more batches using Granny Smith. The sugar balanced the tartness to perfection for me!  The final hour of cooking didn't reduce to the right consistancy but that's okay... it'll be just right for  pancakes & waffles!

I am rating this 5 stars b/c I thought it was delish, but I changed it up a bit.  I used 5 lbs (that was the only size bag I could find and just went with it) of Granny Smith apples.  I cored, peeled, and ran them through the food processor, then threw them in the crock pot w/ 1 cup white sugar, and 1 cup brown sugar.  1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and about a half tsp pumpkin pie spice.  I omitted the cloves b/c I hate them, and just eyeballed the salt.  I cooked on high for 1 hr, and then low for probably 6 hrs, stirring occasionally, put in the fridge overnight, then cooked on low all day the next day, again stirring occasionally.  I put in the fridge w/ the thought that I might finish off on the stove today but when I took it out the consistency was how I wanted it.  This made enough for five 8 oz jars, and then enough for a couple of biscuits today!  YUM!

I used 3 kinds of apples, Gala, Honey Crisp and Golden Delicious.  After I cleaned and cored them I had about 4-1/2 pounds of apples so I cut the sugar to 2 cups.  I think when I make it again I will increase the sugar by 1 cup.  It is still very good but I think my family will expect it to be sweeter.  I cooked it on high for the first hour then another 15 hours with the lid on then 3 more with the lid off.  Then I used the whisk attachment on my hand mixer and mixed it for a minute.  It is a beautiful rich dark brown and am very happy with the result however it only made 5 half-pints.  I will make it again but would make several batches so I could share some.

I had my doubts on this recipe, but it's a 5 star winner!   I used Arkansas Black apples which were a little on the sweet side, so reduced the sugar to 2 cups.  Also left it to cook on slow for close to 13 hours.  Seems like one of those rare foolproof recipes!  Has just the right tang and sweetness.  Almost too easy!

Mostly good, but WAY too sweet!   I used 3 cups sugar, and it was still too sweet - I added some fresh lemon juice to counteract the sweetness and that helped a lot.  It may be because I used regular eating apples and not tart pie apples (like Granny Smith).  So....I would suggest that you start with half the called-for sugar, then test it halfway through the cooking time and see if it needs more.  
I also added more spices because I like my apple butter with a bit more spice.  This is a great springboard recipe as long as you ease up on the sugar and add it as needed.

This was excellent, I had made two previous batches on the stove (essentially same ingredients) I threw the previous apple butter out. It was bland and very light colored....this slow cooking recipe was REAL apple butter.

I did cut the sugar back to 3 cups it was great!!!

I followed the recipe just as it is.  I used Cortland apples cut into small pieces, but the pieces never turned to mush.  Now I know this is a great pie making apple, as the pieces will keep their shape!  Soooo, after the apple butter had slow cooked for 11 hours, I put the apples through the food mill.  Soupy!  So, I put the apple butter in a shallow fry pan on low heat, and let it steam away for 30 min to evaporate all the apple juice from the Cortland apples.  PERFECT!!

This was a great recipe.  HOWEVER do take into consideration the sweetness of your apples I didn't and had to through my first batch out becaue it was too sweet for me and that's saying something.  I used half the sugar the second time around and it turned out great.  I was using honey crisp apples and they are very sweet so do keep that in mind!

This is pretty good!  I reduced the sugar by half as many others did and probably could have used even less.  I also subbed 1 cup of white for brown sugar, added a few teaspoons of vanilla, and used a pumpkin pie spice blend since I didn't have ground cloves. I think this would have needed a longer cooking time to come to the desired consistency, I left mine an extra hour with the top off and it still had liquid left in it.  I used a mixture of McIntosh, Macoun, and Empire.

I wanted to thank you for this post! I did cut the sugar to 1 cup of white, 1 cup of brown sugar, and a 1/4 tsp of allspice.

It was delicious and so much fun! I've actually posted my adjusted version on my blog! Please check it out:

I made this recipe with Asian Pears, and it turned out Awesome! I used Cinnamon and Chinese Five Spice and let it simmer in the crock pot for about 36 hours. At this point I returned the contents back into the food processor, which totally smoothed everything out. Another 5 hrs in the crock pot without the lid. I'm starting another batch tomorrow.

I have made this recipe for three years now. I do change it up a bit. I use 2c white sugar and 2c brown sugar. This gives it a dark rich flavor and look. I also use a hand emerssion blender to make it smooth. Then I can the jars so I can enjoy it all winter long. Apple butter is great in pancake batter, cakes or ontop of anything! My family gobbles it up! The aroma in your home will be amazing!

Excellent recipe.  Been using this recipe for three years now. 

I load a 6qt crock pot full of peeled/minced crab apples (roughly 8 lbs...half of a 5ga bucket).
Using the recommended sugar a touch of extra cloves/cinnamon, cook as recommended, and zap it with the submersible blender until smooth(ish).

Hot, sterile, jars and 15 minutes in a hot bath canner and it's good to go. I get exactly 5 pints to a batch, and am on my 4th batch this fall so far and still haven't caught up with family requests.

Living in New Zealand, I miss and crave apple butter. And this recipe was so easy and so simple. And tasted so delicious. I did have to use a whisk to get the apple bits broken down a bit, so think I will chop them finer next time. Disappeared rather quickly after telling my friends about apple butter and letting them taste it, so next time will make a batch just for myself!

This was AMAZING. Addictive, actually.

The only annoying part is the prep. If you don't have tools that make the breakdown easy, it's a long, slow, tortuous process to peel and core and cut the apples. The end result, however, was completely worth it.

First of all, you DO NOT NEED TO PUREE THE APPLES IN A FOOD PROCESSOR beforehand. This is only more work than necessary. There is a reason why the recipe calls to WHISK the apples when they are near done... they literally fall apart into smooth applesauce consistency pieces (ie... no chunks will remain. if the apples don't just disintegrate when you whisk them, your butter is far from being done!), ... then you just cook out the remaining moisture! Also, I upped the cinnamon a bit, put in cloves about the same (I didn't measure it, just guessed) and added a bit of allspice, nutmeg, and ginger... AMAZING... spicy sweet apple butter!

By far one of my favorites! I used Macintosh and granny smith apples and used 2 1/2 cups of white sugar and 1 cup of light brown sugar! I stirred frequently and it was amazing! I am from Pennsylvania dutch land and this is better than anything I have ever had. Thank you!

This is wonderful. I had 6 pounds of Honey Crisp apples that I peeled and cored. I let it cook overnight in the slow cooker. After cooking, I put it in the blender to puree even smoother. I got 3 and 1/2 pints with just a tad left over we had  for breakfast that morning. I canned it in a hot water bath for 10 minutes. Should make a nice gift for some folks this Christmas! I am already planning a second batch while the apples are in peak season. Thank you for posting!

I'm so glad I tried this as I now know I'll be making more throughout the holiday season.  Whisking really helped break up the apples to produce a smooth consistency.  Like others, I opted to reduce sugar by half and used 1c brown, 1 c white.  Since I didn't have cloves, I used pumpkin pie spice in its place. Oh, and since I didn't have quite 5 1/2 pounds of apples, I used some organic pears for the remaining amount.   This is soooo good!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I took the advice of cutting the sugar in half...and I even added more apples as they cooked down...came out with a really nice blend of sweet and tart as I used tart green apples.  I also let these start cooking overnight and then all through the next day....turned out great!

In order to get the best end product, you really do have to cut back on the sugar. I made this with half Granny Smith and half Fuji apples. I added only 1 cup of sugar. The finished butter had the perfect sweet/tart flavor you want in apple butter. Had I used all four cups of sugar, it would have been sickeningly sweet. Reducing the amount of sugar does give you less finished product. I got 3 cups.

First time making apple butter.  I followed directions exactly, except halfed recipe and forgot to adjust cloves so it turned out pretty dark and very spicy.  My kids absolutely loved it though and were eating it like apple sauce.  This can just be made to your own personal preference as far as spices.  I even canned it which I've never done and that was pretty easy too.  Just sterilized jars and lid and then gave it a 10 min. bath.  Sealed up great.  The halfed recipe gave me only 1 pint as it cooks down a lot.  Will be making again for sure, thanks for the idea for gifts too!

I just finished my 4th batch of this delicious and easy stuff!  Thank you for sharing, Terri.

I also wanted to pass along a serving suggesion that I've always enjoyed:  For breakfast...or anytime...cottage cheese topped with apple butter on a toasted English muffin.

Delicious!!  I was in the canning mood this week, made one jelly and decided to find something 'new'.  This recipe is easy and so yummy!  I used Bradburn Apples and 1 cup each of brown and white sugar, cloves and cinnamon as listed.  Sweet, but without diminishing the delicious apple flavor.  Cooked 1 hour on high, 10 hours on low, 1 hour uncovered and stirring several times with a whisk.  Then to get that creamy texture I used the hand mixer and whipped it on low for 3 minutes.  Perfect with just a tiny bit of texture to the smooth buttery spread.  I will be making several more batches to use as Christmas gifts!  Thank you so much for an unbeatable recipe!

I peeled & chopped 2 bags (3 pounds each) of McIntosh apples. I had a Pampered Chef apple/peeler/corer/slicer that made that chore MUCH easier.  Finely chopped the slices and my crock-pot was full.  I used a scant 4 cups of sugar, 2 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, & 1/4 teaspoon fresh ground cloves.  WOW, the whole house smells like apple pie.  After cooking all night, I used a hand stick-style blender to puree the mixture (very easy).  It is absolutely delicious.  I can't wait to try it on yeast rolls fresh from the oven!  Thank you for a great recipe.

My oh my is this tasty!  I used Gala apples (WA apple board recommends Gala for sauces), cut the sugar to 1/2 the amount and used both white and brown sugars, and used heaping measurements on the cloves and cinnamon.  Cooked for around 14 hours.  Will make again once I have one of those power peelers or can con my teenager into peeling for me!  Cored and sectioned, then put sections in one of those chop wizard things for very small pieces.  Did run through food processer to smooth out, but maybe an immersion blender will work as well.  Thanks for sharing, an AWESOME recipe!

This recipe is amazing. I have made it twice now and its great. It takes a whole day but makes your house smell like cinnamon and apples. I reduced putting one cup of white sugar and 3/4 cup of brown sugar and I used a wisk at the very end to make it xtra smooth. It still had tons of flavor and delish texture. I put it in small mason jars and give it to my friends. I will keep this recipe forever.

This recipe is perfect!  I sometimes shorten the cooking time depending on how my apples are coming along. Be sure to use your largest crock pot for this one.  I like to use Jonathan apples for this.  After about 8 hours of cooking, I use my immersion blender to puree the apple butter.  Then I let it cook for another hour or so with the lid off before canning.  These make great holiday gifts!

Very good. Chopped the apples into small dice and used a potatoe masher on them as they cooked. We like it a bit chunky. Also, cut down the sugar, used 1.5 cups. Added 2 T. of butter and 1 t. of vanilla extract at the end of cooking. Taste was very good. Thanks.

I have made several batches of this wonderful, versatile topper and love the compliments. I use half the sugar and extra shakes of the spices. It's great for toast, PB sandwiches, gifts, ice cream, pork chops (adds a taste of fall), etc. Thanks for sharing, Terri!

Fantastic recipe! But 2 words: Food Processor.  It took me about an hour to peel, core, and finely chop 15 apples.  I was doing this late at night and didn't want to wake the kids using the food processor, but next time, I will be using the processor instead!

I didn't have any cloves so I subbed with allspice.  I also cut the sugar back to 2 cups, and used Fuji and Granny Smith apples.  Next time I will add nutmeg and try some other varieties of apples.

I used a heavy duty wire whisk to smooth it out some after about 8 hours of cooking.  After it cooked with the lid off for about 2 hours, I broke out my hand mixer and zapped it for a few minutes.  I then sterilized some mason jars and put it in those and sealed the lids while it was all still hot.  I don't have a canner to process them in, so I know that it will have to be all used in a few weeks or frozen.  Either way it would be worth it! 

Definitely using this with some pork tenderloin.  Yummy!

I haven't yet had a chance to cook Apple Butter in the Slow cooker but have cooked it on the stove several times and will be trying this method today.  I have a recipe from Martha Stewart that is a bit more decadent.  I use 6 and 1/2 pounds of apples, 1 cup of apple cider, 2 tbls of Calvados brandy, a cinnimon stick, 1 tsp of ginger, 1/2 tsp of cardamom and nutmeg, 1/4 tsp of mace, some cloves, 1 cup of sugar and two tbsp of lemon juice. It is to die for and the brandy gives it a little kick. I'm planning on following the same cooking directions in this recipe but using the M.S. ingredients.  I hope this is helpful to others.

5 stars would have been difficult to give had I not read all the reviews suggesting to cut the sugar down to two cups, but I was very happy with the end result.  A great way to use the abundance of apples Fall brings.  I crocked it for 24 hours, then put the handmixer in the crockpot to "cream" it.  Not a lot of work.  I yielded 4 1-cup (margerine) containers which is in my freezer waiting to be used on the Apple Butter Pork Loin (this site) for a holiday gathering.  Nice to have on hand.  I wish I had doubled the recipe!

This recipe is GREAT! I give jars away as Thanksgiving and Christmas gifts. People as if they can get them at other times of the year. It's perfect for canning. Last year people said it was good BUT somewhat grainy and lumpy like applesauce. So, this year, before uncovering the butter to thicken, I put it through my blender in batches and got it nice and smooth.

What a wonderful, easy recipe!  I also made this thinking I would give some as Christmas gifts, but now I know I'll be making another batch before then!  I used the standard recipe and it turned out perfect.  I also used a food processor for blended texture. 
I've never made apple butter before, but will again!

I used a food processor to reduce the cooking time.  Actually took only 6 hours although I did use a wire wisk every hour.  All but 1/4 cup of sugar was replaced with one cup of honey so it would be ultra low fat.  Finally I added 1/4 cup of grand marnier .  Everybody loves it.

I've made this apple butter for the last 2 years in October.  It is the best I've ever had!!... Of course I tweaked it a bit to my own taste...but it is a wonderful base recipe!!  My tweaking was cooking it longer.  The longer you cook it the more dark and rich it becomes.  I can't imagine a "fall" without this apple butter! :-)

I used 1c white sugar and 1c of brown with a little under 6lbs of apples. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. Turned out unbelievably good - my 3 and 4y/o request it on toast, pancakes, ice cream, waffles, anything they can think of! This is my first and only apple butter recipe. Thanks so much!

Very sweet!! I like to make a recipe as written the first time and then I will change it to our tastes. Wonderful flavor, just too sweet, and needed way more time to break down the apples. I ended up putting it into our Magic Bullet to puree then put it back into the crock to thicken. Will definitely make this again though! Put it into the crock the night before and let it cook away while you sleep and even continue while you go to work. Longer does not hurt the recipe.

I made this last night and it was wonderful!  We started with Golden Delicious apples from our neighbor's tree that were on the sweet side so I cut the sugar to 3 cups and I'm so glad I did... the entire amount of sugar would have been way too sweet.  I also omitted the cloves as I didn't have any, but grated in maybe 1/2 tsp fresh nutmeg.  I started with a full crockput and after 12 hours the mixture was reduced by about half and nice and dark and thick.  Cooked for another hour with the lid off and ran my immersion blender through it.  Made 8 half pint jars.  I still have 4 bushels of apples left on my table so I will definitely be making more.  It beats any apple butter I've ever bought in a store and aside from all the peeling and chopping, couldn't be easier.

I screwed up and thought this was the recipe I had made earlier this year! I had it all in the crock pot before I remembered that the recipe I like called for Brown sugar not white sugar. I made it though and it was WAY too sweet. I am so bummed because the kids and I were giving these as Christmas gifts. I also go a lot of liquid in the end and could only make 4 out of 6 jars...I don't usually give a negative rating but using Brown sugar makes it so much better.

I used this recipe to get started on my own method, but I do a couple things differently: 1) No sugar needed for me! (Hello, apples already have a ton of it, so I don't understand everyone's need to add it, but I guess that's just me. I like it more spicy and nuanced.) 
2) When it's done cooking in the slow cooker, I set a big mixing bowl in the sink, set a fine mesh strainer on top of that, and slowly pour the apples from the crockpot so that the apple pulp stays in the strainer and the bowl catches...you guessed it: concentrated apple cider! I put the apple butter in a bowl and blend till smooth with my immersion blender. The 'cider' can be kept in a container in the fridge and when you fancy a cup of cider, pour into a mug about halfway full, and add about the same amount of water (or 2/3rds) and heat up!

I just made this yesterday for the first time.  It was so easy.  I made mine with a mix of Gala, Granny Smith and Jazz apples.  After reading some reviews that recommended a mixI thought I'd give it a try.  Well it was a good recommendation!  I also added a little bit of allspice and vanilla.  I did cut back on the sugar because there are diabetics in this home and really I'd rather taste the apples not the sugar.  I made mine in a 3qt crock pot so I couldn't make the full batch but that was no problem.  I used a half cup white sugar and half cup light brown sugar.  I found that it was not necessary to use a food processor or blender.  I just used a whisk when I stirred it and then for a few minutes at the end right before I jarred then. It was very smooth. I put them in a water bath for just about 15 mins.  I will definitely be making apple butter again using the basics of this recipe.  Would definitely recommend this for a beginner or a pro.

i did this recipe in slightly less than half version (because i don't can) with a variety of apples i've collected from my food co op the last couple weeks. i was worried about it burning in the crockpot, but it did well.  i used a little less sugar than called for, cooked on 9 hours for low, which ended overnight.  my crockpot automatically stays on "warm" for another couple hours.  when i woke up in the morning, it was perfect!  i didn't even need the uncovered hour.  i think my crockpot, at all levels, runs hot though.  very thick and delicious, will use on toast and stir into my 2yo's oatmeal.  thanks for the easy easy recipe!

FIRST TIME making apple butter and my husband who is a "Apple Butter Snob" said it was the best hes ever had!!! I used brown sugar instead of white sugar. Also added apple pie seasoning, about 1/2tsp and 1/8 of fresh nutmeg.

I am very pleased with this recipe.  I did cut the sugar in half, thinking I could add more after tasting if I thought it necessary, and I did not.  I used one cup of white sugar and one cup of brown sugar.  I do not care for cooked apples, so I am not the best judge for the taste of things like this- so I had my boyfriend try it, and he ended up getting a little bowl and having a couple of spoonfuls straight up!  I have canned the rest to give as gifts, and I am getting ready to start another batch tonight before I go to bed.  Thanks for a great recipe Terri :)

This was a very helpful base to start from for a first time apple butter baker... maker... whatever... I use gala apples, and as they are so naturally sweet to being with I reduced to 2 cups of brown sugar (brown simply because I like it better). I had to let it cook quite a bit longer with out the lid and added more cloves and a bit more cinnamon for more bite.

Overall, this seems to be quite nice and it's extremely simple to make. Looking forward to hear back from friends and family about how they think it is.

This is awesome!  Never knew it was so easy to make apple butter.  I cut down on the sugar by a cup and it was still plenty sweet.  We like a bit more spice so I added more cinnamon and I put it in the blender to smooth it out after it was done cooking.  This is an excellent recipe that I am sure we will use every fall.  I canned plenty so we can enjoy it all year.  Thanks for posting!

Really good apple butter!  I didn't know it was so easy to make, yes it takes a long time, but worth the wait!  My family and I went apple picking last weekend so I have been looking for new apple recipes, and this one is really yummy.  The apples I used were already really sweet, so I halved the amount of sugar, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I have jarred some and will be passing it out to my family this week.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! I did add cider and started it on the stove top at first then trasnsferred to the slow cooker. I wanted it smooth so I went at it with my stick processor. Ended up making another dozen jars to give away as Christmas presents.

I made this with golden delicious apples from my little tree in my back yard. My husband said WOW! I did what another reader did and added a little more spices and I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup sugar (my apples were pretty sweet). Turned out great! I'm getting ready to can the butter to have all year long.

All I can say is YUM!  I got a late start so I started them on the stove top, but it was delicious never the less!  Canned it up and gave what I can't eat myself to friends for the holidays.

Very very good recipe.  I had no idea that apple butter was so easy to make and so glad that I am able to share it with my friends and family now (since many of them don't even know what it is!).  Like everyone else, I cut the sugar WAY down to a cup (I used Gala apples).  I like apple butter more spice-flavored than sugary, so I added a touch more cinnamon and cloves as well as allspice and nutmeg.  Also like another reviewer I canned them in a waterbath canner for 30 minutes so it will keep   for longer.  Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe!

I never knew it was so easy to make apple butter! This is delicious. I used less sugar - about 2 cups and I also added some allspice.

This is a great recipe! After me making it the first time i realized how sweet it was making it with that much sugar. This time when i made it i used 12lbs of apples and only 3 cups of sugar using the red delicous apples. It made 12 (1/2 pint) jars. I was very pleased with the results this time! Will be making this alot!

I didn't weigh my apples or measure any of the sugar or spices. I just did it to taste. It came out amazing both times I made it! I used fresh picked apples of several varieties,peeled and cored, and cooked them in my crockpot for several hours. After they were mushy I mashed them with my potato masher and added the sugar and spices to taste. The first time I made it, it cooked for maybe 24 hours, and came out a light brown in color, similar to spiced applesauce. The second time it ended up getting cooked for almost 2 days and came out a rich chocolate brown and smelled amazing. I canned it all up and it tastes delicious on everything! Thanks!

I made this for a "crock-off" and won 2nd place! It is delicious, but as other reviewers said, very sweet. I highly recommend a food processor to chop 5 pounds of apples, it took me forever!  I cooked it for 11 hours overnight and then took the lid off and cooked for three more hours to get a thicker consistency.  Excellent recipe!

This was really good and soooo easy.  I did take some suggestions and modified it a little bit.  I have no idea what kind of apples I used because they were from our tree and they were planted before I moved in.  But I used 15 apples, 1 c white sugar 1 c brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice (to lazy to find my ground cloves).  I did cook it all night, when I stirred it up in the morning the apple chunks on top got much smaller.  I used an electric mixer to smooth it out.  I canned it in a hot water bath for 15 minutes (partyly because I'm pregnant and didn't want to worry about what my trees might hold).  I got 3 12oz and 3 8oz jars.

I used 1/2 Granny Smith and 1/2 Braeburn apples. I used 3 cups of sugar and had a little less than 6 pounds of apples. Next time I'll use 1-2 cups of sugar because the apples had great flavor alone! FYI: THIS RECIPE YIELDS 5 CUPS.

I started this off in my slow cooker before I left for work. It smelled funky when I got home, like hot apple sauce which is...not a good smell. I let it cool down once it finished though and it is delicious! It's like having an apple pie on a piece of bread.

Awesome.  I chopped the apple but next time would shred it.  No big deal because I pureed it at the end and the taste was great.

FIRST TIME TO MAKE APPLE BUTTER AND I WAS AMAZED. Before this recipe, I've only tried apple butter at Cracker Barrel and I was disappointed. Now that I've  made this myself, I've changed my opinion about gross apple butter.

I followed the recommendations to use less sugar and my apple butter wasn't sweet.  And even with tiny minced up pieces of apple it still seemed more like apple sauce than apple butter.  I'll keep hunting...

I have been using this recipe for years and it's always a hit.  I wanted to mention that I sometimes will leave the peeling on and then run it through a sieve.  It gives more vitamins and more texture.  just make sure to use organic apples!;)

Amazing!  I'm not a fan of apple butter, but my husband is, so with a surplus of apples after apple picking this fall I decided to make this.  This recipe is not only delicious but incredibly easy!  After cooking, I put the apple butter in 1 cup gladware containers and froze them and they come out of the freezer tasting as good as out of the crock pot!

I have never made anything like this before. I had no idea it was so easy. I peeled the apples completely, cored them, and chopped them in the food processor. Then, I dumped them in the crock pot and added the spices that were recommended by a reviewer (cinnamon, cloves, pumpkin pie spice) and I used a little less than three pounds of apples and a little less than 4 cups of sugar. I cooked it on high overnight for 6 hours then 10 hours on low and maybe a bit longer than that on low. It came out great. I chilled it overnight in containers and we had oven baked biscuits this morning and they were wonderful. I am considering learning how to "can" them to make them for holiday gifts. TFP!

I've been using this recipe for a while and it is FABULOUS!  I had a hard time finding good apple butter in my area, so I decided to make my own.  I'm so glad I did - I'll never go back to the store bought!  Use a food processor to finely chop the apples and it will go much quicker.  I use about half the sugar listed because otherwise it is way too sweet for us (and I have a sweet tooth).  Taste and then adjust sugar if needed at the end of cook time.  A lot will depend on how sweet your apples are.  Thanks so much for a super recipe!  :o)

We were lucky enough to receive an entire truck load of apples from a friend's apple tree and after making apple pie's galore, I was happy to try a little something different.  Being able to put all of this in the crockpot and walk away was the key to this recipe.  I rendered my apples down into applesauce, threw it in the pot with some sugar and spices and the next day we had about 16 pints of apple sauce.  I'll definently be making this again with our next bunch of apples!

If only I could give this more than 5 stars!  I grew up on orchard made apple butter and have NEVER found a store bought apple butter that even tastes good.  This is fabulous!  I used golden delicious apples and reduced the sugar by half, then used half brown/half white.  Chopped the apples in the food processor.  Put it all in the crockpot before going to bed.  Ended up cooking it for about 14 hours with lid on and another 4 or so without.  After lid off I stirred with a whisk every hour or so and the consistency was perfect.  We got 6 half pints.  My husband swore he didn't like apple butter until we made this. This will definetly be made often at our house!

I gave this a four star because I changed the recipe a little. I only used 1 cup brown sugar and it was plenty sweet for our tastes- I could not imagine putting anymore in. I used red delicous apples so maybe that is why less surgar was good, next time i won't put any sugar in it. this recipe was delicous, better than store bought and much cheaper too.
thanks for haring.

Thanks for such a wonderful recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I did differently was once the apple mixture was done cooking in the crock pot I did pour the mixture in a pot and finish the cooking on the stove top. It was taken much to long to thicken with the crock pot. Once the mixture had cooked down I poured into jars and gave away as gifts to my Mom and Sisters.

This was good. I did read all the reviews about how sweet it was so I only added 2cups brown sugar and 1 cup of white and it was still too sweet(for my liking). I added a little lemon juice to cut the sweetness.
I will make again with even less sugar.
I made this again and only added 2 cups sugar and 1/2 t. nutmeg. Flavourful, but still too sweet. I'll have to try again with even less sugar(darn).

I absolutely loved this recipe.  I read through the reviews and followed what some of the others had said.  I used Granny Smith apples and used the blender to smooth it out.  I'm glad I didn't peel the apples.  I plan on making quite a bit of it, in the coming days.  Giving this as Christmas gifts is going to be nice. 
My 2 year old really loves it, I spread some cream cheese on a soft tortilla and then spread some of the apple butter on top of the cream cheese and roll it up.  Its a great snack!

This was a really delicious apple butter. I first tried to make it with apple sauce baked in the oven and it was good but when i got my slow cooker I decided for the "better" kind. And it was SOOOOO much better! It took FOREVER to chop, core, peel, etc. and after about 13 hours and the apples were still chunky I decided to experiment and put them in my blender. It worked beautifully. I bought a food processor and am in the process of making my second batch (of 4) for jars of apple butter for Christmas presents. Also, I used 2 cups packed dark brown sugar and 1 cup white granulated sugar, and along with the spices in the recipe I added about 1 teaspoon of ground ginger. My husband LOVED it. Thanks for the recipe!

I used about 6 lbs of Mutsu apples, one cup white suger and one cup brown sugar and let them cook about 24 hours.  I then used my electric mixer to get a smoother consistency.  I ended up with 9 250 ml (1 cup) jars.  I scraped the sides of the pot to get enough for a slice of toast for myself.  Yummy.  I want to make one more batch to hand out with loaves of bread or muffins as Christmas gifts for family and friends.

Simply wonderful.....I made this for holiday gifts this year and will be putting a homemade cinnamon pancake mix to go with it.  The only thing I added at the end of cooking was a couple tablespoons of butter.

So, I admit... I don't know what I'm doing.  I'm new to the whole canning thing, and really, REALLY wanted to make this recipe to give as gifts (I'm pregnant and nesting).  The apple corer/slicer/peeler is a must.  But in leu of a food processor, I put my apples in my juicer.  Turned the apples into pulp, and added both the apples and the juice to my crockpot (can't get much smoother than that).  I used really tart apples 'cause it really is a lot of sugar.  Add an extra shake of cinnamon.  And I let it cook all night, stirring it only when the baby kicked me awake to go to the potty.  :)  What a surprise this morning!!  Mmmm... the jars are in my pressure cooker now (first time using that too).  Hopefully, it'll vacuum those jars the way it's supposed to.  The recipe made 11 1/2 pint jars for me.  And I've asked for a food processor for Christmas.  Awesome recipe!

This is wonderful and doubles as a marvelous room freshenner.  My house smells like autumn!  I followed some of the other review suggestions and used half brown sugar and half splenda in place of the white sugar.  I also used an immersion blender (after it was cooked) to make it smooth.  This recipe is great, the spice balance is very nice!

My husband asked me to find an apple butter recipe for him, and I went with this one.  He is thrilled with this recipe and uses it every time.  The apple butter comes out just the right consistency, with a good balance of apple and spice flavor.  We love it!

This is such an easy recipe! I definately recommend getting an apple peeler/corer/slicer to prep the apples, it saves so much time. While I was preping the apples I soaked them in some water with lemon juice so they wouldn't brown. I did cut down the sugar to 2 1/4 cups and kept the other ingredients as is. I did get 8 half pint jars filled. I will be freezing these and giving them as Christmas gifts. This one's a keeper!

I took other reviewers advice and cut the sugar in half for sweet apples (4 cups must be for tart apples).  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  The apples did need smoothed out quite a bit near the end but that was easy to accomplish.  The end result was fantastic!  I have given several jars as gifts and they were all very well received!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

This is so yummy.  I grew up going to the Cracker Barrel, having biscuits and apple butter.  I can now make it at home!  I put it on before I go to bed, wake up and ready to can it!  I give them away as Christmas gifts, accompanying the cinnamon pancakes in a jar!

Excellent recipe.  I used golden supreme apples, so I used less sugar than called for.  Apple butter turned out a very pretty color and tasted wonderful.  Love the ease of this recipe.

This is by far the best apple butter that I have had since I was a child and my grandmother made it with fresh picked apples. I cooked mine on a very low setting, so I increased the cook time to 14 hours - It is well worth the wait. This has become a staple in my frig. and my children ask for it.

I used 1.5 Cups of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and added allspice and extra cinnamon the first time I made this. It turned out too sweet and the spices were too much for me. So the 2nd and 3rd time I made it I used only 1 cup of white sugar and used the amount of spices that the recipe calls for, it turned out WONDERFUL!!! YUM YUM YUM!!!!

This is great and very versatile.  However, I tried to cut corners and didn't peel or core the apples first like some suggested, and I will not skip that step the next time I make this!

I'm giving this a 5 for ease and technique, but a 3 for proportions.  I love aple butter but it is very time consuming to stand over the stove for several hours over hot sputtering apples, so when I saw this recipe I knew it for me!I read a lot of the reveiws and I'm glad I did. I stuck to my old tried and true recipe for the spices which was 2tsp cinn,1tsp cloves,1/2tsp allspice, 2tsp lemon juice. My cookbook also recommends 1/2 cup sugar to each cup of apple pulp which turned out to be about 2 1/2 cups ( I decided to use just 2 ciups of sugar though because we dont like really sweet) I didnt peel or core the apples, just rough chopped them, cooked on high in the slow cooker for 2 hours until soft, mashed with a potato masher, then I strained out the seeds and peels by pouring into a colander and smushing it with a wooden spoon, I wound up with about 5-6 cups of apple pulp. I put it back into the slow cooker and cooked as directed on low for about 10 hours, then 1 more hout with the lid off, turned out to be about 5 cups of finished apple butter, which we had on toast this morning. I will make it again but I think I will cook it down a little more next time so it is a bit thicker.

Was making gifts for Christmas and doubled the recipe.  I cored the apples and cut into pieces then cooked on the stove (in some apple cider).  I put apples (peel & all) through the food processor and then simmered in slow cooker for about 21 hours.  I cooked the last 4 hours uncovered hoping for some evaporation (wasn't as thick as I'd like).  I think the thickness issue was my fault for using too much apple cider when I cooked them on the stove.  I added extra spices...1/2 tsp allspice and a dash of nutmeg.  Only used 5 cups of sugar on the double batch.  The flavor is excellent!  Made 10 quarts and a little leftover for us to use on Sunday dinner tomorrow.

I made this recipe and it's just wonderful!  I did not go to all the work of  peeling  my apples tho, I washed them, cut them into quarters and then put them into my dutch oven, added about 1 cup of water and 2 T. of lemon juice, covered, and brought to a boil... turned them down and simmered or cooked slowly until apples were done.  Then I ran them through my seive. I did not measure the weight of the apples, I just filled the crock pot up with apple sauce.  After I had my applesauce, then I added Splenda blend and the spices.  I added according to taste, a little more cinnamon, and about 2 cups of splenda blend. The sugar amount really depends on how tart your apples are, so if you have sweeter apples, don't add too much sugar or splenda! It also is a personal preference as to how sweet you like your apple butter. I"ve got my 2nd batch going now, been cooking all night. I put my first batch in 1/2 pint jars and boil water bath for 15 minutes. All sealed almost immediately after removing from canner. Great recipe, and sure nice not to have to worry about scorching it. Thanks so much, you've made my life MUCH EASIER!

Although I didn't use this exact recipe, the one I used was very close. If you have a food mill, it makes it a lot easier. You don't have to peel the apples. Core and quarter them, then cook on stove with a quart of apple cider per 4 quarts of apples for about 1/2 hr, stirring occ. Put through food mill, then put in slow cooker with sugar and spices. I slow cooked mine for apout 18 hrs - made it nice and thick.

I have made several batches of this apple butter and it gets rave reviews every time.My mother said as soon as she tasted this she threw her other jars of apple butter out. The only thing I did different from the recipe is that I used several types of apples from very sweet to granny smith.

Awesome recipe!  Added 1/2 cup maple syrup for a different flavor, & everyone loved it!  Great topping on ice cream too!  Next time will try some brandy.

Excellent recipe! I've never made apple butter before, but this turned out so good. I used half the sugar as previously recommended, and it is plenty sweet. I used a variety of apples: Mutsu, Empire, Golden Delicious and McIntosh. I think maybe if I had used really tart apples, I may have needed the additional sugar, but next time I will cut it even more...maybe 1 1/2 cups if I'm using the Golden Delicious again, as they are very sweet. I'm on my way to get some vanilla ice cream to pour this over while it's still warm!

Note: This does cook down alot. I started with a full crock pot, and it's now about 1/4 full. Wish I could figure out a way to make more at once!

Half the fun of this great fall recipe is buying the apples! We bought ours while spending a day in the mountains,  then made a Sunday project out of preparing them! If you have a handheld blender, you will not go wrong. We now have Christmas gifts that will mean so much more than something "off the shelf"!  Easy and delicious!

Mmmmm! I'm going to make this on a regular basis, just for the smell in my kitchen when I do! I nice flavor; even though I used half the suggested amount of sugar.
We used a variety of apples that were lying around; Macintosh, Gala, Granny Smith, Golden Delicious and a couple of unknowns that we had... but it's good no matter what! Kind of a mutt, if you will! Like others have said,  you can't cook it too long... also, I used my hand blender in the slow pot after about 6 hours, just because I was getting impatient that it still didn't *look* like apple butter!
My first try at apple butter, and certainly something I will make again!

I used only 3 cups sugar, added in 1 Tablespoon of Maple Sugar,and 1/2 tsp. of Nutmeg. I blended half of the cooked mixture in my blender for a finer, smoother texture, then added it to the lumpy cooked other half, and it won me a Blue Ribbon at a local fair competition!Thanks for a great base recipe Terry! :-)

WOW!  I've made many jams before, but had never tried to make apple butter.  This was so simple and it turned out GREAT!  I added a little extra cinnamon and cloves (and threw in some nutmeg), but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as written.  This is a "keeper".

This was my first attempt at anything like this and it was GREAT!  My husband was very pleasantly surprised, and went back for seconds! I used only the 2 cups of sugar recommended by so many, and pulled out my single drink mixer that one person suggested, and it worked GREAT!  Broke up the apple chunks before the last hour was up, and it turned out WONDERFUL... I definately recommend this one!!!

Yikes...I wasn't sure what to expect but I hoped it would be something like what they serve at Cracker Barrel Restaurant's. It came out like "jam" and a bit too spicy with the cloves and nutmeg (which was recommended by other reviews, I also used 3 cups of sugar since I love sweets but still it was too sweet. So, overall the outcome in itself was ok (probably by my own mistakes and set expectations). I had to eat my toast with butter spread along with this recipe. I guess all apple butter it suppose to be that way since eveyone else loves it...I've just never had it before except a restaurant!!! Any tips to make it more creamy or milky like butter???

I had some apples that were past there prime so I made this apple butter.  I used Gala and Granny Smith because that it what I had.  Turned out really good.  I tried it on the Cinnamon Bread from this site and WOW!  Now I need to figure out some more uses for it, it made a lot.  Thanks for a new way (for me anyhow) to use up apples.

I made this using red delicious apples and cut back the sugar to 3 cups and added 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.If you prepare the apples in advance, and cook this while you sleep, youll be in better shape, then wake up and do the canning part.Its time consuming and could use a little more time with the lid off, but terrific, great, wonderful---need i say more?

This apple butter was just WONDERFUL. I made it over night so the entire house smelled of apples and cinnamon!  My kids LOVE it.  My six year old can not stop eating it. 
I did only add 2 cups of sugar and I sprinkled it with nutmeg!  
It was GREAT!!!

Easy to make and very good.  I even cut the sugar in 1/2, and next time I may even use less.  The natural sweetness of the apples are just enough.

This recipe is not quick.  It takes at least 10 hours from start to finish and you
need to have a crock pot.  On the other hand, it is soooo easy.  The hardest
part is chopping the apples and that isn't even hard, just time consuming!
I am giving my 4 pints out as "Happy Fall" gifts.

First of all I am not a cook, not a chef. I always cooked because I had to.  Now that I am retired with no little kids, I have started making stuff.  I have learned so much on line. It has become my reason to go into the kitchen.  I recently received about ten pounds of apples, a lovely gift. But in time they would spoil. I never had apple butter, I tried it as a sample.  So I found this recipe.  My slow Cooker could only handle 3 lbs of large Delicious red apples.. I followed the recipe, except I only added 2 cups of sugar.  I also used a blender once everything was cooked.  I am amazed how good it turned out.  For me, it was like winning, a simple pleasure. I will make this again

We have made this several times now and we always get compliments! The only reason it gets 4 stars is because we have modified the recipe to our tastes. We fill a 6 quart crock to the brim with sweet-tart apples (like honeycrisp) and double the cinnamon, but keep the sugar at four cups. We also cook on low about 12 or 13 hours, and don't worry about switching the temp. We purée with an immersion blender at the end. One time wetried cooking on high at the end but it ended up getting too dark and tasted a little burned.

My kids and I made this to go with our lesson on Johnny Appleseed. This was very simple and came out great! We doubled the cinnamon, added allspice and nutmeg and reduced the white sugar to 1.5c and added 1c of brown sugar. Our crock pot would not hold all 5.5lbs of chopped apples, so we were only able to get about 2.5 pints apple butter after all was said and done. It did take about 16 hours for the total cook time.

The family really liked this, I only used 2 cups if sugar and it was still very very sweet (used sweet apples).  I diced the apples into thin small pieces and after 10 hours they still had not broken down, so I ran it through the food processor once it was done.Then put in sterilized half-pint jars.  Great Recipe, but next time I will use a more tart apple(and still 2 cups of sugar 4 v) and put them in the food processor before cooking.

Yes, I made this Apple Butter, twice, with golden delicious apples. Better than the other apples.

This is a great idea.  I made it with no sugar, no added sweeteners, but used a variety of mostly sweet apples. I made a much smaller batch, and it worked fine. I had to add water a couple of times, and did not need to uncover. I used a hand blender at the end to get the right consistency. So good and easy.

A family hit! This was my first time making (and tasting) apple butter so I went in blindfolded on this one. I used Figi apples and followed the advice of some other reviews to pop the apples in the food processor to remove any lumps. Cook it until you think it's done...then cook it some more. As long as it's in low you can't burn it and it tastes divine. I spread it on some homemade banana bread and it was heaven :-d

Great! Adjusted spices to my liking - left some peels in with apples - hint! Peel contains pectin which will thicken butter naturally - used stick blender after finished cooking - smooth as silk! Also sub some brown sugar fnstead of all white for richer flavor

This will be a family favorite from now on. I'm making it again. The only change I made was the sugar content cut in half. I did that on the first time and was perfect.

This turned out perfect. I cooked mine for a couple hours longer and still came out great. Next time I will use less sugar as it was just a little too sweet for our taste.

I've never been brave enough to try to make homemade apple butter before, but boy was this easy!  I will never buy store-bought again.  And what a great gift!  A cute little container with a bow and you're all set.  Delicious.

I filled my crockpot with two different apples, Granny Smith and Macintosh.  I sprinkled generously with cloves and cinnamon.   I used no sugar.   This is the second time I have made this recipe and my family loves it

I love the apple butter. My daughter made a mistake and added 1 tsp of cloves instead of 1/4 tsp. It was DELICIOUS. I've made the adjustment to make it like that from now on.

This was over all a good recipe but it was way to sugary for me. My kids on the other hand love it lol. I think next time I will only use half the amount of sugar or use more apples.

Used this basic recipe and added what I wanted. Used 1 & 1/2 C brown sugar and 1/2 c white sugar. Spices I used cinnamon, pumpkin spice & all spice. I don't measure that just do it to taste. Did keep it light with all spice. Also used hand blender to smooth. Filled a 6qt. crock pot let it cook part way down and added more apples. Large brown grocery sack full of apples - macintosh I believe. Tastes delicious/canned 14 1/2 pints.

I did this on the stove top. season as it cooked. one comment says the longer it cooks the better it tastes. this is very true. took me 3 days to cook. turning it off when i had to leave, and back on when i returned. day three i finished off the spices, then ran the "applesauce" type mixture through the blender. this made it very smooth. it was still thin. increased heat to a nice boil, stirring it every 15min to prevent burning. thickened just right! i started with two large stock pots full of cut apples. finished product was a little over half a large pot. reduction it the key. canned 11 1/2 pints and 5 pints.

DELICIOUS! I used Honey Crisp apples, so the butter was a bit too sweet.  My recommendation would be to reduce the sugar by 1/2 - 1 cup if you are using a sweeter apple.  I used a total of just over 5 pounds of apple AFTER it was peeled, cored and sliced, and used my food processor to shred the apples.  It make take longer than the last hour of uncovered cooking (took me 2), but you will know it's done when you put some on a regular dinner spoon and no liquid seeps out.  I canned mine using a 10 minute hot water bath.

Made this yesterday and all I can say is "Wow!"  I used Granny Smith apples and 3 cups of sugar, and I did add allspice like some others suggested.  I did not have to cook uncovered as it was really thick after the 9 hours on low.  This recipe is a keeper.  Prep takes some time, but I just sat peeling and cutting apples while watching Ina!  Life is good, and this recipe is great! Thank you!!

Its just too sweet. I used a bitter apple and only 3 cups of sugar and still way too sweet.  Also I couldn't get it to thicken good after 2 hrs with the top off. I will try this again but with a lot less sugar!

Too sweet. I get that it's dependent on the apples, but this was really overboard. You can't remove the sugar once you've added it, so I think the recipe should start out with putting half the sugar in, then saying to adjust two-thirds of the way through cooking time to your taste. I also added more cinnamon (about 1 tsp. more) and cloves (about 1/4 tsp. more) and a few dashes of vanilla.

This turned out great for me with no lumps and a perfect consistency.  I made the recipe as directed (but halved it,) and took the advice of others and halved the sugar.  However, by the time it was done I'm pretty sure I added proportionately the same amount of sugar as directed by the recipe.  I did not find this too sweet.  Thanks for the recipe!  I shoud add that I used 3 Grannie Smith apples and 2 Golden Delicious which may account for the reason we did not find this too sweet (because the apples I used were on the tart side for the most part.)

I halved the recipe because my crockpot would not hold all those apples. I followed the recipe using MacIntosh apples and all the sugar called for (it's very sweet so you can reduce if you want less-sweet).  After cooking on high for an hour, I used a stick blender to puree the apples.  After cooking for 10 hours on low, I removed the lid for one hour and got the perfect consistency.  I used the saucer test (put a tsp of butter on saucer, wait a few minutes, if no liquid forms around the butter, its good to go!)

I cannot say enough good about this recipe.  This was my very first time making apple butter of any type and this recipe turned out perfect for me.  I used approximately 70% Macintosh and 30% Granny Smith apples and the balance with 3 cups of sugar was just right.  I did it as directed. The taste, texture and color were perfect. I would heartedly recommend this recipe to anyone!!!!

This makes some mean apple butter! Despite popular belief, I used red delicious apples, most into their mealy prime, and then only 4 gala apples to make the 5 1/2 lbs. Being me, I also didn't have enough sugar, so I used 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, with all the same spice amounts as called for in the recipe. I started it at 3 pm on a Saturday, high for an hour, then low until 6 am the next day. Then I took the lid off and continued cooking at low until 11 am, until I felt that I achieved the correct consistency. I let it cool then gave it a good whirl in my food processor. It came out a delicious dark caramel brown. Yum! I also just spooned it into freezer canning jars and it made 7 half-pint jars. Having never ate nor made apple butter before, this is great! I might have to go make me some friends and give some away, or keep it for myself!

Absolutely delicious!  We followed the recommendations of other reviewers and halved the amount of sugar to two cups.  We also needed to continue cooking, uncovered, for an additional seven hours (step four took us eight hours, not one hour, to thicken to the desired consistency).

Definitely took a lot longer than listed, but probably more to do with the strength of my slow cooker and the fact it was my first try. Based on reviews, added some nutmeg. Used 2 kinds of apples, about a third tart and two thirds sweet, so cut back on sugar some. Delicious and am sharing with friends/relatives so I don't eat it all myself!

Love it! Best apple butter that I have ever had! I used a variety of apples I'd just picked and added a 1/4 cup brown sugar and pinch of all spice. I also mushed the apples with a potatoe masher when 3 hours remained whcih helped speed the process then I took it off about an hour early. It thickens as it sets in the jar. Definately recommend!

Excellent.  My first time to make apple butter - the only thing I'd ever done in jars before was pickles and so was a little nervous about my inexperience.  Well, I winged it. . .didn't have 5 1/2 lbs of apples - more like 3 1/2 - 4 lbs so I cut down on sugar ( I used 2.5 cups with 4 lbs apples and about 2 cups with 3 1/2 lbs and it was just right to my taste buds), kept all the cinnamon, salt and cloves.  Also, I weighed my apples AFTER I had peeled cored and chopped them up . . .not sure if I should have weighed them before?  This was a tough question for me because my apples from my tree are pretty small.  (3" daimeter on average)  It was soooooo yummy that I've made it twice.  As soon as my little apple tree spits out more apples I will be making it again!!!  Highly recommend.  Also, the first batch I let cook for about 20 hours - just got busy and couldn't get back to it but had read another reviewer that said the longer you cook it, the better it is.  Also, I used 1/2 pint jars and made 7 with 4 lbs and then 5 with 3 1/2 lbs apples. Next time I will buy bigger jars because it is so good that it doesn't last long around my house.  Friends and family love it too.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe Terri!  What a nice autumn treat!

This has been in my crock pot all day, and is delicious! Way darker than in the picture, but rich and warm tasting. It still needs to reduce a bit, I'm almost to 12 hrs. cooking time. I did take the apples out after 8 hrs and put them in the food processor to make a smooth apple butter. I'm happy I tried this and can't wait to make more for gifts this Christmas!

Exceptional! So easy - didn't have to strain or sieve anything. And I used a food processor to finely chop, so that went really fast. Added some Penzey's cake spice, too, and extra of the rest. Wonderfully spiced and delicious! I also added about 1 cup of apple juice and 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar, but that meant I needed to leave the lid off for around 1.5-2 hours, instead of just the 1 at the end.  Oh, so good!

Our favorite way of using all the apples our trees produce. The spice is perfect. It ends up lovely and thick from the slow cooking. Best of all you don't have to stand over the stove stirring! I've both canned and frozen this apple butter. Great either way. Serve it with pork roast. Yum!

GREAT flavor.  I used a food processor to shred the apples and saved a great deal of prep time.  Do not be afraid to let it sit uncovered longer in the final process to obtain the final consistency you want.  I let mine go 1.5 hours in the end and it came out perfect.  My clove was very fresh and I should have cut back just ever so slightly but as is it is fantastic.  Highly recommend giving this a try, espeically if this will be your first attempt at making apple butter.

This is the first time I've ever made Apple Butter the process was easy and the outcome rewarding. Great recipe. I changed the sugar only out of necessity as I ran out of granulated sugar. I used 2 cups granulated and 2 cups dark brown sugar. As far as I am concerned I will continue using both sugars. I liked the added richness and deep brown color. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This apple butter is amazingly good! And even better, it is amazingly easy to make. It definitely will take all day (I actually cooked it over 2 days, just putting it in the fridge overnight) but the results are worth it. I work in a German restaurant where we serve homemade apple butter with our bread, and this apple butter is soo much yummier than any I have ever had. I followed the recipe exactly, although I do agree with other reviewers that it will take much longer than 1 hour of cooking with the lid off the crockpot.

Great recipe!  Didn't use any sugar at all.  Apples vary in sweetness and the apples I used were sweet enough as is.  I will be making another batch this weekend:-)

My one and only gripe is that I followed the recipe and (minus the sugar) and it yield only 2 pints:-/

09/30/11: I have updated my rating to 5 stars.  I have been making apple butter nearly every weekend since my last post.  My mother-in-law suggested I fill my slow cooker to the rim rather than weighing the apples and that has helped me get to my 4 pint yield.

This was fantastic.  I am just letting the butter cool down now, but I did sneak a few tastes.  I did cut the sugar down a bit -- 2 cups of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar...and it was still very sweet (perhaps b/c I used super-sweet apples).  So, I just squeezed the juice from a whole lemon into it, and then blended the whole thing with my immersion blender.  The little bit of lemon juice didn't change the consistency, but did cut the sweetness perfectly.  Thanks for a delicious recipe!  Not only does this taste amazing,  but my house smells heavenly too!

I picked fresh apples from the orchard and I used 1/2 c. brown sugar and 3 cups of white sugar.  I also added a tad of ground ginger and a touch of fresh nutmeg.  Turned out great.  There were still a few chunks of apple, but I didn't feel like going through the effort to get them out.  The color was a deep amber and the smell is amazing.

I halved this recipe...so in turn, took about 8 hrs in the slow cooker as opposed to 10. Delicious, I definitely used nowhere near the amt of sugar called for though, would be entirely too sweet. My suggestion is to start out with a small amt of sugar and taste after cooking for a bit...you can always add more!

I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup and added 5 teaspoons of cinnamon.  HEAVEN. It took forever too cook but was so worth the wait.   I cannot imagine how sweet it would be with 4 cups of sugar.

I also reduced the amount of sugar to 2.5 cups and it was plenty. I put the cored apples with the skins still on into the food processor, and then transferred to the slow cooker. No need to mess with peeling or removing lumps later! Making my second batch today.

This is my second year making this and it  is once again a complete success! I made it exactly as written except I did not weigh my apples just filled my 6 qt crockpot about 3/4 full of peeled chopped apples and went from there. I hit it with the immersion blender after the first hour on high and it has a very nice texture that way. For the lidless cooking time (which I found to be more like 11 - 13 hours) I put a wooden spoon across the top of the crockpot and laid the lid on top of the spoon.  this allows the steam to escape but keeps splattering to a minimum. Thank you for a great recipe!

This is an excellant apple butter. Our garden club has made it and sold it for the pass two years to make money for the club. I prefer Granny Smith apples and I use a hand blender after it cooks to get it to apple butter consistency. I also make it with Splenda for those that can't have the sugar.

Excellent.  I think if I d were to do it again, I'd probably cut down the sugar (it's sweet like jam, which is not a bad thing, but I think I'd prefer it with less sugar), but this is a fabulous recipe to make your own.  The cooking method is spot on - you couldn't ask for better, tastier apple butter.

This recipe is delicious! I used very tart apples, from my sister's tree, so I did end up using the entire 4 cups of sugar. I think the reviewers who said they used less probably didn't use tart apples. Also, my cook time was WAY more than the recipe said. I cooked it covered on low for 10 hours, put it in the fridge over night, then cooked it on low UNcovered, the next day, for another 10-11 hours. I also put it in the food processor to make is completely smooth towards the end of cooking. Everyone who's tasted it has loved it. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe Terri!

Great recipe!!! I love apple butter and slow cooking. So this is a great combination. I took the suggestion of other reviewers and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 agave (had it on hand).  I used a mix of sweet (Gala, Johnagold) and tart (Harralson) apples, added allspice, nutmeg and vanilla in a 6 quart cooker. 15 apples were reduced to 1 1/2 pints. Next time I might add apples as they cook down. After cooking I used an immersion blender to smooth it out. It came out very buttery with just the right mix of spices, sweet and tartness. It did not last a week. Will definitely do it again.

This apple butter is out of this world!  I chose this recipe instead of another because I didn't have to buy expensive cider or juice for it.    I used half granny smith apples, and, for the other half, I used a mix of golden delicious, fuji, honeycrisp, pink ladies, and gala.  I cut the sugar down to two cups, and I'm glad I did.  It's the perfect sweetest and would have been WAY too sweet with four cups.  Also, I took another reviewers suggestion and used an immersion blender at the end of the cooking cycle.  It made the butter smooth & creamy.

Good apple butter!  I'd never made it before.  I used McIntosh apples, as that was what I had, and followed the directions exactly, just scaled everything down a bit to match one pound of apples.  I do think pureeing the apples would be a good idea - but it of course depends on personal preferences, if you like it a bit smoother or chunkier.  Doing it as written mine came out pretty much in the middle, not really chunky or smooth.

Definitely use 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup white sugar.  That was the perfect sweetness.  The recipe calls for too much.  Brown sugar is needed in a recipe like this and I love the caramelized effect.  My picky kids tore it up and asked for more.

I have made apple butter before, but never in my slow cooker. It is awesome! I love this on toast. It was easy to make and I like the fact  the process utilized my slow cooker. This is a great recipe! Remember to start early or overnight for best results. I also put in half pint jars and gave them a 10 minute water bath. Resulting in 6 half-pints.  This recipe is a keeper!

Made this last fall with crabapples that my husband brought home.  First, I cooked and drained the juice to use for jelly.  Then, I put the leftover mush through an old fashioned food sieve to separate out the seeds, cores and skins.  THEN I put the mush in my crockpot and proceeded with the rest of the recipe and canned it.  Lot of steps, but it was worth it in the middle of the winter!

I used about 15 apples (a combination of granny smith, red delicious, and another one..I forget which one lol) Processed the apples in the food processor before cooking....I also decreased the sugar to only 2 cups, added 1 cup of apple cider, doubled the cinnamon, and added some allspice.  It made 6 pints of butter.  I put it on before I went to bed.  In the morning, I took the cover off and cooked...and cooked....and cooked.  It needed another 4-5 hours of cook time to get it to the right consistency.  The next time I make I will put two knives on top of the rim of the slow cooker and then put the lid on; leaving a small space to let some of the steam out so there won't be too much condensation thus cutting down the morning cook time.  This was really, really, really good!  Don't be afraid if you haven't canned before, you don't have to can this...you can just put it in a jar and store in the fridge for up to 6 months.

OH MY GOODNESS!! This is wonderful. I have been making this all day and I just now put it in 8 oz ziploc round containers. My batch made 5 8 oz. servings. I spooned some out in a bowl and ate it. It is wonderful. I only used 1 and 1/2 cups of sugar and used 3 teaspoons of ground cinnamon..this is plenty sweet enough. I am a southerner and I like sweet things but I think 4 cups of sugar would be crazy sweet and possibly unedible. I used 3 different types of apples. % star recipe....will make again and again!!!!!!!!

This was really excellent. I love sugar, so I didn't alter the recipe, but I could see why people would cut it down and add darker spices. I stirred it every hour or so because I happened to be home. I cut the apples into little squares and it worked fine. I also have a smaller crockpot so that apples were overflowing, but when they got mushy it was perfect.

I've made this twice, once last year and once this year.  The first time I made this, I didn't know how to tell if it was done and stopped cooking too early.  This time I decreased the sugar by 1 cup as I used a combination of sweet/tart apples and did the "done" test as described by another review and it turned out great.  I did have to cook it for about an hour longer than the directions stated.

FABULOUS!! What an easy, no fuss recipe that is going to be in each holiday gift basket that I do this year!! Following the advice of other reviews, I made a few slight changes, adding only 2 cups of Splenda instead of sugar, and after cooking in the crockpot all night, I removed lid for a few hours and used an immersion blender right before loading my jars for the canner. Perfect texture, great recipe!! I'm already on batch #2!

I made two batches of apple butter from this recipe using Jonagold apples. Since these are slightly sweeter apples, I cut the sugar to just under 3 cups for the first batch, and it was still  a little sweet. Cut it back to 2 1/2 cups for the second batch and it was about right. The house smells SO good from these slow cooking. Great recipe!

This recipe is delish! The worst part is the peeling, coring & chunking up. I set it up about 8pm & take the cover off about 6am, then let it cook down for about 2 hours. Stirring it with a wire whisk really helps with the texture. I've done with all white sugar & half white/half brown. Both are awesome. Freezes well.

MMMM.. I used 6 large gala apples with 3 very small red delicious (it's what I had).  I only used 1 cup of sugar, 1 tsp of cinnamon.  Mine turned fairly dark after 18 hours in the crock on low.  The flavor and texture is 10 stars!!!

This is a great recipe!  I made it just like the recipe said with no changes.  It very good but also very sweet.  I think next time I will only use 2 c. of sugar.  I love the way it made the house smell!  It took about 13 hours from start to finish.

Like almost everyone else, I thought this was delicious! I have two crabapple trees and needed recipes to use up the abundance of ripe apples on them right now. I used 1 cup of Splenda and 1/2 cup of honey instead of sugar to eliminate the white sugar, and I always throw in a little extra cinnamon. Even my husband liked this, and that's saying a lot! I will definitely use this recipe over and over again!

My daughter loves apple butter, so I made this for her.  I was pleased with my first attempt, although it was a bit chunkier than butter.  I did mash the butter the best I could, but next time will either put in blender or food processor to get smoother.  After lid was removed it did take a while to get to desired thickness - longer than stated.  Even though I cut the sugar, will cut even more next time. House smelled wonderful while cooking. Will make again.

Wow, the sugar is way too much!  I reduced it to 1 cup, and it was still so sweet that my *kids* wouldn't eat it.  I think I might cook up some plain apples tomorrow and stir them in.  Otherwise, the flavor was good.

This is a nice simple recipe.  I have an apple slicer / corer / peeler that I use for this.  The kids like to "help" and operate it.  I do not peel them though.  I cook according to directions, but then at the end I run the butter through the blender and it turns to a spread.  This also takes care of the skins and the skins give it a deep color.

I canned this to use for all my Christmas gifts this year!  It is so yummy!  The only change I made was to half the sugar.  I think that with more tart apples I would leave the sugar, but the apples I used were pretty mild.

I recieved a ton of fresh apple from a co-worker. I had know idea what to do with them all untill I found this recipe. I used about half the sugar, I like it a tad tart. Wow! It was a big hit with my family and friends and I plan on making it again for the holidays.

This is a great recipe!  I modified sugar to 1 cup white and 1 cup brown as suggested by others and I thought it was still a little too sweet.  Next time I will probably only use 1 cup brown sugar, or none at all.  Also, I saved time by NOT chopping up the apples.  I used my PC slicer/corer and placed the wedges in the crock pot.  They cooked down to a somewhat lumpy consistency so I used a PC mix n chop to break up the larger pieces.  I expected to have to run it through the food processor since I didn't chop the apples, but I didn't need to. I used a combination or York, Baldwin, and Braeburn apples. This was an easy recipe and I will make again!

This is a great recipe. For all you reviewers in the sugar amount debate, that really depends on taste and the kind of apples used- even the year the apples were grown! I suggest you taste the apples first. If you are cooking it all day you can stop and taste every once in a while. I used un-peeled roma apples, 2 cups brown sugar, vanilla and doubled the spices. I left it on all night with the lid on and then all morning with the lid off. I ran it through the food processor and it was quite smooth. Next time I will probably process it in the morning before cooking it with the lid off to see if it helps with texture. Otherwise I'll have to peel the apples. All that said- we loved it!

loved the recipe. replaced the reccommended 4 c. sugar with 1 c. sugar and 1/2 c. honey. found this to be sweet enough. also probably used at least 3 tbs cinnamon. and added a tsp. each of allspice and nutmeg. took about 5 more hours than suggested in croc pot. finished on high instead of low. boiled jars in water to can after making, instead of refrigerating.

This is a very easy recipe to make.  I made a few adjustments to my own tastes as suggested by others.  Less sugar and less spice.  I also filled the crock pot with apples to make a larger batch.
Using my little salad oil battery operated whirler really helped turn the apples to a smooth sauce quickly and easily.

Great recipie, the spices are just perfect!!! I did cut the sugar down to 3 cups and used half brown and half white to add a little depth. Before the last step in taking off the lid I put it through the blender and this gave it the perfect texture, very smooth! Next time I'll try adding a few tablespoons of dark maple syrup, to give it a mapley taste. All in all it was a great recipie, I loved being able to leave it in the crock pot over night and the way it made my whole house smell wonderful! Thanks for sharing!!!

This was really easy to make and turned out very good. The apples don't have to be chopped up too small because they will cook down a lot. Next time I might use a little less cloves or cinnamon, or omit cloves completely.

I used Braeburn apples and left out the clove because I don't care for it. The apple sauce was absolutely delicious! My mother said it is was the best she ever had. It was a long process but well worth it.

I gave this a 5 because its a good base. But, after making this a lot for my father in law who loves apple butter, I've modified it. The sugar called for I believe is WAY too much so I use cup sugar, 1 cups brown sugar. You could probably even do less than that, depending on your desire of sweetness. I also add a little bit of nutmeg and up the cinnamon. 
This stuff makes the house smell so yummy.

Awesome Recipe! Used brown sugar, more nutmeg (because we really like nutmeg!), another teaspoon of cinnamon and allspice. I also left the lid off longer for extra thick, rich apple butter. Yum! Family loooves it!! Try it over Vanilla Bean ice cream. Yum!

Excellent recipe. Tweeked according to personal preferences concerning apples and spices. Slow cooking made the house smell wonderful. Cooks down a lot. Husband said it was the best he has ever eaten.

This was my first experience with canning and it went very smoothly. As others have suggested, USE HALF THE SUGAR (1/2 brown, 1/2 white), invest in an apple peeler/slicer/corer, and run this through the blender (or use an immersion blender) before canning. I used Gala apples as they are more flavorful than Golden Delicious IMO. U also used heaping teaspoonfuls of cinnamon/cloves and added some ginger and nutmeg. Cooking time is much longer than listed - probably closer to 14 hours. They only took about 5 minutes in a steam canner.

The flavor was delicious--way better than anything you can buy in a jar from the store. The only criticism I would have is that the consistency was a bit thin. I cooked it for 1 hour on high then turned it down to low for 10 hours then back up to high for 1 hour with the lid off to thicken. I used a stick mixer to smooth it out at the end. It's a little soupy, but still delicious.

This was so easy (besides the peeling and cutting of the apples) and worth it. It didnt make as much as I thought but it has so much flavor you dont want to use a whole bunch. I added a little brown sugar and apple pie spice to the mix but cut down the white sugar, adding as needed. Also using the whisk throughout the cooking process made it the perfect consistancy. This is a keeper:)

Very good recipe.....I used the apple corer slicer and then the food processor...leaving the skins on the apple slices.  Worked out great.  Very tasty (I used 3/4 of the sugar as my apples were not too sweet....)  Couldn't have been easier.  I doubled the recipe as I have a very big crock pot.  I ended up with 8 pint jars.  As suggested by another reviewer I put the jars in a hot water for 25 minutes....so now we'll have apple butter preserved and ready!  Thank you for a great recipe!

I'm a huge fan of apple butter and love it on top of cottage cheese so this was the perfect project when I had 6 extra pounds of apples lying around. I ended up using yellow apples (can't remember exactly which kind) which were already relatively sweet so I only used 1C white sugar and 1C dark brown sugar which was plenty. I food processed the apples first which made for a very nice consistency by the end. I used exactly the spice ratio in the recipe but would probably go for a little more cinnamon and maybe some nutmeg next time around. Cooked covered on low for 12 hours and then uncovered for another 4 until there was barely any water left.

We made it using 5 types of apples in one batch and it turned out beautifully.  However, we did cut down the sugar as others suggested.  We gave them as Christmas gifts -- what a yummy idea!  Thanks for sharing.

I don't eat apple butter but wanted to make this for my husband because he does. We bought some from the store (Organic) could not find anything else,and he did not like it at all, he said it was bitter.I made this with Red Delicious apples (6 pounds). I bought a 10 pound bag from Sam's Club - got on the scale and took apples out of the bag and placed them on the counter. When the scale reached 6 pounds over my weight I knew that it was the right amount/instead of guessing.I did use the food processor like suggested.It did taste sweet to me -I would say less sugar. I do not eat it so I can not say.It slow cooked for about 16 hours and my house smelled wonderful!!!!! My husband Loved this and said it was the best he has ever tasted. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

If I could give this 100 stars, I would.  I used 6lbs of Macintosh apples.  I peeled and cored them.  An apple/potato peeler works just fine, but I do suggest getting an apple slicer if you don't own one.  I used 1 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1 1/4 cup of white sugar.  It was plenty sweet for me.  I almost doubled all the all the spices and added 1/2 tsp of all spice.  I cooked my batch for about 20 hours.  Blending at the end (just before uncovering) is a must!  One batch filled 3 3/4 pint size jars.  I have made several batches!!  Thanks Terri- this is a keeper for sure!!  It's so yummy on ice cream, pork, and bread!

It is my second fall to make apple butter, and this recipe is much better than the one I used last year.  I'll be giving some of the apple butter away as Christmas gifts.  I used mcintosh apples and almost all the sugar (since the apples are tart).  I used my immersion blender to smooth it out before leaving the lid off.  It turned out perfect.  I only wish that it made more!  I processed it in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes (yielded one pint and four 1/2-pint jars).  Perhaps next year I will try doubling the recipe and cooking it on the stove since my crock pot will not hold any more.  Thank you for the wonderful fall recipe!

Only change made  was cutting recipe in half. I used 2 1/4 pounds empire apples. I did not remove skin, only cored apples. I put apples in food processor and pulsed until the apples were chopped small. Cooked 11 hours in 4 quart crockpot, worked perfectly.

great! I chopped the apples very finely in my food processor and left the peels on, double the cloves (because I love that flavor) used only 3 cups of sugar, and left in the crockpot for two or three days. Its great on vanilla ice cream! Especially when its still warm!

This is the best apple butter I've ever had! My husband and I made it together we had fun and it taste awsome. I jarred most all of it to pass out to our family.

I will make it again and it sure did get the house smelling great!

I have now made two batches of this recipe and it is wonderful!  The second batch took every bit of sugar called for, as I used MacIntosh apples (very tart).  I gave out samples at work and now have people begging me to sell them some - lol.  This is definately a keeper because I live in Maine and have lots of apples that I want to preserve.  Thanks for the wonderful idea of cooking in the crock pot.

Great recipe! I would adjust the amount of sugar, though. If the apples are sweet you won't need near as much as what the recipe called for. Overall, though, FABULOUS recipe!

I was so looking forward to trying this.  I usually make a baked apple butter but after seeing this recipe and reading all the rave reviews I thought I'd found a suitable alternative.  I'm sorry but I just didn't care for this apple butter at all.  The spices overpowered the flavor of the apples and the color was dark and unappealing. I won't be making this again.

I used 3lbs granny smith apples and 2 others that I had around. I put in all the sugar mix and it was in the crock pot for around 12 hours. Everyone loves it even my grandmother.

Great recipe.  I live in Honduras and cannot find apple butter for sale here. This is so easy to make and has a wonderful taste.  My house smells great for days.  If you want it thinner than a Jelly and more like Apple butter add less sugar.  The best apples to use are Granny Smith. This is my family's favorite recipe now.

This is a great recipe. I followed it exactly - except I used 1 tsp cloves, 1 tsp all-spice and 2 cups of sugar. (one cup of regular sugar and one cup brown sugar). About an hour before it was done, I spooned some of the warm apple butter onto vanilla ice cream. It was Very good! I'll definitely be making this recipe again. Thanks!

I made this recipe on the top of the stove (6 qt.heavy Dutch oven) and as printed but had to adjust the spices to my personal taste.  Also, I found that the 4 C of sugar made it too sweet for 5.5 lbs of Granny Smiths so I added 3 Tab. lemon juice to cut the sweetness. In the future, I will add only half the amt. of sugar and add more as needed.   I also added 1 more tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. ground allspice, 1/8 tsp. more cloves, and 1/4 tsp. ginger.  My husband and I both loved it!  Wonderful on hot biscuits!  Will make again and again.  It took me 2 hrs. from start to finish by this method, excluding the apple peeling.  Thanks, Terri!!!!

I used 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of apple pie spice (next time I'll try two of the apple pie spice).  I also used Splenda since I try to eat low carb and only used 3 cups because thats all I had left.  The results were AMAZING!! The finished product tasted like a candy apple almost.  I will say that I had to cook it MUCH longer than indicated as it was very watery.  Probably 16 hours with the lid on and about 2 hours with it off. It still was somewhat watery I'm not sure why but not  too bad.  I love it on low calorie bryers ice cream-incredible.

Love this recipe!  A friend gave me lots of apples, so I decided to try my hand at apple butter.  I "tweaked" the spices a bit and greatly reduced the sugar.  The result: not to sweet, thick, rich apple butter.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe, Terri.

This is really good! I used 7 granny smith apples, 2 large red delicious, and 5 very small gala.  The apple butter is very sweet but I like it that way. My apartment smelled so good all day long.  Also, during the times I was home I turned the cooker on high and stirred often to speed things up, then turned it back to low when I left.  That worked well and did not seem to hurt anything. I only did this when the mixture was thin though, I think it would burn if the mixture was thick. I will be canning this for christmas gifts this year.

I tried Splenda with this recipe.  I worked great & the same great taste.  Just add the same amount of Splenda as sugar and cook as directed.

Wow!  I used almost 6 pounds of medium sized golden delicious apples. This was so easy (besides not having an apple peeler/corer, I had to do it by hand..)  I cooked apples on high for an hour, stirred, and then cooked on low for another 10 stirring occasionally.  I ran the apples through the food mill to make very smooth, and then poured into jars.  The final product only made about 5 cups of butter, but still VERY VERY good!!  I would definitly make this again, over and over!

Tasty but almost too sweet. I used Red Delicious apples and the amount of sugar that the recipe called for since I wanted to make it first without any modifications. The next time I tried it, I used Granny Smith apples and cut back on the sugar, and half of the applesauce burned in the slow cooker. Not sure what I did wrong.. ? I'll be buying store bought apple butter from now on.

Very good.  I used Granny Smith apples (about 12).  After peeling the apples, I processed them with a food chopper.  Next time, I’ll try cutting back on the sugar by one cup.  Towards the end of cooking, I mixed with a hand mixer.  This made between 4-5 pints.

This is definitely a "5" star recipe.  I followed the recipe with the exception of reducing the sugar by half using 2 cups.  It came out perfect!  I will be making again and sharing with others so they can enjoy it as much as my family did.  I used granny smith apples from one of our trees and it made 5- 1/2 pints. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe! :)

Great recipe!  I added a little brown sugar which worked well with my tart, Cortland apples.  It had a great caramel-like flavor.

This was so good and my house smelled wonderful for days!  The type of apples I used seemed to change the amount of sugar I needed, although I never used more than 2 cups.  I doubled the amount of cinnamon and added about a tsp of allspice and nutmeg.  I even made a batch using Splenda instead of sugar and it also turned out great.  It was pretty chunky and didn't look as pretty canned up unless I blended the cooked butter before I canned it.  Messy!

This recipe is similar to one I have used for several years except I use cinnamon, allspice and ground cloves.  It is not necessary to peel the apples, just core them, cut them into pieces with one of those cutters that cores them and cuts them into about 8 pieces. Then cook until soft with a minimum of water. Then puree them with a stick blender until smooth. Then cook the sauce with the added spices in the slow cooker to the desired degree of thickness.

This was my first time canning anything and I was pleasantly surprised!  Thanks to an apple peeler and my food processor, it was pretty simple.  I cut back on the sugar and used a couple tablespoons of maple syrup (the good stuff from Vermont!) I added a couple pinches  nutmeg also.  I used a hand mixer to smooth it out at the end of the day before I began canning.  It turned out great!

Used a little more apples and a lot less sugar and cinnamon, actually cutting both in half. I  cooked it all day, cooled it and then reheated it the following day. I then canned it and it  turned out well.

One word - fantastic.  I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and used less sugar, a little more than half, and it turned out perfect.  For anyone who is going to process this in a canner for gifts, it makes 4 half-pints.  I processed in boiling-water canner for 15 minutes.  Does anyone have any tips for smoothing out the chucks of apple?  I tried using stick blender with little success. Thanks.

This is a really good recipe.  It really perfumed the house while cooking and smelled better than any type of air freshner.  I used winesaps and about 3 and half cups of sugar.  The amount of spices is just the correct amount and the color of the end result was perfect as was the taste.

I have a large crockpot so I doubled the recipe but still used only 1/2 the sugar. I chopped the apples in the food processor to avoid the blender step to make it smooth. I cooked it overnight and part of the next day before removing the lid for several hours to get the consistency I was looking for. The color was rich and the flavor was really nice. I make large amounts of butter as gifts and this process is just too slow in quantities. I will definately use it again when I don't need a ton of it as it was delicious, easy and my home smelled so nice!!!

WOW! I had never made apple butter before and this tasted like brand name quality! Thank you so much for this awesome recipe! I used golden delicious for the first batch and right now I'm making a second batch with Jonathan apples. The hardest part is peeling and coring the apples. To finely chop I just put quartered apple chunks through the food processor. After the 11 hours I used my hand mixer to make it more like the real consistancy. It worked perfectly. I also learned how to can (kind of) for the first time with this recipe! So easy! Thanks so much! Oh yeah, I also cut the sugar in half and it was perfect.

I used Braeburn apples, since that is what I could buy on sale at Costco.  They worked great.  I added 6 lbs of apples, cut the sugar to 2 cups and added 1/2 tsp of allspice.  I also used my handheld blender for shakes to smooth out the apple chunks (after the mixture baked overnight).   I loved the final taste of this apple butter.  I will make it again.  Thanks!

This recipe is the best apple butter recipe I have ever used! Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I did cut down on the sugar (I only used 1 3/4 cups) and I added a little nutmeg. I do like my apple butter with a little tang though. I also used Granny Smith apples. After it was done cooking I wisked it to smooth it out and it came out great! I will make this every fall for Thanksgiving abd Christmas presents!

This is my first review, but I just had to say thank you for a great recipe . . . and a fun Saturday.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for the timing of the last step; and it turned out perfectly.  I did let it cook down with the lid off for about 2.5 hours rather than one--mainly because I got side-tracked at a garage sale and by the time I got the canner out and the jars ready . . . ah well, it was Saturday.  But I think with my crock pot, it needed the extra time.  Now I want to try peach butter in the crock pot.  Anyone have ideas about the timing for peaches?  This was such  easy canning!

This smelled great while it was cooking, but it didn't get thick enough to be apple butter and I was left with chunks of apples.  I blended some of the mixture to get rid of the chunks, but that made it even thinner so I just decided that the bunch would have to stay chunky.  It tasted great.

I made this for my husband and I was planning on giving some away for Christmas presents.  Needles to say, my husband wants to keep it all for himself.  Very easy and tastey.  Will make again next year during apple season.

this was a good recipe.  I agree with cutting back on the sugar.  However, the apples did not break down into a butter consistancy like I had expected.  I zapped the mix in my food processor for a few seconds to puree the apples and give it a smooth texture.

I wish I had this recipe and a crock pot years ago so I didn't have to stand over spitting apple butter at the stove for hours.  Glad I read the reviews first.  2 cups of sugar was perfect.  The best apple butter I have ever made and the easiest.

Very good - I took other peoples suggestions to cut the sugar, glad I did, I had very tart apples, 1st added 2 c. of sugar then after cooking I added another 1/2 c.  Since my apples did not seem to cook down in other recipes I made I decided to steam the apples then press them thru a seive - that worked quite well.  I like my sauce a tad thicker so I think I'll put it on the stove for a couple of hours - My cook time in the crockpot was about 20 hrs.  I'm sure I will use this recipe again...very yummy!

It does not get much easier than this and the results are excellent. The first batch I used 3 cups of sugar and I thought it was a bit too sweet. The second and third batches I used 2 cups and that seemed just right for us.

I have made this for the last several years and it always comes out amazing! I’m only giving it 4 stars because I don’t make it as written. I half the sugar using a cup of white and a cup of brown. Otherwise, super yummy! A fall favorite and a great way to use up this apples we always pick too many of!

As many others have stated, the original recipe is pretty rich with sugar.  I used Mollies Delicious apples from my own tree.  This particular variety is sweet enough right off the tree that no extra sugar is needed.  Friends and family gave it rave reviews.

I made this per the recipe and found it to be VERY sweet. Next time I will start with 2 cups of sugar and add more at the end, if needed. Also, I used an immersion blender after the apples cooked down to make it a smooth, and even consistancy. Overall, it's a good recipe.

Made this using Jonathan apples.  While I hate changing a recipe the first time I make it, 4 cups of sugar sounded like way too much, so I reduced to 3, and used half white and half brown.  Finished batch was very good, but way too sweet.  Made a second batch, using 1 cup sugar, and then combined the two batches (meaning I basically ended up with 2 cups of sugar in a "regular" batch).  Final flavor was excellent!  Canned these in a hot water bath, and got 12 eight ounce jars.  First time making apple butter, and first time doing any canning ... kind of a fun project!

Used Golden Delicious. Absolutely perfect for flavor (sweet and mild tartness).  Also scaled back the sugar to three cups and nearly doubled the cinnamon and cloves. Otherwise, followed the directions to a tee and it came out spot on. Prep time takes a little bit longer than 30 minutes (closer to 50 minutes). Cubed the apples and it didn't turn out lumpy. HIGHLY recommend this recipe. Now to use the apple butter in homemade barbecue sauce!

Very simple (although time consuming to peel and chop that many apples) and tasted great. This was my first attempt at making apple butter and I plan to use this recipe again.

Fabulous flavor! I used mostly Jonathans mixed with a few Fuji and Golden Delicious apples. I chopped the peeled and cored apples using my food processor. About 2 hours before cooking time was up, I used an electric hand mixer in the crockpot to smooth and blend any small pieces.

I have used this recipe the last couple of years and keep in the freezer over winter.  This is excellent.  We have an apple tree that "came with the property", have no idea what variety, but the apples are not really good for baking, pies, etc.  so I tried this recipe and it is wonderful.  I don't necessarily measure the amount of apples, just fill my largest crockpot (7 qt) with apples and use the other ingredients as directed.  Have shared the recipe with family and friends - to everyone's delight.  Would highly recommend you give it a try.

WOW!!!  What a super easy recipe!  I was very nervous -- afraid I'd mess it up ... I've never made jams, jellys or preserves.  I can't say that its as good as my Aunt Reba's or Aunt Jean's ... BUT it's pretty darn close!!!  I used a combination of honeycrisp & macintosh (about 3 pounds), a tad more than a cup of sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp cloves.  I am definitely going to make more!!!

Patients pays off with this recipe.  I started this the night before and it took almost 24 hours to pass the frozen plate test.  But it did pass and the wait was worth it.  Boy did the house smell good!  I try to stick to the original recipe the first time I try something to get a base.   In this case I just couldn't add so much sugar.  So I added 2 cups white 1 cup brown.  Everything else I kept the same.  The sugar amount you need to add depends on two things.  How ripe (sweet) are your apples?  How sweet do you like your apple butter?  There is no right answer, only opinion.  Second piece of advice, keep cooking until it passes the frozen plate test.  I immersion blended it near the end and it turned out like velvet.  Started with a heaping 6 qt slow cooker of apples and ended up with 3 pints of butter.  This recipe can be canned with the water bath method.  My two year old licks this off her toast in the morning!

Absolutely delicious!  It is a must make during apple season.  If you only make one apple recipe-this is the one to make.

I cooked this longer than recipe called for, since it didn't seem thick enough.  I cut it in half to try it out, which made two 8oz jars full.  I like that it made the house smell good and that I knew all the ingredients added (as opposed to stuff in stores.)  I am just not sure I'll go to the trouble since I can let the Amish folks do it and buy theirs near here!

This was my first attempt at making apple butter,  or any kind of jam,  jelly,  etc. for that matter. It turned out fabulous!  I halved the recipe and used Granny Smith apples that I diced into 1/4" cubes.  Because I opted to use a tart apple,  I did use the amount of sugar this recipe calls for.  Actually,  because of my amateur status,  I thought it best to file the recipe exactly.  I'm glad I did... It proved to be really yummy!  I think next time I will try with Macintosh apples.  Thanks for a great recipe and encouraging start to canning!

Had 6 apples, not sure what they weighed, but I halved the spices. Used about 1 1/2 cup sugar. As I tasted it warm from the slow cooker I thought it was too sweet, but cold from the fridge it was perfect.

This is a GREAT recipe!!!!!  I only used 1 cup of sugar and that was perfect.  It was already on the sweet side.  I did add that allspice like the other reviews said .  I cooked it for 11 hours and I did not feel that taking the lid of the cooker for 1 hour was necessary.  I did use 6 lbs of apples and only got 7 jars out of it.  Had to make another batch. This recipe is a keeper.

Tastes good. Took the advice of others and cooked over 3 days, too time consuming will probably not make again.  Yummy though.

I used honeycrisp apples and added virtually no sugar, maybe a 1/3c,  but I did add a dash of allspice. My 13 y/o even approved it!

I used one cup of sugar instead of the four called for in the recipe and used Gala apples.  Since I used three cups less of sugar, I ended up with five cups of apple butter at the end.  I'm really glad that I only used one cup; reading the reviews made me suspect that four cups would be way too much, and one cup ended up being perfect.  Adjust the sweetness to your tastes, but don't be surprised like I was when your yield decreases!  I was so disappointed when I ended up with four 8-oz jars to can, and one partially full jar for the fridge.  Still very yummy, but seemed like a sparse reward for so much time spent on the apple butter.

The recipe is definitely delicious but a few things I would say you need to do.cut the sugar in half I feel it's way to sweet.i had to water mine down some to take away some of the sweetness.i also cooked it all day about 16hrs.then put it in the refrigerator over night.then cooked it for 7hrs the next day with the lid off in medium and it's amazing.

I used 1 1/2 cups each of white and brown sugar, kept spices the same, and used 9-10lbs of apples. Cooked it the same way Canned in hot water bath-amazingly good. After it cooked 12 hrs, I pureed it and cooked uncovered for additional 4 hrs. Just finished my 4th batch(holidays coming)

This was the first time I ever made Applebutter I have an apple tree in my front yard so I went out picked a whole bunch of apples my whole house smelled like apple pie the whole day and the Applebutter itself turned out delicious it kind of taste a little bit like apple pie apple sauce I eat it on almost everything. I made enough to share with my family and they ate it up in the first day and now they can't wait until next time I can make more.

Wow! This was so incredibly easy to make and reminds me of the apple butter my grandma made when I was a kid. My family LOVES it. I filled the crock pot with a mixture of apples we had picked that ended up beat up or bruised. I followed others suggestions and cut back the sugar. I used 2 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown. It is fabulous and the house smells divine!

This turned out well, with a few adjustments. I added only 2 cups of sugar instead of 4, and once the lid came off it took more like 6 hours to finally thicken enough. maybe straining it would get the same affect, I might try that if I make it again. Overall a good recipe though!

Super easy and really tasty! I added 1 teaspoon of ground all spice, and also about a 1/2 teaspoon extra of ground cinnamon. I reduced the sugar to 3 1/2 cups, next time I'll reduce it to a total of 3 cups. I love sweets, and I still think this was a little to sweet. Towards the end, I whisked it vigorously, and when it was cool, I used a hand mixer to reduce the lumps further. This recipe is a winner in my book! I also posted a pic!

We loved our apple butter. I used pretty tart apples and the first time and it turned out great. I also did another batch later in the year when our apples were sweeter and the full amount of sugar which was also very good - I prefer the more tart apples or sweeter apples with a little less sugar, but I think it just depends on your personal taste. Firmer apples need to cook a bit longer it seems, but it also depends on how small you chop the apples. Very good simple recipe!

I was given a bushel of I think Ida Red apples from my inlaws. Wasnt sure what to do with all of them and then came upon this recipe. The first batch I made I decided to omit 1/2 the sugar and used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar also did not have cloves so used 1/4 tsp of all spice. Turned out great! dont think you need the 4 cups of suger unless you are using a sour apple.

2nd Batch

My wife has adopted a paleo like diet (whole foods no refind sugar) so I wanted to make some for her to enjoy. Same spice mixture but insted of sugar I used 1 cup of Honey. Awsome

I actually prefer the 2nd batch better. more apple flavor and we could all due with less sugar in our diets. still vary sweet.

I loved making apple butter, thanks for recipe! I like to read the positive reviews and then adjust as you feel you would like. I used a combo of Granny Smith and Golden Delicious green apples, 1 cup of sugar, and added a dash or so of allspice. I did use a food processor to chop the apples small and then I tell you, one needs to cook this and cook it some more and don't give up! I wondered why it wasn't dark brown but it gets there. I liked it so much I then made a triple batch but this batch I didn't like the consistency so I put it in the blender in small batches and it looks buttery smooth and it's great. I'll probably make this every year now to share with friends and family!!

Yummy! I cut the sugar down to 2 cups but I think next time I'll reduce it a little more. Flavor was great. I used an extra 2 pounds of apples and a mix of golden delicious, fuji and gala apples. Could be the apples I used that made it sweeter. Would definitely not use 4 cups of sugar though. Also I added some fresh ground nutmeg. Gave away as gifts and everyone loved it. I will make it again soon :)

Fantastic! It takes some tweaking depending on the type of apples used and the temperature of your crock pot, but it's still so easy! I used crab apples from the farm and added 1/4 tsp of Allspice. Added bonus: The house smells delicious while it cooks! I'm giving this to everyone for Christmas this year and I've already had great feedback.

Fantastic recipe. I cooked it for 11 hours. First three hours on high, then turned down to low. I added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon. Then blended with an immersion blender to make it smooth. Delicious.

Great idea! I added more spices (allspice & mace). I also had to add lemon juice, as I thought this was too sweet. After cooking all night, I put pureed the apple pieces in my blender and returned it to the crock pot to finish.

By far the best apple butter I have ever tasted in my life!  I did everything the way the recipe said as far as ingredients, but I only sliced my apples thin and they cooked down perfectly to make a nice thick sauce. I cooked it from 8 am until 6 pm. I filled my family size crock pot to the top which is 5-5 1/2 pounds of apples. Let it cook all day......the house smelled heavenly! My kids came running out of their room in the morning to see what I was cooking. I didn't have any pint jars and this recipe filled two quart size canning jars perfectly. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Just finished our first batch and it turned out great! Very easy, we cut the sugar in half, used cortland apples, and added 1/4 tsp all spice. It's the best we've ever made. The second batch starts tomorrow.

4 cups of sugar was way too much. I made this as a gift and for us, but it was very, very sweet. I would use maybe 2 cups instead.

This was amazing. I like this pretty sweet, but only used two cups of sugar and a variety of apples and it's excellent. It definitely made more than I thought it would though (probably about a quart?) so I'll be freezing a lot of it. This would be a great gift in a cute mason jar at Christmastime!

So I was given 25 lbs of apples from a friends orchard and didn't know what to do with it. I (my husband really) 10 lbs last night and did half apple butter and half applesauce. I LOVED this recipe so much that we peeled and cored the rest and am making a double batch tonight. I start the crock on low the night before, and in the morning I use my hand held blender to make it kinda chunky, left the lid off on low for 6 hrs and has the perfect consistency, everybody in the house loved it so we just had to make more.

I just made this recipe and it turned out great, I did 2 cups of sugar, one white, one brown.  Also squirted a little vanilla into it.  I only got 5 half-pint jars and was a little disappointed in that but will just have to make more.

I ended up only getting 7 half pint jars out of the recipe, and followed the canning time of another reviewer, leaving in a water bath for 30 min.  I left 1/4" headspace, but may leave a litte more next time.

Set it up to cook overnight, with a stir before bed and constant stiring in the morning and it was fantastic.  Planning to use as xmas gifts all around, and hopefully will be using this one to make Pear Butter as well!

Very easy to make and SO delicious. I was able to do the rest of my canning while this cooked in the crock pot, then canned it right before bed.  I'll be using this recipe for good.

I tried this recipe with Honeycrisp apples and 3 cups of sugar and it was almost right. A bit sweet for my taste but my husband loved it. Next time will either add a dash of apple cider vinegar or less sugar, we'll see. Could also stand to be run through a food mill to remove the pulp so that it's less of an applesauce. Otherwise a good start!

Wonderful taste and texture.  You need not puree or mill the apples before making it, as others have suggested.  After they cook for so long, the whisk the author mentioned is enough to get a lovely texture.   I have stopped using cloves -not everyone likes the taste- and use a vanilla bean instead, plus some ginger powder and the mentioned cinnamon. It's lovely.

This was ok.  I think it had WAY too much cinnamon in it - it was quite overpowering.  I'd also cut the sugar by at least 1/4 as it was so sweet we ended up throwing it out after a while.  It was just too sweet to eat.

I  didn't realize how "finely" to chop the apples, it still looks like applesauce instead of apple butter. :/  But it still smells delicious!

This recipe was the best! It was my first attempt at apple butter and not only did it make more than the 5 pints, (I got 7) but the taste was better than any apple butter I have ever had. I decreased the amount of sugar because the apples were sweet enough. I also used an immersion mixer to make sure it was totally smooth. Other than that, I followed the recipe.

My boyfriend and I made this and it is delicious! Not to mention our house smelled fabulous while the apples and cinnamon were in the slow cooker. We used semi-tart apples, and added a pinch more sugar, and didn't used clove (mainly because we didn't have any and already had everything in the slow cooker). It didn't seem to change the taste though. I can't wait to make it again!

Most EXCELENT! My house shall never be without HOMEMADE Apple Butter again! I used less sugar, and should have even used a little less even. I did 4lbs of Granny Smith Apples and 1lb of Fiji Apples with 3 Cups sugar - next time, I will start off with 2 cups sugar and add more as needed to taste - this is going on my Christmas gift list!

This makes a wonderful apple butter. It is quite sweet, but not so much to make it cloying. The applesauce halfway through cooking isn't half bad either!

I loved this recipe. Though I use less sugar and found it just as easy to cook on stovetop for about half the time. Great find!

This turned out wonderful! I used wolf river apples which are good for baking. I did adjust after reading some reviews. I used 2 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. I added the juice from one lemon. I also grated fresh nutmeg into the mix.  I cooked the full crock pot on high for two hours and then turned it to low, stirring from time to time.  I think it was on from about 10 am until 8pm. I had cut the apples pieces pretty small hoping they would cook down more quickly. That seemed to help. At the end I used my emulsion blender to smooth it out a little more. I know I will make this again! Both my boys loved it and the 9 year old wanted to take some to bed! I guess he liked it!

I thought it had good flavor using 4 cups sugar. I cooked mine an extra 6-7 hours, overnight. I only left the lid off for a half hour or so and it didn't get thick enough. I read more reviews later suggesting longer, so I'll do that next time.

Followed the recipe exactly as written.  Started in the evening and left on low overnight. Had to leave uncovered for 2 hours instead of one to get it thick enough.  Maybe a little too sweet, but I was worried about it not gelling as stated in previous posts.  In the end I added some extra cinnamon, ground nutmeg, ground cloves and all spice to taste at the very end as I felt it was lacking in flavor.  Made 5 pints.

I LOVE this recipe!  My friends and family love the apple butter and can not get enough of it.  I don't usually measure my apples, I just fill my crock pot and add the other ingredients.  I only use 2 cups of sugar and usually use heaping teaspoons of cinnamon.  I always can most of the apple butter and make the recipe multiple times in the fall so we have apple butter all year.

I make this every fall when the apples are best.  My favorite is to mix Yellow Delicious and Macintosh.  Also like to add a bit of nutmeg.  It is so nice to take it out of the freezer and have delicious homemade taste.  Thanks for sharing a favorite in this household.

I used a mixture of white and brown sugar adding up to about 3 cups, and I also added nutmeg at the beginning.  About one hour before it was finished, I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  I whipped it with a hand mixer when it was done to get a smoother consistency.  It was fantastic!!!

Good but very sweet. I made this with a combination of granny smith & fuji apples and used only 2 cups of sugar (so glad I did because even with that much sugar it was very sweet!) That is why the 4 star rating, if made as directed it would have been much to sweet to eat. I also put this on to cook at noon and then cooked it until the next morning. After taking the lid off it took a few hours to become thick enough to can. Used a hot water bath as mentioned by another reviewer. Good base recipe but start with less sugar and adjust to your liking.

We grow Anna apples in north San Diego county.  I make batch after batch, and friends ask for second "helpings" all the time.  Try this over crisp waffles drizzled with real ample syrup.  Try it on toast, or just eat it with a spoon, it's that good!  One question, can this be canned?  We crave it year round.

I made this apple butter using Golden Delicious apples.  I peeled, cored, and sliced them, and ran them through the blender on a low setting to get a nice, smooth, applesauce texture.  I started with 1 1/2 cups of sugar based on the rest of the reviews.  Considering Golden Delicious are rather sweet, its sensible that some varieties of apples would need less sugar and others would need more for the right flavor.  I also doubled the amount of ground cloves for a little more spice!  I cooked mine in the crockpot overnight.  I was not aware that my crockpot had "hot spots," but I found that out in the morning when the butter was burned to the sides in a few spots.  If you know yours has burn spots, plan to be awake and able to stir the butter occasionally to prevent burning.  If it does burn, though, just pour the butter out, and the burned portions will stick to the crockpot sides.  You can clean it and go back to cooking the salvaged butter when you have finished.  I was easily able to can this using a hot water bath.  I loved this recipe and have wonderful apple butter in the middle of winter to share with family and friends.  Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe, it was easy and made great christmas gifts (made gift baskets with apple butter, cinamon bread & starbucks christmas blend coffee). I omitted cloves and just one cup of sugar and it was awesome. I am doing my second batch as I type. I am planned on mixing half of this batch with some fresh cranberries cooked and pureeed to see how that works out...apple cranberry YUM! I know next year I will be canning this BEFORE christmas at the peak of apple season. I was nervous with my first batch because i wasn't sure how it was supposed to look like/consistency. I also used an immersion blender which worked beautifully. I am much more confident doing this batch. Thank you so much for this lovely recipe. All I can say is don't hesitate on this recipe (just remember to go light on the sugar) Put it in your recipe box! :-)

Fabulous! I am on my second batch now! Took the advice of others, I used granny smiths and only used 1 cup of honey and 1/2 cup of light brown sugar. Came out great!  For my second batch now cooking I added some orange extract and ginger in addition to the cloves and cinnamon. I also reduced the sugar even more b/c the less sugar the better for your health. (only 1/2 cup of honey and 1/4 cup of dark brown sugar this time! Smells great!

I use this recipe to make Apple Butter at the cafe I work for. The customers love it! And I love that I can just leave it cooking and check on it every now and then. While it is a long cooking time, it's very easy to do. Love this recipe and I will continue to use it every time I want to make Apple Butter.

I made this apple butter with 5 lb. Gala & 1 Ganny Smith (because I needed to use it) apples. I used 2 cups brown sugar & 2 cups white. I had whole cloves pressed in a garlic press & I think I used a tad too much. After cooking the apple butter, I blended it in the blender. I filled 12 .5 Pint jars an inch from the top & put them in a boiling bath for 30 min. It is DELICIOUS! & Relatively painless in the CROCK POT! Excellent Recipe! I will make this again! Thanks for sharing!!!!

This recipe is great. I only used 1 cup of sugar because my apples are very sweet. Go light on the sugar since its easier to adjust for less than it is for more. Also, I used brown sugar which really added another depth. I generally like to use more spices too, I used the cinnamon, cloves and then added nutmeg- no salt. By sheer accident, my boyfriend didn't stir the apples and the brown sugar I had thrown on top of the apples caramelized before the apples finished in the morning. Had an amazing burnt sugar/ creme brulee taste.

EASY ~ EXCELLENT ~ GREAT GIFTS ~ I made a sample batch looking for an easy canning apple butter to give as gifts at the holidays - Well. PRESTO! I found it. Did not change one single thing, however - it is super sweet. We ate it on toast, would not suggest eating right out of the jar unless your sweet tooth is huge. 5 STARS for canning and gift giving!

This stuff is really good, but it does seem a bit sweet. I think I will cut down on the sugar next time. I used Gala apples so maybe that had something to do with the sweetness factor? Either way, still good.

I've never made apple butter or even tasted it until I tried this recipe. It was soooo easy and sooo yummy. I gave a jar to some senior citizens that live out back and they loved it to. Thanks for the recipe.

Loved this. I ended up cooking 15 hours, but maybe it was the apples I used. I also added a little nutmeg and alspice. Really super. will make again.

This is a good apple butter recipe. I've made it many times now. My fiance adores it with his peanut butter in sandwiches. I've made it several times using dehydrated apples that I've reconstituted in boiling water or juice. The cook time for this is significantly lower and the end product is much, much thicker. I put the reconstituted apples in the crock pot and add about a cup of apple juice. I add more throughout the day if it seems dry. When it's deep brown, I know it's done. I run it through a blender and it's like velvet. When making it with fresh apples, I only add 1/2 cup of sugar, to help release the juice. Then, after an hour or so, I drain all the juice out. I reserve this in case I need to thicken it later. I start out with half of the sugar recommended in the recipe, then add more throughout the day as I taste it. Without the extra liquid, the apple butter cooks ALOT faster and can be done in 8 to 10 hours in my slow cooker. Also, I like my apple butter thick and I've found that this is the best way to achieve this. Astonishingly enough, I think I prefer the apple butter I make using dehydrated apples. Good recipe, though. Will use it again many more times.

This applebutter is SO easy & delicious.  The house smelled great all weekend.  I cut the sugar amount in half, adding only 2 cups to the first batch (then 1 1/2 cups to the second batch).  If you have very tart apples, you might want to add more but otherwise you won't need the full amount of sugar.  Get small jars so you can share the finished product!

Hmmm, Pretty disappointed in this. I cut the sugar half and this was still sickeningly sweet. For the amount of effort that goes into making it I don't think it was worth it.

This will be an annual recipe for sure!  I put the apples in the food processor to chop them very fine.  Also used a little less sugar and mixed brown sugar with white sugar.  My son and his teen age friends CANNOT get enough--and they are a tough crowd!  Thanks for the idea!

This is a great recipe.  I actually qaudrupled it for 22lbs of aplpes. I got "#2 apples" from a local orchard that were half the price of regular apples.  I used an electic roaster and left them all night.  I did have to add some cinnamon and cloves.  I also cut the sugar by 2 cups on this amount of apples because I was using Gala. I think I could have cut it more, though.  I used a food processor at the end to get the consistancy that I wanted. I water bathed them for 20min for pint jars.  Thanks for sharing!

To quote my son, "Mom, this is soooo good!"  Just canned this this morning.  I used maybe a little less clove than called for after reading other reviews.  After tasting this morning I'd say just about right.  I will make this again, it's so easy in the slow cooker.

This was just okay. I find it to be a more Jam consistancy as well. I halved it, and it took much longer to cook than expected. PLEASE reduce the sugar! You will regret it if you do not... I love sweet things, but thsi is really borderline.  It will make a wonderfull ice cream topping, and also goes well on english muffins!  I don't think this will be something I cook to often, but could come in handy at some point.

Once i got past peeling all those apples this recipe was very easy.  I followed another review and instead of cutting the apples into small chunks i put them through the food processer.  This recipe does require the entire amount of sugar, do not reduce to 2 cups!  i also added more cinnamon than called for...came out perfect

I had never made apple butter before, and it turned out great.  I made it with some tiny homegrown apples, and only made half a batch.  I cooked it for about 12 hours total, with the lid on the whole time (oops!), and it turned out a little thicker than traditional apple butter.  I love it!

The flavor is very nice, though even after I halved the amount of sugar in the recipe, I thought it was slightly too sweet. I shredded the peeled/cored apples with my food processor to speed up the process. I also pureed the cooked product til it was silky smooth.

I had to cook it MUCH longer, even followed other reviews saying to put skewers underneath the lid to let the steam escape, still didn't get the consistency I wanted but it had a good flavor - enough for three 16oz jars

This tasted like a thick, flavored applesauce. It had no "butter" texture to it. My kids love apple butter from the restaurants, but they wouldn't even eat this one. Sorry, didn't care for it at all.

I followed others suggestion and used less sugar - 2 cups; can't imagine it being sweeter. Used a variety of apples; mostly golden delicious, but added a few gala, red delicious, and McIntosh - more than the recipe called for; approx 20 cups of apples. Cooked overnight; then pureed in a blender in batches; returned to the slow cooker with lid off and it took several hours to reach the proper consistency, stirring often. Was very satisfied with the end result and it was my first time making apple butter.

Getting ready to serve this for Thanksgiving. Delish! I too altered the recipe & couldn't be happier.   :: alternatives ::  1 cup of In the Raw Cane Sugar 1 cup of Brown Sugar (replacing 4 cups white sugar)  eliminated cloves and added 1 tsp white pepper and 1 bay leaf. excellent zing!  You can modify this cook time. Cooked on high for 3 hours and low for 3. Perfect if you're in a time crunch.

Easy & delicious. I cut the sugar to 1 cup, didn't add salt, added 1/4 teaspoon Penzy's cake spices in addition to the cinnamon. I peeled and cored, didn't dice. Cooked in slow cooker 10 hours, mashed with a potato masher, and never felt the need to blend it.

This was my first time making apple butter and it was so easy! I even kept the skins on for added nutrients/fiber and everyone loved it. I probably just had especially juicy apples (I used Gala) because I had to cook it for about 24-hours! I also used a stick blender right in the crock pot to make it silky smooth. Wonderful!

I am giving this 4 stars because as written it would have been way too sweet. Per other reviews, I used 2 cups of sugar total, 1 each of white and brown sugar. That was the perfect amount for my taste. Also, I definitely need to cook on high uncovered for a good 2-3 hours to get the right consistency. The spices are perfect. I have made this recipe a few times, and will continue to use, with modifications.

Wonderful flavor; made the whole house smell great. I cut the sugar down and ended up cooking about 30 hours all told, the last 6 with the lid off, to get everything very nice and dark and delish. Added about 1/4 cup of brandy at the very end before packing into jars and canning, which gave it a lovely deep "grownup" flavor.

This was great apple butter. I did make a few changes. I made with half brown sugar and half white sugar because I personally like the flavor of brown sugar better. Also added 1/4 C Apple Cider. Then I cooked it overnight (13 - 14 hours) covered and took the cover off for about 45 mins to an hour to thicken it up. Loved it though!

Very tasty!  I used a food processor to finely chop the apples and then a blender at the end to get the apple butter smooth.  As others have posted, it took about 6 hours of uncovered cooking at the end to get it to the right consistency.  This yielded 3 pints, plus a little to eat right away.

I used this recipe only for the cooking method.  I cooked the apple mixture on the stove until the apples were soft and then put it in the crock pot and cooked it on high uncovered for about 8 hrs until thick and dark brown.  Cooking the applebutter down in the crockpot takes more total time but much less active time and makes much less mess.  It doesn't splatter all over the stove and you don't have to stir it constantly to prevent burning.  Thanks for the idea Terri!!

I used 13 empire apples, which I figured was about 5.5 pounds (after one kind member weighed some for me and said each was about 7 ounces). I only used 2 cups of sugar and increased the cinnamon to 1T, and it was perfect.

Great recipe! I used Golden Delicious apples, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and cut the sugar down to 1.5 cups. My family was eating it straight from the jar after I canned it.

I thought this was a wonderful recipe. It did take significantly longer to complete than the recipe indicated but that could be due to the type of apple. Very easy, and very versatile.

It's thick and very flavorful.  I froze most of it and pull out a jar when needed.  I did use at least 2 cups brown sugar, and maybe added more cinnamon... 2nd time:  Used 1 3/4 white sugar and 2 1/4 brown sugar.  3 tsp cinn., 1/2 tsp cloves. I didn't weigh the apples...just filled the crockpot to overflowing!  Might add more once they cook down, if it seems too sweet.

I have made this several times, and we love it! I usually use splenda(reducing the amount or it's way too sweet), and I took the one review idea of cooking it for almost 24 hours. My teen keeps me supplied in apples so I can keep her supplied in apple butter!

This recipe gets 4 stars as it is. 5 stars if you reduce the sugar. I think it really depends on how sweet your apples already are. The kinds I get from the supermarket are really sweet so I had to use my judgment on the amt to be used. Ended up putting in less than half the sugar called for and it was rather sweet so I will further reduce the sugar somemore the next time. I don't have a crockpot so I tried using my rice cooker (certainly beats stove top). Turned out great. I let it cook in there on two cycles (2hrs in total) and at the end of it all stirred it to make it smoother. At the end of the first cycle I couldn't resist and had some with ice cream. It tasted like apple pie filling. At the end of the second cycle though it gets a lot more concentrated and sweeter. Think I'll try it with cheese on toast. Thanks for a great recipe!

Super easy for a first timer! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the sweetness was overkill. I only used 3 cups as opposed to the suggested 4 and it was still too much. The sweetness of the apple (I used half Granny Smith, half Fuji) plays a big role so I'd suggest tasting your apples before adding the sugar. I'll be making another batch tomorrow (holiday gifts this year) and will decrease the sugar to only a cup and a half. Additionally, I didn't need to cook near as long - only about 6 hours total. All in all, very pleased!

I have always loved store bought apple butter but I enjoy it even more homemade.  I was given a basket full of apples from a friend so I had no idea how much they weighed.  I guessed and added 2 cups of sugar.  The sweetness was perfect but the texture was a bit heavy and sticky.  Maybe I let it cook too long???  No matter.  Spread on a slice of toast there is a wonderful freshness and fruitiness to it that you simply cannot get out of a jar at the grocery store.  I have had this for breakfast every day for a week and I'll be having it until the container is empty.

Yum!  I can't believe how much over 5lbs of apples can cook down.  I only used 2 c of sugar and it is plenty sweet.  It's great that this takes all day to cook because it makes the house smell great.

Love this!  I used a mixture of Prairie Spy and Gala apples and about 3 cups of sugar (1.5 c white sugar and 1.5 c brown sugar) and it was plenty sweet for us.  Great gift idea!

Great way to use up lots of apples.  But for me, just too sweet - tooth hurting sweet.  I used tart cooking apples so I used the suggested amount of sugar (half brown and half white).  I'm hoping the sugar will mellow in the freezer.  I'm rating this a 4* because I will make again (loads more apples to use up) but I will reduce the sugar.

Mmmm.  I used honey instead of sugar, as suggested in a few reviews.  I found it to be a bit runny even after leaving the lid off for an hour, next fall I'll have to simmer it on the stove uncovered or longer in the slow cooker uncovered.  I also blended it in the food processor after it was done cooking to make it smooth.

Great recipe. I didn't give it 5 stars because it doesn't need the sugar. I used Macintosh apples and a 1/4 cup sugar.

This was my first time making apple butter & it turned out great.  Per reviews I only added 2 cups sugar (1 cup brown 1 cup white).  It wasn't too sweet at all.  The only depressing part was how much it shrunk during cooking.  My slow cooker was filled to brim in the beginning but by the end it was half full.  I filled 5 eight ounce jars.

Fantastic! This recipe has become a family tradition. In the fall we go apple picking and then use the fresh picked apples to make this scrumptious treat! Last year I made two huge batches and canned it. I gave decorated jars of apple butter to friends and family for Christmas and everyone loved it! My mom follows the recipe exactly and it is delicious but I prefer a little more spice. I use two cups of brown sugar and  two cups of white and I also add a teaspoon of ginger. Many thanks for sharing this recipe!

I loved this apple butter!  I didn't use as much sugar (more like 2.5 cups) but it was plenty sweet.  I left a couple of cinnamon sticks in with it while it was in the crock pot over night and it was delicious.  May have taken longer than the recipe said to reduce enough, but the spices were great.  Followed other reviewers advice and ran apples through food processor first to get rid of chunks.  Canned it up the next day and put them in gift baskets for the holidays!

I made this for the first time a few months ago and man was it amazing!  I used grannysmith apples and put them in the food processor before cooking them as a previous person suggested.  Our 7 jars are gone already and my husband is asking for more!  Definitely a great recipe!

I only used 3 apples, and a half cup of sugar. I didn't want to make much, because if I ended up not liking it, I'd be throwing alot away. I used Fuji apples. I haven't had Apple Butter in years, and I can't seem to find it anywhere in Alberta. The apples got really dry, and I added water. I didn't make them small enough, so I put the mixture in the food processor and it turned out light in color than. It was very dark before I proccessed it. My husband suggested I use a sweeter apple, like machintosh or granny smith.

This turned out very good!  I used Red Delicious apples since they were a little cheaper.  I think those are good apples for this because they are already a little mushy.  I took pint jars to family members and they all raved about it.

Very good!  I've never made apple butter before and this was EASY! I reduced the sugar to 3c. using half while and half brown.  It was still a bit sweet so I will reduce further next time.  I made this for Thanksgiving and sent a jar home with each guest.  Perfect gift!

My boyfriend LOVES apple butter and raves about Cracker Barrel's all the time. I made this and he says its even better! We go through about a jar a month so I constantly have to make more. The great advantage to it being a clowcooker receipe is that your whole house will smell absolutely amazing. I cook it as directed and then use a hand blender to smooth it out when it's finished cooking. It's perfect every time. Thanks for a wonderful receipe!

Absolutely incredible!  I couldn't believe how good this was!  And it was so easy!  This will be a new family tradition for us.  I've never made apple butter before.  It made the house smell great.  It cooks down more than I thought it would and I started to get concerned with how dark it was getting, but it turned out perfect and I had nothing to worry about.  Used Golden Delicious that we had just picked from the orchard.

Very good taste, but thick jelly-like consistency.  It almost seemed as though my apples did not have enough juice.  But I will definitely try again!

this was very easy and good, I used jonthan and mcintosh apples and 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.  Next time I will probably decrease the sugar by a cup because it was a little sweet.

This recipe is very good. I am giving it four stars because I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and that seemed to be plenty. I think it would be much too sweet with four cups.

This recipe is the best. I will never buy apple butter again. I had only planned for this to cook all night, but the next day got really busy. This cooked on low for about 14 hrs with the lid on then about 4 hrs with the lid off. It did thicken when it cooled. PERFECT!! I also used the hand blender.

This tasted good, and would be great with toast, but not what I was expecting it to look like. It turned out more like Apple Jam than butter consistancy...

I made this with 2 cups of sugar originally (1 c brown, 1 c white) with 6 pounds of somewhat tart apples (green with a tinge of red) from my apple trees.  It was a little bitter when I finally tasted it so I added another cup of white sugar.  I think going with less sugar and then adding more if needed is a good idea.  I also used nutmeg instead of cloves because I didn't have any on hand.  After it had cooked overnight for about 10 hours, I took the lid off and I probably could have stopped cooking it right then, but I still let it cook longer which made it turn dark brown.  I used a handblender to smooth it out and filled up 6-8 oz jars.   The taste is good, but it didn't "wow" me like I expected.  Still, I'll make this again with different apples and spices.  Thanks!

This was very good.  My husband who loves apple butter, said it tasted great.  I made one change, which was to reduce the sugar as suggested by others.  I chopped the apples very small and it still came out a little lumpy.  Overall a very good recipe.  Thanks!

I have been using this recipe for a couple of years. I use light brown sugar instead of white. My family looks forward to jars of apple butter for Christmas every year.

This was ok, but I'm not sure what all the craze is about.  I've never had apple butter, so it's likely that my dislike has more to do with personal preference and less to do with the recipe.  Dispite waiting for it to get super thick and then pushing it thru a seive, it really just tasted like apple sauce to me.  Sorry.

This was great!  After I made it I canned for the first time!  Next time I might just use less sugar though.  It was a little too sweet for my taste.

WOW!! This was so easy to make I can't beleive I am going to have homemade apple butter in my fride whenever I want!! I cut the sugar to 3 cups, added extra spices and cooked it a lot longer than suggested. About 12 hours with lid on & 6 hours with lid off. Came out so delicious. Thank you so much for this!

Very good!  My apples were chopped tiny, but they didn't fall apart  when I whisked it, so I just ran it through the blender and it was fine.  It makes me wonder if I really do need to chop them so finely next time.  Anyway, it is delicious and I will be giving jars of this as Christmas presents.

I am giving this recipe 4 stars because it is too sweet for my taste, but I served this for Thanksgiving dinner with rolls and all the guests loved it.  I used Granny Smith apples and followed the directions as written.  Using a food processor for the apple will save you a ton of time on the chopping.

Well, it turns out I don't like apple butter, which is weird considering that I love apple sauce.  So I'm basing this rating/review on my husband and boys.  I used a combination of fresh picked apples.  I used far less sugar as I wanted to give this to my 15 month olds.  I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/3 cup unpacked brown sugar.  I thought it was overly sweet, but everyone else thought it was just right.  When there was about 1 hour left to cook, I used a stick blender to break up the remaining pieces.  It ended up being the perfect consistency.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was so fun to make with my daughters. We woke up in the morning to such a wonderful aroma.  It was so fun to make, it taste sooooo good and it left us with sweet memories. Definately a new fall tradition after returning from the apple orchard.

It was okay.  I think I was expecting more after it cooked so long.  It was a modified apple sauce.

I mixed up one cup each of white and brown sugar with the spices.  I sprinkled the apples with 1/2 of the sugar mixture at the beginning of the day and set the rest aside to be added if necessary.  (It was not.)  This is an easy way to make an impressive gift and to get your kitchen to smell incredible.

This is SO easy and SO good!  But the best thing about it is the smell of your house!  It takes ALL day, so plan ahead.  But it's well worth it.

I use this same recipe every fall with my girls.  They run the apple peeler corer slicer and I do all the rest.  My daughter says, "who needs air freshner when you can just make this!" It does smell wonderful.  We serve it on unsweeted applesauce throughout the year. Just a dollop in the middle makes plain applesauce a treat.

a good simple recipe. i made the following changes based on previous advice posted: 

make the sugar 1 & 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown.
add 1/2 tsp allspice
make the cinnamon 3 tsp.
also while the residual liquid was minimal if you're worried about it make the amount of apples an even 6 lbs and that should take care of the problem.

A hand blender/immersion blender is practically essential for this recipe. SO much easier! I don't even have to peel the apples, just core and cut large chunks (plus the peel adds nutritional value). After cooking on high for an hour or 2, just use the blender to mash everything down. 

I also don't pay much attention to the times in this recipe. I cook it on high the whole time, and cook with the lid off for probably 3 or 4 hours (of a total 10 or so). I've never paid strict attention to the time, I just keep an eye on the butter all day and stir every so often. You know it's done when a spoonful of butter cooled on a plate for a few minutes doesn't have a ring of liquid around it. 

Definitely use the blender a few times throughout the cooking process to get super smooth results.

This turned out beautifully!  It was so easy to make--the hardest part was peeling all the apples.  I used a food chopper to mince the apples into smaller pieces which helped speed things up a bit.  I let it cook all day and my house smelled heavenly.  It tastes delicious---my husband eagerly awaited the first taste and loves it on his biscuits.  Even my extremely picky 4 yr old loves it!  My two year old does, too, so this is a hit and we will make it again and again!  There are so many tasty uses for it plus I will be making this to give as gifts it is so yummy.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

i use half brown sugar instead.  It's a hit a work, I have to make batches for everyone! Great way to use up the too many apples we always end up with when out picking. Use on toast or ice cream, yum!

I enjoyed making this apple butter, it smelled wonderful.  I used MacIntosh and Granny Smiths which worked very well.  I cut down on the sugar some, and it was still too sweet for my taste.  Next time I will probably cut the sugar near to half.  Also, I used my mixer with the blender attachment to puree the apples right inside the slow cooker...the texture was so nice and velvety!  Very nice as gifts, and works well to flavor oatmeal!  I will use this again for sure.

This has to be the simplest, easiest, most delicious apple butter recipe ever.  I used a combination of granny smith and fuji apples, 1.5 cups of sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar,  1/4 cup maple syrup, and a couple shakes of allspice -- too yummy!  After the apples had cooked overnight, I took my trusty potato masher to the mix -- no need to use an immersion blender as the larger bits make this unique.  I will be making two more batches for Christmas gifts.  Thanks, Terri -- great recipe!

Great recipe!  I halved the recipe to put in a small appetizer-type crockpot.  It took 5 apples and I reduced the sugar down to 1 cup.  I let it cook overnight, then let it go 3 hours with the lid off.  Used a small hand mixer to get it to the perfect consistency.  Delicious on english muffin bread!

I have made three batches of this already, and it is wonderful!!  I plan to make one or two more this week.  I've never made apple butter before, and this was very easy to do.  It really helps if you have an apple/peeler/corer/slicer, and something to chop for you.  I can't imagine the time it would take to do all that by hand!!  I do up the apples an hour before bed, and the butter's ready in the morning.

This is a really good recipe,although next time I will cut the sugar down to 3 cups. I used up all the apples I had from last falls trip to the mountains, and I'm sure it was more than the amount called for in the recipe.I cooked it all night in the crockpot and had it for breakfast. I also used the stick blender to mix it at the end. Thanks, Terri

I've never made apple butter before and was wanting to try something new.  This was a success.  Yummy stuff.
  I made this with half red and half Granny Smith Apples.  I used 2 cups of sugar.  Next time I'll either use all Granny Smith or reduce the sugar further.  I'll also increase the spice some maybe adding some allsipce or nutmeg, but that's just personal prefrence.  I didn't peel the apples, mostly because I'm lazy.  I cored and sliced them then ran them through the food processor.  I can't tell there's peel in the finished product.  I did use a stick blender on the mix a couple of times during the cooking.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent and Easy!  What more can you ask for?  This was the first time I ever made apple butter, and my family couldn't eat it fast enough.  I was fearful that my crockpot would not hold that many apples so I cut the recipe in half.  Can't wait to make again.

This was a very easy and very tasty recipe!  I followed everyone's advice  reduced the sugar to 2 cups.  I also used more than 5 12 lbs. of apples - more like 8 to 10 lbs. and it was still sweet enough.  After peeling the apples, I chopped them in my food processor and then cooked for 18 hours.  I used my stick blender and things smoothed up wonderfully!  I'm getting ready to can it right now in 12 pint containers.  This will make a wonderful addition to our Christmas gift baskets!  Thanks for this great recipe!!!

Wonderful! Easy to make. I made it overnight and filled the jars in the a.m. I added a bit of fresh ground nutmeg, lessened the sugar to 2 cups and added a little more cinnamon. Super recipe!

I read the reviews and added 1/4tsp allspice. I also started it at around 12pm left it on high for an hour then turned it down to low, that night at around 10pm I set it to warm. The next morning I put it back on low for about 4 hours then took off the lid and set it on high for about 3 hours. I also used my immersion blender to blend it which worked wonders. Oh, I chopped the apples up in my processor before putting them in the crockpot. I checked to see if it was done by placing a wooden spoon upright in the center of the crockpot till it stood up straight on its own. I then filled canning jars and bathed them for a half hour. It turned out great. The long wait is well worth it. I'll definitely use this recipe again.

Here's what I learned - use a soft apple-like red delicious.  I used about 20 of these and added in 3 honeycrisp apples because that's what I had.  The red delicious apples cooked down smooth after about 12 hours in the cooker, the honeycrisp ones left it a bit chunky.  You could run it thru the blender or food processor, but I just chopped my apples into tiny bits by hand.  The type of apple you use will make a difference in the smoothness. I made more than the recipe calls for -  I filled up my 6 1/2 Q cooker to the top and ended up with about 4 C of apple butter.  Do not be tempted to add a lot of extra spices based on a lot of apples because the flavor will become concentrated as it cooks down.  I used 2C brown sugar instead of white for additional depth of flavor.  You can add more sugar & spices as needed after it has cooked down for awhile.

Really good. Added my own spice. 1 hour is not enough to simmer out the last of the liquids. I did about 2, and it was still watery - but amazing flavor.
I added Cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, allspice and did a mix of granny smith and other apples I had laying around.

Good recipe, I like the addition of cloves. Like nearly everyone else I cut back  the sugar to two cups and even that was too much.  Here is a tip. If you blend the apples before cooking there is no need to peel them, and it is better for you.

I made two batches simultaneously. One with the 4 c white sugar and one with 3 c white and 1 c brown sugar. The one with brown is richer and darker, but both were terribly much too sweet. I wanted to try the recipe as is even though some reviewers said to reduce the sugar. The flavor is spot on and all is not lost. I did add allspice and increased the cinnamon a little. Just my taste. I will try this again next fall and maybe halve the sugar or just add more apples. Great recipe though minus the super sweetness.

Delicious. I used a blender about half way through the cook. It cut the cook time in half, based on the spoon test on a plate. I was ready to leave it overnight, but it was done - perfect consistency, amazing taste.

I was using Cortland apples, which are sweet enough in my opinion, so I added only about a spoonful of sugar for half the described recipe.  Still super tasty and a real treat on toasted bread.

Everyone liked it. I thought it was easy I did cook longer than the estimated time. I didnt have cloves and it did seem like it was missing something so I ended up adding pumpkin pie spice and cooked for another hour. I used 12 fresh picked apples and it came out extra sweet. I dont think it was 5pds though.

This is a great method for making Apple Butter. I didn’t follow the recipe to the T....only in that I didn’t measure everything exactly and I cooked the mixture for as long as it took to get the correct consistency. This meant cooking it for about 15 hours on low!!(Plus the 1 hour on high in the beginning).

We have made it twice and the only thing we changed was the amount of sugar, we didn't put as much but I think that depends on your apples.

This was super easy and delicious! I followed the advice for how to check if the apple butter was done and had to cook with the lid off for much longer than the original recipe called for.

I use Macintosh apples since they're on my property.  I cut very small pieces and fill crockpot 3/4 full.  I cut the sugar and cinnamon by half but use 1/4 teaspoon of salt and cloves.  By far the easiest recipe if you have a lot of apples.  I get a ton of complements on my butter.  Thanks!

Oh my gosh this recipe was simply the best! I definitely used all the sugar, cinnamon, and clove just like the recipe stated. While the apples cooked down I cut up more apples and added to the batch so that it filled up my crockpot as one of the other reviews suggested. Great, great tip! This was the most delicious apple butter ever! In fact I made it three days ago and it is completely gone because all of my friends have devoured it LOL!

Made half the recipe and shared the results. The finer you chop the apples, the smoother the results will be (even though everything gets soft and cooks down).  When we got tired of eating it with toast, I served some of it with pork tenderloin.

Other than using 2 cups brown sugar plus 2 cups white sugar, I kept recipe the same.  Delicious!  Super easy.  I used the immersion blender towards the end to smooth out the consistency and allowed it to cook further without the crockpot cover.  Canned the results to use as hostess gifts and for friends.  Makes 20 small gift jars.  Can’t wait to try it on a lovely baked Brie for Thanksgiving!  Yes, it is sweet but you can always adjust to taste.  I will try reducing sugar to 2-3 cups for next time, but keeping it 50/50 for white/brown sugar.  Will definitely make again!

I found there were quite a few adjustments to making this recipe work; the outcome really depends on the type of apples you're using.  Also, 1 hour with cover off was nowhere near enough for my preference of thickness.   For the 1st batch, a neighbor gave me honeycrisp off their tree.  Since they're already quite sweet, I added 1/3 c white sugar & 3/4 c brown sugar, which balances out the sweetness & gives a caramelly flavor.  Let it go all night in the crock on low, used my immersion blender & had it sit about 7 hours w/ lid partly off to get the thickness I wanted.  The next batch was a blend of the remaining honeycrisp & others I had on hand.  After the step of immersion blender, I wasn't at all happy with the taste.  Added more sugar, more cinnamon, a tbsp of vanilla.  After letting it thicken, it still tasted kind of flat, and any further adjustments would make it too sweet or too spicy.  I'll be using it more for apple butter muffins & bars so it doesn't go to waste.

Just made this last night and finished it today. It took a little longer to cook (about 12 and a half hours) but that could be because I just cubed the apples instead of finely dicing them. The house smelled amazing while I was cooking it so I wasn’t complaining.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of allspice and upped the cloves to 1/2 teaspoon as well cuz I loved spiced apple. I also cut the sugar in half (only added 2 cups) as a few of the other reviews suggested. Next time I make this I might only add 1.5 cups of sugar cuz it still came out sweet. It’s a bearable sweet though, not sickly sweet. This recipe is definitely staying in my fall collection though.

This recipe was so easy and delicious!   Hubby and I went apple picking and brought home 25lbs of apples, in addition to baking lots of goodies, I decided to try my hand at apple butter.  It came out absolutely perfect and I even tried canning for the first time (with directions I found online) and I was successful!   I'm back now to make my second batch!

I made this with 14 lbs of apples (prior to peeling and cutting them up) and divided it between two crock pots.  I only used 3 cups of sugar in each crock pot but still used 2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of cloves in each crock pot.  IT IS DELICIOUS!  We ended up canning it and came out with only 8 pints after the apples cooked down, but it was well worth it.

So glad I found this recipe!  I made this twice.  The first time I made followed the recipe exactly; using Granny Smith apples.  My husband loved it.  I thought it was too sweet, so I made another batch to use for holiday gifts.  I used 2 cups regular sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, again using Granny Smith apples but left the peel on.  After I removed the lid, I used a stick blender to break up the chunks and peel.  For me the second batch was perfect.  With less sugar you can taste the apple and keep the tart bite.  I also canned using a 5 minute hot water bath to preserve.  Makes a great gift and soo easy!

USE LESS SUGAR!! I used Granny Smith apples, 2 cups white sugar, 1/2 cup light brown sugar, and spices as listed in recipe. I ran peeled and cored apples through food processor before adding to crock pot. I cooked 1 hr on high and then on low for about 14 hours. Removed lid and cooked for 1 hour and when tested water was pouring out of it. Used a stick blender to get to butter consistency.  I had to cook a total of 5 hours after removing lid.  It’s dark brown and very caramel tasting, which is very nice, but then the sweetness hits and it’s overpowering.

I love this recipe!  It came out like apple butter should.  It is a bit too sweet but I will work on that.  I like nutmeg in apple recipes so I added nutmeg and I used an emersion mixer to smooth it out.  Yummy!  This will be my "go to" apple butter recipe.

I’ve been using this recipe for two years now. I’m so grateful you shared this with us. West Virginia is known for making some of the best apple butter by far! My daughter is a apple butter critic and compares them all to the apple butter fest in Ketser WV. She took two jars home after eating some for dinner so this recipe Made the grade in her book and mine! ! never would have made homemade apple butter if it wasnt for this crockpot recipe. BTW the house smells so good while cooking it too! Thanks for sharing with all of us!

Used 3 cups sugar. And a little more cinnamon. Perfect
I let it cook all night (use a crock pot liner) ran it thru my blender for perfect smoothness, and canned it.

I found that this recipe was way too sweet. I only added 1cup of sugar but next time won’t add any. I used a mixture of Granny Smith, fuji, and gala apples and thought they would balance each other out.  Not the case.

I added a lot more spices to it, about 2x the amount of cloves and a lot of dashes of pumpkin spice mix to it. It's very sweet (I do love sweet though) so I might only do 3 cups sugar next time. It didn't take more than an hour like some other people said to thicken at the end. Prep time is a LOT longer though (2 hours maybe to skin, cut, and cube apples), so take that into account or else you'll be like me, frantically whisking apple butter smooth at 3 am. Would make again though!!!

TOO SWEET! I was not going to peel and cut 5 lbs of apples so I only did 3 and cut the ingredients in half. I did 2 cups of sugar and its too sweet. We went apple picking and got Macintosh apples and cortland so I'm guessing the apples were already sweet. If there is a next time, I'm going to try something different.

This is now a family favorite! I ended up just placing all ingredients into the crockpot, set in high and let it be all day. I did none of the extra steps for cooking. I also subbed in 1/2 cup brown sugar and left out the clove and replaced it with 1 tsb of pumpkin pie spice. That was a big hit!

This is amazing ! It's going to be hard to go back to putting jam and preserves on my toast !
We went apple picking last weekend and I had over 20 lbs. of apples in the house. I picked this recipe to use some of  the apples but  wasn't sure, the family was going to like it. So I halved the recipe and I realized later that it was a mistake ! Everybody loves this apple butter !
Thank you Terri for sharing this recipe on AR.

Followed the recipe and added a teaspoon of lemon juice. Might consider 3 1/2 cups of sugar next time. It is a bit sweet. Someone did say this could change the consistency. Cooked on high 1 hour, 8 hours low still covered. And three hours low uncovered.

SO EASY!   I love apple butter and so do my kids!  It's fun for kids to help with too!  I've made 2 batches and they have similar tastes even though I used different apples and varied the amount of sugar.  (In my first batch I used "junk" back yard apples of unknown variety and added Zesters.  The Zester broke down as it isn't as firm of an apple as the back yard one) In my batches I added 1/2 tsp of cornstarch to give it a thicker consistency.  I also used a hand emulsifier to smooth out the gritty texture.  I will be making several more batches and canning this keeper recipe!  I've never made it before and I can't believe I've missed out on it all these years!

I cut the recipe in half because I didn't want to make a lot. I loved the ease of the crock pot method and the apple butter is nice and spicy. My only complaint is that it seems a lot sweeter than the apple butter I grew up with. It's very much like jam in it's sweetness level. I would probably cut back on the sugar in the future.

Great and so easy. I didn't even know what to aspire to, as never had apple butter in my life. I just reduced the sugar as everyone else suggested. It came out so good, my american mother in law loved it, that means it must have been good. Thanks for sharing it. It was actually the very first thing I cooked in our newly bought house and the smell was divine.

I will definitely make this again!  I had to make a few adjustments.  I used a mixture of golden delicious and granny smith  apples.  I used 3 teaspoons of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of nutmeg, 1 teaspoon of allspice, and 1/2 teaspoon of clove.  I kept the salt at the recommended measurement. After reading the other reviews i decided to go ahead and cut the sugar in half to 2 cups as well.  At hour 7, it was intensely sweet.  I added about and 1/8 cup of unfiltered apple cider vinegar.  This seemed to do the trick.

I used apples from last fall that I had froze, a mixture of Gala and Granny Smith, cut the sugar in half, added 3 teaspoons of cinnamon and added 1/4 teaspoon of allspice.  Turned out spectacular, can't wait to share with everyone.

I agree that this one is a keeper.  I even forgot about leaving the lid off for the last hour of cooking, so mine has a little juice on it, but we don't care. It is delicious.

This is certainly an easy way to use your extra apples.  I've made this many times with different varieties of apples.  I found if I cooked down the apples for a few hours and then tasted them before adding the sugar I had a better idea of how much sweetener to add.  Today I had 5 medium gala apples and only used 2 tablespoons of dark raw blue agave with a tablespoon of cinnamon and left out the cloves.   I used my stick blender to blend it smoothly after it was in the crockpot for 5 hours on low.  I let it cool before putting it in the refrigerator as I'm not canning.    I liked the idea that if it does separate, I can always cook it some more.  Mine usually isn't around long enough to do anything but eat it.

Awesome recipe! For future users, be sure to spend a bit more time finely chopping the apples. I used New York State Macoun Apples and it worked out quite well. Planning on putting this on banana bread so that it blows everyone’s minds!

I followed the recipe and it turned out yummy. It will be made again. My family likes the small chunks of apples that didn't soften. So I guess that I won't change anything.

I have used several different types of apples with great success.  I do, however, cook this for a long time.  Usually 6 - 8 hours longer than recipe recommends.  I like my apple butter thick!

I made this and it was great!
I cooked it for about 12 hrs but it needed at least 14,
also, make sure you taste your apples before adding the sugar, I only added 1 cup of sugar and it was a bit too sweet,

I used a mix of Ida Red, Rome & Golden as this is what was available to pick at the farm I went to.  Due to the type of apples I was using, I cut the sugar down to 3 cups but this was still too much.  Next time I would cut it down to 2 cups and use brown & white sugars.  (I love  dark brown sugar flavor)  The other spices were right on and so were the cooking time.  I like my butter thicker so I did cook it a bit longer with the lid off (about 2 hours more).  The flavors blend after sitting so it tastes better the next day.  My house smelled wonderful!!!!

I have a Fuji apple tree and always looking for different to make. This is delicious. I did make a couple tweaks because I am always looking for ways to cut back on processed sugar. I only added 2 cups of coconut sugar and a 1/2 cup regular sugar. I found it sweet enough. I have to pick the rest of the apples off the tree and I know what I am going to make more of. Perfect for presents. It was a little juicy rather than thick so I just used a slotted spoon and used my processor for the apples. if you need to add some of the liquid you can. I  didn't and it came out perfectly thick.

I used a tart, hard apple (Arkansas Black Apple) and this is the
best apple butter I have ever made.  Also it was also the only 
time I did't add something as it was cooking.  I went exactly
by the recipe and it was outstanding.

This is delicious, but - as others said - WAY TOO MUCH SUGAR.  I  made just over a half recipe, and used 1/3 cup sugar.  I don't think I even needed that (and they were tart apples).  I also added a whisper of lemon peel and ginger.  Great way to make a butter, though.  Would make again.

This was super easy.  I bought a box of Gala apples at costco and they were mealy.  So I looked this recipe up and busted out my apple peeler.  I changed a couple things and did half brown sugar for complexity and added some lemon juice because Galas are mild.  I put it in my crock pot for about 12 hours  with the lid off and it was dark and thick (and a little more than half the original volume).  This is a first time for me on apple butter and it wont be the last.  (I live in Washington... so many apples)

Real easy hardest part is peeling the apples, and the apples chosen are based on sweetness.  I used Gala, which were on sale.  Made a quart and a half with some for breakfast.  I can see adding raisins,and/or dried apricots for added texture and sweetness.

This was so easy and the taste was amazing. I used the Granny Smith apples off of my tree and cleaned them during the evening hours. I then put them in my slow cooker before bed and they were ready the next morning. I ended up making about four batches, enough to get through the winter and give some as gifts to friends. Definitely a keeper.

This was such a great way to use our apples. I gave away so many jars of fresh apple butter. People loved it and I had to make several batches . 
The only thing I added was a touch more cinnamon. But it was great!! Thank you soo... much.

Excellent!! I made it with Honey Crisp apples, and since they are already pretty sweet, I only added 2 cups of sugar.  They cooked longer cause I fell asleep,  but I still gave it another hour to thicken a bit more.  I will definitely make this again!  Matter of fact a double batch cause the apples cooked way down.

First time I made this I used Gravenstein apples.  It came out beautiful!!  Smooth and not too sweet.  Decided to try Fuji apples the next time.  Followed recipe exactly. Was still a bit chunky and yet kind of watery so I used a hand-held potato masher to try to smash the chunks and then I simmered it for a couple of hours on the stove top.  Was too sweet for me.  Next time I will use Gravensteins again. My son  remarked, when he first tasted it, that it was too bad we couldn't put it in a bowl and eat it like applesauce!!  Highly recommend his recipe!!

I love this recipe! 

We used a mix of apples. Cortland, Honeycrisp, Empire, Jonathon, and Macintosh. 

I used a mixture of  local honey, brown sugar, and apple cider to sweeten. 

We went lite on the sugar at first only adding brown sugar and honey- around half of what the recipe called for.  Let it cook all night and tested sweetness. It was tart. Added cider to taste and let it cook down for another four hours until thickened up. 

My wife and I both agree that this is the best apple butter we have EVER had. 

Five stars!

I only used 2 cups of sugar and used 2 heaping teaspoon of cinnamon and a very small amount of lemon juice. Followed directions and cooked all night on low.
Took apples out and process in my Bullet and return to the Crock-Pot, cook on high until reduced to desired consistency, let cool and placed in containers in the refrigerator. Love the recipe and will make again ??

Smells and tastes delicious! Easy to make. Although, I added only about 1.5 cups of sugar instead of 4 cups. And, I cooked it a lot longer than the recipe called for. Turned out great!

This is a great beginner recipe for canning. Apple butter is enjoyed by my entire family, but it's so expensive. I had some mixed apples laying around about to "expire" and decided to give this recipe a try. It didn't disappoint! Maybe next time I will try a different type of Apple to see if the flavor is enhanced, but the family is thrilled with the results.

Used June apples from our tree- they were tart! Cored the apples but did not peel them. Used a food processor to chop  before mixing with the spices and sugar. Didn't measure the apples except to put in as many as my crockpot would hold.  Did not have cloves so used allspice.  Used an electric hand blender to make it smooth after cooking and didn't need to cook with lid off- was already thick. Very tasty and easy- especially like that it doesn't require a hot water bath.   Thank you for sharing this recipe! We have more apples to come and look forward to putting them up for friends and family.

I thought this was superb and I really enjoyed making it- certainly better than anything you will get in a jar!  I would have given it 5 stars but I did have two people tell me it was so sweet that they couldn't eat it- of course, I also had one that said he liked it better than regular apple butter because it was so sweet.  I think I will probably try it with far less sugar next time and see if that makes it more popular.  I really loved this though and I would recommend it highly.  Adjust for sweetness as you'd like.

Made this with half granny smith & half johnathan apples and cut the sugar to two cups. Cooked with the lid ajar the entire cooking time and it came out perfectly.

Making this was a huge mistake! It's so good and addictive, I can't stop eating it with bread or just by jar.
My mom said we wouldn't need to buy jam from grocery stores anymore, because this is so much tastier and healthier!
I don't think this batch will last a long time. :)

I cut sugar by half than indicated, but it was still plenty sweet. I'll use even less sugar next time.

This is the most wonderful apple butter! I use about 5lbs of Golden Delicious apples as it calls for and use 2 cups of sugar instead of the 4 cups and it is perfect--exact right amount of sweetness!

I had a variety of apples that I had to do something with.   I cooked it for about 24 hours on low in my crockpot because I didn't have time to process it.  It carmelized just a tad as a result and is the best apple butter I've ever made. I didn't take the time to chop it too finely. I used an immersion blender after cooking it.   I canned it using a water bath canner. It's delish!

This is an excellent recipe that I make every year and can as gifts for friends and family. My  only variation is that instead of white sugar, I use raw cane sugar instead. Absolutely LOVED by all that receive it.

TOO MUCH SUGAR! If your apples are sweet, do half of the sugar during the majority of the cooking. Add additional sugar as needed toward the end.

This recipe was great! I would have used maybe 3 cups of sugar... as it was really sweet with 4, however delicious!  It doesn't get any easier. I did blend apples in nutra bullet to get that smooth consistency.

[Bourbon Kick] I halved this recipe, and it is more than enough for my personal use and to give a jar away to a friend.  I used mostly golden delicious and granny smith apples for my batch and thought the recommended sugar ratio was fine.  I grew up with sweet and caramel-like apple butters, so I like my apple butter to be sweet. My main tweak is I added 3 oz. of Makers Mark Bourbon to this to give it just a hint of bourbon flavor, which I think goes incredibly well with this recipe and helps make it a little more manly for me.

This was my first attempt at apple butter and it turned out amazing!  I grated the apples instead of chopping, cooked on high for an hour and then about 11 hours overnight. It was a deep brown color in the morning and smelled so good!  I took the lid off  and let it cook more, about three more hours until it wasn't watery anymore. I don't have an immersion blender so while I was sterilizing some jars I put it in my Blendtec and smoothed it out some. Poured into jars and gave them about a 15 minute water bath to seal. Christmas goodies all done!!  Really easy recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly. I used honey crisp apples and was able to can 3 pints. I cut the apples up in 1/4 inch cubes but even after slow cooking for about 13 hours I still used my electric mixer for about ten seconds in the crock pot to improve the consistency.

I love apple butter and decided I wanted to try making it. The prep work for this took much longer than I expected and I even used an electric fruit peeler. I chopped the apples  (Golden Delicious) into very small pieces. I only had a cup and half of sugar (forgot to check before I started) but based on some of the reviews, I decided to just go with it. Turned out to be just the right amount of sugar. I followed the cooking directions as written except that I had to let it cook about 2 hours with the lid off to get the right consistency. I was afraid it was going to be too lumpy but I stirred it with a whisk when I removed the lid and it was perfect. I ended up with four 8 ounce jars which was a bit disappointing - next time I will double the recipe.

Good taste but a bit runny to me.  Will make again with the following changes:  Cover for the first hour then uncover for the next 10 to 11 hrs or so.  Also, add more cinnamon.

I used a variety of apples and guessed at the 5 lbs. but it turned out really good. It is very dark though and very thick. I was disappointed that I only got 4 pints out of this. Very easy to make.

This is my go-to recipe every year. I love this recipe. I do always end up having to use a hand mixer at the very end of the cooking time to get the texture I personally prefer. Great for gift giving!

I made this recipe today and it's really, really good!
I used 5.5 pounds of apples (macintosh & honeycrisp) and the recipe yielded two 10 oz jars of apple butter.
I did not add four cups of sugar - I used two cups of brown sugar and half a cup of white sugar.  That decision was based on the sweetness of the apples used -- the macs were a little tart.
Yes, it's a little time consuming to peel and chop the apples  and yes, the cooking time in the slow cooker is long but the end result is worth the wait.  I can't wait to try it with pork tenderloin!
Thanks for a great recipe.  Definitely will make this recipe again and again!

Like everyone else had to cook for several hours without the lid to get it to thicken up and I used half the sugar.  Kids and hubby love it.  Will definitely make again.

This was my first apple butter experience. I used Golden Delish apples. Only used 3lbs since I was not sure how it would turn out.  I also only used about 1cup sugar. Did the high for an hour then put on low and went to bed. I left it in for about 11 hours and some of it was burnt on the side but it did not effect the flavor at all. This is a keeper!! Easy and actually low in fat and sugar.

I got this recipe yesterday, I took 3 wringled Macintosh about 1 lb.  6 oz sugar, a light covering of Vietnamese cinnamon and 4 sprigs of clover hand ground and a dash of
sea salt.  chopped apples put in 1 quart crockpot for 23  hours, stirring occasionally.   Was great on toast and I have
a cup leftover.  I was thinking of throwing the apples away.
Now I have another cost saving recipe.  What about strawberries in the future.  after 1day in frig butter was 
thick.  so low only works

I made this for my husband because the stores here don't sell his favorite apple butter. The only change I made was to add 1/4 tsp allspice. He said it's the best apple butter he's ever had!

Yes I will make this again.
The only thing I did was use a variety
of apples you will be surprised of the
flavor my family can't get enough of it.
I make it often also when I make apple sauce
I do the same thing I just can't get used to 
using one kind of apple in my pies even
very flavorful.

I've made this a couple times now and it's very good.  I increased the amount of apples to 7-1/2 lbs and kept the sugar about the same (3-1/2 cups).  This was good for my taste.  I seemed to get good results in the prescribed time so this was not a problem.

I have made this several times and really like the recipe. I hadn't made it in a while and couldn't remember if I "doctored it" at all so made it exactly as stated except that it needed to cook longer uncovered.  Next time I would definitely cut the sugar (and next time will probably be tomorrow!)

I started making this double batch in the middle of the day, so I had to change one thing.. I used the stove top (same ingredients)
I used a peeler/slicer/corer best thing ever! I wanted this to cook faster so I  also used my Vita Mix to puree all the apples . This step took a bit more time but in the end was worth it because the apple butter is silky smooth !
I cooked it on low for about 2 1/2 -3 hours with lots and lots of stirring. This turned out to be easier and less time consuming. My Daddy is an apple butter snob but he loves this!!

I followed the recipe exactly. I had to turn the slow cooker off much earlier than recommended because it was starting to burn.  Tastes ok.  Probably would not make again

Easy and delicious!  Use a variety of Apple's to play with the flavor.  A great canning recipe.  Just 20 minutes in a boiling water bath and you will have a great gift for friends.

I used 10 lbs of McIntosh apples that I pureed with the peel in the food processor beforeI cook in the slow cooker. I did not double the rest of the ingredients and used half Demerra sugar and half white sugar. I cooked for about 15 hours, the last 5 with the lid maintained slightly opened with 2 butter knives set across the slow cooker. It yielded 17 half-jars (250ml). I processed in boiling water bath for 15 minutes. The whole family is begging for more!  LOve love love this!

The only thing I changed was the cooking time. I wanted thicker butteer so I cooked about 2 hours cover off until I liked the plate test result. I did not use wisk just waited and used (boat motor) hand blender at end. Out of world reviews from all who received a jar

This recipes was great-my entire family enjoyed it. I did minimize the sugar to 2 cups and it was plenty, and I also used a hand mixer to blend it and eliminate the chunks. The final product turned out  great and I will definitely be making it again. Thanks!

I can't really rate it yet because it's cooking and only has been for about 2 1/2 hours! -But I had to in order to post this review. I had to triple the recipe because I need about 15pints. I cut the amount of sugar in half because I used a mixture of Granny Smith, Gala, and Red Delicious, and the latter two are very sweet, and most reviewers said the given amount of sugar was way too much. I can always add it in the morning if necessary. I used allspice instead of cloves, bc that's what I had, and I'm cooking all 15lbs of it in an 8qt crockpot. I also added about 1/4 cup of apple cider to add a little more Apple flavor.  I'm making this for the first time ever as Thanksgiving treats for my boyfriends family and I'm praying it all turns out okay!!! (I'm worried about not getting the right consistency, and it being too sweet) but I'm reading that I can continue to cook it down or transfer it to the stove to reduce it. I'm not sure how I could reduce the sweetness unless I got a ton of tart apples and cooked them down and added them.

I cut this recipe in half due to the amount of apples I had. I ignore the other reviewers saying this recipe was too sweet (as I have a sweet tooth) and I am sorry that I did. The recipe as written for me is way too sweet. Other than that the apple butter cooked up beautifully.

I went outside and picked 8 apples and made myself up some Apple Butter with this recipe.  LOVED that it was done with a crock pot!  I also just added 2 cups sugar but I did add about 1/4 cup brown sugar.  It is DEELICIOUS!  I did what someone else said, and used my hand held blender to chop up more but did leave with a few apple small chunks which I love on my toast!

I never made apple butter before but I got curious when I saw it on TV... oh wow it's really good.  REALLY good.  Though it came out more like jelly or applesauce... I don't care.  The taste is amazing.  Thank you for this.  It's great.  I can't wait to share this with people.

I only had a couple of apples so greatly modified this recipe, but it was a great starting point!  I prepared and cooked everything the same way, but only had 14 damaged macintoshes.  I used 3/4 cup packed brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, 2 heaping teaspoons of cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon salt.....no cloves in my pantry.  Put it on high at 830pm for an hour, turned it low over night, stirring any time I went into the kitchen.  Pureed it in the morning around 830am with one of those hand-held things.  Kept the lid on for an hour.  Then took the lid off.  It was about 130pm that I finally turned the crock pot off.  The amount I made was enough to fill up 5 empty spice jars I had around.  The consistency is perfect!  Thanks!

Turned out beautifully and tastes the apple butter my grandmother used to make when I was a little girl. It is really worth all of the effort.

Great recipe and easy.  I cut sugar in half (cook longer if you need thicker consistency). I used Rome apples, which can be either sweet or slightly tart - i winged the amount of apples.  I didn't cut apples as small as indicated, used my hand wand in the crock to make applesauce consistency. If you don't have a wand, you could use potato masher but should cut smaller as indicated. Friends have requested the recipe, so it's a keeper.

this is wonderful, however i leave the lid off the last two hours at least to get thicker. one hours is not enough in my estimation.. we have a hughe copper kettle that we do apple butter over an open fire and this is equal to that taste.  luv it

Combined the ingredients as written. Cooked longer as it didn't thicken up enough for me at the suggested time. Very tasty!

I used 4 heaping teaspoons cinnamon, and a heaping teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.  Delicious!  I used my Pampered Chef peeler, corer, slicer thing and you threw the apples in the crock, and then dumped the other ingredients on top.  Mixed it around then cooked as directed.  I threw it all in the food processor and pureed it after 12 hours on low.  It set up perfectly and didn't need that hour of cook time with the lid off.  Next time I will try to make it as directed bc it's a little too spicy for me.

My first experience with Apple butter & canning. I used Fuji apples, 2C white sugar and 1C brown- and could have done with a little less sweetness. I will try one cup of each next time, and there will be a next time because this recipe tastes great! My only problem with recipe--like many others--the time seems to be way off. I read others' reviews so I was expecting it, but after cooking with lid on for 12 hours, I cooked it w/o lid for another 5+ and it still seemed as though it needed more time. But I was impatient and wanted to can, so I am hoping for the best. Also...sauce was still very lumpy at about hour 15 so I put in blender and returned to crock for another couple hours before calling it done. And, finally, I got five full 8oz mason jars out of it.

I have never tried this stuff before but it was great! I had to cook it a lot longer then it said here until it was thick enough but all in all it was awesome, instead of using all white sugar I used 1 cup brown sugar instead, I ran out of white sugar but it still turned out great! It smelled great was a bit nervious to try at first but I Loved it!

Absolutely marvelous recipe!  Thank you.  Also thanks to other reviewers with such tips as cook until it mounds on a test spoon, and to cook till there is no liquid that forms around the mound.  I made it with home -grown, hardy prairie apples from our tree - much like MacIntoshes.  Will try with our much more tart yellow apples next time to experiment with different apple sweetness.  Happy cooking everyone!

Near Lexington, Kentucky are several orchards. One of the things that makes old time apple butter is to use fragrant apples right off the tree! It is a great way to preserve a large harvest especially with rising food cost. One of the ways that I core a large number of apples is to cut the apple in half and use the small end of a mellon baller to remove the seed core. I only remove a shallow half ball to conserve the apple. This is a great recipe, I cook mine in a slow cooker on low. I will probably have a hard time sleeping because of the great smell filling the house. When I "can", I use a digital thermometer right down the center to insure it is over 160 degrees F.

I didn't have enough apples to make the large batch, so I had to 1/4th the recipe, but I figured it would still work. I think it did, although I'm not sure what it's actually supposed to be like. Anyway, it turned out really dark and almost gel-like and I was really hoping for it to turn out lighter like the picture. Also, next time I think I will pulverize the apples somehow so that it comes out smoother, with less apple bits. Anyway, it came out alright, but I don't know if I will make it again.

This recipe is just like the one in the Blue Book of canning.  Only thing different is the salt.  No need for it.  Just makes it a bit more unhealthy.

wow! I made this apple butter for the first time and it was outstanding, my husband said its going to be an all time favorite. I already have plans to make it during the holidays. The only thing i did different and would request is using splenda for those who are diabetic or watching their calories! same great taste.

This recipe is AMAZING!!! I followed the recipe exactly, and found that it was perfect. It is pretty sweet when you eat it straight by the spoonful, but on homemade buttermilk biscuits, a delicious little bit goes a long way! I am thrilled to find something so simple and wonderful to do with all the apples from my trees. I am planning to make several batches, can them, and give them away for the holidays! Thanks Terri!

I've made this recipe many times and always receive big compliments. The cooking time does vary, so be prepared for it to take longer than you might expect. Be sure to cut your apples into very tiny pieces to speed up the cooking process.

I've never had apple butter before so I don't have anything to compare this to.  Nevertheless, it seems to have turned out very well.  I cut the recipe in half and only used 3/4 cup of sugar and it's still sweet enough.  (We have really tasty apples around here.)  Also, I don't have a slow cooker so I just left the whole thing on the electric stove in a non-stick pot; it worked perfectly.  I'm sure I'll make this again, thank you very much!

I made this for my dad as a Christmas present, spread it on some toast and it was good, though a little sweet (I used granny smith apples, which are pretty sweet on their own). The process of making it wasn't too labor intensive since the slow cooker does  most of the work. The hardest part was chopping the apples, which can get pretty exhausting if you don't have a food processor.

This turned out great.  I used 4 red delicious applies and 4 granny smiths. I only used about 2.5 cups of sugar, and also added about a teaspoon of "pumpkin pie spice". I put it in the crockpot at about 8pm, cooked it on High for 2 hours, then Low overnight. In the morning, I took the lid off and cooked it for a few more hours until it was the right consistency (see notes on testing for doneness from other reviewers). This recipe gave me 4 half-pint jars of delicious apple butter.

I read many of the reviews before cooking and decided to cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups. I added a lot more cinnamon because we *love* cinnamon here. :-) Aside from peeling and cutting the apples, this recipe is incredibly simple. Your house will smell amazing and you friends and family will be impressed, even if you insist it was easy to make! I would check online to make sure the apples you are using are appropriate for this kind of cooking.

I made this with Red Delicious apples and cut the recipe in half because my slow cooker is small. I cut the sugar since Red Dels are sweet, and next time would cut it even more since I like it pretty tart. I would also add nutmeg next time - I didn't have any. This was really good on banana bread but I think I prefer jams and jellies to apple butter, so I intend on using the rest of it in recipes.

I would have never dreamed making such delicious apple butter could be so easy. I have one of those gadgets that peels, cores & slices the apples all at once, so in a matter of 15 minutes the ingredients were in the crock pot. No fuss, nearly no mess and the end product is simply wonderful. I used Granny Smith apples. I might cut back onthe sugar by 1/2 cup next time.

This is the only way to make apple butter...I started out making it by following the recipe in my ancient Ball book (my usual preserving bible), but they never specify exactly how long it takes to cook this down to the proper consistency, and after 3 hours I realized I had had enough.  I canned what I had (basically very dark red super thick applesauce at that point) and chalked it up as a failure.  Then I found this recipe!  I uncanned what I had and put it in the crockpot on high for about 6 hours and on low for another 6.  It caramelized beautifully without burning or sticking; I used two wooden spoons laid across the top of the pot to balance the lid on and let the steam escape.  I recanned what I had and tried it this morning - wonderful!  The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because I did not make mine from scratch in the crockpot as the recipe says - I was starting with my own applesauce.  So I can't speak to the success of doing it that way.  In future this will be a great way to "use up" the remainder I have at the end of a day of making applesauce that isn't enough to make a full canner's worth.  Thanks so much again!

Absolutely the best - the house smelled amazing in the morning (cooked overnight) and only took about 1 hr with lid off to cook down.  Water bathed and got 6 jelly jars full.  I'll definitely be making more!

This recipe is great! I did take advice from other reviews. I added the Allspice and used a mixer before I canned it. I used a large crock pot 5 qt. So I had to triple the spices. My family loved this recipe. I put up 14 pints for the winter.

Easy recipe.  I followed it pretty close, except I cooked it longer. At the end it was lumpier than I wanted so I just ran it through the blender and that made it thicker and smoother.  We used little apples off the tree in our yard!

I made a batch of this a while back and sent a jar to my daughter who said make more!  I did add more cinnamon and cloves though since we love them and did 2 cups of brown sugar per other reviewers.  It is very good and easy.  The only thing I didn't like about it was it didn't make enough.

Scaled this recipe down.  Good stuff!  Started it first thing in the morning and after spending a chilly damp day at a pumpkin patch/corn maze came home to an AMAZING smelling house.  Delicious on English muffins.  Thanks so much for the recipe!!

This turned out nicely, but I will only use 2 cups of sugar next time.  I upped the cinnamon to 2 Tbsp., and I don't think it was too much.  Mine needed about 12 hours uncovered to pass that test about putting a spoonful on a plate and looking for watery separation.  I was afraid it would burn during that time, and my daughter thinks it tastes burnt - I don't though.  I used Paula Red apples.

Very good, I have never tried apple butter before this. I will cut down on the sugar and cook over night next time per suggestions from previous reviews. I also increased the amount of cinnamon and cloves that the recipe called for. It was still very good even w/ the amount of sugar suggested though.

Awesome recipe.  And I love the fact that it doesn't require constant attention.  I did decrease the sugar to 2 c. based on the sweetness of my apples, but otherwise I made as written.  Mine was ready after 9 hours on low and 1 hour of cooking with the lid off.

Excellent recipe except too much sugar! I used 2/3c of white grape/peach juice and it was just right.  Next time I'll try cran/raspberry juice.  Added a little extra cinnamon and cooked 24 hrs.  Had an awesome carmel color and tasted good on ice cream!

This apple butter is awesome!  I cut the recipe in half (70 servings) and am already wishing that I had made more.  I used Fuji apples (which are pretty sweet and juicy on their own) and only put 1/4 cup sugar in and it was still sweet enough for me.  Will be making again soon!

I let this cook over night and the flavour was so intense!  I would just use a little less cinnamon and less sugar, but the sugar depends on the sweetness of your apples, so it is really up to you to be the judge.

This turned out pretty good. I cut the recipe in half because i was using a small crock pot. There is a lot of sugar in this recipe and next time i think i will reduce it. its just a bit too sweet. otherwise, great recipe.

This is the first time I've even tasted apple butter but it sounded good so I made some. It is delicious! I love this recipe because I can put it in the crock pot and just leave it. I did put the it in my food processor after it had cooked down and then cooked it a couple of more hours. My parents also loved it and they keep reminding me that they are almost out :)

Very good I will make again and again. I put the apples thur the food processer first I could then use it hot and not have to wait for it to cool blend and reheat. I do have to say the first time I made it I was overtired and multitasking and made it with 5 cups of apples not 5 lbs huge diffrience.

Thanks for a wonderful recipe!.  We went apple picking yesterday and I was looking for a new way to prepare some of them.  I also used three cups of sugar (1/2 brown and 1/2 white), as suggested in other reviews.  Cooked it all night and ate some this morning!!  What a wonderful aroma to awaken to!! :)

I followed the directions exactly and was very pleased.  It wasn't too sweet for my extremely tart apples.  Very easy.  I'm canning lots of it to use as Christmas gifts this year.

Excellent recipe!  I made this with Granny Smith apples for a holiday bazaar and it sold out within the first hour!  I have made it several times since then and it turns out perfect each time.  Will definitely be making this one again!

The only thing I can add to all the other reviews is that the immersion blender is a must.  The consistancy to me was a little apple-saucey, until I whipped it at the end.  I used 1-1/2 cups sugar and used both winesap and golden delicious from local orchard. My local walmart was out of canning jars, so for this batch I used Rubbermaid "Twist & Seal" 1.2 cup size and are freezer safe.  I will can my next batch though when I can locate some jars.  Very nice seasonal project.

Oh, YUM! This is so good. I took the advice of previous reviewers and used only 3 cups of sugar with my granny smith apples, 2 cups white and 1 cup brown. It was still a little sweet for my taste, so I will probably reduce it to 2 cups next time. I also used allspice in place of the cloves, because that is what I found first in my spice cabinet. I have the cloves somewhere, I just didn't want to dig! This was my first time making apple butter, and I will definitely be making it again. I also canned it to give away as gifts. (First time for that too, and surprise, surprise, it worked!!) I got about 7 1/2 half pint jars. Thanks for the recipe!!

I've never tasted apple butter other than this one, so I don't really know how to compare it.  My husband and baby and I all really like this tho.  Took forever to thicken, but I did make a double batch.

I tried this recipe a while ago and forgot to rate it.  It is easy to make and so good.  It reminded me of when I was growing up and my Mom and Dad would make apple butter.  Thanks for the recipe.

Easy to make, cooked it all night and all day, a little runny, but I've never made apple butter before so maybe it's sopposed to be that way but I was expecting a thicker consistancy.  Made Pork chops with it!!  Delicious!!  My son loves it on toasted cinnamon bread.

I used Cortland apples, 1 1/2 c sugar, cooked on High 4 hours. Took it out put it thru the food mill, cooked on low another 5 hours. BWB 15 minutes , 7- 1/2 pints.  Sure tasted good, not too sweet, have to wait until Grandma tastes it to find out how good it really is.  Sure was easy enough.

I gave this a 5 star. Very time consuming even with a peeler, apple corer, and chopper. But it really turns out great. Very tasty. I wish it had smelled up my house like the others had experienced. I used all red delicious with one each of the following: fugi, yellow delicious, gala and roma, which I got from a recipe from another recipe. Because these apples are naturally sweet you can cut down on the amount of sugar to use which makes it more healthy. I am fixing to start on a second batch today to give out as presents. Thanks for sharing.

Very tasty.  I cooked mine several days and also cut the sugar.  I used the food mill, so it was lump free!
