I have been making this exact recipe (minus the can frosting, see my frosting recipe below) for almost twenty years now.  This is a great make ahead dessert to take for gatherings because you really do have to make this the night before or it won't taste right and allow the graham crackers to become soft.  Try using chocolate graham cracker and French Vanilla or Cheesecake pudding!

**If you have the time, make this chocolate sauce (It is a dead on ringer for Outback's chocolate sauce.)
Mix 1/3 cup cocoa, 1 cup sugar in sauce pan.  Add 1 teasp vanilla, 1 stick butter, 1/4 cup milk.  Boil for 1 minute, then set aside to cool.

This is a very popular recipe that I had tried long ago before this post.  The reason so many commented on the frosting being too much for this dessert is a common error.  Many times when a recipe gets passed on to family and friends they leave something out or is comes with personal amendments.  The similar recipe I enjoy calls for you to microwave the canned frosting (IMPORTANT TO REMOVE ALL FOIL FROM INNER SEAL FIRST) for 15 seconds only.  Including this important step changes the consistency of the frosting to a glaze.   It really makes all the difference in the world.  I have never used the whole can of frosting yet,  I save unused portion by replacing lid and storing in refrigerator for another use for up to 2 weeks.

I think this is an incredibly easy, delicious dessert if you make a few alterations. Tips: DON'T use frosting, (in my opinion its too heavy and sweet so it's all you taste) instead use the Chocolate Sauce Recipe below (it'll only take a few extras minutes... Also refridgerate 24 hours before eating so the graham crackers get nice and soft...I use French Vanilla Cool Whip and f.v. pudding for a little something extra...mmmm....Hope I've helped. 
Chocolate Sauce REcipe: originally submitted by BaysChick (Thanks so much!): Mix 1/3 cup cocoa, 1 cup sugar in sauce pan. Add 1 teasp vanilla, 1 stick butter, 1/4 cup milk. Boil for 1 minute, then set aside to cool.

I read some reviews and they said that there was nothing to rave about because the desert tasted simple.I tried it anyway and everyone at Thanksgiving dinner was in awe.  They LOVED it!  My suggestion is that you let the desert sit for about ten minutes before icing.  This way the graham crackers mould together with the pudding and it makes the graham crackers easier to ice.  I prepared my own icing and by the time the icing was ready, the pudding and graham crackers were at just the right consistancy where the graham crackers would not break when icing. Try this recipe - everyone will thank you for it!  Enjoy!

This is so easy and so tasty!  I recommend heating the frosting in the microwave for about 30 seconds and then pouring over and spreading like a glaze (make sure foil wrapper is completely off container first).  Makes spreading the frosting so much easier.

Outstanding!  You will definately need 3 packages of graham crackers to do the three layers as described.  I use a box of French vanilla and a box of cheesecake pudding.  For the frosting, I used a recipe from this site that is no longer available.  It was a chocolate sauce from Bays Chick. The recipe is as follows: 1/3 c. cocoa (I used Ghirardelli unsweetened cocoa), 1 c. sugar, 1 stick butter, 1/4 c. milk.  Bring to a boil for 1 minute.  Remove from heat and add 1 tsp. vanilla.  Cool completely. It thickens nicely and tastes absolutely fabulous! This frosting makes this dessert out of this world!!

I have made a simialr dessert.  Instead of using graham crackers, I use graham crumbs and I use a jar of melted Nutella spread for the top.

In one word...WOW!  This recipe is awesome, one of my top favorite desserts.  Its SO easy to make, requires little to no chill time, and tastes just fabulous.  I doubled the recipe and it layers to the top of a 13x9 pan.  My neighbors absolutely LOVED this dessert.  I do one layer of chocolate pudding (mixed with cool whip) and one layer of vanilla.  I microwave the frosting for 60 seconds and it easily pours over the top for a blemish free perfect glaze.  Just be careful, the frosting is liquid so take caution when removing it from the microwave (I ruined one shirt, LOL).  This recipe is the bomb though, everyone TRY IT!

This dessert takes only about ten minutes to whip up and is very very delcious. I would highly suggest preparing this the night before you plan to serve it, so that you can leave it in the fridge for about 24 hours so that the graham crackers can get soft. The softer the graham crackers get the better the dessert is. Also, it would be best to microwave the frosting for about one minute before topping the dessert off with it. Will definitly make this dessert again and again!!!

This a great recipe my Mom used for years and everyone raved about it. ..just the way it's written. How can so many people rate a recipe when they change all the ingrediants, i.e....made my own frosting, used choc and vanilla pudding etc. If you want to put a new recipe in , submit one , but give and honest review on the recipe the way it's written so we know whether to try it or not and stop changing the ingredients. Put the changes you make in your own recipe box.

This tasted exactly like what it was:  a bunch of graham crackers covered with pudding and whipped cream.  After all the rave reviews, I guess I expected a miracle.  I'm sure I won't bother with it again.

Simply delicious, soooo easy to make. Trying to follow the recipe to a T, was just a little off. Not by much but however, 2 individual packages does not fill a 9x13 pan. I used almost 3 packages, I had to break a few pieces down to fill in gaps across the entire pan to completely cover from one end to the other...but not a big deal, I wasn't going to let anything go to waste not look like slop because it didn't set up right..don't be afraid to use more graham crackers to fill the pan. And one other slight adjustment, was trying to spread the prepared frosting evenly across proved to be a small challenge, So in order to cover the top with out slotching my crackers and pudding mix everywhere, I popped the frosting in the microwave for a least 1 minute, gave it a quick stir and poured over the top evenly and then placed it in the refrigerator for just a bit to set up nice and pretty....Worked out better then expected. It was simply delicious and my kids were drewling over it. I'll totally make this again and again. Totally yummy.

This does taste very much like a chocolate eclair. The only change I made was the chocolate topping, I used the one I make for real eclairs: CHOCOLATE GLAZE: Melt 1 stick butter in sauce pan. Add  1/3 cup cocoa, 1 cup sugar 1 teasp vanilla,, 1/4 cup milk. Boil for 1 minute, then set aside to cool. This is a quick and easy recipe and is fun for the kids to make. You can use cheesecake pudding mix also

This is sooo good!!!  I just made it yesterday and I'm still treating myself to a good portion today!  I definitely cannot stop eating this!!!  I agree with other reviewers that the reason why this eclair is so good is because it isn't too sweet and rich--and that's what makes it soooo perfect!!!  The yummy pudding tastes like delicious custard instead and the chocolate topping compliments it perfectly!  Microwaving the chocolate frosting and pouring it on top makes it sooo easy to frost!  However, I disagree with some viewers that this is not a very presentable dessert because it is!  It all depends on your creativity and skills.  I was able to crack the graham crackers to fit in between the small cracks on the side of the 9x13 pan and frost my dessert perfectly.  I also poured white chocolate in horizontal lines then used a knife to draw vertical lines over the white and regular chocolate frosting to create a very fancy effect!  Therefore, this dessert is perfect for dressing up or down depending on your level of expertise!

I make this recipe every summer for a family gathering and it's always the hit of the party.  I also microwave the frosting and use only 1/2 as a glaze.  Also, I mix it up and use the chocolate graham crackers sometimes, or if it's Thanksgiving I mix a can of pumpkin pie filling into the pudding and layer it between the cinnamin flavored graham crackers.  Then put cream cheese "glaze" on top.  You can't go wrong!

I too made this after reading all the rave reviews. I should have known better looking at all the pre-made ingredients but I decided to try it. It tasted to me like a pre-packaged hostess dessert you buy at mini-mart. Really bad. I'll never make it again.

Everybody really enjoyed this recipe.  I used chocolate graham crackers and french vanilla pudding.  I was skeptical about letting it sit for a very long time, but it was definitely better the second and third days.

Great dessert for a pot luck or a crowd.  I took the advice of previous reviewers and warmed my frosting in the microwave for 1 minute .  I wanted to try making this with the pastry cream recipe from this site like another reviewer....using that in place of the vanilla pudding, but was pressed for time. Update - have made this several times since first finding the recipe. I spread chocolate ganache over the top and chill overnight.

This was so quick and easy, I only had 20 minutes after work to put it together, and I even had time to spare!  Make sure you don't crush up the graham crackers on the bottom though, it didn't specify to keep whole; so now ya know!

I've also been making this dessert for years.  It was handed down to me by an aunt and she gave me a couple tricks to making it.  When getting ready to cover it with icing, melt the icing in the microwave for 30 seconds before using.  Mix it well and then simply pour it on. It goes on like a ganache and makes a beautiful smooth top. I also use a dark chocolate fudge icing.  It's not too sweet and it tastes amazing. For the pudding I use french vanilla, or I add in a couple drops of vanilla extract. You also want to let it set for at least 24 hours before serving.  This allows the graham crackers to soften and take on some of the flavor of the pudding.

For ease of preparation and crowd pleasing appeal - five stars all the way! This certainly does taste like an eclair, but my guests kept saying they loved the "Boston Cream Pie":) I used one box reg vanilla and one box french vanilla pudding. One change I made as I was running out of Graham Crackers was to add a layer of ladyfingers in the middle layer - really good texture/flavor difference. I used the chocolate sauce submitted by BaysChick and it set-up beautiful. (Mix 1/3 cup cocoa, 1 cup sugar in sauce pan. Add 1 teasp vanilla, 1 stick butter, 1/4 cup milk. Boil for 1 minute, then set aside to cool) For those who are interested, I have also made this dessert with sugar free pudding and splenda for baking in the chocolate sauce with great results! Sooo Good!

I know this is a delicious dessert because I've had it before. So I followed the recipe exactly as written and the pudding mixture turned out all soupy and runny...I didn't realize until after it was all mixed together that you're supposed to boil the milk and pudding mix before mixing it with the whipped topping. I will try this again...wish it was written this way in the directions.

I just made this dessert and it is very easy and very impressive too.  I did microwave the frosting for 1 minute first, and then it easily poured on top of the dessert.  (just remember to remove the foil covering and put the lid back on the frosting tub before microwaving)  I got rave reveiws from my family and I will be making this again, but I might try the cheesecake pudding mixes.  Thank you for a yummy recipe!

I took the advice of previous reviewers and frosted the graham crackers before placing them on top, made it much easier. I also let it sit for 10 hours so the crackers were moist. DELICIOUS, no one could believe how easy it was to make.

This is the same recipe my Mother made years ago. Only change I highly recommend is the topping. Melt 2 squares unsweetened chocolate, 3 Tbsp. butter. Add 2 Tbsp. White corn syrup, 3 Tbsp milk, 1.5 cups Powder Sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla. Spread on top. Much better than chocolate frosting.

Delicious and so EASY! I accidentally grabbed sugar-free banana cream pudding at the store and when I got home I just decided to go with it and it turned out even better! I used the banana cream pudding and actually layered sliced bananas in one layer, then topped the whole thing off with store-bought chocolate frosting. I let is sit in the fridge most of the day and severd it after dinner. DELICIOUS!! My in-laws were visiting and they raved and raved about it. Even my husband, who never likes dessert said its his new favorite.

This was delicious!  I made it for the holidays and used the chocolate graham crackers.

Updated:  Made this again using regular graham crackers for 4th of July.  As another reviewer from a similar recipe suggested, I was short on time so I quickly dipped the graham crackers in milk before layering them in the pan (use a small dredging dish or a plate w/ a lip).  This allowed the cake to be ready to cut shortly within 2 hours (perhaps even sooner!) after preparing.

Updated again!  I have made this several times and found that I always need to use just about a full box of graham crackers.  Perhaps it's my pan (I'm using one of those metal cake pans w/ matching metal lid that slides on).  Also - be sure to melt your "milk chocolate" frosting tub (foil removed) in the microwave for about 30-40 seconds and then just pour it over the top.  It will harden nicely once refrigerated.

If you're looking for a super quick dish - that's tasty and inexpensive - this one is for you. You can make this dish using ingredients purchased at Aldi or Walmart for under $5!

This is a great recipe.  I use chocolate graham crackers instead of the plain ones.  If you have a problem putting the icing on the top, try to ice each individual graham cracker before you lay it on top.  You will not have any leftovers!!!!

I was first introduced to this wonderful recipe at a bridal shower about 30 years ago.  The original recipe did call for French Vanilla pudding. Also, rather than a heavy/thick frosting, a chocolate glaze works well.  Originally the glaze was made with a product called Chocobake.  When that was no longer available, I substituted chocolate chips.
Here is the recipe: 1 small pkg. chocolate chips, melted, 2 tsps. white Karo corn syrup, 2 tsps. vanilla, 3 tbls. butter, 1/2 c. powdered sugar, 3 tbls. milk.  Mix together and spread over graham crackers.  The dessert is best when the crackers have had time to soften, so I like to make it the day before.

Love this recipe! My daughter in law asked for the recipe, and said, "that's it?" I've made a recipe like this many times and really liked it, but this recipe says to do two layers instead of one. Really liked the difference two layers made. I also like to make homemade choc. frosting instead of the prepared.

GREAT reviews from co-workers. I took this to a bbq at work. It was all gone! I followed the ingredients to a T. I brushed my graham crackers with milk to make them moist. I also nuked the frosting for about 40sec to make it easy to spread. This is wayyyy too easy to make for how good it tastes. One coworker from another office said i need to bring this next time im up there! THANKS FOR SHARING. Super quick, cheap and easy! will def make again. (i would have taken a pic but it was all gone)

I read the reviews of this dessert and decided to try something different and easy for a change. The filling is beyond sweet and combined with the graham crackers it is really just too much. I also made the chocolate glaze highly recommended and posted over and over which I agree would be better than a canned icing however it was also not very good. My kids didn't like it at all, my husband didn't mind it but agreed it was far too sweet. I wont be making this again.

Couldn't get easier, but is SO good!  I saved the recipe a long time ago, but was skeptical because it was so easy.  I'll be making this anytime I need something quick and easy!

What a great idea!  So easy and delicious.  It amazes me that one reviewer only gave it three stars because it was all pre-made ingredients.  That is the beauty of this recipe - this is not a gourmet professional recipe site!  My family LOVED it.  Do need at least three sleeves of graham crackers, and I would suggest cutting back on the amount of frosting a bit, but otherwise perfect. It really does resemble the flavor of an eclair.  Thanks,Kristie for an easy recipe that is perfect BECAUSE it has all pre-made ingredients!

Took this to a party and it was the first dessert that disappeared!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  DEFINITELY make it the night before serving so all of the flavors have a chance to mix and the texture is soft, like an eclair!  Wonderful. :)

I have made this for diabetics and substitute sugar free pudding and topping (such as Smukers fudge topping).  Graham crackers are a given for diabetics.  Just as good with all the elements of a good dessert.

Oh my goodness,this was irresistible! I honestly couldn't control myself from taking those extra bites! I used one 5 ounce box of vanilla pudding,2 1/2 c milk and cool whip. I also made a homemade choc frosting which equalled to about 1 c so my topping was a little thin but I liked it that way. Nothing was too overpowering because they all blended together nicely. I also crushed the Graham crackers so they would completely cover my casserole dish which was curvy. This dessert is here to stay in my kitchen! Thanks!

This is good, it is what it is - its not a "gourmet dessert" its pudding and graham crackers, but it's very tasty, versatile, and easy to make. I did chocolate graham crackers and a cookies & cream pudding. Also did the frosting in micro - poured great but made it alittle hard to serve - it stuck to everything, a little sweet too, think if I made it again I'd use the chocolate sauce that is floating in these reviews somewhere  lol

This recipe is delicious. After reading the reviews I made a couple of changes: used French vanilla instant pudding, and used Bays Chick's frosting recipe. My own touch to make it seem more like an eclair you were biting into, was to omit the middle layer of grahams. Definitely, Bay Chick's glaze adds the finishing touch to making it taste exactly like a bakery eclair. One word of caution, be careful not to boil the glaze longer than 1 minute, as it cools, it really thickens up.  To cover the dish completely, I had to drop it on in dollops and then quickly spread.

This is an excellent recipe that I have been making for about 35 years and it is still a big hit wherever I take it.  The chocolate topping I use is more like a glaze...not really a frosting.  It calls for 1/2 C. semi-sweet chocolate chips, 2 tsp. white Karo syrup (that I melt/mix together in the microwave), 2 tsp. vanilla, 1 1/2 C. sifted powdered sugar & 3 tbsp. milk (you can always use a little more milk if you want it a little thinner).  Pour this over the top layer of graham crackers & let it set in the fridge (usually I make this dessert the night before).  The chocolate has a real smooth finish to it.  Also, when I mix the Cool Whip with the pudding (French Vanilla) I add a couple drops yellow food color just to give it a little more color, otherwise, I think it's too pale.

I made this for Easter dinner.  My husband, who loves eclairs but I thought would hate it--LOVED IT.  My sister and I thought the chocolate frosting made it too sweet.  Next time I will make 1 box chocolate, and 1 box vanilla and then spread the cool whip over the top layer (I've had it like that before and liked it better).  Thanks!

My friends loved it! I used 3 sleeves of graham crackers and used two 3.4 oz french vanilla pudding mixes - turned out great.  Don't forget to nuke the frosting in the microwave for 45 seconds or so, makes spreading a breeze. Left it in the fridge overnight to let the crackers soften. I read another review where it said that this dessert tasted like a "pre-packaged hostess dessert".  My response to that is that this dessert doesn't pretend to be a high-end gourmet dish, it tastes just like an eclair and it tastes great!

This recipe had so many great reviews I just had to try it for myself!  I had all the ingredients on hand with the exception of two pkgs of vanilla pudding, but I did have one as well as a white chocolate one.  I went ahead and mixed the two together and proceeded with the recipe.  It was awesome!  I just might stick to that combo! Out of this world considering the simplicity!

DELICIOUS!!!! I made this dessert the night before a big family dinner, just to test it to make sure it was good. Between my husband and two daughters and I, we almost finished it off! I did two things differently on the second one I made. I put chocolate pudding on the bottom layer and french vanilla on the top. I also used vanilla wafers for the "crust" layers, instead of graham crackers. My family preferred them to the graham crackers, but both were very good!!!

I made this using two 3.4 oz. boxes of pudding mix and the chocolate frosting mentioned in BaysChickâs  review.  Like others, I needed almost three full sleeves (an entire box) of graham crackers.  I really liked the idea of this, but Iâm sorry to say I wonât be making it again.  The flavor was ok, but for me it was a disaster to serve.  After cutting my squares they were impossible to pick up with a spatula.  They just wouldnât stay together.  Needless to say the presentation was sorely lacking for me.

Every time I make this it get rave reviews and am asked for the recipe. I tell them to go to all recipes.com. 
  I change the puddings every time and always use a home made chocolate frosting recipe which ware on this site. This time I used cream cheese pudding. The
 time before I used chocolate pudding and cinnamon Graham crackers. I love chocolate and cinnamon. It is just fun to play with and always enjoyed from seniors to children. I garnish with different chips/toffee chips/nuts. Always fun and good.

Did not like at all.  Just tasted like vanilla pudding with a bit of chocolate frosting on top. Not reminiscent of an eclair

This is very easy to make and my whole family loves it.  We make it for every get together.  We also warm frosting for the topping.  It spreads easy and tastes great!

Made these this past weekend. Sooo easy!!!  I did use French vanilla pudding and melted the chocolate frosting. Let chill in the fridge for a few hours.  It was so good I went back for seconds myself. Will definitely make again.

Super easy.  I used the chocolate sauce recipe mentioned in other reviews since I already had these ingredients on hand.  Love that it makes a 9x13 pan, but doesn't need baking.

This is an easy and very good dessert.  I've made it many times playing around with different options and I've found the following to work best for my family: I make it at least 1 day ahead (or 2 if there is time!), I use the chocolate icing reciped that many reviewers use (cocoa, butter, sugar, vanilla and milk) but I DOUBLE the frosting recipe to make a nice layer of fudgy topping.  Make sure you do NOT allow the frosting to cool too long because it becomes very difficult to spread if it gets too cool - a bit warmer than room temp is the best so that it drizzles out of the pot into the dessert.  You will need AT LEAST 3 packages of graham crackers, if making a 9X13 pan.  And you can use vanilla or banana pudding...both taste yummy!

Yummy!!  This is the perfect dessert to make a day or 2 ahead.  I really think that makes all the difference.  I made this the night before Father's Day -sat in the fridge about 17 hours before first tasting.  We thought it was OK, but not worthy of 5 stars.  I told my husband I didn't think I'd be making this one again....  However, after another night in the fridge it was awesome!  Definitely deserving of 5 stars.  Super easy and delicious - as long as you let it sit long enough (probably 24 hours).  I also used 3 packages of graham crackers instead of 2.  Zapping the frosting for 15 seconds or so (depending on your microwave) is also a must.  I can't imagine trying to spread it on.  I agree with other reviewers that the frosting is a little much.  Next time I don't think I'll use the entire container, but I will definitely be making this one again.

I love this dessert!  I made it for Father's Day and it was a huge success.  I bought canned chocolate icing but decided to make the icing recipe provided by BaysChick since I had all the ingredients.  It was still a little on the sweet side so I would recommend adding 1/2 cup of sugar and then more depending on your taste.  The icing also turned out a bit gooey because we ate it as soon as it was taken out of the fridge.  Maybe let it sit at room temperature for a while before cutting into it.  I will definitely make this one again.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

so quick and easy, took to a picnic and everyone loved it.  Used the reccomended frosting recipe, very good! Don't hesitate to make 2 days in advance, after the second day it had more of an eclair taste/texture.

Or family makes this all the time! I personally got a little burned out  ( but I'm not a huge chocolate lover). As a variation I have used 1 box of French Vanilla pudding and 1 box of Cheesecake pudding. Instead of chocolate frosting, I top it with 2 cans of cherry pie filling. Sort of like a mock cherry cheesecake ;)

This is a true family favorite. I have a different recipe for the frosting, it is still pretty sweet but it seems to set up a little firmer, which I like.  The frosting is:2 squares baking chocolate, melted, 1 tsp. white corn syrup, 1 tsp. vanilla, 2 T. margarine, melted; mix all of this and add 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar and 3 T. milk or a little more if needed to make a nice consistency.  I took this to a gathering and it was a huge hit.

This recipe rocks!  It's easy and it's delicious as is, but I've also made it with a few changes to suit our tastes. I've done chocolate graham crackers with oreo cookie pudding and my very favorite is cinnamon graham crackers with cheesecake pudding. I suppose it strays a bit from the eclair taste but it's fun to mix it up a little. Thanks for the recipe!

Great Recipe!!  Been using this for years.  Only twist I add is 2 cups of milk instead of 3 and 1 can sweetened condensed milk.  The filling is awesome.

I took this to my small group on Wed. night and they loved it.  One of the ladies asked for the recipe and will be taking it to a church luncheon this weekend.  I used the cinnamon graham crackers and they added a nice flavor.  Microwaving the icing made it so easy to spread.  Oh yeah, my 7 year old daughter did most of the work, it is that easy.  Do be sure to refridgerate it.  We made it at 7:00 AM and ate it at 6:30 PM and it was a perfect texture.  It is even better the next day.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Just made this for Christmas and it was a big hit with everyone, especially the kids. I used french vanilla pudding, and microwaved the frosting before simply pouring it on top. It was easy and quick, and it might be fun to try variations with this recipe such as cheesecake pudding or chocolate covered grahams.

I LOVE this one, EVERY time I make it the family and friends RAVE!!! Excellent for potlucks, easy to make! I use French vanilla pudding to add a bit more flavor, and a dark chocolate frosting because it is a good balance to the ultra sweet taste!! Also FREEZE for about an hour before frosting and be sure and let it set in the refrigerator overnight. Excellent recipe!!

This is absolutely to die for!! My 3 kids and husband loved it.  It is for the kitchen challenged.  Very easy.  I used white chocolate pudding instead of vanilla.  This will be a keeper to pass down!! Thanks for the recipe.

Our family and friends all love this dessert!!  Being a real chocolate lover, I use one package of chocolate (or chocolate fudge) for the first pudding layer.  Of course, you must divide your milk and whipped topping.  This definitely needs at least 8 hours in the fridge, and the icing needs to be microwaved to make it pourable.  Never any leftovers!!

What an easy no bake dessert!  I halved the recipe and it was delicious, but you do need to use more graham crackers than the recipe calls for.  I took everyone's advice and used French Vanilla pudding and heated the frosting a bit in the microwave.  I made this in the late morning and served it after dinner and it was perfect.  My family declared this a keeper.

This recipe quick, easy, and yummy.  The first time I made it to recipe.  The second time I added about 3 ounces of cream cheese to make the flavor a bit more sophisticated.  We liked it much better.  I also made it the second time for just a couple people and crumbled the crakers, mixed them with the pudding (just one box) and put it in a casserole dish.  Worked great.  A very nice summer weekday dessert.  Thanks.

I really enjoyed this dessert.  It's so easy and the softened graham crackers makes this taste like a real eclair.  The only changes I made were French vanilla pudding and I melted the can of chocolate frosting in the microwave for about 30 seconds or until it was easy to stir.  This way I just poured the frosting on, smoothed it out a little and chilled it for a few hours.  Perfect.

It really does taste just like an eclair! However, I found that it is much easier to cut and eat after it has been refridgerated for several hours or overnight so the graham crackers can soften. It was better the 2nd day.

I used chocolate graham crackers in this dessert and nuked the chocolate frosting a bit for ease in spreading. This dessert will take its place on my dessert buffet coming up later this month.Thanks Kristi.

I was skeptical of this dish because it looked way too easy to be good.  Thankfully, I was wrong- it's delicious!  It tastes a lot like Boston Creme Pie, only it's much easier!  I can't emphasize enough how much the taste and consistency improve as each day passes.  It's best to wait a few days before serving, because once you do, it will be gone in a flash!

Easy and Delicious!  I didn't have chocolate frosting on hand, so I omitted the top graham cracker layer, and made a blueberry topping (similar to the Topless Blueberry Pie recipe, but with only 2 c. berries and no butter)  for it.  Also, the longer the dessert sits, the graham crackers become more "eclair-like".  Mine sat for 7 hours, and the crackers were soft, but still identifiable.  Overnight seems to be the way to go with this one!

This is unbelievably easy, and SO. GOOD.  The 40 second microwaving made the frosting spreading easy, instead of a nightmare.  I might try using Lady Fingers next time, to get more of a chocolate eclair feel....Thanks!

Everyone loves this. It is really good. However, it needs to sit in the fridge overnight to gel properly.

Everyone that tries this dessert loves it! So simple, so delicious. I took the suggestion to make a chocolate topping instead of using frosting and it tastes wonderful. This is the recipe I used:  1/3 c. cocoa, 1 c. sugar, 1 stick butter, 1/4 c. milk. Bring to a boil for 1 minute. Remove from heat and add 1 tsp. vanilla. Cool completely.

Awesome! Such simple ingredients turn into a delicious dessert. To take it up a notch, you really need to make your own chocolate sauce for the topping instead of using canned frosting. Mix 1/3 cup cocoa, 1/4 cup of milk and 1 cup sugar in sauce pan. Bring to full boil, stirring frequently. Boil for one minute, remove from heat and add 1 tsp vanilla and stick of butter. Allow to cool a few minutes before pouring over top layer of graham crackers. Note: I've also halved this recipe in 9x9 pan with good results. You'll need closer to three packages of graham crackers if you make the full recipe.

I have made this for years but with one major difference.......the topping - I use a jar of fudge ice cream topping just slightly warmed enough to pour and spread. It will "harden" back down in the fridge. If you loved this with the frosting then it is "to die for" with the fudge topping:):)

This is delicious!  I made it exactly as stated and used dark chocolate icing.  I served it at Thanksgiving and even my father, who usually doesn't have much of a sweet-tooth, went back for seconds.  I did make this the day before and allowed it to refrigerate overnight.  The texture was perfect that way.  I also sent this in with my husband to a potluck at his work and he returned with a dish that looked like it had been about licked clean.

Try this with saltines,salted or unsalted and you will love this better! The saltines soften and turn flaky just like a real chocolate eclair should.

This must be the best dessert on the website.  It is so easy and so good!! can't believe it isn't ranked first!  A couple of modifications:  use BayChics chocolate sauce recipe. Canned frosting just doesn't cut it for this dessert.  Also, I used one pkg vanilla pudding and one cheesecake.  Next time, I will use two cheesecake pkgs. This will be my new fall/winter go-to dessert.  (Try Strawberry Refrigerator Cake for a great Spring/Summer dessert).

This is the simpliest, most tastiest dessert I've ever made!!! Everyone raved about this at our party today. I've had to copy the recipe for 3 people. I was unable to make it the night before so I did take the advice of others and dunked my graham crackers in milk before lining my pan with them. Worked out perfectly! I do have to say though that just two packages of graham crackers does not make it. I used nearly 3 in my 9x13 pan. I'm so glad I had a whole box of them. Thanks for this recipe! It's definitely a keeper for me.

Its definitely better the next day! Very easy. Everyone really liked it. The second time I made it I added some 6 oz of cream cheese to the filling and I thought it tasted better. If you do this soften the cream cheese then mix in the milk, then add the pudding. I also made my own whipped cream -1c heavy whipping cream (whip 1 minute first then add sugar and vanilla), 1/4 c powder sugar & 1 t vanilla.

I've been making this for years with a few minor changes. I use french vanilla pudding and I use two 8 oz containers of cool whip.  I also make this using skim milk and light or fat free cool whip and everyone loves it.  I think the chocolate frosting is a must but I also microwave it for 15-30 seconds to make it easier to spread.  And you most definately need to leave it in the fridge for quite some time for the graham cracker to soften(usually overnight).

I LOVED this recipe! I took it to a Christmas party, and it was the first dessert gone, and the only one that was completely eaten! I did follow other reviewers advice and used the chocolate glaze instead of the frosting. Very good, simple and fast!

I made it in a 8x8 square and cut the recipe in half.  Also it is important to note you should microwave the iceing to soften it up.  its been mentioned several times here and makes all the difference.  Just 10 to 15 seconds and stirr.

This one was so easy and quick and got rave reviews from my coworkers. I used half vanilla and half banana cream pudding because that's what I had one hand. I also used lowfat graham crackers and whipped topping, used almost a whole box of crackers and only half of the frosting. I wouldn't call it health food, but it is lighter than many desserts and is still rich in taste. Will be making this again very very soon!!

If you are trying to make this fast, try another reviewer suggestion that you dip the graham crackers in milk before layering them.  It works great!  I served the dessert in about 3 hours after I made it and it turned out nicely.  I also used the other reviewer's hot fudge recipe instead of the frosting.  A few extra steps, but totally worth it!

Wow, this dessert is delicious! I actually made this a single serving by taking a small bowl and breaking the graham crackers to fit the bottom of the bowl. I used fudge covered graham crackers. I made homemade vanilla pudding and just proceeded to prepare the dessert as directed. I also made a chocolate sauce as recommended by other reviewers. I covered the bowl and let it sit as directed and then proceeded to dig in! This is such a wonderful treat and I like that I can make it in single serve sizes, so I won't have any leftover. Would also be a treat to serve as individual desserts to guests.

My mom used to make this recipe years ago before it had an official name, but this is the exact recipe she used.  This has always been my favorite.  A little tip though, you have to make it a day ahead, possibly even two and it is just that much better.

My mom has been making this recipe for years to rave reviews. The main change she made is to use softened cream cheese instead of the whipped topping. (I'm not sure if anyone else commented on this before.) It definitely makes it more decadent!

I like this dessert!  I know that some people did not care for it when it got soggy, but that is when it really took on the "eclair" taste!  I had my hubby try some right after I made it and then the next day and he preferred the second day's serving.  I have to agree.  It was soooooooo yummy!  I live in the middle of nowhere and milk is expensive, so I used powdered milk and it still turned out GREAT!  I will DEFINITELY make this again!

This dessert is definately a keeper! Don't be fooled by its simplicity. You can experiment with the frosting, cool whip, and pudding flavors and add spices to taste. The graham crackers turn soft like a crust. Yum!

Oh, this was AMAZING and sooo easy too!! We made it with cinnamon graham crackers and cheesecake flavored pudding mix. We also melted the chocolate frosting in the microwave and poured it on top of the dessert...yum! Breaking the graham crackers into squares makes it easier to serve. We made it in the dorm, and it didn't make that much of a mess :)

Very good and easy. A good recipe for young children to help with. The longer it sits the softer the graham crackers get. I make it all the time. Once I tried cinnamon grahams and we did not like it at all. Make with the regular grahams only.

I have been making this for over 3 years now and it is always a hit!  I only do 2 layers of graham crackers, add amaretto to the filling (gives is great flavor) and use store bought icing that I melt and drizzle over the top.  So easy, so good; it's one of my staple deserts.

Definitely the easiest and most delicious dessert I have eaten for some time.Just 2 points to remember.First is to make the chocolate sauce as advised by some other reviewers:Mix 1/3 cup cocoa,3/4 cup sugar in saucepan.Add 1 tsp vanilla,2 tbsp butter,1/4 cup milk.Boil for 1 minute.Set aside to cool.Then frost the dessert and cover with cling film.Set in the referidgerator for 24 hours(thats the second point to remember!).This is a must so that the crackers get real soft.
Thanks a lot for this recipe and the other reviewers who pointed out the need to referigerate for 24 hours as well as the sauce recipe.

This is a great easy recipe. I made it last night and only refrigerated it for about an hour before serving. It was pretty good but the graham crackers had not softened much. I tried the leftovers today and they are awesome. I did have to use some vanilla wafers as I ran out of graham crackers. Either way this was much better the second day. Update 7/12/17 - made this for dessert tonight. I allowed it to set in the fridge for 8 hours. It was delicious. I did feel like the chocolate frosting was a bit thick for my liking. Next time I will microwave it and pour it on while it is warm to get a thinner layer of chocolate.

This dessert is awesome!  I love how the graham crackers are soft when you let it set long enough.  I used Pillsbury milk chocolate frosting and I agree that it is very sweet.  I happen to have a serious sweet tooth, so it won't stop me from enjoying it, but others may want to try one of the  chocolate toppings that others have mentioned.   Also, I used one pkg of vanilla pudding mix and one pkg of banana cream.  Really tasty!

Using a can of frosting microwaved for about 30 seconds makes it SO much easier to spread on the top. This has become my "signature" dessert. I have a friend who won't let me in her house for any social event without this! It's by far the most popular dessert I've ever made. And it's so easy! Definitely better made a few hours before serving and putting in the fridge to let the graham crackers soften a bit. Then... perfection!

Yum, yum, yummy, yum!  This is such a easy, quick dessert.  Great for summer without needing the oven on to heat up the kitchen.  Kids and adults will gobble it up.  You may heat up your frosting for about 30 on high to assist in spreading final layer.  You just can't go wrong with pudding, graham crackers and CHOCOLATE Fudge frosting!

This dessert is wonderful!  I made it to take to an office party, and everyone asked for the recipe.  It's very easy to make (only took about 15-20 minutes total).  I, too, will start keeping the ingredients on hand for when I need a quick dessert.  Definately a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

I used a full box of low fat cinnamon graham crackers, breaking into smaller rectangles to fill the pan all the way to the edge. I used French vanilla pudding for the richer taste. I did warm up the container of dark chocolate icing for easy spreading. Definitely let this sit for 24 hours. It softens the crackers and blends the flavors. To die for :)

incredible.  this recipe cannot be overpraised!  i was wary about the graham crackers softening, but they definitely did after refrigerating for no less than 3 hours.  it was just like cutting cake afterward.  i used choc. graham crackers, french vanilla pudding, skim milk, and homemade choc. buttercream frosting on top.  also, i like it just as one layer.  something this good doesn't deserve to be so quick and easy to make!

I took this recipe to a church social last night and it was a hit. I'm sure it must have tasted fantastic, but since it was all gobbled up before I got any on my plate, I'll have to make another one to find out for myself!

This recipe is so delicious and so easy to make.  I've already made it three times.  Takes minutes to whip up.  Definitely make it the day before so the graham crackers have time to moisten.  I also took the advice from other reviewers and microwaved the frosting for a minute or so.  Super easy. Super delicious!

When you bring this to a gathering, make copies of the recipe to hand out!!! So good, so easy, and everyone loves it!! The only thing I would change is to make homemade frosting.(Not too crazy for the grocery store stuff), and microwave it so you can just pour it on.

Holy Moly...This is good!  This is way too simple to taste this good!  I halved the recipe and made it in a 9x9 dish and it worked out perfectly.  I also used fat free whipped toppping and skim milk and still it was so yummy!  Letting it chill over night is key as the crackers take on a nice chewy consistency.  I hvae shared this with my husband, my mom, 2 neighbors (I had to get rid of some or I would have eaten it for breakfast, lunch and dinner!) and ALL REALLY enjoyed it!  This will be perfect for a potluck-YUM!!!

I've been making this dessert for awhile now and just love it!  I've found that if you add more layers of graham crackers it holds its shape better.  Definitely wait for the crackers to soften.  For a change, I've also used cherry pie filling as the topping instead of the chocolate frosting.

I chose this recipe for my 11 year old daughter, because she is always begging me to let her cook and she wanted to do something "all by herself".  Not only did she do everything herself, but it was a big hit in our house and at the neighbors!

This recipe is fantastic but only if you let it sit in the frig uncovered for 2 days.  This sounds funny, but works.  If you eat it any sooner you will have a runny dessert with hard graham crackers.  But waiting 2 days, as the original recipe intended makes it one that everyone will beg for the recipe!!

This recipe is one of our favorites.  To make things even easier, put the tub of frosting (minus the foil top) in the microwave on high for 1 minute, then just pour over the top of the cake.  It'll harden in the refrigerator.  Can't ask for any easier than that!!

EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!! I made a chocolate glaze for mine instead of using canned icing. To make glaze: in saucepan, boil for 1 min: 1/4 C milk, 1/3 C cocoa powder, 1 C sugar. Remove from heat add 4 Tbls butter and 1 tsp vanilla, stir well. Pour on top! This recipe is about 8 pts (WW pts) per serving. I'm going to try and make a lite version of it, as suggested below, to see if I can cut down on the pts per piece! I would love to eat two servings at a sitting!!! LOL! - Sharon

Don't know if anyone has suggested this yet, but I used store-bought frosting and popped it in the microwave and spread it out after pouring it on. It made icing the top so easy.

Easiest dessert to make, but it comes off as something that took a lot of time!  Per others, I use french vanilla flavored pudding and chocolate fudge Pillsbury frosting (melted in microwave for 40 seconds before pouring).  Everyone loves this and I get requests for it all the time!

This is amazing!!!!!The really nice thing is that it is an easy,make ahead dessert {and REALLY should be made the day before you want to serve it!}I followed the recipe to the word the first time {because I HATE it when people change most of the ingredients and then rate it...REALLY???} but the second time I did a layer each of chocolate and vanilla pudding. The third time I made it,I reduced the recipe in half (easy to do and makes a nice 8x8 or 9x9 pan} and put 1/4 c.peanut butter in it.Definately a winning recipe and have always been asked for the recipe... Enjoy!

Fantastic!! Made it for a get together and it was a success.  Everyone wanted a piece for the next day.  Will definitely make it again.  Made bottom layer with chocolate pudding and top layer with vanilla and used real whipping cream instead of cool whip. Used the microwaved icing (chocolate)..

Oh Yum! I made this especially for the kids for dessert at a family BBQ and something else for the adults. As it turned out, the adults loved it too. After checking the reviews, I was sure that frosting the graham crackers with the very thick, prepared frosting wouldn't work and it would also be way too much. I warmed about 1/2 the container or so in the microwave and it spread easily all over the top. You've got to love these recipes you can prepare early in the day and then just whip out of the fridge when it's time. Thanks KBhrens2!

Big, big HIT at our church's potluck dinner!  Some were calling it a Boston Cream Pie.  None was left afterwards and we are a small congregation!  I made the homemade icing that someone recommended in the reviews.  Yummy!

My kids made this dessert, thats how easy it was. We used the trick of microwaving the icing to pour. They couldn't wait a very long time, only maybe two hours and it tasted just fine. In fact I only got a tiny piece before it had been gobbled by all three kids.

This is the dessert I make every Christmas and one I turn to during the year when I need something easy and to die for delicious! I do what other reviewers do and melt the frosting in the microwave for a bit so you can just pour it over the top. I'm thinking of trying it with chocolate grahams, chocolate pudding and vanilla frosting...you just can't go wrong with this. Yes, it's a simple dessert but that's part of its appeal!

My former mother-in-law gave me this recipe over 30 years ago.  The frosting recipe included bakers chocolate & karo syrup as some of the ingredients.  The icing took some time to make compared to how quickly the rest of the cake went together.  Over the years I began to use the canned frosting (microwaving it first).  BUT, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, IF YOU REALLY WANT A TASTE TREAT, PUT THIN SLICED RIPE BANANAS ON TOP OF THE 1ST TWO LAYERS OF GRAHAM CRACKERS.  THEN, PROCEED WITH THE REST OF THE INGREDIENTS.  YUM.  OF COURSE WE CALL IT BANANA CHOCOLATE ECLAIR CAKE.  ALSO USE FRENCH VANILLA PUDDING.
MY SON HAS ASKED FOR THIS CAKE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY EVERY YEAR.  IT'S SO EASY.

Taste just like an eclair. Needs more pudding mix if you are going to keep this a 9 x 13 size pan. Setting the completed mix in the freezer for a few minutes to harden it might make it more serve-able and easier to present on a plate. There is nothing fancy to this recipe, however it is tasty. Plain but gets the job done.

***2nd day review*** My initial tasting of this dish was very blah. However, after it sat and absorbed the flavors in the fridge over night it was WAY better. It set up firm and was easier to slice (like a cake). Superb! My husband can't get enough of it.

I've been making this since I was 14. It's also very eye catching if you put it in a clear dish. I also found it's easier and evenly if you microwave the icing until it's liquid and pour it across the top. Just don't leave the lid on when you microwave it, my friend made that mistake.

This dessert is AWESOME!!!!!! I have been making it for a couple of months now and I always get rave reviews. It's so simple and easy to throw together. HINT: You want to refrigerate for at least a couple of hours to allow the pudding to soak into the Graham crackers. Everyone needs to try this dessert!!!! Yum yum!! :))

Easy and delicious.  Prepare the night before so the grahams have a chance to soften.  Used french vanilla pudding. Also used DARK chocolate frosting that I microwaved for 30 seconds before speading on top.  So good and everyone loved it!!!

This took me literally 5 minutes to assemble, and the recipe was absolutely on point about how many graham crackers I would end up using (some complained that more were required).  I also made the chocolate sauce provided by some of the reviewers, and that sauce deserves a 5 all on its own!!!  Yummy!!!

two words sum this delish dish up.....  
1) E A S Y
2) Y U M M Y !!!!!!!!!
However I don't use the frosting..I use hot fudge as the topping.  It takes about 1 1/2 jars to cover the casserole dish but once it's refrigerated, it makes the best, easy to make eclairs EVER.  My whole family just expects it at all family functions!

EXCELLENT & EASY, A KEEPER FOR SURE.  Thanks KBehrens2 for a terrific dessert.  Husband is diabetic so I used  sugar free pudding & low fat Cool Whip. Took it to a friends for dinner & all loved it & no one could believe it was so good &
was virtually sugar free.  Would recommend doubling the chocolate sauce (thanks to the reviewer for chocolate sauce recipe) as it is very good. Splenda used in the sauce was really good and worked beautifully.

This did taste just like an eclair. A lot of people didn't like the frosting... my opinion is the frosting taste just like the icing on an eclair. I did follow the advice of some of the other reviewers, I heated about 3/4 of the frosting in the microwave before spreading on. And although I personally would probably like the chocolate sauce other reviewers had mentioned more than the frosting... the frosting really makes it taste like a real eclair.
All in all... this was a very yummy dessert, very easy and I was surprised that it comes out of the pan in layers, rather than pudding. I will probably make this for the next family get together.

My mom used to make this when I was growing up and I remembered it fondly.  I gave it four stars as the canned frosting was just overly sweet.  I tried the suggested chocolate sauce in a few reviewers' comments and it was amazing!  I'll use that sauce recipe for other things as well.

I turned this into a two layer birthday cake by using 2 spring form pans and doubling the recipe. I used french vanilla pudding. I frosted the layers with coolwhip and drizzled chocolate granache over the top.

This is the first time I've tried this cake, but of course I put my own little changes in.  Instead of adding 3 cups milk to the pudding mix; I added a can of sweetened condensed milk, 1 cup, ice cold water, and 1 cup milk.  I heated 8 oz. cream cheese, 1/2 a stick of butter and tsp. vanilla,  and added this to 1 lb. confectioner's sugar mixed with 1/2 cup cocoa.  Heating the cream cheese and butter mixture makes a perfect consistency to smooth over top layer...Yummy!

My mother has made a very similar dessert for every holiday, with only a few slight variations.  She uses French Vanilla pudding and, for the chocolate topping, Magic Shell.  The Magic Shell goes on very liquidy and then hardens in the fridge overnight, so making this dessert before is a must.  Always a hit with our family!

WOW this is a pretty amazing dessert considering how quickly it can be put together. I used a 9 x 9 pan instead, used only one package of vanilla pudding with 1.5 C milk. I also used canned whipped cream since that was what my local market carried. Definitely making this again!

Haven`t made this in years,and it wasn`t with the "adjusted topping" that was in the reviews.My husband said it was a make again dessert and he really loves the topping.It makes it look like a high end dessert.BUT was it just me but i needed more grahams then stated.Thank goodness I had extra grahams,so i used half chocolate and half graham.

This was so good.  I did make several changes.  I did soak grahm crackers in milk (because it was for a same day picnic).  I made my own pudding and whipped heavy cream and whipped in.  I also did a chocolate ganche to put on top.  Got rave reviews.  This is a keeper!

Definately a favorite of friends and family.  As several other reviewers said, this is even better made with french vanilla pudding.  After trying another's recipe for a boiled homemade frosting and having it not turn out (I'm sure I did something wrong - as can't make fudge either) this is how I made the frosting:  Melt 1 stick butter in a microwaveable bowl until just completely melted (not boiling) &  wisk in 1/3 cup cocoa until smooth.  Add 2 TBS milk & 1 tsp. vanilla, wisking until smooth.  Sift in 1 cup of powdered sugar and wisk until smooth and creamy.  It was very easy to spread.  This dessert can be made up to 24 hours before serving; the longer refrigerated the better.  Hope this helps someone else enjoy this dessert that I'm tempted to sit in front of the TV with and just enjoy right out of the pan :)

I had never had this dessert until my stepmother made it for me a few yrs ago, I just made it for a class presentation and everyone loved it. The only difference is she uses french vanilla pudding mix and adds a little milk to the canned frosting to make it creamier and spreadable. I also crushed some of the graham crackers and sprinkled it on top of the frosting before serving it, may try some crushed walnuts on top next time!

This was ok...it wasn't as "great" as the other reviews indicated.  It was super simple to make.  I'm glad I tried it, and it wasn't bad, but it wasn't spectacular.  I won't be making this again.

I won a dessert competition and $100 bucks with this recipe!  I used the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" recipe so that I would feel like I actually did something "homemade".  =)  It is wonderful, easy and kids LOVE it!

This was just OK.  I've had much better eclair desserts.  The graham crackers got dry somehow.

I have made this recipe a couple of times and I never have any leftovers to bring home. (too bad!) The only thing that I would suggest is to layer part of the icing in the middle. I found that all of that icing on top is a bit rich for us.

I was looking for an easy dessert to provide for my husband's 40th birthday party.  I made two pans of this and they were both gone in no time!  So easy, and so delicious.  I made it without the chocolate frosting the day before and let it refrigerate overnight.  Microwaved the frosting and poured it over the dessert in the morning and then let it refrigerate until time to serve.  Perfect!

Tempted to give this only 4 stars, because the recipe really should say to make this 24 hrs. ahead of time. It's magic how time makes it taste so much better! Tastes WONDERFUL and is so easy, I had to go with 5 stars!

Holy cow this was sooooo easy and sooooo good!!  I let my 11 yr old do most of it.  I told him this will be his special dessert for family get togethers from now on!  ****NOTE****  This is best made the day before!  As it sits, the graham crackers get soft (cake like) and it's SO much better this way!!  I also heated up the frosting in the microwave (40 seconds on 60% power) then poured on top and smoothed out.  The "creamy" filling is the BEST part of this dish. I ended up using the whole box of graham crackers..not sure why, my pan was just a regular 13X9.  I used sugar free vanilla pudding and 1% milk and it was great! I like it better than REAL eclairs!!  So light and fluffy...yuuuum!

I'm sorry I don't know what the raving is about, this recipe is alright, but not what everyone's been saying. I'm sorry I'm just being honest. My kids liked it of corse, but nothing special for them either. It's blan and lacks in flavor and doesn't stay together very well when you serve it. I won't be making this recipe again. But thank you anyway. : )

This is very good for a couple days, after that it just becomes way too soggy.  I will make again, but smaller batches so nothing is wasted.  Thanks!

Very Yummy!  Followed the advice of others and let it sit 24 hours before enjoying.  I also made the homemade chocolate sauce which was also delish.  I used cheesecake pudding b/c that's what I had on hand.  Also, did not have cool whip but one envelope of dream whip worked just fine.  Will make this again!

WOW WOW WOw I can honosly rate this one 10 stars if i could. I made this recipe with bannana cream pudding and cinnamon grahm crackers. I also made the chocolate recipe by baychick. for the chocolate I used challenge butter and lakeside package of supreme cocoa. The best quality ingredients are going to make the best tasting recipes. And it sure did make the best choclate i've ever had. I had to make two dishes of this recipe The first one was made with the banana cream and the second with the cheesecake pudding. The first one was better and gone the same night except two little squares that i had the next day. I do have to say its much better after setting it overnight I wish I could have waited.

I have made this recipe for years! It truly is better the 2nd-3rd day. The very light frosting recipe I have always used is: 2 pkg. of liquid Choco-Bake, 2 teas. light Karo syrup, 2 teas. vanilla, 1 1/2 cup powdered sugar, , 3 tblsp. melted margarine, 3 tblsp. milk. Mix together in a saucepan on stove, cool, and pour over dessert. Very smooth and DELICIOUS!!

I made this with great anticipation last week. It was easy to make, very little mess or clean up needed. My only complaint is that after being in the fridge, the graham crackers got a little bit on the soggy side. It was still decent but would have been much better if the graham crackers had retained a little of their crispness.

This is THE BEST recipe in the world.  I make it all the time.  No need to make the whole batch.  If I don't have alot of people, I just 1/2 the recipe and use a smaller pan.  There are soooooooooo many possibilities.  You can use chocolate graham crackers with pistachio pudding, or cinammon grahams with french vanilla.  This is the bomb!

This was such an easy recipe! Everyone raved about it - it went very fast! The tiny bit I had left is still in the fridge and just as good as the day I made it! I used french vanilla pudding and extra creamy cool whip. I also made my own chocolate by melting a bag of milk chocolate chips with a little milk and butter in the microwave - it is much better than canned frosting!

This came out great, really easy to make. I used a chocolate glaze recipe that one of the reviewers posted instead of frosting. 
Chocolate Glaze:
2 T butter
1 t vanilla
1/4 C milk
3/4 C sugar
1/3 C cocoa
Boil 1 min & set aside to cool alittle. The reviewer who posted that didn't specify what kind of sugar to use, so I used white. I might try confectioners next time. Thanks for the recipe.

A note on sugar-free pudding: a 1 oz. box of sugar-free pudding is equivalent to a 3 oz. box of the regular, so you still only need two.  It's the sugar that adds all the weight, but it still makes the same amount of pudding.  Tasty recipe, though the chocolate frosting was a little overpowering.  Wonder what it would taste like with other flavors of pudding...

Oh yuck!  I thought this was a sure winner with all the great reviews, but it was awful.  It could be the pudding I used...I used 6 of the 1 oz. packages of sugar-free pudding and the consistency was so thick when I mixed it...I was hoping it would improve with the addition of the cool whip, but no luck.  It was gloppy.  I used the cinnamon graham crackers and didn't care for the cinn. flavor.  I did let it sit over night, but it was still gloppy the next day.  I have a diff. recipe for this that's more labor intensive, but has a much creamier consistency and I think I'll stick with that.

This was soooo good.  I made 2 pans to bring to work and it was gobbled up in no time.  People were still talking about it the next day.  I took the advice of making it the night before so the crackers had time to soften, and also warmed the frosting to pour over instead of spread.  Perfect!

I was really excited to try this top rated simple dessert. I followed others' advice about the chocolate sauce (which was yummy) but i made it the night before and by the time i served it , it was mushy and nobody wanted to eat it.

I made this last night and it turned out well. I used reduced fat graham crackers and lite cool whip and it tasted just fine. I have had this dessert before, a co-worker's wife would make it for him to bring to work. I layered the crackers and pudding and let it set up for about 1 1/2-2 hours in the fridge before frosting. I warmed the frosting in the microwave on defrost for about 20 sec and it was easy to frost. Milk chocolate is good on this. I would definitely suggest making this the night before-some of the graham crakcers are still crunchy otherwise. The next day, they are softer and it is much better. I will definitly make this again, it is very easy and yummy.

Holy cow, this is good! I can't imagine trying to "frost" it, so I use the chocolate glaze another reviewer posted. Outstanding easy easy dessert. Even better on day 2.

Fabulous!  Soooo easy and soooo good!  My husband requested this dessert again only a week later.  And the tip about popping the frosting in the microwave for 30 seconds was wonderful...it worked great and made it that much easier.  I would definitely recommend!  Also, like some have said, I agree that it tastes better the next day.  Yummy!

Wow! This is one of those recipes that you love to make because it's so easy and people rave about it!  And it was even better the next day!  I did make the chocolate glaze recipe given by one reviewer.  It was good, but I think I would have preferred chocolate frosting. This recipe will be a family favorite!

VERY good and ideal to satisfy a chocolate craving. I used 3 packages of graham crackers because 2 wasn't enough and the pudding mix comes in 3.5oz boxes so I used 2 of those - couldn't find the 3 oz?! I used light cool whip like that made a difference in calories. Ha! It was alittle messy to frost the top graham cracker layer but it's worth it!

I have made this before and everybody LOVES it as well as I!!  It is a favorite in our house.  You can also try Magic Shell for the topping instead of the frosting.  It is very good and creates a nice hard shell on top.

My husband needed a dessert to take to his job for a luncheon they were having. Everyone loved this dessert. I am a stickler for sticking exactly to a recipe but I read this one wrong and picked up chocolate pudding mix instead of the vanilla, It was still excellent.

I loved this dish. I cook for only two, so instead of using the 9x13, I used an 8x8 pan, and it worked out beautifully. I used half a can of milk chocolate frosting and it was delicious. Other reviewers suggested the plainness of this dish; however, I think that that is the beauty of it. It was just sweet enough for my palate and my boyfriend, the chocaholic, was super impressed as well. Can't rave enough about how yum this dish is. Thanks so much!!

HOLY COW, is this awesome!  I made it for an oyster bake, and it went over very very well!  We were able to save some for leftovers, and it tasted just as good!  To make it taste just as heavenly, and not feel "too" guilty for enjoying it, I used 1% milk, Lite Whipped Topping, and Low Fat Graham Crackers, for the first time making the recipe, and as I stated, it was WONDERFUL!  I think I now have a new dessert to bring to parties!!

I made this dessert for a birthday party and it went over great. What a pleasant surprise.  It took no time to make and everyone loved it.  I made it the day before so the graham crackers got soft.  I used chocolate grahams crackers instead of the regular.

It tastes like cheesecake but without all the fat (especially if you prepare this a night in advance which allows the graham crackers to soften up). Its so easy and quick - everyone that tried this loved it! Also, I put the chocolate frosting on the graham crackers before layering them.

I made this for a group of my friends, but I made a fat-free version (skim milk, fat free pudding, cool whip and graham crackers) and used very very little chocolate frosting.  It was DEEEEEELICIOUS!!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious--first dessert to go at a teacher appreciation tea.  I played with it a bit to make it even more decadent.  I used cheesecake flavored pudding AND put a layer of crushed Heath bars in the middle and another layer on top--called it Heath Bar Crunch Eclair Dessert.  As another reader suggested, I warmed up the milk chocolate flavored frosting in the microwave for about 50 seconds and poured it right on top.  Didn't even have to smooth it out.  Refrigerated overnight.  It was just wonderful.

I thought this recipe was heavenly! Also fantastic made with chocolate pudding. I also used the chocolate sauce in place of the canned frosting as other reviewers suggested and feel that is what makes it extra special.

I brought this to a potluck for my husband's work and everyone loved it.  A couple useful tips I received from a friend when making... do it the morning you are going to be serving and the graham crackers soften up a bit.  Also...  ***heat up the chocolate icing in the microwave before spreading it on. I can't imagine spreading it on not heated up... I put it in my microwave for 15-20 seconds on high and then stirred it up in the container before putting in on the dessert.  Anyhow, thanks so much for this wonderful, quick, easy recipe!

HUGE HIT!  I had my reservations that this dessert could really be THAT good but I had to try it given the great reviews.  I made it for a family get-together and EVERYONE absolutely loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly (no variations this time) and it was great!  It is so creamy and yummy that I will certainly make it again!  No leftovers here - the family went back for seconds and thirds!  THANKS!

I have been making this for years..and we still love it...a favorite for pot lucks and picnics.  Best if refrigerated overnight and frost right before serving.  Can also add 1 TBS hot water to frosting to make it thinner to spread like a glaze on top (we like the extra dark chocolate). 
It can easily be made very low fat by substituting skim milk and fat free whipped topping...almost as good (kid's can't tell the difference.

This was good. It really does taste like an eclair. I used Cool Whip Light and Low Fat Cinnamon Graham crackers. It is amazing how this tasted just like an eclair. So simple too! I might just keep all the ingredients on hand for something quick on a weeknight for dessert! Also, definitley keep in the fridge for a few hours to let the graham crackers soften! Tastes the best the day after!!

I made this one for Christmas and my family loved it.  I put the frosting in the microwave for a few seconds to help it spread more easily.  But other than that I follwed it to the tee.  Thanks a bunch.

I am a chocoholic, so I made this a "Triple Chocolate Eclair Dessert."  I used chocolate graham crackers, chocolate pudding, and chocolate frosting (melted for 1 minute in the microwave.)  I let it sit for 24 hours and the texture was great.  This is a great recipe for a potluck.  I took it to a church function and everyone couldn't wait to try it.  My pastor jokingly called it "Sin in a Pan"!   ha ha!

I skipped the middle layer of graham crackers and used french vanilla pudding for a richer flavor.  Very yummy!  I would make this again.

This deserves more than five stars for being easy to make and extremely delicious. We were staying with friends when I made this and everyone loved it. My husband has already asked me to make it again for Father's Day. If you want something good and easy this is for you. Make it, eat it, enjoy it.

My family loved this; I'm not so sure. I love graham crackers, but something about them in this recipe bugged me. You do need the whole box, by the way.

This recipe is the best and so easy.  I made this for Easter and it was a big hit. I melted the frosting as suggested and made one with graham crackers and one with chocolate graham crackers.  Both were excellent.  I also made it a day in advance as suggested.  A keeper!

Can't say enough about this dessert.  I already gave the recipe to 2 other people!  Some suggestions were:  use chocolate graham crackers, chocolate pudding, bananas.  We didn't think it was like an eclair but it was an excellent dessert that I'll make over and over again...nice to not have to turn on the oven!  I used the sugar free pudding, low fat milk and next time will use the low fat grahams.  I was unsure of how this would come out so I hesitated to use them but next time, I will!  I used one 12 oz. tub of the whipped chocolate frosting (although it called for 16 oz.) and it worked out fine...otherwise, it might have been too sweet.  Thanks for the recipe, Kristie!

Simple to put together and absolutely delicious. A little messy though, so I wouldn't recommend this if you are looking for something that "looks" good. Definitely needs 24 hours in the fridge before serving.

Great recipe!  Easy to make.  I also recommend heating frosting in container (without foil top) for 30 seconds and then pouring over the top.  Makes it much easier to spread and makes it have a perfect glaze on top.  I took this to a get together and it was demolished!

This was the easiest dessert I have ever made! There was not a bite left in the dish. I always try to cut down calories and fat when I can, so I used Cool Whip Free, sugar free vanilla pudding, and reduced fat chocolate graham crackers, however, I couldn't find a decent low fat chocolate frosting, so I just used half the container. I also took the advice of a review and melted the frosting in the micro first, which worked great. No one at the party could tell it had lower calories/fat and everyone loved it!

I didn't have boxed pudding mix, so I used the pastry cream recipe on this site and the result was heavenly. I was surprised at how delicious the graham cracker layer was once it softened and melded with the pastry cream and chocolate layers. I will make this again, but will continue to use the pastry cream recipe as it was amazingly rich...made for real eclair taste (but I will double the recipe for that.)

I enjoyed this dessert.  Very easy to prepare and was consumed by 2 growing children.  The only thing I would do different is not to put so many graham crackers.  This is my personal opinion.  It keeps well in the fridge.

This was an awesome recipe.  It's so easy to make and it tastes so great. I'd let it sit for at least a few hours to let the graham crackers soften up.

I just had to review this one again. This dessert is very easy to make and taste delicious. I read more reviews and think I will just stick to they way I make it. It is the best frozen, and my son loves it with the chocolate and french vanilla(i make 2 layers with the puddings ) it gives it such good flavor just like a chocolate eclaire. So thanks again for the great recipe. Sonya

This was really good!  I still prefer the original eclair but this was a great dessert.  Microwaving the frosting really helps the consistency and makes it easier to spread.  It was great the second day.

Made this for a work luncheon. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. Couldn't beleive how easy it was to make. People couldn't beleive it was just graham crackers as the crust. Only draw back is it needs to be refrigerated. Not the best choice for a picnic outting.

Quick & Easy. Last time I used whipped cream  (8oz) instead of waiting for the frozen whipping to defrost & it turned out great! I also microwave the frosting for 35-40 seconds. Best to be made the night before. I uncover it for a few hours to harden the frosting a little like in a real eclair.
A great recipe, everybody loved it. Thank you!

I have made this recipe several times for family events.  I've used both regular graham crackers and the chocolate flavored ones.  Both are equally enjoyed.  This recipe take NO MORE than 10 minutes start to finish.  I also use the french vanilla pudding and the fudge flavored ready-made icing.  ***Spreading the icing is the easiest part!  I stick it in the microwave for 45 seconds and it is a melty glaze consistency that pours right on.  I use a knife to spread the fudge to the edges and it is perfect!  When refrigerated, the icing returns to a beautiful firmer consistency.  It does look more like a glaze (like on real eclairs), but it is not thin and runny.  Personally I don't like the recipe, but I don't really care for chocolate.  My family (and even my mother-in-law and sister-in-law -- a caterer -- who actively dislikes me) enjoy this one.  And it looks so much more difficult than it is!

Very good!  I made it the day before, as others suggested.  Very rich!  Next time I won't use the whole 16 oz. of frosting, and I might use the vanilla rather than white chocolate pudding.  Here's a tip: I frosted the last layer of crackers before I put them on the pudding.  Then I just had to fill in the cracks!

I needed a REALLY CHOCOLATELY dessert for a BBQ with my family and my boyfriend's family. My boyfried's sister in law, Martha says "it ain't dessert if it doesn't have chocolate!" So I revised this recipe as per the commentsâ¦I used white choclate pudding and chocolate graham crackers. I let is sit in the fridge for 2 days in the fridge--the last 6 hours in the freezerâ¦it was FABULOUS. The crackers turned into cake. Martha, the chocolate critic, couldn't get enough of it! Of all the desserts, Famous Lindy's cheesecake, Chocolate chip cake, Chocolate Cakeâ¦this one was the only one touched and was almost gone!! I WILL DEFINITELY make this again for others and for meâ¦YUM!

This is absolutely heavenly! It's light and delicious and really does taste like an eclair. I substituted Hershey chocolate syrup for the chocolate frosting because it was easier to spread. Everyone loved it! I'll definitely make it again.

Turned out perfect the first time and was a huge hit! I followed all of the suggestions from BaysChick (thank you!), including chocolate graham crackers, cheesecake pudding and the chocolate glaze recipe.  I also refrigerated overnight - super important to get a soft, cake-like result instead of crumbling crackers with frosting on them.

Well, it was extremely easy to make, but I can't say I loved it.  My kid liked it more than I did.  Won't make it again.

you really should make this the night before or it won't taste right and allow the graham crackers to become soft. Try using chocolate graham cracker and French Vanilla or Cheesecake pudding! **If you have the time, make this chocolate sauce (It is a dead on ringer for Outback's chocolate sauce.) Mix 1/3 cup cocoa, 1 cup sugar in sauce pan. Add 1 teasp vanilla, 1 stick butter, 1/4 cup milk. Boil for 1 minute, then set aside to cool.  Made June 2018.  Delicious.

Rich and delicious! After reading the reviews, I did microwave the canned frosting for 30 seconds but that's the only change I made. I used Betty Crocker Hershey's Special Dark and it was prefect!  The recipe does call for only two packages of graham crackers, however I had to use three to make the three layers the recipe calls for. Luckily the one box I purchased did contain three packages.  I'll definitely make this again and again!

This is just ok. I wouldn't add the frosting,it makes the dish extremely sweet. Otherwise the dish is ok. Next time I will just make the filling and use it as a dip.

5 stars with a couple changes. If you can find it use French Vanilla Pudding, use regular graham crackers instead of chocolate and for ease use dark chocolate canned frosting microwaved for 30-45 seconds. To kick it up another notch add a cup of smooth peanut butter to the pudding mixture. The peanut butter one is better with chocolate graham crackers but still yummy with regular. Also, no need to butter or spray the pan. And this is a great make ahead because it really is better the next day when the crackers have softened.

These was pretty good but I think I would like this better if it was from scratch, but for a quick dessert it worked out well. It had an instant taste. I can see it softening sooner with a warm pudding. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

Daughter and husband gobbled it up! I made no changes at all. I did everything exactly as it is in the recipe. My hubby liked the canned frosting and said it was way better than the too sweet glaze typically on an eclair. I think I will be making this many many more times and for years to come.

My family loved this. I decided that instead of frosting, I would melt chocolate chips with a bit of oil (microwave thirty seconds, stir and repeat until smooth), and top with a thin layer of that. It was excellent.

This was alright, but not great. I made it thinking that my husband would love it (he loves 'creamy' desserts) but amazingly, it's one that didn't get finished. After a week of it sitting in the fridge, half eaten, it had to be thrown out. 

My husband and I didn't love the use of canned icing. The top layer became quite sticky & thick after being in the fridge for a day or two. Also, the filling mixture REALLY overpowered the graham crackers. It was all just too sweet, too soggy, and too artificial. 

Probably won't make it again.

Too easy! Mine made like 3 layers though and to make things even funner I put frosting on the graham crackers on the layers, my family devoured this! Using low fat whipped topping and skim milk lowers calorie content so it's still full of flavor and no one knows they are eating lighter. Definitely recommend this!

Very good recipe when you want a quick and easy dessert.  My wife heated the frosting in the microwave and it poured right over the top, much easier than trying to spread it with a knife.

I made this for a holiday dinner, but modified it with lowfat grahams, sugar free pudding mix, fat free milk and fat free cool whip.  I made it the night before and let it chill.  It was delicious and tasted quite decadent!  People were surprised and pleased to learn that it was really low fat!

I made this for a small party that I had with adults and kids.  The nice thing about this cake was that it was good for all ages.  That being said, I did feel that the recipe was lacking.  I made the suggested fudge sauce from the outback as I really can't take canned frosting.  Even so, it really needed something.  One person suggested to double up the graham crackers when making the layers another said to add some cream cheese to the filling...then maybe some mini choc chips.  The recipe is simple and fun but I wouldn't make it as is or even with the home made sauce again.

I made this for a party and everyone asked for the recipe.  I did make a few changes.  I used real whipping cream (about 10 oz) and cream cheese pudding.  I made the suggested chocolate sauce, but didn't use it because it came out very grainy.  I made Hershey's Chocolate Frosting recipe (on the can): 1 stick butter, room temp.,1t. vanilla, 2/3 c. hersheys chocolate,3 c. confectioners sugar,  1/3 c. milk.  I added a bit more milk to make it easy to spread.  I only used 1/2 of the frosting.  I saved the other to make grahm cracker "cookies".  Simply spread frosting on grahm crackers.

No doubt a winner, as it disappeared quickly.  This is very simple to put together, and is adaptable to a variety of additions such as sliced bananas or strawberries in between the layers.  The graham crackers seemed to disintegrate into the pudding after sitting overnight, making them nondescript.  Maybe it was the brand I used?  In any event, a very nice pudding-type dessert.  I topped it off with the One Minute Chocolate Icing, also on this site.

If you use the prepared chocolate frosting, then refrigerate the cake an hour before frosting & then het it up in the microwave 10 seconds at a time until you can pour it.  Do not overheat or it will ruin the frosting.

Simple & divine!  This was a huge hit with my family.  To make the icing easier to spread, I emptied the chocolate frosting into a glass bowl, microwaved it for 30 seconds, poured it over the dessert & was able to spread it easily.

I've been making this for many years with the cooked frosting,just recently tried the canned frosting. If you nuke the frosting for 10-15 seconds you can easily pour it over the last layer of graham crackers. I always refrigerate overnight. I use a large Corelle pan a tad larger than 9x13 so it takes almost all of a box of graham crackers and all the frosting. This is a favorite at pot lucks and it's always the first to go.

My mom and I make this just about every year for holiday dinners. It's so good. We don't use chocolate pudding though and ours is usually one layer. Instead of chocolate pudding on top, we use the "magic shell" (a chocolate one)that is usually used as an ice cream topper. Put it in the fridge overnight and you have a great dessert the next day!

My husband loved it. He grew up on the old fashioned pudding pie with graham cracker crust as their families main dessert. I thought it was OK... but nothing to crow about. Maybe will make again in a pinch...

This is so easy to make and very good!  I took other reviewers suggestions and melted my chocolate frosting in the microwave for 45 seconds (other ppl suggested 15, but I just poured it over top and immediately put in fridge).  Delish!  I needed one more package of graham crackers than called for.  Thanks for the great recipe!

OUTSTANDING!!  This was so easy, & a real people pleaser.   The micorwave tip for the frosting is a definite.  Also, you do need 3 sleeves of the crackers.  This is a keeper.

This was very yummy, but I do have to say that everyone was right about the frosting not being right. I think next time I will sprinkle a little hot fudge across the top and that will be perfect.

Awesome quick and easy dessert for a hot night! I recommend letting it sit in the fridge after assembling so that the graham crackers can soften a bit.  It's easier to eat when they are a little soft.  I also added some vanilla extract to the pudding mixture for some additional flavor.

This would have been 5 stars but like many other reviewers I did not like the frosting.  I should have made my own but couldn't resist the ease of using store bought.  Next time I will make my own.  Definitely make this the night before so the crackers can get soft - it's still good if you eat it only after a few hours but it's definitely best after sitting longer.

My daughter's kindergarten teacher made it for their Mother's Day program and I came home instantly to find a recipe.  This is my first time making it haven't tasted the finish products but everything separately tasted awesome.  After the family comes back from dinner we're going to kill it.  It looks so yummy.  I sprinkled graham cracker crumbs over the top, and used both french vanilla/vanilla puddings.  I also followed someone else's directions and melted the icing and poured maybe 1/3 to 1/2 of it.

Yum! This dish is so easy and delicious! Definitly refridgerate for at LEAST 5 hours prior to serving to get the gramcrackers soft! I used my own homemade whipped topping instead of cool whip and i used french vanilla pudding mix, because that is what i has on hand!

I can't say enough about this dessert! It is fabulous! So simple to make and pleasing to all who have eaten it with us:-) I only make it when we are entertaining now so that I can be sure it is eaten up.....my hubby and I have no control if it is in the frig and will devour more than our fair share!! The homemade chocolate sauce another reviewer included is a must. Will make this again and again---thanks!!!

I loved this dessert!!  I used french vanilla pudding and french vanilla whipped topping.  I also made the super easy chocolate topping that BaysChick recommended!  You must try this and make the chocolate yourself!  Everyone at my party loved it and wanted the recipe.

This is a quick and delicious dessert. I've been making it for years, and everybody loves it! The only notes I have to add are.... you'll need almost the whole box (3 pkgs) of graham crackers for nice even layers, and microwave the frosting for about 30 secs, stirring half way through. Other than that, leave it alone and enjoy it!!

I have made this for Card Club  ,everyone loved it. Only change, I use chocolate graham crackers, sugar free pudding mix, and Milk chocolate whipped frosting. I also warm the frosting a little so it is easier to spread.  I like to chill it at least severl hours before serving.

fantastic~!!!  this was a huge hit and everyone requests this dessert for all occassions.  One thing i did was make the bottom layer a graham cracker crust.  I crumbled 2 packages of graham cracker added 1 stick melted butter and firmly pressed to bottom of pan and baked crust for 10 min at 350degrees.  then i added the layers and took the advice to melt the frosting.  Yum yum!  easy delicious everyone will love

I have made this more times than I can count and don't believe I have never rated this.  I am always asked to make this when I go places.  Make it exaclty as written except melt the icing in the microwave and pour ontop of cake.  Can't go wrong with this recipe!

Made this for the first time for about 80 people at church.  They all LOVED it and came back for seconds.  Since I was making it for so many, I made individual servings in bowls and refrigerated them until ready.  Very easy and very yummy.

Good and so easy to make! I really liked the chocolate topping of Bay's Chick found in these reviews. Like other reviewers said, make the night before so the graham crackers have time to soften. Yum!

Excellent! Quick and easy. Keep ingredients on hand if you need to make a crowd pleasing dessert in a pinch.  A helpful hint...put chocolate frosting in the microwave (make sure to remove the protective foil top first) for 30-40 seconds and then simply pour and spread it easily over the top. Makes preparation that much easier. ENJOY!

Yum!  Surprisingly easy to make and sooo delicious.  The chocolate sauce recommended is awesome and pretty easy to make - I agree that frosting would not be nearly as good.  Thanks for sharing this awesome little recipe.

It tasted too artificial and way too sweet for our taste.  It was super easy to make, though.  I won't make this again.

My MIL has been making this recipe for decades and we all love it. She does use a chocolate glaze for the top, but even with the frosting this would still be a solid five-stars. It's one of those recipes that shouldn't taste so good with such simple ingredients. Thanks for sharing.

Love, love, love this dessert. I used to make it all the time when my husband and I were dating, but lost the recipe. I was so excited to find it on this site! Letting this sit in the fridge BEFORE frosting it is important. I let mine sit for at least a half hour before frosting. I try to prepare mine at least a day before serving, as it tastes better and better over time. Really does taste like an eclair! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I have made this dessert a few times now and everytime its been a huge hit! Everyone is always asking for the recipe. I make homemade chocolate frosting instead of prepared store bought, but whatever is easiest for you! Homemade frosting seams lighter and easier to manage (atleast that's my opinion). Delicious!! Thanks for sharing!

The key to this recipe is to melt the icing prior to putting it on the dish. It pours on nice and smoothly and when it sets it is a fudgy-like consistency. Also the longer in the refrigerator- the better!

I just made this...haven't tasted it yet, so only gave it 4 stars....but it looks like a winner.   I used french vanilla pudding, I dipped the graham crackers in a bowl of milk....just to get wet, and did melt the frosting in the micro-wave like other's had suggested.   The only thing I did notice was I had to use THREE packages of graham crackers to make 3 layers.  I only had 2 crackers left, so I don't see how you can do this with just 2 packages unless you don't completly cover the dessert with the crackers.  I'll find out tonight after my son's poker buddies eat it as to if it's a thumb up or down : )

Love this. We use fat-free cool whip and sugar free/fat free vanilla pudding, plus low-fat graham crackers... this way, it's a 3 point dessert on Weight Watchers and still tastes great!

A huge hit at the Easter party I brought it to. They practically licked the pan! I used BaysChick's chocolate sauce recipe instead of canned frosting. I also used skim milk, low-fat graham crackers, and light whipped topping. Delicious.

I made this for my son's 14th birthday. It was definitely a HIT! I made it the day of the party and followed the others suggestions of dipping the graham crackers in milk and it was perfect. My daughter just asked me if I could put more than 5 stars. It was soooooo good she said.
(06/17/12)I made this again for Father's Day and prepared it the day ahead. Did not use store bought frosting but the chocolate sauce "BaysChick" suggested. It made the whole dessert!!!! Rave reviews from everyone

YUM! Just make sure you use a container that will fit your grahams evenly and is deep enough for 3 layers...mine overflowed a little but it was still DELISH!

i tried this recipe yesterday and ate it this morning... and it was ok.  i followed the recipe exactly the way it was written.  and the ingredients i bought were the good, expensive name brand.  but its just ok.  nothing special.  i was wishing to have a fantastic dessert with all the raving reviews.  so i got my hopes up and now im very disappointed!  oh well...what was i expecting from putting a couple ingredients together...

Microwave the frosting for 30 seconds (or until runny), pour over your dessert as a final layer, and let sit in the fridge at least 2 hours.  This is the best and easiest way to frost this, and it tastes wonderful.  Everyone loves this dessert, and it literally takes 15 minutes to make.

Easy and wonderful dessert! Only thing I did different, was I used 3 sleeves of Graham crackers so it covered the entire pan without leaving gaps. I used a can of pilsbury chocolate frosting and heated it up for about 40 seconds so it just poured out of the container to make the glaze. My family loved this and my 14month kept asking for more! We've had these many times at potlucks and family gatherings but I had never actually made it. Thanks for the recipe. I can't wait to try variations like others users have with chocolate graham crackers, french vanilla and cheesecake pudding. Recipe is great as written though!

This was the first recipe I tried on allrecipes.com. I can honestly say this is one of my favorites. Make sure to make this dessert in advance because if it doesn't chill, the graham crackers stay crunchy, and it doesn't taste as good.

I made this for my husbands birthday party last year and have had requests from everyone to make it. It is so yummy. I have added sliced bananas between the layers for another added flavor. This is a keeper!

Delightful.  I'm only giving it four stars because I've been using the homemade chocolate sauce suggested by reviewers ("Mix 1/3 cup cocoa, 1 cup sugar in sauce pan. Add 1 teasp vanilla, 1 stick butter, 1/4 cup milk. Boil for 1 minute, then set aside to cool.")  I made it once the night before, once the morning we were going to eat it...both times the graham crackers were delicious.  Doesn't seem like the whipped topping really has to be thawed, by the way.  Leftovers will last several days (provided you don't eat them first!)  This is a simple yet delicious recipe.  It's been a big hit and I plan to continue making it for gatherings!  Thank you!

This a very easy and quick recipe. However, in my books I don't really consider it to be home-made. But when you make it everyone will RAVE about it and your dish will always come home EMPTY! I took the advise of other users and used french vanilla pudding and I used the chocolate sauce recipe from Bayschick. THE CHOCOLATE SAUCE IS A MUST, it really makes the dessert. Chocolate Sauce Recipe: originally submitted by BaysChick (Thanks so much!): Mix 1/3 cup cocoa, 1 cup sugar in sauce pan. Add 1 teasp vanilla, 1 stick butter, 1/4 cup milk. Boil for 1 minute, then set aside to cool. I GAVE THE RECIPE A 5 STAR BECAUSE EVERYONE LOVES THE DESSERT! THANKS FOR SHARING THE RECIPE.

This recipe came together so quickly and so easily. I used the recommendation of Bays Chick and made the chocolate frosting recipe that she included in her review. I liked how this can be made in advance.

My mom used to make this for me when I was young, now I make it for my family each Christmas and on other special occasions.  I brought this to the in-laws' this year and they all loved it.  I don't mess with making my own chocolate sauce, I just use cake frosting and warm it up in the microwave before putting it on the dessert - it spreads easy that way.

I loved this recipe. I put everything into individual dishes, and I ended up icing the graham cracker before I put it on top of the last layer of pudding (otherwise it was difficult). I'd definitely make this again. :)

I thought this eclair was great! I have made it a couple of times now and everybody loves it! For the pudding I use french vanilla and extra creamy cool whip. Thanks for a quick and delicious dessert!

I made this for Christmas Day, everyone loved it only for the icing don't use frosting. Baker's chocolate has a microwave chocolate icing that hardens and taste great and best resembles Ã©clair icing. Turned out great just spread thin or it is a little too hard and will make a mess when trying to cut it.

This is excellent and easy for a crowd.  I made 3 of these for a church function.  Made one sugar free for the diabetics and dieters and it was just as good.  I followed the frosting given in the most popular review but had trouble (I was using an electric skillet vs. burner).  The sugar made the frosting too grainy so I started over and used powdered sugar.  Success!  Nice, smooth frosting and better tasting than canned frosting.  Next time, I think I may try it with chocolate graham crackers.

Super easy. I've been wanting to make this for a while. My eldest helped me put this together. Fun recipe and it's one that disappears quickly. I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site in place of the frosting. Fun!

EDITED TO ADD 11/01/08: My family loved this recipe. I'd make this again and again. I'd like to try it with another frosting on top and with chocolate or cinnamon graham crackers and either chocolate or cheesecake pudding. I bet that'd be even better!

This is a very good recipe. I used Whipping Cream instead of cool whip. This recipe serves more then you would expect. I'm in a family of 6, and we can usually clean up a 13 x 9 inch pan. But this recipe is rich enough that we only ate half of that!

I don't understand the "eclair" part of this dessert.  Maybe if it had another name I might like it better, but probably not.  The simple flavors were just that, simple.  Like another reviewer said, it just tasted like graham crackers and vanilla pudding.  Not that special.  I had a variation of this that combined one package of vanilla pudding and one package of coconut pudding, and it just didn't quite work, either.  This might be a fun recipe to do with my kids, because it is so easy, but definitely not something I would serve to guests.

Made this with the homemade chocolate sauce suggestion.  The sauce was good but too fudge-like for my gang.  Next time I'll try the prepackaged frosting.  Tasted more like a melted ice cream sandwhich or a smores bar than a chocolate eclair but still overall a great dish.

This was a definite hit at my grandmothers 94th birthday luncheon. I can't believe how easy it was to prepare and how good it was. I used the chocolate sauce recipe recommended by a few reviewers, and it made such a nice foil over the top layer of graham crackers. The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because the presentation is kinda sloppy (AND, I thought it was too sweet, but I am not at all a dessert person). Thanks for this, I'll definitely make it again for future parties.

I made this in a 9x9 inch pan, with one package of pudding and I used a melted chocolate mixture for the toping. It was really good. Next time I will put more layers of graham crackers and use banana pudding and banana slices. A twist on the banana creme pie my Grandma used to make with Nilla wafers. It tasts like a giant smore with the vanilla pudding! Yummm.

So easy and so good!  Far from gourmet, but yummy all the same if you are fond of this type of dessert.  I've made it 3 times over the past few years and we like it best with french vanilla pudding and dark chocolate frosting.  The dark chocolate just tastes better with the pudding mixture for some reason, I actually didn't like it when I used regular chocolate frosting.  My only suggestions that are not in the recipe are to warm up the frosting a bit in the microwave so you can pour and spread it easier, and let it cool completely in the fridge uncovered, then cover it.  This way condensation won't form on the top of the cake.

I made this for friends I had over and everyone loved it!  Very easy to make and very quick also.  There were no leftovers.  I only had graham cracker crumbs so I added some sugar and melted butter and baked the crust for 5-8 min. then let it cool before adding pudding and added a sprinkled layer of crumbs and sugar on top then added the frosting and it was still wonderful.  This is a keeper!!!!

Boil for 1 minute, then set aside to cool. I pour chocolate sauce on top.

Very simple to make and again you should wait the 24 hours.  Also make sure to lop the pudding over ends of crackers.  I added an extra layer of graham crackers in the middle and we all thought it was too much.  Kids asked if I could put melted chocolate on the bottom layer too!

My husband's new favorite dessert and the easiest and biggest hit yet.  I entertain quite a bit and my friends think I am the dessert maker.  I made this recipe over the summer and now it;s the only one they request.  To spread the chocolate frosting...just heat the container in the microwave for one minute and it will be pourable.  The frosting will firm up nicely in the refrigerator over night.

I thought this turned out with a wonderful flavor.  The only problem I had was spreading the icing over the dessert.  It did not want to spread well.

At my church we make this up in quantity and serve it to the men at the local shelter. They just love it, as does my family. It disappears quickly at potlucks, too! I use fat-free sugar-free pudding and lite Cool Whip, and it's just as good; people don't believe I used "light" ingredients!  Definitely a winner!

I don't think there was anything special with this recipe. Maybe it would've tasted differently if it was one of the first things I had eaten rather one of the last. I crushed the graham crackers with my hands. I made the chocolate frosting recipe submitted by Bayschick (arrange by most helpful). My advice is to double the frosting recipe. I also forgot to put the whipped frosting in with the vanilla pudding mix. So, I just had people put a scoop of it onto their pieces. My friends liked it a lot.

This was really very good, especially for as easy as it was.  Definitely make it in advance so the flavors can all "smoosh" together.

ATTENTION GILPNH:  This would definitely be OK to make a couple of days in advance.  I have on many occassion and feel it's a dessert that gets better and better the longer it sits (within reason, of course).  Enjoy!!

Excellent!  Lasts well in the fridge (we have a small family).  I used less than 1/2 can of chocolate frosting and found that to be sufficient.  I also used 1 large and 1 small box of pudding, fat free half and half, and 1% milk.  My 9 X 13 dish took more almost a full box of graham crackers.  Sliced well, easy to serve.

This was pretty good!  My parents were over this weekend so I served this for dessert and everyone really liked it.  I have liked some other pudding and chocolate recipes a little bit better but this still yummy.  I liked that it was easy and quick to make.  I did end up using almost a whole box of graham crackers.  Thanks for the recipe.

I used almost an entire box of graham crackers. I HIGHLY recommend letting this dessert "rest" for 2 or 3 days before eating...if you have the willpower!

This is definitely quick to throw together and it's a hit with my guests.  Whenever I eat it though, I think the chocolate layer is a little on the sweet side.  Perhaps with home-made frosting where the sweetness could be better controlled, it would be 5 stars for me.  If you microwave the frosting container for 30-60 seconds, it will pour easily over the dessert.

I've been making this recipe for nearly 30 years since I first found it in a church cookbook.  It is always a hit.  As I've gotten older, I've started using sugar free pudding and Cool Whip.  Also buy frosting already made and warm in the microwave so I can drizzle a little lighter on the top.  The original recipe says it must be refrigerated at least 12 hours before serving so the graham crackers "mush" up in the pudding and it has a richer taste.

This is a great recipe!  Even my husband, who is not a dessert eater, said it was really good!  To make icing the top easier I iced each graham cracker before I laid it on top.  Then I heated the icing for a few seconds in the microwave and connected the already iced graham crackers with more icing.  Enjoy!

My husband was looking for a dessert recipe he could make for my birthday and I found this one.  It was easy for him to make and it tasted better than I thought it would.  Very simple ingredients, but WOW! it's really really good.  After having SECONDS on this dessert, I made him take it to work the next day so I didn't devour in for breakfast the next morning.  As for the frosting, he just frosted the top layer of graham crackers before placing them on the cake and then smoothed them out.  We ate the dessert about 3 hours after making it and it was great!  Can I give it 6 stars???

Really good!  My husband's family raved about it.  I think the chocolate icing might have been a little too rich for the rest of the dessert.  It definitely needs the chocolate, and I don't know what an appropriate solution would be.

this is my all time favorite "go to dessert".  you can throw this together and have a fabulous dessert for any occasion. I use one french vanilla and one banana pudding- i've also added 1/2 a bick of cream cheese to the pudding mixture and it gives it great taste and texture. thanks for a great recipe.

Just made this tonight for a dinner party and it was AWESOME!  Everyone raved about it and couldn't stop eating it.  I used a whole box of graham crackers (3 sleeves) and microwaving the frosting turned out perfect.  Other than that I didn't change a thing.  I know this will become a regular!

Great Dessert. I used 2 larger boxes and less milk only because I didn't pay attention to what size boxes I had! It still turned out awesome. Instead of using frosting I mixed some homemade chocolate syrup and melted chocolate chips and spread on the top. I layered vanilla wafer cookies on the bottom with the graham crackers. I think next time I will use only the vanilla wafers and see what I get. Will make again and again. Thanx for the post!!

Wow! This is fantastic. I'm a little late reviewing but oh well. ;) I made this for V-Day and it worked out fabulously! Make it the night before, fridge it for at least 8 hours so the graham crackers get soft (like prev. stated). I too used the french vanilla cool whip and pudding mix. Also, use the chocolate sauce recipe given by the other viewer - it's super tasty. I spread a thin layer of it on the bottom of the pan. My honey had 2 BIG pieces after a huge dinner! Yummy!!

I needed a great dessert for a bridal shower and this was a hit!  I made it in individual clear plastic cups and covered them with plastic wrap and pink tissue paper wrapped with a ribbon.  They got rave reviews and many requests for the recipe.  One recipe made 10 cups.

Delicious and easy. In stead of using two packages of vanilla pudding, I substituted one banana, it was great. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe gets 5 stars.  The only change I made was to whip up a pint of heavy cream instead of using frozen whipped topping.  I also made my own chocolate glaze.  Make this a day in advance, it is worth it!

I'd give this dessert 6 stars if I could!  Very easy and delicious.  I found it tasted better the next day, so that the graham crackers got nice and soft.  Microwaving the icing was definately a great tip.

This dessert was fantastic! It was incredibly simple to make and my entire family raved. I used low fat graham crakers, low fat whipped topping, regular french vanilla pudding and a tub of whipped chocolate frosting. As many previously suggested, I microwaved the frosting for 20 seconds to make it easy to spread and I also made it in the morning and served it after dinner to allow the crackers to soften.  It was perfect!  I'm making this again next month for a girls' night dinner party and, in addition to the low fat stuff I already used, I'm also going to try sugar-free pudding and maybe a sugar free chocolate topping.

Outstanding!  Everyone loved this!  Insanely easy and quick to make...I almost felt guilty accepting so many compliments on a recipe I worked so little to prepare.  Like some other reviewers suggested, I used cinnamon grahams, and french vanilla pudding mix.  Used 1% milk and lite Cool Whip. Threw it together in a 10x10 pan mid-morning and served that evening.  Excellent!!

5 stars from everyone!!!  My boys are begging me to make this again.  Super easy and very tasty.  I did in 13x9 pan, but needed a full box of grahms (3 sleeves).  Used the Fr. Van. pudding and also liked the idea of putting frosting in microwave till pourable.  It firms up nicely in the fridge.  This recipe is a keeper....Thank You!!

Very easy to make and everyone loved it.  I took some of the other sugguestions and used French Vanilla pudding and also put the chocolate frosting on the middle layer of graham crackers.  I don't think I will do this next time because I ran short of frosting for the top and had to get extra. I also softened the frosting in the microwave to make it easier to spread.  I will make this recipe again. Thanks!

This was great! I suggest you frost the graham crackers before you lay them on top of the dessert, then fill in the spaces between the crackers with more frosting. This makes it much easier to frost.

by following the simple reccomendations of others, this is a real winner!  The advice I followed was to use french vanilla flavored pudding and whipped topping, and to prepare the day before.  I also decided on cinnamon graham crackers - delicious!  And finally, the homemadae chocolate sauce is a must.  The dessert was easy enough for my toddler to help make and was a well-recieved at his birthday party.  I will continue to keep this recipe handy!

Easy and Wonderful!  There are a few reviewes that say this isn't a 'Wow' type of dessert and I completely disagree.  My dinner guests loved it and my family enjoyed the leftovers the next day.  I made it 8 hours prior to serving and the crust was nice and soft.  I also took others advice and used french vanilla pudding, Pillsbury chocolate fudge frosting and light whip cream.

This dessert is delicious!  My whole family loved it, they all went back for seconds.   The only thing I will change next time is to get a different chocolate frosting - I used a milk chocolate cake frosting, and it was a little too sweet (but still yummy!).

EXCELLENT RECIPE!! Been using this one for years. The ONLY thing I change is to use French Vanilla pudding instead of plain vanilla. Makes it richer tasting.

I made this for Canadian Thanksgiving & it was awesome. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed it.I used 3 pkgs of lemon pudding & increased milk accordingly. It was a nice combination with the chocolate. Will definitely make again & have already given the recipe to a friend that was at our dinner.

This was wonderful!  I also suggest that youmake this dessert 4-6 hours before you need to eat it so that the graham crackers have time to soften.

A HUGE hit in this family!  For me, it was not as rich as a chocolate eclair (a good thing!!) and had great flavor.  I didn't make any changes and will definitely make this again.

This is easy, but nothing special. Tastes like instant and packaged ingredients. If you REALLY want a dessert that tastes like an eclair try the recipe from this site called "Cream Puff Cake" by Nancy. A bit more work, but the raves are well worth it!

I love this recipe! I make it for all the potlucks and everyone always asks for the recipe. I have made a few modifications--for a REALLY chocolatey dessert, substitute choc pudding for the vanilla. I also like to melt the frosting, pour it over, and put it in the freezer until it sets...it seeps down and hardens and tastes wonderful! I also use skim milk and low-fat whipped topping and it still tastes great.

This is really easy!  I like the idea others suggested of chocolate sauce over frosting, but why make your own???  I used a bottle of Smuckers Chocolate Fudge Sauce ( Ice Cream Topping).  I popped it in the microwave for a bout 30 sec. and it was just perfect!!  I also used white choc. instant pudding mix and made my own whipped cream with heavy cream, sugar,almond and vanilla extracts!  AMAZINGLY EASY & SOOOOO GOOD!!!  This took me 20 minutes, tops!

I made this for a bachelorette party, and the bride said "It's so good the back of my mouth is tingling!"  I used french vanilla and cheesecake flavored pudding mix w/ skim milk and light cool whip, and I used the pourable chocolate frosting.  It was to die for!

I made this for an office party and it was a huge hit. I used one pkg cream cheese pudding and one package of french vanilla. Definitely needs to be made the night before so the graham crackers get soft.  I also used skim milk for the pudding. It tasted like Boston Cream pie.  Everyone liked it.

this was the easiest and best tasting thing i have made in a long time!  i found that microwaving the frosting for 30 seconds made it much easier to "spread" over the graham crackers.  i have made with both plain graham crackers and cinnamon graham crackers and they are to die for.

So good. So easy.  I also made the chocolate sauce by Bayschick (spelling?) that was suggested by a previous post.  The chocolate sauce tastes like Outback Steakhouse's chocolate sauce.  It was a great compliment to this dessert.  I will definitely make it again.  It was way too easy, too!

Very delicious.  I took another reviewer's advice and used cheesecake flavor pudding and chocolate graham crackers.  Also, I didn't use frosting.  There was another review with a chocolate sauce recipe.  Very good, and didn't overpower the whole flavor.  I will definately make again.

This is excellent and so easy. I do find that I use three instead of two individual packages of graham crackers, though.   I like it best the second day, when the graham crackers have softened up, so I make it the night before.  The most difficult thing about that is keeping my husband out of it.

Sooooo yummy and easy! I took fellow raters suggestion and mixed the pudding w/ cool whip and am soo glad I did....I think it would have been way too sweet otherwise w/ the chocalate topping. It was very yummy the fist day but even better the preceding days. So good (and easy) I made a second batch for the guys at work and was definantly a crowd pleaser!

This was very good, but, like another reviewer said, I thought the canned chocolate frosting overpowered the other flavors (I used Duncan Hines Classic Chocolate). Next time I'll try the chocolate sauce the reviewer suggested. I would definitely give this 5 stars for being easy to prepare!

Considering the minimal effort it takes to prepare it, this is VERY tasty - kids and adults alike only had great things to say between mouthfuls! I used Duncan Hines dark chocolate frosting and it worked well. (The filling it sweet enough - so you don't need a super sweet frosting.) Also, I made it a day ahead of time and that seemed to help the ingredients fuse together really well.

Really good recipe, easy too.  I would have liked better with ho'made chocolate frosting instead of the Betty Crocker canned milk chocolate frosting I used.  But no one else at the potluck complained.  They were still raving about it the next day.

My husband, who does not eat leftovers, (of any kind)  finished the entire 9 X 13 pan of this himself.  Each time he had some he declared "it's even better now".  I have to agree - I helped him finish it on day three and it was the best yet!  I have to make this on a monthly basis.  The only thing I added was a dollop of whipped cream to each slice.

This was great to make, and the family loved it.  Next time I will use cream cheese in place of the whip topping, just to give it more body.  It went fast!

I decided to make this recipe for a family reunion this weekend. Made it last night....couldn't resist tasting it this morning. It is AWESOME, I'm positive will be a big hit at the reunion.  I used 3 packages of graham crackers tho, and I put it in the freezer, so we'll see how it turns out? Otherwise, followed the recipe the rest of the way through.  Putting frosting in the microwave was a great idea, thanks to you who posted that hint. Thanks for the recipe, it is mighty tasty AND a KEEPER!!
****************************
Family reunion over...I came home with an empty pan!! Definitely a hit, and I"M glad I had my piece BEFORE I took it, otherwise by the time I got through the line my dessert was gone!! By the time we traveled to our destination, dessert was thawed and perfect. So this is a real good make ahead to take dessert to a pot luck.

The frosting TOTALLY overpowered everything.  I suggest drizzling the frosting lightly and only using the graham crackers on the bottom so that you can taste the pudding.  Otherwise it's more of a "s'mores" dessert rather than an eclair dessert.  Also, it was VERY rich...again because of the frosting.

My 8-year-old made this (with a little help) and it received, literally, rave reviews from company. It was delicious, simple, and surprisingly, not overpoweringly sweet. We can't wait to make it again! (Incidentally, we used skim milk and low-fat whipped topping, and nobody was the wiser.) Thank you so much for sharing this!

YUMMY!!!!!!  I made this for a funeral this past week and it was a hit. My husband, who is not particularly fond of desserts, went back for 3rds and has requested that I keep the recipe close at hand.  Several people asked for the recipe; though I must say, as easy as it was, I was almost embarrassed to give it out. I did microwave the frosting for 45 seconds and poured it on, I can't imagine spreading it.  My grocery store was also out of plain chocolate frosting, so I used chocolate almond and it turned out wonderfully.  Will definately be making again!

I cannot believe how easy and delicious this was!!  I melted the frosting which made it much easier.  Also, I used the Rich & Creamy cool whip.  Wanted to use the french vanilla pudding, but the store didn't have it so I stuck with plain vanilla.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Four girls ruined their diets over this dessert!  Very tasty and so easy to make.  Definitely let the dessert sit overnight and use the chocolate graham crackers and french vanilla pudding as previously suggested.

quick and easy.  Not tons of flavor - maybe use a different flavor of pudding (ex. cheesecake), but very well received.

This gets five stars for it's simplicity and for the number of compliments it gets me every time.  It tastes just like an eclair, although it works better if you can make it the night before.  If it's not refrigerated long enough before you serve it, the graham crackers might still be a little crunchy.  And we all know that eclairs are not crunchy.  I always get requests for this recipe.  VERY YUMMY!

Oh My!!!!  This recipe is great.  I found it yesterday afternoon and made it last night for the potluck today.  It's so easy, and everyone at the potluck just loved it.  Like another reviewer, I was asked if I'd used banana pudding, but no -- I used French Vanilla.  One guy said he wanted the recipe so he could have at his birthday -- A SUCCESS!

My family begs me to make this all the time. I took it to a potluck, and my dh overheard some women talking about how delicious this dish was:)
The funny thing is that I make it exactly like the recipe calls for, but everyone thinks it has banana pudding in it.

YUM! Big hit with family and co-workers!  I added a second layer of crackers to the bottom because I like it to have a bit of a crunch to it.  The top layer was soft and the bottom a little crunchy after 8 hours. I also substituted cinnamon crackers to the top layer only so it gave it just a hint and didn't overwhelm.  It is definitely staying in our favorites list!

Absolutely wonderful!  I made this for a cookout and it was the talk of the day.  Everyone wanted to know the recipe.  The cream is so smooth and fluffy that it tastes just like eclair cream.  I took the advice of others and melted the frosting before spreading.  I did use more graham crackers than called for though, almost all three packages of crackers in the box.  This will be on the dessert table at more functions to come!

This recipe is quick, easy and FANTASTIC.  I recently had a family birthday party and wanted to make 2 cakes, so this was my choice for the second one. It was actually more of a hit than the regular birthday cake! I tried it another time using cinnamon graham crackers, but I wouldnt recommend doing that.. it wasnt so good. Oh, and i melted the frosting too, it went on so easily.  This is possibly the best-tasting dessert Ive ever had.

Deeeeeelicious! Served it on family vacation and everyone loved it.  I followed several reviews and used french vanilla pudding, added 1/2 a block of cream cheese, microwaved the icing to pour and made a day in advance....perfect! Try the Pillsbury Chocolate Fudge icing....Mmmmm!!!

This was 5 stars for how easy it was and tasted great as well. I made my own whipped cream instead of the cool whip and instead of chocolate frosting I topped it with sliced bananas and choclate sprinkles. Maybe not the chocolate eclair but still very tasty and light!

This was quick and easy to make.  My mom was already asking me to make it another time after her first bite.  I only let it chill for about 5 hours before serving and the graham crackers had softened enough.

Tried this dessert last night.  Excellent, and way easy to make.  Definately do the tips suggested, waiting to serve, and microwave the frosting.  Only suggestion is to make a homemade chocolate buttercream frosting.  The store bought frosting wasn't that  great, when cold and hard.  Thanks for the quick, yummy recipe.

This is so remarkably easy and tastes so fantastic, I was overwhelmed. Delicious...tastes like you fussed for hours. Great for pot lucks. I used the suggestion of melting the frosting (I think the chocolate fudge frosting is best) in the microwave for a minute to melt it so you can pour it over the last layer of graham crackers. I think thisis a must as I doubt it would be very simple to spread the frosting. Best recipe I have tried in a long, long time. Thanks!

I'm not good at making desserts and rarely eat them. This was made for guests.  It is a very easy recipe.  I made it a day ahead as recommended by others.  One guest, familiar with this dessert said she preferred crisper graham crackers - personal preference.  It is very rich.

Excellent and quick recipe!!  I made this to bribe 2 buff male friends to move a new treadmill into my basement and it worked like a charm!  They raved about it and ate it up!  

I did follow one reviewers suggestion of microwaving the frosting - excellent idea!  I wouldn't have had the patience to do it otherwise.  I microwaved on High for 30 seconds and it was perfect for pouring over the graham crackers.  Make sure you use a sharp knife to cut thru the crackers!

Very easy to make and very good but it is really rich!  I made my own homemade chocolate frosting because I don't care for canned.  Like others, the frosting and the pudding wanted to blend a little so it's hard to hide the pudding under the frosting.  Next time, I would either let the pudding set a little first, or thin out the frosting a little bit so it smoothes on easier.

This was great!  Tasted so good and was so easy to do!  I do suggest, as others, though to put it together ahead of time, at least the morning of, better yet the day before, in order to let the ghram crackers soften up.  I definatley will make this again.

This recipe is the best!  Made it the first time for the kids, but the adults ate most of it!  It's best to make the morning you plan on serving, helps the graham crackers soften.  Everyone loves it, and so easy to make!!

This was absolutely fabulous...  very rich and creamy!  I LOOOOOOOVED it!  It was so easy to make, too. We just finished it, and I'm already planning when to make it again.  I did find that two packages of graham crackers were not enough...  I didn't have enough for the top layer, and then the pudding mixture got a little blended with the frosting.  Next time, I will make sure to have extra graham crackers on hand. Thanks for an awesome recipe, Kristie!

This would be good if you're in a bind and need something quick, or just as a simple family dessert.  Not suitable for the grand finale to a dinner party, though, as I recently discovered.

Fast, easy and deliciously rich!!  Everybody will beg for the recipe!  Excellent hint: microwave the frosting a little otherwise it is too difficult to spread.

I always make this the day before I intend to serve it so that the graham crackers can soften (like vanilla wafers in banana pudding).  Kudos to the ladies who found out that the frosting needs to be softened.  The recipe I use actually states to stir milk into the frosting.  The next time I make it, I'll just nuke it as you did.  I haven't made it in a couple of years; I think it's about time. Thanks.

This is unbelievably easy and DEEElicious!  Everyone raved about it and thought is must be a complicated recipe!  It's one of the easiest I've ever tried.  Hubby loves eclairs and said he liked this dessert even better!  So glad I found this one!  Thanks Kristie.

This is sooooo yummy!  It's also so easy to make.  I made it 3 hours before serving and put it in the fridge and the graham crackers softened just right.  I got comments that it tastes just like an eclair.

I should have read the recipe more carefully, I crushed the grahm crackers instead of putting them in whole, so I wasn't all that impressed, it was very mushy. So don't make the same mistake I did!

A wonderful and yummy recipe, so easy to make and everyone is amazed at the simplicity. Definitely heat the frosting and pour over top layer of graham crackers in order to spread more easily.

How easy!  Very good, nice presentation, and very quick to make.  I tok the suggestions and warmed the frosting in the mircowave a bit before spreading on the top.

The only one who didn't like it, even though she likes all the individual items,was my 8 year old - she didn't like it all put together.  The other 12 people enjoyed it!

I made this recipe for a party and had to leave early, so I haven't even tried it yet!   It got rave reviews, and I have been asked to make it again for Mother's Day.  Evidently, it was a hit!  I can't wait to eat it myself now.

Absolutely Delicious!  Very easy to make and a hit with my husband and guests.  I will definitely make this again. Next time I'm going to try the lower fat version...fat free pudding, lite cool-whip and fat free frosting.

Everone raved about this dessert.  I used Lady fingers instead of graham crackers.

This recipe was not as great as I was expecting but it was still okay.  It was easy to make except a little mushy and the graham crackers kept sliding around when I was trying to top with the icing.(should have heated it up a bit)  My kids were not thrilled with it, but it was still a really quick and easy dessert that I might try again for unexpected company.

So yummy and so quick.  Everyone in my family loved it!   I made the next night for my husbands fellowship meeting at church and the dish came home CLEAN--not just empty, but like someone actually licked it (I hope not).  And since I know that my husband does not wash the dish before he brings it home, that only leaves the earlier option.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.  We now have a new favorite dessert.

I made this recipe for a welcome home from the hospital gathering at my house.  What a basic good dessert, you can also make a diabetic form with sugar free pudding and just a drizzle of chocolate.  Thanks So Much!!

This recipe is fantastic! I wanted to do something different with dinner yesterday & found this. I'm SO glad I did! One small error on my part- I didn't have enough graham crackers to do the top layer, so I improvised with teddy grahams. Well...they worked!  This was a HUGE success and is one I will be making for all my get togethers. Thank you!!!

This is one of the best and easiest desserts I've ever made!  I served it for Christmas and it was gone within minutes.  I used french vanilla pudding and chocolate fudge frosting.  It tastes exactly like a chocolate eclair - WONDERFUL!

This was SO tasty! I took it to Thanksgiving dinner at my aunt's and I ended up having to hide it so I'd have some leftover to take home and eat later! I frosted the top graham crackers before putting them in the pan and I tried the trick where you melt the remaining frosting and pour it into the cracks - it made it look sloppy because it didn't dry the same color as the other frosting. Anyway, the recipe was AWESOME! *****
I'll be making this again and again...

I made this with the 'chocolate glaze' instead of the redi-made frosting.  It was v. rich and got better as it warmed up to room temperature.  The glaze was sort of hard when it was cold.

I made this dessert for a dinner party recently. I was a big hit. I also used chocolate graham crackers and white chocolate pudding. It came out great. I agree with the other reviewer that microwaving the frosting for 1 minute is a good idea.

Excellent!  I used French vanilla pudding, fat-free cool whip, low-fat generic graham crackers, and a low-fat off-brand chocolate fudge icing.  As someone suggested, I iced the graham crackers first, then put them on top.  That used up about 1/3 to 1/2 of the can of icing.  Then I put the remaining icing in the microwave, zapped it for 25 seconds, stirred, and poured it over the areas that needed to be filled it.  I smoothed the icing around, and it turned out perfectly.

Well, everyone else seemed to really like this desert, but it wasn't as good as I expected.  I'd make it again for a get-together, but not my first choice.  Maybe it's just me...

I made a Low Fat version of this recipe for my Labor Day Party and it was EXCELLENT!  I used Cinnamon reduced fat Graham Crakers, used skim milk in the Jello, fat free whipped topping and reduced fat frosting. Everyone loved it.  I also prepared it the day before which made it a very easy dessert to prepare.

I had this dish at work.  I had never heard of anything like this before.  I loved it and had to make one myself. Thank you for such a sweet and tempting new recipe idea.  I will take it to the next function I go to!

This is so cool and refreshing.  I did add a layer of bananas, which made it even better.  When I make it again though, I will make the middle layer of graham cracker double.  That would make a better cakey type layer in the middle which would be great.  It was gone in one nite!!

This is a keeper! My husband loved it and ate a gigantic piece each time. I used chocolate graham crackers and needed slightly more than 2 packages. I only had one vanilla pudding mix, so I used 1 package of SF white chocolate. I used some softened chocolate fudge frosting on top because it is our favorite. Yummy!
I needed some space in the frig before we finished it, so I stuck it in the freezer. It was there about 2 hours and we liked it even better.

I use all low cal ingredients (reduced fat graham crackers, Free Cool whip, 1% milk, and low fat pudding) (except icing) and it was great. My 14 year-old daughter loved helping out everyone loved it. Really does taste like an eclair!

I've been making this recipe for 40 years. It's that good. I've never had it not completely gone wherever I bring it. I had forgotten about it and needed to bring something to church--yep, it was gone again! Follow the recipe exactly and for those of  you who are having trouble with the pudding part--use COLD milk and INSTANT pudding. Kids love to make this too! Now for my family's favorite "tweak"-- after the first two courses of graham crackers, put some sliced bananas before putting on the pudding layer. Use banana pudding instead. Use a deep pan so you can add 1C peanut butter to the canned frosting and heat it in the microwave with the frosting--then stir. Put that on the frosting layer. Top with some chopped pecans. DELISH.

If you want it rich, use whole milk,  real vanilla pudding (Not sugar free), regular Cool Whip,  grahams that aren't low fat, and choc fudge frosting.  I made it the night before our lunch that was the next day and there was none left at the end of lunch! For the girls making a light  dessert, I used low fat milk,  sugar free vanilla pudding , light cool whip and reduced fat graham crackers.  I used the same choc fudge  frosting though to add some richness. It was still wonderful and a bit lighter in taste though.  
So easy to make and everyone will love it.  It serves a lot but there's never any left to take home!

OMGOSH! If you have not made this recipe yet, you truly need to! Itâs ridiculously delicious. I donât use frosting for the top though. There is a recipe in one of the reviews to make your own chocolate sauce that blows the mind of all who have it. LOL  Iâve made this for many different occasions (Super Bowl, potlucks, baby showers, just because) and every time I make it, theyâre screaming for more.

I made this using the chocolate sauce mentioned in several other posts.  I used dark chocolate cocoa instead of regular and it helped cut down on some of the sweetness.  Everyone really loved it.  My 2 college kids loved it.  They watched me make it and now they have a simple dessert to throw together when they have parties with friends.

I made it exactly as shown. It truly was a quick and easy dessert to make. Good crowd pleaser. I do recommend letting it sit overnight to soften the Graham crackers.

quick and easy recipe. i made this 14 hours ahead, chilled in the fridge and by eating time, it was soggy. if I were to do this again i would do the day of the even, chill, then freeze for two hours. warming the cake frosting was genius, but don't use too much or else the whole dish is too sweet.

The only reason for 4 stars is because of the chocolate frosting.  I did not use this but made my own chocolate ganache and it turned out great.  1 cup heavy cream & 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate.

This was delicious! I didn't have time to make my own scratch frosting but it honestly didn't matter . An excellent recipe that didn't require an oven on a hot day. Added to my quick, easy and delicious dessert go-to recipes.

Wonderful dessert! So easy too. Made day ahead and followed other reviewersâ recommendations. Used chocolate grahams, cheesecake pudding, and made my own chocolate sauce -easy and so worth it. Prepare sauce first so it can cool while assembling crackers and pudding. Next time will make gluten free. A keeper recipe that will be my go-to. Thank you!

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE! DO NOT USE STORE-BOUGHT FROSTING!!

This recipe has been a family tradition for years and years. It is TOO DELICIOUS of a dessert to ruin it with store-bought frosting!

This quick and easy chocolate topping recipe tastes exactly like you would find on a chocolate eclair!

1-1/2 cups powdered sugar
3 tbsp butter
3 tbsp milk
2 tsp clear corn syrup
1 tsp vanilla
2 oz. unsweetened chocolate (4 squares of the Bakerâs chocolate)

Melt everything on low/medium heat and then stir in the powdered sugar. Pour on top! You will not regret taking the extra few minutes to use this recipe!

Also, this dessert only needs to be refrigerated overnight!

I put the frosting in the microwave for 30 seconds and then poured it over the dessert.  Per other reviewers, I let this dish set overnight before trying it.  It still seemed to me too much like a bowl of soft graham crackers with vanilla pudding.

This was very easy to put together which I did while letting Chef John's Best Lasagna sauce simmer. Followed directions exactly and took another reviewer's suggestion of nuking the chocolate frosting. It set up great. While it was tasty, too rich for me. I thought of all kinds of variations... for choc freaks, could use choc grahams, choc pudding and Cool Whip... could even go with banana cream pudding with banana slices, coconut, etc.

I needed something easy and quick for a church social and made this   Absolutely everyone loved it and asked who made it. The men especially stood around it and cleaned out the entire pan and I have strict instructions to bring this to every event from now on. I didnât use the canned frosting instead I used the one reviewers recipe using butter sugar and 1/3 cup of cocoa powder and brought it to a boil and let it cool then added vanilla and spread it on top. It was more like a real eclair glaze.  This one is so easy, quick and definitively a keeper!

I made this using the Graham crackers, Cheesecake flavored pudding, low fat whipped cream,  Lactaid milk (2%), and chocolate icing.  The only other change I wish I'd made was to make the chocolate sauce mentioned by other reviewers.  because the cake icing does make this very rich.  Too rich for my personal taste.   My husband loved it and it was very easy to make, so it still gets 5 stars from me!

Followed ingredients as directed. To get a thin layer of icing, I did as other reviewers and melted the can icing to pour a thinner layer on top.  Great recipe, quick and easy. My family destroyed this in minutes.

I just made this dish and so far the filling is yummy. I am now waiting for the 2 ours to taste it. I substituted the frosting for candy chocolate for  a hard topping so I will have to see how that turns out. *fingers crossed* If not, I will have to go back to the frosting.

I have made this dessert many times since I found this recipe. It's always a big hit and there are never any leftovers. I am not a fan of cake frosting so I  make a chocolate ganache and pour it evenly over the top  before chilling overnight.

It was a hit! I followed the recipe exactly but made the chocolate topping using the recipe posted in the top reviews of the recipe instead of frosting. I let it chill for 24 hrs and it was perfect! Will be a staple for me when making dessert for a crowd... super easy, cheap, and delicious!

My 12 year old son made it for his Big scouts event.  it turned out pretty amazing.  when we kept it in the fridge,  we used aluminum foil.  do not use that.  it gives a metallic taste in case the foil touches the frosting which is unappetising. 
My son also used lemon frosting for the second batch instead if chocolate,  for those who do t like chocolate.  the lemon one turned out better than chocolate I must say.  even though I am a chocolate fan hands down.  
Good starting recipe for kids.

Good recipe. I only did two layers of graham crackers because I didn't have enough. I found this turned out in my favor as another layer on top would have been too much graham cracker for my taste (I love eclair).  I also made my own whipped cream for added sweetness and creamy consistency. I followed other reviewers suggestions with the chocolate topping.

Iâve been making it for a few years and itâs always a favorite.  I follow the mixture recipe but use the chocolate sauce recipe, itâs definitely worth it.  I also make it the day before to allow the graham crackers to soften.                              **If you have the time, make this chocolate sauce originally submitted by Bayschick (It is a dead on ringer for Outback's chocolate sauce.) Mix 1/3 cup cocoa, 1 cup sugar in sauce pan. Add 1 teasp vanilla, 1 stick butter, 1/4 cup milk. Boil for 1 minute, then set aside to cool.

I made this  for a Thanksgiving  dinner at our community center.    Needless to say, there was none left and then my family wanted me to make another one later that day. The first one, I used the canned frosting idea,  it was good, but I think the cocoa frosting from one of the reviews is much better.  This is now the go to recipe for any place that requires me to bring a dessert.  It's super easy to make and doesn't cost very much, yet it taste like a very expensive dessert.

This is a fabulous dessert! My family gobbled it down. The consensus, however was that the chocolate made it  too sweet . I used duncan Hines classic chocolate. I will try the chocolate sauce recipe by Bays chick next time. I personally could go without the chocolate all together.

This just gets better as it sits in the fridge so it's good for when you have to make something the night before you need it.  I have had the frosting just straight from the container and also microwaved and poured over...Both ways are good.   I used French vanilla pudding the last time and needed a few additional crackers for my pan size once but as long as you use the general idea you can't mess this up.  It will taste different depending on your brands and whether you use fat free or sugar free etc. But the basic idea is solid.

It was ok but very, very rich. I might try again with more whipped topping to maybe cut the sweetness some. But it did get eaten !!

Simple, delicious dessert! No this is not gonna win any all-natural, homemade awards, but who cares!? Sometimes you just need something like this. I made this the night before and that was perfect. The family loved it~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I do not wanna be the joykiller since most ppl gave this 5 stars! Mine turned out soupy and mushy. The pudding mixed was not set after 18 hours. 3cups of milk? Really? Cold? Hot? I d give it a try one more time if someone give me tips. Thanks

I followed the recipe. I also took advice from other users and microwaved the icing (25 seconds and gave a good stir) which worked very well.  Make sure to put in fridge for a couple of hours so it will set up.  Quick, easy, economical and tasty.

An icing spatula is very useful in creating this dish.

Consider this a yummy potluck or family favorite.  It is not gourmet cooking.

The dessert wasn't creamy enough because there wasn't enough milk. The flavor is good though and I used chocolate Ganache instead.

I've been making this for years the key is to make it ahead and leave it sit in the fridge overnight. That softens the crackers. Everyone loves it. I have made it both with canned frosting and the homemade frosting depending upon the time frame. Always a hit!

This dessert is so easy and delicious, and there are so many ways you can change it up; use a different flavor pudding or use two different puddings for the two layers.  I particularly liked butterscotch for one layer and French vanilla for the other.  Be really bold and try pistachio pudding. Homemade  ganache instead of the chocolate frosting works really well. Use chocolate or cinnamon grahams. What about adding some cream cheese to the pudding mix?  Or add one cup of peanut butter. You almost cannot mess this up. Great at potlucks or office parties, but be prepared to hand out recipes!

I made my own whipped cream and added a very small amount of cocoa powder. (1 -2 tsp)   It added just a little hint more chocolate flavor.

This recipe goes back 30-40 years. I completely forgot about it! We refrigerate it 48 hours and if you can find instant French vanilla pudding, it's even better.
Easy, yummy, and feeds a bunch.

This has always been a family favorite!  I use a jar of hot fudge sauce instead of frosting.  Melt the sauce in the microwave and pour over the top for easy spreading.

It was awesome. It tastes like a decadent, expensive dessert. I did follow what one of the comments said about microwaving the frosting and that made it pour right over it smoothly. I also used French Vanilla pudding. Very yummy and very easy to make.

11.16.16 ~ Today is my husband's birthday and he loves Chocolate Eclair Cake.  I made two cakes for him to take to work and share.  He said both cakes were gone within 15 minutes.  I would say they were a hit!  I did put the container of frosting in the microwave for a little bit to make it pour easily rather than trying to spread it.   Put the pan in the fridge and the frosting set up nice and smooth.

Tastes just like an eclair! My grandma used to make this and I forgot about it until recently. I made it for Thanksgiving and it was a hit! I forgot how good it was! It is VERY VERY important to heat up the icing in the microwave before you spread it on top. I don't see how others have "iced" the top the regular way. Plus the texture of the chocolate frosting is completely different when you heat it up, more like the traditional eclair glaze. Did I mention how freaking easy it is to make ahead? Enjoy!

I made this exact and microwaved the frosting and poured it on top. This is a great recipe to keep in your back pocket. I did let it sit almost overnight. This recipe only gets better with each day that passes. Definitely tastes like an Ã©clair. Very good! Will make again, super easy!

I made this for my boyfriend for Thanksgiving for a little bit of home for him. Best dessert ever! It tastes just like an eclair donut. I thought the graham crackers would get super soggy, but they never did even days later. I'll be making this again.

I've made this dessert many times. I love the simplicity of it, not to mention, the taste. If we're not having company, I cut the recipe, in half, and make it, in an 8 X 8 dish. That's plenty for two of us, over a couple of days.

This recipe is even better the second day.  I made the frosting recipe that BaysChick recommended but unfortunately  it was too sweet for my taste and the taste buds of my company.  I will make that frosting again but decrease the amount of sugar and go from there.

I made it just as written and took the advise of putting the frosting in the microwave before adding it!  It was delicious and my company loved it!  I will make this again!

My Mom used to make it and I have made it many times.  Absolutely love it.  We make our own choc frosting for it but the canned is easier if you are in a rush.

This is a huge hit. I made this years ago, but forgot about it till I saw it on the site. I've made it with both chocolate and vanilla pudding , both delicious. I melt the frosting in microwave and pour it over the top and only use about a third of the container. It must sit overnight, and if there is any left over it gets better everyday. This is a great simple recipe.

It was good! One of the biggest problems I had was that it didn't last long. Which isn't always a bad problem to have. Super easy to put together too. I complicated the recipe slightly by using a Cook&Serve pudding mix instead of Instant. I think it tastes better.

I used the Bays Chick chocolate sauce recipe. Don't forget to thaw the cool whip ahead of time.  Don't use foil to cover it, it will stick to the frosting; I had to use a  cooking torch to release it. Good recipe for a quick dessert, but not everyone is a fan of cool whip otherwise would be 5 stars.

Boy was this FABULOUS!!

Made this recipe but used 1 pack of cheesecake pudding and 1 pack of french vanilla pudding. Also, highly recommend using BaysChick recipe for chocolate topping:

**If you have the time, make this chocolate sauce (It is a dead on ringer for Outback's chocolate sauce.) Mix 1/3 cup cocoa, 1 cup sugar in sauce pan. Add 1 teasp vanilla, 1 stick butter, 1/4 cup milk. Boil for 1 minute, then set aside to cool.

Brought it to a BBQ. There were many desserts, but everyone commented on this. When I saw the host the next day, he said he had another piece before he went to bed and again for breakfast.

Great recipe. So good I made a batch of the filling to use for another dessert too. I made the cool whip mixture and refrigerated it. I then used it between thin layers of a boxed golden butter cake with a chocolate ganache over the top.

I made this for family and friends and they LOVED it.  I used French Vanilla Pudding and the real cream Cool Whip.  Also, because I despise canned frosting in any form, I  made a simple ganache with Ghirardelli semi-sweet chips and heavy cream which gave it sort of an "upgraded" flavor.

Very easy to assemble and make. I added another layer in along with some sliced almonds. It added a little crunch. Definitely definitely make your own frosting like some of the other reviewers said. Simple to make but well worth it.

The only thing I  do is microwave the frosting for 1 minute so it looks like chocolate syrup.  Very easy to spend and will harden like the chocolate on eclairs. Otherwise it's harder to spread.

I microwaved a container of milk chocolate frosting for 30 seconds and poured it over the top and put it in the fridge.
Easier than spreading frosting.
Everyone loved it!

Since I don't like to wait for 24 hours and to make this truly decadent and a bit like tiramisu, I dip the graham crackers in coffee with added coffee liqueur and add a bit of coffee liqueur also to the pudding mixture!   I agree with others that the ganache on top is a must (not canned frosting).

My kids loved it!!!
I used Honey Maid Graham crackers (honey), cool whip and cheesecake flavored pudding mix. For the chocolate sauce:  mix 1/3 cup cocoa, 3/4 cup sugar (more if you like it sweet) in sauce pan. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1 stick butter, 1/4 cup milk. Let boil then set aside to cool. I used a smaller dish (7x10) so I got 3 layers.

Made again with a few minor changes it will imitate an eclair in a simple icebox cake recipe. Make with French vanilla pudding, and club crackers. The club crackers will soften to imitate a flaky crust. Then microwave the chocolate frosting for approx 30 seconds to pour and spread. NOW, it will taste like an eclair!

This  recipe was truly a hit. I used heavy cream instead of the whipping cream and I divided the mixture in half. To one half I added cocoa and the other half I left it the way it is. I will definitely make it again!!!

I made this to take to a potluck - it was a hit.  I made the chocolate sauce recommended by BaysChick.  I think that improved it as I don't like super sweet, which I think the frosting would've produced.  I will definitely make this again.  My words of advice are to prop up the plastic covering when you are chilling the dish - mine got horribly stuck to the chocolate glaze and was quite a mess to remove.  I can only hope that toothpicks will stand up.  I used French vanilla pudding mix.  I'd like to try using chocolate graham crackers even though it tastes great as is.

I've made this at least a dozen times or more using the chocolate sauce recipe by BaysChick. I always make it the day before I need it and it always comes out perfect. I've tried it with different pudding  flavors, but the French vanilla is my favorite. My friends call it "Mud Cake" and it is one of my most requested desserts. I almost feel guilty because it is so incredibly easy to make! I have also doubled the recipe for a large church social and it still came out perfect.

This recipe is AMAZING!!!! You have to make sure to follow the recipe exactly. Also, use really wip cream and homemade chocolate icing! Finally, u may need a few more graham crackers so buy 3 packs. Thank you for this terrific recipe. I'll definitely make it again soon. W

Made this for the second time but cut recipe in half.  Used Banana cream pudding mix instead.  Felt it gave it a little more flavour.  This is quick and easy, used a chocolate sauce recipe for the frosting .......works great!

I made this as is and it tasted pretty good.  I made it 3 days in advance  of the dinner party I had.  The only real issue was that the graham crust did become very soft by the time I served it.  It was very easy to make and took no more than 10 min.  I microwaved my frosting for about 30 seconds and it was easy to spread.  I just poured it on and used an offset spatula to spread it over the top layer.  The only change I would make is to maybe add more vanilla flavoring to the pudding mix.  It seemed a little bland.  Be careful with covering.  I used aluminum foil and it stuck to the frosting and ripped a portion of the frosting off the cake!

This is just as  you'd imagine.  pudding with graham crackers softened by being covered in pudding.  I'd rather have pudding and fresh graham crackers.

I have been making this for years and everyone loves it.  When other desserts are left this one is always finished off.  I melt the can of frosting for about 30 seconds in the microwave and stir a little (not too hot or too much stirring or it forms bubbles).  Start at 20 seconds and keep adding 5 or 10 seconds until you can pour it like a liquid.  Pour the can of frosting over the graham crackers and it is perfectly smooth.  One can will cover a 9x13 dish.  You might want to pickup a second can for your first try because you may have trouble completely covering with one can until you get the hang of it.

I made this. Very easy, very quick. Quite tasty. Doesn't taste 100% like an eclair but it's still delicious. Used Chocolate Graham Crackers, Sugar Free Fat Free Pudding, Fat Free Cool Whip, and melted some chocolate chips as icing.

I made this recipe because I love chocolate eclairs! It didn't quite taste like the eclairs I usually have.  This just tasted like something else.  My guests still enjoyed it but I will be looking for another chocolate eclair recipe.

I love this recipe because it is very quick and easy. The only change I made was I used sugar free pudding, sugar free cool whip and sugar free frosting to cut some calories plus my husband is diabetic. Also I refrigerated it for longer than 2 hours. It tastes much better if you wait until the graham crackers get very soft.  Tastes just as good as the full sugar version. The kiddos never knew any different!

Just made this for a party and love it! The pudding mixed with whipped topping seriously taste like eclair filling. It is such a simple, quick easy recipe and it looks so pretty in the pan. I do agree that you must melt the frosting in the microwave for 1 minute prior to frosting it. It pours nice and easy.

So great! This is a huge hit in our house, sometimes we use the chocolate grahams and even put some banana slices inside. This recipe has endless possibilities and can be thrown together quickly. I am a diabetic and I've used sugar free pudding and skim milk and it is still wonderful!

Very easy and quick to prepare! I snuck a few bites after 2 1/2 hours and it tasted awesome! I used more graham crackers than it said to line the pan, and also melted a can of frosting to put on top.  It set up perfectly! It would be fun to try different pudding flavors and even a different frosting flavor for the top! Yum!

I make this for church camp and other dinners. It is a BIG hit w/ youth and adults. Instead of the chocolate icing, we use chocolate cool whip or make our own w/ cool whip and chocolate pudding. The cool whip topping is much lighter than the frosting. We also use french vanilla pudding with whole milk.

delicious and so easy to make!  my whole family loved this!!  (although, not sure it really tastes like a choc Ã©clair...like another review said, it tastes like what it is - pudding with graham crackers and chocolate...but who wouldn't love that?!:)  I will definitely make again.

Just made this recipe for Labor Day and it was a hit! I mixed one package of vanilla pudding with one package of French vanilla pudding, YUM! Then I made my own chocolate frosting (Coa Coa, butter, sugar, vanilla, and milk) and it was delicious! Will definitely make this again, thank you!

So easy!  I did use the chocolate sauce recipe given by one of the reviewers, but the rest was according to the recipe.  Huge hit with the family!

I have made this as suggested with the can frosting (melted). It was delicious, however the chocolate was over powering and after chilled the frosting was harder than the graham and pudding and would squish when cutting. A soft chocolate glaze would work much better or maybe only using half a can of frosting. I'm definitely making this again though, very yummy!

I have made this several times and if you make this 24 - 48 hours before hand it turns out perfectly.  You have to let the graham crackers moisten and become soft for the best flavor. Remember it is supposed to taste like eclairs, hence the name. If you dig right in as the negative commenter stated it tastes just like the ingredients.  To make this a very low sugar way, I use sugar free jello (make sure the lumps are out this takes a bit longer with the sugar free type), skim or low fat milk, I use 2%, sugar free cool whip and sugar free frosting.  You have to figure at the most you are getting two and 1/2 whole graham crackers, with a regular serving size, which are less than 5 sugars plus the sugars in whichever milk you are using.  Please do not think this is fat free, just sugar free which is what I have to watch out for.  My husband loves with full sugar or without.

So far, so good!  1st time making it and it's in the fridge cooling.  Looks very yummy according to my son!  We do not like frozen cool-whip so I made homemade whipped cream, it worked out just fine?

Someone mentioned the spreadability of the frosting. To make it easy, just warm the frosting in the microwave until it is pourable, and then pour it over the dessert.  Just be careful not to overheat.  This dessert is a FAVORITE at my house!!

There are a couple recipes that are identical for this eclair, so I want to post on all.  This is wonderful.  I thought it was good, but my friends absolutely raved.  I made just as recipe calls, don't change a thing!

I have been making this dessert for many years.  Instead if graham crackers I use Club crackers.  The crackers get soft like cake and the bit of salt that are on them enhances the flavors.  Also, don't use regular vanilla pudding, use French vanilla.  This gives it more of an eclair taste.

This dessert was super easy, and equally as amazing.  I did make a change, and I would highly recommend other people do this as well...I crushed the graham crackers and used a whole box.  Some people commented that their graham crackers didn't get soft.  If you crush them, and use the whole box, you won't have that problem.  I also heated my chocolate frosting in the microwave for 1 minute, and then poured it on.  The people I made it for raved about it.  I'll definitely be making this again!

It was very delicious. I made it with homemade whipped cream. (1 cup of heavy whipping cream, 1 tablespoon of vanilla and 1 tablespoon of powdered sugar) and to make the chocolate frosting easier to spread I fluffed it up with the mixer and added a premade chocolate pudding cup to it! Family loved it.

I loved this recipe. I love chocolate eclairs and was quite happy with the flavor. I agreed with other reviewer, it is so quick and easy and if you love chocolate eclairs you will love this. Do make sure to soften chocolate frosting in the microwave for about 20 seconds or long enough to soften. As for Kayla's mom, you must have used bad ingredients or your taste buds were off. Think about this, why would you be the only one who did not like it.

Ooohhhh, this takes me back to Portillo's in Chicago, where I always skipped a meal in favor of this dessert.  Whenever my husband's workplace has a meal he makes this, and it wins him lots of friends.  Make it in a disposable pan, because chances are you will not see your dish again...I am the voice of experience!

I loved this!  I followed everything except I used French Vanilla pudding and used Rediwhip (real cream) in lieu of the type made with vegetable oil.  I let the graham crackers sit for about 10 minutes and they stayed in place to easily frost.

I enjoyed this quick to make dessert. We did make a few changes and did half sugar free vanilla pudding mix and half banana. I also sliced some bananas and added those into the pudding layers. I also added some vanilla extract into the pudding to make it taste more natural. Overall, not bad for such a quick dessert.

The cream was DELICIOUS. I made the chocolate syrup suggested by the most helpful comment and it was a little bit too sweet for my liking. Next time I will reduce the sugar on it and maybe even use one sugar free pudding packet and one regular to cut the sugar content way down.

Made the first time with chocolate graham crackers for a family reunion potluck and used Bayschick choc sauce and it was great; not even a smidgen leftover.  Yummy!  Easy too!

OUT OF THIS WORLD.   I do add 3 TSP of milk to the canned frosting for easier spreading though.

Everytime I make this it is a hit. Once I made it "inside out" as I only had chocolate pudding & vanilla frosting, it was still a hit! Thanks so much for a great & easy recipe

This has to be my favorite dessert! SO many ways to add variety to it! Love it with layers of chocolate and lemon pudding, also with layers of chocolate grahams and cinnamon grahams. And ALWAYS with Bayschick's chocolate topping!!!! Stick a few fresh strawberries or cherries on top. Can't go wrong with this!

This was a very good easy dessert. I found the frosting on top was hard to spread, I should have warmed it a little first. Next time I may try a chocolate pudding topping with whipped cream =)

I make this all of the time with french vanilla pudding and 4 cups of milk.  I don't use frozen whipped cream.  Other than that, it is the same.  I love this dessert and it is a favorite with my family.

This is awesome, another variation on it is to put cherry pie filling on the top instead of the frosting.  I like to use white chocolate pudding.  So very tasty

I used two 5.9 oz boxes of pudding instead, but it was a big hit for our 4th of July get together. Even the "picky" people liked it. It's very easy to make too.

This is a terrific dessert.  Super rich.  I would add less chocolate - Can you imagine?!!  But, for me, the amount of chocolate made it a little too much.  I've also thought that next time, I may add sliced bananas for an easy banana pudding.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Definitely a classic recipe.  I don't melt the frosting or anything, just frost right out of the can on top of the graham crackers.  Definitely prepare it the day before, because those grahams need to soak up all of that pudding/cool whip goodness!!

OMG!!! I made this exactly as the recipe reads for mother's day and it was a big hit.  I made it for a family reunion and it was a huge hit there as well!!! I would suggest to anyone making this to not change a thing as it is perfection as it is.  I love a short and sweet recipe and this certainly fits the bill and then some.  I will be keeping the ingredients for this on hand at all times.  Thank you so much for this delicous and easy recipe.

Love this recipe and have been making it for years. The frosting can also be thinned with warm water added a little at a time and stirred with after each addition until you get a drizzle consistency....Yummy!

I have made this a few times now with rave reviews each time. This is a very simple dish and one that we've enjoyed. I've read a lot of what others have said, especially the negative ones, and honestly, you can tell what you're going to get by the ingredients alone. It tastes good and is easy on the budget. I didn't find it to be overly sweet and I did end up using 3 packages of graham crachers. I also used one large box of vanilla pudding and one small. For the frosting I used whipped chocolate frosting and after letting the dessert sit in the fridge for about an hour or so to set, I frosted with no problem. I'm going to next try it with banana pudding and fresh bananas to see how that turns out...can't wait!

The best and easiest dessert you'll ever make! be sure to make the night before. even better if you use french vanilla pudding and french vanilla cool whip. Microwave icing for 45 seconds and poor on.

I made this the other night and sent half of it to my Husband's work.  They raved about it (not that a whole bunch of guys are hard to please).  I kept half at home and am trying my best to ration my portions so I don't consume so many calories.  It is pretty good, and the best part is it is easy to make!  The only problem I had is I used 3 whole packages of graham crackers and still ran out before I was finished with the top layer.  You definitely need 3 for the size dish that you are supposed to use.  I got it worked out though and will defnitely be making again when I need to bring a dish to a party.  Also, I used 2 boxes of white chocolate pudding.  It was awesome...I might try another flavor next time to see how that turns out.

I really enjoy this dessert.  It's super easy and quite tasty so beginners like me can shine :)  I made my own chocolate frosting that one of the reviewers submitted.  Also, I sprinkled quite a bit of cinnamon in the pudding/whipped cream and loved how it turned out!

My Mom made this dessert for years. It was always a favorite. The original was called French vanilla dessert. You used a 9x13 dish and almost  a whole box of graham crackers, french vanilla pudding as package directs and the cool whip. Her recipe called for milk chocolate canned frosting. You make the dessert the night before, refrigerate and spread the frosting on the next morning when dessert is set. It spreads easy.  Linny

Fantastic! I needed a quick recipe the night before a gathering and scrambled to put something together. Little did I know this would be the hit of the party. I made three layers instead of two and it worked out well because the filling is very sweet. My husband has been begging me to make t again! This will be a party must!

Not that good. If I was rating this for a kids dessert, I'd give it a 5 star rating, because it's super easy (kids can help) and there are so few ingredients and cost effective. However, for an adult dessert, I'd only give 2 stars. Not one of my adult guests cared for it, including myself. I followed recipe but did use the chocolate glaze recipe submitted by several reviewers (and I thought it was still too sweet).       I made it the night before (but did glaze the day of) so the grahams were softened enough. It's appeal is the ease and quickness. Again, great for kids, will make again for my kids when they have friends over, etc. But definitely a NO GO for grown ups.

I made this recipe for a luncheon at work. Everyone LOVED it! There are 2 things that you MUST follow in the recipe. The first is that you REALLY need to microwave the canned frosting. This makes it like a chocolate ganache glaze and is fabulous. The second thing is you MUST refrigerate it overnight. This helps set the pudding and gives the graham crackers time to soften. An absolutely delicious, simple and tasty dessert.

My boyfriend loved this. As soon as he took the first bite, he said, " touchdown babe ". His brother is asking that I make it for the next family get-together. Every piece was eaten. Thanks for a great & simple recipe.

OM!!!  So incredibly easy to make.  I did change it up a bit for a favor of fall and added a hint of pumpkin pie spice to the pudding mixture.  After I let it set for a couple of hours in refrig I microwaved the frosting for 45 sec to soften and made much easier to spread.  Family ate 1/2 of pan last night.  Again, very easy!

This recipe is GREAT! I made it for the first time tonight, it was a hit w/ my boyfriend & our friends! I will definitely be making it again soon! I suggest making it the night before & using the chocolate sauce another reviewer left (the Outback one).. I don't think frosting would be as good. Also I used French Vanilla pudding which made it even better!

People go crazy for this dessert!!! It's so easy and so good!!  Definitely best to microwave the frosting for 30-45 seconds and then just pour it on like a glaze.  In my opinion, it's best not to use the whole can of frosting either; it's too much.

Extremely sweet but delicious and I will definitely try it again. Planning to add dark chocolate frosting next time, or maybe look for less sweet whipped topping.

My son had this at a family party and told me to get the recipe.  My sister sent it to me from Allrecipes.com.  This was so easy, kids love it and even my husband who rarely eats dessert, finished his serving.  I followed the recipe, no changes....very tasty.

I made this today....excellent.  I used chocolate graham crackers, and sugar free white chocolate pudding.  I also used Cool Whip free.  Makes it more diabetic friendly.  I microwaved the Chocolate Fudge frosting for 30 seconds.  Makes a very nice topping for the simple tasty dessert.

This is the easiest dessert in the world!  And the most delicious.  I get rave reviews every time I make it and it really is done in 15 minutes.  Since the ingredients are pantry type, I keep them on hand and make this when I know I need an extra dessert or just have too much else to do.  I brought it to a friend's house recently and a pastry chef asked me for the recipe!!  Definitely make it a day ahead.  It needs time to soften.

Four stars for ease of preparation and for needing ingredients that are almost always on hand. It's not a gourmet dessert by any means, but a fun, easy sweet treat to make on a summer night. Didn't really taste like eclairs in my opinion but satisfied the craving for something cool and creamy. Next time I probably won't use the store-bought frosting - it just tastes too artificial. Making a quick chocolate ganache would make this taste better.

Made this for the fourth of July. Made it exactly as listed, used a larger can of icing that I nuked for 30 seconds.  Made it 24 hours in advance in a glass dish.  Everyone loved it. Something really different. But did use three packages of crackers. I didnt overlap, just fit them together.

This is really more of a Boston Creme Pie but it tastes yummy, is quick and simple, and got rave reviews at a party. The only thing I would note is that as other reviewers have mentioned, you need to microwave the chocolate frosting in order to pour it on.

So easy to make! Instead of canned frosting I made a chocolate ganache that I found on here. I think canned frosting would've made it too sugary. I also used cinnamon graham crackers instead of regular, since it was all I had. I gotta admit that I was worried about just mixing instant pudding mix with whipped cream, but I was pleasantly surprised. I do recommend letting the completed dessert sit for a little bit until the crackers get softer, as another reviewer mentioned. I also recommend picking a good chocolate topping for this, because I noticed that it really can make or break the recipe. But overall, it's a good recipe!

This was way to easy to tase so good! I had the entire dish put together in about 10 minutes, then it was in the fridge for the night. Today when I served it, it was wonderful.  The Chocolate sauce further down is fantastic and add so much to this dessert. It's worth the extra 5 minutes to put it together.  Thanks for posting this one!

This recipe was good and very easy, but just wasn't as great as expected...as recommended by others(of course my opinion) If you're looking for a quick dessert to whip up or maybe just looking for something to make w/ ingredients most have on hand--then this would be a recipe to try

This was okay, I guess, but the canned frosting is really bad...make your own chocolate sauce topping or forget this recipe. Also, note to self, cinnamon graham crackers-not good in this recipe...

We just love this recipe, it's so easy and yummy. Only thing I do different is to use French Vanilla pudding, which adds a stronger vanilla flavor. I would recommend people try it.

This is a great dessert.  It is best if you make it a day ahead so that the graham crackers can soften. I used chocolate mint pudding with dark chocolate frosting..  OMG!  Delish!!

This dessert is amazing. I love desserts that appear to be difficult but are secretly so easy!  I took this dessert to a going away party for a friend, and there were a plethora of other desserts, and everyone wanted this one, and then raved over it.  I made the chocolate sauce from scratch (as recommended by other reviewers) instead of store bought which I find way too sweet.   I've made it several times, and I much prefer it after it has sat overnight instead of just a few hours.  It is easier to serve and tastier when the graham crackers are soft. Great recipe!

Wow wow wow. It was devine! How can something so easy taste so good? I followed the recipe exactly, except made a homemade choc sauce mentioned in another review. Planning to keep all ingredients on hand for the future.

I actually stumbled on this one by accident, but I'm SO glad I did-it was WONDERFUL! I am a very busy mom of 4, but one of my favorite hobbies is discovering kitchen approved (ours of course) recipes that we love so that I can insert it in the cookbooks I am working on for them! This recipe has already been requested to be added! Thanks so much for a quick, cheap and easy recipe that will now become one of our family favorites!

Very good! I made the chocolate topping myself based on some of the other reviews and liked it better than from a can. I also sprinkled graham cracker crumbs on the top.

Went looking for an easy, tasty Thanksgiving dessert, and stumbled upon this.  Entire family is now asking that I bring this dessert to all holiday functions in the future. It's that good.  Do it.  And make your own chocolate sauce for the topping.

I used coconut shortbread cookies for the graham crackers and that worked out pretty well!  I think I'll buy more coconut cookies the next time I make this.  I might use coconut pudding next time too.

Always a hit.  I use 12 ounces of whipped topping instead of 8 ounces.  Use the homemade fudge topping that a reviewer posted.  Great stuff!

My family loves this recipe.  I highly suggest letting it sit for several hours in the refrigerator.  That way the crackers get soft.  French Vanilla pudding has a great taste with the graham crackers.  Thank you for the recipe.

I had tasted this desert twice before at work pot-lucks. Decided to make it myself and was quite disappointed. I used the cinnimon sugar graham crackers and it totally changes the taste. I really prefer the dessert as my friend makes it--low calorie or light everything. I will make adjustments next time.

Awesome!  I, like many of the other reviewers, have been making this for years. Kids like it, adults LOVE it! Be sure to microwave the chocolate frosting for less than a minute so it is easy to pour it over top (I only use half the tub).  I have also made this in a pretty glass bowl with graham cracker crumbs (like "dirt" dessert). Let it sit overnight for the best, soft texture.  Enjoy!

This dessert was good, but I'm only giving it 3 stars because it uses all premade ingredients (pudding mix and frosting).  I did use the recipe on this site for the chocolate sauce which was fantastic!  I may try this again, but I would make my pudding from scratch for a less artificial flavour.  If you're short for time and have guests coming over though, this is easy to whip together and people will think it took you more effort than it actually does!

This was just so-so for me. Maybe it was the quality of ingredients that I used. I used a generic pudding and that's probably why the taste was off. Next time I will choose better ingredients.

Yummy!  I have been making this for years and now one of my girlfriends is getting the credit bringing it to parties. I was so glad someone suggested microwaving the frosting as it would be impossible to spread hard. NO CHANGES NEEDED. It tastes like it takes more effort and it is so easy! The crackers need to get soft. Tastes even better 2 days later!

LOVE this dessert.  I needed almost 3 packs of graham crackers.  I microwaved the frosting for 15 seconds to get it to a more spreadable consistency.  Also, I did let this sit for 24 hours before serving, which gave the graham crackers a chance to soften up and made it easier to cut.

Works just as well with a 5.1 oz box of pudding. Also, a tip I read before, and I'll put on here again.... if you don't have time to refrigerate this overnight...dip the graham crackers in milk before layering, this softens them up just as fast as letting the milk from the pudding sit overnight. That tip for me was a lifesaver, bc now it truly is a 10-15 dessert vs a 15 min + fridge time. And I agree w/ the last review. Just zap the frosting in the microwave to pour over the top.

I have been making this dessert for family get-togethers my entire life!  Which is 20 years.  Everyone loves it, I don't know what would happen if I decided not to make it one year!  Definitely follow one user's suggestion of microwaving the frosting if you are using store-bought - that is the way I have always done it, and not only does it make it MUCH easier to spread, the consistency sits much better with the rest of the dessert.  I always try to get it into the fridge the night before serving so that the graham crackers get soft.  Delicious!

This was soooo good. I did not use store bought frosting, I used "Chocolate Frosting I" from this site and only used about 8 oz frosting. It did use much more graham crackers than it said- I used almost the entire box.

This dessert was easy and absolutely delicious. It disappeared so fast I almost didn't get a taste! I made it the day before I wanted to serve it. The graham crackers softened up nicely and I got neat, easy to cut servings. Thanks so much for a great recipe :)

Great Recipe! I used the whole box of Graham crackers, banana pudding, and this sauce:  Mix 1/3 cup cocoa, 1 cup sugar in sauce pan. Add 1 teasp vanilla, 1 stick butter, 1/4 cup milk. Boil for 1 minute, then set aside to cool.  As said before, make this a day ahead of serving!

This was a huge hit at the cookout this weekend! Everyone loved it...all ages! hint..I put the entire tub of icing in the microwave for 25 seconds then stirred it and then spread it on top...much easier.

Had a dinner party and everyone loved this dessert...it's even better 2/3 days later.  Make a chocolate sauce instead of using the the frosting.    **Mix 1/3 cup cocoa, 1 cup sugar in sauce pan. Add 1 teasp vanilla, 1 stick butter, 1/4 cup milk. Boil for 1 minute, then set aside to cool.

Excellent!!!! However, I didn't use the canned frosting; I used BaysChick chocolate sauce recipe.  Make sure you let the dessert sit in the refrigerator for a couple hours until the sauce hardens.  I made it at night, popped it in the fridge,  and it was dessert the next night. Talk about amazing!

this is certainly quick and easy, and fun to make with the kids. but in terms of taste, it's really really boring. i used granny1110's recipe for chocolate topping, which was very good and much better than using a whole stick of butter for anything -- too much fat for such a heavy dessert. but this was not something i would take anywhere for other people. i can think of twenty better and more impressive recipes. unless my six-year-old wants to make this again, i don't think i will.

I had no idea how this would taste- but it turned out delicious. Followed exactly except I used BaysChick's review (first one on recipe page) for the chocolate frosting. This holds up for a long time. Making again really soon!

I find that I enjoy this chocolate topping better (1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar, 1/2 cup cocoa, 3 tablespoons butter, softened, 1/3 cup milk, 2 teaspoons light corn syrup, 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract) Blend sugar and cocoa, add butter and milk mix well, add corn syrup and vanilla...stir til creamy!!  Very delicious cake.... My boyfriend's roommate has had me make it for him on multiple occasions for no apparent reason!!

Wow, great recipe!  I did make changes based on other ratings, using chocolate graham crackers and french vanilla pudding.  For the topping I make a ganache instead of frosting.  Using a double boiler  stir 1/2c heavy cream, 8oz semi-sweet chocolate chips, and 1tsp of instant coffee until smooth, cool for just a few minutes and spread over top layer of graham crackers.  I accidentally forgot the top layer of graham crackers the first few times I made this (has become a weekly dessert), but do like it better with all three layers.  It does use almost a full box of graham crackers, and is definitely better the next day.

I tweaked the recipe, replaced the graham crackers with crushed oreo and the vanilla pudding mix with chocolate pudding mix. The result was marvelous! I also put 2 tbsp of cocoa powder into the mixture to make it more chocolate-y. I used this recipe as a dirt cake for my mom's birthday.

I like to use either french vanilla or white chocolate pudding mix in mine, and I prefer to use nutella - the frosting is just too sweet for me.  (Of course the nutella isn't  LOL)  Fantastic recipe for something that is so easy and quick to whip up!

Very good! Always a hit with everyone. The only thing I do different is use French Vanilla pudding and I use milk chocolate frosting mix. 30 seconds in the microwave (foil removed) and then I pour it onto the dessert. I do let the dessert set up for about 15 minutes or so in the fridge before adding the frosting. We will be making this again and again!

Definitely 5 star yumminess!  I went with the chocolate sauce recipe that someone recommended and I would put less sugar and a little less cocoa in that part.  But the recipe for the actual dessert was perfect!

This is so simple to make, I usually keep the ingredients on hand.  Kids and adults both love this dessert, and people are disappointed when I don't make it!

The only part I thought was really good was the chocolate sauce I made from reviews and that wasn't even part of the original recipe.  I just didn't think this was that great.  It tasted like vanilla pudding and graham crackers.  It would be fine for a simple dessert at home but I definitely won't serve it to other people again.

This was excellent.  Both me and my boyfriend really loved it.  I followed the advice of STARTINGTOMORROW and made the chocolate spread recipe that she listed.  That was a little sweet, but delicious.  I had no idea what I was doing making this recipe, but it turned out great and I'm happy I tried it.  One of my favorite desserts now!

A friend gave me this recipe six years ago and I've been making it since then to rave reviews. BUT, my recipe uses only one small package of vanilla pudding, 1 1/2 c. milk, and 2 C. cool whip. Add 1-2 T of milk to soften icing. Use the same amount of graham crackers and frosting. Be sure to make the day before. The version I have has thinner layers. Yummy!

Fabulous!  I used the chocolate sauce provided by another reviewer, and it made the dessert.  Very easy and delicious!  My hubby wouldn't stay out of the frige!  I will add that it is better the longer you let it sit in the frige.  The longer you let it sit, the more it tastes like an eclair.  We loved it, thanks for sharing!

I made this the other night, not sure how my husband and three sons would respond to it.  My husband loves eclairs, but I wasn't sure how this dessert would rate... and boy did they love it! For my husband and all three sons to love something equally, wow, I just had to give it 5 stars.

Love this recipe. Everyone requests I make this at family get togethers. It's so easy and tastes so good. A tip on the frosting is to heat it a little so that it's easy to spread.

This is really good.  However, I have made it a few different ways and I really prefer it with Club Crackers, French Vanilla pudding and a different chocolate frosting...either Chocolate Glaze I from this site or a Chocolate Ganache.  Club crackers hold up a little better and just taste better with the pudding.  Kids especially love this dessert, but I make it for adults as well.

This is a good n easy dessert.  I made it for New Years.  It is better after sitting for 24 hours so make ahead!  Really rich, but good.  This needs to be kept in the fridge until serving.

Great Recipe...I'm still giving out the recipe to others.  And I always keep the ingredients on hand so I can make it anytime.  I did follow the advice of others and melt the icing in the microwave first...great idea.  Thanks

I have made this dessert over 20 times and it always gets rave reviews! Thanks so much.  The only thing I do differently is I get the "whipped" icing to add to the top.  It goes on smooth and doesn't move the graham crackers around. Great dessert and quick!

I have enjoyed this recipe in the past and forgot how much I enjoy it.  I used all 3 packs of crackers in my dessert.  It worked out well.  I will try with other puddings and crackers.

Excellent, made for my sons graduation party, did not use can frosting per other reviews, but made the easy homemade chocalate sauce topping.  I doubled the recipee, and put in a disposable foil square dish, it was the first dessert to get wiped out at the party, everyone raved how much they loved it!  People are still asking for the recipee, A+++++ on this one.  Oh, 1 more thing, do make 24 hrs in advance, so everything has time to thicken and come together.  Great!!

Everyone loved this dessert and it was easy to make but I think next time I will use chocolate frosting instead of the chocolate sauce recipe provided by another user. It was way to sweet that I could not eat it.

SO GOOD!!!  Definitely better with the chocolate glaze (cocoa, milk, butter, sugar and vanilla) posted in the most helpful reviews.  I have mae this dessert 3 times in the last 2 weeks and am about to go make it again with sugar free pudding, cool whip and splenda for my mom who is a diabetic.

This is after a 8 hour sit in the fridge, but the cake so far is very good and I'm sure only going to get better by tomorrow.  I altered a couple things just based on what was in my pantry.  Cinnamon grahms, and oreo pudding, also didn't have jar frosting so followed the reccomendation of others and used the chocolate sauce recipe by BaysChick.  I will probably try with vanilla pudding the next time, but the oreo cookie pudding is very acceptable!

This is one of the easiest recipes I have ever made.  I took it to a back to school luncheon at my daughter's school. I topped it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe from this site, as many reviewers said the frosting made it too rich, and I don't like store bought frosting personally. I also made it ahead of time and left it in the fridge for 24 hours.  I was not there, but was told I needed to make 50 copies of the recipe as everyone wanted it.  There were people who heard about it but didn't get to taste it, so I made another one today to share tomorrow.  Of course, I'm going to get the first serving this time!!! Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.  I now keep the ingredients on hand for a quick dessert.

I love this dessert and it is sooooooo easy to make.  I like it best after it sits overnight or even a full day in the fridge so that the graham crackers soften a bit.  Good stuff!

I took this dessert to a dinner party and everyone loved it. I used the chocolate glaze like other reviewers said to keep it from being too rich. I also used french vanilla pudding and let it sit in the fridge for a day. Will definitely make again.

This is amazing.  It is helpful to put the icing in the microwave for about a minute and then pour it over the top.  This eliminates a lot of frustration.  Also, letting it sit in the refrigerator overnight makes it soft and more "eclair-like".  A family favorite.

This is great and so easy to make. I made my second one with Banana Cream pudding to give it a little extra taste (nothing wrong with the original vanilla). I think next time I will try it with Cheesecake pudding. My roommate doesn't like cheesecake (go figure), so maybe I'll get more dessert this time!

This was wonderful!  I wanted something rich because I was only serving dessert, so I used french vanilla pudding and 2 cans of evaporated milk.  For the chocolate, I used a whipped chocolate frosting so the chocolate wouldn't be overpowering.  WONDERFULLLLL!!!!

I love this recipe! It  is so, so easy! I've made it many times since first finding the recipe.  One thing that makes it easier is to microwave the chocolate frosting for about 20 seconds.  When the frosting is softer it is much easier to spread over the grahams. Enjoy!

This was good, but was a little rich - even for me and dessert is my favorite meal!  :o)  I personally think it would be better with chocolate drizzled on top instead of covered with chocolate frosting.

Made this over the weekend for a BBQ, so easy and tasty.  Then I found out it was a coworker's birthday today, so I brought the ingredients I had left over and made a half-batch AT WORK this morning!  Looks and tastes like I slaved.  :D  Thanks for the recipe, will make again and again!

Great recipe.  I made this for my mom's birthday on the very same day I saw the recipe.  Since it is July, I did not want to heat the oven and this was perfect as well as quick.  She loves eclairs and this was a hit.  I did add my own cooked hot fudge/icing type sauce on the top instead of icing.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this for my bunko group, and it was a HUGE hit !!!
It is so easy to whip up too :)
I used a little more than 2 pkgs of graham crackers, but I guess just use however many you need to make your layers.
I also recommend micorwaving the frosting to soften it a little before spreading on the top layer of graham crackers.
I will make this many times for years to come I suspect !
Thanks :)

My 2 daughters, ages 10 & 12 helped to make this.  Not only was it fun to make but also fast and easy.  We took it to a family 4th of July BBQ party and everyone raved ab out it.  Of course, I let them take all the credit. It made them happy & I'm sure will encourage them to keep at it.  Thanks!

This was so easy and delicious!  I added diced bananas and toasted macadamia nuts to the layers, and it was a hit!

This was pretty good, but not as spectacular as the other reviews led me to believe. I found the chocolate icing to be too thick and creamy - I would prefer a chocolate glaze as some others suggested. I just ate the bottom part and left the chocolate layer alone, but my husband liked it and finished it off.

I thought this dessert tasted more delicious than the simple ingredients  seemed like they would taste. I used a chocolate glaze (recipe from this site) on top. I disagree with others--I liked it best about two hours after making, NOT the next day. Crackers were too soggy. Five stars for taste, three for presentation.

Delicious!  Per other suggestions, I used the Cinnamon Graham Crackers and used one regular french vanilla pudding and one sugar-free banana cream which added just enough banana flavor.  I also used the extra creamy cool whip. Yummy!  Next time, I am going to try and use all of the low fat and/or sugar free things I can to see how it turns out.  I didn't use the entire can of frosting and felt that there was just a little too much (and I am the kind of person that will eat icing straight out of the can!)

We tried cinnamon graham crackers.  It tasted just like an eclair!  Too much chocolate though.  Microwaving it made it look very nice.  Great ideas!

I found that melting the frosting in the microwave made it easier, then you could just pour it over the top and then refrigerate it.

I made this for our family Easter gathering this year.  I prepared it at 9am, served it at 6pm.  It was chilled perfectly.

EVERYONE just raved about it; my husband ate 3 large servings of it.  It really tasted like a chocolate eclair.  I used the homemade milk chocolate frosting by Betty Crocker.

I will definitely be making this when I need a quick, easy dessert for many.

Ditto what they said.  Regarding the frosting - I let it set up in the frig for about an hour, then put the frosting container in the microwave for about a minute.  No trouble frosting it then.  Oh - and make sure you get a decent frosting because the frosting taste is pronounced.  Thanks Kristie.

Made this with one batch vanilla, and one batch chocolate pudding.  I put grahm crackers on top and bottom, and vanilla wafers in the middle.  My husband loved it (especially day 2).  I thought it tasted like a HoHo.  Really easy and pretty yummy.

I have made this recipe for years also. It is one of my favorites but I also have always used a chocolate glaze for the topping. I think canned frosting is too thick & way too sweet. The pudding & graham crackers are sweet enough. The glaze is a little bitter by itself but put together with the pudding it is just right.

I thought this recipe was good, but my husband and a friend didn't think it worthy of five stars.  I used generic brand graham crackers and they thought it might have been better with a name brand graham cracker.  Also, I cut the recipe down to six servings and put it in an 8x8 pan, which worked out very well.

We love this recipe. It is soooo easy and sooooo good. Make it the night before so it has a chance to really blend. I use skim milk and fat free cool whip and it still tastes great. I also pop the frosting in the microwave for a little bit to get it to be easy to pour and spread. Thanks so much

My grandmother made this dessert for us and I always loved it, especially good for the summer!  I recently made this recipe and almost think next time I might add another box of pudding so as to make those layers a bit thicker.  Also, my grandmother made this extra special by making a batch of fudge to spread over the top and harden.

This dessert was AWESOME!! I got so many compliments on it, and I just can't get over how easy and quick it was to make! I did take the advice of other people who said to microwave the frosting before putting it on, and I am glad I did, that made it much easier. I will definitely be making this again!

The easiest yet most delicious dessert I've ever made.  It was hard to have only 1 piece.  Definately make it early in the day so the graham crackers have a chance to soften a bit.  Yummy!

Divine.  I know no words.  One of those desserts that people would think you spent hours on... but it's so simple.  I need to figure out a way to make the graham cracker more defined.  It was almost soggy.  Maybe double layers... maybe I'll read some reviews and see if anyone put in a tip on that...

I've been making this very same recipe for years, and it always gets rave reviews.  At a cookout, one person even referred to it as "Satan in a pan" because he couldn't stop eating it.

My brother had to make something French for his French class, and the day before his project was due he had nothing!  I found this recipe, and while I was making it I desperately hoped it would turn out well.

His class ate every bit of this!  He has requested this dish from me several times, and I have some chilling right now.

Wonderful and simple.  Can't ask for more than that.

This took a total of 5 minutes to put together and it came out delicious.  I am all about quick and easy dessert recipes, and it really can't get much easier than this.  My boyfriend took it to work with him and claims it was gone in seconds.  He gladly took ownership of the dessert!!!

This is a super easy and delicious recipe!  In fact, I am often asked for the recipe and I hesitate to give it out because I don't want people to know how easy it is to make.  I also make this in a slightly smaller pan (such as an 8 x 11) so that it is thicker.

I made this for my relatives for thanksgiving dinner today, and they loved it! I didn't have the time for the pudding to soften the graham crackers, so I just crushed them all before I started. I also sprinkled chocolate chips on the top for decoration. Turned out really good!

This was not that great. I thought it would be better with all the rave reviews. I think it gets better over time, but not that great. The cream filling is ok, just jellow pudding. It is just a really simple ok recipe.

Wow, really does taste like an eclair. I used Hershey's perfectly chocolate chocolate frosting recipe for the top--too rich! Next time I'll just use a commercially packaged tube of frosting. Also, I used regular vanilla pudding, I think using French Vanilla pudding would work out much better for this recipe. Thanks Kristie, this recipe is unbelievably easy and delicious...will definitely be making this one again!

Absolutley Fantastic!!!!!!!  I made this for Sunday dinner with the kids and grandkids and everyone loved it.  It is so easy.  This really did taste like an eclair.  I used Low Fat frozen shipped topping and sugare free pudding, and it was so good.

My Mother In Law gave me this recipe years ago, it is one of the first desserts to go whenever I take it somewhere. I like to chill it for 24 hours so the "crust" is nice and soft. Huge hit with the kids!

I made this for a small dinner party and everyone loved it!  I, however, would have liked more of that yummy filling in my serving...tasted too much cracker,  so I think I'll make it in a smaller pan next time.

Yum!  Everyone enjoyed and it was very easy to prepare!  Per previous reviews, I microwaved the frosting for 20-30 seconds so it was easy to pour over the dessert.  I'll definately make this again!

This is so easy to make and so yummy. I made mine several hours before, and it turned out perfect. I ended up using almost a whole box of graham crackers.

This was fantastic!  I wish I had let it sit a little longer in the fridge so the graham crackers could soften a little more.  I highly recommend this easy, cheap, and fast dessert.

This is,"To Die For."  Easy and oh so good!  Made in a 8x8 pan and used 1 pk. of diet van. pudding with 1 1/2 cups of milk.  Mixed in about 1 cup of 96% fat free cool whip.  Put on old graham crackers and topped with my own icing recipe.  Had it for dessert after supper and had to have it for our midnight snack also.  Sure won't last long with the two of us!  Thank so much for an easy and super good recipe!

So easy and so delicious!  The only thing I changed was to use a homemade chocolate sauce on top.  You definitely want to make this the night before or at least early in the morning.

This is an overall excellent recipe. While it's not exactly an eclair, it has all the flavor of one in MUCH less time. My family of five absolutely loved it. 
The one complaint I have is that the graham crackers got soggy after sitting a couple of hours, and fell apart when you tried to take a piece out. It's better right away.
Thanks for this recipe, I'll definitely be making it again!

Loved Loved Loved this recipe!!!!!  I used ff/sf cheesecake flavored pudding as suggested in other reviews.  Also used whipped chocolate frosting and it seemed to spread ok.  It was a little tricky.  Definetely worth making again.  Made this for a bunch of soldiers, and it was gone in no time! Thanks!

Wow, geat tasting, simple recipe! I had an outdoor picnic and was searching for simple things to add. This was just the ticket. My 14 yr old daughter made this for me in just 15 or 20 mins. She put it together Thurs night, and the picnic was Saturday. We had it in the frig and it was great. As someone else suggested we went a  little light on the frosting and I used light whipped topping, I think maybe next time I'll use lofat pudding. Truly, an exellelent recipe!  Phyllis

This recipe is even better if you can find French Vanilla instead of regular Vanilla pudding mix. We really like it with DARK Chocolate Frosting as well! Also is better if has overnight or 8 hours to refrigerate first!

I was very excited to make this dessert since it was an easy way to get that eclair flavor without all of the work of making eclairs.  However, I have to agree with another reviewer that said this tasted like a cafeteria dessert.  It really lacked something for me and the rest of my family.  I ended up throwing half of it away.  Sorry!

I just found this recipe about a month ago and have already made it twice.  The first time I substituted chocolate fudge pudding for the vanilla and used much less frosting to glaze the top layer of graham crackers.  It still had plenty of chocolate flavoring but was less fattening.  The second time I used sugar and fat free vanilla pudding with chocolate and honey graham crackers.  It was still wonderful, and I'm excited to try this dish with other flavors.  Thanks for the recipe, Kristie!

Considering the reviews it wasn't as spectacular as I thought it would be but it was good - can't go too wrong with the ingrediants! I Loved how easy and quick it was to make.  I think I played around with the recipe too much based on other reviews so mine tasted a bit like a catch all dessert.  If I make it again, I'll stick to making it simplier - closer to the original.  Overall it tasted good and was very easy to make but wouldn't quite give it a 5.

It wasn't that this dessert was bad, it just didn't do a lot for me. It wasn't something that, when you taste it, your reaction is "oooohhhh, wow". It tasted like a cafeteria dessert. Not gross at all, just lacked that homeade yumminess.

OH MY, MY, MY!!! SO yummy!!! I came across this recipe and had to make it but all I had was one larger size box of pudding. It didn't matter ~ was still fantastic. Also, I used chocolate graham crackers instead of regular. this was so good that a bowl or plate isn't needed...just the pan and a spoon.

I love this recipe! I made it non-dairy, using soy milk and for the chocolate topping i used non dairy chocolate chips mixed with a little non dairy creamer -- It still tasted amazing!

Good and very easy, but I only give 5 stars to things that are to die for.  Not that good.

I thought this was very good. I couldn't wait to try it, but should have waited like suggested. I will also heat the frosting next time for much easier spreading. Also can't wait to try different puddings ect. as suggested.......Very good :)

I hate recipes that call for just about every ingredient on this list, but this is definitely a keeper.  I made real whipped cream to nix the coolwhip.  I used one instant french vanilla and one instant cheesecake pudding, honeymaid graham crackers and the pourable chocolate frosting, and this was really good.  I had made this a few years back and lost the recipe, and saw the picture on the main page here and thought that'll be a great dessert to take to a potluck I was going to today.  As usual, everyone that tried it wanted the recipe.  This is definitely better made the day before.

Very easy and delicious no-bake dessert.  Several years ago my husband won first place in our church's Men's Bake Off Contest with this.  It is definately a hit!

I've made this twice now.  It's so easy and everyone loves it.  I used a little more icing than called for, as well as a little more cool whip - it turned out great.  It's a keeper!

Quick, easy, and tasty.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I found a variation I like even better:  chocolate graham crackers, white chocolate instant pudding, and use a can of Betty Crocker "melt 'n pour" chocolate frosting.  My kids lick the bowl clean every time and cheer when they hear I'm planning to make this dessert for dinner!

This has always been one of my favorite desserts.  It's incredible.  We use one chocolate pudding on the bottom layer and vanilla on the top.  The longer it sits, the better it is!

I went overboard in making this recipe.  I made homemade whipped cream, because our grocery store was being remodled, and I couldn't find the cool whip.  And I am not a big fan of already made frosting, so I made my own, with the recipe someone recommended in the reviews.  I also used French Vanilla pudding, instead of vanilla.  The first thing that came out of my mouth when I tried a piece was it tastes like and eclair.  Both my boyfriend and I loved it, and it was really easy to make despite my going overboard.  I would make it again.

Every time I make, it is a HUGE hit! People love it. I have made many times. I use the chocolate sauce recipe someone else suggested and I always make it the night before. It really does get better the longer it sits. Thank you very much for this one!

OH YUM!!!! If I could, I would give this 10 stars...an amazing dessert with hardly any effort! I used french vanilla pudding & freshly whipped cream. Make it the night before you want to serve it, so everything melds together. LOVE IT!!!!

DANGER! DANGER! Make this only if you're taking it AWAY from your house with LOTS of other people around to make sure you don't bring any home with you. I made the mistake of making it for only 4 people and found myself eating the rest all by myself. Naughty Naughty. You must have willpower to resist this.

This is very good but not great.  The best part about it is that it's quick & easy.  
  I used real whipped cream in place of cool whip (despise the stuff) & added chopped almonds on top of chocolate frosting.

Easy to make and very good. Have made it a few times. It tastes even better the next day. Have also tried it with banana pudding. I've  used  different flavors of graham crackers too. If you do choose to use frosting, it works much better if warmed in the microwave. Frosting will then pour easily on the top. 
  Good recipe, will continue to use.

This is very good, just like the dessert they serve on the buffet line at K.F.C. Actually it is no more than pudding with graham crackers. I omitted the frosting (would be too sweet and heavy) & sprinkled a light dusting of more grahams on top. I used cinnamon grahams and this added a little extra layer of flavor. the chocolate grahams would be good also. Not real heavy but will fix your chocolate cravings. I'd make again for sure.

I made it after coming home late and tired....It was so easy, I was in bed and asleep in 30 minutes.  DON'T forget the recipe ask for INSTANT Pudding mix and not the kind you have to cook.  ALSO it is better when you refrigerate it for at least 12 hours.

I used sugar-free pudding and this tasted wonderful.  Also used the "pour" frosting - what a breeze.

This was one of the easiest and great desserts I've made!  I made it the night before and the next day the graham crackers were a little soft which worked out great for serving and eating!  They now make a "pourable" frosting, just heat and pour, it worked great for this dessert! Thanks for the recipe!

The first time I made this recipe was for a church dinner. The pan was gone in no time and everyone raved about it. I then took it to a meal at my in-laws home and everyone couldn't stop talking about how delicious it was. Now they all request it every time we get together. Thanks for sharing this quick, easy & delicious recipe! I will make it time and time again!

Although this dessert tasted wonderful, the texture became liquid.  I ended up freezing it prior to serving.  I am sure that I must have made a mistake in preparing it.  If anyone has any ideas, let me know because I would like to make this again.  I did use fat free ingredients (pudding and cool whip) although I see no reason why this would be a problem.

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could.  Chocolate, pudding, whipped cream, graham crackers .... what's NOT to love?!  We made this as kids and it's still a favorite today.

One of the most easiest & delicious desserts I have ever made & tried!  My whole family loved it!  Its great because others can't believe it is such a simple-to-do dessert!  I did microwave the frosting, and I don't recommend using all of the frosting either. Just a thin layer on top does it! (& thats even with me loving choc.frosting!)

Pretty tasty, but not spectacular.  Putting a little milk on the graham crackers does make the process go a little faster.  I used cream cheese chocolate frosting, and that was really good.

This is very quick and easy to make.  I used one package vanilla pudding and one package cheesecake pudding, which made a nice difference.  I personally thought this was good (better the next day), but the people I served it to couldn't stop eating it!  Will make again.

Loved it... mmmm mmmm... tried it with a few tablespoons of cream cheese.  As well, I microwaved the chocolate frosting and poured it on.  Definitely tastes better the second day when the gramham crackers are softened.  If you can't wait until the next day, then pour a bit on milk on the graham crackers to soften them.

I was looking for a fabulous quick dessert & the reviews on this made it seem the perfect choice.  I followed the recipe, adjusted according to helpful suggestions, & was disappointed.  The dessert looks fine & tastes okay.  There was no disguising the graham crackers, though.  They were still graham crackers. I would eat this again if I saw it, but I don't think I'll make it.  It doesn't "measure up" to the quality I like to serve.  (My brother said it was having a choice of this or homemade huckleberry ice cream.  It didn't stand a chance!)

Quick, easy, and delicious! This is great to take to work, parties, etc - it absolutely disappears! I add  sliced fresh strawberries on top of mine for a little more color.

I gave this four stars because everyone in the family came up for seconds, except myself. I would personally rate this 2 1/2 stars. It really did nothing for me taste wise.(Just another sweet dessert, didn't stand out) It was easy to assemble , so that I like. I would probably NOT make this again.

This was fantastic & easy!  Everyone was raving about what a good "cook" I was.  Of course I didn't tell them that I didn't really do any "cooking".

This could not be any easier or more delicious!  I took the advice of microwaving the icing for 30 seconds.  It poured right out and I didn't even need to use a spatula at all.  We had the first half 3 hours after I made it and some of the grahams were still a bit crunchy.  We polished it off the next evening and it was perfect.

This recipe was excellent.  I made it for a dinner party and everyone raved about it.  They went back for seconds and thirds.  It was extremely easy. I also made the chocolate sauce from the previous post and it was well worth it.

I loved how cheap and easy this dessert was.  It tasted quite well too.  My husband, mother-in-law and her friend thought it was delicious.
I didnt use the sugar as suggested, and it was very sweet without it.
Look forward to the lowfat version of this - oh, and the cheap Walmart brand cookies and pudding mix work great!  A fantastic pudding for $3!

This recipe was so easy! I just made it for an office BBQ and everyone loved it. I will definitely make this again. I, too, melted the frosting for 30 - 45 minutes in the microwave and it was a lot easier to spread. I also used French Vanilla pudding which made it taste great.

I just made this for Easter and it was a big hit.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used the french vanilla cool whip.  It was delicious and everyone wanted the recipe.  I made a fancy cake and everyone liked this better.  Thanks!

I had no idea chocolate frosting could taste so good.  I melted the frosting first. (When I make a recipe from this site the first time I always follow it to the "T")It looked so nice that I didn't want to wreck it by spreading the frosting so I melted it and poured it on.  Everyone liked it.  My brother came over and i offered him a piece he said no then when he saw it he had to have a piece and he to liked it.

This was absolutely fantastic.  It's even better because it can be put together so easily! It was really neat-looking, too, with all the layers.  I took it to a church luncheon and it was all gobbled up.  I'm not sure how to serve it, though.  Do you cut it into squares and try to serve it that way?  I brought my serving spoon to have people scoop it out.  It didn't look very neat that way, but it was still good!  I did take the advice of another reviewer and nuked the chocolate frosting so I could basically pour it on.  That was very helpful.  Very, very good!!!

Yummy! I used banana cream pudding but next time I'll try the recommended vanilla. It does taste good after it's been in the fridge a while, but I also liked it fresh when the crackers are still crunchy.

Excellent!  As suggested by other reviewers I microwaved the frosting 45 seconds (be sure to remove the foil under the plastic lid and then put the lid back on) You will have an easy to spread frosting that leaves a smooth top.  I grated a little sweet chocolate and sprinkled over the top. Set in refrigerator for about 8 hours to soften the graham crackers. Great dessert!

Was an "ok" dessert.  I did make it the night before to make it more mushy, which was a great suggestion.  I was told that it needed more chocolate, yet it was too sweet as it was.  Would maybe use it again as a quick make dessert.

This is wonderful!  I even used fat and sugar free products (my sister in law is diabetic) and it still turned out great!  I will be making this again!  A great dessert to have on a diet since it can be made with little fat.

This was extremely easy and fast to make.  I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out with the graham crackers and all, but when I served it at my party it was awesome!  All my guests loved it and it is something you can tweak to your own taste.  I also used 3 packs of graham crackers.  Highly recommend for something good and easy.

Simple, easy heaven!  Halved recipe, used french vanilla pudding as suggested in other reviews,  added a bit of cream cheese and touch of sourcream to give more of a cheesceake taste.   Also, made homemade cream and whipped chocolate frosting with a little bit of milk for a a creamier topping.  My three year old and my boyfriend love it!!  DElISH!  thanks Kristie.

Yummy!  I took this to a barbeque and everybody loved it!  It was so simple to make, it only took a few minutes!  I only had cinnamon graham crackers on hand, but they worked out just fine.  This is great because it's mostly ingredients that you have somewhere in your cupboards anyway!

The recipe couldn't be easier!  I followed the advice to heat the frosting in the microwave to make it pourable. My husband loved this. . .but I thought it tasted mostly like graham crackers.  I'll make it for him in the future and half the recipe.

I think I didn't mix my pudding mix long enough.  It was separating when I mixed in the whipped cream.  Then I couldn't figure out how anybody could possible spread the icing on top of the graham crackers.. it looked bad, didn't taste too bad, but certainly not my "cup of tea"

This recipe was good, not absolutely great.  Unfortunately soggy graham crackers still taste like soggy graham crackers.  I added some cream cheese and amaretto to the pudding which tasted delicious.

I have made this...more than a dozen times...usually always for a party and it is  receieved very well. People are amazed at just how simple it really is. Each time I change the pudding flavor but I have to admit...my favorite is bananna.
