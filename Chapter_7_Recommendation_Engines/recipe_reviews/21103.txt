Cracked wheat gives a little crunch to this bread, great for sandwiches. Instead of 3 cups bread flour, I used 1 1/3 cup bread flour, 1/3 cup cornmeal and an additional 1 2/3 cup whole wheat flour (2 cups whole wheat flour total).

Excellent bread!  Texture was light, cracked wheat adds a little crunch.  The only caveat was my crust was slightly crunchy (but that was because the dough was too large for my 1.5 lb Zojirushi) and I had to continue baking the bread in the oven at 375 for another 15 minutes after the baking cycle completed.  Even after that little snafu, the bread still came out tasty with a light texture which will be great for sandwiches and toast!  Will need to use the dough cycle next time and bake in a 9x5 loaf pan.  Note:  I subbed in 1-1/3 cup whole wheat flour (instead of using just 1/3 cup of whole wheat and reduced bread flour to 2 cups).  Highly recommend!  Thanks Sue!

Dense texture and nicely flavored. As always, I added 2T gluten to aid in the rising and structure of the texture. Good bread and lovely when toasted.Set bread machine for dough cycle, then shaped into loaf and baked in 9X5 pan at 375 degrees for 33 minutes. Thanks Sue.

Nice recipe. The people I bake bread for gave it 5 stars. I made a few changes that were mentioned in the reviews. Butter instead of margarine, 2 cups of bread flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour, and just a bit more cracked wheat. I did make one mistake and that was I soaked the cracked wheat in water that wasn't part of the bake so the hydration of the loaf was a bit wetter and had to add a bit more flour to compensate for that. Next time I'll read the directions a little better!!

I used olive oil instead of margarine, and added a bit of flax seed for the health benefits. I will make this again.

I made this with 2 1/3 c. of whole wheat flour and it still rose very nicely. I made this into one 9x5 pan and one mini loaf. This recipe doesn't call for soaking the cracked wheat first because the recipe is for a bread machine. If you are not using a bread machine, you may want to let the cracked wheat soak in water or milk first; it keeps you from having tooth-chipping nuggets in your bread. I'd also add another 1/2 t. of salt to this.

My family and I loved this recipe!  It doesn't taste "yeasty" as a lot of the others have. I added some whole oats well after "the beep for adding more ingredients". Other than that I stuck to the recipe and it was awesome.  I am making it again today!

I used honey instead of brown sugar. I used the dough setting on my bread machine and then took the dough out and put it in a 9x5 inch pan to rise for 30 minutes. Then I baked for 40 min at 350 degrees. It was very good except maybe a little dry. I might put a bit more water in next time.

I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of bread flour and it came out delicious.  Also replaced margarine with olive oil and agave nectar for the  brown sugar - much healthier.

This is a great bread with nice crumb and flavor.  Used to make it all the time and dream of making it again, if only I had time! The crunch to the crust is great and always a hit with my daughter.

I made this today with great success. I had to alter it a bit..I soaked 1/4 c cracked wheat in 1/2 c hot water, then cooled it before adding in the regular order. Used 2T olive oil rather than margarine, 2 c whole wheat flour, 3/4 c bread flour, 1/4 c flax meal, 1/4 c ground oats and 2 T wheat gluten. Baked it in my oven at 405 degrees, as it is convection and I have to raise the temp by 35 degs for the 8400ft elevation where I live. The bread is great, dense and firm texture for toast or sandwiches.  I will make it again soon.

This is a nice tasting bread. I love it toasted. I did make a couple modifications, as I noticed my loaves had more air pockets than I liked. When I made just the dough in the bread machine, then transferred it to a loaf pan to rise, I'd notice a nice rise at first. However, if the loaf got bumped at all, it would deflate some. I upped the salt to 1 1/2 tsp and the yeast to 2 1/4 tsp (1 pkg). These modifications have worked best for me.

Made according to the recipe.  Flavor was good but it had very little crunch.  I'm going to try adding the cracked wheat after the first kneed next time.

We really liked this bread. I made a few changes as I don't have a  bread maker. I started by proofing the yeast in the sugar and 1/4 cup of warm water. I was tempted to go with honey instead of the brown sugar and will probably do that next time. I wanted it a little healthier so I upped the wholewheat to 1 1/3 cups, added a heaping tbs of ground flax and added 2 tbs of vital wheat gluten to help the rise. Everything else I kept the same. I baked the loaf, free form, at 350º for just under 40 minutes.

The first loaf I made fell in the middle but tasted great. I made another loaf and added 2 Tbls of vital gluten. The loaf came out beautiful. I will continue to use this recipe. If you can't find cracked wheat you can use wheat berry and crack it in a coffee grinder.

Tried this recipe...it's the best!  The only change I made was adding 2 TB butter instead of 2 TB margarine.  Add the ingredients in the order listed for your bread machine and you can't go wrong.  Nice and light.  The cracked wheat is a nice addition, without being overpowering.

Great bread.  I also added 2 tablespoons of gluten & 2 cups of whole wheat flour & placed it in the microwave to rise which worked well the first time.  The second time I made it, it was not rising so heated my oven to the lowest setting (170), turned the oven off & put the bread in & it raised beautifully.  Also added some wheat germ. Did not use a bread machine, just kneaded it myself.
