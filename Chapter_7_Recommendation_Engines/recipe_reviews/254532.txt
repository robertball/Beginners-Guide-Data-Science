I found this recipe looking for something to use up the 4 pounds of besan (gram flour) I had. The basic recipe is fine, but I wouldn't bother draining the zucchini since I ended up adding 1/3 cup of water as it was quite dry and thick by the end of mixing. Next  time I'm going to use  Craisins instead of raspberries. Also, it was done after 1 hour 5 minutes in my oven.
