My mother in law has always made a brownie like this for holidays, but refuses to share the recipe!  (She says it's in her will)  Imagine the look of surprise on her face when I showed up with these!  I don't need her recipe anymore!  My husband says they are even bettter than Mom's!

These brownies were very dry and bland! I would suggest buying quick bake brownies and just adding some peppermint extract to them. That's what I am going to do next time.

These were moist and minty.  I think the frosting was the best part; it was awesome!

This recipe was way too sweet- I used it to impress my friends at a football tailgating party, and I couldn't even bring them they turned out so bad... I would decrease the sugar and definitely make a different kind of the frosting- the powdered sugar ruined it.

great idea, saw similar dessert at Starbucks. I used a brownie mix and added the peppermint extract. Only problem was the amount of frosting was completely lacking, I had to triple the recipe to get the right amount. Colored the frosting pink with some food color & they looked & tasted great.
