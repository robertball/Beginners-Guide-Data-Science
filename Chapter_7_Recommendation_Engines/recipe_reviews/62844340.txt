We made this from the can recipe, but that recipe makes a ton of food, so we mostly cut it in half.   We still used the full can of Hatch Whole Green Chiles, and added a final layer of cheese, so we probably used close to the full amount of cheese as well.

I used a 19 oz. can of  Las Palmas Green Chile Enchilada Sauce because it was cheaper and I wanted to try it.  I like a lot of gravy so this slightly larger can added to the flavor for me.

I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I think it is too big for most families, and we  modified it a bit as well.  This reduced recipe still gave us 6 good servings.  I think you'd get 10 out of the original recipe.  I will be making it again. One other change I will implement next time will be to use tomato sauce (for those not from the USA, this is not the same as ketchup - it is like tomato paste) in place of the diced tomatoes.  The diced tomatoes were too large for my liking.
