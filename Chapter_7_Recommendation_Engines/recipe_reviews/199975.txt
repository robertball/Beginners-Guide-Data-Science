This is a very nice mild hummus like spread. It was very good on a roasted pepper sandwich.  I used half of the spread as a dip by adding smoked paprika and fresh chopped white onion and cilantro.  This is so easy and versatile that I will definitely make it again.

My very picky daughter loves this on a toasted roll and with a slice of american.  I've also made it with 1/4 cup mayo instead of the olive oil, lemon instead of lime.  It's even great the next day because the acid from the lime keeps the avocodo from browning.

Very good. Sweeter and coarser in texture than guacamole but a neat way to stretch the avocado when they are expensive. Another bonus is that it didn't oxidize and turn brown like regular guac.

I thought this was really bland.  I tried it just as is.  Later I added jalepeno, onion and tomatoes.  Those helped quite a bit.

This is delicious! For an even easier version: I used fresh shelled edamame from Trader Joe's instead of the called for frozen. You won't be disappointed.

My husband has a garlic allergy so I had to omit that.  Garlic may have improved this, but it is really kind of bland.

Yum! Mine turned out a bit more like a guacamole since I had to add an extra avacado to ease my struggling blender (was at big thick for it to get through). Very yummy though and I love that the edamame gives it an extra protein punch!
