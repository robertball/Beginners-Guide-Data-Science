The sweet and sour mix is unique, but it doesn't taste quite right

We like the flavor, but I end up adding a little orange juice or water to it because it is so thick!

It was extremely thick and not enough ingredients for my Vitamix to blend. I wound up doubling the sweet and sour and  adding the juice of 1 orange. I gave it only 3 stars because I had to alter the recipe by adding extra liquid. It would be 5 stars with these additions. Thanks for sharing.
