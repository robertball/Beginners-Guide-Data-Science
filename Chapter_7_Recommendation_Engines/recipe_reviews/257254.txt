Tangy and zippy! I added some black lime powder (loomi aswad) and some cayenne pepper. I also used some precooked tri-colored quinoa that I had in the freezer. Can't get any easier than that! Next time, I'll add an avocado. Thank you for the recipe.

Made exactly as the recipe stated and it's wonderful. It is mild flavored yet rich tasting at the same time. So easy and quick to make. Perfect for those hot summer days and a great source of protein from the beans and quinoa. This is a keeper.

Delish recipe! I added fresh garlic, chili powder and 1/2 of a fresh jalapeno for a little bite. Super easy and quick. I will be making this often

Excellent, refreshing salad!  I tend to like lots of lime flavor so if I'm making this for my weekly lunches I add a bit more lime juice each day.

Wow, this taste like a bowl from chipotle but at half the calories and much more healthier! Will definitely be remaking this in the future!

I made this salad for the second time for our Memorial Day barbecue, per my son’s request as he really liked it from the first time I made it.  It’s an easy recipe to follow and fairly quick to make. It’s a hit at my house, everyone loves it!

Yes. I’ll make it again. I didn’t have lime zest but it was so good anyway.

This recipe is great!  The addition of lime zest gives it a nice boost of flavor.
I added a red bell pepper for extra flavor and substituted canola oil for avocado oil, because I don't have any.
I omit the cilantro for the picky eaters--I'm sure it would balance well with the lime though.
I juiced the lime used for the zest--it doesn't make sense to use the packaged lime juice when you have the better fresh option.
I make this salad all the time, and even the carnivores in my family love it.
Thanks!

This was a nice side to some quick enchiladas I made.  It would be good with a quesadilla for a weeknight dinner or lunch.  tasted even better the next day!

This has quickly become a favorite side dish for me.  I have to watch my sodium intake so I use low sodium chicken broth to cook the quinoa.  The flavor is nice and not overpowering.  My family really enjoys it too.

I make this all the time, but often confuse it with a similar quinoa recipes, that includes a tablespoon or so of curry powder and dried fruit like cranberries in the mix, so sometimes I add that too. This is one of those dishes that gets better after it has had time to cool down together a bit, so if you can make it ahead and keep in the fridge, it's especially good.
