A very good and healthy breakfast! The times and temps the submitter gave in the recipe are spot on too.

This made a tasty and quick summer dinner with sourdough toast and a spinach salad. I used 3 eggs with 3 whites, a whole cup of broccoli, green onions instead of the sweet onion, and not quite as much feta as called for in the recipe.

I measured for a 10‚Äù pan. Very hard to flip! Cut in into four pieces and turned it that way to finish cooking. Tasted good.
