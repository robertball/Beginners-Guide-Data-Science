First of all, the recipe should be called stuffed artichoke BOTTOMS as asked for in the ingredients.  Big difference. I am an expert chef and this is a wonderful appetizer, with these changes.  I put 1/4 cup of the Parmesan in the cream cheese mixture and added 1/4 tsp. garlic powder to the mixture and 1/2 tsp. Laurie's lemon pepper to the mixture also.  So I did not need to sprinkle the artichokes with garlic or pepper. Also only dipped the bottoms of the artichokes in butter and that was plenty !  Also I baked at 350 for about 30 minutes.  I got rave reviews at my dinner party.  You must try this.

These are incredibly good, addictive, and easy to make. I scaled the whole recipe back to use 1 can of bottoms, but I ended up having to increase the cream cheese/sour cream mixture again to fill all of them. The lemon pepper gives a nice flavor but I think there is a little more salt going on than I care for, so I would probably skip it next time. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and was glad I did, for the same reason. Overall, excellent! Will definitely make again! Thanks!

These were DELICIOUS!!! I am only giving the recipe 4 stars because I changed it up just a little. I used garlic powder instead of salt. I did not use the amount of lemon pepper called for, I just lightly sprinkled it over the artichoke bottoms. I didn't have chives, so I just finely chopped a green onion (green top also), and mixed that in. Also, I used one can of artichoke bottoms, but still used the amount of filling called for in the recipe, but maybe my artichokes were bigger than normal. My family really liked them. I will definately make this recipe again! Thanks for posting. :)

I have never tried an artichoke so I tried this recipe because the picture is so beautiful and looks delicious. I made them for Thanksgiving as was such a big hit, I was quite surprised because I was iffy about them once I made it but awesome.

These are very good. I didn't have chives so I used cream cheese with chives already in it.  I also scaled back the recipe because I wasn't sure if we would like them but next time I plan on making the full recipe because these were delicious !!  Thanks for sharing .

Made these for mother's day and they were so good.  I couldn't find artichoke hearts by themselves so I just bought canned whole artichokes and hollowed them out and filled them with the filling (which made for a very difficult time).  I didn't use any lemon pepper, used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and I also added some of the parm cheese into the filling.  If I can find the artichoke hearts, I will make them again.

I made these exactly as the recipe had them. They didn't taste bad, but they didn't taste good either. They taste exactly like artichoke hearts with sour cream, cream cheese and garlic salt. In other words, nothing blended together. So making these and eating them really isn't worth the high calories.

I made these last night.  Scaled the recipe down to one can of artichokes.  As per another reviewer, I increased the filling ingredients to have enough.  I forgot the lemon pepper, but added a dash of cayenne and it was great.  The can I used had 12 chokes in it, hubby ate 8 of them himself!  I did not coat the entire choke in butter, just dipped the bottoms in butter so it was less calories.  I also used no fat cream cheese and sour cream.  Delish!

I love stuffing artichoke bottoms (much easier than hearts)! These were a bit rich for my taste so I added changed the filling around, using anchovies (though soy sauce would be great too!), fresh garlic and fresh lemon juice and zest. Yum!

I just made these for my Christmas Eve buffet table and the last one had to be cut 4 ways as people were fighting over them!! They were FANTASTIC !! The hardest part was finding the bottoms which I did in the 3rd grocery store I went to. There were 6 bottoms in each can, so the 3 cans were perfect for the amount of filling. I baked them about 3 hrs before use, covered with foil and set on stove as I  had other things to put in my small oven. Then just re-heated for 10 mins when the guests arrived. They don't need to be really hot to enjoy. The ONLY change I made was a little more chives as I love chives. Thanks for my new appetizer recipe Jackie!!!

I enjoyed this recipe and it was very easy to make. I only gave it four stars b/c I altered it. I used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt and added salt. I also used green onion instead of chives and no lemon pepper. I also added parm to the stuffing. Very tasty!

I made this for a party once and it was a huge hit.  From then on every party I'm invited to, they ask me to bring my stuffed artichoke hearts.

I used whole Artichoke Hearts  instead of just "bottoms" -- simply pushed a "hole" in the top part of the choke and filled that with the prescribed ingredients.  It was a big hit with the family but I personally found it very "rich" and tasted nothing but cream cheese!  I would probably make it again though because it got great reviews from the crowd!

Oh Holy delicious!!!!!  I couldn't eat just one!!!  That's for sure!!!!!  I substituted 1/2 cup of the Parmesan Cheese for a 1/2 cup of Pecorino Romano cheese. I also used 2 TBS of sour cream instead of 1. I also added 2 TBS of whole milk ricotta to the cream cheese mix. I did not have lemon pepper so I just sprinkled regular black pepper.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!!!! It was the perfect lunch treat for my mom and I. xoxoxoxoxoxoxo
----------------------------------------------------------ETA:  Just made these the second time!  Better then the first!!!!  Even the kids are gobbling them up!

This was really, really good. I made it just as the recipe says, and it turned out great. It was very easy to make too. I also raised the temperature to 400, because I was cooking other things, and I needed an appetizer fast, and it was still great.

I wish there were 10 stars to choose from instead of only 5.  OMG this is an awesome recipe for atrichoke hearts and more than worth the prep time which took me more than the 15 minutes listed here.  No alterations needed for this recipe.

Really good recipe. I didn't have chives, so I mixed in onion powder and a little parsley. A little too buttery, I might skip that part next time. I've been eating a bit healthier lately, so the butter really seemed overwhelming. It's a keeper though. I'd like to try it with the chives next time.

These were really good. Everyone enjoyed them. I think I will try adding the spices to the cream cheese mixture next time. Didn't really taste the spices by just putting them on the bottom. Def will make again.

I was in a real hurry and was not really reading the instructions  so, I ended up putting all the ingredients together  and stuffed the artichokes. I then looked at the directions and saw my mistake. I also only had 15 mins before I had to leave the house. Oh well how could I remedy the situation, i sprinkled a little Parmesan on top of each, upped the oven to 400 and cooked them for 10 minutes and they were just fine. I am not sure why they would need 45 minutes anyway. A comedy of errors turned out well

They were okay.  A little too much Parmesan for my liking and just one "cheesy" note.  I would like to keep working with this recipe and tweak it some more.   I am glad that I read a review for some other pointers too.

HUGE HIT! I left the leaves on the artichokes and scooped out the middle to create a cup. More room for filling! A bit more work but worth it. They were gone in 10 minutes. So delicious!

Very easy to make and were a real hit!  The canned artichoke bottoms that I bought were huge so seemed almost a meal rather than an appetizer.  Will definitely make them again!

OK, listen up ms.  expert chef.  I steamed 10 medium artichokes fresh with a sliced garlic and half a lemon.  Now after having  the hearts ready to stuff (and the recipe clearly calls for artichoke hearts) I squeezed fresh lemon and garlic powder on the artichokes.  I mixed  cream cheese, sour cream, feta cheese, blue cheese, gorgonzola, and chopped fresh chives from the garden.  All the cheeses were about two tablespoons except for a little more sour cream.  Instead of dredging in parmesan cheese I dipped the whole  stuffed artichokes in  real butter and rolled in  Italian bread crumbs. Da, da, you see I'm a REAL master chef for 60 years and my rendition was well worth sharing.  Try it "Suefood" you'll flip over it.

I made this some time ago, and just realized that I hadn't rated it. We loved this - had it for a light dinner and it was very satisfying. I used frozen artichoke bottoms - just cooked them until barely tender in accordance with the package directions.  I always use Greek yogurt instead of sour cream (not readily available here). I loved it with the cream cheese, but I may try it with the local version of ricotta, to lighten it just a bit. And next time I will follow two reviewers' suggestion to combine the spices with the cream cheese mixture.

Just popped the baking dish into the oven. I used only 2 cans of artichoke bottoms (12 pieces, varying sizes). The amount of filling was just right. Had I done more artichokes I would have run out of filling. They're in the oven now, will let you know... Baked for 50 min, just had them for dinner, and they are delish! One little thing I'm not sure how to correct is that the parmesan coating kind of melted off. Made this a 2nd time. I mixed the melted butter with the parmesan cheese and spooned over the top of each. Much better--and increased flavor!

These ingredients remind of stuffed atichoke hearts that were served in a restaurant that has since closed.  The only thing is that they were breaded and fried.  Do you think these can be breaded and fried with same fillings?
