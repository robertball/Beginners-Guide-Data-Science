WIERDLY GOOD! I am doubtful about a lot of these odd combos on here, but this was so simple, and it really creates its own flavor that's hard to explain. Especially good with potato chips, I'm on a gluten free diet.

I tried this recipe twice--just to make sure it was as good the second time. Like another reviewer, I left the avocado chunky. Instead of white onion, I used red, and instead of tomato and jalepeno, I used some salsa. The only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is that even with the pits left in, the color turns a bit. Even with that, I like this a lot.

I bought some avocado's at the market an noticed they were getting a little to ripe so iv been searching for some good recipes so I decided to try this one!This was super Healthy and Absolutely Delish! I used one of my 100 calorie rolls and instead of dicing the tomato i just put a nice thick slice on my roll! Wonderful! Yummmm!

I have been looking for healthy options when making meals and at first I thought the combination of avocado and tuna sounded weird, but I went for it anyway. It was AMAZING! The only change I made is that I used 2 avocados instead of 3, and I used fresh pico that you can buy in the produce section which has tomato and onion all chopped up nicely and mixed that in I also used lime juice which gave it a nice flavor and helped it last  when we had it for lunch again the following day. This will be our weekend lunch from now on.

SO good and so versatile! I put mine in romaine lettuce leaves (like boats)  with a side of carrots dipped in hummus.  I ate this for lunch and split with my husband and he loved it.  I also put some Crystals hot sauce on top and it was Fabulous!! I will for sure make this again. Note: One can of tuna and one avocado is 2 servings at 263 calories each serving. I will make this only when my hubby is home for lunch otherwise I will be temped to eat the whole thing.

I love this salad. I first had it when I was in Mexico. I don't think I ever make it the same way ever. I like to add roasted corn, a great way to use up left over corn on the cob. Our bunch always cleans the bowl!

Great healthy lunch you can feel good about, we just put it on wheat crackers. I reduced to two servings but kept the jalapeno, tomatoes at the full amount, since I have an abundance in my garden now. A wee bit of salt and pepper too.

A delicious change of pace for tuna salad.  The avocado added a nice texture and the jalapeño added great flavor.  Served it on pita chips (me)and on rye toast for hubby. We also had pasta salad and corn on the cob.

Very good as written.  I omitted the Jalepeno for one person and she said it was bland.  I'll try to coax her to try the pepper next time since it didn't make it very hot, just warm.

I followed the directions to a “T” which was tasty, however my taste buds desired a bit of spice so the other half of jalapeño was diced and added. Excellent healthy, quick and convenient to make.

Delicious and easy! I modified the recipe a bit based on what I had on hand. I used 1 avocado, 1 5oz can of tuna, 2 Tablespoons of salsa and salt to taste. I prefer my avocado a bit on the chunky side, so I kept it chunkier. I ate it on Tru

Very tasty! Instead of diced white onion I used the fried onions I had on hand (the kind you use in green bean casserole) and it was very good and added a nice crunchy texture.

I am always  looking for new tuna recipes and this one is very good. I used mild green Chiles  instead  of  jalapeños.  This recipe  is very simple  and it's  easy  to cut or make enough  to take to my next pot luck.

Delicious! I wouldn't have expected avocado and tuna to work well together, but they certainly do. I added some garlic powder and lime juice and left out the jalepenos.

This was easy and delicious!  I may never make tuna the old way again!  I recommend lime juice to prevent browning,  and to let it sit in the refrigerator for a bit so that the flavors meld together.  Thank you for this awesome recipe!

I used black pepper because I didn't have and jalapeños.  I used saltine crackers. It was really good & I paired it up with fatfree cottage cheese.

Yummy!

Don't even mash the avocado, just leave it in chunks. This recipe was a guilt-free bowl of awesomeness.
