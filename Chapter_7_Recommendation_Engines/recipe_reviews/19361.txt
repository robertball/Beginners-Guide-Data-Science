This was fantastic!  I did cut down on the dressing ingredients:  used 1/8 cup oil (I prefer sunflower oil), 3 Tbl. vinegar (I prefer rice vinegar), and 3 Tbl. sugar.  I think the dressing in this recipe is missing a key ingredient - the Ramen seasoning packet - be sure and add it to the oil, vinegar, and sugar mixture.  Note that it really makes a difference to toast the almonds and sunflower seeds before adding them.  I like to let the salad sit for a few hours in the refrigerator so that the cabbage wilts a little, the noodles hydrate, and the flavors meld, then I add the almonds and sunflower seeds just before serving.  Thanks for the recipe!

Real yummy recipe - everybody loves it but I do have some variations. Make it easy for yourself & buy the bag of coleslaw already pre-chopped.  It has carrots too which adds some color.  I do not use butter to toast nuts as you don't need it - they have their own natural oils.  But they cook fast, so don't walk away. I used 1/3C oil, 4T vinegar & 3T sugar along w/ 2 seasoning packets from the Ramen noodles. This is a great side dish for a summer BBQ.

I loved this salad, only I made it with the Broccoli Slaw that you can buy pre-shredded, it kept crisper than I think the shredded cabbage would, and tasted even better the next day, I also added the Ramen Noodle seasoning packet with the vinegar/oil mix and used sesame oil because it adds great flavor to any salad.

This is a good one-I use coleslaw mix, chicken flavored ramen noodles, and sesame seeds instead of sunflower seeds.  I toast the sesame seeds, broken noodles and nuts and then add them in right before serving.  I also blend the seasoning packet from the ramen noodles into the dressing mixture for extra flavor.  There's never a bite left-the bowl is always licked clean!

Great quick salad.  A favorite for potlucks.  I use 1/4 cup oil and the creamy chicken Ramen noodle package.

I would use less oil next time.  I also used the seasoning packet included with the noodles to flavor the dressing.  To make this recipe even quicker I will use a packaged cole slaw mix next time.

Tasty, crunchy salad that has good flavor.  I made with green cabbage and purple cabbage as that is what I had on hand.  Thanks Angie for sharing.

used prepacked slaw mix. also put the seasoning packets in the dressing. I didn't use all the oil called for either.. i just add oil as I whisked the other ingredients, stopping to taste.. I can't say how much I did use in the end.   NOTE: the green onions are the KEY in this recipe if you ask me.. I made it the first time w/out any, as i didn't have any and needed to use the pkg'd slaw up fast.. it was ok, but missing that certain zing. Next time, i made sure i had green onions, and that made all the difference!!!    ps- oriental flavored spice packets made the best tasting dressing...

Love this! Saw something similar on tv and thought it would be a nice change.  I used two bags of broccoli slaw mix which really makes it crunchy, and kept the dressing amounts the same.  I did add the ramen spice packets as has been suggested, and a little more rice vinegar than called for.  I also added a little cajun spice and some soy sauce.  Skipped the almonds, but I did toast the sunflower seeds with the dry ramen and some sesame seeds before adding.  The chopped green onions really add to the flavors too.

I only used about half the amount of oil recommended and also added the spice pack from the Ramen noodles. I tasted and added more vinegar and sugar until it tasted just the way I wanted. I wait until serving time to add the almonds, sesame seeds, and Ramen noodles as I like them to be crunchy. It was a hit at a family get together and I will be making it again and again.

I love this salad.  I toasted the broken ramen, almonds and sunflower seeds before adding to the salad.  It doesn't keep very well and becomes soggy so keep the dressing and salad ingredients separate until ready to serve.

This is so good--and so easy! I omitted the almonds and added some diced celery. I used the oriental flavored Ramen and threw the seasoning packet into the dressing too! YUM! A keeper! Thanks Angie

I've been making this salad for years! I do put the seasoning packet in the dressing and I use equal parts oil and vinegar, sometimes 1/4 cup, sometimes 1/3 depending on how much cabbage I have.  A great summer side dish!

This is simple to make and is always a big hit at parties. Someone is always looking for the recipe. Doesn't sound like it would be good, but it's delicious. i usually make it a few hours in advance so the flavors have time to mingle.

Loved it!  And toasting the seeds, etc. was key as others said.  I reserved some of this for the leftovers I anticipated to added on fresh crunchies the next day for a great leftover salad too!

This crunchy, delicious salad was a hit at recent get together with friends.  It was crunchy and provided a variety of texture with made this one great.  The only thing I would change about the recipe is a little less sugar - it was a bit sweet for my taste.  I also used regular white vinegar.  The recipe made a huge amount salad.  If I were going to make it for my family of five I would cut the recipe in half.  Also, the salad doesn't keep well, so only fixing what you think will be eaten and eating it all right away would be best.  Tends to get soggy if left out for an extended period time and doesn't refrigerate well.  Overall this was a great salad.

With or without modifications suggested below, this is a great side salad that gets rave reviews whenever served.  We like to use chinese "chow mein noodles" instead of ramen noodles, but either one is terrific.

I've been looking for this recipe - I don't like to one that uses the seasoning packet in the dressing.  This has a sweeter dressing.  Next time I will use more cabbage.  Very good!
