This is a family favorite that my mom made when I was growing up.  My recipe calls for 1/2 cup powdered sugar in the crust instead of white sugar.  I also bake mine in a 13 x 9 pan and cut in small 1 inch square pieces for almost a "candy" type of taste rather than eating a big bar.  They are wonderful--I have always gotten rave reviews.

*The author forgot to add the lemon to the main part of the squares*. My boyfriend made these for my bday, leaving the lemon out of the squares (it was still in the icing). Even without the lemon in the squares THEY WERE SO DELICIOUS. I almost ate the entire pan myself. Next time we'll add the lemon to the squares and the icing!

I grew up with this recipe.  The lemon glaze is supposed to seep into the second layer.  The author didn't forget to add lemon to the second layer.  I also suggest not adding lemon to the second layer but increasing the amount of lemon juice in the glaze to 6 tsps

Bravo! I have been looking for an old recipie that I used to have but was lost. It was a coconut bar w/ lemon, and I think this was as close to what I used to have as I could find. It is soooo good. The only thing I remember being different was that the egg mixture( the way I used to make it) was a brownish color- so I added a tsp. of vanilla, and instead of a whole cup of sugar, I added half brown and half white for a full cup.
We are having our house worked on, and let me tell you something, food is a wonderul motivator! These bars went fast and they were begging for more- I have made three bathches in the past week! Thank you so much-it is delicious!

Really great! I used butter-flavored Crisco instead of butter for the crust and it came out awesome! I also forgot to put in the coconut, oops (baking with a 21 mth old can do that to you!)and they still tasted super good. I halved the frosting and put it on the squares while they were hot to make more of a glaze, so it wouldn't be too overwhelmingly sweet. Thanks! Will make these again.

I didn't have any coconut, so I left it out. Great recipe. I'd never tasted these before, and i was surprised at how good they were!

The first batch I made didn't turn out to well..too hard..so I made another batch.  I wouldn't say these are the best I've ever had, but I did add more lemon juice as suggested and the glaze was very good.  Something was missing in the crust,though.

These turned out fabulous! I did use 6 tbsp of freshly squeezed lemon juice in the middle part of the recipe. I also increased the flour by 1 tbsp to compensate the extra liquid. Nice and tart and perfect. Next time I will only ice half of the squares, a bit too sweet for my likings! My husband loves the icing though! He has a major sweet tooth.My crust turned out well. A little harder on the edges but that is expected!  Overall a great recipe! I might try and decrease the sugar a bit in the middle next time. Maybe to one cup. I will try!

This recipe was reeeally lemony and good! But very very sweet. Cutting down on sugar might help.

These bars were way too sweet for me and my family. I might try making them again without the icing. I did think that the crust was very good on these bars.

These are very similar to a recipe my mom makes - only she uses less flour and butter in the bottom layer, and no coconut.  Regarding a previous review, the bottom layer isn't supposed to have lemon in it - although, you can tweak the recipe any way you want to.

It didn't turn out how I thought it was going to. I had never made or had lemon squares before this. To me it tasted like they needed a little more sugar and the crust was too thick.

I thought it was really good though next time will skip the icing (even my 7 yr old said it was "too sweet" and we think it was because of the icing).

Excellent recipe.  I've made them many times during citrus season.  Works well with fresh orange juice as well (reduced sugar by 1/4c.) and I've never found the need to make the glaze, they're delicious without it!

This was my first time making lemon squares and thought this recipe was very easy and straight forward. Shortbread base turned out perfect. The only thing I changed was I did not ice it.  Thought it was sweet enough and the icing would be to much.  Could be because I used sweetened coconut (that's all I had on hand).  Will definitely be making this one again.

I really wanted a lemon square that would be tart  but this was so sweet. Almost too sweet I made a really, almost sour and bitter,  frosting to try to make it more do able but it still was too much. I really couldn't enjoy it.
