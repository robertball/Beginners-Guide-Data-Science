A favorite from my youth. My wife likes it a lot now. I doctor it each time I make it. Adding a cup of red wine and a quarter cup of flour adds a nice change in flavor and texture.

I found this recipe in a cookbook when I was married 45 years ago. It has been a staple in our house and my kids loved it. I serve it with cornbread. I usually double the soup water and seasonings.
