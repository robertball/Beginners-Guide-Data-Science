This recipe is quick and easy, and the cookies are very good; however, I wanted CRISP cookies and these were not.  The only change I made to the recipe is that I used butter instead of shortening because I don't cook with shortening anymore.

This recipe was completely scrumptious!!! I added lemon extract to make it extra lemony!! My whole family loved it and it was gone with the hour!! I had to make a second batch that day to satisfy everyone!! I found if you drop them by the tablespoon they're extra soft and yummy!! i also garnished with a little powdered sugar like suggested and they looked great too!!

I tried these as written, and thought they were a little less lemony than I was expecting. Once I glazed them they were fantastic!

These are really good and really soft - my mom (lemon lover) loved them.  Tastes artificial, so don't be expecting that homemade taste.  Really good though.

Delicious lemony flavor!! However, I prefer thicker, chewier cookies and these spread quite thin during baking. I solved this problem by refrigerating the dough and then rolling it into balls. A quick coating of powdered sugar doesn't hurt either!

Nice subtle lemon flavor.  Could ball dough, roll in sugar, and use cookie press for a fancier presentation.

I am one of those people who tell you about the changes I made.  I didn't have lemon pudding, so I used chocolate instead, which made it tasty.  I found that 3/4 teaspoon of baking soda may have been too much.  I could taste it.  It needs some vanilla also to balance out the flavor.  I liked it the way I made it, and would probably try it with lemon pudding when I get some!

Ok, first I have to admit that I messed up making these.  I just realized that I used baking powder instead of baking soda- oops!  Regardless, these turned out to be a pleasant, light cookie.  Definitely not a crispy cookie (though after reading other reviews I think that has more to do with the name being a misnomer than my baking error.  If I were to make these again I would most likely add some lemon flavoring to up the tartness.  You could also substitute pretty much any flavor of pudding for the lemon and have a nice cookie.

Grate the peel of one lemon, being careful not to grate the bitter white part under the rind. Add it after adding the eggs, before adding the flour. This adds to the depth of lemon flavor.

These get five stars for texture, but two stars for flavor.  So they get a three star.  I couldn't taste any lemon at all, so I put on some lemon icing and that helped a little.

Amazing! Family loved it. I only had 1 packet of pudding, so I divided the recipe.  However, forgot to halve the sugar! Still amazing! Thank you for this favorite!

My family loves this recipe. I did make a few changes by using butter, lemon juice and lemon extract. I also rolled them in confection sugar. I also cooked them on 350 for 10 minutes.

Only change I made was to use coconut oil for 1/2 cup of the shortening... turned out really well... and wonderfully fast and easy!
