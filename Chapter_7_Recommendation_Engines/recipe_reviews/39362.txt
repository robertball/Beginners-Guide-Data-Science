Don't let the idea of pumpkin and jalapenos turn you off. I took this to a party and was afraid it would be awful, I figured if it was no good I'd just throw it away, but everyone loved it!! Everyone was so surprised to hear it had pumpkin in it. I added a little extra jalapenos and left out the olives, and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Try it, it's great!

I took this to a work halloween party, figured try it out on them first, well have to tell ya the dip went fast.... everyone loved it, i wasn't sure because of the pumpkins, but they loved it, i kicked it up with a little more j. peppers then the recipe called for,(and i didn't add the onion, only because i don't care for onion), but certainly didn't need it,.... very good, nice change from traditional mexican layered dips.......

I made this simple recipe at a dinner party for 6, with two well-known picky eaters.  Everyone LOVED it!  Don't tell them it's pumpkin until after they fall in love - the jalapenos are also not too hot or spicy - JUST RIGHT!

I added taco seasoning to the sour cream and layered fresh homemade salsa in place of the chopped tomatoes and green onions.  It was a hit!

This was excellent! I made it for my family before putting it on my Superbowl menu. The jalapenos make the dish. For kids, I will use half the jalapeno juice. THe next day there was a puddle of juice in the dish, I just drained it.  I love pumpkin!  I have another great way to use it. Thanks, Ortega!

I hated this, my sister loved this, everyone else thought it was just so-so.  This was served to a party of 12 people.
