Very good flavor, but be careful that you don't use lemons that are too big or it will be a little sour.  Don't add the lemon juice until the very end as it turns the beans a little brownish.

This is a wonderful side dish, especially with summery fare!  One night I swapped the lemon and walnuts for lime and almonds, another night I used lemon with pine nuts! This recipe is a great jumping off point to create your own variations!

Very good. I didn't use as much lemon juice & zest and I drizzled honey over walnuts before roasting. Served with salmon.

Before adding Lemon Juice taste it for tartness.  The juice absorbs into the bean and can easily become to strong.  It may help to increase butter amount, melt and add lemon before tossing together.  Definitely like roasted walnuts adds great flavor.

Tried these for Thanksgiving.  Favorable reviews all around except use caution with the lemon.  I only used 1/2 the lemon and zest for a pound of beans and it was more than enough.  Also subbed pecans since that's what we used in the stuffing.

Easy, with uncomplicated ingredients.  I will make again when craving a slightly different twist, yet I prefer the garlicy/almond combo better.

We loved the flavors.  I used 1/4 cup walnuts to lower the calories/fat and that was plenty.  Also used light butter (2 Tbsp), all the zest and 1 Tbsp juice from a medium lemon.  It had a subtle but definite lemon flavor.  Just right.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I wasn't thrilled with this.  Needs seasoning beyond the lemon juice which was a little overkill to me in the first place.  And I could do without the walnuts.

This recipe was indeed easy and delicious!  I was using the oven for other things, so I toasted the walnuts in the microwave using my mom's method- put the nuts and about a tbsp of butter in a bowl.  Microwave on high for 1 minute.  Stir.  Cook in 30 second intervals, stirring in between.  As they start to get toasted at all, I take the intervals down to about 15 seconds, since they can burn quickly.  I loved this recipe and will definitely use again!

Delicious! Used salted butter instead of unsalted and then didn't add any salt. The lemon flavor of these is strong and refreshing. Thanks for the recipe:)

Delicious! I even forgot to add the lemon zest, which I think would only improve this recipe even more. The walnuts add a delicious crunch.

These are pretty good.  I had a big lemon, so I only used the zest and juice of 1/2 of it.  It was still a little too tart for my taste.  Maybe adding some sugar would help.  My favorite part was definitely the walnuts.

Well, I can say this was very different for me and my family. I made to a T. It had a nice lemon taste to it. It's light and a "summer" dish for sure. It wasn't a WOW dish for my family. But it wasn't bad either. It was ok though for us. One child doesn't like green beans, so he nibble on one piece and said, nope not for him. But my other children ate the beans and said it was good. Thanks.

These were excellent!!!! My fiance even enjoyed them, and he doesn't like green beans. If you don't like lemon, though, this isn't the recipe for you. At the suggestion of others, I only added about a half of the lemon zest, but these green beans were fantastic!

I had just used the last of the walnuts so I substituted pecans.  Bad mistake!  Pecans toast very quickly so I burnt them and to make it worse, I added them anyway.  But even in spite of that the lemons and lemon zest added such a good flavor that I figure that it rates a five stars.

This wasn't the best green bean recipe I've ever tried.  I think it was the walnuts combined with lemon juice that wasn't quite tasting right.  Next time, I'll try almonds instead.

We really liked this. I cut it in half since there are only 2 of us,
used Trader Joes frozen beans and microwaved them. Probably only used half as much zest, but all the juice. I love lemon and my husband liked it too. I'll make this again.

This dish tasted pretty good with a nice bright flavor. The only problem was the amount of butter- I didn't think it needed that much since I don't like my food drowning in butter.  I just added one tbs. butter and I thought it was plenty.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This one did not do it.  I am still searching for a 'great' green bean recipe that is tasty, unique...anything other than same old bland green beans.  Any suggestions?

This is an awesome vegetable recipe.  No doubt, I will use it again and again.  Next time I will reduce the lemon juice substantially.  The toasted walnuts are an absolutely great ingredient.  I served this with Mama's Dormant Chicken, available here at allrecipes.  Spectacular!!!

way too much lemon!  The walnuts are nice, but I'd cut the lemon juice to about 1/4 or 1/8 if i ever make it again.  This didn't go over well at all.

This is a very fresh and tasy side.  It was a bit too lemony for us.  I will make again using less lemon and may even try slivered almonds instead of walnuts.

When I prepare a new recipe for company, I tend to judge the recipes based on the "WOW" factor.  If my guests rave about a dish, asking for the recipe, etc., then that gets a 5.  This one just didn't get that reaction.  Don't get me wrong, it tasted OK and was easy to make.  It was just didn't get the reaction I was hoping for.

This was an easy side dish, I loved the lemon flavor with green beans. Before roasting the walnuts I melted some honey and quickly dipped the walnuts. It really added some more flavor to them.

I liked this recipe because it was something different to do with green beans. It was my first time steaming veggies and the taste was excellent. I didn't have fresh lemon juice or zest, so I just used the bottle kind and it still turned out well. I used pecans, because that's what I had on hand. I would make this again.

I made this recipe for company & there was very little left over.  Everyone liked the combination of lemon & walnuts.  I only used the juice of half a lemon for fear it would be too lemony with the juice of a whole lemon & thought half was enough.  This is not my favorite recipe for green beans, but I will probably make it again for a change of pace.

I subbed lemon juice & lemon pepper for the lemon, salt, & pepper & we just didn't find them very good. It may be because the frozen green beans we tried end up practically falling apart (cooked those according to the directions on the bag).   Will try again, as directed to see if that changes things.

I made this recipe tonite with green beans from our garden, pecans, lime juice and it was delicious.  I don't like to try a recipe the first time and change the ingredients but this recipe is the type that can be adjust and maintain the flavor.  My husband says it is a 5 star recipe!

Pretty tasty. I used almonds instead of walnuts because that was what I had, but I think it went with the recipe better than walnuts would have. I just guessed at all the quantities based on the amount of green beans I had (it was less than a pound) and it still came out tasty.

Elegant and easy.  I used this recipe for Easter dinner.  I pre-cooked the green beans and just heated up the mixture before serving.  Adults loved it.  6 year old commented that there was too much lemon while rapidly shoving green beans in her mouth ! Go figure !

Wow, what a wonderful combination of lemon and walnuts.  Kids loved the crunch.  I felt like a gourmet cook. This is a side dish that I will certainly add to my "company's coming" list of meals.  Thank-you.

I thought this was excellent.  Coming from a southerner who tends to cook their green beans to death, it was great tasted fresh with a bright crunch.  Will definitely make again.

We like lemon, but found the lemon flavor in these to be a bit too strong.  Next time I would cut the lemon zest and juice in half (or I would use a smaller lemon!)

4.21.18  Microwaved the green beans for 2 mins and 40 seconds, and they were perfectly cooked.  The lemon flavor comes through nicely and brightens the flavor.  Super quick and easy recipe and definitely would make again.

Excellent as is.  Also pretty fab with half the butter and no walnuts (I forget sometimes).

I made this.  The only change I made was using frozen beans and omitted the butter.  It was excellent.

These went over well with 3 of my 5 kids. The other two don't like veggies in general, so still giving them 5 stars.  Will definitely be adding these to the dinner rotation.

Really good, but you need to be careful with the walnuts.  I toasted mine too long and they were a little burnt.

I made these green beans to serve with our Easter dinner and everyone raved about them...they were absolutely delicious.  We didn't use as much of the lemon (juice or zest) or walnuts that the recipe called for, but the end result was just delicious!

I had to use canned green beans and this was still sooo tasty. I loved the combination of the lemon and walnuts with the beans. Thanks, I'll be making this often.

Made this for Easter dinner, but substituted asparagus and pecans as someone suggested.  My family raved about it.  Thank you for a great recipe!

These were good, but I think too much lemon.  If your lemon is very juicy, add sparingly to taste.  I like the toasted walnuts on top.  They were all eaten up at Easter dinner!

Fool proof. Great. Made for first time for a cover dish gathering and there were several other bean dishes there but only mine was all gone. Had many compliments and requests for the recipe. What a hit.

Very easy to make and simply delicious.  I made it for a dinner with friends and all loved it.  It was a bit on the lemony side but that's what would make it nice spring or summer dish.

My Husband & I LOVED these - but you have to love lemon to love 'em.  I think some people hated them because they are a strong flavor but it was such a refreshing change from the everyday.  I even saved the leftovers and a quick zap and they were good the next day too.

This was good and easy to prepare.  I did not cook for the whole 8 minutes, I like my vegetables a little on the crispy side and I omitted the walnuts.  Will definitely make this again.
