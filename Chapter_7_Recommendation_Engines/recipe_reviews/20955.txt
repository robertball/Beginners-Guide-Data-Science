c'mon now, this dish is easy and just needs a little tweaking...i used half and half instead of the water, added 3/4 cup grated sharp cheddar cheese, a few bacon bits and for a quick side dish it wasn't too bad.

I thought these were delicious for boxed potatos- The rest of my guys..not so much; Hence mid grade review.  If your family like plain jane potatos- this won't be for them.

I had to make a couple substitutions - I used onion powder instead of minced (my kids can detect the smallest onion piece) and I discovered that I didn't have the french fried onions, so I topped it with sliced Monteray Jack cheese. It worked out GREAT! all kids loved it and said they want it again. Leftovers for lunch today were yummy, too. I can't wait to try it with the cheddar fried onions next time! Oh, I used evaporated milk, too.

Using garlic flavored instant mashed potato instead of plain potato flakes seemed to add the right flavor kick for my family.

:-) double yum! 

my husband compared it to some mashed potatoes from the cheesecake factory - which he referred to as the best potatoes he had ever had -- 

now these are his favorite - and mine, too.

Pretty basic recipe...you do need to add for flavor.  I used  fresh mozzarella and the half and half instead of the milk.  Good and easy...thanks for the post.

Great way to jazz up otherwise boring, lifeless box potatoes. What I like about this recipe is that you can adjust the seasonings to your own personal taste! Some people's bland is another's tasty! I didn't have canned fried onions so I quickly made my own. Served with the Easy Deviled Chicken from this site. Thanks for saving me the time of making homemade potatoes!

This is a great recipe when you want to fancy up plain old mashed potatoes...Also a great recipe for tweaking depending on what is in your recipe!

I started with leftover "skinny" mashed potatoes.  I added an egg and because I didn't have cream cheese on hand I added shredded Monterey Jack Cheese.  Great starter recipe.

My boyfriend wanted to write Allrecipes and try to get you 6 stars, Collin!  We loved this.  It was super easy, got rid of my can of fried onions, and had plenty of flavor.  I snipped some green onions of top for color.  It's perfect as is!

Pretty amazing for instant potatoes!  Like another reviewer, I suggest using either onion powder or making sure your onions are very finely minced.  If you don't like the onion flavor, you may want to try garlic.  These potatoes would also be good without the onions altogether -- you could even add different spices/herbs.

I modified this recipe a bit. Used a package of instant potatoes from Costco and used skim milk, butter and heavy cream as well as sour cream, salt, pepper, fresh garlic etc. Kept adding this and that until I got it the way that I wanted. Merely topped the potatoes with the french fried onions. The leftovers are going in the oven with some cheese and more of the FF onions. Overall, I was pretty happy with this recipe because it was something different.

Deeeeelish! I made this for Christmas dinner and then again tonight....everyone LOVES it! It's really good. Only change is that I didn't use all the milk. I judged it based on how creamy I wanted my potatoes. Excellent!
