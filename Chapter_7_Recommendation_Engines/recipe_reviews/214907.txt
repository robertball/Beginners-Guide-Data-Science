I liked this a lot, I did not however strain it, I i really pureed the mess out of it. My melon was very sweet, so i cut back the sugar a bit. Combined with a nice spiced rum this also made a lovely adult beverage :)

This is light, refreshing and very simple to prepare.  I did strain my watermelon through a fine mesh sieve.  I mixed the lemonade mix and watermelon together in a pitcher and just poured over ice.  The only change I made was to adjust the sugar to our liking.  I will make this again.  Thanks for sharing:)

I made two batches of this at once, one with artificial sugar and one with regular sugar, and both turned out amazing! This is definitely going to become a summer drink we'll use again and again.

I assembled this right before a party.  I was horrified at how sickeningly sweet it was.  I even cut down the sugar as per other reviews.  I added a lemon club soda to it and it saved the day.  I think I doubled the liquid with the amount of club soda.  It turned out really nice once this was added.  I will have to figure out just how much sugar is necessary.  ?Maybe on a previous review?  As of right now, I would cut the sugar by 2/3rds and see how it went.

THIS IS SO GOOD!!! I like this better than plain lemonade... a lovely combination of sweet and sour, like a Warhead candy.  I had simple syrup on hand, and I only used 1/3 cup... I believe this would have been less sugar than the recipe called for. I blended the watermelon and lemon juice together - did not strain - I like my lemonade pulpy. Thanks for the great recipe, Docswife!

Too much work for the end result. Eating the watermelon along side a glass of cold lemonade would have been just as refreshing.

Nice recipe.  I needed more tartness, so I added the juice of one more lemon to the simple syrup recipe and added a handful of strawberries to the watermelon puree.  Very refreshing.  Took it a step further and added  1 1/4 oz of vodka.  Shake, pour over ice and you have an excellent summer cocktail.

One of the things that I like about this recipe as opposed to a "watermelon slush," is that you don't have to consume it all at once.  I had some left over, so I just stored the puree and the lemonade separately, so this could be enjoyed later, as well.  My melon was very sweet, and after mixing the first glass, I did add more lemon juice to achieve the "lemonade" flavor that we like (but that likely could be just a taste preference).  It's in the 90's now, and this was enjoyed immensely after doing yard work in the hot sun.  And for those of us watching our diet, this is a great refreshing summer drink.

This is a great foundational recipe, but I increased the lemon juice and used agave nectar and honey instead of white sugar (just because I don't like white sugar). I also did not strain the watermelon, because I didn't really see the need.

With a few tweaks, it was great! Thanks for the idea.

I don't know if everyone has dole products at their local grocery stores, but dole makes a watermelon juice.  I made the lemonade exactly they way the recipe stated and just added the watermelon juice straight from the carton..... Excellent!!!!!
We made a double recipe for the fourth of July and it was gone by the time we were done with our fireworks :) A delicious drink my whole family loved! Thanks for sharing it!

We enjoyed this but not nearly enough to crave more.  Lemonade is awesome good, of course, and the first time we had Watermelon Agua Fresca we were both simply blown away by how good it was.  While this was indeed refreshing, it seems something was lacking, diminished perhaps, by combining the two - maybe not a prominent enough flavor of either the watermelon or the lemonade.

I like it! Nice way to use up the watermelon and have a different beverage! Cool! Thanks

I did not strain the watermelon. I just blended really well and give a mix with wooden spoon before serving.

I began with a seedless watermelon and simply pureed the watermelon completely so I didn't need to strain it.  I also added more lemon juice because I like my lemonade on the tart side.

I will definitely be making this one again!

Great if you love watermelon. My husband LOVED the flavor, though I found it a bit too "watermelon-y" for my liking. Add the elements to the glass separately instead of mixing into one big pitcher like we did, that way you can better control the watermelon flavor! Still in all, an awesome recipe!

This drink was good! I would only give it four stars though... THIS DRINK IS VERY REFRESHING, but if you wanted it to have a bursting taste of watermelon, I say double the watermelon and maybe even the sugar and the lemons... ;) IDK! Just trying to help!

Such a great idea! I don't have a blender, so I gave the watermelon a rough chop, then put it in a large bowl and used a potato masher to get the juice out. I then strained it through a sieve, using the back of a spoon to make sure I got all the juice out. My only problem with the recipe is that the lemon juice got completely masked by the watermelon flavour; there was just no tang! I added another lemon's worth of juice to the mix, which seemed to help.

My friend makes a similar recipe, only the adult kind, and she doesn't add any sugar. She freezes the watermelon beforehand, which makes it nice and cold, and then blends it with lemonade and vodka in the blender. It's really easy and a little quicker than this one, even though I'm sure it tastes great too.

I made this for the first time over the weekend, it came out AMAZING! I didn't think it was to sweet as some users did, but I do like lemon-aid a bit sweet instead of tart. I also used organic raw sugar, so I don't know if that had something to do with it. HOWEVER...Today, I made it again, I was running low on lemons, so I peeled the lemons, de-seeded them & put the entire lemon in with the watermelon AND I added 12 strawberries. This drink came out even more fantastic then the first time I made it. I also did NOT strain the pure mixture, I just blended it on HIGH for 3 minutes, I did not feel it needed to be strained. Thank you for an AMAZING recipe! This well be the new family favorite! (I had a really bad day the other day and felt as though I could use an "adult" beverage, so I added a little Pineapple Malibu Rum to it and it was a perfect compliment)

Easy to make and is delicious!  I mixed the pureed watermelon with the syrup after it cooled.  Put this into pitcher and refrigerated it before serving.

Amazing!!! I'm the person in my house that doesn't like watermelon and this stuff is so good. I used over ripe watermelon (the kind that's almost powdery in texture) just to get rid of it and I'm amazed how much I'm in love with this drink. I'll definitely be doubling the recipe next time and using fresh cut melon!

I brought this to a bbq as a change from all the sodas and beer.  Yes, it's a bit of work (especially since my fine sieve is very small! LOL), but I think it was worth it.  I simply brought it "as is" and some vodka like Docswife suggested--the children could enjoy it, and the adults could add a little "something extra" if they wanted to.  I ended up bringing home an empty pitcher!

Ok, so I goofed when i made it the first time and didn't add the 3 cups of water, and I added the 1/2 of water and sugar to the blender, I did not make a simple syrup.  These were not adjustments lol, just me running back and forth from the computer to the kitchen to do the recipe.  I would like to say, its very foolproof, even with those two goof-ups, this is an excellent recipe. I had come in from way too much gardening and sat down with a big pitcher of this mix, and then napped tehehe.   Thanks for a fantastic recipe, I will make sure to actually follow the directions properly next time.

Awesomely refreshing summer drink! I found this in a magazine and have made it a few times now.  Great way to use up some of that extra watermelon.  (There always sends to be too much!)  When I don't have lemons on hand,I sub it for lemonade crystal light or whatever brand we have on hand and reduce or omit the sugar.  Frozen lemonade concentrate would be great too, but I'd recommend adding a few extra cups of water.  Put this in the freezer for a few hours until it gets slushy, delish!

Refreshing on a summer day. I read the reviews and decided to cut down the sugar and skip making the syrup. I just pureed the watermelon and mixed it with everything else, then chilled.

Wonderful!!!!  Even the people that thought it didn't sound good LOVED it!  Instead of making the syrup I deseeded & then pureed the watermellon, then added it straight. Checking the sweetness of the watermellon is a must. If it sets overnight you need to remember to stir because it will seperate. We also tried this with fresh peaches and that was a great twist too!

Simple way to use up extra watermelon.  I used a little less sugar than the 1/2 cup and it was wonderful.

I added seltzer water to give it a bit of fizz 4 star is not because its not a good recipe, I added something that made it better for me. Also Sprite or 7-up if you like fizzy drink.

Good stuff. Frozen watermelon cubes or very cold watermelon cubes adds a more intense chill to this drink.  This is easy to do and kid friendly. My daughter and I made this at home and liked it alot.

Was too sweet, but great concept to use watermelon juice, did the vodka was a huge hit. Less sugar and more lemon would have made it a five star, but I realize that is just personal taste, and how sweet your watermelon is would impact it also.

We had a mediocre watermelon that no one was eating. We made this drink with it, and also threw in two overripe mangoes. The final result was refreshing and tasty - if we had used a good watermelon, it would have been ever better.

I used less cold water as I felt it would have watered down the flavors.  Guess it depends on your watermelon.  Same with the amount of sugar you need.  To make it easier, I put the strained watermelon juice right in with the rest of the mix and stirred it in a pitcher.  A great way to use up a surplus of watermelon!  Hubby thought it was really good!

It is hard to make this if you want to make like a whole gallon of it, because this tells you to put it into individual cups. But other than that it’s great!

This was tasty and, in my opinion, the recipe has the perfect amount of sugar. I initially cut the sugar b/c of reviewers saying it was too sweet. But that version was not sweet enough, so in the end I added the rest of the sugar.

the one change i made which was IMPORTANT, i only added 1/2-3/4 c cold water not the (3) cups suggested.  it would have been very diluted.  also i offered cold gin or vodka on the side for anyone wanting to spike their beverage.  it was really really good!

I had quite a few guests over so I did 1.5X more than the original recipe and decided to use 2 cans of lemonade frozen concentrate and 1 can on limeade frozen concentrate which made it better in my opinion!

I now have CRAVINGS for this, yum!!! Unfortunately the recipe doesn't make much, so I tripled the recipe this time. Add a little Tajin for a spicy kick!!! A little tedious to juice the lemons; otherwise it's a simple recipe. LOVE LOVE
