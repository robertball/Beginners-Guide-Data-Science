This was not a winner when I first made it but I knew it could be redeemed with a little tweaking. Here are the changes I made to make it a winner: 1) Slice chicken breasts into 1 inch strips, sear in 1 stick of butter until just browned. Put half of the rice mixture on the bottom of the crockpot.  Pour chicken / butter mixture into crock pot. Put about 3/4 c. shredded parmesan on top. Pour the rest of the over the rice / soup mixture on top. Cook on LOW for about 3 hours but no more or the chicken will dry out. High should not be used at all.

Well I was kinda nervous making this, with some of the mixed reviews I read, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  I omitted the rice altogether, as we're not big rice fans.  I also used an Onion/Mushroom dry soup mix.  I only had three fat boneless, skinless chicken breasts, but didn't alter the amount of liquid.  I sprayed my crock pot dish with Pam.  Put a pat of butter on each breast, poured the soup mixture on top of that and lotsa parmesan on top of that and turned it on Low for about 8-9 hours.  De-Lish-Us.  Made up some egg noodles and green peas and a salad and scarfed it all up.  This one went into my recipe book.

I was so excited to make a chicken crock pot recipe with these ingredients that SHOULD HAVE tasted wonderful.  What a disapointment it didn't turn out as I had hoped.  The rice turned to mush and the parmasean burned in the pot (cooked on low for 8 hours) plus it was WAY TOO SALTY.  The chicken on the other hand was absolutely WONDERFUL!  If (and I mean if) I make this again, I'll do it with 1/2 the onion soup mix and more milk in the soup.  Leave out the rice and cook seperately then serve your mixture on top or on noodles.  Proceed with caution if you make this recipe and be prepared for a mixed result!

I found this recipe to be great and I have made it many times.  I read a few negative reviews, lots of which saying that it's too salty.  My answer to that is not to use canned chicken broth.  Instead, try using homemade chicken stock (Chicken carcass, carrots, celery, onions, cold water, thyme, rosemary, sage and simmered for 3 or 4 hours then strained.).  Also, as someone commented, NEVER cook on high, always on low heat and for about 6 hours and the chicken turns out really tender and the rice is just right.  I really loved this one.  :)

I reiterate the EASINESS in this recipe!! I just got a new crock pot for mother's day and this was the first recipe I wanted to try...what a treat!! It turned out wonderfully! Not only would I recommend, but I will make again. It's so nice to whip something together, throw it in the crock pot and not worry until later. However, just a note, I cooked mine on "high" setting and my meal was done in 3 hours oppossed to the 4-6 hours the recipe recommends.  Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe!

Yeah, I agree, this recipe is not very appealing to look at. Better off just putting your chicken, onion soup mix and a couple of cans of the soup in the crock pot. You'll get a nice gravy which you can then serve OVER rice.

This was good, but I was glad that I was home all day.  Even with following the recipe amounts I had to stir it several times during the cooking to make sure that everything mixed together well.  Don't get me wrong the chicken was very moist and tender and the rice cooked very well.  I will definately make this again.  I did add some asiago cheese for more of a cheesy taste.  I will make this again.  Thanks.

This is SO EASY and is a hugh hit with our family!  I love to make this very easy recipe and just throw all of the ingredients in the crockpot and wait for it to cook.  I'm a vegetarian so it is great when you need to make a couple of meals at a time because it is so simple and fast and everyone I've ever made it for just loves it!!

Made in the crock pot on low.  Used homemade onion soup mix (from this site) so "I" can control the salt.  Made brown rice separately so it wasn't mushy.  Did not need to use any butter.  Very easy and very in-expensive to make.  A keeper for sure.

Very good, reliable crock pot dinner. I normally hate chicken in the crock pot, bc it's usually very dry and never has a great flavor.  This recipe has a great parmesan flavor.  The chicken was really moist and although the rice was a tad too mushy, the flavor made up for it. Based on other reviews, I made some of my own changes that worked out pretty well- I used 4 chicken breasts and only about 4 tbsp. of butter. I also mixed the "sauce" without adding the rice to it, and poured half over the chicken, sprinkling the top with a little grated parm. I mixed the rice with the remaining amount of sauce and set aside. I put the timer on for 2 hours (cooking on low), and then added the sauce/rice mixture & cooked for another 2 hours on low. I also reserved 1/4 cup fresh shredded parm to sprinkle on top for the last 2 hours.  I would recommend not adding the rice until the last hour or half hour... I think it would be perfectly cooked that way and still taste good.  Overall, though, an excellent, easy dinner.  Oh, and I just used whatever long grain rice I had in the cabinet and it worked out fine.

Although this recipe had mixed reviews, I decided to try it anyway.  Mia Copa!  If our country believed in capital punishment for truly bad recipes, the creator of this one would have been executed!!  Absolutely FOUL!!!!!

After reading other reviews, made with half a packet of the soup mix and cooked on low for 4 hr, 30 min... ate 30 min later.  My husband, 3 yr old and 21 month old all loved it.  YEA! Finally something we will all eat!

While I haven't tried this particular approach yet, I have, over the years made this same recipe in the oven.  One of the single most important factors in having this dish come out well is not to let your moisture escape, either by lifting the lid of your crock, or lifting the foil in the oven. Often times, it interferes with the absorbency of the rice but also altering the heat factor. I found that warming the liquids made a big difference, but also the slower cooking time on low.  I can't wait to try this in the crock!

Very yummy and tasty - even my chicken hating husband gobbled it up.  Only change was to add garlic powder and celery salt, omitted the rice and served with creamy mashed potato!!

I didn't mix the rice with the soup-instead I put the rice in the bottom of the crockpot, chicken on top covered with soup. I took the advice of others and cooked the chiken for 5 hours. It turned out very tasty.

I'm new to Allrecipes and this was the first recipe that I tried.  I have to say I was very pleased.  I'm new to crockpot cooking, and this was perfect. I made one change I didn't have the onion soup mix, so I put 1/4 cup of chopped fine onions, & some garlic powder instead. I have emailed this recipe to quite a few of my friends.  Loved it!

Based on other's reviews, I left out rice too --made separately.  Only used one can mushroom soup and 1/2 the amount of milk, and used only 4 chicken breasts.  broth is so tasty --great on rice and chicken (which gets kind of dry, as most chicken breasts do in slow cooker).  2nd time I made this, I forgot butter and it did not take away anything.  Sooo easy and very good!

This is so good.....I can't get enough.  It's almost like a risotto, super creamy and the flavour of the fresh grated parmesan is incredible.  I didn't put all the butter they ask for, it's not needed in my opinion.  I've made it twice now....and it's going to be a keeper!!

My husband and I loved this recipe, but you can't cook it longer than 5 hours on low otherwise it will burn or be mushy. I didn't add the butter and I couldn't tell any difference. I also used low sodium, lowfat soups and skim milk..still no taste difference. I used a crock pot liner which helped tremendously with cleanup. The chicken was super tender, the rice was perfect and the flavor was better than traditional chicken and rice due to the parmesan. 2 thumbs up!

This was really boring even after adding seasoning the chicken with onion and garlic powder.  I also added salt, pepper, and parmesan cheese and it was still boring.  We put a little ketchup on it just to add flavor.

Very quick and easy meal that I was able to put together with on hand ingredients.  The only change I made was to only use 1/2 pack of onion soup mix after reading all the reviews about the dish being salty, also only used about 1 1/4 cup of milk because that was all I had and 4 chicken breasts. I cooked it on high for just over 5 hours and the rice was perfect.  My picky kids cleaned their plates.

Love this recipe!!! I omit the rice, add sliced mushrooms and chopped onions and put at least double the parmesan on top. After it is cooked I break up the breasts a bit into smaller pieces. We eat it on egg noodles or mashed potatoes. The family Gobbles it up!

This was so easy to make and it was so good! I left out the six TBS. of butter it did not need it thats just added fat. I just added a near east rice pilaf mix instead of one cup long grain rice. The rice was not mushy at all. I cooked it for 4 hours on high. It was perfect.

I actually didn't cook this in the slow cooker.  I put everything (except the butter) in a 13x9 pan, covered it with foil and baked it for 45 minutes in a 350 oven.  I took the foil off and cooked it 15 more minutes.  It was really good.  We will have this again.  Oh, and I used minute rice instead of the other.

This is a REALLY, REALLY good recipe.  The rice is a little mushy, but that is easily solved by cooking it seperately.  Very flavorful and filling.  Has and will be repeated in our home.  No leftovers at all!

I followed a couple of the reviews and pieces of the recipe.  WOW is it amazing so easy and fast too.  My husband is very picky and he actually asked for this. I have made it at least every other week.  THANKS FOR THE AWESOME RECIPE!

Everyone loved it. used one large can of soup which is just a little more than this recipe calls for, threw everything in the crockpot and cooked on high for four hrs. parmesan should be monitored for mine did burn a little on just one side.---- I have made this a few times now and like it a lot for a simple crock pot recipe. Don't add the extra salt, add parmesan at the end just enough time for it to melt and add a tad more liquid or soup. Adding mushrooms or frozen broccoli is nice.

Not bad with some additions.  Sprayed the crock with Pam.  I put garlic powder, black pepper, and some dried mixed sweet pepper flake directly on the chicken.  Sprinkled the onion soup mix on top of that, added brown rice, mixed the mushroom soup and milk together and poured on top.  Cooked on low for about 7 hours.  Shortly before serving I stirred in 8 oz of sour cream.  I did not add the parmesan to the pot, but rather topped the dish with the cheese on the serving plates.

I followed this recipe almost exactly. I put in frozen chicken breasts and didn't have fresh parmesan cheese, so used the shaker style parmesan.  I cooked this on high and it was done in 2.5 hours!  If I'd cooked it any longer, the chicken would have dried out. My husband really enjoyed it. I have added this to my recipe box -- it was super easy! Thanks!

This is the same recipe my grandmother showed me how to make 30 years ago. only if you don't cqare for rice you can make it in fifteen minuts on the stove top. just cut the chicken into cubes, cook in two tablespoons of oil until done, add a can of mushrooms, your same soup mix cook about five minutes on high, top with the cheese of your choice.

After reading countless reviews, I decided to stick with the original just to see how my family would rate this.  I used regular white rice and cream of chicken soup because that's what I had on hand.  My picky dh and dk's (15, 13, 5) gobbled it up!  The only criticism I would have is that there was not enough rice to cover for the starch course of the meal for the teenagers.  We'll definitely be making this again!

I love this recipe.  My husband is really picky and he even loves it.  It is not a fancy meal or anything and it does tend to come out a little bit mushy, but we don't mind that!  The taste is great and it is so simple to make!  It is definitely something I make on a regular basis!

I made this for dinner last night and have to agree with a few others. The appearance was terrible. While the taste was not bad I found the smell very unpleasant. My hubby asked that I not make this again and my daughter would not even try it.

I did what 1 reviewer suggested and put the rice on bottom, chicken breasts and then the sauce. The rice was still too gooey. I would make again because the sauce and chicken were good but I would serve over rice that is cooked seprately. I also added chicken broth in place of 2nd soup.

This dish cooked very quickly! 4.5 hours on LOW. I used breast strips (didn't realize they were strips when I bought the meat), and couldn't find "converted" rice, so I made that separately. I also used more butter than the recipe calls for. This was very salty, though. Next time, I will use low-sodium cream of mushroom and 1/2 the onion soup mix. Cooking the rice with the rest of the dish probably helps to absorb some of that salt. However, this was very filling, and I think I'm going to end up freezing some of it for an easy dinner next week!

I really think this needs to be made without the rice. As the rice absorbs the liquid, it dries out the chicken. The flavor is very good. Just don't cook it on high or for more than 6 hours. I served mine with mashed potatoes.

This was so simple and delicious.    However, I did not cook the rice with the chicken.    The last time I did that the rice was rather mushy.   So, I cooked the rice separate.   The gravy was a bit thin so I took out the chicken pieces, scooped up some of the gravy, added a tablespoon full of flour, stirred it up and then put it back in the pot.    Once I mixed it in the pot I then put the chicken pieces back and cooked it another 20 minutes or so.   Absolutely delicious.   I like this gravy so well that I think it will go with lots of stuff - pasta - pork chops, etc,

I'm not sure what to rate this recipe because we haven't eaten it yet.  I just went to check on it after 6 hours of cooking on low and it's completely overdone already!  A little stir of the pot shredded the chicken and turned the rice to the consistence of stuffing.  I don't know what to do since dinner is not for another 2 hours.  It might be the fault of the cockpot – it’s brand new but it only had 4 setting so perhaps the low is not low enough.  This dish does seem to taste ok  - hope it’s not too dried out by dinnertime!

Will make again - but need to spice it up a bit.  Will follow another reviewer's example and try some garlic or maybe even adobo.  And for all the reviewers who said the rice was mushy - you can ONLY cook it for the shortest alloted time at either temp - came out perfect that way.

Followed this recipe exactly and it came out very good.  Due to circumstances beyond my control....this dish was cooked for 9 hours on low in a 5.5 quart crockpot... this I believe is why the chicken breasts fell apart when served.  Next time I would cut the cooking time to 4 - 5 hours on low.  The appearance is DEFINATELY not it's strong point....but what crockpot recipe turns out beautiful????  The cheese made a nice flavorful crust on the top.  I lightly greased the crock with butter before hand and also put a tablespoon of butter on each breast as per the recipe.  There was a bit of butter that separated from the rice/soup mixture...so I think next time I would cut down on the amount of butter overall.  I will make it again very easy and sticks to your ribs!

This was very tasty however the appearance was not very good.  If I did this again I would take the advice of the reviewer that suggested cooking the rice after and pooring the chicken and soup mixture on top of the rice.

Thanks for the easy recipe.  It is so hard to make healthy meals for your family that actually taste good when both parents work.  I will adjust the amount of onion soup mix and salt next time as it was a little salty.  I will make this again.

I tried this recipe last night and the family liked it. I wish I'd have read the reviews first because it really needs less time or it will come out pasty and mushy. I plan on trying it for a church pot luck later this month.

DO NOT COOK THIS RECIPE WITHOUT RICE in the crockpot.  It turns out WAY too salty.  I thought I'd try to serve it over rice after it was done cooking.

I tried this recipe several years ago, and can't count how many times I have made it! While it doesn't look appealing, it is one of the most delcious dishes I have ever had. This was a favorite of my ex-husband, and he loves it so much his new wife emailed me for the recipe. The only thing I recommend is to not use fat free mushroom soup...it just doesn't seem to work as well with this recipe.

I thought that this recipe was good.  I didn't have rice so I served it over cooked egg noodles.  Very simple and easy to make. Next time I think I'd modify a little to increase flavor.

This recipe only gets a four, because it tasted like something was missing--I don't know what.  The problem might have been my own, though; I used three smallish and three large chicken breasts, and it seemed like too much chicken. However, I shall be making this again.  Putting it in the slow cooker in the morning made evening meal preparations as easy as making a side salad! One more thing: I used uncooked brown rice and it turned out wonderfully!  The only cooking issue I had was that things stuck to the bottom and sides of the pot.  ADDITIONAL REVIEW: The day I put this on to cook at 7AM and didn't get home until after 5, it was very burned.  So if you must be gone the entire day, this is not a good slow-cooked recipe.

Great Recipe.  Will add it as part of our meal rotation to serve along with Delicious and Easy Mock Risotto from this website.  I panfried the breaded chicken in some butter for a minute on each side and then popped it in the oven for 30 minutes at 375.

I have this same recipe from a slow cooker cookbook, but the ingredient left out in this one is 1 cup white cooking wine. It makes the recipe!! This is a very good dish - rice goes in "uncooked". Fix it and forget it!

I thought this was one of the best recipes I ever had!  One thing that was different - I had to remember the recipe from what I had read because I forgot to take the recipe home with me the day I was making it.  So I forgot the milk and parmesan!  Didn't matter!  For anyone who thought it was too thin, just omit the milk.  No problem.  I can't wait to make it again with the parmesan this time.  Oh, and I did not include the rice.  I figured I could always make that separately if we wanted rice with it.

This was soooo yummy! Hubby and kids loved it! So easy to make. I cooked the rice seperately since other people said it got soggy and only cooked the chicken on low for 4 hours. It came out perfect. I also added some sour cream and used a little less onion soup mix, since others said it was a bit much. I will make this again and again!

The flavor was pretty good but the rice was total mush by the time we ate, and the chicken fell apart.  I might consider cooking the chicken from this recipe, but leave the rice out.  On the other hand, whenever I cook chicken in the crock pot, my family says it's dry, and I tend to agree.  Not sure what I'm doing wrong.

Cooked on high for 4 and 1/2 hours and the chicken was tender and just fell apart. It was very tasty. I originally put the butter in as directed but it all came up and sat on the top so I ended up spooning it all out. Added a tsp of minced garlic. Great recipe!

I followed this recipe closely except I sprinkled the cheese over each serving on the plate. I feel this made an appealing look as well as allowed you to taste the cheese better. This is a great recipe and plan to make it often.

Very good- my husband proclaimed this another "keeper".  With the soup, soup mix and parmesan cheese, however, extra salt is not needed.  Will definitely make again.

I omitted the rice, added chopped onions and mushrooms and about half way through broke the chicken up with a spoon into smaller pieces and added extra parmesean cheese to it.  Turned out awesome!  My family loved it on mashed potatoes.

I thought this recipe was wonderful!  I'm a big fan of those packaged, pre-frozen chicken breasts that I can just toss in.  After reading some of the other reviews, I didn't add the converted rice because I was afraid everything would get mushy.  Instead, I microwaved some instant rice when the chicken was done and served the chicken and sauce over that.  The house smelled so good while this was cooking that our neighbor asked me what we were having for dinner.  After I told her, she decided she'd make the same thing the following day.  Thank you, Diana!

This is a great, easy meal for a weekday.  It's not gourmet, but very good.  My family enjoyed it.  I used regular rice and added a 1/2 cup more liquid.  I would add a veggie next time.

Good recipe.  I cooked the rice separately from the Chicken, and just put the chicken and sauce over the rice when it was done.  While the chicken was cooking, I added a whole bunch of garlic powder and herb chicken seasoning.  My chicken did not turn out dry at all.. in fact it was very moist and delicious.  This one stays in my recipe book.

My boyfriend had told me about a recipe something like this so I searched and found this... This was great... but I added 1 cup white wine, garlic powder and some Mrs. Dash (yellow lid), and morzarella and let me tell you, everyone wanted more! Was great, thank you!

I tried this tonight and it was great.  The chicken was falling apart it was so tender and it had lots of flavor.  If you want a little less onion taste, use less onion soup mix.  Otherwise, it was great and I will make it again!

After reading the reviews I've edited the recipe to my own tastes. I boiled my frozen chicken breasts (only 2) and then I shredded them. I added them to the mixture, minus the rice. Cooked on low for a few hours and it was perfect! Serve over mashed potatoes, instead of rice, with biscuits on the side! Tastes like a pot roast recipe on this site! I'll make this many many more times! Thanks so much Diana!!!

This is a family favorite.  I've given my nieces crock pots for their wedding showers; I include a few recipes, too.  This is one I ALWAYS include.

I thought this recipe was O.K., but my mother, who happened to be visiting when I made it, really liked it.  Probably will not make it again, just didn't do much for me.

If I ever make this again, it will be too soon.  The chicken was dry and the rice was unrecognizable.  :(

I used frozen chicken breasts and they came out REALLY dry.  The rice had wonderful flavor, but it had a hard layer on top.  Definitely wouldn't make this one again.

Unfortunately, I have to agree with the cooks who did not enjoy this recipe.  This turned out terrible, we ended up throwing it in the trash.  It is easy to make but the end result was not worth it.

This haad very good flavor, and I may make it again. The thing that got me confused was that it said rice"converted".  I assumed it meant cooked. What else could it mean? after amking it I decided that I would follow the advice of another reviewer who said she was skeptical about adding the uncooked rice. Hers turned out great by using uncooked rice and I think from now on I will also use uncooked rice. I think cooking the rice first is what makes it sorta mushy and gummy like. Other wise, it's a very good dish especially when you are strapped for time, throw it on in the morning and don't worry about it all day till time to eat. My kids loved it too, a 9yr. old and a 1 year old.

Good when you make the rice afterwards, we used wild rice flavor.  Then poor lots of remaining liquid over the rice when serving the chicken.  Otherwise it is a bit dry.

When I made this I thought that 6 chicken breast were a bit much. So I did 4 thinly sliced breast. I set my crock pot for 8 hours on low. At 5 hours it was done though so I turned it off. Very delicious! I would make it again and put some chicken broth in it, cause the rice burned just around the edge of the crock pot. I think the broth may help with that next time.

Delicious! I only made two changes: I cooked the rice seperately and used cream of celery soup instead of the mushroom option (down with all things mushroom!). The chicken breast stayed moist and absorbed the flavor well. Oh! I also added some corn starch to the sauce to turn it into a gravy. Thanks for the recipe.

Good flavor but cooking the rice that long gives you mush!  Wait and add rice towards the end.

My family liked the recipe but didn't love it.  I followed the directions as provided except I took the advice of other reviewers and cooked the rice separately to avoid the rice becoming gummy.  The smell was awesome and the taste full.  It was a good dish for a cold winter night.  Very easy to make before going to work in the morning.

Too salty, even though I didn't add any.  I wish they would come out with the onion soup mix without so much salt!  Otherwise, it was very delicious.  The chicken was moist and fell apart, the rice was perfect.

I made this tonight and I really liked it, wasn't the best thing ever but pretty good, I might make it again but in large rotation.  I used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken and I cooked the rice separately so it wouldn't be mushy.  2 of my 3 boys loved this and my husband liked it too

I cooked as instructed, except I did not add the rice to the crockpot, as per other rreviewers complaint of mushiness.  After chicken cooked in sauce, I shredded it/cut into chunks.  I did parmesean into the sauce (1 cup), then also parmesean at the end.  Served over noodles.

This is delicious. I used a lot more water because of earlier reviews stating too salty. It only took 2 hours on my crock pot, I can't imagine why anyone would let this cook for 8 hours and then be surprised when the pot is burned and the rice is mush. The onion soup set it off, oh I love it. The shredded parmesan is nice and I used Tyson ready grilled chicken breats and cut them into cubes... Overall, very yummy and satisfying. I also used fresh garlic.

This is pretty good.  I cooked mine for 8 hours in the crock pot, but I think it was probably done after about 7 hours.  The rice was a little mushy and the chicken was a little overdone, but I still liked the taste.  I am going to make it again, just not cook it as long next time.

A suggestion would be to put the rice in the crock first, then the chicken, then the liquid ingredients - we had some rice get stuck on top of the chicken and not get cooked all the way.  I did a direct substitution with brown rice and it was completely cooked, but could have added more water or milk for more sauce.

Good comfort food.  My picky young ones like it because the chicken is so tender.  Omitted rice per other reviews and serve it with egg noodles.  Thanks for posting.

I made this without the rice.  Cooked it separately and served the chicken over top of it.  I think the onion soup mix is overpowering.  Maybe cut it down to half the package.

I give it a 4 because the rice just did not work in the slow cooker.  I do love it without the rice though. I did not add the salt and pepper because it did not need it.  I even did this recipe in the oven.  I just baked it at 350 for an hour and it was great too.  The sauce is very addicting though...I almost drank it when dinner was over it was so good.

The ingredients are tasty enough, but it looks awful! I prepared it twice, and my husband- who will eat just about anything- scraped off the rice mixture, and ate the chicken .

Next time I will add a little more water to the rice mixture to keep it from burning around the edges as bad.  I will also pour a little of the rice mixture in the bottom, then place the chicken, then pour the rest of the rice mixture.  All in all this was an excellent recipe and I will definitely be fixing it again!

Not sure if it was my slow cooker or the lack of liquid in this recepie, but after 9 hours on low, the chicken turned out very dry and the rice very pasty, like stuffing.  If I try it again, I'll be adding more milk and cooking it on a day when I'll be home to definitely turn it off after 8 hours on low.

We absolutely LOVED this meal and it was SO simple!  I cubed the chicken so that it would cook faster and was thrilled with the outcome.  I served the chicken/gravy mixture over egg noodles initially, and then over warm slices of bread (kind of like an open face sandwich) for the leftovers.  My husband honestly couldn't get enough of it.  I will definitley make this again!

Be careful using the "high" setting. At 3 hours, my chicken was overcooked. Otherwise, good flavor.

Weeeeelllll.... it was ok.  I made it basically as it said but added a bit of extra water.  I only cooked it on low for 4.5 hours & was way cooked.  Had to turn it off actually as it was ready too early!  It turned out as I expected, a gluggy rice mess.  It didn't taste too bad I suppose.  The chicken was nice enough but I couldn't eat the rice mush.  Hubby did.  So wouldn't make this again when there are better ways to do chicken.

Forgot the Parmesan cheese, but this was excellent.  Used 1 can soup and small can of mushrooms and after 2 hours on low, added another cup of water and bumped up to medium.  Used minute rice and this was done in about 4 hours.  Chix very moist and fork tender. Used 4 very large, thick breasts.  Onion soup mix smelled like it would be very strong, but gave a nice flavor.  Definately a keeper for a busy day.  Something different for same ole chicken.

I've always thought there are 2 kinds of cooks, those who use cream soups (and canned broth and boullion cubes) and those who don't. I decided to give this one a chance to prove me wrong, but it wasn't even close. The canned soup made it gluey, and overpowered everything else.

I made this for the family yesterday and OMGosh ,It turned out wonderful they ate every bit of it. I made some adjustments of my own and followed some advise of others. I used frozen boneless skinless breast (no time to thaw), brown rice(all I had), garlic powder about 1 TBSP. I cooked it low for the 8 hrs. The chicken was so tender you could it with a spoon. I was impressed with the rice usually brown rice is a "tough" rice but this was more like the white rice the entire meal was yummy. If it can get my picky eater to eat I am happy. This one is a keeper.

Like most other comments, mine turned out with both soggy and crunchy rice, and dry chicken. I make all kinds of chicken and rice recipes but this is not one I will repeat. It was too salty, the onion soup taste was to strong and the overall color was not pretty. It was eatible but that's all.

Not sure why this is called Parmesan Chicken, it doesn't taste like Parmesan at all.  

I left mine in the slow cooker while I was at work, the chicken was WAY overdone.  I can't seem to find converted rice, so I decided to cook that on the stove separately.  Instead of plain rice, I used liquid from the slow-cooker in place of half the water.  I reeeally liked the rice, but my boyfriend wasn't thrilled.  Probably won't make this again, and *definitely* won't cook it for 9 hours.

The chicken tasted fantastic, but the rice/soup mixture was quite salt, and just kind of a mush.

Way too watery, I didn't even try it, but my poor husband was starving and he ate the whole thing. I was planning on cooking the rice on the stove but didn't do that once I saw the mess that was in the crock pot. I guess it tasted ok to my hubby but I won't be making it again.

I liked the idea of it being a one pot meal. It only took 4 hours to cook and I added an extra 3/4 a cup of water. It was good but next time I'm leaving out the dry onion soup mix and adding green beans and French's Fried Onions....I will make it again.

I hate to write this but this recipe was aweful-  I love using the crockpot and you really can't go wrong: except w/ this recipe-  The rice was under cooked and crunchy and the chicken was overcooked and dry.  I tried to add more water at the end to soften up the rice,  now it turned to mush, I couldn't even make it a soup-

This recipe was ok. I cooked it on low for 8 hours and my chicken was over done. I used brown rice instead of white and it turned to mush. My husband and son ate it up with no complaints. Sorry, I don't think I will make this again.

This was a very tasty recipe.  The chicken was a little dry and the rice was mushy but I did cook it on low for 8 hours so...

Next time I won't cook it quite as long and try adding the rice later but I will definitely make it again.

I've made this recipe before, as described, and it was very good. (4 stars) This time I was short some of the cream of mushroom soup, so I added a block of cream cheese and switched out the milk for chicken broth.  It was still good.  (I did have to microwave the soup and the cream cheese to soften so the cream cheese would blend in.)  Also, in this version the rice WAS mushy, but I like it like that.

Fantastic and let's talk about inexpensive.  I used the end of a container of a 3 cheese blend along with regular parm.  I wouldn't recommend...the Asiago made it a bit too sharp I also added milk to the egg bath.  Super moist and yummy.  My husband saved some just so he could take it for lunch the next day.  Will definitely make again!

I cooked in for 8 hrs on low. It burnt on the sides and the chicken was very dry.  Also, it had a funny smell like another reviewer mentioned.

The chicken was dry and the rice was very sticky.  I would not make this again.  The taste was okay.

This recipe had a GREAT flavor! The only change I made was substituting 1 can cream of chicken soup for one can of the mushroom soup. I monitored how the rice was doing throughout, so it didn't end up mushy like others have said. It ended up being delicious! I will definitely make this again!

Was a pretty good recipe, but was a bit bland. I cooked for two hours on high and rice became mushy. Will use again, but not my favorite.

Very easy to make and turned out really good.  It was a little overdone when it was cooked on high for 4 1/2 hrs.  Probably won't have it too often because it isn't great for you, but does taste very good.

I forgot the Parmesan cheese too, but nobody missed it. Not the best chicken and rice I have had, but well worth it for the ease of preperation.All in all a good recipe.

This recipe came out pretty good.  Everyone seemed to like it.  However, I did omit the rice because I couldn't imagine cooking rice for 8 hours!  I served it over egg noodles and overall it was very simple to make. Thanks.

This has become one of my favorite meals to make.  I make it at least once a week, and my husband and son ask for it more often than that.  I've been using the cream of mushroom with roasted garlic (using up what I had on hand already) and it adds an awesome twist, not that one was needed.  It's inexpensive and a great "comfort food" meal.  Thanks!!!

It was much better than I expected. I was worried that the chicken would either be dry or rubbery, but it was very good. The only thing I changes was: I added chopped onions. Next time, I will not add extra salt. It was too salty! It's certainly not a pretty meal ... but good.

There is a lot of butter in this recipe and, as many previous reviewers state, the rice is very "mushy" and the chicken dries out.  It is easy to put together but will not make it again.

This was a very tasty and easy recipe, although when I make it in the future (which I definately will!) I will cut back a little on the amount of onion soup mix.  The flavor was just a little bit too strong for my tastes.

I didn't think this had much of a parmesan taste, but it was extremely tender, juicy and flavorful. It was falling apart as I dished it up. I will definitely make it again and again.

The hubby didn't care too much for this particular dish, but I thought it was okay.  The only thing was that the chicken was somewhat dry (cooked on low for 10 hrs).  The sauce was good, though.  I too cooked the rice separately, and sprinkled garlic powder on the chicken.

This is a very easy and delicious recipe.  Instead of cream of mushroom, I used cream of chicken soup because that's all that I had.  My husband good, and that he wants it again.

DO NOT MAKE THIS!!  Eww, this was just gross!  This is the first time I have given a bad review but this time it cannot be helped because there is nothing redeming about this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and made sure to use converted rice but what I ended up with was a mess with the consistency of paste.  My husband is probably the least picky eater I know and he wouldn't touch it.  Threw the whole thing out and just ordered in pizza.

I came home from work to find a wonderful smell-but thats all that was wonderful. This is one of the worst recipes I have ever tried. I looked like a big mushy chicken and rice glob. Even my kids said "No way". And they are not picky.

5 Stars all-around.  Loved this recipe and it was so easy.  We had accidentally bought boneless turkey breasts instead of chicken and I didn't know what the heck to do with them.  I had all the ingredients this recipe called for, so I tried it, and it turned out fantastic!  I recommend this with chicken or turkey.  I might cut the milk to 1 cup next time because the rice was really, really moist but still delicious.

My husband and I LOVED this!  It turned out great!  My 17 month old didn't care for it though, I think it was a little too flavorful for him... plus I added extra cheese :)  Definately a keeper!  A nice casserole type of thing!

Delicious!  The chicken stays moist, and it's so easy to put together.  Just combine everything, put it in the slow cooker, and forget about it for a few hours!

This one didn't go over so well.  The rice was less than desirable and the chicken was so-so.  I won't be making this one again, but it might be better suited to someone else's taste.  Thanks Anyway

My family and I love this recipe.  I added a package of frozen vegetables
on top of the chicken before adding the rest of the ingredients and it was
great.  There's nothing better than a whole meal in one crock pot!

Great recipe! I did add a little more milk and I used vegetable soup mix instead of onion soup because onion is so strong. I also only cooked it on low for 4 1/2 hours and it came out perfect.

Very easy to make.  Loved the rice!  It is just like my favorite rice that my Mom used to make, only easier.  The chicken was a little dry and basically crumbled!  Might be better with the chicken cut into chunks and mixed into the rice.  Overall, a good recipe.  I will make it again.

This receipe came out disgusting. Rice so mushy it was unedible and the chicken had to be used for chicken salad.  Would not recommend it and will not make it again.

The flavors were really good, although a bit strong for kids, but the chicken did come out dry. We kept wishing for a gravy of some kind to help moisten it up.

I tried this recipe and I also found alot less cooking time is required and not as much margarine is needed.  Mine came out mushy and the chicken was dry.  Next time, I'll put in boneless chicken thighs as well as breasts and cook alot less.

This had a great flavor.  However, mine started to turn a little pasty too.  I cooked it on low for 9 hours.  Next time, I will reduce the time to 6 hours on low.

This is quick and easy in the crockpot, but the finished dish is a dingy brown color. It tastes OK, a little oniony, but the appearance leaves much to be desired.

Hard to get by how unappetizing this looked. I even added the rice two hours in to hopefully have less mushy rice but it didn't help. Probably not going to make it again, even though it had ok flavor.

With some alterations, I really liked this dish. Since some folks said the rice got mushy, I used brown rice, which holds up a little better. I found that I had to add some chicken stock for the brown rice to cook properly.  And I never let anything cook for as long as the recipes say, since newer Crock-Pots cook faster.

I couldn't use cream of mushroom soup because my family hates it, so I used cream of chicken. I also only had 4 chicken breasts because my slow cooker is too small for 6. The rice was mushy and the taste wasn't great. So if you can't do cream of mushroom and can't do all 6 chicken breasts then I wouldn't suggest this.

Very good. My family of picky eaters loved it.  The perfect comfort food to come home to after a cold, winter day.  Super easy to throw together.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts, half the amount of butter, and calrose rice instead of long grain.

This sounded so good when I read it.  I couldn't wait to make it.  Well, I made it yesterday and it was so salty & the cheese burned on the sides of the crockpot.  I think if used a reduced sodium soup and didn't add any extra salt, it would be better.  The chicken, however was great!  Very moist.

This recipe is just ok.  I used cream of chicken instead of mushroom because my boys won't eat mushrooms and I don't think it maked much difference.  Added garlic, italian seasoning and onion powder as well.  Taste was similar to stovetop.  The recipe did have a very salty taste to it and the chicken dry.

This is what I'd call comfort food.  It's a good flavor without a lot of spices.  It was very moist.  I don't like mushrooms so I used cream of chicken soup.  The only change I'd make the next time will be to cut the chicken pieces into large chunks (maybe 1/3 or 1/2 breast) to make it easier when serving.

Wow..let me just say I was very pleasently suprised by this dish.So easy to make and so delicious!I reduced the recipe for just 3 chicken breast (its just me and my husband) and I cooked it in the oven in a glass baking dish covered in reynolds wrap on 250 degrees for 5 hours.So tender and very flavorful.Have to agree it is not a very eye pleasing dish but it is good.Thanks for the simple great recipe.

pretty foolproof recipe. I used bone-in breasts, and cooked for 9 hours; done and almost too dry at that point, at the smaller ends of the breasts . . . to be expected, I guess. Plenty of good sauce to go along with bread, which we have, even though there is rice in the recipe! Like another reviewer suggested, I put 1/2 cup rice into the bottom of the greased crock pot, then the chicken, butter, soup mixture with another half cup of rice included. Like I said, plenty of sauce even including much more rice than the recipe called for. A good weeknight easy-to-fix recipe.

It tasted good, but...after cooking for 8 hours on low the rice was mush, the parmesan burned along the edges, and the chicken was dry.  It was also a little too salty for my taste.  I think if I did 6 hours on low and added the rice and parmesan 1/2 way through it would be much better.

I took this recipe and tweaked it... it turned out great. I omited the rice, but made brown rice on the side and stirred it in before I served it. Also, the parm will burn in the pot, so I added that after it was dished up. Turned out superb, even the kids scarfed it down.

I really wanted to like this recipe beacuse it sounded good and was so simple for a one pot, slow cooker meal.  The rice was a bit firm but was probably my own fault for using brown rice since it typically takes a little longer to cook.  The onion soup mix made this taste very salty.  The kids liked it but my husband and I weren't huge fans.

Taking other reviewers comments into consideration, I prepared this in the crockpot w/o the rice and cooked the rice seperately.  The flavor, while okay, was not what I expected.  My family did enjoy the dish, but I wasn't that impressed and will probably not make this one again.

I made a few changes, I used turkey (DH won't eat chicken, I used brown rice, I used 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can cream of chicken soup and I added an extra 1½ c. of water. I cooked on low for 6 hrs then went automatically to warm for 3 hrs. The turkey breasts were dry & tough and the rice had absorbed all moisture and was over-cooked mush. But that mush tasted great! Whole family loved the rice mush. Recipe could be great but maybe only half the crock pot time or not slow cooked at all.

My husband and I enjoyed this.  I cooked it for 8 hours on low and the chicken was a tad dry.  Next time I'll try 7 hours.  I didn't change anything in the recipe.  Very good, thanks!

Yummy!  I did not add the rice to the crock pot.  I did everything else the same.  Cooked on low for 7& 1/2 hrs.  Put some Birds Eye steam fresh rice in the microwave and dinner was ready.  Will definitely make again.

I was so excited when I saw this recipe - it sounded yummy, the reviews were great and it seemed easy.  Boy was I disappointed.  The taste was strange and we all took a couple bites and then tossed it, deciding to eat leftover pizza instead.  Plus 8 hours on low in the crockpot was way too long.  Had I left it in that long, it would have burned.

This recipe was very good.  (I used breasts).  When I tested the chicken for doneness I thought it felt tough but that was not the case.  It was very moist.  I made homemade chicken soup for Paul's lunch with the leftovers.

This was super easy and really good.  I made a few changes however.  I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of chicken instead.  I also poured half of the rice mixture into the crock pot then put the chicken down and poured the rest over the top.  The chicken was moist and juicy.  My entire family loved it.

This recipe is from Crockpot called Velvet Chicken with Mushroom Wine sauce.  The only reason I know that is because I bought my brother a crockpot for Christmas last year and this recipe was on the box.  The submitter didn't include the 1/2 cup of white wine.

I did not like this recipe. It was rather bland and the rice ends up very mushy. I had to practically overdose it with pepper just so it would have some flavor. If I ever make it again, there will be some serious overhauling of the recipe.

The whole family liked it.  I only had minute rice on hand so I made a minor change. I used 4 large chicken breasts. Cooked on low for 4 hours then added 1 cup of minute rice and cooked for an additional hour.  It problably could have handled a little more rice.  It was soupy when we first opened it but it thickened up after sitting open in the crockpot for 10-15 minutes

Ten hours on low is too long, and the rice gets mushy.  Other than that, which other reviewers warn about, I thought the taste was just average and bland, and I probably won't make it again without making some serious changes.

I was hoping to prove the other people whose review I read WRONG by making this recipe and having it turn out perfect.  But I did prove them right.  My chicken was dry, the cheese was burned.  The rice was OK, but overall, it was bland, dry and I ended up eating cereal instead.  I even cooked it on low for 5 hours too.  Maybe if you want to make this, try using Chicken Tenders and cook for 3 or 4 hours.  I know I won't waste my time with this recipe.

The dish came out ok. I substituted wild rice and chicken breasts.  It was done before 8 hrs (my crock pot?) and the chicken did turn out a bit dry.

this was a pretty good comfort food and I had all the ingredients on hand which was great. I did use preseasoned italian chicken breasts which might have made the meal a bit more salty than I would prefer so watch that I don't know if it is salty with regular chicken breasts. Anyway, good and easy recipe. Thanks.

The dish was edible, but I will not be making it again.  I followed it exactly, but couldn't let it cook for longer than 5 hours on low.  By then, the chicken was pretty dry and the rice was mostly mushy yet hard in places.  Again, it was edible with a nice flavor - but neither me nor hubby will eat it again.

I read the reviews here and made some  changes.  I added a couple crushed up chicken boulion cubes and some flour to the mixture to help with the flavor and consistency.  I also added some garlic powder and some lowry's seasoned salt.  It was VERY flavorful.

I used about 1-1/2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and added a cup of sour cream.  Also added a drained can of mushroom slices and 1 teaspoon of minced garlic to the mix.  I left the rice out and served this over spaghetti.  The butter does end up floating on the top, so I'm not sure how much good it does for the recipe.  I cooked it for 4 hours on high and the chicken was still quite moist.  Very tasty - I'll definitely make this again.

Good quick meal! I cooked it in the oven like another reviewer tried. It worked well at 350 for 45 min. with 15 min. to brown. I agree however, that it does need more rice when served.

I wish there was a 0 star option for this one.  It was plain disgusting.  It was super salty, the chicken was dry, and the soup/rice mixutre was a bunch of mushy goo.  But more than that it smelled really weird--it almost made me sick to be in the kitchen by it.  We threw it out.

When I first tried this after about 45 minutes into the cooking time I loved this recipe.  However it cooked much faster than the recipe said and after I served it the rice quickly turned mushy.  I would have given it a higher review if I just went off that first bite.

I just made this again for the first time in a long time.  I browned the chicken this time in some oil, garlic and even a little onion soup mix then I through it in the crock pot with the sauce and rice mixture.  I also added some white wine.  I think I'll take the rice out next time.  I don't mind the "mush" but it would be better as sauce minus the mush the rice makes.

I used this recipe last night for a large crowd at a church dinner.  It was a great hit, everyone liked it, and 3 people asked for the recipe. I used a GE Roaster Oven instead of a crockpot. I lined the bottom with chopped onions, used about 20 chicken breasts, each cut in half, and covered with the soup mixture.  I tried one can of chicken broth to replace some of the milk but it made it a little too salty.  It was really convenient to be able to add the uncooked rice and not have to cook extra rice, potatoes, or noodles. this was a breeze and was really delicious.

Pretty good meal. The chicken was a bit bland for us. Next time I will cut the chicken into smaller pieces instead of whole breast pieces. Also beware of overcooking. I left mine on low for the longest amount of time and the rice was overdone. But we all loved the flavors.

It had a good flavor. But I cooked on low for @9hrs. and the rice and chicken was a dried up pile of mush. I think if I make again the rice will be on the side and cook on low maybe only 6 hrs and maybe add a small can of mushrooms and some chopped onion.

Chicken was very tender, but rice was mushy.  Quite salty, and the 6(!!) TBSP of butter is over the top.  Won't make again.

Mushy isn't wrong. I followed the recipe exactly and it was very mushy. Next time will serve it over rice, egg noodles or whatever, but will not be part of the slow cooker. I think that this is one of those recipes that will take some time to get it "right for us", but we will try it again.

We were unable to eat this when it was finished cooking because the chicken became so rubbery. I'm not sure if I did something wrong or what, but I don't think I will try this again.

This was good, but not great. It just needed 'something else' to kick up the flavor. It will be good to serve to "easy to please" people, but pickier eaters might not like it. I'll try it again and tweak the ingredients. Very easy to put together. Cook the rice seperately. Otherwise it gets too mushy.

We thought the rice was a little too done, so it was kind of mushy.  It also lacked "zing" - just needs a little something.

Horrible! Cooked this all day in the crock pot and a crock is what i got. The rice was just a mush mess. The chicken was tasty but the rest was totally un-edible. Will never make again and DO NOT  recommend. Only wish i knew how the people that claim this is good, accomplished that task.

This was terrible, the rice was mushy and it was very salty. My son who likes almost everything hated it. I followed the recipe exactly and it still came out bad. Would not recomend this at all.

My husband really loved this recipe.  Next time, I will cut the cooking time back about 1 1/2 hours.  The chicken was a little dry, but the sauce was very good.

I didn't like this recipe too much.  Mine turned out bland and the appearance was awful!

This recipe was okay...it seems more like a chicken and rice recipe instead of parmesan chicken.  I think it would be better without the rice.  But the chicken itself was tender and juicy.

The rice was too mushy for my taste but I probably did something wrong.  I tried not to overcook it and turned it off at the earliest time line.  
It was very tasty though.  My husband enjoyed it so I'll make it again because we like foods with good strong flavors.
