The sage, butter and garlic makes this dish.  A must try!!!  So many people default to a sweet sauce for salmon but this is infinitely better.  You will not be sorry for taking a chance on this recipe.

My daughter made this and I had never used Thyme on Salmon.  What a delightful taste.  I loved it so much I made it at home and it was a great hit.  It is a must try, if you like Salmon.  I will definitely make again.

My daughter and I really liked this!  My husband is not so much a salmon eater, but we'll have this again, anyway!

I have a nice fresh sage plant so I was searching  for a good recipe and found  this one. I had all the ingredients except for the salmon so I substituted tilapia instead, it turned out great! I also added a side dish of sauteed kale with a vinaigrette dressing, it really completed the dish, I  wish i had taken a picture!  I didn't  make any other substitutions  to the recipies. Hubby liked it too, I will definitely make this again!

Very tasty but the pasta was a little dry.  I think I could have timed it better with the pea mixture, as I had prepared that ahead and it sat.  I’d make it again and maybe doctor the sauce a little.

It was delicious, but I made too much and didn't realize I didn't have foil. Next time I'll make a much smaller portion so there isn't as much left over.

I used this recipe as a "base" then took off with many changes. I used a 14.5 oz can of Pink Salmon which I drained. The salmon already has oil in it, so I skipped the use of the olive oil as part of the marinating. Instead added THREE frozen Trader Joes garlic pressed squares, dried Thyme (I did not have fresh), some dried Rosemary, onion powder, fresh ground pepper. When creating the "sauce" I added a few fresh Cherub tomatoes (eye balled it), and a 1/2 cup of brown onion,  I think shallot would work VERY WELL with this recipe, instead of onion. I also added basil, one frozen Trader Joes cube.  Sautéed the ingredients  with the lemon juice (instead of lime, I didn't have one!). I also added parmesan cheese when served. I used garlic infused Olive oil. You need to adjust the ingrediants as a 14.5 oz salmon is much less than is called for this recipe.
