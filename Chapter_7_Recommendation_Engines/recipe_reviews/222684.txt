Swapped out the mayo for Non-Fat plain greek yogurt. Added some diced celery, red peppers and red onion for crunch and more flavor. Also a dash of hot sauce. Mmmm.

nope.  I was hoping for a delightfully crunchy alternative to potato salad, but was sorely disappointed.  The end product was overly sweet and soggy.  :(
