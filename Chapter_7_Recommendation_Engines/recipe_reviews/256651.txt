This is a basic favorite recipe I've been using for years. My family loves this stuff on French toast or German pancakes. Once you've had this it's hard to go back to the store-bought junk! I never have buttermilk on hand-  I just add a teaspoon of lemon juice to regular whole milk, let it sit 15 minutes, and it curdles to make a great buttermilk substitute :)

1.14.17  Whoa, mega SWEET, but mega TASTY, too!  I typically don't like very sweet foods these days, but I must say that this syrup was delicious.  Served over Sweet Potato Waffles (on this site) for a lazy Saturday morning breakfast.

I absolutely love this syrup, definitely one of my favorite for pancakes. The only thing I would suggest is cutting down on the baking soda a little, it foams less but doesn't have as much of that baking soda taste
