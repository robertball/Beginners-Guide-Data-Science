This is not the best buffalo chicken dip. Here are my recommendations: as other reviewers said - use ranch dressing instead of sour cream. I think it's fine to use the canned chicken - doesn't change the taste and saves tons of time! Add 1/2 cup of finely diced celery (it's cooling with the hot sauce) use frank's red hot buffalo wing sauce specifically. I wouldn't use the blue cheese - instead get an 8oz bag of colby jack or cheddar. Mix most of the bag into the dip and sprinkle some on top before baking. This is not healthy at all - but man it's good!

not impressed.  The texture was thicker than I had anticipated, I believe it was too much cream cheese.  Not enough chicken either.  Won't make again.

I LOVE Buffalo Chicken Dip, but I can tell this might not be the best way to go about.  Using toasted bread for dipping seems like it'd be too mushy.  Tortilla chips work best.  I like using ranch in place of sour cream and shredding two cooked chicken breasts instead of canned chicken.

I thought this was good- I used 2 chic breasts-(although I have used canned and it is fine)- I always use the bleu cheese (i mixed it in)coz that what we eat with our wings- we dip with corn chips and celery sticks- although it would be good probably with the bread-
