Excellent, Ive made cauliflower rice many times and i always like cooking in a skillet with some oil and let it cook till it gets thats crispy brown. This method worked great too! I made it as directed but cut recipe in half using on 1 head. I use a cheese grater to "rice" my cauliflower and works perfectly. Served with a healthy chicken stirfry and some salad. Love how this can take place of a starch..plus its way more flavorful then rice.

I mixed this half & half cauliflower rice and broccoli rice from Trader Joe's (already riced in bags).  I added chopped mushrooms and sliced red onion, some of my favorite non-salted herb mixture, salt and pepper and roasted it all together on the stove-top in a large fry pan with a little avocado oil.  Roasted great this way just like in the oven.  Because it was so fine I felt like I had more control than on a cookie sheet in the oven to stir often.  It's a new keeper.

This stuff rocks! I made one tray without salt, one with Sriracha salt, and one with smoked salt. All were delicious and all disappeared within minutes. None made it to the freezer as planned. Thank you for the recipe.

This recipe makes great cauliflower rice.  Much better roasted than on top of the stove.  My daughter made this great suggestion: rather than chopping the food processor, use the grate blade in the processor.  Makes much more evenly sized "grains" and you avoid over processing.

The flavor of this dish is very good.  I love roasted cauliflower.  That being said, I don't know why you need to go to all the trouble of making it "rice" like.  Not a lot of trouble, but  this is really roasted cauliflower.  I prefer to just make regular roasted cauliflower.

Either 450 is too hot or the cook timing is far too long.  I would reduce both.  What I ended up with was a brown mess and that was cutting it off after the second 6 minutes of cooking.

I used olive oil instead of avocado oil, and the resultant dish was very tasty. I will definitely make again in lieu of rice

It really helped to rotate the pans each time I took them out to stir the cauliflower, otherwise they wouldn't have cooked evenly. Watch it carefully the last few minutes, mine browned up pretty quickly! It also shrinks down quite a bit by the time they're done. Next time I might add some minced garlic.

I made this with a large head of lavender-colored cauliflower, a small sweet potato I had lying around, one coarsely chopped onion, and maybe three large cloves of minced garlic. I shredded the cauliflower and sweet potato in the food processor. Mixed together in a large bowl along with with the garlic and onion, plus generous pours of mostly olive oil but also a dash of sesame oil, a hefty teaspoon of kosher salt, and a palmful of dried thyme plus oregano. Spread maybe 3/4 of an inch deep in a large pan and roasted at 400F for 25-ish minutes, mixing regularly until I got the texture I wanted. The colors were beautiful and the dish was so delicious. Expectations exceeded! Will be making this regularly. Thank you for the recipe.

I made this exactly as directed, or at least tried to, because cooking the cauliflower rice in the oven seemed like a great idea.  HOWEVER, after the six minute cook period, I had to pull the trays out and stop cooking because the cauliflower was already VERY brown.  I have a new oven, which heats accurately; 450 degrees is TOO HOT.  If I try cooking in the oven again, I would definitely lower the temperature.

Wow! Such an easy recipe with a big taste. Thank you! I used my Kitchen Aid accessory to rice the cauliflower.  I used olive oil because I am allergic to avocados. I will be using this cauliflower rice ecipe for many many things...such as rice and beans, Chunese fried rice and the list goes on. It is awesome by itself.

Cooked this at 400F with melted butter, 1 clove of garlic and some chopped onion, salt, pepper, chili powder and some dried chili seeds.  It was very good.  I probably should have cooked it a bit longer than 16 minutes, but we were too hungry to wait for another 11 minutes!  I'll make again and cook it a bit longer.

I loved how this turned out! I used the Trader Joe’s frozen Organic Riced Cauliflower so it took a little longer than the recipe calls for. I also used coconut oil because I prefer the taste and I really loved how it turned out!

OK, it's like this: it tastes good, but the timing was way off for my newer Frigidaire gas oven.  I started to smell scorching at 9 minutes (scorching around the edges but not done)! I stirred it around, letting it cool somewhat, and lowered the oven to 400, put it back into the oven for about 3 minutes in order to finish the rest of the rice. One of the two sheets I used ended up black rice, the other was rather brown, but usable.  If I could get the timing and temp right, I would do this again, because it does taste good.  However, after shredding one whole cauliflower (for two of us) I ended up with a very small serving bowl of usable rice.  Good thing cauliflower was on sale this week! Funny.

Flavor is good, but we do like roasted veggies. However, for cauliflower rice, we didn't care for it. Not sure if I roasted a little too long, but the texture of what I was hoping for with cauliflower rice was not there in comparison to others we have made. I would have rather just roasted cauliflower florets. Again the flavor is good, hence the 3 star rating, but we'll stick with the skillet method for cauliflower rice. Thanks for a new recipe to try though! :)

I can’t stand Cauliflower but this was very tasty.  Added butter spray every flip but other than that stayed with recipe.  Would recommend for those trying to eat healthy and add cauliflower to the menu.

I think it's ok. I mean... it taste good enough. I recommend a lower heat though. Instead of a golden brown, it kept turning black. And I don't think two heads is eight servings..... id say more like 4 or 5.

Awesome! Everyone in my family including small children loved this "rice". Warning: I made 1 large cauliflower and it only  made enough for 3 small  servings as it "shrinks" quite a bit..I'll love to try seasoned salts like the previous reviewer did. Thanks summiter for sharing your recipe!

This. Is. Awesome! Used Olive oil & a salt free seasoning (you could flavor this so many great ways). My picky teen topped hers with Parmesan & actually ate a veggie! New staple.

I made this using safflower oil because I did not have avocado oil. It was good but not great. Although it doesn't taste like rice, it is a good rice substitute for a low carb dish.  This was the first time that I have tried making and eating riced cauliflower. I will try this again with some seasonings to give this more flavor.

We really enjoyed the roasted cauliflower rice over the steamed. I added a little garlic salt and it was very tasty. Definitely worth the extra effort!

Loved this vegetable dish! I only used one head of cauliflower and it was just the right amount for cooking for one person. Yes there were left overs which I used the next day. I even gave some to my puppy to give her some extra low fat vitamins and she loved it too! I will defiantly make thus easy dish again.

I regularly roast chopped cauliflower, but have never riced it.  I won't do this again, but not because it wasn't delicious.    We eat cous-cous often and this resembles cous-cous.  Our minds were expecting cous-cous flavor & texture, but got cauliflower instead.  I guess we really do eat with our eyes.  We were all left unsatisfied and craving cous-cous.  Weird, I know.
