I rated this high because of the awesome taste.  I did have to make a couple of minor changes.  I didn't have any leeks so I omitted that.  The fluid content was way too high.  I used a total of 6 cups (4 of chicken broth and 2 of water) and it was still too thin.  I partially pulse blended with a stick blender and then added some instant mashed potatoes to thicken it a little.  With these minor tweaks it turned out great.  Will make again.

My house smelled marvelous while it was cooking  and it tasted great. I made it with black soy beans to cut down the carb count and after reading  Acknuds review I lowered the water added down to 3 cups, which was perfect.
I served it with a bit of sour cream and some grated cheddar.
The herb combination of oregano, cumin and bay leaf is just lovely. 
Thank you so much for posting COSM0. I'm keeping this!

I used dry black beans. Cooked them first, then followed this recipe. I also blended half the beans, leeks, and onions with some tomatoes.
