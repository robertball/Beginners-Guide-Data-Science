I eliminated all of the spices (We prefer none in our banana bread--family preferance), I cut the butter back by half and used unsweetened homemade applesauce in it's place and I cut the sugars back by half. I also used pecans instead of walnuts (another family preferance) and cut the mini chocolate chips back to a scant 1/3 cup. I made muffins out of this recipe--outr of one recipe I was able to get 16 biggish muffins. It turned out fabulously. Wonderful texture, VERY moist, lots of good banana flavor and we really liked the addition of the flax seed. Eight thumbs up, from all four of us!

I used regular sized chocolate chips, no other changes. It wasn't bad but I don't know if I'll make it again (I'm not a fan of artificial sweeteners)

LOVE THIS!  My kids ask for it all the time!  I sub sugar for Splenda as we can't do artificial sweeteners.  We make muffins out of it and are lucky if they last two days in our house of 4.  Have it for breakfast or try it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for dessert!  Sooooo good. Thank you @rainbowchip!

did some substitutes to try to make it a bit healthier, unsweetened applesauce forthe butter, left out the Splenda and used 1/3 cup unpacked brown sugar, still seemed plenty sweet with 2 overripe bananas, 1/3 cup mini choc. chips, no cinnamon and no nuts (per my daughter's request) .  Added 1/4 cup ground oats.  Our 17-year-old health conscious picky-eater daughter declared it "really good" and cut a piece for herself.  If it were just me, I'd have put in the cinnamon and probably pecans but it was "really good"to me too.  Baked as 9 x 5 loaf, yielding 15 -16 thin-ish slices, to keep from eatting too much all at once.  Might try all white whole wheat flour next time and no AP next time but will make again. Thanks!

I love it, I just change the artificial sweetener because I hate that stuff I use honey insted, and the flavor with the spices was sublime at least for me and my family. The 4 stars is just for the artificial sweetener if it wasn't for that it will be perfect
