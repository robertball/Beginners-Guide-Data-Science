This is probably the best sugar cookie recipe I've tried. 3 days later and the cookies are still super soft. I can't wait to mail some to some friends. The only thing different that I did to the recipe was add lemon juice instead of almond extract. When rolling I had to add a lot of flour. These cookies are great with or without frosting!

Yeah made this recipe and it needs to be cooked more than 6 minutes...it's like a pancake at 6 minutes and why does it blow the cookies almost twice the size...not a good recipe...flavor profile is there but not at all a cookie

Good taste but a hassle to make. My batter stuck to everything so I had to keep flouring it. Wasn't worth all the time it took. I made two other type cookies in the time it took to make this.

I made this recipe for Christmas cookies with my kids. The kids used cookie cutters for snowmen and other Christmas shapes however all shapes were completely lost while baking. The dough stayed flat but grew into large blobs. It needed longer cooking time I did about 10 minutes. The flavor however was good.

I did not care for this recipe. Not much flavor. Took 8-10 min and needed to up temperature to 375.
