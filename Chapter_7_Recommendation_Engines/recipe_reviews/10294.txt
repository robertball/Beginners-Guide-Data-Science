Excellent, everything a true lemon bar should be. Buttery, tender and tart.  Definitely use at least 1/2 cup of lemon juice or more.  I've made this recipe many times and find that 2/3 cups lemon juice (juice of 3 large lemons) gives this the perfect tartness. (add 1 extra tablespoon flour if using 2/3 cup juice)  I also added the zest of 2 of the lemons.  I made this in an 8 X 11 dish (smaller than what the recipe calls for) and found it ideal.  The crust is the perfect thickness and there is enough lemon custard in each bite to satisfy.  This recipe makes a lot of crust and does spread into a 9 x 13 dish easily, but makes a thinner bar.  If using the smaller baking dish (i.e, 8 X 11), make sure to increase cooking time of the crust and filling an extra 5-10 min each.  As another reviewer stated, it's better to overcook then undercook the crust.  Also, add 1/4 teaspoon salt to the crust for more flavor.  This will be my master recipe for Lemon Bars.

I have made two other recipes of lemon bars and on both of them the end result was that the liquid filling kind of melted in with the crust. On this recipe however, you can see a nice shortbread crust that was about 1/4 inch thick and 1/4 inch of the filling on top of that. I increased the lemon juice by one more large lemon and got about 3/4 of a cup of lemon juice. I also zested two of the lemons and added that to the liquid filling before cooking. I love it super tart, but I think most people might like it better a little less, so I would suggest using 1/2 cup of fresh squeezed lemon juice. Also,I let the crust cool for until it was just room temperature. To speed this up I put it in front of a fan for about 15 min. and it worked great. Then when the crust was cooled down I poured the liquid filling over it. I cooked the crust first for 20 min. then when  returned it to the oven with the filling, I cooked it for about 25 min. I ate some after it came out of the oven, but about 4 hours later, after being in the fridge, they were the perfect consistency. A nice firm crust, and the filling was like a really firm pudding that held its shape. I also added a teaspoon of salt to the crust recipe. I made mine in a 9 x 12 pan. Next time I am going to double the recipe so that the crust is thicker and their is a thicker amount of filling on top.

As printed, this recipe was not lemony enough.  Using other's suggestions, I tried it again using the juice of 5 lemons (a little over 2/3 cup) and the zest of two lemons. I also added 1/3 c. flour to compensate for the extra liquid.  I also had to increase the bake time to about 24 minutes.  These turned out GREAT with the extra lemon (and, of course, powdered sugar on top).  I also added a dash of salt to the crust and thought it was divine.  These weren't anything flashy or out of the ordinary...just exactly what lemon bars should taste like.

I hate it when folks don't try and then rate the original recipe.  Having said that, I'm forced to live a double standard and do just that!  I wanted to give Patty 5 stars for a perfect base recipe to start from.  After reading reviews, i just knew that Patty's original recipe wasn't going to have enough filling, nor be lemony enough to satisfy my lemon craving.  So here are the small changes I made to quell the lemon monster:  kept shortbread recipe as is, but added 1 tsp lemon zest.  Doubled the filling recipe, using a total of 1 1/4 cups fresh squeezed lemon juice and added an extra 2 Tbsp flour.  Cooked crust to recipe instructions, but needed to extend the filling cook time to 30 minutes.
Everyone loved these bars!  I was told that they beat anything you'd find at a specialty bakery.  That's saying something, folks!
However, credit MUST go to Patty!  Her recipe started it all!

Fantastic!  The crust was nice, crisp, and buttery- exactly how I love it.  And the lemon filling was just right.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added the lemon zest.  

Also a tip to make sure you get maxiumum juiciness out of your lemons- pop them in the microwave for about 15 seconds.  They yield much more juice this way!  

Very lemony, easy, and satisfying!  Throw away the boxed stuff and make these!

The crust seemed to need more sugar.  My mother said all she could taste was butter.  "Two lemons, juiced" is vauge and unfortunately my bars turned out with very little lemon flavor to them.  It would be helpful to know the amount of juice to extract.

The title of this dessert and the introduction pretty much sums it all up!...The best lemon bars I have ever had.
---UPDATE---I have been making these for a while now and although I believe they are perfect as written I have recently discovered using 1 Cup Icing Sugar mixed with 2 1/2 TBSP. of Real Lemon Juice (From concentrate/bottle)& 2 drops of yellow food colouring  to make a glaze and pour this glaze over the dessert as soon as they come out of the oven and allow to cool in pan. It's unbelievibly great for those tart lemon lovers with a sweet tooth. Also, keep these bars in the fridge they keep their form better then at room temp.

With nearly 1,000 reviews, I don't know that I'm adding much, but these are my favorite dessert to make for myself, throwing parties, and to bring to events. I make three minor adjustments based on other reviews: add 1/4 tsp salt to crust; use 2/3 cup fresh-squeezed lemon juice (more precise than measuring by number of lemons); add 1 Tbsp flour to custard because of extra juice. The result: perfection. Everyone loves them, everyone asks for my recipe, and friends give me lemons from their trees because they want lemon bars in return. I really can't say enough good things about these.

My mother always made these when I was a kid, now I make them all the time!  They have a buttery crust and gooey delicious lemon filling.  In the filling we use 2 cups of sugar and at least 1/3 cup lemon juice (and yes, you can substitute the lemon juice from a bottle).  I bake mine 20 min for the crust and an additional 25 with the filling (you want the filling slightly golden brown--a little too long in the oven is better than not long enough).  Dust with powdered sugar while they are still warm so it will stick.

These are really good. At first I thought the crust was too thick but now that they've cooled overnight and set up, the crust really is perfect. Definitely add salt to the crust; it comes out nice and buttery-tasting. For the lemon filling, I used 1/3 cup plus 2 tbsp. lemon juice and the zest of 1/2 lemon (whisk it into the dry ingredients before adding liquids). I used about 1/3 cup of flour. The flavor is PERFECT, nice and tart. I lined my baking pans with foil for easy lift-out, and both the crust and the filling stuck to the foil really badly. I'd definitely suggest spraying your pans with cooking spray; if I hadn't used foil, I have no idea how I'd get these out of the pan. With these changes, I'll make these again and again.

These were delicious...and close in flavor to the boxed ones. I used 2/3 cup lemon juice and 1/3 cup flour. The only thing I didn't like was the thickness of the crust..I think it might be thicker than the filling. Next time I will decrease the crust ingredients to make a thinner crust. Also like other reviewer's suggestion of a glaze of lemon juice and confectioner's sugar. I wil ty that next time too.  These are so good!

This really is the best.  Nice little crunch on the bottom and a nice tangy flavor.  I'll make this one again!  (I didn't have any lemons, so I used 5 Tablespoons bottled lemon juice.  Turned out great.)

I gave this recipe 3 stars as written. The crust should never be more than half the overall height of the lemon bar and with this recipe it was. Also, I prefer a dominant, slightly tart lemon flavor in the custard. That being said, this is what I did to make this recipe a 5 star to me. For the crust I used 1/2 cup butter, 1 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup sugar, a pinch of salt and the zest of 2 lemons. The custard I used 4 eggs, 1 1/4 cups sugar, 5 tablespoons flour, and 2/3 cup fresh lemon juice (3 lemons). I baked it in a 9x9" with parchment on the bottom. Cool completely before cutting.

WONDERFUL just the way it is. It aggravates me that so many people want to add their own recipe in the review. If you want to have others see YOUR way of doing it just submit a recipe, don't steal the thunder of someone else. It is just perfect the way it is!!! I would change NOTHING

First off, this recipe is VERY easy to make given that it is homemade.  I really recommend it for any new bakers out there.  I JUST finished this recipe and followed it almost exactly as called for.  The ONLY changes I made were to use 3 large lemons and a bit of lemon juice just to get to 2/3rds of a cup of juice.  I then added 1 tablespoon flour to the mix as a previous reviewer suggested.  I just tasted it and it is VERY lemony delicious.  (VERY lemony) So, for anyone that wants to make sure they get a lemon flavor, I would say squeeze at least enough lemons to get a 1/2 cup of juice.  THE TASTE OF THE CRUST IS AMAZING.  Do not listen to those that said it has no flavor.  It is rich, buttery, and melts in your mouth.  You do not want the crust to be too sweet, because the filling is VERY VERY sweet (trust me).  This crust balances that sweetness.  The only difficulty I had with the crust portion was the bake time, and no I do not know why (probably my oven).  I baked it for 30 minutes and it still slightly undercooked in my opinion, but still MORE than edible.  Next time, I will bake the crust for 40 minutes.  I just put it in the fridge and I can't WAIT to share it with everyone tomorrow.  It is TRULY fantastic.  This was so simple to make and very inexpensive ingredients.  TRY IT.

I can't stand it when people change 27 things about a recipe and then rate it by their changed version.   I give this recipe 5 stars because it's delicious, without all the changes. There was more crust than I was expecting. If you like a 50/50 split between lemon goo and crust, then this one is for you!

OK, I made these last night with a few changes based on some of the reviews I read. I kept the crust ingredients the same, but when it came to the filling I detoured a bit. If you want a sweet lemony bar that gives you a PUCKER EFFECT on your first bite, with a good filling to crust ratio, this is what I did...I kept the 4 eggs, increased the sugar to 2 cups, increased the flour to a third of a cup, and used the zest and juice of SIX lemons. These changes took these bars over the top! I had to bake a little longer, and when they were completely cooled I dusted with a little powered sugar. Enjoy!

Since I know how to bake, I was able to make the steps that aren't really described here (such as how to crumble the butter into the flour until desired consistency).  That being said, even with the addition of the zest of one lemon, these were not the best I've had.  I believe there is a bit too much flour in the egg mixture, mine came out being rather eggy and too stiff.  The crust was slightly overcooked, doing 20 minutes and then a further 15 with egg/lemon mix.  I must say that if I had followed the recipe exactly (not adding the zest and even extra juice) that these would not have been edible, to me.  I would recommend the following changes:  adding the zest of one lemon, and the juice of an extra one, plus pre-baking the crust for only 12-15 minutes.  Also, adding salt to both the preparations, about 1/2 tsp.  Hope that helps.

I made this tonight and I thought they were good, but missing something. I used unsalted butter, but didn't add a pinch of salt to the mixture. I think that is what it was missing. Possibly next time I will add a little more lemon as well. I will definately make again.

Yum! While not as good as the ones I can get at at my local bakery, these really aren't bad at all. Having said this, I did make a few tweaks to suit my tastes. As MommyFromSeattle did, I also upped the amount of lemon juice (1/2 c. / ~ 2-3 lg. lemons - I was able to squeeze 1/2 c. of juice out of 2 lemons) and 2 lemon's worth of zest. Before I added my eggs, I tested my filling to ensure that it was to my liking. The sweet / tart ratio was perfect for me, but you may prefer otherwise (if you like em' sweet, go with less juice, etc.). I think 2/3 c. juice would make these far too tart, but that's just my $.02. :) I baked my bars in an 8x8 in. stoneware baking dish to ensure they'd be nice and thick (I do not like thin bar cookies). It took 30 minutes for my crust to cook to a light golden brown color and 25 minutes for my filling to cook thru. NOTE: If you are going to dust your bars with powdered sugar (HIGHLY recommended!), be sure to do so when they are warm - right out of the oven is ideal. If you wait until your bars have cooled, the sugar will not "stick." One more observation.... If you refrigerate until completely cool, these will firm up nicely and be MUCH easier to cut into uniform squares. Using a plastic knife also seems to work well. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Patty! I will be sending my hubs with a plate of these to take to his office tomorrow. :-)

I took the advise of some other reviewers and added 1/4 tsp salt to the crust.  I used 2/3 cup lemon juice, 1/3 cup flour and 1 tsp lemon zest in the filling.  I think that "2 lemons, juiced" is a very inacurate measurement; my lemons were kind of dry, and 2 of them would never have been enough.  This is a 5 star recipe with the changes, but the original only rates 3, so I rated it 4.

Easy to make with a great shortbread crust.  After reading the reviews I used a 2 1/2 qt glass baking dish and thought the ratio of crust to filling was perfect.  I used 1/2 cup of fresh lemon juice and the grated peel of 2 lemons and thought it was the perfect lemon flavor.    I would note that I was in a hurry when I made these and I dumped the filling on top of the crust as soon as it came out of the oven.  Some of the egg started to cook separately because of the hot crust.  Next time I will let the crust cool some before putting the final product in the oven.

wow,, congrats to the author.. the crust is great, however if you have my luck, your 2 lemons will give you like 2 tablespoons of juice LOL. so i used 2/3 cups juice.. but.. when i poured it over the crust i discovered it was way to little filling. so finally this is what I did. 1/2 cup flour, 2 1/4 cup sugar, 1 cup lemon juice, 6 eggs.  this was great.. thanks so much!!

I'm sure these would have been delicious had I been able to chisel them out of the 9 X 13 ungreased pan (per instructions).  Lesson learned:  USE PARCHMENT PAPER.

These are delicious--better the next day even! I used a smaller pan-- 7x10. I love tartness so added the zest of the 2 lemons. I was going to add the juice of 3 but only had 2 lemons- so I used enough bottled juice to make up to 2/3 c total. I needed to cook filling longer too--about a 1/2 hr total or until no longer jiggly soft.

First time making it and didn't like it all that much.
Too sweet and lacked a certain tartness.
Plus side was easy to make and to share....

Yum! These bars came out sooooo good. I used the juice of 4 lemons (instead of 2) and also added a tablespoon of flour to the the filling. They came out perfect and were gone in a flash. The only thing I would like to point out is that in the recipe, it says bake the crust until golden brown. I think if I did this the crust would have come out way too hard. I baked it until it got the slightest bit golden at the very very edge, and then took it out. Doing it this way, the crust was perfect. I will definitely make this recipe again.

These are perfect. I used the suggestion to use 2/3C of lemon juice (3 good-sized lemons) and a little less sugar. My kids love lots of the lemon custard. I add zest to the shortbread. Delicious.

This is a repeater on my menue, if I didn't make it for ten days I start to get complains. This should say enough - delicious lemon bars and a crowd pleaser. Very few people that do not like it. 
I add 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract to the bottom and substitute 1/2 cup bottled lemon juice and 1/2 teaspon lemon extract for the fresh lemons for convinience.

This was good and easy. I took the advice of other reviewers and added more lemon and lemon vest. I still found it not as tart as I prefer, I think it needed a bit more zest. This is a thin bar, so if I make them again I will double the lemon custard.

These bars are a delight.  Great texture and lemon flavor.  I used 6 T. fresh lemon juice (4 small lemons) and about 1 tsp. of grated fresh lemon peel.  My butter was unsalted so I added 1 tsp. of salt to the crust dough.  The salt is necessary if you aren't using salted butter.  One more note and it is crucial:  You MUST grease your pan - at least on the sides.  I followed the recipe and did NOT treat the pan and the cookies adhered to the sides of the pan like concrete.   No problem though-after I maneuvered the bars out of the pan, I chiseled off the baked on sides and ate them myself.  YUM!

Very lemony flavour, followed others suggestions of increasing lemon juice to 2/3rd cup and also increased flour, mine did not "setup" totally in the centre though after cooling, a little runny still but the outer 2/3rd's of the dish is ok.  Crust does make a lot, not enough for a 9x13 but plenty for an 8x11 or even a 9x9 square pan.

I made these into lime bars using a few small limes and a drop (just 1) of green food coloring for a green, black and white themed baby shower I was throwing.  They were great; I got quite a few compliments on how good they were.  I also froze them a week ahead and they thawed beautifully the day before the shower in the fridge.

This recipe is amazing. It is easy to cook and the result is fantastic. I greased the pan and didn't have any sticking problems. I used to the juice and rind of 3 lemons, it wasn't very tart. I guess the ppl who like it really lemony should use more. The crust is very buttery and yummy and the filling is perfect. The consistency was good, right out of the oven too.. My family and friends loved it. Will be making it often.

For my lemons bars, I use this recipe's crust, 6 eggs, 6 tbs flour, 3/4 cup lemon juice, and 1 3/4 cup sugar. The crust is really good, but I think the more filling, the better!

Sadly the crust was too thick and the time to cook it was not nearly enough, it made it soft and mushy. The filling was too thin and not strongly flavored. Very disappointing, I'm bummed.

I have baked for years but never tried a lemon bar.  Mainly because I never cared much for lemon until a few years ago.  I made this recipe with suggestions from the other reviewers.  I lined a 9 x13 aluminum pan with parchment paper.  Next I beat the room temp. eggs for 7 minutes then added only 1 1/2 cups sugar, added 1 loosely packed tablespoon of lemon zest, & not quite 1/2 cup of fresh lemon juice.  My 3 lemons were not as juicy as I had hoped they would be.  I baked the crust for about 23 min. & added the filling to it without cooling & cooked it for 22 minutes.  It was well set & lightly browned on top.  After cooling on the counter for 45 min. I sprinkled confectioner's sugar on top & placed it in the fridge.  After dinner I removed the parchment paper without a problem of sticking, cut it into bars, & my husband & I ate several bars with coffee.  Having never eaten a lemon bar I have nothing to compare it with but next time I would add 2/3 cup of lemon juice & pack the tablespoon full of zest.  I might even only use 1 cup of sugar because we like tartness.  This was a little too sweet but the crust was perfect.  Is the consistency supposed to be a gummy consistency because these were.  They were very firm in texture & look like the pics included with the recipe.  Overall, they were good.  With the above changes, I will make this again.

I use this recipes frequently because it gives exactly what the name promises- The Best Lemon Bars.  I upped the juice to 4 lemons, and adjusted the flour to 1/3 cup (in the custard) to maintain consistency.   The crust comes out buttery, flaky, and sweet, and the lemon custard is tart perfection!  None of my friends can believe the recipe is so simple...

I used the juice of five lemons and it came out delightfully tart, just how I like it.  This was fine because I also used an 8x11 pan and so the bottom was thick enough to offset the tartness.  The only problem with using so much juice is that when you put the powdered sugar on it tends to mostly melt in by the time you take it out to eat it.  I would put the sugar on when it comes out just to give it a little glaze, and powder it again right before serving for the visual effect.

These bars are delicious! But recipes calls for loads of sugar. I halved the ammount of sugar, so they became tangy (the way I like), creamy and very good!

I think this lemon bar really is (almost) the best!  A former co-worker of mine has a secret recipe for lemon bars that was really the best I've ever had, and I have been searching for an equivalent recipe.  I think this recipes comes close! The only thing I changed was adding more lemon juice. It's hard to tell what "juice of two lemons" means, since lemon sizes and the juice they extract varies. I would say about 1/2 cup to 2/3 cups of lemon juice, depending on your taste preference!

Yummy and easy! Thank you to the reviewers: added a bit of salt to the crust, added zest to the filling (used 3 lemons, as mine weren't too juicy), and followed the suggestion of sprinkling fresh blueberries in/on the filling. They were an amazing hot weather desert. Perfect, because not only was it very hot, but we had to travel by car for an hour (no A/C in car!) to get to the party, and I was worried about baking something that would not travel well. These were perfect.Sifted some icing sugar overtop,...and ate lots!They have also kept well. Still OK, after two days in the fridge...

I didn't like these at all. I followed the recipe exactly and I'm not a bad cook - so I don't know what happened. They weren't awful - but nothing I will make again. I took them to a get together, and people didn't seem to be digging them. One lady commented that she liked the ones from the box better. (HOW RUDE!)I've never made lemon bars before so I don't have anything to compare these to, they could be really good as far as lemon bars go but somehow I don't think so.

These bars are amazing!  If you like lemon...you'll love this recipie.  I had small lemons so I used the juice from 3 and it tasted perfect...not so tart you make a funny face.  I tried them warm out of the oven and they melted in my mouth.  This will be a great potluck or cookie exchange recipie to have!!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was great, exactly what I was looking for, simple and delicious. Having made it a few times now, I changed a few things to my liking: First I love a really lemony taste so I added the juice of 3 lemons, added the zest of 2 of the lemons to the dry ingredients and upped the flour to 1/3 cup to make up for the extra liquid. 
The crust is simply perfect just as it is, buttery and melts in your mouth. Also, just for a change instead of squares, I made this recipe in a tart pan and cut in into thin triangles.
Truly a great lemon bar and proves my theory that most times the recipes with simplest of ingredients are absolutely the best!
Thanks for a fantastic lemon bar recipe, it's my stand-by and the one I will recommend to others!

This was good! Here are my changes: I used a graham cracker crust. 12 graham crackers crushed up in an 8x8 pan, butter, sugar. Just eyeball it. Then I made the filling with a factor of .75....so 75% of each ingredient. 1/2 C fresh lemon juice. Baked 25 minutes. RESULT: great thick lemon bars with a crust that doesn't contain 1 C of butter. Success!

Great recipe! I took the advice of reviewers and added 1/2 tsp salt and lemon zest to crust and used 2/3 cup of lemon juice and 2Tbl zest to filling. I baked it in a 9x13 pan - no problem. I did let the crust cool before pouring filling over it. I refrigerated overnight and it was easy to cut. Will definitely make again. Got rave reviews from others. Better than the Paula Deen recipe. Tart, lemony taste-yum!

SO GOOD! First dessert I've ever made and it's always gone in a couple mins!!! I followed a lot of the other comments and for a more lemony flavor 2/3 cups lemon and a tablespoon of flour to balance the liquid in the filling. For more zest use 1 1/2-2 lemons. More tips...leave the egg out until it is room temperature, microwave lemons for 15 seconds to get juice rolling, if not just roll the lemons a bit for the same effect.

I used 1 1/2 times the filling the recipe calles for and used a 9 x 13 and add more lemon juice (around 2/3 cup total) as others have suggested. Sprinkle with sifted powdered sugar and they are absolutely AMAZING!!! Thanks for a super yummy recipe!

I am a VERY inexperienced cook...I've maybe been really cooking and baking for less than a year. These were my first attempt at lemon bars. I made a few revisions per the reviewers suggestions. I used 2/3 cups of lemon juice and added a tablespoon of flour. It took a lot longer for the crust to cook for me, but that may be my dilapidated oven. I cooked the crust, put it in the fridge for about 15 minutes, then added the filling and put it back in the oven. It turned out AMAZING. Very tart and delicious. I am so proud of myself! Thank you!

amazing.  The regular recipe works out easily and well.  I did take everyones advice with the lemon juice and flour though (2/3 cup of fresh squeezed lemon juice with an additional tbsp of flour).  Also I only use 1 cup of sugar in the filling.  I sell these at a market and people rave about them.  Once I increased the lemon and decreased the sugar everyone told menot to change it again, that combo was perfect.  Tastes like actual lemon bars, not that yellow gunk from the stores.  I think the people that complain about this recipe are only looking for those kinds of lemon products and don't really know what lemon really tasts like

The shortcake was too "bready" - not flaky and crispy;  the lemon topping was too gooey - not smooth and creamy;  and as far as the hints to "cool the crust" and to use parchment paper.....DON'T DO IT!!  As the shortbread cooled, it pulled away from the parchment.  When the topping was poured over, it immediately ran under the crust - I was left with a big pan of sticky pudding with a heavy crust baked on top.  I've been making lemon bars for 30 years, and I thought I would try something new - bad idea - time to go back to my tried and true recipe.  Sorry!

This was very tasty. I rated it 4 stars because I think the crust cooking time is off, maybe but as much as 10 minutes. The bars were definitely a little undercooked but they were still well-enjoyed! I suggest checking it a couple of different times and only taking it out once it's browned.

I thought that this was a great, simple recipe. It did not take long to make and left more time to make other things. I did make a couple changes. For the crust,  I used one stick of butter and 2 eggs. I aslo used 2 large lemons for a more lemony flavor. When I was done, I sprinkled some powdered sugar on top for a finishing touch. This is a GREAT recipe!

I made this in a 9x13 pan as suggested and had no problems with the crust being too thin, however 'juice of 2 lemons' is far too vague - I used 4 small lemons (about 1/4 c juice) and 1 tsp zest. It tastes good, but I think about 1/3 - 1/2 cup would be ideal.
Really tasty and simple to make - just needs clearer lemon instructions.

These are fantastic! I used 2/3 cup of lemon juice and added an additional tablespoon of flour to the filling as suggested by others and it turned out perfect! I used aluminum foil in the 9x13 which make cleanup easy.

These are the best Lemon Bars I have made so far.  It is a perfect mix of tart & sweet.  I made a couple changes based on the reviews, so I had to give the recipe 4 stars.  It is a good base.  Here are my changes  Crust = as directed Filling = 1 1/2 HEAPING cups white sugar, 2 small lemons zested, 2/3 cup & a dash lemon juice, 1/3 cup flour (to compensate for more juice)

if i could give this recipe zero starts i would. i normally make lemon bars on the fly without a recipe, but my wife prefers to go by the book and is a beginner cook.   first of all there is no need for such an elaborate crust for something so basic. less is more and in this case way too much. the crust is far too thick and buttery.  the topping is bland and far too eggy. i insisted on adding zest, but to no avail. we would have needed the juice of 6 lemons to make these palatable.   and, where's the powdered sugar in the recipe?

I've never rated anything other than 5 stars until I made this tonight.  I was really hoping this was going to be good, but honestly it's awful.  The lemon topping barely tastes like lemon (and I used zest and 1 cup fresh juice).  The topping is also very thin and not chewy at all.  Quite dissapointing.

Good recipe, but I baked it for the entire time and the inner pieces were too gooey. Use at least 1/2 cup lemon juice for a real lemony flavor.  Plan to make again and increase the baking time.

YUMMY!  These came out great!  I had about 100mls (almost 7 Tbsp) of lemon juice from my lemons, and the batter looked a little runny, so I added 1 Tbsp of flour and 1 more egg for the extra juice and they turned out perfectly!  Very tangy and I think my 5 year old wanted to eat the whole pan!

These are really good. I gave it a twist though. I put a lemon glaze on top after it was done. 2 cups confectioner's sugar, juice from a lemon and two tablespoons butter.Real lemony!

I am a lemon recipe connoisseur! These are the easiest, best tasting lemon bars I have ever made!
A couple of tips:
I always use a glass pan when baking lemon recipes, because the crust and edges are less likely to darken and crisp up too much.  If using a metal pan, dark or not, I lessen the temperature by at least 10 degrees and even more for a dark metal pan.  Sometimes bake times must be at lower temp and for longer time, and you can use your best judgment by looks during baking.
I agree whole-heartedly with MommyFromSeattle: Use at least 2/3 cup of lemon juice and add lemon zest if you have it!  This time I did not have fresh lemons on hand, so I used lemon juice from the bottle and added 2 teaspoons of organic lemon flavoring and used her advice to add the extra Tablespoon of flour for the filling.  This allows for that extra tart, super-sweet pop of flavor!
Instead of icing, I like to sift powdered sugar over the top, and one can do this immediately after baking to keep it from poofing up everywhere, and a little extra after bars are plated makes for gorgeous presentation!
Another thing I like to do with lemon bars is add crushed mint to my crust.  I added two teaspoons of crushed mint this time, and I think it was the perfect hint to complement the lemon flavor without tasting overwhelmingly of mint.
I did make one substitution:  I used half cup of butter half cup of coconut oil.
I think this recipe would also work for a graham crust, and plan to try it soon!
Mmm-MM!

Don't listen to the Reviews! Don't add x-tra lemon or lemon zest it makes the lemon bars way to sour! Stick to the original recipe!

Great texture and consistency but not nearly " lemony" enough for  me. I even added the lemons' zest to the recipe. Still searching for the perfect lip- puckering recipe.

I'm a simple man, so I'm a fan of simple goodness.  This recipe nails it.  Generally speaking, I'm not much on lemon anything, but I love these.  I have to control myself.  My whole family loves them.  My mom asks me to make them for her all the time.  I can't say there aren't better recipes for lemon bars out there, but I haven't found a need to look any further than this one right here.  It's like a sweet/tart goodness on top of a shortbread cookie.  If that doesn't sell it, you need help!  Simple and delicious.

i thought this recipe was going to turn out fabulous after reading all the wonderful reviews but after making not one but 2 pans of "the best lemon bars" and tasting it i was very upset, not only did it take me time to try to some how fix it but i wasted money. they didn't come out stiff or and least put together so i waited and when they still didn't harden i put them in the fridge...nothing then i tried the freezer... again nothing. the thing is i was upset since i had nothing to bring to the party i was going to, but not only that since then after that i had to go to crumbs bakery and get cupcakes , since i wasn't going to show up empty handed. after reading the names and the good reviews i thought this would be okay, but the ingredients weren't right ( powder sugar in the picture not in ingredients )and the directions didn't seem so thought out or clear. what I'm trying to say is next time i ever do a recipe off the internet i will read every review just so that i understand if the recipe is also to good to be true.

I was excited to make this recipe because I love lemon bars and these were so easy.  However, the topping did not adhere to the base, and in fact shrunk away from it.  Also, there was little to no lemon flavor.  I did make the recipe exactly as written.

I'm kind of surprised how well this recipe is rated. I made the crust as is and there is WAY too much crust! I like crust as much as the next girl but the ratio is way off - almost 2:1 crust  to filling. If you're going to try this recipe, my suggestions are:
- halve the crust recipe
- add pinch of salt (1/8 tsp) to crust
- use smaller pan for a thicker bar
- use at least 2/3 cup lemon juice, add lemon zest if you like more tartness, add 1tbsp flour to account for more liquid
- don't forget to adjust baking time if you make changes to the crust or pan size.

Honestly, having to make so many changes to a recipe makes it a little disappointing.

These were good, but I wouldn't say they were the best lemon bars ever. I did increase the lemon juice and added some lemon zest for a more tart flavour. Everyone said they were good, but there were lots left over, which says to me that they weren't that great. Not sure I will make this recipe again.

NOTES:  I MADE 1 + ½ THE LEMON FILLING.  The lemon juice I used was ¾ cup + 2 tlbs zest - it took me six lemons at least to get what juice I needed.  Using extra lemon juice requires just a little more flour 1/3 cup.  I thought my crust was too brown on the edges, but I cooked my much longer that it says too, probably 10 min.  The filling took  25 min.  Better too done than not done enough.  I sprinkled coconut on mine when there was about 10 min. left of cooking.  Excellent.  May just double the lemon fillilng next time.

I agree with other reviewers and made the following changes:  bottom/crust - add 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  For the topping - juiced about 4-5 fresh lemons to get 2/3 cup and added the zest of one lemon. Also added 1/8+ cup of vanilla almond milk to the topping.  Lots of powdered sugar on top after they cooled and some coconut flakes - - they were delicious!

I made this and took a couple of suggestions from some of the others who tried this delicious recipe.  I added a half tsp. of salt to the crust mixture.  And, I added the grated rind of the two lemons along with the juice to the filling on top.  
It was one of the best lemon bars I have ever had.
I believe next time I make it I will double the lemon mixture that goes on top.  It was sooo Yummy!

These were PERFECT!  This recipe recreated the delicious lemon bar of my childhood!  I substituted 1/2 c. Splenda in the crust and in the filling I used 1 c. Splenda and 1/2 c. sugar.  Also, my two lemons came out to be almost 1/2 a cup of juice.  I can't stop eating them...YUM!

Really good. Not overly sweet, but could have used more lemon flavor. Don't know if my lemons didn't produce enough juice; I did add a tbs or two of lemon extract. Next time will use an add'l lemon. Also my dough poofed out a bit, wasn't completely uniform. But will make again. Thank you!

The basic recipe is very good, but I prefer it with a few modifications, some noted in earlier reviews.  Add 1/2 tsp salt to the crust and double the filling, using the zest of two lemons and at least 1 cup (preferably 1-1/4 C)of fresh-squeezed lemon juice.  You may need to cook the bars another 5 minutes for the additional filling.  My family LOVES these!

Added a dash of salt like suggested and went with 2/3 cup lemon juice, 1 3/4 cup sugar, and 5 Tbsp of flour for the filling. Turned out perfectly with lots of yummy lemon flavor!   Powdered sugar on top!

I LOVE these and I'm making my second batch of the week! I have made these using a 9x13 pan and then an 8x11 pan, as someone else suggested. The 9x13 was just right. Be careful not to overbake, though; 20 minutes is perfect.

These were great! I increases lemon juice to 2/3 a cup and the flour to 1/3 a cup as others sugguested. I made mine in a 9x13 pan and I thought it was perfect. There was exactly 1/2 crust and 1/2 lemon.

These are delicious, very lemmon-y. We put the zest of one lemon in the crust and used 2/3 cup of store bought lemmon juice.

These really are the best! I did adjust the lemon juice to make them more lemony by adding 2/3 C total and also used the zest of 2 lemons. I added 2 drops of yellow food coloring although it wasn't necessary. I've never made shortbread before so the consistency of the dough kinda threw me off, it didn't seem like it stuck together good enough when mixing but when I pressed it into the pan it worked out beautifully! Very thick crust and perfect custard ratio so I'm glad I didn't listen to the reviews and double it, although I did use a bit smaller pan. 11x7

These are delicious! I added a bit more lemon juice and also halfway through baking time, I add spoonfuls of raspberry jam (strawberry would be great too) to the pan of bars and the end effect is this awesome lemon raspberry bar that disappears very quickly!

This is just my speed.... quick, easy and delicious. My grandsons have a new " made by nana" favorite!!!  The best part is that it is so easy. Its easy enough that I may let them help next time. Like me, they love anything lemony. The tarter, the better. So, i did add a little more lemon juice and some zest. OMG!!

I used 4 small lemons and put zest in the crust, filling, and on top after I doused the warm bars with powered sugar.  Everyone loved them.  I also added another tablespoon of flour to the filling to compensate for adding more lemon juice.  
I used parchment paper and made a sling to pull the cooled bars out to cut easily.

This is FABULOUS!  I made an amalgam of modifications based upon other user's hints, including adding lemon zest, warming lemons 15 seconds in microwave before squeezing, doubling filling to get a thick bar, baking longer.  I needed a LOT - 2 9 x 13 Pyrex baking dishes.  Here's exactly what I did:
Crust: 2 Cups soft butter, 1 Cup white sugar, 4 Cups all purpose flour, 2 tsps lemon zest. I creamed the butter with a hand mixer, added the sugar gradually, added the zest, added the flour 1 cup at a time. I divided the dough between the two Pyrex dishes. Do not bother trying to pat dough up sides of dish..it just melts and slides down the side so you might as well just pat it out evenly over the bottom and forget the sides.  Bake at 350 for 20 min. till slightly brown and remove from oven.
Filling: 6 Cups white sugar, 3/4 cup flour, 2 1/2 Cups lemon juice,16 eggs, 1 T. lemon zest.  Mixed sugar & flour with whisk, added lemon juice, added zest, added the eggs which had been beaten separately.  I beat all for a couple of minutes with a hand mixer, till smooth, no lumps.  This, I divided between the two pans of hot, prepared, baked dough, evenly.  I returned the dishes to the oven and baked them for 30 minutes more, removed from oven, and sprinkled heavily with powdered sugar while still hot, and let cool. They come out of Pyrex very easily. I used 1 1/2 c. fresh squeezed lemon juice and 1 c. bottled because I ran out of lemons.  It came out just wonderful!! Thanks to Patty et al..:)

These Lemon Bars really were the best! I'm genuinely shocked as easy they were to make. I brought them to our weekly meeting and people went for seconds! A little modification for you. I recommend "docking" (or pricking with a fork) the dough before putting it in the oven. Especially if you are using a glass pan (like I did). It's a lot harder to cut when you haven't docked the pastry part. It's also really hard to cut with a knife if it's been refrigerated. I will definitely be making these little treats all Spring/Summer long!

Do not change a thing!!! These are perfect just the way they are.  I put the pan in the fridge to cool over night, they came out of the pan just fine.  It took about 5 mins to cut and get them out of the pan.  I took them to a college lecture and they were gone so fast.  Everyone was talking about how amazing the lemon bars were.  This was my first time making lemon bars and they were just perfect.  There is no need for extra lemon, there is no need for salt in the crust, there is no need for wax paper.  Just follow the instructions as written, watch the video, and be ready for an AMAZING treat.  (when pressing down on dough in the pan, you don't have to smash very hard, just lightly press)

Absolutely delicious!  The shortbread crust is the perfect base for the lemon curd. I used 2/3 cup freshly squeezes meyer lemon juice and 1/3 cup flour for the filling. I also baked the bars for 23 minutes as opposed to 20 minutes.

Loved these!  I think this recipe has just the right balance of tartness and sweetness.  I can't imagine adding any more sugar to this- the crust or the lemon part- it would overpower the senses.  I didn't think it would be lemony enough- but the lemon, as stated in the amounts in the recipe- really comes through well.  I used the juice from two small to medium sized lemons.  Perhaps people who feel this recipe is not lemony enough did not include the LEMON ZEST.  That also makes a difference.  My family is pleased I have added this to my repetoire!

Really good. Definitely use 2/3 c of lemon juice and 1/3 c of flour. The base was a bit on the thick side, but the next day the lemon top and bases melded a bit and it was fine. But you could make the pan smaller and use less base and have a thicker topping if you like them really soft.

This recipe is a great! The crust felt a little bland, so I added some ground graham crackers (3 tablespoons ish) and reduced the flour a tad. I concur with the other reviewers in that an extra juiced lemon goes a long way. Adding lemon zest gives it a nice kick too.

Not sure if I did something wrong or what, but something was weird with how these turned out. the filling didn't set up on the crust, it like soaked through and made a wet cake type thing. BUT they taste sooo good!! 5 stars for taste alone. I'll try again and see if I can't get them to come out looking/feeling right too.

Very good.  I doubled the top and grated some lemon zest in the topping.  Don't use a nonstick pan, you must use a glass pyrex pan to see how dark the crust is getting.

Delicious. Based on reviews I added 1/2 teaspoon salt to the crust, baked it 20 minutes in my 9x13 in pan, let it cool about 10 minutes before assembling the lemony layer (which takes no time to whip up), and I used 2/3 cup lemon juice (2 lemons and lemon juice from a container) and the zest of two lemons (highly recommended), upped the flour in the lemony part to 1/3 cup.  Everything else as stated.  Was HEAVENLY.  So addictive I had to bring it to work because it was dangerously delicious to keep home. :) THANK YOU!!!!

These were absolutely delicious lemon bars.  They were very simple and easy to make.  I juiced two lemons and addded tblsp of lemon juice and they were the perfect tartness.  My entire family LOVED these. THey are very pretty cut into squares and then cut diagonally into triangles.

I added a bit of lemon extract for flavour, and followed the rest exactly. I didn't expect such rave reviews for these! I rarely make things with fruit in them, let alone sour fruits for the family! I had lemons I had to use up, so I made these anyway. I am so glad I did! They were so good that many people at the family gathering could not keep their hands off them, even the kids! Thanks for sharing this recipe, truly a keeper!

These are worth making again.  I found the cooking time needed a bit longer than stated...and I wish the sprinkling of powdered sugar was stated in the recipe.

I followed the suggestions of previous users (filling: 2/3 cup lemon juice, 2 cups sugar, and 1/3 cup flour with 4 eggs) and these bars turned out great!! the filling is nice and tart and not too sweet. I know others said their crust came out too buttery but mine came out perfect. i would recommend to add 1/4 tsp salt the crust though. definitely a keeper!!

AWESOME!! I just pulled my second batch out of the oven. The first time we didn't have enough butter so I used only a stick and a half. The crustturned out fine. Now I'm about to try it with two sticks of butter!!!! :)

Oh, these are yummy. The recipe calls for the juice of 2 lemons, well my 2 lemons were huge and gave me 1 full cup of juice. I used the whole cup in my recipe and I think that may be why these really are The Best Lemon Bars. So tangy in the middle, sweet, buttery, crumbly crust. Yummy. (P.S. 14 year old son gave them two thumbs up).

I did not care for this recipe. The crust needed about a Tablespoon of water (one could use lemon juice instead), it also needed lemon zest to truly have the rich lemon flavor for it to be "the best lemon bar recipe!" And the color was also lacking; I added two to three drops of yellow food color.

best lemon bars I have ever made. I even took them to a very fussy friends house for a party and she complains about everything and she loved them..I did add more lemon a personal preference andI knew my friend would agree too.I used  5/8 cup lemon juice and I also used the rind of 1 lemon in the crust .I baked it in a smaller pan 11x 8 so filling was perfect.In my opinion I didnt think it made to much crust. Next time I make it I am going to add 1/4 cup crushed macadamia nuts to the crust as well. I think it would go good together.

Loved, loved, loved these!  Made this with only minor adjustments.  I like a good level of tartness, so I used the juice of 3 lemons instead of 2 and bumped the flour from 1/4 to 1/3 cup to account for the added liquid.  PERFECT...except for the too thick crust.  This will definitely be my go-to recipe from now on, but I'll cut the crust ingredients by 1/3 and keep the added lemon juice and flour to get that tartness just right!

These were easy to make and had great lemon flavor.  Having an actual measurement for lemon juice would be better than just saying the juice of 2 lemons.  I used 1/3 cup juice because that is just generally what I get from 2 lemons, after many trials and measurings.  That amount seemed to give me the perfect balance of the tart, sweet, and buttery that I was looking for in a lemon bar.

I did increase the lemon to 1/2 cup and added the lemon zest of one lemon.  (its all a matter of taste..I like a strong but not too strong lemon bar) Seriously the best lemon bars I have ever had!  Even better than the high priced lemon bars I bought at a specialty shop in MI that I thought for years were the best (until this recipe)  Fiance said it is his favorite dessert ever.

This is one of my favorite recipies, and a big hit with the people I cook for on occasion. Though there are two edits I've found make it much better.

First off: double the lemon juice. Two lemons worth just doesn't seem to pack enough zing for those of us who love tart food.

And second: Once the crust is done, take it out, put it somewhere to cool for ten to fifteen minutes, then pour the filling in and put it back in the oven for the 20 minutes. I started doing this by accident and it seems to keep the crust from separating or getting too crisp. As well as stopping that strange effect where the filling burns on the edges of the glass dish.

'course, if you don't HAVE these problems... feel free to ignore this, heh.

Delish!  Rich and buttery crust. I did not change a thing!  I microwaved the lemons to draw out more juice and the two lemons provided a half cup of juice.  I would write more but I have to go eat another one.

I noticed that lemon is one of those ingredients that when added to a recipe, one person might think it is too sweet and the next person might think it was too tart, so I didn't place too much emphasis on others' suggestions when it came to whether is was too tart or too sweet - I only experimented and made it to my liking. I made it per the written recipe and then after tasting, realized it needed a bit more lemon flavor.  I ended up using 1/2 cup of lemon juice and also added the lemon zest of about 2 lemons. This gave it the "punch" I personally felt it needed. Other than that, I used 1 tsp. of salt in the crust layer. they went fast at a BBQ I attended, and pointed a couple of ladies to this Website for the recipe. A good recipe - thanks for sharing!

I wish I would have read the reviews and doubled the lemon filling as there was too much crust, compared to filling and no lemony enough. That's why I gave the lower rating.

Omg these are amazing !! 
if you get confused by different reviews suggesting different amount of lemon juice . i say go with your instinct ,with wht you think you'll like . I for example love tarty lemon sour taste so 2/3 cup was great for me . My brothers couldn't eat a peace without squinting their eyes . So you know your family and what they like, go from their . And oh ! if you like the taste of mint and lemon combination.  add 1 TBS of  finely chopped mint . it does wonders to the taste and the appearance of your bars  .

I made these in a Pampered Chef bar pan which I buttered. Then I mixed the 2 c. flour, 1 c. butter and 1/2 c. sugar in a food processor. Poured the crumbs into the pan and spread evenly before pressing down. I *doubled* the filling, using both lemon and lime juice and zest. Baked for 25 minutes. Perfection! Compliments all around. My daughter is licking her plate! UPDATE: I made this again, using the same crust technique. I baked the crust for 20 minutes. While that was baking I mixed up the filling, which I doubled, in the food processor. (No need to clean the left-over crust crumbs out.) First I put in 8 eggs and pulsed. Then I added the 3 c. of sugar with the processor running. Next I added the zest and juice of 2 lemons, plus an additional 9 T. of bottled lemon juice. (Taste and see if it's tart enough.) Then I added 1/2 c. plus 2-3 T of flour. I baked it for an additional 20 minutes. UPDATE: Next time I'll only add the 1/2 c. flour and bake for 15 minutes in an attempt to get a looser filling.

i have tried at least 4 other recipes and was about to give up but i saw this one rated so highly i figured id give it one more try, im glad i did!! i had left over lard from pie crusts so i used that instead of butter...everyone raved at how tasty the crust was and said they were even better then "moms". i went ahead and did 5 lemons as others suggested (and omitted the salt..i never add salt to any of my baking) take the 28,000 of us reviewers...dont look anywhere else...these are fabulous!! id give it 20 stars if i could : )

Fantastic! The crust is absolute perfection, light and buttery and just the right amount of sweetness. For the filling, I followed the advice of other reviewers and used the juice of 3 lemons (about 2/3 cup) and the zest of 2. You really do need that much if you want that nice tart flavor of the lemon to come through, which is how lemon bars should be. If you prefer it mild, then the original recipe will work.

Quick, easy, and delicious! I used other's suggestions and added more lemon to it which made it PERFECT lemony taste! I like mine to have a bit more kick to it. The only complaint was a a bit to sugary. We don't like our sweets TOO sweet. So I think I will cut down the sugar next time in the crust a bit and a bit more in the lemon mixture! :) Will be using this from now on!! I am hoping to make it a bit more healthier by making it with egg whites, wheat flour, and adding flaxseed!

These turned out PERFECT! I was totally amazed since my husband made them (and he rarely ever cooks). We couldn't stop eating them and even impressed our dinner guests. 
Tips: Use a GLASS pan (not metal) to avoid a common metal-ish aftertaste. And sprinkle w/ powdered sugar soon after removing from the oven so it sticks (no one likes to breath it in).

These lemon bars are amazing! I didn't even think I would like them since I made them for someone else and I'm wasn't even a big fan of lemon bars. As it turned out I'm the one who ended up eating almost all of them...hehe... they are addicting!

Instead of squares, I used this exact recipe as a warm lemon tart. Simple and delicious - my definition of elegance in a dessert.  I recommend using juice of at least three lemons as other reviewers suggested. I used a round tart dish and garnished with a couple sprigs of lemon verbena (didn't have mint on hand) - next time I'll make a raspberry coulis to drizzle across the top.

This is a fabulous (and not too sweet) lemon bar, was easy to make and turned out just like the picture. Made this for the first time and found the crust to be a little thick, will sub graham crust next time. I also added some lemon zest for some extra zing. Definitely will make this again!

Great...increasing to 2/3 c lemon juice plus 1 T flour for the topping made it a 5 star.  And I agree with using the 9x12 instead of 11x13 with a slightly increased baking time...make sure the crust is just beginning to brown and the custard is set.

DELICIOUS! I used about 2/3 cup of concentrated lemon juice since I had no lemons and added an extra tablespoon of flour to the filling...also added a pinch of salt to the crust...Baked in an 8x8 pan for about 25 mins each time (more of an equal crust to filling ratio). They were great coming right out of the oven and also great the next day after they had sat in the fridge all night and the filling had thickened up

It was my first time ever baking lemon bars and they worked out perfectly, not to sour not to sweet. The crust had a few little burns on the corners but other then that, they were amazing and I got many compliments ! They don't turn out as pretty as the picture but they sure did taste great ! Also, very straight forward instructions, I was not confused at all and everything worked out great, forsure using this recipe again, I dont even want to try another one :)

This was good.  Next time, I will keep the crust recipe, cook it longer than 15mins, and double the actual lemon recipe.  My only issue is that it's really mushy when cut up.  I think this is due to the crust not being in the oven long enough.

The lemon portion of these bars was absolutely perfect in flavor. Nice and tart. I, like many others, used 2/3 cup lemon juice. I wish I had added a little more flour to compensate for the added liquid because my bars didn't firm up as tightly as I wanted. Other than that these were so delicious! I love the shortbread crust too.

I have tried ALL of the most highly rated lemon bar recipes on this site & this one is by far my favorite and my hubby agrees.  As another member suggested, I use 3 lemons to make it more tart (& add an extra 1T of flour as well so that it isn't runny w/ the extra juice).  These are better than my mother used to make which I didn't think was possible, sorry mom.

I made this exactly as written and they turned out great.  I had some confusion over 2 lemons juiced since lemons come in diffrent sizes, so I took some others suggestions and measured out 1/2 cup of lemon juice..... which was 4 small lemons.  Topped with powdered sugar!  Yummy!

I like the lemon filling ( I use 2/3 cups of lemon juice) but my oven is too hot, so I should reduce the baking time next time. My crust is too hard. Anyway, I will try to do it again next time.

I always try every recipe at least 2x; once the way its written and the second time, with any changes I felt were needed so I can compare.  This is a great recipe BUT..it DOES need some changes...sorry! The crust is just TOO thick. EVen after it cooled in the original. The crust was almost thicker than the lemon. Maybe some people like that, but we wanted to taste more of the lemon. The shortbred itself is outstanding-just halve the recipe for the crust (Which is what we did the 2nd time) or double the lemon ingredients.  I also used 3 whole lemons and zested all 3 the second time around. They werent very juicy so I did also supplement with concentarted lemon juice to make 3/4 cup. It was PERFECT. Much more tart than the original recipe. I also used 3 eggs and that made it a little thicker second time around.  All in all a great basic recipe that you can tweak as you see fit.

OMG these are the best!!!!  I've never wanted lemon bars.  But, I made these and they were the best thing ever.  The only modification that was made is to just add the zest also from the two lemons.  These will hurt you you have to push them away.

Great taste-- I ended up using 1/4 cup orange juice and 1/2 cup lemon juice and some cinnamon to fit the hoildays. But the filling is just so thin! I think I would want to try a smaller pan, or maybe somehow double the filling? It doesn't look done at all, but it is and tastes good. I don't know, maybe the orange juice doesn't work as well as I'd like. But thanks for sharing!

Delicious.  I followed the advice of others and put in 1/3 c. flour and 2/3 c. lemon juice.  It can out perfect!  MUCH better than the recipe I tried last night that was down right yucky.  Mine came out of the pan without any problems and set up perfectly.

This is a great recipe! I received rave reviews of the fresh lemon taste and creamy texture from my guests. As written this recipe is outstanding, adding the lemon zest as others suggested makes it extraordinary! My two lemons produced somewhere between 1/2 and 2/3 cups of juice which was just perfect. I will definitely be making these again!

I made this in a slightly smaller pan than the 9x13. They came out nice and thick but a bit too much for me. I am now making a second batch in the pan size called for the recipe. I do like the flavors, I did add some lemon zest from about 1 1/2-2 lemons to the filling. I also used 2 big lemons and 1 regular sized lemon that equaled to 2/3 cup of juice. This was perfect, because I like it on the tart side. I did add a pinch of popcorn salt when making the crust. Popcorn salt is very fine and blends easily. When the bars cooled I took a mesh strainer with some powdered sugar and sifted it over the top.

Oh my GOODNESS!  You MUST make these Lemon Bars because they really are the BEST!  I will never make another lemon bar recipe - this is THE ONE!  Thanks to MommyFromSeattle's review, I used just over 1/2 cup of fresh squeezed lemon juice and an extra tbsp of flour.  I baked these in an 8X12 pan and used about 2/3 of the dough for the crust, and then after they'd baked for a little while, I crumbled the other 1/3 of the crust on top.  SOO good!  I also added 1/2 tsp salt to the crust mixture and it was phenomenal!

Very good!  I followed other's suggestions to up the lemon juice (to about 3/4 cup or 5 lemons, which will make a very tart bar but that's the way I like it) plus the increased flour to balance it out (1/3 cup).  Added the 1/4 tsp. of salt.  Added the zest of 2 lemons.  In the end I increased the ingredients by 50% and made it in my lasagna pan, and I thought the thickness of the bar was perfect this way.  I also baked the bottom part first for at least 25 minutes (kept my eye on it until the edges were browned), cooled it, then added the lemon custard and baked it for at least 25 minutes, eying it again to see when it looked ready (slightly browned on the top).  Next time I'll copy down the exact amount of time it took so I'll know for next time.

I finally found the perfect lemon bar recipe! Thanks to MommyFromSeattle's suggestion of using 2/3 c lemon juice it provided the right about of tart in the custard and the sweet buttery, goodness of the crust! I have already made these bars twice and have already been giving out the recipe to those who requested it. Thanks!

WOW yummy! I used a smaller pan (7x10ish I think) so increased the cooking time a bit accordingly, and used the juice from 3 lemons instead of 2. Everything else I did as written, and these are absolutely wonderful! I put them in the fridge to harden a little faster because I wanted to try them! Absolutely wonderful!

These are fabulous.  I like my lemon bars tart, so I used 1/2 c fresh lemon juice. It wasn't too tart, or too sweet - a nice balance.  I also decided to use an 8x8 square pan and I made sure to coat it generously with PAM before baking.  And because I used a smaller pan, I didn't quite use all the crust, and cooked it a tish longer because the crust was thicker in the smaller pan.  The crust is pretty wet and gooey but don't worry, it comes out great. My crust was brown on the sides but a very light golden color in the middle and that worked out just great.  I let the crust cool completely before pouring in the filling and they came out just wonderfully. I took them out when the middle was not longer "jiggly". I didn't experience the strong "eggy" smell several people have remarked about.  They were just delicious - a definite keeper!

These are the best lemon bars. I won't be using any other recipe ever again. I don't like recipes that you had to look through 200 reviews to find the changes to make the recipe work. This one works as written and is delicious. 

I made these last night as a surprise for my husband. He likes sweets in moderation, but went crazy for these lemon bars and ate 3 in one sitting. He said they looked and tasted like a bakery had made them.

I have tried recipes and had the crust crumbles apart when serving, or had the curd taste like sweet goo not lemons, or worse, had the curd harden like scrambled eggs. The crust was like shortbread, firm and crunchy like a cookie (not a cracker), very tender and short. The topping was the perfect lemon curd consistency, nice and gooey, but not runny. They were nice combination of tart and sweet, just like lemonade.  

I changed nothing about the recipe, except that I used butter flavored Crisco instead of butter because that is a substitution I always make and I greased the pan so they wouldn't stick.

As for lemons, I picked 3 good sized lemons from the tree, zested and juiced them. I had about 1/2 cup of fresh lemon juice. I pulled the bars out when the center no longer jiggled and that was perfect. 

These are the best lemon bars I have ever made or eaten.

WOW!  Just made these and they are SO good.  I did make a couple of adjustments based on other reviews.  Here's what I did:  I kept them in a 9 x 13 pan but greased it.  I don't know if it was necessary but my bars didn't stick.  I followed the crust directions but added a LITTLE bit of salt even though I used salted butter.  I baked the crust just until it started to brown and then let cool completely.  I did have to bake for a bit more than the 20 minutes in the recipe.    

For the filling I used 1/2 cup of fresh lemon juice.  Two lemons would not have been very much but I used small lemons.  I increased the flour to 1/3 cup to compensate for the extra lemon juice. I went to removed the bars after baking 20 minutes and the center seemed like it was not set at all so I baked for another 5.  

These set up nicely and the crust was perfect.  They were still yummy the next day.  I agree that they smell a bit eggy when they come out of the oven but don't taste that way at all, especially when cool.  I can't wait to make them again!

These bars were a hit with me & my family at Easter. They were easier to make then I thought - I made them in two steps: I made the crust in the morning and I made the filling later in the afternoon. This allowed the crust to cool completely. I used a bit more fresh lemon juice, so I used a pinch more flour. I sifted some powdered sugar on top, delicious.

NO.  The directions are NOT for a beginner even though this recipe could be considered very basic.  Even I know that its not really calling for 1/12 of anything.  Also, if you follow this recipe, PLEASE follow the gal who posted before me and her suggestions.  I threw the first batch away!  All in all, try another recipe.

I, as well, had to cook the crust for an additional five minutes or so, and I used 3/4 Cup lemon juice (fresh squeezed) as well.

The only reason I did not give this five stars is because I had to bake my custard for nearly 45 minutes (I baked it for the 20 as written, then let it sit in the firdge over night, but it was still all liquidly, nearly water-like!). I then baked it for another 14 minutes and it turned out well, but the edges had gotten a bit crusty, so I just cut them away. But after all that the bars turned out fabulously.

Although, it did seem like my crust puffed up a bit too much for my liking, I'd prefer a smaller crust, like only 1/6 of an inch, so I shall use less of the crust next time (and there WILL be a next time!).

Made these for a cookie platter and they outshown all my other baking. A great recipe. However,  I saved some for family and we found that, the second day, the base was soft and the cookies not as great. Guess I need to keep making these on the day I want to serve them.

These were better than store bought lemon bars and very easy. I took other reviewers' advice, and used 2/3 cup lemon juice (didn't have real lemons so used Real Lemon juice) 1/3 c. flour (dumped that in first, then slowly stirred in liquids), and also added 1/4 tsp of salt to the crust. I ran out of normal white sugar, so I also added 1/2 c of brown sugar. It didn't discolor them at all and they were extremely tasty! It did take about 25 minutes to bake. I found the lemon flavor is slightly stronger the second day. Also, I found the powdered suger did dissolve into the bars a bit but they were still good. With the variations, the bars appealed to a wide range of tastes (not to tart or too sweet). I took them to our church gathering and got many complements. Only a couple small pieces were left, which my husband and I enjoyed today!

OMG These were SO GOOD!! 
I changed it as others suggested. 

1/4 tsp salt (to crust)
6 T instead of 4 T (to filling)
2/3 C. Lemon juice (instead, to filling)
1 T lemon zest
These were perfect! The crust was perfect for the 9 X 13, the lemon flavor was perfect, everything was PERFECT!

I have had much better lemon bars.  I won't bother wasting my ingredients on these again.  Followed the recipe to a T. They were not runny (actually sat up quite well) but the flavor just was not there.  Sorry.

Egghh... well, I used 3/4 cup butter and 3/4 cup sugar as one review said for the bottom part.. didn't taste too good. and the lemon part wasn't too chewy, either. I also used 5 tablespoons of the lemon juice stuff from the grocery stores... someone said it tasted like lemon 'bread', not bars... if you decide to use this recipe, add a lot more lemon juice so the flavor comes out. also, use probably 1/2 - 2/3 of the bottom batter part that they call for, because mine was waaay too thick. double the lemon part also. Oh, and if right after you take it out of the oven and it doesn't taste too good, let it cool, because it tastes much better when cooled.  However, I am still looking for the perfect lemon bar recipe that has gooey lemon filling.

Wonderful recipe. I did reduce the butter in the crust to 3/4 and increased the sugar in the crust to 3/4. It came out perfectly. I got 5 tbs. of juice from 2 large lemons. I recommend adding a little lemon zest to the filling for even more "lemony" taste.

Wow! wonderful, and so easy to make! No mess with dishwashing, not much ingredients called for, and such a wonderful taste! amazing. Will definitely make them again, many times. P.S: after juicing the lemons, I measured the juice: I got 6 tablespoons, and the bars were lemony, but not overtangy.

Easiest to make lemon bar recipe I have ever made.  My son loved them.  This recipe lacks the lemon zest that other recipes generally call for.  Definitely, I would consider making this recipe again, but I would add lemon zest.  The crust was a little too moist, I prefer the crust to be a litter crisper.

I made these for a party at work, and I got a lot of good feedback.  I did have some dissenters-- those who prefer a tangier lemon bar, but otherwise this was perfect.  I substituted 5 tbs. lemon juice for the squeezed lemon and put a little more sugar in the crust.  I imagine that you would add more lemon juice for a tangier filling------.

These bars were delicious. I used 5 tablespoons of lemon juice instead of 2 lemons, as someone else who tried these suggested. It worked great! I will definitly make these again.

I baked this colorful treat for Easter and everyone loved these. I especially like the tip on making green tinted lime bars and displaying the treats in a checker board fasion.
I added 1 drop of yellow food coloring to the lemon bars to give them a more vibrant color.   Next time I make these I will double the recommended lemon (and/or lime) juice because I think they would be even better with more tartness to them.

We are very experienced bakers and were slightly disappointed with this recipe (the way it was written). For example, 'the juice of two lemons' was very vague and confusing. We were not sure what size lemons to use or how much juice we were supposed to get out of them. We used 3 medium sized lemons and found the lemon flavor satisfying to our lemon cravings! Other than that, we baked as the recipe said and then dusted with powdered sugar when warm. I would recommend cooling the crust before adding the filling on top. Some amateur bakers may make that mistake and end up cracking the crust. We enjoyed this recipe very much and found it divine! 9/10 would recommend to try! We will be sharing these around the company!

I love tangy lemony squares without too much crust. So In order to perfect these I made the following changes: use a 9x13 pan, and  keep crust same except add 1/4 teaspoon of salt to it. Prepare 1.5x  the filling ingredients except lemon- maybe a tad more flour for firmness due to the extra liquid added, I use  1 cup of  lemon juice in this amount of filling. I also added zest of 1 lemon (optional). I found this to be the best ratio of sweet to tangy, crust to filling, and they are firm on the outside but gooey on the inside. Definitely cut after refrigerating overnight and then use a clean knife dipped in hot  water for clean edges.

Let me start by saying I'm a terrible cook and elementary baker.  These were phenomenal. The cooking time is dead on with 20 minutes for the bottom. For the lemon juice I used two large lemons, cut them lengthwise and stuck a fork in them moving it back and forth as I squeezed the lemon halves. I didn't measure what it yielded(probably should have) but I did make sure to do this in a separate bowl so I could fish out the few seed pieces that came out.  Since I'm not Betty Crocker I didn't have the right size pan either. I used an 11x7 pan but had no issues. My only regret was not sprinkling confectioners sugar over the top so they looked as pretty as the other photos. A+ recipe!

Just made a double batch of these for the first time tonight and they turned out to be amazing! The original recipe- no adjustments- produced at least 25 irresistible, melt-in-your-mouth squares. The only recommendation I have is that after I let them cool (about 20-30 minutes), I put them in the refrigerator right away. This helps them firm up. I also dusted them with a little powdered sugar before serving. I will definitely be making these again!

This recipe was absolutely delicious. Best lemon bars I've ever had, and my family said the same. However, I cut the recipe in half and somehow forgot to cut the lemon juice in half. I would definitely recommend doubling the lemons to achieve that taste. (It doesn't make it sour) I would definitely recommend this recipe.

I've been making these lemon bars for a couple of years now and just want to say, Patty Schenk, you're a genius!  Other than having to adjust the cooking time a bit for MY oven, the only thing I do even slightly different is add just a touch of salt to the egg and lemon juice mixture.  As is, though, these are FAR AND AWAY the best lemon bars EVER.  I get nothing but compliments and use them as my 'go to' whenever I need to bring something sweet that people think is really complicated to make.  Ha!  Joke's on them.  These are super easy, delicious and will give you the reputation as a genius you probably don't deserve.

I baked the crust for 5 mins longer than suggested. I added 1 extra lemon in aswell. I made mine in a 9x13 baking dish, and found there was the same amount of filling to crust ratio, and I prefer more filling. I would suggest doubling the filling if using a 9x13. All together a very good recipe, will make again using more filling next time. Thumbs up!

Very yummy. It's true that, although it goes against my instinct, it's better for these to be slightly overlooked than undercooked. Next time, I will make them in a 9x9 pan so they are thicken. 1/2 tsp salt in the crust is good. 3 lemons are good too.

A delicious, easy lemon bar - I added 1/4 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract to the crust, sprayed the 9 x 13 pan with cooking spray, and cooled the crust (under the ceiling fan) before adding the filling. I used 1/3 cup flour and 2/3 cup fresh lemon juice for the filling and added the zest of two lemons. Dip knife in hot water before cutting the cooled bars.

These are my go-to lemon bars. The only issue I have is that the crust tends to be thicker than the lemon part and "drowns out" the lemony flavor which is the best bit! So I could see like "three-quartering" the crust recipe or doubling the lemon part if you like them more lemony.

These are awesome!  The only change I made was that I used 2/3 cup fresh squeezed lemon juice and added  1 tbsp more of flour to the lemon mixture as well as some lemon zest.  It turned out amazing and everyone loved them.  This recipe is definitely a keeper for me!

I took suggestions from other reviewers and added 1/4 teaspoon of salt to the crust (glad I did), microwaved the lemons for 15 seconds to get more juice (glad I did) and used 2/3 cup of juice (glad I did- but probably could have increased the sugar a smidge to compensate for how tart it was) that being said- my husband loved the tartness, and wouldn't have had me change it.

This has been my "go to" bar for years.  At one time it came under the name "lemon love notes" but exactly the same ingredients.  I have also, being extra sinful, topped them with lemon cream cheese frosting. yum yum. Highly recommend

Loved the crust!  Will add more lemon for our taste.  Used 6 T. lemon juice and didn't have the tang that we crave.  Minor for an easy, go-to recipe.  Finish with powdered sugar on top.  Thanks!

Followed the recipe- the crust was perfect.  The filling was a little too sweet and gooey for me.  Will try with less sugar for the filling next time and perhaps more flour?

These lemon bars are absolutely delicious! I made these for my mom's birthday because she loves lemon bars. No one else in the family does but they all agreed that these were amazing and the bars were gone way too soon. If you LOVE lemon flavor, add more lemon juice. Instead of juicing two lemons, I used 1/4 cup lemon juice that I bought. They weren't extremely lemonly, so just add lemons to match your taste.

These were really good. I like a strong lemon bite so I increased lemon juice and added zest into the crust and the topping. Delicious! Added powdered sugar to the the top once the bars cooled, then cut into squares. Very refreshing dessert.

I liked this recipe, but made a few tweeks.   As a previous reviewer suggested, adding the 1/4 teaspoon salt to the dough gives it flavor.  Also, you cannot pat this dough into a 9x13 pan without having an uneven crust.  I would suggest three things:  first, chill the dough for 20 minutes prior to baking.  Second, line the pan with parchment.  Third, take the dough out of the refrigerator and let rest for 10 minutes prioor to rolling between two sheets of parchment.  This will enable you to achieve an even rectangle cemmensurate wit the pan size--it also makes it easier to fit the dough into the pan!  Bake dough 20 minutes and let cool to room temperature.   I like a lot of lemon, so I found using only 3 lemons did not equal 2/3 cup (another reviewer also suggested using 2/3 cup).  I used smaller lemons, which equates to 5 or 6 lemons.

I used 1/2 cup of lemon juice.  It  was about 3 large lemons.  I sprinkled with powered sugar too.   This was an easy recipe and everyone loved it.  I will definitely make this again.

The lemon filling was really good not too tart and not too sweet but it wasn't enough.  The squares were very thin. Also I would make less crust because it was almost as thick as the filling.

I haven't had too too many lemon bars in my life, but I agree--these are the best I've had!

We had an abnormally hot day in April that made me really crave summery things--so when an office birthday presented itself as an opportunity for me to break out the bakeware, I decided on making lemon bars.

These lemon bars were pretty amazing.  I made a few changes to the recipe, based on the reviews:

- FILLING: I used the juice of 3 lemons (about 3/4 cups), added zest from two of those lemons, and added a little more flour to the filling.  Even though I used more lemon juice and the same amount of sugar, I found that the filling was still a little too sweet for my taste.

- CRUST: I added a pinch of salt to the crust--though the crust was still semi tasteless for me.  I think I may add some extra lemon zest to the shortbread (from the last lemon), and maybe a little pinch of vanilla or ginger or something to give a little spice and warmth.  I also think I'd transfer the extra sugar from the filling into the crust.

This recipe makes about a 1:1 ratio of crust to filling; so, if you like that, then follow this recipe!  If you like more filling, then scale up the filling!  I baked in an 8x8 dish, which made some pretty fat lemon bars -_-  still, they were tasty!

Dust with powdered sugar on top--mMmmMm!!! :)

This recipe is super simple and the bars turn out perfect every time.  We use it as a quick, go-to dessert for pot lucks and other gatherings.

Worst lemon bar I've ever made. I have in fact made lemon bars over 20 times because their my favorite and I usually try diff recipes for fun. The crust was too thick, the amount of lemon juice wasn't listed, the lemon topping itself was not gooey and yummy. Everything about this is awful.

I tried this recipe out last night. Changes: Used a square pan because there wasn't enough dough to cover a rectangular pan easily (it was probably too big). Used the juice of 2.5 lemons and the zest of 1 lemon. I like it tart, creamy and not too sweet. Baked the crust 20 minutes. Baked with the custard another 20 minutes. It turned out PERFECT by God's grace. It's been difficult to keep my husband away from them. Note - I live in Colorado and I've been told that affects baking times. Though I've not noticed any significant changes to be honest. Excellent, excellent recipe. Will make this many times.

Despite what she said about no substitutions, I had to use 1/4 cup of bottled lemon juice instead of real lemons. I feel terrible... I just committed a big "No-No" in the eyes of all you cooks. I also added a half cup of oatmeal to the crust and saved some crust to sprinkle over the top of the bars before baking. That provided a nice crunchy topping. Coat these with sifted powdered sugar for that bakery effect! Even with my bottled lemon juice, these were very tasty!

Simple and yummy. After reading other reviewer suggestions, I did the following: I used 2/3 cup fresh lemon juice (and an extra 1 tbs of flour into the filling mix to counter the extra liquid) and added the zest into the crust. I added a pinch of salt into the crust mix as well. 
I'm not one for altering a recipe and then reviewing it, but I feel like the recipe as written is more of a "base". If you want a more lemon-y flavor, you'll need to up the amount of juice. If you prefer a more toned down lemon, than 2 large lemons should do it. It's a great base recipe to build from. I made a batch and the entire pan disappeared..which is saying something considering there were just 5 of us eating them. :)

great lemon topping, I loved that part, I had to double the topping because, in my opinion top was too thin. The base got a little too hard for my taste, and too thick. I would make a thinner bottom and a thicker top.

Awesome! Took them to the office and my co-workers raved about them. I used bottled lemon juice and it worked great. Just the right balance of sweet and tart. You will thoroughly enjoy these bars.

I made these lemon bars with the zest added to the crust and the eggs/lemon mixture,I also used 3/4c of lemon juice from the lemons as recommended by others and I sprinkled with icing sugar after cooking as well. I found the cooking time far to long,it burnt the bottom of my crust,I also found the lemon mixture not creamy or custard like but gummy in composition.I did enjoy the lemon taste but it was hard to tell if they were truly good due to the burnt bottom. I would recommend cooking the base crust less than 20-25minutes,next time I make them I will add either cream or cream cheese to the egg mixture and cook the base less.I would give this recipe a 2.5/5 stars.

This lemon bar recipe is excellent.  I had many complements on them.  It really makes a difference when you use fresh lemons instead of just the lemon juice.

All of us loved these bars! I did use 3 lemons instead of 2 and added an extra tbsp of flour to the filling mixture because of the extra lemon juice. These were truly incredible and the cookie bottom was perfection! Don't forget to sift powdered sugar on top after they cool down (wasn't noted in recipe). Will definitely make these again!

Very good. I added some lemon zest also as suggested by others. Was a big hit at a meeting at my home. I also added a simple powdered sugar glaze on top...powdered sugar and milk with a dash of vanilla. Simple too.

I thought the flavor was wonderful. How do you get the top lemon layer stick better to the bottom layer. Mine was two separate layers...but still very good.

I used the zest of the lemons, and sprinkled powdered sugar on top, and brought them to work. I was called a crack dealer by my coworkers who were so sad when they were all gone, and as my boyfriend's favorite dessert they were the best he'd ever had. Thank you!

I have now made this recipe twice without any variations. It still came out delicious. You might think that 2 lemons are not enough, but it is. I gave this recipe to a friend, and she thought that and doubled the juice of lemon. She said it was too over powering. I believe that you need to stick to this recipe AS IS. It's delicious and the family loved it.

These are great. I made these for a end of a school year party and my friends literally licked the tray. 
My recommendation with partys cut them into lemon bar bites also, make sure to cook them long enough because it will turn gloppy. But overall they are great

These really are fantastic lemon bars. Classic, simple and really, really good. I have made this exactly as written, and with added zest of the 2 lemons in the filling. Both are excellent- if you add the lemon zest, the flavour is a little more tart and lemony. 


With or without the lemon zest, just make sure you use real lemon juice. It makes ALL the difference in this recipe- bottled lemon juice just is not the same.

I began eating gluten free a few months ago and baking has been a challenge.  I substituted the flour for a gluten free flour blend. It worked perfect and they were really delicious.  The only other substitution was to add a couple drops of yellow food coloring.

Excellent flavor and texture. I didn't increase the lemon juice, but did sprinkle the zest of the two lemons on top before baking the top layer. I completely forgot to dust with powdered sugar, but they tasted great plain.

I made this for a bake sale and it was the first thing to sell out. I used 1/2c lemon juice and some lemon zest (maybe 1/2 T) and the tartness came out perfect.  The lemon mix absorbed a bit into the crust which created a beautiful consistency

Made these for a rehearsal and everyone LOVED them!  I have a Meyer lemon tree in my yard, so I used one of those in the recipe - 2/3 cup of juice from one fruit!  Added extra flour to the filling and it baked up perfectly.  Might try addition of salt to crust, but I was perfectly happy with no salt.  I used an 8"x12" glass baking pan and the thickness of the crust and filling were pretty equal.  Did have to bake the crust almost twice as long though.  No problem getting the bars out of the pan once I ran a knife along the edge first.  I will make these again and again.

Increase filling by half, decrease crust by half, and add a pinch of salt to crust.

These are very tasty, but I halved the crust recipe and it still had more crust to lemon filling ration than I would have liked. 1:1  This being said, the crust came out great.  Next time, I will double the lemon and half the crust.

Mmmmmm.  I followed the recipe and reviewers comments with 2/3 cup fresh lemon juice (5 small lemons) and zest from 2 lemons.  Also I made it in an 8 x 11 pan lined with parchment paper and baked longer.   Somehow I was surprised when they came out of the oven as the top had a thin crust.  But after cooling I dusted with powdered sugar and cut them. Wow, these are beautiful, fresh, tangy, and delicious!!

Super easy & super yummy! I made mine extra tart just the way I like them (2/3 cup fresh lemon juice) & they came out great. Next time I'll try to make the crust a little thinner or maybe a little less butter but the recipe works just the way it is :-)

Awesome recipe! Followed the recipe but added 1/2 tsp of salt, used 1/4 cup less butter, and added a 1/4 cup of water to ease mixing since I don't have a mixer. For the lemon mixture, I used an extra lemon and a bit more sugar. I also had to go longer on the crust/mixture time, 25 minutes for each. Doing all that, it came out great! I would recommend rubbing some oil on the bottom/sides of the pan though, I did the bottom of the pan only, and the sides stuck.

While it is an easy recipe to follow, my opinion is that this recipe makes too much crust for a 13"x9" pan. I agree with other reviewers that '2 lemons, juiced' is too vague for me. I guesstimated how much liquid that would be and added more. The filling tasted/felt great but was too thin for me. I like it to be at least 1/2" thick. I also might like to add some lemon zest to help the lemon flavor.
This is an easy starter recipe to do some minor tweaking according to one's tastes  :)

Awesome recipe!  I made a couple of tweaks to it though.  First, I used an 8x11 glass pan instead of my 13x9.  I like my lemon bars a little thicker, but I think if you were to double the recipe you would get nice thick bars in a 13x9 pan.  Since I used a smaller pan, I had to add about 5-10min on to each baking section.  Second, for the lemon custard, I like my lemon bars really lemony.  I only had small lemons so I only managed to get 1/2cup of lemon juice.  So I also zested two of the lemons, and added about 2tspns of lemon extract.  They came out nice and tart, but also a little sweet, and the shortbread crust came out awesome.  I would also suggest letting it cool, and then popping in the fridge to help the custard solidify before serving.  I can't stop eating them!  Delicious!

These were pretty good! Mine just weren't lemony enough even though I used fresh juice from four lemons. Lemon bars always seem too eggy to me.

Made mine with Gluten-free flour. Very yummy! I probably will cut back on the sugar and butter next time and maybe add a little lemon juice and zest to crust.

taking the hint from reviewers, I made these with 2/3 cup lemon juice, zest of one lemon and one extra Tbs flour in the custard.  Very, very good!  May add an extra egg yolk next time.  Will try for a very thin sidewall next.

The crust is very good but the lemon filling is not very lemon-y. I found them very sweet and wishing that they had more of a lemon flavor. Kind of need a stronger lemon flavor for lemon bars. Thanks for the recipe.

OMG! Delicious, so delicious that my husband said Thank You for dessert honey:)  They taste just like the description. I did add a little lemon zest just for extra freshness and used a square brownie pan for extra thickness.

I Love it!
this was my first time attempting to make these lemon bars and they turned out amazing!
I followed other users suggestions and juiced 3 lemons instead of 2.
Highly recommend!

My mother in law and I made these bars for Superbowl and they were wonderful, however we added a lemon glaze to the top of the bars by mixing powdered sugar and fresh lemon juice, it added just a little more lemon flavor and we enjoyed every bite...:-)

I used a 1/2 cup of lemon juice but it still wasn't quite enough.  It needed more kick, more tart, more sour faced goodness to balance out the sweetness.  Also, I think 20 min was a bit too long, I would have preferred the lemon bit more curd-y and key lime pie-y. This recipe is close but not quite the one.

Truly the best lemon bars I've ever had. I use between 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup lemon juice as recommended by other reviewers. (This is a way more accurate way to describe how much lemon you'll need- perhaps the only flaw in the recipe.) I use a food processor for the crust. Mine usually comes out fine, but if yours doesn't hold together (it could be the humidity or how you measured the flour), you can add one egg or just a yolk for easier handling characteristics.

Anyway: the BEST lemon bars ever.

the crust is a bit soggy. I doubled the recipe as suggested, used the juice of 3 lemons, added flour to the custard, and added the lemon rind. the custard is pretty good, it's just the crust that's my problem.

Just perfect - with the added juiced third lemon and zest as recommended by other reviewers.   Loved the tender crumby (easy) crust.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I absolutely love this recipe. I will not change anything next time. I added more lemon following some of the suggestions, but for me it didn't work that well. I don't like the sour aftertaste. I definitely will do it again following the recipe the way it is without altering it.

Amazing lemon bars! Only change I made was I used 3 lemons instead of 2. They had the perfect lemon flavor!

Must agree with others, it is a great recipe, but it isn't lemony enough with just the juice of two lemons.  It needs three lemons and at least a teaspoon of lemon zest.  It is a wonderful buttery recipe, just not tart.

Great lemon bars.  Ended up adding between 2/3 and 3/4 cup lemon juice to the mix.  Just out of the oven, I thought it was going to be dry due to a kind of firm appearance on the surface, but was totally wrong.  Crust is tender, filling moist and delicious.  You must try it!

I made this delicious recipe for the first time today & they are delicious! I followed the advice from one of the other expert bakers who suggested using 3 lemons & increasing the flour by a tablespoon. The only other helpful hint I would suggest is that after they've been out of the oven for about 5 minutes, take a knife & go along the edges so the insides don't crack (just like you would do with a cheesecake). Have already saved this in my favourites!!

"The Best?" No. Unless, of course, you don't like lemon. The crust is good, the consistency and all that is really good, too, but there is barely a hint of lemon to these. And isn't that kind of the point???

There is something wrong here --in a 9x13 pan this is a shortbread cookie with a lemon glace. I double and triple check the measurements and the pans size but it is nothing like the picture.

Wow!  These are great.  Not healthy at all, but my husband and I couldn't stop eating them.  we used 2/3 c lemon juice and added an extra Tbsp of flour to the custard part as was suggested.  Perfect.

These lemon bars are a hit every time I make them, and I always make a second batch with limes.  Though the recipe is great as is, I add the zest of one lemon (or two limes) to the crust.  Delicious!

At heart, these are the perfect lemon bars. Perfect tartness, perfect sweetness, perfect crust. Of course to each their own, but I believe them to be perfect in terms of flavor. What I do not agree with is the ratio of crust to filling, namely too much crust and not enough lemon. The ratio is only slightly off but it is important for supreme lemon-bar enjoyment.

Great tangy lemon taste, but the crust was not evenly cooked. I probably did not get the butter and flour evenly dispersed. But, the bars were still excellent. Did not change the recipe at all.

I wish I could give it 4.5 stars. These are great! But I agree with the previous reviews that it needs more lemon! I used the juice of two lemons but it wasn't enough for me. Also, I'll grease the pan next time so that they come out easier. Otherwise, this recipe went really well.

These were really good and really tart (but in a good way). I was out of powdered sugar for the topping, but later someone else got some and added it and it made them even better. Either way, I couldn't stop snacking on these whenever I walked by.

I've made this recipe throughout the summer and it's devoured every time. I get requests for these bars whenever there's an event or holiday. Extremely simple. And the shortbread crust is the highlight.

This was great! However, I would definitely recommend doing several things to alter it a bit. I added another lemon, plus the zest of about half a lemon. I also cut back on the sugar, using only about 1 cup, instead of 1 1/2. With these small changes, the recipe was delicious!

I have been looking for a lemon bar recipe to rival the one my mother used to make me as a child. For years we have tried recipes that failed, but this one blew it out of the water! My wife added more lemon, but other than that the recipe was the same. This recipe is amazing!

I am 14 and bake often, so I just had to try these! (instead of my mom's recipe- they never turned out very well).

I used 2/3 cup of granulated sugar in the crust because it was a little buttery for my taste, and used 2/3 cup lemon juice (because I didn't have fresh lemons). These turned out very well. Delicious, buttery, and great!

I am rating this recipe based on some small changes that I made...For the crust, I used 1/2 c powdered sugar instead of granulated.  I upped the granulated sugar to 2 cups for the lemon mixture, and used 3 lemons (juices and zests)  These are the perfect little summer treats! :~)

Awesome!!! This is the best lemon bars I ever made and tried ever! For the filling I used 3 lemons and the zest of 2 lemons. I increased the lemon juice to 2/3 cups - it was to die for. I loved the taste of the lemon filling and it was not over powering at all. I like the tart, buttery rich, slightly sweet all rolled in one satisfying lemon bar...soo Yummmy!!

Wow!  This was my first ever foray into the Lemon Bar World, and it was fantastic!! I had never even eaten a lemon bar before, let alone make them!  This recipe was delicious, easy and lived up to my hopes.  I did follow the advice of others and doubled the lemon juice and added a bit more flour and some zest.  They came out beautifully and I was so very pleased with the outcome. These will now be another Holiday Traditon in my home!

These are the absolute best lemon bars ever!  I've made them so many times and every time I bring them to a party, even with a double batch, they're gone by the end of the night.  I usually use a 9x13 pan with 1tbsp of lemon zest and 2/3cup lemon juice.  Also, I add an additional tablespoon of flour to the filling.  The best! :)

Great recipe! My first time making lemon bars and it was a great experience! I took the reviewers advice and increased the lemon juice (three lemons) and added 1 tbs flour.  One thing I changed based on the reviews that I don't recommend is to use a smaller pan...it makes the crust too thick in comparison with the topping.  Also I ran out of butter so used 1/2 c. of apple sauce instead and it still came out great, something to consider if you want it a little healthier.

Yum!!  Really good and easy.  I only had 3 medium-sized lemons on hand, and I could only squeeze out 1/2 cup of the juice.  Next time I will get much bigger lemons to get more juice to make it more tart.  The crust is perfect.  I also put lemon zest and a dash or 2 of lemon extract which helped to increase the tartness.  Really good with the sprinkled confectioners sugar on top!

These are really good.  I've never made lemon bars before and had a hankering for some, so I tried this recipe.  I used 'I can't believe it's not butter' sticks in place of real butter.  Also, I used about 1/2 c. of lemon juice.  Other than those very minor adjustments, I made it exactly as written.  I thought they turned out perfect.  They taste exactly like you'd think lemon bars should taste.  Nice buttery, flaky crust and a tart, lemon topping.

This turned out pretty good. I like the filling, crust was a tad bit thick but tasty. This recipe was A LOT of work. Took at least two hours. For the filling, I squeezed two lemons and then added two scoops of country time lemonade for extra flavor. Overall I would make again.

These are far better than any I have made.  I did mess the recipe up a bit though.  I added 1/4 cup more sugar to the crust, used 3/4 cup lemon juice and 1/3 cup flour plus 2 tsp and 1/4 cup more sugar for the lemon mixture.  These are so good.

This was not the best lemon bar recipe.  It was ok.  I thought the crust was way to buttery (and I really like butter), I was going to go with my instinct and just use 1/2 cup butter, I should have.  The filling was dense and heavy, I should have known four eggs would make for a dense filling.  Save your butter for a better receipe.

Pretty darn good! these are so simple to make too!  I made them very close to the recipe and they came out great.  I did add a little salt to crust - but you only need maybe 1/2 tsp!

I also veered off a bit and put in 2/3 a cup of lemon juice in and the zest of 2 lemons.  They were just enough - the lemon taste was apparent but not overpowering. I will say that I think I whisked it just a tad too much!  The top was pretty solid which didn't make them taste bad, but for presentation they were a bit white/yellow instead of a lovely yellow.

I added a little confectioners sugar after and mint leaves for some color.

Thank you for posting!!!

These are delicious! I had to change it a little bit, not because I wanted to, but because I had to. I only had 1 large lemon  that I got 1/3 cup of juice from. I had some lime juice in fridge so I put about 3 Tbl. of that into mixture. I added 3 Tbl of flour to offset the added liquid. The flavor is unbelievable. Such an easy recipe for such a great dessert. Thanks for posting.

The crust was passable.  As far as the lemon filling is concerned, you need to double or triple the filling in order to cover the crust.  I made these for a gift and needless to say I won't be able to include these in my cookie plate. Very disappointing.

Lemon bars are my new favorite thing. But out of the box, they are just not the same as from scratch. When I saw this recipe, I was drawn to the super simple ingredients. No fuss here! The crust is amazing, sort of a chewy, flaky shortbread and it goes so well with the tart, almost creamy lemon filling. I thought the ratio of crust to filling was perfect. I do live in Colorado (high altitude!) so I had to add an extra 2T of flour to the filling to make it thick enough for my taste. Before that it was just like straight liquid. I will be using this recipe for the rest of my life!

I followed this recipe and it was the first recipe on this site that I haven't had good luck with.  The lemon filling had a good flavor, but never set properly even with extra cooking time added.  I also added cooking time to the crust and let it cool before adding the lemon filling to it and it came out completely mushy.  My husband took one bite and spit it back out because of the texture.  I definitely wouldn't recommend this recipe.

My family loved them!  I also made them using limes and they too were a big hit with family and friends!  I needed to bring a dessert to a party and my husband the chocolate fan asked me to make the lemon bars again even though we still had a few bars left in the fridge.

We really love this recipe.  The ingredients list 4 tablespoons of  flour but the instructions call for ¼ cup flour.  I used 4 tablespoons and it was fantastic.  It was very easy to make and I will be making this again.  Thank you Patty Schenck for sharing your recipe.

These are really really great. Right out of the gate I tried the suggestion to up the lemon juice to a generous 2/3 cup, and upped the flour from 1/4 to 1/3. I also added the zest of 1 lemon tossing it with the 1/3c flour before adding the juice and eggs. I would recommend baking the crust upwards of 25 minutes, I wish I had done this to make them a bit chewier. All in all, this is a great recipe. Everything a really good lemon bar should be. Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe is good and I have used it many times. I love a tarter lemon filling so many times, I will reduce the amount of sugar.  When I want them to present even better, I double the filling ingredients so that the lemon filling is thicker like in many bakeries.  I cannot get enough of the lemon filling if it is not too sweet.

I'm not a fan of lemon bars but we have a lemon tree so I figured I should try making them myself! The recipe was beyond simple and I ate most of them!! I used the 2/3c of lemon juice which was around 3 or so because I knew I would like them beter the more tart they are. I also added some zest to the mix. I will definitely be making these again, if not for myself, for everyone else that ate them up!

WOW, I've made several lemon bar recipes and I think this is my favorite.  I did do the same as others suggested, adding a little more lemon juice and putting it in a smaller pan.  I do like my bars to be thicker.  YUMMY

Excellent! I had to bake the crust for about 25 minutes, and it browned only on the edges, but it was very good. I juiced 3 small lemons and it came out perfect. Remember to let them cool before adding powdered sugar. I cut mine out, put it on a plate, then powdered it.

Agreed w/ the reviewers about the additional lemon :).  I also like to juice my lemons using my Jack LaLane juicer - it really gets every last drop.  I also zest the lemons and, in addition, I have always preferred the crust made w/ powdered sugar (and a smidgen of salt) instead of granulated.  Gives a wonderfully delicate flaky crust.  YUM!

DELICIOUS! The ingredients gave a great texture and flavor. However, next time I will add 1 more lemon, and cut the shortbread ingredients in half.

So good!  I don't normally like lemon, but these bars are one of my new favorites!  I used 2/3 cup of lemon juice as suggested by others, and added one tablespoon of flour, and they were great.  I only had one lemon so I used bottled lemon juice to make up the difference.  I used a 9x13 pan and the crust was just right.  Thanks for the great recipe, they are awesome and so easy to make!!!

The tangy topping with that buttery sweet crust is a mouthful of heaven.  Easy peasy to make, too.  Follow directions exactly.  I'll be making this one a lot!

These are really good and all family and friends love them.  They also freeze well after cooking,cooling and slicing. Just stack between layers of greaseproof or baking paper in a sealed freezer container.

These were great..a little too sweet for me, but everyone else disagreed with me and said they were just perfect.  I added about 1/4 tsp salt to the crust and had to bake the crust a little longer than recipe states.  I will definitely make these again using a tad less sugar.

I really appreciated the helpful reviews that other bakers provided. I ended up adding about 1 tsp salt to the crust. It easily pressed into the dish and baked for about 25 mins - it's true it's better to overbake the crust than under bake.   I don't like my baking too sweet, so I cut down the sugar by a few tablespoons and used 4 lemons to get just over 1/2 cup lemon juice (hand squeezed). A delicious fresh aroma filled the house as it baked. It was easy to cut and serve. Thank you for a wonderful recipe! I will make again but might tweak the sugar/lemon amounts a little next time.

I'm sorry to dissent - but I feel the crust is too thick - tastes mostly of flour - and the filling is almost tasteless....and I followed the recipe to a T!  I will stick with the ones my mother made for me in my younger years from the Betty Crocker cookbook. Please - if you are looking for perfection in a lemon bar - find another recipe. Now that I've seen the other ratings (sort from lowest to highest) - I see I am not alone in my opinion of this recipe.

Amazing for my 1st time making lemon bars.  Will make again using the suggestion for thicker filling.  I used  3 lemons and all the zest.  My family were pigs for these.  Also, was wondering if corn starch would work in place of flour in the filling.  Does any one have a clue?   Thank you so much!

I just made these for the first time.  Didn't have fresh lemons so used bottled lemon juice (1/2 cup) and they turned out very good.  Great recipe. Thanks for sharing Patty.

Rich buttery crust and great tart flavor of filling. Only 3 stars because the crust is too thick, and also because I really would like to find a lemon bar recipe that cuts nicely - this was not it.

These were good, but not the best. The crust was super buttery and way too thick in proportion to the lemony goo. They just didn't taste lemony enough for us and I added an extra lemon (juiced) and lemon zest from all three lemons. I think the butter in the crust overwhelms the lemony flavor.  We would have preferred twice the goo and half the crust...

I made these and they turned out great. The crust is melt in your mouth tender. I added extra lemon juice to taste per my preference, but left all the rest of the filling ingredients the same. These are simple and very, very good.

A cafe in my town delivered some sweets to my job today and there were lemon bars on the platter and I love lemon so much that I had to try one.  So I went looking for a recipe and found this one.  OMG, THIS LEMON BAR WAS THA BOMB!!  I've never made these before but it was so incredibly easy to make that you'd think I was a pro! I GIVE THIS RECIPE FIVE STARS FOR DELECTABLE FLAVOR AND BEAUTIFUL PRESENTATION!

My oh my, these are amazing, and I grew up on the box stuff which is pretty good, but NO comparison to these!  The crust is tender and delicious! I made a little more filling, used 6 eggs and bit more lemon juice and flour.

Ok, I'll be the one dissenter...2/3rds cup of lemon juice was WAY too much for us.  The bars were very good and the crust WAS thick, but very tasty.  I did the 2/3 cup juice, 1 extra tablespoon flour and 1/4 tsp. salt.  I'm going with the original recipe next time and go from there.  My husband and I were actually wincing while we were eating them they were so sour. I can't wait to try them again because I loved everything else about them!!  I'll update the review after the next batch.

This recipe for lemon bars is really fantastic and foolproof. I did not alter the recipe's ingredients at all, but I did have to extend the cooking times because I used an 8x11 dish (I don't have a 9x13). If I were making for a party, I would definitely use a 9x13. I would give this recipe 5 stars, but it gets one star off because of the lack of lemon juice measurement. After reading other reviews, I settled on 3/4 c. of fresh lemon juice, although I think 1/2 c. would do fine. This one's a keeper!

Good taste, at just below 1/2 cup lemon juice ( 2 lemons). Added the 1/4 tsp of salt another reviewer suggested. Made them into little cupcake tins, but unfortunately they stick to the paper. Otherwise, the crust and filling are very flavorful. Next time I will double the amount of filling though, and try the bars.

Made these with limes and used 1/2 cup (3 limes) juice, plus the zest from the limes.  Also used 1 tbs. extra juice for a more tart bar, otherwise followed the recipe as stated, and they turned out perfect. I wouldn't have wanted the crust any thicker, and would have not wanted any more filling as it was so tart. I did spray the pan with cooking spray before pressing in the crust.  also let the crust cool before adding the filling to bake, and chilled bars for easier cutting. No problem getting them out of the pan if you have the right tools. This one is a keeper!

Nice flavor. I would've preferred a slightly thinner crust and a little more lemon filling. Wasn't sure how to tell when they were done. Topped them with powdered sugar.

Oh my word, these are just wonderful - they go together quickly and taste wonderful.  When my husband tasted these, he told me to throw away all the other recipes and only use this one from now on.  His clients love these bars!  I would suggest the fresh juice - it only takes a minute and gives a better flavor.

I used 1/2 cup of Lemon Juice and they were great!  I also allowed the crust to cool for about 15 minutes (in the fridge) and then baked the lemon on top.  This kept the crust and the custard separate.  They were wonderful and a big hit at a baby shower.

These are REALLLLY good lemon bars.  The only thing that I did different was I zested the lemons and added half to the crust and half to the filling.  I also added a couple of drops of almond extract to the crust.

Ok, can I just say yuummmmm!!!  I wasn't sure about these due to the mixed reviews, but needed to use up some lemons.  I followed the recipe exactly, but increased the cook time on the crust by about 7 minutes to get it golden.  I was surprised by how bubbly and holey it was, but I think that I should have blended in the butter a little better.  It didn't matter though.  I let it cool to room temp. before pouring the filling.  I cooked the whole thing a little longer than the recommended time as well because it didn't look set after 20 minutes.  My three year old and I just tasted a bar fresh from the oven, and we can't wait for them to cool to eat more! Mmmmm!!!

Way too much egg in these. When I pulled them out of the oven, all I could smell was egg, yuck! Not enough filling either and not lemony enough. Oh well....

First time making these and they turned out great! I used 2/3 C of bottled lemon juice as someone suggested, and I also added 1/2 Tsp of salt to the crust. In my opinion, this was the perfect amount of salt as it helps cut the sweetness from the lemon filling. Though I think next time I'll try using 1/4 C or less of sugar for the custard, and see how that turns out. I kept these bars refrigerated and tightly covered for days and they stayed fresh long after! I was afraid to eat them all, so I gave them away...and WELL received if I may say so!

Have made these many times now, and they are super good. Making a pan of lime squares too, and presenting a checkerboard plate of lemon and lime squares looks great. Finish with a dusting of icing sugar, fresh mint and blackberries or raspberries. Fanciness! I make them gluten-free by substituting the flour with brown rice flour. It makes for a more delicate bar, but the flavour is great. This recipe is a keeper!

well, it was delicious. make sure the crust is completely cooled before adding the liquid top though or else you will come up with upside down lemon bars that I got! Well, they were delicious - I added a bunch for lemon too. Had they actually looked like they were supposed to, I would have added a nice dusting of powdered sugar on top.

This really is an amazing (and easy) recipe!  I followed most of the reviewers and added a tsp of salt to the crust, baked it for 24 minutes, and let it cool completely before adding the lemon part (with 6 tbsp bottled lemon juice).  Took it out at 20 min, sprinkled powdered sugar, and refrigerated for a few hours before trying - these taste better than the ones you get at most bakeries!

These were very delicious and were quickly eaten up. However I thought that 1 cup of butter made them too greasy. I decided to make them again and only put a 1/2 cup of butter and just a little less flour and sugar in the crust. I got great results, they are less greasy and I don't feel like I sacrificed any flavor.

These lemon bars are just PHENOMENAL.  Easy, and they have made me FAMOUS at christmas time.  They have just enough lemon, are soft, buttery, and just sweet enough.  I drizzle melted white chocolate chips over them- very pretty.

I made these with limes and green dye (for St. Patrick's Day) and with 2/3 cup juice they were very tasty...but too sweet and not tart enough. Next time I'll reduce the sugar and add some zest.

These were ok, but I used 2/3 cup of lemon juice and it wasn't nearly enough. You could really taste the egg in the filling and I thought it was gross. I will try this again, however with a lot more lemon. The crust was really good.

Sooo good!  I love lemon bars and this is a great recipe.  I usually use "Lemon Square Bars", which I also love, but this recipe caught my eye because it called for much less sugar.  I also had two lemons sitting around, needing to be used.  (I did add about an extra TBS of the jarred stuff though, I like lots of lemony-ness).  I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat pastry flour in the crust and had to use 1 TBS of ww pastry flour in the topping too because I ran out of white.  Couldn't tell it was in there!  These are so yummy and rich.

There are better lemon bar recipes.  This was too sweet and the consistency was strange.  Couldn't leave out of the fridge too long before they began to melt.  OK if you need lemon bars quickly.

These Lemon Bars are ok.  This is a good starting recipe for Lemon Bars, but it is missing a few things.  I would suggest a teaspoon of salt in the crust and some additional lemon and perhaps lemon zest in the fruit top. On a positive note, the consistency was perfect, which is more than I can say for other lemon bar recipes I have tried.

These were amazing. My lemons were pretty big, so I ended up with almost half a cup of lemon juice, but I also grated about a teaspoon of lemon rind into the filling. Because I thought this would make them more tart, I sifted some icing sugar on top after they had come out of the oven. They were perfect!

Wonderful!!! Like a little slice of sunshine! The crust was buttery and luscious, tender but not crumbly. I would add a little salt to the crust next time, just to give it a little flavor (or maybe use salted butter). For the topping, I used 1/2 cup of fresh lemon juice with pulp and added a teaspoon of grated lemon rind. Fantastic! Tastes like summer. :D

This recipe was really quick and easy. I used fresh lemons from my tree and it was sooo good! It would make a good potluck treat. I sprinkled powdered sugar on top so they looked really yummy!

This recipe is delicious and very easy to make.  I made these bars for a dessert party and within minutes my guests were coming back for seconds and asking for the recipe.  All I added was a sprinkle of powdered sugar over the top after the bars cooled.

Simple and good. Good tartness, yet not too sour. I made with limes as my husband is a lime freak!
They turned out great. Took some to work to get other opinions, well liked.
Did use 4 limes as they were pretty small, and didnt get much juice from just 2.

My first time making and eating these and these were out of this world phenomenon. I was out of butter and used margarine. I used crushed grahm crackers instead of flour for the crust and for me that hit the spot. I did let it cool to room temperature. Upon reading some reviews, i decided to add some bottles lemon juice to what i had already squeezed and im glad i did. I cut the sugar a bit also. Superb recipe for those of us that want a bit of an understated sweet.

I made 1/2 the recipe in an 8x8 pan but otherwise, NO changes! It was DELICIOUS! Someone else at the cookout brought a store bakery lemon square dessert. So, we had a taste comparison! Everyone, including the one who brought the store bought lemon squares voted hands down for the homemade recipe with all natural ingredients, like real butter and real lemon and NO artificial ingredients with names you can't pronounce. This is a great recipe and easy to make! 
I did use a disposable 8"  square aluminum pan.

I don't normally take the time to write reviews, but I was craving something sweet  yesterday and decided to try this recipe. The lemon bars were AMAZING!!! Thank you, Patty, for sharing your recipe! I read a ton of the reviews, used several of their tweaks, and the bars were perfect. I followed the recipe, but added 1/4 tsp. salt to the crust, used 3 LARGE lemons to get 2/3 cup fresh lemon juice, added 2 tsp. lemon zest, added an extra 2 tsps. of flour to the filling, and dusted the lemon bars with powdered sugar when they came out of the oven. I also USED A SMALLER PAN (11x8) so the lemon bars were thick. I ended up with a 1:1 ratio of crust to filling, which was perfect.  I also baked the crust for a full 20 minutes. The lemon bars were very tart and the crust tasted just like a shortbread cookie. They do take a while to cool down and firm up...Make sure you bake the lemon bars until the filling is firm and not jiggly.
*tip: If you put the lemons in the microwave for 15 seconds, they are easier to juice!

These lemon bars are absolutely delicious and easy to put together.  After reading the reviews, I decided to increase the lemon juice to 2/3 cup, flour to 1/3 and I added the zest of 2 lemons  I also added salt to the crust. The bars were the best I ever made and my crust to lemon filling ratio was perfect. This is a keeper!

These were delicious but after baking the crust for the full 20 minutes, it still wasn't nice and browned on top. I left it in 5 minutes longer and they ended up sticking to the pan horribly. The lemon mixture on top was so gooey after baking that I didn't think they'd ever set. I ended up destroying half the pan trying to dig them out. They were for a party so I only wanted to take the "nice" looking ones. I ended up with only about 12. Would probably make them again because the flavor was delicious but will try a different pan or maybe not worry so much about the crust being underbaked.

Been making this exact recipe for YEARS now. I like my bars more tart so I add an extra whole lemon to the mix. Other than that I keep the recipe the same. My family loves it!

I made it for a second time and did a few adjustments to make it much more of a tart lemon flavour and I made some meringue for the top as well.

Absolutely fantastic lemon square recipe. The first time I made these squares, I did exactly as per the recipe, the squares were devoured in two days. That's between three people. It is my go to now although I do zest the two lemons and add that to this recipe. Kudos and thank you.

I used double the amount of base for the same amount of topping. The base was a little crumbly but it all tasted delicious and lots of good comments from guests.

Can i just say OMG. I did bake them a little longer than i should have because i had a smaller pan so it was a thicker 
 crust. The edges got a bit hard but i still ate them up. I did add extra juice from 1 extra lemon and topped with powdered sugar which gave it a bit more sweetness and a wee bit of extra flour in the egg mixture because i added extra lemon juice. Ive never made lemon bars before and this was a successsssssss.

Hello! Full disclaimer... this is the first time I've ever made this recipe... and my husband is veteran lemon bar consumer... I do like to bake so I figured I'd surprise him with homemade lemon bars... he does LOVE tart so I put 5 tbsp of lemon so if you love tart, add between 5-6 tbsp of lemon juice because it wasn't tart enough for even me (if you LOVE warheads, I'd suggest 7+ tbsp)... and let me tell ya, he is OBSESSED!!! He couldn't even wait for the lemon bars to cool down. He's nearly finished half of the batch I've made! And to remind you, this is my first time making it!!! I would recommend this recipe 1,000X and some!!!! Love it!!

recipe and list of ingredients don't match so it was a bit confusing to make. there were times where you had to hope the amount of the ingredient was right since the instructions didn't say. For sure need to add more lemon then recipe calls for.

This was really good. I made it in an 9 x 20 baking dish and there was a little too much crust, but it's okay because the crust had good flavor. I also added lemon zest from 2 lemons in addition to the lemon juice. It gave it great tangy flavor.

Very good with the suggested changes to the amounts of lemon juice, additional flour and salt! I only gave it three stars because I agree with others than it would not have been enough lemon curd otherwise. With 3 lemons and the zest of 2, 1/3 cup of flour and 1/2 tsp salt in the crust it was perfect! I’ve struggled to make successful lemon bars so will be using this recipe from here on out!

I loved the shortbread crust but I knew I would need more topping for my liking so I used about 1-1/4 cups freshly squeezed lemon juice (we have a tree). Put in 2 tbsp more flour and cooked for 40 minutes. I also added the zest of all my 5 lemons. Talk about lemony! They were great! Family loved them, thanks!

I thought the recipe was so easy to make. The crowd loved them. I made them a second time and added a bit more lemon juice. I noticed many reviews stated 1/2 cup of lemon juice. I love the bars tart so will definitely will add zest and more lemon juice in the future. I baked crust a full 20 minutes in an 81/2 x 11 dish. 15 minutes for filling.

I followed other user's suggestions of more lemon juice and adding some zest, I thought they turned out great! Personally, I like them with less crust to make them more lemony and less buttery, so next time I might cut down on the crust a bit, but that's a personal preference and they were delicious nonetheless! Were all gone within a day or two!

I added salt to the crust as someone else suggested and it definitely gave the crust good flavor; the crust would have been tasteless without it. I also added  extra lemon juice because hubs likes his lemon bars REALLY lemony. Best lemon bar recipe I've ever made and I've tried many as lemon bars are hubs favorite dessert. Delicious!!!!

I made this as directed, and it is a good flavor as lemon bars go. I rated it as a 3 because the proportions seem very off. In. 9x13 baking dish the crust is extremely thick with hardly enough lemon potion to cover the crust.  My recommendations include preparing half as much crust and then preparing it in a 9x9 pan.

Great recipe, I also used 1/2 cup lemon juice.  I added a bit of lemon zest to both the crust and the lemon layer.  It turned out great.

I was smart and read the comments and added 1/4 teaspoon of salt to the crust mixture. The crust was AMAZING! I cooled the crust before adding the lemon mixture. Instead of using the lemons, I added 2/3 cup of organic (NOT from concentrate) lemon juice plus 1 tablespoon extra of flour (to compensate for adding more lemon juice) to the lemon mixture. My family LOVED these bars and between family and friends, they only lasted two days! I'll definitely make these again and again!!

I found this to be an easy classic lemon bars recipe. Like other reviewers  stated, I added more lemon juice, using 3/4 of a cup and an additional 2 T of flour. then cooked it for about 8-10 min longer. I'm glad I made this change. However I like my lemon to still be a little more tart, so I think adding lemon zest as well would enhance the flavor more. Otherwise, this is a really good base recipe to make your own.

Made it gluten free with GF all purpose flour, could've used an additional lemon. Turned out great though!

Awesome!!  I made the recipe using gluten free flour and I used all of MommyFromSeattle's suggestions for additions.  These lemon bars were the hit of the party!!  My only complaint is that they stuck to the pan.

When I completed these bars, they were amazing! My crust was chewey and sweet while my filling was tart but heavenly.  When I made these, I made a couple of changes.  For my crust, I made it a little sweeter by only using half a cup of butter, and another half cup of coconut oil.  It adds some chewiness to the texture and a just a little bit of sweet.  To change my filling, I had about a half a cup of lemon juice, and then I added some pulp of the lemons I squeezed.  Then I zested one lemon to give it more lemon flavor.

Delicious! Made in 8x8 pan. I followed other reviewers' advice and used vest of 2 lemons, 4 lemons equalling 2/3c lemon juice, and added 1 Tbsp more flour to the filling. Add 1 tsp salt to crust and used only  1/4c sugar. Used 3/4c sugar in the filling. Baked crust for 20 min, let cool for few min in fridge (or 30min out of oven if have more time) then 30 min back in oven.

The use of fresh lemon juice from fresh squeezed lemons is a plus in the taste. But the overall finished bars are definitely missing something.

Theses are great. I substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and added the zest of nearly 1 meyer lemon. I baked the crust for 22 minutes. To top it off I dusted each serving with powdered sugar. DELICIOUS!

Used 2/3 cups of lemon juice. Need to use zest next time for just a bit more punch of lemon! Great overall. Also, my oven needs to bake for a little over 15 minutes to really brown up the crust.

These turned out great! I did make the most common adjustments: added 1/4 tsp salt to crust, used 2/3 cups lemon juice and an extra tbsp flour in filling. My bake times are always longer than most recipes suggest. I also lined my pan with aluminum foil and sprayed it with Pam. Perfect.

I loved these lemon bars. They had a perfect tartness and the crust was great.  Easy to make and quick.  As long as you have two lemons in the house, everything else is usually on hand in the pantry or refrigerator. I made them just as the instructions indicated.

Oh my goodness, these are fabulous. I made half the recipe in an 8x8 pan, but used the juice of 2 lemons and the rind of 1 of the lemons in the topping mix. I added 2 extra tablespoons of flour into the topping mixture to help with the setting due to the extra juice. Absolutely scrumptious and will definitely make again.

Turned out beautifully. Had to bake the lemon filling a little longer as it was still quite runny after only 25 mins, but everything else was perfect. My favorite lemon bars to date. :)

I used this recipe as a base for gluten free lemon bars and they came out perfect!  Changes to make this gluten free: use all purpose gluten free flour in crust and add 1 tsp salt. Perfect flavor and texture for the cookie crust. For the filling I used 1 tbsp cornstarch instead of flour to thicken. Following other comments we used 2/3 cup lemon juice and the zest of 2 lemons and added a pinch of salt as well. The flavor on these is beyond perfect. The cooking time did need to be increased as we used a smaller pan but overall a great recipe.

GREAT lemon bars and easy to make.  Even though it said "no substitutions," I did the following (one by mistake, the 2nd based on other reviews).

1.  I baked the shortbread in a 9"x9" pan.  That was the mistake part, but yielded nice, thick shortbread, which I happen to love.  Also the lemon part was thicker, which, in my book, can only be better.
2.  I used the juice of THREE large lemons and the zest of 1 lemon, giving the bars a lovely zing.  

I'd make this again, and keep my amendments.

My son has Celiac's Disease so everything in my kitchen is gluten free. I made this recipe substituting a gluten free cup for cup flour and they were PERFECT!!! I use 5 lemons... 2/3 cup in the recipe and the rest to make an icing on top. Just lemon juice, powdered sugar and a little water as needed for the icing. The serve nicely for a classy presentation.

I tried this recipe and it didn't turn out very well. I tried making it in an 8x8 pan as others have suggested but the crust was way too thick, even after cooling over night! If making in an 8x8 pan again, I will probably halve the crust portion. I also should have added more lemon juice as I prefer a very lemony flavor. Although it was not very successful, I will be trying this recipe again as I love lemony things!!

The recipe is great the way it is.  Some may cool the crust before pouring in the filling.  I depends on whether you want the filling to melt in to the crust.  I like it like that because the experience of the taste is harmonious.
Lemon desserts make me smile!

I made lemon bars for the first time extremely successfully using this recipe, even with some variations that decreased the sweetness of the bar. Instead of adding 1 1/2 cup sugar, I added 1 1/4 cup into the filling. I also increased the flour from 1/4 cup to 2/3 cup. Finally, we also used more than 2 squeezed lemons to give it a definitive lemony taste. The filling was well liked even by friends who expected to dislike it for the typical sweetness of lemon bars. Thank you!

Delicious! The only change I would make is a little less flour, so the bottom crust is a tad less crumbly. Maybe 1 3/4 cup instead of 2 cups. This is a fun one to make with a child because it's pretty easy and my daughter loved juicing the lemons.

Used a half cup of freshly squeezed lemons and added a little lemon zest. With that, this is the best recipe I've found. I will never have to look for another one! I do want to try lining the pan with parchment paper so the edges look and remove better. If that doesn't help, that's ok. These bars are so good it really doesn't matter.

I followed what some of the reviews said and used more lemon juice. I also used some homemade sugar cookie dough that i had sitting in the freezer for the crust. The crust became gooey and awesome but the lemon stuff i just couldn't eat. It formed a weird skin, im not sure if its suppose to since ive never made these before. Honestly these were way to sweet.

The crust ended up way too thick and crumbled easily, and the edges burned - 40 minutes in the oven is way too much. I'll try to experiment around with the ingredients and reduce the time in the oven to 30 minutes next time, see if I can make these into truly the best lemon bars.

I have been searching for the perfect lemon bar recipe and this is it!!!  I used 2/3 cup of lemon juice instead of the fresh squeezed and added a bit of salt to the crust, as well.  These were the first Christmas treat to disappear and I had to make more even before we began our celebrations.

I made a double batch, With 1 c lemon juice, 2 Tbs lemon zest with 1 1/2 c sugar, 1/4 c flour and 8 eggs- custard was right amount of tart and sweet.  I simply doubled the shortbread and filled one 8x11 and one 9 x 12; worked well for thickness and ratio.  I then dusted powdered sugar on top to make up for less sugar in custard.  Easy and delish!!

These seriously lived up to their name. I made these to bring for Thanksgiving with my family and everyone said they were the best they had ever had. They were also so incredibly easy to make. The only thing that I did differently was added a little bit of lemon rind to the mixture. Simply delicious!

The recipe calls for juice from 2 lemons which would be 6 tablespoons (3 TBS per lemon). If using lemon concentrate, use total of 4 TBS.

I made this recipe but cut the portions in half, came out good but since I didn't do the full amount for 36 servings it was pretty small and flat. I used lemon extract instead of lemons and it still tasted great. If I could do it again I would do the 36 servings instead of 18. It was an extremely easy recipe for me, a 15 year old, to follow :) also if you put some confectioners sugar on top it tastes amazing

I've tried lots of recipes for lemon bars and this is the simplest and best.  I'm not a big egg lover and many recipes have an "eggy" aftertaste that this one does not.  I've made this recipe with both lemons and limes, and while my personal favorite is lime, people rave about both.  I do some part time catering and people ALWAYS ask about this recipe - it never fails to draw compliments!

Has good flavor but the crust to filling ratio is off. Way too much crust. I would double the lemon filling/topping if I made this again.

These are amazing ! I made two batches. The first was exactly how the recipe was written ( used 1/2 cup lemon juice) and these were fantastic. Week later we were invited to a picnic and I decided to make these again, but noticed just how much sugar is in this recipe(2 full cups!) So I made these again with the following changes: Reduced the sugar in the crust from 1/2 cup to 1/4 cup and reduced the sugar in the lemon mixture from 1-1/2 cups to just 1 cup. So 3/4 of a cup less sugar and these still turned out great ! They disappeared quickly at the picnic amidst lots of compliments !

I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of adding a bit more lemon juice. The lemon filling didn't even cover all of the crust! Huge disappointment.

This is a great recipe! for fun, i added teal food coloring to the crust just to make it colorful. the crust was a little bit mushy since i added water to it to get the coloring mixed in, but it is still great and reccomendable.

I used an 8x11 glass pan. Increased the crust bake time a few extra minutes and increased the custard bake time 3 minutes. It was perfect. I used 1/4cup lemon juice plus 1/4 cup "realemon" juice from the bottle. Also the zest from one lemon. dusted with powdered sugar when they were still slightly warm. I also added 1/4 tsp lemon extract to the crust mix.

Very tasty, but I would cut the sugar back to 1 1/4 cups in the lemon layer and be sure to cook it in a 9 x 13 dish as I used the 8" square and it took much longer to cook the bottom layer and both the bottom layer and the lemon layer were too thick.

i love this recipe! as a chef, this is exactly the kind of recipe i like, it's simple and delicious. however, i prefer my lemon bars to pack more of a lemony punch, so i added 1 tablespoon of very finely grated lemon peel to the lemon mixture, and i added a tablespoon of cornstarch to the crust to make it less greasy.

I didn't change anything to the recipe. It was very good! I think I would've enjoyed more if there was more filling and less crust though. Otherwise very yummy!

Recipe is nearly perfect with two small exceptions - add the juice of 3 lemons rather than just the 2 called for, and you will get a much more distinctive lemon flavour and juicier / more lemon curd-like texture on the top layer.  I also find than an extra 5-10 minutes on baking the crust gives it a nicer crunchier texture. 

Serving suggestion: cut up a punnet of strawberries and cover w/ 1 tsp of sugar.  Squeeze the juice of one lime over the strawberries and sugar, and leave to soak for at least an hour.  Add a little water if there's not enough juice when you're ready to serve, then spoon the strawberries and juice over the lemon bars when you plate them.

Great Recipe! I have tried several recipes on this site for Lemon Bars and this is by far the best. The only changes I made was to add an extra 1/3 cup of sugar to the crust and I juiced 3 lemons and used the zest from 2, I think anything less and there would not have been much lemon flavor.  Also, make sure you "PAM" your cooking dish well or these will stick.

This is my 4th time making this recipe and I absolutely love it. I like to cook the crust for a little longer (5 minutes) for an extra crisp. But absolutely delicious and everyone loves it

Good base recipe, but there need's to be a little salt to bring out the butter in the crust as well as more lemon to the custard. I use about 1/2 cup to make it to my liking.

Here's a tip: do NOT use a strainer when juicing the lemons. No. I've made one batch w/out straining the lemon juice and just picking out the seeds and they were amazing. Second time I used a strainer to catch the seeds and the lemon bars had barely any lemon flavor at all. Otherwise really good.

I Love this recipe, but I have made my own adjustment. For those who are saying its not lemony enough, I always make sure to use large lemons, like HUGE, and also use the lemon zest from  the lemons, it really adds to it, besides that this recipe is perfect!

They are very good, but I wonder if the lemon topping could be thicker.  It was little more than a coating.

I made these last night... it just so happens that I had 2 lemons available... I have to say the shortbread crust made these the perfect amount of sweetness to the tartiness of the Lemon filling... The recipe was easy to assemble... I didn't use any appliances... just my hands and a wire wisk...

Made these today for my niece, and boy did she love them. I have never had a lemon bar so I didn't know how they were suppose to be. My niece said they were perfect and she took most of them home. I also liked them and I'll be making them again, so thank you for a new recipe for my collection. >^..^

All we tasted was FLOUR and mush!  We followed the recipe exactly.  After reading everyone's comments I guess we have to at least double the lemon juice and cut the flour.  Will keep trying other recipes.

These came out perfect!!! I was a little nervous after reading reviews. Only thing I did different was I added the juice of 1 more lemon. They still set up nicely without adding extra flour to compensate for extra juice. Other than that I changed nothing. Also probably one of the easiest dessert recipes I've ever made:) really really good!!!

These are SO good. So so good! Not to mention, SO easy to make! I used the juice of 2 very large lemons, and found that I would prefer a little more lemon flavor. My husband and family agreed that they would like it more tart and less sweet. My husband also said he would prefer a thinner crust. So, while the recipe as is is absolutely delish, next time I am going to add the juice of atleast 3 or 4 lemons, and reduce the amount of crust!

Excellent - best lemon bar recipe I have used.  Two suggestions:
1) Grate the rind of both lemons and use the rind in the bottom crust
2) Make sure your lemons are at room temperature and roll them hard on your counter to soften them up before juicing them.  You will get the most juice if you do this.  

If you do both of the above it will be plenty lemony and you won't need any extra lemon juice.

DE-LISH!!! I am normally not a fan of lemon-flavored anything, but living in Arizona my lemon tree produces 1000s of lemons each year. They are always so tasty on their own, I had to give this recipe a try.

I followed it very close, but I did add salt to the crust, and used 3/4 cup of fresh lemon juice to the filling. I used NO zest.

This will seriously be my go to dessert all the time. It was so easy, and so yummy!

The perfect lemon bar. No need to change a thing. The crust is buttery as it should be plus the lemon is just tart enough. It's the only lemon bar I ever bake.

Oh My - were these yummy!!! Rave reviews! After reading some of the reviews I did 1/4 recipe more crust for a 9X13 pan - doubled the filling using 1 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice & 3 1/4 c. sugar. For us it was the perfect sweet/tart and a PERFECT amount of filling so you could really enjoy it in your mouth and savor the flavor!!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Wonderful! This is by far the best recipe I've come across. The reason for the star knock off is because it didn't specify how much lemon juice to use. I used 3/4 cup and it was perfect. Also I would double the lemon filling, just because I like the lemon. That would be 1 1/2c of lemon juice if you do double. I also used an 8x11 dish instead of a 9x13. If you do, you can use less crust. Unless you like it thick. Overall I will be making these again and again and again!!

we love lemon in cookies and this was fabulous!!! will make this positively make again1 I ran out of white sugar and was a little more tart than the recipe BUT awesome lemon flavor (I did use 5 real lemons).
I have to say  I really really don't like when instead of comments or rating a recipe people actually submit their own as a comment. that's not make a comment--at least submit YOUR OWN version.

I found this to be a nice bar but thought the "crust to filling" ratio was unbalanced. Next time, I will either cut crust in half or double the filling. I added more lemon (3 lemons), and zest of 2 lemons. I added 1.5 table spoons more flour and 8 more minutes in the oven. I thought it worked well. The addition of whipped cream on the side was a nice combination with the tart bursts. Yum.

as is, not enough lemon flavor. Adding 2/3 or more lemon juice, plus 1 Tbl flour to filling, and lemon zest to crust...PERFECT!!

I haven't had much luck with lemon bars in the past, but these turned out great! Just the right crust-to-filling ratio for a cake pan. I used a non-stick pan, and the crust turned out slightly crispy on the bottom. Just perfect! I wanted to know exactly how much juice I used, so I measured how much juice I got from my 2 lemons and added just a little more bottled lemon juice to make exactly 1/2 cup. (I rarely have fresh lemons in the house.) I did add some lemon zest and topped with powdered sugar.

I am a huge fan of anything lemon.  For me, this was not lemony enough.  The first time I make a recipe, I follow it exactly.  The crust is fantastic though and our guests devoured them.  I will make them again, but, will follow the other reviewers advice and add more lemon and the zest as well.

Amazing!! I used 3.5 small lemons for the lemon juice! I did add a cup of sugar to the crust. Oh I did a little salt and vanilla extract to the crust...

I was a but worried bc it was bubbly on top and like I burned it and/or I did something wrong - but I didn't!!! Honestly it's one of the best things I have ever baked! 

Excellent!!! Can't wait to make it again!

Really good! The only thing worth changing, if you like a more tart lemony taste is to add more lemon juice, maybe use 3 or 4 lemons juice instead of 2. For me I didnt mind the more subtle lemon taste because I dont like things to be to tart, but dont get me wrong it still tasted lemony.

LOVE these lemon bars. I've made them twice now. The combination of gooey lemon filling and sweet hard crust is perfect. I do add some freshly grated nutmeg to the crust mix. For a half-recipe, I use the juice from 2 small-ish lemons and the zest from one (I love lemon!)

My son asked me to send Lemon Bars, having never made them, I came to my trusty site (allrecipes) to find a recipe and stumbled across this one. 
WOWEEEE!!! YUMMMMY!
I took advise from a member and used the juice of 3 lemons and about 1 TBSP zest. They were out of this world! These will DEFINITELY be in my dessert rotation! 
Thank you for sharing!!

Amazing... best part is there was no egg flavor in it. I was a little worried that the liquid was too much, but they came out perfect.  I let them cool and then I cut and placed in fridge.  We kept them for 4 days and every day they got better.
Great recepie!!

I thought this recipe was great. When I first baked it, I was a little unsure because it was still a little watery, but I put it back in the oven to sit and in the end it tasted great! I suggested using  more lemon juice (2/3 cup) to give it a better taste. I was running out of sugar so I was only able to put in 1 cup in the filling, so I put in 5 packets of the Splenda along with the sugar and it still tasted great.

Made these this morning and they are delicious.  I did take the advice of some of the comments and added lemon zest - we prefer a tart taste so I used the zest from two lemons in the body and the zest of one lemon in the crust..mmmm good

This recipe was tasty but I'm not sure if I would make it again. There was way too much butter in the crust and I also needed to add extra lemon juice to the filling.

This bar was simple enough to make - But even though I put in about a tsp of rind it wasn't quite tart enough for me.  Also the base ended up quite hard.  Next time will make it deeper.  But it cooked well and came out nice looking.

I made these exactly as the recipe says. I think they taste great, but for 2 things: I had to add a lot more cooking time to the crust (25 minutes total). I also probably should have cooked the topping a little more as well, but I didn't want to overcook and hopefully it will set up after being in the fridge. Also, mine were lemony but I could see some people wanting more. I probably would prefer them a little tarter as well since I like to sprinkle confectioners sugar on top. I also wish I remembered to add salt to the crust like others recommended. Overall great recipe though, thanks.

Lemon is a spring/summer flavor staple so of course I had to give these a shot! I always read reviews before baking and make adjustments if need be. Now, little fact, I always half recipes the first time I am trying a new recipe. I don't want to waste a whole bunch of ingredients on a failure you know? So I did that. I also took the advice from my fellow bakes and up'd the lemon. Yes I only used one, but a riper one with lots of juice. I also used the zest of that lemon. This resulted in a tangier bar with a nice but subtle punch of flavor. I also would have liked to know beforehand to let my crust cool before pouring my lemon filling. As a novice baker, this kind of stuff slips my mind. The bars tasted fine, but there was air pockets. Not many. I tried again and let the crust cool and the surface of my bars were so smooth. So remember to let that cool. All in all, great recipe. I have already made this thrice!

These were delicious.  I changed things a little bit, based on other comments from people.  Used the juice of 4 lemons, the zest of 1, and added a pinch of salt to the crust.  But they were soft, lemony, and very, VERY tasty.

OK, it was OK..nothing more. I made these lemon bars before going to bed for the breakfast and the next morning found them absolutely uneatable: the pie crust is rocky, the lemon filling is not tart enough for me and my family (though I added 3/4 cup of lemon juice as some users suggest + lots of lemon and lime zest), besides it's too floury and sticks to your teeth..ugh. I was disappointed and wanted to rate it 1 star. But after I had warmed a slice it turned out to be quite better. So it's not so bad being piping hot and served with vanilla ice cream. But not a keeper for me. What if to try it with lemon meringue pie filling?

I made lemon bars for the first time for my dad on fathers day, and they came out amazing! so as a belated birthday gift/food I made these again. Once again they were gone within a day. Just the right consistency, though I did tweak the recipe a bit by adding more lemons than called for. Besides that really great, Added to my favorite dessert dishes!

I have made this recipe many times and everyone loves them.  I bring them to work and my boss's eye's light up, she can't get enough of them.  She did try making them herself but they failed (don't know what she did wrong).  So it is my job to make these at least one a month.  They are delicious, and you can't go wrong if they are gone in one day.  I do manage to save some for me at home.  So I recommend these to all and I did change one thing, I added the lemon rind since it gives it any even better lemon taste.

Add the zest of the lemon as well as the juice for more flavor. 
I ground some toasted coconut until it was pretty fine.  I used 1/2 Cup of the ground coconut and removed 1/2 Cup of flour for the crust.  Great flavor, I may "play" with the crust a bit more. May try processing the sugar with the coconut to get the sugar a bit finer as well.

I can't fairly rate this recipe, as I did not make it as called for.

I made it in an 8x8 pan, because there didn't seem to be enough crust for a 9x13 pan. I was wrong, and the crust came out underdone. That was my fault. However, I followed advice from the reviews (don't remember the user) and the filling came out perfect using 2/3 cup of lemon juice. 2 lemons was very vague. A good recipe, and I would definitely make it again.

this recipe was so easy for me to make, because i am a teacher i find it hard to find time to bake for my family, but we were given all these lemons from a friend so i thought id make a lemon slice, but those recipes required condensed milk etc which i did not have at the time, then i cam across this recipe. i read the other reviews and suggest you definitely let the crust cool to room temp. and double the flour and add more lemons and zest so that the consistency is not runny but slow pouring consistency, almost like custard consistencty. this works well because it avoids the liquid running into the crust. its sets nice. awesome easy recipe

"2 lemons, juiced" is very vague...since we're huge lemon lovers I followed other reviewer's suggestions and added 1/2 cup lemon juice & lemon zest to filling.  Although, these were good we found that it wasn't lemony flavoured enough - found it to be more sweet than anything.  Maybe this was because the crust was thicker than the lemon so the flavour of the lemon was lost. ? This is a good base recipe but will be making some adjustments of adding more lemon juice, lemon zest & doubling the lemon filling.------------------UPDATE: after being refrigerate these we're better - not as sweet - but still need more lemon flavour/filling.

I loved this recipe! It is very adaptable. My family loves extra-tart Lemon Bars so I increased the lemon juice to 6 lemons, added the zest of two whole lemons and increased the flour in the lemon filling to 1/3 cup. This is not for everyone since it could possibly set your teeth on edge :) But for my family even a big 15X10 pan didn't last very long!!!

Very good but I think next time I'll double the lemon filling amount for a thicker bar. I followed the recipe exactly but I used 3 lemons for about 2/3cup lemon juice and substituted a 1/2cup flour for 1/2 cup ground flax for the crust to try and make them healthier. Also I used whole wheat flour. Very yummy, I will definately make these bars again. This recipe was very quick and easy.

Delicious! I made these for my boyfriends parents and they were much enjoyed, even his mom enjoyed them after confessing she didn't like lemon. I did add a little lemon zest to the crust and the lemon mixture. I think this will be my go to recipe.

This was my first time making lemon bars from scratch.  They came out amazingly good!  Nice lemony sweetness, a great dessert or afternoon treat.  I would have given 5 stars but I did make a few small changes to the recipe after reading the reviews.  I added lemon zest to the crust before baking.  For the custard, I used the juice of 2 1/2 lemons (vs 2), used 1/3 cup flour (vs 1/4), and added lemon zest. I will definitely be making these again.

Oh my gosh! Amazing! Made a meringue topping and added it after baking the curd layer for ten minutes. Followed tips from others, added a little salt to the crust, and got rave reviews from the people eating it. As for the curd, added the zest of three lemons, and half a cup of juice. Made this in a smaller pan, so had to bake each layer a bit longer. Absolutely amazing.

I made this just the way the directions indicated. Some thought it was wonderful, others thought the bottom crust was too hard. So...it really depends on a personal preference.

These lemon bars are amazing! Our family has loved lemon squares for as long as i can remember and even before i was born and after we lost our original recipe, things were never the same. All the other recipes i used were either WAY TOO SWEET or had way too much crust and an almost invisible layer of filling. I used 1/2 cup of fresh lemon juice and added two teaspoons of lemon rind, it wasn't even very tart! Just how i like it. I cooked the crust until it was golden brown on the edges and then cooked it again with the filling. WOW it turned out soo good and the filling was soo gooey and delicious. Remember not to overcook  the filling! It should be gooey. Anyways, I've finally found the perfect recipe and will keep it in my recipe box for future use. Thanks so much for sharing THE BEST LEMON BARS EVER.

Great recipe! I usually like to try as-is before altering too much, however I did make a couple minor modifications based on all the other positive reviews: 1) added approx. 1t lemon zest to crust, and 2) sprinkled powdered sugar on top immediately after removing from oven. They turned out great, and I will definitely make these again!

Wow!! This is by far the best Lemon Bar recipe I have made and so easy. I did take the suggestions of other viewers and use 2/3 cup fresh lemon and 1/3 cup flour to make up for the extra liquid and used the zest of 2 lemons as well. I waited for the crust to cool down to room temperature before adding the filing. They came out fabulous, I nearly fell over...enjoy

Great recipe!I also used half a cup of lemon juice - one lemon with zest and topped it up with bottled lemon juice because that's all I had.  But I wanted it thicker so I made it in a 9x9 rather than a 9x13 which gave me just enough filling but too much crust, SO....I set some of the crust aside and crumbled it over that top about 5 minutes into baking.  Gave it a nice crunchy topping.  Soooooo good.

The basic recipe here is sound, but definitely heavy on crust and very light on lemon; with some changes, it's definitely a 5-star recipe. The crust needs 1/2 teaspoon of salt (or use salted butter); lemon zest is nice, too. The original custard is very scant and not at all lemony enough. I doubled the quantity of filling, increased the lemon-to-sugar ratio because I like my lemon desserts tart and bright (I increased the lemon juice to 1 and 1/4 cups and decreased the sugar to 2 and 3/4 cups), and added 2 tablespoons of flour to help it set, due to the extra juice. I cooked my bars in two 8x8 pans instead of one 9x13, but the total surface area of the pans are very close; my bars were just a smidge thinner than they would have been in a 9x13. I baked the crusts for 20-25 minutes and the filled pans for 30 more, and a 9x13 would be almost identical. The original recipe was blah, but with these changes the results were definitely among the best lemon bars I've tried.

This recipe is a good foundation to making "Lemon Bars".

I agree with many of the comments, "not lemony enough". I like the suggestion to add more lemon juice or bottled lemon juice to add flavor. I too added lemon zest to the batter and also to the crust.

Next time, I may double the lemon topping.

These are 100 times better the next day. Refrigerate overnight.

I have been attempting the perfect lemon bar for at least a year, and this is the only recipe that works. I made them Christmas morning, and they were simply delicious. The only change I made based on reviews was I added lemon zest. Otherwise, I try to follow the recipe as listed on my first try. The only exception is in case of allergy. As other reviewers mentioned, the crust is thicker than the filling, so for my next batch, I will double up on the filling.  I loved the thick crust.

I am a ten year old girl that  is obsessed with cooking, and when I saw this recipe I just HAD to try it! These lemon bars are fantastic! Note: Add a teaspoon on lemon zest. You won't regret it.

The shortbread crust is wonderful.  I am not very sensitive to srong taste like sour or spicy.  These were not tart enough for me.  My family loved them, but I would have liked it if there was more lemon in these lemon bars.

Took the suggestions to use 2/3 cup lemon juice. Baked in an 8x8. Would recommend either cutting the crust recipe in half if using an 8x8 or doubling the filling recipe for an 9x13. Other than that, wouldn't change anything.

This was my first try at Lemon Bars and I thought they came out pretty good.  I made them for a bridal shower and one woman claimed they were the best she's ever had (and she claimed to be a bit of a connoisseur).  I followed the advice of another reviewer and used an 8 x 11" pan to yield thicker bars.  I used meyer lemons and increased the lemon juice to just shy of 2/3 cup (juice of 3 good sized lemons).  I also added an extra tablespoon of flour to compensate for the extra liquid.  I think next time I will also added the zest of 2 of the lemons.  I also added 1/4 teaspoon salt to the crust for more flavor.  I read that it's better to overcook then undercook the crust....but next time I will keep a better eye on it as I think I did go a bit too far with the crust this time around.  Overall a very good recipe!

This recipe is so easy and tastes great!  I had a lot of lemons and my goal was to use them, so I put the juice of 2 small and 2 large lemons and didn't change anything else and they turned out wonderful! Everyone loved it.  Then I made the recipe again with the juice of 5 limes and it turned out great too.  I really love how easy this recipe is.

Fantastic! Yum! My 12 year old son declared these lemon bars his favorite dessert. I've never made lemon bars before, never really thought to, but I had extra lemons so I tried this recipe, a new favorite I will go back to again and again. I too added about 2/3 cup fresh lemon juice and added a little extra flour to compensate.

This was soooo yummy!! I made the following changes: zest the 2 lemons before juicing them and add to the lemon filling, increase lemon juice to 3/4 C. for the lemon filling, substitute 1/2 C. rolled oats for the crust and put all the crust ingredients into the food processor. 

Also I baked this in an 8x8 pan and increased baking time to 25 mins. SO YUMMY!

The lemon bars were really good! Although when I tried to scrape the bars out of the pan the crust stayed sticking to the pan and not coming with the bar. But the bars were sooo good! My whole family liked them!

I know why they call these the  " BEST LEMON BARS", they truly are the best.  I made these a few times and they are always a hit.  I may try making them with limes the next time.  Always use fresh fruit for the juice, I really think it makes a big difference.

This recipe is wonderful and very simple.  I followed the suggestion of others and increased the lemon juice to 2/3 cup and zested a lemon into the filling.  I added salt to the crust as well.  These are so tart and delicious!

Really excellent taste! Not sticky-sweet, not too tart. Great tender crust! I had both lemons and limeslemons, so added juice and also zest from each- fabulous flavor! Also, made extra filling as I wanted alot of the lemon/lime. Followed advice from others to use a smaller pan as well, to make them even thicker.  I will definitely use this as my go-to lemon bar recipe.

I like them, but I do admit to having made small changes. I added a dash of salt to crust, almost 2/3 c. lemon juice (3 lemons) plus the zest of one lemon and maybe two extra spoonfuls of sugar to filling. It wasn't the prettiest lemon bar I've made, but it was good. I might prefer the recipe from Joy of Cooking but this one is good too, just a tad less lemony.

These are absolutely incredible! I followed the recipe as written, adding the following: a pinch of salt to the crust, 2/3 cup of bottled lemon juice, parchment paper lined pan, powdered sugar on top. I was a little worried that the bottled lemon juice wouldn't work as well, but it worked like a charm and saved me a trip to the store. I will be making these again and again!

Great classic lemon bar.... far far from being at all healthy... most recipes use half the butter and less sugar... these turned out fantastic and got great reviews from everyone who tried them.... I didn't have fresh lemons so I used 2/3 cup of lemon juice... if I have lemons next time I will juice them and add some zest... but as I made them they turned out great... just not the best things in the world for you...

This is now my go to recipe for lemon bars.  I was tempted to give 4 stars because of the need to alter the recipe.  Based upon reviews and my love of tart lemon I followed combined reviews of: Mommyfrom seattle and sugarboo in making them.  I used 3/4 cup lemon juice, zest of 2 lemons to custard, added salt 1/4 tsp salt and 2 Tbs flour to custard. - I doubled the recipe,  (amounts above are for single recipe.) Because of this I added 5 mins. to crust bake time and app. 7 mins to custard time.  They turned out perfectly. However, next time I plan to double only the custard and decide which crust I prefer. The crust is a light, buttery shortbread flavor. - Its an easy recipe, I used an ungreased, 9x13, glass baking dish and they popped right out. Allow the crust to cool for awhile prior to adding the custard, otherwise the eggs start to cook on the hot crust. - Trickiest part for me was making the desired changes to original recipe based upon the reviews.

This is a nice recipe.  I used the fresh lemons, juiced, but added just a touch more juice because I love tart lemon desserts.  Other than that, followed the recipe.  This is a keeper for me.  Thank you.

These are sooo easy and good! I made them for a back yard BBQ and there were none left by the end of the day! One friend confessed that she ate 4 of them! I am making them again this week for another BBQ. I hope I have some leftovers this time. Oh, and I followed the recipe exactly, no substitutions or changes.

I made these and they were amazing!  Yummy, Yummy, Yummy.  I did not vary from the recipe at all and am not sure why others needed to.  This is a keeper. Thanks

I have a recipe for lemon bars that people really love, but I tried this one for a change and shared them with my friends. No one liked them as much. The recipe I normally use has a thick, rich lemon CURD that is cooked on the stove before before being added to the parbaked crust and finished off in the oven, I think that is what makes the difference. While making the curd I add in the zest of the lemons in order to get the great oils from the peels and then strain them out before adding the cooked curd to the crust. But this recipe is much easier I must admit.

I have never made lemon bars before, but these turned out awesome!! I made them for a shower and the guests raved! I used 2 lemons and then added enough "Real Lemon" juice to make it a full 1/2 cup. I baked the crust for 20 minutes and then let it cool fully--glad I did! I had to bake the final product 24 or 25 minutes, but then it was just right. I chilled it and then sprinkled powdered sugar on it right before I cut it. Beautiful! Thanks for the great recipe!!

Made these for the first time and after reading through the other reviews, decided to make the following changes. I used the juice of three lemons and used 1/3 cup of flour to compensate for the extra juice, and finished them off with a lemon glaze. Everyone loved them!! By far the best lemon bars ever, sweet and tart with buttery crust and a tangy glaze! Lemon lovers rejoice :)

Never tried something like this before, but they turned out pretty great!

I used a (glass) 8x11 pan as suggested by another member, and added about halfway between 1/2 and 2/3 cups of lemon juice for the custard. Even so, the bars seemed like they could've been a bit more lemony. I also noticed that the crust seemed to outweigh the custard a bit (in volume as well as flavor).

The crust took quite a bit longer than expected (even after adding 5-10 minutes for the different pan size) and was still pretty chewy in the center by the time they were finished. On the other hand, the custard was definitely done within 25-30 minutes.

Even though they weren't my favorite dessert ever, everyone that tried them loved them, and the whole pan was gone within an hour of serving them. I definitely recommend this recipe and will be making them again soon!

Very good.  As recommended by others I added 2/3 cup lemon juice to the filling, and a dash of salt to the crust.  Had to chill over night to completely set...next time i'll bake a couple extra minutes.

Wonderful! Like others suggested, I used 2 cups of sugar, 1/3 cup of lemon juice, and the zest of one lemon. I made it in a slightly smaller pan, because I wanted thicker bars. Everyone in my family is going to looove this new addition to my recipe box.

Delicious!  I did use a smaller pan 8.5 X 11 --- and increased the lemon juice b/c we like them a bit more tart.  Baked them a bit longer because of the smaller pan.  Turned out perfect.  I like my bars a little thicker, but I'm sure the 9 X 13 pan works well too.  Great recipe.

This is an amazing recipe- just make sure to add more lemon juice!!  It calls for two lemons, I try to use three to four, and it's perfect.  Make sure not to over-bake it, because it can be easy to do.  After about 18-20 minutes it isn't firm, but after cooling for 30 minutes to an hour, they firm up perfectly!  So when you take them out after 20 minutes, don't over bake just because they don't look done!

These were so easy & SO DELISH, AH-mazing, I don't know where to start?! I guess with how I actually made them (different from recipe). !. I used 3 fresh juiced lemons & added 2 tsp. flour, for the crust...WHERE DO i BEGIN? I previously made (and overbaked) some blondie brownies...they turned out wayyy too hard so I ground them up & mixed with melted butter (made a graham cracker crust w/ ground up blondie bars!).I was sooo scared how this was turning out but it was AH-mazing X10000000!!!! Overall, these are the very best lemon bars ever, delicious tartness & sweetness, awesome crust, so refreshing....omg, i need some more now...haha SO GOOD!

The lemon bars really are the best- Not too sour, not too sweet. They taste great warm. However, the crust isn't very great.

This is a great recipe! Easy to make and taste awesome! I did tweak it slighty by adding another half of lemon juice as suggested by some. All in all, i am quite happy with the results. Will definitely make these again !

My husband said these were the best lemon bars he ever had.  I think I agree.  I use the frozen lemon juice, and it tastes great.  I suppose fresh would be better, but then I probably wouldn't bother making them.

Excellent.  Have tried a few lemon square recipes and this is, in my opinion, the best so far.  (Notes to self: following other reviewers, add 1/4 tsp salt to crust; use 2/3 juice + 1 extra tbsp of flour in filling. Crust is fairly thick.  Maybe bake filling 5-10 min extra next time so completely set in centre.)

This turned out really well. As I was spreading out the crust in pan I started to panic because I didn't think there was enough and it would be way too thin ... but all was fine. I'll definitely make these again.

This recipe is incredibly easy and the bars are amazing! I used fresh lemons and the filling is perfectly tart and the crust is so buttery. This is definitely going to be my "go to" recipe any time I need to bring a dish to a get together!

i've made these a few times now and today i tweaked the mix a bit. 2 n 1/2 sticks of butter for the crust. and for the lemon filling I put 4.5 oz of lemon juice and reduced the sugar to 1 and 1/3 cups and increased the flour to 1/3 cup. I'll let you all know how it goes!

these were so so yummy!!and easy too...the only things I did do was squeeze 3/4 cup lemon juice and one zested lemon.I used 8x11 dish like someone recommended but crust was far too thick for me so next time will stick to the recipe with the 13x9 but will double the lemon mixture and I think it will be perfect!

Not bad, but not tart enough for my taste (even using the juice of 3 lemons). Also, the batch that I made didn't hold together as well as I would have liked.

This recipe (with the added lemon zest) makes a delicious bar,  but I had trouble with it.  Seems like the custard seeped down through the crust, making the bottoms of the bars very messy.  For the next try, I'll try precooking the custard to see if I can get it to thicken before putting it over the crust.

This is a wonderful, easy recipe! The crust held together well as I cut them into bars. The lemon filling was tart and delicious. I will definitely add these to my Christmas cookie list!

I lost my old recipe for lemon bars but tried this one. They were good... but the crust to filling ratio was a little off... too much crust. My old recipe called for adding lemon zest as well... which i did.

This recipe has become the dessert we take everywhere.  My husband and kids love these.  Next time I make it, I'm putting it in a pie plate.  I don't like traditional lemon pies.

I just tried this recipe and it was SO GOOD! I did add 4 large lemons instead of 2 and extra flour and sugar to the second layer. It turned out perfect and addictively yummy!

I thought these bars were exceptional!!  I made these for my husband who loves lemon bars.  They turned out great.  I did use some of the other's suggestions and made sure that I used 3/4 cup of squeezed lemon juice.  I thought they were perfectly "lemony" enough.  All in all, very good recipe and I will be making it again.  :)

They are awesome! I would make a little bit extra of the filling though. I actually didn't use any eggs, and the recipe was perfect for egg allergies. I've made these about five times and have never used the eggs!!!

These are delicious! The crust is so buttery...yum! In my humble opinion there is NOT enough filling though. I didn't quite double the filling, I made it and added another 'half' Fresh out of the oven it seemed really eggy. But after it cooled that wasn't an issue. They were SUPER sweet though! Next time I will cut the sugar.

I had never made lemon bars from scratch before but this recipe was so easy for a beginner cook like me that they turned out perfectly. Everyone assumed I'd been making them for years! I took the advice of Mommy, Sugarboo, and SallyCat. Used 2/3 Cup lemon juice, zest of 2 lemons, increased flour by 1/3 Cup, and doubled the recipe. Had to bake longer like they suggested so I just watched them and took them out when they started browning slightly on the edges. They were awesome, just like my Grandma's were and didn't stick to the pan at all. Yum!!

These are very good, but the lemon flavor is not strong enough. I used the juice of 4 smallish/ medium lemons (probably it was about 2 or 3 Tbsp.) - would probably at least double that if I make it again.  I wish I had read the reviews about adding more juice and a little more flour to the filling mixture. The crust was so buttery and delicious, and the texture of the lemon bar is great, it just needs more tangy lemon tartness!!

These were absolutely delicious! I added 4 lemons though, and it was vert tangy yet sweet as well. In my personal opinion, it tasted better the second day, as it was slightly chewier. But always delicious!

I love this recipe because it has simple ingredients and lends itself to creativity. I've made it a few times before as written, and this time I made a few alterations that I was pretty happy with. I couldn't find a 9x13 pan so I used my 8" glass pie pan and spread the shortbread along the bottom and the sides. (I had extra that I set aside for something else). This worked out well, but it poofed up a lot and I had to flatten it (forgot to pierce with a fork). Still ended up with a pretty nice crust though.
For the filling I did about half lemon and half lime juice, and substituted one cup of the sugar for one cup of date paste (dates processed in blender with a little water). The resulting "pie" was very lemony/limey, and the dates added a nice, rich flavor without taking away any of the sweetness. In fact, I think next time I will skip the sugar altogether and just use the cup of date syrup. Yum.

Really good, tart, and simple. Just the way I like my lemony deserts. I used 1/2 whole wheat in the crust and raw sugar for the crust & filling. Also I used 3 juicy big lemons, the rind from 1 lemon, and sprinkled the end result with icing sugar. I would probably just follow the lemon recommendation outlined in the recipe because, although I love tart lemon flavours this was a little too puckery!

Best lemon bars EVER!!!!!!  I baked mine in an 11x8 and the absolutely delicious crust was pretty thick; I think next time I'll use a 9x13 and make 1 1/2x the filling.  I didn't dust them with powdered sugar until they were cool, and it didn't stick- just FYI.

I did not care for these. The crust tastes EXACTLY like flour and is way too thick.  The lemon filling should actually be called "non-lemon" filling--it has absolutely no lemon taste at all, and I even added a little extra!  I cannot believe the good ratings on this.  If I could, I'd give it zero stars.

Yum!!  First time making lemon bars and they are SCRUMPTUOUS!  The only thing I changed was I used 1/2  Crisco and 1/2 butter and I increased the amount of filling (i.e. 6 eggs and at least 2/3 C lemon juice + lots of lemon zest).  They are a huge hit and people are begging me for more!

These lemon bars are delish! I made them for a bbq and they turned out excellent. The only change I made was the addition of more lemon juice - I squeezed 5 lemons and got 2/3 cup of juice.  It was the perfect amount of tartness.  The crust is also very tasty.  I WILL be making again!

These turned out pretty good! Easy. Although, I should have added more lemon, because I like more lemon flavor.

I made these bars for a cookout and every one told me how much they loved them, even though I thought they were a little sweet for my taste. I cut the bars into small squares because I wasn't sure if there would be enough for our crowd and the sweetness.  Everyone seemed to love the size because they kept going back for more! Great summer recipe due to the lightness of the bars... will make again for sure!

Fabulous! I dusted with powdered sugar, as in the picture. Then I placed a strawberry half on top of each bar, cut them but left them in the pan, then drizzled melted chocolate chips (thinned with a little milk) in a criss-cross pattern. They were the hit of the choir party, both for their appearance and for their yumminess.

These are wonderful as is!  The second time I made it I followed the reviewers' advice and halved the crust ingredients for a thinner crust.  The second time I also put it in an 8 X 11 glass pan and used 2/3 c lemon juice and 1/3 c flour as others had suggested (I used bottled lemon juice both times).  Even though the original recipe is excellent, it is 6 stars with the changes! Do spray your pan with cooking spray, and a little bit of powdered sugar on top is very pretty.  I keep these in the fridge right away because of the eggs.

Awesome recipe! After my first batch, was able to adjust to my preference (ie more lemon custard ratio to crust & my 9x9 pan) Also added lemon zest to the recipe for extra zing.

I found this recipe to be just terrible. No flavor. Dry and crumbly. Sort of like eating baked flour. I would not recommend this recipe.

Totally recommend this recipe and will be making these again soon.

loved baking something with some lemon for the first time. I used half the recipe so the timing was off in the oven...the bottom burnt just slightly. Tastes great. (Because of my burnt bottom crust, i will suggest people trying something less than the recommended time for baking to be on the safe side. The burning doesn't really show at all, btw.)

These are decent, but the mix that comes in a box makes better lemon bars than these.  I used the juice and zest of 6 large juice lemons, but the crust over powers the lemon flavor.  Also, I would make at least 1 1/2 recipes of filling, maybe a double recipe if you want to have equal parts filling to crust.

this recipe was great. it was my first time making lemon bars aside from added a 1/2 cup of some sicilian lemon juice that comes in a little plastic lemon bottle, i followed this recipe exactly and added some powdered sugar on top and used margarine instead of butter. the lemon bars were yummy and easy thank you for posting. i only gave it 4 stars cause i tweaked the recipe slightly. but this was a awesome for learning how to make them.

This recipe is such a disappointment! I made these tonight and even after adding the juice of another lemon AND the zest of a lemon, they were still bland. I expect lemon bars to be tart and lemony, these were just sweet and gooey. I will continue searching for the right recipe.

The best lemon bars? I beg to differ. The recipe was not specific about mixing the dough, not enough lemon juice, and where is the powdered sugar dusting? I have tasted much better. Next time I will stick to my favorite recipe from K. Couric.

I found this to be an extremely easy recipe to follow and to make.  It was very good and I will definitely make it again.  However, the instructions were not specific enough as far as the crust is concerned.  I would recommend that the crust be crumbly-like and then spread it into the pan.  I also think that I will try making the crust in the food processor the next time.  In addition, I think I will increase the lemon juice from 2 lemons to 2-1/2 to 3 medium lemons (but I like mine fairly tart).  Also, do not forget to have some powdered sugar available to lightly sprinkle on top (which was not indicated in the recipe).

I've always loved lemon bars and never made them myself, until this recipe.  I love these lemon bars and will only use this recipe.  I wasn't sure what the juice of 2 lemons was so I just added 1/2 C of fresh squeezed lemon juice.  They were fantastic!

Made these for a bake sale and they sold out in short order with people sending emails asking for the recipe. Only thing I added was some lemon zest because I like extra tartness.

These are absolutely delicious! I made them about a month ago and again today. They work quite well GF :) I used a flour mix with 6 parts rice flour, 2 parts potato starch, and 1 part tapioca flour. I doubled the filling both times (they had to cook about 15 min longer) and used more lemon :) I also added about 1 tsp of salt to the crust. The first time I was short on lemons so I added some extra orange juice concentrate and the turned out wonderfully! This time I did 4 lemons (they only turned out 2/3 cups of juice) and added more lemon juice to equal 1 1/3 cups. I added almost 2/3 cups of flour to compensate for the extra liquid :) These are so easy and delicious, I will always use this recipe!

I made the for a very picky guy i work with since he doesnt like chocolate (i try to get creative). They were perfect the first time i made them and even better the second time. The second time it took me 6 minutes, i timed it, to make the crust and the lemon filling. Super easy and delicious! I add a bit more lemon juice (didnt use fresh lemons) because i like them to be very tart. Delicious!

These didn't turn out for me.  The base was too buttery and crumbly.  The lemon topping sunk into the base.  Actually it sunk right through, so the top was more crusty and the bottom was pasty.  The taste was OK but too buttery.  Was planning to bring these to a potluck today but will be leaving them at home.

These are SO good. I have made 2 batches in one week. My first batch seemed to have too much crust and not enough lemon layer, so for the second batch I cut the ingredients for the crust in half and used an 8X8 inch pan instead. My husband thought these were much more enjoyable

These really are the best lemon bars.  I also added an extra lemon and some zest; they came out perfect.  I did not have to add extra flour to correct for the extra lemon juice; there is enough egg and flour to make it gel.

These are phenomenal!  They tasted like I could have gotten them from a bakery.  No one believed me when I said I made them myself.  I did follow the advice of someone who wrote that 2/3 cup of fresh lemon juice was just the right amount - and it was.  I also added a tablespoon or so of extra flour to the filling to compensate.  I baked these for about 26 minutes - a little longer than the recipe called for.  They were perfect!

Made these last night, I used a 1/2 cup less sugar for the lemon filling and used the juice of 3 lemons instead of 2. Loved it, very tart the best recipe I have found. All the others were too sweet.

WONDERFUL!  This is now my go-to recipe for lemon bars.    I did a little tweaking to the recipe per other users' reviews.  The outcome was awesome.  Very rich and tart with a buttery crust.  I received positive feedback from all who tried them!

Whoever named this GOT THE TITLE RIGHT. Threw out my previous recipe that everyone asks me to make FOR THIS ONE. It was even better than I hoped. Have to agree with SALLYCAT - adding more lemon (and increasing some other ingredients) enhanced the flavor without making it too tart.

These are awesome! The only negative I can say is that in no way does this recipe make 36 servings... more like 12, but they were still awesome!

These are really good, but I think the curd is too tart. Less of it and more of the cream cheese filling would be better. Definitely worth making though!

This has a nice flavor but I made mine in an 8x11 glass dish and the crust was soooo thick. Too thick I think, and yes I had to cook the crust longer-until lightly browned. If you are going to use a pan this size I would increase the filling by double to make up for the thickness of the crust bc keeping it as is it was 1/2 and 1/2 for thickness. Everybody loved them though! My first time making lemon bars super easy and yummy.

Unbelievable!!! This crust is PERFECTION!!!! The only changes I made was to put a bit of salt in the crust, use 2/3 C lemon juice, and top the bars with lemon glaze when they came out of the oven. Now, I SHOULD have added a little extra flour in the filling, because it was a bit thin after 20 min in the oven. Had to re-bake it when it didn't set (whoopsie), but it came out fine!! Love , love, love this recipe and will make it again and again!

Delicious! I did take away a star however, because I found the base too buttery with an enitre cup of butter. With 3/4 cup of butter, it's perfect! I also added the zest from the two lemons to give it a little more lemon flavour! Great recipie though I like not having to use the store bought lemon filling like Sherrif as I find those have a bad after taste!

I used an extra lemon from the other reviews suggesting it could be a little more "lemony" - with that adjustment, it turned out fabulous!!  There were raves all around, and I returned home with none left.

It seems like people are saying it is too gooey baking at 20 mins and too hard longer. Mine turned out perfect, but I think it was because I made the filling first, as it sat waiting to be added. It became foamy and just a bit thicker. I was able to bake it for 20 mins and it was the perfect texture.     Even using bottled juice instead of the real stuff (used 2/3 a cup) it turned out amazing. I used a dash of salt in the crust, and the salt complimented the buttery crust and sour filling nicely. I will be making this again asap since my beagle got on the counter and ate a third on mine :(

As a lemon-aholic I have been looking for the perfect lemon bar recipe and have tried a dozen+ recipes and this recipe is by far the best I've ever had!!!  I did as other said and used a 8x11 pan and they were perfectly thick and the filling was amazing.  I did a couple of things to kick up the lemon flavor:  1) zested the lemons and infused the sugar with the lemon flavor of the zest by rubbing the sugar and zest between my fingers 2) added some zest to the crust mixture.  Definitely a keeper - thanks!

These are very good and much easier than the recipe I normally make from the Better Homes & Gardens plaid cookbook. I liked that it used regular sugar instead of powdered sugar too, since I didn't have any powdered sugar on hand.

The best lemon bars by far! Easy to follow recipe and do as it says: NO SUBSTITUTIONS. Once out of the oven you have to let it rest to firm up a bit. It's a great recipe and not to sweet but with the right amount of tartness. Highly recommend this one. thx!

I took someone's suggestion of adding 6 eggs instead of 4, 8 T flour instead of 4 and 3/4 cup of lemon juice. The lemon flavor was perfect, but the overall appearance of the lemon squares were off. Once cooled it had huge cracks in it and the powdered sugar I sprinkled on top was absorbed, making it look kind of wet. I'm thinking next time I'll follow the original recipe, with 3/4 cups of lemon juice.

I have tried many lemon bar recipes and by far this is the best one!   I did have to re-make the crust because when I mixed the crust up the butter must not have been soft enough and when it baked it was to crumbly.  The next one I melted the butter and then mixed every thing together with an electric hand mixer then patted it in the bottom of a glass 9X13 dish and it tuned out perfect.  I did have to cook it about 5 mins longer than stated.  I did follow the advice of some other reviews and used about 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice(3 lemons) and the zest of 2 lemons.  These were so yummmy, the right amount of tart to sweet!!! I will definitely make them again.

I'm eating one of these now and I feel like I've died and gone to lemony heaven. I made the following changes:  I cut softened margarine into the flour and sugar mixture and lightly kneaded the dough before pressing it into the pan, which I'd greased and lightly floured.  I used 6 eggs and about 3/4 cup lemon juice (3 lemons)  I added the zest from the 3 lemons.  I doubled the flour.  The resulting lemon bars have a generous amount of tangy, not too sweet, filling. Plus the bars are easy to get out of the pan.

I used the filling in this recipe to use up a bit of leftover shortbread crust (almost identical to the one in the recipe), and I just demolished a fourth of it by myself... It works well with less than half the crust called for too, which is what I did, so I had a thicker filling. I baked the whole thing in a round cake pan, no problems!

These were absolutely delicious!  I used three lemons as others suggested which equaled 1/2 cup of juice.  I took the suggestion of putting foil down in the pan first and am very happy I did.  Some of the topping went through an area of foil that I ripped and I couldn't pull it off the pan.  If you don't use foil then make sure to coat the pan with cooking spray.  My children who hate everything I make even loved these!  I am going to make these for a party this weekend.  Nice and easy too.

great recipe! I added one more lemon and made 1/2 cup lemon juice and it made it very tangy, which I like.

Ick.  Way too much butter in the crust!  Besides being way too buttery the crust was also very bland.  The next day it was soggy.  The custard/topping did not have nearly enough lemon flavor.  I'm looking for another recipe.

My first attempt at making lemon bars, and they turned out fantastic!  I did, however, have to bake the crust much longer than stated and still didn't get a golden brown color.  Didn't seem to affect the flavor at all.

Excellent lemon bar!  I love lemon bars, but I have never made them.  These were so incredibly easy too.  I followed the advice of others and put 1/4 t. salt in with the butter, sugar, and flour mixture.  I also measured out 2/3 c. lemon juice (from a bottle) and added the 1 T. flour.  They were so excellent!  Everyone at church raved about them.  I will make these over and over and believe me that says a lot!

This recipe is a good starting point, but after reading many reviews it requires too much tweeking to be rated 5 stars.  Picking and choosing from the many tips, here's what I did and the bars came out quite tasty.  Crust - added 1/4 tsp of salt and 1 tsp of zested lemon peel.  Let butter soften (but still cool) and cut it into the dry ingredients.  Filling - Wanted a thicker bar so I scaled the recipe to 55 and used those ingredient amounts (6 eggs, etc).  Used my hand mixer ( I'm not a good whisker) to beat the eggs until frothy.  Added dry ingredients and beat again.  With the sky high price of lemons, I used 1/3 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice and 1/3 cup bottled lemon juice, then added 3 Tbsp of flour and continued to beat.  Stirred into mixture 3 tsp of lemon zest.  Poured onto slightly cooled crust and baked at 350 for 25 to 30 minutes - edges just starting to turn golden brown.  Maybe it was using the hand mixer, these came out with a real nice thin sort of light sugary white looking crusty topping while the inside was just the right consistency.

Yummy! I reserved some of the crust and chilled it until the crust was done. I added the lemon filling and lightly sprinkled the crust crumbs on top. It works very wells as long as you are very careful about putting them in the oven.

I made this first time- they tasted like egg bars. Since the type of lemons is not specified, it varies what kind you will get and how juicy they will be..  I reduced the eggs from 4 to 3  and squeezed 1 cup of fresh lemon juice- which was really about 5 lemons. I also added the zest of one in the crust and remaining 4 lemon zest in the topping. They came out better than the ones I have had at coffee shops.

This recipe was so easy and excellent!  My husband's mom makes lemon bars that he raves about so I decided to make them for him for father's day.  He always has said that his mom's could be a bit tarter so I added lemon to 2/3 cups.  I didn't add any extra flour and they still turned out perfect!  He said they were better than his mom's so that was great for me:)  Thanks for the recipe!

Hats off to the poster/creator of this recipe! It is an amazing balance of tart and sweet. The shortbread crust is a pefect accompaniament to the soft lemon filling. Like another reviewer, I'm not a huge fan of graham cracker crust...to me it is too sweet. I made this recipe to take to a cookout. I wanted something simple that I could throw together after working all night, and something that would go with any type of food. This fit the bill...it is so simple to make, and lemon goes with goes with everything! This has been added to my line up of favorites! I printed it and filed it in my allrecipes folder, which is filled with only the very best recipes. Thanks so much!

These were really good. With a few modifications they would be even better.  Following the other reviewers, I did 2/3 c lemon juice (3 med size lemons), added 1 tbsp of flour to compensate for the extra liquid.  Added the zest of 1/2 lemon to the base and added the zest of 1 1/2 lemons to the topping.  I baked in a 8x11 pan (because I was worried they would be too delicate to transport to a pot luck).  My husband thought the filling could take more lemon, so next time I will add the zest of all the lemons.  The changes are minor and he has asked several times when a new batch will be made. I will definitely make these several times over the summer.

I've made these twice in the course of one week and these bars were very well received. I did not change the amount of sugar but did add vanilla to the egg mixture. Bottled lemon juice (half cup) worked just fine; the first time I added some lemon zest as well, and I think this made it a little better. Dusted with some powdered sugar at the end. Not too tart but with a good lemony taste; the buttery crust was great (added about 1/2 tsp salt to the mixture).

Super easy! This was my first ever attempt at baking lemon bars and they were perfect--tart, but not overly sweet, and even better the second day when the flavors really sink in. Juicing the lemons by hand was a pain but well worth the effort! :)

For over a decade I've been looking for the perfect lemon bars. This is it! Unless you like a very thick crust, cut the crust to two thirds of the original recipe. And use at least 2/3 c. lemon juice in the topping. You'll get a tart yet sweet, light and airy bar.

I suck at cooking but this recipe was easy to follow. I added lemon zest as recommended by another reviewer and glad I did. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly and the lemon bars turned out fantastic. Will definitely make 'em again.

This recipe makes the best lemon bars!  I made some minor changes as suggested by others and added salt to the crust.  I also added 1 extra tablespoon of flour to the filling as I used 2/3 cup of lemon juice - you can use the imitation lemon juice it works just as good in a pinch.  These taste so good - never any left!

These bars really are the best. My nine-year-old brother ate like six for breakfast once! (he got in trouble of course...) and my friend Sarah is paranoid that she won't get to German Club in time and they'll all be gone. The only thing I have to say about these is that the recipe calls for "two lemons," which isn't very specific. I would definitely find medium sized lemons, because these are very lemony. I also usually grate the lemon zest from one of the lemons and throw it in, which makes it a little more tangy. Other than that, perfect!

Excellent.Fresh lemons from a neighbor so had to do something with them.  This was a great hit and even took a plate of them to my generous neighbor who later asked did I need more lemons to make more bars!

followed recipe exactly. super simple. wasnt sure how thick to make the crust so just pressed it to fit the baking dish and ended up being about 1/4" thick maybe less (9x13 glass pyrex baking dish and crust came about 3/4 up the side of it) was perfect with the amount of filling. not sure why so may people felt the need to change this recipe. author was correct when she said 'Hint: No Substitutions!' but i guess tastes vary. i thought it had the perfect crust, perfect amount of filling and consistency and the right amount of lemon taste. will never make the boxed version again!!!!!

The first time I made these I used 2/3 cup of lemon juice. From experience juicing lemons one lemon yields approximately 1/3 cup. I also used 1 tespoon pure lemon extract because of what other reviewers had said about the taste not being tart enough. I also used all 4 eggs.  For my taste they wern't tart enough and even though the crust is really good, it does overwelm the topping.  The second time I made them with lime juice, also using the lemon extract, but cutting back to 3 eggs. It was better and the topping set up just as good with only 3 eggs. With one less egg I perceived the tartness better. However, if I was to make these again I will make the topping using 1 and 1/2 times the recipe so the crust doesn't overwelm the topping.

Wonderful buttery crust but not quite lemony enough - wish I'd of listened to a few of the reviewers who stated this.  I think it needs one more lemon.  I did add some zest and topped with some sifted powdered sugar.  Thank god I'm giving these away or I'd eat em all - lacking lemon flavor and all.

Wonderful!  I baked the crust for about 25  minutes to get it truly golden.  These have a great tart flavor and the crust held up well and didn't crumble, which is a problem I've had with other recipes.

How do you rate divine?  I did pay attention to other reviewers who said it needed more lemon juice.  I used a total of 1/2 cup juice and adjusted the flour for the mixture to 1/3 cup.   (did I mention they were melt-in-yout-mouth)????  OUTSTANDING Patty!

My daughter and I made these last night, exactly as directed, for her classroom cookie exchange. Wouldn't change a thing, they're really good as is. Gooey lemon goodness over a rich, buttery shortbread-like crust. What's not to love?!?  They were a big hit with the 8-10yo crowd, but I might make them a little more lemon-y for adults who, like me, would appreciate more zing.

Very good.  I made just as the recipe is written.  I took them to work and it only took 45 minutes for the whole batch to disappear.  Easy to make.

Great texture! I followed the advice of other reviewers and added more lemon juice. They were so sour that they were inedible. The texture and crust were really wonderful, though! I will be trying again and following the original recipe.

I made these as written. I did however bake them in sprayed tin foil which made them easier to lift out of the pan. My family loved these. Just the taste I was looking for. Next time I will bake in a slightly smaller pan 8 x 11 to make the lemon bar thicker.

Loved it! Used extra lemon and it was perfect for my taste. Maybe next time will not use so much zest as was suggested by other reviewers. I loved the crust to filling ratio- perfect!

Very good recipe.  The crust was perfect.  I did note that the "filling" was a little less than expected, next time I will make another 1/2.  I also added LEMON ZEST (which I pureed) of two lemons and some yellow food coloring.  EXTRA:  I added about an 1/8 inch of melted RED SEEDLESS RASPBERRY JAM to the top after baking (to make it smooth & spreadable - it will re-congeal).  This was a perfect wonderful flavor match!  This recipe is definately a keeper!

Wonderful recipe everytime I make them there gone one suggestion is to use lemon extract and lemon juice for a strong lemon flavor.

I made two trays of this recipe: one with lemon juice and butter, the other with lime juice and margarine. For those who find the original recipe to have an overpowering butter flavor, I suggest using margarine instead. The bars still taste delicious minus the butter overload. I also used the juice of three lemons/limes as other reviewers had suggested. In the future, I will only use two limes in the lime version as three limes made the bars a little more tart than I would have liked. Three lemons in the lemon version was just the right amount. All in all, I found this to be a simple and delicious recipe. I will definitely make these again.

These were everything you expect a lemon bar to be. I changed a few things. I used 2/3 of a cup of lemon juice, used to cups of sugar and another tablespoon of flour. They were excellent and very rich!

This was my first lemon bar recipe and it came out very well.  I added lemon zest and some extra lemon juice like other reviewers suggested and the flavors were perfect.  Another adjustment I made was to let the lemon bars cool in the oven (with the oven off and open) to keep them from cracking.  I also added confectioner's sugar at the end.  I will definitely make these again.

These were really quite good. I substituted Splenda for Baking for the sugar and it worked pretty well, although the volume was a little less. Also, the Splenda, being so sweet, reduced the tartness a bit. You might want to add lemon zest or lemon flavoring to increase the zing.

This is a great recipe! With a few changes, so I could make it at work, this is one of my most requested desserts. I did double the filling though and add a little more lemon juice. I, personally, don't like sweet lemon flavor. It was a big hit!

I made this twice, once with the recipe as written, and once with recommended changes including increasing the custard to crust ratio. Even after all the tweaking, I think I prefer the box mix in the future.

I made them twice, following these directions exactly and got great compliments both times.  Somebody remembered them from a month or two ago and requested I bring them to a picnic this weekend with her name on dish.  Easy, short list of ingredients, perfect.

The filling is nice and lemony, and the shortbread crust is great. However, I do agree with other reviewers that there isn't enough filling. Next time I will double the filling, and buy a micro-plane to get at that zest! There will definitely be a next time. :)

I do not understand why there would be a need to change this recipe. I read the reviews and then opted to go with the original recipe- It was a good decision because everybody loved them and they went fast - they were deeeliish- thanks for the great recipe -just as is.

These are very near perfect.  I read most of the reviews and completely agree...added lemon zest, juice to my taste, and baked in a 9X11 pan so my bars were thicker.  Strictly a matter of your preference.  This recipe is very adaptable to adjust to your taste, make it, you won't regret it.

great recipe. I made it with 7 small limes, did not have lemons. I did follow the suggestions of others and added lime zest to the filling, a tsp of salt and a tbs of flour to the crust. I made it this afternoon brought it over and got compliments on it. i tried it and ate 4 small bars could probably add like half the pan with no problem. Will make more this coming Sat for a friends son's birthday party.

I always hate giving a recipe a low review, but I did not care for these at all. The crust had a good shortbread flavor but it was WAY too greasy. The filling was very, very sweet and hardly tasted like lemon at all. There was also more crust than filling, which seemed backward to me. I don't know if I'm just used to a different kind of lemon bar or what, but no one in the family ate more than one bite.

I decided to use this lemon bar recipe over the "bake sale lemon bars" recipe for 2 reasons; they both had the same ingredients in different amounts, and the reviews on the bake sale lemon bars were too 50/50. I just put my lemon bars in the oven for the last 20 minute bake so I'll have to update this review as soon as I taste them! But so far, so good... I did add 1 1/2 tbsp of lemon zest (being careful not to over zest), and it took 2 medium, 1 large, and 1 small lemon, to be exact, for me to reach the 2/3 cup of lemon juice (as suggested by other reviews). I decided to add the extra tbsp of flour also suggested by most of the reviews. I had a bit of difficulty spreading out the crust to line the bottom of my 9x13 metal pan, but if you're patient with it, and spread it as evenly as possible, the dough is just right to fit a 9x13. I baked the crust for 16 minutes, and it came out perfect! Not browned on top, but perfectly light-golden brown on the corners and edges. The recipe did not state to let the crust cool, so I didn't start mixing the filling together until the crust was completely out of the oven (allowing it to cool for at least 5-10 minutes while I mixed the filling).***UPDATE*** Baked, cooled, sugared, & eaten. The crust/filling ratio was off (too much crust) but it came out pretty good. Not too sweet, not too tart. The top of the bars had this chewy baked over crust (the browned part of the filling) which I couldn't ignore :( so that's why 4 stars.

I've made these a couple of times and they've always turned out great.  I agree that the original recipe needs a bit more crust, but the custard is perfect in my opinion.  A little tangy, but keeps me from eating the whole pan in one sitting.  As an experiment, I substituted kiwi juice and it also turned out great with a softer taste.

I love lemon bars and this recipe did not disappoint!  I used 6 TB of fresh lemon juice and took the advice of some and added 2 tsp. of lemon zest.  I will make these again and want to try it with limes next time as the submitter suggested.

This was yummy; my partner liked it, especially the thicker crust.  I made as directed but as I would prefer a thicker and more tart filling, I think I will double the filling portion and either increase the lemon or decrease the sugar.

Very good, but you have to grease the pan!  The first time I made this, the crust was completely stuck to the pan, but everyone loved the top and was just scraping off whatever they could get.  The second time I followed the reviewer's tips and used 2/3 cup of lemon juice in the 8x11 pan.  That was a little too tart for our tastes. Next time, I'm going to lessen the lemon juice.  Update:  This is my 3rd time making these.  The first two times I made these, I melted the butter and it made the crust into a dough.  This made the crust soft and really good and an appropriate match up for the lemon taste.

I must suggest using Meyer lemons. They are very sweet lemons that some people eat like oranges. They are a richer color than other lemons. And I have found the zest is better in cooking and baking. These lemons will ensure that the bars will not be too tart, but you can still use 5 lemons and get a great lemony taste. I found mine at Whole Foods. They were about $3 per pound, but I got 4 lemons in just under a pound. Lemons in the other grogery stores are so darned expensive at .79 each, this was no more expensive as a result. I believe Meyer lemons are native to Australia, however, they are grown in California. I can find them year round, but they go fast, so the store is often out of them.

I've seen prettier lemon bars, but these taste absolutely fantastic. The only thing I changed was to add 3/4 cups of fresh-squeezed lemon juice instead of what the recipe called for. The lemon was just perfect, the shortbread was just perfect. I cut them into small squares to make them go further. I'd be eager to try the lime versions too!

This came out nothing like the picture for me.  I agree with another viewer, not much filling and should definitely be doubled.  Also, need to up the lemon--I used 4 small lemons and it still needed more, in my opinion.  I will keep looking for a good lemon bar recipe.

A lovely recipe, perfectly refreshing and simple. I am pretty sure I could eat one of these lemon bars every day. I followed the recipe more or less as written, but incorporated several of Mommyfromseattle's suggestions. I used 2/3 cups lemon juice (1/2 fresh and 1/2 bottled was what I had) and added 1 extra tablespoon flour. I also added the zest of 2 lemons. I made it in the size dish called for and it was the perfect amount of crust for me. I used margarine instead of butter for the crust and added 1/4 teaspoon salt. The perfect lemon bar, THANK YOU!  *****EDITED 4/3/09 TO ADD: I still adore this recipe. Just thought I would share one of my failed attempts: the crust shouldn't be made in advance! I had my crust already in the oven when I realized I didn't have enough eggs for the filling. I put my cooled crust in the fridge until I could get more eggs. The next day I completed the recipe as usual, but sadly much of the filling seeped down between the crust and the pan. It made a real mess, didn't set up properly or look right, and really affected the taste. Absolutely my own fault, not that of the recipe, but I thought I would mention it in case anyone thought they should try it this way!

These are by far the very best lemon bars on this site. I've tried a few others, and I'm sticking with this one. Not to go against the submitter, but you CAN substitute. I used Smart Balance for the butter, 3/4 c. Egg Beaters for the 4 eggs, and 1/2 c. bottled lemon juice for the 2 lemons, and they turned out great!! I can't wait to try them with the lime flavor.

Like everyone else, I increased the amount of lemon juice. I used the juice of three lemons and the zest from one lemon.

I baked it in a 9x9 square pan because we like thicker bars. Increased the baking time by about 5 minutes.

I used 2/3 cups of fresh squeezed lemon juice (that was four small lemons) and added an extra Tablespoon of flour.  I also threw a pinch of salt into the crust mixture.  These are TO DIE FOR! So simple to make and absolutely delicious. Tart, buttery, with a nice sweet finish.

Don't forget to dust them with powdered sugar.  They look so pretty that way.

Delicious! The filling was perfectly tart with the juice of 3 average sized lemons (about 1/2 cup) and the zest from one one of them. I thought the crust was a bit bland and over-buttery like some others did, but my husband liked it a lot, so there you have it.

I didn't take the time to read the reviews before I made this.  I am going to re-do it for the party I'm throwing on Sunday b/c I think a few small changes will make them even more amazing than they already are!  First of all, make sure you bake the crust itself for the full 20 min., if not a minute or two extra.  I will add 1/4 tsp. salt to the crust next time.  Also, I will use 2/3 cup lemon juice, zest of one lemon, and 1 extra T. flour in the lemon mixture.  Great recipe.

These are simply wonderful! The only changes I made were: I made "lime bars" instead; I halved the recipe since I only had one lime at home (worked perfectly in a 9-inch Pyrex pie plate); and finally, I added the grated zest of one lime and mixed it to the topping, along with the juice. 
Since I used a pie plate, I cut it into edges right before serving. Delicious! Pretty, too, after you sprinkle a little confectioner's sugar. Thanks for sharing this recipe, Patty! We have a new favorite dessert.

these are great! found the crust to be a bit oily, next time will try with less butter, but still absolutely wonderful. I would suggest using 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice and 1 tablespoon more of flour.

After I couldn't find my old reliable lemon bar recipe I searched allrecipes for what looked most similar.  This recipe is by far the standard for what a lemon bar should be. It's no muss, no fuss ingredients and simple preparating make it basically no fail.  Highly recommended for a dessert table extra or the main feature for an afternoon of tea and sweets.

Love these!  A simple recipe with simple ingredients, and a wonderful result.  Many people commented on the crust being too thick.  I thought it was perfect as is.  I did add the zest of one of the  lemons because many people commented on increasing the flavor.  I was extremely happy with the result.  Just want to note that it does stick on the edge, so when cool trim that part off first before slicing so pieces are nice and neat.  I will make these again and again.

These lemon bars live up to their name.  They are "The Best"!  They are perfect with the juice of 3 medium lemons. For my taste, they were too tart when I added the juice of 4 lemons (it was 2/3c.)  I have also made them both with cooling the crust before adding the top, and without.  It made no difference whatsoever.  Both ways turned out great!

These lemon bars are AMAZING! I make a 1.5x batch for a 13"x9" glass pan and think they are a good thickness. I've made them twice now and have used about 2/3 c. of lemon juice one time and close to 1 c. the other time, both were good, but the batch with a full cup definitely had a good tartness to them. Both batches took longer to bake because of the larger size, but I just took the crust out when it was just starting to brown and the whole thing out when the filling no longer jiggles when the pan is gently shaken (I think that's actually what the recommended test for doneness is for the last boxed lemon bars I made XD). Compared to boxed lemon bars, the one thing that surprised me was how much more like a dough (and a *sticky* dough) the crust was, but it turns out really well. I would definitely recommend greasing the pan, although it does cause the very edges to brown or burn, but otherwise they're stuck to the pan anyway! Someone suggested refrigerating the crust to keep the filling from sinking in. I didn't do this the first time and teh bars were great, but I ended up having to the second time (had to leave the house for a couple of hours) and the filling kept falling off the crust when anyone tried to eat one! Not bad, just slightly messier I guess :)

I just made these, and they truly are the best. I used 2 medium lemons and about 4 limes to make it up to 1/2 cup of juice, I also reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cup. Delicious!!!

The first time, I used two big lemons. The second time, I used two smaller lemons that came as part of a big bag of lemons. I noticed that the first batch tasted better - more lemon flavor with more of a tarty kick to it. It's definitely a great recipe for lemon bars.

Absolutely wonderful recipe! Followed exactly and they came out perfect! My dad thought they were too tart, but...umm...it's a lemon square! It's supposed to be tart! My mother and husband, both lemon-lovers, thought these had just the right ratio of sweet:sour. Just one hint: If preparing these for guests, put decorative confectioners' sugar on at the last minute. It looks so pretty, but gets soaked into the bar rather quickly.

Easy to make, not too sweet.  I did like other reviewers said and used 3 lemons.  I also put in almond extract in the crust.  Top is nice and chewy/ gooey.  Only gave it 4 stars because I like it a little sweeter and lemony.

I followed the suggestions and added more lemon to my filling. Way too much for me but still great lemon bars.I will cut the lemon down to half of what I used. That is just me though. I can see how lemon lovers would like more. Just not me. Try them with a lot at 1st and then perfect your flavor every time you make them. Definately add the salt to the crust. Other posters said the crust was bland but I thought it was great. I liked it soft and not crispy. My filling came out real liquidy so I chilled these for 3 or four hours and they came out great. Nice firm lemon filling. I plated them up nice and sprinkled some powdered sugar on the like mentioned. This recipe is a keeper. I got an equal crust to filling ratio using a 9 by 9 pan but make extra filling to be on the safe side. These are very cheap so what the heck. A little more filling definately wont hurt.

These totally hit the mark! I have never made lemon bars before, but sure to love them from the bake sale. Now I can make my own. Thanks!

these bars were very good, however there is too much butter in the crust and therefore was very greasy.  i suggest that you keep the recipe the same and reduce the butter by 1/4 the amount.

The "Best" is right.  I tried the slightly smaller pan idea - making the crust and filling just a little thicker.  Also sprinkled a little powdered sugar on top.  Thanks for the recipe!

EXCELLENT!  The crust was wonderful (I used margarine--was all out of butter). I also added 1-2 drops yellow food color because I like them to be really yellow. They turned out beautifully.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Thank you for placing this recipe online, as it was absolutely delicious!!!  I followed your recipe but b4 I put it together, I read the review from Mommyfromseattle, adding 3/4 cup lemon juice along with more flour.  I was afraid it might of still been a little runny but not at all...I served it to my fiance & his son straight from the oven.  It was so good, then I put it in the freezer to cool and try afterwords and it couldn't be better.  Again, I thank you for placing this recipe online.  This is the only Lemon Bar recipe I have & it will be the only one I will ever use or give out to family & friends...You've done good, Thank you!!!

Yum-o!! These are awesome. I was looking for a delicious, easy recipe because my husband loves lemon bars, and these were perfect. The only thing I did differently is that I used 1/2 cup bottled lemon juice instead of squeezing 2 lemons. The bars turned out wonderfully - perfect tartness, perfect consistency. And SO EASY!!

all I can say is delishous! These are even better than the ones my mom would make when we were kids. I will never use another lemon bar recipe besides this one. I used more lemon juice (approx. 2/3 cup) Really lemony and perfect flaky crust. I loved it!

I have tried many lemon bar recipes, and none of them compare to this one. They are perfectly gooey and sweet, but tart. They are very simple and easy to prepare! I did want to comment that when I first opened the oven to see if they were done, they had an egg smell and I thought I had messed up. Be patient, because they were not eggy at all, just perfectly lemon!

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and the bars came out wonderfully. Very good lemony flavor, good texture too. I did add powdered sugar on top, but they're fabulous without it also!

These bars were fantastic! I am not a lemon/sour/tart person and they were very good. I would however suggest to cool off the crust before pouring or being very careful as the liquid broke into the crust and some of it seeped through, but they still turned out.

These turned out great. Followed the recipe exactly, except it turned out I didn't have enough sugar on hand, so for the filling I used 3/4 cup splenda and 3/4 cup brown sugar, and they were delicious!

Taste was delicious!  One problem with the directions, bake crust until firm & golden-I had to bake an extra 10 minutes to get that & it was way too long.  Had to cut away 1 inch from the edge.  But the flavor & texture of the inside was great.  Tangy and sweet. Next time I won't bake crust so long.

I finally found a reciepe that works!!!! This came out sooo good!!! The only thing is, and this seems to happen with everything I bake, the sides and the corners were like almost burned... So I always have to cut the edges and corners off so I wont have burned marks. 

Anyhow, the only thing I did differently was I scrapped some of the outside of the lemon and chopped it into little little pieces and then mixed it in the batter. This has such a perfect lemon flavor and a nice butter flavor on the crust!! Thank you for this reciepe. If anyone can help me with some ideas on how to get the corners to come out perfect please let me know. Thanks!

OMG this recipe was so fun & easy to make. Especially considering how good they are! My whole family loved them.  My only suggestion would be make two batches because one is only enough for half an hour, believe me! =]

I tries these bars because they were one of the only recipes listed that did not call for confectioner's sugar. My daughter loves lemon bars but also has a sugar sensivity. I substituted splenda for the sugar and they were wonderful! They have become a family favorite.

I loved these lemon bars. They are really easy and very tasty just as the recipe is written.  I used 6 TBSP. of lemon juice, which was what the bottle said to use for 2 regular sized lemons.  Only four stars, though, since you have to refrigerate them and eat them cold or they get really gooey.

I only give this 4 stars because the recipe isn't quite accurate. Follow other reviewers' suggestions about lemon juice amount and baking time.. they'll turn out great!

I love these bars! However, I did make some adjustments. I used 6T of lemon juice instead of fresh lemons and I added a glaze to the cooled bars. 1c of icing sugar with enough lemon juice to make spreading consistency, spread over top of the cooled bars. Amazing!!

Very good bars. I did up the lemon juice to 2/3 cup like other reviewers (and added 2 tbsp flour), but I think next time, I'll use 1/2 cup, as they were slightly too tart. I think that the juice of 2 lemons is too subject to interpretation since lemons come in different shapes and sizes. Otherwise, this is my new standby. The crust is fabulous!!

I couldn't decide between making this recipe or the "love the mama lemon bars" recipe, so i made both!  After passing the bars around to a group of very hungy taste-testers this recipe won hands down.  I did add a bit more lemon juice and flour to compensate for the added moisture, but the bars turned out flawless!  Thanks for the outstanding recipe!

I was looking for a quick and easy lemon bar recipe and found this one.  It turned out well!  I took others' advice and added a dash of salt to the crust, greased the pan with PAM and used 1/3 cup of lemon juice (not from real lemons).  They turned out sweet, so if you're looking for something tart, I'd recommend using more lemon juice.  Yum!

These were delicious, the crust (with the suggested salt amount)had a great texture and were a little thicker than the lemon part. Be sure to press the crust down firmly when you bake it.  However, the lemon part was both sweet and tart and worked great with the crust. They balanced each other out. I sprinkled it with confectioners sugar when it was cooling. It was a tad too tart for me, but this is with all the changes suggested from the other reviewers (2/3 cup lemon juice).  It took quite some time to make, but it was worth it. I'll definitely make it again.

I agree with other cooks, juice of 2 lemons is not nearly enough. Andi next time I will put some lemon zest, too. Also, be careful not to overbake the crust (when it gets golden it's already late, I'm afraid!). All in all, the need of these changes is the main reason why I gave 4 stars.

I used this to make Lemon Bars for the first time, and it was really, wonderfully easy and they turned out great. I added a little salt to the crust and added an extra lemon since I like a strong lemon flavor. Next time I will bake the crust a bit longer than suggested; this crust was a nice consistency, but closer to pie than cookie. Still great, though.

Fantastic! Positively the best lemon bars I have ever had! To make them more elegant try a simple drizzle of raspberry preserves or melted white chocolate.

This is my favorite lemon bar recipes. It turns out perfect each time. I agree with previous reviews, add a little sale (1/4 tsp) to the crust. Do not overbake crust! Also use at least 1/2 cup of lemon juice (i love meyer lemons) and let cool before eating or they tend to be runny. Fantastic and easy recipe

This was my first time making lemon bars from scratch -- they turned out great!

I added the zest of the 2 lemons with the filling, so yummy!

This is a pretty good recipe, except that I found these to be too sweet, even for my taste. I will be making these again, only I think I will use only 1 cup of sugar in the filling. I made mine in an 8 x 11 pan, and the only adjustment was that I had to bake the crust and the filling/crust each an extra 10 minutes. I would recommend not adding extra lemon juice, unless you want these really tart, 2 average sized lemons will do just fine. Other than that, these had a really nice texture, and were very easy to make. Dusted with powdered sugar, and they looked perfect.

5+++!!!  These are perfect and so easy.  Just like Mom's.  I had some fantastic lemons from a backyard tree so I opted to use the juice from 3 lemons instead of 2.  I added an additional 1/8 cup of flour to compensate for the extra juice.  Amazing result.  Thanks for this submission.

Oh my!  I'm pregnant so when I was craving lemon bars - I NEEDED them!  So today I made these using a 9x9 pan because I wanted a thicker crust, which I added 1/4tsp of salt like suggested by others.  I used 1 cup of lemon juice (that's how lemony I needed them!) and the rind of two small lemons.  I increased the flour to 5 1/2 tbs. so that it would set.

Oh yum!  These are wonderful!  Absolutely lemony and delicious!  Will definitely make over and over again - at least while I'm craving lemon!

These were great!  I used 3/4 lemon juice (from the bottle) and some zest (more the better).  I used the 1/4 teaspoon salt to crust.  Everyone raved, they were very good and easy to make

Although this recipe was a little too sweet and I opted to add lemon zest to make it tart as I think lemon bars should be, overall I think it is an excellent an really easy recipe.  I LOVE recipes with few ingredients.  This recipe is excellent and better even is that it is ready made to yield a lot.  Which judging from the times I've made them now you will need.  EVERYONE loves them.

These lemon squares were just what I was hoping for. I added 1 full cup of lemon juice because I like them extra tart and 1/4 tsp salt to the crust as another reviewer suggested. I have tried a couple of other lemon square recipes and this one will be the only one I use from now on.

I made a 1 1/2 recipe in the 9x13 pan and then added a few extra tablespoons of flour to the lemon mixture.  Liked this consistency a lot. Also added a dash of salt to the crust.  Came out thick, rich and decadent in the 9x13 pan.    This is now going to be my lemon bar recipe.  My mom couldn't keep her hands off of them!  Yummy!!!!!

Also quite delicious making recipe as is.  Don't need any powdered sugar on top...tastes great without it.  Tender, buttery crust and delicious, not-too-sweet filling.  Best eaten the day after making.

I used 6 tablespoons of lemon juice, which gave a very nice lemon flavor.  But all in all the whole lemon bar wasn't all that good.  Usually with my family when I bake something they like it is gone that day.  This actually lasted a few days.

These are the best! My grandma used to make these all the time and I always looked forward to them. Now, my husband hates anything lemon so I make them for myself every once in awhile. I use 1/2 c. powdered sugar in the crust instead of white sugar and 1/3 c. lemon juice instead of juiced lemons and still get a great result.

YUM!!  I increased lemon juice to just shy of 3/4 cup (it was everything I could get) and it was wonderful.  Love the tip for lime bars too.  Will definitely make both for a great presentation next time I need to bring a desert to a potluck.

I make this lemon bar recipe all the time! There is a very light lemon flavor when the recipe is followed exactly. I usually juice my lemons and add more lemon juice until I have at least 2/3 cup. I love the shortbread crust - yum.

Excellent... It turned out very well. The crust was moist and sweet and the filling was perfect. I used margarine instead of butter and 3 small lemons. Definitely worth baking.

I used Real Lemon juice rather than juice lemons.  It took about 9tbls to get a true lemon flavor.  Toan extra ZING, I added some fresh ground ginger.  It is a sbutle flavor

These were just ok. Easy to make, but lacking in lemon flavor. I added a teaspoon of lemon zest to the filling but it didn't help much. Perhaps an addition of lemon extract would be helpful.

I've used this recipe twice. Both times I added vanilla to the crust and zest to the filling. The first time I did not get to taste them and I only got one the second time so i am guessing they pleased my family. I don't really follow the time but go by the look of the crust (a light golden brown) as to whether it's done or not because all ovens are different. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe.  I drop fresh blueberries and raspberries into the egg-lemon mixture after it is poured onto the crust.  This provides extra tartness and makes the bars look even better.  Perfect summertime treat.

I loved this recipe!  Old-fashioned lemon bars just like my grandma made.  I juiced 2 lemons and ended up with 6 T juice, and I added 1 T or so lemon zest.  Perfect and really lemony!  Thanks so much for a great recipe.

I was craving a chewier, more lemony and tarter version of this- crust was too buttery for my liking as well.  I used almost 7 Tbl. lemon juice and sprinkled powdered sugar and both myself and my fiance didn't care for these- though if you like bland bars, these are for you.

these were good and easy to make, but do expect the crust to be soft.  also, i doubled the amount of lemons to make the filling tangy.

This recipe was very disappointing...the filling was very chewy, and not very lemony. I would not make it again.

Overall, this is a great recipe.  Even though it wasn't quite as lemony as I normally like in a lemon bar, it is still really good.

Simple, quick and fantastic! I can't keep enough of these around for my family.  They absolutely love them...I even tried a "citrus" blend with grapefruit and orange instead of the lemon and it actually came out pretty nice -- my grandmother loved them! Great to make when you have a few extra lemons hanging around from your summer lemonade!

This is a yummy recipe. I’m so happy I made it. I made it as written but added 1/4 c of lemon juice and a couple tablespoon of the zest like others suggested because my husband loves the tart. Hands down, the best! Today I felt like making it again but this time used Girl Scout shortbread. Wow!!!

Delicious as written. Used slightly more than 1/2 cup lemon just. I also had some lemon zest at hand, so I added that to the crust before it baked. Not sure about that practice in general, but it turned out great.

Near perfect...so deliciously  tart and sweet. I added a cup or so of blueberries and it came out just wonderfully. Best when chilled and served cold. 
I’ll be tweaking this one slightly, adding some vanilla to the base and baking the base a touch longer. I used 2/3 c. juice and it was exactly the right amount. Next time, I’m going to go with fresh juice and zest.

Wow! Whole family loved it. Our lemon tree had abundant fruit this year so of course we had to make lemon bars. I doubled the lemon pudding part. Perfect, sweet and tangy.

I love this recipe so much but the one thing I do to add to it is I Zest My lemons to give the Lemon bars more color and flavor....I Started doing this after trying the original recipe...It adds a more bitter taste but It can be fixed by adding powder sugar when They are done.

Perfect, great recipe! Only tip I have is to let the crust cool before pouring filling on to to avoid the egg cooking too fast. Definitely will be making again soon!

Made it exactly as the recipe described. Turned out perfect. Baked the crust for maybe closer to 25 minutes, but other wise just as labeled. No joke better than the lemon bars at the local spots. Used a metal baking tray.

Used three lemons rather than two... increased the flour in the topping by 1 tablespoon to compensate for increased lemon juice... need approx 2/3 cups lemon juice.   Topped with dusting of powdered sugar for presentation.

this was my first time that I made something like this. I followed the recipe pretty close. I did add 1/2 teaspoon of concentrated lemon juice in addition to the juice of 2 lemons. I also added zest of 2 lemons.  I found after baking and cooling a white covering on the custard. It did not effect the taste just the appearance.   I will try again at a later time

These lemon bars are easy and amazing and take less than half an hour to prep. A few tips:

- The “juice of two lemons” is, in my opinion, too little and too vague. Depending on how lemony you want them, I use an overflowing 1/2 cup of lemon juice from a bottle. 
- Feel free to mix the crust mixture with your hands. It turns out crumbly and perfect. 
- For me, the crust takes longer than 20 minutes to bake. I recommend putting it in for 20 and testing the crust with the back of a spoon to see how hard/soft it is. If a noticeable amount of soft crust comes back, leave it in for another 5 minutes and check again. 
- The crust usually doesn’t turn out perfectly golden, but a tan color still tastes delicious. 
- To make the bars look REALLY lemony, add a drop or two of yellow food coloring to the lemon mixture before adding it to the pan. 
- Of course, sprinkle powdered sugar over the top once cooled if desired. 

Enjoy these simple, delicious desserts!

I baked the crust for 23 minutes to get it golden brown.  Increased lemon juice to 2/3 cup and used Meyer lemons as they are in season right now.

My son requested these in his care package. I wasn't sure about how they would ship. They did wonderfully. I used 2/3 C lemon juice, added lemon zest from 1 medium lemon and added 1T flour to the filling.

Great recipe! I tweaked it a bit by adding 1/4 teaspoon salt to the crust. I also added 1 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice plus the zest of two lemons to the custard. The resulting tartness of the bars was incredible (and addictive)!

Loved these!  Used 2/3 cup of lemon juice and the zest of 2 lemons from the lemon tree in my backyard.  Delicious and tart for our Christmas Eve dinner.  Will definitely make again!

I made this using 2/3 cup fresh lemon juice and zest of 2 lemons. Added an extra tablespoon of flour as stated by another reviewer when increasing the lemon juice. The crust took longer than stated to brown. I also cooked it longer after putting the lemon filling on top. The texture and lemon flavor was good, but most of the people who ate it said it was too sweet.  Next time I would cut down the amount of sugar.

The only change/addition I made to these easy and delicious lemon bars was the zest/peel of the two Meyer  lemons I used.
I absolutely will make them again, and again, and...

Love it, delicious and always a hit. 
Used tbe following recommended tips: to the crust I added a bit of salt and zest, I let the crust cool a bit before adding the filling, in the filling I also used some zest and 2/3c of lemon and added 1tsp extra of flour.

The cookie didn't have enough sugar in it and was to crumbly. The lemon was perfect though, 2 lemons made 8 tbsp of juice, I put 10 tbsp plus lemon zest in my bars. I will probably make a different base with the lemon on top. I also made a lime version with 4 limes for a total of 9 tbsp of juice.

As mommy from Seattle said, 2/3 cups lemon juice is perfect. I like to add a tsp. of vanilla extract as well. The shortbread like crust is what really sells these in the true recipe. Great, easy thing to bake!

I followed the basic recipe for the short bread and added 1/4 tsp salt. I used a 9 x 13 pan (metal).  For the second layer, I used 2/3 c fresh squeezed lemons from my yard and 2 big tbs of zest. I zap the lemons for 30-40 sec in the microwave to help them let loose with the juice.  I also increased the sugar to 2 cups and the flour by 1- 1.5 Tbs for the increased liquid. I also cooked them about 5-10 min longer. Sprinkled with powdered sugar, and let them cool for an hour on the counter. Then I covered them and put the tray in the fridge for another hour and they were ready to cut. DELICIOUS! Buttery, tart, just the right amount of sweet.

Use a higher lipped baking pan. Used salted butter for the shortbread crust. Definitely looks better with powdered sugar on top! Have yet to try, but it looks good!

I added a little bit more lemon juice because I like my lemon bars a tad bit tarter than sweet. I also added a little bit of lemon zest.

My family couldn't get enough of these. They are chocolate people, so I didn't think they'd care for these too much. Boy was I wrong! I made these in 24 cupcake liners. I split the dough equally and flattened it into each liner with the bottom of a glass (covered with wax paper to prevent sticking). They were wonderful treats and easy to store in the fridge.

Tasty and neat (for lemon squares). A little sweet for my liking, but the top settled nicely, so it will be presentable for guests.  We substituted margarine for butter, and the crust was a little too dry.

I made these and they taste amazing! I had quite the adventure making them though. Everything went smooth until I went to put the whole thing in the oven to cook. When I did I accidentally spilled the lemon liquid all on the bottom of the oven. I turned off the oven and waited for it to cool. Once it did, I cleaned up the oven and turned it back on. But uh-oh... it was burning. So, I was forced to scrub the door of my oven and the bottom with baking soda and white vinegar until everything was scrubbed clean . Took around 2 hours for me to make but they are cooked, powdered, and delicious!! Thank you so much.

Used 1 1/2 of organic unbleached flour and 1/2 cup of organic coconut flour and added shredded coconut as well
For the filling: used 3/4 coconut flour, 4 eggs, 2 cups of organic purecane sugar and 3 oz of Malibu Rum. Delicious!

I found the crust a bit bland, my only complaint. I doubled the topping, made 2 batches. I didn't double the crust as some viewers said 1 batch of crust was a lot, which I agree. I'm sure this recipe would have been great if I wasn't so airheaded. I doubled the lemon juice but forgot to double the sugar, so I used 1 cup lemon juice and 1 1/2 white sugar. They were tart! Also the crust floated to the top when I baked it, so the lemon was on bottom and crust on top. I've never had that happened. But I did use Reynolds's disposable baking tin instead of a pan.

Great lemon bars but it was a little doughy. So I doubled the lemon mixture the second time I made this recipe and it was a lot less doughy.

This is the best Lemon Bar recipe I’ve found. I followed the recipe to the “T” using 2/3 cup lemon juice and an extra tablespoon of flour, and it turned out deliciously tart and lemony! Definitely a recipe I will continue using!

Just the perfect  amount of lemon, not too overpowering. I made this dessert for a 4-H dessert and everyone liked it. I had several compliments about the crust. This is a nice, simple dessert that folks will enjoy.

This is a fairly simple recipe that makes good lemon bars. Wish there was a specific measurement for the lemon juice as all lemons give a variable amount of juice. (A medium lemon gives approx. 2-3T of juice, a large one gives about 4T - according to thekitchn.com). I had a lot of Myers Lemons which can give 1/2-1c of juice, so I had to experiment and found that about 3T worked well. I used this higher amount as this type of lemon is milder. 
I made this recipe twice. Once as written and a second time substituting granulated Splenda for the sugar - equal amounts. We actually like the sugar-free version the best!

These are fantastic and easy to make as I'm not much of a baker! I added some fresh mint and basil since I had it on hand, upped the fresh lemon juice a bit, added a little extra flour and sugar to the crust to hold up to the extra juice, and voila. Perfection. I should also say that I don't have much of a sweet tooth but couldn't stay away from these. Would probably be great with lime juice subbed for the lemon juice as well (although I'd omit the fresh herbs)!

These really are the best lemon bars. I made half the recipe, and it still worked out great. They remind a relative of his childhood. Not too tart, not too sweet. I am about to make it a second time. Best recipe ever!!

I read the reviews and made some mods to suit our taste (tart! thick!). Crust: I used an 8x8 and halved the amounts. I also refrigerated the crust before baking (and the filling before adding to the crust - but I think that's less relevant). Filling: I upped it to 2/3c. fresh lemon juice, added zest of 2 lemons, slightly less sugar, and I beat the eggs before adding. I baked it until set (didn't take note of how long, sorry). They're FANTASTIC. Wow. Lemony as anything. I like the ratio of crust-filling, too!

I loved these lemon squares. I thought the recipe was great the only thing I changed was I used about 2 tbsp less sugar  

The crust to filling ratio was perfect for me but that’s probably because I’m easy to please when it comes to lemon squares. This was the first time Ive ever made them  and it was quick easy and painless. I was worried about how they would turn out. I wasn’t sure 2 lemons and no zest would be lemony enough. But they were awesome. The guys at work devoured them. I was told and I quote. “These lemon bars are fire miss Jackie”. Which apparently is a high compliment.

These turned out great for me. I did take other reviewers advice and modified the recipe slightly. The base I left alone except for the addition of salt and about a tbls of Cardamom.
This is the recipe I used for the lemon layer:
6 eggs
2.5 cups sugar
1/2 cup + 2tbls of flour
1 cup Lemon Juice
1.5 tbls of lemon rind
I baked the base for 15 min. Let it cool for another 15, poured the lemon layer in and baked another 30 minutes. They set up perfectly. This is now my go to recipe for Lemon Squares.

I had to cook the shortbread crust 28 minutes to get the right done-ness. I also increased the lemon juice to 2/3 cup to make sure the lemon flavor came through and also increased the cooking time to 25 minutes for the custard to set. I took them to a dinner party and everyone loved and asked for the recipe.

I have made lemon bars several times and have enjoyed them, not so with this one.  "Squeeze two lemons" doesn't give the reader knowledge of how much lemon to really put in the mix, if you really want a stronger flavor I would put in 7 tablespoons of lemon juice. 
The top part of this lemon bar recipe baked up kind of rubbery to me, when slicing into it the top layer comes up from the lower layer, the two should be baked together with softness, gooeyness.  
  There is not a mention of baking powder here, which gives it a little bit of rise.  
   Powdered sugar is great, in crust as well as wet mixture....then sprinkling it on top when it comes out of the oven.

I did a trial run for my daughter's wedding, good thing I did. I used a bar pan instead of a 9x13, my mistake! Waaaaay too thin. I will definitely be making it in the 9x13 as directed for the wedding. The flavor was good but too thin

I made it exactly as described except I did line the pan with parchment paper for easy extraction. The pan I used was a thicker style ceramic pan not glass or metal (maybe that makes a difference). Otherwise, followed it exactly and it was perfect. Wouldn't change a thing...Buttery and delicious, they cut nicely too - great idea for bake sales!

Not the best. There was practically no height on the lemon, crust was very crumbly. Agree with what others said about more lemon. I used 3 and zest of 1 lemon and that wasn’t enough. I’d suggest 5 (I just used concentrate for the pinch). 
Per the instructions for the lemon part, I did sugar/flour whisked with all 4 eggs, then added the lemon. I’m wondering if whisking eggs first then slowly adding sugar/flour and finishing up with lemon juice would have given more height?

I don’t think I’ve ever reviewed a dish on here, but this one is not a good recipe for lemon squares at all! So here I am. There are much better lemon square recipes available. Ratio of crust to lemon “curd” is way too high. Too much egg for not enough lemon juice. The lemon “curd” in this recipe is unusual for a lemon square; it’s not thick enough at all. I usually use a double boiler to make my curd and should have just don’t that for this. I will never make this recipe again and am super disappointed in it since it has such high reviews. I like the crust and it was easy, but it’s too much compared to the lemon part. Would use the crust again with my grandmother’s lemon curd recipe to make this a decent lemon square recipe. It taste fine, but definitely didn’t wow me. Definitely do not recommend if you’re looking for a traditional lemon square recipe.

This is a veeeeery good lemon bar recipe, but on the filling of the bar, I used 1/2 c sugar, and the juice of 2 big lemons, plus the zest of 1 of them. I love this recipe, and I am making more of them right now!

My favorite dessert, decided to try this recipe and it was a success.  Followed the instructions to a T, made no changes and the results were fabulous.  I even won third place at a baking competition at work!  Will definitely make again.

The lemon flavour was great. I thought it would be more curd-like than it was. But to be honest I'm not sure if that had anything to do with the change I made to the crust. I needed a gluten-free option so made the crust with almond flour, which made the crust a bit less cookie-like.

I am no a baker, but was craving lemon bars.  Decided to make these and was not disappointed.  Very easy to make and not a lot of cleanup.  I added the zest of one lemon to the filling.

I have never made lemon bars before and rarely bake anything. I made it the first time following this recipe. It does not as beautiful as the video but everyone keeps telling me the lemon bars taste amazing! People come back for second and thirds. I lost my sense of smell so I cannot tell but people are telling me they can smell the lemon from far away. Thank you for the amazing recipe.

Great! I added a 3rd lemon and used 2 lemon zest, some of it in the crust, and a pinch of  salt to the crust as well. To cool my crust before adding the filling I put a towel over it and set it infront of a fan, worked great in our 90 degree + weather!

As suggested I used 2/3 cup lemon juice, added additional 3TBS flour.  I used 2 Pillsbury sugar cookie  rolls and pressed this in a 13x9 pan lined with parchment paper.  Recommend cutting after chilled.  Lemon flavor was perfect.

I've been using this recipe for years. I like it buttery, very citrusy and not as sweet. 
The shortbread recipe is unchanged, I use salted butter so I don't add extra salt to it. 
Instead of adding more lemon juice (and messing with the crust to filling ratio) I simply add less sugar in the filling (1 cup instead of 1.5 cups). 
I juice 3 lemons (or limes) and it usually falls between 1/2 -2/3 cup. 
I've done it with zest and without, but to me the less sugar in the filling is what really brings out the flavor.
Lemon or Lime is very tasty (I add green coloring to the lime ones)

Sooooooo good! I definitely followed other members here advice by adding an extra 1/4 cup of lemon juice to the custard. I also did half lemon juice from a lemon and half from lemon juice. This is one of my favorite desserts and I’m not a great baker so I’m happy they turned out so good.

We made it in an 8x8x2 pan since I did not have the right size pan. We used a hair less than 1/2 a cup of lemon juice which is what 2 lemons gave and put zest in the lemon juice like Mommyfromseattle suggested. (we just used a knife and carefully sliced the yellow skin off and diced it, but avoid slicing too much b/c the white part underneath the yellow skin is bitter) She suggested 2/3 cup of lemon juice is better and I would agree to use that because the lemon custard was delicious and enough but it could use a bit more to be 100% satisfying. The 8x8 pan was too small for the amount of crust, so my crust is super thick. The lemon tart is delicious, but if the lemon bars were made in a bigger pan where the crust could be a normal thickness I could only imagine the lemon custard part being very thin with just 1/2 a cup of lemon juice. The recipe says nonstick spray is not suggested. I used another gluten free recipe for lemon bars which called for putting parchment paper around the pan and spraying the parchment paper with nonstick spray, and it may prevent the lemon tart from getting burnt at the edges. However my recipe didn't really follow the instructions so I am not sure if that's normal since my lemon bars did get burnt a bit at the edge.

These were absolutely awful.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Crust was way too thick and filling was skimpy in spots - simply not enough filling for the pan size.  Almost no lemon flavor.  Disappointing; I made these for a get-together and they were so bad I couldn’t take them.  So, in addition to the cost of the wasted ingredients, I had to buy a bottle of wine!

So I’m giving it five stars based on the proportions, ease & flavor but I had a couple tweaks.  I only had one stick of unsalted butter, but who wants half a batch of lemon bats?  I used the stick plus 1/4c + 1tbsp olive oil for the second half .  Added a half tsp salt to the shortbread to make the lemon pop.  Went to 1/2c lemon juice plus the zest of one large lemon and used a heaping 1/4c of flour in the custard.  They came out amazing!

I added 1/4 teaspoon salt to the crust. I found that there didnt seem to be enough liquid custard, so I doubled the liquid recipe, using 1 and a quarter cups lemon as well as some lemon zest along with doubled flour/sugar/eggs. They were delicious!

I have  made these multiple times and they always turn out great! I love lemon and sometimes take out a little of the shortbread so there is a higher filling to crust ratio,  but that is just to my personal standards. My entire family loves these and one time I even whipped up some meringue to put on top. These are amazing and my go-to lemon dessert!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong.  I made a half batch of these in an 8x8" pan.  The crust tastes almost too buttery.  Also, as I read another review, I agree that the juice from the lemons is too vague.  I looked for the right equivalents of juiced lemons to regular lemon juice online, and came up with 1/4 cup of juice per lemon.  I guess it depends on the size of the lemon.   Mine could have used a little more lemon flavor.  The bars were edible, but, I think in the future I need to find a new recipe, or adjust this one.

I loved these bars.  My husband thought I needed tp put more lemon zest in them although it’s not in the recipe.  I doubled the recipe like some reviewers suggested but the crust was too thick for my taste.

Fabulous! I made this with Gluten Free flour blend. After reading twenty or so reviews I added a total of half of 3/4 c plus 1/4 c of lemon juice from the bottle. I also used a smaller pan. Because I 3/4 the recipe

It probably taste and looks amazing but when I tried twice it came out in an egg consistancy, looked like egg, and smelled like egg. i don't know what went wrong, I followed the recipe exactly. I would like some feedback before saying bad things about it.

I used the juice of 3 lemons, which ended up being about 2/3 cups of juice. I most certainly would not use any less! Also, I would suggest spraying the sides before pouring the lemon curd. 

You should also let the crust cool before pouring the lemon curd. 

Bring the eggs up to room temp. 

Use salted butter for the crust. 

Bake the bara until the lemon curd is just set. In other words It should jiggle like jello but not be stiff or liquidy. 

I personally don't like this crust, it needs something else.  I love the lemon curd recipe.

I added zest to both the crust and the topping. Couldn’t resist the opportunity to add a touch of almond extract to the crust. With 1 and 1/2 recipes of topping, this becomes a bit indulgent.

My crust was very thick so i ended up doing 1.5 of the recipe for the lemon portion to make them more proportioned and it seemed to help not make them so dense. Otherwise I loved them!!

I made this for my daughter’s bridal shower which had a ‘lemons’ theme. They were delicious  and a real hit! No changes needed. I used 1/2 cup of lemon juice which was perfect.

Some how I found this recipe on this website and I decided to make it spontaneously. I shared the dessert with my family and friends; they loved it. It didn't last more than two days!! I will definitely share this recipe and make it again.

Note: parchment paper worked best for me

I followed the original recipe and it was fantastic - all my guests LOVED it. They were a little sweet (to me) so next time I may add a little less sugar or a little more lemon juice.

Like many others, this is simple and delicious. I made the same change that many have done: increased the lemon juice to 2/3 cup and increased the flour, due to the extra juice,  by 1 Tablespoon. I’ve made it now for two bridal showers and it’s delicious.

I really like this recipe, the only tweak that I made was that I juiced more than 2 lemons.  We like our lemon bars to be tart, so I normally do about 4 lemons.  Though, sometimes I juice more lemons depending on how tart I want it.  This has become a go-to item if I want a dessert that is not sickly sweet.  Thank you to the author of this recipe!

This is the first time I’ve made lemon bars. I followed recommendations in other reviews such as increasing the lemon and used a smaller baking dish. Unfortunately, I misread the recipe so my custard came out a little chewier than it was supposed to. I am still giving this four stars because the flavor was exceptional and my mistake should not count against the recipe. I will definitely make these again and follow the recipe correctly.

Turned out great!  I let the crust cool a bit before pouring the topping over it.  I also added another lemon and another 1/4 cup of flour to the topping so as to make them more lemony.

This is a good recipe, although I did add more lemon juice per some other recommendations. The crust is thicker than I'm used to and I didn't think I liked it initially. But after sitting around for a day or two, the crust became chewier and I really liked it.

Perfect. Definitely increase lemon juice to 1/2  cup. With that mod they turned out great!

This recipe made a subpar bar.   The cookie was not the crumbly, shortbread that makes the quintessential lemon bar, probably due to the use of softened butter instead of cutting in cold butter.  The lemon layer was thin, gummy, and barely had any taste of citrus.  It should have called for at least double the lemons and possibly zesting them, too.  I suggest you keep looking before resorting to this one.

I made no changes.  They were deliciously tart and easy to make.  The crust was basically shortbread/sugar cookie.  Don't shortcut- use real lemons!

The crust was super and crisp. Even the lemon filling was gooey and delicious. My only "problem" for lack of a better word is, my inability to cut the bars into clean pieces. The gooey stuff was sticking to my knife and I had a hard time cutting slices cleanly. Any tips for this? How can I make it less sticky?

Made this to bring as a dessert after Easter dinner.  It was a hit!  Not too lemony and a very nice buttery crust.   Yes I will make this again.  Next time I am going to try to make it with lime.

Absolutely amazing! I used 3 large lemons for the juice and 2 of their zest. The tartness and butteriness was absolutely amazing. Highly recommend.

Fantastic. The recipe is fine as is, but I did take advice and added a little extra lemon and some zest, just to kick it up a notch. I also cut back the sugar to have it less sweet (personal preference). The sugar called for is probably fine for most if you like sweets. I made this for Easter. The baking time for the crust worked fine for me. I did add a bit to the filling part - another 4 minutes or so. It sets when you chill it in the fridge. Also suggest letting the crust cool before adding the filling, so it doesn't all melt in.   Because I made this for Easter, just after I had dyed some eggs in blueberries, I topped the bars with the blueberry compote so it didn't go to waste. I also used a springform pan instead of a square baking dish - just for appearance. But it worked fantastically!

My family loved these and they didn't last long. I used some of the suggestions offered by others in the reviews (more lemon juice, lemon zest, and a little salt in the crust) and they turned out great. Will definitely be making these again!

My instincts told me to let the crust cool before pouring the lemon filling on top, but I wanted to just try the recipe as stated.  Pouring the lemon filling on top of the warm crust caused all the lemon filling to get baked into the crust itself and not have distinct layers.  Also 20 minutes of bake time was too much and edges and top were too brown. The end result looks more like a lemon crumb cake than traditional lemon bars.

I've made lemon bars with this recipe three times now with the first time being the only untweaked. My immediate CRITIQUES of the original recipe are:

1) Filling is not lemony enough. Needs the juice of about 4-5 lemons.

2) The filling was too sweet. I cut the sugar in half. 

The base shortbread crust recipe is great and I kept it as is. 

Tweaks I made were:

1) Filling: Added more lemon juice (about 3-4 lemons)

2) Filling: Increased baking time to about 22-24 mins

3) Filling: Cut sugar in half

4) Filling: Added lemon zest to top of baked crust and again on top of unbaked filling before putting it into the oven.

They were very good, but the reason I gave it 3 stars is because the lemon mixture on top is very sweet and it can use more lemon flavor.  I did add an extra lemon because I read other reviews that said it was lacking in flavor , but it still needs more .  Overall it was not to bad .  It turned out like I said earlier pretty good.

I went with the earlier suggestion to use 4 oz. of lemon juice, and 4 oz. of lime juice in another pan of these bars. Delicious! Super easy to double the recipe, and I can’t wait to try other citrus fruits instead of lemon.

I tried to follow the directions but the custard seemed off. Will try it again and see if it was user error. Tasted fine but missed that wonderful melt-in-the-mouth joy that comes with good lemon bars.

The dough was too thick personally. I used a larger pan than it called for too. Aside from that, I followed the recipe strictly. I wasn't a fan of these. I use LARGE lemons (2) and my bars still didn't taste of lemon. "Two lemons juiced" is vague. Should definitely try adding an actual measurement in the future. The texture & appearance were spot on. Just wish the flavor was. Super disappointed.

Take the advice of some of the reviews. Add a little salt to the crust, add 2/3 total lemon juice or a tad bit more, bake a bit longer 10 minutes or so. Perfecto! I’ve made this recipe several times now and everyone wants the recipe and I never bring home extra. Yummy to my tummy!

Before I “play” with a recipe, I like to try the original first. Although they turned out fine, they definitely needed more lemon.  We could taste the crust with a hint of lemon. I may try it again with more lemon or just find a new recipe. Thankfully, there a many to try in order to find the right one for us.

I made these using tips from other AR users (doubled lemon juice, added a dash of salt to crust, and added lemon oil equivalent to zest of 2 lemons, built up edge of crust to contain the filling, then baked in a parchment lined smaller pan). These were absolutely delicious and didn't take much effort or clean up. These will be my go to recipe in the future.

It seems so many people made changes to this recipe. I decided to go with having 2/3 cup of lemon juice and adding the zest of one lemon as well as an extra tablespoon of  flour to the filling mixture. My 2 lemons were large and actually made almost the 2/3 cup. These turned out lemony, firm, and delicious!

these were so good! very lemony—sweet but still very tangy. the crust was a little sticky which was fine, but I’d recommend laying down some parchment paper on whatever sheet you’re going to make it on.

Great tasting and simple! I varied the bake time for the crust a little (it took slightly longer for it to cook for me) and added an extra half lemon of juice (I wanted to make sure it got the flavor) and they turned out gorgeous!

I made this for my mom's birthday.  I used 2/3 c. lemon juice, as suggested by other reviews. I one and a halfed the filling, as it looked too thin in a 9 x 13 inch pan. I had to bake the filling for an extra seven minutes and it came out a little pale-looking. But after it had cooled and I topped it with confectioner's sugar, it looked amazing and tasted even better. Everyone who tried it loved it. I forgot to add an extra tbsp. of flour, and didn't miss it. I plan to make this again.

I made the crust as recommended in 9 x 13 pan and it came out fine.  It browned along the edges but not in the middle of the pan but was cooked through.  I agree with others to use 2/3 cup lemon juice, zest and additional TBS of flour.  I used large eggs and baked for an extra 10 minutes.  It came out tangy, which is what I wanted.   I sifted confectioner's sugar on top after it cooled, which completes the dessert perfectly.

The two lemons was vague, so I used 2/3 cup. If you like them very sour use the 2/3 but if not use 1/2 cup lemon juice. The crust does need a tad bit more sugar but the sweetness of the filling balances it out so its not a huge problem. But overall I love this recipe, super easy to make, definitely my favorite recipe to use so far.

Love it!  Easy to follow recipe. The only changes I made was increasing the fresh lemon juice to about 2/3 cup and decreased the sugar by about 1/4 cup. I also added about a tbsp more of flour. I like more tartness.

I've never made a lemon bar. Ever. I came across this recipe and thought to myself "this looks easy enough." so I gave it a shot. I'm so glad I did because these are delicious! I added a teaspoon of salt to the crust like suggested in other reviews. I also used 2/3 cup of lemon juice since I didn't have any fresh lemons on hand. perfectly tarte, sweet and buttery.

It tastes delicious. I slightly cut off bit butter (3/4 cups instead of 1 cup) and sugar (1.5 cups in total instead of 2.5 cups) and it just works great for me. Looking forward to trying it next time.

This is an amazing recipe.  I hemmed and hawed at reviewing this because I do change things, but it's because each lemon is different and I like it tart.  Because I like it really tart, I always add the lemon zest and taste it.  If it's not tart enough I will add some True Lemon powder from packets (not always).  But I would do that for any lemon bar including a box because I do like it it super tart as does my family.  

What I really love about this recipe is that it make a wonderful crust and has what I consider the perfect ratio of crust to lemon.  I will never buy a box again!

I used three lemons, unsalted butter, I cup of coconut sugar for white sugar and unbleached AP. The bars were not yellow, but they were delicious.

so two things i would add/change to the list of steps, which i did and i loved based on this list.

1. zest the lemons prior to extracting the juice and include that with the lemon juice and eggs.
2. expand the final cook time to include a range; maybe 15-20 minutes instead of a hard 20 minutes.

Other than that this is fantastic. Delicious and simple. First time i made lemon bars and i love them. I may try a smaller dish (an 8x8 or 7x10) as well. Mine looked like a bit of a cake after 20 minutes, but still tasted delicious and the cake-like appearance was just the very thin top coating of the lemon/egg mixture.

Been making these lemon bars for years. I noticed a lot of people on here zest and put the zest in the custard filling but if you put it in your crust you'll get a bit more flavor! I also have experimented with raspberry lemon which went over quite nicely!

Have made this 4 or 5 times now and it has turned out great every time. We have a Meyer lemon tree, so when I use them I reduce the sugar a little due to their greater sweetness.

These lemon bars turned out marvelously! I did a half batch, and I ended up using cake flour, because that's what I had. The crust ended up a little thin, and I didn't cook them quite long enough to get the center firm, but once the lemon layer was on, they baked up just fine.

Used Meyer lemons, and the flavor was divine!

This recipe isn’t worthy of 1 star as the entire thing is going in the garbage.  The crust is so thick - it’s over half of the thickness of the bar in a 8x8 dish. I had to bake the crust an additional 10 minutes. The filling has too many eggs. I had to bake it for an additional 15 minutes for the centre to stop jiggling, and at that point the edges were dark brown. Cut into it a few hours later and the filling is completely raw and runny. Also had to chisel it out of the “ungreased” dish. Since this recipe is inedible, and I can’t get the bars out easily, I might just toss my dish too!

These are the best! Just make sure your crust dough is mixed to a crumble not like cookie dough and hand whip lemon filling. 1/2  cup of fresh lemon juice is perfect! I also will make a cheese cake topping with this for even a super special dessert !!

Too much crust, not enough lemon. You have to bake the crust till it's pretty hard or else the lemon mixture will soak in.

I really liked these but I personally prefer store-bought crust over home-made. But that's just because I'm lazy. Otherwise, this recipe is really nice and light. Though if you decide to add powdered sugar on top, I would wait until you just before you serve, otherwise the moisture just soaks it up.

DEE-licious!! Very lemony ?? and tart, as a true lemon bar should be. I made a couple changes, only to suit my own tastes. I used white whole wheat flour (Prairie Gold, only in the crust) and subbed 1/2 cup flour in the crust with Trader Joe’s almond meal. I like the nutty flavor both lend. Also added the zest from both lemons because why would you waste that wonderful zest? However, I’m sure this recipe would be absolutely amazing as is. I’m very picky (my grandfather was a pastry chef) and this recipe is definitely a keeper!??????

I have made these twice now because they are SOOO good. The base is super buttery and delicious.  The only substitution I made was using 2/3 cup lemon juice instead of squeezing lemons. It's just easier.  This recipe is great because it doesn't call for much that I don't already have in the house.

Didnt change a thing. Had a bunch of lemons over the holidays so was looking for ways to use them up. I'm always surprised how few lemons it takes to get things so lemony. Everyone loved this from young to old.

In other recipes for lemon bars, the lemon topping seems to combine with the crust and become indistinguishable from it. Here I had a clear separation. Should I have cooled the crust before adding the lemon pudding? I combined them immediately after removing the crust from the oven and it worked pretty well.

Hmm.. I am still trying to figure out why this missed the mark a bit.  I think the cookie crust on the bottom could have been baked longer. I baked it for 18 minutes.  I am chilling it in the fridge overnight and will see if this will improve the taste/flavor.

Yum! I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8x8 glass dish. I only had the juice from half a lemon(didn’t measure), and so I compensated by using the zest from the whole lemon. I put a little bit of the zest into the crust, too. I had some issues with the baking time; I baked the crust for 27.5 mins and another 27.5 mins with the filling. I have never made lemon bars before, so I wasn’t sure exactly what to look for. The filling just didn’t seem right after baking for only 20 mins, and the crust wasn’t even golden brown after 27.5 mins, but luckily the bars seemed to turn out great.

I love this recipe!  I used Meyer lemons...they are hard to find where I live so I take advantage when they are in season.  The balance of tart and sweet is just right.  I also added some fresh blueberries after I poured the custard on top of the shortbread. But be careful!! They are addicting!

I generally use this recipe every time I make lemon bars, they come out amazing every time. The crust is really good but I would suggest adding way more lemon juice,  I used almost a cup of freshly squeezed, ifyou want to taste the lemon in it otherwise really good!

No frills or extras, this is exactly what the title suggests. A normal lemon bar. I tweaked it a touch and added 2/3 of a cup of lemon juice. The time to cook the crust was significantly off in my experience. I cooked it for 45 minutes in order for it to brown. You would rather it be overdone than underdone. Other than that, these were great!

So good! The only bad thing about them is how often my friends and family request me to make them. Good thing they are so easy. 

I also added lemon zest in with the lemon juice mixture.

The crust that we made for the lemon bars was good but cracked a little bit. on the other hand, the whole lemon filling was a mess.  when we were putting the crust in with the lemon filling, it spilled all over the oven, and almost started a fire. we all got very angry and threw the lemon bars away. I was very disappointed.

easy go to recipe for lemon bars.  I have saved lemon juice from my lemon tree in the ice cube trays.  I use about 2-3 frozen ice cubs of lemon for this and it is perfect.  Always a big hit!

Easy and delicious! I’ve made these several times, do refrigerate if need to save leftovers for a few days. 
Agree that adding more lemon juice & zest helps make them more lemony. I also cut 1/4 sugar out of the topping and still very good.

Easy and tasty! Exactly what I expected lemon bars to taste like. I think I overbaked the crust, so it took some time for it to be juicy and soft, so my cake tasted much better after two days. I did cut a bit on butter, no need for so much of it. I may cut a bit on sugar next time as well. I used 3 large lemons that were very juicy, and that was perfect, and a little bit of zest, as others recommended.

I made these with modifications as suggested by Mommy from Seattle (2/3 cup lemon juice, 1 tbsp more flour, smaller pan for thicker crust). I couldn’t be happier!  Last time I tried to make these I didn’t cook the crust long enough.  I extended the cook time as suggested. It’s not sticking.. it’s perfect!  Thank you!

My Fiancé & my Dog  loved these !! They had the perfect amount of Tarty Sweet. The crust is like a Shortbread Cookie & is delicious. My Fiancé hates Lemon pie but LOVES these lol thank you great recipe.   Ps. I’d use about 3-4 lemons for that tart lemon flavour

I made these as a "first time" lemon bar maker. They were met with great reviews from friends and family.  I also took a chance and make a second batch that was gluten and dairy free just replacing the flour with almond flour and the butter with a vegan butter and I also substituted the sugar with xylitol on this recipe.  The crusts came out very different but both were good.  The regular recipe crust was crunchy and tasty while the gluten/dairy/sugar free was moist and also delicious just two very different textures.
Family and friends loved them and asked to take some home for the next day!

I added an extra lemon into the batter as well as a small squeeze of lemon on the top. I also shaved some lemon on to the top to finish. You can never have too much lemon and everyone loved them!

So YUMMY! This is a great recipe. My husband and friend love lemon, the more tart the better so I add the rind of 1 1/2 to 2 lemons.

I've made this dessert twice now and I've found the comments very helpful.  2/3 cups of juice is right.  An extra teaspoon of flour helps with firming process.  We like a thinner crust so I used less of the mixture to achieve that.  I thought the Commodores went  very nicely with this recipe.

Decent lemon bar, just a bit funky tasting. The crust and the lemon do not go together very well and the flavors just aren’t there.

It was a hit with my whole family ..I have a gas stove so I had to adjust the temp and the time but overall turned out amazing ! Can’t wait to try it with limes next ! But is there an easier way to spread the crust ?

Easy to make. Just a few simple ingredients, which I love. I used my hands to mix the dough, the heat from your hands helps to mix the butter in without over working the flour. I also added a bit of coconut flavor to the lemon filling, because why not. I threw it into a pie plate because I wanted to serve it as more of a lemon tart at a dinner. Next time I would do it in 2 pie plates . I shared the recipe with my brother who made it immediately and also loved it. This recipe is a keeper.

My positive feedback: The texture of the bar, the overall simplicity of the recipe, the color of the bar, and the ease of tools needed to make it. 

My room for improvement thoughts: I thought the crust could have used salt and been thinner. I also think the added lemon tip is a good one other readers have included, and the tip to play with the crust until you get it browned just slightly.

 Overall, my first attempt had too much butter flavor slightly, but to me a definite 4/5.

I followed the reviews and added more lemon juice (2/3 cup) and more flour (1 tablespoon). My crust started off way too buttery but I'm still waiting for the cars to finish cooking.

I loved the way this crust puffed up. I also took a taste like any good chef would do and it was like a perfect shortbread cookie taste. At first I didn't think when I pressed it down that it would be enough. But it doubled after baking. It needed almost 30 minutes for the bubbling in the middle to cook out and start getting lightly golden, but anyone that loves to cook knows everyone's ovens are a bit different. The filling puffed up nicely, I did use an electric mixer to blend it. The filling looked amazing, I also used an electric mixer on this. I used two large lemons and the zest of one organic lemon. I need zest in anything that calls for lemon. That is where the flavor is! It baked up perfectly in 20 minutes and I could hardly stand waiting for them to cool before tasting. When I finally, accidentally got some on my fingers it was amazingly lemony and delicious! Love this recipe!

I made no changes - but '2 lemons' isn't an exact science and I had small lemons, so I put in 2 1/2, figuring it would be about the same as 2 regular sized lemons.  It equalled 8 tablespoons and was a good amount of flavor.  Didn't like the texture of the top.  It was dry and almost rubbery.  The flavor was great, but I'm supposed to serve it at a gathering and the appearance isn't very great.  The top split open in areas and isn't consistent across the pan.  I baked exactly as directed for as long as directed.

I made them for a bake sale.  I recommend lining your pan with parchment paper. Next time I will double the filling to make them thicker. They tasted great!

These are the best! We have a Meyers lemon tree, which yield a smaller, milder lemon than most found in grocery stores.  We have found that using 2/3 cup lemon juice is perfect!!!

I wasn't sure at first about how it would turn out, but this recipe is so easy to do. When you make the filling make sure you mix it well. When it was cool enough to eat I felt the filling was a little loose, so i put it in the frig, but that made the crust hard but the filling came out better, then I left it at room temperature, but I will make it again, but I think I might add some cornstarch to the filling , but will let you know how it is. It really does taste better then box mix that I have tried before for sure, and I will make it  again.  It does also stay well at room temperature, but make sure it is covered.

The crust was delicious.  I did add 1/4 tsp salt due to reviews.  I also increased the lemon juice to 2/3 cup and upped the flour to 1/3 cup.  I used a 9x13 glass pan and did not grease it.  Bars came out of pan nicely and were so yummy!  Saves time this one to my favorites!

AMazing lemon bars as written!  Only thing I added was to sprinkle with powdered sugar lightly while they were still a bit warm. The crust is to die for. Thanks for the recipe!

EXCELLENT! Wow what a great recipe! These turned out wonderful! Don't listen to all those bad reviews. If you follow the directions, they turn out perfect. 
I used 2 large lemons. It was a little more than 1/2 cup of juice.

I would give it 5 stars but the  crust does taste way to buttery!  I even added the salt like someone suggested.  The filling was delicious. I also used 2/3 cup of lemon juice and added an extra tablespoon of  flour.  I would make this again if I can figure out how to make the crust without all that butter!

Everyone loved these (and I'd accidentally overcooked them.) We had fancy gourmet donuts at work on the same day.  No one came back for seconds on donuts, but they did for the lemon bars!

I only tweaked the recipe a little! The only difference is in the lemon juice I put some lemon zest and a drop of lemon oil  to make it more lemon-y! They were a huge hit!

This recipe is easy and perfectly delicious! Perfect combination of tart and lemony. It would be helpful to list the amount of lemon juice to use, not the amount of lemon. I juiced 3 lemons instead of 2, and it tasted a bit better. So I were you I would experiment with the lemon juice.

This recipe was not good at all. I’ve never given a bad review and I hate to give one now but these lemon bars were disgusting.  I’m by no means a novice baker and rarely ( maybe even never) make something my husband won’t eat.  I’m left scratching my head trying to figure out where I went wrong when so many said this was a 5 Star recipe. This isn’t even worth trying to make again. We love lemon and had high hopes about these lemon bars. Bummer

Delicious! I only gave it 4 stars because it just doesn't have the lemon bite that I look for in a lemon bar. Lemon flavor, sure. Lemon bite, no. I don't know about anyone else, but I need a little pucker with my lemon desserts. Next time I'll change nothing with the recipe (the crust is amazing and got the most compliments) but will just add the zest of both lemons. I'll definitely be making this again.

Excellent and simple.   I did add more, SORRY, I know the recipe said no substitutions, :).  
However, whenever I bake with tart and sweet, I always add a pinch of salt, well almost always.  This really balances the tart and sweet.
I also added zest from the three small lemons that I used to get the 1/2 cup of lemon juice.

I made orange bars using this recipe. I used half cup of freshly squeezed orange juice and zest of one orange. Some how the base got a bit dry n it was crumbly. But the taste was nice. Eveyone like it.

I own a Cookie Shop. I have made these for about the last 2 months. My ex is one of my best friends and yesterday she tried them and said  "These are the best lemon bars I have ever had" It is common to hear that. these are simple and delicious.

I added extra lemon juice. I changed this recipe a little to include limes to make lemon-lime bars. The extra lemon juice made the dish more savory. I loved the crust. It makes a perfect combination with the lemon filling.

I did make sure I had at least 2/3 cup lemon juice.  Increased the flour by just a tablespoon. And added the zest from one of the larger lemons. Delicious and easy!

Great easy to make recipe.  I used 1/2 cup lemon juice  and about a 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.( I have very small lemons about 5 in total). It came out a little tart so next time I'll use 1/3 cup or I won't add any zest. I did taste the raw batter and it tasted sweet  enough at that time.  Crust is great, taste just like a shortbread cookie. Not sure why some people said it  didn't set right, it has 4 eggs and very little liquid added how could it not. Only con I have with this recipe is the 2 lemons measurement!!!!! Are you from the future, where every lemon is the same size or something???? Thanks for a good recipe all jokes aside.

Best lemon bar I have ever had. It’s not too sweet or sour and it was so easy to make. Thanks for the recipe.

I followed the recommendations of many others and used 2/3 cup of lemon juice and extra flour for a zesty lemon filling. I agree that juice of 2 lemons is not very descriptive at all! The only drawback IMO is there is too much crust...or not enough filling. I've made this twice and doubled the filling ingredients second time. It is a luscious lemon bar and always a hit with everyone! I agree that buttering the dish or adding parchment makes serving out of the pan much easier. I did not do that the first time and the crust stuck to my pan.

These are so delicious!!! My boyfriend is absolutely obsessed with them and swears they are the best he’s ever had (and he lived in Europe for a while!!) I add and extra lemon to my batch (maybe I’m just a bad lemon squeezer) because two isn’t enough for our taste. Thank you so much for sharing!!

The shortbread was so delicious and the lemon filling in my opinion had the perfect amount of lemon as is, with a very small amount of zest. I will definitely make this recipe again.

The base recipe was good, but I ended up adding 1 3/4 cup of lemon juice while doubling  the batter recipe for one batch.

Great recipie. I have made it quite a few times. I changed things just a bit. I like my lemon bars really tart, as does my husband. So my changes are.... I double the filling for the ingredients as in the recipie but I also, zest (roughly) and juice 2 lbs lemons (I juice over a sieve to remove pulp and seeds). I also blend together the sugar and flour till combined. Blend the zest in and then add al 8 eggs and blend until a pale fluffy yellow, after that I add the lemon juice and mix very well. The zest will get stuck in the mixer paddles, just bang that off into the batter.  I add a sprinkle of baking soda to the crust and leave the 1/2 cup sugar heaping for the crust. Dust with powdered sugar at the end and the pan will be gone same day!!

Because i am eating low carb and virtually sugar free, i changed out the all-purpose flour for almond flour, and used Truvia baking blend, plus coconut sugar. It came out delicious!

Yum! Only change I made was to add more lemon juice and to add lemon rind to the filling because I really like sour lemon filling to balance out all the sweetness of the sugar. Other than that, it's delicious. I've made this recipe at least 5 times!!

Grapefruit bars--I made this with commercial grapefruit juice, not from concentrate.  Very nice, not quite as tart.  I used corn flour for the crust; as written I wish I had used slightly less flour for the crust, it's a bit dry.  Update!  I have now also made this with Mandarin Oranges,hand juiced.  I used powdered sugar instead of crystal in both the crust and the filling.  Yum!

I made this just as it is except with a bit less surgar and being sure to bake the crust thoroughly.  It turned out amazing.  Served it with fresh blueberries for dessert and guests all raved about it.

I made lemon and lime. The crust was too sweet for me. And I more than doubled the juices to try to get it as tart as I like it. They were ok, but I will def keep looking.

The reason why I love this recipe so much is because not only is it delicious but it also creates such a delicious tart flavor that I savor. I found this recipe in a blog that creates a cool lemon bar soap recipe. Who thinks these would look cute in your kitchen? http://www.naturesgardencandles.com/blog/2017/06/

I had a hard time gauging the amount of lemon juice to add. My lemons are super juicy so we had close to 1.5 cups lemon juice.  So I added it all.... they were tart, but still good. And my shortbread crust wasn't very flavorful.... not sure how I could've made it more tasty. But still yummy nonetheless

I need to learn to read reviews before making recipes. I ended up throwing the whole batch out. First off there wasn't enough lemon filling to cover a 9x13 pan and second off they got so hard I couldn't even cut them. Maybe I did something wrong but I followed the recipe exactly.

I made these for a bake sale! Unfortunately, I was one of two people who brought something, so no bake sale, but some people did try it. It was great, although there was a bit of a bitter aftertaste in the part that was 90% eggs.

Crust is a little bland, if squeezing fresh lemons then 3 lemons wouldn't hurt. Still delicious though.

Love this recipe!!! So easy. Taste very Good.  Just add more lemon if you like it tart. I just can't get my lemon mixture to rise that high like the picture. Any suggestions?

I noticed in the video that they stuck the measuring cup in the flour and scooped it up but if you want to get an accurate measurement, the correct way to measure flour is to spoon it into the measuring cup and then scraping it level. Measuring flour as they did in the video tends to pack the flour into the measuring cup resulting in a much denser  outcome.  I never thought much about it until I realized there was a noticeable difference in the end. All and all this was a good recipe

Everything was really good but it is sorely missing lemon zest. I put a tablespoon of zest and about 2 teaspoons of vanilla and then it smelled right for lemon bars. The crust came out like a shortbread cookie which went splendid with the filling. 
For people making this make sure the lemon bars are semi cool when you put the powdered sugar on it. I didn't do that and it melted. (still tasted amazing but if you want the finished look that comes with powdered sugar make sure it is cool)

Delicious! I substituted the flour in the curd for cornstarch. It definitely needed more lemon juice though, I recommend using three to four lemons.

Delicious! I followed the advice of others and used a more precise 1/2 cup of fresh-squeezed lemon juice (took about 4 lemons total, 2 small and 2 large). I added 1 tablespoon of flour to the lemon mixture to accommodate for the extra liquid, and added some salt to the crust. I kept it in the prescribed 9x13 pan and I thought the size was perfect. I was able to get equal amounts of crust to topping. I needed to bake for about 10 min more for both the crust and topping, because as others said, it is better to overbake than underbake. Wonderful, especially after refrigerating.

The following notes are mostly for me... soooo... I can't give this a 5 star rating because I did change it according to some of the reviews. I used about 2/3 cup lemon juice and the zest of two lemons as suggested. I also used an 7x11 pan, but wish I had something in between that and a 13x9. Because I used a smaller pan, I did have to cook both the crust and the filling about 5 extra minutes. I loved the tartness of them, and think they would have been too sweet with less lemon juice and zest. I'll definitely make again.

Lemon bars are a good choice of dessert, treats and anything sweet you could want. I made a batch for a bake sale. When the bars were done and I had cut it up I noticed that the crust was a little thick and the actual lemon part was smaller than the crust. Now it's likely I made a mistake in the making, but I believe that I followed the recipe to a T and perhaps the portioning of the recipe itself is a little off. But as baking goes there are a multitude of things that could go wrong even if you follow the recipe exactly, and despite this it was still a very tasty treat when I sampled one. I shall probably bake this again to try and fix my mistake and so that me and my roommates can have some to ourselves.

I have never made Lemon Bars before, I thought this was  a great way to start! They absoutly loved them at work! Very easy step by step insturctions. After reading the reviews, I added some extra lemon (the juice of 3 large lemons), not sure if it was necessary, but it sure tasted lemony.

I used 5 lemons - because we LOVE lemons...I can't imagine it with only 2. I also added a bit more flour to compensate for the extra liquid. Other than that, it was SO good. Each day it was better than the next!

These lemon bars come out perfect and they are so easy!  What I love best about them is the natural lemon juice that is used instead of extract.  I think the next time I make them I will use Meyer lemons and increase the lemon juice to an extra 1/2-1 more lemons just to make the flavor stronger.  But they cut perfectly and hold together so well.  I will definitely make these again.

These came out perfect. I added a heaping 1/4 teaspoon of salt to the crust and baked at 350degrees for 30 min. For the top i used 2/3 cup lemon juice and the zest of 2 large lemons. To make the perfect zest please note: use a veggie wash and scrub brush or baking soda works great too. The chemicals on your lemons will taint your recipes. Also don’t grate any white peel just the yellow. This will give you so much more flavor!!! I also added an extra 1/4th cup of white sugar to compensate for the lemon juice (this is optional, i have a sweet tooth and like my desserts sweet). I also added an extra tablespoon of flour and a bit of vanilla (about a teaspoon). I poured immediately on hot crust and cooked for 25 minutes. When done i lined the outside edges with a wet knife and stuck in fridge and dusted with powdered sugar after they cooled a little bit. I noticed these taste wayyyy better on day 2 so i would make them the night before you plan on serving. :))

These were very good. I sprinkled a small amount of powdered sugar over the top, mainly for looks. I might add extra lemon next time.

i have made this recipe many times, and have been trying to get it just right. this time, i used 3 large lemons, and juiced them good.
also, i used a wooden spoon to press the dough into the pan. in the past, the dough would stick real bad to my fingers.
every time i have made these, they have been a hit!

Twice I made these & twice they failed.  Both times they came out & it was almost like a crust had formed on top, rather than the custard-like filling. The first time I made them I followed one reviewer’s advice to add a little extra flour if using extra lemon juice,  so I thought that maybe I added too much, so I gave them a second shot, and followed the recipe exactly, and the same thing happened. The first time the bottom of the crust also burned even though I followed the cooking time exactly. I would love to know what i’m doing wrong here??

I did this recipe with oat flour and I agree the crust needs to be thin and perhaps a bit sweeter. Always add the zest of the lemons to enhance the lemon flavour in this type of dessert.

There are so many reviews here, everything I say is probably already here.  But here goes - (1) I agree with the top rated helpful review - put the lemon zest in the custard.  I found a grater with almost small square, very fine holes - it is the kind you hold with a handle like a pancake turner. The brand is Microplane spice grater (cinnamon, ginger etc.)  I got lucky and bought it at a garage sale, new.  Before using, I wouldn't have paid the asking price of $14.95 but after having used it, I would now.  It is so easy to control and clean. The teeth are super sharp and it is effortless.  Clean with a brush.   You don't get hardly any pithy stuff when zesting oranges and lemons.  (2) I used 1/2 fresh lemon juice and Italia or Sicilia - they taste like fresh.  I can't believe one reviewer wrote that she used Realemon. That is awful. Especially after using the two brands I mentioned.  I did use 2/3 cup juice and added the extra Tbsp flour.    (3) I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 Imperial margarine. (4) the biggest change, I guess, was 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white all purpose and 1/4 tsp salt in the crust.  I put some salt in the custard too.  (5) strangely, they stuck to the pan a bit so I will spray lightly with cooking spray next time or use parchment paper. They were super lemony and super good.  Everyone at the school recital fund raiser dinner liked them.   

** PS i made a double batch the first go round and used a spring form for one.  Although I know spring form pans are

These were very easy to make. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used 2/3 cup of fresh lemon juice (the juice of 3 lemons), as well as the zest from 1 lemon. If you do use the extra lemon juice, be sure to add about 1 tbsp extra flour to the filling. I also added 1/4 tsp of salt to the dough for the crust. I took them to a gathering at a friend’s house and everyone raves about them. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Love this recipe. We have made it in several nations around the globe and it is always a hit. Definitely add more lemon, 2/3 cup and a bit more flour to offset the extra liquid. Plus we always add a 1/2 tsp of salt to the crust.

My hubby and I both enjoyed these.  Very simple to make.  Next time I will extend the cook time by 5 or 10 minutes on both the crust and the filling. Others suggested more lemon juice which I may experiment with next time  But even as written, these were delicious.  I am adding this recipe to my keeper file. :)

I used powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar in the crust, because that’s how I’ve always made lemon bars and I was afraid to try it with granulated. These were delicious! Very tart and lemony, just the way my husband likes them. Will definitely make again.

This is a great lemon bar recipe. I made it for the first time and it turned out great. There are a few changes that I made, such as using 2/3 cup of lemon juice and a tablespoon more of flour to the filling, adding a 1/2 teaspoon salt, lemon zest and a teaspoon of vanilla to the crust.  I also baked the crust for 10 minutes longer. I will definitely use this recipe in the future!

The base is far too thick and the custard topping far to thin when using the quantities indicated in the recipe.

Absolutely love this recipe. Before making this i saw some people say it wasn’t enough lemon, so I made it as directed but I made an icing using 2/3cup powdered sugar and the juice of one lemon. When my bars were firm I tested them out, decided there wasn’t enough lemon and iced them. The icing made a nice third layer and added just enough lemon. I would highly recommend using an icing if the recipe isn’t enough lemon.

I looked at what others shared before I made this so I did make adjustments. I used 2/3 cup lemon juice, and 2 tbls extra of flour. It turned out okay but I agree that the crust is to think compared to the ratio of filling. Also the filling is way to sweet. I had 6 people taste it and felt it was too sweet to eat.I will make this again but will reduce the crust portion and also reduce the amount of sugar and add more flour. This was okay as a base recipe but I will adjust it for the future.

Granddaughter would not even eat this. Crust is too buttery, and no lemon taste at all in the filling. Overly sweet, no tartness detected from lemon juice.  May try again, increasing the lemon juice in the filling, cutting the amount of sugar in the filling, and increasing the sugar in the crust.

I made it as is and it was delicious to me! I left it in a tad longer because I like the crust to be more brown. I only had 2 small lemons and tried to get as much juice out of them as possible. I would definitely try adding more fresh lemon juice if I have more lemons next time.

Nice lemon bar. I keep working on making  a tart lemon bar. Increased to 6 eggs, 1. 5 cups sugar, 1/2 cup lemon juice, added 1.5 tsp lemon extract, 1 tsp grated lemon rind. Nice creamy filling, great crust, perhaps more lemon zest next time.

I agree with others, it’s vague  without a measurement for lemon juice.  I went ahead and used 1/2 cup as others recommended and the bars turned out great. Had it included that, I would have given this recipe 5 stars!  4 Star recipe for needing help from reviewers to perfect it.

I LOVE anything lemon, especially these lemon bars.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time and they were really good.  The second time I added a touch more lemon juice; for my personal taste.   The crust can be sweetened just a touch if you prefer.  My personal additions of lemon juice & sugar do not require adjusting the measurements.  I just sprinkled a bit of sugar on top of the crust before baking.   I took some to my friend who thinks they are THE BEST.  Very easy and tasty with coffee.

I used two large lemons and half of a large orange and these came out nicely “lemony” I forgot to add the sugar to the crust when it was pressed in, so I sprinkled it over and let it melt through a bit before baking. Overall this recipe came out great, but at least in my oven I should have kept them in longer because they did not firm up enough even after cooking and remained too soggy/custard-like. I’ll try again and add a bit more flour to the lemon mixture next time along with a longer baking.

I would have given these a 5 star review if the amount of lemon juice (juice of 2 lemons) wasn't so vague - that said, they are one of my son's favorite treats for Christmas & he said they were yummy.  I thought they were just a bit too tart. Lemons have no standard size or amount of juice contained within, so without an actual measurement your taking a chance each time that they will be perfect, too tart or not tart enough.  I sprinkled mine with powdered sugar to compensate for tartness.

These turned out PERFECTLY!! My first time ever making them,  but a long time fan, I made these for gifting. I took the suggestion of 2/3 cups of lemon juice, as well as an extra tablespoon of flour, and the lemon to crust ratio was PERFECT. Topped with icing sugar, these were a HUGE hit.

I've made this same recipe several times. One of my grandsons declared them to be the best cookie he has ever eaten. Tart, sweet, and lots of lemon. My daughter didn't have a 9 X 13, so I increased the recipe by 1/2 and filled a 1/2 sheet pan.

I made this recipe 2 x's, the 1st time I followed the recipe. It was ok but I felt something was missing like it needed more sugar, also I could barely taste the lemons. The 2nd time I made it instead of 1/2 cup of sugar in the dough, I added 1 cup of sugar. Also Instead of juice from 2 lemons I added 3/4 cup juice from 5 lemons and it came out perfect! 5 stars! The sugar gave it sweeter flavor and adding juice from 3 more lemons omg it gave it a very good tart lemon flavor. So I recommend increasing the sugar in the dough & more lemon  juice to your flavor.  I also sprinkled powdered sugar over all the mars when done!

My sister and I both lost the recipe for lemon bars.  This one fit the bill.

It was wonderful. I used powdered sugar in the crust. I had to use about a 1/2 a cup more of the powdered sugar. I took the advice of others and used 2/3rd 's cup of lemon juice and they turned out great!

I would use a smaller baking dish.  Used 9x13, and they are good, but not too thick.  Others had recommended a smaller baking dish, so will purchase one in the near future.  They were delicious!

Crust was too thick and really dry, I followed recipe to the letter, am I missing something? Lemon filling part was positively delightful, but the crust just stuck right to the bottom of the pan.  I will try it again though.

I’m not sure about this recipe. I made both the lemon and the lime version. I followed the directions to T, let the bars cook for hours, but the topping never hardened. On either one. It resulted in a very soupy top. Both taste good, but mine turned into a  liquidy pudding with some crumble.

This recipe was very good except like others had said, needed more lemon ( I used 3 whole small/med lemons juiced instead of two)  Also as mentioned by others- the crust was very thick ( although buttery and delicious) next time I would cut down the portions for the crust in order to make a slightly thinner more delicate crust. (It turned out about the same width as the curd.)

My 12 yr old daughter started making these for our family about a year ago, and they have always been a HUGE hit. For the most part, I let her do it alone because I want her to become confident in her cooking skills and not try to stand over her too much. With that being said, although I thought they were delicious, I often thought they  should be a bit firmer, so I check out the recipe and showed her all the reviews that suggested more lemon juice and a lil more flour to compensate for the extra liquid. She tried it, and the were over the moon delicious! Proud of my lil baker!!!!

They're very good, but not great. I was able to use the crust batter to fill two 13 by 9 pans, which is great cause I prefer more lemon filling than crust. I doubled the filling recipe and that's where I went wrong. There is far too much sugar in this recipe. I was really hoping for a nice tart bar, but it was far too sweet for my tastes. I'll use this recipe again for sure but I definitely recommend halving the sugar if you're more sour lemon than you are sweet lemon :)

I am planning to takes these to Thanksgiving dinner at friends house so did a "test" run using the suggestion of another reviewer adding more lemon and adding another tsp of flour for filling. These were good and delicious,  but I like a little more lemon bite, I found them too sweet and I did not even put powder sugar. My sugar is cane sugar so that might account for extra sweetness (and I don't have my normal cooking utensils).

This recipe is absolutely delicious! After reading many reviews, I added 2/3 cups of lemon juice (which was around 3/4 cup) & an extra Tbsp of food to balance out the extra liquid. I kept the lemon mixture in the oven for 25 mins, let it cool, and refrigerated it for about 2 hrs before I cut it in squares. Everyone loved them! Definitely a keeper.

I am making the desserts for my engagement party and I really wanted to have Lemon Bars as one of the featured desserts.  So of course I had to do a trial run prior to the party.  Boy o Boy these were delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly, and they came out wonderfully.  I cant wait to have them at the party...they will be a HIT!

I prepared the recipe as is. I think the lemon mix needed a bit more lemon or just less sugar. It tasted a bit too sweet for my taste besides I felt it too eggy. On the other hand, I think the shortbread is very good. I will follow the suggestion of adding a pinch of salt to the shortbread mix and baking it for a bit longer, but will not alter the amount of sugar. It has the amount of sweetness that is just right for my taste. Will update with the modifications. The recipe can definitely be altered to suit personal taste without really changing the recipe drastically.

I made these bars with only one exception to the recipe -- only had 1/2 of a lemon for juice, so added bottled lemon juice to make up the rest.  They were not as tart as I would like.  Next time I will add lemon zest, plenty of juice of real lemons per other suggestions I have seen, also will had a bit of salt to the shortbread portion.  I think with these changes this will definitely be my go to recipe.

I only had 2 eggs so I cut the recipe in half save for the amount of lemons due to other reviewers recommendations. I even added a lime for extra citrus flavor. Used and 8x8 Pyrex and LOVED the results.

Really good. No changes to this recipe. I went by the directions of the lemons, but I would like a little more lemon in my bars next time , probably 1 more lemon.  But everyone loved them. Buttery cookie like bottom is so yummy! Thank you for sharing

Everyone raved about the lemony taste but I personally prefer another recipe in which icing sugar is incorporated into base and it's made in a smaller pan making the pastry thicker and richer.

As others said, it wasn't as tart as desired. I used 2 and a half lemons (came out to half a cup) and even taste-tested the filling before I poured it over the crust. I now realize that the crust took away some of the tartness of the filling, so if you decide to taste test, make the filling a bit more sour than you want. The bar itself tasted fine (I'll still eat it all), but was more like a cookie with a hint of lemon. Several other reviews have great notes on how to make the bars more tart, so take a look at them before you begin. If you don't like sour treats, however, follow the recipe as-is.

It was just too sugary for my taste. I probably would have liked another lemon to make it a little more tart. There was so much butter. Not my favorite recipe.

I don't like lemon, but I had made it for my boyfriend for his birthday. I added a teaspoon of lemon zest and put powdered sugar on top when it was all done. It was a huge hit!

This recipe was not my cup of tea. The crust was way too dry (I drank like 3 cups of milk!) and the filling was way too sour. Some alterations that could possibly make this better is adding more sugar to the crust, adding some lemon zest to the crust, and adding more sugar to the filling. The worst part is that IT'S SOOOOOOO DRY!!! MORE DRY THAN THE SAHARA DESERT!!!!

I loved the recipe but I doubled the crust because I like it a little thicker. Still, the lemon custard is delicious, tart in all the right places with the right amount of sweetness.

I used the exact measurements given on this recipe, and it made way too much of the bottom crumbly layer of the bar. Next time, I would cut the amount of ingredients of the bottom layer in half. The lemon layer of the bar was pretty good, but there was not enough of it. Next time, I would double the amount of ingredients for the lemon part of the bar.

Could be good, but  everything was "almost."  I made the recipe as written, but the cookie part was kind of soggy and there wasn't enough lemon flavor.  Next time, I would cook the shortbread longer and add more lemon  and a little more flour for the added lemon.  Also, I'd probably use a tsp or 2 of lemon zest to bring out the lemon flavor.  As written, I thought these were just okay.

These are amazing!  The only changes I made was to  add lemon zest for a little more zing.  Second change was due to my lemon size.  My homegrown lemons  run larger  and juicier than store bought so I did need to add a bit more flour to thicken the batter.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thank you!

Incredible cookie bars, sweet and tart, easy to make and fabulous!!  I live in Guatemala, and rarely find lemons, but limes are cheap and plentiful, so I used 4 good sized persian limes to make this recipe.  Otherwise, followed it exactly.  I have tried other lemon bars, but without success.  These are, in my humble opinion, perfect.  The crust is crunchy, sweet and tasty with real butter, and the filling, which goes together in minutes, is the perfect compliment, being custardy, tart and exactly the right proportion.  I thought that small bars would not be sufficient, but these are very rich and filling.  I shared them with several people who have never eaten anything like them before, and all were impressed.  Make these.  You will be happy.  To get more juice from your lemons or limes, toss them in the  microwave for about 20 seconds per normal sized fruits.  Not sure about key limes.

The crust a little bit too crumbly, and it wasn't sweet enough for me personally. I used double the lemon juice and that seemed to do the job.

I used a 9x13 nonstick pan and liked the thickness of the bars. Not everything needs to be super-sized. Added 1/4 tsp salt and 1 tsp lemon zest to the crust mixture. Baked 20 minutes at 325 using speed-convection. Cooled the crust completely in the refrigerator before filling step. For filling used 1/3 cup flour, 2/3 cup lemon juice, and 2 tsp zest. Used the full amout of sugar and bars were not overly sweet and had a nice tartness. Baked for 12 minutes at 325 speed-convection, then reduced temp to 300 for another 12 minutes. Heavily dusted with powdered sugar while still hot/warm, then cooled in the refrigerator overnight. Filling was nicely set like lemon curd jelly, and crust was crisp tender shortbread which did not crumble from slicing. Love this recipe!

Fantastic!!!   These are amazing.  I used 3 smaller lemons and mixed the dough by hand.  Just easier for me.  I have made in aluminum pans and in glass.   The glass def needs to cook longer.  Throw powder sugar on top once cooled and they are perfect for any occasion.

I have never had lemon bars before and was excited to try these. They did not disappoint at all! I used lemon concentrate a little more than 1/4c for half a batch and same with fresh key lime juice. Added yellow and green dye (about 6 drops each) and got awesome color in each. In my opinion, the key lime was better than the lemon but I am partial to key lime desserts. Definitely give this recipe a try! Make sure to bake your crust long enough and it wont turn mushy at all after you add the filling.

This is my absolute favorite lemon bar recipe! The shortbread and lemon balance is perfect! The only downside with this recipe, is that the lemon custard tends to separate when you cut the bars, or bite into them, but this could probably be fixed with poking more holes in the shortbread crust before baking, or even not fully cooking the crust before pouring on the custard. Other than that, this recipe is PERFECT and will always be my favorite

Made it exactly as instructed and they came out perfect! Everyone loved them. Out of personal preference, I add a third medium size lemon and cut 1/4 of the sugar in the filling.

I just made this and it didn't look anything like it's supposed to.. the only changes I did was to half the sugar levels.. could that have been the culprit??the lemon filling became a stiff layer - I wonder if I had overbaked it.. but I did bake it for only 20 mins per recipe. Secondly, the filling did not adhere to the crust and got separated. Thirdly, the crust was too crumbly and did not hold its shape when cut. I ended with a mess of crumbs in the pan and a stiff jam top.. :(

I loved this, but I also made changes that I think made it so yummy. More lemon, less sugar. 3/4c of lemon juice, 1full teaspoon of lemon zest (from two lemons), 1c sugar.

I also used a gluten free flour mix, but that just meant it needed longer in the oven.

I see my guy's going for seconds.

I made these for my husband since they are his favorite and they turned out AMAZING! I did what some other people suggested and added juice of 5 squeezed lemons and added an extra 1/4 c flour and 1/4 c sugar to offset the liquid. I did also have to cook the crust for about 7 minutes longer than suggested to get it to firm up a bit more. I'll be saving this recipe for sure :)

Made these for my dad for father's day because lemon bars are his favorite! I found that using the two lemons, but also adding in lemon zest, makes the bars nice and lemony. I also let the crust sit and get to around room temp before pouring the custard on it in order to avoid the eggs cooking. My dad liked them, so I'd say it was a success!

This is the best recipe for lemon bars!!! I add extra lemon juice and lemon zest for extra lemon flavor.

I would say to leave this in the oven for 5 more minutes then stated because when i made this the only issue what that it was too soft and runny. But other wise this is so good and I would recommend trying it out!!!

The 4 stars it's for the recipe as it's written.  Was very good, if you like a mellow tartness.  Having said that, if you are hoping for that "POW WOW" in your mouth, you have to modify! After reading some of the suggestions,  I decided to try it again using some of them.  I added to the crust mix about 1/8 to 1/4 tsp of salt.   Lemon juice, I used exactly 2/3 of a cup; added another 3 Tbsp of flour to the sugar and flour mix.  Blended, instead of whisking,  the lemon juice, 1 Tbs of lemon zest, and eggs first, then I added the flour and sugar and blended for just a few seconds ( I used the Vitamix) then poured onto the baked crust. It was a beautiful and delighful thing!!! much more tart, and even lemon dessert haters couldn't resist devouring them!!

Recipe as written is basically a three. There is not enough lemony flavor! I add at least 2/3 cup juice (three lemons , juiced) and sometimes will add a little bottled lemon juice if I don't get enough from my lemons. Additional adjust the flour up by 1 tablespoon to get the right consistency. The crust is perfect as written! With the extra lemon these bars are a five!!

Delicious! It was a perfect sweet to tart ratio. I did use the recommended 2/3 cup lemon juice, and maybe even a little extra because I like it more tart than sweet.

Incredible, just use one more lemon and cut them into 1-inch squares- they're a bit heavy otherwise.  GREAT recipe!.

Made the recipe EXACTLY as written and turned out great!  Nice thick crust.  Used two large lemons and got a little over 1/2 c. of lemon juice.  Did not cool crust before pouring filling over it and baking it.  Baking times were spot on.

These were super easy to make! I feel like they could have been more lemony, so I'll probably add another juiced lemon next time.

This was bright and lemony, just what I was looking for. I also added the zest of both lemons into the mix. But I made a mistake that I won't make again... after cutting them, I layered them in a nice dish and put in the fridge. They all stuck to the bottoms of each other - It was a mess. A delicious, sticky mess.

I suggest making sure the pan is deep enough for adding the liquid. Also, I used pastry flour, ideal for short dough, instead of standard. I used my background in baking, I added about a tsp.  of baking powder, an egg, vanilla and milk. I added milk to bring the dough to the consistency for easy handling.

Super good. Overlooked the shortbread a bit so it was a little crunchy. Also followed some reviewers and change lemon juice to 2/3 cup (which was 4 of my lemons) and added zest of 2 lemons as well. Yummy Easter treat.

My husband loved these and is begging me to make them again. Next time I will double or triple the lemon because they were not tart enough for me. The crust was  flaky, buttery, and just sweet enough. This is a winner!

This is a wonderful simple recipe for lemon bars ! For those who say they are not lemony enough, just do what I did: add the zest of one (or both!) of the lemons.

Use a food processor to blend crust, much faster and easier. The custard was quite sweet and not at all tart. More lemons needed. I added rosemary also.

Perfect ratio of biscuit/crust to custard. We found that you /do not/ need to add more lemon (as some have said) if using large, fresh lemons.

Only minor thing is--and this could be my oven--if you're expecting the crust to brown in 15-20 minutes, plan on it being 20-25 minutes. 

Great recipe!

I made the recipe as written without changes and everything turned out well.  The lemons I used were from my tree and are quite large; I only used two and got 2/3 cup juice from them.  I am making it again and beat the eggs a little longer on accident while I juiced the lemons and it seems that I have a more filling than the last time (due to more air getting incorporated).  So I guess it really is up to how you make it and the size of your lemons.  All around good.

We love it, just as it is written!  This is our go-to recipe for Nana who LOVES lemon anything.  It is easy to make and oh-so-easy to eat.  After baking, I do refrigerate the bars, but I have also left them out in a cake holder, and they have held up just fine.  I'm going to try to freeze a few and see how they do.  I will update my review when completed!

This is the first time I've tried to make lemon bars. Long time lover of them though. Based upon some of the reviews that the filling wasn't enough for the amount of crust this recipe makes, I tried another variation that worked out very well. I made the recipe as it is called out, with only one ingredient variation....I added more sugar to the crust. I then used a square 8x8 inch pan instead of the 9x13 one called for in the recipe. Because this made everything more dense, I increased the baking time for the crust by 5 mins and the filling baking time by 10 mins. By using a smaller pan, the amount of crust to the amount of filling was perfect! This gave me a slightly thicker crust and more dense filling to crust ratio. Perfection!!!

I made these lemon bars with my daughter.  I used three lemons based on the comments left by some other reviews saying that 2 lemons weren't enough.  I should have stuck with the original recipe.  The lemon bars were good but too sour for us.  I gave the recipe 5 stars because, had I followed the recipe as it was, it would have turned out amazing.

Only giving 4 stars because recipe said ungreased pan.  Parts of my bars stuck. I would recommend a non-stick spray or lined w/parchment paper. Other than that, these are amazing & delicious.

Would rate 5 stars with the modifications based on other reviews.  I added about 1/2 tsp salt to the crust, used a smaller pan. Also added to the filling the zest of two lemons, and used fresh lemon juice equal to 1/2 cup.  I added an additional 5-10 minutes to each bake time due to the smaller pan.  While warm, dusted the top with powdered sugar (as shown in the photo). My knitting group LOVED the lemon bars, and there are some great cooks in that group!

I absolutely loved how the sugar in the bar kind of crystalized on the top to make a beautiful presentation... the only problem I had was the lemon part wasn't lemony enough... I didn't have any lemons on hand but I had the juice, so I added four tablespoons (1 lemon = 2 tablespoons juice) so basically I added 1/4 cup of juice and.... while it did taste good, it wasn't enough lemon. I suggest adding more like 1/2 cup or 2/3 cup of lemon juice to really get that citrus kick!

I really liked it but I followed another reviewers suggestions.  I added 2/3 cup lemon juice (total), an extra tablespoon of flour, and put the zest of 2 lemons in as well. I really like the flavors, but I think the ratio is a bit off.  Next time I will try to double the lemon mixture and leave the crust as is.  Thinking about trying some orange zest in the crust. - 2ND ATTEMPT - next time try 1.5 times the filling instructions above, but the zest of only 2 lemons.  Keep the juice the same.

Was doubtful because I've had many lemon bars let me down but this recipe is perfect and they were delightful. I did about 2.5 lemons that was almost 1/2 cup of juice and they were nice and moist and super tart like I like them. Also put powdered sugar on top and bottom. Almost ate the whole pan!

I consider this my "go-to" recipe for Lemon Bars!  I made them twice; the first time was as stated.  I found that there was not enough filling, and the filling was not tart enough for my family's liking. 

For my second batch I tweaked the ingredients for results that are more of our liking.  For my crust I used the ingredients as stated, also adding 3/4 teaspoon of salt.  For the filling I increased the quantity by "roughly" 50%.  I used 6 extra-large eggs,  2 1/4 cups of sugar, 1/2 cup of flour (doubled to compensate for the increased amount of lemon juice I used), 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and 1 1/4 cups of fresh lemon juice (we like them more "tart").  I recommend "fresh squeezed" lemon juice (include the pulp!) because the bottled stuff you buy just wouldn't be nearly as good!   If you don't like your lemon bars "tart", cut the lemon juice back to your liking.  If you do cut back on the lemon juice, be sure to decrease the amount of flour accordingly.  

Using a well-greased (I use Crisco) 9" x 13" baking pan (and I highly recommend you grease your pan, as these bars would certainly stick to the pan if you don't), I baked my crust for 17 minutes before adding the filling.   After removing the crust  from the oven I let it cool for 5 minutes.   I then added the filling and baked the bars for 26 minutes. 

I cooled mine to room temperature (about 2 hours), and then put them in the refrigerator for 4 hours to "firm up" before cutting.  They cut much better when they're cold.

I think this recipe was Okay... I took longer to bake than said. I baked it for about 20 minutes. I took it out the oven and, left it to cool for half hour. It was still watery. I didn't really like it. I baked it again. It tasted pretty good. Maybe I'll try it again in case I did it again.

This was my first time making lemon bars. A friend made this same recipe and used two lemons but it was barely lemony so I used three lemons and it may have been a little overboard. It was just under a cup of juice.  I guess just tweak it to your lemon level!

I did follow a others suggestion to use 2/3 cup juice but even this was too sweet so next time I added 1 cup juice an additional 2 Tablespoons of flour and decreased sugar in curd mixture to 1 1/4 cups. Much better

OK, so I made this yesterday... and I'm making them again today as they have all gone..!! The family descended on them like vultures!
I took note of other comments and added a little salt (1/4 tsp) to the base, and I used the juice of 4 medium lemons (about 3/4 cup) as I love lots of lemon.  I think this time I may add some zest to the base too.
This is super simple and really yummy - thanks for sharing!

Best lemon bars ever. My hot friend asks me to make these every year for her birthday. They are so good!  I usually make 1 1/2 times the lemon custard for the topping.  Best ever!

This recipe is great as is, I'd give it 4 stars. The notes and reviews of recipes are what give it a life of its own as you can increase the lemon flavor with more juice and lemon zest. My contribution is to puree berries into the juiced lemons for a berry lemon bar. Candied ginger is a favorite addition

Absolutely delicious! Bright, velvety lemon custard in a light, buttery shortbread crust - perfection. I made this in a 9" tart pan. Used about 3/4 of the custard and about 3/4 of crust. Saved the extra and made small tarts :) I followed other readers' recommendations and added a 1/4 tsp salt to crust, and in the custard used 2/3 cup lemon juice and 2 tbsp lemon zest with and extra 1/4 cup of flour. I baked both the crust and the filled pie for 20 min each. It popped right out of the tart pan and slightly d perfectly off the pan base into serving dish. I simply dusted too liberally with powdered sugar and garnished with lemon zest - so elegant and so easy!!

After reading others reviews, I added 1/2 teaspoon salt to the shortbread crust and upped the lemon juice to just over 1/2 cup. The crust didn't seem done after the recommended time so I let it bake for another 5 minutes. This turned out wonderfully.

Best Lemon Bars ever!  I added a little more sugar in the crust and lemon zest too.  Adding lemon zest to the topping gave it an extra kick!  I made it in a 8x11 pan because I like a thicker crust.  I would make this again.  Quick and Easy and nice desert to bring to a party.

My husband didn't care for the 'sharp' lemon flavor ( I used two medium sized lemons & less sugar) 
I loved it and the crust portion tasted almost like a carmel-flavored shortbread. YUM

I made it!! Just one substitue, I used coconut oil instead of butter. Everything else was the same. Great taste, texture and really easy to make. Fun project to do with children, grandchildren, or young teens.

Didn't read reviews before making and I wish I would have.  This would be better with a higher filling to crist ratio. I also didn't think there was enough lemon flavor, but blamed it on the fact that this was the first time I had used lemons from my own tree. After reading reviews, I think my lemons were fine; the recipe just needs to call for more lemon juice. But I think if you go with 3 lemons as your base recipe then 1.5 times the filling, it might be just right.

These are delicious but you really need to use more lemons.  There should be an amount listed of how much measurement of lemon juice to use, not just "two lemons".   I ended up using 4 juicy lemons and the lemon flavor was spot on :)  Loved the crust!

made this recipe tonight for our dessert since my daughter is returning to college tomorrow and she loves lemon bars. in the past, she and I have both struggled to successfully make them. I tried this recipe AND IT'S DIVINE. I followed it to a T and it was as I had anticipated...like fresh lemonade in a cookie bar...just enough tart and sweet to be perfect. this recipe deserves every last star available.

The crust recipe is practically fool proof. I have made it twice now and perfect each time. I did allow for the crust to completely cool before adding the filling. I added zest of one lemon and measured out  a 1/2 cup of fresh lemon juice and followed the recipe's remaining ingredient measurements and baked for about 30 minutes.  I thought I might have overbaked by a few minutes as the sides seemed to be browner than what was expected, but oh my gosh, the sides were the best part! The second time I let the filling bake for about 27 minutes and it was perfect. It gave me the freash bright lemony tang I was craving and when chilled the filling set very nicely. I am addicted to these and this recipe is really simple. I think adding the zest should be recommended as it really kicks up the P-Pow! on the flavor.

I made three 8x8 pans so my recipe was practically doubled if not tripled.  I used two fresh lemons and got about a half of cup of fresh juice.  Used another half cup of bottled because i was making three pans i wanted to make sure it was lemony enough.  I also zested my lemons to give nice color and flavor throughout.  Over all i love this recipe it was easy to use and follow.  Love them!!!!

"All Recipes"? More like "All BESTipes"! I absolutely love these lemon bars! The recipe was very quick and easy to follow. The only thing that I would recommend doing is to add more lemon juice. I put about 1/2 cup of lemon juice, and it turned out great!

I only make this recipe when I choose lemon bars. I convert it to gluten free by simply changing the flour to a gluten free one using Pamela's  or outrageous flour blend. I always add more lemon juice and even a drop or two of  doterra essntial lemon oil. It does need more lemons so don't avoid that step.

I love these Lemon Bars, they're so good!  I double the filling recipe and increase the lemon juice to 1 1/3 cups and the flour to 1 cup.  I make them in a 9x11 pan.  The key is to bake them until they're still a little gooey, that's when they taste best.  Also, if you can use fresh lemons, those have the best flavor.  If you use store bought ones, I usually add about 1/4 cup extra sugar to the filling mixture, since they seem to be on the more tart side.

I've used this recipe dozens of times.  I add 1/2 tsp salt to the shortbread crust, and I use about 2/3 cup of lemon juice , which is generally 2 1/2 large lemons.  I've only had an issue with this recipe once, when I made it in a disposable/recyclable aluminum pan- for some reason it didn't set properly.  Otherwise, it is much loved and it is my go-to recipe when lemons are on sale or I need something easy for a potluck dessert.  Every crumb disappears, so if you want some for yourself, make a second pan!

I made these to give out to our neighbours for Christmas this year and everyone loved them! It's the perfect amount of lemon so it's still sweet with a touch of tang. I made the recipe exactly as listed. Thanks for posting this!

This is a great recipe. My kids can't have dairy so we used coconut oil instead of butter (equal conversion) and they turned out great. I saw a review that said it wasn't enough lemon flavor...well  I used slightly rotten lemons (this is what I do with over-ripe food here. Waste not and all that jazz...) and it was SUPER lemony in flavor, the man loved it, the kids loved it. I had a hard time keeping to my one bar a day rule before they were all eaten. Thank God I live in a house full of boys that love to snack, or this would have added a few extra around the middle. :)

Used 8x11" pan.  Too much crust for smaller size pan so balance was put into small springform pan to make the base for a butter tart.  Followed suggestion of others and used almost 2/3 cup lemon juice and zest of 2 lemons with an extra tablespoon of flour.  Top was really brown after baking but I found that after plastic wrap was laid on top and pan went into fridge to cool, the brown "crust" came off with the plastic wrap.   Delicious tart lemon flavour.  Will make again.

I followed the recipe exactly. It was deeeelicious! Funny story - My office picnic was the next day and we were having a "bake off." I had no intention of participating but I saw that they only had two participants so I felt sorry for them and figured I'd make something just for "show" with no huge effort to win. Imagine my surprise when yep--I won! 

I get requests for these all the time. Do exactly as the recipe says. It works! My only issue (and just the nature of the food) is to wait until the last minute to powder sugar them. I did it the night before and by morning, the sprinkles were all absorbed in.

Worst lemon bars ever.   These were so bad, that I threw the entire batch in the trash.  The crust tasted like cardboard.

If you like lemon bars here's a recipe for you!  Very good.  I love really lemony desserts so I did modify the recipe by adding zest of 2 lemons and juice from 3 lemons... it was super lemony if you like lemon bars that way.  Next time I will try with just 2 lemons (3 lemons is very puckery!).

This was a delicious recipe I recommend it for all ages. The only thing I did was for the lemon filling I let it cook for 17 minutes and added a little more sugar to make it sweeter. All in all, it was a fabulous dish.

I love lemon bars, but they have to be tangy, with a firm crust.  I have definitely had overly-sweet and soggy lemon bars (*bleh*).  These are so good!  Make sure to bake the crust until it's golden brown all over (don't underbake it!).  I use at least 1/2 c lemon juice (bottled is just fine).  I've had many compliments, and requests for the recipe.  Only recipe I'll use!

Well, the name really fits this recipe! I followed it exactly and initially I thought they were going to be terrible. When I poured the lemon mixture on top of the crust it seemed like the crust hadn't cooked correctly and it was all mixing together. I stuffed back in the oven to finish cooking and just assumed I would end up trashing them, but surprise, they were delicious and my mother-in-laws favorite and she is a very picky eater. Hooray for me!

These are the best lemon bars I've ever had. I have been making them for about 10 years now. Don't change a thing in this recipe. If you like tangy lemon, these are for you. They are very, extremely good.

I had some extra lemons left over from making limoncello and came upon this highly reviewed and rated recipe.  I found it not to have a lot of lemon flavor to it and would probably add lemon zest.

The crust tasted very buttery, so I would probably see about modifying that component too and add some salt.

I get that this is a dessert, but it packs a ton of calories for a small piece (serving size: 36 in a 9x13 is small!).

Super recipe. The 4 stars are due to the proportion of the crust to filling to pan size. I intend to figure it out. Thank you for sharing.

I always half the recipe as it's just two of us. I still put 3/4 cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice(up the flour), we love the tartness. This time i felt extra spicy ?? and added freshly blended 1/4 of fresh raspberries which gave it an absolute gorgeous color, lovely texture and an amazing lemony/berry taste.

Thank you for sharing! This is my favorite recipe for lemon bars, it is so simple, and they always come out great. I usually don't recommend making any changes, but personally I need about 2/3 cup of lemon juice for mine to turn out right.  I add a little bit of lemon zest as another person suggested, and I have to bake mine in a 9x13 in baking dish (not a baking sheet).

Perfectly lovely as is, but 2 small changes take it from nice to "wow"!.  Zest one of the lemons. Put about 1/2 of the zest in the crust mix, the other half in the lemon juice mix. Add even more zest if you want extra punch.  Second change: about 1/4 - 1/2 tsp salt in the crust.

Must add lemon zest as well for lemony/tart flavor. Zest is the best part of a lemon.   if  two lemons arent enough, add bottled juice for more flavor.  9 by 13 pan is too large for the amount of dough measurements here.  used 9/9 pan and cooked longer.  much better.  also powdered sugar is not listed as a topping for the end result.  must top with powdered sugar.  basic recipe.  nothing great. most recipes have the same ingredients used. certainly wouldnt title  it the best lemon bars.

Excellent! Nice and tart - I made these with very large lemons from my tree, so plenty of lemon juice (although I didn't measure it). These also freeze well. I like to eat them straight out of the freezer, but chilled or room temp, they're delicious. Will definitely make these again - they're so easy.

With the mentioned tweets (more lemon + rind  + more flour), I can honestly give this recipe 5 stars!  They turned out fantastic!

I used MommyFromSeattle's suggestions and next time I will double the lemon topping- they were good but way too much crust compared to lemon.

So amazing! I've been using this recipe for years (I think) and everyone always love them. I suggest that if you want more lemon flavor you add lemon zest. If you do, remember to wash your lemons. The crust is great and doesn't flake but is more like a cookie crust which I personally love.

I've made this for my family twice now, and there are never leftovers. I do halve the recipe so it will fit perfectly in a glass 9" pie dish, so it makes the perfect amount. I do as one other reviewer suggested and add a little salt (1/8 tsp for halving the recipe) to the crust mix which helps balance out the perfect tartness of this dish!

I found this recipe to be delicious.  I did use 2/3 cup of lemon juice and it worked very well.  I've struggled in the past to make a lemon bar that has a nice lemon flavor, but these were great.  Very refreshing dessert!

I added one extra lemon, and took out 1/4 sugar and it was fantastic. Also i would recommend zesting the lemons and then juicing them instead of just juicing them or you wont get much lemon flavor.

Super yummy, but the crust wasn't attached fully so I'd recommend to not only soften the butter but put it in the microwave for 20 seconds at least. I'd also cook it for an extra 10 minutes.

Delicious. I added more lemon like the other reviewers mentioned. 3 lemons to be precise. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. Made for a party and have people emailing me asking for the recipe! Winner!

Made for a family event this weekend.  My sis is a lemon bar expert and gave these a big thumbs up.  Added the zest as recommended but didn't add the salt to the crust.  It's a keeper!

I saw the suggestion not to make any substitutions with this recipe, but since I have dairy and gluten allergies, I always try my luck. This recipe turned out FANTASTICALLY with my subs. I used an AP Gluten Free flour mix (Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free 1 to 1 Baking Flour) and Earth Balance soy free spread and loved the results. I also took note of other reviews and added a few TBSP  more sugar to the mixture for the crust, and for the filling I added  zest from the lemon rinds to give a little more tang. I am absolutely saving this recipe for the future!

Not sure what I did wrong. But the crust is not near sweet enough and the filling is not tart enough. There just wasn't enough flavor all around and I made the suggested changes of adding lemon zest and 3 fresh lemons.

I loved this bar! I did follow some of the recommendations ie: I used  2/3 cup of fresh squeezed lemon juice and added 1 tbspn of flour and added 1/4 tsp of salt to the crust. I had to bake the crust 30ish minutes to get that golden brown colour I like and next time I make it, I will reduce the sugar in the crust by half. I found the crust a bit sweet for my liking. The filling was absolutely perfect though ... great lemony flavour with just the right marriage of sweet and tart. I simply dusted the top with icing sugar and this bar was a huge hit. I will definitely make it again.

we used both lemon & lime juice with some peel.  plenty tart. crust is kinda thick, but fam didn't complain. 
make sure to cook the crust until brown, otherwise the short bread will be too mushy all around.

I've been making this recipe for years and always get rave reviews.  I use about a half cup fresh (more or less) of lemon juice.  Add more if you like them more tart.  I also line the pan with parchment paper letting some hang over short edge for easy removal.  These are perfect!

I loved this recipe! So easy and everyone just loved it!
I used a smaller 8 x 11 inch pan so the cookie part would be thicker, added a little salt and cooked it an extra 10 mins.
I used 3 lemons and the zest of  lemons and just loved the way these turned out!! Delish!!

Delicious!! My family finished these yesterday and I'm making more today because I couldn't stop eating them :P I cooked the crust for about 17/18 minutes and it was perfect. For the person concerned about vague "2 lemons" was, I estimated that I squeezed about 1/2 cup of lemon juice. Great recipe!!

Love this recipe!! I've made it many times, with a few minor changes:

1. I need to bake the crust for at least 30 minutes in order for it to become golden 

2. I make sure the crust has cooled completely BEFORE pouring in the lemon filling--the first time I made the mistake of pouring on the lemon filling right after the crust came out of the oven, and it was too soft and broke apart under the stream of lemon filling

3.  I add 1 tsp of lemon zest to the crust--gives it a delicious smell and taste!

4. Small pinch of salt in the crust and lemon filling enhances the flavors and decreases the sourness of the lemon a bit

Made this for an elder relative this week and they came out great! The only thing I did differently is doubled the lemon filling and cooked 10-15 minutes longer. The crust was a perfect amount for a 9x13 inch pan, and cooked that about 5-8 minutes longer too. Overall it came out great. I dusted it with powdered sugar, and they were a hit!(:

I followed the recipe, except I add the juice of 5 lemons. I have made them many times.  Roll ur lemons before u cut and juice them. It really helps get the most juice from them. My family loves them!

I used 1/2c lemon juice, and the flavor was there. The base for the bar was crisp, not tender like I was expecting. Would probably try a different recipe next time.

This recipe is brilliant.  I used 2/3 of a cup concentrated lemon juice, as I didn't have fresh lemons and then added 1tbsp  natural lemon bakery emulsion.  I found that it almost wasn't enough to cover the layer of crust, so the next time I make (and I will...frequently), I'll increase the lemon juice and see how it goes. Perfectly tart and sweet and lemony deliciousness.

These lemon bars were AMAZING. I made little to no changes to this recipe. Many people were saying the crust was too tasteless, so I used salted butter instead, and the crust was perfect. it was sweet, crispy and had just the right amount of flavor. I also used four small lemons instead of two. The lemon was a little overpowering, but that was a fault on my part. I think 1/2 a cup of  lemon juice would be adequate. Other then these small tweaks, these bars were flavorful, chewy and delicious. I HIGHLY recommend this (almost) foolproof recipe for quick easy lemon bars. Like the name says, these were the best lemon bars I've ever had!

Anything made homemade is the best. For me I added 3 lemons squeezed and 1 tbsp. Flour and came out excellent. Very good lemon bar. I don't usually tweet recipes but knew more lemon juice was needed for more flavor. Will be my recipe always.

Made this for the 4th of July and they were a hit! I used two different pans and I took another reviewer's suggestion and used 3 lemons instead and zested 2 of them. I added extra flour to the lemon portion and added extra sugar to the shortbread. They came out very moist and unfortunately, kept soaking up the confectioner's sugar which made them look less appealing. Other than that, they tasted great!!

Delicious! My shortbread crusts never turn out, except for this recipe.  I think that your hint about not making substitutions is probably the key.    I suspect that I've been using margarine instead of butter...

Delicious! I would post a pic, but we ate them too fast! I upped the lemon to juice from 4 large lemons, about a half lemon of zest, and a squeeze of refrigerated lemon juice. I added a dash of sea salt to the topping as well. PERFECT for us! Slightly tart, but we like that. I say adjust the lemon to your liking. I doubt it would be very tart with the recipe as-is. I sprinkled powdered sugar on top, but I don't think it's necessary. Will be making this again at our next family BBQ!

I made this for my classmates today and most people said the same thing. it needed more lemon topping. I used a 2/3 cup of lemon juice and no lemon zest this time and next time I plan on adding a second layer of the topping using the same recipe I used for the lemon layer this time. Either way the product of this recipe was enjoyed but I feel these would be positive improvements

These were a breeze, and so good!  I followed the suggestions of others and increased the lemon juice, flour, and cooking time.  I used a 10x10  dish, and that gave me about an equal 1/4in each of crust and filling.

Amazing recipe, turned out perfectly! After reading a few negative reviews I would say that the crust is shortbread, buttery and not too much sugar.  There is enough sugar in the filling that the crust does not need to be overly sweet.  I used two very big lemons and it was quite tart and lemony - which was perfect.  
I made a double batch and for one of the pans I sprinkled coconut on the shortbread crust then poured the lemon filling overtop, it was a simple but very nice addition!

Yikes. I'm not thrilled but it's made a few mistakes. Too large of a pan, went easy on the lemon juice, a few other things. I either need to try again or use a different recipe. Interested to try the lime bars tho

After reading the reviews I added 2/3 cup of lemon juice as I love lemons and the extra table spoon of flour. I was rushing to make these so I saw eggs and quickly added them. It should have been egg whites. After removing from my oven these had a thin layer of egg on top. Still good though. Top layer peeled  right off. This recipe should have specified.

Just made these for the first time. After reading reviews, I used 1/2 cup lemon juice (3 lemons) plus zest of 1 lemon & increased flour in filling by 1T. I lined my baking pan with parchment paper & used parchment paper to press & flatten the crust into pan as it was just sticking to my hands. Came out great! Sprinkled some powdered sugar to top after cooling. Store in fridge in air tight container.

5/22/2016 - followed the recipe but used the juice of 4 lemons (just over one cup).  Very tasty and flavorful!  Only one person commented that it was too much lemon flavor.  Next time I would cut in to smaller pieces and dust with powdered sugar (as in the one picture).

I added lemon zest to the recipe and it made the lemon tartness just right. I will definitely make this again.

I made these lemon bars to take to a potluck, and they were a huge hit. I didn't come home with any leftovers. These are a keeper!

A nice lemon bar/square for the vast majority. A buttery tender base with a balanced filling. For we lemon lovers, add the zest of the lemons into the filling. 
Thank you for a reliable recipe.

I made this and followed the suggestions of the many others: used 2/3 cup lemon juice ( I used fresh lemons), added 1/4 tsp salt to the crust and 1 TBS flour to the filling.  This is the best tasting lemon bar recipe I have tried.  It is a true lemon flavor and taste like it came from a high end bakery.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!

I really love this recipe (with tweaks from MommyFromSeattle). I also use brown sugar in the crust to give a little added texture. Just a note - I think these bars get more lemony  as the days go on. If I taste them on the day I made them, I'm usually disappointed with the lemon flavor but after a day or two they are perfect! Another tip - if you're going to dust the tops with confectioner's sugar, do it while the bars are still hot from the oven (might be common sense to some but I had no idea!)

I made this with Meyer lemons and two of the modifications mentioned on the review.  I increased the lemon juice to 2/3 cup and added 1 extra TBS flour to the lemon mixture to compensate.  I decreased the sugar in the lemon mixture a bit too, since Meyer lemons are sweeter than regular ones.  Very happy with the crust, texture, and taste.

Loved it - super easy to make and wonderfully lemon bar-y :) I added the zest of one lemon into the crust to amp up the lemon flavor in the whole bar, and  they turned out beautifully.  Just like my favorites from a bakery back in Illinois.

I haven't had lemon bars since I was younger. These bars came out just like my mom's. However I did change a few things. I used a 7x11 pan, making the crust and filling a little thicker. Also, per the recommendation of a few other commenters I just more lemon juice (2 1/2 large lemons) and I used the zest of one lemon. I also added about a tablespoon extra of flour to offset the extra juice from the lemons.  I let the crust sit for a little while before I added the filling, probably about 15-20 min. It was by no means room temp, it was still warm to the touch but not hot. The filling is lovely. I'm really happy with the consistency. 10/10 would make again.

These lemon squares came out perfectly! As I type, I'm baking a batch.  I used 1/2 cup lemon juice instead of fresh squeezed, because I didn't have fresh lemons. According to Google, there is about 1/4 cup of lemon juice in one lemon, maybe a little more. So I used half of a cup the first time, they needed to bake about five minutes longer, but they came out perfect. (I also have an old electric oven, so baking times tend to take just a little longer.)

Okay.....YUM! I under cooked mine (16 minutes) so the topping was a little too gooey and over whelming but other than that, they were perfect. I love that all these ingredients are so basic that I didn't have to go to the store for anything!

Absolutely delicious!! I had to cook the crust the full 20 minutes, and I had to add another 5 minutes the second baking time. I used 6 tablespoons of lemon juice instead of the 2 lemons, and it has turned out absolutely delicious each time.

Delicious recipe.  Moist crust and delicious.  Nice tangy filling on top.  I used bottled lemon juice concentrate and increased it it to 1 cup.  It's probably better with real lemon juice and will try next this next time I make them.  I didn't alter the other items in the recipe.

This is a good recipe. I do agree with some other reviewers that "2 juiced lemons" is not really specific enough regarding the amount of juice you need. I followed the suggestions of some other reviewers and used 2/3 cup of lemon juice. The crust is good, and it is more than sufficient in a 9 x 13 dish. A dish any smaller and you would have a crust that is unpleasantly thick, in my opinion. These are great once they've been refrigerated for several hours.

Awesome recipe!  I increased the lemon juice to 2/3 cup.  I also added the zest of the two lemons.   Friday night's are pizza night and these have now become standard as well.

I have been using this recipe for longer than a year now, and it has always been a hit. Occasionally, it seems a bit buttery, so I am going to begin cutting down on the butter by 4 tablespoons or so. Fresh lemon is the best flavor, but I use lemon juice that comes in the bottle some times when I have no lemons on hand and it turns out fine. Will keep this recipe for life!

I had never made lemon bars so this recipe seemed easy. I saw that other recipes work the dough for the bar more, and refrigerate it...sounded like a lengthy process. I followed this direction and had great results. I found the ration of lemon topping to base was perfect. I noticed others called for more eggs and lemons for a thicker lemon filling. I thought this one was just perfect...all I added was a bit of lemon zest and a powder sugar dusting.

Really good, just sweet enough while still remaining tart.  I used Realemon juice as that's all I had on hand, and it's still really good!

I used a full cup of lemon juice. Only 1/4 cup of sugar in crust and 3/4 of sugar in filling. So good!

Great recipe...I use Meyer lemons, so I use 2/3 cups, wit a couple drops of lemon essential oil.  I like the shortbread crust and the lemon filling with just that 1/4 cup,of flour which is enough.  Yummy.

These are requested at every gathering we have!
I double the lemon juice (always fresh squeezed), then use only one cup of sugar for the filling. They're tart, but absolutely amazing!

I would definitely use a smaller pan ie 8 x 8 or 9 x 9. The 9 x 13 doesn't allow a nice thick layer of lemon. Alternatively if u do use a 9 x 13 then make a double lemon recipe , the crust makes plenty.
Also I would lessen the final bake time to only 15 min.

I  didn't taste much lemon in it, so don't just do two lemons squeezed,  actually measure it as a cup and a half or even two cups. As for sweetness, it was right on track. I added about an eighth of a cup more sugar, but I prefer brown sugar to white sugar because it tastes more natural. My family didn't like it much, and I honestly don't blame them. I don't think it's necessarily the recipe's fault, it should just specify the measurement for the lemon juice. Perhaps my baking skills are dwindling. I don't think my family would appreciate it if I made this recipe again, so sadly I will not be repeating this disaster of a recipe, although it was fun to make. No, thanks.

I made the recipe twice, thinking that I must have done something wrong given all the positive reviews.  The crust was fine.  I used the juice of 3 lemons which made it tart enough.  However,  on both occasions, the edges of the pan browned and the top (filling ) had a weird consistency in parts, as if the  lemon juice had separated from the mixture. No mention of powdered sugar.  Will not be making again

Made as is. Turned out turned out great. Not sure why, but on the second day, the top of the lemon bars are a little wet. They taste fine just doesn't look as nice.

The perfect lemon square. If you use 2 large, FRESH, lemons, you should have enough juice. The crust is beautiful and buttery, the filling is just a tiny bit tart - perfect :)

I did not make any changes. I wanted to know what it was like using the original. If I make it again I then will add changes.

I did use three lemons because one was smaller so I decided to use another small one. I love them. I put powdered sugar on them too. I don't know if my husband will like them. I think next time I will make a bit more of the "crust" after it baked the first time it pulled away from the pan(maybe I did not press it up enough the edges well enough either). So when I poured the lemon part into it ...it went down the sides where it pulled away making a odd crusty sugary coat over the edges.   

I think I would like the crust part a bit thicker. I will also add a bit more sugar. I do love the lemon flavor..I had been wanting it...but I am pretty sure my husband won't like these because he likes sweet things more..lol(I may need to make him cookies!!).
This was also my first time making them...they were far easier then a lot of things I have made. 

If you have any complaints about this recipe..make sure you did not do anything wrong. Also...if you like less lemon..use less. If you want a sweeter taste..add more sugar... I will definitely make these again..with a few adjustments(for what I like a bit more...).

I halved the recipe for a 8x8 pan, including cook time. I ended up needing to cook them longe and the filling came out very firm.

The crust was a little too solid for the filing to absorb.

I made this recipe to the T the first time and it was amazing. I've never had a lemon bar to compare to though. I made them for a friend and she said they were perfect! I am making them again right now and I've decided to add more lemon juice and zest for an even more lemon flavor.

I made quite a few changes based n reviews: I only had an 8x11 pan and I'm glad I did as the filling was barely thick enough to even cover that size.  I would definitely double the filling next time and add less crust to make it proportional.  I used 3 cups flour, I used 2/3 cup fresh lemon juice (about 6 lemons for me) and it was the perfect tartness, as written it wouldn't have been tart enough, I used salted butter, I also added the zest of 2 lemons.  This way its a 5 star recipe and I will continue to use it with the changes otherwise it won't be very good.  2 lemons is just not enough juice

Okay I normally don't review recipes- but this one I had to! Not only was it so easy, but it was delicious! I ended up eating half the pan. I am definitely going to be making these again.

I just made these for a coworker's birthday. First time making them and also first time really ever eating them. What a HIT!!! Perfect amount of tartness and sweetness! Everyone raved about them and said they were the best they've had in a long time. I did use a little over a 1/2 cup of lemon juice, and added a tablespoon more of flour to the filling to counteract the extra liquid. SO GOOD. And of course added lemon zest to the shortbread and filling. DELISH. Will make these again for sure!!!

These bars are perfection!  I've made them may times and my friends who love all things lemon request them. The recipe as is even does well at the 4300' elevation (I live at) that presents baking challenges.  Thank you for posting this recipe, Patty!

Use a pastry blender to mix the crust.  Also use juice of three lemons and the zest from 2 lemons for a more lemony taste.  Goes together nice and fast and tastes great!

Not gonna lie, I did not care for these. Like honesty the best part of it was probably the cool whip that I added myself. Let's break it down:
Base layer- pretty much the left over dried playdoh your kids forgot to put away
Middle(lemon layer)- two lemons isn't specific. It was kinda just a gooeyer, slightly more tasty bottom layer.
Cool whip- some extra, much needed goodness
Sincerely, too lazy to through my piece away so I force myself to try and make it good

This was so good!!! Everything was prefect, although someone said there was a bit too much sugar (everyone else said the sugar was fine), so if you like less sweet and more sour, add 1 more lemon and a little less sugar.

I used more lemon and  zest from 2 small lemons.  I should have added more BUT you have to be careful bc some lemons are more tart than others...I used Meyer lemons too. Not sure if that's what made a difference

make sure you press the crust down firmly, and wait till completely cooled before dusting with powdered sugar. I cut into tiny bite sized rectangles and placed int mini cupcake wrappers, which i think is perfect for the sweet and tart treat.

I have made this recipe about 5 times so far, and love it! it is delicious and so easy to make. This time around, since I knew what I was doing it only took me 15 minutes to get to the point where the crust is cooking and the filling is waiting to be poured in! This recipe is very simple yet has all the delicious components a lemon square should have. Nothing but good things about this recipe!!!!

Made these exactly as the recipe called for (added a few pitches of salt to both the crust and the filling, and the zest of one lemon to the filling). Perfect!

I made these lemon bars for my families superbowl party.  It was a huge hit!  The only think I changed is the amount of lemon juice.  I tripled the measurment and it was perfect!  Will make again!

Holy wow. The shortbread on this is fantastic! Buttery, flaky, everything a shortbread should be. The whole recipe was the easiest I've made so far, and will make it again! The filling is good too, actually really good. I used almost 3/4 C lemon juice (2 lemons ), and it gave great flavor! I sprinkled powdered sugar on top, and it cut the acid nicely.

I am giving this 4 stars because it's yummy but I did modify the recipe a little. I used 2/3 cup lemon juice, added zest of 2 lemons and 1/4 teaspoon salt to the crust. It turned out a little too tart for my liking. Next time I will use 1/2 cup lemon juice and zest of one lemon. Play around with the amount of lemon juice.

While they had a delicious taste-the filling was too thin. The crust came out well, but if I make this again I would use a smaller pan so the filling is thicker.

These were pretty good. Like others had  done, I juiced an extra lemon and added some zest. Usually I like to cut down on sugar and butter so I used 3/4 cup butter (for the crust) and 1 cup sugar.  The shortbread crust was nice and buttery. At first I thought there was too much crust and not enough filling but when they came out the proportions were perfect. The filling was nice and tart. Overall, this was a pretty good recipe (especially with the modifications).

Alright this is great but i altered it in a few ways which made them even more delicious! So for the crust, instead of granulated sugar, i subbed powered. Then on top of 1/2 of lemon juice, I added another 1/4 cup of orange juice and then cut raspberries in half and added as many as I liked. Absolutely amazing

I made these for the first time and took them to a women's bible study.  Everyone raved about them.  They were so easy to make and just delicious! I made sure I had 1/2 C of lemon juice, which was 3 lemons, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Not too sweet, not too tart, just perfect. I will make these again!

This is a fantastic recipe! I was a bit confused on how much lemon juice to add so I put in a little bit over 2/3 of a cup and they turned out perfect! I've made these a few times and they're amazing each time. I definitely recommend

The crust was too thick compared to the lemon filling. Plus, the crust could have used more sugar. And the lemon filling didn't taste much like lemon. Overall, the texture was fine. Don't know what went wrong, but I wouldn't recommend this.

Definitely need the 1/2 to 3/4 Cup of lemon juice that "Mommyfromseattle" mentioned. For a little extra flavor add shredded coconut although these bars are great with out it as well.

Because the recipe only  calls for juice of two lemons, I wasn't sure just how much juice to use since lemon sizes vary so much. So I  followed Sallycat's suggestions exactly and got raves. Thanks Sallycat!

These was OK. Maybe I did something wrong, but the crust stuck to the pan, and it was crumbly. And when it was done baking there was an eggy layer on top...barely lemon flavor present....and I used lemon zest in addition to the juice of 3 lemons...wouldn't make again anytime soon.

Very tasty.  I read the comments before making it and I used 5 lemons.   It was a bit too much.   I'll try 3 lemons next time and I will also cut down the baking time & amount of sugar in the crust.

I added a little of the zest and 1tsp of lime juice for  little different  taste and texture! It was a smash, so thank you for the recipe!

I changed a few things in the recipe as I read the comments here. Unfortunately, I found the crust too dry and the filling too tart (using 2/3 cup juice and some zest.) Pretty good, but I'll have to doctor the recipe an awful lot to make these again.

I made this recipe because a friend gave me a bunch of lemons and, although I love lemon bars, I had never before made them.  I took them into work and people raved about them!  I used the juice of 3 lemons only because two didn't seem enough.  I cooked the crust for 22 minutes and used jumbo eggs, but those were the only changes I made.

The crust was perfection... however the amount of lemon recommended for the tart made it impossible to eat, would definitely cut down the lemon and sugar.

Easy, fast, good crust. So good, in fact, I'd double it so I could eat more. I had about 2/3 cup lemon juice. Should have doubled the sugar!!! The texture was excellent. I will make the recipe again, but I'm tweaking the sugar!

The crust was like cardboard, the filling had no taste. The filling requires more lemon juice. The smell is not appealing. I would not make this recipe again.

This was a trial and error recipe for me. My pan was too small and I over baked it. I agree that the crust was too buttery. If I made it again, I would change the amount of butter.

It turned out okay. The crust is too thick and it had bubble pockets here and there. The filling is not as tart as how I would like it. It turned out sweet with a hint of lemon. I won't be using this recipe again.

I have never made a lemon bar before, although I am an experienced baker. I'm not sure what went wrong. I followed this recipe to the T. The lemon filling and crust separated, the lemon mix didn't even taste like lemon, it tasted like egg and the lemon mix was like rubber. Nobody in my house could eat it. Maybe it was something I did.... :(

Really good! Instead of juicing lemons, I used lemon juice. I think I put a little too much lemon juice, so just remember with this recipe that a little goes a long time by way. (I put about 6 tablespoons, so I would recommend 5) But this recipe is still really good and easy, and I will definitely make it again.

These weren't as great as I had hoped... there was too much sugar and all I could taste was the butter. The top layer didn't stick to the crust so it was really unstable.

I should have never made this!!! I have no will power against their lemony-goodness! It did take my dough closer to 40 minutes to cook, (my altitude perhaps). Thank you for specifying to cook "until golden", because as a novice cook, I am sure I would've screwed it up otherwise.

I burnt them a little but they still turned out tasting pretty good. I made another smaller batch but instead of 2/3 cup lemon juice (as many recommended), I did 1/3 lime and 1/3 pineapple... turned out pretty yummy! Not a favorite dessert, but I will admit that lemon squares aren't really a first choice for me anyway. It seems like the idea is usually better than the reality. But this was just fine.

Amazing, I did not make any changes at all to this recipe. It came out perfect even in my small electric oven.I used lemons right off the tree and grated lemon zest of about half the lemon but you can add the zest to your taste. These really are the best lemon bars I have ever had, the shortbread is thick and the custard is perfectly creamy. I brought them to work and everyone raved about it! I can't believe with just a few simple ingredients you have a treat for all to love.

Very good. And like most of the other reviews, I measured the lemon juice by cup and I used 2/3 cup of juice and added 2/3 tbsp of flour. Very tart. Crust is buttery.

So easy! Really delicious. As others recommended, used 2/3rds cup of lemon juice and added 1 T of flour.

Excellent lemon bars! I made them exactly as the recipe was written. As a note I had two large lemons which gave just over half a cup of juice and I would say it was about right but a bit more would be good - I wouldn't use any less. Also I had to bake the shortbread for about 25 minutes rather then the 15-20 called for so use your judgement - it probably depends on the type of pan and the heat of your oven. Will definitely be making these again.

I will make this again.  I made it both using lemons and limes.  The only problem so that the crust is very bland.  I may try using brown sugar instead of white for the crust.

These are just what you want lemon bars to taste like.  Sometimes I don't use all the crust for a thinner bar.  I use closer to 2/3rds cup lemon juice as my lemon tree makes them huge.  The bars disappear quickly!

I like this recipe however I made my own modifications - i have used less sugar in the custard (1 1/4 instead of 1 1/2 cups), and used more lemon juice. I have also added 1 teaspoons of lemon oil to add more flavor. I have also used cold butter instead of soft butter for the crust - i cut cold butter in cubes, added flour and sugar to the food processor and mixed it. Then I put this mix into a baking dish and slightly pressed it, not too much. It turned out lovely, my family liked it. I will do it again.

I do not like this recipe as written.  I found the crust too thick for the amount of filing.  I also found that two lemons are no where near enough to get a lemon taste.  To make it better -- double the filing recipe and add an additional 2 to 3 more lemons (for a total of 4 to 5 lemons), plus the zest from three of those lemons gives a much better flavor and turns it into a five-star recipe.

This is the only lemon bar recipe I use.  A few changes though- I found the crust to be too buttery for my taste, so I use a half a cup/stick of butter. I also use lemon juice and just pour a bunch in- I really like my lemon bars to actually taste like lemon, and not have a hint of it. I always make it the night before an event or have them chill over night, always ends up being much tastier the next day.

This is a perfect recipe.  If you want to add some flavor to your crust change the sugar to dark brown sugar.  This will give it a more robust flavor.  You can also take half of the butter for the crust and brown it.  This gives it depth of flavor.  I also zested three lemons and used the juice from three lemons.  Add one teaspoon of flour to the lemon mix if you do this.  Your bars will be lemony and not stiff.

I also lined my pan with parchment to make the bars easy to take out.  Let them cool completely in the pan before removing them.

Wonderful starter recipe! I like a little more lemon flavor, so I increased the lemon juice to 2/3cup and added a tablespoon of flour so it would still set up. Great recipe!

The only thing: if you want a nice separation between the crust and filling, let the crust cool down for at least half an hour before pouring in the filling and cooking again.

Great recipe. Would make it again. Followed exact recipe. Perfect amount of tartness and sweetness. *However, if you like lots of lemon flavor and tartness, I would recommend adding more lemon.

I have tried to make lemon bars before and they turned out horrible (even the ones from a box). So I was a bit leery about trying this recipe, I am really glad I did because these were the best lemon bars I've ever had. I did use more lemon juice than the recipe called for and they weren't too tart or too sweet they were perfect (at least for my taste). 
Thank you for sharing this recipe.

These were exactly what I was hoping for in a lemon bar.  I did what other reviews suggested though and added 2/3 cup of fresh squeezed lemon juice and some lemon zest. 
I didn't add the extra flour though, only because I forgot.  I may try it next time, but I'm not sure it will be necessary.
These were so lemony awesome!

Followed other reviews and used 2/3 cup lemon juice with an extra 1 tbsp of flour. Also added zest from 1 lemon to the crust before baking for 20 minutes. Completely cooled crust before adding lemon topping. Added zest from 1 lemon to topping mixture and baked it again for 25 minutes.

These came out great!! I followed the advice of others to add 2/3 (about 4 regular sized lemons) cup of lemon juice and an extra tablespoon of flour. I also added a bit of salt to the crust. I do agree with some that the crust is a bit thick but was very delicious and buttery. Next time I will double the filling to match the thickness of the crust. These bars came out better than a bakery!!!

Three stars represents how I would rate this recipe without alterations. Luckily, however, I read previous comments, made some changes, and the bars turned out great! I add a pinch of salt to the crust. I needed 2/3 to 3/4 cups of lemon juice in the filling for the proportion of crust to filling to be right, otherwise the crust was too thick. For a variation that is as good as or better, try subbing lime juice and zest in for the lemon (and make sure it's at least 2/3 cups) and add a few drops of green food coloring. To die for.

Excellent as everyone raves - easily the best crust I've ever tasted on a lemon bar.  I did add about a half teaspoon of kosher salt, per suggestions.  I mixed the crust in a food processor because forgot to take the butter out early which actually worked out well.  On the filling, didn't have any fresh lemons so substituted a 1/2 cup of bottled lemon juice.  The cooking times were spot on for my oven and it came out with excellent consistency. The bottled juice worked just fine but next time would use the real thing for the slightly fresher taste and might use about another half recipe of filling as prefer thicker lemon layer.  The crust thickness in a 9x13 pan is perfect at 1/2 inch but the great tasting lemon filling was only about 1/4 inch deep.  But this is definitely my future go-to recipe for a no fail result of lemony goodness. Thanks to the submitter and all those with helpful comments.

WAAAAYY too buttery!! I read through many of the comments and added some extra lemon juice to make them nice and tart. It took longer than 20 minutes to cook as the edges were still bubbly and started burning while the center had that nice yellow crust.  Next time, I may need to add more flour to both the crust as well as the filling.

These are the best lemon bars I have ever had. I used more lemons to give it more lemon flavor (I love tart things). They turned out great!!!

Add 1/4 cup of lemon juice or add the juice of 1 more lemon to this recipe! That gives them the perfect lemony taste

I agree, these were great! I listened to other reviewers and used 2/3 c lemon juice and a little more flour.  I loved the fact the filling is firm as they are less messy.  We used powdered sugar and lemon juice glaze on the top.  just gave it a little more lemon flavor but powdered sugar would be amazing too.  Thank you for sharing!

Absolutely the best lemon bars ever. I'm serious. I've taken these to work, holiday dinners, birthday parties name it and I've taken them there .i get praises and requests to bake them every week ($$$$$)   But I've changed the recipe juuuuust a tad and they are even better than the original.

Normally I hate anything with lemon but I LOVED this one :) I couldn't believe it myself! :o 

I used 3 lemons instead of 2 (because of the other reviews) and they were very tasty & juicy (It was exactly 1 cup) and at the end had an awesome taste. So happy with my new favorite dessert :) Totally recommended!

5 Stars for Simplicity
5 Stars for Yumminess!
I made it exactly (okay I did add 3 min. on the crust bake time to 23 min.) as the recipe read and it was great!
I may try adding a little more lemon juice next time, just as others suggested.
*Tips for cutting pretty squares - let cool and chill, use a long stainless steel knife sprayed with cooking spray...makes for a beautiful presentation!

I followed the recipe exactly. The crust was a bit floury and the filling was good ratio of sweet and tart. I used two large lemons that were 3 inches and measured out a little over a 1/4 cup of lemon juice.

I think there is an excessive amount of flour in this recipe. I also doubled the amount of lemon filling and it soaked into the crust when I put it in the oven. on top of that, I found they were way too sweet. Huge disappointment. I will not be making these lemon bars again.

I made this recipe for a neighborhood picnic. It was a hit! just the right amount of sweet and tart. I made one batch of Lemon and one batch of lime. But didn't make a checkerboard because the powdered sugar would have concealed the look.

these lemon bars  taste wonderful! However, I used a smaller casserole dish and since the recipe calls for 9x13 pan and gives you cooking time for that I didn't cook my crust long enough, and it became soggy once I added the custard and cooked it. It seems too that maybe you could use a little less butter than what's called for in the Crust (at least if using a smaller dish). I used lemon juice from a plastic lemon bc it's all I had and it turned out delicious anyway- I used the whole thing. I'm sure it would be even better with real lemon juice. Next time I'll know what to do. And I will definitely make these again! Delicious!!! Thanks!!!!

I made the following changes based on the reviews I saw here:
-used a little over 1/2 cup lemon juice
-a tiny bit of salt to the crust

My own changes:
-only 1 cup sugar used for the lemon filling
-vanilla sugar added to lemon filling

I was scared to see how much sugar goes into this as I measured everything out. I decided to put less sugar in the filling, making it a lot more tarty. I thought this worked nicely because the crust was really sweet and buttery anyway. This was my first time making lemon bars and they came out great! Everyone loved them, and I already have requests to make more.

These turned out very well.  I did make a couple of small adjustments though.  To the cookie dough I added the zest of two lemons, about a teaspoon of vanilla and a pinch of salt.  I used a half cup of fresh lemon juice and the zest of one lemon for the filling.  I used an 8 by 11 inch pan because that was what I had and they came out beautifully.  The next time I make these wonderful lemon squares, I'm going to try doubling the filling which is lovely and lemony.

Thank you Patty for a great recipe.  I'll absolutely be making these again.

These came out heavenly!!! 
I loved them and so did my mum.
The only problem was that they got stuck in the pan. But that's a problem with my pan and not with the recipe. I'm buying a new pan and trying this out again!

I made this for a crowd that I was not sure even liked lemon bars. They were a hit! People were have 2, 3 and 4 that night. I did take some reviewers advice and used 2/3 cup of lemon juice because "2 lemons, juiced" is a little vague and some zest. These truly are the BEST! Thank you for the recipe.

I've tried making other lemon bar recipes, and have never liked the way they turned out. These are AWESOME! As others have suggested, I use 2/3 cup of lemon juice, and zest from two lemons to equal about a tsp. of zest. The more the better. I also make sure I cook the crust long enough so they'll hold up when you cut them into bars, around 25 min. My extended family now ask if I can make my 'perfect lemon bars' for their parties.

These are great! I hate to say I made a change but I did. I like a very tart lemon bar so I added more lemon juice (about 2/3 of a cup total) and the zest of a couple lemons. I was skeptical of this recipe because others call for so many other ingredients... baking powder, cream, powdered sugar in the crust, etc.. and these are quite simple in comparison. They are perfect.

I love this recipe and will use it from now on.  At first when I tried to cream the butter with the sugar the butter was too firm so I waited and then it was too soft, but it didn't matter-the crust was perfect and the bars were a huge hit!!  Thanks!

AWESOME. Do be sure to add lemon zest (I added 2 tablespoons.) It adds so much to the flavor and texture of the bar! They are really so easy and refreshing! Perfect summer dessert.

Are lemon bars supposed to taste very bland? These smelled like lemon but had no taste, they weren't even really sweet. I think they would have been great but I'll need to add a lot more lemon and sugar. They just tasted like bread.

Love love loved this recipe with 2 minor tweaks...you must add the zest of one lemon and use 2/3 cups of fresh lemon juice!! The crust is so delicious and this recipe is even better the next day! You will not be dissapointed.

I found this recipe so easy to make, I had two flan shells in the freezer so used those for my base instead of creating the base, absolutely beautiful lemon flan served with delicious rich vanilla bean ice cream - we luv it.

This was great! I took the advice of other reviewers, however, and used 4 lemons. It was a bit too tart for me, I think 3 would be perfect! Thanks for the recipe!

I Made the recipe exactly. 

Made the crust in the oven baked for 20 minutes, looked great when I took it out.  Mixed the top ingredients and poured the top onto the crust and set it back in the oven. 20 minutes later I took the pan out of the oven and they looked right. I waited 15 minutes for them to cool. 

When I cut the bars they were a disaster. It was as if the top had mixed in with the base. The lemon had sunk half way into the crust so it was as if there was a lemon swirl in a doughy flavourless cake.  

This was not a difficult recipe to make so I have no idea what went wrong as I made them exactly as the recipe said. I think this is just a bad recipe.

Made them according to the recipe plus lemon zest. Amazing! Coworkers ate them up in seconds. Going to try this recipe again with lime it was so good.

These lemon bars are AWESOME!  I used lemon juice from the jar because I didn't have any real lemons available, other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  I made them for my daughter who is Gluten free, just replaced flour with GF flour.  They are so yummy.  Thanks for sharing!

HOWEVER........ I use 1/2 crust recipe and 1 1/2 filling recipe.  For me I like more of the lemony custard, and using 1/2 the crust recipe is more than enough of the buttery cookie crust.

Thank you to Mommy from Seattle for your changes, as these were amazing, and honestly I normally hate lemon bars.  I find them either too sweet, to tart or both! This was my first attempt at making them and they were delicious!. Everyone loved them!

Great recipe. Only thing I did was add an extra lemon because I like my bars more on the tart side. Amazing results, looked great & everyone loves them.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  Its really so special because of its simplicity.  Currently making again  because my farmers  market had some juicy meyer lemons. I knew just what to do with them.  My 2 year old gets a kick out of helping.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I used 4 lemons instead of two. Two didn't provide enough lemon flavor and all I could taste was the butter in the crust. Other than that the recipe is perfect!

I did this in a little rush so for some reason the sugar pieces weren't all melted in the bars so there were some bits that were a little crunchy.

I've never made lemon bars or eaten them before so I tried this since I love anything and everything lemon flavored. Let me tell you these were orgasmic we almost had a fight in the house over who was eating too many! I did what other people did and added the juice of 3 lemons (1/2 cup) and I added a heaping tbsp of lemon zest. I added 1/3 cup of flour instead of 1/4 too. The crust recipe is perfection dont mess with it! Since it was a tad bit tart this first time I'm going to add 1/3 cup of sugar instead of 1/2.

You got the name right, these are the best lemon bars! I took suggestions of others and added an extra juiced lemon and a little salt for the crust.  The lemon bars have a great balance of 'sweet and tart'.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I just made this and it turned out awesome!

The original recipe is great but I adjusted the recipe to my liking. 

I made few tweaks:
1) Used cubed cold butter & work ingredients with my fingers
2) Used 2/3 cup lemon juice & zest of 1 lemon
3) Add extra 1 tablespoon of flour to filling mixture
4) Add 5 mins of bake time 

That's it!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this using the suggestions MommyFromSeattle gave, and found the recipe to be okay. I would suggest using more than the 2/3c fresh lemon juice--I found that not to be tart enou.

These are the best I have ever tasted.  However, do not use a clay pan to make these in.  Did that the first time and it was not a good result.  They were still fantastic and everyone ate them up.  I also did as others had mentioned and increased the lemon juice amount to 2/3 cup and used a little bit of lemon zest as well.  I used fresh lemons as friends who have lemon trees around here are passing them out to me like crazy.

Very tasty, although personally I think they could have used a little more tartness and lemon zest. (Other people were fairly evenly split on whether they were perfect or needed more lemon.)  Following previous suggestions, I used 1/3 cup + 2 Tbsp. of lemon juice, added the zest of 1/2 lemon, and increased the flour to 1/3 cup, but next time I will add another 2 Tbsp of lemon juice and use the zest of an entire lemon.  However, the lemon layer did set beautifully (in contrast to other lemon bar recipes I have tried), and the crust was wonderfully rich-tasting--I used salted butter, which gave a lovely flavor.

I increase the amount of lemon for more lemony bars and double the amount of crust because I like them thicker

This was a really average lemon bar recipe. I think it needed less sugar and more lemon flavor. The crust was very sweet, I would definitely add some zest to it next time. I used Meyer lemons, which may have been the problem with the sweetness. I would cut back on the sugar all together.

This was my first time making lemon bars. I was nervous because of some of the bad reviews, but maybe their ovens aren't cooking at the right temperature or something. I followed the recipe exactly, using two very large lemons (which yielded about 2/3 cup juice), and it turned out delicious! I let the pan cool completely on a wire rack and then put it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes before cutting it. This is a keeper!

These were delicious. I used about 1/3 cup of fresh lemon juice and also used about 1 tsp of lemon zest. I followed cooking times pretty much exactly, my only mistake perhaps was leaving the crust in to bake maybe a min too long(I went over by a min because it didn't seem "golden") It made the crust a little darker than I would have liked once the final product was cut. Still tasted delicious though. Next time I will stick to the original cooking time for sure. Also I made in a glass 9x13 Pyrex and it stuck a little to the pan. I wonder If I definitely should have only used a non stick pan or even then lined it with tinfoil? I will research this next time before baking.

Needed a bit more lemon for me; Next time i'll use 4 and then add the zest to the top fresh out of the oven
(edit after a night in the fridge they taste more tart so 2 is probably right if they are bigger lemons )

I just made these for a bake sale.  They are delicious!!  I did use one more lemon and 2 extra tablespoons of flour for the filling.  The crust is perfect as is.  Thanks for an amazing recipe.

Made exactly as recipe stated except made it with 3 lemons and 2 tibl flour and it was absolutely perfect!!  Was worried based on other reviews.  Too much crust, not enough filling, but it was perfect!  Made for my boss's birthday and she loved them!  Thank you for sharing this yummy recipe!

This is my go-to lemon bar recipe; I've made them at least 10 times and they are always amazing! I'm not allowed to visit my friend's parents' house without making them, they're my entrance fee! As recommended, I add the zest and pulp of two lemons, along with 2/3s of a cup of lemon juice. Can't get enough of these, simply the best!

My daughter tried this recipe because of the name.  It IS the BEST lemon bar recipe we've ever tasted!  And quick and easy to make! 
As a matter of fact, she made it on a vacation and everyone wanted more so she made up several batches throughout the week.  Now this is her signature dessert! 

In a pinch we've used the RealLemon.  It's not as authentic lemony taste but it's still yummy!!

These lemon bars were good. I may have cooked them incorrectly, but they were a little gummy. I have had better lemon bars, but these definitely tasted good. Everyone liked them :)

This is a delicious lemon bar.  If you are looking for a jelly like lemon filling...this is not your bar!  This has a perfect cookie bottom and just enough lemon on the top.  We did not have lemons but used 6 tablespoons lemon juice. My husband hates lemon bars but LOVES these.

I am going to use this recipe from now on.  I did add 2/3 c lemon juice and 1 Tbsp more flour in the lemon mix.  Crust is crunchy, which is what i prefer.  I line the pan with aluminum foil so that I can pull it out and cut into squares.  I had to bake the crust almost 20 mins.

I absolutely loved these bars. I took the advice from other comments & increased the lemon juice to 2/3 cup (3 lemons) & then added an additional tablespoon of flour to it. I also added lemon zest the the crust. My topping came out a little frothy out of the oven, but it didn't matter once I put the powdered sugar on top. I let them cool on the counter & then placed them in the fridge. After about 2 hours I was able to cut them & remove them from the pan. Definitely will make these again!

For sure the best lemon bar recipe I've used on this site. Tasted very good and baked well, tart but sweet. Some lemon bars have that unpleasant eggy aftertaste to them... these do not at all. I like the simplicity of the ingredients using only 4 eggs. I used 2/3 cup lemon juice.

Not lemony enough. Much too thin.  Flavor was blah.  Needs salt and vanilla.

This is a brilliant recipe. The crust was just amazing. I think instead of 4 eggs you can use 3. And for more lemon flavour add some lemon zest. This is a easy and tasty reciepe. My 11 year old sister could make it. So I was suprised and I also made it with her. There is a lot of balance in this lemon square. The lemon batter is very sweet while the crust isn't sweet at all. So if you eat it together it will just taste AWESOME!

I enjoyed these lemon bars but unfortunately I can't say they are the BEST lemon bars. I had to add more lemon than written to get a tarter flavor, and in the end the filling was so gooey and never really firmed up. Also the crust was too flour-y and needed more butter. However, they were still consumed within 4 days so we must have done something right!

I've made these a couple times now and they're always a hit! I've dinked around a bit, and thought I'd report my findings. I make sure to use at least 1/3 cup lemon juice, with a tbsp extra of flour in the custard to compensate for the texture. I throw in the zest from one lemon. Before I juice, I make sure to microwave the lemons and roll them around on the counter for max yield! I wasn't a fan of adding salt to the crust - I thought it added a strange, unneeded flavor. Finally, when the bars are done (and probably better to undercook a tad than get them too chewy), I dust them very lightly with powered sugar. Overall, this is an excellent recipe that even non sweets fans can enjoy!

Fantastic. The recipe was very easy to follow, even for an inexperienced college cook like myself, and the end results were highly delicious. The only thing that was a bit vague was the amount of lemon juice. I made the assumption that Patty intended to get the most of the juice out of the lemons and it appears I made the right decision. I ended up getting about half a cup of lemon juice. I will very likely make this again.

very good summer bars. next time I think I would add a little more lemon juice because 2 lemons didn't yield enough juice to make it as tart as I wanted...very buttery but delicious!

I've made these lemon bars twice now, and everyone loves them! I added a third lemon and also some lemon zest for extra tartness. The only problem I have is getting them out of the pan :( They are insanely hard to cut and scoop out, even after I leave to cool for several hours. I know the recipe says not to grease the pan. Any suggestions? The only thing missing is my presentation! 

I will still make these though, even if I can't cut them. The recipe is perfect!

These are super easy to make and really delicious. I did alter the recipe a bit after reading reviews. I squeezed enough lemons so that I had slightly over 1/2 cup of lemon juice. I added an add'l tablespoon of flour. The crust is delicious. I'm making these for co-workers - so hopefully they will like them as much as I do.

good, but too much of the cookie part and not enough lemon.  I suggest 1 1/2 the lemon glaze part and 3/4 the cookie part.

I added two tablespoons of lemonade powder, frozen lemonade concentrate to both the crust and filling mixtures. I then put a knife edge on an old spoon and scraped the lemon out adding this to the filling. Sprinkled coconut atop and baked for thirty minute. Lemon bars on steroids. 
I substituted oranges in a second batch. The textures were to die for. I served them at a family party. Their Half-Life was twenty minutes. The grandkids lined up for them.

This was s disappointment.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I added the zest of the lemons to the crust and since my lemons were small I used three instead of two.  A measurement of juice would have been preferable, mine came out to be about 1/4 cup.  I used a food processor to make the crust and my butter was not very soft, but since I was using a food processor, I thought chilled butter would work better.  The pan was a non-stick heavy gauge 9x13 pan.  In general, the crust came out well, but a bit thick and too buttery, but the topping was waaaay too sweet and not enough lemon flavor.  It was a bit gummy too, not the light creamy lemony flavor I was desiring.  I did top it with powdered sugar for a nice looking finish.  I will be looking for a different recipe or adjusting this one.  Did I mention that there was too much sugar and not enough lemon flavor!!!!

To make this recipe even better, I like to juice more lemons and also add plenty if zest. It makes the bars much more lemony and delicious.

Was playing around with the lemon mixture. Instead of 1 1/2 cups of sugar, I did 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar. For the two juiced lemons part, I used this lemon shaped juice...it says "not from concentrate" and states that it is equivalent to the juice of 6 fresh lemons (read the label after I used half of the juice lol). Thought it didn't quite taste lemon-ee so I used the juice of an actual lemon (one) and said the heck with it and used the rest of the lemon juice product. I like my lemon bars to taste tart and it did lol.

I made these and what an easy yet yummy treat! Made them for a church grillout tomorrow! I agreed with an earlier comment using 2/3 cup lemon juice extra tablespoon of flour and some zest really helps! Tart and sweet! Awesome summer treat!

The lemon curd part was pretty darn good. I just made these but I was out of butter so I substituted coconut oil in the crust. I don't recommend it. (Patty wasn't kidding about no substitutions)It was weird, a little like soggy burned peanut butter cookie. So I'll certainly make these again but not until I have butter:)Also I'll probably double the delicious lemon filling.

The crust was way to dry, although I followed the recipe exactly. When I went to cut them and plate them they all fell apart, and I probably only got about half of all of it on the plate. I gave this recipe 2 stars only because they tasted delicious!

I just got finished making this recipe. I tweaked it a bit and added some grated lemon to it and I think it made it even more delicious. The reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I was not crazy about the crust. It was quite bland. I think if I do make this again I will try for a graham cracker crust or see what others have tried.

Usually I can rely on the reviews and ratings on here to decide to make a dish. Not with this! I followed it to the letter and the crust was way too thick for the amount of filling and tasted like pure butter (and I am a butter lover and did not care for the buttery crust!). The filling was not at all lemony. The texture of the crust was a little off for me too, but I usually do not use granulated sugar in my bar crust I typically use powdered.

I read a few reviews before making these. The "bad" reviews made me a bit hesitant to make them, but I did anyway!
Here's what I did:
* White Whole Wheat Flour in place of white 
* zested the 2 large lemons & split the amount between the crust & filling (yum)

Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. I got compliments on this batch I shared at work...

I loved it. I thought these bars were great. I've never made or had lemon bars before but this exceeded my expectations. I added a bit more lemon juice to the filling and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the crust. And they came out great . Thanks for the recipe :)

I'm so proud of myself! These turned out great, made them today for Easter and had good reviews. Except for my super taster brother who found them to be too tart. I followed the advice and used about 3/4 cup which was less than two lemons. (I have a tree and they get pretty big) also I used corn starch instead of flour and azucar a non GMO sugar. Thank you for this great recipe.

The ratio of crust to lemon filling is a bit off--the bars are truly delicious, but the lemon layer is quite thin. I think that next time, I will double the ingredients for the lemon filling and adjust the cooking time accordingly.

Not the best lemon bar that I have ever had, but it was ok.  
I found that the crust portion was too thick.  My taste testers agreed.
I also think that I will have to play around with quantities of sugar and lemon juice until I get just the right balance.
I will try again with adjustments.

The recipe is very easy to make. It is not clear as to how much lemon juice, 2 lemons can vary a lot. I used 2/3 cup lemon juice and a table spoon of zest, since I had the lemons there. Also the edges came out too done, so make sure to let your crust cool before you add the lemon layer. I'd give it 5 stars easy after that tweaking.

Pretty solid lemon bar. Just tart enough, got the right texture, and great yellow color. Needed to reduce the amount of sugar in the lemon mixture by about 1/3- too sweet otherwise, and it dulls the delightfully tart flavour that I so enjoy in a lemon bar.

I used 2/3 cup of lemon juice and it turned out ok. This recipe does make does make too much crust for a 9x13 though. Next time I will probably reduce the flour to 1.5 cups.

This recipe is great, but the website is having some technical issues. I don't know what's happening but it kept showing me different ingredients every time the page was refreshed.

Really good recipe! I've substituted lemons with lemon juice before and they still turned out okay (not as bright or flavorful though). Have to be careful when baking; they burn easy around the edges.

I am a beginner of all beginners when it comes to baking, but this recipe was so easy to follow. I made some adjustments on my way and I'd like to share those. I put 3 oz of butter, 1 1/2 cup of flour and added a little less than 1 ts of salt for the crust. The crust looked a bit too dry when I first put it in the pan, but it turned out just fine. Next time I make this, I'll do everything just the same but put only 1/2 ts of salt. Also, I had the crust stay in the oven for 20 minutes and the filling for 30 minutes. After that, I let it cool in room temperature then in the fridge before I cut it. I made this for a potluck and everyone said the amount of butter, salt, and sugar was just perfect. One last thing, do not forget parchment paper! I had to cut it in the pan, which left some scratches on the bottom of the pan :(

Absolutely love this simple, but delicious recipe! I made these for the first time the other day and they were perfect! The crust was a little thicker than I thought it would be, but that was my favorite part:) Thanks for posting this recipe! I will be sharing these yummy treats with my friends and family for sure.

These are really good. I added more lemon extract and lemon zest. Felt they weren't quite "lemony" enough. Good crust on these though!

The repose is great but depends on the lemons. I used two huge home grown lemons with lots, lots, juice. If I would have used a couple of medium lemons then the flavor would change. So just add more lemons if you like it stronger.

I really love the crust, not too thick not too thin, better than the cafe lemon bars :)
I would give this a 5 star rating but the recipe should have 1 more lemon. But otherwise, it's delicious! :)

The family loved this recipe - especially the husband who doesn't usually care for this type of dessert.  Used the 2 lemons I had on hand which gave me about 1/2 a cup of juice and added a little salt to the dough.  Will definitely make again!

I have always had trouble with lemon bars being too runny. After seeing this recipe I decided to give it another whirl and I am so please that I did. These are so good. I used 2/3 cup of bottled lemon juice because I did not have any lemons and increased the flour to 1/2 cup. I did bake the crust 25 minutes also.

Wonderful!  Based on the reviews, I increased lemon filling to 5 eggs, 2 cups of sugar, 1/3 cup of flour, 1 cup of lemon juice, and zest of 1 lemon.  I increased cooking time by 5 minutes.  Turned out incredible!

We enjoy these bars so much with that tart/sweet taste. I do increase the filling to 6 eggs, 1 1/2 cups white sugar, 1/3 cup all-purpose flour, 3 lemons, juiced, and 1 tsp of lemon zest. I bake the crust and filling for 5 minutes more and when still warm, dust with powdered sugar. If I need to increase the pan size to 10x15, as required for funerals at our church, this works well.

This is great! I added more lemon juice, half cup to be exact plus a little more flower to thicken the consistency. It turned out really good but you have to like them with more of a tartness to the lemon taste.

Great recipe but definitely make sure to add AT LEAST 2/3 cup of lemon.. It also works MUCH better in an 8x11 pan.. Thick like at the bakery.....Other than that it is a perfect recipe. (Don't forget powdered sugar on top)

these are the best lemon bars ever!! I really enjoyed these lemon sweets and they were very easy to make. The crust did need a little bit more sugar, but all I did was sprinkle some on top of the un-cooked crust. I baked the crust for a full twenty minutes because if its not baked all the way it will taste doey. But over all it was GREAT!!!

I made this recipe exactly as it's written not having any preconception of how Lemon Bars are supposed to be as I've never tasted them. Very disappointing. Despite following recommendations in other comments to add 2/3 Cup Lemon Juice, I could barely taste the lemon. The base was too thick in proportion to the topping. The recipe & comments sounded good but I won't be making this slice again.

Great recipe!! My Grandmother and Mom both use to make these for our family. LOVE them! I do add extra lemon and zest. I never use bottled lemon juice it just isnt the same. I have changed up the recipe from another reviewers opinion. She added a glaze with lemon juice and powdered sugar. I added a little vanilla as well. This totally changed the game. All of my family has added this as well. It just takes the recipe to the next fabulous level of awesomeness.

The lemon mixture turned out far to runny, so I had to add sugar, flour, and finally, corn starch. The crust needed a bit more sugar so as to taste something else than butter. I recommend adding maybe and 1/8 cup of sugar to the crust, or even a 1/4. Than, add at least one more lemon to the lemon mixture, and maybe a tad more sugar. It definitely needs more lemons, though, because they're at least supposed to be lemony. I made lime bars with this recipe, and actually, they turned out better than I expected given the amount of changing I had to do with the recipe. So, overall, the recipe was okay. Oh, by the way, I highly recommend lime bars. Just replace lemons with the lime, and it tastes fantastic in a lemon bar recipe!

I made these for Christmas and they were good. I wrote down on my copy to use less lemon. It does say in the description they are tart but they were way too tart. I think 1 lemon would be plenty. Perhaps I had very juicy lemons?!

Great lemon bars!  The crust took about 35 mins to bake rather than 20.  Also, is the recipe missing the powdered sugar step (shown in the picture)?

The best lemon bars, ever. Lemon bars have always been one of my favorite desert bars but I had never tried making them til I saw this recipe and how easy it seemed. From the wonderful buttery crust to the greatness of the lemon, these were fantastic. I can't believe how simple they were to make and that I had all of the ingredients on hand. I did use 3/4 cup fresh lemon juice and a tablespoon of zest and added the extra tablespoon of flour, so it would set properly. Turned out perfect and were a huge hit with my family. Will definitely be making these again (and again). Thank you for such a great recipe!

I loved this recipe! Very easy and I had all the ingredients on hand already. The only tweak I made was I added a teaspoon of lemon zest so that there would be a very bold lemon flavor. They turned out AWESOME!!! I will definitely be making these again.

I add 2/3 cup lemon juice and up the flour to 1/3cp. Used the full amount of sugar since I increased the lemon juice. I also added he zest from the lemons I used (1/4-1/3cup). Increased the bake time to 25-30 minutes. Perfectly tart.

I joined All Recipes just so I could comment on THIS recipe!  I am the worst baker so I was kinda nervous about making lemon bars for my boyfriend.  This recipe was SO easy!  I ended up using 3 lemons instead of 2 but everything else was the same.  He loved them and ate half the pan in one day! He even cried about my family eating the rest.  No one in my family is crazy about sweets but they were all scraping the pan to get more! I was so happy with the outcome.

I would either bake the crust a little longer or make it much thinner. It was a bit too dense. I used 6 tablespoons of lemon juice and the flavor was great!

I have to agree that, for me, there was not the tart taste I expected. "Juice of 2 lemons" is misleading since lemons come in varying sizes. It would be better to give an amount. The suggestion to "use at least 1/2 cup of lemon juice" by MommyFromSeattle is a good one. Using the zest from the 2 lemons also will add to the tartness who like their lemon bars that way.

Made this last night and followed suggestions from others about adding extra lemon juice as we like real lemony flavors.  Very satisfied with flavors, but the crust stuck to the pan....really stuck.  Has anyone else experienced this and how did you fix it??

Best thing I made last Christmas.  Family was fighting over them, which is embarrassing because they're all 50 years of age and over.  Amazing--followed the "add extra lemon juice" suggestion.  Simply amazing.

This was a complete mess to make! I used a slightly smaller brownie pan (6.5 x 10.5), which was probably not the best idea. The lemon mixture spilled all over the place. I had really low expectations making this dessert. I ended up burning the crust and the lemon mixture came out way too thin and watery. However, I poured the lemon mixture on top of the crust and I shoved it in the oven, and took my chances. It took way longer to cook than the stated 20 minutes, more like 40 minutes for me. After letting it cool down, I added the powdered sugar and lemon zest, and it looked very pretty. I packed it up and took it to a dinner party without tasting it and I hoped for the best. I was shocked to take a bite out of it at the party and discover it was so delicious. Everyone raved about how good it was too!!! This is truly a no-fail recipe. But does anyone know how to prevent the powder sugar from melting on top? It looked like the bars were sweating at the party.

This recipe is very similar to the one I use with a couple changes.  1) Use powdered sugar for the crust instead of regular sugar.  2) Use cold butter for the crust and cut it into the flour/sugar mix like you would for a pie crust (please do not use anything other than butter - yummy!) 3) IF you are looking for a quantity of fresh lemon juice (please use fresh, it's so much better than bottled) I use 5/8 C. 4) Add 2 t baking powder to lemon mixture - it makes the filling extra light and fluffy.  Be prepared for the raves, you will now be known for your lemon bars!

I just tried the bars, easy as anything, however, make sure you do it for at least 24.  I cut it down for 12. Not a good idea, but that was my fault.  I also used Splenda as I didn't have any white sugar and I used margarine. So right now I am munching on the skinniest best lemon bars in the world, and it was all my fault.....LOL!  It is not going to keep me from doing it properly, either. :-) 
I will still rate this high even though it didn't work for me.

I made these on a whim and realized too late into my preparation that I had no lemons, so I substituted with 5-1/2 Tablespoons of lemon juice and 1/2 teaspoon of lime juice. I also didn't have enough butter, so I used 1/2 c. margarine and 1/2 c. butter. In the end, these still turned out with delicious, buttery crust, and nice evenly sweet and tart topping, just like they should be! I have had bad luck with lemon bars in the past, so this time, I poured the lemon mixture onto the crust immediately after the crust was done, not letting the crust cool before returning it to the oven. I will definitely make these again, but with fresh fruit and all butter next time. Great recipe and so easy. Thank you for sharing!

This was super easy and very inexpensive to make. My first time ever making lemon bars so I figured I start with a basic recipe and they turned out perfect. Really good, not too sweet and not too tart. Perfect! This is a keeper.

MMMMMMMM! I have never been a lemon person...but with our lemon tree bursting with them I decided to give this a shot. I went with others suggestions and put the juice of 5 lemons and up'd the flour a little to make up for it. Oh wow. These were so amazing I have been asked to make them for the holidays as well! 
Oh, and I forgot to mention how EASY these were to make!

I say it was ok because I did read a lot of pros and cons.  20mins is not sufficient for the crust part... literally need to keep it in the oven until the edges are golden. Also, the juice of 2 lemons is not enough. like the majority of ppl said: you need to add ? cup of lemon juice. Other than that, it's a pretty easy and I recommend it to every one!  AWESOME TASTE!!!!

I found that the bars were better the second day. The first day, I could taste the flour in the lemon filling. Big turnoff.  Two stars.  The next day, pure lemon yumminess!  Five stars.  (I used 1/2 c. lemon juice and zest in the crust and the filling.)

Great recipe.  I've been using this for years.  The first time I made them, my husband felt they weren't tart enough.  So, as others stated, I used more lemon juice and I also used the lemon rind from both lemons.  Rind is used in lots of recipes like this and it adds a really nice flavor.  Remember to use a little more flour though if you add more lemon juice so they set right.

Amazing lemon bars. I added the zest of one lemon, plus 1/4 tsp of salt. I couldn't fathom not including them. Anything with lemon juice is elevated to the next level with zest and salt is necessary to enhance depth of flavor. It did not alter the consistency of the batter whatsoever. Oh man, they were yummy.

These were fabulous. I took some of the advice given by other users and added more sugar to the crust. I also added salt and a hint of cinnamon and nutmeg to make it more exciting. The lemon part was delicious. I used lemon juice from a bottle and put in 6-7 tbsp. It worked wonderfully all my friends want the recipe.

I had lost a similar recipe, years ago and wanted to make those same lemon bars as I had made for my daughter when she was a little girl...now wanted to make them for she and my grandchildren and son-in law... I happened to find this recipe and thought I'd give it a shot...WOW!!  What a surprise!  It was spot-on!  My family absolutely loved it!  These are, by far, the "Best Lemon Bars" ever!  This recipe will NOT get lost and will be in our family for many years to come! :)

It was doughy and not very tasty. When I think of lemon bars I want it to taste lemon-y and sugary. Didn't like it at all.

These were good, but not great - I know I've eaten (if not made) better Lemon Bars.
I did make this recipe exactly as written, except that it needed to be baked longer, about 22 minutes, until it seemed done.
I ate the whole batch over about a week, and they tasted pretty good, but the top layer seemed a little odd - maybe too many eggs? One thing that wasn't elaborated on, in preparing the bottom (crust) layer, was using a pastry blender. Were I a beginner, I wouldn't have know about it, but I worked the pastry blender, and firmly pressed the crust, and I really thought that the crust was deserving of "The Best" title; it's just that the top layer needs a little tweaking.

I didn't have any fresh lemons so I used 2/3 cup lemon juice from concentrate but other than this, followed the instructions exactly. They turned out GREAT! My husband and father in law really LOVED these!

I made the whole recipe using my food processor - using frozen butter and first cutting it into the sugar and flour (and some salt).  Then making the filling in the processor as well.  I am gluten free so I used my GF flour. I also subbed cornstarch for the flour in the filling for a silkier filling.  The crust was tender, and the bars were delicious.

Pretty delicious! I cut the recipe in half and baked in an 8x8 pan. The only thing I would suggest is more lemon juice.

Best lemon bars ever. Make sure not to over beat the lemon, egg and sugar mixture to preserve the jelly texture. I have noticed even if I reduce the sugar by a 1/4 cup it still is quite sweet. Received tons of accolades for these bars. Many thanks!

Made it twice. The flavor was ok, but too sweet for me. Followed other reviewers recommendations on half cup of lemon juice, and cook crust well. The result was a butter saturated crust and a lemon curd that kept falling off when I cut the bars to serve.

i would only give this a 3 cause the crust is way to thick. I like my lemon filling to be thicker than the crust and the crust was way too thick. I think the recipe is a great one but just needs some tweeking. I would half the crust recipe and add pinch of salt to it. Also the baking time on the crust was way to long. I would cook 12 mins or less. Mine was way over cooked once i cooked the filling. I was kind of bummed it didn't turn out perfect the first time. Next time i will make adjustments. * and extra twist mix one softened cream cheese w 1/2 c sugar 1tsp vanilla and one egg. Pour over crust and than pour over the filling over that. The cream cheese will rise to the top. maybe add an extra 5-10 mins for baking.

I tried the lime adaptation suggested at the end, with the juice of 5 limes (trying for the equivalent of 3 lemons instead of 2).  They were awesome!  I got rave reviews and suggestions to make them for St Patrick's day next year ( because I dyed them green).  The recipe is so easy and the ingredients are inexpensive, I will put this on my regular dessert rotation.

Me and my husband LOVED this recipe!!  They were easy (which for me is the only way I will bake!) AND we made them gluten free.  I just substituted Bob's Red Mill White Rice Flour in instead of their 'all purpose flour'.  And everyone loved them-- gluten free AND non gluten free!!

This was the first time I have made lemon bars so I wasn't sure what to expect. They were easy to make and turned out deliciously! I added about a T of lemon zest and a pinch of salt to the crust. The crust is so buttery and yummy. After reading some reviews I made sure we got a full 1/2 cup of lemon juice in and everything turned out great - I'd say the perfect balance between the crust and filling. Looking forward to serving these to guests tonight.

I thought that these Lemon Bars were fairly good. The crust was too buttery in my opinion, and there was way to much. I ended up using about half of the crust. I liked the taste of the lemon filling, though. When I first tried one, the filling wouldn't stay on the crust, but the next day they were perfect. I wouldn't call this the "best lemon bar recipe", but I that it is very good for how easy it is. The only thing I changed, was the amount of time I cooked the bars. I will defiantly be using this recipe again, but only because of how easy it is. If you want to make something amazing or for something important, I suggest you look for a better recipe.

For the crust 1/2 the amounts= butter to 1/2 cup and flour 1 cup instead of 2,  Double the lemon filling = 4 lemons (add lemon zest as well) and 8 eggs (all sugar amounts stay the same if you use truvia sugar, flour in the filling stays the same), USE A 9 x 12 pan to get proportions of filling to crust right.

I've used the recipes multiple times to make lemon bars, and each time it turns out great! 
For a healthier lemon bar, I use Splenda in place of sugar and substitute the flour with. It's not as good, but is a still a healthier treat!

Excellent! However, I did do a substitution- I had about 1/2 lard on hand that needed to be used up, so I cut that in with 1/2 c. butter, and added about 1/2 tsp. salt to the crust- YUM! As other reviewers recommended, added some bottled lemon juice to the mix, as I only had about 1/3 c. fresh to get a little over 1/2 c. juice, and threw in the zest, as well. Also added a tiny amount of vanilla and almond extracts to wet mixture (because I can't resist doing that sort of thing!) Wonderful crust-to-topping ratio, and my MIL and sons were delighted with the bars. (And three bars later, so am I!) Might try making the recipe as written next time, LOL! Really good bars. Thank you, Patty Schenck!

This recipe is OUTSTANDING!!  This is the first review I have ever written on a recipe and for me to do this....it must be Great!  I also want to give Kudos to the original recipe and to everyone who wrote their suggestions...I read them all and took them into consideration for my first time making them.  I made them at Christmas along with Lime squares, placed them on platter alternating the green and yellow squares.....the presentation was beautiful and everyone kept sampling to see which one they liked better!  The results were Inconclusive!!  hahaha....They devoured them all!!  Thank you all for your time and suggestions....This is the ONE and ONLY lemon square recipe I will use!!

The crust on mine is like shortbread held together nicely. The lemon flavor is going to depend on your lemons. All lemons are not created equal, I just juiced 4 and had a cup of juice. I have had lemons with very little flavor. Hint, check out you lemon by taste tart & sour = great. Lack flavor without pucker either need more or new ones. You could probably use the plastic lemon for flavor, but to me it has a funky taste. My next batch is in the oven for friends by special requests. 
I did not tweak or change anything. If everyone loved it why fix it if it isn't broke. This is a keeper as is.

Very GOOD! I made these for a family BBQ and everyone raved how good they were. Not too tart or sweet. Just perfect. I did add extra lemon juice and a pinch of salt to the crust as suggested by others and they were delicious. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

The crust tastes WAY too buttery. After I read a review that highlighted the same problem, I added 5 more grams of sugar to the crust mix. Yet the crust was still complete butter-taste. 

Also, I think at least a little lemon zest is necessary in lemon bars. 

Finally, I should have been careful with the size of tray I baked these on. I used two trays and clearly one of them was bigger tray than the right size -- my "bars" turned out more like moist cookies on that one.

I thought these tasted great but were too thin. I think for the size of the pan at least the lemon topping should be doubled. Only used half the amount of sugar in the lemon custard and added salt to the crust, as many suggested. Very yummy overall.

Did everything as directed and a little more. I used 3/4 cup lemon juice and lightly sprinkled the crust with sugar before baking. I also let the crust cool before adding the topping and baking.

Maybe it's just that I'm not a great baker, but this was so tasteless and dry that I scraped off the top layer! Honestly, it's probably me, and a good thing for my Weight Watcher weigh-in too.

The filling for this recipe was great: sweet, tangy, and keeps you going back for more.

Sadly, I was very disappointed with the crust. There was not enough sugar and it was not crisp like my typical recipe does.

I'll make sure to add more sugar next time and let the crust pre-bake longer

I baked this in the oven.  Also used 4 eggs & 1/4 cup flour in filling. Best lemon bars ever.

It was good, but very floury on the outsides, and more lemony on the inside squares. If you like really lemony squares I recommend 4 lemons, and if you just like the lemony taste add 3 (not 2 it's too little). Otherwise very good (with powdered sugar).

AMAZING!!!  I did what others reviewers said and added 1/4 tsp Salt to the crust.  For the filling I did 1.5 of the recipe so I would have a more custard on top.  I think it would also be fine just as the recipe states depending on how you like your lemon bars.  I also used 1 cup of Lemon Juice in my filling.  I only meant to add 3/4 cup but it turned out great anyways.  Not too tart.  Perfect.  Added powdered sugar right out of the oven so it would stick.  Let the lemon bars cool down before i put the pan into the fridge.  Cut them when the bars were chilled.  YUMMY!!

I had trouble with this recipe... most of the reviews said to double the crust, and double the lemon. Well make sure to double the cooking time... mine never fully set. Mad!!

This was very good but not lemony enough. I made it as written but I added the zest of the two lemons.   Next time I would use 3-4 lemons

These are named appropriately! The crust is so buttery and delicious. As for the filling I did what others did with was 2/3 cup lemon juice and the zest of 3 lemons 1/3 cup flour to make it not too runny. I also made a recipe and a half or filling to make super deep lemon bars. Wonderful!

out DELICIOUS! It's a keeper :)

I made these when I had to throw a dessert together on the fly. I truly did not expect them to be this easy to make and this delicious. I got compliments on them all night and had about a dozen different people ask me for the recipe! I'd say these lemon bars were a success! They are definitely going into my recipe box for future use!

This recipe definitely deserves five stars!  It's good exactly as written or with a few modifications from other reviewers.  My personal taste is to add 2/3 c lemon juice, instead of 1/2 c and add 1/2 tsp salt to the crust.  Delicious!  I only had the opportunity to split one square (can't take to a party without tasting).  Unfortunately, the entire platter was empty when I went to get one.  Everyone loved them.  I'm getting ready to make more right now!

Use at least 2/3 cup lemon and the zest of 2 lemons! I will also double the lemon filling part next time because there was too much crust.

I made a great gluten free version by substituting amaranth flour for the white flour. I also used about half the sugar and it was still deliciously sweet.

I made this exactly as directed. Baked the crust for 15 minutes then poured the lemon mixture into the pan and continued cooking for 20 minutes. I let it completely cool then placed in the refrigerator for a while before cutting and serving.  Dusted with powdered sugar.  Amazing.  The crust is wonderful. I think I'll use the crust again in some other pie-ish recipes. Definitely a dense shortbread cookie like crust.

These are truly the best lemon bars! My big family can enjoy them and still have some to take to a potluck or whatnot. We always mix the dough until it begins to form little balls. This crust is also a fantastic shortbread! Our family uses it as our fruit pie crust as well! It comes out amazing!!!

This recipe is VERY similar to the ones my Grandmother's neighbor always made when we came to visit.  The only difference is you grated the lemon rinds and added with the lemon juice.  She also added 1 tsp. baking powder.  These are the best lemon bars I have ever eaten, bar none!

I made this recipe for a party and got mixed reviews on it. There were a few people that found the lemon flavor to be too strong and in fact they make me pucker a bit. Some people thought the bottom was too thick and in a 9x13 inch rectangular dish the bottom ends up being about half of the bar. Overall I thought they were pretty decent. My only suggestion that I wish someone had told me is to cut your bars and then sprinkle your powdered sugar on them, it makes for a much prettier appearance.

Make sure to pat the crust down along the sides evenly, or else the edges won't look as nice. We used lemon juice from the bottle too, and they came out really nice.

This was the first time I made Lemon Bars and I was a little nervous I'd get it wrong.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out just as I ideally imagined them!! They were the perfect combination of sweet and tart. The crust was perfect as well. Excellent!

These are really nummy. The only reason they get 4 stars instead of 5 from me is that I had issues with the filling separating from the crust a bit. I used a 8x11 pan for thicker crust. I also added a small amount of lemon zest since I didn't have quite enough lemon juice. The taste was amazing. Easy and delicious dessert.

These were very good even though I made the BIG mistake of baking them on a cookie sheet. I was suprised when they actually turned out incredible, even with my mistake. I'm sure they would be simply amazing in the pan that the recipes suggests. Overall rating: VERY GOOD!!!!!

This recipe was so good. I made the first batch for some patients of mine and then another for myself. The only substitution i used was coconut oil instead of butter.  I was trying to give it a five stars but my computer is being difficult so i could only do three

I can't stop eating these! And I am suppose to be on a diet!
The lemon bars are very soft, melt in your mouth. I added about 4 tbsp of lemon juice concentrate as an addition to the two small lemons I had.
Very sweet and tangy. Just a perfect recipe overall.Other than adding a little more lemon juice, I didn't change a thing.

Phenomenal!  The lemon flavor isn't too overpowering or extreme.  I made these for my great grandmother who lives in a nursing home and she hid them in her dresser so she wouldn't have to share!

I made these for a quick Sunday evening treat. This recipe is wonderful and super easy. Personally tatstes may vary. I'll be adding some lemon zest next time just to bump up the lemon flavor, however, the recipe is great as it is. Thank you!

Crazy good. Made them for St. Paddy's with 5 drops of green food coloring. I like a really lemony bar, so I used about 2 1/2 lemons - ended up being about 2/3 cup lemon juice and also used about 2 TBSP of lemon zest. Also added an extra TBSP of flour to the lemon mixture to compensate. Honestly though, I think the crust really makes these bars.  It was outstanding.

Wonderful recipe!  I tweaked it though.  I woke up on a Saturday morning and I had to have lemon bars but alas had no lemons.  I did, however, have real lemon concentrate, real lemon extract, lemon oil, and dried lemon zest.  So I used 1 tbsp of concentrate, 1 tsp each of the other 3 in the egg mixture.  I also added a half tsp of lemon oil to the crust batter.  OMG!  Probably the best lemon bars ever!  My family and friends are begging me to make another batch today.  Necessity is the mother of invention after all.

These lemon bars were amazing. The crust is buttery and delicious and the filling is perfect, even comes out a bit matte on top for a cleaner look.  I did make one and a half recipes of the filling for the amount of filling that there was, with a bit more lemon juice and flour. Enjoy, this ones a keeper.

So 2 lemons yields 1/2cup of lemon juice and that didn't seem tart enough to me so I added a third. I also added 2tbsp of lemon zest. Be careful of the pith. You don't want to accidentally throw some in there. You'll definitely taste it. Rookie mistake on my part. There is definitely too much sugar for my personal liking. I'll use just 1c next batch. The crust was great. I have to stop myself from eating the whole batch. All in all a great recipe!

The crust was too crumbly and not golden and the filling was barely sufficient to fill the 9x9 pan. I find that this lack of filling problem occurs with ALL the lemon bar recipes I've tried. My family thought it was far too sour, but I thought it just a bit too sour, because I have a tolerance and liking for sourness. But I'm not going to lower the rating for that, because I did reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup as well as increase the lemon juice and added lemon zest. I also didn't dust the top with powdered sugar, because my family isn't huge on sugar.
Nonetheless, it was pretty good, just not the crust, and the filling was a tad too sour. If there's a next time, I'll use 1 cup sugar for the filling, make 50% more filling, and add more butter in the crust.

My aunt has always made lemon bars and I've always LOVED them, but never made them myself.  I thought this recipe sounded like a good, basic start.  I was a little nervous pouring the liquid lemon/egg/sugar mixture over the crust, but it set up just fine.  They turned out great and I didn't change a thing!

I've tried several recipes and this is the best. I did add the zest of two large lemons. I also microwaved my lemons for a few seconds to make juicing easier. The crust is tender and the filling is tart & creamy. I've found my go- to recipe!

These were marvelous! I also made the lime bars. I used 3 limes and juiced them in my juicer. It made about 1/2 cup or 4 oz of juice. Next time I will use 4 or 5. They weren't as strong as the lemon. But they were beautiful together.

Simple ingredients and a really nice outcome. Based on suggestions I made a few adjustments. CRUST: I used only about 2/3 of the crust in a smaller casserole dish (1/4 -1/3 inch thick). Make sure to really get the crust golden otherwise it won't hold together well. I also used my hands to mix the crust and kneaded it like pie dough to create "streaks" of butter/flour to increase flakiness. CUSTARD: I used a little more than 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice & the zest of 2 lemons to really boost the pucker factor. Because I used a smaller dish I had to cook it a bit longer. With less crust & thicker lemon custard they're very gooey but they got rave reviews from family & coworkers.  I my cut a little sugar out next time - even with the added lemons they were too sweet for my taste. Also- don't use Meyer lemons. I tried this before with Meyers and the result was not tart. Meyer lemons are an orange hybrid and much less tangy than a regular lemon.

This recipe was easy and turned out delicious!  Crust, like others said, is not super sweet; I prefer it less sweet anyhow though.  Wonderful little recipe that you can tweak as you see fit.  I added a bit more zest and a bit more lemon juice.

I used three lemons from my back yard instead of 2 because I like the lemon flavor. Other than that I followed everything else just as written. It was very good! I think I may try like others suggested to add some lemon zest as well.

I'll be perfectly honest: I didn't care for these. I found the crust to be WAY too thick, and the lemon curd to not be thick enough. The ratios were off, for sure. I took the suggestions of the other reviewers and used 1/2 cup of lemon juice, which really bumped up the flavor, but there just wasn't enough of it, compared to the crust. I was pretty disappointed. They were good, just not as good as they could be.

tastes really nice :) But i did make a few changes. First off, i added 30 gms of flour to the crust and took 10 gms of sugar off the original measurement :) after forming the "crust", i chilled it for around 30 minutes before popping it in the oven. Once the crust was done, I poured hald the egg/lemon mixture and baked it for 5 minutes then added the remaining half after. I also prolonged the baking time to around 5-10 mins :D went out pretty firm :D I suggest you adjust the amount of lemon juice to your preference. If you want it lemony tarty then add more lemon but if you dont then just lessen the amount of lemon :)

I used an 8 by 13 baking pan for this :)

Quick and everyone loves these.  I make them whenever I need something quick, but nice-looking for a get-together. I think there could be more lemon filling, but it tasted amazing anyways.

4 only because I modified it with 5 lemons (3/4 cup lemon juice), extra tablespoon of flour in the lemon mixture.  Otherwise, bake the crust until a little more golden - I had "moving" crust when I put on the lemon part.

My boyfriend loved these bars!!!
The recipe is amazing!  Very easy and quick to make, no mess, and most importantly - delicious!
I substituted sugar with Splenda (just to cut down on some of the calories), and it turned out great...
Would recommend it to everyone, and will definitely make it again! :)

Excellent filling!!! Since I had no idea how much lemon juice the poster of this recipe really used, I went with 2/3 cups and it was just the way I like it...on the tarter side. 

For the crust I reduced the ingredients by 1/4 and used a 9 x 9 pan to get a thicker filling. Next time I will probably make even less crust.

All in all a great recipe.

This came out very different but still extremely delicious. also taking into account that I'm a beginner cook, I did suffer from some burns on the first layer before it was even put in for the second step (with the  lemony part). but it still came out great!

These are fantastic!  I didn't have fresh lemons, but I like them REALLY lemony so I  followed a previous reviewers recommendation and used 2/3 cup lemon juice and added an extra tablespoon of flour.  They are wonderfully tart!  If you like less tart, more sweet then do less lemon juice and don't add the extra flour.  I can't recommend these enough!

Sooo tasty. The only thing I did differently was add a bit more lemon juice, but I know they would have been good without it too.

This is my family's FAVORITE dessert. I personally don't like my lemon bars sickly sweet, so I added a lot more lemon juice. The recipe calls for 2 lemons juiced. If you want a more specific amount, then  do 2/3 cups. It's PERFECT....(and cut down some sugar...) :D

I made this recipe exactly like it said.  I had never made before.  It was great.  I had to leave the crust in the oven longer than 20 minutes to get it to harden, but I think that is also because I didn't blend the flour, sugar and butter as evenly as I could have, but it still worked out ok.  Friends loved it!  Not really really lemony though.

These are TO. DIE. FOR. I used the zest and juice of three large lemons (1/2 cup juice). This is a must for tangy lemony filling. Please juice fresh lemons, people; don't use the concentrate! It makes ALL the difference. I also added 1/2 teaspoon salt to the filling. I baked in a slightly smaller pan (23 minutes for crust and then another 23 for filling). I did not cool the crust before pouring the filling on. The only complaint is that I think the taste of the crust is a little overpowering - it's very buttery, and you can taste it more than the lemony filling. Next time, I would make the crust thinner.

I absolutely oved these!!! I followed another review and added another half recipe for the shortbread to make it a little thicker. And I used a little over 2/3 cup of fresh lemon juice. I like tart lemon tarts and not everybody does so...next time I may jut cut the recipe in half and make in a 8x8 dish.

Hey all, especially Patty. I've been meaning to write this and get your feedback but I thought I could solve it on my own.

Mine is a strange story. I got the amounts (not proportions) wrong as I was using a measuring cup that was = 2.5 cups and not 1 cup.

It turned out perfect but I had double the crust -no biggie. The filling was white and translucent and oozing. The icing sugar topping didn't melt and the crust was crispy and biscuit-like. All in all, a wonderful 1st try.

My 2nd attempt was horrible and the filling came out too eggy even though I added only 1 more egg.

I then realised that I could get the measurements in metric (I'm stupid like that) but I tried to proceed with what I thought was my wrong measurements, in metric this time and the next 3 or 4 attempts came up bad, especially the crust.

I went back to Patty's original recipe in metric and it turned out good except that the crust wasn't crispy around the edges and the filling wasn't oozy and was yellow.

My question is this, how do I get the same results as my 1st time? I really loved it then! Somehow, the filling wasn't yellow and the consistency was fantastic (though a little too sweet).

I've done this 8 times now and I can't get it back even by following the recipe to the letter! I especially need to get the crust crispy all round again!

OMG, please help!!!!

Very easy to make! I always have these ingredients in my kitchen. My husband and his friend ate half the pan! I will most certainly make these again! No changes were made to the original recipe.

Perfect!
I choose this recipe to be the one i follow on my first time ever baking these lemon bars.
I did however follow the suggestions of adding more lemon juice (taste it while mixing till you get the zest you need)
and i did leave the crust to cool for while before applying the lemon-sugar fill.
Thanks my collegues at work loved it!

Recipe is nice and simple! I replaced the lemon with an orange and used the zest from the orange to add an extra kick of flavor. They were awesome!

I read through some reviews and made a few changes; used an 8 x 12 pan, added zest from 1 lemon, and 3/4 cup lemon juice to the filling; however, still the filling was not as much as I had hoped nor as tart as I would have liked.  I will make again and double the filling plus more juice in the filling.  The shortbread/crust is wonderful and came out perfect in the smaller pan.

If I made these again, I would grease the edges since the edges were hard to get out.  I took in some comments like SallyCats'.  Though I didn't add that much lemon as she suggested.  I think with any lemon based product, it really depends on your taste.  So I started to taste as I went on adding the lemon,  I added the eggs at the end so I wouldn't have tasted the egg as I went on testing how much lemon to put in.  They were good overall, just taking a star away from the direction's technical errors.

Wonderful recipe! I have made it many times, and everyone loves them. I never go by the "2 lemons" guidelines, but add about 1/3 cup lemon juice, maybe a little more, and then they actually are "lemon" bars. Thank you for a great recipe overall!

The bars I made from this recipe were good, but it is a little frustrating when a recipe calls for "juice of one lemon" or the like. Lemons come in many sizes with a hugely diverse amount of juice. Why not specify an amount of juice? 
My personal rule for most anything lemon is equal amounts of sugar and juice.
These were not the "best" lemon bars I've ever made for my taste, which is admittedly different from others.

Love! These are really great bars and I prefer the crust to lemon ratio on this recipe...it's just the right balance (not an over-abundance of lemon topping). I use 2/3 to 3/4 cup of lemon juice, from fresh lemons. I also love that I do not need to grease my pan - they come right out because of the amount of butter in the crust. Delicious!

I like the bars sweet but still have enough fragrance of the lemons. In this I used lime due to lack of lemons and it was fantastic! I didn't see the "ungreased pan" rule so the crust was a little too crunchy. Do not make the same mistake! And perhaps cooking in a glass tray would be better? I had to cook the crust in only 12 minutes for a dark pan and then 18 minutes with the filling but the crust was still burnt a little (probably because of the oil). If you like tartness or it to be more sweet you should taste the filling a little before pouring it over the crust. Good luck!

This was my first time making lemon bars at all, let alone from sratch, but think this recipe will need some TLC if I try it again. 

The flavor wasn't bad, although a bit too sweet and tart (reminscent of lemonhead candy). Tasted like a condensed filling. Was difficult to manage cutting (I refrigerated first) and spreads very thin (used a small nonstick rectange pan 11x7 I think). Also the crust was a little lack-luster IMO. 

My grandmother had the best lemon bars in the world. They're what I compare all others to, but couldn't find her recipe so I found this one. If I find hers I'll probably figure out where this one falls a bit short for me.

Perfectly tart and sweet. Instead of squeezing two lemons, I used 1/2 cup of fresh lemon juice that I already had frozen. I would add a little more next time. It was a little too gooey and sticky the next day - best if eaten fresh.

I loved this recipe, the bars really are a perfect crust to filling ratio and it makes quite a lot. I took another reviewers advice and used 3 lemons plus some zest. It was too lemony, however my lemons were big. Next time I will follow the recipe. My only complaint is that cooking the crust for 15- 20 minutes then the additional cook time for the filling was too much. The crust was too browned and the filling dried out a bit. I recommend cutting down the bake times to 10(crust)  and 15 (after filling) minutes for a perfect bar.

We LOVED this... and I did not alter the recipe - I usually like to try it as written first, then I can tweak it next time if necessary.  I halved the recipe and divided it between 8 ramekins.  (I make desserts in ramekins primarily so I don't eat too much... but in this case, I think I ended up eating 4 of them over the course of a couple days.  Ha!)  The amount of crust vs. filling was perfect for me.  I thought I would need more filling, but it puffs up a little bit during baking, and ended up being just right.  Don't judge it too soon!  Since I didn't have lemons and had to use lemon juice, I did take the advice of a few others and used slightly more than what I think 2 lemons would've produced.  I used 3/8 of a cup for HALF a recipe - so 2/3 if you made the full recipe.  Yum!  Don't bother buying the box mixes.  This is super simple, and super yum!

I made these for my friend's birthday.
I decided do make a second batch and substitute lemon juice for lime juice and add food colouring.
Unfortunately, I baked the lemon bars in a glass pan and the lime bars in a metal pan. The lemon bars came out soupy, but the lime bars were fantastic! Thanks to this recipe, I'm sure everyone will be inviting me to their birthdays from now on ;D

I am in love! I actually made this recipe with gluten-free all-purpose flour and earth balance non-dairy butter and it still turned out perfect! I did use two more lemons than this recipe calls for. Also I cooked the crust for 34ish minutes and the filling with the crust for 14 minutes instead of the 20 it calls for. SO DELICIOUS! The only thing I wish is that they were taller, with the 9/13 pan, they come out a bit flat for my taste. Will use a smaller and taller pan next time.

I made these this weekend for a cook-out.  Everyone raved about them!  I did alter as suggested the recipe using 5 juiced lemons and the added 2 lemon zest.  I also did increase the bake time for the 2nd bake to 24 minutes.  Will be making these again.

Just made my first batch....they are REALLY GOOD!!  My husband and I just had a small taste because we are going to be eating dinner soon.  He really likes them alot, and I do too!  I'm sure as soon as my girls get home later, they will love them too!  I made them in an 8 1/2 x 11" glass pan, and increased the lemon juice to 2/3 of a cup and increased the flour (in the lemon mixture) to 1 tablespoon.  EXCELLENT!  Thank you for sharing!

I had never made or even eaten a lemon bar before! They turned out great! I added lemon zest to crust and a little extra flour and lemon juice to filling due to other reviews. It probably didn't need any altering. Can't wait to make them for gatherings next spring.

Just baked it. Excellent!! Didn't change a thing. Took other reviewers' advice. Baked it for exactly 20 minutes for the crust & another 20 minutes for both. It came out beautifully!! Thank you for the best lemon bars recipe!!

This recipe was wonderful.  I love lemon bars and it's taken me a few weeks to find the best one.  The trick wa to figure out how to cut down the sweetness.  I mixed the syrup for the lemon bars the whole time the crust was in the over and I cooked it a few minutes longer.  Not sure it it did anything at the time, but when it cooled off and started cutting the dish, it seemed as though the sweetness wasn't as powerful.  Thanx again.  We'll make this again and again.

I thought these were really good.  However, they weren't zesty enough for me.  I stuck to the recipie, and I even added a tablespoon of Lemon Juice, and threw lemon zest shavings on top.  Dont get me wrong, they did have lemon taste, but not the pucker like I usually like.

Increased to 2/3 cups lemon juice and added 1 more tablespoon of flour like another review said.  Came our very good, but next time I'm doubling the filling.

This is the my first time ever making lemon bars and I am very pleased overall with the results.  I did follow the recipe exactly except for the amount of lemon juice. "two lemons" is not clear enough, so like other reviewers I put in a total of 2/3 cups of fresh lemon juice and the zest of 1 lemon.  Crust of flaky and buttery and the filling tart enough to my liking.  The only thing I would do differently next time, is to double the filling as I would've like there to have been more filling.  Other than that, this is a great recipe!!

This recipe is really great.  The only thing I did different was instead of white sugar I used organic raw sugar and dusted the tops with powdered sugar.  They were a hit!

These are good, although I feel like in order to make this recipe better the crust should be thinned out a bit.  I also didn't feel like there is enough lemon flavor.

I've made lemon bars from several recipes over the years.  The buttery crust made as a base for this variation is the hands-down winner!  I agree with others - in addition to the lemon juice called for, I added the zest of both lemons for an extra kick of flavor.  Delicious!

I just made these following the recipe exactly.  They taste good, but I can see how more lemon would be better.  Next time I'll do as the other reviews suggest and add the juice of another lemon.

These are like the best lemon bars I've ever tasted! I made them for a potluck with a huge tray; and by the end all were gone except for three! These are also fairly easy to make, although I had to cook them a bit longer then it said to.

The lemon bars were pretty good. I  followed previous reviews and added a bit more (about 1/4cup) lemon juice. I rated 4 stars because the lemon layer was a bit thin. Since strawberries are in season right now, I thinly sliced a few of them and placed them on top  of 1/4 of the lemon layer before cooking.... MMMM MMM GOOD!!! Next time make this recipe I'm going to do this on more of the lemon bars.
thank you for sharing

I made 3 different lemon bar recipes and these were voted the favorite. I used frozen lemon juice the first time I made them and I didn't feel like they were lemony enough but this time I made them with two fresh lemons and they turned out just how I had hoped. This is the recipe I will use from now on.

The absolute best crust I have ever had on a lemon bar! I followed the recipe exactly except that I added much more lemon juice. Probably 2/3 cup. Although I truly would eat the crust all by itself any day of the week, nice and thick crust, thank goodness!

This recipe was very good, however, I used 3/4 cup lemon juice instead of fresh lemons (which I don't always have on hand) and it was amazing! I use again and again and never tire of it.

super yummy i made these gluten free by subbing the flour out for corn starch in the lemon filing and used pamelas pancake mix with some crushed almonds for the crust...truly the best g-free desert my non gluten free friends have had. My 3 kids loved them too!!!

These were great! I also used 2/3 cup lemon juice (zapped them for about 15 seconds in the microwave to get more juice - used 3 big lemons) and added an extra 1/3 cup of flour to compensate. I added a pinch of salt to the crust mixture. I ended up having to bake it for an extra 10 minutes or so (just the crust) - not sure if that is just my oven or not.

Amazing !! This is the first time I have ever made lemon bars. My husband loves them even though he does not like fruity desserts.  I have given 4 stars because I  used 2/3 cup of lemon juice + 2 lemons zest + 1 tbsp flour as suggested by one of the reviewers.  I will be making this over and over again ! :)  Thank you both the creator and the reviewer !!

These are awesome!  I love that the crust and the filling separate nicely.  I use at least twice, if not three times the amount of lemon juice and add an extra 1/4 c. flour to make up for the extra liquid.

I tried out this recipe because I seem to have temporarily lost my favorite recipe in our recent move and I saw all the great reviews. I was a little nervous when I saw some of the comments associated with the lower-rated reviews on this recipe (lack of lemon taste, mushy, not setting properly, etc) AFTER I had them baking in the oven!  I pulled them from the oven and tasted them right away while they were still hot just to reassure myself I wasn't going to be disappointed after they cooled and they were wonderful!  Now, crust is one of my favorite parts and I love the chewy edges of the lemon filling and this had both.  Maybe it's just a difference in tastes but I can't see how anybody could be disappointed with these bars unless they didn't follow the recipe exactly.  The kids didn't even wait for them to be all the way cooled and they were gone!

So much better than the stuff you make from a box, wow.  I can see how some people are overpowered by the taste of butter in these, but personally I consider that the best part!

Everyone loved this, couldn't get enough of it. I used 3/4 cup of lemon juice and lemon zest and the crust was very mummy but it was a lot for the filling, the second time I made this I divided the crust between 2 pans and double the filling that worked great. Also be sure to cool the crust before you add the filling. The best lemon squares I ever had!

it was okay, i followed the directions to 20 minutes for an additional baking time, it turned to a bit hard after cool, next time i am gonna try the additional baking time for 15 minutes, that should make the cake more soft. and also i added a bit lemon skin and more lemon juice, it tasted good.

I halved the recipe and made it in a 8x8 pan.  I used 1/2 cup lemon/lime juice combo.  Everything tasted really good but the topping was too thin compared to the crust.  I will try doubling the topping next time.  I was going to take these to work for a BBQ but ended up making something else.

Turned out really well. Was a huge hit with my parents and relatives. I was using a much smaller pan, so I cut the ingredients in half and it still turned out well. Also, I added in the zest of a lemon. Really yummy. Highly recommended. ^^

Yes, these are exceptional. I did as suggested, increase the lemon juice to 2/3 cup along with the 1 T. flour increase. Cooked them in an 11X8 pyrex dish but next time I will use the 9X13 as the crust was too think for my taste.

these were good, but I found it somewhat hard to ration it out. I made the crust to thick and it was dry on its own, but when it combined with the filling it was nice and chewy. I will make this again!

This recipe was absolutely heavenly. They were simple and completely delicious. The only qualm I had was that the crust did not take 20 minutes to bake to be "firm and golden" before pouring on the lemon mixture. It took perhaps twice that, or a bit less than that. I used a suggestion of using 2/3 cup lemon juice and 1/3 cup flour for the lemon mixture. PERFECT. I can't stop eating these.

Yummy!  Doubled the filling and they came out great!  Also (inadvertently) used only 1 stick of butter and the crust was just fine!  Thank you for sharing!

I used Cherie's custom version of this recipe so I would highly recommend that.  I'm just rating here because this was the base used for her recipe so this one deserves credit.  The crust turned out flakey and the filling is nice and tart!  They only sat for about 30mins in the fridge before serving and this was perfect. Thanks so much for this lovely recipe! They're pretty and taste great! :)

I loved these bars!  The only change that I made was to use 3 large lemons as a few others had suggested. I'm glad that I did. The sweetness/tartness  was perfect and the lemon layer was balanced very nicely by the yummy shortbread base.  I made these for a friend but my husband doesn't like lemon so I had to take the remainder  to work the next day or I would have eaten these by myself for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  They were that good. One big recommendation is to use parchment paper  with the ends extending beyond the edge of the pan.  It made removing them a snap. It would have been impossible to present nice squares otherwise. Also wipe the  knife blade between cuts to have a more attractive serving.

I had never made lemon bars before, I needed something sweet for my boyfriend's birthday, so after seeing Lemon bar recipes I tried several. 2 of them (also on this site) were thrown out. This recipe was the best of 3-These are delightful! I made these, and had to immediately make another batch. They are easy, they are delicious, he said they were amazing! Not an easy feat- he is pretty picky!

Tried using confectioner's sugar for the crust...No baking powder for the filling? didn't rise at all so crust turned out much thicker than the filling. Otherwise, perfect taste!

I had to bake my crust for about 25 minutes- but they were the best ever!  I followed the advice of another reviewer and used 2/3 C of fresh lemon juice and they were wonderful.  I'm making more tomorrow!

These were delicious! I added 1/4 cup extra lemon juice to give them more flavor, though, or else it wouldn't have been enough. The crust/filling ratio is perfect, however

These lemon bars were delicious!  I also added the juice of 1 extra lemon and the zest also.  I guess it depends on how juicy your lemons are.

filling needs to be doubled in order to have a nice thicknes to it.  I added yellow color to them as well.  Taste is very good.

I make this recipe ALL the time now.  I usually add an extra 1/4 cup of sugar to the crust and an extra tablespoon of bottled lemon juice to the "filling" just because I like a sweeter crust and tangier filling.  But this recipe is phenomenal and I always get many compliments. And it's SO easy.

I made these in a smaller pan (11 x 7).  My crust was too thick and dry.  I take responsiblity due to changing the pan size, however I didn't feel that I had excess filling.  The filling was as thick as the crust.  The flavor of the filling was really good.  If I make these again I would use the same pan, 1/2 the crust and make the filling as the recipe calls for.  Then I think it would be 5 stars due to the ratio of filling & crust would be perfect!

These were okay. The crust seemed a little too buttery and I will probably add more lemon and cut back on the sugar and butter the next time. Although I wasn't much of a fan, my family loved them!

Wow....so good! Buttery and flaky crust. And I added 2/3 cup lemon juice plus 1 tab of flour, as per another review, for extra tartness. Sooo good, exactly what I wanted.

This is for sure an amazing and easy to follow recipe! I have made them several times for work and family parties and they have been a hit.  I definitely follow the suggestions of using more lemon juice (typically 2/3 cup) and always add some lemon zest to the top prior to putting it in the oven. The best lemon bars for sure.

It was a fantastic recipe and extremely easy to follow! I used a lemon and a lime plus some zest from both. Which made it all the better. Next time I will probably try lemon, lime, and orange. My sister-in-laws aunt made the lemon bars with all three and the taste was amazing! I just didnt have an orange. I did also add some salt into the crust recipe like some others suggested.

These are fantastic!! It was my first time making lemon bars, and I will make this recipe many times in the future. The only change I made was to double the lemon mixture per other reviews...they turned out with the perfect lemon layer to crust ratio. Thanks for the great recipe!

I always make a recipe twice before adding my thoughts however this one doesn't make the grade. The crust and the top came out both times rubbery, but the birds didn't mind so much.

I made this recipe as described but put it all into an 8x8-inch glass baking dish. Perfect! The crust was just the right thickness and the filling was was a good thickness, too - not too shallow as it would have been in a larger pan. The perfect bite. I made these for my granddaughter who LOVES lemon bars and she gave it two enthusiastic thumbs up.

This recipe is excellent, I followed it to the tee. Just follow the directions as stated in the recipe and you will have nice lemon bars.  I dusted mine with powdered sugar and then I cut them into squares.

delicious! I added 1/2 cup lemon juice (three whole lemons) instead of the recommended 2/3 cup and added lemon zest inside custard before baking. I also added an additional 1 tbs of flour to reach the desired thickness. I added the rest of the zest to the top after dusting with powdered sugar and allowing it to cool. Also, the crust needed a total of 25 minutes to bake in order to reach that gorgeous golden brown color

Very tasty! I've made these 4 times already. The one thing I would suggest is to zest one of the lemons for the lemon mixture-- It definitely gives it more of a lemon taste.

I made these bars exactly as the recipe stated & they were pretty darn good.  Next time I might take some of the advice and add in more lemon.  As with most bars, these tasted the best about 2 days after I actually made them. My only complaint is that I had a hard time with cutting them because the topping kept trying to seperate from the shortbread.  Thanks for sharing!  :)

Like some of the other reviewers, I added a bit more lemon. I used the lemon zest of two lemons and 2.5 T bottled lemon juice. I added 1 T extra flour and the bars were FABULOUS!!

I followed the directions almost exactly except my 2 lemons yielded less than 1/2 cup of juice but I had some key limes on hand and managed to get a little more than 1/2 cup. Since I used limes, it was tart enough and I didn't need to add more flour to compensate.    I was disappointed when I took it out of oven because the top was white or opaque, almost cake like.  However, when I cut into it, OH MY!  It was delicious and it was jelly in the middle!  I burned my mouth a few times.  I totally forgot to spray pam on the pan but at least I know why one reviewer said they enjoyed eating the crust so much!  It's unbelievable good! Every part of the it!

I followed the recipe exactly and the filling seemed to absorb into the crust more than I would have like. Next time I'll follow the other reviews and cook the crust longer and allow it to cool. Maybe that will help. And I would agree that it needs more lemon. I'll try it again though.

I used this recipe as a base. I added a 1/4 cup more sugar to the crust and another tablespoon to the filling. I used the juice of 3 lemons, plus the zest of 2 lemons. These things rocked the house. They didn't last long. Very tangy. Also, add a sprinkle of powdered sugar while they're cooling. The cooking time for the crust along was about 5 minutes longer for my oven.

For the first time that I've ever made these, they turned out great. My co-workers loved them!  I would recommend whisking the eggs separately before you add them to the dry ingredients.

I didn't know lemon bars could taste this good! I added the juice of two and a half lemons. The crust is simply buttery goodness with the lemon flavor.

Great recipe. I kept the same amount of sugar and added a cream cheese top layer (16 oz cream cheese, 2 eggs, 2/3 c sugar). I also added 3/4 cup real lemon juice. It came out perfect. I think without the cream cheese layer, the filling should be doubled. It was thinner than the crust, but with the cream cheese it was great.

These came out perfect.  I halved the recipe and added a pinch of salt to the crust.  I ended up using 1/2cup of lemon juice and added an extra TBS of flour to the filling.  Let the crust cool for about 15min before you pour the filling on top.  My girls didn't like them, but that just means more for me and my husband :)

Delicious recipe! (with a few changes).  I added extra 1 tbsp flour to filling and used the juice of 3 lemons.  Not too sweet and not too tart.  Once you make this, you will never look for another lemon bar recipe.  I definitely will be making this one again.

Made this dessert for a suprise party and everyone ate them up and wanted more! I didn't have real lemons to sqeeze for the juice so I used almost a 1/2 cup of "RealLemon" juice you can buy at the store. They probably weren't as lemony as they should have been but still tasted great!

These are quite good!  Per other reviewers' suggestions, I added 1/3 cup flour to the filling.  I also added 3/4 cup of lime juice.  It was the right amount of lemon flavor.  I think I'll make it again.

JUST FABULOUS!  I got this recipe years ago from a friend and I just love it!  Only a few small differences - I add 1/4 tsp. of salt to the base and use 2 cups of sugar and 1/2 tsp. baking powder in the lemon filling.  In a pinch, I've found that 7 tablespoons of bottled lemon juice will work.  These are so rich and luscious, everyone always enjoys them.

I loved it!  The 2nd time I made it it put a 1/4 of toasted finely chopped almonds in the crust.  I also added some of the zest to the filling.  I have brought this dish to several events this year and everyone asks for the recipe.

Heavenly! I made my bars in an 8x11 glass pan that I've had forever. It's an odd size, but I've actually used it many times.I've made lemon bars before with a similar recipe that I can't seem to find. They've always went over sooo well. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious and easy to make.  There is a hint of eggyness to these, but they turn out fabulous.  The crust is beautiful next to the lemon. They look very appetizing, too.

The best! And this crust is such a great crust. I've used it for cheesecakes and tarts and everyone raves about them. Sometimes I add some crushed up graham crackers to it.

These are delicious as written!  Excellent recipe Patty.  Now having said that here's what I experienced.  I had two very large juicy lemons.  Probably juice equal to the amount of 3 normal sized lemons.  Unfortunately I did not measure, just squoze into the mixing bowl.  So you'll have to trust me.  I added 1 extra T flour to compensate.   I grated some of the zest into the crust and into the custard.  Very good!!!!  This will be my go to recipe for lemon bars!!

The shortcake crust and the lemony taste is perfect. I served it at a dinner party and got lots of complement. I followed the suggests from some of the reviews, used 1/3cup of flour for filling and zest from 1 lemon. However I had to extend the baking time to 40min. to make the filling settle. Will make it again though.

Amazing! My family and I really enjoyed these. I'm serving them at our Father's Day picnic tomorrow and know they'll be a hit. I followed some commentors' advice and upped the flour a bit so I could use 2/3 cup lemon juice. It's strong and lemony! MMM!

How can you go wrong with a pile of butter and sugar? These were delicious empty calories. I too used 2/3 cup of lemon juice and about a tablespoon of the zest.

This is my new favorite lemon bar recipe. The only thing I did different was use six eggs, 2 1/4 cups of sugar, 1/2 cup of flour, and probably about 1/2 cup of fresh lemon juice.  1 1/2 times the measurements called for.  Excellent!

Very good lemon bars, I always use three lemons, reduce the sugar to just one cup and throw in a tsp of lemon extract. For the crust(since the recipe makes too much crust) you can always half the recipe, or make a full batch and freese the other half for next time.

OH MY GOODNESS... The name fits this recipe perfectly. This is truly the BEST lemon bar. Per other reviewers I used 2/3 cup of lemon juice and the zest of two lemons. I also added an extra tablespoon of flour to the lemon juice mixture. I baked the crust for 20 minutes and the filling for 25 minutes.I sprinkled powder sugar over the top while they were hot so it would stick. Came out PERFECT, set up very nicely and easy to get out of the pan. Look no futher for a great lemon bar recipe!!

I think this a good basic recipe but when I made my own I used the juice of three large lemons as well as the zest from two of the lemons. I liked the crust but the ratio of crust to filling was too much. I think next time I make these I will double the filling and keep the crust as it is.

Listened to other reviewers and used about 2/3 cup lemon juice as well as a teensy bit extra sugar in the crust. I can see how this would make for really thin bars in a 9x13 pan. I used an 8x8 and reduced the amount of crust. Also added zest to the filling. Came out beautiful! My boyfriend loves them!  Also I used a silicone baking dish and just peeled it back and slid the whole thing free, worked like a charm.

Really really tasty!  I went with them because there was too much disagreement in the comments for the other lemon bar recipe on this site. I'm glad I did. I used two lemons (I think I drained every last drop of juice out of them) and the zest on both.  (ZEST BEFORE YOU JUICE!) My only qualm was that the crust was a pain to get out neatly on the edge, and the crust could have used a tiny bit of salt for flavor. Perhaps the submitter assumed we were using salted butter?

This is the best recipe! The only thing I deviated from was the amount of lemon juice. I used a 4oz. bottle of lemon juice. The lemon flavor is perfect. Nice and soft. Yummy!

Excellent lemon bars. I followed the recipe exactly except that I substituted 1/2 cup lemon juice for the 2 lemons since I didn't have fresh lemons sitting around. I also added a 1/2 tsp of lemon extract to make sure it was plenty lemony since other reviewers had recommended lemon zest.  It was great served with whipped cream and a little candied lemon peel sprinkled on top!

I rated this a 4 only b/c I did not follow recipe exactly.  Per other reviewers, I added 2/3 cup lemon juice and the zest of 2 lemons b/c we like it more tart.  Also added an extra T of flour.  Other than that, everything was the same.  My hubby really likes it b/c it's not too sweet.

I made these lemon bars with 2/3 lemon, zest of one lemon, and they still were not lemony enough for me.  Also, the crust is a bit much - very dense and overwhelming.  I'm going to continue hunting for a better lemon bar.  That being said, I took them to a party and they were gone in minutes.

I would have given this recipe five stars, except that it took about 35 minutes to bake the crust, not the 15-20 listed.

Otherwise, I used mexican limes (key limes) instead of lemons since I had a bunch. As others suggested, I used the zest from one and about 3/4 cup of the juice. 
They tasted great.

This was truly awesome. Since I like mine tart, I used 3 lemmons and about a teaspoon more flour to the lemmon mixture. Additionally, I added a pinch of salt to the shortbread mixture. Unbelievably good.  Just had a bunch of people over and served it. Everyone loved it and wanted to take some to go! Many liked it kind of tart like me, but you'll need to decide that for yourself! Definitely a winner.

I have made lemon bars every year at holiday time, trying a new recipe each year with little success, that is until this year, with this recipe.  Most other years my bars are over-done around the edges and under-done in the middle.  One year we ate the "bars" with a spoon.  This recipe was fantastic, perfectly done all over.  I quess I had super large lemons, because I ended up with 3/4 cup lemon juice.  I did not adjust the flour for the filling, and still these came out perfect.  The only change I would make next time is to increase the sugar in the filling a little, or decrease the lemon juice to 1/2 cup.  The larger amount of lemon juice made these a tad too tart for my husband's taste.  
I'm so glad I finally found a recipe and I can now toss out all the others I have accummulated over the years.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I've made so many lemon bar recipes, since I love them so much. This recipe is absolutely the best one I've ever made. The balance of flavors between tart and sweet is perfect. The custard consistancy is creamy, not too stiff or soft. I made small changes suggested by SeattleMommy that included larger juice amount and added zest and salt. Results were divine.

Great lemon bars.  The only thing I did differently was add the zests of both lemons to the filling (why waste them?).  I love the crust--perfectly sweet to compliment the tart lemon.

Absolutely Fantastic! I followed the suggestions of another reviewer to add more lemon juice and some zest. (I used 3 smallish sized lemons and the zest of one of them.) Super easy and quick to make and  totally DELICIOUS!!!

This was my first attempt at making Lemon Bars and they turned out very tasty.  I do think they needed more lemon though, so I'll up that next time.  The crust was PERFECT, though.

Delicious, buttery shortbread crust makes all the difference in this recipe. I made 1 1/2 of the crust to make an extra thick layer and doubled the lemon mixture as well!

The lemon taste is great, I wasn't crazy about the thin layer of scrambled egg scum on top of the lovely lemon.  I sprinkled a ton of powdered sugar on top - but still! These are rich! Don't plan on gorging, you'll end up with a belly ache like me.

I've always been intimidated by lemon bars, even the boxed ones, they never set and are mushy.  These really ARE the BEST Lemon Bars!  I don't see how as written it would work in a 9X13 pan though.  I used a nonstick 8X8 pan and they were perfect.  I love the shortbread bottom.  I did use 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice and an extra tbs flour in the lemon mixture.  I think because I had a dark pan, the cookie part burnt slightly on the top edges, but no biggie it still tastes amazing.  Mine set up perfectly and have the perfect lemon zing.  Even my non sweet eating b/f tried one and said they were really good.  Love them, thank you!

Very yummy!!  I used 2/3 cup bottled lemon juice and added 1 extra TBL flour.  Baked crust 20 min and filling 25 minute.  Will definitely keep this recipe.  Next time will try a glaze on top.

these are my first lemon bars and they are fantastic. I did the extra lemon juice (from a bottle) and the extra T of flour. I made them yesterday and stored leftovers in a container on the counter and today they are soggy. that's my only complaint.

I don't know what I did wrong with these ?  Made as written, and the taste was great.  The bars just never really set right for and they were goopy . . . wouldn't be able to serve these.

This is a wonderful recipe! I doubled the recipe because I was making dinner for 30 people. Everyone loved it! It was sweeter than I expected and I didn't even add the powdered sugar on top. The crust was a little too soft for me so next time I'll try to reduce the butter a bit.

This is a fanatastic recipe! It has a great taste, and the texture is amazing.
      I would deffinately use 2/3 of a cup of lemon juice, and add an exta tablespoon of flour to the lemon mixture. If you decide to use margarine instesd of butter you may have to bake the crust a little longer than the recipe says.

Mmmmm. I just made these and it's hard not to eat them all up.  I used the juice of 3 lemons (1/2 cup) and I also used an 8X8 pan (increased baking time slightly). Everything else was as written. Very easy. I cut mine into 1 inch squares and since I used the 8X8 pan they are nice thick little lemony bites. It's for a working lunch and I don't want to make people fat, just brighten their day with a bite of lemon!

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I used the juice of three lemons instead of two (I prefer my lemon bars slightly  on the tart side); otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly. I added a little powdered sugar on top of the bars (for appearance more than taste).  Highly recommended!

I usually make the "Lemon Square Bars" from this site, but I chose to make this recipe as I didn't have powdered sugar for the crust.  The regular sugar worked perfectly.  After juicing two lemons and preparing the filling, I realized that the filling would not be enough volume and tart enough for my liking, so I used the other recipe's measurements and they were fabulous!  Some lemons just arent as juicy as others, so a specific amount will help to have perfect squares all the time!

I did make several amendments to the recipe following other reviewers ( and I did about 1/2 to 2/3 of the required amount of sugar since I didn't want it to be too sweet and not enough lemon, and I put in some lemon zest) But the bottom crust was far too thick in proportion to the lemon filling - it was really basically just a very chewy shortbread with a very thin lemon topping.  Disregarding texture and appearance, however, the taste wasn't too bad, but not really so amazing that I would double the filling just to perfect it - it's not worth eight eggs.

Used 3 lemons (2/3 cup juice) and a little rind and it was a good tartness.  They did not keep well though, the crust became very soggy even the next day...

I increased the cooking time for the crust by about 5 min, and increased the lemon juice to nearly 3/4 cup.  Needless to say, this yielded a VERY tart lemon bar!  I really like lemon, so it was no problem.  Next time, I'll probably decrease the amount of juice.  The crust was very nice, and held up well--the custard didn't sink in at all.

This was my first attempt at lemon bars and was very happy with the results.  I used 1/2 C. fresh lemon juice and found it to be nice and lemony, without being tart or sour.  The only complaint was that I did not have a distinct line between my crust and the lemon custard.  The custard wasn't visually distinct like I wanted, but the flavor and consistancy was great.  Maybe I should have let the crust cool more.

Overall though, the crust was buttery (I used salted butter) and pleasantly dense, the custard was smooth and lemony, and the overall result was very nice.

My first attempt at lemon bars... and it was a complete disaster!  The only thing I can think of that might have turned this ugly is the use of parchment paper under the crust in a glass Pyrex baking dish.  In the middle of baking, I checked on them to make sure they weren't getting too brown.... and the crust had floated to the top!  The parchment was somewhere in the middle, with lemon filling above and below it.  What a waste and what a a mess!  I did cook it through, just in case it could be salvaged, but it was a goner.  I tasted a small piece minus the paper, and it would have been great had the crust stayed where it was supposed to....

the lemon topping soaked right into the crust. I followed directions to a 'T'. All there is now is a crust with a vague taste of lemon.

One more comment, I would not use salt in the crust if you are using salted butter. I used salted butter and it tasted perfect.

I'm never going to buy a lemon bar mix again!  The fresh lemon and made-from-scratch crust come together to make a refreshing dessert that is worth the little extra effort.

These are VERY good and I am a very picky cook! I did cheat a little, and made a couple of changes. First, I used a pie crust mix and added some sugar to it, then pressed into a pie plate and baked. I used butter-flavored cooking spray on the pie plate. I used bottled lemon juice, and added extra, so it came to about 1/2 cup. Now, we love lemon flavor. For those who don't like the sweet tart, don't use extra lemon. I baked for closer to 25 minutes, let cool, and then dusted with powdered sugar before cutting. Keep in mind that these really need to be stored in the refrigerator. They are fabulous! Hubby and kids loved them and so did I! This recipe is a keeper!

Great lemon bars!  I do add the zest from both lemons to make it just a bit better.  Great flavor and very easy to make.

An excellent and simple recipe. I'll be using this again and again. I cooked the crust for 20 minutes but it could have done with 3/4 more. This is excellent with a cup of tea for an afternoon treat or as a dessert.

I am impressed! I added 1/4 tsp. of salt to the crust as suggested by other members. I also added 1 tsp. lemon zest (from a jar) and some yellow food coloring to the filling. I used 1/2 cup of fresh lemon juice, and it was a little bit too tart for me. Next time, I'll try using 1/3 cup. The crust was beautiful. The bars were even better after they were refrigerated. My husband loved them so much, he wants to eat them for breakfast!

I had never made homemade lemon bars before so I tried this recipe.  Let me tell you, the box lemon bars don't stand a chance with these.  You can taste all of the wonderful fresh ingredients.  Make sure you use only this recipe when making lemon bars, they turn out perfect.

I made these for Easter, and they were so so good! Use real butter for a flaky crust. I added a couple Tablespoons more lemon juice & also about 2 tsp. grated zest because I really love that lemon flavor, these totally delivered. After giving the finished bars a good dusting of powder sugar, I topped with plenty of toasted coconut. Try these!

I tried this recipe on my quest for the perfect lemon bar. It was good, but I would have liked more filling. The quest continues....

These were really good! i didnt have lemons so i added 6 tablespoons of lemon juice and an extra tablespoon of flour just to thicken it just a bit. They came out perfectly and i dusted some powdered sugar on top so they looked beautiful!

This was ok - very good taste, but consistency was not very good. I made it 3 different times trying to adjust for the softness and could not get it to come out right. If you don't mind the softness (to the point it falls apart with bars in the center of the dish) it is good.

I'm sorry but I really was not a fan of these at all.  I used more lemon juice as others recommended, but still the filling didn't seem to have much flavor at all.    My husband ate a few of these, but I ended up throwing the whole plate away.
