Very delicious,  very easy to prepare,  I used only California chilies,  my tip is to let mixture marinade overnight with the meat,  I used chuck roast beef, if you do that your Birria will be full of flavor, for the mixed spices I used black pepper, ground cumin, dry oregano, ground ginger and a little piece of cinnamon .

My family loved this! I needed a dinner I could prepare in the morning and then let it cook itself, so I did it in a crock pot on high for 5 hours. I used a chuck roast instead of stew meat. I sprinkled kosher salt on the roast and let it rest while I prepared the chilis. I used 5 pasilla, 5 guajillo, and 2 arbol which gave it good flavor while keeping it mild enough for my kids. I also added 4 cloves of garlic along with the onion and then salt to taste. Probably about a tablespoon, plus what was already sprinkled on the meat. It was plenty salty and next time I will use less. For spices, I followed other review recommendations and did a tsp of each cumin, pepper, Mexican oregano. Plus a tiny pinch of cinnamon. Hubby says clove is also common but easy to overdo; I didn’t use any this time.  Served on warm corn tortillas with chopped onion and cilantro and a squeeze of lime. Some sliced radishes along side.  Will make this again! All 6 family members enjoyed, even the picky ones!

This is my second time making this. First time was too much salt.  When I boiled peppers I used beef broth instead of water and added a half a onion a couple cloves of garlic. For seasoning I added 1 tsp cumin, pepper, and oregano, and added 2 tsp of salt..... came out perfect!!!

After chilling overnight, I placed in a Dutch Oven for 3 hours at 300 degrees.  Meat was very tender.  Will make again and again.

Recommend beef or goat... or lamb shanks.  DO NOT USE 1/4 CUP SALT... use 1 tablespoon.  Been using the sauce as a marinade, dip and BBQ sauce.... especially as a BBQ sauce.

Made it with the exact same ingredients except i used 1/8 cup of salt instead of 1/4 i felt that it was a bit much salt also I used 2 tablespoons from a mixed spiced package a bit of cumin and a small amount from a cinnamon stick as well as oregano. It was really test to taste which came out awesome! This seemed like the only good recipe i could find online.

Fabulous recipe.  I used only 1 tablespoon salt and added garlic because we love garlic.  Easily doubled or tripled.  You'll want left overs! Thanks for a great recipe.

This was delicious. We love onion and garlic so I added more. I also used 1 tsp pepper, 1 tsp oregano and 1 tsp cumin for seasoning. My sauce came out salty so I added 2 tomatoes to try reduce the saltiness. I will definitely be making this again but will be reducing the salt.
