I have to say this recipe as it stands is not good.  It's very watery and not nearly sweet enough as I've noticed most reviewers comment on.  Sorry Earla.

That being said, I think I managed to perfect it.  I made it in a half batch with the following measures:
1-1/2 C Hershey's Cocoa Powder
3 C Powdered Sugar
5 C Powdered Milk
1 C Powdered Creamer (I find Borden's is the best)

To make some fab modifications that will really knock their socks off, try adding 2 tsp ground cinnamon to the mix for Mexican Hot Chocolate.

Or for a more festive variety, reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup, then powder 12 candy canes in the blender and add into the mix for a nice Candy Cane Cocoa!  My husband loves this one so much, I can't seem to get any out for gifts!

Just a note...this is a super recipe, but you will want to stick with the powdered sugar, only because it helps to make it thick and rich, and unless you use superfine sugar, white sugar will most likely end up at the bottom of the container  because it's heavier than all the other ingredients.
I added a bit more cocoa powder, and also added a jar of amaretto creamer to a batch, it was amazing!!  For a batch for the kids I added about a cup and a half more powdered sugar, and on another batch I added cinnamon sticks inside the containers I sent.  I have never had so many raves...this is a keeper, and one to definetly experiment with!!  :)

*Extra added Note*  I just made a new batch omitting one cup of the milk for 2 small containers of cinnamon creamer, and using 1 cup of nestles quick along with the cocoa (ok, so christmas is depleting my pantry a bit!) :) But it was so incredibly good that I decided to keep the whole batch for our family and go to the store to make a new one!!  One Last note, added in 2009, while making the cocoa last year, I found that making it all in a big kitchen trash bag made this SO much easier to mix...really, try it, you'll love it!!

I made 2 seperate batches of this mix with 2 different types of cocoa and they both came out very different. Surprisingly, Hershey's cocoa yielded a richer, more chocolatey cocoa (which in turn required more sugar) than the more expensive cocoa. This could be a reason why different people had different results. I rated this 4 stars because of the adjustments I made (increased cocoa to 2 cups, and sugar to 6. Added 1 tsp salt. I also used nonfat dry milk so I increased the cremora by 1/2 cup for a richer taste.) I also followed the suggestion of sifting my ingredients and grinding the dry milk to fine powder. Thta helped reduce the "mud" in the bottom of your cup and made for a creamier texture. In my opinion this compares to the mixes you buy from the store but I like the control over what you put in it. I made one batch with hazelnut creamer and that came out really good - tasted like the Landolakes version. Thanks for a versatile recipe! **new note added 12/3** I made a mocha flavored batch by adding 10 TBS instant coffe ground up, extra cup of sugar and cremora each and 1/2 tsp dried vanilla powder and it was a big hit!

O.K, I read other reviews and tweeked this a little, first off I ran the powdered milk through the food processor to make it powdery fine. used two cups of cocoa and increased the powdered sugar to 6 cups. We ended up with a yummy, creamy cocoa without the funny powdered milk taste hat makes you want to add Nestlies Quick, or just use the store seuff in the first place.

I’ve made this recipe before following the listed recipe precisely and it is fine, but not the best. This time I substituted Hershey’s Special Dark cocoa powder for regular cocoa powder. The taste was much more rich and chocolatey. It reminded me of what you’d buy at an expensive coffee shop. The dark cocoa powder bumps the recipe up to 5 stars in my book!

I altered this recipe slightly and I LOVE it! I use a large plastic punch bowl to mix in...you really need a BIG bowl and this works perfectly. I use 10 cups milk powder, 6 cups powdered sugar, 2 cups cocoa powder, 1 3/4 cups "Royale" Cremora, 2 envelopes of Stephens sipping cocoa mix, and 1 bag of mini-marshmallows. It makes 8 pint jars. Because of the marshmallows, you need to "tap" the jar to take out air pockets. I make a nice variation using 2 1/2 tsp. of Cinnamon with an extra 1/2 cup powdered sugar. I call it "Gourmet Christmas Cocoa". I decorate the top with fabric and raffia, add a cute tag and sell these jars at Craft Fairs for $4.50 each. Actual cost works out to about $1.80 per jar, but the jar itself is the most expensive. I use Penzeys Vietnamese Cinnamon and Penzeys Dutch Process Cocoa Powder. Thanks for a fabulous base recipe! I may try regular granulated sugar as most powdered sugars have cornstarch in them. Have a look at the confectioners sugar box next time you see one in the store. Thanks again...this is wonderful! :0)

Thanks so much for the Hot Cocoa recipe and everyone's ideas.  I also added more Hot Cocoa to make it more chocolately.   You really do need a BIG bowl to mix this all up in...I first tried to mix it between 2 large bowls but that didn't work so well because I thought I was done and then realized I still had to add all the Sugar! So what I did was use our large Stockpot and mix everything in there.  That worked Great!   
A quick note on the Milk.  I purchased a box of the powdered milk that said it had TEN One Quart Envelopes in it.  I was thinking I would have plenty of powder.  What it actually means is that each envelope MAKES a Quart and each package actually had one cup of powered milk.  I was very lucky and had the exact amount needed.      ***Also as far as packaging this up,  what I did was buy some mugs from the dollar store, put enough for 2 cups in small bags (like another person already suggested) and then tied a candy cand and a nib of peppermint schnapps to it.  These make Great inexpensive gifts!

Very good cocoa recipe, but needed more chocolate flavor for us.  We added quite a bit more cocoa to the recipe.  It was very good with that addition.  Thanks!

I made 2 batches of this for holiday gifts.  I increased the powdered sugar in the second recipe and found the flavor to be much more pleasing.  Yum!

I use a 10 qt container of powdered milk, 1 2# Nestle Quik no sugar added, 22 oz. dry coffee creamer and 1/2 C. powdered sugar.  I have made this for 45 years and it's the number 1 request for a Christmas gift for all my grandchildren.  Not counting all the times in between.  This is a similar recipe but no measuring just empty full containers.  1/3 C. mix for a coffee mug.  Add hot water or coffee.  MMMMM.

Not sure 5 stars is right because of all the modifications ... but here goes.  I followed someone else's suggestion.. a full bag of pow sugar, a full tin of cocoa and 2 1/4 cup creamer (1 cup french vanilla, 1 1/4 cup regular).  I also put in the food processor to mix -and this made it very smooth - it dissolved quickly.  It will make great gifts!! Thanks for the starting point & lots of suggestions from others! Enjoy!

This is the beginnings of great cocoa.
 My family always uses Nestle Choc milk powder, non-dairy creamer, powdered sugar and powdered milk. 
 I have found that you need to buy the best you can get, i.e. brand names, or the best tasting to you, ingredients. Especially of the powdered milk. Personally we like the milkman or carnation brands. I would NOT buy store brand, unless you like it. 
 Also, this recipe needs to be adjusted for personal sweet, chocolate and creaminess taste. Write it down once you've got it, because you will never want to go back to packets again! 
 Oh, and don't skimp on the mix to water or milk ratio. Enjoy! :-)

This is the best hot cocoa mix I have ever had.  I did follow the recommendations from the other post.  I made it in a half batch with the following measures: 1-1/2 C Hershey's Cocoa Powder 3 C Powdered Sugar 5 C Powdered Milk 1 C Powdered Creamer.  I will be keeping this on hand always.  No more packages for me.

I also tweaked the recipe... made it in my FOOD PROCESSOR (love that thing!)  Here is the winning combination:  4 cups dry milk, 2 cups of the Cinnamon Vanilla Coffee Mate, 1-1/4 unsweetened cocoa powder, 1-1/4 regular white sugar, and since it was a cinnamon flavor I did add 2 tsp of a really good cinnamon!  VOILA!  Perfect for hostess gifts or for our friends!  We all enjoy it and I didn't find it too sweet this way!

*****I used a large baking bag to mix the ingredients in instead of a bowl. (the kind you can roast a turkey in). MUCH easier to toss and flop it around to ensure thorough mixing, can also feel the texture through the bag and smooth out any lumps. 

For gift giving, I put the mix in a food-safe bag and then settle that into a cellophane party favor bag, or a small standard gift bag works too. A small fraction of the cost of mason jars!

This recipe is very easy, the flavor and texture are perfect. Adding flavored non-dairy powdered creamer is a great idea - tastes and smells great!

The finished product is something to be proud of :)

I followed a few suggestions and I think this is now an excellent recipe. I sifted the milk powder to ensure there would be no clumps. I increased the powdered sugar to 7 cups and used vanilla non-dairy creamer. We crushed peppermints and layered the chocolate mix, peppermints and marshmallows and gave these out as gifts to my dd cross country friends. If you are going to layer this, put a piece of parchment in between the layers if you want it to look asthestically pleasing. i wish I had thought of this prior to assembling all those jars.

I wanted something "homemade" for a personal touch for close friends and family.  I used amaretto creamer.  It turned out sort of bland, so I took the other reviewers' advice and doubled the cocoa.  I also added about 50% more sugar (I think hot cocoa should be sweet).  When I sampled it, I thought it needed a bit more mix, so I'd recommend 1/2 cup mix to 3/4 cup boiling water.  But maybe that's just me.  I'll definately use this recipe again, but I think it needs some "tweaking".

As is, I find it a little bland for my taste. An extra 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, 1/4 cup of cocoa powder, 1 1/2 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. cinnamon did wonders for it in my house - we can't get enough.

Just got done making this and it is so good! I took advice of others and ran the milk powder through my food processor - worked great. I also increased sugar to 5 1/2 cups (was afraid to make it to sweet) and since a lot of people said it wasn't chocolaty enough used 1c. unsweetened hershey's and 1c. special dark hershey's cocoa and I think it is just right. Since I had to sift the sugar (1c. at a time) I sifted the cocoa as well and the end result is extremely smooth no clumps at all it was worth the extra time which really wasn't all that muchI also used the whole container of creamer since it was 15oz (no need to measure). Also WARNING: make sure you use a stock pot or larger! i used my stock pot to mix and the whole time wishing i had something bigger it makes a TON.  Can't wait to try with different flavored creamers- this time I used cinnamon vanilla.

My confectioners sugar doesn't dissolve well in this. My first batch was too watery & not nearly chocolate enough. So for the next batch I used half the milk & kept all the other proportions the same. The creamer and milk together make a nice thick texture when the proportions are right.

I had to adjust the recipe a couple times after testing the mix (THANK YOU to other reviewers!!), but was able to come up with something pretty yummy.  I ended up using a whole bag of powdered sugar and a whole tin of cocoa powder, and increased the creamer to 2 1/4 cups.  I think I'll try a flavored creamer next time... maybe a French Vanilla or something to make it a little richer.

For coworkers' Christmas gifts, I filled tins with the mix and packed a coordinating mug, as well as some chocolate dipped candy cane stirrers - you get an extra shot of chocolate and a hint of mint!

Before trying this mix, I was a religious Swiss Miss drinker.  This mix has beaten the Swiss Miss without question.  It is the best hot chocolate you'll ever drink.  It is so creamy and delicious that you'll keep wanting more.

Very good! I bought 50 small Christmas canning jars with handles and added this mix with an instruction card for my employees. They all loved it! Very rich.

Very good hot cocoa.  After I had mixed up the ingredients I put it in the blender (2 batchs) and stirred it to smooth out the lumps from the dry milk.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a very good base to start from. As opposed to some other reviewers I found that the mix was too watery. I added another 2 cups of powdered milk and another cup of creamer and it was rich and flavorful.

It was good. But not to much different than store bought. and MUCH more expensive to make rather than buy. The dry milk (at least around me) is $13 a box.

This is similar to a recipe I used to make years ago.  I did pour in a whole container of dark chocolate cocoa though instead of 1 3/4 cups.  I added some mini chocolate chips.  Everyone loves it!  I didn't blend anything or put it through the processor, it still works great.

Ive used this recipe for years..increase the powdered sugar and I've also used Hersheys Special dark cocoa..I agree it makes it richer...another suggestion is adding mini-chocolate chips ( they melt with hot water!) for the families with little ones...and Ive added a vanilla bean to mix!! Yum! I Have ALWAYS used a new kitchen trash bag...twist it shut and flip around until well mixed....its the only way mess-free way to combine..

I thought it was a very good recipe. It doesn't make very much and powdered milk is expensive. I don't know if it is that much better than store bought to make it worth the price. I like this recipe because it is a dry mix and can be stored and used later. I thought it would be good for my large crowd at Christmas but like I said, it only made about 6 cups.

Decadent hot chocolate mix--especially if you follow a few other reviewer's suggestions. Definitely put the powdered milk through the food processor--it makes all the difference. I increased the (Hershey)cocoa to 2 cups & used flavored non-dairy creamer, but left the powdered sugar the same.  (I do not care for super sweet.)  This made a rich, smooth cocoa that certainly gives the very expensive stuff a run for its money!  Thanks for sharing!

Thank you so much for this recipe.  It is exactly what I was looking for. What a great way to avoid store packaged products.  When we go backpacking we put a few scoops in a baggie and throw in some chocolate chips.  Thanks!

This is okay but I was hoping for something tasting a little more like the mix you can buy in the store.  I didnt think it was creamy enough so next time I will add another 1 3/4 cup of the creamer and reduce the powdered milk by that much.  I also didnt think it was quite sweet enough so I will also double the amount of powdered sugar.

Unlike some other reviewers, I did not need to make any adjustments to the sugar and cocoa proportions.  I used a high quality cocoa from the local Bread and Circus, and this seems to make a big difference.  Also, I did use Splenda instead of powdered sugar (4 3/4 c sifted).  Because so many people recommended a cinnamon kick, I added a tablespoon of cinnamon to the mix.  It came out great!  I also think you can use 1/4 c of the mix instead of 1/3 to make it last a little longer.

I gave this as Christmas gifts to friends and neighbors this year.  My kids and I thought it was great.  I am not a huge chocolate fan, but the balance is good.  Not too chocolatey.  I only made a double recipe and could have easily made a triple or quadruple.  I paired this with spoons that had hardened white almond bark with red and green sprinkles and marshmallows, to use to stir the hot chocolate.  Looked and tasted great too!!

This is a great and simple recipe.  I made a batch to be used as gifts.  The powdered milk is a little coarse, so I ran everything through the food processor and made a totally smooth powder.  I tested it on myself before making labels for the directions.  It takes 1T of the mix per 1/4 cup of boiling water.  My bags contained 1/2 cup of the mix, so each bag made 2-8 ounce mugs.  I used clear disposable cake decorating bags for the mix.  After the mix was in the bag, I placed about 20 miniature marshmallows at the top of the bag, and closed it up using a pipe cleaner twisted up to seal it, attaching a tag with the directions.  Perfect gift idea.

Realizing the expense of the ingredients to make a 15 cup batch, I decided to try just one cup first to see if I liked it.  Then I realized I had no powdered milk. Oops!  Not to worry - I omitted the milk, made as is [sifting all the ingredients together] heated 3/4 cup milk and VIOLA!  A perfect cup of cocoa.  This is really, really yummy.  For one serving I used 1 TBSP plus 2 tsp powdered sugar and 2 tsp each of cocoa and non dairy creamer.  I  poured the milk over the mix. So, so good. I only wish it wasn't August and I had some candy canes handy.  Guess it is time to go to the store and get some starlight mints. I do plan on making this as gifts, but still keeping the powdered milk out and changing the directions to milk instead of water. Thanks Earla

I made it exactly according to the recipe and it was too milky with not enough sugar or cocoa. I think that next time I will decrease the amount of powdered milk--hopefully that will help.

I made it according to the recipe and it is fine...6, 4, 3 yr olds approves too. I added another cup of cocoa and about 2 tablespoons of cinnamon. Perfect.  I also made it reusing a 1 gallon ice cream tup (5qt) and put a piece of plastic wrap between the lid and lip to shake it up. Since all the ingredients are very light (past experience w/ mixing powered milk), let it sit for a few minutes before opening for it's dust to settle.

I used these proportions for a 1/2 batch:  I made it in a half batch with the following measures: 1-1/2 C Hershey's Cocoa Powder 3 C Powdered Sugar 5 C Powdered Milk 1 C Powdered Creamer (I find Borden's is the best)  from a previous review, and gave it as Christmas presents. I big hit!!!!

I used to help out with the FFA concession stand at high school football games. We made large quantities of this recipe and just added the water when someone ordered. It was sold out at almost every game, even the early games when the temperature was in the high 60's.

Try it with some strong coffee and blend with ice to make a "frappacino" type drink. You could also add some ice cream in the blender for something even sweeter.

I started by making 1/3 of the original recipe, 15 servings, which made the making much more managable. You do need a large bowl even to mix this amount. The powdered sugar causes this recipe to dissolve quickly in the hot cup of water which I like. I find the light taste fine just as the recipe is but I did add more cocoa and a little more sugar to my final batch before sending it out into the gift basket. I'm not sure it really made a difference. Most hot cocoa recipes call for equal amounts of granulated sugar and cocoa, I assume the confectioners sugar in this one made up for the difference between the other recipes. It is an individual taste you can play with in a smaller batch to get the flavor you want. I enclosed cinnamon stirring sticks with mine rather than to put cinnamon in the mix. But I will try cinnamon in a cup myself to test the flavor. All in all I will make this again it was easy and the flavor was very acceptable.

Sorry, but I am a cocoa snob. I found this recipe as it is watery & bland. I added more cocoa powder & a lot more powdered milk as well as creamer to the mix before I was done. I am thankful to the submitter for a starting place. I am working with this recipe to make a hot chocolate recipe that is perfect for me :)

This recipe is great just the way it is. This is the first Hot Cocoa mix that my husband will actually drink. We did try using both regular cocoa powder and Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder, and we liked the dark cocoa best. This is what our family is getting this year for Christmas.

I made a reduced calorie version with a couple changes. I used 2 cups of creamer, 2 cups of cocoa 1 dark 1 regular. Then I replaced the sugar with Splenda, while not totally sugar free (thanks to the milk and creamer) it's as close as I could get and it turned out wonderful.

I give this recipe 4 stars just for the fact that I did take some of the advices from other reviewers! I did had some cocoa AND some confectioner's sugar. I ended up with creamy cocoa :) Yum! I will give some to my relatives during the holidays!

This was not a keeper for me, even after following some of the tips of other reviewers.  I did not use Hersey Cocoa so that may be the factor.  It wasnt sweet enough or chocolaty enough.  I will keep looking.

Ok, this is an addicting recipe. I made one change. I omitted the creamer since I am not a fan of the chemicals in it and instead have been adding one to two tbsp of flavored coffee creamer. I use the fat free but I can imagine the options with adding different types of flavoring...chocolate mint, hazelnut, french vanilla....Mmmm so good.

This recipe as written is not good. I had to add 5 1/3 cups nesquik and 2lb of pwdr sugar to make it taste good. After adding all that I feel that it is cheaper just to buy it from the store.

This recipe is wonderful!  I was looking for an inexpensive way to give a gift to each of my fellow teachers and this was perfect.  I made two batches and gave them each 2 cups in one of the holiday ziploc bags with the recipe attached.  I tried it myself and it is delicious!  Also- one reviewer noted that some dry milk brands were too granular- if you happen to buy that kind (as I did) just run your fingers through it and squeeze as if you were squeezing sand- breaks it right up!

This is such a great addition to my Christmas goodies!  But yes, you need a big bowl.  I divided mine up into little ziploc bags- 6 servings per bag, then I made little cards on my computer with the serving instructions and taped it to the bag.  I put the bag inside a mug and included a little plate of cookies.  People loved it!

First tip, use a large turkey baking bag to mix it in. Just place all ingredients in the bag, tie it off and shake, shake shake. Keeps the powdered sugar from getting on all flat surfaces in your kitchen! I also use hot cocoa mix instead of cocoa powder, it makes for a really rich mix.

I intended to make a half recipe but didn't really read the recipe before I went to the store.  I bought a small box of powdered milk so that was not really enough for half the recipe.  Turns out it was plenty enough of powdered milk  taste for me. I started out with about a cup and a quarter of Penzeys Natural High Fat Cocoa, (Strong, dark chocolate flavor) and ended up adding probably 3/4 cup Hersheys as well, then tossed in maybe 8 oz of Ghirardelli sweet ground chocolate and cocoa. Tweeked up the powdered sugar also but not by much, dd doesn't like it too sweet. I made a sample cup and was still not very impressed so I added 1/8 teaspoon vanilla and a dash of salt and it got a whole lot better.  Dd loved it, said she liked it a LOT better than the scratch cocoa I made the other day off the Hersheys can. She is the one who will be drinking it so all is well.

I was excited about this... the 6 of us can go through boxes of cocoa like nothing when it's cold outside.  So I tried it out, made a 1/2 batch according to another reviewers modifications... 5c milk (ran through processer to finish powdering it) 3c powdered sugar, 1 1/2c cocoa and 1c creamer.

I will say that I love the idea and want to tweak with the flavors and types of ingredients.  I used generic and have to say I was left with an odd aftertaste... probably due to powedered milk as stated in other reviews... but thought maybe it could alsom be my creamer.  This is one time I think I'm gonna have to get some name brand ingredients.  When you're adding things to water... it's imparitive the ingredients are the "best" because those same few ingredients are all you are tasteing.  I love the idea of flavored creamers, and will also look into the type of dry milk to see if that makes a difference.  As is though... even as is tweaked... I am not impressed.  I love hot chocolate, so I am pretty picky.  My kids on the other hand all gave me smiles and "I love this stuff mom!"  So, glad I made 1/2 batch, will have no problem getting rid of the rest by my 4 kids, but am dissappointed since I had high expectations and originally made it to take to church tonight for a christmas get-together.  Will try better quality ingredients next time and will re-review. (For the record, I make almost everything from scratch and this is the first time I have EVER had to buy "quality" ingredients.

I have to agree with some of the other reviewers, this is a good starter mix, but I feel that it could use some doctoring up.  I messed up the first time I made a half batch and added just a little more cayenne pepper than I intended to add (an 1/8 tsp. should do btw), so I had to make another half batch to compensate.  It
s much better now.  I also added 1 tsp. salt to the full batch to balance it all out.  Also like some of the other reviewers, I cut the milk back by about 3/4 and added creamer to compensate.  Very creamy thats for sure!  I'm actually drinking it with water vs. milk, which is my prefered way to make hot cocoa and its pretty good!

I made this recipe and cut it in half.  However, it has a very bitter taste.  I have to add sweetener and make it with milk instead of water to tone it down so my kids will drink it.  I am not sure what happened

I scaled this back to make only 2 portions so that I could try it before investing in making such a large amount. Please note that in place of the confectioners sugar I used Splenda, as I'm diabetic. This, however, had no effect on the taste, which was overwhelmingly dominated by the unpleasant flavor of powdered milk. I'm not sure there's any way to get around this, since it's the main ingredient. As it stands, I'd much rather have the just-add-water packets made by Swiss Miss, which has a far superior flavor to this stuff.

The hot cocoa had a real chocolate taste. The only thing I would suggest is to taste before you give away to make sure it is sweet enough. I found that I had to add an extra teaspoon of powder sugar to my cup before I could drink it.

I made Cocoa Cones for my daughter's teachers and my co-workers this Christmas and I found this recipe.  My husband was the guinea pig and he loved the creamy taste from the powdered milk and non-dairy creamer.  QUICK HINT: I combined all the ingredients in my stand mixer and let it mix together for a few minutes (that was for a 48 serving recipe).

I made this for stocking stuffer-type gifts for my extended family. I had to add *a lot* of extra sugar to get this to taste sweet enough for me--pretty much a whole bag of sugar. I also added extra french vanilla-flavored creamer. Once I played with the ratio of ingredients for awhile, I finally got the mix to where I wanted it. All in all, I think this recipe is a good starting point for someone looking to make a cocoa mix.

So creamy! Better than the hot cocoa envelopes. I took other readers' suggestions & used 3 cups of chocolate drink mix, and added 1/4 c. cocoa and the results were wonderful. Am giving this as gifts this Christmas. Great recipe

My children got a kick out of helping Mom make hot cocoa mix.  They even helped fill the jars.  We also made chocolate covered marshmallows to go with the jars.  So they had to have a sample of the cocoa.  Just wonderful.

I was looking for a recipe to replace the Swiss Miss packets that I had been buying.   As written the recipe is good, but don't expect it to taste like a boxed store bought hot chocolate.  To really make it delicious I added a handful of marshmallows to each cup... yum!  Now, I know hot chocolate and marshmallows just kinda of go together, but I never really noticed a difference when I put mm in my swiss miss hot choc.  In THIS one the whole drink becomes creamy and just amazing.  Worth a try if you are looking for a great homemade recipe.

After reading the recipe and a bunch of reviews I *really* wanted some hot chocolate, but didn't have all the ingredients so I modified it and while it needs tweaking it helped curb the crave.  :)  Thank you for getting me started!

As another member suggested...run the dry milk powder thru a food processor to make it finer.

I made this for the first time tonight. My husband and I both enjoyed it very much. I am going to be putting it in mason jars and giving it as gifts to my sons teachers for Christmas.

This recipe was a really good base recipe for the cocoa I had wanted. To make it richer I added more cocoa powder and more powdered sugar. It was a hit! The people I gave it to said it was the best they've ever had.

This recipe is awsome and very versetile.  I've made it several times using different flavored creamer and I've also made it with various spices added (cinnamon, clove or pumpkin pie spice) And I always grind the dry milk powder in the blender and sift the confectioners sugar.  The mix seems to disolve much better in the water and the results are creamier.  Everyone I share this with loves it.

This was an okay place to start, however I wound up doubling the cocoa and almost doubling the sugar for it to be as sweet as we like. With those changes, it turned out okay.

This was pretty good.  I made it last year to give out at Christmas in small decorated jars.  I printed directions to make one cup on small squares of card stock, punched a hole in one corner of the square, and tied it to the lid with pretty red ribbon.  I used cinnamon creamer and added a little Nesquik as another reviewer suggested.  My mother-in-law said it tasted better when heated with milk instead of water.

My brother is serving in Afghanistan and I wanted to send him something that would warm him up now the weather has turned colder there. I made up a batch, adding a few little extras (finely chopped chocolate drops and a dash of chocolate nesquick milkshake) and was very pleasantly surprised.  The flavour is lovely and chocolatey, ideal for making as a gift.  I am sure my brother will love it.  Thank you for sharing.

My family really liked this recipe. I make it because we drink alot of cocoa and I know eactly whats in this no misc ingreds. I leave out the powdered creamer and double the cocoa. We make ours with milk. I whirl it up in the food proc. so the powder gets all mixed and the milk powder doesnt sink to the bottom.

I had to make quite a few changes with this. I added a lot more cocoa and a lot more sugar and a little more powdered milk. It's a decent start, but you have to play with it if you want something more than brown water.

Yummy! I used regular sugar, a little more cocoa, and french vanilla creamer. It actually makes more than 45 servings so the calorie content is only 107 because they got the number of servings wrong (it's more like 70, not 45)

For powdered sugar - If you have a coffee bean grinder, try putting granulated sugar in it.  Makes a nice powdered sugar.  No additives, and fluffy. 
  I don't like using non-dairy creamers with the hydrogenated fats.

5 for taste, 2 for texture.  Unfortuneately, its really chalky for me, although my boyfriend likes it.  I already added extra cocoa but I think I'll try to add more sugar and creamer as suggested by others.  Hopefully it will save this batch so I can give it out as gifts as intended!
**UPDATE** I added more creamer and sugar but it still was pretty chalky and it definitely left a "sludge" on the bottom of the cup. I gave this in a gift basket and I got comments on how great everything was except the hot cocoa mix.  Had to change star from 3 to 2.

I made my first batch exactly as the recipe directed and was disappointed. It wasn't creamy and the flavor wasn't chocolatey enough. I added some cinnamon and it helped. The second batch I messed around with the ratio of ingredients and finally got a creamier version that I liked. I wish I knew exactly what I did to get a tastier version.

The recipe is good, though I thought it was missing something. I added a little extra cocoa and sugar, plus a tsp salt. But it turns out the trick is to add the mix to boiling or really hot milk - makes it SO rich.

Good base recipe but as noted by other reviewers, definitely needed some tweaking to be really flavorful.  I thought it needed to be more chocolaty as well as a bit sweeter; I therefore took the advice of another reviewer and added about 2 c of Nestle Quik.  I also added 3 t of cinnamon which really added a good twist.

The recipe is great! I added an extra 1/2 cup powdered sugar to the mix, though. Very creamy!

I love this cocoa mix.  I took your advise and used the cinnamon creamer and it is delicious.  I topped it with whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  Next time I am going to try french vanilla creamer.

being a new mom i quickly discovered that christmas really needed to be quick, cheap, and easy this year...our budget was rather slim, but i was able to make a dozen gifts of this delicious cocoa mix, with some left over for us, too! it was incredibly easy (just make sure you have a BIG bowl!) and absolutely delicious and everyone who got a jar of this for christmas loved it...thanks so much!!

I made this recently for the holidays and followed the recipe to a "T". I'm sorry to say that it just was not that good. This was my first attempt at making hot cocoa mix, in the past I've always bought the packages. From the reviews I was expecting it to be so much better than the store bought but this didn't even come close. My kids won't even drink it. :(

Love it!  Very easy to mix up and give as treats for Christmas.  I added crushed up little bits of peppermint candy canes to the mix and it gave it a nice holiday flavor.  I also used Hersheys Dark Chocolate Cocoa instead of the plain and it was delicious.

This is fantastic!  I used CoffeeMate's Creamy Chocolate flavored creamer.  My son and I just each had a cup.  I stirred in a Mint Truffle Hershey's Kiss and my son stirred in a Candy Cane Hershey's Kiss.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing, Earla!

****update**** I used dark unseetened cocoa powder on our most recent batch and was so much better!  
I'd give this recipe a 4.5 stars if I could.  It's really good, but just missing something that would make it great.  I add a little cinnamon and cayanne to give it something different.  If you like a more rich chocholate taste, you'll need to add a lot more than listed. I'll never buy store bought cocoa again.

Following other reviewer suggestions (sorry, never tried the actual recipe), I think that this is very good.  I made half the recipe twice--it's easier so that it fits in the bowls. 5 c. (ground) dry milk, 1 c. Hershey's dark cocoa powder, 3 c. powdered sugar 1 c. coffeemate cinnamon, 2 Tbsp. cinnamon.  It has a really nice, rich flavor.  However, because it uses coffeemate, this doesn't really reduce the not-so-good-for-you ingredients that are found in store-bought hot chocolate.  So, I don't really know if it's worth the trouble to make your own (I gave it out as Christmas gifts).

This is a great hot cocoa recipe that's easy to make with ingredients that are easily found in any grocery store. Obviously, you can "spice it up" by adding all kinds of different ingredients, but if you just want a basic, easy-to-make cocoa recipe, this is it!

This stuff was amazing!  I cut the recipe in half, and it still made a ton!  Even though there is dry milk in the mix, I still mixed it with hot milk and it made the creamiest, dreamiest hot cocoa I have ever tasted!

eh, so so.  I had to make a batch for 70 women.  I entered in the serving size for 210 servings.  I put them in little baggies, put minichocolate chips over the mix, then put mini marshmallows over those. Then tied in with rafia and put a candycane in the bow.  Looks great, and tastes okay.  I also used irish cream flavored powdered creamer, and i do think that made it better than it would have been.

I didn't have enough of all the ingredients on hand but I used what I had.  I used 8 cups dry non-fat milk, 1-3/4 cocoa, 6 cups powdered sugar, 2 cups French Vanilla Creamer, 3/4 cup Cinnamon Creamer, and 1 teaspoon salt.  I used my food processor for the cocoa, the cinnamon creamer and the non-fat milk and sifted the powdered sugar.  I just dumped the French Vanilla creamer into the batch.  After I mixed it all up, I could see little flecks of milk through out.  I made me sample and after I mixed in the hot water there were little pieces of milk or creamer floating on the top.  After I let it set for a little bit most of them dissolved. I then put tho whole mixture through the food prcessor again and all of the white flecks have disappeared.  I made another sample to drink after adding more cocoa and added a few minature marshmellows to my cup.  This is very good.  I am only rating a four because of not following the recipe .  This made a lot of mix, but it will make wonderful Christmas presents.

I made this recipe last night but changed it some as I didn't want to make such a huge batch at once, just in case it didn't turn out.  
5 cups dry milk powder
3 cups confectioners/icing sugar 
1 ¾ cups Hersey’s Cocoa Powder 
1 cup Coffee Mate “French Vanilla” Creamer 

In a large bowl - mixed all ingredients and stored them in a sealed container.

Mix 2 Heaping Tbsp to 6 oz of Boiling Water.  Stir Well.  Added 2 oz of cold milk to cool it slightly.  Loved it and will make it again!

This is OK... I really sifted/stirred to make sure there weren't big chunks of powdered milk. But, overall, the taste isn't bad (my husband will probably want it sweeter), although nothing amazing!

This is our favorite hot cocoa recipe ever! I always make a lot and it doesn't take long for it to disappear. It's perfect for post trick or treating or Christmas caroling. And of course with a handful of marshmallows on top!

I made a small batch just to test this recipe since the reviews were somewhat mixed.  I think this is an excellent recipe.  I'm not sure what others were doing wrong, since the cocoa came out rich and delicious. I was very happy with the results.  This is a keeper!

This cocoa is awesome!  I give it as a present in jars every year.  All of my family is always asking if they will get some.  One year I used granulated sugar instead, and it was just as good!  I highly recommend this recipe.  This year I am making a batch with cinnamon flavored creamer.

I had made this for Christmas for gifts....everyone absolutley loved BUT to me you have to add a little more of the mix for it to be sweet enough and that to me is allot of sugar.   But it was still awesome tasting!!

Good recipe.  Works well with milk.  I like to add mini-marshmallows in the mix.  Also I add a bit more sugar to it.

What a great recipe!  We're giving all of our kids' teachers, scout leaders, and Sunday School teachers a wide-mouth quart jar of this recipe for Christmas.  The only change I made was to sift ALL ingredients as I was combining them. This makes the texture even more smooth and eliminates any "leftovers" at the bottom of the mug.

This was the perfect finishing touch to give with my Christmas cookie gifts this year!  Not too sweet and tastes wonderful (made exactly as the recipe states)!!  I found the perfect holiday containers and put miniture marshmallows at the top of the cocoa mix in the container!  Got rave reviews and made an extra batch to keep around the house, too!  I noticed that the recipe has been amended to show the amount of creamer than the one I printed in 2001!  LOL  I was measuring the creamer with a food scale -- much easier now knowing that it's 1 3/4 cups of creamer!  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Earla!!

This makes a great "emergency gift".  I keep several jars of it on hand during the holidays.  Make sure that the powdered milk you get isn't too granulated or it doesn't mix together right.  Flavored creamers really do make it wonderful.

I prepared Jo's Recipe of 20 November 2006 exactly as she recommended. 
  My only change was using Lactose Free Whole Milk instead of water.  3/4 C of milk & 1/3 C of mix.
  It was brilliant.   Chocolatey, Rich, & Delicious. 
My 5 Stars are for Jo, not the original recipe.

Yes, I put a little more powdered milk in and also more creamer. I felt it let the cocoa powder incorporate more.  Yes I will make it again

Followed the recipe.  Turned out very tasty!
Used my mixer to combine all the ingredients.
Worked out well but the mixer bowl was too small to do a whole batch.  Split it in two and combine them both together after.  Filled up 4 quart jars, making about 12 servings per jar,  for Christmas presents.
Thanks for the recipe!!!

I've made this recipe exactly as stated and my kids thought it was great.  It does it job and for mom's who like to know  what their kids are eating.  In my opinion this recipe fits the bill perfectly!  We don't eat a lot of sugar so we cut way back and then didn't feel guilty when adding a few marshmallows.

Then I had a homemade mix from a friend who claimed to use the same recipe.  She had a secret.  She swapped out a cup of dry milk powder with a cup of buttermilk powder.  It doesn't change the flavor but gives it a touch of richness that makes this go from good to WOW.  And then if you swap out a flavored creamer, you get a gourmet cup of cocoa worth gifting and your friends and family will adore.  

I should also add that the cocoa powder you use makes or breaks this recipe.  That nasty lumpy bakers cocoa powder is NOT what you want to use.  Either spring for the Ghirardelli at most groceries or go to Penzeys and get the really good stuff.

I know I've changed up this recipe, but the base recipe really is good on it's own.

The mix tasted ok but as previous needed some improvements. I melted an Andes mint in my mug and that made it Wonderful!

I changed the recipe a bit. I added 1 three oz package chocolate pudding, an extra 1/4 cup creamer, 1 tablespoon salt and 2 tablespoons corn starch to prevent caking.

This is a good starting point but needs a lot of work.  To begin, I could not find powdered milk anywhere in a quantity larger than 6 cups so off we go.  To get a good product, I ended up using the full amount of all the other ingredients to get a rich, chocolatey drink.  Also, I fill the cup/mug halfway with the mix then fill with water.  It may not go as far but boy is it rich and good.

Very good!    I love making this when  it starts getting cold, and I enjoy drinking a cup of this hot cocoa anytime, but especially when it is cold outside.   I mix half of each ingredient to a bowl rather than making it all at once because only half the recipe fits in my food processor, which I do so that all the ingredients blend well together.  I  usually add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of additional cocoa powder to make it more chocolaty.

Love this recipe! It's easy to make. I put the dried milk in my ninja to make it very fine. I have put all the ingredients in a big pot because it makes a lot. At Christmas I make goodie bags for loved ones and they all ask for this mix. My son and mother in law fight over who gets the most.

The predominant flavor of the cocoa was powdered milk. I upped the amount of chocolate in the recipe to see if it would help but it didn't. It's not bad enough to throw away but I'll be sprucing it up with liquid vanilla coffee creamer to try and mask the powdered milk flavor.

It's a great recipe!  The only thing I did differently was to put the mixture in a blender/food processor.   I do try different cocoa mixture and dry milk here and there, but nothing to comment about.  I've used this for the last few years for Christmas gifts and hostess gifts.  Put it in any size mason jar and attach a lamintaed square with instructions.  Pair it with tiny marshmallows for kids, or a tiny bottle of kaluha, rum-chatta or fireball for the adults.  It's perfect!!  Thank you for the recipe!

Perfect! Made a batch and put into glass ornaments for a craft sale. I added little extras in each ornament-crushed candy canes, Andes mint baking pieces and mini chocolate chips. The ornaments are a huge hit every year!

Used the most helpful critical review and made with 10 c powdered milk, 3 c. cocoa, 2 c. creamer, and 6 c. powdered sugar.  Very good.  Will be giving this out in jars as a party favor for my daughter's winter-themed 3rd birthday party.

I am a hot chocolate snob who has never liked homemade mixes, so I was very wary of any mix recipe. However, for teacher gifts I thought this would be better than homemade treats since those need to be eaten right away, while these can last all winter.
Anyway, this is easily the best hot chocolate I have ever tasted! I couldn't believe it when I tried it- I was shocked! Granted, I didn't stick completely to this recipe (I know you purists hate that), but I was really close. I know I like a lot of chocolate, so I added an additional 1/2 cup cocoa, as well as chopped up candy canes because I love mint. Everyone in my family agreed that we are never buying hot cocoa mix again- this is now our go-to hot chocolate recipe!

Oh, but the sifting powdered sugar is a PAIN. The last cup we gave up and just dumped it in- still turned out great.

I made this for holiday gifts,I added one packet of instant chocolate pudding mix for every cup of powdered milk, and also changed the sugar for Stevia for the diabetics in the family. Both versions are delicious!!! Adding the pudding gives it a richer creamier flavor that my daughter loves.

A bit watery as it stands, but like everyone else, I modify recipes to my liking.  Put a dollop of whipped cream on top!  Use flavored creamer to change the flavor a bit.  Have fun with it, remember this recipe is a base, you have to build your own perfect hot cocoa.

I only had 2 cups of powdered milk in the pantry so just divided the recipe in fifths (multiply all measurements by 0.2).  It was really easy to put into a tupperware and shake until mixed.  I added mini-marshmallows to the mix after it was completed.  

It dissolves just fine if you treat it like the pre-made in an envelope version; add a little water to the bottom of your mug.  Spoon in desired amount of cocoa mix.  Stir vigorously as you add the rest of the water.  It helps if the water is almost boiling.  

I personally prefer a less sweet cocoa and this is great.  If you like it sweeter, just add more sugar to taste.

I have made this quite a few times. I have also made this with adding 1/4 cup of cinnamon, 1 tablespoon of clove, and 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper(will give a kick and can be omitted) to give it a Mexican flair. 
Also when making with the regular recipe add a teaspoon of instant coffee for mocha.

My husband and I loved this hot cocoa! I followed the recipe exactly as written and found it perfect!  It's not overly sweet, which for us,  is what we like!  It's hot COCOA , not hot chocolate.  If you want it a little sweeter (the way my kiddos like it) just stir in a handful of chocolate chips! My hubby loves to stir some of this into his coffee! :-)

I begged my aunt for two years to get the hot cocoa mix recipe she uses - finally she gave it to me and this is it!  It makes a very rich and delicious hot chocolate!  For Christmas this year I'm giving out single serving hot cocoa mixes to my coworkers in cone shaped treat bags.  For half of the cones I added 1 Tbs. mint filled chocolate chips plus 1 mini candy cane and topped it with mini marshmallows.  For the other half, I put 1 heaping Tbs. cinnamon chips and 2 shakes of ground cinnamon and also topped it with mini marshmallows.  I hope my coworkers like them!  I enjoyed both versions and the original plain!  Note:  I purchased a 25.6 oz box of dry milk thinking it would be enough.  It measured out to be just 9 cups.  Didn't want to go back to the store, so I just used the one box.  Didn't alter any other ingredient increments.  Turned out great!  Also, I used half normal Hershey's unsweetened cocoa and half Hershey's Special Dark cocoa just like my aunt does!  Thank you so much for the recipe Earla Taylor!  Worth the wait :)
Note:  Using the 25.6oz box of dry milk, this makes 41.5 servings.

Great if substitute splenda for confectioners sugar. I usually mix the final hot cocoa powder in milk, not water.  Very rich and creamy that way.

This is a great recipe. I just add extra powdered sugar because I like it sweeter. I made a 1/4 of a batch because the container I use for my mix is smaller than a full batch needs.

Absolutely fabulous!! I used the exact ingredients but obviously the measurements can be altered and still produce wonderful results.  I cut the recipe in half and only roughly measured the ingredients.  My test cup tasted great even though I thought 1/3 cup of mix would be too much.  It was perfect for a small cup of cocoa.

I love to have hot cocoa mix on hand during the cold months. For mine, I added 1/2 regular creamer & half vanilla caramel creamer. If we are in the mood for a mocha drink, I'll add a bit of instant coffee to each mug. Thanks for sharing!

This was really good. I followed it to a tee. I'm giving it to my friends for Christmas. I do wish it was a little bit creamier, but it was the perfect sweetness. Next time I make it I may try some different things that other people have tried. I will never go back to buying swiss miss!!!!

I made this today to make for gifts.  I cut the servings down to 20 bc I had 3 jars to fill, but I still had enough left over for a sandwich bag size of mix.  Since I had leftover, I thought I'd try it.  Very nice little hot cocoa mix.  A little sweet, but most mixes are too sweet for me anyway.  Thanks!

I was impressed. I did as some of the others and added 2 cups of cocoa and 6 cups of powdered sugar. I am short on cash this year and have a lot of family, so I did some stocking stuffers by doing this recipe and putting 1 cup each in clear bags and using address labels to put the direction on the bags and then added a pretty little Christmas ribbon. There was a bit left over so I tried it myself and put a few marshmallows in it and it is great. Thank you so much!

This cocoa was too watery for me. I like a richer, creamier, chocolatier cocoa. Increasing the amount of mix used per cup might help some.

My kids love chocolatey hot cocoa so I added 6 cups of cocoa and an additional 1 & 1/2 cups of powdered sugar.  I ran everything through the food processor and it made the smoothest, richest cocoa ever.

The cocoa powder was overpowering.  I made 3 servings to try before I used it in hot chocolate cones, but I was not impressed.  Once I added an extra teaspoon of powdered sugar (per cup), it was better, but it's not something that I or my tasters will be repeating.

I made only 1/4 of this recipe just to be sure I liked it first (before making such a large batch).  I brought it to work and everyone really enjoyed it... it's going quick!  They all agreed that it was just the right amount of sweetness and they loved that it was low in calories compared to other varieties of hot cocoa mix.  We ended up just adding 1/3 a cup of mix to 1 cup water and it didn't taste diluted at all.

This is a great platform to get what I wanted for a cocoa mix.  Just had to tweak it a little to get the sweetness and creaminess personal to me.  Liked that it only requires 4 ingredients that I have on hand all the time.

Great, easy hot cocoa mix. I made it, and used it for gifts, along with a nice, big cocoa mug. I added a bit of cinnamon and some mini-marshmallows, and it was even better! 

I second the recommendation of flavored powdered creamer. Hazelnut, french vanilla, and sweet italian cream are my favorites to use

I had an old recipe that I used back in the early 80's.  This is as close as I could come to that.  I think it's great!  I might a little more creamer as I go...or milk.  I really like it the way it is....yes a little chalky/sludgy but I just kept swirling!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Good flavor, makes a lot of mix. I added a touch more cocoa, sugar and creamer. Kids loved it after sledding today.

Made a huge batch due to the great reviews. It tasted so bland that I was hesitant on giving this out. The people I did give it to, said nothing about it and the rest ended up in the garbage. HUGE waste of ingredients on my part. I guess I am just used to drinking more flavorful cocoa than this. Sorry.

This is great!  I followed a few of the suggestions and the mix turned out better than store bought.  Thank you Earla for sharing your recipe.
