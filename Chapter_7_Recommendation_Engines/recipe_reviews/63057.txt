these were killer! i loved them. my family said they were too hot, but i was not able to find canned green chiles or the chipotle in adobo, and just chopped up some serrano peppers, so i'm sure that was the culprit. but this is an awesome recipe that i have played with a few times since then to accomodate my family, and it's been a winner every time.

Not very kid friendly because of the level of "fire" in the salsa but great if you're into hot things.  Very tasty!  Leave off the salsa for the kids - some husbands, too.  = )

The salsa recipe is wonderful--best homemade salsa I've tried.  The meat mixture, however, you can skip.  It's not really anything out of the ordinary and I didn't like the addition of the tomatoes.
