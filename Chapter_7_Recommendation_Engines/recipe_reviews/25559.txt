I have been wanting to try a banana cake recipe for a while now.  Specifically one with a caramel frosting.  I made this one using the golden butter cake mix from Duncan Hines and it turned out absolutely wonderful.  I made it two ways as I had two boxes of mix that I wanted to get rid of.  I did a layer cake with caramel frosting and a bundt cake with ganache poured over it.  I wish I could give it a better rating because this is one of the few cakes I have come across that need no icing at all, I found I prefer it alone although everyone at work loved it with the caramel icing.  It's absolutely perfect.  DON'T under any circumstances add banana creme pudding mix to it (like I did for the bundt cake).  It's cake, but it takes away from the banana flavor.  This recipe is perfect just the way it's written.  Thank you for sharing it Beth.

I had three over ripe bananas I wanted to use up and stumbled upon this recipe.  I wouldn't consider it "company" quality, but it's a nice, quick cake to make. I used a spice cake mix, 3 bananas, and topped with a caramel glaze of 1/2 c. butter, 2 tsp. milk or cream, and 1/2 c. brown sugar, boiling until sugar is dissolved.

Excellent, easy, and tasty.  A keeper.  Great way to use over ripe bananas.  Baked as a bundt cake, increase the baking time by about 10 minutes and put a chocolate glaze over it. Thanks for sharing.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but this cake puffed up very high in the oven and as soon as I took it out it fell about three inches. I cooked it for 35 minutes, but it never did spring back when I touched it. The toothpick test was clean and I was afraid to cook it for any longer. It tastes wonderful, but why did it fall? Can anyone help me? I'd really like to make this again, because it does taste so good, but I don't want another flop on my hands.

This was a very delicious and moist cake. I made a few minor changes--I used 1 cup of milk and added only 1 tsp lemon juice and 1 tsp lemon juice to the bananas (I only had a half of a lemon)  I also used 2 tsp pure vanilla extract and melted the butter in the microwave so it would mix into the batter easier. Instead of baking it in a 13x9-inch pan, I used two 9 inch round cake pan and baked it for 30 to 35 minutes.  I split the cakes horizontally and filled the cakes with a banana custard mousse filling and added some sliced strawberries to that and frosted it with a banana cream cheese frosting and decorated the cake with a few strawberries.  Can we say yum???--It was a hit!!  Thanks for a keeper, Beth.

This was a whole lot of yum, and not much effort at all. The only change I made was I added one additional banana to what the recipe called for. I topped it with a cream cheese frosting and it was simply divine! I will definitely use this recipe for my leftover bananas from now on.

I loved the convenience of using the cake mix.  It was very light and almost melted in my mouth.  I used 4 bananas, added some walnuts and used 2/3 cup of sour cream in place of the milk/lemon juice.  Delicious!

I LOVE THIS CAKE!  It is the first banana cake that was more like cake than banana bread.  It has a nice delicate fluffy texture just like cake.  It is so easy and tastes fantastic.  My favorite way to eat this is to poke it with many holes when it comes from the oven and pour warm pudding (vanilla or butterscotch) over it.  The holes fill up with pudding, and there is no need for frosting, but it tastes wonderful with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!

I used a butter recipe golden cake mis.  It was great.  I usually use the banana cake mix but I was out and only had the yellow mix.  I decided to give it a try.  Everyone said it was better than the banana cake mix.  Cake was very moist.  I made an icing from mashed bananas, 2 T margarine and a box of confectioner sugar.

This was Great hit at my house, My 9yr old grand daughter helped make it and loved smashing the bananas, I did ude 3 by the way, The rest was great as is, I used a 10 inch bundt pan. So I cooked it at 325 degrees for 50 minutes. I used a vanilla frosting because that is what I had on hand and it was fantastic! My husband loved it and wants me to make him another one right away.Glenda :)

Ohhhh, deelish! This is an awesome recipe, and I know what's good! So tastey and would be fine with no type of icing, but I did put some chocolate frosting on it. The fam loved it. I heated up some chocolate icing in the micro and drizzled it over the top. I used a bundt pan to bake. It turned out really pretty-- almost (ALMOST) too pretty to cut and eat! Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this a few times and have always had great reviews.  I used 3 very ripe bananas, added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and used 1 fresh lemon. Using a fresh lemon instead of bottled lemon juice made a big difference in the taste.  I then frosted with a light cream cheese frosting.  Yummy!  I baked 3 of these for a friend to take to a carry-in at her work, she didn't have any leftovers!!!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

This tastes very similar to the cakes my aunties use to make me for my birthday when I was a kid! Wonderful with cream cheese icing as an everyday cake. Also made fantastic Bananas Foster cupcakes iced with Caramel Swiss Meringue icing and caramel drizzle and got rave reviews!

My ingredient changes: I used buttermilk instead of the milk and lemon juice, a Duncan Hines French Vanilla Cake and 3 large very very ripe bananas. 

Tips:  Bananas get sweeter, richer and more intense as they age so I buy what I need about 3 weeks ahead of time and let them ripen on my counter until they are BLACK. Freeze them to have on hand for this cake or banana bread, but DONT THROW OVERRIPE BANANAS AWAY PEOPLE!  (Someday I'll try roasting them. :P)  I like to puree my bananas so that they are very smooth before adding to recipes. 

Mix the ingredients for only as long as the cake mix directs (2 minutes for DH cake mixes.) Over mixing will cause the cake to rise high in the oven (from incorporating too much air during mixing), then deflate once it cools. Oh, I always sift my cake mixes to get out the lumps. You will enjoy this cake!

This cake turned out so good, I had four over ripe bananas, mashed them up added a squirt of lemon juice. used a yellow cake mix because it was all I had and added a teaspoon of Butterdough extract and the rest of my wet mix, beat it for about a minute. Baked it at 350 for about 12 minutes longer than the recipe calls for.
I let it cool in the bundt pan for about ten minutes before turning out on a rack to cool thoroughly.

I was looking for a recipe to use up ripe bananas and found this one.  The best find ever. I only made a few changes, I added banana cream pudding mix (I had it in my pantry, and would never make it for pudding or pie)and I used 3/4 cup milk, followed others and used 3 bananas and topped it off with chocolate fudge topping used for ice cream, I just microwaved it for 90 seconds and drizzled it over the top. Yummy!  I made it for my family that consists of 3 adults and 3 children under the of 6 - Gone in 60 seconds!!!!! Thank you so much for this recipe sending it to my aunt who loves bananas!

I was able to make 26 large yummy cupcakes. The only thing I would change is the amount of bananas. It was a little too subtle of a banana taste--I would recommend 3 bananas to anyone who really wants to taste the banana. Thank you!

This cake came out just like a local shop called "Nothing Bunt Cake".  It is wonderful.  I had to cook it longer then it said also.  I think the person who made the receipe used a different size pan then me.  If you use a bunt pan, you will need to cook it a little longer.  It has to spring back.  If it doesn't, it is still not cooked enough inside and will flop.

I stumbled upon this cake one time when I had leftover bananas, and it is BY FAR the most popular cake I have ever made.  My husband's friends ask for it within 5 minutes of entering our home, and there is never a piece leftover!  I used sour cream instead of milk and lemon juice and used 3 bananas instead of 2.  Delicious, moist, fluffy cake that is a hit with all that try it.

This recipe is fantastic.  I have never made a banana cake with a  cake mix.  I made it in a bundt pan and topped it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze.  People at the dinner party loved it.  I will definitely make this again.

What a fabulous way to spruce up a cake mix!  Simple ingredients that are kitchen staples combine to create a flavorful, moist, rich cake no one will ever know used a boxed mix as its foundation!  I decided to melt the butter completely instead of just using softened butter, and I think it made for an even softer, moister cake that was still gorgeously browned on the outside.  The banana flavor was incredible--when my dad got home for lunch, he was thoroughly impressed by the scent filling the house.  I'll definitely be saving this recipe for use when I want to doctor up other mixes in the future!

This is a great way to use the extra ripe bananas. For a change try adding 1 cup of chopped pecans to the cake and cover with a banana frosting; 1 small container of cool whip, 1 small package of instant banana pudding, 1 cup of milk. Sprinkle with finely chopped pecans. 
Thanks for sharing this quick and easy moist cake. This is a keeper.

I made this into a great layer cake by using 2 9 inch round cake tins, don't have an exact baking time just kinda kept an eye on it. I made a box of banana pudding (half the milk) to put in the middle.  I mixed a little banana exract into a tub of whipped vanilla icing.  It was fantastic, everyone loved it.

Increased recipe to 120 servings and made it for high school lunch, frosted it with a vanilla glaze. The kids were begging for thirds and fourths servings. It was a huge hit.

This cake was super delicious.  I used 3 very ripe bananas and 1 cup of chopped walnuts.  Also I glazed it with a lemon and powder sugar glaze.  Everyone thought it was a winner.  Gone in a day!  Very easy with the cake mix.  Highly recommend.  I cooked this cake in a bundt cake pan and had to cook for 1 hour at 350.

Oh boy...you are in for a real treat when you try this easy recipe! Like many others, I was  looking for a recipe to use my over-ripe bananas. (I dislike throwing them out-makes me feel guilty!!!) I usually keep a couple of cake box mixes in the cellar as staples. The recipe was quick and easy and bakes fast. We ate it warm with cream cheese frosting and vanilla ice cream. This is a real winner! Thanks so much for sharing! =)

Amazing cake with just the right amount of banana flavor.  I made a layer cake and frosted it with a chocolate icing and it was to die for.

This recipe is so good as is that no changes are needed at all -- and it is not too sweet yet a frosting of any kind is not needed. My mother AND my son loved it so much that they request it almost every week since I first made it. It is my go-to cake on the weekends when I want to use up so-called leftover bananas before I bring in more for the week ahead. I say so-called leftover because I believe my son AND my mother buy more bananas then can possibly be eaten before they get too ripe now that I have made this recipe!!!

FOR THOSE W/ DAIRY ALLERGIES... This recipe works well as written using vanilla soy milk in place of milk (yes, add the lemon juice), and dairy-free 'BUTTER' spread in place of real butter (i.e. Spectrum Naturals spread). Cake was fluffy and moist; I cooked for 45-50 minutes. The middle did fall a bit, but this did not affect taste.

Oh my GOSH! This was phenomenal! Since I'm allergic to citrus I left out the lemon juice and this cake STILL rocked! I made it as a sheet cake and it's already more than half gone. I will be using this recipe for my daughter's birthday cake!

My husband really liked this recipe. I used the Banana Butter Icing, added walnuts to the cake mixture (used yellow cake mix), and made it in a bundt pan. It turned out very pretty too.

Nice and fluffy.  I used buttermilk instead of the milk/lemon juice and a yellow cake mix because it was what I had on hand.  I also used 3 bananas.  I made a caramel icing but think it would be better with a cream cheese frosting.

The only change I made was to use Pillsbury Banana cake mix. This was INCREDIBLE! I baked it in a bundt, and it came out beautiful, moist, excellent. My food critic husband raved!

This is an excellent recipe!  I just took it today for a potluck, along with flan and a pound cake, and everyone at the potluck liked this recipe the best!  It's so moist, and not that sweet, which is a good thing, so the flavor isn't overpowering.  I followed other suggestions, such as using 3 bananas, and no lemon on the bananas. I also used a bit more milk (almost 1 cup!) than the recipe said, since i accidently overpoured in my 1c measuring cup, but that may have made the difference.  Excellent!

This recipe is so moist!  My husband just loves it and says it his very favortie cake!  I added cream cheese icing, but not much because it takes away from the cake.  I also used 4 bananas and a yellow cake mix, bacause I didn't have a butter one.

Got raves from party guests - truly a great cake!  Made as directed except substituted buttermilk for the milk/lemon juice mixture (FYI -the lemon juice is used to sour the milk and make a substitute for buttermilk, which most people don't keep around.)  You wouldn't believe it started with a box mix!

This cake is awesome!!  I read the reviews and used 2/3 cup of sour cream instead of the milk and lemon juice.  Plus, I only had a Yellow Cake Mix in the pantry...so I used that. I have added this recipe to my most favorites!!  Thank you for sharing!

This recipe gets 5 stars because it deserves it...quick, easy and delicious.  I used yellow cake mix because that's what I had in the pantry.  I used a topping shortcut.  Half a can of whipped white frosting that I microwaved for 15 seconds and then drizzled on top.  Also, baked mine in a bundt pan for 10 minutes longer than time listed in recipe.  A light and tender cake that smelled so good it drove my kids crazy!

If your looking for a different banana cake recipe try this one.  It's very moist and tastes delicious.  I iced mine with caramel icing and it was a smashing hit.  Next time I'm going to add some walnuts. Mmmm...

Absolutely delicious! Cake mixes are smaller these days but I don’t think it interfered with recipe. I ended up using 4 small banana I had frozen that I removed excess liquid from. Cake appears to have sunk in middle fir some reason but is still amazing! Moist delicious banana flavor. Didn’t even need frosting.

The only banana cake I have ever enjoyed! I used cream cheese icing and did add walnuts to the top of that. Honestly, this cake is amazing even without icing! Super moist and very flavorful! If you're debating on trying another cake, dont. This is the best!

I made this cake last week for Valentine's day, and baked it in a heart-shaped pan.  It puffed up really high while baking, then sank while cooling.  Once I inverted the pan, everything was fine.  Next time, I'll try cutting the baking soda in half to half a teaspoon instead a full teaspoon.  That might prevent the excess height during baking.  The cake turned out good, but not out-of-this-world.

Made this without milk, used almond/coconut milk instead and it turned out great.  I only had a 15.25 oz box of butter cake mix, so I added a 1/3 c. of flour just to be safe. Brought it out to our harvest crew and they loved it, very moist and not as dense as some banana recipes.  Just used store bought vanilla frosting. Next time I won't beat it as long as it sunk a little in the middle.

The first time I made this I made a mistake and used only 1/2 tsp baking powder. It was a glutinous messl. I re-read the recipe and realized what I did wrong. The second time around it was wonderful. Made my own cream cheese frosting. hubby loved it and it got betters it sat. it didn't last very long. definitely a keeper and really easy.Thanks so much.

When it came out of the oven I thought, another dried out cake.  Wow to my surprise this is amazingly moist.  I used a carmel glaze. But the cake would have stood on it's own with powder sugar sprinkled on top or plain!  Thanks for this recipe!

Very good.  Made it with 3 bananas as the ones I had weren't very big.  Great for breakfast too.

I truely enjoyed this recipe. I did tweak it somewhat as I used 3 bananas. I cooked it in my 9x13 stoneware. The best part was the icing, as I used Peanut Butter. My husband looked @ me quite funny when I told him what I was icing it with. It's like having a Banana & Peanut Butter sandwich. Funny now as half the cake has allready been eaten. Great Recipe !

This cake came out moist, yet still nice and fluffy. Not heavy at all. Super easy. It is really mild on the banana. I could hardly taste it. Depending on what your looking for that could be good or bad. I was worried about adding another banana and having it be too heavy. Maybe banana extract could give it a kick.

I didn't have a butter cake mix, so tried it with a German Chocolate mix.  It was very good!  Did everything else the same.  It did have to bake longer than 35 minutes though.

I made this for our small group Bible study, topped with whipped cream, and everyone said it was very good.  My husband and I thought the flavor was great and the light texture was nice.  The only reason I gave four stars instead of five, was because it was a bit crumbly when I cut it.  Could have well been my baking time or something - I'll try it again.

I used this recipe as the cake part of a pudding poke & pour cake using sugar free banana pudding, and topping with sugar free cool whip. To the batter, I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp allspice, 1 tsp nutmeg, and 1 tsp cloves, and about 3/4 C chopped walnuts. This was seriously good. The cake is so light and is exactly what I was looking for. Great way to use up overripe bananas!

For as easy as the recipe is...I'm impressed.  This compares to the banana loaves you find at Starbucks.  Great banana flavor, super moist and great texture.  I'm known for my banana bread and use this recipe when I don't feel like doing it all from scratch!

I made this cake with 3 bananas and baked it in a bundt pan, it was good but it fell and I can't figure out why.  We ate half of it by the end of the day so it was not a major problem.  Doesn't need icing.

I made this cake for our Memorial Day celebration and it was so good. Everyone fell in love with it and asked when I would be making it again.  I did change the recipe as noted by another reviewer to add sour cream instead of the lemon juice and milk mixture. The cake was so moist, I can't wait to make it again.

Delicious and moist cake.  My husband is going bananas over it. Didn't change a thing, except that I used a white cake mix.  As a side note, I topped this cake with banana butter icing from this site, and it is much too sweet for my tastes.  Next time I'll try a cream cheese frosting, or better yet. the frosting from the Southern Red Velvet Cake recipe from this site. I call it "boiled frosting" which is the most delicious recipe for frosting I've made in 30 years.

I used the recipe Cake Mixes from Scratch and Variations in place of the butter cake mix called for in this recipe. I also added a 1/2 tsp. of imitation flavoring. I made no other changes. I poured the cake batter into two loaf pans and cooked them that way. Smells amazing. I'll make this recipe again. EDITED: If I make this again, I might cut back on the eggs or milk a bit. My loaves sunk in the middle which I think was because there was too much liquid.

I really enjoyed this banana cake and thought that it was very similar to banana bread.  I made cupcakes with it and added miniature chocolate chips to some of the cupcakes.  You don't really need frosting with this cake.  It's plenty sweet and flavorful enough by itself.

I thought this was okay, but nothing special.  I read other reviews and decided to use 2/3 c. sour cream instead of milk and lemon juice.  I used 2 large bananas and baked in 2-9" layer pans.  I didn't think it had a strong enough banana flavor.

Great cake!  I used a yellow cake mix and baked in a bundt pan for about 44 minutes.  I used the peanut butter glaze on this site to frost.  Great combination - peanut butter and banana!  Family loved this one.

Every year I host Christmas Eve for my husband's family, and every year I get at least one request for this cake.  I make this in 8" round pans and ice with a homemade cream cheese frosting.  It's definitely a family favorite.

Delicious, moist and amazing! The right amount of everything! I love that you can use cake mix to speed things up. I used a yellow cake mix that I had on hand. It would be good with a spice cake mix. I used the banana butter icing recipe from this website and it was a hit at our family reunion! I made this a week ago and I'm already craving it again! :)

This was pretty good, but not my favorite. A lot of reviewers said 3 bananas, and for me, 3 made it too mooshy. I think if I were to make again, I’d use 2, but just make sure they were super over-ripe. I would also maybe add a bit of baking powder, as this was rather flat and ugly looking. And maybe use unsalted butter. Normally, I am a salt fiend, and I like to use salted butter when baking, because I like the sweet/salty combo, but this tasted like salty bananas, a little. Anyway... I’m going to give the full on homemade banana cake a try, and see if it’s worth the effort.

Since I always bake from scratch and turn my nose up at box cakes,I was sure this one would also be another failure.  Boy, was I wrong!! I added one extra small banana and topped it with cream cheese icing (neufchatel, really).  Baked it for exactly 35 min, turned out nice, moist, flavorful, quite good, no strange chemical flavor.  I can't believe this came from a mix!  I will definitely be making this again! Many thanks.

Perfect, exactly what I was looking for.  A quick, tasty, moist cake, that is much easier to make than banana bread.  I used 4 very ripe bananas and they worked, however I may use 3 next time since it was just a *bit* too moist.

Good cake-- very moist and flavorful.  I subbed the same amount of sour cream for the lemon juice/milk mixture and added about 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  Made a quick caramel frosting found elsewhere on this site for the top and got great reviews.  Will make this again.

This was fantastic. I now have to make it for my mother and my husband every year for their birthdays. I used three bananas, and instead of caramel frosting, I combined   vanilla and cream cheese frosting, then topped with some shredded coconut. Delicious!

Fast and easy. Very good, moist cake. Made it as directed except substituted 1/2 cup egg substitute and 1 whole egg for the 3 eggs. Also made it as a bundt cake, had to cook 10 minutes longer. I frosted it with cream cheese frosting. Will definitely make it again.

This cake came out very moist and tasty. I think I should have stuck with making it in the 13x9 though rather than the 2 round cake pans I used as they fell apart when I took them out of the pan. It is a very moist cake though, flavorful and pairs well with cream chesse frosting.

EXCELLENT Recipe!  I went ahead and used buttermilk instead of the lemon juice/milk combo.  Was very moist and very yummy.  I went with the caramel idea but instead just melted a bag of caramels with some water and poured it on.  Served it with whipped cream.  Wonderful!

I loved this easy cake, and so did all the people in my office.  I didn't change anything, and put a simple powdered sugar frosting on it.

I’m not usually crazy about cake! My friends favorite cake is banana nut, so I found this' added the 2 teaspoons vanilla, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg and pecans, oh, and used sour cream instead of milk and fresh lemon. ( others suggestions). Well, it’s delicious!!! I’m even making it for my birthday next month!

My husband and I loved this cake! We had a lot of bananas and eggs so thought we'd try it. We were trying to figure out what what type of frosting, or glaze to put on. We decided we liked it just as it was, maybe put a little whipped cream on it tonight. 
I only added another egg, and another banana, and baked it for about 10 minutes longer. GREAT!!
It will be one of our favorites!!

This was a wonderful and easy cake to make!  I had some bananas I wanted to use and found this recipe.  I made a simple glaze with just powder sugar, milk and vanilla and it was perfect, very moist.  It did fall and I am not sure why but that will not keep me from making it again.  It falling did not take away from the end results. If you have a potluck and you want something different but good, this works.  I made if for my neighbors and they all loved it! I WILL be making this again. Maybe I will add in some pecans or walnuts.

Delish! We made it for Mother's Day, and it was amazing! Quick and simple. Made it as directed with 2 very ripe bananas, in a bundt pan. Iced with a vanilla glaze. May try sprinkling a handful of chocolate chips into the batter next time.

I made this over the weekend and will absolutely make it again. I used a Duncan Hines Butter Recipe cake mix and three small bananas. I frosted it with Bourbon Cream Cheese frosting (also from this site). The resulting cake disappeared faster than any in recent memory. The only thing my husband was disappointed about was that I didn't add nuts. I think I'll try adding some walnuts for him next time, not that this cake needs it.

Very good, moist, and easy.  I used a yellow cake mix because that is what I had and it was yummy.  I didn't even frost it.   Baked it in a fluted tube pan for approx 36 minutes.

I've made this cake a few times and it is soooo delicious!!!  I increased the amount of bananas because I love cakes with a rich banana flavor and used store bought chocolate icing because I didn't have time to make my own.  I also top it with crushed walnuts.  This cake is moist and one of the best recipes I've ever gotten from this site.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  Enjoy :)

Had guests over toniht and had RAVE reviews...very moist. I drizzled vanila glaze over and used buttermilk to replace the milk and lemon juice mixture, also used a vanilla cake mix because that's all I had on hand. Will make again for sure,good way to use up bananas instead of the same old banana bread.

This was a very moist, flavorful, and easy to make cake. Many people raved about it. The only thing I did different was making a cream cheese frosting from 1 pkg. cream cheese, 1\4 cup melted margarine, 1 tsp. vanilla, and about 4 cups of powdered sugar, enough to get it thick. Very good.

For those who need to leave out citrus, use buttermilk.  The acid from the lemon juice added to the milk actually make buttermilk.  This is an old *recipe* for buttermilk, so either will work.

Fantastic recipe!  I did not change ONE thing about the recipe!!!  Baked it as a bundt cake.  The moistest cake I have EVER had!  Not heavy like a bread, not super sweet like a cake.  No icing.  Absolutely delicious:)

I have been using this recipe for about 3 years. The only thing I do differently is elimate the lemon juice and substitute 1 cup buttermilk for the milk. I top it with cream cheese icing (1 stick butter, 1 pkg. cream cheese, 1 tsp. vanilla, and 4 c. powdered sugar). This cake is a hit everywhere I take it. I even get requests to bring it to parties. A very moist and delicious cake. It's my hubby's favorite dessert. Thank you!!

The flavor was amazing. Really nice banana flavor. The texture, however, was a bit too "light" for my preference. Indicative of a boxed cake mix.  I might use this again to give to someone when I need a quick recipe, (it was well received by friends!) but in general, I'll make my scratch version, adding an extra banana and a tipple of lemon juice.

this was perfect, exactly what we were looking for! it has very nice flavor... it was also simple to make which was fun. i ended up layering it with fresh whip cream and sliced bananas and everyone at our party loved it:-) can't wait to make it again.

This was pretty good, but did not have enough banana flavor for me.  I will probably look for another recipe

I tried to make this cake twice now and both times it collapsed.  It has a really good flavor and texture though.  I was planning on frosting it but didn't so we ended up just eating it plain.

I thought it fell because maybe I used a cake mix with pudding in it, so the second time I used one without and it still collapsed.

Great recipe - good banana flavor and very moist (almost too moist for me, but people at work raved about the cake.) I used a yellow cake mix and drizzled it with a mix of lemon juice and powdered sugar. People loved this cake!

We made this cake for a family get together this weekend and it was so good!  We used three bananas instead of two and added pecans to the batter.  We cooked it in a bundt pan, increasing the baking time by about 10 minutes.  When it was cooled, I drizzled it with Fat Free Caramel Ice Cream topping and chopped up pecans.  I had three people ask for the recipe that night.  We already went to the store and bought more bananas to start rippening so we can make it again!

It is a good cake. A little moist but a very good way to finish up those blackening bananas. I also add about half cup of chopped walnuts and it comes out really good.

According to my mom, "These are the best cupcakes I have ever tasted!" and my dad also had high praises for them, even though he does not have a real sweet tooth.  I used vanilla frosting, because I couldn't find a caramel one in the store, and didn't want to make one, but to me, they tasted even better plain.  Delicious!

I made this recipe as a Sunday School snack and it was all the rave, everyone wanted the recipe!!  Turned out great, really moist and simple.  I made a few changes:  left out the lemon juice, I didn't want a lemony taste, threw in a half a banana more, an extra teaspoon of vanilla and a little cinnamon...also, I had to cook it a good 10-15 minutes longer than directed and it was still super moist.  Thanks!

Fabulous recipe!!!  I didn't have a box of butter cake mix, so I used a yellow cake mix.  It was great!!  I used one of the suggestions to serve with a cream cheese frosting, so I found one on Allrecipes and it was very good.  I used a bundt pan and had to cook it about 20 minutes longer.  This one is a keeper.

I LOVE this recipe. The cake came out really moist. I served this with some vanilla ice cream. I took some to work for my co-workers. Let just say there wasn't a crumb left. I gave this recipe to my mother and she can't wait to try it out for herself. I will definitely make this again and again.

This is an awesome banana cake.  It's nice that it's now just another banana "bread".  Not heavy or dark. I use the old cream cheese frosting and my husband likes it that way.  But I'm gonna search for a Caramel frosting this time.  thanks Beth!

Simple, great way to use up ripe bananas.  Nice, "homey" flavor despite the mix base.  I baked in 2 loaf pans so I could freeze one.  Didn't need icing it was so moist- maybe add chopped nuts next time.

I love finding great cakes that start with a mix and this is one of them, very good!  I did use the caramel icing as suggested and everyone scraped it off including me, I think next time I'll just make the cake with a very light dusting of powdered sugar.  Also, I did add an extra banana, so I'll just keep it a 3 since that worked out just fine.

My family is a comprised of chocoholics, so I didn't know how this cake was going to fly with them.  It turns they (and I) loved it!!  It is incredibly moist, easy to assemble, and delicious.  I used "homemade buttermilk" where you put a tablespoon of lemon juice or white vinegar in a measuring cup and add milk to the one cup line, since I don't keep buttermilk on hand.  It worked perfectly and I will make this cake again and again.
