We thought this was great! I added a chopped green pepper, chopped mushrooms, triple the amount of garlic and a lot of extra seasonings. I served this with a side salad and garlic bread. Easy and delicious! I really liked the cheddar cheese on it too.

This dish was delicious! My entire family and picky neighbor really enjoyed it. I followed the recipe almost entirely. The only thing I changed was subbing the ground beef for ground venison as we have an abundance of it and adding a little more salt and some garlic powder to it after it was completed. Great dish that we will have again soon!

Excellent recipe as listed. I can see it being done with sausage or adapted with peppers to a more Mexican flavor. A did add a little sugar to sweeten the tomato sauce, increased the garlic to 3 cloves, and added 1/2 chopped bell pepper. Lots of possibilities with this one.

This was SO easy to throw together! And I had most of the ingredients inside my pantry already, which made getting dinner on the table for the kids incredibly quick and tasty. In the future, I will make sure to have the noodles completely done before I started browning the meat so that everything could come together much faster - I tried to boil the water while I cooked the meat and was waiting around forever for it to happen! Lol

We enjoyed this on a cold night. It's a little too tomato-y so I would adjust if I made it again. I would add some onion and more cheese.

Great casserole for a cold winter night. This easy dish incorporates big, bold flavors like beef, onion and tomato, and combines them with perfectly cooked noodles. If you're hungry for lasagna, but don't want to spend the time, trouble or money, this is a fast, easy and economical option. Very good! (Used No Yolks Extra Broad Noodles.)

Doubled this last minute delicious meal. In addition to the original recipe I added basil , old bay seasoning, and a large jar of mild salsa to the ground beef. Baked it in a 9x13 for the same time period.  Can't wait to taste the leftovers!!!

Good stuff. Doubled everything. Used fresh tomatoes from the garden, blended to sauce. So it was a bit watery but left out the extra added water and put the noodles into the bottom of the casserole dish dry and baked for about 5 min longer, they came out tender and perfect... tasted like gold-plated miracle food. Best casserole of the next ten years.

Made it with a full jar of Rao’s marinara sauce, substituted it with mozzarella cheese and doubled the amount of egg noodles to 2 cups. It was like a lazy mans lasagna and my boys loved it and said it was a “keeper”.Fed 4 of us with a decent amount left over (we had broccoli as a side dish). Easy and yummy!!

Added to family favorites. I like it because it's easy to prepare. The family likes it because it's very tasty. Added some tomatoes with chilies for extra flavor.

This was super easy and quite good. It doesn’t have a ton of flavor, but that would be an easy fix. This is a great quick recipe for a busy family that everyone would enjoy.

Instead of all the "seasonings" I used "better than Bullion", vegatable type and added it as I was browning the meat and I added salt and pepper to taste. I really wanted a little more than tomatoe sauce, hamburger and noodles. I looked for a carrot,green bean and potatoe mix but could only find green beans and potatoes in ham juice. I drained off the juice and added everything together and baked it as instructed. Between just my husband and myself, we ate half of yhe casserole dish I had made it in.

This was good! It reminded me of baked spaghetti, just with different noodles. I did add more of the spices than it called for, used garlic powder because I never have fresh garlic on hand. Next time I’m going to use a little less water and add in some Italian spice mix.

Great simple recipe!! As other reviewers suggested, I was more generous with the seasoning by using double than what the recipe called for. Also, I excluded adding more water prior to to the casserole as I felt it would have made it soupy. It came out great.

My family loves it with some changes, first I have big eaters. So I up the ground meat to 1 1/2 pounds and increase the egg noodles to 12 ounces. Brown ground meat alone, after draining add one medium onion chopped 3 to 4 cloves garlic 1 teaspoon oregano, 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Cook noodles stir them in. Then instead of tomato sauce ( delicate stomaches) I use 2 cans tomato soup a touch of water. Stir in about a third of a cup Parmesan. put in casserole dish top with mozzarella and a little more Parmesan and bake. They generally devour in one night maybe some leftovers for next day. Love this recipe and everything one can do with it,

This is cheap and easy, it rocks. Like everyone else you add your favorites.. and yes Mom made it too in 72 lol. 
We doubled the seasoning and tripled the garlic.
We added half of an orange pepper because we had it. Pennsylvania Dutch Egg Noodles and had Mexican blend cheese.
Much  healthier than Hamburger Helper and you have control of the ingredients.
Taking it to Women's Bible Study because it's that good

Very poor recipe, extremely bland. I would never make this again.. the only thing that saved this was using extra cheese on top. I would not recommend this to anyone. There are far better recipes out there for this type of dish.

Not flavorful as written. Even adding extra spices as other reviewers recommended didn't help much. My family all said this was a no go for future meals.

What a great twist on the boring baked ziti. I used 1lb of ground beef and 1/2 lb of spicy pork sausage, sautéed with two cloves of garlic and 1/4 cup minced (dry) onions, along with the oregano and salt and pepper. After draining the meat mixture, I added in a jar of spicy marinara sauce and a cup of beef broth. Before adding in the egg noodles I tossed the mixture with grated parmesan and mozzarella cheese. After placing in the baking dish I added in more of the Italian cheeses, stirred, then topped with shredded Colby-cheddar mix. My hubby who has a strong dislike for ground beef loves this dish! It's definitely going on the list of "quick, go to" dinners! Next time I may add in ricotta cheese.

I excluded the water and added more tomato sauce.  I had a couple of small zucchini and added it to the dish and it was delicious.  I increased the amount of garlic to 3 cloves.

I thought it was excellent.  I have to say though, it is pizza flavored hamburger helper.  Which I'm ok with because I love hamburger helper, just don't like feeding it to my family because of the preservatives and salt.  My husband didn't like the seasoning but he literally likes nothing, so....

It's great, but it needs lots more stuff to make it not taste bland
-I doubled the seasonings and used 2 garlic cloves instead of the one
-added Italian seasoning and Worcestershire sauce to the meat
-When combining all of the ingredients I added a little milk and butter. 
-used a small bag of Mexican Four Cheese
Hope this helps!

This turned out to be pretty tasty.  I just left out the onions.  Used onion powder instead.  Used grass fed beef which I'm hooked on now.  It is so tender.  I would make this again.  I prefer egg noodles over spagetti.  Served with garlic/cheese toast.  I did mix the cheese in with the sauce, and some on top prior to baking.  Baked 20 min.

I liked it, hubby didn't. He said the dish was missing something.  I did add salt, pepper and Italian seasoning. I also sauteed onions and green peppers along with the meat. Before turning it into the casserole dish, I added fresh asiago cheese. I don't know what else I could've added to make it better for hubby.....guess I won't be making it again.

This was pretty good, but really bland.  I added a clove of garlic, doubled the oregano, and added black pepper.  Next time I plan on omitting the water and will add an extra can of tomato sauce.

I did make some changes as i read the reviews and most reported it needed more seasonings, and my house loves their seasonings. The boys like it I however thought it was blandish and I more than tripled most seasonings. I used fresh garlic, fresh onion and added basil.

Super easy, super bland. Even after doubling some things and adding garlic salt, I still had to salt and pepper the bejesus out of it to get any flavor at all. I don't know that I'd make this again.

I love this recipe! I never knew it was an actual recipe from No Yolks! My mom made this all the time when I was growing up and it's a family favorite now in our house. The only difference is I just season the meat with salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste and use a can of condensed tomato soup instead of tomato sauce. My mom would chop up about a half of a bell pepper and onion and after the meat was done browning and I've started adding in a can of corn too...juice and all.

Cheesy, gooey yumminess!  After reading other reviews commenting the  tomato taste was a bit much, I used organic boxed creamy tomato soup instead of the tomato sauce. Added a little crushed red pepper flakes to cook with the garlic and onion after the ground beef had browned.  This turned out so nice!  My husband said this was to be put on the please make again list.

Very Good Recipe. Would drain ground beef, cook onion separately, then add everything after draining meat.

I thought it was good, easy, and different enough from lasagne or spaghetti! The only thing I changed, was added some mozzarella cheese with the cheddar, next time I would stir the cheese in, and add extra on top!

Perfect quick meal on a busy night. I had all the ingredients in my home which made it even more simple. The egg noodles made it a lighter meal than using spaghetti. Definitely will be making again.

really good and quick. Needed to add a little salt once dished up, also sprayed some Pam in the dish so it would be an easy clean up. Would definitely make it again.
