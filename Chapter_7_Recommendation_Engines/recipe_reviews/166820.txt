Hey, I submitted this recipe - what am I supposed to rate it?

But seriously, a couple notes from the guy who submitted this.  First, I happened to have made this last night and forgot the soy sauce until just before serving.  I have to say I liked it better WITHOUT it.  Something about the soy sauce took over some of the other flavors - particularly the sweetness.  I might recommend tasting before adding the soy sauce and if you like it, stop there.  

Secondly, if you cook with it - for example stir fry some chicken chunks with this sauce - the sweetness mysteriously goes away.  Better to add the sauce to already cooked food.  Despite the "use immediately" note, you can make this first and warm up quickly in the microwave just before plating - do it in as many 10 second runs as needed.

Wow, this was impressive. I actaully didnt make this recipe, but my hubby did. I served this on top of pan-fried snapper, and it complemented it very well. I didnt add the soy sauce like suggested. Thanks, I'll (or my husband) be making this often.

Jeff, you're right,  It's better without the soy sauce... grin.  You're recipe is so similar to what I make several times a week as a dipping sauce for sticky rice, that I saved it in my recipe box. Now my DH can make the sauce if I'm not able.  I don't measure.  Therefore, my recipe isn't really a "recipe", LOL.  You have done our family a great service...  Thank you!  P.S. - a teeny bit of shredded kaffir lime leaf adds a unique spark... you know... just for a little change-up now and then.

I couldn't find any spicy red chilies.  I substituted sweet red chilies so it would keep that dark red color.  I added crushed red pepper flakes reestablish the spicy kick that I had lost by using sweet chilies.  It worked well.  It was amazing served over grilled salmon.  Guests raved.

Good recipe.  Jeff, I read your profile, and if you're anything like me, you're probably checking up on your published recipe every day or so to see if anyone left a comment.  Well, here it is!  I love the sauce--chicken was my choice.

I love this recipe!  I am from New Mexico and had a ristra of dried red chilies I needed to use and thought how can I make my red sauce a little different then normal.  Here's what I did...I took about 20 dried red chilies, after shaking out the seeds and taking off the stems, soaked them in hot water for about 20 minutes.  Then rinsed.  Put them in a pot of boiling water for about 40 minutes.  Took out the chilies and put them into a food processor with 3 cups of the chili water and blended it until it was pulp like.  Put the mixture into a big fry pan and added the garlic, vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce and brown sugar (amounts not measured) and cooked it until it boiled.  Then I put the mixture back into the food processor with the lime juice (a half of a lime), cilantro and green onion and blended it until it was smooth.  LOVE THIS RECIPE!  I'm making Pasole tomorrow and will use this as my base mix.  Thanks so much for sharing and all the great comments.

This sounds really good (LOVE cilantro) and am anxious to try it, but there are so many different types of  red chili peppers ranging in heat (from very mild to off the charts) and size (very small, 2 1/2",  to very large, 8"), that your  recipe can have hugely different results based on what type/size of peppers you use.  Can you tell us what type/size you used in your recipe?  Thanks, Jeff!
