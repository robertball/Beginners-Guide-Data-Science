I love Pool Hall Slaw, although my recipe differs somewhat because I do not like the sweetness the sugars add. I increase the yellow mustard to about 5cups and delete the sugar. It is still very delicious on burgers, hot dogs, vegetables and other sandwiches, but without the sweetness.

I liked this slaw, but I like vinegary foods.   It was too bitter for the rest of the family.

I was looking for a signature relish for my hot dog truck and found this recipe.  I followed the recipe to the tee and it turned out awesome.  This recipe is supposed to be the recipe used for Slawsa.  I had to check and see if they tasted the same.  After purchasing some Slawsa and doing the taste test, we decided that this recipe was better than the Slawsa.  I will be using this recipe for my slaw dogs on the hot dog truck.m
