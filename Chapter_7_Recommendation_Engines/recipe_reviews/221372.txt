This is super simple and delicious! I usually use 1/2 of everything in this recipe and it fits perfectly into my 1-1/2 qt. slow cooker. I also like to sub salsa for the Rotel more often than not b/c I always have salsa on hand. This is also nice b/c when you have leftover taco meat that you don't know what to do with, you can freeze it, and make this dip practically at a moments notice! I also stir it every so often, so it melts/combines evenly. This is a hit w/ everyone who tries it! :)

Made exactly as recipe says, but it was very soupy.  I will make it again omitting milk and draining the rotel.  I may also add more cheese.  The flavor was great, but I was hoping for dip rather than soup.    I will return to rate it after making the changes.

too much rotel tomatoes.  It was very runny.  Also, very spicy and i used the mild version of rotel.  I think it would have been much better with only 2 cans of rotel, and another 4 ounces of cheese, but I believe in rating a recipe by the ORIGINAL recipe to give an honest review.

It was a very popular appetizer dish. Portions are correct for around 10 people. I added fresh jalapenos and yellow & purple onions for extra texture and flavor. I added both to the beef mix on the stove top.

I have been looking for a recipe that was very close to one served in one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Dallas, TX and this is it.  I made this last night for a group of friends before heading out to our local Mexican restaurant and boy what this a hit.  I thought I made way to much but that was not the case. They ate so much of this dip we almost skipped dinner. It takes 20 minutes to prepare and cook. I will ensure I always keep these ingredients on hand in our panty. You can heat it up with hot spices for those who like it hot.

I reduced this recipe to 4 servings, so I used 1/2 lb ground beef,  4 oz cheese.  one can of Rotel.  Instead of adding milk I added about 2 ounces cream cheese.  
This is so easy and tasty too.

I omit the milk and use 1 can of original Rotel when making for a group or 1 can of hot Rotel when just for the family.  This is more of a dip.  Left overs are great on a baked potato or as nachos.
