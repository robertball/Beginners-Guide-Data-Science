I have made these quite a few times and keep forgetting to rate them.  I have used regular fries, texas fries, curly fries (and so on) and always add some seasoned salt, pepper and occasionally some blackened seasoning. I like to serve them with a mixture of sour cream and hidden valley ranch (spicy ranch) dressing and some franks red hot.  Quick and easy!

Just made these, they were awesome! Added some soul seasoning to the fries (always do) and some chili powder. Use bacon bits instead of regular bacon. Left out the onion b.c my son doesn't care for them. Served them with sour cream and hidden valley ranch ranch seasoning mixed together. Will make again!

These are great.  I've found that if you deep fry them they don't get soggy.  Also it is hard to find the right ranch.  Your best bet is to make your own.  Ranch Dressing II from this site is good.

I had no business making or eating these, but what the heck, the rules go out the window for football Sunday apps!  ;)  I used thick steak fries, and seasoned with some sea salt and pepper before adding the other ingredients and broiling.  Sooo good~ we all enjoyed!

These were awesome! I used seasoned french fries and sprinkled a little bit of season salt on it. I fried the fries and placed them in the oven until the cheese melted. My entire family loved it. Of course I made to much and had to throw some away. That was the hardest part for me (I at to much hope it doesn't go to my thighs ;-D ). I also left out the onions. And they turned out great. This is a keeper!!!! Thanks

The only thing I did differently was to season the fries before I put them into the oven.  They were very good and the kids loved them.  I will be making again!

I have been making these for years!!! I like to fry them up 1st and then place them in the oven with the cheese and bacon just enough to melt, then add on the onions. I also serve them with sour cream and jalapenos!!! The best way to eat fries, but the worst for you!!! :)

My husband and I have been making these for years, except we call it 'heart-attack on a plate'. I like to season the fries with a pack of dry Ranch seasoning before cooking. We also make these with sour cream & jalapeno slices on top instead of Ranch flavor. :)

This is the recipe that my 16 year-old daughter chose to make today.  It was so easy that she was able to make it herself.  Unfortunately, she also almost ate it all by herself, not wanting to share with the rest of us.  What's not to like - fries, bacon, and cheese.  A rich treat for a snack today.

Great recipe that was a hit with my snack-loving hubby. We both agreed that this was a great recipe as-is, and also made for a great chili-cheese fries receipe too with the addition of a bit of leftover homemade chili.

This was really good. Simple, can't believe I never thought of it before. Didn't have green onions, so just omitted them. Will make again and again - used reduced fat cheese and 'real' bacon bits.

mmm mmm.. fries, cheese and bacon, what could be better? i use a jack blend cheese as it melts the easiest but still has a lot of flavor. i use a slightly easier method of cooking the fries then layering them on a plate alternating fries and cheese then microwaving them until the cheese is melted. a lot less messier than trying to get the melted cheese off the baking sheet and onto a plate and taste the same. then we add the bacon. so good!

We love these!  Try adding 1/2 package of Taco seasoning to a small bottle of Ranch Dressing for the dipping sauce, gives a little extra kick.

These were so ridiculously easy and good that I don't even know what to say? We typically eat pretty healthy however a nice treat like this is just what I need after a long stressful week. I used the bacon for a crowd recipe from this site and baked it all together (seperate cookie sheets) and everything was done at the same time with virtually no mess. My only change is that I didn't have quite enough cheddar and so I just added some mexi-blend. What a great comfort food. Thanks!

I really enjoyed these! The only this I changed about the recipe was the fries. I did not use frozen fries. I made my own steak fries using baking potatoes. They turned out great! We used fat free Hidden Valley Ranch for dip. I will definitely make again, but next time, I will probably bake the fries. Thanks!

While i haven't tried this particular recipe, i have made a variation of it for years, using melted Velveeta cheeze sauce drizzled over the fries, then topped with bacon! It is a heart attack on a platter, but delicous!

My family will eat fast food french fries no problem, but when it comes to home baked there's always a bunch that gets thrown in the garbage.  Thought I would try this and for the first time ever - no leftovers! I just added sour cream on top instead of dressing - tasted just like a perogy lol.  Awesome recipe!

These were good, but I would recommend seasoning the fries very lightly.  Otherwise, they're a bit bland where the toppings didn't land.  However, the topping and the fries were a hit!

We liked these. I used turkey bacon, which I cooked using "Bacon for a Family or a Crowd" from this site, which yields perfectly flat bacon. Which means it didn't crumble :( So I had to tear my bacon, which was ok, just a little greasy to do! We found that we preferred to mix Frank's RedHot sauce into our Ranch dressing than to eat them with just Ranch. ALSO, a note to anyone using the Shopping List feature from AR: this recipe doesn't add Ranch dressing to your shopping list, so don't forget to write it in :) I didn't realize and we wound up having to go buy Ranch at the last minute! Thanks for the recipe, it's not something I'd make other than special occasions, but as this was a birthday, it was a great treat!

I love cheese fries or chili cheese fries. Here's an additional idea.
Cook fries anyway you like, put in metal baking pan,top with shredded cheddar cheese and cooked chopped bacon..heat in toaster oven or reg oven til cheese melts.  Here's the great part..break off a piece of oohy goodness and dip in Lite House brand Dilly dip/salad dsg.  It's not a light dsg that's just the name, and it takes you right to cheese fry heaven!

I luv these! I had something similar to these in Idaho and they were called Idaho nachos.  Instead of cheddar cheese, they used a combination of mozzarella and monterey jack cheese and chopped up green onion. They were served with sour cream.  Regardless, they were delicious.

I make something very similar to this, but when the fries come out of the deep fryer I have some cheese sauce (found in my chip isle beside the salsa) and some sour cream, then I top with bacon bits, chopped tomatoes and green onions. Ohhhhh so yummy!

I had these at this bar called Chicago Loop a while back; they called them S.O.B Fries (but they didn't have green onion on them). They are so addictive!

just made these and they were spectacular! a huge hit! will definitely be making these again! they taste fine without the onions, i couldn't add them because we didn't have them... all in all, this is a fantastic recipe for anyone who likes fries, cheese, and bacon, especially the three combined! :)

I love plain cheese fries, but these are the best!  I always use Mozz cheese, however.

Will definitely make again.. I let my husband buy the fries and he didn't get the really good fries that I like, but even with the substandard ones he bought this was good with mini sliders!

Very good and oh so yummy!!! When my hubs and I dine at Chili's, we often order the Texas cheese fries appetizer because we love it so much. If you add pickled (sliced) jalapenos to this, you can create a spot on (economical) copycat without leaving your home! Although I enjoyed this as is, I did find it necessary to add more cheese. Since all I had handy was a Monterey Jack-cheddar blend, that's what I used. I layered as directed and then topped everything with an additional cup of cheese (i.e. the "additional" cheese). I like to use restaurant-style fries, but you can use whatever kind you like. For an AWESOME dip, try mixing Ranch dressing with a Southwest seasoning blend (to taste). Thanks for sharing! :-)
