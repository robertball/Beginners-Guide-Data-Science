This one is A KEEPER! I have been searching for the perfect banana bread/muffin recipe for years, and I have finally found it. For those of you who may be thinking "Mayonnaise! What???" do not fear, there is no residual mayonnaise taste in these muffins whatsoever. If you think about it, mayo is really just egg whites and vinegar, which often appear together in cake recipes. And these are very cake-y indeed. Even my banana-phobic brother in law couldn't get enough of these. Also, to the reviewer who found the recipe not liquid-y enough, something must have gone horribly wrong. You do have to make sure that you choose bananas that are past their prime, they'll break down into liquid and sugar better/faster. Also, the mayo makes this recipe a little more "sticky" than the typical quickbread batter. Just go with it, you won't be sorry.

Mix the bananas and mayo together first, then add the dry ingredients. I made it in my KitchenAide mixer - VERY moist - no need to add any other liquid. Oh, delicious!! I'll definitely make again!

these are easily the best banana muffins I've ever made. I generally don't keep real mayo, so I usually have my kids make the muffins after I make the mayo. I didn't realize the recipe was backward until after I had already went on autopilot and done it the way I usually do, adding dry to wet ingredients. I have also made these with just under a cup of pumpkin puree instead of the bananas, adding a bit of pumpkin pie spice, and it was still wonderful! Great recipe.

there is no liquid in this recipe therefore it was floury and wouldn't mix in - I had to add 1 cup of milk.  I did not care for this recipe at all.

These muffins are the answer to my over-ripened bananas!  I used mayo with olive oil and sub'd brown sugar for the white.  They came out so delicious and moist!  No need for added liquid; as stated in previous reviews, mash the bananas and mayo and then add the dry ingredients.  I think next time I'll sub quinoa flour for the all-purpose to give it a more nutty-earthy flavor and perhaps add some walnuts.

The title doesn't lie...these are absolutely delicious and so moist!  The mayonnaise is a great trick, cannot taste at all and definitely adds to the moisture level.  I too combined the bananas and mayo first then stirred in dry ingredients and it worked perfectly.  Added a teaspoon of vanilla also.  I got 18 muffins out of this and they only took about 15 minutes in my oven.  Got rave reviews from everyone!

Good recipe! Soooo moist that they were a little sticky. I recommend leaving them in a little longer than 20 minutes. That being said, I still ate 6 muffins this evening after making them. I also added some crushed walnuts and copious amounts of chcolate chips. I doubled the recipe and it made 36 good sized muffins.

I just made these and they are easy and delicious.  I added nuts and chocolate chips.  I followed the advice of mashing the bananas & mayo first, then added the dry ingredients.  It was the perfect consistency.  I also got 18 muffins out of the 12 muffin recipe.

These were wonderful!  As the other reviewers have said I mixed the bananas and the mayo(actually light miracle whip) together first and then I added to the dry ingredients.  It was a bit dry still so I added justm a touch of milk and then it was perfect.  SOOO moist.  Definetly a keeper!

Sooooo good! I added a teaspoon of vanilla and used 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white. Even my son loves them, and he doesn't usually eat banana breads. Thanks for the great recipe.

I'm not a huge fan of Mayo, and I'm sure they don't taste like mayo, but I just can't stomach the look or smell of it! Maybe it's the baby in my belly making it worse but I've changed it up a bit. Instead of mayo I used 3/4cup of sour cream and 1/4 greek yogurt. I added tblspn of cinnamon and 1/2 tblspn of nutmeg. and a teaspn of Vanilla. They are Aweeeesommmmeee!!!! Just what the baby ordered!

I chose this recipe because the mayonnaise in it made it sound intriguing.

I started out, intending to make it exactly as described, because I'm not keen on reviewing a recipe after I've changed it.

But when I got halfway through, I found out my mayo had expired, and I was suddenly left with half-finished muffins.  So I looked up mayo substitutes, and found a website that said you can use applesauce.

So I swapped out the mayo for applesauce.  I used a 1:1 ratio, and mixed it with the banana before adding to the dry ingredients.  It did come out rather thick for a muffin batter, so I also added a splash of milk to thin it to a nice muffin-y consistency.  Nowhere near the 1 cup someone else mentioned.  I also added about 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, just because I could.

I'm still giving it 5 stars.  The bottom part was a little on the chewy side, but that could have been the applesauce.  They were, regardless of the changes, exellent muffins!!

And as an added bonus:  I had about 1/2 cup batter remaining after I filled my muffin cups, so I set it aside and fed it to my 8-month old as a treat!  (I didn't use the optional chocolate chips)

First time made the recipe as stated. Second time I use LOW fat mayo and I substitute 1 cup of whole wheat flour, and they where as good as before. Give it a try!

Excellent! add cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla ,dried berries and raisons to the batter, then sprinkle generous amount of white sugar on tops before you put in the oven.  They were great and the dried fruits & spices all went nicely together with the choco chips! trust the other reviews, they rose nicely even without the eggs and you could not taste a mayonaise flavor at all, promise! :) **update:  1 cup of canned pumpkin instead of  bananas was wonderful! super moist! cooked at 400* 20 minutes- also, i rarely have chocolate chips on hand and we don't even miss them in this recipe!

I have made these a few times now. They are moist, tasty and oh so quick and easy to make. If you first mix sugar, mayo and bananas, and let it sit for 10 minutes, while you get the dry ingredients together, there will be plenty of liquid to work with, without any dryness.

If you hate doing dishes like I do then these are for you! They're quick, and DELICIOUS! Even my picky husband loved them... I made them yesterday and he took the last 3 in his lunch today. My advice- double the recipe to make them last because these will disappear FAST!
Great Recipe! A definate keeper!

I just made these and they are very easy and very good. The key is to mix bananas and mayo, then add to dry ingredients. There will be no need for added moisture. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup white flour to add to the nutritional value. Also, I used low-fat mayo and it didn't seem to affect the taste or moistness. However, I found them just a tad bit sweet. I think that I will cut the sugar to 3/4 cup rather than 1 cup and use brown sugar instead. These muffins are great when you don't have a lot of ingredients on hand.

These are amazing...
I used 5 small brown bananas and added a tsp of vanilla.Also I used the electric hand mixer to mash the bananas because it was way faster than doing it by hand.They are sooo yummy and moist, I made a loaf and the edges where my favorite! 
*It took 40 min to cook in the loaf pan

I just got done making these muffins and I must say this recipe is a keeper. Thanks to many suggestions, I mixed the mayo & bananas together then folded in the dry ingredients slowly. I also added some cinnamon & nutmeg because I just love them in my pastries. I never would've thought about including mayo in muffins, but this was a pleasant surprise. After the 20 min suggested baking time, I moved the muffins to the top rack of the stove for another 2 mins to give them a more golden brown color. Because these turned out so well, I feel like a true confectionist ? I know my husband will love these. Thank you scholzy for sharing this delectable recipe!

Great recipe! I tried it a second time and substituted half can of pumpkin for bananas. I have one child that doesn't Ike bananas. Added some appropriate pumpkin spices and It came out just as moist and delicious! Thanks for this recipe, recommend it!

Completely awesome!! I baked them in a dark pan so I set the temperature to 350F, and added a grated, finely peeled apple.  Yum!

Best muffin recipe ever!  Exactly as written, no changes.  However I have a vitamix  and am always looking for ways to use it so I mixed the bananas And mayonaise in the vitamix.  This recipe is a keeper!

These are soooo good with and without chocolate chips!  Mayonnaise is made with eggs and oil so when mixed with the bananas, there is plenty of liquid.  My new favorite recipe!  Thanks so much.

Ohmigosh!  These wound up being INCREDIBLE. I also want to add, that I think they were at their best on day 2. They didn't taste so great right out of the oven, but once they cooled completely...YUMMY!  I added a splash of extra milk because most of the previous reviews suggested it. I was hesitant at first to do so, because the batter looked "moist" enough already (maybe because I used larger bananas?). But, it wound up being the right decision.  My husband is rather skeptical of my baking skills because I've had a few things not turn out so well, however, he gave his thumbs up on these.  Give these a try...you'll be glad you did!

Great recipe!!.... I did what others had suggested  and combined the mayonnaise, sugar and very ripe bananas.. beating lightly since it was easier then mashing by hand... then folded in the combined dry ingredients....(didn’t add chocolate chips and didn’t miss them).... I’m currently in Mexico and the mayo has lime juice added so to cover that possible flavour I added some cinnamon and a little nutmeg...   I don’t have muffin tins down here so baked it in an 8X11 Pyrex dish at approx 350 for about 40 minutes.... Will definitely be making this again.

These sound delicious, but why is it that no recipe for banana bread/muffins ever gives you the actual  cup measurement for the bananas?

Very moist, cake-like muffins! I skipped the chocolate chips and put walnuts instead and they came out super good! I bet they would be amazing with chocolate chips as well.

Delicious!  Probably the best tasting muffins I have made.  I made some changes to the recipe:  had only two bananas so used those and added in a 1/2 cup of diced strawberries. Instead of white sugar I used 1/2 cup coconut sugar and 1/2 cup honey.  Substituted a cup of the flour for 1/2 cup each of garbanzo bean flour and coconut flour and added two eggs and some coconut milk since coconut flour needs more moisture. Also finished by adding in protein powder, hemp seed, cinnamon and vanilla extract.  I know I made a lot of changes to the recipe but I wanted to show how you can get creative with such a great base recipe such as this one!

Great recipe!  Very moist muffins indeed!  I made a few minor changes to my taste.  I followed the other reviewers' advice and mixed the mashed bananas with the mayo first.  I then added 1 tsp of vanilla and the sugar and mixed until blended before adding the dry ingredients.  I also added a 1/4 tsp salt.  (I always add a little salt when I bake). I also baked my muffins for approx 22 min.  They were perfect!

I make this recipe in my stand mixer, blending the mayo & bananas first, then adding in the flour mixture.  It can't get easier than this, and the results are fantastic.  Every time I make these, my family and friends rave about them.  Mayo in cake recipes is the best!

Was searching for a quck, easy recipe to use up my overly ripe bananas. This is the absolute best banana muffin I've made! Crunchy on the outside and so super moist on the inside. I used mini chocolate chips...perfect!

I just made these. I had 2 bunches of banannas left so I doubled it. 4 stars because it wasn't mixing well in my kitchenaid mixer, into a batter. I added a cup and a half of milk to make into a batter. I added the choco chips and all that mayo. Very moist very good. My toddlers are eating them as we speak. 24 servings makes exactly 24 muffins and are nice and golden brown and bananna sweet in the middle. :)

Fantastic.  Very light and moist.  Will be the only recipe I use.  Would be nice with a little cinnamon.
Left out the chocolate chips because my baby can not eat them yet but they would be a nice addition.

Really good and really moist!  I took advice from other reviews and cut the sugar by almost half and added a bit more chocolate chips.  These muffins are huge!  I had to cook them 4 extra minutes in my oven for the centers to set.  Great recipe!!!

These are the best muffins EVER! I, too, mixed the dry ingredients together, the mayo, chips, and bananas together and then combined the two.  Every time I make these, people go CRAZY over how yummy and moist they are.  The key is mushy over-ripe bananas!  It's so easy too.  THANKS!

GREAT, easy recipe! I used whole wheat flour, turbinado sugar (which adds a funky, delicious crunchy-sweetness!), and added chopped walnuts, a teaspoon of vanilla and just a splash of almond milk, to make the batter a little easier to work with. 

The recipe makes HUGE muffins, if you're just making the recommended 12 (I ended up  having to bake about 30 minutes, not 20), but soooo moist, delicious and easy-peasy! Thanks for sharing!!!

Mixing the dry with the wet was REALLY difficult!  So I added in maybe 1/2 tbsp of heavy cream.  The result was wonderful.  I had to take stars off for the dryness but with a bit of liquid, it was SO yummy!!  Oh, I did substitute brown sugar for the white too.
Update 2017- made this several more times. It is very helpful to mix the mayo and bananas together. A little bit of liquid still helps. I've done brown and white sugar, but prefer Brown, with about 3/4 cup to cut down sweet factor. Otherwise works great! Update 2018 - I usually only make these if I run out of  eggs (i prefer all natural ingredients), but every time I use this recipe with a little bit of milk (and subbing brown sugar), the muffins are so light and fluffy!

I just made these and they are great. I halfed the recipe because I only had 11/2 bananas. I added a little more mayonaise and tsp of vanilla and a tsp of butter flavoring. They are so moist and flavorful will make them again for sure!! It made about 10 muffins.

Very tasty.  I did as suggested by other reviewers and mixed the bananas and mayo together first to help break down the bananas.  They turned out just great.  I think one reviewer got it just right when they said moistness depends on how ripe your bananas are, past the prime is better for moisture.  These were very tasty and are the fastest disappearing muffins in this house yet!  I will definitely make these again!

I know people hate it when you rate a recipe after making dozens of changes but this was a great base recipe that I adjusted to fit the pantry! My 2yr old was asking for muffins and all I had was one frozen banana and no eggs! I halved the recipe but still needed to make up the 1/2 banana so I added some frozen strawberries and thawed and mashed them with the banana. Since they were frozen they added a bit of moisture to the recipe. I mixed them with the mayo then added the dry ingredients. When I got to the baking soda I realized I was out so I just tripled the baking powder and it worked just fine.  I filled 22 mini muffins with 1/2 the recipe and baked at 350 (in a toaster oven) for 15 mins. They are SO good! I can't believe I just threw them together with what I had on hand!

These were FANTASTIC!  My kids loved them and keep asking me to make them again :) The only thing I did different is I didn't add the chocolate chips, but I'm sure they would've been good w/ them.  They were sooo moist and yummy, will definitely make them again!

The only things I added were a dash of vanilla, dash of almond extract and about a 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg.  This was one of the best recipes for nanny muffins I have ever had!  Thanks for sharing!! :)

Best banana muffins I have ever made. I didn't change anything, but I did have to add some time to make sure the centers were cooked. Delicious. Going to the store for bananas  so I can let them get very ripe and make this again.

Absolutely Awsome!! I will be making this recipe for years to come. The only thing I did different was add butterscotch chips with the chocolate chips that the recipe called for. As some have said before make sure you are using bannana that the skins have started to turn dark. I love that it doesn't call for a lot of ing.so it's very inexpensive to make for a large family!! ??

The easiest recipe ever for banana muffins.  I added a tsp of vanilla and mixed the bananas and mayo together before adding it to the dry mix.  Fluffy and moist, will definitely make again!

Omgoodness!! These little muffins were not only very simple and easy to make; but also quite delicious! I’ve made 2 batches of these muffins within one week (don’t judge) Lol! So, I wasn’t a huge fan of the chocolate chips . However, my child loved finding the ‘chocolate surprise’ in each muffin she ate. 
Also, don’t ask why, but I added about 2 tablespoons of buttermilk to each batch; I guess because I’ve always used buttermilk in previous banana bread recipes. Anyway, it was and is a winner in my recipe book! Thanks for sharing.

These were very moist and very tasty. The only change I made, was to add chopped walnuts. 
The reviewer who said that there was a problem, due to there being no liquid in the ingredients, obviously did not use bananas that were enough. When the bananas are ripe and mashed,  they are liquidy.

These muffins are so fantastic that I had to join All Recipes just so I could rate and comment. I've started buying bananas just so they can go "bad" and I can make these muffins. Everyone who has eaten them has also loved them and I was told by my sister-in-law's father that I should become a baker. These are the best banana muffins I've ever tasted, homemade or store bought. 


I like baking but I'm scared to really experiment because I'm poor. I'm wondering if I can use this recipe for cran orange muffins or apple cinnamon muffins, anything! I think the mayonnaise really makes a difference in how moist these are. I'm rambling... Just make these muffins, you won't be disappointed!!

I doubled the banana. The texture came out great. The flavor was pretty good, but I could definitely still taste the mayo, which I'm not a huge fan of.

I increased to 3/4 cup of chocolate chips, reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup, added 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon & 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg and sprinkled tops with just a bit of cinnamon sugar. OMG. ..these are so moist & delicious & a great recipe if you have run out of eggs! I will definitely make these again.

I wanted to make banana bread for my coworkers but I ran out of eggs and came home too late to go   to store. Desperate to find a eggless recipe I found this one and tweaked it just a little. I added teaspoon of vanilla extract , teaspoon of baking soda  and sprinkled the top with brown sugar.  It’s amazing.  thank you for this recipe 
5 stars !!!!!!! Very good!

I will make it again. Instead of using white I used brown sugar It was very moist. But the top looked a bit like bread. But pleasantly surprised. I mixed banana with mayo so idk if that's why it looked a bit oily. But overall great recipe. I made double the recipe but just 1 cup of sugar.  1 batch as muffin and the left over as a mini cake. Yummy with chunky chocolate and some with blueberries.

This recipe was awesome. I didn’t have enough mayo so I substituted quarter cup with banana milk. Also, I only had two bananas.  In addition, to my recipe I added a half a cup of blueberries and a half a cup of quick oats. Let me tell you, this is so delicious. Even with my adjustments this was a superb recipe. Thank you!!

I’ve struggled to get the right banana bread recipe that’s not just okay. This one’s the winner. Easy, quick, delicious. I made mostly mini-muffins for a snack time and had 46, but could have stretched to 48. Solid recipe. I needed to use 4 ripe, small bananas or lose them and the extra one may have made the difference with regards to the just right banana taste.

I made this as a banana bread and it was so good!  I did not even add any extras (like nuts) and it has been a favorite after school snack all week.  It is very moist and dense.  I liked the tip of mixing the bananas and mayo together before adding the dry ingredients.  I used half brown sugar and half white sugar.  I also added a few shakes of salt and cinnamon.  I will be making this again.

These were moist but firm, dense but not heavy, tasty and not at all oily or greasy!  This recipe goes to the top of my banana muffin recipe list!  I did substitute Splenda for the sugar at 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup, and it was plenty sweet.  I can see why one reviewer complained about the thickness of the batter, because mine was thick enough that I thinned it with a splash of milk, but I suspect that was because I only was able to get Japanese mayonnaise at the supermarket I went to (I live in Shanghai), and it’s super-duper thick...  I also added some cinnamon and allspice because I love them in my banana muffins and bread.  I will make these again!

Really great! I followed the recipe exactly without chocolate chips (my son had eaten them all ) The mayonnaise was surprising but it made it so much easier to put together. I did mix the bananas and mayo together and added to the dry ingredients. Super moist.

This was a major hit for family and friends! I did add an extra banana, and they were really ripe for more flavour, as well as added a bit more mayo than called for. I keep getting asked to make these again all the time.

This is tasty muffin recipe easy to change up. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour 1 cup white flour, used blueberries in place of chocolate chips and added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. Also stirred in 3/4cup buttermilk  since the batter seemed too stiff. Next time I will reduce the sugar by half.

Perfect recipe! My husband loves it and proposed all over again after he took a bite. Lol! I didn’t have muffin pans, so I halved the recipe & placed it in a mini loaf pan (about 8x3in). Baking time was about 20-25 minutes, but it still came out great! Also opted to skip the choco chips & sprinkle a streusel mix on top (1tbsp flour, 1tbsp brown sugar, about a tbsp butter, and 1/8-1/4 tsp cinnamon)

Yum!!! The only thing I did differently is I did not have chocolate chips I had salted caramel chips so I used those instead. These are absolutely delicious. Moist is an understatement.

These are by far the best banana muffins I ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly and also added toasted pecans.  Moist, flavorful and so delicious, they came out perfect.  I now know what I will be doing with all my over ripe bananas..  You can't just eat one!

will make this again for sure , they were light as air , although I did add about a half of cup of frozen strawberries to the mayo banana mixture just because I love the combination . I also thought the batter looked a little dry so added about 2 TBLS of buttermilk , a keeper for sure

New favorite banana muffin recipe! We love eating them for breakfast. I added a small bit of brown sugar and vanilla to the wet mixture, as well as some salt to the dry ingredients. When the batter seemed too thick I added a small bit of milk to loosen it up and they came out PERFECT. (I also added chocolate chips and walnuts) This made 24 regular size muffins.

Oh my goodness...just finished making and eating these! They were SO yummy and super moist!  Combined the mayo and bananas together before adding them to the dry ingredients.  Topped them with a few pecan halves.  Getting rid of my usual go to  banana muffin recipe.  This is a keeper!  Now to hide them from my husband...

We used 3/4 cups of sugar, whole wheat flour and  extra dark chocolate chips. The muffins were awesome ??.I might try 1/2 cup of sugar next time. I think they will still be awesome.

My sister said she normally doesn't care for banana muffins but she thought these muffins were great! I replaced the chocolate chips with chopped walnuts.  Definitely going to be my go to recipe for banana nut muffins.

I’ve made this recipe many times by following the actual recipe and making changes.  Either way the muffins come out great. My batter is usually thicker but I’ve always mixed the dry ingredients and then added the “wet”. My muffins have always come out perfect but I’m going to try mixing the “wet” and then add the dry ingredients. I also bake them until a toothpick comes out clean from a center muffin so my baking time varies. The last time I made these I substituted a 1/4c of the flower with 1/4c protein powder and I couldn’t taste it at all. I’ve also used miracle whip because I didn’t have plain mayonnaise, still good. I just love this recipe and I always get more than 12 muffins. I do recommend adding vanilla, and chocolate chips or chopped walnuts!

I made these muffins twice and everyone in my house just loves them.  This recipe will be the one I use whenever I want to make banana muffins as they are so moist and delish.

Thanks so much for sharing.

we have a large family so I had to double the recipe. Well what do u know, not enuf mayo. So I used 1 c mayo, and 1 stick butter melted and cooled. I also added 1/2 c milk. I used frozen bananas, so that lent some moisture as well. Reduced the sugar by 1/2 c, and added 1/2 t salt.  Used pecans instead of choc chips, cuz with  5 kids, who has choc chips lying around? LOL.  Batter was thick, but the finished muffins were light and moist. Hit with the kids. Definitely saving.

just made these on a whim because my bananas we're almost over ripe. I only had  1/2 cup of mayo so I made up the difference with applesauce and added a couple shakes of cinnamon. So good!!!!!!!

I used less sugar and less chocolate chips as my kids found original recipe too sweet. Little tweak and they were fantastic.  Made three batches and they ate the lot! Very moist!

These were easy and fabulous. My 3and 5 year old grandsons helped and then gobbled them all up. Used super ripe bananas, mixed with mayo and added dry ingredients. Added mini chocolate chips. 100% success

i loved them, they were dense and moist. reminded me of the chocolate mayonnaise cake my mother made when i was a kid. these tasted just like banana bread, but in a single serving. i'm trying the recipe with frozen raspberries in place of the bananas. i'll post another review after i taste them.

It was definitely moist and I added a splash of vanilla and walnuts instead of the chocolate chips. Maybe I’ll try almond extract next time. Great base recipe to add variations. Thank you for the recipe!

These definitely are moist and stay that way for days. I used only half that amount of mayo and substituted the other half with apple sauce. I didn’t add the choc chips but think that next time I will and they will be over the top!

These were extra yummy. I chopped up a 70% cocoa bar, to make it healthy. My husband who just got out of icu with some heart issues, is really enjoying them. Ty

Best when eaten the day after baking. The mayo makes a great alternative to eggs and oil. Easy and tasty!

Very easy recipe. I mixed the bananas and mayonnaise together before adding to the flour mixture as suggested in other reviews. I added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla to mixture and a streusel topping before baking for a crunch. Loved them and will bake them again!

I made 2 trays, one with the chocolate chips and the other one, I tried out mixed nuts and raisins as a substitute for the choc chips. I first soaked the raisins in brandy overnight then added an extra 5 minutes on the cooking time. It was awesome and I loved it.

I had to try this recipe when I saw one of the ingredients was mayonnaise. They turned out great and my family loved them. I will be using this simple recipe for now on for banana muffins.  So quick and easy to make.  I added a little vanilla extract and a little more chocolate chips. One tip, it does seem like the recipes will be too dry, but keep mixing.  Turns out perfect.

While the banana flavor was definitely there, and they were moist, I thought they were way too oily. Maybe the mayonnaise was at fault since that ingredient is made with oil. I don’t think I will be making this again. The aftertaste was not very pleasant.

Super yummy, yes, delicious just like all the prior positive reviews have stated.   Mayonnaise?  Who knew?   Nice option to keep in mind in general when you're out of oil and/or eggs!     This is a keeper.  I can't even imagine how that top critical review found this recipe DRY.   Seems impossible to screw this one up.

I made these banana muffins yesterday and they truly are delicious.  I had one for breakfast this morning and heated it with some butter on it.  So good.  I made the recipe exactly as it is set out and used really old bananas thawed from freezer.  Definitely take them out at the 20 minute mark.

Delicious! I did half whole wheat flour, and 1/4 almond flour and the rest was regular all purpose. Also i did 1/4 coconut sugar, and 1/4 stevia and the rest regular sugar. a touch of cinnamon, and crushed pecans instead of chocolate chips.

HINT:  First of all, I haven't made yet BUT I am!  I make chocolate cake with mayo and it is amazing!  I did want to chime in on freezing overly ripe bananas!  Peel and put in storage bag or throw them in freezer in their peels.  Works great and when you want a ripe banana for your recipes, you already have them!  **When I do make this recipe, I am going to try and cut down the sugar, husband is a diabetic, or replace with part or all sugar free sweetener.  Will share the results!

I made these for brunch today—1 batch with mini chocolate chips and one without. They were a hit!
Some reviews say these are too dry—just keep stirring! I was worried about that, too, but just trusted the recipe and reviews.

Just baked these muffins. As others have said, I mixed the mashed bananas and mayo together first then added to dry ingredients. I also added a tsp of vanilla. I used 4 smaller ripe bananas. 
Mine amounted to 17 muffins which were filled 3/4 full in the pans. 
Twenty minutes was correct time.  Eating one now. YUM. Very moist and cakey.

Love this recipe! Easy as pie to make too. The muffins are moist. If you think you're going to taste mayo, it's not there. I added some vanilla but an addition of cinnamon/nutmeg would be a great addition.
I've put this in my weekly baking line-up.

I followed the recipe exactly and these muffins are very tasty and definitely very moist.  I think they could be enhanced with some walnuts or pecans, but otherwise this is a great recipe and a definite saver.

I was very skeptical of the mayonnaise but decided to let the reviews win over my scepticism   They are moist and yummy.  I changed nothing except that I did emulsify the bananas first before adding them to the dry mixture because I was concerned about the individual who said they were too dry.  There's nothing dry about these muffins.

Great recipe. I was worried about the mayonnaise addition.  They did not taste like mayo. They were very good and moist. Only change I made was I added walnuts and chocolate chips.

This is a very flexible recipe. I made exactly as written and they were delicious! I also varied many ways such as using different combinations of flours, sugars, and adding flax and chia seeds, nuts, etc. Always moist. Always amazing.

These are super easy to make. I only gave them four stars because they are really too moist in my opinion. They stick together when stored. I even tried leaving them on the cooling rack a long time before storing and that didn't help. Maybe next time I will cut back a little on the mayo and see if that helps.

Made this almost exactly as written, except I used 1/2 whole wheat flour 1/2 white and reduced sugar by 1/2.  Sweet enough, can't imagine adding a full cup with 3 bananas and choc. chips! Muffins have a nice rise and like other reviewers, I find them very moist and cake-like. A little too moist almost a  gummy texture for my  preference, but taste is good and would make again.

I was short about 2 T of mayo so we substituted 2 T of miracle whip. They still turned out great!

You can also substitute 1 cup of chunky apple sauce for the bananas and raisins for the choc chips for great apple muffins.

A very simple recipe to follow. I made 14 muffins and they came out  delicious. I made  half chocolate chip and the other half I added crushed walnuts. My family enjoyed them and I will save this recipe and make again.

Used coconut sugar, whole wheat flour, vegan 'just mayo', and mashed bananas and mayo together (per other reviews). Also added 1 tbsp chia seeds (for some crunch) and a dash of cinnamon. DELICIOUS! Definitely keeping this recipe for the future. These freeze SO well!

It   was a bit dry, and I didn't add ALL of the mayonnaise, cause' I hate mayonnaise. That might have caused the dryness, but they were delicious! Try adding white chocolate chips, like, NOW because the mix of chocolate is wonderful!

I had to use gluten-free flour due to my silly old Celiac so I didn’t have high hopes. HANDS DOWN the BEST muffins!!! My kids didn’t even notice the substitution (they usually complain right away). I added walnuts. So good for those crazy “ain’t-nobody-got-time-for-that” morning (if made the night before).

Don't be fooled like me - you can DEFINITELY taste hints of the mayonnaise. They are very moist and edible if you add lots of cinnamon and vanilla, but I'm opting for a recipe with eggs and butter next time instead of mayo.

This recipe is legit! Super moist banana muffins! My kids enjoyed baking them. We took everyone’s advice to mix the bananas & mayo first, followed by adding the dry ingredients. We added 1 tsp of vanilla extract for a little flavor. We were able to bake 18 muffins. Definitely we’ll bake these muffins again! So yummy!

Amazing! I added a punch of salt because I didn’t trust the amount of salt that would just be in the mayonnaise. Turned out perfect.

I followed the recipe as is, and was disappointed.  I could taste the mayonnaise in the final product, and they were not dense enough for my taste. Perhaps mayonnaise works better for chocolate cakes and things with lots of added, masking flavor.

Made these for breakfast today and they are exactly as described by other reviewers - super moist and delicious. Made them exactly as written except for adding in some vanilla. If you don't bake a lot it might seem weird to use mayo but it just replaces the eggs and oil and you can't taste it. I hate mayonnaise but when you cook with it you can't tell it's there. Really a great recipe!

These were good! I made 12 muffins and an 8x8 pan with this recipe. They were very moist and am thinking I could have baked them a bit longer. I mixed the banana, sugar and mayo in standup mixer first, then added dry ingredients. The addition of cinnamon and gingerbread seasoning worked well even with choc chips. My husband gave them a thumbs up!

I added some water and it helped it mix together a little bit more before I though the batter was very dry and was kind of like dough but overall I love the recipe and so does my family. And for those of you questioning the mayonnaise, don’t worry I was freaked too! But trust me I’m falling in love with these muffins and I don’t even like mayonnaise

Don't let the mayo put you off... you don't taste it and they are the BEST muffins that I have made and will continue to make. I didn't make any changes although I did add a few (1/4 c) Sunsweet dried Sweet and Tangy Blueberries because I had them. This recipe, as is, made me 8 extra large muffins. Baked @ 350 for 30 min in convection. Perfect!

I was nervous about the mayonaise, but pleasantly surprised at the end product. I only had 2 bananas, so I added some applesauce.  I also added a tsp of vanilla and a sprinkle of cinnamon. 
Delicious! I will make these again.

I really enjoyed these moist muffins that do not fall apart while you eat them.  I followed the original recipe and my only addition was a few tablespoons of water as the batter appeared to thick in my opinion.  Next time I may add some chopped pecans but these are so good as they are.

Wow this is amazing! I only had 2 ripe bananas so I scaled it down to 8 servings. I mashed the bananas, mixed with mayo and added 1/4 tsp vanilla. I also added 1/4 tsp of salt to the dry ingredients. This is a wonderful recipe and if you have run out of eggs and oil it is great to have this as an option. I am going to start staying stocked up on mayo now.

Used Hellmanns mayo and veggie oil, best muffins I’ve ever made! Semi sweet chocolate chips made it for me and gave a nice texture to a melt in your mouth muffin! Keeper!

I've made this recipe 3 times already. Absolutely delicious, as is:  the recipe is great. I did use mini-chocolate chips. I made a batch without the chips, and it was still good, but I made them again and added a teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla to the banana mixture. Definitely benefited the overall taste of the muffins. This is hands down, my favorite muffin recipe.

Good and I'll save it as an option for future use in case I have overripe bananas and no eggs. Very tasty. I made mine without chocolate chips since I didn't have any. I will do that in the future and I might try chopped walnuts, too. Thanks for a tasty treat!

I left out the chips and added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 Tbsp chia seeds & 2 Tbsp ground flax seed to make it a bit healthier.  Still turned out great! My convection oven left the edges a bit crisp, so maybe next time cut the time down or make 18 (smaller) muffins.

It is 11pm in Ottawa Ontario and I decided to make this recipe. I started putting the ingredients in my bowl and decided to read the ratings. One person said it was too much flour and had to add a cup of milk. I decided to keep going with the recipe exactly as written.....WOW!! I'm glad I did. It was in fact a lot of flour but when you keep mixing for a few minutes, the result is a nice batter that is easy to handle. I just tried a bite (cause it is past my bed time) and it was delish.  Thanks for the great recipe. The name says it all. The only change I made was 1 1/2 cup of flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. I also added 1/2 cup extra chocolate chips. This is a keeper and pass down to your kids recipe. So easy and only one bowl gets dirty.

Really yummy! I made a double batch and added 3/4 cup of shredded unsweetened coconut. Prob could have added a little more honestly, as you can barely taste it. Super moist and delicious muffins though!

I made these into mini muffins and they took about 10 min to cook. The recipe made 56. I noticed a lot of extra oil had seeped through the bottoms of the paper muffin cups. Flavor was good but I noticed just the slightest mayo flavor (I used Hellmann's full fat). Maybe someone not knowing that the recipe included mayo wouldn't have noticed, but I did. I also included 1/2 cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. This recipe is super fast and easy so I would make again.

I didn't like this recipe.  I bake banana muffins and today  I opted for trying this recipe. I followed it as stated and when I took out the muffins they stuck to the sides of the reusable muffin baking cups. There were a little too moist to the point where they weren't sticking together.

Surprised how good these were!!  I was concerned about the no egg, etc that I usually would put in.   I had 12 full muffin cups so I had to cook another 5 mins or so to get them a little brown.  Very moist and super easy!!  The only change I made was brown sugar instead of white.    I don't usually put chocolate chips in a banana muffin but so glad I did!!!  Yummmmm
Thanks

Definitely a keeper!  I omitted the chocolate chips, and added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts; also added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp corn starch.  The  corn starch makes it a little fluffier.  Mash bananas in separate bowl and add the mayo, vanilla and nuts.   Then add banana mixture to the dry ingredients. The batter is thicker than other recipes, but don't worry, they are great.

My husband said this was a keeper.  No more making banana bread.  I added a 4th banana just because I had 4 and sprinkled brown sugar on top.  He said whatever I did do not change it for next time.

Very easy, very good. Made exactly as written, without the optional chocolate chips. NO "mayo" taste, even in the uncooked batter (which I can never resist sampling). A keeper! Might add walnuts next time. It's important to mash your bananas thoroughly - they get more and more liquid as you do.

This is a great recipe. The Mayo does the work of the butter, eggs, and salt in one step so I will evaluate making these again. I just had to leave the muffins in the oven for an extra 10 minutes but it her than that pretty dumb proof!

Very good muffins! I used a jumbo muffin pan (6) that I sprayed with cooking spray. They were done around 25 min. Instead of a full cup of mayo, I used half mayo and half applesauce. I did what others suggested and mashed the bananas with the mayo (and applesauce).  Will try all mayo another  time. I also did half brown sugar, half white sugar and added a tsp of vanilla. I did add the chocolate chips, and the amount is perfect. Just enough to give a small taste of chocolate and not overwhelming. I added about 1/3 cup chopped walnuts and topped muffins with them, as well.  This is a definite keeper recipe! Thanks!

I used this recipe for the first time about 2 weeks ago and have made it 4 more times since then!  I added 1 tsp vanilla extract simply because I love the flavour vanilla adds to sweet baking. My family gobbles them up and then asks me to do it again!  New staple in my house!

My kids say these are the best banana muffins they’ve ever had!  They love them with the chocolate, without, or with nuts!  So moist, and i find the recipe actually makes about 17-18 muffins, so they last for several days.

Muffin is very delicious.We first mix the flour and baking powder with sugar.Mix the butter and the eggs evenly.But we did the wrong thing.We finally put the mashed bananas into the dough.This caused our whole dough to be dry.In the end, the baking time is one long, resulting in the cake.But it still looks good.

the recipes is good, it helps a lot.
when we smashed the banana , it's a little gross. I think the white sugar can make the taste of banana sweeter.
when the muffins came out , the center of some big muffins are still liquid, and that tasted good.

These muffins are great! I've made them several times and they always turn out great. I've made them as is, I've made them substituting 1 cup sugar for 3/4c agave nectar, and I've also done it using 1/2c brown sugar and 1/2c white. All three ways have been great! I always put the chocolate chips in and I also add 1/2c chopped walnuts. For Halloween I substituted the 3 mashed bananas for 16oz pumpkin puree instead, and added 1.5tsp pumpkin pie spice mix and 1/4tsp salt. They are amazing!!!

Unbelievably moist and delicious! I used white chocolate chips. I'll try to remember this recipe next time I want muffins but don't have any eggs. I was skeptical about the flavor not because of the mayonnaise, but because of the store-bought mayonnaise (Kraft, I think, it's what I had on hand). I usually make my own mayo with canola and light olive oil because I can "taste" soybean oil and I don't like it. Rest assured there is NO mayo flavor in these muffins or I would have not liked them because, soybean oil from the store-bought mayo. Keep it a secret and nobody will ever know! Next time I'll try a batch of these with homemade mayonnaise. That should really take them over the top!

I used light Miracle Whip and substituted the white sugar for brown, and added chocolate chips. 
They came out  very moist and really good. I doubled the recipe and it gave me 24 muffins.

These muffins are the best! Definitely mix the bananas and mayo together first and they come out perfect every time.

These muffins are fantastic. I usually make them per the recipe but today I altered/doubled it and used 4 bananas , 1.5 c Mayo, 1.5 c sugar, 2 c flour and 2 tsp baking soda and baking powder. I was looking to make them bars. Poured it onto a cookie sheet, baked for 20 minutes and got awesome bars! All you need is a glass of milk

Best and easiest muffins ever. Make exactly 12. Don't be tempted to squeeze out a couple more. 12 makes beautiful muffins with wonderful tops. Thanks for this one bowl favorite. Easy to make and easier to clean up

These were very yummy! I had no eggs in the fridge, so I was looking for a muffin mix with no eggs.  I used half whole wheat flour and half regular. The batter is very thick, but they work out just fine.  I will definitely make these again!

Super easy recipe.  Made exactly  as directed.  This made 36 mini muffins and when I came home all 36 were gone.  I guess you can't get a better endorsement than that!

I made this exactly by the original recipe with overly ripe and brown bananas. I agree that is the key in making them so moist. While they were very good, after reading the other reviews, I will also try a bit of cinnamon and vanilla for added flavor. 
The batter was very goopy, so next time I may put it on ziplock and cut off the corner to add the batter to the paper muffin cups. That would have been much faster! Enjoy!

I made this exactly as the recipe called for. It is more cake like then I thought it would be - it was good but I make a banana bread muffin recipe I have been making for years and didn't have any butter in the house so I looked up this one and decided to try it. Like I said it was good but not like my original one.

This was an interesting recipe as there were no eggs, milk or oil.  Although I liked the simplicity of using mayo instead, the texture of these muffins for me turned out too dense; the muffins all fell, and regardless of how long I cooked them, they had a kind of raw texture to them- were not cake-like.  I'm going to add more flour to the rest of the batter to see if that helps.

These are seriously divine. I made them for my mom whose celiac and she couldn't keep her paws off them!! That is saying something cause she's a foodie who is very particular about good, nutritious food that tastes really freaky good. This will become a baking staple in our home when they visit!

The recipe was so easy!!!!!  The muffins are incredible!!!! I love banana and chocolate! I needed a recipe for bananas. I read all the reviews.  The batter was like my blueberry muffin batter.  This recipe is a KEEPER!  1 suggestion I did was sprinkle sugar on top.  The rest I followed to the T. Soooooo AMAZINGLY YUMMY!

Very good! I only had 1/2 c of mayo, so I subbed plain Greek yogurt. It actually made 21 muffins which worked out great for me since I was feeding my kids and my niece and nephews! I'll admit I had too many!

I made it in a 6 large muffin tin instead of 12, used the original recipe minus the  chocolate chips. Spooned the dough evenly into the 6 muffin cups, and baked for 30 minutes. Fantastic recipe, they came out dense and moist!

These are delicious. I use about half the amount of mayo and soy milk to make up the other half of the mayo. Brown sugar instead of white. Blueberries  instead of chocolate chips.

These muffins were awesome!! I used 1/4 cup of pure raw honey instead of 1 cup of white sugar. And I used 1 cup of lite mayonnaise. I reduced the oven temp to 350 degrees since I used honey instead of sugar

Brought a 24 mini muffin tray so decided to try this recipe out, made the 24 mini's and 12 medium as well. Didn't have any mayo so made up some buttermilk, cut back on the sugar by a 1/4 of a cup still sweet and moist.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful. When I saw the recipe called for mayo I knew it was going to be super moist as I have made chocolate cakes before with mayo and they have been delish. I did however add just a couple things. I did not have any chocolate chips on had so I did omit them (which was a good thing because my husband informed me he hates chocolate chips in his banana bread, feeewww dodged that bullet, I would have had to eat them all by myself lol) instead I added chopped pecans. I also added 1/2 cup of sour cream and just about a half of cup of heavy cream. I also added 1/2 teaspoon each of cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. Just enough for taste but not enough for it to outshine the wonderful banana flavor. It turned out wonderful! So moist! I couldn't believe how moist! This will be one I put in my recipe book for sure. I can't wait for my husband to get home from work and have one to give me his honest opinion. This easily made 24 muffins so I am able to send a dozen to work for my husband and his co-workers. Again Yum so good!

I haven't yet tried the exact recipe. I made slight modifications the first time and loved them so much, I always make them this way. I was scared to use a full cup of mayo, so I used half a cup and added  half a cup of milk. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon because that's how I like my banana breads. I mixed the bananas with the milk and mayo first. I mixed the dry ingredients in a separate bowl and then added them slowly to the wet. They are amazing! Everyone always asks for this recipe.

It made such good bread/muffins.  Though these aren't healthy at all, so if you are trying to lose weight, don't make these! I used whole wheat flour, added nuts, didn't use chocolate chips and bake it in a 9 x 13 inch glass cake pan ( extra 10 mins).  It was so moist and good!  I loved it :)

Batter was easy to make and the flavors are good.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the recipe says it makes 12 muffins.  I filled the muffin cups as much as I dared and still had three more very full cups.  Because they were overfilled, the centers didn't bake although the crust was almost crunchy.  Next time I will make 18 muffins and they should bake through.  Lesson learned.

This is a FANTASTIC recipe!  Mine turned out light and very fluffy!  exactly how a muffin should be! I have searched for YEARS to find one like this!  Those that have said there wasn't enough liquid, clearly weren't using super ripe banana's - I also added 100g chopped walnuts and instead of regular choc chips I used the peanut butter filled ones by Nestle - ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  As a UK All recipes member it would be nice to see the weights in grams, as it's tricky to convert cups (Luckily I have cup measures though) I have printed it off and will make these regularly! :-)

I made these today, I used a jumbo muffin pan, so added an additional 10 minutes to the baking time and used Hershey mini kisses since I was out of chocolate chips. These are a wonderfully moist muffin and the kitchen smells Heavenly!

My daughter and I made this.  After starting this recipe we realized that we loaned out our muffin pans.  So we poured this into a 9x13 pan.  It was so delicious that my family devoured it.  The only other change I made was that we used Toll House chocolate/peanut butter chips.  I will definitely have to make this for the family again, however, I can not wait to take it to our next pot luck as well.

I just made these tonight since they sounded easy to make, and I had bananas to use up.  I added a shot of vanilla extract and a fourth banana, as well as half brown sugar and half white sugar.  I baked them for 23 minutes, and they still seemed almost too moist, but since the only eggs in there were in the mayonnaise, I decided to take them out of the oven since they were getting very brown.  They turned out great, and my kids and husband love them!  I will definitely make these again!

I followed the recipe as written. Because I'm at high altitude, I had to cook it a little longer than the directions said. But they turned out perfect! They were golden brown and just a little bit crispy on the outside, and soft, fluffy, and moist on the inside. Look at this delicious muffiny goodness!

I was VERY skeptical of this recipe, but it was DELICIOUS!! I wanted to make banana cupcakes but was out of eggs, and convinced I was out of luck. This recipe popped up and really saved the day. You don't taste ANY mayo, just perfect banana. MASH THE BANANAS AND MAYO TOGETHER BEFORE ADDING TO THE DRY INGREDIENTS. I didn't add any chocolate chips, but it did NOT need them.

My search for the "perfect " banana muffin ends here! My bananas were very ripe so I did cut back the sugar to 3/4 of a cup ,added 1 tsp. of vanilla , then keeping everything else the same. These muffins baked up beautifully ,were very moist and had great banana taste.

Our official banana bread recipe. Took awhile to find a good one. Our family said it was the best the ever tasted. I added a drop of vanilla and a dash cinnamon.

THE BEST muffins I've ever made! Honestly, any bad review would have to be because the recipe wasn't followed! I did add a little extra banana but that was it.

Deliciously, Moist Banana Muffins!  I really enjoyed the simplicity of this recipe.  I was glad I gave the recipe a try.  The only changes I made were to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1/3 cup of walnuts.  I achieved great results by mixing the mashed bananas and mayo first. This recipe yielded a dozen regular sized muffins AND a dozen mini muffins.  For those who had an after taste, I could be attributed to the type of mayo.  I would not use  olive oil mayo to make this due to its strong flavor.  Also, make sure to use really ripe bananas for the best banana flavor.  I will definitely make these again!

Sooo moist! I've never used mayonnaise in baked goods but WOW! I followed the recipe, and followed the advice of other reviewers and mixed the mayonnaise and bananas together before mixing it with the dry ingredients. I used chopped pecans and white chocolate chips instead of regular chocolate and boy was it delicious!! I made two batches. In the second batch I decided to add about a half of an individual container of banana flavored applesauce (the snack packs) and it made the muffins even better and even more moist. Next time I think I might try adding our mango flavored applesauce.

Fantastic! I have made these twice now. The mayonnaise, no liquid or eggs intrieged me. These are wonderful! The texture and moistness are spot on. This is a wonderful base to add whatever else you like; nuts, dried fruit, spices. And it is so simple! And this is just me but DONT substitute Miracle Whip for the mayonnaise. In my world, they are not the same thing. 

This second time I added dried blueberries, teaspoon of cinnamon, and 1/4 Tsp cloves. Simply yummy.

Makes the perfect loaf of banana bread- I used 1 1/2 c of white and 1/2 c of whole wheat flour, three bananas that were completely black on the outside and very mushy and brown on the inside. We threw in 1/2 c of quick cooking oats and 1/4 c unsweetened applesauce. Also used raw cane sugar instead of white. In the oven for 46 minutes at 350° and it was perfect!

I've made a lot of banana bread and this recipe is by far the moistest and easiest! I'm always hesitant to make cupcakes because they can be dry but this wasn't the case at all. There's no hint of mayonnaise and if you think about it, mayo is kind of like buttermilk and eggs right?

I made this exactly as recipe states. It is easy to make, no moisture needed. It is a thicker, sticky batter, but bakes perfectly.  
This is not banana nut bread flavor, so if that's what you are looking for, find another recipe. This is a very light flavored, thick textured, banana muffin, with chocolate chips.
My 2nd batch going into the oven, I added cinnamon and vanilla, which gave these muffins some "flavor". MUCH BETTER... in my opinion, for our taste. 
Gave 5 stars for the recipe as is, my tweaking I would give it a 7... and if I added nuts, it would be a 10 star recipe.  Easy, bakes perfectly, just a nice, laid back type muffin that would be great with tea. Adding extras makes this a coffee or milk muffin...yum~

The only thing I changed was not adding the chocolate chips, just don't like them in muffins. I gave this recipe five stars because this is the first banana muffin recipe that I've tried that is very moist. To me it tastes like banana bread & don't let the mayonnaise scare, you won't even know it's there. I've made these twice now & they are as moist as the first time.

Any idea why so of them don't cook through all the way. I baked them at 375 for 17 Mims and the tops looked very done. Yet when I take them out they fall in the middle.

This muffin was REALLY dense. Very moist, super easy to make, but it really was too dense. I would prefer if it was fluffier. Tastes good though and you can't taste the mayonnaise at all.

I must tell you, I was surprised that these turned  out so great, especially when I saw the mayo' but I read the reviews first and decided to try it.. The only change I made, was adding one egg and a little nutmeg  and a teaspoon of vanilla for additional flavor.. OMG tastes amazing!!! And so soft.. I baked for more than 20 mins .my boyfriend loves them!!

l made this recipe for the first time tonight and my family absolutely loved it. Instead of using a cup of white sugar, I did half cup each of white sugar and brown sugar and added a little vanilla extract, cinnamon and pumpkin spice. The bread was so moist and flavorful will definitely make this again.

OMG! I gotta admit I was a little sceptical about the Mayo, but HOLY COW, these are the best muffins I've ever tasted/made (and believe me, I've had my fair share haha). 
I mixed the bananas and mayo together first, and I also added a little bit of vanilla to the batter :) Delicious!

Fabulous! I abhor mayonnaise, so was therefore somewhat hesitant on using it. So glad I followed the recipe! I doubled it as I had the bananas to be used. I also want to add that I've never met a banana bread recipe that I couldn't mess up... Until now!

DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe exactly but I added 1 C. rolled oats instead of adding nuts or chocolate chips. I've made several different banana bread/cake/muffin recipes over the years and to date this is my favorite version of the muffin variety. I was a little scared at first seeing mayonnaise in the ingredients, but after reading other reviews I thought I'd give it a try. For those reviewers who said the batter did not mix well and had to add milk DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM! Yes, the batter is thicker than a normal muffin batter, but it does all combine with continued gentle mixing and was not floury. It was PERFECT.  My boyfriend was obsessed with these muffins as well!

I made these muffins according to the recipe.  Did not make any changes. They were moist and looked beautiful, but the crumb texture was off (too fine). Most importantly, they had off-putting aftertaste that you do not expect after dessert and it lasted for hours.  Will not make them again.

These were fantastic!  I was weary of the mayonaise, and it did look a little dry, but not too bad.  I added 1/2 tsp of vanillaand a sprinkly of cinnamon.  Super moist and great flavor.  This is a definite keeper.

Very good! My kids favorite banana muffins by far. I have used more than 3 bananas, if they are small, I use 6.

Best I've ever eaten. I substituted half the white flour for whole wheat and reduced the sugar by 1/4.

I was really unsure about Mayo in muffins, but these were excellent! So simple yet delicious! I added a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla extract. I will definitely make these again.

I strongly recommend preparing these a day before needed. I was disappointed when I first ate one fresh. But I left them in an airtight container over night and came back to find they have become even more moist and so so so much tastier. They are delicious.

I made an account just to review this recipe. These muffins are INCREDIBLE.  When I first read it, I was a little freaked out about the mayo idea. I thought the muffins would have a mayo taste. They don't taste like mayo at all! I did make a few changes to the recipe. I added about a tsp of salt, a tsp of vanilla, and a tsp of cinnamon. I also did 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. It also really helped to mix the bananas, vanilla, and mayo in a separate bowl first and then add half of the dry ingredients, mix, and then add the other half of the dry ingredients. It did end up a tiny bit dry, so I added a splash of milk. I baked them for 22 or 23 minutes and the recipe made 17 decent sized muffins. They have a nice crunch on the outside and they are moist on the inside. This is definitely going to be my go to recipe for banana muffins!

My Finnish husband rates these 4 of 5 stars, but says if he was Indian or Chinese he would rate it a 6.  The reason he says is because a Finn always give only 4 of 5 to something really good due to the 5th star being impossible to attain - "other worldy"

I put all dry ingredients in a bowl and mixed them around to blend. Then I added the mayo, banana and threw in some walnuts. My bananas weren't fully ripe.  It seemed dry at first, but thoroughly mixing with the spoon resulted in a batter I could dollop into the muffin cups.  Not an issue!

I baked as directed, but it took mine a little more than 20 minutes. Upon cooling, they were very moist and tasty.  I think it would be possible to add a tad more flour even without fear of ruining this recipe.

Anyone who added milk whimped out because they expected the batter to pour like a cake batter... if you'd only have kept stirring your mixture you would gotten it blended together and ended up with a decent muffin instead of what you got. 

I think this recipe is about as close to "fail-proof" as you could ever hope to find.

Unbelievably moist and decadent. When I saw I had to add mayo I was rather worried, but reluctantly made the recipe following the advice to mix the bananas and mayo 1st. This will now be our go to recipe!
A HUGE hit with all of our friends and family!

I followed this recipe to the T and it was amazingly moist and delicious. I did what the others recommended and mixed the bananas and Mayo first then added the dry ingredients,  stirring them in one by one. The whole family enjoyed it so this will definitely be my go to recipe!

I almost didn't make these because I thought, "Mayonnaise?? In muffins? Gross." But I'm so glad I gave it a chance. These muffins are AMAZING. Delicious and moist and perfect. My husband jokingly calls them "banannaise muffins." Try them! You won't regret it!

It's a keeper!   I noticed people saying it wasn't runny enough but what I do is I freeze my bananas when they are ripped and make a recipe with them when I have time.  It does create more water.  This recipe turned out awesome for me!  I will keep using frozen bananas ( thawed out) for this recipe. They were extremely moist!

Quite delicious! Husband liked them, then I told him that I put mayo in them and he didn't like them as much haha There is a slightly different flavor to them but they are quite good when you have no butter or eggs (which is what happened to me!).

I though this recipe was delicious! The kids loved it even though they are not normally a fan of mayonnaise (which we couldn't taste). I added some chocolate chips as suggested and actually baked them in mini muffin pans. Will definitely bake these again!

I made a few changes to this recipe...I added in a cup of rolled oats, a tsp of cinnamon, a tsp of vanilla and an additional 2 mashed ripe bananas (to counter the additional added dry ingredient of rolled oats).  

Instead of adding in chocolate chips, I cut solid chocolate easter eggs in half and pushed each piece into the middle of each muffin.  DELICIOUS!!!!

These are super easy to make and are delicious!  Like other reviewers said, mash the bananas and mix the mayo and chocolate chips together first.  You can't taste the mayo and these are super soft and moist.  I now want to add mayo in my other baked goods to make them soft and fluffy too!  I had to bake my muffins for 25 minutes and they came out perfect!

SUPER MOIST!!!  These were super easy to make and tasted great.  As others suggested, I blended the bananas and mayo first, then added the sugar, flour, baking soda and baking powder.   I also added a pinch or so of salt.  Would definitely recommend this recipe!

These were super moist and delicious. My children gobbled em up!

Side note: I followed the recipe to the T with the exception of adding 1tsp of vanilla. 
My recipe definitely baked up MUCH faster than the 20mins listed. I did a tray of mini muffins and they were done in about 8-9mins. I also did a tray of reg sized and they were done in 13-14mins.

A wonderful and easy recipe!!! They were perfectly cooked in twenty minutes and I made a batch of 18 instead of the 12 the recipe said it would. I used a quarter cup measure for each muffin cup and they were perfection.  I will most definitely make again.

This was so easy to make! I followed someone's suggestion and creamed the wet ingredients and sugar, mixed the dry in another bowl and then slowly mixed it into the wet (banana, mayo, sugar). I didn't have chips so I used a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar. I was also trying out spelt flour for the first time so I  used 1/2 cup spelt and the rest regular white flour. I don't think you can mess this recipe up. I want to try with coconut next time. They smelled great and tasted delicious!

I LOVE this recipe. I make these all the time and I can't keep them in the house. I've also substituted the mashed bananas with 1 1/2 cups of pumpkin & 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and everyone loves them. Also I've used plain applesauce with 2 tsp cinnamon with great success. I do have a question: Is there a way, without losing moisture, to make plain muffins with blueberries? I don't know what to substitute the banana moisture with to have the muffins be plain. Thank you!!

Outstanding! Really moist, tasty muffins. I was first taken aback by the mayonnaise in the recipe, but then trusted another reviewer's judgment and went ahead. Glad I did!  I find these to be a little lighter and fluffier than the often quite heavy and dense banana muffins and banana breads I have made in the past and thus much nicer as a breakfast food. I did not use chocolate chips, but roasted a little over half a cup chopped pecans and added those.

Since discovering this recipe awhile back, I have made it religiously every other month. Everyone LOVES this recipe and nobody ever believes they are made with mayo. I have made banana muffins and loaves--both turn out great! Wouldn't change a thing! Love this recipe!

I was a little hesitant because I can't stand mayo, but it was actually delicious! I went ahead and added the chocolate chips, and it made them great. It didn't even overpower the banana flavor, which I worried about.

For some reason, it seems like I *never* have enough fresh eggs when I need them.  This recipe is perfect!  Everyone loved them, and the compliment I got most was that they stayed nice and moist. Thanks for a great simple recipe!

I added a few things to make it great such as: some of my fav spices, cinnamon, nutmeg, and all spice.  Added 3/4 chocolate chips and use 4 bananas instead.  Also, I always add a bit less sugar than what the recipe says, especially when chocolate chips are involved, 3/4 cup of sugar is plenty enough.  My boyfriend told me they are even better the next day!

Making this recipe with bananas thawed from frozen is the key to enough moisture.  Thaw the frozen bananas in a bowl to catch drips, then just pinch off the end (the one without the stem) and squeeze the bananas out.  Use the liquid from the thawing process as well as the bananas and mash it all up, then mix in the mayo.  Mix dry ingredients separately, then combine.  The dough is thick, but the resulting muffins are delicious!!

Amazing! I was a little skeptical at first with the seemingly lack of liquid, so I bumped it up to 4 bananas (1 large, 3 small) - and taking the advice of mixing the mayo and bananas first, these turned out PERFECTLY. My toddler has already eaten three of them! I also left one out in the open, and 2 hours later it is still moist and spongy!

The name says it all. It is very fluffy and moist. This one is a keeper. I reduced the sugar by 20% and added the optional chocolate chips. It's not too sweet. Just perfect for me and the kids!

Very good!!! I made with 4 bananas cuz that's how many I had to use up. I also added a tsp of vanilla for extra flavour. I didn't have chocolate chips so I used peanut butter chips instead.  Great combination!! My family couldn't guess what the mystery ingredient was .... They couldn't believe it was mayonnaise

THIS IS IT!!!! I have always been looking for a good and easy banana muffin recipe. And again, THIS IS IT! I trusted Burgundy's review on this recipe and just followed it to a T. I am not sure what made this dry to other folks but ours is absolutely moist. I wish I can say more than what I already typed to convince everyone this is a really good one. Next time I make this I'm thinking of subbing mayo with yogurt. Just because we always have more yogurt in fridge than mayo.
9/8. I made this again today: changes I made, I used 1 1/3 c allpurpose floour + 2/3 c whole wheat flour. tapered down sugar to 2/3 C then used Vanilla yogurt instead of mayo. It is less moist but not dry, which is expected because of the wheat flour. It was of course less sweet but according to my kids they still love it. The next time I will make it, I will use  allpurpose flour all the way, less sugar, yogurt instead of mayo. Still a keeper. Now I can share it with a friend who has a kid who is allergic to eggs.

I mixed the mayo and bananas separately first as suggested by other viewers.
Wouldn't change a thing. Moist and delicious!

I read a lot of the comments before making it and decided to only add 3/4 cup of mayo, and add 1 egg, as well as 1 tsp vanilla and a 1/2 cup of milk. I stuck with 3 bananas but the additional liquid makes a little extra batter, so you might be able to knock that down to 2 bananas! They cook perfectly with these instructions! I chose to add walnuts instead of chocolate chips to reduce the sugar, but these are an A+ in my book!!

Awesome! I had 2 and 1/2 banana. I added chopped walnuts in addition to chocolate chips. My 15 month old twins and my 4 year old girls devoured it. Love this recipe. I shall make it again.

I've made this recipe several times (one of which was with my grade 2 class!) and it has always turned out perfect. Today, I went to make it and realized my mayo was expired so I used 3 eggs instead. Worked like a charm! Definitely not as moist as with the mayo but they were still quite moist and darn delicious. Only adjustment I made was after the 20 minutes, I covered them with tin foil and left them in for another 3 minutes.

Great recipe. Very moist. I used 4 very ripe bananas, switched out half white sugar with brown, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and salt and chocolate chips. My family loves them.

I love this recipe. It's quick simple and delicious. I use whole wheat flour and a couple of tablespoons of chocolate soy milk because the whole wheat flour can be a little dense. I also add chopped walnuts and cinnamon. The recipe doubles just beautifully.

This is my second recipe I tried for banana muffins. I really liked it. It was easy to make and they turned out tummy. The reviewer who said it was dry must of missed a step. You have to stir, stir to incorporate the bananas and mayo but it was plenty wet. I added walnuts. They were good and moist!

The absolute best recipe for banana muffins.  Mix the mayo and bananas first, then add the dry ingredients. I swapped  out the chocolate chips for a cup of chopped pecans and added a teaspoon of vanilla.  Moist on the inside, crisp on the outside. Delicious and so easy!

Just did this with Veganaise to make it a totally vegan recipe. Used Cinnamon chips instead of chocolate, unprocessed mexican sugar, and added vanilla extract. Kids licked the bowl clean and the house smells amazing. No issues with dryness.

I love this recipe. I had one much the same but lost it. My family never knew there was mayo in it. These muffins have the perfect ratio of bananas, unlike others which turn out rather dry. My family love these with a light cream cheese frosting; as I find the regular far too rich...it takes away from the muffin itself. I would recommend this recipe for anyone, including the first timer. If you're looking for a quick dessert and you're a beginner baker, this is a no fail treat your friends will praise. Although depending on your oven you may want to cook on 325 degrees F and check with a toothpick after 15  minutes.

These muffins are SO delicious and SO moist. Best recipe for banana muffins I have ever tried, and it is so simple. I personally left out the chocolate chips, put in a bit less sugar and mayo. I still found the muffins a bit oily so next time I will lower the mayo even more.

Easy and Tasty! I made this  a few times. 
I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of 1 cup of white sugar. 
I could taste the sweetness of riped bananas. 
Kids love this muffin. 
This has become my regular repartly now:)

Super easy and delicious! I added a little vanilla and cinnamon for flavor. Wow! These muffins are moist. There is no need to add any liquid, just mash the bananas until they produce liquid and add the mayo, then the sugar and then the rest. Definitely will make these again!

These are so moist and absolutely delicious.  I used very ripe bananas that had been frozen.  I just mashed the bananas and stirred in the sugar and mayo and added a generous teaspoon of vanilla.  Stir in the dry ingredients and you're done.  I did not even add the chocolate chips.  This is my new go to banana muffin recipe.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe scholzy.

I'm a single mom of 3 kids. Not only is this recipe delicious it is also very easy peasy! I throw everything into my mixer at once (including whole bananas). Takes less than 10 minutes to prepare. Cooks while we are getting ready for work/school.

I also mixed the bananas and mayo first then added the combined dry ingredients. I subbed brown sugar for white, and did have to add about 1/2 cup milk to get the batter to the correct consistency. This is the first time my daughter has liked banana muffins! Definitely a keeper!

These are to die for...seriously!  Do not be put off by the mayo in the recipe - the muffins come out very moist and you don't taste the mayo at all.  I used a light mayo with fewer calories and fat - turned out fabulous, and easy to prepare as well.  Highly recommend!

This is my new "go-to" recipe for over-ripened bananas! My kids and husband love it! All ingredients are always on hand, so there's no substituting and no running out to the store. I use sugar from the raw and will add a TBSP of brown sugar to counter the mayo taste that sometimes surfaces. Haven't made it with the chocolate chips, they are yummy enough on their own!

Like, like, like! I didn't add the chocolate chips. Instead I put some batter in the muffin cups, put a chocolate kiss in the middle, then put a little bit more batter on top. I also was able to make 18 muffins and baked the for 20 minutes.

I made these vegan by using 1/2 reduced fat Vegenaise (that stuff is too expensive to use a full cup!) in place of mayonnaise. It was a little dry when I mixed it, so I added just a cap full of peanut oil. Did the trick! very moist and not too dense. I'll probably try some kind of milk alternative next time instead of oil, but this first try was fantastic. Vegan baking is pretty easy, which I think is contrary to general opinion, but it's never this easy!

Melt in your mouth! They aren't the most banana-y muffins I've ever had, but I'm okay with that. I added a dash of vanilla, reduced the sugar just slightly (they're still plenty sweet...I could reduce a little more to make them a tad healthier), and used whole wheat pastry flour, and I mixed everything in the mixer. Definitely would make again.

Wow!  I was a mayo skeptic but glad I read the reviews and gave it a shot. Super delicious and moist. I added walnuts, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla.

My homeroom students LOVED this recipe! They report that the muffins are sweet and tasty. They were also soft, fluffy and moist. I doubled the batch and only had one cup of mayo in the house, so I substituted one cup of apple sauce in the recipe. They were pleased with them.

These were soooo good. My kids loved them! I mixed the banana with the mayo and then added everything else. The only changes I made were to add cinnamon, and I used half a cup of brown sugar, and half a cup of white. I made 11 big, yummy muffins. They came out kind of crunchy-in-a good way on top, and moist inside. I'll definitely make these again!

OMG!! These are so good!!! I had a couple bananas ready to go bad so thought I better make some muffins. Saw this recipe and was concerned by the mayo so read through the reviews. The reviews were so right!!! The mayo makes these so fluffy and creamy! My daughter walked in the kitchen while I was preparing the ingredients and said "Your putting mayo in those!!??" I told her I had read the reviews so lets give it a shot. She loved them! What a great muffin!! Thank you for the recipe. Will be my banana muffin recipe from now on! :)

Really nice rise, light crust on the top, nice crumb and as everyone is saying, super moist.  Added vanilla, and used a good quality canola mayonnaise (I was skeptical because it contains a little vinegar and mustard, but no problems).  Don't be dissuaded by some of the lackluster photos on here, these came out looking beautiful!

Mayonnaise? How could this be good in a muffin?  So I decided to try it anyway because I had all the ingredients at home and a few bananas that were ripe.  Now I have made these 6 times and the family begs for more.  They truly are moist and delicious.  The family grabs them as they go out the door in the morning and so far I haven't had any leftovers to freeze as they are gobbled up so fast.  I don't add the chocolate chips to lessen the calories and they still are fabulous.  I have also used low fat mayo because I ran out of regular mayo and no one has even noticed and they come out just as fluffy.  This is indeed a family favorite - easy to make and easy to please.  Thanks. (PS) Don't tell the kids they are made with mayo or they turn up their noses.

Great recipe! I was a little concerned about using 1 cup of mayonnaise, but these muffins were fabulous. I admit it...I ate 3 while they were still warm. The only thing I did differently was use 4 bananas instead of 3. My kids gobbled them up too.

Wonderfully moist! I made mini muffins, and they are perfect.  I also cut the recipe in half as I didn't have enough bananas.  This was an easy recipe...minimal ingredients which is what prompted me to try this recipe.

I'm not going to lie, I was very, very skeptical of using mayo.  But, I decided to try it since I had a huge tub of it lying around (as my boyfriend loves it) and a couple of bananas that were about to go bad.  I was pleasantly surprised.  These were delicious.  I imagine they probably would have been great as is with the recipe, but I wanted a little more flavor variety so I threw in 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of vanilla, which ended up tasting fantastic.  Highly recommend!

These were excellent - as good as any more complicated banana bread recipe I've made. I like that they use the muffin mixing method but come out as moist and fluffy as those made with a more involved creaming method. I had no problem at all with the consistency of the batter - it was thick but only as thick as any good muffin batter. If it's too thick for some, perhaps their bananas were small and/or not ripe enough so you didn't get enough or they didn't provide enough moisture. Tip: I use a ricer to get my bananas mashed up quickly to a smooth consistency.

This was the perfect base recipe for what I wanted: something sweet that could be served as either a somewhat healthy dessert or a special treat breakfast. With that goal in mind, I made a few tweaks. I took the suggestions of other comments here and subbed half of the white flour for whole wheat flour, and used a little less sugar than called for and made half of it brown sugar. 
I had no trouble with stickiness and wonder if maybe those that did under-baked their muffins a bit. My ingredients also mixed together perfectly, although I followed other's suggestion to mash the bananas and mayo first and then add the dry ingredients to the wet, instead of the opposite way suggested in the original recipe. 
This one is definitely a keeper!

Excellent!  VERY Moist and I added about a cup of chocolate chips instead of the 1/2 cup it called for plus I got 18 big muffins instead of 12!  SO YUMMY!

First time trying it but thinking, wow, wait a minute, no milk but mayo and banana? But while manually mixing it, it turns out all the flour blend in the mixture...Totally moist and tasted very good!!!

This recipe was so easy and wonderful to make. I followed a previous review's advice of mixing dry ingredients first and then adding the banana's and mayo. There's so many little things you could also add to this to make it just that much better, like nuts as well. I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and a few good shakes of cinnamon just to be daring and they are wonderful! Every review is right, you cannot taste the mayo at all.

Wow! Did this recipe as cookies instead of muffins, they were amazing!  So moist and soft.  I only had 2 bananas, and used 1c of write flour and 1c of whole wheat.  I baked for 8 min at 375, and they were perfect.  Can't tell you how well they store, because there were not any left!

Another reviewer mentioned having to add milk to for moisture. I did add 2 tbls milk. Added whole cup of chocolate chips and 1/2 cup chopped pecans. Mayonnaise added that special "ummmm" that makes everyone come back for another. Easy recipe with good results.

These were very good!  Easy to make, too.  I only had self-rising flour so I used that and left out the baking powder and soda and they still turned out well! I also used cinnamon chips instead of chocolate chips.  Yummy!

For the people saying the recipe needed liquid,not true!  If you mix for 30 seconds it all blends well.  Literally turn the spoon a few times and it's mixed. Not hard. I've made this recipe many times and they always turn out great!

LOVED this very easy recipe.  I followed others suggestions and put in a tiny bit of milk.  I also added a tiny bit of nutmeg and cinnamon.  That's my taste though, I love the way both mix with banana recipes.  My hubby and kids will devour these in no time at all!

Best banana muffin recipe I've ever tried. Moist, light and not too sweet. Used brown sugar instead of white, as per other recommendation. Will be using this from now on.

I LOVED this recipe. Easy, foolproof, delicious. I made mini muffins instead of bigger ones and added walnuts AND skor bits. Just came out of the oven, they are fantastic. SO moist and they rose pretty high. Great if you don't have eggs and butter at the moment.

Saw this recipe after searching for a better Banana Bread recipe then one I tried last week. This recipe is great, muffins were moist and light. I made half with chips and 1/2 doz without, I also doubled recipe and used half in a round bunt pan and cooked that an additional 20-30 minutes till knife inserted came out clean.  Great recipe, will definitely used again

Substituted a cup and a half of blueberries (whole, fresh, large) for the chocolate chips. Took another 8 minutes to bake and changed the recipe to a 14 muffin yield (instead of 12 muffin yield) but SERIOUSLY yum.

I was intrigued by the use of the mayo in the muffins so when I had a ripened banana decided to try the recipe.  I made the recipe as stated with the exception of half brown half white sugar. I just like using brown sugar in recipes - just my own preference I am sure they would have been great with the full cup of white.  I took the advice of other reviewers and mixed the banana and mayo together before adding to dry ingredients. Also, I used slightly over 1 cup of bananas.  Not sure why people are saying the mixture is dry? Perhaps you are using bananas that aren't that ripe? I know as another reviewer mentioned as you let them sit they create more "juice". Anyways Great recipe, definately a keeper for me.  I ended up with 15 muffins instead of the 12 muffins mentioned with the recipe.

Great! Wonderful! Terrific!
I made some changes:
I did some mayo, some olive oil, an egg, and I used only two bananas.
Fabulous! It would probably be good without my changes, though. My mom said they were the best muffins she ever had.  If you think they are too dry, add an egg, they are great!

Thank You So Much, scholzy!!!!!!!

Love the recipe! Had a couple of bananas I needed to use fast, and this was perfect.  I did everything exactly as suggested, expect mine were done sooner - more like 15 minutes.  My oven runs hot I think, though.  Really sweet and moist, and can't taste the mayo at all.  :)

These muffins are absolutely perfect!  They are so tender, moist and delicious!  I know it seems odd ~ but you can't taste the mayo and you'd NEVER know it was even in there!  They are the best muffins we've ever had :)

The only change I'll make next time (and there will be a next time!) is to use less sugar.  3/4c instead of 1c.  as they were VERY sweet.

I also mixed the mashed bananas and mayo together in a separate bowl from the dry ingredients, then poured the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and used a Wisk JUST to wet and mix the wet and dry together.  Do not over mix ~ it get's gummy if you do.

I love this recipe and make it every time I come home from college for my parents and others who come to visit. I use a half cup of brown sugar and half of white instead of just 1 of white. It makes them really really moist! Great recipe.

I found this recipe really easy, and they taste wonderful!! I did add an extra banana cause I didn't want to waste it, I also added a hint of vanilla and cinnamon! They turned out great though! I thought they would be dry, but the banana/mayo that I mixed together first, then added to the flour worked well! I mixed it with a spatula and put it in cups!! I am really impressed and will share this recipe!! Thanks a lot!
Edit! 
Everyone who tasted these muffins loved them!! It is now something I will always make!!!

Good flavor.  Nice crumb & texture.  I will keep this recipe for future reference.  I substituted half the sugar for light brown sugar & used butterscotch chips.  They'll be a big hit with the neighbors & my office buddies.

Delicious! I only had 2 bananas to use but they still turned out fantastic! Followed the other reviewers suggestions and mixed the banana and mayo together first and then added to it. It was plenty liquid. The mixture was pretty sticky though andtook some time to get it into the liners. Well worth it though.

these turned out nearly perfect - I left them in the oven for a few minutes too long. Next time I'll try adding some cinnamon & nutmeg. Great consistency, nice and moist, super quick and easy to make!

To make this easier and even faster, I used 2C of baking mix.  It was a hit with all the kids.  And they can lick the spoons safely because it's made with mayo.

Soooo good! Fluffy, moist and easy! I was a little skeptical about using mayonnaise, but they turned out deliciously.  I added a little vanilla as well for flavour. Next time I will add chocolate chips! :) mmmm.

I thought the recipe was amazing.  When I first looked at it, I was like mayonaise, what?  Then I started to make them at eleven oclock at night.  I was done by twelve oclock.  They turned out better then I would have ever expected especially by me.  They were very moist and I would Highly recommend them.  To those who think that there is no liquid, they are most likely not using an electric mixer.  I started out thinking that I could do it by hand but then I got out the mixer and within seconds the mixture turned liquidy enough to be a muffin batter.  Thank you for the recipe.

Oh my goodness!!! These muffins are soooo good! They are the most moist muffins that I've ever made. I only had 2 bananas so I cut the recipe to 8 servings. I made half with chocolate chips and half without. They are awesome both ways! They are pretty sweet so I may cut back on the sugar just a bit next time (just so I don't feel as guilty eating them...lol). But I will definitely be making these again. Thank you!!!

I added 1/2 c of llight sour cream to this because the batter was a bit dry for me. I made this 2 ways: mixed by hand and mixed by a mixer. When I mixed it by hand & baked it in a loaf pan, the top did not rise. When I mixed it by mixer and baked it in an angel food cake pan, the top rose. I guess the volume I beat into the batter helped. Anyway, the banana bread came out DELICIOUS, especially the next day. Moist, sweet, and soft. This is my new favorite banana bread recipe!!

This recipe is easy to make and tastes delicious.  I did, however, substitute the chocolate chips for butterscotch chips.  I feel they are better match.  Also, I would place more batter in the holders prior to baking.  These muffins do not rise that much and I prefer a larger muffin.

I was looking for a moist muffin recipe and this one is it!  I used 5 bananas.  The mayonnaise is definitely the secret key, you can't taste it at all, it just gives them an almost sticky texture.  I took them to the office and all 12 were gone in an hour!  Highly recommend these and they're very quick to make.  Mine took 18 minutes in the oven.

These are AMAZING!!! I have made them twice, once subsituting sour cream for the mayo since I didn't have any, and the second time I substituted the chocolate chips for walnuts at my husbands request. Both times were an absolute hit, and the muffins disappeared quickly by adults and children alike. We all love them and this will be our new family recipe. Thank you!!!

Unbelievably delicious! Cannot say enough good things about this recipe! I had no eggs on hand, but plenty of mayo, and this recipe came to the rescue. I will make this my STANDARD banana muffin recipe -- and can't wait to try it swapping the banana for pumpkin.

Great recipe. Using other reviews, I made it with 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of white flour, and it turned out great! Not too sweet and very moist.

Extremely moist.  Made as a loaf instead of muffins, just increased the baking time.  Husband enjoyed this recipe.

Very tasty! I had three very ripe bananas, but no loaf pan to make banana bread in. Instead I found this recipe. I didn't quite have enough sugar, so I substituted a little Splenda. I added Hershey's dry cocoa to it b/c I didn't have any chocolate chips. Once I got them poured into the pan/cups, I placed a dark chocolate Hershey's "egg" left over from Yule. The dark chocolate countered the banana's sweetness beautifully. Next time, I'll try it with semi-sweet chocolate chips Great recipe!

Very good.  I was in the mood for something coconut also, so I added some flaked coconut and left out the mayo and added about 1/2 can coconut milk.  Yummy! Turned out very moist and very tasty.

Very nice moist muffins as described. I did not have quite enough mayonnaise so added some milk to the mixture and they tasted good. Will use this recipe again.

These were really good. I mixed the mayo and bananas first as others adviced and they turned really good ... I added some pecans on top and made in a loaf shape rather than muffins. They were terrific.
