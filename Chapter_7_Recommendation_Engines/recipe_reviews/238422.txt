Had to try this one recipe because it was easy and had all the ingredients, however we Found out we are not a fan of kale.  
I’m sure if you like kale this is a great recipe but can’t give it but 3 stars because of my tastes not that it’s a bad recipe.

I'm just not sure that the peanut sauce works on this salad.  It's ok, but I don't love it.  Will keep looking for the ultimate kale salad.
