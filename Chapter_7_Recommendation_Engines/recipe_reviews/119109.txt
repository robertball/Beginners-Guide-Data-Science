I only made the sauce for the Lamb but it was really AMAZING!! I grilled it on my George Forman grill which worked out great.

Added an extra tablespoon of dijon to the sauce and only salt and peppered to taste. I love the sauce with this dish! I am going to make the veggies more often even without the lamb!

This was a lovely light meal. I served this with the Onion Roasted Potatoes from this site. The only suggestion would be to add a bit more mustard than the recipe calls for if you do like mustard, as I could hardly taste it in the sauce. Thank you for a great recipe.

The sauce was simple and easy to make with ingredients at home AND it was delicious! I was worried it wouldn't stick to both sides of the pork chops, but it did. My first time making lamb was a success d/t to this recipe. Broiling also made this recipe super fast. I will try the sauce on pork chops next time.

This was really nice. First time I cooked lamb, and it was awesome.

The sauce flavor is so nice and the saut√©ed veggies went so well with it.

My only problem was that I could't broil them, so i just baked them so the timing was different. I think I slightly overcooked the meat, so it came out a bit rough :-( but the sauce was so great! yum!
