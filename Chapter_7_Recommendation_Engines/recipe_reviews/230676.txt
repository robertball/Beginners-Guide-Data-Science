Definite hit with family. Strong garlic is just right for our family. Spinach flavor is good, maybe add more mushrooms next time. Love texture, taste.

This was really good.  I shorted the garlic a bit, was afraid it might be too overpowering.  Will add extra next time.  I think this would be great with hollandaise sauce instead of the cheese as an alternative.

Perfect the way it is.  I also tried it with Jimmy Dean sausage (4oz cooked)  and 5 eggs and used a meatloaf pan and it was really good.

Yummy and easy! I added halved cherry tomatoes on top for color and extra flavor. I will make this again.

Absolutely amazing!!! I made a few subs, added a bit of extra cheese and used some worsctershire sauce to the mushrooms. I also added a few chives to garnish, but this is so meaty it works for dinner too! But I will DEFINITELY be re-making this.
