Outstanding! And if you want to "kick it up a notch" use hot banana pepper rings and a 1/2 tsp. Cayenne pepper.

To minimize the sodium content from the original recipe, I use sodium free soup mix. Also, try to find salt reduced or salt free pepper rings. AND used baked tortilla chips, not fried for an extra bonus.

If the Ground Beef Appears Dry, due to all the Dry Ingredience.
Just add a little water to it..It should appear wet when ready to Grill!

These were  not as good as I anticipated they would be. I love spicy foods, but these were over-spiced!  They were a bit dry, and somewhat crunchy!   Not bad, but I probably would not make them again.  My husband would have probably rated them a four, and will ask for them again!

Mine were a little dry, I assume that was either because of the chips or because I used extra lean beef.  Maybe that made a difference.  Thanks!

I liked these. Yes they were a bit crumbly. I would suggest fewer chips. I was unable to get Cool Ranch chips so I got regular and added in some powdered ranch dressing. The chili chips I found were inferno hot so I left out any extra spices..also used half the onion soup mix called for. It was plenty

Definitely tasty, nice kick, but needs adjustment. Like my dad said, it's a great (inexpensive) way to feed a crowd by stretching your meat as far as you can! Will probably half the chips next time.

I should have saved the meat. I realized this was a mistake when I looked at 8 cups of crushed chips and 3 pounds of hamburger meat...but I went ahead.
We had chicken that night.

Product was too crumbly.  Perhaps it would have been better with less corn chips and toco chips or if an egg were added.
