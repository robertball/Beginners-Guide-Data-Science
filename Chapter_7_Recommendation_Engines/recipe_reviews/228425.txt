This recipe worked well for me. I was looking for a quick and easy recipe to use up some ground chicken and found this one. It is similar to one I used from the site for ground turkey. I don't have a handy grill in the winter, so I just broiled them indoors on a foil lined baking sheet. Meat comes in 1 lb packs, so I used that but kept the rest of the ingredient amounts basically the same. I actually weighed out the 2 oz of feta and it came to 1/3 of a cup. I didn't have kalamata olive tapenade. So, I finely chopped 1 tablespoon and mixed with a tsp of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt. For the 1 tablespoon of fresh oregano I used 1 tsp of dried. The garlic took an amount about 5 ex large cloves. Mincing the garlic was the most time consuming part of the recipe. I got 7 chicken burgers using 1/4 cup scoop at 130 calories made as written. ty

What a winner! Really yum. I used 1 lb ea of ground chicken & turkey because that's what I had on hand when I found the recipe online today. I also used 2 Tbsp of chopped black olives instead of the tepenade as someone suggested, thanks! 2 Tbsp dry instead of fresh oregano, also because that's what I had on hand. I made 8 smaller patties. Used grill on stove-top instead of BBQ. I might put in 50% more feta next time. This recipe would also make awesome meatballs. Thank you!

This was VERY good!  Flavorful, moist, and ready in a snap!  I don't do bread (gotta watch my girl-ish figure) so I put it on a salad instead.  Thank you!

This recipe is excellent and those little burgers go straight to your heart!  Could only buy what seemed like a pretty big (jam size) jar of kalamata tapenade....but wouldn't you know, we used that whole jar up in about 6 months making this recipe over and over and over.  It even turned a hard-core red meat man into a chicken burger guy.

Made according to directions. Grilled on the bbq and put with melted provolone on ciabatta rolls. I added shredded lettuce & hubby added coleslaw. The patties were awesome! Family thought I bought them prepared from grocery deli. Made extra for lunches & salad toppers. Recommend!!

This was sooo good! I did use ground turkey though and extra feta because I am a cheese freak. Did not a get chance to take any pictures because my family basically inhaled them.

Fixed these using a green olive and orange tapenade. I think you could use whatever kind you have in hand. The flavor and moistness is outstanding. I pan fried them and they did not need oil in the pan. We don't eat our burgers on buns and these were wonderful on their own...no sauce needed, but would benefit from sauce if you wanted to add it. Will go into my favorites file

I love this recipe. I cook them in the oven at 400 for about 15-20 minutes. Rather than eating these with hamburger buns I would suggest either plain or on pita bread with hummus.

We enjoyed these burgers, used goat cheese not feta, i find feta to salty.I left the Kalamata-olive tapenade out because i had none.I baked them and they turned out very good, and the goat cheese melted nicely inside. I had roasted mixed veggies. and garlic mayo as a dip for the burgers, thank you Jeanette  for the recipe. Will be making these again..

This recipe came out AMAZING! I did not use the tapenade because I'm not a fan of Olives. I made the chicken burgers patties with ground chicken, salt, pepper, minced garlic, feta cheese as the recipe says, but I added an egg and quarter cup of bread crumbs. I used a whole egg and only 1lb of meat so the patty was a bit sticky. If you use the full 1.5lbs or should be good. 
I put all of the ingredients in a bowl, mixed them, made the patties and set them in the freezer for about 20 minutes. I grilled them about 6.5 minutes each side since they were a bit thicker. 
I also added some grilled onions. I took a white onion and sliced into rings. Put some canola oil, Sally and pepper. Grilled them directly on the grate for a bit little less than the burgers.
Set the burgers on a bowl of 50/50 blend salad with halved grape tomatoes. Set the onions on top and drizzle with tzatziki sauce.

This was a nice change from the regular burgers. I didn't have any tapenade or fresh oregano, so I just chopped some black olives and added them with a teaspoon of olive oil instead and used dried oregano for fresh, about 2 teaspoons. Also pan fried these on the stove for about 4 minutes on each side.
I served with a side of orzo pasta and some saut√©ed vegetables.

This was a very good recipe. Used fresh oregano from the garden. Did not use the tapenade, And they were still fantastic. Ate on top of a salad. Thumbs up from husband as well!

I put 5 stars but it's probably more like a 4.5 for us.  I used ground turkey instead of chicken and since it was only 1lb, I did the appropriate conversion for the ingredients.  I used dry oregano instead of fresh (again, doing the proper conversion).  I only had minced garlic so used about 1/2 tbsp of that, but probably could have used the full tbsp.  I put the burgers over beds of lettuce, topped with a slice of fresh tomato, tzatziki sauce, and a bit more feta.  Very yummy!  I didn't get much of the tapenade or feta flavor from the burgers themselves, so next time I'll be increasing those (hence the 4.5).  The meal actually tasted quite light, and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  I will definitely be making this again with some tweaks.  Thanks!

Liked the taste but the cooler was weird being so grey, I also ate it without a bun so with a bun color would have been hidden. Taste was a 5 star but color just knocked it down.

I love Greek food so thought I would try making these. They were good, but I felt the feta and olive taste overpowered the chicken somewhat.

I found myself searching for low fat options when my gall bladder started to act up.  This was wonderful.  I used turkey instead of ground chicken as ground chicken has never appealed to me.  My husband over grilled a wee bit, but it was still wonderful.  It will be made again.

It was a very blustery day here, so I made this inside on a cast iron skillet. I also only had one pound of ground chicken. It was very dry, but I will certainly try again with the correct ratio of chicken. The other ingredients are things I always have on hand.

This was so easy and I happened to have olive tapenade in the cabinet from a recent trip, so it worked out. I didn't use bread, instead I put on top of a spinach, olive, cucumber, red onion and cherry tomato salad with a little balsamic vinegar. Very tasty, extrememly moist and a needed healthy change from the typical beef burger.
