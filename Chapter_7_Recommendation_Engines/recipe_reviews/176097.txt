I make this for almot every party I go to.  I use Ranch dressing instead of blue cheese.  Also it can be made ahead of time, w/o the cheddar.  When you heat it up add the cheddar.  Perfect on crackers.  We even make it for a snack at our houseand heat as needed.

I made this recipe for this past superbowl and it was a total hit! You may want to add less hot sauce if your company is not into spicy, but i love spice and thought it was perfect. I was a bit unsure about the added cheddar cheese on top, but it went very well with the recipe.  Easy to make. . big hit!

Excellent for parties. I added garlic, garlic powder, and some black pepper. DO NOT use canned chicken. Some will say its ok- its not!

I used a can of Swanson canned chunk chicken that was in the WAY back of my pantry, reduced fat cream cheese, I used Frank's Hot Sauce and homemade ranch dressing instead of bleu cheese (that's what I had on hand--my boys don't care for the flavor of bleu cheese anyway). I threw everything in my small crockpot after breakfast and just let it go until our lunch/snack time (we snack on the weekends). After trying it, I did add one more cup of shredded cheese and let it go for another half hour or so. Next time, I'd cut back on the hot sauce just a bit and I'd use half chopped celery/half chopped carrots and maybe add a little garlic/onion powder. GREAT way to make a weekend dip for my boys that's quick AND it used a can of chicken I'd had in my pantry for a while. Using canned chicken really wasn't an issue for me.

I use Jack cheese, and crumbly blue.  Use Fritos to dip and you will not be able to get people away from this!!!

I got a version of this recipe from a friend of mine.  Boiled chicken mixed with the hot sauce in bottom of greased lasagna dish, topped with mixture of slightly melted cream cheese mixed with blue creese dressing.  Put in oven at 350 for 20 minutes.  Top with cheese and bake another 10.  This is heavenly if you like buffalo wings!

I really enjoyed this, but my boyfriend thought it was only so-so.  So I am compromising on the rating with a four star.  The only thing I didn't entirely care for was the texture, which never seemed to completely mix together properly?  However, that could have been my fault, since I just mixed everything together and threw it in a slow cooker.  At any rate, the taste was very good.  Next time I think I will make sure I cut everything into pretty small pieces, to making scooping a little less awkward.

I like some heat and we go through a lot of hot sauce around here, but this was definitely more spicy than I would have preferred.  I ended up adding more (nearly double) the blue cheese dressing.  Good texture and taste though, next time I will start with half the hot sauce and go from there.

The man was so excited when I made this! I used some leftover grilled chicken, so that added a wonderful flavor. I did add some extra hot wing sauce because we like it spicy and then topped with blue cheese crumbles. I served it with tortilla chips and celery sticks. Thanks!

I loved this and it was so easy to put together with cut up routissere chicken. I made my own blue cheese dressing and used 1/3 cup of Buffalo wing sauce because I don't like my dips to hot. There were leftovers due to many choices on game day,so this made a nice casserole with the addition of chopped broccoli and more chedder cheese baked in for a  Monday night week dinner.

I substituted canned shredded chicken for fresh and put cheddar cheese on top for last ten minutes of baking instead of stirring in. Brought it to family game night and everyone enjoyed. Will make again.

This is delicious.  If your family or company doesn't like Blue Cheese dressing, use ranch instead.  Everyone loved this at our Super Bowl party.  I served it with scoop type corn chips but you could serve it with crackers or celery sticks.
