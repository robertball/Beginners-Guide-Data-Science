This was the PERFECT lunch for a Saturday during the current heatwave here in NJ! I saw your article in the recent AR magazine and I've been positively *itching* to make this ever since. 
I added a pinch of cardamom just for extra depth since I didn't have the rose petals this time. I made a quick flatbread dough of greek yogurt, flour, and rosemary that i cooked in a cast iron skillet while the soup was chilling.
The recipe was more than enough for my husband and I to have generous portions for lunch, and I packed the leftovers for my lunch at work. 
It's simply delicious and satisfying - thank you for sharing!
