This is more dense than a traditional banana bread but it has a nice flavour and it's also moist. I don't own a bread machine so I mixed everything in a bowl and baked it for 55 minutes @350. Since organic bananas tend to be smaller I used 1 cup of mashed bananas along with organic flour, eggs and cinnamon. I didn't include the walnuts because of a nut allergy in the family and used chips instead of chunks. Thanks for the recipe.
