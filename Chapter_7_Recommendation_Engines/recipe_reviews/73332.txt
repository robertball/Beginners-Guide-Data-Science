This recipe has many good attributes including quick prep/cook time and few but interesting ingredients. However the result is a bit bland and leaves something to be desired--particularly salt and seasonings. I had garlic & wine salt on-hand and used it liberally with a dash of hot pepper. My co-chef suggested that chopped up red pepper might do the trick in the future.

When I was in Tahiti....this was in the buffet of a 5 star hotel. I asked the chefs how to make it...They use HAM/bacon and Chicken boullion and lots of vidalia onions. It is SO DELICIOUS THIS WAY I WOULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THEY LET ME TALK TO THE CHEF!. I use it with boiled potatoes instead of the rice...it is much much better..more true stew like.

I really didn't like this. It was so bland... Only substitutions I made were brown rice and fresh spinach.

I read other reviews before trying this recipe and here goes: I had prepared the chicken with marinade of cajun spices and olive oil before cooking. I added in some frozen peas and chopped pecans while simmering. I served with steamed potato (no rice in the cupboard!) and it was great!
