Very good!   I added one chopped jalapeno pepper and it was a huge hit.

I'm definitely not a fan of slow cooker recipes, but this one worked, although I'm not convinced that it couldn't be done just as easily on top of the stove.  Regardless, it tastes good, we liked it!

I doubled it for a large family gathering; rounding up the corn to  5 small bags (10 cups), bacon to the full package and 3 containers of chive and onion cream cheese.  It was delicious and quickly became the most requested dish to bring when when our family gets together!

I loved this recipe!  I left the bacon out just because Thanksgiving already has an obscene amount of calories.  I also used canned corn and it cut down the cooking time.   It was awesome even without the bacon!  I will be adding this to all future Thanksgiving dinners!

Great recipe! I made it for a family get together and everyone loved it. I used 4 small bags of frozen corn and a whole red bell pepper. I left out the bacon and it still came out great.

This was delicious. Corn is the only vegetable my family will eat so what a treat to have a variation! A keeper.

This recipe was excellent!   Only thing substitution (because My grocers didnt have) was I subbed Allouette "garlic & herb" spread for the "onion &  chive" cream cheese.

I may make this again. It was easy and all gone by the end of the party, so people enjoyed it. Probably wouldn't change anything unless I added a jalapeno as some have suggested.

I unfortunately did not enjoy this as I had hoped.  Too much cream cheese that left a bad after taste.  I would cut the cream cheese in half.

So good, just as written!  This was a big hit at my family's Thanksgiving.  The recipe didn't seem to specify, so I used canned corn (both yellow and white), and it turned out great.

I loved this recipe it had a southwestern taste to it, someone at Thanksgiving suggested that next time I try adding some black beans to it and serve it with tortilla chips as a sort of dip and I may try that next time. It was definitely a hit and will definitely be making it again.

So yummy. I did 1/2 the cream cheese this recipe calls for and it was a soy, dairy, egg free cream cheese and it was still a bit too rich. Next time I want to add some jalape√±o and a little less cream cheese :)
