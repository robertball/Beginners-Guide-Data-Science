This was such great recipe, they turned out awesome.  I just divided the dough up into 16 balls and baked them on a cookie sheet, instead of putting them in muffin tins.  Then before I baked them, I brushed them with a beaten egg instead of butter.  Then I scored the top of them.  They had a nice, glossy crust, and were just the right size for sandwiches! I also used all white flour instead of the wheat flour.  If you use all white flour, you just have to add a little bit more flour and knead a little bit longer for the gluten to develop.  And then I divided the dough up into buns and baked them in a 9x13 for white dinner rolls.  They came out so good! Thanks so much for this great recipe!

I cut this recipe down to 12 servings. I made two small changes; I used milk instead of water and I doubled the yeast, using two envelopes fora halved recipe. (The reason I did this was because I've always had issues making whole wheat bread/rolls so I wanted to be sure this one would work.) I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to make these rolls. I proofed the yeast with the sugar and warm milk in my mixer bowl for ten minutes, then added the beaten egg, melted butter, then all the dry ingredients. This dough needed 3/4 cup more flour to form a ball. I kneaded it with my dough hook for five minutes, then set it to rise on a warm heating pad in a greased and covered bowl for an hour. Once it doubled, I formed the rolls using a dry 1/4 inch measuring cup and set the formed rolls in a greased muffin tin. I set them to rise again on the warm heating pad, covered with saran wrap, for a half hour. 400* for 12 minutes and they were perfect. I brushed the tops with vegetable right out of the oven, as it gives them soft, bakery style tops. These rolls are absolutely delicious. I was worried that the sugar might be too much but it's really not. They're perfectly chewy but they also came out light and fluffy. Like something you'd get at a fancy bakery. VERY good. I'll use this recipe again. I think this would be really good with honey or light brown sugar in place of the granulated sugar, too.

I am giving this recipe 5 stars b/c I love the Black-Eyed Pea Restaurant's wheat rolls and on my first try to replicate them tried this recipe. End of search! Thanks for the recipe.

I did the initial mixing and first rising in my bread machine. I was tempted to skip the second rising, but didn't. These rolls are worth the extra effort!! They are possibly the best wheat rolls I have ever eaten. The dough seemed a little difficult to work with (very elastic!!), but they turned out awesome!

WE LOVE THIS DOUGH I have: Added extra sugar to the dough and used it for cinnamon rolls, ++++++ Shaped it into every shape imaginable (including braided breads for special dinners)+++++++ Rolled it into long ropes, dipped it in a baking soda solution then baked it making pretzels. ++++++ Rolled it flat baked it on a griddle and used it as pan bread/ Flat bread (thicker than tortillas similar to pitas).++++++ Formed it into Pan Pizza Crust ++++++ I very regularly form it into 4 (9" X 15") very thin pizza crusts. I  prebake them (450 deg for 8 minutes) then freeze 3 and add toppings to the 4th for dinner that night.

Susan I love you. Please come live with me. These rolls were so yummy, I can't imagine what else you may have up your sleeve but I want first taste of it. I am planning a dinner party for tonight so I made these rolls this morning just to make sure they would be good enough for my guests. Well,let me tell you I am definitely going to serve them with my Prime Rib. My search for the perfect wheat dinner roll has ended.

Bread bakers hint! After the second rising, turn the dough out onto a clean surface and cover it with the bowl you had it in. Let it sit for about 10 or 15 minutes.  The dough will be much easier to stretch and will be less elastic. Especially helpful when trying to stretch pizza dough into a pan!   

I have been baking bread for decades and found this recipe to be a true winner.  The rolls are pleasantly light, even delicate.  Don't be tempted to skip the second rising, that's what gives bread a fine crumb.  Great recipe Katrina, thank you so much for sharing it with us.

I made this recipe into cinnamon rolls and I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to knead the dough.  I followed the recipe exactly, EXCEPT that it needed more flour to pull away from the sides of the bowl.  (I added 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all-purpose).  After the first rise, I punched the dough down and split it in half.  I rolled one half into a uniform loaf shape and baked it in a large loaf pan at 350 degrees until golden on top. -- I pressed out the other half into a large rectangle, brushed it with butter and sprinkled with lots of cinnamon and sugar.  I rolled it up, cut into 12 rolls/slices, placed them in muffin tins, covered and refrigerated overnight.  Then I baked them the next morning at 400 degrees.  Turned out great!!

Thank you for sharing this recipe with the rest of us. It is absolutely delicious!  Upon the suggestion of a few other reviews I added extra sugar (2/3C instead of 1/2C).  I also had to add an extra cup of (wheat) flour because my dough was sticky at first too.  Everyone should eat these at least once!

Wow!  These rolls turned out fantastic!  Nice yummy crust on top, soft, light texture inside.  I used only 1/4 cup of sugar, and I added 1 tablespoon of vital wheat gluten too.  As one of the other reviewers did, I made cinnamon rolls out of half the batch, and they too were delicious.  I'll be making these again to impress my friends and family.

This is a delicious recipe.  I followed it exactly, except for reducing the amount of butter spread on top,  Oh, I cheated and didn't roll them out, but just pinched off balls and made plain old rolls.  I noticed that there were some comments giving this fewer stars because "the rolls don't have any flavor" or something similar.  Please!  This is not a recipe for garlic rolls, or savory herb rolls, or hot and spicy rolls (although as others have mentioned, it can be adapted to be such). This is a recipe for light wheat rolls, and that is exactly what you get.  Those of us who appreciate good bread in and of itself without any need for added flavor, this is a keeper recipe.  I did a triple batch and used my Bosch mixer to mix them, and it worked the dough just fine.    This recipe is also definitely toddler approved.  My 15 month old has had two already, and they are barely out of the oven!

These rolls are fabulous. I use honey and olive oil for the sugar and butter, and brush with egg white right before baking instead of butter. I make these at least once a month and keep in my freezer. Every time I try another roll, we decide these are still the best. They are a staple on our dinner table!

I've made bread before and always found it a little bit tricky.  This is the first time I made rolls, though, and I was glad that they turned out well.  The one problem I had is that my dough was too sticky - I had to add more flour.  I shaped the rolls into little braids and baked them on a sheet of aluminium foil.  I'd certainly make them again.

Tasted great, but I couldn't figure out how to "spiral" them and make them look good.  Next time I will just roll them into balls.  Thanks though!

Holy Cow these are the BEST bread I have ever made!  I halved the recipe but still used 1 full egg.  I was out of butter so I used my last bits of SmartBalance margarine...still short but you can't tell anything is wrong!  Used my lazy no-dishes method:  I mixed in the KitchenAid with the hook and didn't mix anything or beat egg 1st, etc.. just dumped it in and let it knead for a good long time.  Once it pulls away I flour one hand and pull the dough out for a second.  With the other hand I Misto olive oil right in the bowl... dough back in and cover with towel.  Leave it right there to "punch down" with the mixer hook just a few secs and rest again.  I made 12 balls and nested in a 10in circle silicone cake pan.  AMAZING pull apart bread with just some honey on top.  I didn't butter them before or after baking.  They are so good you don't need it!

For those of you out there that love rolls......but, cannot find the one recipe that makes you rave......this is it!!!  I promise if you follow this recipe as I tell you too, you will never use another recipe for rolls again. Using this recipe I substituted plain flour for the wheat flour. (using about 4 and a half to five cups of flour total)Instead of using two packets of yeast, use 3.  When you add your yeast to your water, add a teaspoon of sugar. ( this helps the yeast to froth) Everything else, do exactly as the recipe calls for.......DELICIOUS!!!!

Incredible! I did make a few adjustments, but I still had to go with 5 stars because they were so amazing. I used honey for the sugar ( and a little with the yeast), three packs of yeast instead of two, all whole wheat flour(about 1/4 cup less), and I brushed the tops with egg whites instead of butter. I ended up freezing half of them.They were so easy to "reheat", or finish at a few moments notice. When I needed to serve an impromptu lunch for out of town guests, these went perfectly with  bean soup and a tossed salad. Thank you!

After spending three hours preparing the bread, it was just OK. The bread had a sweeter taste and lacked flavor.I definitely would not make them again unless I found a way to add some more flavor.

Made the dough in the bread machine and did not use the "spiral" method but rather divided the dough into 24 balls.  They turned out too be one of the biggest hits at my Easter table!  Very good!  Thank you for sharing!!

Just what I was looking for....light and airy! I used all "white whole wheat flour" (King Arthur organic 100% whole wheat) and Hodson Mill yeast for whole grains. I used less butter on the tops- didn't measure. I made one beautiful, large loaf of bread, and nine cloverleaf rolls. The only change I will make in the future is to add an extra teaspoon of salt, the recipe needs more flavor.

Although I didn't incorporate the spiral look, these rolls came out wonderfully.  The only thing I did differently was use a little less white sugar and put in about three tablespoons of honey.  I am looking forward to making another batch of these soon!  Thanks for posting such a great recipe!

I shaped the dough into balls and put them into a 9x13 pan.  They came out light and fluffy.  Just perfect!  I made them for our Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow and my kids wont quit eating them.  I am going to have to get up early to make another recipe!!!  Geez!  Awesome recipe!  Thanks!

Made these over the weekend....very good and easy to make.  I made a couple changes though....I used only 1/8 cup melted butter, instead of sugar I used 1/4 c honey. Also, I sprayed the tops w/butter flavor PAM instead of melted butter....my husband loved them. This recipe is a definite keeper.

These were very soft and fluffy.  I baked them on a cookie sheet for 8 min, then froze them.  Now I can pop them one or two at a time in the oven at 350 for 3 min and I have fresh hot rolls.  Thanks for all the suggestions.  My husband said this recipie was definately a keeper.

These are absolutely delicious - a big hit at Thanksgiving dinner.  One of the things I liked most about them is that they stay "tender" for longer than most yeast rolls I've made.  Great recipe, Susan!

Yummy! These rolls are my 2nd attempt ever at making bread from scratch.  (First one being a total failure) I wasn't confident to attempt the pinwheel portion, so I just made them into normal rolls and they are light, fluffy, slightly sweet and very melt-in-your-mouth worthy.  I will be keeping this recipe to make again in the future!

Oh My Gosh!  These are delicious!  I used honey instead of sugar and like others, just made balls on a cookie sheet.  I am sure the shaped rolls are beautiful but I didn't want to go to all that trouble.  This is my new fav. for wheat.  Thanks Susan!

I've been looking for a way to "trick" my husband into eating more whole grains, and these rolls did just that.  I froze some and had some trouble reheating them per recipe directions, but then again, I am impatient and forgetful.  One note, however, these rolls are awfully sweet.  Next time I make them, I will probably reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup.

These rolls took less time than the recipe said.  They were wonderful! Light and fluffy.  Our dinner guest said,"I don't even have to ask if these are homemade, I can just smell that they are."

Umm, wow, these surprised me! They are soft, flaky, sweet, and rich tasting. I have not had a wheat roll like this. I decided to try the dough cycle on my Zojirushi bread machine to make this a quick and easy recipe. When the dough cycle was over I proceeded to step 4. I did only do a half a recipe, and I am glad I did because the dough had risen to the top of my bread machine container. When it was done I plopped the dough out onto a parchment lined baking sheet. I realized it was way too wet. I ended up adding a scoop of all-purpose flour. I didn't measure it, but it may have been a 1/2 a cup of so. I used the flour to maneuver the dough and make it not stick. I used a pastry wheel to cut the dough as suggested in 6 pieces and then in half. It is difficult to get them all precisely the same size. So, some of my rolls weren't so large as others and the rolled appearance looked quite frankly slightly different on each. I followed all of the ingredients only using Gold Medal white whole wheat, a lighter colored wheat grain, for the whole wheat flour. I sprayed my Cuisinart non-stick muffin pan with Bakers Joy and let them rise in it for 30 minutes. I baked then, because they were nearly doubled in size. They took about 15 minutes. Note, the last butter ingredient should be divided. ty

This is a fantastic recipe. I added about 1/4 of wheat gluten and used the All Natural/All Purose flour from Costco. They were chewy and had a nice crust. Each dough ball should be about 2 oz.

This is my second time making this recipe, but I didn't make them into rolls. I made it into a loaf of bread! It was so good. The bread is great. I love how soft and moist it is. I followed the recipe as written, except I made it into a loaf, of course :)

These rolls are so yummmmy. I made them the other day in a bread machine and they turned out great, my family loved too. I am definitly going to try this bread again but I am going to make half because we are not a crowded family, so 2 dozen was too much for us. I made some changes. I used 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil instead of butter. I used two spoon honey instead of sugar(i don't like sweet bread. I put all the ingridiens in my breadmachine and in two hours they were ready to cook. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

These are great!!  So delicious.  The whole family loves them.  I'm all proud of myself because they turned out so well.  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly; just had to add extra flour in when I was kneading.  The directions are very clear and precise, which is nice for someone like me who hasn't made a lot of rolls.  I could see how these would make great cinammon rolls.  I baked 6 for dinner tonight; and followed the directions for freezing the others.  Baked for 8 minutes, cool and freeze.  I'll save those ones for Thanksgiving.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I made the dough for half of a recipe in my bread maker.  The only thing I changed in the recipe was that I used all whole wheat flour and no all purpose flour.  These turned out fantastic!  Our one friend was over for dinner and was raving about how good the rolls were.  Even the kids (5 and 3) gobbled these up.  I'm going to be making them for Thanksgiving dinner instead of my normal recipe.  Thanks so much for these!

These were terrific!  I put 1/4c melted butter, 1c brown sugar, and 1T cinnamon on half the dough before rolling up, and they made great cinnamon rolls too!  Then I frosted with a cream cheese icing and we had delicous rolls with dinner and cinnamon rolls for dessert too! mmmmm....

I posted this recipe and I still make them yet today.  Just made them for Thanksgiving this year because my sister in law always requests them.  Everybody seems to love them.  I've never had any problems with the dough as some have suggested.  They are actually easy and very user friendly.  If you don't want to eat them the same day you make them, only bake them for 8 minutes, let cool and freeze or refrigerate.  Once you are ready to bake, bake 5-7 minutes depending on desired doneness.Frozen ones must be thawed first. Happy to know so many are enjoying them. Katrina Susan

They were a bit too light and bland for me. . . Perhaps they just need a tad more salt and/or sugar.

Not bad, but not worth all the effort/rising time. . . I've had much better.

These are fabulous rolls.  I didn't go through the extra labor of spiraling the dough, I just made 20 equal sized balls and set them onto a cookie sheet and slit an x on the top of each one for decoration.  I bought some to the restaurant where I work and the chef thought I bought them at the bakery.  Not sure if I should be pleased or insulted.. ;)  Thanks for the recipe Katrina!

I have been making these rolls for over a year now and they have NEVER failed. I always get great comments on them. They have a great texture and are just YUMMY. I follow the recipe almost exactly, only omitting the second 1/4 cup of butter (would taste great, but I don't miss it one bit and it cuts the fat in half). I also just divide the dough into balls and bake. Takes much less time and my family doesn't mind the less gourmet presentation.

These were so yummy and so easy to make!  I have been baking bread for quite a few years. I think I finally found my favorite roll recipe!  I used 1/4 c. oil instead of butter and they turned out so light and fluffy!  My three young sons loved them.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

FINALLY!!! A really good wheat roll. I have tried numerous recipes trying to get my family to eat more wheat. This one was a HIT! Finally one the kids will eat!  It was easier than I expected to roll. Very pretty plus kids liked unrolling them to eat.  I used my bread machine on 45 mins dough cycle, punched down and rose in a bowl the second time.

Great basic recipe! I substituted honey for the sugar, olive oil for the butter and tied into knots. I also decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp which caused my dough to rise even more and made over 30 rolls! Fairly easy recipe and my family LOVED them! Will definitely make again.

sorry to be one of those people who changes everything and writes a review, but sometimes it's useful to know how versatile a recipe is, right?  I used whole milk instead of water, dissolved a T. of honey in the milk with the yeast, used a generous 1/4 cup of honey instead of sugar, forgot the egg entirely, added a 1/2 cup of rolled oats, and only did two rises (1 hr 15 in the bowl, 40 min on cookie sheets after rolling them into balls).  They rose beautifully, are rich and sweet enough to eat without butter, and may be the nicest dinner rolls I've ever made or eaten.  The wheat flour gives them great body and flavor, and the sweetness is just right: good on their own, but not too sweet to eat with savory dishes.  For more flavor if I ever plan far enough in advance, I might let the dough sit in the fridge overnight after one rise, punch it down and let it rise again at room temp for an hour before shaping, and then rise again before baking--I bet that would be divine.  But as is, it's a flexible recipe for soft, sweet rolls you could shape in any number of ways.  Next time I'll try to remember the egg!

A little too dense for me, but very attractive. I'd like them to be fluffier. I have a feeling it was my lack of kneading skills that was the problem, though, not the recipe!

So good, so easy.  We used the Kitchen Aid Mixer for the mixing and kneading and it really helped cut the time in half.  We'll certainly make these again!

My husband LOVES these rolls.  They are pretty sweet and easy to do.  The less flour you can put in them, the fluffier they are.  I have found that putting butter on the rolls before they rise makes them stick to my towel.  I place a dry towel on them, let them rise in the muffin pans, and then just put butter on them after they come out of the oven.  Yummy!

This recipe works great in the bread machine - I don't even melt the butter!   My family loves it.  I did add 4 tsps gluten and have also increased the amount of whole wheat flour and decreased the all-purpose flour.  I have also tried 1/4 cup olive oil - great!

The rolls from this recipe turned out very good.  I've looking for a softer wheat roll recipe.  I used my bread machine to do all the hard work and I only let it rise one time.  Turned out great even without the additional rising time.

These rolls are fabulous.  They taste like restaurant quality.  I didn't bake them in the muffin tins - just on a cookie sheet and they turned out so good.  I topped mine with olive oil.  You have to make these - they are worth the effort!

This recipe.produces nice light buns, with almost half whole wheat. Not perfectly healthy but certainly better than a white bun, and much better than store bought. I've made them at least four times and our family loves them. i've gotten better at making the roll part - I am tempted each time to just make a ball but like the light texture so I keep rolling them up as per the recipe.

I cut the amount of sugar in half (diabetic husband) & let the bread machine do most of the work. I followed the rest of the directions to the letter. These rolls were fantastic!! Light & airy, two words not usually associated with whole wheat backed goods! I plan to make these often & will do a little experimenting to try to cut down on the amount of all purpose flour while still keeping the fantastic crumb. Thanks for the recipe!!

These rolls were so light, fluffy, and delicious that I will now use this recipe instead of my old one!

I used half milk and half water, honey instead of sugar, and mixed grains instead of whole wheat flour. I also didn't have a muffin tin so I shaped the rolls and put them on a baking sheet. The dough had a perfect texture and elasticity for shaping into braids, knots, and spirals. They rise really high and fluffy.

I'm making them again for a pot-luck tomorrow so I'll be sure to get a picture!

Oh my goodness... I just took these out of the oven and they're just perfect!! I've never had such light wheat rolls before! I didn't add anything at all to the recipe.. I did use the bread machine to knead the dough, just because it's easier for me. AMAZING!! Going into my recipe box!!

Yum! I have tried many bread recipes for my family in the last few years, and my mom told me that this one was the best; in fact, I think I will always use this recipe for bread from now on! I made the rolls as described in the recipe, although I rolled out a sheet of dough, spread the butter, and then used floss to cut off rolls (like with a cinnamon roll recipe), which I then put in silicone muffin tins. I only did this with 1/3 the dough; I also made cinnamon rolls with 1/3 of the dough by spreading rolled out dough with melted butter and then sprinkling with cinnamon sugar/Splenda before rolling, cutting with floss, and placing in 9x13 pan. With the final third, I rolled the dough into rope lengths and then tied it in knots for some pretty rolls. The melted butter on top is unnecessary, in my opinion. I did substitute honey for 1/3 cup of the sugar and add 2 Tbsp wheat gluten, and I always use I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Light instead of real butter. Also, I ended up using a total of 3 C white whole wheat flour (from King Arthur Flour) and approx. 4 C all-purpose flour. Try this recipe!!

These are awesome. I've made them twice and both times they have turned out great. I always just roll them into balls and bake them on a cookie sheet. Brush some egg white on top for a nice shiny look. They are delicious!

Yum... delish!!! I used some cornmeal for AP, onion powder, garlic, and reduced sugar to 1/4 cup( used 2 TB to proof and added rest later). The first rise about tripled in size with all the yeast, I was surprised! Shaped into buns, baked nicely. Thanks for sharing, I'll make again!

These were wonderful!  I assembled the ingredients as instructed, but instead of doing the whole muffin tin fiasco I just divided the dough into 24 equal parts and rolled it out and and baked on oiled cookie sheets.  Oh, and did an egg wash instead of brushing butter over the dough bals.  Everyone at dinner loved them.  Time consuming, yes....but totaly worth it.  Thanks for sharing!!!  :)

This is a keeper!!  First of all, I decided to let my bread machine do the work, but wasn't sure if the machine was able to handle a full recipe.  So I cut if in half and used the whole egg.  During the first knead the dough was way to sticky so added additional tablespoons of whole wheat flour till the dough seemed right.  Baked at 350* for about 15 minutes.  Beautiful rolls, light, fluffy, with a slightly sweet taste.  Thanks, Katrina - yummy is right on.

Love this as pizza dough as a previous reviewer suggested. Makes 4 good-sized pizzas, and by partially baking and keeping them frozen, it's a great way to fulfill that pizza craving in a reasonably healthy way!

These were very yummy and picturesque. Perfectly golden and soft outside, soft, tender and fluffy inside. The flavor was good too, overall, more than I was expecting from half whole wheat rolls. (I reduced the sugar by half, and I think that makes it  taste better unless you want a sweet roll)

This recipe rocks!  I have gone through a lot of recipes for rolls, and now this is hands-down the only one I make.  I get orders for them at Christmas and Thanksgiving.  I never make the fancy spirals, just put them as balls of dough on a cookie sheet.  They come out looking like they came from a bakery.

I give this recipe 4 stars. The buns turned out well and were SUPER pretty easy to make, but the process was time consuming and I had to improvise a little bit.    I found that the original recipes didn't call for enough flour.  I added about an extra cup and a half of whole wheat flour.    I'd definatley try this one for cinamon buns- the dough turned out kinda sweet and would be excellent with brown sugar  and cinamon.    This recipe is definatley a keeper!

Heavenly! I take each rectangle of dough, brush it with butter, and roll it up jelly-roll style. Then I slice it into 1 inch medalions. It seems a little faster to me than rolling each strip individually, and I love the way they pull apart when you eat them with butter in between each layer. Awesome recipe: thanks!

This recipe was very, very good. They turned out soft and chewy. We served them with sweet cream butter (since the rolls themselves are not super sweet), and they were a hit! Will definitely make again.

I revised this recipe a little to my own liking and based on other recipes I have read recently. I added a tsp of baking soda and a 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder and substituted 1/4 cup of organic honey for the sugar. Also I used a total of 2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and used only the amount of white flour needed to get the dough firm. The rolls were great, very hardy!

Ok so I have to admit I altered this quite a bit, but the recipe as it is is an excellent recipe for rolls! I was rolling these out when my daughter said she'd like some cinnamon raisin bread. SO, what I did was to mix 3/4 cup sugar with 1 TBSP cinnamon and sprinkle it on the strips after they were cut. Then I sprinkled with raisins and rolled as the recipe directed. The outcome was FANTASTIC. I have done these as written and they're very good. But they're stellar with cinnamon and raisins or pecans. Thank you for the recipe!!

these rolls did not turn out light and fluffy as other reviews have said. i had trouble kneading the dough. it was very sticky so i had to add quite a bit more flour, which i think may have made them more dense.

Wow, wow, wow!! These rolls came out perfectly - and so easy. I followed the directions exactly for preparing and baking. I did end up using more whole wheat flour and less all-purpose flour, and used HONEY in place of the sugar, which I think always tastes better in bread or rolls. Fantastic recipe - this is a keeper and I will use it often.

Delicious, light and yummy!  I have made 8 batches in 1 week!  My family loves them and at my kids request, I now make sandwich rolls for their lunches.  No more buying bread for us.  I halved the recipe and used my bread machine using the dough cycle. Let rise about an hour.  For me, the cooking time was exactly 10 mins @ 400*.  I made 3 batches yesterday alone.  I froze 2 so that they would be reaily available when I'm short on time.
Try using your cookie cutters (biscuit size) to make theme rolls...pumkins for halloween, turkeys for Thanksgiving, etc.  They turn out so cute and it makes the event more festive.

I love these rolls - they do take some time but definitely worth it.  I have found that I need to add at least a 3/4 cup flour.  I do not roll them out but make into balls that I put into muffin pan.  They have a slightly sweet yeasty flavor.

I baked this recipe for the first time today for my parents and myself. My parents are not fans of wheat, both of Congestive Heart Failure and Diabetes. So I made a few changes I used Morton's Lite Salt for instead of regular salt (for the CHF) and I used Splenda instead of the white sugar. Both of my parents said they were great rolls. Oh I didn't do the spiral thing, I just rolled them into balls. I ran out of time to do anything, but that. Great recipe!

I have made these rolls several ways several times......i make then  cinnamon rolls by adding cinamon to the dough while mixing then mixing butter brown sugar cinnamon and cream cheese to get a good paste...may family loves them!!! I am going to try making them with milk instead of eggs next time....i've made them with honey, sugar, and brown sugar, either way i think it adds to the taste, i dont ever reduce the sugar content. I also add garlic salt, chilli powser, or lemon pepper to the dough before kneading sometimes to mix it up a bit.....also i have made these with all wheat flower and not added any all purpose flour and they dont rise as well (obviously) but they are still soft and fluffy and delicious!! Everyone raves about these rolls ANYTIME i make then and i make then AT LEAST once a week...i will be using this recipe for the rest of my life!

These rolls are pretty good.  Like many others, I used honey instead of sugar, but after tasting them, I believe that I should have used only 1/4 c. as they were a little sweet for our tastes.  I ended up adding quite a bit more flour, probably close to 1 1/2 c. to get the dough pliable and I used Pam spray rather than butter.  A good recipe, but honestly, I like the frozen rolls that I get at the grocery store just as well and they are a lot easier!  Thanks for your submission, Susan!

Well, I thought these lacked some flavor, but got great reviews on them from others. I did use milk instead of water, added a tsp. more salt, and used brown sugar instead of white sugar (I bet honey would be wonderful and add to the flavor!). I used my breadmaker and watched it while it was mixing--had to add more flour-about 1/2 cup more. The dough was still sticky, so I sprayed non-stick spray on my hands when it came time to make the rolls-worked well. The rolls (which Imade just round ones) were fluffy, springy and light :) Next time I might add a 1/2 tsp more salt or even the honey to make these less bland.

These rolls have a good texture and that's about it.  They are cooked too hot which means the outside is dark and the inside is doughy.  Not only that, but they are sicky-sweet.  With a lot of tweeking it could be a good recipe, but as-is it falls really short.

These were easy to make and looked very nice when they were done. I baked them for 8 minutes, froze them, then thawed and baked them again for 5 minutes when I needed them.

I have never attempted to make bread or rolls before, but finally decided to use this recipe as a first attempt.  I am SOOO glad I did!! These rolls are absolutely wonderful!! I didn't roll the dough or use muffin tins, but simply shaped into balls and let rise the last time on cookie sheets.  They are fantastic!! Thanks so much for a delicious and easy recipe!!

This look very pretty but I found them lacking in flavor. If I were to try the recipe again, I would use milk instead of water, honey instead of sugar, or maybe add puréed squash or mashed potatoes for extra flavor and moisture.

Fabulous rolls -  good flavor and texture.  The only change I made was to use bread flour instead of the all-purpose flour.  Not only are they delicious, but very attractive too.

These were soft and really good. I substituted canola oil for the melted butter and I brushed them with olive oil before baking to make them dairy free. I also used white whole wheat flour. I've made a lot of roll recipes and this one is one of my favorites. I will definitely be making these again.

Delicious!  When I make these, I only make half a recipe, so I use the remaining half egg and add a bit of sugar and some milk to brush on the tops instead of butter.  These rolls are delightful and not at all finicky.

This is an excellent and relatively healthy recipe. I used all whole wheat flour (I ran out of all-purpose). I made two batches - the first with the brushed butter on top, and the second without. I actually like them better without the brushed butter! They keep for several days and are great re-heated.

This recipe is VERY forgiving!
Making these was my first experiment with yeast bread. I made some changes and mistakes, but the bread was still great! I have food intolerances and cannot eat store bought bread, so I decided to make a loaf and rolls. I used olive oil in place of butter, used 2.75 cups ww flour and about 1.5 cups AP flour, put too much dough in the loaf pan, made each roll too big and accidentally set the oven to 450 instead of 400. With all of my changes, the bread tasted great after 11 minutes. The crust is a little dark (but not burnt tasting) and the inside was soft and delicious. I will make this recipe again and cook at the correct temperature.
Thank you, I can eat bread again!

This was the first bun recipe I ever tried, and it turned out perfectly!  I won't keep looking, as this tastes great, and I feel with the whole wheat flour, it must be 'healthier' than some.  I use yeast from a jar, and according to earlier reviewers and web searches .25 oz = 1/2 tblsp, so as is, the recipe needs 1 tbspl of yeast.

Excellent. The rolls are light with a wonderful crust and everyone in the family loved them. I think this may be the recipe that convinces me to ditch the bread maker and just make bread by hand. By far the best bread I've ever made.

I did the kneading in my kitchen aid and just rolled the dough into balls to make regular rolls. Also, cut down on the baking time a bit. Delish!

These are fantastic!  Hands down the best bread I've made so far.  I even messed up and they still turned out great.  I only had one packet of yeast, so I halved the recipe.  The thing is I forgot to half the water.  Woops.  I just added more flour until I got the right dough consistency and ended up getting 18 rolls from the batch.  Delish!

I have to agree with the submitter of this recipe.  These rolls are not hard to make, but they do take quite a bit of time due to the multiple rise times.  I love how they turn out, in their spiral shape, just a little browned with their nutty wheat flavor.  They were the perfect roll to go with our navy bean soup!

This makes really yummy wheat bread.  It's just the right amount of sweetness to counter the bitter wheat flour.  Easy to make too.  I made 12 rolls and two french bread style loaves.  I did make some alterations that worked really well.  I reduced the wheat flour to 2 cups and used 2 3/4 cups of bread flour instead of all purpose.  I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup honey.  I used 2 Tbsp of melted butter and 2 Tbsp of Olive Oil.  I also used half water and half milk for the 1 3/4 cup of water.  We will definitely have this bread again - it's a house favorite now.

Great recipe! This does indeed produce tender, fluffy rolls...you can hardly even tell that they contain whole wheat! They are also really pretty, with the pop-up swirl. The one problem I had with this recipe, though, is that there seemed to be to much dough. Some of the rolls got way to big...instead of the swirl popping out cinnamon-roll style, they got huge and spread out of the muffin pan, sticking to the roll next to it. When I make these again, I'll use some of the dough to make other rolls before I roll and cut, as stated in the recipe. Thanks for sharing...this is a great recipe!

These were pretty good, but they felt a little bland. I wonder if adding some honey would help. We did 15 minutes and it was a little long - I'd say shoot for 13-14.

These rolls are fabulous! They are very light, and very tasty. I decrease the oven temperature to 350 for a loaf (it makes 2), and bake for 23-27 minutes. For hamburger buns, shape into a baker's dozen (I like them big!), flatten slightly, 20 minute rise, then bake at 380 for 10-12 minutes. One of my very favorite recipes.

I use this one more than any other roll recipe.  I back out some ww flour, maybe 1/4 cup, and add wheat bran. I never spiral, usually divide then cut each into 4 pieces before putting into muffin cups.

Great as is!  Even my fan of white bread husband really liked them.  I even snuck in a little more whole wheat and did 2 3/4 C whole wheat and 2 C bread flour.  I seperated the dough in halves at the the end and then rolled each half up and sliced as I would when making cinnamon rolls with a piece of thread.   Less time and effort with the same results.

Very nice--didn't change a thing ingredient wise.  I halved the recipe and made the dough in the bread machine.  Although I was intrigued by the swirls, I didnt make them bc I wanted sandwich rolls.  I made 8 rolls out of the halved recipe, which gave me some good sized rolls for meatball sandwiches.  I baked for about 25 minutes and they were perfect.  Bf didn't seem to notice they had ww flour, which is always a plus.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe to start out with, when you are experimenting with whole wheat flour!  Mine turned out to be very nice looking and tasted great.  I will definately make these again...thanks for the recipe.

This was just OK to me. It took a lot of work, and the taste wasn't that great. I was bummed that they didn't stay risen when I cooked them in the final stretch. I know that they're wheat rolls, but the wheat was pretty overpowering. My parents liked them though. Thanks! I was glad to have the experience making rolls.

Very true, these are not complicated to make, just a lot of rising time.  My guests were very impressed they were from scratch, and my husband said they looked professional.  I  thought the texture was also light yet chewy.  The best part:  You can partially cook them, freeze and then complete the baking when ready.

these were not quite what i was looking for. they were nice and crusty with soft and moist insides, but there was just something about them. maybe it's my whole-wheat flour. i would not discourage others from trying this recipe

I made this and my kids loved it. It was well worth the time it takes. I just shaped in balls on a cookie sheet. I made larger ones so my kids could use for sandwiches, smaller ones for soup or dinner. I need to try making a loaf of it next. Best recipe ever!

I have tried a lot of wheat rolls and these are the only ones my family loved! They were a little sweet, but I used Splenda instead of Sugar and will just use a little less next time, otherwise they were moist and delicious!! Will make these again and again and again.

To start, I am still new to the art of cooking, at age 18 years old. 
This has been one of my most outstanding accomplishments yet, a successful bread! The only change I made was having the number of buns I made (this chage was accidental...) and only meant a little longer in the oven, and larger fluffy buns!

Thanks for the great recipe, I cant wait to serve some fresh buns tonight with dinner.

These were also yummy as pretzels. I cooked the pretzels at 375 after brushing them with melty butter and salting them. The rolls overcooked at 400 and 375 at 9 minutes and undercooked at for 350 for 9 minutes. Good flavor but twice now I haven't been able to get a good cook on the rolls. I would do the pretzels again though

Wow, Katrina, thanks so much for submitting this recipe! I made these in the Kitchen Aid, using the dough hook. I followed the recipe precisely, except it needed less white flour to start pulling away from the bowl. Also, I baked them on cookie sheets, and got a dozen nice-sized rolls. I will be making them again and again.

I opted to make only half of this recipe, I cheated and put the ingredients into the bread machine to make the dough for me and it will only make so much dough at once :)  These rolls rise up very nicely and are beautiful!  They aren't big on flavor but I found when we ate these with our meal that they were perfect.  These are great rolls to make if you have company coming over because they honestly look store bought (like a professional baker made them) rather than squirly and weird like some of my rolls have looked in the past, rolling them up like a pinwheel is brilliant.

Very easy recipe and the taste was great.  I made them exactly as recipe suggests, except that I cloverleafed mine.  Dough was a little sticky as I'd previously read, but other than flouring my hands to punch it down twice, did not add additional flour.  Results were terrific.  I'll definitely make these again and plan to add fresh herbs (dill or rosemary) with some garlic to add flavor and interest.  But they are great as they are.

Excellent-- great flavor and texture! Because of cholesterol concerns, I substituted canola oil for the butter in the dough and did not brush tops with melted butter. Still soooo good!

Very easy recipe. Light and fluffy. Didn't follow the ricipe exactly. Added 1/2 cup of brown sugar in addition to the 1/2 cup of white sugar. And added 1 tsp. more of salt.  Other wise followed recipe as written.

These were really pretty simple to make.  It took a little longer than I thought it was going to take to rise, but that could have been my kitchen.
Great idea to roll them out..kids liked the shape.

Fantastic recipe, turns out wonderful every time. One thing that did take me off guard was how sweet these rolls are - they're *sweet*! Really nice as rolls served with a dinner of meat and potatoes, but definitely not a sandwich roll, if that makes sense. (Note: as a salt hound, I'm biased - it could very well be these are perfect for 99.9% of the population's sandwiches and I'm the weirdo.) I've made the recipe cutting the sugar in half too and it's turned out terrific.

To make this easier, you don't have to worry about rolling them up.  When I'm in a rush, I just roll the dough into balls and bake it like that.  Still turns out great!

They were a bit denser than I expected but they looked beautiful. I made some into cinnamon rolls and they were pretty tasty.

My bread-making attempts usually turn out for the worse, but my mother had me make these for the holiday meal, and I tried them on my own later-- both times they turned out wonderfully! I didn't roll them up into spirals but made little dinner rolls on a cookie sheet, as I prefer, and they baked out very evenly. Well-worth the extra rising times.

I made these rolls to take with me for Christmas dinner.  The hostess also had white dinner rolls that were store bought but my rolls disappeared first.  Everyone raved about them.  One guest even commented that they reminded him of the dinner rolls his late mother use to make when he was a little boy.  I followed the recipe as written and baked them in cake pans instead of muffin tins.  I even had to run to the grocery store while they were rising the first time and was gone for two hours and they still turned out great.  All I can say is that they were delish!  I will be making them again and again.  Thanks for such an easy recipe!

These are awesome, with a few minor adjustments...first I added 1/3 c honey instead of using sugar and second, I added 4 T of gluten which made them so light and fluffy. I’m in heaven!

These were the best rolls I've ever made.  Everyone in my large family were amazed at how great they were.  I added 1 tbsp of vital wheat gluten with the wheat flour and 1 tsp sugar with the yeast, as suggested by another reviewer.  I used by bread hook to knead the dough - 7 minutes on #4 speed.  I did have to add about an extra cup of flour for the dough to stiffen.  I made the the day before Thanksgiving, and they were still fresh and delicious three days later!

These are fantastic! I used a bread machine on the dough cycle but otherwise followed the recipe (allow to rise in bowl, etc).  It started to overflow in the bread machine but not too badly!  I could tell by the feel of the dough that it was just perfect; rose and baked beautifully. Taste is great too!!

I loved this recipe.  I have never had good luck with rolls but this time they turned out great.  I used cane sugar and they were great!  Also subbed the extra 1/2 cup of white flour with pastry ground wheat so it was more healthy. :)

These were so delicious! Hard to stop at just one. Not to strong of a wheat flavor which my kids liked and they were a tad bit sweet.

I made the recipe just as instructed. The only thing I changed was in the forming of the buns. I just rolled balls. These get bigger than I thought, but that is great! I wanted big buns. These are also the lightest rolls I have ever made and look forward to making them again as well as trying some of the changes people suggest.  I also look forward to  trying the freezing option.

This is my family's FAVORITE!! Such an easy bread-making recipe. I freeze all of the rolls we don't eat the first day and then pop them in the microwave as needed - they come out tasting freshly baked!

I love this bread.  I'm getting ready to figure out if I can make it into a loaf or sandwich rolls.  If that works I may never buy a loaf of bread again.

I have only made bread a couple of times.  This recipe was so easy.  I used the proof function on my oven and they rose higher than any other bread I have made.  They were light and fluffy with just a hint of sweet.  My family LOVED them too!  This is my new recipe for rolls.

These rolls are great. I used Splenda not sugar and light margarine not butter and they were amazing. I also used all white flour for a batch for my husband and he loved them.

I halved the recipe but totally forgot to use 1/2 the egg. Still turned out great. I also proofed the yeast by dissolving 1 tsp of sugar in water. I rolled them into little balls and baked them on a cookie sheet. I should have checked on them at 9 minutes because at 11 minutes, they were definitely done, with the bottoms a little darker than what I had wanted. Very light and fluffy little buns - Will definitely make again!

This was a great roll for dinner, my whole family loved it.  I used egg whites instead of an egg, really light and fluffy.  I couldn't roll the dough so I just put it into balls, they turned out fine.  I will be remembering this recipe.

These rolls are wonderfully light and fluffy. I used vegetable oil instead of melted butter in the dough, and they still turned out well.

This is my new holiday bread stand-in. I followed the recipe exactly as written and was not disappointed. I baked it for Thanksgiving and Christmas last year, and will make it for Easter this spring. Always moist and tasty, it's the perfect accompaniment to a homey holiday meal.

This is "the" dinner roll recipe for my family.  No need to look any farther.  I usually save some time by skipping the steps that make them look like swirls.  I just put balls of dough in the muffin tins.  The taste alone is impressive enough.  :)

Great flavor and great texture. I didn't beat them down the second time I instead just let them rise for two hours while I was running errands. I came back, made them into rolls, and let them rise for 40 minutes and popped them in the oven. Delicious!

YUM...very pleased!  Really light and airy...very good and a full proof receipe...even survived my novice boo boos!!  (My yeast didn't proof the first go around, so I added more "live" yeasties mid-way thru he process.  What the heck, there was no stopping the train once we were on it)  Used specialty flours I bought from Whole Foods bulk section...a mix of Gluten Wheat Flour and Organic White... That way I only had to buy what I needed in case this inspiration is short lived. (Ok..I so went for the Organic thing too this go around)  Also added about 1/4 cup of ground Flax seed..cause I had it on hand..a good way to use some of it up.  Increased the Kosher salt I used by another 1/2 of a teaspoon.   Not having made homemade bread for years...I of course was skeptical these would even be eidible especially after all the mishaps, hand kneading, and multiple proofings.  BUT... to my very pleasant surprise...the sturdy little doughball was very resilent, and it turned out wonderful rolls.   Give it a try!!

I have to say first that this is the first recipe that I have given all 5 stars to!!  These rolls are FANTASTIC!  I have made lots of bread and rolls before, but these were by far THE best!  The only change I made was that I substituted half of the All Purpose Flour for White Wheat flour (in addition to the Whole Wheat)  This was definitely the lightest wheat roll I have had.    I ended up with extra dough some how, so on top of making 2 dz rolls, I made a whole loaf too, so I would have one ready, just in case.  Will make this again!!

These rolls are easy, and turn out well every time.   The variations I have made: Use 2 cups white flour, 2 cups WW flour, and then make up the difference with ground flax seed. Also, instead of cutting and rolling them, I have flattened each portion and filled them with seasoned ground beef, curried chick peas, etc.  If trying this, remember to place them pinched end up in the oven- if you put them in pinched side down, the tops will split.

These rolls were good, but I don't think they were the hit that everyone else claims them to be. I'd give them a 3 1/2.

Delicious! Instead of making spirals, I simply rolled them into balls and placed them in muffin cups. They turned into muffins, but that was okay. When I kneaded it, the dough was pretty sticky, so I ended up adding a lot more flour to make a stiff dough. They were really light and fluffy and tasted great dipped in tomato soup. Overall, a great recipe!

I love this recipe this is my third time making them. I use add an extra 1/2 cup of wheat flour we live in a high altitude so it's almost neccessary to add extra flour. This time I rolled them a little smaller and added sesame seeds to make mini cheeseburgers. My family loves these rolls even my son who usually does not like wheat.

The best dinner roll I've made! I meant to half the recipe since I only have 12 muffin tins but forgot so I put half in the muffin tins and half on a cookie sheet. The ones in the tins had a better texture but if you're in a pinch the ones on the cookie sheet were fine. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested microwaving 20 seconds with a mug of water! The leftovers were very good that way.

This is ABSOLUTELY THE BEST recipe for rolls that I've EVER made! I making homemade bread from scratch, but sometimes things don't turn out as good as store-bought so I end up going the easy route. However, my husband and 2 daughters (2 years and 10 months old) LOVE these rolls. They are even FANTASTIC a few days later - just pop them in the microwave alongside a mug of water and heat them for about 20 seconds and they are INCREDIBLE! I do decrease the sugar in half, but otherwise these are THE BEST!

Well, can I give these 4 1/2 stars??  They were just OK as rolls, but they made AWESOME cinnamon rolls!!  I cut the dough in half and made half rolls and half cinnamon rolls.  As the sweeter version, they stayed so nice and soft and didn't dry out when they cooled down (a BIG pet peeve of mine).  I just rolled out the dough, smothered it with a light layer of softened butter and sprinkled on brown sugar and cinnamon.  Yummy!!  My 11 year old son is the non-official "cinnamon roll" taster in our family and he loved these!

Real glad so many are enjoying my light wheat rolls.  I really like the picture that EMU3 posted of them.  That is just what they should look like. ***I've never had a problem with the dough being sticky as some reviewers mentioned.***

Made these with Honey and Whole Wheat flour (no white). Let them rise as supposed to, and did the cloverleaf version in my only muffin tin, and rounds on a cookie sheet for the other half. Made 26 rolls. If I try this again, I'll still try the whole wheat flour, but maybe use sugar to make the dough sweet. I had added 1/3c gluten to ensure rising since I didn't use the white, and they certainly rose, but they still seemed to be lacking in flavor & softness (even after the multiple risings). I don't get it, and I didn't add extra flour to "correct consistency" as it was elastic enough.

OMG! Rarely, does a recipe withstand toddler delay, forgotten ingredients or improper order (thanks to having two small kids), or over-baking (see previous excuse). But even after all that, these were the best rolls i have ever, ever tasted...in fact, i am typing with one hand because the other one is stuffing my face! thank you!

I've been making these rolls for several years now.  They have become a Thanksgiving tradition, and everyone always raves about them.  Instead of making spirals in a muffin pan, I simply tie the strips into a knot and bake on a cookie sheet.

PERFECT!! We loved these. Didn't change a thing except the ratios of flour.. I used more whole wheat and less AP. Made the dough in the bread machine and it turned out beautifully. I made cloverleaf rolls. Yum!

I'd give this about a 3.5. Not bad, but not all that great. They are a little dense, even after I let them rise for over an hour... the taste is a little bland. Would be great if you put Italian Seasonings on it with some olive oil for a focaccia bread.

I must have done something wrong because mine didn't turn out quite right. 
I had the same problem as jd. The dough was too sticky so I added quite a bit more flour and it made them too dense. I also had yeast problems. I don't think my water was quite 110. I need to get a better thermometer. 
I will definetly try these again though. They have the potential to be great if I can get it right.

After reading all the reviews I just had to try this recipe despite its lengthy process.  They were good and looked beautiful,  but mine had an overly "yeasty" flavor and aftertaste.  I'm not sure why.

I enjoyed these. I served them warm at dinner and the whole family ate 'em up.  I'm not sure why they're called "light" though.  I actually subbed olive oil for the butter and skipped the melted butter at the end.  I also increased the whole wheat flour so that the recipe was more than 50% whole wheat.  Next time I might increase it even more.  I made the dough in my bread machine which worked great and instead of doing the spirals, I just made clover leaf rolls.  I will make these again. They were light and fluffy and my daughter, who doesn't like crusty bread or rolls, loved these.

Wow!  What a great recipe! My husband raved about how soft these were.  I rolled them up into the cute little spirals and lay them into a 9 x 13 pan.  They baked sort of like cinnamon rolls.  I substituted olive oil for the butter and I added some Cajun seasoning for a little kick. Even with the Cajon seasoning they were great both sweet with honey and with a pasta meal.  I will definitely be making these again.

SO GOOD! I love the sweet flavor. This will replace my roll recipe that I usually make. And its healthier with the whole wheat flour.

These are great just great. I did half a batch in the breadmaker and made rolls and also made muffins. I used half wheat and half bread flour. I also used half browm sugar and half white sugar. Great a keeper for sure.

I brought this roll to Mother's day dinner for 10, and came home with an empty pan.  My mother-in-law was upset that there were no leftovers!  Nice recipe, could even be beefed up a bit with more whole grain and less white flour.

I tried these for Easter.  I tried to save time and make them ahead on Friday, but they were so good we ate too many that I had to make a second batch on Saturday.  My 2 1/2 year old twins could not eat enough.  The second batch I used 1/4 cup honey--which was also good.

There is not a better way to serve a whole wheat bread to your family than this recipe.  My kids hate whole wheat bread. This is a wonderful tasting bread.  My family thinks it is a special treat.. the buns are so light and tasty.
Amazing!

I made it as is except I just stuck with the traditional shaping of rolls. Afterwards I realized should probably have added a little more flour. End product was great!! Love these rolls!!

Good rolls,  substituted apf for the wheat flour. Brushed with an egg wash for a golden crust.  Too sweet for our taste to have with pulled pork,  however they were great with strawberry shortcake

I didn't have my usual recipe for whole wheat rolls because I wasn't at home, so I found this and thought we'd try. The recipe calls for proofing three times, which is more than I've ever done with dinner rolls. They had very little flavor. I'm going back to a recipe I've used many times before.

Excellent recipe.  I did make 24 standard rolls in a 13x9 pan.  My first time doing a triple rise.  Next time I will increase the whole wheat  and use less sugar.   I used the amount called for white whole wheat and about 3/4 cup bread flour because that was how much I had left and the rest all purpose flour.  Everything else I kept the same.

I was testing several recipes for Thanksgiving....this was by far my family's favorite.  It was a light wheat and I used my bread machine on the dough setting.  The multiple rises made for a longer bread cycle....but it was worth it.  I followed the  recipe exactly, except for adjusting for the bread machine.

This recipe is fantastic. The directions are easy to follow (though I omitted the kneading and used the dough hook on my Kitchen Aid mixer instead). The rolls are beautiful, and the flavor has that slightly nutty whole wheat flavor, without being too dense or chewy, like whole wheat bread can be. Scrumptious!

I made them into balls instead of putting them in muffin tins. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I got tons of compliments at Thanksgiving dinner. So light. Love the hint of sweetness from the sugar, without being a sweet roll. So so so yummy! I’ll be adding this to my regular baking. This was my first recipe that had 3 risings. That was fun! Super easy recipe.

I've made these many times--this is a Southern Living magazine recipe from way back.  The dough is very sticky, and I usually have to use a bit more all purpose flour to make it manageable for the first kneading. I only use a bit more, though. It's important that a dough with this much whole wheat flour be somewhat sticky because it takes time for the whole grain flour to absorb the liquids. Once the first rise is complete, the dough is easier to handle. You will still need to flour the rolling surface, your rolling pin, and your knife well. These rolls look great and they are very light and tasty.

I made these with 1/3 cup of honey instead of sugar and 1 1/2 cups of milk instead of water but otherwise followed the directions. I was surprised by how soft these were! They were not as dense as most whole wheat recipes I've made and were delicious paired with turkey wild rice soup.

I've tried so many wheat roll recipes and they are all dense and tough. These are soft and fluffy like a white flour roll. My search is over. This is now my go to wheat roll recipe.

These are now my go-to rolls.  I made them for the first time for Thanksgiving, and in the 2 months since I've made them another 4 or 5 times.  They're wonderful, and easy, and leftovers freeze really well.  For what it's worth, I only let them rise twice (once in the bowl and once in the muffin tins) and they've always turned out great for me.

I tried this recipe many times in different shape and it turned out so yummy. I made like ball shape and I put in the loaf pan it's soft, what I did and surprised me when I put in the over toaster my bread slices texture so crispy outside and soft inside you can never go wrong with the spread you prefer. I love my slices and I won't stop making this for my families and friends. Thank you so much AllRecipes.

This is my first review on here even though I've been using recipes from here for months.  This one is just too good to not give its due credit.  Easiest dough I've worked with.  And the bread tastes fantastic when done.  (My only changes were to swap out 1/2 cup sugar with 1/4 cup honey and 1 for 1 substitute for the butter to coconut oil -- to just make a smidge healthier.)

This recipe is delicious. I have made these several times. I made them in 2012 when I was in ireland to serve with a corn chowder. I did not put them in the muffin tins (because I was working in an unfamiliar kitchen) and it was one less thing to search for.)   I just shaped them and let them rise on a cookie sheet.  They were a big hit!

The dough is great to work with, lovely and soft.  The finished rolls look very nice.  Unfortunately, the taste wasn't great- not bad, but just...bland.  If I were to make these again I would definitely up the salt.

I don't know what went wrong,but I had to add way more flour, about two cups. Apart from that,the rolls did rise very well and were very good.

These turned out a very nice looking, light, airy roll.  We all liked them.  Pretty easy process.  I just let the bread machine do the kneading and first rise and the rest was a peice of cake, just need the time.  Although I'm not the biggest wheat bread fan I can't hold that against a good roll when I have one.

These were light, fluffy and delicious!  It was a humid day, so I had to add some extra all purpose flour to get the dough the right consistency, but they came out perfectly.

This was the first time I made rolls, and they were delicious!  It wasn't difficult at all, just took a lot of time!  I just made them into balls on a cookie sheet, so they weren't much to look at, but they tasted delicious!  Next time I will start earlier!

Yum!! My kids gobbled them up as they came out of the oven!!  I used robin hood nutri (blend of unbleached flour and wheat bran) and I just made them into little balls (I got 30 out of this recipe) and baked on a cookie sheet. Also I skipped the extra butter brushed on top. DELISH!

Oh my, what can I say to describe the joy I felt when I ate those rolls! DEVINE!!! I only made half the recipe (it's just my husband & I), I used 1.5 packages of yeast and the whole egg. I had to add a little more flour than the recipe called for as my dough was sticky. Other than that I sticked exactly to the recipe and the rolls looked so pretty and tasted even better! Thanks for a great recipe, it's a keeper!

These are good, but mine didn't rise as well as I'd hoped. They still had great flavor and were only a bit heavier than I wanted. I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup, added an extra quarter cup of whole wheat flour and brushed with an eggwash instead of more butter. I also added an extra half teaspoon of salt as per a reviewer recommendation (but I used unsalted butter as well, so I don't think it was enough to affect the yeast). I was wary to use a third packet of yeast because I'm at a high altitude, but I think I'll try that next time (and be sure to use warmer water with more of the sugar in it for proofing the yeast, not to overwork the dough, and to let the dough rise in a warmer room). I'll update at a later date if my results are better the next time around. I don't think my less-than-perfect results were due to the recipe itself.

I substituted margarine for butter and cut the dough into eight 5oz pieces and shaped them into oval shaped buns. I baked them at 350F for 18-20 minutes. They turned out to be the perfect size for sandwiches. I really liked the crumb of this bun, it was light and fluffy!

Excellent recipe for prior non bread makers.  My confidence has risen with the yeast.  Changed only the white sugar as i never own such an item. Natural unrefined sugar in the same proportion worked as well.  Thanks for sharing such an uncomplicated and delicious recipe. We live in Thailand and kitchen is hot and humid but it worked out just the same.  Served with Black Bean Soup. Yum.

I used all wheat flour.  They rose fine, did NOT need extra yeast, nor did it need extra flour as some have recommended.  My issues were that the batch was too big for my bread maker first (my fault), and second the rolls turned out too dry.  I think next time I will add 6 T of butter to mix and only 2 T brushed on top.  Next time I will also skip the muffin tins and form balls on a cookie sheet as others have done.

I followed the recipe to a tee, except that I formed the rolls into the classic dinner roll balls and baked them seven to a cake pan. I stuck a probe thermometer in and took them out when it hit 190 degrees. They came out BEAUTIFULLY! The dough was soft and supple to work with, and the result is a moist, light, slightly sweet tasting dinner roll that tastes great with butter. Just delightful. This one's going in my recipe box.

These are fantastic!  I normally dont like the taste and texture of wheat bread (bitter and tough), but these are neither.  They are soft and fluffy and have a great flavor. I will definitely be making these again.

This is a great recipe. My rolls had beautiful color, taste and texture and where a breeze to make. I did skip spiraling them though and simply shaped them into standard ball shaped rolls. Thanks for sharing this great recipe :)

I LOVE THIS RECIPE. I have tried 5 recipes before this one. THIS ONE IS A KEEPER. The rolls turned out light and airy. I even made a PIZZA CRUST out of this recipe, so my daughter and I can have pizza with the rest of the family this weekend. My daughter and I are eating healthier to try to loose some weight. I even made HAMBURGER BUNS out of this recipe. THIS RECIPE IS AWESOME AND A DEFINITE KEEPER.

I made recipe essentially as written.  I used about 1/8 cup less sugar based on reviews that it was too sweet and whole wheat pastry flour instead of just plain whole wheat flour.  Turned out great.  Rolls were light and fluffy and looked really nice.  I made 1/2 batch as is and the other 1/2 batch I added some garlic and rosemary too.  Both were popular with the family.

I used this recipes to teach my sister how to make bread and it was fantastic! There is a lot of rising time, but well worth the effort. Instead of making rolls we divided it in half and put into two loaf pans. It only needed a couple more minutes in the oven and made a great breakfast bread on Christmas morning.

I used white whole wheat instead of regular whole wheat as I was cooking for a picky crowd and knew the white color would be more appealing to them. These rolls really came out great--very light but not that kind of insubstantial airiness you get from supermarket rolls. I did use 1.5 tsp salt and next time might even up it a little more as I found these just slightly bland. I formed them into cloverleaf rolls instead of the spirals. I baked them until they were cooked but on the lighter side, and froze them. Then I took them out late in the morning I wanted to serve them and popped them in the oven on a baking sheet right before dinner to heat for 5-10 minutes. They were delicious! I'm definitely going to try these again with regular whole wheat.

This recipe is great!  Very light roll.  I brushed butter on the dough before rolling into a spiral...also used rapid rise yeast.  Put a little sugar in the yeast mixture.   Thank you Katrina!  Great Thanksgiving rolls.

These are fantastic. The best roll recipe I've found so far. I just baked them free standing and didn't do the spiral thing. Also, add the sugar to the yeast and water at the start so the yeast has something to eat.

I improvised these rolls a little by making them a little bigger to use as hamburger rolls.  Holy moly!  Were these rolls fantastic!  Will be my go to wheat rolls from now on.  The only thing I changed was the one egg (I was all out!).  I used instead 1/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce.  In the future, I'll probably cut the white sugar in half as it made the rolls a little sweeter than I was looking for.  Otherwise!  GREAT ROLL RECIPE!

This recipe is awesome!  I have made these rolls twice and they were perfect each time.  I did find that I had to add more flour when kneading due to the stickiness but that was easy. I would recommend this recipe.

My new favorite bread recipe!  The first time I baked 1/2 of them as directed in the recipe, the other half I rolled into yummy cinnamon rolls.  They were good but it wasn't exactly what I'd hoped for.  Used the same recipe and rolled the dough into balls and baked as buns and WOW!

The dough for these rolls was very easy to make.  As suggested by another poster, I spread garlic butter on the strips before rolling them.  I found this to be a little fussy, as the rolls weren't all the same size.  I baked them (2 dozen) lined up on a baking sheet.  I froze them and pull them out to pack in my kids lunches, and they love them!  I definitely like the lightness of the rolls so I will make them again, but maybe not swirl them.

I made "sweet dinner rolls" from this site with 100%  whole wheat and I also made these rolls with 100% whole wheat. These were definitely better and my husband requests these. Did the second rise in the bread maker after punching it down in the bread maker itself.

Fantastic!  I  did have to add more flour than what the recipe called for, but it turned out great.  I kept adding whole wheat flour until it was the right consistency.  My family loved them and asked for more.  My husband said they were even better when we reheated the leftovers the next day.  Very time consuming, but worth it!

These rolls were so good! I made them as stated, except I baked them on a cookie sheet instead of muffin cups. I made them for Christmas Eve dinner and everyone loved them. We used the leftover rolls to make ham sandwiches (hot and cold), and they were awesome.

I have never had a roll recipe turn out better. They were light rolls despite the amount of wheat flour in them. I followed the recipe to the "T". Probably could be made into bread loaves, I'm trying that next!  ;)

Easy, good recipe, but don't over flour and don't overbake.  I would definitely make this one again.

Ridiculously delicious! SO soft!    I was actually shocked at how well they came out as I have not baked in some time. I did make some slight adjustments to accommodate health concerns: Replaced 3/4 c. water with lactose-free milk. Replaced 1/4 c. sugar with honey (and a pinch of baking soda). Replaced butter with canola oil in the dough mixture (still used some butter/margarine for brushing the tops though). The liquid substitutions made it necessary to add a little more white flour while kneading to achieve the right consistency. I tried different roll shapes - some bowknot, some cloverleaf - they were all beautiful and received rave reviews. Also, thanks Katrina for the freezing tip. I baked at home for 8 mins and then finished them at grandma's house just in time for Thanksgiving dinner. YUMMY!!

I thought that these rolls were lovely.  They were nice and soft.  I made a half batch as there are only two of us in the family and took the advice on how freezing them after only half cooking them.  I did this and just defrosted them before putting them back in the oven for another 4-5 minutes.  They tasted just as if they were newly baked.  I do wish I put a little more salt in it, maybe 1 1/2 teaspoons next time.  Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing!

These were great.  I used the recipe as is, but made it into a loaf of bread and cinnamon rolls.  Very good.  My anti wheat family gobbled them up.

This it the first time I've ever made wheat bread and, although I have nothing to compare it to, I thought these were great! They were definitely light with a soft crust, the perfect dinner roll. I would even consider making these into wheat cinnamon rolls because they're that soft and yummy. This one it definitely going into the recipe binder!

My family loves these rolls and, though they take a little longer, they are worth it.  Like most other people, I always end up having to add flour to get a stiff enough dough. I just add extra to the board and knead it in as I go.

I was very impressed! I halved the recipe and made this with all whole wheat flour (about a 1/4 cup less than called for) and 2 packages of yeast. Also added a little more sugar, as other reviewers suggested. I was amazed at how wonderfully the dough rose and how easy it was to knead. I tied the dough into knots and they turned out great. The rolls were really light and fluffy - a great texture. They warm up great too.   I think that because I used all whole wheat flour, it was a little bland. I'll have to experiment with ways to make the "all whole wheat" version tastier. :)

awesome.  Easy to make, even with all the rise time.  Light, fluffy, sweet and very tasty.  My three year old could help with these, they were so simple.

Very good - the only changes I made were using bread flour in place of all-purpose and used 2 cups whole wheat flour+1/4 ground flax seeds. I doubt this affected the outcome or the flavor much, if at all. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and after the 2nd rise, punched the dough then divided in 1/2. I then rolled out and spread with melted butter, rolled up jelly roll style, and finally cut into 12 pieces.

These were awesome!  I made a couple of changes to cut a little of the fat out of the buns.  After the second rise I did not roll the dough out and brush with butter.  Instead I made the dough into 24 balls and placed in greased muffin tins.  After the third rise I brushed the tops of the buns with an egg wash made of an egg beaten with a couple of tbsp. of water instead of using butter.  The buns were terrific.  I will definitely make them again with my modifications.

I usually shy away from roll recipes as I think they can be tricky to get the consistency right. This one was easy and they turned out great!  Will be my one and only roll recipe from now on - yummy!

These are the best rolls!  I made them once into spirals and once I just rolled into balls, both very tasty.  However, the spiral ones are much prettier, but take more work, for company for sure.  I also made a huge batch and partially cooked them and separated out for individual dinners and put in the freezer.  Pull out in the morning to let thaw and finish cooking for dinner.  Still taste fabulous!

I substituted canola oil for the butter and honey for the sugar. I made pan rolls by dividing the dough into golfball size balls and placing in a greased 10 x 16 glass casserole dish, letting them rise until doubled. They were light, fluffy, and delicious!

To be honest, I was very surprised this recipe worked out because I haven't found a lot of great roll recipes online. But, WOW! These rolls were incredible! I made only a third of the recipe (next time I think I'll halve it), but used a whole package of yeast.  I also added a bit more salt to strengthen the dough and make for a slow, steady rise. I made the rolls into large knots and they rose beautifully on the last rise. The dough takes a while, but the results are well worth the wait! Thanks for the great recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly but since a lot of reviews said there wasn't enough flavour, I added a bit of garlic powder and basil leaves. I don't think the yeast was enough because the dough didn't rise both times I put it in a warm oven. Personally, I found the recipe too sweet but my husband loved it. It's a good, fun recipe but not one of my favourite bread recipes.

I love this recipe. I think it's easy to make because most of the time spent on it is letting the dough rise. I let my kitchen aid do all the kneading and the rolls turned out great. I think I finally found the roll recipe I've been searching for. I really enjoy the spiraled look. Like, other's said, I have to use a little more flour to make the dough not so sticky.

My family loved these rolls.  They take a while to make, you can't skip shorten the rise time or they won't be as fluffy.  I halved the salt and used 3 1/4 whole wheat to 1 1/4 all purpose and it still was loved by all.

I have made these twice. First, for a themed dinner party and then for Thanksgiving last year. They are so amazing! The title says light, though I don't know if that can be true based on how delicious and buttery they taste! At thanksgiving, due to realizing too late that an aunt had used all the flour without telling anyone and my (then) boyfriend having to spend and hour running to the store to find some, they finished JUST as we finished eating thanksgiving dinner! But even though we were completely stuffed, that didn't stop us from eating half of the batch immediately! Then we kept sneaking back to the kitchen the rest of that day and the next to eat one. So good! My (now) husband gets very worked up if I even mention the possibility of making them.

Yummy!  I loved them and so did my kids.  I love using the wheat flour.  what a great recipe.  I give it a 4 because I like a little less preparation but I think next time i'll just use the drop roll method.

I'm new to bread-making and found this fairly easy to do (if a little time consuming).  I didn't shape them into coils, instead I made regular round dinner rolls.  They tasted OK, nothing spectacular; I will definitely make them again, because they are a good standard dinner roll.

If I could give these rolls six stars, I would have!! Although rather time consuming, they are definitely worth it! My family and I loved this recipe and will be making them again very soon!

These are really delicious, and definitely worth the time to make! Great crunch on the outside, with a soft inside.

Holy cow were these great! I used half water and half milk instead of just water. I also used honey in place of the sugar. Rolled them into balls instead of swirls b/c I was lazy. Didn't brush them with anything. 11 minutes at 375 F in my oven was perfect (mine's a little hot I think). Delicious! Will make again and again.

I liked these rolls very much.  The only change I made was the suggestions by other reviewers to brush with olive oil instead of butter and sprinkle with seasonings.  I used sweet basil, granulated garlic and a little kosher salt. (I may use butter the next time I make them.  Either way is fine.)  These look a little intimidating but they aren't.  They were very easy to make.  I'll use the recipe again to make cinnamon rolls, too, as someone else suggested.  I only gave it four stars because I thought the roll itself could have had a little more flavor.  Otherwise  they are very light.  It's a really good recipe, even for beginners.

I've been wanting to find a healthy recipe for wheat rolls and I think this is it!  The only thing I changed was to use 1/2 cup honey instead of sugar.  This recipe is very versatile it seems, and I can't wait to experiment with it more.  Thank you so much!

Wow!  These are some DELICIOUS rolls!!  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out great!

The only thing I will change in the future is the way these rolls are put together.  I didn't like eating my rolls like cinamon buns and next time will make them into cloverbuns or tied rolls.

Very tasty roll!

I used this recipe for a friend who can't digest white flour, as a hot cross bun recipe. I made a few changes, I used milk instead of water, increase the butter, added spices and increased the sugar, these buns were very light,the compliments I received were many, great recipe, I will be using this from now on as my wheat bread recipe and as hot cross buns for those with white flour allergies.

I love this recipe! The rolls are soft, delicious and have a perfect texture. It has an extra rising time than most breads but it is well worth it. I also use this recipe to make hamburger buns, loaves of bread and coriander rolls (instead of cinnamon rolls). To save time,I don't roll them out like the recipe says, I just form them into the shape I want and put in the pans. Oh, another thing, I only put 1/2 of the sugar.

I used 7-grain flour in place of whole wheat and honey rather than sugar.  This recipe is incredible!  I made a double batch and froze 2 dozen- they heat up so well, and they were gone in a flash.  YUM!

these taste fabulous, but they didn't get very big in the muffin pan, maybe 2" thick at most. That part was disappointing, but the taste made up for it.

I am rating this recipe a 5 since the rolls were really good, even though I did not follow the directions.

I made these with all white flour (thought I had wheat, but was out), followed all the other directions...they were very moist, but also quite dense; I think I kneaded the dough a little too much.  They were even better the next day...I will make these again with wheat flour and update my review.

This was my first "roll" experience.  I've made bread plenty of times, but have been intimidated to try rolls.  I'm glad I did!  These turned out GREAT!  I'm excited to make them again.

I failed miserably with my first trial. I followed the direction exactly to raise the dough, but bread dough started deflating before I was ready to bake them. I don't know why, but it appeared I let it go of it's peak time. Second time, I went by 'how much it raised' instead of 'how many minutes'. First rise time was 40 minutes, second rise time was 20 minutes, and the last one was also 20 minutes (I guess it's depends on the condition such as temperature, yeast, etc...)  It turned out perfectly---very fluffy and moist just like everybody else said :) I took the review tip and used 1/3C honey instead.  It is definitely keeper!!! Thank you very much for the wonderful recipe!

Light and fluffy. Melt in your mouth roll.
These rolls are really delicious, my whole  family enjoyed them. I wasn't really into muffin look, I wanted something smaller and prettier. I rolled out the dough, cut it into triangles and  rolled the into mini crescents.

These rolls ROCK! They were a hit at my dinner party.  I made them exactly as written, but used a BOSCH mixer to do the kneading for me. They were so good, I started making another batch right after dinner today!  I am going to make this batch and freeze them as directed for Thanksgiving dinner.  This way I only have one batch to make on T Day.

This was my first time baking rolls and they turned out perfect. I subsituted olive oil for the butter and used all white flour but the end result was still perfect. I'll use this recipe again and again!  Next time I'll use wheat and add little honey. No more store bought rolls for me! Wheee!! Thanks :)

Yummy! I made these to go with the Ham & Potato soup from this site. My first time making "rolls" and I have to say they turned out beautiful. I made the recipe exactly as stated (except I did add 1 TBS of sugar with the yeast while it dissolved). I didn't however roll them into pinwheels. I just formed into dough balls and baked in "large" muffin tins. Beautiful, tasty, soft & easy.

Great rolls!  Nice and light, these came out perfectly.  The dough was easy to handle also, kneeded well, and my 3 year old helped me make the balls to put into my muffin pans.  We liked these!

The texture of these rolls is fantastic. I found them a touch too sweet and will only use three tablespoons of sugar next time I make them. Thanks for sharing!

I give the rolls 50+ stars,they are so soft and tasty and look so nice that you can serve them at a fancy dinner party. I know they are the only dinner rolls I will make from now on and I have as also made them with all white bread flour and they were more soft by useing bread flour, I add 2 eggs and when I didn't have any butter I used oil and they still tasted so so good and very soft. Thanks so much Terry

These were easy to make and yummy with butter or jam.  They reminded me more of bisquets than rolls because it didn't have a fluffy texture to it.  Overall I did enjoy making these.

These were pretty good. The texture wasn't my absolute favorite and they were kind of plain, but they're great with butter and jam or dipped in soup. This is a nice basic recipe.

These were great and I did use half the dough for cinnamon rolls. I just mixed butter brown sugar and cinnamon till I got a semi thick paste. Next time i will use more filling in the cinnamon rolls though... it seems like a lot, but it really cooks down.

These rolls are easy to prepare and turned out beautifully.  I loved cutting them out and rolling them up.

I baked it whole, did not divide it into individual servings and also did not wait for it to rise third time. But it turned out yummy for me. My husband prefers fluffier bread though.

The flavor of these rolls was excellent.  Next time I'm just going to shape them into balls and bake them on a cookie sheet.  Although shaping them into spiral shapes looked nice, I think the muffin tins prohibited them from rising enough to be really fluffy.  I might also experiment with folding them over and making them into parkerhouse style rolls.

I have never made rolls in my life and these were so easy! They do take a long time, considering all the rising. Not a lot of work, just a lot of waiting - but delicious results! I froze some for the week ahead and they went great with soup. This will be a standard recipe in my repetoire.

I didn't find this too difficult.  The rolls were so yummy, I had to limit access to them for everyone in order to have enough for my original intent-- carrot dog rolls.

This is a great recipe!  The warm, wheaty rolls are lovely to eat.  My muffin pan is very small, so I baked some of the rolls in the muffin pan, some on a cookie sheet, and the rest on a baking stone.  All the rolls turned out beautifully.  My husband loved them!  This recipe went right into my All-Stars Recipe Box.

These were only my second attempt at rolls in 15 years so my family was a bit skeptical. They were declared "just as good as Mom used to make!" Very easy recipe to work with. I will definitely be making these again!

These are the best rolls ever! I have made many recipes, but these always turn out wonderful. Great for a beginner or a pro.
