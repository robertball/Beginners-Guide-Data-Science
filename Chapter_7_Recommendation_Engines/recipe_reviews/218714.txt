This is a good recipe for baking onion rings.  My local farmers' market had lots of types of onions for very little money.  I did a batch of these with three types of onions, and they were wonderful.  Using Vidalia onions was best!  I found that I had to increase the oven temperature to 450 instead of 350 to keep the coating crisp and cook the onion enough, but not so much it becomes mush.  At 350 the batter does stick to the onion better but they are more like 2am diner onion rings than the steakhouse kind you get if you bake in a hotter oven.

Made these for dinner tonight. The family loved them. My only suggestion would be to increase the oven temperature to 425 or 450. Thanks for a good recipe!

Made these because I had a craving for fried onion rings, but had no frying oil. I used Italian bread crumbs and baked at a higher temp as some other reviews requested. They turned out GREAT! My husband didn't believe that I made them from scratch...he thought they were from a frozen package. Will definitely make these again! I made sure to let the batter drip off for a while as to not get the "guminess" that other reviewers turned out with ;)

The batter made the rings so gummy and I'm not sure what would have made that better.  I did bake them for 25 minutes to even get them a little browned but the gumminess just was off putting.  I won't make these again.

this recipe was pretty great. I increased the heat as others suggested and I'm really happy that I did. the onion was perfect and the outer breading crunchy. two things to note- 
A -the outer breading was really thin.. Delicious but very thin. I think next time I will add more flour to the batter and try to get the breading thicker. 
B- Definitely NOT a very good recipe for beginners. its also a bit more time consuming than you'd think. if you're looking for a fast easy onion ring I suggest trying a different recipe.
 But if your willing to get messy, put the time in and have some prior knowledge of how breading works this is a fantastic option.

I think these are just too much work for a so-so outcome. Definitely good for a baked ring as opposed to fried, but just not really worth it to me. The coating was really crispy, almost too crispy ~ making them hard to eat without tearing up your mouth, and I found the flavor lacking overall. The taste of the onions were lost beneath the coating.

I made this for an appy before dinner tonight with my family.  We loved them. Had to bake a bit longer than it said but was so delicious and crunchy.  Paired it with my homemade dip (2 tbsp mayo,  1 tbsp Parmesan, couple squirts of ketchup, 1 crushed garlic clove, dashes of black pepper, paprika, cayenne) and was an awesome combo!  (also instead of italian seasoning in the bread crumbs i did basil, oregano, paprika, cayenne, and pepper).  Thanks for posting such a healthy alternative to fried onion rings!!

Absolutely delicious!  I let batter drip for a good 15-20 min, then rolled in Italian seasoned panko. I then baked at 450 on a cooling rack sprayed with pam over a baking sheet. Super crunchy and would NEVER miss the deep frying. Thank you for a great recipe!

I added a dash of cayenne pepper. Didn't have Pablo so used corn meal. Sprinkled paprika for color. We liked them very much.

I'm a novice cook, so I followed this recipe exact (only I set my oven to 200 C instead of 175 after reading reviews). My husband loved them.  Especially since there are not fried in tons of oil.   Thanks for this simple recipe!  They were yummy!

I used panko, Namaste gluten free flour, and rice milk instead of regular milk. I also baked for 20min at 425 degrees and it was perfectly crispy! My husband and I loved this recipe and will be using it again.

It was ok.  I was hoping for more of a batter flavor.

these were delicious! I use crackers instead of bread crumbs, and I used the deep fryer ... 3 minutes at 350°f, turn half way through.

I used smaller left over yellow onions that needed to be used. I only had regular bread crumbs on hand. Baked them in my nu wave. Given the changes it was pretty good. I plan to do it  as written once I get to the store for panko crumbs. But will still cook in the nu wave, it makes things crispy, very similar to frying. All in all it took about 10 mins to prepare. Not bad.

If you go into this thinking there going to taste exactly like fried version, that's your first mistake.
