This was delicious!  I was hesitant at first with the fresh grated ginger being added, but it really went well with the banana, the cinnamon and nutmeg.  I did use the optional (real) maple syrup and it helped sweeten it and was a great addition to the flavors.

Very tasty.  If you don't like very soft bananas, don't make this.  I can also imagine these bananas over pound cake, made into a pie,  or  over vanilla ice cream....that's if you want to make it not has healthy...
