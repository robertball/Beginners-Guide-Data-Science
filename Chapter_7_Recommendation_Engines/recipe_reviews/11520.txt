Oh, wow.  These are soooo good!  I was having a hard time trying to figure out how much was in a whole jar of Peanut butter, because I only wanted to make 1/2 recipe.  In case you need to know, it's 2 cups, or 1 cup for 1/2 recipe!

YUMMY cookies!!! I followed the recipe exactly, however I used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter. For those of you who buy the extra large jars, the measurement for an 18 ounce jar of peanut butter is "1 7/8" cups (just measure two cups and subtract 2 tablespoons). I just use the entire two cups instead. The recipe is "forgiving" with regards to the quantity of peanut butter...give or take a few tablespoons (in my book, more is better)and they always come out delicious!!! DO NOT OVERBAKE! DO NOT WAIT FOR THE EDGES TO BROWN!! Take them out once they no longer look wet and leave on cookie sheet for at least ten minutes. TY Kevin for the recipe!!!!

I made these using creamy peanut butter and no nuts and they were gone in 2 days! I used a fork dipped in sugar (as suggested by a previous reviewer) to flatten them slightly, and then sprinkled them thoroughly with mini chocolate chips. I baked about 10 minutes on parchment paper so I didn't have to deal with greasy cookie sheets, and they came out perfect-- soft and chewy, just like the ones you pay $1.00 for at the mall. I'm making more today!

I just made these cookies for the first time yesterday and my family and I truely believe that these are thee best Peanut Butter Cookies we have ever eaten in our entire lives. This recipe gave me 37 tasty cookies. The cookies came out nice and thick and if you do udercook them just a little bit they come out moist and fluffy. I will never use another Peanut Butter Cookie recipe again. I also get a kick out of telling everyone (and watching their eyes widen up) that the cookies contain a whole jar of Peanut Butter. I recommend you try this tasty and easy Peanut Butter Cookie recipe.

These cookies were simple to make.  Best peanut butter taste of any I've had, outside of my mother's. And they taste better the longer they sit.  I didn't have an 18 oz jar, so I used a 16 oz jar of crunchy, and I didn't have a 3rd egg for the egg white.  I rolled these into 2 logs, and froze them for 30 - 45 minutes, until firm.  I cut them thick and baked them for 20 mins at 375.

This is quite possibly the best peanut butter cookie recipe ever! I made per the recipe verbatim...except for one inadvertent change, I ran out of flour, and only had about a cup and 3/4...but these still turned out fabulous! I cannot wait to try a batch with chocolate chips! Baked these 12 minutes exact at 350 and the cookies were perfect, crisp on the edges and slighty chewy. And the perfect peanut flavor! I used Peter Pan Whipped peanut butter, it seemed to mix in really easily. try these cookies, you won't be sorry.

I come from a family of peanut butter addicts and these hit the spot.  The cookies were very moiste and had a great peanut butter flavor.  Because I used extra chunky peanut butter I didn't add the nuts.  I must have made mine too small though because I ended up with almost seven dozen and had to decrease the cooking time to about 9-10 minutes.  You definately should undercook them a little so they stay chewy.  I will make again for sure.

These were the best peanut butter cookies I have ever had.  They were so moist and delicous.  I used crunchy peanut butter and omitted the nuts and used margerine instead of butter and they were still great.  If you really want to impress someone, then bake these cookies.  A++++++

We loved these cookies!  I omitted the chopped peanuts (didn't have any on hand) and just used crunchy peanut butter.  Turned out great!  Next time I'll try Laura Scudder's PB as someone suggested.  Great recipe!

Like others, I was looking for an amazing pb cookie recipe and chose this one based on reviews. I must have a different concept of "chewy" than the author, because although I would say they were moist, they certainly weren't chewy. The dough was very crumbly and the finished product was the same. It sort of disintigrated in your mouth - almost reminded me of a super moist shortbread if that makes any sense. Obviously with a whole jar, it had good pb flavor, but the texture was definitely lacking. Forgettable recipe. I continue my search for the ultimate pb cookie. UPDATE: found my favorite - it's the Peanut Butter Chews recipe on the King Arthur Flour site.

Just about the best PB Cookie I've ever had!  I always make it with chunky PB instead of buying an separate package. Works beautifully.  It calls for 2 eggs and an egg yolk. I made it that way one time and the rest of the time without the extra yolk and I cannot tell the difference.  Thanks for posting recipe Kevin.

My husband was super hungry for homemade pb cookies, and I thought I'd give this recipe a shot. Holy cow! He bugs me weekly to make them now! We're both HUGE pb fans, so we nixed the peanuts, and added Reese's Pieces. These are amazing fresh out of the oven, when the cookies are still soft and chewy, and the candy is all gooey and melted. Best pb cookies I've ever had!!!

Blow your peanut butter lovin' friends away.   These are sublime, when properly baked.  You must chill the dough.  You must know your oven.  12 minutes is right for mine.  No chill=flat, overcooked=dryish, undercooked=bendy, done right=gone in 60 seconds.

These were rated a 10 by the family. Usually the first cookies to go in the house are the chocolate chip cookies. This time these were the first to disappear! This recipe will be replacing my other peanut butter cookie recipe. Thanks.

I would've given this 5 stars for the delicious, most yummy peanuty buttery burst of flavor.  No pb cookie has a better, more robust flavor.  Unfortunately, these cookies (most of them) were so very soft I could bend them in half & make a sandwich.  Plus most very flat.  Now I have been baking for years & consider myself an excellent baker.  I so much wanted to love these cookies after reading the reviews, and I do love the flavor, but not the texture.  The texture ruins it for me--to the point of not wanting to make them again.  First I made very small ones(walnut size? Really?? ) and baked 10 min.  That batch was rather dry & the bottom was starting to turn dark brown.  I normally make all my cookies rather large, so next batch tried making larger at 10min.  Those turned flat like pancakes and very soft(bendable).  Medium size, hardly pressed with the fork tines at 10 min. looked about the best.

Melts in your mouth! I only had 3/4 brown sugar so I used 1/4 more white sugar.. I also put in a 1/4 cup of powdered sugar too. I didn't use the chopped nuts because I don't like them. The sugared fork tip was great and gave them the yummy sugared goodness on top. Will only use this recipe from now on! Oh, and I didn't wait to chill the 1st batch because I was DYING for some, and they were just as good as the chilled! YEA!

By far the best PB cookie ever.  I stopped making them because they always came out bad.  Decided to give this recipe a try.  PERFECT!!  Love them.  We do not add the chopped nuts though.

Excellent cookies!  I have been looking for a soft, moist peanut butter cookie recipe for a long time and this recipe has ended my search.  I did substitute butter flavor Crisco instead of the real butter, just because my budget doesn't allow for real butter right now.  I made the mistake of using salted peanuts, which made the cookies taste a little "off".  I think next time I'll skip the peanut chopping step and just use crunchy peanut butter with an additional spoonful of creamy peanut butter to ensure moistness.  I'm sure these will be well-received on my Christmas cookie platters.

Wow - During the holidays, I was on the hunt for a good Peanut Butter Cookie recipe. EUREKA!!!!!  I did make some changes, but basically followed the recipe.  I always use bread flour for my cookies (the same amount) if you like a softer/chewier cookie.  If you are using a stand mixer, I don't let the butter soften too much, about 20 - 30 minutes at room temp.  I skewed the white sugar to brown sugar ratio 1/2 cup white, and 1 1/2 brown, adds chewiness.  Another reviewer said she added peanut butter chips, - WOW.  My nephew couldn't stop eating these, he just kept saying "... it's like heaven in my mouth!"  That's all assurance that this recipe is a keeper!

This is the best peanut butter cookie recipe I have ever tried! Very moist and chewy. I used Honey Roasted Peanuts, and I added a bag of Peanut Butter Chips. Make sure not to overbake these cookies. Amazing!

Really good PB cookie recipe....not too overwhelming with PB flavor and maintains a good texture days after baked.  I didn't add the peanuts...I don't like a "nutty" PB cookie....I like the smooth PB taste.

Ok, so there are a lot of mixed reviews about this recipe.  I think the reason why it gets so many mixed reviews is because people like different types of cookies.  Here is my description.  This recipe yields very rich, very peanut buttery cookies that are more "fall apart" than chewy.  They will come out soft if you cook them a little underdone.  If you cook them too long, they will be crunchy and buttery like a shortbread type cookie.  If you are looking for chewy cookies like you find at the mall or grocery store, use Mrs. Siggs recipe from this site with a little more peanut butter.

Awesome.  I substituted one cup of wheat flour for one of the cups of all-purpose and I didn't notice a difference in taste or consistency at all.  Nice and chewy.  I only baked them 10 minutes.

AMAZING peanut butter cookies! The secret really is not to overbake these. A few tips I've found to be helpful: Don't be shy about taking them out early because they harden up as they cool.  To save money, use chunky peanut butter instead of buying chopped peanuts.  Microwave leftover cookies for 30 seconds to replicate the soft/just baked taste and consistency!  You can also include a slice of sandwich bread in the bag with the cookies to keep them soft!

Very good cookies. Came out moist and delicious! We did not use peanuts but followed everything else exactly.  This made 48 cookies for us, around 2-3 inch diameter.

These are yummy and easy to make, I added an additional spoonful of crunchy peanut butter and chocolate chips.  I'm freezing the dough into balls so my husband and I can have them when we need a sweet fix!  Will keep in my recipe box for future...be careful they are rich!

I chose this recipe because I had a jar of natural peanut butter that I needed to use up or dispose of (the texture is NOT the same as regular peanut butter). And I'm so glad that I did!  I omitted the egg yolk and peanuts in the batch that I made and they still turned out awesome. Also, I followed the advice of another reviewer by microwaving the jar of peanut butter for about 30 seconds in order to soften it before adding to the batter.   All of my cookies are soft and have a great  chewy texture. Using the entire jar of peanut butter ensures cookies full of PB flavor. All in all,  Kevin gets an A+ for this recipe IMO.

THESE. ARE. AMAZING. Easily the best pb cookies I've ever had. The only change that I made was that instead of adding peanuts, I used crunchy peanut butter.

.... these tasted *ok* but the texture was just off.  It was quite crumbly.  I have no idea how the rating got so high and I don't often give sub-par reviews, but I had high expectations due to the reviews.  I'll keep looking for that perfect peanut butter cookie....

Now I know why this recipe got five stars! I followed the recipe exact, using Jif peanut butter. I was a little worried that the cookies might spread, considering how fluffy the dough seemed, even after chilling it for half a day. No reason to worry. These came out perfect. And the taste is better than any
other peanut butter cookie I've ever had. My husband will be pleased. I'm thinking of making sandwich cookies out of these with homemade chocolate frosting. (This recipe makes a ton of cookies, so be sure you really like peanut butter cookies!) NOTE FOR MYSELF: For me, this recipe does not halve well.

These cookies are so good!  I've made them twice already.  The first time I made them following the recipe exactly and I found that there were too many nuts for our liking. Also, I found that they turned out better for me when I didn't grease my non-stick cookie sheet at all. So the next time I used half chunky p.b. and half creamy p.b. and added no extra nuts, and I added 1 cup of peanut butter chips. They are fabulous!  I will never use another peanut butter cookie recipe again.  Very addictive!

There  are not words to describe the taste, texture and addictiveness of these marvelous little morsels of delight! Truly the best peanut butter cookies ever! Really good with chocolate chips too but do very well on their own just as the recipe is written. I will try crunchy peanut butter next time just for variety. These will become an all time favourite very quickly.

These are good cookies, and my kids are gobbling them up, but the texture was a little bit off for me.  I used natural peanut butter, and really creamed the butter/peanut butter/sugar, so maybe I over-creamed it.  I didn't see any reviews that used natural peanut butter (didn't look extensively), but I will add that natural peanut butter isn't the best option for these.

OK, these are certainly as good as the reviews state. I used a bit less sugar because I always do and I did have trouble that they wanted to stick to my fork while flattening them, so I dipped my fork into powdered sugar and it worked great, leaving no trace on the cookie after baking.
We can't stop eating them, they are so addictive. Be sure not to overbake!  If they were dry for you.....you very possibly over baked them! I took mine out of the oven b4 I thought they were done and left them on the cookie sheet for a few min. They were perfect!! I will make these over and over!

I LOVE THIS COOKIE.  Easy to make, a full-flavored cookie you're proud to serve.  I add honey-roasted peanuts and that's puts this cookie "over the top" for everyone who has one.  Friends ask me to make this cookie for a variety of from fun-to-fancy occasions.  Freezes really well. I always use a dough scoop (a small ice cream scoop) to get uniform cookies.    Yummy, yummy, yummy cookie!

I love these. They are a peanut butter lover's dream. When I make them I skip adding the nuts and use 2 cups of peanut butter instead of the whole jar. It makes for a sweeter cookie and a crowd-pleaser for everyone, even the ones who don't love peanut butter.

I used super chunky peanut butter and omitted the chopped peanuts.  I got over 5 dozen of the most delicious peanut butter cookies.  DH says this is the only recipe for peanut butter cookies from now on.  Thanks, Kevin!

Best peanut butter cookied recipe I have ever used.  Super Yummy!!  I did use 1/2 butter & 1/2 Butter Flavored Crisco (because that is what I had).  For part of the batch I put a heaping T. of p'nut butter dough into cupcake liners and baked for about 10-12 min. & then pushed one Reeses P'nut Butter Cup (the mini ones) into each warm cookie---p'nut butter & chocolate lovers dream!!

Thanks Kevin! These were terrific.  I used creamy peanut butter (the kind with oil and corn syrup and all that bad-for-you stuff) and omitted the nuts but added 1/2 bag semi-sweet chocolate chips to half the batter.  Baked for 10 mins and they were soft but sufficiently cooked.

My fiance loves peanut butter cookies and I wanted to impress him and make him the Ultimate Peanut Butter cookie and this recpe was it.  Alot of recipes only call for 1/2 - 1 cup of peanut butter but if you truly love peanut butter that is just not enough.  This recipe now holds a very high pace of honor in my recipe box.

Great recipe.  I made a couple of changes.  I doubled the salt and instead of butter I used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup applesauce.  I also didn't add any nuts.  They tasted great and plenty moist.

Very good and not a overwhelming peanut butter taste like you get sometimes from other peanut-butter cookies. Keeper for sure! Loved that it asked to be refrigerated actually. Made the batter in the morning then in the afternoon when we were having our Christmas platter baking party just whipped it out. Perfect!

I really enjoyed this recipe. They are very delicious cookies. I used crunchy peanut butter and it gave the cookie a nice texture. I don't think I would have liked these as much with creamy peanut butter. I also added some minature choc chips which were unnecessary and just added to the calories. But the kids aren't watching their thighs! :-) Enjoy this recipe!

Fantastic! This is definitely my new go to recipe for peanut butter cookies! I did make a few minor adjustments though. First, I used crunchy peanut butter instead of smooth.  Then, I added - reese peanut butter chips and chocolate chips. I baked the cookies for 11 minutes and let them cool on the baking sheet.  The only change I may make in the future is a touch more vanilla.  These are my new fav!  You have to try them.

This is very similar to the recipe we've used for many years for PB cookies. BUT - you really do not need the entire jar of PB to make them good - half the jar is just as good! :  ) Any recipe that balances 1/1/1/1 the brown sugar, white sugar, butter/margarine and PB will be good to eat. Cute name for the recipe though. You can dip the fork in flour for a richer taste, and in sugar if you prefer a slight crunch. Either way - yum!

I'm not much for peanut butter cookies. My hubby is the one who likes them. He says this is a great recipe. Not too sweet, just right texture,and very peanut buttery! Thanks Kevin!

I made these tonight & D said they are the best ever.  I used canola oil and egg substitute (1/2 cup=2 eggs).  They were quite crumbly, as peanut butter cookies sometimes are, but very tasty.  Lately I've been using an ice cream scoop to scoop up cookie dough, so it doesn't take me so long to get them baked,  These turned out very good, crispy around edges, soft in the middle, but not doughy.  Great!...NOTE: After they had time to cool of a bit, they weren't so crumbly. They got rave reviews from my peanut-butter-cookie-loving brother and from D.

Very good!  A little tricky to get just right.  Don't be concerned if they look not done when they come out of the oven.  They will firm up on the pan while cooling and more when they finish cooling on the wire rack.  They are still very soft cookies.  Follow the author's advice that they should look just barely dry on the top when done -- if golden on the edges they will be overdone.  I used macadamia nuts instead of chopped peanuts but couldn't really taste them for the peanut butter dominates.  The 1/2 tsp. salt isn't necessary as there is plenty of salt in the peanut butter and the nuts.  Fine cookies for any peanut butter freak!  I give a 4 just because they are a bit tricky in the baking process.

These cookies are unbelievably good!  I used a jar of creamy peanut butter (JIF) and left out the additional nuts.  I found baking them for 11 minutes, then giving them 2 minutes on the cookie sheet before removing them to a cooling rack made them come out soft and delicious.  I also only refrigerated for 1 hour, then I rolled them into balls, rolled the balls in granulated sugar, THEN flattened with the fork.  Perfect.  For added sinfulness, I dipped each one halfway into some melted chocolate almond bark.  I have received SO many compliments and requests for the recipe.  It's a keeper!

These are THE best PB cookie I have ever made!  I took these to work, and all 8 truck drivers made these disappear...the men were stuffing their pockets.  One driver put his stash of cookies on the dash of his truck so the cookies would warm and taste fresh from the oven!  The only change I make is that once in a while I add a cup of honey.  Usually, though, this recipe is spot-on perfect as is.:)

I guess these just weren't for me or my family. I left out the peanuts, and they were good but just too cake-like. My mom makes her pb cookies with just peanut butter, sugar, and eggs, and they are much more peanut-buttery and easy!
But it is a good cookie, especially if you add chocolate chips!

I rarely find a 5 star recipe that I believe to be a true 5 star, but this one definitely deserves it!  These cookies turned out to be amazing!  After my husband bought a delicious looking peanut butter cookie today for $2.00 and found it to be really dry with no flavor, I decided to come home try to make some myself.  He was completely impressed by these!  He told me to go back where he bought it and give them one of mine to try. (of course i would never do that, but at least he got a yummy cookie after all!) Don't hesitate to try this recipe!

Another Kevin Ryan winner (understatement)!  Really wonderful p-nutty, chewy/crispy textured cookies.  My only deviation was the size of the cookie.  On a whim, I ended up preparing "monster" cookies!  I formed 3.5 ounce balls of dough, which yieled approximately 16 cookies for the full recipe!  I flattened them a bit, as the recipe suggested, and in 15 minutes, they were done to perfection.
Thank you Kevin----keep 'em coming.

I always make the recipe on the back of the peanut butter jar and love them, but thought I would try something new.  My husband liked these better than the recipe on the jar.  I thought they were good.  They have a very peanut buttery taste.  I like that they were very moist and chewy.  I cooked them on parchment paper for 10 minutes and let them sit on the pan for 2 minutes outside of the oven to continue cooking.  I took them to a party and everyone loved them.  I am going to keep experimenting with different recipes to see if I can find a cookie that I absolutely love.

Very good peanut butter flavor and texture.  14 minutes on a Silpat was perfect.  I let them cool and set just a few seconds before trying to put them on the rack.  I used all creamy and no nuts.  Don't crowd them on the cookie sheet - they do spread a little.  Dip your fork in a little flour or sugar before you make the cross-hash marks.

I don't usually take the time to comment on a recipe, but after MANY attempts at other peanute butter cookie recipes with no flavor or texture I almost gave up on making the premo peanut butter cookie.  After making these, I'll never go looking for another peanut butter cookie recipe - this is a definite keeper.

The cookies came out great!  Even for being at high altitudes.  I may have to tweak it a bit so they come out prettier, but they stood up to the test run which is a good sign for future trials

**WARNING** This cookie MUST be accompanied by a large glass of milk!!  Very good cookie!  I'm not a huge fan of peanut butter cookies but these turned out delicious.  I followed the recipe ingredients with no substitutions.  I did however sprinkle sugar on each ball prior to pressing.  I also refridgerated for 3 hours.  I found a 13 and a half minute bake to be perfect.  Thanks for sharing!

These. Are. Amazing.  Just completely delicious.  They were gone so fast it was unreal.  Absolutely perfect.  Soft, chewy & they held together.

I made minor changes. I only had 2 large eggs, I used bread flour and left out the peanuts.

I don't care for PB cookies but I loved these! I increased the flour by a full cup and rolled in sugar prior to placing on the cookie sheet. Then cooked for half the time, opened the oven and placed my fork marks on the cookies.

I've looked far and wide for the perfect PB cookie recipe. I wanted a moist, chewy, dense flavorful cookie. I was excited when I  Saw this one had a full 18 oz PB and thought, how could it not be flavorful?!?  It went together beautifully and looked so good baking, I was already formulating my 5-star review in my head.  I was quite surprised when I bit into the first one to find it quite bland tasting. DH said he liked them so maybe my taste buds are off tonight, I dunno.  Thanks anyway.

I didn't read all of the reviews, but I knew this recipe had to be good if it called for a whole jar of Peanut Butter. :)
And I was right, they are wonderful!!!!! I followed the recipe and was very careful not to over-cook.  Enjoy everyone,yummy yummy in my tummy. :)

This is a really great Peanut Butter recipe. Couple of alterations on my part; I warmed whole jar of PB in the microwave for 30 seconds. Made adding it to mix easier/creamier. I added walnuts instead of peanuts; and a half a bag of chocolate chips. Yummy! Also, I didn't refrigerate it - just dropped by heaping tablespoon onto a cookie sheet. They are awesome!

This is an awesome cookie!  For those who are looking for a chewy peanut butter cookie, this is not for you.  This is a melt in your mouth, crumbly cookie.  Absolutely amazing!  I did take them out when they were not quite completely set (but not wet looking either), and the first bite sent me straight to heaven!  Absolutely lovely texture and flavor!  I used crunchy peanut butter, so I omitted the peanuts all together, still got a good crunch.  Thanks for posting Kevin!

This is a wonderful recipe. I followed the instructions to the letter including adding the chopped peanuts (rather than using chunky like others suggested). Jackie is correct when she recommends that you NOT overbake these cookies. I accidentally left a sheet in the oven a little longer and they were pretty dry.

These are some of if not THE best peanut butter cookies I have eaten! I used the "extra crunchy" type instead of adding chopped peanuts. They come out perfect! Thank you for sharing!

Great cookies, soft or crunchy. I added peanutbutter chips - I would recommend the entire bag, we only used half a bag the first time, not enough.  We also used crunchy PB but this time we are trying creamy & will not add the nuts as my daughter does not care for the 'crunchies' - This will be a family standard in our house!  Thanks.

I've been using this recipe for as long as I've been making cookies and they are fantastic. I do change things up a little bit- I don't use peanuts, I use chocolate chunks, M&M's or chocolate chips. They are really great with that added bit of sweetness!

These are the moistest, peanut butteriest, most fool-prooftist peanut butter cookies I've ever made!!  WAY better than the Jiff recipe on the back of the jar!  I do use Jiff peanut butter and have not had any trouble with greasy cookies.  I roll them into a ball, roll in sugar and DO NOT flatten them....I think they spread just the right amount and stay moist-er that way.

Probably the best peanut butter cookies I've ever had.  Didn't change a thing.  I agree that they are best when slightly underdone.

Wow!  How anyone managed to cram an entire jar of PB and an entire cup of butter into a cookie recipe and NOT have it turn out all greasy is beyond me!!  These cookies turn out so soft, and tender. Not flakey, not chewy, but just very tender.  Delicious!  This is by far the BEST pb cookie I have EVER had!  It beats all the cookie store, and mall joints.  This is a keeper.

A perfect cookie every time if you keep a few things in mind. The brand of peanut butter really matters. Jif or Skippy give the best taste, texture and appearance. The dough wants to be a little bit chilled. You don't have to leave it in overnight, but a few hours in the fridge really improves the appearance of the cookie. Also, keep a close eye on the baking time until you are comfortable with the time these take in your oven. If you overbake these, they go down to 3 stars or less.

These cookies are KILLER!!!  I use this as a base for the cookies with the chocolate kiss in the center.  I use super chunky peanut butter and omit the chopped peeanuts.  I use parchment paper and carefully calibrate the oven and ONLY BAKE 9 minutes...they will look kind of raw.  They must be puffed up.  As soon as I take them outof the oven I place a Hershey kiss in the center.  Current favorite types are peanut butter; chocolate truffle; special dark chocolate.  I especially like the first two because they have a very soft "bite", so the entire experience of eating this cookie is smooth.  
I use a small cookie scoop which yields me about 80 cookies per batch.  
I always let them cool quite a bit on the cookie sheet before trnsfering them to a rack. (That is because sinice they are underbaked, they are too fragile to be moved within a few minutes of initial cooling.  Enjoy the calories!

These are the best peanut butter cookies I've ever made! They do thin out a bit...I would love to have them a little thicker, but they have such a delicious taste...crispy edges and a soft middle that it makes up for the thinness.  I used crunchy pb and 1 stick of lite margarine and 1 stick of lite butter.  I found 11 minutes to be PERFECT. Also, I dipped my fork in sugar before pressing each cookie to keep the dough from sticking to the fork...oh, and speaking of dough. YUM!  Try freezing a few pieces and putting it into a bowl of softened vanilla ice cream. Wonderful!!

My husband loves peanut butter almost as much as he loves Snickers candy bars - so I thought I would take the best of both of his world's and combine them. I used a whole jar of crunchy peanut butter so I omitted the cup of chopped peanuts. I added to the batter chopped up pieces of Snickers candy bar. I used the minis so they were easier to cut up. The addition of the candy pieces added just the kick my husband loved! 
I could make these cookies every day because they're gone in no time.

Follow the instructions for chilling the dough and use the 12 minute baking time if you want a delicate peanut butter cookie that is crispy around the edges and chewy in the middle. I opted for a jar of super chunky peanut butter and no additional nuts and the cookies are very nutty. Dip your fork in granulated sugar as you press the cookies down to avoid it sticking to the dough. I rated them a 4 out of 5 because they are just a tad too peanut buttery for me. I think I prefer the traditional, slightly more sturdy and crisp version I grew up with. These seem to get softer with storage time.

These are the best peanut butter cookies I have ever had!  I am so pleased with how they turned out and am really glad that I found a recipe that calls for a whole jar of peanut butter.  Most other recipes call for only one cup of pb which just does not give enough flavor. Thanks very much!

Very good cookies. I flattened the balls of dough slightly, with a meat mallet dipped in sugar (the pointy side), to get a criss-cross effect.

I also added some milk chocolate chips to some of the dough.

My husband requests these cookies often.

These cookies are YUM-MY! I got lucky! I really wanted to emulate Otis Spunkmeyer-type really rich, creamy, and peanut buttery cookies, and this recipe did the trick. I agree about the undercooking. In my oven I baked at just over 300 degrees and took them out after about 9-10 minutes. Thanks for the treat!!

Just made these for my FIL for Fathers Day.  They're pretty darn tasty!  I could only find 16oz, no 18 oz, jar of peanut butter.  I decided to leave out the extra egg yolk and was just a little skimpy measuring the dry ingredients.  No problems.  I roll the dough balls in sugar and then flatten slightly with my potato masher which leaves an attractive imprint.  Have also used my meat tenderizer hammer to flatten the dough which leaves a waffle type pattern.  Just to be different....

DELICIOUS!! I made this with no changes to the original recipe. Baked on parchment lined pans for 12 minutes, let cool on the pans 4 minutes, then to the cooling racks. This made exactly 6 dozen fairly large cookies. They are soooooo good! Thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for a peanut butter cookie to sell in my cafe, and I found this recipe. It is the best I have ever tried! The customers love them! I sell out almost as soon as I display them, and always have orders for more. The only change I made, was to use crunchy peanut butter plus the 1 cup of chopped peanuts.

This is the best PB cookie recipe out there.  The secret to really good ones though is the addition of cinnamon!  I know, sounds weird but you don't know it is there and it adds so much, everyone loves them.  I doubled this recipe and added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  The only other change I did was using a 1/4 of the fat being shortening, 1/4 margarine and 1/2 of it butter.  We like a softer cookie which the shortening creates.

These peanut butter cookies were absolutely AMAZING!! They smelled great and looked great too. The recipe was very easy to make and it tasted delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and they were very good. They were soft, moist, creamy, and it tasted and felt like you were just eating a spoon of peanut butter. They were VERY creamy. These were the best peanut butter cookies I have ever made and I am serious!!!! This is the perfect recipe. If you have a bigger jar of peanut butter, use 2 1/4 cup of peanut butter! :)

These were good, but not the most exceptional cookie I've ever had. I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying this recipe since I'm apparently in the minority for finding them average, but personally, I'll try another recipe next time around when I'm in the mood for a good peanut butter cookie.

This is simply a very fine peanut butter cookie. I followed the recipe exactly and had no issues I've noted in other reviews. Also, I live at 6300 feet and baked mine exactly 10 minutes. Perfection. My only issue, and I don't consider it a negative at all, is that I must have grown up in midget walnut territory. I rolled my balls 1 1/2 inches, did the little fork dance on them and ended up with 80 3" cookies. lol I used an air bake cookie sheet too. Regardless, I was incredibly impressed with the flavor, texture and for me, quantity. PB cookies are my husbands favorites, even though he doesn't have much of a sweet tooth. I won't have to bake cookies for at least two months now. lol (Not really true since I had two warm from the oven, three more after supper and a handful for breakfast. Robert's going to ask me where the cookies are in two weeks and I'm going to have to have some story ready. Any suggestions, please advise. These are the best, try them. Oh, I did make one small modification. I make my own vanilla sugar for baking and I used that for the white sugar. DELISH!

Good balance of peanut butter flavor with cookie sweetness.  I just used chunky peanut butter instead of creamy and adding peanuts. My husband (the peanut butter fanatic) loved it!

The flavor was great. However, the cookies were brittle and crumbled easily. They were not moist at all. If this happens to you, then these cookies are great with hot chocolate.

This is by far THE BEST Peanut Butter Cookie I have ever tasted!!  I sometimes will use the extra crunchy peanut butter for a little texture but it is not needed.  This cookie is perfect as is!!!

I made these last year and they were great! I am making them again this year.  We left out the chopped peanuts tho since some of our family members don't like the chunky peanut butter or chunky cookies (I wanted to try them with the chopped nuts myself tho.)  These are the best peanut butter cookies I have made, the whole family agreed!

These cookies was wonderful, I did omit the peanuts and used peanut butter chips instead because i did not have any peanuts on hand.  Going to be making these again!

Love, love, love this recipe. It is so easy to make and a hit with all my friends, family, and co-workers. I add a little bit more peanut butter to make them chewier and use chunky peanut butter in place of adding the peanuts.

I made these, minus the peanuts, with my daughter.  We let the dough sit overnight in the fridge and rolled them in about 3/4 inch diameter balls, then pressed down slightly with a fork in a criss cross pattern.  We got 9 dozen cookies out if the recipe, when making them this size and the whole family loves them!  This is my new go to recipe.

These cookies have a great texture!  I was out of vanilla so I didn't put it in, and they still came out great!  When I make them the next time I will put the vanilla in and I anticipate that they will be the best p.b. cookies I've ever tasted!

These are fantastic! My ten year old son made these by himself for a cookie contest. We were eating them up just as soon as they came out of the oven.  *replaced peanuts with semi-sweet chocolate, tasted like a reeses.

These cookies were great, and made a huge batch.  My teenaged sons were eating them as fast as I could get them out of the oven.  Several days later, my son's friend was eating the few remaining left overs, and declaring they were the best cookies he'd ever had.  Will definately be my new "go to" recipe for peanut butter cookies.

I added a *little* bit extra flour, but it probably wasn't necessary. I did have to refrigerate the dough to get it to the right consistency for rolling, and I think that probably made more of  a difference than the extra flour. Great recipe - we are making it again! Very soft. Thanks.

I am not a huge peanut butter fan and with that being said, these are the best PB cookies EVER! I omitted the extra peanuts simply because I didn't have any, and I only had creamy peanut butter, but even so, these are the most flavorful cookies with the perfect soft center and crispy edge!

The BEST peanut butter cookies I have ever made. Baked for only 12 minutes and they stayed nice and chewy. Added chocolate chips to some and they were great too. I actually doubled the recipe and rolled up three long logs in wax paper, then put the logs in plastic bags, and froze them so we could bake the cookies fresh when we're in the mood. I'm sure they won't last long though.

Yum yum yum yum!!!  So good.  Very creamy.  Great peanut butter cookie!  I didn't have time to refrigerate for 2 hours, so after I measured the dough onto the cookie sheet, I just set them in the freezer for 10 min before baking.  Seems to have worked!  I'm snacking on a delicious cookie as I write this review!

This is the peanut butter cookie recipe for us from now on. It make a dense, chewy, almost peanut butter fudgey cookie that is divine. The only changes I made were for convenience sake: I used a jar of crunchy, all natural peanut butter - the kind you mix yourself, and omitted adding the chopped peanuts, and I always bake on parchment, so I omitted greasing the cookie sheets. The dough keeps well in the fridge for days - haven't tried freezing it yet but I will. I now double the recipe because they go so quickly. Definitely chill for a minimum of two hours. I try to chill the dough overnight for greatest ease in handling. It's hard to keep everyone's hands out of the batter bowl, though!

excellent cookie! I omitted the egg yolk, my dough was fine without it, used natural peanut butter and omitted chopped peanuts. I flatten with a glass dipped in sugar, used 1 tbsp scoop, made 84 cookies, 11 minutes was perfect in  my oven.

By far some of the best peanut butter cookies I have ever made. My co-workers loved them and I may have had a tad to many for breakfast. I added a little cinnamon for a fall affect..it went well!

Lots of peanut butter flavor, but very dry. Not the moist, chewy cookie I was looking for.

These were yummy, and I look forward to making them with enough flour next time (I replaced half with ground oats because I ran out, and the cookies still came out delicious!).

These are okay, but they are certainly not worth the hassle. Much like the other users, the peanut butter cookies were sticking to the fork, and they were becoming a gooey mess. I also dipped the fork in sugar to create the lines. I would suggest using a melon baller or a cookie scoop to roll the dough, or else it will separate and turn in to goo all over your hands. After all of the trouble, I was hoping for the greatest peanut butter cookies ever, but I was disappointed. They taste like every other peanut butter cookie.

Good cookies, be sure to leave them just undercooked when you pull them out of the oven or they will be a little too crumbly.

These tasted really good...but for some reason mine flattened WAY out...the fork marks disappeared and they were just really thin. The taste was phenomenal...the consistency not so much. I followed the recipe exactly, so i'm not sure what happened.

These are Fantastic... I did cook them for only 9 Min. and I am glad I did this was just the right amount of time.  I did make some plain and made a couple batches with chopped up reeses beanut putter cups and carmel - and Oh my goodness... were those good too This recipe is a keeper for sure

Very nice.  Easy, and soft and chewy cookies--my favorite kind.  I have a Costco sized jar of peanut butter, so I used my scale to weigh out 18 oz.  I put in a tad bit more, but I figured it didn't matter.  If I had chunky pb open, I'd have used that instead of adding peanuts, but since what I had was smooth, I did add the peanuts.  I like the crunch they make and I like how it looks with the cookies.  The dough is pretty sticky so I, too, dipped a fork in sugar to get the hatchmarks--on a few, if I didn't, they stuck to the fork.  Thanks for the recipe!

The second time I made these, I had access to melted chocolate, so when they firmed up a bit, I dipped them in it, covering about 2/3 'rds of the cookie, let them sit on a wax papered baking sheet in the ‘fridge for a few minutes until set.  OMG, were they good & GONE fast!  The third time I made them, my nephew dunked his (plain cookies) in jelly and had all his cousins doing the same within minutes, so we put out a "dip bowl" of whipped-up grape jelly (jelly whipped w/ a teaspoon of water to make it “dippable”) and arranged the cookies on a plate around that. Cool twist, delicious & also- GONE fast!  The adults loved it too, surprising to me. Summery: Excellent base PB cookie recipe that stands great alone without one other thing done to it.  But I thought I'd share what we did and/or happened with ours, anyway. (I perfer the original recipe, plain, with coffee or milk to dunk them in, personally). Thank you, Kevin!  PS- I agree with the other reviewers: DO NOT OVER BAKE!

Absolutely the best pnt. butter cookie.  We only used creamy pnt. butter, along w/ 1/2 c. of shortening and 1/2 c. of butter.  (Only b/c I wanted to save on butter, and this is what I usually use in cookies).  We also rolled the dough IN the parchment paper due to it being sooo sticky, and then froze it for 30 min. I then rolled them into 1" diameter (approx.), dipped the top w/ sugar, and then pressed won w/ a fork.  Perfect!

The peanut butter cookies I grew up with (and my mom still makes)are crispy, so the soft, creamy texture of this cookie was a change for me.  My mom's cookie probably beats this one out on taste (although this recipe is really tasty itself), but I personally prefer the soft texture of this one.  I would definitely make these again.  I doubled the recipe and got 9 dozen medium-sized cookies. Be careful not to overbake - that's key to the soft texture. I baked for 10 minutes and they were perfect.

These were very good.  I halved the recipe, and my "walnut sized" balls must have been on the small side, as the halved recipe made about 40 cookies.  If you make smaller cookies (for example, 12 per cookie sheet), reduce the baking time to 8 minutes.  When I cooked the first (dark) sheet for 12 minutes, the cookies were very overcooked and the bottoms burned.  8 minutes worked just perfectly in my oven.

These were great cookies as soon as they came out of the oven and cooled... but it seemed that a couple hours later they were almost stale! Definitely don't let them cook until they are brown. I got about 28 cookies from 1/2 a batch, and my cooking time was about 9 minutes, just until they stopped glistening. Leaving them this way kept them from getting stale so quickly.

Wow!  Phenomenal cookies - delicious peanut butter flavor.  Definitely a keeper.  Its much easier to make these cookies if the dough is chilled.  I kept mine in the refridge between preparing each cookie sheet.

Very good! I used these to make peanut butter blossoms.  I like bite sized cookies so I made them smaller and reduced the cooking time to 9 minutes, removed from oven, added the kiss and cooled them on the cookie sheet for 2 minutes.  They were perfect! Would definitely make again!

Wow! Cookie madness. This recipe makes tons of cookies. Having only 1 cookie sheet it took quite a while to make and bake them all. These don't spread too much so with the fork tine marks and taking care to shape them nicely they look almost professional. A really flavourful peanut butter cookie.

Peanut butter cookies are usually dry and kind of blah. These are NOT dry, and they are anything but blah! Even my boyfriend who hates desserts loved these. I would say they're probably the best peanut butter cookies I've ever had. I halved the recipe but used a whole cup or so of crunchy peanut butter and it was great. Give them a try!

This was delicious- I followed the recipe, (but used crunchy peanut butter in addition to the added peanuts) and it was great--took them to work and everyone loved them.  A little crumbly, but still nice and soft.  On a few of them, I sprinkled some mini chocolate chips before baking (I love chocolate but my husband doesn't) and they were great!

These cookies will go fast!  I used a 16oz jar of Smuckers Natural peanut butter, increased the flour by 1/2 cup and omitted the extra egg yolk.  They are fantastic!  Better yet - add a Hershey's Kiss right when you take them out of the oven for a real treat!

I was searching for an exceptional PB cookie for a special treat for the kids and gave these a try based on the reviews. Unfortunately, these didn't work out for us. Followed the recipe precisely, but the cooking time seemed to be way too long, so we only left them in the oven for about 9 minutes (by appearance/texture). Even so, they were still really dry/crumbly (not the moist/chewy PB cookie we're used to), *VERY VERY* greasy (definitely not a cookie to just walk around with without a napkin! lol) and not very "peanut-buttery" at all. We tried another batch after chilling in the fridge overnight, but ended up with the same result. We'll go back to our "regular" tried and true from now on. Thanks for the recipe, though...always nice to try something new!

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  I had 30 people coming through my parents' house over the weekend of my father's 90th birthday.  I doubled the batch, using chunky peanut butter, & these were gone in no time.

PB cookies are my father's favorite & he loved them!

If you happen to like the Nutter Butter Peanutbutter cookies....Then you will LOVE the cookies this recipe creates. Easy recipe and devoured by all.  No crumbs left behind in this cookie jar. (I used Skippy extra crunchy peanutbutter and left out the added peanuts.)

Very rich, great flavor.  Undercook them, definitely, by a few minutes.  They came out moist and chewy with a wonderful peanut-butter flavor.  This is my new PB cookie recipe.

These were mediocre, nothing special about them. I thought with that much peanut butter, who could go wrong?  I decreased cooking time til I found what worked best which was around 8 1/2 to 9 minutes.  Thank you for letting me try these, I think I'll venture on to the Jif recipe next.

These are BY FAR the best tasting baked product that I've made this year.  They were easy to make and they tasted great.  I used parchment paper to bake them on, making things even cleaner and easier.  Highly recommend!

This was good. It's not quite what I was looking for, but it was good.  I thought this recipe was better than the Mrs Sigg's peanut butter cookie recipe.  It is CRUCIAL not to overcook these or you will have a dry, crumbly cookie.  8 minutes on my oven was more than enough time.  As others have  mentioned, take them out when they don't look wet anymore.

Great recipe! I tweaked it a bit by reducing the butter/margarine by 1/4, deleted the peanuts (thanks to the extra crunchy peanut butter) and used just the two eggs and deleted the yolk. They came out yummy!

Good flavor and texture!  I was initially skeptical about 18oz of peanut butter, but it was soooooooo worth it!  The second time I made these I used Teddie's all natural peanut butter and they came out even better :)

I didn't add the chopped nuts, I find most people don't like them in traditional PB cookies.  This cookie was good, but still isn't exactly what I am searching for.  It was really peanut buttery, but a little dry.  I did watch how long I baked them...but they still turned out a little crumbly.

Was just "OK". nothing exceptionally "nutty" about the flavor... dough was easy to wrok with as long as it was COLD. Needed to be undercooked to be any good - dried out and crumbly when even a few minutes near the recommended time.

Very good peanut butter flavor with excellent texture.I used European butter and the cookie held its shape. No need to look for a better recipe this has it all. Thanks for sharing Kevin. Makes 112 cookies using a 1&1/4 in. cookie scoop.

Very tasty and tender cookies. They do definitely need to be refrigerated for at least the 2 hours recommended prior to rolling the dough into balls for baking. I also thought they were better with just a little more (about 1/4 cup) of brown sugar but that might not be necessary if you use one of the sweeter brands of peanut butter.

These cookies rock. I actually froze up a few Caramilk bars, then chopped each little "pillow" in half and mixed it in the batter. I'm surprised by the people who left the cookies in the oven for so long though. My first batch I did at only 8 mins and decided to drop it down to 7 for the rest of the batches. They looked raw when they came out of the oven but once they cooled down they were perfect. I'll be making these again soon!

I just made the Peanut Butter Cookies and they were grate. I used chunky style P.B. which worked good in place of the chopped panuts. As for as the stickeyness others complained about I did not have that porblem nor did i chill or freeze dough. I placed butter flav. crisco on my hands and that kept my hands stickey free. Cooking spray should work the same. The whole flattening with a fork did not please me too much I did 2 batches 1st batch flattening 2nd left in walnut size ball after bakeing both batches the unflattened batch gave a creamer thicker cookie. I baked batches at 350F for 13min. in preheated oven. one of the Best P.B. cookie's I have tasted but recipe needed a little tweaking. P.S. rolling ball of dough in suger to avoid stickeyness messes with the taste of the cookie making a rich cookie way to sweat.

I hadn't made PB cookies in years, so I was excited to read the rave reviews; however, I can't recommend this particular receipe.  I found them to be too thin, too oily (1 cup of butter), plus, I don't think 2 1/2 eggs is a good idea either.  And, as others have mentioned, these cookies burn too easily.  Even thirty seconds too long would turn them a darker shade.

These are really good. I didn't like that I had to refridgerate for 2 hours so I rushed them. Because they were "sticky" because I did not refrigerate long enough, I rolled the drop of dough first in sugar and placed on the cookie sheet and then squished them with a fork. worked well for me. thanks

All I have to say is amazing.  I substituted the butter for a low fat butter and used reduced fat peanut butter.  I also substituted one cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips for the cup of peanuts.  I followed some other reviewer's suggestion and baked for 10 mins, let it cool for a minute on the sheet, and then transferred to a cooling rack.  I lined my nonstick cookie sheet with wax/parchment paper to make cleaner easier.  I will definitely be making these again.

I tried this recipe and it is the best recipe for peanut butter cookies that I have ever made.  These cookies are sooo good.  Very moist, but the key is not to overbake.

Mmm-mm-mmm... so peanut-buttery!!  Thanks, Kevin, for sharing this wonderful recipe.  I have been searching for a good pb cookie recipe for years and years, and finally my search is over!  These went faster than my choc chip cookies this year!

I dipped a meat tenderizer into sugar to slightly flatten the cookies, and they had a wonderful appearance as well as a great texture.

I was excited about trying a recipe with a whole jar of peanut butter but was a bit disappointed.   Even with a whole jar, there wasn't alot of taste to them, though they were very chewy.  The 2 hour waiting time after the dough was mixed was hard for my anxious 3 year old.  Wouldn't make these again.

4-20-2018 ~These were ok, but they won’t be in our Peanut Butter Cookie Hall of Fame.  Hubs generally loves every cookie that enters his mouth, but not this time.  He couldn’t exactly put his finger on why, but did say they didn’t have enough texture, that “they were the same throughout.”   I get it, and I agree. The dough was soft and moist, forecasting that the baked cookie would be too. Too soft, too moist - no chewiness, no crispiness, no crunchiness, just consistently soft from the outer edges to the center. This cookie needed some interest as well as some heft! Perhaps eliminating that extra egg yolk would help or adding a smidge more flour, maybe another 1/2 cup.  I also think it could use a little more leavener, maybe 1/2 tsp. of baking powder. But now we’re talking about a different recipe! This was a surprising disappointment, given its positives of using butter and twice as much peanut butter as many other recipes.

I made this recipe and the whole family LOVED IT!!! These cookies are easy to make and even easier to eat. =)
They are great prepared as directed, but even better just slightly under done!
This will be my go to peanut butter cookie recipe from now on!

This recipe is in my "regular rotation".  My family absolutely loves these, and I always make a double batch.  If I do not have chopped peanuts, I've been know to just use Extra Crunchy Peanut Butter and it turns out pretty well.

These are absolutely the BEST peanut butter cookies on the planet! I have never found an 18 oz jar of peanut butter, so I just use Skippy creamy p.b., which is 16.3 oz. I also do not put in the chopped peanuts. I have made these several times, and they are always a hit! They are so moist and chewy. Yummy!

I am normally not a PB lover. But I had so much in my cabinet for the kids. Instead of using regular PB and then the cup of peanuts I just used crunchy PB. These cookies are soooo good! I am surprised I'm eating them! The kids love them even more :) it does make a lot so I'll be bringing some to work lol

The BEST peanut butter cookie recipe!  I followed the recipe as is and made sure not to over bake them.  Kevin's description is spot-on....they really are the creamiest, moistest peanut butter cookies I've had.  You won't be disappointed.  Thanks Kevin!

Soft and peanut buttery yummiest-ness. Hubby, whose fav candy is Reese's, loved. Need I say more? Might be just an oven difference, but I baked for 10 min which was perfect.

I've made these several times just as the recipe reads and I think they're great.   They don't last long around the house either.  The dough doesn't frees every well but is still manageable. How can you not love a cookie that has a whole jar of peanut butter in it?!

Okay folks, here's what ya do: Reduce the flour to 1 3/4 cup, and the sugar to 2/3 cup. Then when they're fresh out of the oven, press a peanut butter cup right into the middle. Ooey, gooey, peanut buttery heaven, and the reduced flour makes the cookies amazingly soft.

The BEST peanut butter cookie ever. This is such a good recipe.  No changes needed.  I do leave them on the pan for several minutes after they come out of the oven.  They don't fall apart that way, yet do not over bake or dry out.

I think it's a great recipe.  Made as is, used un-salted butter because I had it on hand.  Cooked 10 min.  I used the Pampered Chef scoop (smallest one) and I got approx. 80 cookies that way.  Thanks!

Excellent! I used roughly chopped roasted salted peanuts as well as chunky peanut butter, and these were perfect! I would totally pay a couple bucks for one of these out of a glass case in a bakery.

I tried this recipe based on the reviews and I am in the "love this cookie" group.  The only thing I change is I omit the chopped nuts.  The cookies come out great every time.  This is the only PB cookie recipe I use since I found it on All Recipes.  Thank you Kevin Ryan!

BEST peanut butter cookies ever ate (after alterations).

I used a tad over 2 cups (since didn't level off top of the measuring cup w/ my knife).

I only keep self-rising on hand (so I never have to worry about adding the baking soda & salt). I only used 1.75 cups of flour leveling off the top of each measuring cup w/ my knife.

I put about 1.5 cups of the whole peanuts in a zip-lock bag & used a rolling pin to "chop"/break them up into small pieces. Ended up being a little over 1 cup of chopped peanuts, but hubby loves nuts, so I just threw the extra in (for a total of about 1.25 cups chopped nuts).

I sprinkle a tiny bit of white sugar on the tops of each cookie before putting them in the oven.

I baked these on a dark metal cookie sheet & found 350 degrees at 12 minutes to be a little TOO done (edges were turning brown which = overdone peanut butter cookie). Second batch went in for 11 minutes only & they were perfect.

We love iced cookies, so I made a simple icing (butter + powdered sugar), microwaved it a few seconds so it was runny & drizzled it over the warm cookies.  So good I cried.

NOTE: 
This is also a good batter to roll into a log and deep freeze.  Then you can just cut out single cookies a few at a time to make fresh cookies anytime you want.  (Frozen cookies need only 10 minutes to cook as long as you cut them thin enough, 11 if you cut them a little thicker.  Trial & error needed here for cook time depending on how thick you want your cookies to be.)

This is a fantastic peanut butter cookie recipe! I use it all the time. Since finding it I've made a few adjustments. First being, instead of adding extra nuts at the end I used crunchy peanut butter (saves on cost, it's one less thing to remember at the store, and it doesn't add extra unnecessary salt). Secondly, I add about 3/4 cup of coconut flakes to the mixture to give the cookies a little extra zip. Beware, adding too much coconut can make it hard for the cookies to keep shape while baking and they'll just crumble to bits.

These are the most delicious cookies ever, if you can get past how good the batter is and actually get them in the oven. I do cook them a little less than the recipe time, as I like mine on the softer side.  But, other than that, these are fantastic and a keeper.

Phenomenal! My husband took them to work and they were gobbled up instantly.  His co-workers said they were the best peanut butter cookies they had ever had.  Surprisingly, they taste even better the next day.  I used chunky peanut butter and baked for 10 minutes.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow..amazing peanut butter cookie recipe. I realized last minute that I bought a 15oz peanut butter but they were still really moist with a ton of peanut butter flavor. I got so many compliments on these cookies! Next time I think I'll add some chocolate chips or candies. I'll probably also cut the recipe in half unless I know I'm taking them for a large group since it makes 60 cookies!

These are OK. Very delicate. Followed the recipe as written. On the first batch I neglected to let it chill completely; They were almost too crumbly to eat. I let the remanding dough chill overnight, and slightly under-baked them; this batch was much better. Great PB flavor, but incorrect ingredient ratio. Worth a try if you're one who likes to "tweak" the recipe.

I love this recipe! I have been making it for years. One note: I use natural peanut butter for this recipe, and I found that the baking soda makes them a little bitter. I substitute 4 tsp baking powder for the 1 tsp baking soda and I love the results. :-)

I was not a big pb cookie fan; never enough peanut butter flavor. Now I'm a huge pb cookie fan. These are absolutely the best. I will be baking these again often. They baked up beautifully.

This recipie is tasty and very peanut buttery- however they are not soft and chewy. They arent hard, just crumbly cookie like.  If chewy and soft is what your looking for, this is not the recipie for you.

I halved the brown sugar and reduced to white sugar by about a quarter while increasing the peanut butter. Made them taste more authentic rather than like Reese's Pieces. Excellent recipe my family couldn't get enough!

These are super yummy. They are soooo peanut-buttery. I added  Reese's Pieces because I had leftover mini packages from halloween (but no chopped peanuts). I am going to bring these to a bake sale.

Sunflower seed butter was what I wanted to use, and I ran out of brown sugar so used a little molasses. The dough was extra sticky and wet, so I made sure it was very chilled before I rolled it out. I cooked them for 15 mins and they turned out great!

My husband and kids loved these cookies!  I don't care for the texture of them.  It is hard to explain, but they are very crumbly in your mouth.  I'll keep this recipe, but keep looking for that peanut butter cookie recipe that makes all of us happy.

These are fantastic! I don't use peanuts - I added Reeses peanut butter chips and roll them in sugar prior to flattening with a fork. They keep for weeks and still taste good. I cook for 8.5 minutes in a convection oven. The guys at work LOVE them!

This recipe is quite tasty and makes A LOT... I am currently at 6 dozen decent sized cookies & still have enough dough for about 2 dozen more. I baked them for exactly 10 minutes on parchment paper. They came out very light in color (could be that I used light brown sugar) so I wasn't sure if they were completely done -- but as I took them off the cookie sheet, I noticed that they were a perfect golden color on the bottom. I don't think they are "chewy" necessarily (despite all the butter & peanut butter!), but they definitely have a velvety texture. PB cookies are my hubs favorite so the true test won't be until he comes home tonight!

Best peanut butter cookies I've ever had.  I baked mine for 10 minutes and 30 seconds, put in the cookie jar while they were still slightly warm so that they would stay soft and chewy.  Yummy recipe

For those with peanut allergies--made these with almond butter for a twist, and they were fantastic! My mother in law liked them too :)

These are delicious!!! I picked this recipe since I wouldn't have to measure out peanut butter and it didn't use shortening. Some things I did different, just because it's how I cook.... -I just did 2 eggs, I didn't add the extra yolk (mostly because I couldn't figure out how.) -I didn't grease the cookie sheet. I didn't want to try to clean it off and my dad always taught me that peanut butter has enough oil as is.  -Finally I used a 1tbsp cookie scoop to keep things even and got 85 cookies. I would let them cool on the sheet about 2-3 minutes, stick it in the freezer for 5, and then get it ready again. I had a hard time keeping my dough cold, so I rolled them all at once, putting them into batches of 15 for each sheet.  I cooked mine for 12 minutes since I like them more on the barely cooked side so that the inside is still soft and doughy.  EXCELLENT RECIPE!!! Officially my new PB cookie choice!

Great peanut butter cookies!  My boyfriend loves peanut butter, so I sought out this recipe a couple years ago and he still requests them!  I do not use chopped peanuts, but sometimes do add chocolate chips to some of the cookies.  Two notes:  It's important to refrigerate the dough so it's easier to ball, and you should take these cookies out a little before you think, which, in my opinion, makes them softer and more delicious.  Thanks for posting a great recipe!

Very good cookies!!!  I made them without the nuts but added a pkg of mini chocolate chips and baked for 12 minutes (next time will do less time). Took them to a BBQ and everyone raved.  Will make again.

I pretty much followed the recipe to the letter.  The only thing I did different was to leave the dough in the fridge for about two and a half hours.  I also moistened my fork with water first before I flattened my dough.  I baked my cookies for the full 15 mins. and let set for about 2 minutes on the cookie sheet.  I then set them on foil topped with wax paper for another 3 mins. and finally placed them in the cookie jar.  Because they were still a little warm whn placed in the cookie jar this helped to make them chewy.  I will definitely make these cookies again my son loved them!

Wow! These were amazing. I didn't think the chopped peanuts would add much (why not just use crunch pb?) but it's definitely a great addition. I did use egg beaters for the one egg then a real yolk. Thanks to the reviewer who told me that half the jar is about 1 cup peanut butter.

Delicious! I made one cookie sheet of just pb cookies. Then I made a few that I baked in the ball form and when they came out of the oven I put a Reese's miniature cup in them. Then I added chocolate chips to the rest of the dough and made them. Made a ton of cookies-yum!! You definitely have to refrigerate the dough too!!

these cookies were prety good. I will have to update on my next trial. Taste was excellent but they came out too crumbly dispiteonly cooking them 8 minutes. I will use less flour and extra peanut butter next time.

Very peanutbuttery but sooooooo yummy! Added a little flour.  Make sure you roll into balls & lightly press with fork. Hubby said these are BEST PB cookies he ever had. I agree!

This is a great classic PB cookie recipe - very peanut buttery and they come out nice and soft.  I've made them several times, and the last time I added some mini chocolate chips.  I always dip the fork in sugar,  and use parchment paper on my cookie sheets (for all baking) so the dough doesn't stick.  They say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach...maybe these cookies are the reason my boyfriend sticks around!  :-)

Maybe it was the brand of peanut butter I used but these cookies were not the best cookies.  If you are going to make these make sure you love the peanut butter you are using.

I am baking challenged but these were so easy I pulled this off! I loved the fact I could put the dough in the frig and come back when I was ready to bake. Someone suggested making two logs, so I wrapped them in waxed paper, put one in the frig to bake in the morning and the other in the freezer (in freezer bag)for another day. It made a very nice looking cookie with a very nice flavor. I have a convection oven and used the suggested temp and time - though I did keep an eye on them at the end. Thank you, I'll make these again because they are so good and easy to handle!

These peanut butter cookies are awesome! I doubled the batch to pass them out to people and in doing so I used 1 jar of creamy organic peanut butter and 1 jar of crunchy organic peanut butter then ommited the peanuts. There is just enough 'crunch' with using the crunchy pb, that there is no need to use extra nuts. I would definitely stop searching for a Peanut butter cookie recipe and use this one!!

These were very peanut-buttery, but not very chewy.  I followed the recipe exactly, but they came out very crumbly and a little dry. Next time I'll try using shortening instead of butter.  My husband and rest of the family seemed to enjoy them-they weren't around for long!

These are amazing!  The first time I made them they turned out very thin, although quite tasty. The second time I made them I found the part of the recipe that said to refrigerate the dough for  hours. Well, duh.  They turned out perfect that time!  Highly recommend.

I loved these chewy cookies.  I was so worried that they weren't cooked all the way that I ended up overcooking the first batch.  Be sure to take them out when they still look wet, they will harden some while cooling.

The cookies burned.  I tried both dark and light pans, it seems like either my oven is off, which I doubt, or the time/temperature is off.  One way or another, if you try these cookies make sure that you watch them like a hawk.  The concept of a whole jar of PB is awsome, but these were not quite as creamy or nearly as moist as described.

These cookies are the best!  When I decided to make them for the hubby for Dad's Day, it was a little late in the day, so I really didn't have time to chill in the frig for 2 hours, so I put the dough in the freezer for about an hour, as well as between making batches.  It seemed to work out fine.  I used my cookie scoop to make the walnut size balls.  I did have to resort to using sugar on the fork to press down the cookies, as the dough was still a little sticky.  I took others advise an undercooked them just a bit and let them sit on the cookie sheet for a minimum of 3 minutes before transfering.  Everyone LOVED these cookies!!!  Thanks Kevin

Loved, loved, loved,these cookies! I love peanut butter cookies, and always look for a recipe that keeps them chewy. I followed this recipe to a T, except I only buy creamy peanut butter, and don't like peanuts in my peanut butter cookies.(Weird, cuz I love nuts in any other cookie, just not peanut butter.)I was impressed that this one batch made 3 dozen cookies, and passed some out to family and friends who are still raving about them! This will for sure be my peanut butter cookie recipe from now on.

Wow!  I have never really cared for peanut butter cookies-until now.  These are wonderful!  I left out the chopped peanuts and threw in a bag of mini chocolate peanut butter cups and the whole gang loved them.  Next time I think I'll try these using crunchy peanut butter, as someone else did.

I was a little bit disappointed with the results of this recipe.  They went rather flat while baking. The criss-cross fork impressions were lost. They were chewy, but it didn't have an intense peanut butter flavor like I was expecting. I prefer a firmer peanut butter cookie, this was thin and somewhat greasy. I used margarine instead of butter, because that is all I had on hand.  It was good, I might try this recipe again with butter to see if the results are better.

This was overall pretty good.  Maybe it just wasn't up to my standards where peanut butter cookies stand.  I was really hoping (considering there is a whole jar of peanut butter in it)this recipe would give me some peanut butter cookies that had a strong peanut butter taste but they didn't.  I think if I made this again, I would probably change a few things.  They were great cookies though.

These are quite good; moist, delicious, fulfilling! However, I made the following substitutions to remove all white sugars and flours, and to make it a "plant power"-based dessert.: 1. replaced white flour with 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour 2. replace white sugar for turbinado sugar (same amount). Lowered Brown sugar by 1/4 cup 3.replaced the eggs with ENER-G Egg replacement (per the directions on the box) 4. Replaced milk butter with veggie butter (any kind should be fine) 5. Used natural organic peanut butter (with the oil, and yes, the oil went right in. I happened to have on hand peanut butter with nuts, but smooth should be fine. The jar is an 16 oz.)  and that's it.  After I baked them (they also had to be under baked. 12 minutes seemed to be fine for my oven.)they were delicious and gone!  hope this helps anyone who is trying to eat a plant- based diet and still enjoy a great taste!

Saw this recipe on the site today and they sounded so good that I had to make them. The recipe did not dissapoint! I used super chunk peanut butter instead of adding extra peanuts, and they were very tasty!! Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Others obviously love this recipe, but I'm just not one.  The texture was crumbly and kind of cake-like.  Also, I was very surprised that they lacked taste. With all that peanut butter, I expected a lot more.  I'll go back to my old Betty Crocker recipe.

These are the best peanut butter cookies I have ever tasted.  I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the chopped peanuts and I added Nestle Tollhouse milk chocolate/peanut butter swirl chips on top after I flattened them with a fork.  I put 5 chips on each cookie so they wouldn't be overpowered with chocolate and they were perfect! Everyone loved them!

I just made these today. I used the JIF crunchy and I'm actually giving them 3.5 stars because they were pretty good. They are SOFT, but definitely not CHEWY.  The outside does harden a bit after you take the cookies out (agree with everyone else on making them underdone by at least a few minutes).  When you take them out, they actually look like you didn't cook them long enough, but they are totally done and will be softer if you do it this way.  I didn't have baking soda so used baking powder. I don't know how this affected the recipe.  If you're looking for a soft cookie with a PB taste, these are it. However, I'm trying to find a crispy outside and chewier center. I read that using more brown sugar and less granulated will help and I'll let you know how this turns out.  Made a lot of cookies, close to 80 with this recipe.

I'm glad I wasn't deterred by a few of the negative reviews, these were good.  My only advice would be to mix the ingredients thoroughly and do not forget to refrigerate for at least two hours to perhaps avoid some of the negative results that are reported.  I added semi sweet chocolate chips - very good.

Love these cookies!  Nice strong peanut butter flavor, just like I like 'em!  I had to refrigerate the dough for a couple of hours in order to make them into balls, but then it was fine.  Important to not bake until edges start to brown, and also leave on the tray to cool for a nice moist cookie.  I will make these again.

The dough gets melty really quickly, so put the batter in the fridge after every batch of cookies to prevent the dough from becoming too soft.  Also, after removing dough from fridge, wait a little while (so that the dough isn't too cold) before you place it in the oven - otherwise the cookies will have darker edges.

AWESOME! These are one of the best peanut butter cookies that I have ever eaten. I didn't realize that they had to be refrigerated for 2 hours before baking, so I just put the dough in the freezer for 30 mins. and they worked out perfectly. I love how they stood a little thicker instead of getting real flat. I baked them for 10 minutes a batch, but my oven is HOT! My husband and 2 year old loved these. I will be making them again! Thanks for posting:)

These cookies are so good!  I probably got around 60 cookies (including the delicious dough I ate) using a #40 disher.  I had to fight off my husband and parents from eating them so I had enough to give my husband's coworker who is the recipient.

I have made this recipe about 50 times now and as long as you don't over do the peanut butter or over bake them this is the best recipe ever. Variations I have tried are adding mini chocolate chips and Hershey's kisses. These keep for almost a week and stay very soft.

This is honestly the world's best cookie!  My girlfriend and I saw this recipe last week and since we both love peanut butter we decide to try it.  We used Jif extra crunchy so the cookies had nuts in them, and also added mini chocolate chips (about half the bag).  The batter was so thick it broke the mixer but we pretty much followed the recipe but used margarine and not butter and we didn't refridgerate for 2 hours...only 30 min. in the freezer.  Our bake time was a little over 10 min and they are PERFECT.  We can't wait to try the next recipe from this site. Happy baking!

This is a great reci[e. My husband's favorite cookie is peanut butter, but there was too much sugar in the recipe, so I cut the sugars in half (peanut butter already has sugar in it) and added Reeses Peanut Butter chips.  I also used crunchy peanut butter. They were gone in less than 2 days.

These were great! I had several open jars of pb, some nearly empty, some still half full. It wasn't as fresh as a new jar would be (for sandwiches), but I didn't want to waste it, so I thought using it in cookies would be perfect.  For those who are concerned about the texture of the cookies, they are like any other cookie. Some people prefer theirs to be soft, some like them crispy on the outside and chewy at the center. This recipe will yield both types depending on cooking time and the oven. It took me a few trays to find the perfect "doneness" for me. I actually found I cooked mine longer (nearly 20 minutes) because I made them larger and wanted them to be crispy on the outside and chewy at the center.  For those who said the cookies were stale, try the old trick of putting them in an airtight container (tupperware, ziploc, etc.) with a slice of bread, and they will soften up/stay soft.  Thanks for the great recipe! I've got enough "old" pb for another batch!

Excellent - I used crunchy peanut butter instead of adding chopped peanuts. I also added a bag of - white choc chips w/macadamia nuts.  I topped the cookies with a few peanut butter chips.  Everyone loves the cookies - even a friend who doesn't like peanut butter cookies.

These cookies were just OK. I followed the recipe exactly and I find these cookies a little dry and bland. I'm thinking if I do make these again, I might try to use the Honey Roasted crunchy peanut butter instead of the plain peanut butter to give it more flavor.

These really were amazing cookies.  I used a full jar of Skippy Natural Chunky peanut butter (15 oz) and they turned out fantastic.  I also followed another reviewer's suggestion of dipping the fork in sugar before pressing the cookies, which was a great idea.  Great cookies!

These cookies are really good.  I suggest making them "as indicated".  I did cut the recipe in half which may have effected the cooking time.  I wish I took them out at 10 minutes instead of 12 minutes because the bottoms of my cookies were very dark brown almost burnt.  I would just recomend to check them at about 9-10 minutes.  I also have a newer oven, maybe it gets too hot?  who knows...But despite my best effort to botch them they were fabulous!

Husband said these tasted like a bakery style cookie--so nice and soft! He likes his usually a little crunchy but had no problem eating these. I am not a peanut butter cookie fan but sampled a small piece and tasted pretty good! I would highly recommend!

These were very good, I will make them again, but I omitted the peanuts and I think they would be better with that crunchiness in there.  Would even try it with crunchy peanut butter, or Ooooh add some chocolate chips!!  Great recipe, easy to make and work with...thanks!

Excellent peanut butter cookie recipe.  I added some chocolate chips to the last half of the batter for a little variety, and my family really enjoyed.  I also had some left over melted chocolate, and dipped half of the baked cookies into the melted chocolate.  Made for a pretty presentation and tasted yummy.  

Thanks for sharing.

Great peanut butter cookie recipe! Creamier and tastier than other recipes I've tried, but it should come with a warning: this makes a TON of cookies. I used this recipe to make the chocolate kisses peanut butter cookies and it made over 100 2" cookies!! Definitely half this if you don't need that much! Chilling the dough is a must since this dough is really soft.

PERFECT peanut Butter Cookies ! ! After the first batch and a thumbs up from my husbands sweet-tooth, I made a doublebatch to put into the freezer. I set the frozen balls in the fridge the night before baking(or on the counter for an hour).  These cookies remind me of my childhood . . .

This recipe is amazing! I don't like nuts in my cookies and found that without them, the cookies break easily.  The next batch I made I added peanut butter chips and WOW! I am now expected to make these at every get together!

This are the best p-nut butter cookies I have ever tasted.  After my first btch,  days ago..I made 2 more batches. I find it handy if you roll log logs of walnut size in diameter, wrap in wax paper, then refridgerate at least 2 hrs., then slice about 1.5 apart, sure saves time from rolling ea. into balls.  This is the only p-nut butter cookie recipe I'll ever make again!

Really, really good. I've been searching for a good peanut butter cookie recipe. All the others on this site call for 1/4 or 1/2 cup.  That just isn't enough. This recipe worked well even with my home made peanut butter.  Kevin is correct when he says to not over bake. Mine were done in 10 minutes.

This recipe is AMAZING!!! I'm not a very good baker but i attempted these because my son really wanted them and they turned out perfect! Thank you to whoever wrote that the recipe called for 2 cups of peanut butter.  And like a lot of others, i would definitely add to NOT overbake!!

This recipe was fantastic! I added chocolate chips to it, and only cooked them for 9-10 minutes. Make sure you preheat! I will definitely be making these again.

This recipe is for peanut butter addicts!!! I definetly loved the recipe and didnt change a thing, BUT be very careful with the time you put them in the oven, 9 minutes worked for me. These are awesome!! I live in chile so alot of people dont like peanut butter because its a very US thing but they loved these!!! 
I almost gave it a 4 star because of the calories (too much) but if you make these you cant worry about them being healthy or not.. They are great for an ocassional treat

Very good. I did back just a little longer then suggested. I was having an issue with the dough breaking up while rolling the balls so I had to re-refrigerate.

Fabulously moist cookies! I accidentally used baking powder so they weren't as big, but still amazing. I also didn't use the peanuts and they tasted great. Thanks for this awesome recipe!

This is the best - and easiest - peanut butter cookie EVER.  Always soft and creamy.  Everyone asks for the recipe!  They freeze and mail well also.  Bravo...should be at the TOP of your cookie list.

These cookies were very good.  They had good taste, but they are very delicate.  
Thanks for a great recipe.  Will continue my search for "the one".

These cookies are wonderful! I have been making this recipe for about 2 1/2 years and my whole family just eats them right up. I cant keep them in the jar. I find that they stay extra soft when I put 2 slices of bread underneath them with a papertowl on top. They stay just as soft as coming out of the oven.... :-)

These cookies have the most amazing peanut butter flavor.  I make the recipe as is and it is perfect.  For the best flavor and texture, you definitely need to take them out before they look done.  The only problem I have experienced is that they tend to fall apart more easily than the average cookie.  Great recipe!

these are the best peanut butter cookies i have ever made! they are gone same day in my house! i used extra crunchy peanut butter instead of adding additional nuts. instead of flattening them before baking, i simply made them as i would drop cookies, and shortened baking time to 9 minutes with 2 minutes of cool time on the sheet before removing them. awesome!!

Soft, yummy PB cookies!  Easy to make.  I used half unsalted butter and the other half salted.  I made these with no nuts and they are still very good.

These are the best peanut butter cookies I've ever tasted. I just make one small substitution: instead of the peanuts I put in Reece peanut butter chips. They are delicious this way! Will pass this on to everyone I know. I also recommend undercooking slightly. 12 mins is the max I keep them in.

great recipe..I made these 2 days ago and they ate still crisp chewy. My personal secret is the always turn my cookie sheets front to back and top to bottom half way thru the baking time. I rolled these in sprinkles before pressing them out with a fork for some holiday color and they turned out beautiful and delicious. I forgot to frige the dough but still worked great.Thanks!

This is a terrific recipe. . . and it is soooo easy to make (I have a 6 year old and a 1 year old, so I appreciate easy recipes.)  Like some other reviewers, 8 to 9 minutes is plenty of cooking time for a softer cooker, unless you prefer crispier cookies.  My mom makes terrific peanut butter cookies and these rival her's!!  When I first made these last winter, we couldn't stop eating them!  My picky husband even liked these, as did everyone else.

This is the best peanut butter cookie recipe ever. I used baking powder instead of baking soda and omitted the peanuts and they were wonderful. I even took a picture of a batch 
I made and now have the picture hanging on my wall, that's how good they look and taste.

With one exception, this is the best peanut butter cookie I have ever tasted. I made two revisions to the recipe- I halved the sugars and omitted the nuts. My first pass at these cookies presented wonderful cookies, but a little too sweet for me (sort of masked the peanut butter taste). With the sugars cut in half, the cookie was Perfect! Yum!

These are great peanut butter cookies .I used a cookie scoop.I only put my dough in the fridge for 15 minutes and they turned out fine.I also only baked them for 9 minutes ,then left them on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes.This recipe is a keeper.

I've made soooo many of these cookies over that past 2 years and everyone always loves them! I just use Peanut Butter with nuts and skip adding the nuts it calls for. This recipe is always a hit with Peanut Butter cookie lovers!

The BEST peanut butter cookie!  These are my staple, sometimes I don't add the chopped nuts, sometimes I make kiss cookies with them, they are soft and perfect!

These were good but definetly don't bake 12-15, mine were done after 8 minutes.  I wish they were a little more moist, next time I will make the cookies larger and see if that helps.

Very good cookies.  I'm rating them 4 stars because I couldn't get them really soft and chewy without sacrificing some color and appearance.  I used extra chunky peanut butter and added mini semi-sweet chips instead of the extra chopped nuts as suggested by other reviewers.  I formed the cookies with a #40 scoop which made them just the right size for me.  At this size and in my oven, 11 minutes left them greyish, oily on top, and soft & chewy, 12 minutes gave them a pretty light brown color and left them with a little softness but still more crispy than I prefer.  A larger cookie may have turned out softer, but for portion size reasons, I prefer not to make my cookies so large.  This recipe makes a ton of cookies, so I partially solved this problem by making one tray of greyish, soft ones for me and making the rest pretty and crispier for company  :-).  Overall, this is a keeper recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

For an end-of-exams/Christmas homecoming treat, my husband requested "peanut butter chocolate chunk" cookies.  I found this recipe, substitued chocolate chunks instead of peanuts, and ... DELICIOUS!!  Best peanut butter cookie recipe I've ever tried - it is sure to quickly become a family favourite!

These were gorgeous. I had no difficulty at all turning out 3 pans full of the most delicious, tender, perfectly-chewy, addictive peanut butter cookies I've ever made (plus a quart bag full of preformed dough balls in the freezer). I used Adams unsweetened no-stir peanut butter and whole wheat pastry flour and they're not too sweet, just right. I did have to bake them for much less than 12 minutes though -- 7 was more like it -- maybe walnuts are bigger in Kevin's part of the world? Hee hee. I'll make these many more times.

These were pretty good but not fantastic. But I don't think it's the recipe's fault. My husband is on a health kick and won't eat anything with partially hydrogenated oils. So I had to use "healthy" peanut butter instead of the good stuff. If I had used Jiff, this probably would be 5 star recipe. If I use Jiff in the future though, I think I'd cut down on the sugar a bit. These were almost too sweet even with using the healthy peanut butter, which has no sugar in it.

SO yummy!  Recipe as written is fabulous, but if you're lookier for something a bit healthier and thicker...  I felt the fat (butter & peanut butter) to flour ratio was quite high, so I used 1 cup of trans fat free Crisco instead of butter and increased the rest of the ingredients by 50%.  (If I'm going to the trouble of making cookies I want a BIG batch!)  Also used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour and replaced 1/2 of the white sugar with Splenda.    I used Crunchy PB as suggested by some other reviewers.  The cookies came out thick and moist and really delicious.  You will never miss the extra fat.  In fact, I think it makes the cookies better.

The ULTIMATE peanut butter cookie!  I also used Jif crunchy peanut butter and omitted adding the peanuts.  Perfect!  I only got about 3 dozen cookies but they are huge and perfectly round.  I also chilled the dough overnight.  I'd like to see any bakery beat this recipe! Only problem is now I have to hide them from myself as I can't stop eating them!  Thanks!

These cookies are to die for. I used creamy peanut butter and I left out the extra egg yolk and the chopped peanuts. They disapeared in record time. Let the cookies cool for at least 10 minutes on the cookie sheet before removing them or they will fall apart. They're that moist.

WOW...these really are the best cookies ever.  This has become the only recipe I use for PB Cookies.  They are great with chocolate chips added too.  I have also used them as thumbprints and "kiss" cookies and they always turn out great. 
Thanks for a GREAT recipe!!

This was a good recipe as far as taste and texture was concerned. But, like another reviewer, I thought the cookie was just a tad bit oily. I was so concerned about over baking, that I took it them out after 10 min. ( I made them large, like you find in the cookie stores). But a pretty good cookie. Not CAKEY--but dense and MOIST !!!!

These were pretty good.  I baked them for 12 minutes and I think that was too much.  My cookies weren't chewy, which is the way I prefer them.  If I make these again, I'd only bake for 10 minutes.  However, I think I'll keep trying different recipes first.

ATTENTION peanut butter cookie aficionados:  These are the best ever.  Cooking time is vital to top quality outcome!  I followed the recipe exactly as written and realized that 30 seconds too long would change both the flavor and texture.  The first batch took 10 minutes, but less for each additional batch.  Don't wait until the edges brown...they must be immediately removed from the oven when the top looks dry.  I recomend watching them toward the end.  Better than any specilty bakery. Thank you Kevin,

These PB cookies were absolutely fabulous! Thank goodness I made them for my husband to take on his "annual mountain biking trip with the boys" otherwise, I would eat them all. The only thing I did different is after rolling the dough into a ball, I roll them in granulated sugar. This makes them have a nice sweet outside coating. Thanks Kevin!

This recipe is great! I changed it slightly, and instead of having peanuts, i shopped in half mini reese's cups and froze them...then made the cookies. OH MY GOODNESS! The way to a man's heart is so definately through his stomach. Believe me....;-) I got lots of love...and appreciation for these babies.

These cookies were a hit. Everyone loved them! Instead of using chopped peanuts, I used a bag of  milk chocolate chips, which gave it much more taste variation (like peanut-butter cups). Was excellent, I will make it again.

Extremely Delicious. Very easy. I used Jif chunky peanut butter and left out the nuts as I didn't have any. Definatley needs to chill for the 2 hrs or it's sticky. I dipped the fork in sugar as I flattened them. They are chewy if slightly underbaked, 11 mins worked perfect for me.

These cookies are the best!!! very rich. I would not change anything but here is a little something that I do!
I roll the cookie dough in sugar then press with the fork. It elimanats that yucky flour on the top of the cookie. Also remember undercooked is better than over cooked.

These are chewy, moist and crunchy all at the same time.  So much better than the standard peanut butter cookie!

I was expecting alot more from these cookies than what i got.  The flavor really wasn't great and they were somewhat dry and greasy.  I may try to make them again because all the reviews are so great, i may have messed something up, but i don't see what it could have been.

I have found my new favorite recipe. I also used a jar of extra chunky peanut butter instead of extra nuts and I substituted 1/2 cup margarine for a 1/2 cup of the butter. I baked them for 12-13 minutes after only chilling for 1 1/2 hours and they are the best I've ever tasted, yummy!

I added a cup of semisweet chocolate chips and they were perfect!  Oh, and I used reduced fat smooth Jiffy Peanut butter!  You won't be disappointed in these!

I thought the flavor was good but the cookies did not stay soft after they cooled, which I was expecting.  So that was a disappointment, as I'm not a big fan of crunchy cookies.  My other complaint is that the chopped peanuts I used tasted funny in them - although this might have just been the type of peanut I used.  I'll probably give this one more try and use a nutty PB instead of adding peanuts, maybe that'll work better.  Fingers crossed!

If I could give this recipe 100 stars I would in a second. This recipe has made me almost famous in my community. I cant go to any social function without these or else I am outcasted!!! They are seriosuly amazing...I make the cookies with chunky peanut butter just to give it extra flavor (not that it needs it) and they are twice as good! Thank you for this recipe..I would'nt have any friends without it!!!!!

I finally found the PERFECT peanut butter cookies!  The flavor was so peanut buttery and the texture was velvety!  I used mostly creamy peanut butter because of my small children.  They are so addictive, my husband and I couldn't stop eating them!! If you don't mind eating a whole batch for yourself, I recommend you make these for a crowd!

The Best! Wow are these good! They taste just like my mother's. 
I used a whole jar of smooth, and a dash of chunky for some "nut" texture, they turned out fine. 
The only trouble I had was the mixing - the batter was slightly uneven with peanut butter patches, but then again I was using a makeshift mixer. This is the third day, and they're as good as ever! 5 stars!

Terrific cookies.  Instead of 2C all purpose flour I used 50/50 whole wheat and all purpose flour, I used both all-natural peanut and almond butter (no sugar added) and I omitted the chopped peanuts.  They were chewy, soft, and full of flavor but not too sweet. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Not for the peanut butter faint of heart.  Very good peanut butter flavor. Cookie is very soft with a great texture . Do not overcook. My peanut butter cookie search has ended.

Fantastic peanut taste!  I substituted 1 stick of margarine for one stick of butter, but only because didn't have enough butter.  I also didn't refrigerate the mix before baking because I simply didn't see that part of the recipe in time.  I wondered how you rolled them. LOL.  I used a scoop that I normally use for my choc chip cookies.  They still came out great, I was even able to criss-cross them.  
I had been looking for a good pb recipe.  This is it!

These were THE BEST peanut butter cookies I have EVER had or made!  Although the recipe says to bake at 350 for 12-15 minutes, I found that that made the cookies real dry... I baked them at 350 for just 5 minutes and OH MY GOD!  SO moist and chewey!!  LOVE EM!

Absolutely wonderfull!!! My mother-in-law used to make peanut butter cookies for my husband. I had only tried to make them once befoe with the three ingredient recipe. Needless to say, he hated them. He ask me to make him some, and I found your recipe. It is a gift from God. He LOVES these cookies, as will anyone who tries them. Easy to make, simple ingredients, foolproof. Thanks for sharing.

My boyfriend like them alot.  I really didn't care for them.  I have had better.  I will not make these again.  I will continue to look for a better one.  The only reason i give it three stars, is because the old man liked them.  Maybe I should only give them two stars...

Very good flavor.  I used smooth peanut butter
in the dough, then for the second half of the batch, I added chopped peanuts and mini chocolate chips.  Two days later, they are still
moist and tender, stored in airtight containers.

Incredible!  I made these several months back and just now got the time to send a review.  I too used 1/2 and 1/2 peanut butter and left the peanuts out b/c I don't normally have those on hand.  I am thinking of making again today.

All I can say is Wow!  Peanut butter cookies are usually not my favorite but these were very good!  I used 1/2 crunchy peanut butter and 1/2 creamy peanut butter and left out the peanuts.  I would definitely recommend underbaking them.  With my brand new electric oven, 11 minutes was perfect.  They were chewy and moist.  Yum!

Great recipe. The only tweaks I made is added a bag of chocolate chips.  I used more Dark brown sugar than white (1/2 dark brown 1/2 white)  and baked for only 11 minutes. This gave me the chewy gooey texture I wanted from a chocolate chip peanut butter cookie yummy:)

This recipe is true to its name I I used jiff for my peanut butter and salted butter.  I really should have read the entire recipe first it said to refrigerate for 2 hours after mixing by then I was too tired to bake I left it overnight no problem there.  My daughter baked them for me she stayed true to the time and it worked out good. These cookies were delicious and I don't even like peanut butter cookies (made them for my son's birthday) I had so much left over so I brought them to work and everyone came up to me and said how good they were.  One person even said they were the best peanut butter cookie hes ever tasted.

These turned out great! I didn’t have time to let the dough sit, so I didn’t do that part (which could be why the dough was so soft) so to make them a touch sweeter and more of a firm dough, I added 3/4 cup powdered sugar. My family loved them as did all my neighbors. They were gone within 10 minutes of coming out of the oven and it made over 36 cookies for me! Also I scooped them with a drop cookie scoop. This is my new go to recipe for peanut butter cookies.

Read the reviews and heeded the suggestion to add ½ cup more each of peanut butter and flour and 1 tsp. of vanilla. Didn’t have butter so used shortening. Cooked them at 350 for 15. They were light, fluffy and moist. Making them again for sure!

I used organic PB, so that may be the reason these turned out a little dry and crumbly. Still very tasty. But not the chewy, moist cookies I was hoping for.

These are so great! My husband loves them and he's not a fan of peanut butter cookies. The only thing I didn't do was add the chopped nuts. Other than that, I followed the recipe. Perfect, delicious, and I'll be making these again and again. Thank you for a great recipe!

I made the recipe exactly as stated except I omitted the peanuts. I used natural jif with honey... I did only cook for 9 minutes and I squished them a little with a fork covered in sugar. I used a tiny spray of Pam on the sheet.. took them out when they still looked wet in the center and let them sit on the cookie sheet a few minutes to finish cooking.

Most delicious recipe I've found! 

I rolled the balls of dough in a small bowl of white sugar before flattening. I'm not sure where I learned that trick, nor it's purpose, but who doesn't like a bit more sugar?!

These were good, very peanut buttery, but dry. My family asked me to keep searching for a good recipe. This one was okay, but I suspect I will not use it again.

Amazing! Baked for 12 minutes 30 seconds, then cooled for the same amount of time on the baking sheets before removing. Used 2 cups of peanut butter (slightly heaping) instead of jar -- jars around here aren't the right size, so I looked up the equivalent. Used cookies scoop and rolled cookies in sugar before flattening slightly with a fork.

Bump up the rating to 5 stars, this is a wonderful peanut butter cookie recipie. Best ever, tons of compliments, even I liked them and I don't like peanut butter.
Would say that like the author stated "are best when a little under cooked". Getting ready to make some more right now

My dentist got all the older lady patients to complete on who could make the best peanut butter cookie.  I tried this recipe.  The whole office thought these were, by far, the best.  (I used chunky peanut butter instead of adding chopped peanuts and it was a warm day so the cookies were warm from being in the car.)

This is a good recipe!  Just enough peanut butter.  The only adjustment I made was adding about a third cup more of flour to be able to roll into balls.  The batter was a brownie batter consistency, which is not good for rolling.

The best peanut butter cookies ever. Left out the peanuts and added peanut butter chips because I LOVE PEANUT BUTTER. Timing is tricky but good if underdone slightly.  I let them cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before removing and avoided having them crack.  I will be making these frequently.  Even my mother loves them and she is not a peanut butter fanatic

These were great peanut butter muffins! Unfortunately, I was looking for cookies to come out of the oven. What I got instead were thick, cake-type-things masquerading as cookies.

 If you do make this recipe, I'd recommend making sure the cookies are pressed down quite a bit so they hold better. (Like another reviewer, I did not find these 'chewy', they just fell apart easily.

These are absolutely the best pb cookies out there. I've made these more than once and always get requests to make more. They are very moist and delicious. I don't think it is necessary to change anything from the original recipe.

These cookies by far have the most peanut butter flavor! I used crunchy peanut butter instead of using the chopped peanuts, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I will Deffinatly will be using this recipe when I want to make peanut butter cookies again in the future!

I absolutely love this recipe! It has a very rich peanut butter flavor. I read others reviews and baked for 10 mins, allow to firm up on cookie sheet before removing, and you will have a nicely golden crispy edge with a soft chewy center. After rolling into balls it helps to put back into the refrigerator or the dough gets sticky.

Good cookies, but not my favorite, although I can't quite figure out what should be different.  Followed the recipe pretty close ... Just Didn't add the chopped peanuts.  Definitely needed the two hours of refrigeration before rolling and baking ... With that, they spread to the perfect thickness.  Didn't need to grease the cookie sheets or use parchment paper.

Made these exactly as the recipe stated; however, I think I cooked the first batch too long. I took them out in  15 minutes, but that was too long. I have the remainder of the dough refrigerated to finish tomorrow, so I will try 13 minutes. The flavor is very, very peanutbuttery without being overly sweet. I just prefer a softer, chewier cookie, so  cut down the baking time if you also prefer a softer cookie.

This is the ONLY recipe for peanut butter cookies!!! Made a batch and took then to work just expecting oh good cookies, My co workers said they were the best peanut butter cookies they have ever had! I omitted the peanuts, its is personal preferance. My jar of peanut butter was only 16 ounces and it did not make a difference, and also watch them will baking you definitly do not want to over bake them.

Not my favorite. The cookies were too dry and not soft and chewy. Followed recipe exactly and won't be using this recipe again.

These are very flavorful, in terms of peanut butter. They did not turn out as moist as I expected. I only cooked them for 12 minutes, but maybe the next batch I'll cook for a shorter time.

Ultimately THE BEST best peanut butter cookies I've ever tasted!  Everyone loves them.  So moist.  I don't like hard peanut butter cookies.

These truly do melt in your mouth! My husband who is not a peanut butter cookie fan at all ate 12 in one sitting! I made these a week ago and my family is already asking for another batch. Omitted the peanuts and salt as I used salted butter and we prefer a smooth peanut butter cookie. Otherwise, followed recipe exactly as written. Kudos!

Followed the recipe exactly except that I used chunky peanut butter instead of adding peanuts.  I put chocolate kiss on each cookie while still warm.  Yummy!

These are the peanut butter cookies from my  childhood! We did not use the chopped peanuts as we didn't have them on hand and I don't recall my family adding those. We will try them in our next batch for a crunchy treat.

Delicious! This recipe really packs in the peanut butter flavor. I used chunky peanut butter so the cup of chopped peanuts wasn't necessary. I will be making these again very, very soon!

I followed this recipe exactly (without nuts) and the cookies turned out wonderful! I do have to admit, I tried to make them a little healthier by using "light" butter and Splenda instead of sugar. They turned out really soft and really tasty! This is going to be my keeper recipe for peanut butter cookies. Thanks!

Amazing recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, omitting the chopped peanuts at the end, and the cookies came out amazing. Everyone raved about them. Note: these cookies ARE best when slightly undercooked, but I pulled my first batch a bit too early. Instead of tossing them, I crumbled them over a bowl of vanilla ice cream and added some chocolate sauce, and voila, and amazing extra dessert made from the "ruined" cookies.

Cookie was so crumbly!  Had to leave on cookie sheet for 7-10 minutes to cool, then transferred to cooling racks until TOTALLY cooled.  The cookies crumbled to dust when my kids tried to get one warm from the oven.  I baked mine for 8 minutes...they are not done in the center, but they kind of held together better.  Taste is wonderful, though.

Awesome!  The only changes I made were due to lack of ingredients.  I didn't have brown sugar so I used the ol' white sugar with maple syrup trick, and I didn't have baking soda so I just threw in a full teaspoon of salt to make up on the flavor.  They came out fantastic and were well loved by everyone in the house!   Definitely a recipe I am saving for the future!@

These are great! I was a little short on flour and probably over cooked them a hair but it's a very forgiving recipe. These cookies turned out great. Thanks for the recipe, I'll be making these again for sure.

I topped these with a recipe for chocolate fudge butter cream and they were GONE within a two hour time period.  I used Jif creamy peanut butter and added Reese's peanut butter chips instead of nuts and they were perfect. Thanks!

These are AMAZING. I'm not usually a fan on peanut butter cookies but these were awesome. I did run out of eggs so I didn't have the third for the egg yolk and also skipped the peanuts. They were perfect even then. Definitely better slightly undercooked. Will never make a different recipe again.

Excellent Recipe!!!  I dipped my fork in sugar before I touched each cookie and I never had a problem with the dough sticking.  I also kept the dough in the fridge between preparing each cookie sheet which was great.  NO PROBLEMS AT ALL!!!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

These were wonderful. I accidentally bought crunchy peanut butter and so I cut back a little on the peanuts. I did bake them the full time because I like my cookies crunchy and not chewy. I has a hard time making the fork marks because the fork keep sticking to the dough, I even sprayed it with Pam. Depsite the lack of fork marks, it was still very tasty.

Made these with my daughter last weekend.  They may be the best peanut butter cookies we've ever had!  We did put a few chocolate chunks on top of each one to make them irresistible.

This is, by far, the very best peanut butter cookie recipe in the world!  I have been making it for a few years now and I always get requests for the recipe. Sometimes I toss in a few chocolate chips and mmmm mmm! Thanks for sharing this recipe, Kevin!

I have been looking for a great peanut butter cookie and now I have found it. I used crunchy peanut butter like so many others. I did make my own brown sugar with black strap molasses b/c IMHO the domino brand on the east coast has a weak flavor and is very dry not a moist brown sugar like C&H. Anyways this now my go to recipe.

I used all brown sugar to make them softer.  Great flavor. Not too sweet.

I used a 15 ounce jar of Skippy Natural (Creamy) and found that they were the best peanut butter cookies I have ever had. I would recommend this to anyone who has a love affair with peanut butter!

This is by far the best PB cookie recipe I have found. Always moist and soft. They usually don't last 24 hours with my family, even though I have found they taste even better the next day. You may want to sneak some in a secret place just for yourself. I also really like that you can make the dough and freeze it to bake later. I have left it in the freezer for over a week and they still turned out perfect. I did thaw before baking. Thanks for the recipe!!!!

Very tasty! I undercooked as recommended.  I also suggest leaving on the cookie sheet a few minutes to cool before transferring to the cooling rack.  The second time I made them I added chocolate chips and they were very good also!  One more tip I followed was to roll dough in a tube to chill and then slice to bake. Worked well with less fuss and mess.

Absolutely fabulous. I left out the peanuts, because I like my peanut butter cookies to be smooth as silk, and these are. Baking time was less than the recipe said (about 10-11 minutes), but other than that, it was pefect. Thanks!

Very good! I used crunchy peanut butter because that's what I had AND added the cup of peanuts - yum. These cookies are very peanut buttery and tender - soft shortbread-y and melt-in-your-mouth. Thanks!

i guess to me peanut butter cookies are peanut butter cookies  and i have never had a recipe that didnt turn out or werent good.  these are just as good as every other recipe out there.  so the only downside about these is you have to refrigerate the dough for a couple hours.  great cookies!  thanks!

After all the great reviews on this recipe, I decided this was it and made then today.  I have to say that they were a good consistency and texturebut I thought they would have a strong peanut butter taste, which I was disappointed that they didnt.  I followed the recipe to a tee and thought they lacked flavor.  Made half a batch plain and then added some M&M's to try to kick up the flavor...still something was missing, altho the grandkids ate em up.  I dont think I will be making these again.

THESE ARE AN ABSOLUTE TASTE DELIGHT.  I DIDN'T ADD THE PEANUTS AS I USED THE CHUNKY PEANUT BUTTER AND I ADDED BUTTERSCOTCH CHIPS IN THEIR PLACE.  OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD.

OH.MY.GOD!!!!  I have made a lot of cookies in my 45 years.  These are hands down the best cookies I've ever made.  I had to alter a little bit out of necessity, rather than desire.  I don't keep butter and I don't like to use margarine in cookies, I use golden Crisco and butter flavouring.  I also didn't have any vanilla (oops!) so I just used 2 tsp of butter flavour instead of 1 and 1.  I used crunchy peanut butter because that's what I buy and didn't have any nuts anyhow.  Finally, I added milk/white chocolate swirled chips because they taste good!  They came out with almost a shortbread texture to them and were simply incredible!  I will never use another PB cookie recipe!!! Thanks so much for posting it!

Made these exactly according to the recipe. They were awesome peanut butter cookies! I agree with reviewers who said not to overcook, cooking for the minimum makes them chewy inside. This will be my go-to recipe for pb cookies from now on.

My Daughters & I just finished baking a batch of these and they are DELICIOUS! Definately have a couple of baking sheets handy though, as they need to be slightly under-baked & then left on the sheet for several minutes before you transfer them to cool: they are very soft & crumbly until they cool off. THANKS, these are deifinately a new favorite!

all the reveiws are true, one of the best recipes! i subbed 1/2 splenda for the sugar amount and doubled the recipe and added 1 tsp of vanilla per batch. Just about all are gone. The only negative thing-need to go and back some more!

I have belonged to allrecipes for many years and this is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review. These cookies were absolutely fantastic. I changed nothing, just followed the recipe and experienced a peanut butter cookie that had a consistency like nothing I'd tried before. This recipe is an absolute KEEPER!

PERFECT!!!!!  The BEST peanut butter cookies I have eaten or made.    They are not too dry, you just have to be sure not to overcook them.  The bottom should only be slightly brown.  If the tops are brown you cooked them too long.  I make them without the chopped peanuts but they would be just as good with them in.

I thought they were a little dry. Would have been better with chocolate chips or something. I used Smuckers Natural PB, perhaps that it why they were dry, maybe they need the preservatives in the regular PB.

Thank you Kevin for such great recipe!They were fantastic and everyone loved them.  I will make them again and some sort of chocolate goodness.  I baked them for 11 minutes this time and I might only cook it for 10 or 10.5 minutes next.  My cookies also looked like the picture so I was quite happy about that good.  Yumz0r!

INSANELY DELICIOUS!  I cut the recipe in 1/2, b/c I just wanted a small batch to try.  I also used HONEY ROASTED peanuts, which are coated in sugar & I really think that it MADE this recipe & I also hand-chopped them (keeping them rather large).  And, other reviews are right - 10-11 minutes is all this recipe needs.  The cookies will look completely unbaked, but they are delicious if you like a soft p-nut butter cookie.  This is the only p-nut butter cookie recipe I will ever use!!!  THANKS for a great one!!!

Definitely a keeper! This was my first time making peanut butter cookies and it came out fabulous! I made them for my boyfriend's birthday party and they were ALL eaten up :) I followed some reviewer's advice and used crunchy peanut butter instead of smooth peanut butter and the peanuts.  I followed the recipe exactly and will definitely use this one again.  One mistake I made was that I refrigerated the dough overnight...this led to the dough being kinda dry and crumbly in the morning when I baked them.  But, I just let it sit and warm up at room temperature and added a tiny bit of butter and the dough softened back up and was easy to use. I also had a problem with the dough sticking to my fork, but that too eased up when the dough softened, and I used some non-stick cooking spray on the fork.  I usually don't bake but this has provoked me to try something else soon!
Made these again on 8/7/10: be sure to stir it up well or else you'll get different batches of cookies like I did! I also used the suggestion for pressing with a sugared fork to prevent them from sticking...this worked really well and I'll do that again next time!

These were exceptionally good peanut butter cookies! I made these for my family, and they were gone within the day! They were moist and chewy, and very peanut buttery:D I followed the recipe exactly, and was very pleased with how well these turned out.

Hmmmm...I'm not sure what went wrong here.  I followed the recipe exactly -- although I did use natural crunchy peanut butter.  The taste was good but they were very very crumbly and not really presentable for guests.  Perhaps the fillers in regular peanut butter keeps them together better?

These tasted mediocre. I had to use margarine instead of butter... But I don't know that that would've altered the taste. A lot of doing for not a lot of result. :\

These are hands down, by far the best peanut butter cookies I've ever made (and I've been baking for years).  I love them just as they are.  For an added treat, I wrap the dough around a Hershey's caramel filled Kiss and then roll it in a combination of cinnamon and sugar.  It just doesn't get any better than this.  Thanks so much for such a terrific recipe!

I really didn't think this recipe was all that.  The texture is good - they melt in your mouth, they are moist, but there just isn't a strong enough peanut butter flavor for me.

Great recipe!
I made this into mixed nuts cookies by replacing the 2TBSP Vanilla Extract with 1/2TBSP Almond Extract and the Chopped Peanuts with Chopped Mixed Nuts-
Try it next time. ;)

These are wonderful cookies! My kids and husband love them as well. Don't make them if you're on a diet though ;-) I used all natural peanut butter, the kind you have to stir, which has more of a peanut taste than the other peanut butters made w/ sugar and hydrogenated oils. I also used a little scoop to put them on my pan, then criss-crossed them w/ a fork. Bake time was exactly 8 minutes. It made 100 cookies this way! Wow!

these had great taste! but everyone should be careful to not overmix the batter! i think that was my mistake and the cookies came out crumbly, almost like shortbread, but still chewy and soft on the inside! so i'll definetely try to make them again! hope they'll come out more chewy and moist next time!

We loved these cookies.  After we made them, we used some of them to make ice cream sandwiches.  We used two peanut butter cookies and put chocholate ice cream inbetween..mmmmmm....so good.  We'll definitely make these again.

Delicious. I chopped the peanuts up very fine and liked the addition of them to the cookie. I really need to hurry up and get these out of my house because I am eating them ALL :D I used a natural peanut butter from Trader Joe's and it was quite good in these.

Thanks so much for this recipe.  We made this for the first time and entered them in our local county fair.  My daughter won 3rd place! Followed recipe exactly and used dry roasted and salted peanuts chopped up.  This was the only one she won out of 4 entries in other categories!!!

Excellent cookie!  I used another's suggestion and incorporated extra crunchy peanut butter, instead of the peanuts and they had just the right amount in them.  I cooked them for 12.5 minutes exactly and got a great cookie, not too soft but not hard.  The only thing that was trying was that because the dough is so moist the tines of the fork want to stick badly and not imprint.  I had to use just a little flour to help out with that--no prblem.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Perfect! I had to reduce the cooking time (i learned the hard way) but they turned out so well!!! The problem i've consistantly had in the past is my peanutbutter cookies are never quite peanut-buttery  enough but these cookies were flawless! Thank you so much! I will deffinatly be making these again (and again and again)

I have been trying to find a great peanut butter cookie recipe and this is it. The cookie is incredibly peanut buttery without being *too* overwhelming. They baked up perfectly and taste delicious. I think next time I'll add a few peanut butter chips or chopped up peanut butter cups. I think these cookies are awesome.

Made the cookies at 6 AM this morning for a party I'm having tonight (kids will be here)  Although they came out perfect, something seems to be missing.  It could just be me, I'm a cook (by trade) not a baker.  Thank you.

Didn't change a thing.  They are great, maybe next time I would leave out the peanuts or just use chunky peanut butter.  I will make these again.

A very excellent recipe!  I used crunchy peanut butter to elimnate work of chopping peanuts.  Cookies were soft and chewy -- yes, oven time varies -- mine came out perfect after 12 min. Soft and flavorful! Brought them to work - the guys loved 'em!

This is a wonderful peanut butter cookie recipe.  It is SO good!  I added about 1 cup chocolate chips to it so each cookie has a little bite of chocolate.  YUM-O!

This is the best recipe for peanut butter cookies EVER. I am not the best at getting things to turn out--at all.  Most times, things don't.  But this was great!!  I used reduced fat crunchy peanut butter instead of the peanuts, and chilled the dough for two hours.  I rolled the dough into balls slightly smalled than a ping pong ball, rolled them in sugar, and baked them for 15 minutes.  They turned out to be giant and chewy, like the kind you'd buy at a bakery.  Don't hesitate to try this recipe!!

This truly is the best peanut butter cookie recipe I have ever tried.  I used to use the Mrs. Sigg's recipe, but the cookies often came out slightly dry and crumbly.  These really are best undercooked, but even the slightly golden brown ones are great.  I did't use the chopped peanuts, but added Hershey's kisses to some, chocolate chips to others and left the rest plain, and they were all delicious.  Thanks Kevin!

I just got the recipe, and I will make them this afternoon. I can't wait, they sound really good and like a no fail cookie recipe.
I have faith that they will be awesome, lol. 
Great Reviews.

Delicious cookies!  I used margerine, chunky peanut butter and did not refrigerate.  I patted my hands in flour as I rolled to keep the dough from sticking.  Quick, easy and delicious!

These were nice, soft cookies IF underbaked as suggested. Even after chilling the dough all day it was extremely sticky. Definitely had to wash hands after each tray! :)

I agree this is the best Peanut butter cookie.  I used Laura Scudders natural peanut butter.  The extra oils in in made them even more moist.

Seriously the best cookie recipe I have ever made. My husband loves these!! The peanut butter flavor is so fantastic. Definately do not cook longer than 12 minutes unless you like a crunchier cookie. Woo Hoo!

These cookies were ok but not as good as I thought from reading the reviews.  I tried all different cooking times but just couldn't get a cookie that was cooked just right they were either too hard or too uncooked.  Will keep looking.

The cookies formed beautifully and had a peanutty taste (used crunchy pb instead of creamy & omitted the chopped nuts). However, still looking for that chewy consistency (with crisp edges) like a choc chip cookie...if that's possible.

These cookies are soooo good. I also did not add the peanuts, just used 18 oz of extra chunky PB. I also added an 11.5 oz bag of Ghirardelli milk chocolate chips. Yummmmmm.. Just like a baked Reese's cup.(Note-after using Ghirardelli chips, I will never go back to the "other" brand). Thanks so much for this cookie recipe.

I was skeptical about this recipe because of some of the reviews.  Tried the recipe out, only cooked the cookies for 12 minutes.  Moist the next day.  My daughter said they were the best peanut butter cookies she ever had.  Didn't add peanuts, but rather, took another's advice and used chunky peanut butter.  Thanks.

Really great cookies -- I accidently used only a 1/2 cup of butter and they were still rich and delicious -- super peanut buttery.  They were a hit.

Delicious!  These are the peanut butter cookies I was looking for.  Instead of adding chopped peanuts I used half a jar of chunky peanut butter and half a jar of creamy.  It worked well, and the peanut haters in my house didn't complain.  I will definately be making these again.

These cookies were good...but not great. They were somewhat moist...but I was expecting a bit more based on other reviews. Family and friends weren't wowed by them, and many asked what happened to my old recipe.

Before trying this recipe I read a few of the reviews and so many thought this was "the best" peanut butter cookie.  I made them this weekend and... RIGHT ON.  Truly the best we've ever had.  I think the reason is that the brown sugar adds such a good flavor to the peanut butter and is what makes them so chewy.  Thank you Kevin.

If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars I would. I have never made or tasted such delicious soft peanut butter cookies.  If you buy the Skippy Extra Crunchy Peanut Butter you don't need to add the 1 cup of chopped peanuts.  There are plenty of nuts.  I have thrown away all of my other peanut butter recipes.  You will too.  Try this one it's fantastic.

I would give these 6 stars if I could! I made them per the recipe, except for the extra peanuts, and they were great! I used a medium sized cookie scoop and dipped the fork in sugar (I like the gitter of sugar on pb cookies). Putting the dough back in the fridge between sheets is helpful. These demand a large glass of milk! YUMMY!

These are awesome! When I read the recipe, I was afraid that a whole jar of peanut butter would be too overwhelming, but I was wrong. Great flavor, great texture - chewy and moist! I made another batch with semi-sweet chocolate chips - delicious!

These were a huge hit with my family.  I used what peanuts we had on hand.  I used 1/4c of regular peanuts and 1/3c of honey roasted.  We all agreed the honey roasted made them especially tasty.  I baked mine for 13 minutes.

Yummy!! I have made this twice and they are GREAT!! My husband is a peanut butter lover and he loved them. I added half a bag of chocolate chips and that made them even better!! I cooked them for 10-11 minutes to keep them soft and chewy. This recipe is a keeper.

I'm a peanut butter lover, and these cookies are great! I normally use 1 cup of pb in my cookies, so naturally this recipe looked interesting. For some reason they get crunchy when I put them in an air tight container, but they usually don't make it that far anyway. This recipe is a keeper!

These cookies are a must for ANY and ALL peanut butter lovers!  I hate making pb cookies to me they are messy and just annoying to make.  However, these cookies are worth being annoyed.  They are rich and full of flavor.  It is dreamy!  I don't like making cookies that all taste the same.  when you go to the trouble of finding a new recipe.. i want a different taste.  5 STARS THESE ARE WORTH THE EFFORT!  LOVE THEM!
