This is almost identical to a recipe that I love.  The only difference is that in my recipe you add 1/3 of a cup of chicken broth with the lemon juice to the pan drippings.  This helps to add the needed liquid for the sauce.  This is a fast, delicious recipe that the whole family likes.

My wife loved this take on a delicious dish. Mince onion, garlic and jalepeno, add the dry ingredients called for in this dish to form a wet paste. Rub generous amounts under the skin. Outer skin is salted, rubbed with some mixture.  Broil in oven until skin gets nice and crispy (5-7 min) switch oven to bake 350 until done (approx 40 min). About half way through squeeze lime juice on chicken.

I will make this easy recipe again but with some changes. I loved the spice mixture but it wasn't enough to adequately cover/rub four breasts so I had make another batch. Also, way, way, WAY too much garlic powder at the end. It overpowered the other flavors, especially the lime.  I will reduce the amount of garlic powder and double the other ingredients in the future.

This recipe is five stars as written, but to spice it up, I doubled the spice mixture, increased the cayenne pepper to 1/2 tsp.  Right before finishing the "sauce" I added 1/2 cup of chicken broth per another reviewers suggetion, a "turn" of margarita mix, a splash of tequila, 1.5 tbs of honey and let bubble for two plus minutes.  Perfect mix of sweet and spice!!!

Love the spicy little kick this chicken has to offer.  I did have to double the butter and lime juice in order to have enough sauce to spoon over the top.  I also pounded the brests thinner to avoid that "too chickeny" taste.  This is a keeper!

This was good but needed some help.  First of all, do cut chicken breasts into pieces & pound thin.  Second, don't double the lime juice unless you want it sour.  Use 3 TBLSP first (juice of one small lime) and then taste-test the sauce, then adjust as needed.  The sauce also could benefit from a little chicken broth added when you put in the lime juice.

This recipe just replaced my old Lime Chicken recipe.  It was wonderful!  So simple and easy, too.  I fixed the marinade in the morning, bumped up the heat-factor a little, used fresh cilantro from my garden (made all the difference) and threw it in a bag along with the juice of a couple limes.  I marinated it all afternoon and then threw it on the grill.  While grilling, I coated it with coarse ground pepper and squeezed fresh lime juice on each side.  Definitly a keeper!  My husband was disappointed he was travelling the next day and couldn't take the leftovers for lunch.  Instead, I sliced up the cold chicken and served it on a salad.  MMMMMMmmmmmm-good!  Thanks for the recipe!

OMG! What can I add to everything that has been said before? I couldn't wait to get on here to review this recipe! Fabulous combination of flavors and just enough spice to get you going. It tasted like a restaurant meal.

I didn't change the ingredients at all -- simply doubled the spice rub because I wanted a more intense flavor.

I made only the slightest change to the directions - using a foolproof technique I learned with pork chops. I put the spice rub on the chicken about three hours before cooking. Then 30 minutes before cooking I took the chicken out of the fridge and let it "rest."

After browning, I removed the chicken, deglazed the pan with the lime juice, returned the breasts for a few minutes, then covered the pan, turned off the heat and let everything "rest" again for about 10 minutes. 

The two "resting periods" make pork chops (and chicken breasts) come out both well cooked and very moist and delicious.

This is a keeper, and I can't wait to make it again!!!

I'm scratching my head over the glowing reviews. To my palate garlic powder tastes nothing at all like garlic! To me, the flavor is plain nasty. I can't understand why anyone would use a  fake-tasting product when the real thing is both inexpensive and readily available. If you want to make this dish worlds better, mash 3-4 garlic cloves to a paste. Apply to the chicken with the spices. For the sauce, mash another clove or two of garlic (or to taste) and replace that awful powder. Infinitely superior, fresh, and tasty. Try it this way - you won't believe the difference!

This was very good. Very easy. I made a couple adjustments; I halved the hot pepper- was still very zippy. I added 3 Tablespoons chicken broth. I covered it at the end, and had to cook it more like 12 min, not 5min, but the breasts I used were very thick. I think I might pound them a bit next time. All in all this recipe rocks. It was so quick and easy.

I made it just as stated in the recipe, and it turned out fantasmic!  I did as some of the other readers suggested, and doubled the amounts on the spices, and it was enough to cover 4 skinless chicken breasts from Trader Joes.  We also had the black bean / couscous salad on this site, and it was a fabulous combination.  Not a bit left for leftovers.  

One note....Several people have commented on the sauce, and using real garlic in place of garlic powder.  It seems that will prevent the sauce from setting up.  My sauce was golden, and very smooth with a creamy texture, using the garlic powder.

I wouldn't change a thing other than the spices being doubled up for complete coverage of the breasts...otherwise, the spices may be sort of sparse!

This dish was very flavorful and tasty.  I didn't even really measure out the spices- I just used more of what we like and less of what we're not crazy about.  I served it with white rice and used the sauce over the rice.  I also saved the extra lime juice and poured it over the chicken and rice.  I recommend using more than 3 TBS of lime juice.

I like to use this recipe to make quick chicken soft tacos. I will usually double all the ingredients EXCEPT the salt and I omit the butter. If you mix all the ingredients together in the morning and marinate the chicken in the spices/liquid all day, you get a more flavorful end result.

Five stars for the ingredients & flavor, even though I prepared it my own way: Made the spice rub in the morning using 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 tsp. salt & 1/8 tsp. cayenne (other spices as written). Rubbed this all over & under the skin of 4 chicken thighs & refrigerated all day. Later I combined the butter, oil, 1 clove minced garlic, lime juice & 1/3 cup chicken broth in a saucepan & let it simmer for a while to create a basting sauce. We grilled the chicken & when it was almost done we began to baste it with most of the "garlic-lime sauce" & saved a bit to pour over the top when serving. Everyone loved it, chicken stayed juicy & was full of flavor from the spice rub, then the lime sauce added a nice lift. Served with "Green Rice II" from this site for a pleasing meal! ;p

Delicious outcome, but who wants to get out eight spice bottles and measure such tiny amounts every time you cook.  I'll definitely make this again and again, so I mixed up a batch of the spice mix and have it available in a shaker for next time.  I may even put it on some other meats like hamburgers, steaks, and pork chops.

I didn't have any chicken in the freezer, so I used boneless pork tenderloins instead. My husband and I loved it! It made beautiful, golden brown pork chops. A hint when using with pork: omit the salt.

I followed the recipe exactly and this chicken came out quite well. As other reviewers mentioned, you may have to double the spices to cover 4 pieces of chicken well. It depends on how spicy you'd like it. If you want more of a kick, I would double them for sure. The best thing about this recipe is that it's so quick and easy. I was worried about overcooking, so I lowered the temp a bit and covered the pan to keep it nice and juicy. When it was done, the chicken had a slight crust to it which was nice, but it stayed juicy in the center. If you don't watch this carefully, I could see how this could become a bit dry. I also used freshly squeezed lime juice (took 1.5 limes). Boyfriend approved, will make this again for sure.

Funny this should be the featured recipe today because I just prepared it yesterday. It is awesome and can be cooked in the oven. I followed baking advise from another reviewer (jsecret) and it was great for easy clean-up. Otherwise followed it as is written and it was soooo good. Will definitely be making again.

I have made this several times and it is consistently a hit!  The only thing I do is after the chicken is done, i put a pan full of fresh spinach in the pan, cover andcook until wilted.  It is great with all the spices on it and makes a quick side.

We loved this recipe!  I do add chicken broth - maybe 1/4 cup - at the end to give it some more flavor.  Try this - let the chicken and sauce cool a bit, and use it to top a green salad, using the sauce on your salad as a dressing.  It's great!  I'm on Weight Watchers, and this is a really great recipe.

This is a great tasting dish that works well with my preferences for healthy food and my husband's particular tastes.  Very few dishes have the distinction of making his list of favorite meals and this is one of them.  I just made this chicken again tonight, and my husband spent the whole dinner raving about the flavor and saying "wow!" every few minutes.  This is truly a keeper and well-deserved five stars from me and the husband.  The only changes I made were cooking with virgin coconut oil (healthier than butter and olive oil, and goes well with the lime), using fresh garlic, and adding 1/4 chicken stock to increase the amount of sauce.  I served it with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.  It also reheats well, which makes it an ideal lunch to bring to work.

Made recipe as is and do not taste the "spicy" in this one.  It tasted more like too much lime and salt.  So, I would suggest cutting back on the lime and salt and add more cayenne for spice to suit your level of spiciness.  Besides, when it is done and if you think it needs more salt, you can always add more to taste. This recipe for chicken also had a slightly bitter taste to it, and perhaps it would be better to use some fresh garlic, chopped or minced (whichever you prefer), and chopped onion-sauteing the garlic and onion first before adding the chicken to the pan.

This was so good and so easy! I baked mine in the oven for 40 mins at 425, I pre-heated my pan then put my chicken (I used quarters) skin side down so it crisped up nicely. At about 20 min I squeezed a whole lime over it than flipped and back in the oven. When it was done I squeezed half a lime over it. YUMMY!

This turned out very good despite all the alterations I made for the Indian palate: 

1. I doubled (or tripled?!) the spices. I used regular roasted red chili flakes instead of  paprika. I also let the spice marinade sit for about 6 hours in the fridge.
2. Next time I would definitely use smaller pieces of chicken or would flatten the breasts before cooking. 
3. I used almost 6 tablespoons of some awful Lemon concentrate (Lemoneeze) instead of the lime-- half in the marinade and half while cooking. 
4. As per some other reviewers, I used about 1/8 cup of tequila for some extra kick. With the lemon it really made the chicken nice and tangy. Mmm..
5. I added water to cook the chicken at the end but next time I would use broth or stock to bulk up on the gravy which was quite yummy but not really enough to 'spoon over' the chicken. The key is to get the chicken to cook faster without absorbing all the  sauce. 
6. I put in about 8 split cloves of garlic into the butter/olive oil mix at the beginning and skipped the powder. 

I would definitely make this again!

This had great flavor. I used the full amount of seasoning for two breasts, and I would think that any less wouldn't have been enough. For health reasons, I did not use the full amount of butter, and eye-balled the olive oil, but I added a little broth when I added the lime. I also made a gravy out of the sauce by whisking in a tablespoon each of flour and water after removing the chicken. My two big criticisms are 1) that the required amount of garlic powder at the end would have been way too much, and 2) maybe it's just my stove, but the cooking time was too long. I only cooked it for about 12 minutes total, and our chicken was dry. So I'll use the recipe again, but will use my judgment with the spice levels and cooking time.

Great recipe. My limes didn't have much juice, so I had to add some lemon juice as well (I used 4T total of this mixture instead of 3), but otherwise I followed the recipe as written. The flavor was excellent, the chicken perfectly done and moist. Spicy but not overpowering. My son has asked me to make sure I make this dish again, and I definitely will.

I followed the recipe exactly except when I added the lime juice, I also added about 1/2 a cup of chicken broth.  I then let it simmer down to a wonderfully intense reduction that coated the chicken nicely. Topped with a little lime zest... Awesome, delicious and not too spicy!

Just a fun little tip I thought I would share with everyone!  I make this without the lime every time now because of our taste preference, and last time I made it, I took the left over chicken breast and chopped it up with a little onion and mayo and it made some amazing spicy chicken salad!  Just thought I would share a little tip for using leftovers!

So easy and so wonderful!! I made extra rub to really rub all over the chicken and I added a little extra of the olive oil, butter, and lime- then made pasta and added some of the starchy water to thicken it up to enjoy it even more.

This turned out Great! I used chicken tenderloins (10 or so), they are the perfect size, thickness and are perfect for this dish. Doubled the spice mixture due to quantity of chicken. I used more olive oil because i believe a dish like this should NOT be cooked in a non stick skillet, I wanted good browning without fear of burning. Followed as written otherwise until the end, I thought 3 cloves of real minced garlic sounded better than sprinkling garlic powder, browned a few minutes then added the lime juice! Perfect, but we love garlic and it's soooo good for you. YUM! This reminded me of Red Lobsters cajun chicken linguini dish, same flavor. We'll be making this again for sure.

Excellent combination of spices and flavors-as one reviewer recommended, I'm going to add chicken broth with lime juice for more sauce.  Thanks for a great variation of chicken, C. Perez!

This was really good. I used cooking spray instead of the oil and butter to cut the fat. I also added about 1/2 t. of Splenda with the lime juice. I think it was a great addition. This turned out really great. I'll use this recipe often, I'm sure.

TERRIFIC, unique, flavor and not too hot (for us). Next time, I would change 4 things, however.  I will use thinner (either pounded or cutlets)breasts, or tenders, or cut the breast into strips. Even though I marinated a few hours, the flavor didn't pentrate the thick chicken breasts. Also, would prefer SEARING on MED-HIGH heat (instead of the slower browning on medium as recipe instructs)and then finishing at med heat. Will also use the suggestions of FRESH minced garlic and adding a little chicken broth.
Think it would be 5 star, with changes.

I thought this was just ok.  I added some flour to the spices because I thought it would be too spicy otherwise for my kids.  They enjoyed it, so I guess that worked.  I forgot to add the tequila to the sauce at the end as someone suggested, so next time I will try that.  I'll make it again.

SUPER RECIPE!!

I used 1 tablespoon black pepper, 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1 teaspoon paprika and TRIPLE the Lime juice (I freshly juiced the limes myself).  This recipe has won BEST recipe ever from Allrecipes by my partner and my roommate.  I also cut the chicken breasts into large chunks (one to two bite size) and I added about 10 whole garlic cloves to the frying pan that I removed when the chicken was done and my partner and roommate put the cooked garlic on their plates and ate it with their chicken...  I served this with white rice and a salad.  Great taste!

We loved this, really moist with a little kick. I used real garlic with the lime juice, & used all ingredients as listed for only 2 breasts, & it was perfect. We served it with potatoes, mashed with sour cream & green onion stired in & fresh green beans. Yum, we will definately be making this again.

Excellent taste!  I did use fresh garlic, chopped onion and sliced the lime peel and added to the sauce along w/3 Tbls of chicken broth as others suggested.  Will definately double sauce next time. Thanks for sharing.
ATTN:  Just an added note--just reheated the leftovers today-- the lime peel tasted much too strong.  Next time I make this recipe I will probably leave out the lime peel.

Delicious. We doubled the spice mixture, used the same amount of butter/olive oil and lime juice, but instead of additional garlic powder I used fresh cilantro from the garden. The doubled spice mixture was a bit too salty for our liking, so next time I would double all the spices but cut the salt by at least half if not a bit more. We had this with roasted broccoli and baked potatoes and will definitely have it again. It was spicy and tangy with the perfect amount of lime for us.

Made by my son, Matthew (14), as part of a Health class project. He says: "I really like spicy food and I really like chicken, so I said "hey, sounds like a deal to me!" Also it was one of the best chicken entrees I've had." I say: I've been meaning to make this for a while and it looked pretty easy to make and like something Matthew would enjoy. It was even better than I expected, and will definitely make again - with his help. Thanks for the recipe!!

WOW!  Where's this recipe been all my life?!  I'd give this one more stars if I could.  I had something similar to this in a restaurant once and always wanted to find a recipe like it.  I followed exact directions for cooking the chicken.  However, after the chicken was done, I added a little water to the pan and scraped the pan to get all the stuff off the pan and then reduced it a little and added a some flour water to thicken it.  I poured the sauce over the chicken and rice.  It was fabulous!

Loved it! We made 6 chicken breasts, so I went ahead and doubled the "sauce" for the rice. Based on some of the reviews, instead of just sprinkling the spices on, I rubbed them on about an hour before cooking. Also, I used fresh garlic (3) and onion (green, finely chopped), and added half to the olive oil and half to the sauce. To the sauce I added about 2 tablespoons of honey. Perfect.

Simple recipe and preparation. Cooking in the skillet requires some real dedication in order to maintain the moisture of the poultry. Especially of note when making this recipe: make sure that the stove is set to a medium temperature when coating the chicken in the lime-garlic mixture. If not, the mixture may boil quickly and not properly flavor the chicken. Good find!

This is one of my favorite dishes! I ALWAYS cut the chicken breasts into small, bite size pieces and toss them into the spice mixture. This just gives each little bite A LOT of flavor. I am not a fan of lime juice, so I use lemon juice instead. If you add some chicken broth and cornstarch to the pan after the chicken is cooked, you will get a nice creamy sauce. This is FANTASTIC served over brown or wild rice. I make this often, and always receive a lot of compliments. Thank you for this recipe!

Meh. I chose this recipe because I had a lime and some cilantro I needed to get rid of. First, there wasn't anywhere near enough of the rub. The cooking time was also quite off, so by the time the breasts were cooked, the seasoning had charred, which wasn't necessarily bad, but there wasn't enough flavor to carry it.  Better bet to marinade it for a while first, use some fresh ingredients instead of everything powdered, and double the seasonings (maybe not the peppers, depending on your tastes).  Concept is good, but needs a major upgrade.

This was really good - lots of flavor. The rub was enough for three chicken breasts and I only used 1.5 T of olive oil (no butter) to saute them in. I also cut back on the garlic powder at the end as that seemed like a lot to me.

The cooking method I used was almost entirely different but I don't think that mattered, the flavors were still the same. I combined all of the spices, 4 tbsp lime juice instead of just 3, and two finely chopped garlic cloves instead of garlic powder in a bowl and let the chicken breasts marinade for a good 2-3 hours. Then I grilled them outside on a gas grill. It was so delicious, totally hit the spot for me. So aromatic and savory from the spices and a little tangy from the limes!

I would use more EVOO and less butter while sauteeing as the butter burned a bit, obscuring the spices.  I would also recommend that it be cooked lower than medium heat.

This was a very easy dinner to make. I could barely taste the lime so next time I will add a little lime zest to the spice mixture at the begining. I'll also use a sifter or some sort of shaker to put the garlic powder on at the end, since it was very STRONG where it glopped on. We had it with brown rice and corn. I gave my kids the chicken that didn't have a lot of spice on it and they liked it!

Sounded like a great recipe until I was done with the spice rub, it was not enough to coat 2 pieces of chicken and I had updated the recipe for 6 servings. if I decide to remake this recipe I'd probably have to make it for 20 serving just to get enough spice..

Simple little chicken recipe that uses a potent and flavorful spice blend for a zesty taste. It was quick to prepare but I slightly adjusted the garlic content. I increased the initial garlic powder amount from ¼ tsp to ½ tsp. However, the 2 teaspoons of garlic powder called for at the end was omitted as some reviewers mentioned that it was a bit over powering. The chicken was also pounded for quicker cooking. This was going to be served with rice so a ½ cup of chicken broth was added at the end to create a sauce. Cilantro paired well with these flavors.

I tried this recipe for a Sunday dish. It's amazing and my friends from China really love it! However, don't over-cook the chicken (a little less than the recipe is okay), as it may become dry and less tasty! Another change I made is adding chopped pineapple while serving. That makes it perfect!

This recipe is pretty good, but I prefer to omit the parsley and adds 1/3 cup of chicken broth at the end.  The addition of the broth adds more sauce to the dish.  I mix up a big batch of the seasoning mix ahead of time which makes it even easier to get dinner on the table quickly after a busy day.

Delicious!  Took another reviewer's advice and added chicken stock to the pan, after letting the outside cook in the olive oil, then covered with a lid and let cook on low until done.  Used twice as much spice as called for - it definitely needed it.

Awesome! One of our favorite dinners! :) I like to double all of the spices and bread the chicken in Panko breadcrumbs before frying or baking. We didn't add the extra garlic at the end because it had plenty. Totally recommend!

Looking for a quick dish to throw together on a busy weeknight, I happened to find this gem of a recipe. I added a bit of crushed red pepper to the spices and a bit of chicken broth while sautéing per other reviews. My husband raved over this. Placed the chicken over a rice dish (in pyrex) I threw together and poured the sauce over everything. Baked at 350 for 15 minutes. Thank you so much for this recipe C.Perez!

I would love to give this recipe 5 stars, but my entire apartment filled up with smoke while making this, so I just can't. I realize I should've known better than to prepare chicken breast in a skillet, but you live, you learn. Anyway, definitely take the advice of other reviewers and BAKE the chicken in the oven. The flavor of the spices was delicious, but I also needed to double the recipe in order to have enough to cover the chicken. Also, I would probably decrease the salt next time. If you don't care about filling your whole house with smoke, my chicken came out pretty dry after following the recipe's recommended cook time for chicken breasts cut in half, so I would suggest decreasing that as well. Bottom line: great combination of spices, but best cooked in the oven!

This is seriously amazing!  I doubled the rub because it definitely was not enough. I left the rub on the chicken for an hour before actually cooking them and it was a hit with my family!  This one will definitely be on regular rotation.

Excellent! Add in 1-2 tablespoons red pepper for a spicier recipe. Also, after reading reviews, I cooked the sauce with a couple tablespoons tequila, and it was delicious...and went very well with margaritas and baked potatoes. I've also used it as a topping for chicken tacos/burritos, and that was truly great as well; it would probably be equally good over salad.

I was trying to find some healthy recipes and made this tonight and was very happy with the results.  I substituted the garlic powder for fresh garlic and rubbed into the chicken with the olive oil prior to sprinkling on the spices.  I let it marinate for about 25 minutes before cooking.  Thanks so much for the easy and delicious mid-week meal idea

Yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly, but added asparagus at the end.  Oh my gosh, it was delish!  Will definitely make again, except maybe pound the chicken thinner.

This recipe is just gorgeous, I made it recently when I substituted the chicken for prawns and served it as a starter,  I also added 1/2 tsp of freshly grated ginger and same of garlic (in addition to the garlic powder in the recipe) and all my guests raved about it.  I've gotten about 4 e-mails now asking me for the recipe.  Such an easy recipe to make (even for a novice like me!) and it is absolutely scrummy! :-)

I altered this a bit.  First, I chopped some fresh cilantro and one clove of garlic, added the dry spices and seasonings (minus the garlic powder) and a couple of tablespoons of olive oil.  Cooked the chicken as directed, then removed the chicken and deglazed my pan with lime juice and 1/2 c of chicken broth (skipped the garlic powder).  I allowed that to reduce and then returned the chicken to the pan to warm it again.  It was light and delicious!  Went very well with Cilantro Lime Rice from this site.

This went over well here. It was very flavorful as the garlic and lime did well to coat the chicken. I used chili pepper instead of cayenne pepper as my wife doesn't like too much heat. Oh yeah, I took someone else's advice and pounded the breasts a little. I think that helped a lot.

Not as lime-y as I had hoped, but quite good.  I left out the butter and just used the olive oil, to make it a bit healthier. I'd just add more lime juice and an extra last minute dusting of black pepper.

Excellent spice mix, I love the idea of making a jar-full and shaking it on.

However, next time, I'll 1/2 the lime - we all found it a wee bit too much

Excellent flavor, healthy, the chicken stayed moist and it was easy.  I dipped the chicken in a little olive oil before putting on the seasonings and omitted the rest of the butter and oil.  We cooked it on the grill and basted it with the garlic powder and lime juice mixture.  Will definitely make again.

Great recipe! Next time though I will double the seasonings for the chicken, I had 3 boneless skinless breasts and they almost didn't cover them all the way. 

I pound out the breasts also to make them more of the same size from end to end. Served with rice and steamed vegetables. Husband said it was great and very juicy.

I had large, thick pieces of chicken, so I used extra oil (about 3-4 tbsp) to avoid the pan drying out. It worked great. After cooking them in the skillet, I stuck them in a 350-degree oven for about 10 minutes while I was waiting for my grilled veggies to finish, and they came out perfectly done and so moist! I'll definitely be using this recipe again.

Okay; everyone LOVED this recipe.  Even the picky eaters.  The lime juice makes a big difference.  I thawed the cubes of juice I had left from my lime tree from summer juicing.  I agree with others in that more spices is better; about 50% more.  I basically rubbed it on.  It's best to dry the chicken a bit too by using paper towels if it's in juice from thawing or package.  Addition: made second time and had to check to make sure I gave it 5 stars.  OMG!  Best chicken recipe!  We love the flavors so much!  Drizzling extra juice onto rice served with it is wonderful.

Love it!! Mine ended up very salty, so next time I'll use less salt. I followed the directions exactly as far as the first dry rub part of the ingredients, and it turned out to be the perfect amount for two pieces of chicken. Two very flavorful pieces of chicken!

Love this recipe! I like to cut the chicken breast into strips and cook with all of the spice mixture instead of sprinkling it on.  Very Good!  Thanks C. Perez!!

The spices were good, but the salt was way over the top. If I made this again, I would cut the salt at least in half.

Very nice with a good "kick".  Probably not at the top of our chicken list though.

After reading reviews, I wasn't sure if this recipe needed more spices or just more coating so I added a tablespoon of flour to the spices.  It needs more spices, not flour.  It was very subtle.  Very.  Not bad at all, but not wowing either.  I didn't do the additional garlic on top, but added more to the spice blend.  All amounts the same except for reducing the thyme to 1/8t & increasing garlic to 1/2t.  I used half cup chicken broth & 2T lime juice for the sauce - thickened it with a T flour.  Only E liked the sauce & not a lot at that.  It wasn't bad either, just not any big deal.  I doubt I'll make it again.  'Worth trying, but be sure to increase the spices.  Oh, & if you want spicy hot, you'll have to really increase the hot spices.  This is more liked spiced, not spicy.

This dish turned out super tender AND fully cooked!  I halved the recipe and only cooked the chicken for about four minutes per side (rather than the six suggested).  Also, completely by accident, I added about 3x the amount of olive oil (Tbs vs. tsp mistake) but it turned out really well and I will repeat this next time I make it.  My husband suggested drizzling ranch over the finished product, and it took this solid four-star dish up to five-stars.  We really enjoyed the meal, and it was quick and easy to make.  Plus, only one pan to clean up!

This was good chicken, but I guess I was expecting WOW.  I cut the chicken up and sauteed it in the spices and lime juice.  I used the juice of one large lime and it wasn't too limey at all.  I served it over baby spinach and veggies.  The sauce made a nice "dressing" for the salad.  Next time, I think I'll grill it to give it a bit more carmelized flavor.   Thanks for sharing your recipe, C. Perez.

This was fabulous. I didn't change the spices. They were great. The only thing I did different was combine the lime juice, garlic powder and 3/4 cup of chicken stock at the end to create enough sauce. Simple recipe, quick and easy. My husband couldn't stop complimenting me all night.

I doubled everything for the rub, since some people said it wasn't enough. It was very, very flavorful. I meant to add chicken broth to the final sauce, but forgot. It would have thinned it out a bit, so I wish I had.   Hubby's only complaints were (a) chicken was a bit dry, and (b) he wished I had used boneless thighs, as he's not really white meat person. I think that the cooking times were too much for the chicken that I used - 3 breasts, each cut in half and tenderized slightly. Should have seen that coming, not the recipe's fault.  In general, very good and flavorful. Good to serve with rice and a veggie. Will make again.

This is sooo good.  I did not measure spices, I just sprinkled them on each piece of chicken and rubbed it in.  Used lemon juice instead of lime (did  not have) and it was great.  My husband loved it.  This is a keeper.

OK.....so I read all the reviews and decided to take action on what others had done!!!  I followed the recipe until the end and then I added a little tequila to the pan-juice and then added 1/4 cup of cream.  Oh my gosh......

This is a wonderful recipe.  I added just a little more cayenne because we are a spicy family....anywho, i used thick chicken breast, so i cooked covered until cooked through to avoid the outside getting browned to fast, then uncovered and let brown.  Careful, this chicken can easily go from nicely browned to blackened because of the seasonings so watch toward the end.  The lime was a great touch, thanks for the recipe!

I used the suggestion by another reviewer. I pounded the chicken to be flatter so there were not large sections of chicken without the sauce. It was wonderful.  I plan on making this again.

This had great flavor!  I used only 2 chicken breasts, but kept everything the same except for the second dose of garlic powder (just sprinkled it on, didn't measure).  I used key lime juice and it was so tasty and tangy.  Great blend of spices/herbs.  My chicken turned out very tender also.  I had leftover mashed potatoes, so I served it with those, but it would have been better with rice.  Also served with corn and a sliced avocado on the side.  Oh, my butter/olive oil turned brown really fast (old stove) but it turned out to be ok.  Still tasted great.

This recipe has been sitting in my recipe box for a while and I wish I had made it sooner.  It is so easy and delicious.  I seasoned both sides of the chicken, baked it for 30 mins, added the extra garlic powder and lime juice, and baked for another 5 minutes.  I may cut back on the salt a bit next go around.

This came out great! I followed the recipe almost exactly, only I grilled the chicken instead of pan frying. I didn't use any of the oil or butter, either. The chicken was incredibly juicy and had a great flavor. I will definitely make again. Thanks!

WOW! This was fabulous! I added a little extra cayenne, because we like it spicy, & used about 4 tablespoons of lime, but other than that, left it the same. We really liked this one. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

I read your reviews & decided to cut my chicken into 1" chunks. Then I put your spices into a gallon bag and then shook them up good, added the chicken chunks & shook for about 5-10 mins.. Then I did as your recipe called for & it turned out excellent! Thank you

We enjoyed this very much. I did alter the recipe a little bit. My limes were dry but I used what I had and between pulp and juice it was about 1/2 cup of stuff. I omitted the butter and used 1/4-1/2 cup of olive oil and I invited 2 tbls. of jose cuervo to the party. I marinated over night and grilled 24 hrs later. The base recipe was going to be really good but we like our food really zesty so I had to adapt. My daughter had seconds which is always the sign of a "keeper".

Oh my this was a hit! My roommates love Mexican but we always made it with ground beef. I wanted to try something on the more healthy side so I found this recipe and put a twist on it. Followed the directions until the last 10min of cooking. Took all the chicken off and cut it into cubes, some was still raw and this is ok. Put it back into the pan, added some water for moisture and sautéed for another 10 minutes. Came out wonderful and perfect for tacos, or taco salad as I had it with. Mixed with the Mexican quinoa recipe instead of rice and it was a hit!

This was a great recipe. However, I changed it slightly by doubling the cayenne pepper in the dry rub. In the sauce I added chopped onions and used minced garlic (1-2 tbs depends on your preference of garlic; I love garlic so I used 2 tbs)instead of garlic powder. Also, I cut my half chicken breast in half so it was about 1/2 inch thick, and would not burn the outside of the chicken when cooking. I also did not have any lime, but had a bunch of fresh lemons a friend gave me and substituted the lemon for the lime and still came out fantastic! The dry rub has an excellent flavor and my husband enjoyed it very much as well. I served it with rice and steamed vegetables (broccoli, bell peppers and carrots).

This was really delicious but for our tastes, I'll leave the butter out and just use the lime and oil for a warm vinaigrette next time. We had yellow rice and black beans for the sides and everything played well together. :o)

This recipe was fantastic. All my family loved it. The only change I made was that I used fresh garlic in place of the garlic powder. I diced 2 garlic cloves and made those into a paste. I put the paste on the chicken before the spices. Also, for the sauce I used fresh garlic too.  Delicious!!!!!!   Thank you for the recipe.

We absolutely love love love this recipe! I follow it exactly, but only using 3 chicken breasts so I can slice them horizontally and sprinkle a little bit of spice mix inside the meat. There is usually just enough "sauce" to jazz up some rice on the side. Dinner is just hubby and me, so the third breast becomes the next day's lunch: either in a wrap or chopped up on a salad. Yum!

For those of you unsure of what to do with all of the varying reviews- I made the recipe exactly as written, except I added 1/2 tsp. of cilantro because it goes so well with lime. It was great.

The flavor was amazing!!! However, I found that I needed WAY more of the season mixture. I also added chicken broth to the mix, and cut my chicken into smaller pieces. The flavor was great!!

Very good chicken. The only thing is that this recipe calls for way too much salt. Next time, I'll be using 1/4 tsp instead of 3/4

I LOVE this recipe--4 stars only because I modify it slightly. First, I double the ratio of spice mixture to chicken and I make sure to sprinkle both sides of the breasts. When cooking the chicken, I omit the butter and just pour the lime juice over the top of each side of the chicken. My favorite quick chicken dish, no question.

Great recipe! I added about 1/4 c. of chicken broth to deglaze the pan and fresh cilantro. My husband gave it rave reviews and wants me to add this recipe to the list of his favorites!

I can't think of one thing that could be better with this dish. I struggle with finding a good recipe involving chicken. This is one of my favorite--it not my favorite--homemade main dishes. Please try and you will make again and again. The chicken is tender and the lime and thyme flavors really stick out. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

Nice little kick.  I deboned and sliced breasts lengthwise, too lazy to pound them out.  I seasoned ahead of time for an hour or so.  Fried in coconut oil that does not taste like coconut.  I used alot more of the mix since I increased the surface area of chicken, plus I had twice as many to begin with.  Very good.  Will keep in my rotation.

Was very tasty. I mixed the spices together with some flour, then dredged the chicken in it before cooking. The flour help make the glaze stick to the chicken better.

this was good chicken!  i had to nix the cayenne for the kiddos, and my 5 year old was still having fits at the table because it was too spicy (the black pepper i guess?) i also set off the smoke alarm with this, i guess cooking with butter at too high of a heat is what did it.  next time, i'd use just olive oil.  i also didn't have enough leftover to make a  sauce, so as others have said, next time i'd also add chicken broth to get enough to make sauce.  it would be good to dip bread in.  all in all, very flavorful chicken that we all enjoyed!  thanks!

This is absolutely DELISH!  I only made enough for two; one boneless breast and one with the bone.  The bone-in came out tastier and juicier (obv.) and I will definitely be making this again.

Obviously this is an extremely popular recipe and now I know why.  It was delicious and couldn't be easier.  I followed another reviewers advise and left out the butter and added chicken broth and lime juice to the pan.  Yum!  Will definitely make this again.

Delicious, especially with Spanish rice. I pounded the breasts to uniform thickness and simmered an extra few minutes. Great for a busy weeknight!

This recipe was OK.  My 10-year-old son told me it was good but not my best chicken.  My husband just kinda shook his head and agreed that it was good.  Those were mediocre responses from my boys.  I followed the recipe pretty exactly -- I didn't have parsley flakes, so I left them out. I don't know if the lime juice curdled the butter or what, but I did not spoon the oily mess over the chicken breasts.  I tried to save it by turning it into a sort-of gravy/sauce mixture, but that didn't work.  As far as the chicken itself went, like I said, it was good but "not my best," and I like to use premium dried spices... Maybe, if there's a next time, I'll try fresh garlic as fresh is almost always better.

Made it to the letter the 1st time and it was excellent. 
The 2nd time I made fajitas out of it by making the following changes: sliced the breasts into strips, replaced the butter with olive oil, doubled the lime juice/garlic powder at the end for more liquid, added a pepper of each color (red, orange, yellow, green, all cut into strips) and 1/2 an onion, cooked the veggies until crisp/tender. Served it all in heated corn tortillas
This is delicious on its own and even better with the modifications.

I am hard to please when it comes to recipes, but this was fabulous! Doubling the spices was perfect, along with adding 1/3 cup of broth to increase the pan glaze. Used fresh garlic, instead of powdered, at the end. For family members liking less heat, you can sprinkle some cutlets with less spice mix.

I've made this a couple of times and have always enjoyed it.  Rather than pounding the chicken, I slice the breasts through the center and end up with thinner breast meat.

This is a quick and easy dinner that always pleases everyone at the table.

My family loves this recipe.  The only thing I've changed is that I don't fry the chicken on the stovetop, but instead grill it.  I follow the recipe above, except I grill the chicken for 7 minutes a side, and baste the boneless breast of chicken with the lime juice / garlic combo during cooking.    This eliminates the need for the butter.

I would say this is good with exception to WAY TO MUCH SALT.  Holy cow!  It would be perfect with about a 1/4 teaspoon salt instead.  It over powers all the other wonderful flavors.  Salt is supposed to bring the flavor out, not take over.  Also, the serving size does not yield enough for 4 normal sized breasts, maybe that is why the salt is overpowering...I would double the amounts of everything but the salt.  1/2 teaspoon salt would be good for the doubling of everything else for 4 breasts.  Then I would say PERFECT!  Nice and easy though with a different spin on lime chicken...which I love. ;)

Burstful of flavor! Followed recipe exactly as written except I didn't add the extra garlic powder at the end. I read from another reviewer that it was too garlicy when you do that. Served with red beans n rice with green beans. Tasted great! 
*Recommend doubling...not enough for 8 chix breats

I followed MesaMa's recommendation to add a little chicken broth to the skillet along with the lime juice which resulted in really flavorful, moist meat.  I know I'll be making this often, so I'll probably quadruple the rub ingredients and put them in a small jar, so I won't have to pull out all of those spice bottles in the future. We really enjoyed this.

The chicken came out really juicy and perfectly cooked but there was WAY too much thyme in it for me and I even halved it. I didn't care too much for this recipe but the hubby did. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious!  I actually only used one chicken breast pounded flat and cut in half, but the same amount of spices.  The blackening effect is so tasty and is great served along side or on top of a salad.

I made this for my b/f & myself who were looking for a new chicken recipe. I paired it with the lime cilantro rice recipe below and it was delicious! We are definitely going to make it again. I doublded the seasoning and sauce as other people had suggested and it was perfect. Yum thanks for the recipe!

Great! I added cumin, and I didn't have thyme. I threw in some onions while the chicken was sauteing, and some black beans right at the end. Served it with pasta, as I'm all out of rice. Fast, easy and tasty. (Would probably be good with some avocado chunks in there too...)

My kids said this tasted like a restaurant meal!  I didn't really measure the spices, just tossed a pinch here and there of each one and added a good amount of lime juice from the bottle.  I made the remainder of the oils we cooked the chicken in,  into a make-shift gravy and lightly topped each chicken with a dab of it.  (not healthy, but yummy)  Served with rice!  Excellent!  Will consider making this when we have company!!  Really, that good!

My family loves this recipe!  I used 'Martha Stewart's Fried Chicken Coating' (home blended) on the chicken since I had it on hand and it contained most of the seasonings listed.  I used sliced garlic instead of the garlic powder with the lime and butter.

I have made a recipe nearly identical (no parsley) to this for many years and it is awesome!  I try to use less butter and oil just to lower the fat.

I thought this recipe was great! I actually threw it all in as a marinade and let the chicken side overnight. It had very nice, complex flavors.

This dish is easy and delicious, the only thing I do differently is to cut the chicken into bite size pieces--it adds more surface area to hold the delicious spices and makes for faster cooking.

Excellent flavor!  I read in one review that they added a splash of tequila, so I did the same and it made the dish fantastic.  I doubled the spice mixture at the beginning of the recipe and I'm glad I did, because I ended up needing all of it to cover the chicken...I guess I had larger pieces of chicken.  I love the strong garlic and lime flavor and the spiciness is just right (although kids will probably find it too "hot").  I'll definitely make this one again and again.

I make this a lot. I generally add more lime juice and use fresh garlic. Sometimes I also add some tequila and I think that really kicks it up a notch. It's best if you marinade it all for a while before cooking.

I adore this recipe! You can almost completely eliminate the butter and olive oil. I put about a teaspoon of olive oil in a spritzer and spray a non-stick skillet, however any cooking spray would work. I've subbed fresh garlic for the powder but either way, this chicken rocks!

Great mixture of spices and lime! I was a little nervous adding the 2 teaspoons of garlic powder during the last 5 minutes because I was afraid it would be overpowering, it wasn't at all. It was the PERFECT balance! I used chicken tenders for this recipe, I thought it gave more flavor than if I had used chicken breasts. SO YUMMY!!

This was delish! I did use 1/2 the lime juice because H isn't too crazy about using pure lemon or lime juice in any recipe, and he loved it! He said this is his new favorite chicken recipe.

This was alright. My family really like it. We used chicken tenders instead of breasts. I wonder if that made a difference? It seemed to have a little too much salt and lime. I'll try it again.

Really flavorful, zingy, & a bit spicy  with all these great ingredients. Even the non spicy eaters in my family enjoyed this. I took the advice of another reviewer & added chicken broth when the butter & olive oil were cooked down too much. It made a great sauce. Thanks for sharing!

The flavors are amazing.  But -- next time I will reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp.  Also, I increased the lime/garlic sauce at the end, and added chicken broth a time or two as my sauce cooked down too much.  Finally, I added about a T. sugar as it was too sour for my young kids (and me too for that matter).  It was delicious and the sauce was amazing over rice.

This recipe was good, but I don't think it was 5 star good.  I had two large chicken breasts, so I butterflied them.  I don't think that thick breasts would work well with this recipe.  I did not take the other reviewers' advice to double the sauce, so I really didn't have any.  It was also a bit too sour for us, so if you're not a huge fan of lime, cut out a TB or so. It was very quick to make, and I made it into a light dinner with brown rice and brussel sprouts. I'll make it again, but it is just not one of our favorites!

I was glad I did :) After combining the first 7 ingredients, I rub the mix all over the chicken breasts and let it sit in the fridge for about 3 hours.  I combined butter, olive oil and lime juice and used it as a baste.  I baste frequently & generously (every time I turned the chicken over).  It smelled great while cooking.  The chicken turned out moist and just very flavorful.  My guests loved them!  Thanks for sharing.  I have found yet another favorite that my family loves.

Delicious.  Instead of doing a saute, I grilled my chicken.  I mixed all of the ingredients (amt. for 3 chicken breasts), added 3 tbsp. lime juice, 2 tbsp. of olive oil to create a marinade.  Left in fridge for about 2 hours, then put 3 chicken breasts on the grill.  Turned out super!

This is by far my favorite chicken recipe of all time. I usually double the lime juice and make a sauce (1/2 cup white wine + 1/2 cup chicken broth) - then add the leftovers from the chicken pan into the sauce and serve over fettucine. FANTASTIC!

The sauce described in the recipe was almost non-existent, so I did a quick pan sauce by sauteing some red onions and deglazing with more lime juice.  I topped it with fresh cilantro.  This chicken was fresh tasting and moist and my pan sauce added some extra zing to an otherwise good recipe.

WOW this was good. I doubled the lime juice  and added it to the original spice mixture (along with the extra garlic powder) and let the chicken marinate for about 30 min. cooked the chicken in nonfat cooking spray and it still tasted great!! will definitely make this again :)

Wow!  This is sooo good!  Fast, easy and loaded with flavor!  I just used fresh garlic in place of powdered.  Served with roasted potatoes and buttered baby carrots.  I'll be making this again!

Yumm! I love the flavor of this, I changed it a bit, using more lime than the recipe called for, and minced garlic instead of powder. I also cut the chicken into strips because we like it that way ...more flavor. I roasted the garlic in the butter/oil before adding the chicken. My wife loved it too... and she's SUPER picky!

Really good flavor!  I'm not a huge fan of cooking chicken on stovetop in oil, but it came out really well.  Served with black beans, which was a great complement for it.

Wow, this was flavorful and delicious and SOOOOOO quick and easy to make.  I made the whole dinner in a few minutes flat.  It took a little longer to cook, but prep time was next to nothing.  This was probally the quickest 5 star meal yet!  I did make a few changes.  I only used 2 chicken breast, and cut them into strips.  I used all the seasonings for the rub and did not cut them in half.  I used cajun seasoning instead of cayenne powder, because that was what I had on hand.  I cut the chicken in strips before seasoning.  I cut the garlic to sprinkle on the chicken after it had cooked to 1 tsp. and cut the lime juice to 2 Tbsp.  I made rice a roni fried rice flavor with peas added to the rice as a side dish and voila!!  Dinner in less than 1/2 an hour!!

WOW! This was so good. I pound the chicken breasts thin for even cooking, otherwise I follow the directions exactly. As a matter of fact we make this so often I have a jar full of the spice mixture in my cupboard. We love to make street tacos out of it with plenty of onions and cilantro! Once a week dish, at least. Thanks so much for sharing.

If your a spice lover, and I am, you'll need to add more to this recipe. I didn't change the recipe at all and would probably use more cayenne pepper next time. Overall it wasn't a bad tasting dinner but I would probably grill it next time and omit the butter.....I think it would taste just as good with a little less fat!

This recipe was pretty good. I found it to be very spicy even though I only used half the cayenne pepper that it called for, and I thought I would get more lime flavor from this recipe. I did like it though, it just wasn't exactly what I was expecting. For a excellent chicken recipe with alot of lime flavor, try the Lime Chicken Soft Tacos from this site. They are incredible!

This was extremely easy and delicious.  Actually, I'm teaching my signifcant other to cook and I supervised him while doing it.  He was so proud of himself with the results.  He did make one mistake - he doubled the amount of garlic powder but it tasted great and I think I will continue to make that mistake!

I decreased the cayenne to 1/8 tsp, sliced the chicken into strips when it was done, & made fajitas with salsa, grated cheese, sour cream, etc.  Next time, I'm going to slice the chicken into strips before cooking, decrease the butter/oil a bit, cook it less, & adjust the seasoning amounts just a bit to my family's taste.

I enjoyed the flavors in this dish -- it went great with a green salad dressed with a simple lime-vinegrette. I did make a couple adjustments: I used fresh garlic instead of powdered, added a couple tablespoons chicken broth with the lime juice, and tossed in some chopped fresh cilantro at the end to liven things up.

This dish was great,but I added a chopped onion and 2 cloves of garlic[in place of the powdered]. I tripled the recipe and added the juice of 2 fresh limes and then sliced the lime peels and added this to the sauce--it added a nice compliment to the hot spices.Next time,I might try adding 2 tart green apples [in chunks] -the last l5 minutes to balance the hot spices--[my husband thought this would be great also]. I served it over rice,but it might be  interesting over pasta as well.

Wow, this was superb!  The only changes I made were doubling the herb mix, cutting my large chicken breasts in half length wise and omitting the butter. A key ingredient; the garlic powder makes this.  Don't get me wrong.  I love using fresh garlic, but somehow the powder makes the sauce more substantial.  There is a place for garlic powder in cooking and this is a perfect use of it!  Try the recipe close to "as is".  I see no need to add chicken broth at all, because that's a whole different recipe!  I'll be making this  often...delicious!

This is a ridiculous amount of garlic powder!  Too much!! Use real garlic (one clove) in butter and olive oil at beginning (shred with cheese shredder, can do this with frozen veggies for stew or soup as well) .  Drizzle lime at end as normal.  Makes much better chicken.

love this! I added more lime and chicken broth. I also added a little flour to thicken the sauce then serve it over linguine with asparagus.

This made the most delicious and simple chicken that my husband can't stop talking about.  I cut back the cayenne just a bit because of my kids, but the flavor great.  The lemon juice added a nice tang and moistness to to check.  Definitely adding this one to my weekly rotation.

I can't really rate the taste because I accidentally put too much cayenne.  But it was definitely easy and quick.

I knocked my own socks off with this, I had no idea it was going to be so amazing!  I used Chili Powder instead of some of the seasoning listed, because I didn't have them on hand.  I can't wait to make for the rest of my family.

I've done this recipe twice now - the first time, I followed the recipe exactly. It was so delicious that my family insisted that it go into the rotation, and so it did. The second time, I took another reviewer's suggestion and added some chicken broth and a flour/water slurry to make a pan sauce - it went great over rice. This one's definitely a keeper!

Great lime chicken! I made this tonight but did not add the lime until the 15 minutes total cooking time were done - cooking lime makes it sour.  I also prepared a cup of chicken broth and kept spooning it over the chicken while it was cooking and it helped with creating a sauce to pour over the chicken. I added one garlic clove to the last 2 minutes of cooking time. Last, I scraped what was left and added 3 tablespoons of lime and spooned it on the chicken. My kids (10 & 13) devoured it.  I would cut the salt to 1/4 teaspoon next time as I thought it was too salty. I also put the chicken with the rub on it in a gallon size bag in the fridge for a couple hours until I was ready to cook it at dinner time, saved on prep time, cleaning time and could do that in the morning before work, etc.  Served this with a side of coleslaw and it was a delicious and healthy dinner.

I followed some other reviews on this and I literally make this once a week. I use boneless chicken with skin on. I use the spices listed but double the recipe so I have plenty. I add some fresh garlic instead of powdered garlic and mix in some lime juice to form a paste. I then mince half a jalapeño and add it to my paste.  I take generous spoonfuls of the paste and rub it under the skin, using a little on the outside of the skin as well. I salt and pepper the skin and put it in the broiler for 7 minutes so it gets nice and crispy, then reduce to bake at 350 for about 18 minutes. This chicken comes out full of flavor, very juicy and even better for lunch the next day. I love this recipe with a side of brown rice and some vegetables - it's easy, healthy and delicious. Thanks!!

This tastes AWESOME, but the original recipe HAS to be adjusted.  There is WAY too little spice mixture to "sprinkle generously" on both sides.  I never use salt to cook with, leaving others to salt to taste, so I tripled the quantities of the spice mixture without any salt to have enough for one batch, or double it with the salt.  Regarding thick or thin chicken, if you are easily overpowered by lime, then use thinner pieces.  To me, the lime is the flavor that really zings in this and the thicker pieces can absorb more of the lime flavor so you taste more in each bite.  As for the garlic powder to use in the pan at the end, I just coated each piece with a fine layer of garlic powder directly from the shaker, coating the pieces as I would shake garlic powder onto a slice of pizza. If you LOVE garlic, as I do, then coat both sides.  Also, the cooking time, obviously, is greatly adjusted with the thinner pieces if you choose to use them.

Finally, I enjoyed this so much, I made a shaker of this spice mixture for use at any time.  To do this, I first put the parsley in the small mixing bowl and crushed it fine so it would come out of a shaker.  I tried using a shaker with bigger holes but the mix came out too fast and still slightly clogged with larger parsley flakes.  If you have a mortar and pestle that is obviously the best to use to crush the parsley, but if not you can use the sides or bottom of a spoon in a rounded bowl and it does it pretty quickly.

I keep a jar of this spice mix on-hand now. I love to serve it with fresh pineapple spears and a black bean cilantro quinoa salad. Note: the more lime, the better!

This is really good, I have made it a few times. A few changes, I cut the chicken into strips, and did the saute with a few teaspoons of minced garlic. I did not use the garlic powder. The second time I made it I ran out of lime juice so I used half lime and half lemon. It tasted pretty much the same. The chicken is also great the next day cold on a salad. Thank you for the recipe!

This was so awesome! I fixed it just as presented - and the guys were licking their plates! I should have pounded the breasts thinner, but otherwise, tender, juicy, and delicious.

Very good flavor. My husband loved it.  A bit too spicy for me.  Next time I will make mine with less pepper and add the rest for his.  Will be making this again in the near future.

I doubled all the spices expect the salt on the chicken breasts because it wasn't enough.  The extra garlic powder masks the flavor of the other spices so I will leave it out next time.  Lastly it was a little too sour for my taste so I will decrease the amount of lime juice to two tablespoons next time.

WOW!!! This was fantastic! Moist and the whole family loved it! I did follow the advise of using a 1/3 cup of chicken stock as well and it made more sauce. It was very good and I will make it again. I was also pleased that it wasn't too spicy! Great job!!!

This was so good!  I used a package of Costco boneless skinless chicken breasts (2 of them) cut horizontally to make them thinner but kept the recipe exactly the same.  The only other change I made was to use two cloves of pressed garlic rather than garlic powder for the cooking part.  Talk about an easy and delicious meal!  Thanks!  I don't know why I waited so long to make this!

Very good recipe. Great flavor and so easy to prepare. I added a little lime zest and served it with quinoa.

Love this chicken...I hadn't made it in ages, but did it again tonight. I'd forgotten how tender and flavorful it is! Served with black beans and lime-cilantro rice and it was totally terrific. Didn't change a thing, except to butterfly two breasts into four pieces of chicken.

This recipe is now a staple in my kitchen, and I'm not not even a huge fan of meat. However I have made a few changes to the spice mixtures (as suggested by other reviewers). First of all, I am not hesitant to double or triple all of the spices except for the cayenne pepper. The extra spices in the juice that we serve over the chicken and corn are just a bonus. Also we sauteed garlic and onion with the chicken and omit the garlic powder at the end (since we are already using garlic). This pairs very well with corn.

My picky family thought that this is the best chicken that they've ever had. It's healthy, and has a great flavor/ spice to it. My eight year old enjoyed helping me mix the seasonings and enjoyed that she had helped make such a wonderful main dish! I decreased the amount of garlic powder omitting the 2 teaspoons at the end, also I had to make two batches of the spice blend because it wasn't enough for 4 chicken breast halves. A GREAT main dish!

I'm giving it 4 stars based on following the recommendations of the reviewers, but to give it 5 stars, I would still continue to modify the recipe.  For 4 pieces of chicken, I doubled the spices except I left the salt as is because people complained that it was too salty.  I LOVED the flavor and light heat; however; it was STILL too salty.  For 5 stars, the salt content would still have to be reduced.  I liked it more than my husband, who said it was "just ok".  In fact, he ended up pouring salsa, a bit of sour cream, and cheese on top and said that it was pretty good.  It's an easy dish, and I would make again, but I would definitely reduce the salt even more.

Normally I don't love chicken but I love this recipe.  I double the spices and use boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  It's fantastic served with copycat Chipotle lime cilantro rice.

This was a great, simple recipe, and definitely one that will be a summer staple!  Like others, I doubled the spice mixture, added 1/2 cup of chicken stock and a splash of tequilla at the end and it made a substantial sauce.  I gave this 4/5 because next time I would make a few changes: decrease the salt by 1/2 and double the lime juice. Overall, great, healthy easy recipe that makes another chicken dinner not so boring!

Very Tasty! I will definitely make again. I followed the recipe exact except for the end. Instead of sprinkling with the garlic powder and adding the lime, I mixed it together first and then poured over the chicken.

This was a very good recipe.  I really like the spice mixture used.  I didn't have cayene, so I used crushed red pepper flakes.  I served over cilantro lime rice.  Really quick and tasty recipe.  Thanks!

I would make this again, but will cut down on how much I actually coat the chicken.  I only needed two large chicken breasts, so didn't need quite as much seasoning as I made.  I'd be next time, I'd up the rating to 4 stars.  Note:  I did cut down on the garlic by a small amount since so many people noted it was overwhelming at the suggested levels and I agree that it was a good adjustment.

loved it!!! so good. it definitely has a kick to it by the way, but i didn't really measure the spices and probably went a little crazy with the cayenne. paired it with wild rice and broccoli. not much lime to it but a very delicious flavor none-the-less.

Made this on Mar 21/12, and it was OK.  I followed some other reviewers advice and added the zest from the lime.  Added far to much.  Next time only use the juice.  Used about half the amount of spice - next time use the full amount it asks for.

My whole family loved it. I made quite a few changes though. I made it into a marinade (thanks to a previous review) I also added cilantro. I let it marinade for 2 hours then through it on the grill. It was delicious!!! The left overs make a great sandwich the next day.

I'd rate this more than 5! Forget about going out for Mexican - this is better! So easy and quick - the ingredients are perfect. It'd go great as well served up in tortillas or with spanish rice. I doubled my spices for extra spiciness and served with sliced lime garnish and a citrus margarita - perfect beverage to balance the spiciness and complement the lime flavor! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This was very good!  I did make a few changes though: doubled the spices but made the mistake of not increasing the lime juice.  After I browned the chicken, I removed it from the pan, sauteed some onions and garlic, then added a little chicken stock and cooked it down for a few minutes before adding the chicken back in to finish cooking.  I spooned the sauce over the chicken when serving. Nice and spicy but not too much-I don't care for much heat.   I will make this one again for sure!

Wow- this was really good!  After chix was done, I deglazed pan with white wine, let reduce, then thickened with cornstarch/chix broth slurry-the sauce made the dish!  I did use minced garlic with the lime juice. Served with jasmine rice and broc- everyone loved!

This chicken tastes really great without adding the lime juice which gives it a sweet taste, I recommend instead to add flour and bread crumbs and it would taste better than KFC

I made this lastnight. The chicken turned out with wonderful flavor! I mixed up the seasoning but by the time I had my 4 chicken breasts sprinkled on one side the seasoning was gone so had to mix up another batch. Served with mashed potatos and fresh steamed asparagus. YUM!

Even though this recipe is highly rated, I was still a little hesitant about trying it. The 2 tsp. of garlic powder scared me! I pushed passed my fears and followed the recipe exactly. I'm so glad I did because it was delicious!!!!!

What can I say about this dish? It's soooo delicious and I know my family will be going for seconds.I followed this recipe as it was written but I added lime slices and a dash more of lime juice to the chicken when it was done.

This recipe is really terrific.  I pounded my chicken breasts because some were thick.  I took the advice of another reviewer and used very little garlic powder at the end.  My husband loved this.  Add green beans and you have a wonderful meal.

We really liked this! Easy to fix. I pretty much followed the recipe except used up 3 chicken breasts I had (sliced them in to small pieces before cooking in olive oil (no butter used). Also sliced up a portabello mushroom to add in to mix. Seemed like I needed more liquid so I added about a cup of low-sodium V8 juice. Next time I'd probably add some chicken stock too. Covered this and simmered for about 45 minutes. When done, I added 1-2 Tbsp of sour cream. Served over brown rice. Spicy, tasty, and easy!!!

If I could give this 10 stars, I would!!! Delicious. I used the thin sliced boneless, skinless chicken breasts and I added 1/3 cup chicken stock when I added the lime juice. Also, I doubled the spice rub. Instead of mixing in a bowl, I put the spices in a Ziploc bag and added the chicken to shake it on instead of sprinkling it on. Great recipe...the family LOVES it!! :)

It’s a KEEPER!!  Not just an occasional dinner it will go on the rotation. I too made some adjustments. I didn’t have cayenne pepper so I used red pepper and added a little extra. I also added a little extra of smoked paprika. I used 1 small clove of fresh garlic and a sprinkle of garlic powder in the rub instead of just powder. I had plenty of time so I marinated the chicken with the rub for about 4-5 hours. After cooking the chicken, I combined the lime juice, garlic powder and ½ cup of chicken broth and cooked for 5 minutes, removed the chicken and added some flour to thicken the sauce, replaced chicken for a few minutes and served it with white rice and green beans and Italian bread.

My husband really liked this recipe. We sliced the chicken and used it in fajitas. We also followed other reviewers in adding a little bit of chicken broth and fresh cilantro at the end. Next time I will try a splashs of tequila as well.

Awesome recipe, I make this as often as I can get away with. I usually cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces before coating with the spices, it cooks much faster and allows for the flavour to soak in even more. Delicious, thanks for sharing!

Delicious! My family devoured this one! I did as another person suggested and at the end threw in a splash of tequila, some margarita mix and 1 1/2 Tbsp of honey (I mixed it with the lime juice). Soooo good! I can't imagine it without those three ingredients, but I'm sure that even without them, it's good. Thanks C. Perez - this one's a keeper!

This was good but I didn't think it was anything spectacular. The spice mixture didn't jump out at me but I enjoyed the limey taste. I did add some chopped jalapenos and finished with some tequila. The rest of the family enjoyed.

Very moist and flavorful. The lemon juice was a little over powering, and we had to scrape the extra off the chicken

This was yummy!!!!  I didn't have any onion powder so I just left it out.  I used creole seasoning instead of salt and minced garlic instead of powder in the end sauce and added a shot of tequila.  Not very time consuming either.  Pretty much the perfect dish!  Thanks for sharing!

Terrific simple recipe. Served it over couscous. Only change is that I used thighs instead of breasts.

Wasn't exactly spicy to me, but I know that's a matter of taste. I'm a three-star guy so maybe I'll add a little more cayenne next time.

Very very nice. Lovely spice and kick combination that was loved by all. I cut this into thin strips as a varition and kept all else the same, and it was loved by all this way too. I've also done this with frech finely chopped onion and garlic instead of the onion and garlic powder, I think it would have worked except I didn't give it enough marination time hence the flavours didn't 'catch on' well enough nor did it get a lovely golden brown colour. But, enough said, this is a lovely recipe that goes fabulously with rice. Thank you Perez for sharing. =)

Deelishus!! As readers suggested, doubled the rub, added a big shake of garlic powder, then added it to a plastic bag with 2 T of olive oil, juice from one lime and a handful of chopped cilantro. Butterflied 3 chicken breasts, added it to the bag and marinated all day. Cooked it on the grill and it was GREAT. We kept on going back to sneak in just another bite. Will definitely make again. Thanks!!

This was excellent, and since it didn't require marinating, it was SUPER quick. I doubled all the dry spices for 4 breasts - the amount it calls for covered 2 (I coated it on though). I also followed other reviews and upped the butter to 3 tablespoons to make more broth. Awesome, awesome.

This was fantastic! Made it for my husband & in-laws, who are not big fans of chicken dishes. But they all loved this! So full of flavor and just the right amount of tang from the lime. Thanks for this great recipe!

I really enjoyed this.  I wish I had a splash of tequilla to finish it off but that is not something I normally keep on hand.  This recipe is so versitile.  This time I put i over rice but I am thinking the leftovers will make great sandwiches or quesidillias

this is a quick and easy dish to prepare.  the only thing I did differently from the recipe is add 1 cup chicken broth to make more sauce.  I let the broth and lime juice simmer for about 15 minutes to make a sauce and served it over pasta with the chicken.  The family loved it.

This recipe was great, it's my husband's new, hands down, all time favorite chicken recipe! Personally it was too spicy for me, but I can't handle a lot of spice to begin with. 
I followed the recipe, browning the chicken in the skillet, but then I poured the lot into a baking dish and baked it in the oven until the chicken was 165 degrees (25 minutes at 450 degrees).
My husband likes it so much he wants me to make it again for all of his friends. All in all a very tasty, very easy and quick recipe!

I only used 1 big boneless breast with these measurements. Next time I will add a fresh Serrano or jalapeño  pepper. Lime was right for us.

Yum! I can't imagine not doubling the spices. Next time I'll cut back on the salt..it was overwhelmingly salty to me but my husband loved it. There was a nice kick to this chicken that was very well balanced. It wasn't too much at all. I omitted the onion powder (never have any on hand) and butter but used everything else! Loved it!

I have been making this regularly forever now and just realized I haven't reviewed the recipe!  It is a standby favourite!  I omit the parsley and double the cayenne.  As others have suggested, I double the spice mixture, more is better!    Instead of garlic powder, I use fresh near the end (1-2 cloves) and add a couple splashes of tequila (at the same time as the lime juice).  I also skip the butter all together.  As I usually only make one serving at a time, I end up using a whole lime for the juice.  I serve it with garlic mashed potatoes. That seems to help offset some of the heat.  I love, love, love this recipe!  And whenever I make it for others, they rave as well! Satisfying all around!   This recipe has been fondly renamed "Tequila Chicken"!  Thank you C. Perez!

This chicken was VERY garlicy, but not very spicy....  If I make it again, I'll use half of the salt and garlic, and double the cayenne.

Just average.  I doubled the spices and the chicken was still kind of bland.  We grilled it and basted with the lime mixture.  Probably will not make again.

I'm usually pretty lazy about rating but made this recipe with minor modifications for friends last night and was blown away.  So easy and SO fabulous.

My changes included doubled the spice mixture - we all liked spicy food, so I decided to risk it.  I also used minced garlic (not powdered) in the sauce and added a fresh, diced jalapeno while the chicken was cooking.  I seeded it this time, but may include some seeds for extra kick next time.  Like another reviewer, I pounded my chicken breasts to make them thinner.  I also added a shot of tequila to the sauce after the chicken was cooked and let it simmer.  The end result was delicious.  So very impressed!

Fantastic dish!!!  I doubled the Cayenne, but we like it hot here.  I agree with other posters, the garlic at the end is WAY too much.   I only add 1/2 teaspoon but I also add another dash or two of cayenne and 3 tablespoons of lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of water or white vinegar to help fill out the sauce.  I love having extra sauce to pour over my jasmine white rice as well, so it is quite easy to double the sauce.  A BIG "Thank you!" to the poster for sharing this wonderful dish.  This is one of our favorites!!

Loved it....doubled the sauce (lime and butter) and used fresh garlic.  Very unique flavor...next time will add red pepper flakes for some more kick.

Way too salty--I thought it was excellent once I used 1/4 teaspoon of salt instead of 3/4.  That is the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars.

This was good but I’ll admit … I made some alternations based on previous reviews.  I followed the recipe to a tee except I sauteed the chicken breasts in two fillets to make two and make them a little thinner (didn’t feel like pounding), browned them on each side until they had a slight crust, removed them from the pan, poured in chicken broth and added a little water and some chicken bouillon cubes, and let the chicken simmer in that with a lid on the pan.  I served whole kernel corn with fresh cilantro, salt and butter, and a fresh garden salad on the side.  Without that chicken broth I don’t think there would be enough “juices”.

We loved it at our house! Only thing I did differently was to add 1/3 cup of chicken broth to deglaze the pan and keep the chicken moist.

I mixed the spices as directed and only used two chicken breasts and the spices were just the correct amount.  Since my chicken was thin, I only needed to cook it for about 3 minutes each side and cooked it an additional 3 minutes while coating it with the sauce...which was enough sauce with only the two pieces of chicken.  Flavorful!

I doubled the sauce as suggested and should have doubled the rub.  I also cooked the chicken for 30 minutes in the oven, then transferred to the sauce for 10 minutes or so.  Next time I will slice the chicken while it is in the sauce.

Really Good!  The store I shop at was out of chicken breasts that I buy so I got thighs and removed the skin and put in skillet with the seasoning a  few minutes on each side.  Then put in a casserole dish and poured the lime juice and garlic mixture over the top of each and baked.  Moist, yummy, flavorful chicken!

Ok, I didn't measure the spices at all, I used real garlic and onion instead of powder, and I used lemon juice instead of lime.  Basically added more of what I liked and less of what I didn't.  All in all, great turn out!  Served it on some rice and had a little salad with it.  Definitely a good recipe and I will probably make it again, very easy!

Very flavorful and oil stayed in pan. A little salty? Used Garlic Pepper as no powder and maybe salt was in that. Served with brown rice and carrots w butter and dill. In My Recipe  Box!

I followed the comments of another reviewer and added 1/3 cup of chicken broth to the sauce. It balanced out the lime nicely, so there are definite notes of lime and garlic but they aren't overpowering. I only added 2 Tbsp of lime juice, and omitted the onion powder since I was out. My parents went crazy for it! I added some rice to the final product, and will be cutting up the smallest pieces of chicken to add to my salads :) Side note: definitely use chicken breasts for this recipe. I used thighs, because that's what I had, and I had to cook them an additional half hour in the oven. A thinner cut of chicken should cook all the way on the skillet.

It's the little kick from the cayenne pepper that makes this recipe unique. And by little kick I mean a delightful sensation not "ow!" I can't eat spicy foods and this was juuuust right. I'm sure those who want a bigger kick can turn up the heat by adding more cayenne if desired.

I've been making this for years, from another recipe, minus the parsley and thyme.  I usually use chicken tenders, or cut the breasts into strips, just because it cooks faster.  We love it!

I love this chicken.  The thing I love the most is that it is so EASY!  It has just the right amount of spiciness, enough that you notice, but not too much that it makes you sweat.  A couple of changes: I used only 1 tsp. garlic powder because I didn't want it to overpower everything else, I also used sea salt instead of table salt (since it's coarser, the same measurement will give you less salt overall).  I served it with "Awesome and Easy Creamy Corn Casserole" from this site, and the two went perfectly together.  I will make this again!

This is very, very good. A little salty, but otherwise deliciously tender and flavorful. Don't put the pan juices on top of the chicken or else it will be too salty.

Awesome.  Doubled the recipe and rubbed on 4 small pork tenderloins.  Barbequed them and sliced for fajitas.  Everyone loved them.  The sauce I made in a saucepan by adding some chicken broth and then reducing it and used it over the sliced pork before serving.  Yummy.

This recipe was a bit too spicy and strong on thyme for my taste. For a more mild dish that still has a little kick, try these measurements: 1 tsp black pepper 1/4 cayenne 1/2 tsp paprika  1 tsp garlic powder 1/2 tsp onion powder 1/2 tsp thyme 1 tsp parsley I used on thin sliced chicken breasts for a stronger spice flavor, and served with extra lime. Yum!

Nice blend of flavours.  Nothing overpowered another taste.  One bite is a bit more garlic, another is lime, something different every bite

Loved this!  I cheated a bit though.  I wanted to cook on the grill so I mixed it all up and poured it over the chicken in a bag.  I put extra lime on it before I served it.  My 3 yr old twins even asked for seconds and they always pick at their dinner.

This was so delicious that after I ate my chicken breast, I had to go back to make the rest of the bag of breasts I had.  I was a little bit spicy but not too hot and I added lemon juice to the mix.  We ate this on spanish style brown rice with broccoli.  I also had left overs on salad and it was so juicy and perfect I cant wait to make more!

Awesome! My husband said I've ruined Applebee's Fiesta Lime Chicken for him. THIS IS WAY BETTER!The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I use more lime and we grill it. Make sure you don't over grill it.

I made this last night for my husband who is the worlds greatest guiny pig. I tested it on him because I want to make it for my church this coming Sunday. He didn"t say too much. I, on the other hand, thought it was wonderful. But, you know what? He didn't have to say anything. He kept going back into the skillet eating what was left. Actions speak louder than words. Thank you C, Perez. Will be making this for church and home again  and again! I forgot to mention that I did take the advise of other reviewers and added  chicken broth and I pounded it out a little.
4/21/10 Had church fellowship. The menu was fried, grilled and bbq chicken, potato salad, and green beans. Of course, I added the Spicey Garlic Lime Chicken on my own. THEY WENT CRAZY.  It was like word of mouth. I asked them to try it. After they tried it they started spreading the news. There was none left. You can really tweak this recipe. Because I quadrupled the recipe (I used 16 chicken breasts) I had a lot more sauce, but still needed a little more. I pounded the chicken as suggested by one reviewer and added 1 cup of chicken broth as suggested by another reviewer. Because there was more liquid than I had in the original I thickened it a little with a mixture of cornstarch and water.
Because i flattened the breast, which made them appear larger, I was able to cut them in half after they were cooked. So, I had 32 pieces of chicken.
Next time I will add more chicken broth and maybe some mushrooms and onions.

Very easy and tastey.  I followed it exact just added extra butter and I didn't measure out the spices, just sprinkled them on.  Next time I would use more lime juice

Definitely yummy and I didn't have to go out and buy anything - all of these ingredients were on my spice rack so it didn't require a trip to the grocery store.  Definitely makes a spicy chicken dish but not hard to make at all.  I will say that I only used two chicken breast halves for the amount of spice recommended and it was the right amount so I think that you would have to increase it for the quantity of chicken recommended in the recipe.  Also, I substituted fresh minced garlic for garlic powder.  Instead of using garlic powder at the end I just added another tablespoon of lime juice.  Tasty and spicy!

Very tasty and easy to make.  The chicken was tender though I did have the cook it ten minutes longer than the recipe stated.  Also, I used garlic cloves instead of powder with the butter and olive oil.

I'm not a big fan of big slabs of meat for dinner, but this was awesome.  Very simple, but with unbelievable flavor!  Great with pico de gallo, Mexican rice, and a little salad.

This is a great easy chicken recipe that is a hit every time! I use this recipe for 2 chicken breasts instead of 4. I always use fresh minced garlic instead of powder, double the cayenne (we like heat!), and add chopped fresh cilantro then let it all marinade in a ziploc bag for 3-4 hours before cooking. To change it up occassionally, I'll remove the breasts after they're done cooking and add sliced onions to the pan, saute until tender, then add a cornstarch slurry to make a delicious gravy to top the chicken served over cilantro rice. Yum! Thank you for this great chicken recipe!

used chicken thighs, covered with the spice rub, then browned in olive oil and butter. Added a splash of tequila and about 1/2 cup chicken broth, fresh garlic, lime juice then finsihed baking in the oven! Very moist and great sauce!

Really good.  I did double the spices and pound the chicken thin so it cooked quicker.  The only other change I made was to delete the garlic powder that is added at the end and replaced it with two chopped cloves of fresh garlic. I'll be making this again! Thanks

This recipe had a good taste but should be doubled.  Also the cooking times do need to be longer as even an added 2 mins still resulted in a few breasts not cooked all the way.  Would work better as a marinade overnight.  Not to dry, moist enough to break apart and cut with a knife.

This was passable but not spectacular.  I recommend NOT sprinkling the garlic powder on top as directed.  It was serious overkill.  I also think just pouring the lime juice into the pan rather than straight on top of the seasoned chicken breasts would help unless you are a huge fan of lime... and I mean a huge fan.

I thought this one is a keeper for sure. I always make my boyfriend rate me on a scale from 1 to 10 and he usally just gives me a 8 or 9, but when he said "12" I flipped out. I was so excited! The only thing that I would do differently next time is double the spices so it is more like a rub I guess you could say. When I made this I already added in extra spices and for me atleast it still wasn't enough. Taking into account that I did use extra chicken. Even if the recipe was made as is I still feel like the extra would'nt hurt just give it more flavor.

I smashed my chicken so it was thinner, and added fresh minced garlic as it simmered with lime. Also let the spices marinate over 24 hours. It was a very yummy dish.

I didn't have cayenne pepper, so I left it out.  I used real garlic instead of garlic powder.  I also realized halfway through that I didn't have lime juice.  I ended up using lemon juice.  I doubled everything so that I would have enough sauce as suggested in previous reviews.  I also added some chicken broth (probably about 1/3 cup) when I added the lemon juice.  My family really enjoyed this.  It had a really good flavor, although the sauce is what makes it great.  I served the chicken over rice.

Strong flavor, but was a hit with the family. Reheated the leftovers in foil in the oven with the leftover broccoli we had the night before. It was so amazing!! I did marinate the chicken for a couple hours in the rub with a lil lime juice. 
Shared the recipe with my sister already! Served with rice & steamed broccoli.

this is one of my favorite dinners.  i pound the chicken flat before cooking and serve it with white rice and a veggie.  i also only use two chicken breasts since it's just me and my boyfriend, and the amount of sauce is perfect for the both of us.  i would suggest doubling the sauce for more people.

Wow! We all loved this, and loved the lime flavor so much that we squeezed lime onto everything on our plate! Will definitely make this on a regular basis, but probably cut the butter because it really didn't make a sauce, just a greace over the chicken, which of course was tastey, but not healthy! Thanks for the great recipe!

As always, I took some of the other recommendations and combined them together.  I mixed the spices and rubbed them on the chicken breasts, then I combined minced garlic with chopped onion and sprinkled that on the chicken also.  I dribbled lime juice on them and left them in the fridge overnight and cooked them on the Foreman grill.  Easy and good!

This was a great recipe. I did cut back on the spicy stuff and added extra garlic (my kids loved it). Served with black beans, rice and plantains-- yummy- will make again!

This recipe is probably my new favorite from this site and I will undoubtedly make it regularly! After the chicken had been fried on both sides, I added about 2 tbl extra butter before putting in the lime juice and garlic salt (I didn't have garlic powder). I served this on a bed of rice that had sauteed onion and garlic, chicken broth, and cilantro as another reviewer had suggested. It was beyond delicious! I think it would go well with fish too.

This is wonderful.  I love the spices and the lime juice together.  My son had a friend over and they both liked it.  I cut my breasts up into to tenders.  I also mixed up the dry ingred. put in baggie with chicken and shook and put in fridge, has we had to go pick up the kid.  I already know that I am going to take the leftovers and add to the Quick Mediterranean Pasta I made tonight with a sort of alfredo.  I also think putting all the ingred. except butter in a bag with chicken and leave all day then GRILL would be great.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will make this again.

I only did 2 chicken breasts but kept the amount of spices called for 4. I also doubled the amount of sauce as per others' suggestions. I cut the chicken into pieces, added chopped onion and green pepper, and served over rice. Delish!

Wow!!!  Finally a recipe for chicken my husband will not only eat, but enjoy!!!  I used thighs instead of breasts, couldn't find my cayenne pepper so I added a few drops of homemade hot sauce to the lime/garlic mixture.  Very good, easy and delightfully different!!!

This is an absolutely delicious, easy recipe.  It is my husband's favorite chicken recipe. I always have the ingredients on hand, so it is my go to recipe when I don't know what to cook. We love it so much, one of these days, I'm going to make a large amount of the seasoning mix and put it in its own shaker bottle to make prep even easier.

The drippings were a little too limey for me, but my husband was fine with it.  A side of couscous absorbed the extra drippings I had poured over everything.  The chicken itself, moreover, was nicely seasoned.  Perfect ratio of effort expended to tastiness achieved!  Would definitely make again on another busy evening.

Very good! I also doubled the sauce, but went easy on the lime juice. Cooking in the butter/oil makes a nice, semi-crispy crust.

FABULOUSLY FLAVORFUL AND SO QUICK & EASY. It took longer than 5 minutes prep time, probably 15 minutes because I pounded the chicken and slit the chicken breasts in half and spread the seasoning inside. I doubled all ingredients EXCEPT SALT and it was about right for the large breasts that I had. Will make every time I have lime in the house! YUM!

Delicious.  I make this chicken at least once a week.  The only modification I made was slicing in the chicken on both sides and I sprinkled the spice mixture inside so the seasonings would cook inside the chicken as well.  The chicken breasts I used were pretty thick, so slicing them gave the chicken a more consistent flavor throughout.  

To save time, I made four portions of the seasonings ahead of time and have the mix in it's own spice jar.  That cut the prep time even more on this quick dish.

Loved it. Really moist chicken with great taste! I only used 2 chicken breasts, cut each in half, and kept all the other ingredients the same (except I used lowfat butter and a little extra lime)! Will definately make again!

Awesome!! A bit too spicy as I used the entire seasonings on only 2 chicken breasts...but having that much seasoning made for a great "crust".  I will cut the salt and cayenne next time, though.  I agree that there needs to be more sauce...I had none to spoon over when ready to serve...the lime juice adds such a flavor kick!  I used olive oil only when sauting and didn't miss the butter at all.  I will definately be making this again and again...I'm going to try this for chicken fajitas--use the seasoning mix on the veggies, too then drizzle some extra lime juice over the veggies before serving.  Yum!

Very good- I used only 1/8tsp of cayenne and it was plenty.  I also only used 3 chix breasts, so the spice mix and sauce might have been slightly more concentrated than if I'd used 4.  Not alot of sauce, but very good flavor!

I followed another poster's advice and I made a paste w/ onion, jalapeno, garlic, a few tbsp chicken bouillon and the seasonings it called for. I added it all to the blender and pureed. I rubbed it in and under the drumsticks, sprinkled w/ a little more salt and broiled 5 min to brown.  Then I let bake for 20 min.  I brushed on the sauce (in which I had put 1 T. honey, lime juice, garlic and butter) and let bake for 20 more min.  it was very good, but even w/ the jalapeno, it wasn't very spicy.  Even the 3 year old liked it.  Making the paste ensured that no picky children saw any onions or peppers to turn their nose up to.

very tasty. I added a bit of flour to the herb mix and it made a nice thin, crispy, tasty coating on the chicken.

Yum! Just make sure you don't accidentally roll the chicken in the spices as if you were breading them like I did.  I was out of spices by the time I got done with the second piece of chicken.  It worked out fine eventually, and was it ever good.

This was wonderful!  I had everything on hand (which is a first).  Everything was going quickly until the tragedy happened.  I was mixing together all of the spices together and got a major itch in my eye.  Without even thinking about it I stuck a finger full of cayenne pepper and everything else in my eye.  Thirty minutes later I could see again.  Other than that I did everything like instructed except I seasoned the chicken then let it settle in the refrigerator for about an hour.  Will make again but washing my hands after mixing spices!!!!

This is a great change for chicken.  My family really loves this one.  It's got a nice kick that you can turn up or down.  Make it every few weeks.  Thanks C. Perez.

The teste of this chicken is really terrific, but it's a little dry.  I took the advice of others and cut the chicken into strips, but it still came out dry.  My boyfriend said it was very tasty, and I agreed.  I marinated the chicken strips in the rub for about 2 hours and added the zest of one lime.  Great taste....bad texture.

If you like some spice, this is definitely a great dish to try.  I add a bit extra lime juice while int he pan.  Goes great with margheritas or your favorite chianti!

What a wonderful chicken recipe!  I've made this twice now and it is delicious.  It's so nice because it contains ingredients that I always have on hand.  It is full of flavor.  I do not use the full amount of garlic at the end...just lightly sprinkle.  Awesome!!

Just wanted to let people know that you can do this with a whole chicken. (I didn't have any chicken breasts).  Double the spice mixture (use the recipe converter at the bottom to make it easier)... and rub it all over the chicken as well as inside of the chicken.  Place 2-3 cut-up limes inside the chicken as well.  Put the olive oil and/or butter on top of the chicken.  Put the whole thing in the oven at 400 degrees for about an hour.  Delish.

This recipe was absolutely awesome. Totally blew my girlfriend away. I doubled the cayenne pepper, will probably add even more next time (we really like our food hot).

Wow! This is my favorite chicken recipe. My fiance and I make it ALL the time. I actually like to add more of the spice blend to each piece of chicken. Once the chicken is cooked, I take it out and then add the lime and garlic (I use fresh garlic instead of powdered). I serve it with rice and broccoli and it is always a pleaser!

This recipe was okay, but way too garlicky!  And I'm a garlic lover!  Also, there wasn't enough sauce.  Overall, I think I will keep this recipe but tone it down a little, maybe tinker with the sauce a little to make more.  This is a decent basic recipe.

I pounded the chicken breasts, doubled the spice rub (since it looked a little weak for a "generous" rub, and then made it with white rice made with 2tsp fresh grated ginger and 1 can coconut milk.  The combination was great!

Hubby said it was the best chicken dish I'd ever made (see photo).

I made some changes however: I used a Japanese free-range chicken thigh instead of chicken breast because they have more flavor and are easier to cook.  I also only used half the chicken but smothered on the entire amount of spice mixture to give it an extra kick, and I let the chicken sit with the spice on for a few minutes before cooking.  When frying, I cut down the butter in half to make it less greasy.  

We had it with white rice and Zucchini Mediterranean Style for a lovely dinner.

I truly liked this recipe.  Hubby thought there was just too much "spice".  I used this for a mexican type fajita meal.  I will definately be making again, but reducing the cayenne a bit to suit our tastes...thanks for the post.

I have made this several times now, and we are just crazy about it.  In fact, I have made up a huge batch of the spice mix and keep it in a dredger.

I use about 1 1/2 times the spice mix and twice the lime juice called for.

I usually serve this with Vigo Mexican Rice with Corn and garlic stir fried zucchini for a quick after work meal.

Good flavor.  I just mixed all the ingredients together and let the chicken marinate all day then grilled them out outside on the grill with mesquite wood chips.

Excellent!  I had frozen chicken tenderloins that I just defrosted in the microwave while heating the butter and oil.  I didn't have paprika on hand and didn't add the onion powder.  I used a bit of fresh garlic instead of powder.  We LOVED it.  I had some leftover baked potatoes that I sliced up and cooked in the same pan and it picked up the leftover spices and lime flavor.  Thank you for this recipe!

This was GREAT!  I used chicken "tenders".  PLEASE do not substitute the butter for margarine.  Makes it too oily.  The butter was MUCH better.  Thanks!

Excellent!!  My family loved this.  I actually made a gravy out of the sauce - added some chicken broth and thickener - and served the gravy over bowtie pasta.  Great!  This recipe is a keeper.

Follow the recipe, but double the spice measurements for the rub.

Also add in some garlic powder at the end to thicken the sauce like another user said.

I’ve made this dish twice and it was better the 2nd time. As a matter of fact I’m going to make it again this evening. It’s a quick recipe that yields the best flavor from the chicken. I’m VERY glad that I chose this recipe over the scads of others. Kudos to the submitter!

My husband LOVED this recipe! I doubled the spice rub as suggested in other reviews, added the rub and set the chicken back in the fridge for a few hours and let it rest on the counter for 30 minutes before cooking. I will be making this again!

This was excellent with a few changes. I doubled the spice recipe and completely left off the garlic at the end. I can't imagine having used it, would have been way too much. I used oregano instead of thyme and left out the parsley. Served with lime cilantro rice and pinto beans with bacon, jalapeño, and onion. BIG hit!

I just made it!  Yummy!  A hit with all in my family- an absolute rarity.  I did as others suggested and doubled the spice mix to cover 5 chicken breasts.  I used garlic powder even though I had fresh garlic on hand just to see how the recipe as written would be.  Loved it!  The kids were mad there wouldn't be any leftover for their lunchboxes today.  This one is a keeper!

This recipe was a big hit. I have never seen my son so quiet at dinner. On his first bite he spread his eyes open so wide nodded to me yes and gave me a thumbs up. My husband said it was extremely delicious. Most definitely making it again.

This may have not been the worst recipe I ever made but it's definitely in the top two.

I made it exactly as written wasting $12 worth of free range chicken.

It was nasty tasting, tough and dry.  UGH.  I ate one breast because I was hungry and threw out the remaining four.  Man, I hate when that happens.

next time i would double the spices, there was not enough to cover the breasts.  Also you have large, thick breasts i  would butterfly them to get that great flavor in the meat.
other than than the flavor was very good.

This was a great fresh tasting recipe that was so easy even my kids had a hand in making it. The only change I made was instead of chicken, I used a couple of pounds of fresh gulf shrimp and grilled them on my Weber to near perfection. It was a fresh and spicy meal with a smoky kick.

Really liked this and was surprised at cooking time and how moist the chicken was.  I only did 2 boneless breasts yet used the same amount of spices after reading a couple of reviews.  Excellent flavor!

Loved this! Doubled the spice to cover a bit more chicken than the recipe called for.   Could have even added more of the spice mixture. But instead, sliced the chicken breasts while in pan and swirled around  so some pieces were spicier than others, which served our crowd nicely. Some added salsa verde to their meal for a bit more moisture and heat. Served on corn tortillas or used as chicken topping for salads.

My husband absolutely loves this chicken. I cut the chicken into strips then coat them in the spices.  After cooking I serve it on soft tortilla with a mango salsa.  The spicy kick of the chicken & the sweet mango delicious.

We eat lots of chicken and were getting tired of traditional ways of preparing chicken as well as casseroles. I was looking for a good chicken recipe that could be cooked on top of the stove, not fried, baked, roasted, or included in a casserole. (Time is a factor.)
This was a great recipe. It was delicious and easy to prepare. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs as I am not fond of chicken breast. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written with few changes. I did double the recipe for the seasoning. The chicken was delicious! Even my elderly mother enjoyed it and she is very particular about her chicken. It tasted like I spent a lot of time preparing it, but I didn't. I served it with sides of lemon-garlic rice with rosemary and broccoli. Yum! I will definitely make this again,and will probably serve on Sunday when the family comes for dinner.

Delicious!  Although I did double the spices and only  used 2 large boneless, skinless thighs.  Chopped them up and topped a green salad with it.  Very, very good.  I plan to use this recipe with pork chops too.

My husband and son both loved it and that’s hard to do! My son even asked for the recipe. I will be making this recipe again.

My husband and I LOVE this. I usually at least double the spices because I like the chicken to be totally covered in them. Definitely stir often in the last little bit of time after adding the lime juice. Delicious with rice and broccoli. Super easy and so good!

Amazing! I used fresh herbs from our garden, and this is now my favorite chicken dish to make!! Paired it with grilled eggplant and tomato-cucumber salad. Perfect!

I made this, in a pampered chef press pan, but it was delicious!!  The next night though, I took the left over chicken and cut it in small pieces and added it to 4 cups of cooked rice, added some butter, one can of cream of mushroom soup and seasoned the entire mixture just as I did the chicken. I also added some frozen peas and carrots. The entire family loves it!!

Really delicious,the butter adds a real richness to the dish. I added some large prawns for the last few minutes of cooking and some extra chilli,just because we love both! Can see this being a favourite for a long time.

We loved this.  Followed other reviews and doubled the spice mix, using fresh garlic paste and a bit of olive oil to make a paste.  Let the rub sit on the chicken breast tenders for about an hour at room temp.  Garnished with fresh cilantro and green onions.  Used a splash of tequila to deglaze, then the juice of one lime.  Plenty spicy, but not too much for our taste.

I was really looking forward to making this dish. Heads up, it is not spicy (at all), tastes nothing of garlic, and just gives the hint of lime. Living in the southwest, this is very disappointing.

This is just delicious. I usually only make 2 chicken breasts but leave the rest of the ingredients the same. Simple, easy and so so good. I really appreciate this quick and easy method for cooking breasts and I can't wait to try it with other seasonings as well!

Really like the dry-rub ingredients, but needed to make more as these amounts were not enough to cover the chicken adequately.  I will make a big batch and keep in the pantry for another quick dinner...can use on shrimp and pork chops too!!

This is a really tasty recipie. We like things spicy so the hot spices were trebled ( measure by hand so exactly how much more is approximate), the rest is to taste. This is a nice refreshing way to jazz up chicken.

This is the simplest, best chicken I have ever made and trust me, that's saying something when I make chicken breast 3 days out of the week. My 20 month old even asked for more, which is not something she generally does when it comes to the protein portion of dinner. The only thing I did different was omit the second addition of garlic powder. I was almost out so I decided to just drizzle the lime juice and I'm so glad I did. It was delicious and I can't wait to make it again!

Really flavorful! Substituted red pepper flakes for cayenne pepper which reduced the heat a bit, and cilantro for parsley.

The recipe tasted delicious. The second time I made it though, I cubed the chicken rather than making it as breasts and I liked it better since there was more seasoning overall.

I did not like this. All I could taste was the spice mixture on the chicken. The flavors did not integrate into the chicken. I think it was the dried thyme that was so offensive. I did like the lime sauce that I also added some chicken broth to. I will try a variation of this recipe with different kind of spice mix.

Made it exactly as described, and it was perfect. Even the toddler liked it.  The only snag was that the chicken breast halves where we shop are enormous, so the cooking time ran a bit longer than the recipe's estimate.  Worth the wait, though!

The chicken was super moist, but kind of a bland seasoning blend. I really spent a lot of time nursing these babies to make sure they'd be full of flavor, and the payoff was not really worth it.

Delicious recipe over all! Although I did have to double the amount of all the spices. I recommend serving with a cilantro-lime rice and have the chicken served with diced tomatoes and lettuce on a tortilla shell.

I only used 2 large breasts. I had to triple the quantities of the spice blend in order to get a great dry rub/full coverage. My wife said it was the best chicken she has ever had. I would have rated 5 stars had the spice blend portions been higher.

The first time I made it, medium heat on stove-top was too high, which blackened the chicken. Also, i spritzed too much lime on chicken, which overpowered it. Second time i made it, i cooked it on stove-top with heat between low and medium; it slowly sizzled/simmered. I spritzed less lime and added shredded cheese on top of chicken during the last 1-2 minutes of cooking. Made all the difference in the world.

This was delicious! I used two breasts pounded out until they were about 3/4 inch thick. I followed the recipe exactly, but did add about a 1/2 cup of chicken broth (I used vegetable broth) to the last 5 minutes with the lime like several other reviewers  recommended.  I couldn't believe how tender and juicy the chicken was!  Great recipe - thank you!

P.S.  The sauce is yummy over a side of egg noodles! :)

I can't tell you how much my two picky eater boys in the family, my husband and my son, loved this chicken.  I can't ever make anything right... I burn water! This was so simple, so easy, and amazing.

Good recipe and very simple. I made it with boneless, skinless chicken thighs and I put it in the oven at 400 degrees for about 20-30 minutes instead of cooking on the stove. I did add a little (1/4 cup) chicken broth to the pan to keep them moist. Served with jasmine rice and a salad. Very nice mean.

Seriously...delicious.   One of my favorite chicken dishes.  Instead of adding the oil with the butter in the pan.  I used some of the oil to lightly coat and massage into the chicken.

This was phenomenal! Made for company and it was a hit! The only thing i changed was the garlic. I used fresh since powder was not on hand. This one's a keeper for sure! Thanks for sharing!

I pretty much doubled the recipe but quadrupled the spice mixture, based on others' comments about not being enough in quantity to cover the chicken breasts, which was true for me as well. It all came out great! Whole family of picky palates loved it, too. 

I couldn't taste the lime but I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. Served it alongside of sauteed greenbeans and garlic, and plain white rice as the starch of the meal. So good!

Made this recipe just to try something new and I'm so glad I did. My children and husband  absolutely loved it. So much so they are asking me when they can have it again. I will be adding this recipe to my box today.

This is a really easy, fast, and delicious meal to make. I paired it with jasmine rice, and fresh, steamed summer squash. I cook most of the meals in my house (I'm 15 years old.) I cooked this for my father and his guests. They absolutely loved it, and I will definitely be making it again.

I tried this for the first time after reading the reviews. I doubled the spices and also added a little more butter (1 more TBSP) and lime juice (1 more TBSP) to make more sauce. OMG, it was to die for! Loved it. Just enough of a bite from the cayenne. Will definitely keep this one.

This was really good as far as spice goes.  I couldn't really taste the lime though.  Next time I'll add more lime juice.  I served it with couscous and Broccoli and cauliflower and salad.  It was yummy!

Recipe was good... I wouldn't rave about it. Had a spicy kick which was nice. Good for a quick meal. Prep time quick and easy.  I did add a little chicken broth to make a sauce and a dab of butter to thicken it up.

Yummy!  My husband and I didn't speak while we ate which is rare and a sign of a really good dinner.  I only cooked 1 chicken breast, cut in 4's, and the rub was just enough.  I can't even imagine this being enough for 4!!  Although I don't believe in sprinkling, I rub that stuff on so I can taste it.  I did cut down the garlic to just 1 teaspoon at the beginning and I think all the flavors really came thru

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  Just the right amount of seasoning.
Made this last night for dinner.  My burner must be hotter than most as it didn't take 6 minutes to get browned so instead, after browning I put it into the oven at 350 degrees to finish cooking, about 15-20 minutes in the oven was just right.
I will definately be making this recipe again, and again!

I made this recipe last night with slight changes. I used boneless, skinless thighs instead of breast. I didn't have paprika so I omitted that. I also put in 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp dried parsley and 1/2 tsp garlic powder. Instead of using the mixture as dry rub, I added 2 tbsp of light virgin olive oil and then the lime to make a marinade. I marinated the thighs for about 2 hours, although it would be best to marinade for at least 6 hours. Then I grilled it instead of sautéing. It was delicious!

I really liked this recipe, but I didn't let my chicken thaw all the way, so it took much longer to cook. I also am trying to watch my sodium intake so halved the amount of salt & used a little tumeric, which I don't think changed the flavor, but think too much butter was in the recipe, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.

I'm not sure if it's fair to give this recipe 5 stars because I really went rogue with it to make it healthier, but I generally followed the ingredients. First, I doubled the spices and sprinkled that over my chicken breasts. Next, I put all of the lime juice on top of the raw, seasoned chicken. Then, I ditched the butter, using more olive oil in its place. I put all of the oil on top of the seasoned chicken, covered the bowl, and let it marinate for a little over an hour. Last, I put the chicken and all of the juices from the bowl on a rimmed baking sheet and baked the chicken at 400 degrees until it was cooked (about 30 minutes.) The changes I made were really accidental (I should probably learn to READ directions) but the result was beyond delicious and absolutely a keeper!!! I can't wait to try the recipe as written!

Excellent recipe as written.  Thank you for submitting this wonderful dish.  I used only two breasts with the same amount of spices and lime juice but reduced the butter, olive oil, and garlic salt accordingly.  Very tasty!

This was fantastic!  I served as soft tacos.  Per other reviews I doubled the spice ingredients and added about 1 ½ tsp ground cumin.  I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces put in a Ziploc bag added a drizzle of olive oil, dumped in the spice mix and mushed it all together.  I put the chicken in the fridge for about 2 hrs.  Thirty minutes before cook time I took the chicken out of the fridge and let it rest on the counter.  I sautéed the chicken in 3 batches with the olive oil and butter.  After browning the chicken I kept warm in the oven.  I deglazed the pan with the lime juice and about 1/3 c. of chicken stock. I then add the chicken back to the pan and let simmer for about 15 -20 min so the sauce could reduce and coat the chicken.  I served in warm soft tortilla shells with lettuce, tomato, cheese, Crema Mexicana and several healthy splashes of Salsa Picante de Chile Habanero!! Be warned if you don’t like it spicy don’t add the Habanero. I served this with Black Bean and Couscous Salad (also from this site) which was also very good.  The entire family loved it and has requested that I make this often.

Found this dish to be very good, and very quick and easy to make! Followed the recipe almost perfectly this time, except that my wife doesn't like spicy foods so I replaced most of the Cayenne Pepper with Chili Pepper instead. Next time I make this, I will put on the dry rub and a bit of lemon juice on the chicken a couple of hours ahead of time and let it marinade in a baggies in the fridge.

Loved it. I read some other reviews that recommended doubling the amount of spice to sprinkle and I would agree. Cut back on the salt a little tho. Otherwise we will be making this again. Super easy and a good quick meal

Easy & flavorful!  Everyone loved it and the seasoning was great!  I will add this to the regular rotation.  Only change I made was to reduce the chipolte pepper for those who can't take the spice & used fresh Italian parsley added with the lime juice at the end.  Delicious!

Spices were very good - I only made two cutlets but still doubled the spices - otherwise, it would not have been enough.  Chicken was good but there is no way lime and garlic makes any kind of sauce. I used fresh lime - only 1 tablespoon and it was so sour - not edible at all. Luckily I read some reviews and added chicken broth, but I added a whole can just to get the sour taste out.  I would make this again, but not with that "sauce" - it is way too sour.

This is an excellent recipe.  Cooking times were right on.  My only suggestion is to double the spices so you have enough to cover all the chicken.

Had nice flavours but my chicken breast cuts weren't nice.  They were way too dry and hard to cut into.  I'll try again with better cuts.  Update:  Made this for a second time and it was very, very good.  It had a bit of a kick to it so maybe I'll cut back on the hot spices a bit for hubby's sake!  Added about 1/4 cup of chicken broth.

Definitely double the powder mixture or you won't have enough to coat both sides thoroughly. 
I also added 1/2 cup of chicken broth and and extra tablespoon or so of butter to give me more broth to work with.
Great recipe with lots of flavor!!

Better than most places that charge you top dollar. Great chicken, but a important key is to buy the individual tyson ones that are individually wrapped and let defrost in a bowl of warm / hot water.

My family loved this recipe. The chicken was tasty and moist.  I doubled the spices as recommended by other reviewers.  I also substituted garlic salt for garlic powder since others said it was too garlicky. When the chicken had finished cooking, I added 1/4 cup of broth (turkey since it's what I had) and drizzled honey over the chicken.  It was very good!  I will make this with these changes again.

Great recipe that the whole family loved! I agree with others comments though. You definitely should add 1/3 chicken broth to make the chicken moist and I really think pounding the chicken improved the dish. I will make this dish again for sure!!!

Very good, maybe tone down the spice a little bit. Kids definitely thought it was too spicy. Lime juice was great - definitely use all three tablespoons.

Super tasty, I reduced the salt and garlic as suggested by others. Advise not over coating the chicken with the spices until you figure out how much suits you. I use the juice of one lime, the limes I use are a nice size, app. 2.5 inches long and 2 in. in diameter. Give it a whirl, doubt you'll be disappointed, my entire family enjoys this recipe.

This was very good and easy to put together....I did cut the chicken and tenderize to cook easier as reviews said to and used just olive oil and no butter, I served with vege salad with lemon/lime dressing, It was enjoyable and healthy!

Delicious! Just make sure your chicken breasts aren't too thick. Mine got a little overdone cuz my chicken breasts were really thick in spots. Cook on medium like the recipe says. I served mine is soft tortilla bowls filled with the sliced chicken, spanish rice, black beans, corn, shredded cheese, and salsa verde. Yummy! Can't wait to make this again!!! 17 year old son loved it!

I've made this recipe several times now.  Very simple and if your meat isn't frozen, can be ready in about 10 minutes.  It's one of my go-to meals when I want a good meal after work but don't want to spend a lot of time.  My husband loves it as is, but sometimes I reduce the red pepper, black pepper, and paprika because I don't like as much heat.  I've used chicken tenders instead of breasts and the only difference is cook time.  There always ends up several tablespoons of "sauce" in the pan after the chicken is cooked, so we like to pair the dish with mashed potatoes and use the sauce as gravy.

My very picky husband likes this – second time making it – I cut chicken breasts into strips, covered with spice combination, with a little olive oil in frying pan began cooking, no – poured lime juice (in the bottle easy lime juice) I passed on the butter. The sauce was so GOOD – but not sticking, so I took a cube of chicken bullion with a teaspoon of corn starch and ½ cup water - oh so good – I spooned modest amount of sauce as saturating as possible on my strips – this is on my ‘husband will eat this’ list! Next time will make more sauce and serve this on rice or noodles.

This was outstanding! I always read the reviews before I try a recipe. I did double the spices and I cut the large chicken breasts in half and the pounded them slightly. I used crushed garlic instead of the garlic powder and added minced onion and jalapeño pepper in the last five minutes. All suggestions in the reviews. It is a yum. Tender, moist and snappy.

Made this last night and it was outstanding!  Very easy, quick and flavorful.  I like mine with lots of flavor, so I went heavy on the spice mixture.  I would agree that you need to double the spice recipe if you want to have enough for more than 3 or 4 chicken breasts.

This one is definitely on my list to make again, and again, and again.  Loved the flavor combination.  I did add a splash of chicken broth as others have suggested, but that was just to keep the sauce from overcooking.

I made this recipes a few days ago and I tweaked it a little bit. I used Cajun seasoning instead of Cayenne Pepper. I didn't use the lime juice either. I took some minced garlic and rubbed it on both sides of the chicken. It tasted amazing! It had a spicy taste and a tangy taste.

This is terrific I have made it twice. The second time I cooked it on the grill. I seasoned the chicken, put it on the grill and used the garlic lime mixture as a basting sauce. We liked it even better that way. Do give it a try if you like to grill.

I'm basing this on how my mother made this. It was good but we increased the liquid so we had something to put on our rice. This is a great recipe and pretty quick too.

Spicy and I loved it! I omitted salt, parsley and thyme (was out of thyme and parsley).  I added oregano.  I used healthy balance oil instead of butter.  This would make a great sandwich meat too (for a Cajun chicken type of sandwich).  I will definitely make it again and probably on the grill next time! I served it over salad.

It was amazing! My whole family loved it! Even my picky husband that doesn't like spicy food said that he loved it! Just added a little extra salt, put it on a warm tortilla with sour cream and cheese, and if you like sauteed peppers and onions. Will definitely make it again!

This was a great "base" recipe for me to use.  I had some of the ingredients on hand and subbed in the rest (new kitchen not fully stocked).  Fresh lemon for lime, chili powder for cayenne, and no oregano.  I also used a little less salt since lemon can be a salt replacement.  Since we like a lot of flavor, I tripled the seasoning and doubled the butter. We loved the flavor combination of garlic/citrus/heat.  I also served baked sweet potatoes plain that we seasoned with some of the pan drippings.  My husband said even though he doesn't normally like baked sweet potatoes, he really like them with this seasoning. Based on our experience and the other reviews, this is a great recipe to customize to your personal taste while giving you some general guidelines.

So good! Perfect combination of spices, and the lime juice cuts the heat just enough. We like this so much that we made a large batch of the spice mix and put it in a jar in our spice cabinet. Tasty!

Made this for dinner last night. I also pounded then marinated the breasts with Half the lime juice. We love spicy but it bothers hubby's tummy so I halved the cayenne but doubled the black pepper. Awesome. The family wants to know when I will be making this again.

Only change was that I decreased the cayenne just a touch preseasoned the chicken breasts that I had planed in half and pounded to be a little thinner. Sauteed in olive oil in batches then deglazed the pan with the lime juice and butter. I did triple the sauce for 7 full breasts (14 pieces when planed). To make sure they were done and the sauce flavored everything, I put the chicken back in the sauce and covered it and let it braise in the oven so it would hold for late arrivals. Very good. Husband loved it and a picky 2 year old who doesn't normally like chicken asked for 2nds.

My Husband And I Made This Tonight.  We Love Lime So We Made Some Small Adjustments To Make This Delicious Recipe That Much Better.  We Didn't Have Chicken Breasts So We Used Chicken Tenders.  We Added A Zest Of Two Limes.  Most Of The Zest Went Into The Spice Mixture That Was Put On The Outside Of The Chicken.  We Put Some Of The Zest In The Sauce.  We Also Juiced Two Limes For The Sauce And Added 2 1/2 Tsp. Of Garlic Powder To The Sauce.  We Paired It With A Few Sides: Rice, Black Beans, And A Corny Lime Salad We Made Up On The Spot.  I Think The Next Time We Will Take Some Advice We Saw On Some Of The Reviews And Add Some Chicken Stock To Make More Of A Sauce For The Chicken And The Rice.  All In All It Was A Good Recipe And We Will Be Having It Again And Again.  Thanks So Much For Posting It.

I liked it - easy and fast.  I put the lime on right away (without adding the extra garlic powder) and baked it in the oven, covered, for 30 min. at 190 celcius.  No butter/oil required.  I'll make it again.

Had this tonight and I disagree with those who said there weren't enough spices to cover 4 pieces of chicken. I had exactly the right amount. My only change was to use 2 teaspoons of jarred minced garlic rather than powder. I love the way this sauce reduces and lightly coats the chicken. My 9 year old liked this and said he didn't find it too spicy, and he doesn't like spicy foods at all. This is definitely going to be made again. Thanks for sharing.

This was a GREAT recipe, I did everything but put onion powder in the seasoning blend but that's only because I didn't have any. And instead of using whole chicken breasts, I cut the chicken breasts into strips to have them go further. And for the sides, I used fettucine strips and green beans and cornbread. Very good supper for the family.

I made this for a work potluck and received rave reviews! I took six jumbo chicken breasts and pounded them so they were semi-flat, then cut them in half to make 12 servings. I then rubbed the spice mixture on both sides and refrigerated them overnight (instead of tripling the mixture, I quadrupled the mixture for an extra kick). I threw them on the grill for lunch, and basted them on both sides with the garlic and lime juice upon turning them. We then ate them as sandwiches. They turned out spectacular!!!

I mixed the spices with crushed rice crispy,s, covered the chicken breasts in mayonnaise and then rolled them in the spiced rice crispy mixture and baked at 180 C for about 25 minutes, Utterly delicious crispy and spicy on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside.

Reeeeeeeally good.  Use the extra broth listed if you like a bit of sauce.  Doubling the lime was fine,t he chicken did not dry out.  I served this with lemon ginger rice and corn.

I have tried this recipe many, many times, and each time it was a hit.  However, when I decided to try it with one-inch thick pork chops, I think it was the best ever!  My husband raved that this was the best pork chop he'd ever eaten.  Now when I say I'm gonna make it, he always says "You're using pork chops, right?"  Either way, you can't lose.  This is a winner all around.

This was amazing! Slightly spicy with a citrus kick. I love anything with lime added, so I'm a little biased, but I will definitely be making this again!

Very tasty.  we cut up the chicken into smaller pieces and then pounded thin. We then applied the run and let it sit over night.  I added a little tequila and chicken broth for the sauce.

Just made this for the second time! Wow is it good. I double all the spices except the salt. Then when I browned them in the skillet and turned them over, I added fresh chopped garlic instead of the powder, then sprinkled with the lime juice. My new container of cayenne must have been really hot because this chicken was spicy hot and just the way we like it! Great recipe....I will make often!

Had high hopes but just didn't like it much.  I did use the garlic powder on the rub and real garlic in the sauce.  I let the rub sit on a few hours in the fridge.  But I think it was just an combo of spiced that I didn't think worked with chicken. And it just seemed to be missing something.  I think it might work better on red meat or pork.

i loved this. Easy and quick and looks impressive. I used Grape Seed oil instead of olive oil and left the butter out. Also didn't put salt in it. I served it with a great brown rice recipe I got from ALLRECIPES. Will make this often.

We were looking for a recipe for the bbq grill.  I modified this recipe to accommodate that.  After adding the rub to the chicken, I put it in flat dish, and drizzled the remaining ingredients over the chicken, covered it and let it marinate about 6 hours in the refrigerator.  Just before grilling, I added another squeeze of lime to each chicken piece.  It came out delicious!

Really nice. I am on weight reduction diet - my husband is not and does not like chicken breast. I prepared this for myself -- husband had sausage!!! My dinner was much better than his. I had a 6oz breast which was 6 points on Weight Watchers; still had point left for a glass of wine.

This recipe was very good and easy to make. I doubled the seasonings, as suggested by another cook, because I like a lot of flavor in my food. My family really enjoyed the flavor and I had the leftovers for lunch. That's saying a lot because I usually won't eat leftover chicken. It was even better the next day. Will definitely make this agan.

Yum!  this was so delicious - it's one of my favorite newly discovered recipes on allrecipes.com in a long time.  It's so easy to make as well.  I did add the 1/3 cup chicken broth along with my lime and I just sprinked the garlic powder on top (didn't put on the full amount listed).  Also, I only used 2 chicken breasts but I used the full amount of spices.  I will definitely be making this again!

quick, easy, tasty. made it w/o the butter, a little extra olive oil and chicken tenders as opposed to breasts and it was still excellent, possibly even tastier than the straight recipe.

Very fast and easy.  I doubled the spices are per other's advice but I made the mistake of doubling the salt also.  Way too salty!  Next time I will keep the original salt amount.  I also sauteed the chicken in 1/3 cup chicken broth along with the lime juice and that made a nice sauce to spoon over the chicken.  Will definitely make this again.

This was delicious. Two teaspoons of garlic powder seemed like a lot to me (and I *love* garlic), so I halved it. I also used a slightly smaller measurement of thyme because mine was ground. If your chicken breasts are on the larger side, you will want to slightly increase the cooking time. For those saying there wasn't enough liquid, given the oiliness of it, I think it's supposed to be more of a basting liquid than a sauce. However, you could easily deglaze the pan with some chicken stock and whisk in a little flour and milk to make a gravy. Other than possibly having too much garlic as written, I thought this was fantastic. It was so easy and I always have all the ingredients on hand, and the results are really flavorful (really nice with a whole wheat roll to wipe up the excess). I will definitely make it again.

My whole family enjoyed this. Two adults and four kids (9 down to 4).  I would make it next time with a bit less cayenne pepper. I may have fudged a bit and added more than was called for.  Overall great easy recipe.

This recipe was good, but the garlic powder at the end seemed REALLY excessive.  I used 3/4 tsp and it was really good.  I like the spice and lime.  Also, I used coconut oil instead of the butter and oil.

Easy to make and full of flavor. I actually  baked these covered in foil for the first 30 minutes then I removed the foil to let them cook for another 30 mins. They were very moist and tasty. A quick dinner meal that I will make again.

I've made this a few times and honestly, this is amazing!   You may want to double up on the spices, really good but not enough.  It's great as is but I prefer baking it at 375 for about 40-45 mins, less messy.  I also prefer boneless thighs over breasts because they're juicier.  Since I bake them, I put tiny dots of butter under each thigh along with the evoo, added fresh diced garlic on top and some red pepper flakes.  Forgot the lime juice last time but it was still delicious.

This recipeis FANTASTIC!! So simple!  I added a 1/4 tsp cumin in addition to the other dry spices for the rub, and I also let the rub sit on the chicken for about 20 min before cooking.  I served it with steamed corn tortilla, greens and goat cheese crumble...topped with a little salsa verde and more lime. This will become a staple in my house!!

Oh my, was this delicious! It wasn't very spicy IMO (and I can handle the heat!), but the chicken itself was tender, juicy, and was flavorful. Next time, I'll kick the heat up a bit. Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious.

Definitely make a double batch of the spices.

I cut my breast in half and pounded thin.

Added chicken broth with the lime juice to give it some more sauce.

Just not a personal favorite for our family. I think I would eliminate the oil, the chicken didn't end up as coated as the recipe made it sound like it would.

Very good! Took other tips and flattened chicken, cut back garlic powder & used half a fresh limes worth for juice. Not too spicy or sour just right.

Good recipes. Next time I will cook it at medium-low temperature and leave out the butter. Might also add some chicken broth too, to make it more tender and create a sauce.

I used thighs with skin and bone in.  They needed to be covered and simmered in the sauce for 10 minutes, then another 5 minutes uncovered to get done.  

I used Nellie and Joe's Key Lime Juice and smoked paprika just because that's what I had.

Delicious!

I don't think I like the taste of lime with my chicken...so take my review with a grain of salt.  I mixed the rub as directed and covered the chicken in it.  I first sauteed oil (no butter) and some garlic and onions. I then browned the meat (dark) and added some veggies (red, yellow, orange peppers, celery, tomatoes).  whenever the pan got a bit to dry, I deglazed with some white wine or chicken broth.  1.5T lime juice added at the end.  I think maybe the tomatoes and the lime was too much?  If I repeat this recipe, I'll omit the tomatoes.

Very simple and quick to make.

I didn't have any onion powder so I just used real onions and added a splash of tequila :)

Yummo!

I followed the recipe as best I could with what I had on hand. I didn't have any cayenne, so I used a little cumin and chilli powder instead. I also brushed the chicken with a tiny bit of honey before I seasoned it. I only used half the butter, more on accident than anything, and I think I'll try to remember next time, cause the chicken was a little dry. Of course my husband loves his chicken to be dry for some reason, so that was fine for him, but for normal people, definitely keep the butter! I also used fresh squeezed limes for the juice. I don't know if it makes a huge difference, but hey, why not? Thanks for the recipe. I'll be making this again very soon!

I used thick chicken breasts so like another reviewer I had to cover the dish and cook it another 10 minutes. Unlike that reviewer, I doubled the cayenne and still did not find it spicy.  Different tastes I guess.  I did add broth and tequila to the sauce.  Over all it came out well. Next time I'll use minced garlic and add jalapeño.

This disappears quickly at our house. I have also made this as a marinade. I used 1 1/2 pounds of chicken thighs, covered them with the spice mixture and the lime juice. The next day I dotted butter over the top and baked it in the oven. Very quick and easy, not to mention delicious.

This is so delicious. I found that making the marinade by adding olive oil and a bit of ground ginger then letting it set at room temperature for an hour intensifies the flavor. I paired this up with coconut white rice. Boil in a bag white rice in half water and half coconut milk. Add dried chives to the rice.  Gave it a carribbean flavor. *this dish is not for the weak-tongued* it is spicy!!!

I tried this for the first time and it was great! My husband probably liked it more than me! And it was so easy and simple to make. I did slightly tweak this though by adding more ground black pepper and cayenne pepper to make the dish more spicy. This change though is a personal preference as I like everything very spicy. Will definitely be making this again!

LOVED this recipe and so did my family.  I left out the butter for health/calorie reasons and I mixed up two batches of the spices because I had large chicken breasts.  Dipped the breasts in the first batch on one side and sprinkled the second batch on top.  Did not use the additional garlic power for this reason.  Poked holes in my cooked breasts before adding the lime juice.  Served with brown rice that I mixed in the broth from the chicken.  Delicious!!

Made pretty much as directed, except I had thick breasts so I pounded them down slightly. Simmered them for 15 min in the sauce covered.Removed chicken,added 2/3 cup chicken stock and added a slurry of corn starch and flour at the end to tighten up the sauce.

This is so tasty! It was a hit even with the kids. I made it exactly as stated except with chicken tenders. When the chicken was cooked I added another round of the butter, olive oil and garlic powder, and then added pasta and tossed, and served as a side with a slight dusting of Parmesan. Yummy!

I don't like spicy food so I skipped the black pepper and only put in a pinch of cayenne and it turned out amazing.  My whole family loved it even my 2 year old who hates everything!

This is the BEST chicken recipe.  I used thighs instead of breasts and 1 tablespoon of butter to 2 tablespoons of extra virgin coconut oil.  The coconut oil gave it a hint of sweet to go with the savory and it was delicious!

The family enjoyed this dish, served over a bed of shite rice. I word about the spice mix, it is VERY potent. I doubled the batch to accomodate a larger amount of chicken. I would say that you could stick to the original amount for 4-6 servings. It has very good flavor, but if you overdo it, you end up overpowering everything else. I also skipped the second addition of garlic powder, and I am glad I did, it probably would have blown our heads off! When they say "sprinkle miture" they mean it. If you "coat" it, you will probably end up with the same super-spicy results. We will be making this again for sure, I will make sure to watch the spice levels the next time.

I cut the cayenne pepper down to 1/8 tsp and it was still too spicy hot for me, but I don't like anything that is really hot.  I was a little surprised at how much heat there was even cutting it down by half.  I guess I should just put in a pinch.  Nevertheless, I liked this and would fix it again, just with less cayenne pepper.

Great recipe. I agree with other reviewers double the spice and use chicken broth for extra sauce.  I also would use more lime juice.  Thanks for sharing.

We made this last night, and it was a real hit.  I ended up having to quadruple the spices to put on 4 chicken breasts, and also added 1/3 cup chicken stock at the end.  Only problem was that it was too salty.  In the future, I will add the chicken stock, and cut back on the salt.  Also, while I quadrupled the spices, I did not do that with the cayenne.  I think it would've been too spicy then.  I thought the heat was just right.  Will definitely be making this again!

I totally went off on a beaten path with this one. One thing led to another and next I knew I had a casserole. Where I started wrong was pulling boneless ckn thighs instead of breasts, BUT IT TURNED OUT SOOO DELISH!!! It's a must share...

After cooking the thighs as directed in the recipe, I cut them into chunks letting them shred the was they wanted. I sauteed 1/2 each of a red, yellow, and orange pepper. Threw in a 1/2 can of black beans, corn, and jalapenos letting them saute in a little of the seasoning mentioned in the recipe as well as a squirt of lime until peppers were just tender... The I took a box of Zatarain's Black Bean and Rice and stirred it into my veggies (cooking as directed on the box w/ less water). 

While the rice was fluffing, I decided to make a cheese sauce out of Hollandaise. Now this is the secret, as the hollandaise was starting to thicken I added pico de gallo style salsa to it, cilantro and mexican style shredded chz (can't tell ya cup measurements as I just added a little bit at a time until I reached the desired texture). cooked until chz was melted and hollandaise was thickened.

Then I pulled out my casserole dish and stirred in the ckn and my rice creation, topped it with my chz mixture and popped it in the oven at 375* for about 20 mins, turned my oven on to broil LO and hit the top layer for a sec to make the chz layer just lightly browned and bubbly. Topped with some grn chives and ate with tortillas... REALLY WORTH A TRY!!!! SOOOO YUMMY

Good and quick! I pounded the chicken breasts to let them cook more evenly. I doubled the recipe but did not need to double the oil/butter. I finished them in the oven at 350 instead of on the stove until internal temp read 160. I did add chicken broth (about 1/3 c. for this amt.) and thickened it with a little cornstarch on the stove after baking. Very good!

It severely lacked spice/flavor. I would definitely almost double the spices called for, smelled amazing while cooking but that smell didn't carry through on the flavor. I also would use less butter/olive oil, makes it healthier but also gives the chicken a bit more of a crust. Recipe has potential just not fully there yet.

Just the right amount of delicious with a little spicy.  I used the recipe but only used 3 chicken breasts so I didn't add as much garlic powder at the end.  So yummy with a veggie side and Corona. :)

Very tasty! Made a few changes to the recipe based on other reviews. Added 1/4 cup of chicken stock and some minced jalapeno peppers near the end. Removed chicken and reduced the sauce. Added a nice kick to the chicken. Very yummy, will make again!

He loved it! I approximated all the spices, left out the parsley, and used 1 garlic clove + garlic salt - basically what I could manage from the pantry. And more like 1 1/2 tbsp butter. Served with black beans, brown rice, cilantro, and corn salad.

Nice flavor, not very spicy at all. My 20 month old son was even able to eat it.

This is our new favorite chicken dish, perhaps even one of our favorite dinner dishes.  It is definitely spicy, so beware.  I did increase all the 1/4 measurements to 1/2 and next time, I believe I will add 3 Tbl of chicken broth.  This is soooo good.

I used skinless thighs, and added a little chicken stalk and diced fresh garlic to the pan.  I squeezed another lime half over cooked chicken, the popped them in the broiler for about a minute to crisp up the top.  It's very tasty, but I wouldn't consider it spicy at all.

This was AWESOME!!  Even my little boys (ages 4 and 6) loved it!  I did it a little different.  I took fresh garlic and put it in the food processor (actually, I probably used 5 or 6 cloves from a package of already peeled garlic I needed to use up), added a few tablespoons of olive oil, minced that up, added half of a small onion, minced that up, added the salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, then added some fresh parsley (about a handful unchopped) and a some fresh thyme I had leftover from another recipe.  Haven't a clue how much thyme, just 3 or 4 sprigs, and mixed it all up in a food processor.  Then I took chicken breasts, cut them in half (to make 2 thin slices), coated all the chicken with the paste and then cooked them on the skillet.  When they were browned and cooked through, I took them out, added 1/2 C or so chicken broth with the lime juice and deglazed the pan.  Then added the chicken back in the pan to coat with the glaze and finish cooking.  Plated them and poured the glaze over the top.  DELISH!!  Will be making this a regular at our house!!

This is killer!  The only modification I made to this recipe was to deglaze the pan at the end with chicken broth and thicken slightly for a sauce.  Great over rice or pasta.

Thanks for a tasty chicken recipe! I did use fresh garlic as I really don't like the powder and can taste it a mile away. I also had fresh thyme and parsley on hand so I used it as well.  As others suggested I added tequila (1 tbsp) with the lime juice.  My chicken was very thick, so after adding the lime I had to cook it about 10 more minutes instead of the recommended 5.  Because of the extended cooking time the sauce reduced down to a very nice glaze on the chicken. I was very pleased. My husband and I both really enjoyed the flavors, and that is saying a lot - I'm not a big fan of chicken recipes typically.  Thanks again for something I will be making again and again!

Made this dish for dinner tonight and it appears to be a hit .. instead of using the combination of spices listed I noticed that they were similar to Emerils Essance recipe .. I sliced the the chicken breast in half lengh wise, seasoned with the essence and pan fried in the olive oil and butter. Rather then using garlic powder in the sauce, I used chopped fresh garlic which I feel brought out more flavor .. served with couscous and a veg .. will make again

I should really give myself one star...not sure what I did to mess it up...I just didn't care for it and neither did my husband.  Whenever a recipe gets rave reviews on this site I think it MUST be good, so I try it out.  On very rare occasions, I end up thinking the opposite of the reviews...so I think it's just me and not the recipe.  If I do try this again, I will be thinning out the chicken breasts and perhaps that will help more.

Made this for dinner tonight and it was Yummy! I did make a 2nd batch of seasoning, and sprinkled more on the chicken.  Went easy on the additional garlic powder and reduced to approx 1 tsp,  and took the suggestion from another reviewer and added 1/3 cup chicken broth at the end.  This one is a keeper, thank you Mr/Ms  Perez.

This dish was great!! I mixed all the seasonings together and diced up three small cloves of garlic. I sprinkled some of the seasoning on the cutting board and half of the garlic. I put the chicken on top and sprinkled the remaining seasoning on the chicken, covered it with saran wrap and pounded it out thin. This was really gets the seasoning and the garlic into the chicken. I also doubled the cayenne as someone else had suggested and served with a fresh salad. The man absolutely loved it, will make again!!!

This was fantastic! It was quick and easy. The only reason for the 4 stars was there wasn't enough sauce for afterwards.  I would reccomend adding a bit more oil and butter at the begining or adding chicken broth to add more liquid at the end before the garlic and lime juice are added.

My husband said this had to be some of the best chicken I've ever made in 20 years of cooking!  He doesn't usually like chicken breasts because they are dry, but this chicken had such a great flavor!  It was the perfect blend of spices and the lime really added a lot.  Easy, quick, and not bad for you - perfect!  I didn't change a thing except for using light butter and an extra Tblsp of lime juice.

I love this recipe! It is even better (and healthier) when you bbq it. I combined all the spices then added the lime juice, mixed it all together, then smothered the chicken in it. I let it sit for just a while then put it on the grill. It was delicious! And saved us from all the butter and olive oil. A keeper either way for sure!

Tasty, but not amazing. Definitely add the 1/3 cup chicken broth...and make more of the spice mixture.. the chicken needs it. Eliminate the butter and cook in olive oil only (doesn't need the butter).

Simple, yet fantastic recipe!  I like seasoning so I did 1/4 tsp of everything and used it on just two chicken breasts and that amount was perfect for us.  I also used the full amount of the lime juice.  It wasn't very spicy, but it was extremely flavorful and juicy.  No dry chicken with this recipe!  And the best part?  It's seriously low calorie for those (like me) who are watching their weight.

Wish I could give 4.5 stars but not quite a 5 to me. We really liked this but I did tweak it a little..double cayenne..double "sauce"..added about a 1/4 cup chicken stock to make this more Sauce like. Very tasty!

Excellent!!! but I would increase the spices. I also added honey because it was a little too tart without the honey. I would increase the cyanne too. and the garlic. I would also reduce the juice and I added chichen broth and cilantro. I would increase the cilantro.

I've made this dish twice now and love it!  It's so easy and delicious, the perfect amount of spice. I took the advice of many and didn't use as much garlic powder in the last step.  I also doubled the amount of spice that the recipe calls for, as others suggested as well.  Perfect instructions - chicken comes out super moist and tasty!

Excellent! I served it with Pineapple-Lime Rice which complemented the chicken perfectly.

This wasn't bad.  My boyfriend really liked the spice.  I also enjoyed the spice, but I was hoping for a little more flavor with the juice.  Next time, I'll probably add some chicken broth and tequila and maybe soak it overnight.  Other than that, I think this is a keeper, but needs tweaked.  Oh, and we both agreed it was salty, so I would take probably cut the salt in half.

This was a great recipe.  I only used two chicken breasts and still didn't have an excess of sauce, but it was very tasty.  It didn't knock my socks off, but I will be making it again.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe if you cut out the garlic powder at the end. It's not needed and 2 teaspoons is too much anyway and it's already in the rub. I took the advice of another reviewer doubled both the rub ingredients and the sauce. I added 2/3 cup of really good quality chicken broth to the pan drippings along with the lime juice. I thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch mixed with water. I might cut back on the amount of lime juice a tad next time because it was really "citrusy" a little more than I would like but it was still so very good. The thickened sauce goes really well over rice.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Really great. This mix of seasoning is really tasty. I added more paprika and cayenne pepper, and a little more garlic and found just the right amount of spice. In order to make more of a sauce than what was prescribed, after the chicken was cooked, I used the left over juices/oil and added a bit of cream, flour, chicken broth, and a little of the same spice mixture to make a gravy. Perfect.

This is a great recipe that is easy and taste, with just the right amount of kick! I also had to double up on the seasonings to adequately cover four chicken breasts. Very tasty and quick!

LOVED IT! Followed the recipe almost exactly! Something I usually don't do! The only thing I didn't add was onion powder..but that's because I didn't have any. It had a perfect amount of spice with a slight tingy tangy (from the lime)..I also put a lid on the pan while cooking to keep the chicken extra moist :). I served white rice w/lime and cilantro as the starch (one of my favorite ways to add more life to rice) . After 6 hours at school this was quick and easy to make! LOVE IT!

Delicious, easy, and able to make with things I have on-hand. It's the great recipe trifecta! The only change I made was to use a little less cayenne pepper to suit the kids' tastes.

had all but the thyme on hand, so I did without and it's still just DEEELISH. My husband wasn't even hungry, but when I had him try a bite (so I would know if he liked it straight off the heat), he said, "oh wow. I'm having a piece.) GOOOOAAAAAAL!!

has a really nice flavor but i would have to say if you were going to make this for 4 chicken breasts i would recommend you double the spices because it wont be enough since i only used 2 breasts and it was just enough

I would love to give this 4.5 stars.  The seasoning was very tasty, maybe a bit less zesty than I was expecting, but not overwhelming at all which I was worried about with all the garlic.  The best part of this recipe is the method of cooking, meaning coating with an herb mixture and cooking in the right amount of garlic and butter. The recommendation of 6 minutes a side turned out to be perfect and I will take to other recipes with me because cook time for chicken has always been a mystery to me.  Also, on a positive note, I was surprised by how much "juice" this recipe generated. Reading the recipe, I was expecting a more dry finish. I was pleased by the wetness and I would have made a side of rice had I realized.

Fantastic tasting, easily prepared, healthy dinner, which quite honestly couldn't get much better.  The recipe indicated there would be more of a sauce, but I wasn't so lucky so to achieve moist results, improvised with a shot of Tequila to give it a south-of-the-border flare.  Otherwise, made no modifications to the recipe, I did subsequently read the reviews, which contain some other good ideas, and look forward to making it a regular dish with a side of margarita.  Served with steamed broccoli and Parmesan brown rice.

Just made it.  Very simple, very tasty!  You could bath the chicken in a little oil and add the spices and put on the grill for a great marinade.....squeeze the lime on the chicken while cooking!   yum!

Delicious! I used fresh chopped parsley, garlic & onion instead of the dried. I served it over quinoa with asparagus on the side. Next time I may marinate it & try it on the grill, as recommended by another member.

I really ejoyed this recipe.  Made a few minor adjustments, omited the paprika because I didn't have any and omitted the garlic powder at the end.  Added 1/2 cup chicken broth with the lime juice.  It was very good, served over pasta with the extra sauce.

I used bone in chicken breasts, cut out the salt and used 3 tbsp of olive oil instead of the butter/oil combo and. I marinated them over night and cooked them on the grill.

Good stuff, easy to make gave a nice flavor.  I would say you need to pound the breasts.  I tossed in a little tequilla w/ the finishing sauce, not necessary but a fun twist.

This was a very simple and yummy recipe!  The only change i made was that i added about 2 tablespoons of water to the pan after adding the lemon juice.  I also made roasted broccoli with lemon, garlic and olive oil.  Dinner was great tonight!!!!
**UPDATE**
I just used the dry rub on flounder to make fish tacos.  AMAZING!!!!! And instead of salsa for the tacos i used Mexican sour cream, added some dry rub mix...EXCEPTIONAL!!!

Instead of the dry rub, I made a marinade with some oil and the lime juice in a 3:1 ratio and the herbs added to that.  I did not use garlic powder, but added minced garlic to the marinade.  I let it marinade about 4 hours.  For the sauce, I once again skipped the garlic powder, and instead I added some some chicken broth and about a tablespoon of honey to the lime juice.  It was delicious.

Loved this after making a major change.  I pounded the chicken breast to 1/2" thick, then sprinkle with seasonings and wrapped in plastic and set in frig for 6 hours...then proceeded with recipe. Very tender and  good. would make a great sandwich I think or try cutting into strips and make chicken strips (add some panko bread crumbs etc. in the oven).

We loved this,  Even my kids loved it,  my 6 year old ate a whole breast and wanted more.  I served it with cilantro, lime bismati rice and baked broccoli tossed with olive oil and salt and pepper.   This is going into regular rotation.

This was really good, and I'll make it again, but I have to admit I completely changed it by turning it into a crock pot recipe  Here's how I changed it:   Decreased butter to 1 T Omited Olive Oil Added 1 tsp chopped garlic Added 1 Cup water Added 1 tsp Chicken bouillon Added a splash of Tequila Added 1/2 block of cream cheese (at the END of cooking)  I added all ingredients except the cream cheese and cooked on low 6-8 hours.  The last 15 minutes I stirred in 1/2 block of cream cheese.  Stir the mixture and serve over rice or noodles!

Excellent dish, quick and easy. Has become a favorite. Not at all greasy. I use flavored bread crumbs and cut down just slightly on the oil and butter.

I have to review this recipe because it was so good!  My meat was so tender and spicy.  My husband loved it which is very unusual since he is so picky. Like every recipe and every other cook, I did make changes.  Instead of chicken I used thin boneless pork chops.  We like spicy so I used Tony Cacheres instead of regular salt. If you like lime and spicy--try this recipe!

This is one of the few times I actually measured spices; usually I just ballpark it.  VERY good recipe and one I will make again.  I did add a bit of chicken broth to the lime and garlic, maybe 1/4 cup and let it simmer an additional 10 minutes or so.  I also sliced the breasts into medallions, placed them on a platter and poured the sauce on top.  It really permeated the meat that way.  Excellent, super easy recipe.

Awesome! The whole family loved this recipe. I threw some noodles in the pan after I cooked the chicken and stirred them around in the sauce. I served the chicken over the noodles. It all tasted great!!! Thank you!

Very good. I cut the chicken into pieces to make it easier to sautee all the way through. I also added some minced garlic instead of the extra 2 tbsps of the garlic powder while the chcken was sauteing, and the lime juice was added to the melted butter so the chicken would soak up the flavor more. Iadded some chili flakes to the seasoning too. It was so yummy!

Really tasty but the recipe does not make enough seasoning for large pieces, only enough for 2 medium breasts coated both sides.  I had to make a second batch for the rest.  I also didn't have onion powder so subbed with poultry seasoning.  Turned out great and added more flavor I think.  Plus, I will use less butter and olive oil than recipe calls for.  There was a lot left afterward which got wasted.  Both overall, very tasty.  My daughter loved it and she's a picky eater.

A great dish!  I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp and probably will reduce to 1/4 next time.  I used about 3/4 c chicken stock as I wanted to have something to pour over the rice.  Quick, easy and a keeper for sure!

This was really tasty!  I only used half the amount of chicken and kept the amount of seasoning and sauce the same.  I'm glad I did that, I don't think it would have been enough for 4 chicken breasts.  I added a little chicken broth to make a little more sauce.  I used bottled lime juice and I'm sure it would be better with fresh, but it was still good.

Just made this for dinner tonight and really enjoyed the flavors!  I cooked a large amount of chicken tenders, so adjusted upward the amount of the spice mixture, but was able to cook it without adding more oil/butter.  Cooked the tenders in batches, and then when they were all cooked, I put them back in the pan, added some chopped fresh garlic, instead of the garlic powder, and some chicken broth, and the lime juice.  I also sprinkled in lime zest.  Very tasty!  Definitely recommend this recipe!

I used the spice blend including the EVOO & butter and threw it all in a crock pot on low with a little water & chicken broth until the chicken shredded for my oldest's birthday party (He turned 8.).  Easy.  Great flavor without being overwhelming...

Loved it!! Great combination of spice. Im a saucey kinda gal and added a little chicken broth at the end, simmered a few minutes, Excellent! Next time Im going to use fresh garlic in place of the 2 tsp. garlic powder. I almost don't want to change it since was so delicious but I try to use fresh where I can.

Not sure about the "sauce" that's supposed to magically appear with this dish, but the combined spices on the chicken were wonderful. I doubled the recipe for 4 chicken cutlets and got quite a bit of kick!

This is a great chicken recipe.  I served it with “Spiced Quinoa” from this site that paired up really well!  Easy to prepare ahead of time and just pan fry when all your company has arrived.  Enjoyed by all!

This was delicious.  Loved the flavour of all the spices.  I was concerned as when I was rubbing the spices on 3 boneless chicken breasts it didn't seem like enough, but I'm glad I didn't add more as it was spicy enough.  I had to cook it longer than suggested but that's because the breasts I had were rather thick.  My husband who is not a big chicken fan thought it was quite good as well.  Will def. make this again!

easy, quick but WAY TOO SALTY for our taste.  Perhaps less lime juice or salt would be more to our liking.

I just made this and it was fantastic!  My husband loved it too.  I served it with coconut rice for a balance of spicy/sweet. I WILL make this again!

I thought this recipe was terrific! I love anything spicy, I stuck to the recipes measurements & thought is was just enough kick, I applied the rub & then threw the chicken on the grill w/some asparagus. I used organic chicken so I basically had 4 thin cutlets, didn't need to pound out. the sauce was great & so flavorful using the lime, I will cut back on the butter next time b/c I think 2 tbsp was a bit much, my BF claimed the sauce was too strong, but yet he ate the entire plate??? I thought this was a restaurant quality meal & will be making again. This was perfect for a summer night!!

This Chicken was excellent!  The garlic powder and lime juice kick was amazing!!!  I wasn't fond of the thyme though, so I probably won't add it next time.  And I didn't have parsley or onion powder.  I used some basil and oregano instead.

I think this has become my favorite chicken recipe. We've also used it on shrimp and it was delicious. Once, I doubled the cayenne and it was too hot for my husband, so for us it's perfect as is. Lately I've been making it using cooking spray instead of butter and oil. It doesn't make any sauce, but the chicken is still soooo delicious and very low calorie. Just perfect.

This came out AMAZING!  While I was making the chicken in the skillet I got nervous because the 'sauce' was blackened so I tried not to spread it on the chicken.  But after sampling it I found that the sauce is great and somehow didn't taste burnt at all.  The chicken came out perfectly tender and was gobbled up!  One comment though is that it took me about 15 minutes of cooking the chicken (after adding the lime juice) with a lid to cook it through.  I don't know what this 5 minute business is about.  Delicious!

I followed the reviewer's suggestion for pounding and cutting into smaller pieces as well as a little less garlic powder at the end.  It was fabulous!  Full of flavor!

Great entree!  I didn't have any thyme (or time). This was a quick, easy & tasty recipe.  I didn't add any butter, but instead used only olive oil.  I also added poultry seasoning.  It was delicious....even my 10 month old ate it.  Served it with the Lime Cilantro rice.  Will definetly make again - YUM.

This very easy recipe was incredibly good.  The spices and the lime juice are a great combination!  My only variation was to add additional lime juice.

Sometimes I'm reluctant to try recipes that have such a high rating (result not equaling hype), but I have to agree with the 5 star ratings! This chicken is awesome, I had to soak the pan I cooked the chicken in to stop myself from sopping up all the juice with my fingers!

Health, really easy and really tasty!  The only thing I recommend is pounding the chicken out thin and doubling the spices and lime juice to cover it all.  It was wonderful!

Thanks to this recipe, I now keep a small jar of these combined spices in my cabinet so that I can simply sprinkle some chicken, toss it on the pan, and enjoy.   Phenomenal recipe! I used just a tad less lime and garlic powder, and I was pretty heavy-handed with the sprinkling of the spices, but no real fundamental changes. This was quick and easy to serve at a small dinner gathering, and it went over very well!

Ahhhh! This was FANTASTIC!!!!! I didn't change a thing, just brined the chicken breasts before cooking to make them extra tender- something I do with any chicken breast recipe. My husband said it best- "This tastes like something you'd get at a restaurant and then make the person sitting next to you try a bite." I actually called my mom just to tell her about my new favorite recipe! I'm making it again tonight, using pork chops instead of chicken. Thinking about using it with salmon, too. Maybe chicken kebabs on the grill? I am so in love wih this flavor, I want to use it every way I can! Tonight I'm going to use some of the leftover sauce to flavor my plain old white rice while it's cooking and see how that turns out. I can hardly wait until dinner!!!! Thank you SOOOO much for sharing this recipe!

It had a surprising bite without being too spicy. I would use less salt next time. Served it with some sauteed vegetables (zucchini, red pepper and corn)

We really enjoyed this recipe, although I changed it a bit. I tripled the given spice mixture for 4 quite large breast halves and used fresh thyme and parsley (substituting tablespoons for teaspoons for all fresh herbs), along with jarred garlic instead of garlic powder. I made the spice mixture into a paste with about 2 T of lime juice.  Instead of cooking it on the stovetop, I baked the chicken into a 9"x13" pan. I coated the pan with a tablespoon of olive oil, put in the spice-coated chicken, put about a T of butter in small chunks around the chicken, and put a center-slice of lime on each chicken breast. I covered it with foil and baked it at 350F for 10 minutes; then poured a mixture of a half a cup of chicken broth, 1 T lime juice, some paprika, garlic, crushed red pepper, black pepper, and onion powder mixed together over top of it. I baked the chicken for another 30 minutes and it came out wonderfully moist and delicious, with a lovely spicy but not hyper-hot taste. I do think I may add a bit more lime juice next time, but my husband and I both really enjoyed this. There was plenty of sauce left to dress our rice and veggies!

Giving 4 stars only because the spices definitely needed to be doubled (except for the salt). I actually used 5 chicken breasts instead of the called for of 4. And I was scrambling to put together the spice mixture to go on the other side of the breasts while the butter and olive oil were almost burning. Also I probably used more butter and olive oil. Otherwise, the flavor was perfect! It all compliments each other well. I dont think it was spice though but I like it HOT! And I love anything with lime. I made Cilantro Lime Rice to go with.

Delicious! It's not too spicy, but has delicious flavor. Instead of cooking it in all that butter and oil, I put it on a sheet of foil that I sprayed with cooking spray on my indoor grill. I sprayed both sides of the chicken and then sprinkled the spices on top. After cooking on both sides I drizzled the lime juice over it and then added a few shakes of the garlic powder. Yum!!

I was using this to teach my 12 year old son an easy recipe.  We put the spices on the chicken and were getting ready to put it in the pan when Dad changed our plans.  So we threw the chicken into a ziplock bag for a few hours and when we got home, Dad decided to teach the 12 year old how to grill it instead.  It turned out AMAZING.  My 10 year old who avoids all meat as though it is evil, said it was good and he would eat it again.  WOW.  We did pour a little bit of lemon juice into the ziplock bag with the chicken and they put a small pat of butter on the chicken just before they took it off the grill.  Easy and tasty recipe.  Thanks!

I am obviously in the minority, but I wasn't crazy about this dish at all!  The chicken pan started to dry out and at first I added more olive oil ... that too ran out and since I didn't want to keep adding oil, I added chicken  broth which definitely helped.  I just didn't like the blend of flavors. Strangely, my 9 year old daughter said she "loved it!"  Sorry.

This chicken came out great!  The flavor was amazing without being too much.  I didn't end up with much "sauce" but ended up adding a little chicken stock, reducing it and serving over steamed carrots.  I think it worked out for the better because the chicken didn't need any sauce.

Wow, this spicy, delicious meal really hit the spot. I didn't have onion powder, so I used some dried onion flakes & used a bit of cilantro to add a kick. Served over a bed of pasta, this dish is filling & satisfying.

This was very tasty. I used all the dry ingredients as stated, except I increased the garlic to 1 teaspoon (total), and squeezed in the juice of two limes. Then I marinated the chicken breasts in the lime and spice mixture for the day and threw it on the grill. It was delicious! Thanks for the submission.

It was delicious. I doubled the amount of pepper and cayenne pepper and it was great. Also when I was finished browning the chicken, I removed it and added a tbs. or so of flour and 3 tbs chicken broth. I blended it and then added the chicken, poured half the lime juice on it, added the garlic, and then when i turned the chicken added more lime juice. I also added Tequila toward the end of the cooking time. All that produced a delicious chicken with its own gravy. mmm!

My husband loves garlic and I love lime so this was perfect.  I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce.  If I hadn't there definitely wouldn't have been enough.

Nice sour flavour!  I used fresh garlic and added chicken broth with the lime juice, as suggested, to try to get more sauce out of it.  However, even though I made twice the amount of sauce, it still had mostly evaporated by the time the chicken was done.

For a healthier but still flavor-packed option, use 1/2 Tbsp instead of 2 Tbsp of butter. Tasty and easy chicken recipe!

The only thing I changed was to cut the cayenne pepper in half as I have kids and didn't want it to be spicy for them. This was so good and so easy a 3 year old could do it, no really my daughter (almost 3) made this I measured the spices she pounded the chicken and rubbed in the spices and poured the lime juice in and sprinkled the garlic. It was delish. My husband dint care for it as much, said it had to much lime and while I think he's crazy next time I'll do his in a separate pan with just a couple shakes of lime juice.

absolutely delicious! I think I would use half the cayenne next time- I only made 2 chicken breasts and pounded them about 3/4 in. thin, but I kept the same measurements for the rest of the ingredients for added flavor. For the lime juice, one small lime covered the marinade mixture for me. I squeezed a little before grilling it on the Foreman and then right before serving it. So tasty!

My family of 4 men. 3 teenagers and one some what grown men like the sauce a lot. I added a tbsp. more of butter. Instead of a 1/2 cup of lime 3/4 of cup. I add 1/4 cup chicken broth. It made the sauce perfect. Try to make this with rice. It's just a good side dish for the chicken. I have been order to make this again.

Lime really makes this recipe. Minced fresh garlic and onion should be used instead of powder, it tastes much better.

Great recipe as-written! Followed everything exactly and the flavors of the spices were wonderful together. Definitely don't skip the step with butter/olive oil: I've found this step to be critical for the flavors to really come through...let it foam up a little, then add chicken. Yum! Served with couscous and avocado--which was awesome! Oh, and a side of green beans. :)

The chicken was so tasty.  Wonderful mix of seasoning although I would make a little more mix to adequately coat both sides of the chicken.  I cut it up and put it on mixed greens, a little light ranch and it was WAY better than any restaurant salad!  Thank you for the recipe!

I loved this recipe, I only added a little more lime juice than it calls for and used fresh garlic in the skillet instead of garlic powder.  It was fantastic!  I made it for 3 friends and they all loved it.  It was so easy, and time effective yet still a unique, amazingly flavored dish! I highly recommend it (but strongly suggest real garlic)

Pretty flavorful, but not enough spice to coat one breast.  I'd quadruple the spices for 4 breasts.

Excellent recipe :) I work 12 hour days and have a 30 min commute.  When I get home to cook for my boyfriend and I it has to be a quick fix. Loved this!  So much flavor in the chicken--it's perfect! Not as spicy as the name makes it out to be but that's okay with me.. I was only doing the spicy part for my guy. Worked out in my favor ha :) Recipe is in my box & written down in my cookbook. Def a keeper! Plan on making this again soon!

This is a good recipe!  I did double the juice and also used Chili Powder instead of Cayenne Pepper.  It was subtle smoky heat but good.  The broth really helped to have more sauce. I served with brown rice and veggies. Thanks!!

This was delicious!  I used chicken tenders, instead of whole breasts.  They were tender and flavorful.  I added about a 1/3 cup of chicken broth at the end and slightly less garlic powder than was called for.  I will definately make it again!  I think I will double the lime juice and broth next time to have some sauce for the white rice I served with it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent recipe! This is something I will come back to, and can be fairly healthy. Prep time minimal.   We took out the butter and used 2 1/2 tsp of olive oil. It was more than enough, 2 should be fine, ill try less later.   Not very spicy at all. Added little more lime juice than called for, it was a good idea. Wow, that was good.

It was good.  I added a TB of corn meal to the spice mixture and it crisped up nicely.
Perhaps my chicken breasts were thicker than what the recipe expects as they were not done in 20 minutes.
Good quick recipe.

My husband made this tonight for dinner and two of my 3 boys really liked it and my eldests' friend asked for 3rds!  The lime juice really has a great tang and creates a glaze over the chicken.  We have one little, measely piece of chicken left that my husband is going to shred for nachos or quesadillas later tonight!

Awesome chicken recipe!  A made a few minor modifactions - I cooked the chicken in 2 tbs of EVOO. I added 1 tbs of butter when I added the lime juice at the end. Chicken had just the right amount of heat from the cayenne pepper - just enough to add a little kick. Loved the tang from the lime juice!  This recipe is a keeper!  I'll be making again soon!

When I added the lime juice and garlic to the pan, it did not smell very good, so I was afraid to try the chicken.  But, it came out very well.  I couldn't really taste the garlic or lime, but the flavor of the chicken was delicious.  And, still good the next day.

I hate chicken, but my husband insists we have it in our diet.  I tried this recipe and it was the best chicken I've had in decades.  It took me back to when all I ate was chicken.  It was easy to make and it cooked up so tender and juicy.  This recipe will be one I use over and over.

WOW! This recipe was delicious!! I doubled the rub and doubled the lime.(We are big fans of lime!) I ran out of onion powder, so I used minced onion. It came out great!! Will make again!

This was awesome!!!  I followed the recipe exactly as stated.. except I added cilantro which made all the difference!  I also marinated it for about 6 hours.  It was awesome!  I made it with a version of Chipotle's cilantro rice... yummy!

This was okay. The spices were a nice blend and the chicken remained fairly juicy. The sauce wasn't appealing to look at and had an uneven consistancy. Dispite the limes being a good flavour, the taste was somewhat bitter. Certainly edible but not my favourite. Thanks anyway.

Very good. I doubled the rub and increased the cayenne pepper a little because we like things spicy.  Also reduced the cooking time to three to four minutes per side depending on the thickness of the breasts.

Wow, all of these great reviews and my husband and I really didn't like this.  I ended up washing the sauce off the chicken and cutting it up for a salad.  We found this way too spicy - not hot spicy but strong spicy.  The flavors didn't seem to go together quite right.  Sorry!

I left out the cayenne (for the kids), and used frozen chicken strips that I defrosted halfway, then threw in the pan. That made for too much liquid, so I had to cook longer and then brown. I doubled the spice mixture and it was just about right. It turned out SO tasty! The lime flavor was just right, and I bet it's great with the cayenne. I will for sure put this into the rotation, and might even make up a shaker of the spices (like other reviewers). Delicious, healthy, and easy!! What more could you want!

I loved all the spices with this recipe.  The amount needed for each spice wasn't enough for me to cover all four chicken breasts so I had to make a little bit more.  I like the kick it had!  I'll be making this again!

This was really good! The only changes that I made were that I omitted the cayenne (dont like spicy), didn't have any parsley, and used lemon juice because thats all I had. Oh, and I pounded the chicken. Very yummy. Served this with the Brazilian White Rice from this site and the rice was so good with the sauce from this. I will definitely make this again!

This is one of my family's favorite recipes - I take it wherever we go, since it comes together very quickly and pleases both family and company. I now keep limes in my produce drawer at all times, just because of this recipe. My picky 9-yr-old son LOVES this dish, and that's the truest test of a recipe I know of.

This was so good!!!  Based on other comments, I doubled the butter, which gave more of a sauce.  I also pounded the chicken down to about a 1/2 inch thick.  This chicken has such great flavor.  It's not exactly spicy like the name says, but it is great.

This recipe was excellent! It turned out a lot better than I thought it would. Here are the few things I tweaked: 1) doubled all the spices (except salt) because I like spice 2) Doubled the butter for extra sauce 3) Added mushrooms & cut asparagus right before adding the lime juice & garlic 4) Added red pepper flakes to the sauce (~1 tbsp) 5) Cooked covered for the last 5 minutes for a really moist chicken dish! Delicious! Will make often.

This is so good and fairly simple.  There are lots of spices to mix up though - so I usually make up a bunch of the spice mixture and keep it on hand for the future.  Then it's a really easy week night dinner!

I agree with the reviewer that pounded out the chicken, the flavour was perfect.  I also doubled the amount of butter and olive oil, but I think I might have been able to get away with it - I'll probably just increase it by a half next time, that should be perfect.

Other than that, top notch dish - a great meal for quick fix nights.

VERY GOOD!  Took to a BBQ and it was the talk of the crowd!  I added cilantro and used 3 cloves minced garlic and sliced green onion rather than the powders.  This is excellent with cilantro-lime rice!

Great, nice, juicy and flavorful. This will be made on a regular basis. Very tasty. Great flavor between the garlic and lime. I added extra fresh garlic outside what was called for in the recipe.

Good recipe with nice flavors. I am generous with the spices, and I especially like to use more cayenne than the recipe calls for to get that extra kick.

I used about 1/2 the garlic powder and it was still too much garlic for me. My husband enjoyed it, though. Maybe it just didn't suit my taste. Easy dinner recipe. I served it with rice and corn.

This was pretty tasty. I was tired of chicken, so I tried it with pork chops- very good. I rubbed the pork with the spices first. Next, mixed the oil, lime juice, melted butter and second amount of garlic powder in a glass 9x9 baking pan, added the pork, coating both sides in the sauce, covered the pan with foil and baked for 30 minutes. The pork was very tender and the flavour had just the right balance between tangy and spicy. This would be excellent on the grill - pork or chicken and vegetable kabobs in this mixture of spices and the lime/garlic/butter basting sauce. Excellent recipe. UPDATE: Couldn't get limes at the store and used lemon juice instead. Still pretty tasty. I've made this many times and it always gets favourable reviews.

Very flavorful. Next time I will pound the chicken a bit thinner and double the spices then I think it will be perfect.

This is my new favorite.  I only had bone in thighs so I used them. I browned 6 minutes each side as directed. Then I turned it down to low and covered the pan. I let it finish cooking through, then I added the garlic powder and lime.  Yummy! Thanks for sharing!

I made the chicken as instructed, then made a sauce with mayo, a little milk, lime juice, garlic salt, and cilantro and put it all in a whole wheat tortilla.  YUM!

This was a GREAT recipe. I rated it 4 stars but my husband 5. He kept calling it awesome, and told me "whatever you did to make the sauce, do it again!". He then cleaned his plate of the sauce and was devastated there was none left. Afterwards, he found the empty baking pan (I baked it for maybe 40 mins) and was disappointed I didn't tell him there was more sauce in the leftover baking pan. Anyways, great chicken - next time I'll add more black pepper.  Thanks!

The recipe was very good! I only made a few changes but I thought they only enhanced the already wonderful experience. First off, I doubled the spices so it would be more generously flavored. Then I added chopped green, orange, and red peppers; half of each. Served it over rice. It was excellent! i'll make it again! Fo Sho.

Loved it! Followed suggestions to double spices and to add tequila at the end (when you add the lime juice) and it was fantastic. I'm going to try the seasoning with fish next time.

Absolutely awesome. Really easy to make and very yummy. My bf begs me to make it all the time. I do however usually add slightly more oil and butter for the sauce and double the lime juice. I also usually add more of the the spices since we like it with a bit more kick

Yummy and pretty easy to get right. I overdid the lime once but usually I measure it and it comes out nicely. My chicken was pretty thick so I cut it up and cooked it a little longer than the recipe says.  This is our new favorite dish

Dried out a bit, won't cook quite as long next time or add some chicken stock as it simmers to retain moisture. Other than that, the flavor was very good! Will make again!

This recipe sounded good so i made it, but when I tasted the lime/garlic mixture by itself, it was a bit too sour. So I sprinkled chicken with the mixture instead of coating it, then I added shredded colby cheese on the chicken to melt. Tasted great!!

Wow, the spice rub is awesome!!!! Like other reviewers, I used olive oil instead of butter. Definitely double the spice mixture - you'll need it. I also used chicken tenders so there would be more surface area to coat w/ the spices. Yum, I will definitely make this again.

Amazing!!!  This recipe is awesome.  The chicken always turns out moist (if cooked according to directions in recipe, and not on too high a heat) and I have found that chili powder can be substituted for the spicy spices, which I don't seem to ever have on hand, and lemon juice can be substituted for the the lime with similar results. Another thing that tastes great is substituting 1 fresh, minced garlic clove for the garlic powder in the sauce poured over at the end, but not mixed with the other powdered spices. It gives a nice kick.

Fabulous! Great flavor, not too much lime, not too much spice- just right! I did have to use chicken thighs (that's all I had) and we loved it. Will make again and again.

This was really good!  I used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder (about 4 cloves) and I added more of all the spices, and also a splash of tequila with the lime juice. I'll definitely make it again!

This was really good! I was pleasantly surprised at how spicy it was... will definitely make again! As others mentioned, I doubled the spices to fully coat the chicken breasts - and used thin sliced chicken breasts.

I followed the recipe for the chicken rub, which was very good. My DH and the kids loved it (I left out the cayenne on the kids' pieces as they are both under 5yrs). I made a sauce out of the pan drippings (flour + milk, poured into the hot drippings and cooked to a low boil).  The sauce really added to the dish.

I rubbed the spices into the chicken and then let it marinate over night. It needed more flavor so next time, I'll use more spices I think. The flavor that it did have was good. Just not strong enough for me.

I'm updating my review and giving this recipe 5* instead of the original 4*. Here's the secret... For more sauce I just added more of the butter, oil, and lime juice. Add an extra half of whatever it calls for (ex. 2tbs butter becomes 3tbs). I also DOUBLED ALL OF THE SPICES cause I like loads of flavor in every bite. Also, use smaller chicken breasts. ONLY FOLLOW THESE ADDITIONS IF YOU WANT A FLAVOR EXPLOSION!!! OLD REVIEW!I thought it was great, and so did my family. I don't normally make chicken because it doesn't seem to hold flavor well, but this was very tasty. I added more lime juice than recommended because I always like more sauce than normal. I wouldn't really call what's left in the pan sauce though. It's more like drippings. So, for those of you sauce fans like myself, don't be fooled. I used maybe 1/2 TBS more lime juice and it just made it more citrus-y. It was good none the less. I'd also recommend using smaller/thinner chicken breasts for more surface area for the spices. If you do go smaller remember to COOK IT LESS. Matter of fact, I'd cook the larger peices a couple minutes less than in the recipe also. Happy cooking!

Very tasty and easy!  I prepared the chicken and my boyfriend cooked it in an iron skillet on the grill.  The ckicken was very juicy and had wonderful flavor.  I think next time I will slice the chicken and serve it fajita style with warm flour tortillas, beans and rice, and homemade salsa and guacamole.

Because I was short on time and had semi-frozen chicken breasts, I opted to slice the chicken in thin strips so it would thaw quicker.  Per the suggestion of other reviewers I doubled the spice mixture (with a little extra cayenne pepper because I like things spicy!) and rubbed the spice mixture into the raw chicken strips.  I followed the rest of the recipe pretty much as directed except with a little less butter and less garlic at the end.  I served the chicken in soft tortillas with taco fixings (cheese, sour cream, lettuce, etc.)  These were very good!  Personally, I just ate the meat by itself with a salad.  Yummmm!  This was a very quick, easy supper that was enjoyed by all.  I'll definitely make this again.  I also like the fact that I always have these ingredients on hand.  If you like a tangier lime (less spicy) flavor, try the Lime Chicken Tacos also on this site.  They are similar and also very good.  Thanks C. Perez for a quick, easy, great-tasting recipe!

The seasoning was a little to spicy for me.  Next time, I'll try less red & black pepper.  Certainly worth trying and adjusting to your own taste.

This was so delicious! It was nice and zesty. It was different from other ordinary chicken recipe; I will definitely make it again.

I followed the recipe except for adding only 1/8th of a tsp. of cayenne (I didn't want it to be so spicy that my kids wouldn't eat it).  I also used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, which I would not recommend.  I think the recipe would definately be better with chicken breast strips.  I also used the remaining "sauce" (more like seasoned oil) over rice and asparagus which I also wouldn't recommend.  It made everything taste too limey.  But, overall I think this is a good recipe.  I might make this again in the summer with a green salad.

Yikes! A lot spicier than I expected. Going by the directions exactly as posted, there was no "sauce" to speak of.  I like spicy, but this seemed to need something to tame it a bit.
The chicken was moist, but for me this was not a keeper.

Yum!! make some extra sauce to put over rice or veggies.  Careful with the garlic.  The lime is not very strong, might have to go a little heavier on it.  
I did make this into a pot luck dish- cook as suggested, but more (as appropriate), cut chicken into pieces, add angel hair pasta (with lots of sauce), and shoe-string cut carrots and zuchini, possibly red pepper or broccoli.  toss into crockpot and mix, leave on warm. i got lots of compiments on it.

I'm only knocking off a star because I think you need to double the spices to really coat the chicken. Otherwise, this was great. Everyone around here thought it was one of the best chicken recipes we've had.

This recipe is awesome! If I could give this ten stars I would. My hubby requests it at least once a week.  After making it a few times I have added 3 more tablespoons of lime juice to make more sauce. It goes great with rice and green beans. So yummy!

I've made this twice now, and both times it was wonderful!  This time I made it without the cayenne becuase I was cooking at someone else's house.  I also added about a 1/2 cup white wine and 1/2 cup chicken stock to the drippings and made a sauce.  I serve the chicken and sauce over pasta.  Very yummie!  My boyfriend, who hates thyme, loved this dish.

Awsome.  Poured off most of the oil, caramalized some white onion in the saute pan.  Deglazed the saute pan with chianti and reduced.  Spooned sauce over the chicken.  Like I said, AWSOME!  Try Key Limes.

Very simple and very flavorful!  I am a little paranoid about undercooked chicken, so I followed the recipe's instructions for cooking the chicken stovetop, and then put them in a baking dish (topped off with the pan drippings and covered with tin foil) and baked them at 375 for about 20 minutes.  It was the most tender and moist chicken I've had in a really long time.  I will definitely make this again!!!

Loved it!!  I used 3 chicken breasts instead of 4 (only had 3 on hand, but figured it would just taste even better since I kept the spices measurements the same).  The taste of the seasonings and that tangy bite from the lime is perfect.  Definitely a keeper!  Served with Sesame Green Beans from this site, and white rice.

I love to make this chicken. I mix all the dry ingredients in a little container and keep it in with my spices so it's always on hand.  I love to use it in my white chili for added kick.

Just wanted to add my kudos for this recipe!  It is really excellent; full of flavor!  The only thing I will do different next time is to double the spice mix that gets put on the chicken.  I bet this would be equally fantastic with lemon juice!  Thanks for a great recipe! UPDATE: Yep, it's great with lemon too. I added a mix of lime and lemon juices and doubled the spice mix. A really great, flavorful chicken.

Excellent. Quick and easy, and the combination of tangy and spicy goes very well. I combined it in Peppy's Pita Bread with peppers and onions I briefly sauteed in the drippings, and it was heavenly.

Excellent recipe!  I left out the cayenne and the parsley because I didn't have them, and added lime zest to the spice mixture.  I only used one lime, so I don't think it made 3 T of juice, but the zest made up for it.  I also used 6 chicken tender strips rather than the breasts (I was only cooking for 2 people) - I don't think the spice mixture would have been enough to coat 4 breasts though.  Turned out great and was very easy!  I served with Lemon Tabouli and white wine.

This was a hit at our house.  Even my pickiest child who is seven yrs. old gave this dish five stars (practically unheard of).  I'll definitely be making this again soon.  I was concerned that this might be too spicy for the kids, but they all loved it.

Delicious!  I made a few changes to suit my tastes and what I had in my spice cabinet.  Instead of cayenne, I used chili powder.  I doubled the onion powder to 1/4 tsp, and I omitted the thyme.

I also made this recipe once for my mom's low sodium, high protein diet by just decreasing the salt to 1/8 tsp.  It was just as good!

Edit 10-25-2005: I made this chicken recipe again when I went camping over the weekend.  Made the spice rub, put it on the chicken, and froze chicken ahead of time.  By the time we set up camp, chicken was thawed.  I put each thawed chicken breast into a foil pouch with the juice of 1 lime.  It's definitely better cooked on the stove, but still turned out great over a campfire.

I loved this chicken!  It was very easy to make.  I used bottled key lime juice and pre-minced, bottled garlic.  We had an extra breast and it tasted great sliced up on a salad the next day!

This is an awesome recipe for fajitas or goes PERFECT with the black bean and couscous salad on here. I however spice the meat while its in the pan because I found that if you try to coat it with the amount of spices given, there isn't enough. So I put the chicken in the pan and then double the spice amount.I always get rave reviews and its easy to fall back on when you're in a rush.

Great recipe!  After I cooked the chicken in the skillet, I sauteed onions and cooked rice in the remaining sauce for about 5 minutes.  Could probably also be done with vegetables.

delicious and incredibly easy to make!  i opted for using chicken strips, which cut down the cooking time.  while eating the strips, i realized they would go great on top of a salad.

WOW!  This recipe is wonderful.  Everyone loved it, and wanted seconds.  After I was done cooking the chicken I sauteed some onions, diced carrots, and garlic in the same pan (with all the yummy juices) and added some white rice I had left over from another meal.  What a great combination.  Please do yourself a favor and try it!

This was really good spices for chicken.  The only thing is that I think 6 minutes on each side on medium heat burned the spices... Next time I'm going to try turning the heat down a bit and maybe not as long.  Other than that, it was wonderful!

This was wonderful and so easy.  The chicken had so much flavor without any marinating.  We sliced the chicken into strips before cooking and then served alongside the black bean couscous that others receommended from this site.  Will definitely make again!

This was good, and paired well with the black bean and couscous salad also from this site.  I did make one change though, I grilled it on my Foreman grill instead of in a pan with butter and oil.  I followed the first step exactly and then I put it on a hot grill and squeezed fresh lime juice on the chicken throughout the cooking process.

Delicious.  Used a little less garlic powder in the final stage of cooking and skipped the onion powder alltogether, and it was amazing.  Boyfriend and I both loved it.

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!  I cut my chicken into thin strips and used the recipe as the chicken for fajitas.  No lie--after a few bites, everyone pulled the chicken out of the fajitas and ate it with their forks, then just dove into the big bowl holding all the cooked chicken and ate away.  Forget the fajitas!  Let's concentrate on the chicken!  I added green pepper and onion strips since I was using it as fajitas but did not marinate the vegetables: just added them during cooking.  This is easily the BEST chicken recipe I have gotten from this site.  Everyone I served this to just raved and all went home with recipes.  Needless to say, I will not disguise the chicken with fajita accompaniments next time and we'll just eat it as the recipe states.  I didn't measure my lime juice--just added the juice from one lime.  I wouldn't recommend any changes.  YUM!  I'm serving it again tonight to a different group of friends/family!!

Excellent dish, goes great over buttered rice. Be warned, though, it is spicy! If you don't care for hot food, be sure to reduce the amount of cayenne. I substituted the plain salt for seasoned salt, which added a wonderful flavor. I also omitted the thyme as I don't care for it, and instead of adding extra garlic powder with the lime juice, I threw in some minced fresh garlic. My only complaint was that the spices burned onto the bottom of the skillet before the chicken was done, which gave it a rather unappetizing brown color. With that presentation, I wouldn't serve it to company, but my family loved it. When I make it again, I will experiment with the prep method to see if I can make it a little more appealing to the eye. P.S. It is also good for leftovers the next day! I ate mine thinly sliced over salad greens, and made a chicken quesadilla for my daughter. YUMMY!

This recipe has the perfect amount of spicy and tangy.  It would probably be good on tacos as well.  I recommend to cut the chicken into strips so that the meat doesn't get dried out.

I was amazed that a dry rub would add this much flavor, and that I could sautee chicken so fast and have it be so good.  We loved this..and I use this rub to season all of my chicken now..before I stir fry, or sautee it every time!

Quick, easy and very tasty....my favorite combination.  I used 8 tenderloins and doubled the marinade except for the cayenne.  I put the tenderloins in a ziploc and let them marinate for a few hours.  I browned them in a skillet and cut a lime in half and squeezed it over the chicken.  My husband loved this recipe and asked that I hold on to it.  Thanks for your recipe C. Perez...it's really good.

So easy, yet so good.  You don't even really need the lime, and improvising on the spices is definitely possible as I was missing onion powder and it still came out great with minced onion instead.  Just be careful not to double up on the ingredients or you will end up with very spicy chicken.  I recommend chicken THIGHS instead of breasts for this recipe as they are much more tender.  I'm going to make this over and over as it's one of those very very very easy recipes.  I think I'll just bottle up the spice and keep it on hand.

I cubed the chicken breast to get more spices on each piece. This was really good.  I think this would be good chicken to let cool and add to salads.

This is really good.  My husband and I loved it. However, I doubled the spice mixture (as was recomended by another reviewer)and put it on real thick like blackening seasoning. And it was way too spicy.  However, we still really enjoyed it. This will definately be added to my keepers list.

This was a very good dish, that had a different taste to it than what I am used too, which is really woke up my taste buds.  I wasn't exactly sure how to serve this, it seemed "naked" by itself.  I paired it with spanish rice and refried beans.  I ate it all separate but my husband rolled it all up in a tortilla.  I am sure that I will make this one again.

This dish didn't really wow us. I doubled the sauce as others suggested but it was just extra sauce on chicken that was so-so at best. I guess I just got my hopes up from reading on all the other reviews. Won't be making this one again.

Very Good.  For the lime/garlic powder mixture, I used only about 1.5 T for 3 breasts and used fresh minced garlic.  Easy and something different.  I will make this again.

I absolutely loved this chicken.  It has so much flavor... although I did double the amount of spices to coat the chicken more.  Next time I make it I think I might try browning it on both sides then baking it the rest of the way with the lime-garlic sauce on top.  Marvelous recipe!

This was so easy and so flavourful! (Although it wasn't easy to disperse the spices on the chicken evenly and i didn't have much of a 'sauce') I served it with rice and "Broccoli With Lemon Almond Butter." Simply Delicious.

Don't use bone in chicken breasts with the skin on for this recipe.  All the flavour stays in the skin and not in the chicken.  It tasted alright, but wasn't that flavorful, even with all the spices.

Halving the oil and butter didn't have too negative an impact on flavor. As other reviewers have already noted, adding additional liquid at the end to extract all the yummy flavor residue is good idea.

We loved this recipe..... as others suggested, we cut the chicken into strips... it was more flavroful that way...we were cooking for three people so we doubled the ingrdients and it worked out pefectly...we also used fresh garlic, and fresh chilipeppers.. gave it a nice kick... we ate it with spanish rice (Near East brand).... good combo...

my husband cooks every thursday- he always tries to pick something easy and fast. he loved this recipe. it turned out great- definately a keeper. it had great flavor- not too overpowering. would not change a thing in this recipe except to maybe bake it next time to cut down on some of the fat.

This was one of the best chicken recipes I have tried. It is easy to make and has quite a bite to it! Everyone in my family loved it and it is now a regular dish for my family.

Easy & delicious! Most cooks will have these ingredients already on hand.  You can make several batches of the spice mixture at once, saving on time & labor.  Everyone in my family loved this chicken.  I made it exactly according to the recipe - no changes necessary.  I'd made it exactly the same way again.  Great!  Thanks for sharing it!

I was very surprised that this tasted so different from what I imagined. The ONLY change I made to the recipe was only 1 tsp of garlic powder at the end instead of 2. (seems like a good decision). This was so flavorful! In reading other reviews, I think some people may not be noticing that the recipe calls for four chicken breast halves, not four whole breasts. If sautéing, you definitely want them thinner (sliced in half).

This was fantastic! The only thing I changed was the lime juice...I didn’t have enough so I used lemon and lime juice.  I am making a batch of the spice mix and saving it in a spice jar for next time- which will be very soon!

I followed the recipe exactly until the chicken was almost done, then I added a splash of white wine and cooked  the chicken for a few more minutes.  Then, I removed the chicken and using the still hot pan, sautéed onions and a pepper.  Turned out great!

Delicious, but definitely not enough spice.  I tripled the spices but not the salt.  I used minced garlic and sauteed with the butter / oil instead of garlic powder at the end.  The sauce has intense flavor and is wonderful when drizzled over rice.  Would like more of it.  Might try adding some chicken broth at the end to make a little more sauce.

It's really good. I added broth and baked it after browning the chicken for 6 mins each side. i also doubled the amount of cayenne pepper because Im a little teeny tiny bit immune to spice. I put aluminum foil on the pan when I baked it. results: juicy chicken, right amount of spice for me, good for rice when you put the broth sauce over it. for me, it wasnt garlicky at all. 
only 4 stars because its not like food that id be drooling for. i reserve 5 stars for the best.

This was easy and yummy.  To make more sauce, I added chicken broth and some whipping cream.  My daughter said it reminded her of the chicken piccata I make...and this was MUCH easier.

I doubled the ingredients for the easons that go on the chicken. I then dipped the chicken both sides. This is as much chicken it would cover. Even if I just sprinkled the seasonings on the chicken, wouldn't make lot. Very disappointed.

The family loved this recipe, even the older kiddos.  Incredibly flavorful.  I cooked this in a cast iron skillet and it came out perfect! 
 Just spicy enough to get your attention, but doesn't hurt ya.  A wonderful addition to the dinner lineup!

I made this for 6 servings and it came out good but I had to make another round of spice rub to coat all of my chicken. I would halve the amount of salt as it was a bit salty.

This was as it said, Spicy Garlic Lime 
Chicken, it was excellent.

The only thing I would do is double the spice recipe so you have enough for each side.

The spice rub, while tasty, was quite hot. It's good for those that can handle their heat/spiciness. Personally, I don't like spice rubs because it leaves my mouth feeling raw and dry.

This recipe was alright.  I didn't get much out of the lime juice and garlic powder addition at the end.  It was good, and I will probably make it again, but it wasn't spectacular.

Made it a few times each time with great reviews and no a bit leftover. After making it a couple times I tweaked the spice used and added a bit more garlic and a chile sauce, called mole on it and bake- Juicy and spicy made great dish with spanish rice  with a sprinkle of lime and cilantro.

I made this on a day I had my two toddler grandchildren all day! In addition to them, I was expecting their mom and my husband for dinner. Unexpectedly my mom called snd said my uncle was in town, so of course i invited them as well. All of the sudden I worried my chicken wouldn’t stretch that far. Using the video idea, I quickly decided to make tacos and what a hit! The only recipe change was in reversing the amounts of cayenne snd paprika for my elderly relatives who can’t take as much heat! Thanks for the idea!

I used chicken breast  I had marinated for the grill. So the meat was already flavored with the juice from one lime, two garlic cloves crushed, 2 Tbs of soy sauce and cayenne pepper to suit your taste. I also added about  1/4 tsp more of all the seasonings.  Since I was going for the Mexican flare, I topped the chicken with fresh mango salsa. My husband called it his new favorite dish.

Good recipe.  Quick and tastes.  The only thing I changed was I increased the garlic powder in the original rub and left it out at the end.  Just added the lime juice to make the "sauce".  It is on the yummy quick list with corn on the cob and steamed broccoli for our sides.

Really good and quick with a bite. Made a few adjustments.  Doubled the spice mixture and added about a cup of chicken broth after I let the lime and garlic simmer a bit. Served with pasta.

Delicious and quick. I didn't have lime so I used lemon and it was still delicious. I can't wait to try it with lime. I also followed a review deglazed the pan with a bit of chicken stock, which added a yummy sauce. I will be making this again for sure!

I’ve made it twice. Once with chicken breast following the recipe. The second time ,I used 2 - legs & thighs. I rub the seasonings under the skin and let sit for 2 hours in fridge. I then doubled the lemon, oil and butter, cooked in oven at 350, basting every 15 min or so.  Very delicious, flavorful and moist. The excess liquids, I’ll use later.

After trying this one time I’m now making it regularly. This is so flavorful and easy that I’m sure I’ll keep it around for a long time. The best tip I could add is double the spices that are put on the chicken before it goes into the pan. The amount of spices at the end should stay the same.

I was so torn on this rating. I used 2 different thickness of breasts (doubled the recipe). On the thicker pieces it tasted like it was missing something but on the really thin pieces it was perfect. Next time I think I’ll use the thinner pieces as they were so much juicier and flavorful.

Made this for the second time tonight!!! This recipe is quickly becoming a family favorite! Only issue I had, was that if you follow the amounts specified for the ingredients for 4 servings, you come up WAY short! I had to multiply the spices by like, 10. But, maybe it’s a matter of individual taste?  I also tossed some rice in the juices left over in the pan & OMG, PERFECT & DELICIOUS!!! I highly recommend this recipe!!!

Delicious!  I also used the same recipe for tilapia.  This is going to be a regular  in my household.  I did triple the spices because the first time I made it, I ran out.  It could be that my breasts were larger  (chicken breasts - haha) or I coated each piece more heavily, but I absolutely love it.  I think I'll try it on some little round steaks I have.  I served the leftover, cold chicken on top of a salad.  It was so good and spicy.  Maybe I'll make a bit batch of it and just put it on everything.  It's really good.

This recipe is a staple in our household - with some changes:
First, we LOVE spicy - so to "knock it up a notch" do the following:
•	Keep the amount of salt the same as in the original, but x4 (minimally) the amount of each of the other spices. (Note: we use thyme powder, not dried thyme)
•	Don’t “sprinkle” the spice mixture… essentially bread the chicken with the spices.
•	Add ¾ cup of chicken broth when adding in the lime juice.
Enjoy!

This recipe is a family favorite! I've been making this for 2-3 years. I use thighs instead of breasts. It works equally well whether the thighs are bone-in or boneless - just change the timing accordingly. It's easy, quick, and delicious! What more can you ask for? ;-) And in the unlikely case there are leftovers, they're wonderful cut up and tossed into a spring salad - it just adds that extra bit of zing to the salad.

This recipe was fantastic! The seasoning added a ton of flavor and made for perfect tacos. I will most definitely be making this again in the near future. Just remember that 6 minutes may not be long enough to cook the chicken through, and to check it by taking a piece off and cutting into the thickest point. I couldn’t recommend it enough, otherwise!

This was very good!  I followed others suggestions and doubled the spice rub, used fresh garlic (3 cloves) and added about 1/3 cup chicken broth.  I mixed the minced garlic and chicken broth with the lime juice and then spooned it over top the browned breasts.  Very easy, everyone enjoyed.

This was the best dish I ever made. I cooked it as instructed, but doubled the cayenne pepper & instead of garlic powder I threw 3 cloves of minced garlic in the pan. I cut the chicken up and served it in tortillas with a spicy garlic aioli & corn one the cob. DANGEROUSLY YUMMMMY!!

very good...and an easy fix when pressed for time.  I added chopped onion and minced garlic to the pan when sautéing two chicken breasts and also added 1/2 cup chicken broth with the lime juice

Delish! I don't think I need to say more. 

Oh no, wait I do. I'm very selective in what I make. I use this site for recipes when I've run out of ideas myself...I do have a Culinary Degree, however, I also have MS. There are times I walk into the kitchen to cook and can't remember how to do something as simple as a pot roast.

This site is a Godsend for me. I'm always careful to follow every recipe EXACTLY as it's written the first time I make something. I then will make notes on different things that I maybe didn't like and try it a tad different the next time around. 

I've read many reviews on here. And I've got to say that I'm somewhat disappointed when people change it and then don't give the rating it really deserves. You can't give an honest rating when you change it the first time you've cooked it. Just keep that in mind when reviewing. 

Okay, I'm done.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe and it was incredible.  This will become a regular for us.  I am going to try to grill next time.  The only thing that will be challenging is the sauce.

DELICIOUS and easy to make. Used avocado oil instead of olive oil. Used Kerry Gold butter . Used fresh minced garlic for more intense garlic flavor and aroma.

This is ssoooo delicious! I added additional garlic, as my family love garlic. I also added a splash of lemon juice, sliced onion, crushed chili pepper flakes, about 1/3 of a small jalapeño and about a quarter can of chicken broth (broth added at the very end). I served on tortillas with lettuce and a side of black beans. This recipe is so yummy and easy! Thank you for sharing!

I used this as a marinate for a purchased rotisserie chicken.  De-boned chicken, put chicken and marinate in gallon plastic bag, refrigerated until ready to heat up. Put them in wrap. Good quick meal.

This was fantastic!  I usually don't review because my style of cooking means I change so much of a recipe, and this one was no exception, but I want to give props to recipes that are so adaptable and still come out amazing.  I had some boneless/skinless thighs that I needed a marinade for and this recipe turned out to be perfect.  I omitted the butter, used fresh garlic, added a few squirts of Sriracha and a couple tablespoons of tequila to bring up the liquid content. Marinaded for about an hour before grilling.  Wonderful flavor and so moist and tender.

Flavor was really good. I used less cayenne since my partner doesn't like things too spicy. Could also cut the butter in the pan and the amount of lime juice - lime flavor is great but I wish I had used a spritzer to coat the chicken with just a hint of lime. We both ate every bite though! I served it with a quinoa/brown rice blend, broccoli, and creamed corn. It all mixed well together.

Used chicken thighs, I think I would prefer broiling this dish if I were to make again. Wasn't as garlicky and spicy like tasting as I anticipated but good.

Followed exactly except I only used two chicken breasts  sliced  horizontally  for quicker cooking.  At end added a half can of coconut milk...made a very tasty sauce...served over brown and wild rice also cooked in water plus a few T of coconut milk & roasted zucchini,  yellow squash & onion.

I tasted the spices before putting in the chicken.  Although I have no cayenne pepper and no McIlhenny's I do have Korean chili paste so I used that.  The flavor of the spices is good and goes together well.  I am slow cooking this for tomorrow.  It will be good with rice and the leftovers could be good for barbecue or stir fry, even chicken salad.  What I like best is that these are inexpensive ingredients likely to be in a typical pantry.   Ps one teaspoon garlic powder was enough when doubling the amount.

I didn't have any limes in the house so I made this using all the other exact ingredients and just substituted lemon juice for lime juice.  It was so flavorful and had a nice crisp to the chicken.  I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing this easy recipe.

I substituted cumin for the cayenne, less heat but still has a kick. Added sweet corn and black beans after cooking the chicken and served over rice. Yummy!

I followed the recipe exactly the way it is written and the chicken came out superb.  Thanks for sharing.  Delicious!
The only change was, I used wings and thighs instead of breast and when I ran out, I made another mixture to cover the amount of chicken I used.

I halved the amount of cayenne. It’s just a bit too spicy for us as written.  Let the chicken sit and brown; don’t move it around a lot and it will crust up deliciously.

Very easy and very tasty dish to make.  One recommendation we have is to reduce the amount of salt by 1/4 tsp as we found it a little too salty for our taste buds....but that’s just our personal preference.

Family loved it - including the picky 3 year old.  Somewhat followed the recommendations and reduced some of the garlic powder.  Also toned down the cayenne since the kid was going to eat it.   Will be adding this as a staple to my meal plans.  Thanks!

I slightly pounded three boneless breasts and doubled the spice mixture (while still being careful with the cayenne). We do not like things too spicy.  I let the spice mixture rest on the raw chicken for quite a while before cooking. I also added 1/2 cup chicken broth to sauce.

This was a fast yummy dish for last minute company tonight. It didn’t take a lot of time to prepare and was well received. I doubled the spices, an absolute must, but not the lime juice. And as other reviewers suggested, I added a half cup of chicken stock so it cooked moist. A keeper for weekday dinners.

We did not use as much garlic in the end.  Next time I am going to make the leftover juice into a gravy form.  That way it spoons over the top and sticks better.

Delicious! I was actually surprised at how good this was, considering how basic the ingredients are, but the lime adds a whole new dimension to this dish! I was expecting the dryness that usually accompanies pan-seared chicken breasts, but I was met with tons of flavor and moisture! On my variation, I tripled the recipe for the seasoning because I like a lot of seasoning on my chicken, and it was perfect! I also substituted the thyme for oregano since that was what I had in the cabinet. This dish was so easy, and it will definitely become a staple in our household!

I followed the recipe except that I added quartered petite red potatoes that had been microwaved to the same skillet for the last five minutes so that they picked up the sauce. Excellent.

I loved this recipe. As a single gal, I halved the recipe (used only one chicken breast) but still added more spices then necessary and put extra spices into the  oil and butter. Which were just enough to keep  it from becoming dry. Also, didn't measure the lime juice or garlic powder , just added with abandon at the end.  I put the chicken with Oil/butter/spices mixture on a salad, soooo delicious and healthy. 

I think next time, will try broiling it in the oven instead of  putting it on the skillet, and not use butter.

Made it based on some of the reviews, adding a little honey, fresh garlic and chicken broth and pounding the breasts a bit. Soooooo good and moist! Kids loved it!

I made this  as written and the dish came out fantastic. Just enough spice for our taste.  I used 2 chicken leg quarters  and there were enough spices for that so if I use the 4 breasts as recommended by the recipe, I'd have to double the spices as suggested by other reviewers. I rubbed the chicken with the spices and also underneath the skin. The skin came out nice and crispy, the meat flavorful. I did not try the chicken broth but will do that the next time. Thanks for sharing the recipe. This one is a keeper.

Followed the recipe.  I’d probably decrease the spice and maybe shred the chicken to get more flavor.

I used almost double the spice mixture on the chicken that I let sit in the fridge a few hours.  Added several Tablespoons of chicken broth to the lime mixture but with less than called for Garlic powder.  Good, quick dinner.

This is fabulous, a little spice and the lime is the best. I  did add a tablespoon more of butter as suggested to increase sauce and used a iron skillet to coOK  two chicken beasts in. Will add to my favorites, thanks for the recipe!

I was planning to make several chicken breast halves, cooking them quickly at 450F in the oven, so I adapted this recipe to use that method for a couple of the breast halves. (I put four other breast halves in a different pan, using a plainer recipe.) Next time I'm cooking a smaller quantity of chicken, I'll try this recipe on the stovetop according to recipe instructions and see what difference it makes. I pounded the breast halves flat with an iron skillet, and brined them before cooking. Apart from that I made the recipe as written. The chicken came out juicy and very delicious! It went well with mashed sweet potato and roasted brussels sprouts. Tonight for dinner, I warmed the leftovers with cooked brown rice, a baby spinach/baby kale mix, and a few grape tomatoes, and it was again delicious. (I made a bit of extra sauce by adding chicken broth, garlic, and lime juice to what I had left over, and added a bit of flour to thicken.)  Recipe highly recommended, if you like lime juice, as I do.

Although I liked the taste of the seasoning quite a bit, there wasn't enough of it. Even when I doubled the recipe for spice mix, it only barely covered the chicken. I would at least triple the spice ingredients next time.

Made this for my family (I’m vegetarian) but they all said it was delicious. As the chicken was finishing up cooking I added chicken broth to add more to the sauce, because much of the previously added lime juice had cooked off, and continued to add lime juice to make sure the lime taste didn’t go away. Served with rice pilaf and steamed broccoli, it smelled and looked delicious that I forgot to take a picture before everyone ate it. Whoops.

absolutely loved it. I used 3 times the amount of the spices, and 1 1/2 the mount of the olive oil, butter, garlic powder and lime juice. I also used 1 cup of low sodium chicken broth. I didn't add all the liquid at once just added as the need occurred. I made 5 chicken breast. So very good

Made this to go with Cuban black beans.  Mixed 4x the amount of dry spices and rubbed onto flattened chicken.  Zested a lime on top of  spiced chicken.   Let chicken rest in a pan in the fridge overnight, covered.  Squeezed lime juice over chicken and cooked at 350 for about an hour.  Moist, juicy and delicious!  Lower calorie than original recipe.  Will make again as a simple and flavorful meat main.

Its really great but needs some tweeks. Less garlic at the end and a bit more lime. And to call it spicy, id have to add more peppers. But its still very delicious and will use recipe as a base in the future!

We absolutely Love this chicken recipe. What an interesting and authentic twist on spice combining. It’s super easy to prepare. I added the spices to a large ziplock bag to combine. I then put good quality free range boneless skinless chicken breasts into the bag, zipped it up and moved it around enough to coat the spices all over each piece. I put in the fridge and let marinade for 6-8 hours, moving the chicken around a bit every 2-3 hours.

I made the seasoning exactly as stated.  My chicken breast was over an inch thick, so I did have to cook it longer. I also added a little water after it had browned for awhile and had some nice carmelization in the pan. Really no need to add broth. I'm single, so I only made one and have extra seasoning which I think would be fabulous on chicken wings, and shrimp. Be prepared for a very spicy flavor. Loved it!

Great, quick recipe. It’s flavorful; however, the seasoning mixture was not enough to coat the chicken to my liking. I added a few dashes of each item directly to the chicken (front and back) once I noticed I did not have enough.  I will likely increase each item except for the salt by 1/8 or 1/4 tsp next time and see if that works out.

Very easy to make and pretty tasty. The salt seemed a little much though and the heat level for a “spicey” dish a little low. Think I’ll reduce the salt and add something a little hotter to compensate next time.

This is one of our go to favorites.  We change it up a bit for quicker cooking, and cut the chicken breasts into chunks.  Almost always served with buttered rice and roasted brussels sprouts, yum!

This an excellent chicken dish. I cooked it in the oven instead of frying it. Healthier and I left it too late to marinate for the 2 hours. I only did that for about a half hour or so. I put a potato in with the chicken, which had some of the flavor of the sauce.

Super easy. Rave reviews from my 11 & 9 yo boys. I toned down the spice just a tad and added a little honey to 2/3c chicken broth with a teaspoon of corn starch to deglaze the pan and thicken the sauce a bit. Was perfect--particularly since I had no idea what to do for dinner 30 mins before we sat down to eat. :-)

Love the seasoning on chicken - love it on shrimp more! Made a lil’ jar full and use two teaspoons of the dry seasoning for every 1lb of protein (plus the lime, of course!) I have tried adding all the garlic powder at once and while cooking and don’t find much difference so my seasoning just includes it all at once. Sometimes I add a fresh clove of pressed garlic to the mix. Yum!

I added about two tablespoons of panko bread crumbs just to give it a little more depth and it worked! Amazing! Oh yeah, I also ran out of lime so I used lemon juice instead and lemon oil I recently bought on my trip to California. WOW!

I’ve made this a few times now. It’s very easy but full of flavour. I incorporate a half cup of chicken stock with the lime juice. It helps cut some of the tartness of the limes and adds more juices.  I prefer to use boneless skinless chicken thighs but the breasts work just as well.

Quick to make and flavorful.  I usually don't modify recipes the first time but I did have to add some chicken broth to the lime juice for enough sauce.

I made this for my family tonight and even my pivky younger brother liked it! Although i didnt have any black pepper or onion powder so i substituted them for a poultry seasoning mix that had both  and used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. This will definitely be going in my recipe book!

I ended up baking my chicken instead of cooking it on the stove but this spice blend was delicious! Though I do agree with many of the people on here, there simply wasn't enough of it to cover all of the chicken, I only used two breasts and it barely covered them. I also halved the amount of garlic powder that I used too since a few of the reviews warned that it would overpower the other spices.

Absolutely delicious!   The flavors melded together well giving the chicken a rich flavor .  I used boneless skinless thighs instead of breasts.   Juicy and full of flavor.

I marinaded the mix and it was over the top!!! So many people ask me for this recipe. I am an average cook because of my work hours but WOW!! This makes me look like a rockstar in the kitchen ?? Only mention I have is I don’t use garlic powder. I use minced refrigerated garlic preserved in olive oil"

This was OK.  I used tenders.  They were moist, but not very spicy.  I should have doubled the spice mix as recommended by others.

This is delicious! Something different to put on the table. I had 5 chicken breasts. I doubled all the spices except salt and the butter and oil. I used 1/2 cup each lime juice and chicken broth and threw in a couple of dashes of tequila.  Definitely serve extra sauce with the chicken. It's a game changer. Highly recommend this one.

Delicious, but like others have said needs a larger amount of dry ingredients. 

I also made extra dry rub mix at the end to eat without the lime juice in the future, it's delicious and will go perfect with rice.

As somebody suggested, I doubled up on the seasoning (with just one portion’s worth of salt!) for the dry rub and added 1/4 of chicken broth to the skillet when cooking. It was delicious! I will be making this again!

Delicious chicken and pretty easy to make as well. You can eyeball the spices because a  lot of it comes off in the initial rub down. I ended up adding more paprika and cayenne after putting the chicken in the pan to get more bright red color.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions to dredge the chicken in flour, but did not pound or flatten the breast pieces like I wanted to. It didn't matter, as the chicken managed to cook evenly and thoroughly per the recipes instructions (+1-2 minutes a side and +2 mins during the final cook).

This is a really good recipe.  Full of flavor...I added extra lime juice only because I love all foods lemons and limes.  For this recipe, even if I didn’t add extra lime juice, it still would have been perfect..

Delicious blend of flavors for any type of meat, especially chicken or seafood.  We grilled the chicken with the dry seasonings and then basted with the paste mixture the last 10 minutes of grilling.  The family loved it!

My husband loved this.  He does not care for spicy food.  This seemed, to me, it might be too spicy for him.  But he said  while it  gave a slight warmth on the tongue, it did not have the heat like he might get from jalapenos.  I took reviewers advise and doubled the spice quantity.  i also added some chicken stock and a bit a tequila to the sauce.

I did make changes due to what I had in my chicken- I used chicken thighs but all else was unchanged and even my neighbor as well as my husband said it was incredibly delicious!
Of course we love garlic- Oh no I lied I ran out of lime and used lemon to supplement.

Great recipe and super simple to make. Like some other reviewers, I upped the spice quantities somewhat (in particular, doubled the black pepper) but that's just my personal preference. This is a tasty recipe, recommended.

This was fabulous!  I want to eat healthy but still crave the full Doritoes like flavor.  This has it all!  I even use less than the recommended salt  amount and love all the flavor it creates.  Best part of all I already had all these spices in my cabinet !

This was a very tasty dish.  I loved the spiciness and lime flavor.  I doubled the rub ingredients.  After adding the rub to both side of the chicken breasts, I put the chicken in the refrigerator and cooked the chicken the next morning.  The chicken was not dry which I was concerned about.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I loved it! My wife loved it as well. I served it with creamy chicken rice and French style Green beans! Will be making it again! I doubled the amount of rub. This is a mixture I'll likely make a batch of and put in a shaker.  This was my first time cooking chicken and I appreciated having an actual Time set to cook it.

It was delicious! I took the recommendation of another reviewer and decreased the second round of garlic sprinkle a bit. But rather than eat it with tortillas, I had it over a salad. Thumbs up all around the dinner table. I will be preparing a batch of the mixture ahead of time so I have it ready for dinner. As a reviewer noted, next time I will add a bit more under the skin of the chicken breast for even more flavor.

This was so tasty, there were very few leftovers!  The only thing I did different, was I used bone in Thighs, that is what I had on hand.  This chicken was very tasty, with just a little kick!  What I loved, was, as the chicken was cooking in the skillet, it made a tasty gravy that I poured over the chicken after I plated it!  I did also add some fresh sliced garlic as the chicken was sauteing. I will definitely make this one again!  One of the best things about it, its so easy to make!  Thanks C. Perez!

I am famous for going to store and forgetting an ingredient, which in this case was the lime.  Sprinkled breasts and deboned thighs with all the seasonings, putting the seasoned side down in large cast iron skillet, and repeating the seasoning on the naked side up.  After completely cooked through, a bit more olive oil and took the chopped broccoli and stir fried in the pan full of seasoning, sprinkling salt pepper and light coating of garlic while cooking..crunchy texture.  Very good and healthy!

Yummers! This recipe is delicious! After reading the reviews, I, too, doubled the spices and marinated the chicken (for about 30-45 minutes). I added about 1/4 cup of chicken broth as well. The only change I'd make is to add more broth for more drippings! Served it over rice with a side of green beans and baked sweet potatoes. *edit - I did not double the salt.

Easy to make sense you do not have to marinate the meat.  The chicken was juicy and very flavorful.  My wife was scared it would be too spicy, but it wasn't at all.  If you you want it more spicy add more cayenne pepper.

I pounded the chicken breasts , seasoned one side and rolled a good amount of goat cheese into the breasts.  The goat cheese was strong enough to stand up to the spices for a wonderfully rich and balanced flavor.  I increased the blended spice mix and cut the final garlic dusting in half.  Also added half a cup of chicken stock for the sauce.  Some of the goat cheese melts into the sauce for an an amazing flavor and consistency!  My wife is quite the food critic and she complemente the dish multiple times throuout the meal.  We both agreed that this dish will be a regular in our household.

I Agree with others that you could double or triple the spices. I only had one large piece of chicken breast and used the recipe as is and it was really tasty. I do think I could have used a little broth and cut the amount of butter and oil only to save on the calories and not for any other reason. Not that I thought the amount of butter and oil was a lot but I only had one chicken breast and used the same amount to oil/butter.

Awesome dish. Followed recipe to the letter except for not using 1/8 measurements. Seemed a little unnecessary. Served with green beans and Rice a Roni Cilantro Lime rice mix.

I doubled the recipe and added chicken broth. Was very tender and good flavor. Quick and easy. Would definitely make again.

We chunked up the chicken breast and out the seasonings in a gallon size bag to mix thouroughly. Then instead of adding the additional 2 tsp of garlic powder and 3 tbsp of lime juice, we added fresh sliced garlic and the juice of 1 lime. This will become a frequent meal in our house!!!!! Excellent!!!!!

The whole family loved this recipe and I’ll definitely be making it again. As suggested, I added a bit of chicken broth so we’d have sauce for on top of the cilantro lime rice I paired it with. Delicious and super easy.

Very good recipe. I did the chicken broth and I only did two breast. Definitely would need to double the dry rub ingredients for 4 breast.

This is the BEST chicken recipe I've tried in a very long time!  Everyone likes it so much that I'm going to make jars of the spice and pair it with bottles of lime juice to put  into Christmas packages for my daughters :)

I've served it with rice and I've made wraps with this chicken recipe.  It's a hit with everyone I've served it to.  

Pairing it with tzatziki makes it absolutely DIVINE!!!

I loved the spices and ease of this recipe. As other cooks stated, I doubled the amount of spices. That gave it just the right amount of heat and flavor for my family. I didn't have chicken breasts on hand and used bone-in thighs. I browned the chicken thighs in the fat then finished them in the oven at 375 degrees. I deglazed the fry pan with chicken broth and the lime and added some fresh garlic. That made a delicious sauce for rice.

Pretty tasty dinner. I used 2 large half breasts, but kept the spices the same. Used 1 Tbsp butter and 1/2 tbsp oil. 
I added some lemon zest to the rub, but the citrus flavors were overpowered by the cayenne, to me anyway. I think next time I'll go less heat, more citrus. 
Great easy weekday recipe though! Thanks!

Delicious! I changed it only by doubling the spices because I had 8 chicken breasts. (I had to cut four in half because they were so dang thick) I also added 3/4 cup of chicken broth and I didn't add the extra garlic powder near the end. Unbelievably quick and tasty. My guys loved it! :)

This was excellent.  I did increase the amounts of seasoning slightly as someone recommended that there wasn't enough to coat the chicken.  It came out excellent and everyone loved it.  It was just enough spicy to taste so yummy.

It's more of a hint of spice rather than a truly spicy dish. Overall, it's well spiced, and I will definitely make it again. I think I'll try it with more pepper and less lime next time.

Liked the flavor of the chicken but I think next time I make it I will use less garlic powder. Way too much garlic powder. I might even try real garlic! Overall very tasty though!

4 stars as-is.  The spice rub is great, but the technique needs a bit of tweaking:  Here's how I made it a 5-star recipe:  Rub the chicken with the spices and then cook the chicken in a stainless steel or cast-iron skillet, something that will leave behind a good amount of fond.  Remove the chicken but keep the heat on, mince a few cloves of garlic and add it to the skillet, stir for about 20-30 seconds.  De-glaze the skillet with somewhere between 1/2 to 1 cup chicken stock, add the juice of 1/2 lime (per two chicken breasts), and as others have suggested, a splash of tequila.  Reduce the stock, add butter, and stir.  Spoon this garlic-lime-tequila-butter pan sauce over the chicken.  Serve!

I cut the breasts into strips, tenderized them with a beat down, added about 1 TBS freshly grated ginger, marinaded for three hours and cooked in a pressure cooker.  Next time I need to adjust the proportions because it tasted "good" but not perfect.

This was really, really good! I followed everyone’s advice & doubled the spice ingredients (except for the cayenne.) I doubled the sauce, too and add a tiny bit of honey and chicken broth to make more sauce. Everyone liked it! Thank you for the recipe!

this might be in the rotation now.  maybe a bit on the salty side, so you might hold back a little on that, but great recipe.  also, with such a good rub, the garlic powder at the end isn't needed.

Loved this!  I only made two.  Cut ingredients in half. Pounded the chicken to make it cook more evenly.  Read others who said there was too much garlic at the end. Not a big fan of garlic so I eliminated that part of the garlic.  Definitely making again.  Company-worthy!

My first review here because this chicken was SOO DELICIOUS! I made 4 pieces of chicken breast and hubby ate 3 of them! Just make sure to maybe double the amount of spices because I didn’t think it was enough. Other than that, I can’t wait to make it again.... but next time it will be 8 pieces!!!

I made this dish tonight for my family and dinner guest and everyone loved it. I doubled the seasonings because we like flavor but I would definitely make this dish again.

Great dish and so easy. Everyone loved it. I used Rosemary instead of Thyme. And when I flipped the chicken after 5 minutes, I added some chicken broth to add flavor and create more of a sauce. Super good!!!

Double the spices. If you decide to add the broth I would definitely make it with jasmine rice. My fiance couldn't stop eating it and he is picky. This will definitely be a staple in our home.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish very much - it 's quite tasty and does not take alot of time to make. Based on comments from other reviewers, at the sauce step (when you are supposed to add the garlic powder and lime), I added chicken broth and garlic paste (about a tablespoon - less which makes it pretty garlicky), which comes in a tube ( I used the Amore brand).

I did use garlic powder in the seasoning mix that is sprinkled on the chicken. Also, I made more seasoning mix than called for because reviewers commented that the recipe does not make enough to cover the chicken, which turned  out to be a good move.

We sliced the chicken against the grain and made soft chicken tacos with lettuce,  chopped tomatoes, minced red onion and fresh cilantro, and drizzled the sauce on top. Delish - I would definitely make this again!

Loved it! I omitted the lime juice and additional garlic at the end because I felt it would mask the flavor. I also added a bit more cayenne and paprika...I’ve always like food with a bit kore heat to it. Turned out great!

These were good, but maybe not terribly memorable. I sliced mine and put it on top of a green salad and it was a good use for them.

Used 2 breasts cut in half and pounded to even out. Used twice as much spices- rubbed both sides and marinated in fridge all afternoon. Went light on the dried thyme- personal preference. This spice rub was excellent and we all loved it. Used 3 plus maybe a little more T fresh lime juice and thought it was over powering but maybe because I only used 2 breasts? There was no juice so I had to add a little chicken stock. I think with some doctoring the sauce could be excellent. I may even just air fry the chicken next try. Lots of potential with this base as a start thanks for the recipe

Excellent spice blend  — marinated in dry rub for six hours, added chicken stock to the sauce and due to size of pieces of bone-in breasts, pre-heated oven to 425 and completed cooking in roasting pan once pan method completed... juicy, tender and flavourful results....

Instant family favorite!  Took the advice of others & pounded the chicken, doubled the amount of spices & added 1/2 cup chicken broth at the end to deglaze.  Also took the advice to decrease lime by 1/2 & lowered the red pepper to 1/8 tsp so the kids wouldn't complain it's too spicy).  No complaints!  So juicy & wonderfully spiced!!

I had several large chicken breasts to use up, and this recipe sounded good.  Since the breasts were so large, I only used three.  I only browned the outside and then removed them from the pan.  I sliced the chicken about 1-1.5" thick, against the grain.  I returned the sliced breasts back to the pan and continued with the recipe.  They turned out very good.  The leftovers are great on a salad!

This is a simple recipe that I don't have to run to the store for ingredients. I did take the advice of others and doubled the seasoning, used fresh minced garlic in rub and added a little than 1/2 cup of chicken broth to the drippings,after I took the chicken out of the pan. 2 things I did different was to thin slice the breast for a quicker cook and add a little cornstarch to the drippings to make a delicious pour over sauce. Family loved it.

This recipe is so delicious and super easy to make considering I always have these items on hand! The only adjustments I made was I added soy sauce to the lime juice and garlic mixture and it turned out absolutely incredible.
Highly recommend!

This was very lime tasting to me.  And it never made a "sauce", more of a rub.  The chicken looked great!   Might omit the lime juice next time.

My family loved the spice rub! 
I used chicken thighs, cut them into strips, and mixed the spice rub in a few hours before I cooked it.  Great flavor, though I might 1 1/2 the spice mix next time.

This was really very good.  Came together very quickly.  I did 1.5 the spices to cover the chicken and also pounded the 1/2s thinner for quicker cooking.  I also added about 1/4 cup (or less) chicken broth to create a little more sauce.  Served with couscous and peas and both my kids ate it well (it is a little spicy and my kids were fine, but you could cut back on peppers if that was a worry).

This was very easy and flavorful. My husband says it had a transformation of taste from sweet to salty to tangy this spicy. The only difference in what I did is I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and poured the seasonings over top while cooking. Very delicious!

One word, delicious.  I was looking for a tasty recipe for chicken breasts, and this was definitely it.  I didn’t have lime juice and used lemon instead.  I followed the rest of the directions for a fabulous meal.  Thank you.

Soo good! Bursting with flavor. I forgot to add the extra garlic powder while frying the chicken and it was still delicious! Would definitely recommend!

Now that’s flavorful chicken!  I used chicken thighs (because that’s what I had available).  I’ve been looking for a recipe like this. And I’ll be making a dry seasoning mix to keep on hand!  Thanks for the recipe.

Not as flavorful as I’d hoped. It’s a good spice mix, but next time I’ll be adding larger quantities of each ingredient and being much more generous with the lime juice.

just made this wonderful dish. I assume it's perfect as it is, but I made a couple of changes. instead of garlic powder, I used fresh garlic. I just sauted them with the chicken. and I used lots of chili powder as I wanted it to be spicy. it turned out really good. will definitely make this again. Made some mashed potatoes and steamed some broccoli for the side.

I was incredibly hesitant while cooking this because it seemed that the sauce was going to be way too oily however it turned out wonderfully! Definitely on my list for a regular dish. Being a lover of garlic I used fresh minced garlic and pressed it into the chicken before cooking and added some to the sauce as well, to make sure the lime flavour really came through I used one freshly squeezed lime. It really makes a difference! Overall I loved this recipe!

Good flavor, but not my favorite. If you are in a pinch and just need food, it  will do the trick as a quick chicken dinner.

I made this as is! I didn't need to cook my chicken as long since it was quite thin, I didn't want it to dry out. The only issue I had was the amount of salt. I typically like a lot of salt on my food but this was a bit over powering. I recommend reducing to 1/2 tsp and then letting people adjust themselves. Also, I didn't use fresh lime juice and it turned out fine.

I had two huge chicken breasts and this was just enough  seasoning for them.  I would definitely double the receipe  for more.  I loved the flavor.  I also made a coconut lime rice that was a delicious compliment.

The flavor was really great, however I feel like it may have worked better as a marinade? 

The chicken turned out dry  (Probably due to me not being the best cook ) so maybe increasing the serving of spices/oils and treating it as a marinade would have helped me. 

At the end of it, the sauce reduced down too much, so I ended up adding more oil and cutting up the chicken into small chunks. Maybe the chicken breasts I used were too thick? 

I altered things a bit, using Italian seasoning instead of just parsley. Either way, the chicken's flavor was off the charts, and I'd totally try making it again! :D

I thought the extra garlic powder at the end might be overpowering, so I included it in the original rub instead. My grocer sells giant mutant chicken breasts -- like, a pound each -- so I cut them in half as if to butterfly them. Like other reviewers, I didn't find the mixture enough to "generously" rub onto the chicken. I really liked how the lime juice brightened the sauce without overpowering it. WIth some adjustments to the rub amounts, I would definitely make this again.

After reading all the reviews, I started off by doubling all the spices and using fresh garlic and onion instead of powdered. I kept the lime to the original 3 T, but added a lot of fresh garlic and 1/2 a cup of chicken broth to finish up the cooking. I served with salad, li hing mui starfruit and  mashed potatoes. The extra pan gravy was good on the potatoes and the family definitely enjoyed it - my youngest asked to have it in her lunch box the next day.

Made it without  the onion powder or thyme, instead added onion and green pepper slices in step 2 and it tasted fantastic. I am a college student mind you, and I made this all by myself in under an hour.

I followed the direction exactly and I thought the chicken was overcooked.  Next time I will reduce the cooking time to 4 minutes per side and then cook a bit longer at the end to keep chicken from getting dry.  I did add a bit of chicken broth at the end to help make a bit more "sauce".  I also used fresh garlic at the end versus garlic powder.

I flattened the chicken breasts and cut them in half so they would cook faster. I doubled the amount of spices in the spice mixture so there would be enough to cover all the chicken. And I used less garlic powder in the end. It got rave reviews from the friends I made it for!

I made zero substitutions. I'll start with the pros:

Chicken came out very juicy at the recommended cook time. I did spend pretty much the entire time after the first flip basting the chicken, though. The lime also adds some incredible flavor, never thought about using lime during the cooking process for chicken like this. Quite tasty. 

Cons: While the chicken itself is juicy and whatnot, the spices weren't all there. The amount of salt was fine, but in the future I think I would add more pepper and ABSOLUTELY more cayenne/paprika. I might have even doubled both of those amounts, if not tripled the cayenne. I was really hoping for some nice heat on the chicken but none of it came through, disappointing on that front. 

I served this dish alongside some bacon maple Brussels sprouts and it was an excellent pairing. EDIT: I accidentally lied, I did make one change. The garlic powder added at the end I halved because 2 teaspoons there is just way too much. The garlic came through without overpowering the dish, like others here are saying.

We loved this and only made one change, doubled the Cayenne pepper. If I make again I will double the entire rub and add about a cup of chicken broth. Really would like it saucier. But I reviewed as written!

Delicious on the grill! I sliced the chicken breasts into two about 1/2" thickness because they were quite large, and after spicing them I squeezed lime juice on and let sit for an hour. I also drizzled on a little olive oil so they wouldn't dry out. Med. hot grill, about 8 minutes a side. After grilling they were so good!

I made this with chicken quarters so decided to bake it instead. Squeezed the lime directly on the chicken, left the lime rinds in the pan, and covered it with foil with the melted butter and olive oil covering the bottom of the pan. Baked for 45 minutes on 450 and then broiled for 10 minutes to crisp up the skin. Delicious!

I reduced the amount of cayenne pepper to about 3/4 of a tsp because it was too spicy for my family.  Other than that, this is now my new favorite meal.

My family loved it!  The spice recipe was not enough so I made some more for the last chicken breast half.  The spices are extremely powerful, but are so delicious with the chicken that we didn't care.  I also cut the chicken breast into halves horizontally so that it would be thinner and cook faster.  I cooked each side for maybe 1-2 minutes before adding the lemon-garlic powder sauce and it was perfect.

This is EXCELLENT !! An instant easy favorite, going right into the recipe book!

Made it twice - the first time I followed the recipe exactly, the second time I made 3 adjustments that turned this good recipe into a stellar one. On the second round, I added 1/3c chicken broth and TRIPLED the spices, while completely omitting the garlic powder at the end. 

All of those were suggested by other users, and seriously, I love this stuff ! The chicken was wonderfully moist and there was plenty of sauce to toss over my rice and veggies, giving those a tasty kick !

Following the recipe exactly left the chicken a teeny bit dry, and there was barely enough of the spice mix for two medium chicken breasts ! Tripling the spices gave me enough for four chicken breasts.

I thought this was good.  This was an easy week-night meal. I was heavy handed on all of the spices, but I left out the cayenne pepper so my kids would eat it. I sprinkled on a little Frank's hot sauce instead. I only used 1 T Butter, and I just sprinkled with garlic powder at the end instead of 2 teaspoons, which I thought would be way too much.

My family raved about this dish. I have made it a few times now and everyone loves it (one person says it is too spicy but great flavor. I always have these ingredients on hand and it is a fast and simple dinner to put together. Like many others I double and sometimes triple the sauce recipe because my family loves to drizzle it on rice.

I've made this recipe many times and I love it! I prefer more seasoning and sauce, so I double or even triple those. I also use minced garlic instead of powder. I serve it with rice and a vegetable. If I remember, I will mix up a large batch of the seasoning and keep in a jar so I'm not mixing it up every time.

I doubled most of the spices and the lime juice. (Actually, just juiced 5 little limes.) Used one clove fresh garlic instead of powder, and frozen parsley instead of dried. And, since I had no chicken broth handy, I added about 1/3 cup of regular sherry. Afterward, I wished I had added the sherry first, boiled it down a bit, and then added the lime juice. And maybe a little less of it! It tasted good though. (I had just under 2 pounds of chicken breasts--three half-breasts.) I'll make it again.

I will definitely make this again. I made it as stated in the recipe. I had a very large chicken breast (you know, the chicken on steroids kind) and it is just my hubby and me. I used this one breast which I sliced into 7 slices. I left everything else the same. The chicken had a nice, slightly spicy flavor that is not overpowering. This chicken is good on its own, but I saved a slice and chopped it up in my salad for lunch tomorrow.

Very, very good.  Made it just like instructions said and my daughter says it is a 'keeper'.  Leftovers are being sliced and put aside to go on salads for lunch.

The spices in this recipe are just fantastic. In my case, I was looking for a spicy lime chicken recipe for quesadillas, and this worked out perfectly. Needless to say, I didn’t need to worry about sauce, so I skipped out on some of the suggestions about adding broth.

But, I will say that it turned out a bit too salty for our tastes. And we don’t shrink back from salt here, so that’s saying something. I’m going to cut the salt in half for the next batch, which will probably be soon. The rest of the flavors, and especially the sour lime, were off-the-charts good!

Honestly, I think this turned out like very good blackened chicken you might get at a restaurant. It would be excellent on a salad. One of the reasons I like this recipe so much is that it lets me make chicken that is extremely versatile (thinly sliced for a hot sandwich, with melted mozzarella?).

In my case, I did make a couple changes. We use avocado oil for all our heated oil cooking needs, so that was used with the butter instead. I also used only one pack of two chicken breasts from Costco, each cut in half the long way. Lastly, we like it spicy, so we quadrupled the amount of cayenne pepper. We’ll probably go 6X on the next run (1-1/2 tsp). Also, skipped out on the garlic powder at the finish.

Everything else I followed to the letter. Though, I did double the recipe so I could coat both sides of each slice of chicken. It ended up being not quite enough, so I may triple it next time.

Fast and easy! Made everything a 1/4 tsp and I put a lid on while cooking the chicken to lessen any splatter and to help keep the chicken moist. I also threw some fresh garlic in the pan while the oil and butter was heating up. Had the chicken on a bed of greens for a low carb meal, with a lime dressing and chopped some cilantro on it ! Great, with just the perfect spice!

Decided to marinate the thighs in lime juice and the spices first also added fresh garlic.   Turned out very tasty and flavorful.  This is a keeper and wonderful with thighs.  I put the lime juice on after turning and continued.  Go Very easy on the garlic powder in the end.

Absolutely delicious! Added a little bit of Parmesan cheese on top for extra flavor! We ended up using only 1 chicken breast because of how big it was, but for more than 2 people I would certainly cook more. Thank you for the recipe.

This was great! My wife and I gobbled up 1.3 pounds worth of chicken tacos made with these spices. I did almost double the amount of spices, and we cut up thinly sliced chicken breasts from Kroger, tossing the pieces in a ziploc to coat. Very good with guac and sour cream.

This was good &  I will make it again.  served it with a green salad and mexican rice (used Knorr tomato bouillon w/chicken flavor to flavor it).  I will agree with the other reviewers who say that the spice rub mixture isn't enough. I only made two chicken breast halves, and what the recipe calls for was barely enough.   If you're making four servings, then I would suggest you at least double the dry ingredients.

Use a seasoned cast iron pan if you have one!

I've made this chicken several times now, and it has easily become my favorite chicken!  It is incredibly flavorful and goes great with fajitas or on its own.  Like others have posted, I made a bit more of the seasoning mix than the recipe called for to thoroughly cover the chicken, but aside from that, I followed the recipe just as it is.   Absolutely wonderful!  Goes great with pineapple lime rice!

This was easy to make and tasted great!  I used bone in chicken thighs with skin and put some spices under the skin and the remainder of the spices on the sop of the chicken (based on another reviewer's comments).  We will be eating this again at our house!

This is great! Just be forewarned that if you're using really large chicken breasts, you'll need to double the amount of spice rub and adjust the cooking time. I usually buy organic breasts, which tend to be smaller, but had to use conventional this time. I could only fit two per pan! Even after pounding them flat, they needed 10 minutes in the oven at 350 after browning on each side. Then I took them out and finished the sauce on the stove. They were juicy and flavorful with a nice crust.

I was on the light side of the 1/4 tsp with the cheyenne pepper but really didn't need to be, so don't be shy.  The lime really softens any spice.

We did this without the butter, as I am on a Whole30 diet and it was really great.  We may have used more spice mixture than necessary (we ran out), but that worked for me.

My husband said, "Feel free to make double next time. This is delicious!" One change: I always double the spice mixture, so that there is enough to nicely cover both sides of the chicken. Thank you for the excellent recipe.

I made this exactly as written but I didn't really care for it. WAY too much garlic powder to end with (and I LOVE garlic). If I were to try it again, I might use real garlic instead of the powder, but there are so many other great recipes to try, that it's not on the top of my list.

Good!  Quick and juicy.  I, too only used two good sized boneless chicken breasts - the seasoning listed is really only enough for two, not 4.  Squeezed fresh lime over the top to finish; will make again!  Edited to add:  do not add the extra garlic powder - it doesn't need it.

I would caution to not over cook the chicken it literally takes a few minutes per-side. And don't be cheap on the lime and it'll turn out every time.

My favorite recipe to make.   It is easy and delicious.  I decrease the cayenne pepper by 50% or more as it gets really spicy otherwise.  I then increase all the seasonings by 4x or more and roll the chicken in it instead of rubbing it in.  I have noticed that this dish will smoke up your house so hopefully you have a good oven fan.

I'm rating this 4 but my hubby would say 5.  I doubled the spices as a lot of reviewers did but I found it way to spicy.  I also added 3/4 cup of my homemade chicken broth with 1/4 cup  daiquiri mix (didn't have any limes) to the pan and mixed 1 T flour to a bit of water and stirred in which made a lovely sauce.  If I make it again (which I'm sure my hubby will want) I think I would use garlic cloves in place of the garlic powder and I don't think I'll double the spices or at least not as much on my piece.

This wasn't bad, and it kept us full for dinner.  There wasn't really enough spice rub, and it wasn't particularly spicy.  We weren't expecting a fire alarm, but the spice was barely perceptible.

We made the recipe pretty much as is, though added minced garlic at the end rather than powdered.

Other problem was maybe specify how much chicken?  Our breasts were likely too large because they were quite dry by the time it reached an appropriate cooking temperature, so it's possible a stint in the oven or a covered dish might retain some moisture.

But a quick and relatively enjoyable weeknight meal.

The only thing I did differently than written was I took another reviewers suggestion and I doubled the spices, and I put all the garlic powder in the mix instead of holding part to add with the lime juice. Next time I think I'll reduce the amount garlic powder a tad. Came out really delicious! Going to put this in the roation for sure!

I used garlic paste instead of powder and mixed it with the seasonings. I added it to the hot oil and butter before adding the chicken and stirred it to allow the flavor to develop, then added the chicken, turning to coat it. It was plenty and coated the chicken easily. I also added a dozen or so roasted garlic cloves I happened to have from the antipasto bar. Perfect!

I make this all the time and it never disappoints! If you want to keep it healthier and omit the butter, it's just as good. Sometimes I use coconut oil instead of olive oil and it's amazingly moist, but the olive oil is good too. I do add a bit more of each spice depending on how much chicken I'm using. You can eat this alone, make a sandwich out if it, tacos, add to your favorite pasta, there are so many options!

Me and my family loved this dish!  Here is my suggestion.  Thaw the chicken breasts just until they can be cut, then half them crosswise.  Fillet each of the pieces into four thin slices and pound them between Press n Seal sheets on a cutting board to make them extra tender.  Other than this filleting  technique I followed the recipe just as written with this one exception.  After the chicken was cooked I mixed a small amount of heavy cream into the drippings in the skillet, turned the chicken to coat evenly then served with buttered pasta noodles sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.  DELICIOUS!  This recipe is a keeper!

IT WAS AMAZING. I made it into a  sandwich with fresh tomatoes and provolone.  I did not have onion powder but it still turned out great. i also took others advice  on limiting the garlic, by just  adding a good sprinkle during the cooking process. Bravo!

I cut the chicken into strips to cook more evenly and so that I could add it to salads and pasta over the next few days.  I didn't measure out the spices perfectly and just winged it!  Turned out great- I love the lime/spice combo- tangy and spicy!

This recipe is sensational! I usually frown on people talking about their alterations. However, in this case I must make an exception. Because I use the spices and do this in the oven. And it is super easy! Just spray your glass baking dish with a little spray oil. Put your chicken breasts in. Season them on both sides. Top with a little spray oil. And bake at 350 until they reach 165 F temperature.   Depending on the size of the breasts – 20 to 35 minutes. Because I use small breasts, I do not flatten them.

This recipe was PERFECT. Only changes I made was adding the garlic powder to my seasonings rub instead of at the end like the recipe called for. I marinaded the seasonings on the chicken overnight and sautéed in butter and olive oil. Sprinkled lime juice and placed in over for an additional 20 mins. Will def be making this spicy chicken delight again! ;)

I made this as written except I didn't have dried parsley and I butterflied two half breasts.  The flavors were great, but the rub only covered the two small pieces of chicken.  It was also a bit salty, but the other ingredients were spot on. I will definitely make this again.

This dish was easy to make and delicious.   My family loved it!  The only thing I  did was cut back on the cayenne  a bit for my husband, but when I make it again I  will sneak a bit more in and gradually ramp it up each time!  Great recipe.

This was so easy and so tasty. Will definitely make again. I had three chicken breasts and cut each of them into four strips. I added a splash of chicken broth and tequila to the sauce for extra flavour. Can't wait to have the leftovers tonight!

This recipe was okay for the chicken.  If we make again, we will lightly brine the chicken breasts, then pound the chicken to even thickness.  Also, the pan sauce was not enough.  I will add some chicken broth to help make more.  

What was really good  was to mixed the little sauce into stir-fried spinach, baby kale, and carrots done with coconut oil,  garlic, and golden mountain Asian seasoning sauce.  The spices and the sour flavor really made the stir fry veggies exceptional!

This was AMAZING! We used 4 chicken breasts (about 2lb) so we took the advice from others who made this recipe and DOUBLED the seasoning... then allowed the chicken to marinade from 9am until 5pm. 

For the second step, we used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder... and we used vegan butter instead of regular (because someone in the family can't have dairy). Using another reviewer's tip, we also added a splash of tequila - always a good thing! 

Cooked to the right temp, this chicken was so flavorful and juicy. Every member of the family gobbled it up and asked for more. One last note I'd like to share - another reviewer suggested adding a bag of spinach into the leftover sauce (after plating the chicken)... and good gracious! That was the best spinach anyone had eaten in quite a well. 

All in all - what a hit! We will definitely make this again soon.

It wasn't spicy at all! If I make this again, I will be increasing the amount of cayenne pepper and decreasing the amount of lime.

We love spicy lime anything. This was excellent. I halved the recipe, and it didn't look like there was enough seasoning for 2 breasts, but the flavor goes a long way. It didn't need a bit more.

This one is definitely a keeper!  We read the reviews first and made a few changes. We pounded the chicken breasts so they were the same thickness. We doubled the seasoning and let the chicken marinade in the seasoning for a couple of hours. After sauteing the chicken breasts as directed, we mixed the lime juice with half a cup of chicken broth and a few cloves of minced garlic. We also added a splash of tequila and a splash of margarita mix for good measure! The chicken was so tender and absolutely delicious. We served it with roast potatoes and vegetables. Fantastic!!

Really good! I doubled the spice mixture because it just didn't seem to be enough for large chicken breasts. I also cut up the breasts into bites, much easier to eat. I served it over rice while putting some of the sauce mixture over the rice. I also used 2 fresh limes. Very good! Not to spicy, garlicy, or limey. Nice balance.

Easy and delicious.  My chicken breasts were thick, so I browned in an iron skillet, and then placed in a 350 degree oven until chicken was cooked through.  Yum.

This chicken was so good! My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. I used chicken thighs and actually doubled the seasoning because I was reading other comments saying that it wouldn't be enough for all four chicken thighs. I flipped the chicken every three minutes for 12 minutes before i put in the lime to prevent it from getting too dark in one area. I served it with a side of Mexican rice, steamed broccoli, and corn. All in all, it was extremely easy to make and super quick. Made for great dinner.

The chicken is great! I added about half a can of chicken broth to make juice. I also cut my chicken into small pieces.  I served with rice and that made it bland. I'll add in fajita veggies next time or maybe grill it and serve with grilled veggies. Over all the chicken has great flavor... Kinda like a spicy lemon pepper.

This had a wonderful flavor and was very easy to make.  I made the full recipe, but only used two chicken breasts and felt the listed ingredients were perfect for this amount.  I substituted the last 2 teaspoons of garlic with one minced clove of fresh garlic and the flavors were very complimentary.  You could taste both the lime and the garlic.  I will make this again.

Makes very small amount of seasoning, I put fresh gatlic and diced jalapeno in the oil and butter mix and would recommend a little less salt but it was a delicious recipe.

it was very good, but i changed a few things as suggested. doubled up on all the spices except cayenne and thyme (i was out of thyme). I also cooked it with the lime juice instead of adding it at the end. after i was done i made a sauce with about 3/4 chicken stock it was awesome! this is a very flavorful dish so i prepared it with white rice.  My husband say H#LL yeah this is/was good about 6 times. so i will make this again for sure! thanks!

I just did a couple of things different, I doubled the rub and I filleted the chicken breasts and cut those in half for smaller pieces.  Then I sautéed some peppers and onions before I fried the chicken, and set those aside.  During the last 5 mins of the chicken cooking I added the peppers back to the pan and covered the pan.  Served over brown rice and a wedge of fresh lime.   This recipe was very, very good and will make again!

Incredible.

I added all the ingredients, with a little extra lime juice, and used it as a marinade.  Grilled, the chicken was amazing.  My guests proclaimed it was the best chicken ever.

This was soooo amazing. Some of the best chicken I've ever made. Granted, the oil and butter in my pan turned black and I didn't want burnt bits in my "sauce" so I switched pans. The only thing I changed was that I left out the parsley because I'm not a fan.

This was super easy and very tasty.  Whole gang loved it!  I will definitely make it again. Just followed the recipe as it is except I didn't have purple onions so I used sweet - still great.

This was wonderful!  I did add, like others, 1/2 cup chicken broth, a splash of tequila, and 1 1/2 tablespoons of honey.  The combination of flavors was amazing.  Thanks so much.

Very good with a few alterations.  I doubled the spices, except for the cayenne (personal preference).  When chicken was done, I added a little chicken broth,  margarita mix and tequila along with the lime juice and a sprinkle of garlic powder.  Let simmer for an additional two minutes.  Yummy!!

We all thought it was way to salty.  Next time I will only use 1/4 tsp salt to match the pepper.  Other than that I would not change anything.

Great base to build around. Used a little bit of flour/maybe 1/8 cup and mixed the spices(chipotle chili powder in lieu of cayenne) in with it. Very thin layer around the chicken but came out awesome. I used fresh onions and garlic instead of the suggested powders. Onions were added towards the end with the garlic, not coated prior. I squeezed 3 limes, next time would use just 2 but it was really good.  Only used 2 breasts(1.25 lbs) but kept the spices the same if not added a little more. 

Will be making this again...oh and I did try the splash of tequila someone else had posted in their review...EXCELLENT! Might have sprinkled in too much but can peel it back a little next batch.  Thank You for sharing the recipe, best wishes to you.

The chicken was tasty and tender, but my family would prefer it less spicy. I will use less cayenne pepper next time. I also used chicken tenderloins instead of chicken breasts. The addition of lime juice was superb!

Yummy! I usually don't like chicken cooked on the stove top, but this dish was quite easy.  You must double the spices - not enough to coat one side. (I left out the cayenne for my tummy)  It could use some sauce - maybe some white wine sauce....

Delicious! I doubled it, which was a perfect amount for the 3 large chicken breasts I used. I also only used 1 teaspoon of garlic powder at the very end. Will make again!

DELICIOUS!! I made some modifications. I used chili powder rather than cayenne pepper (almost the same thing) I also made 5 pieces of chicken so I made more of the spice mix and made sure each piece was well seasoned. I squeezed one and a half limes over the chicken after it was cooked and deglazed the pan using some chicken broth (just poor it in the pan with the chicken in it and all). It helped make a sauce. As I let it simmer for a little bit, I added some fresh minced garlic and just a sprinkle (maybe 1/4 teaspoon) of garlic powder. Waited until the sauce thickened and ate it up! Was freaking amazing. I haven't seen my caveman of a husband eat that fast in a while! Served it with fire roasted corn (from a can) and some black beans! (And sliced avo and jals) AMAZING.

Great recipe!   I sprinkled a little Parmesan cheese on the chicken before serving.  It went well with cilantro/lime rice and broccoli, zuchini, and baby carrots  sauteed in butter, olive oil, and 1 clove garlic, sliced.

Everyone in my family LOVED this chicken!  That never happens. I made this exactly...with the exception of adding 1/2 cup of chicken stock.  I wanted more juice to drip on the chicken.  Fast, flavorful and loved by all.  Will be putting this in the rotation.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Both my daughter and I love this.  The second time we made this, we forgot the last lime step and liked it even better!  This is a keeper.  I just mixed up the spices for the next couple of batches to save on time during the week.

My family loved this dish which is important for families that eat chicken as a regular dish each week.  It takes a bit of time to prepare so I doubled the recipe to have leftovers for a family of 4.  It's just as good 1-2 days later as it is on the first night.  Thumbs up from a cook who works a full week but still needs to have flavorful easy to prepare meals to mix-up economical dishes.

Followed the recipie and it was very good. I like spicy so next time I will add a bit more cayenne.   I made a side dish of spanish rice and black beans and thought it paired great together. This is defiantly one worth saving and or savoring.

made as close as i could to the recipe but didn't have garlic powder so i used garlic salt, also added dried cilantro.  I quadrupled the spices and glad i did... i had 5 medium sized chicken breasts and flattened them a bit, and the spice amount was perfect.  I also only had realemon juice on hand so used it instead of lime juice, and also added 1/4 cup chicken broth at the end.  I didn't add any more garlic salt at the end, just the broth and lemon juice.  I can't believe my boys loved it, and they don't like ANYTHING.  It was a bit saltier than i would have liked but I'm sure it was due to the garlic salt (I didn't add add the salt called for in the recipe).  This was wonderful and will be added into my rotation!

Delicious! I doubled the spices (except for the salt), and added a splash of chicken stock to the sauce at the end.

I followed most of the other reviewer's suggestions and added chicken broth and extra lime juice.  I also used fresh garlic because I had it on hand.   It was very tasty and the hubsters loved it.

I followed the recipe pretty closely but listened to previous reviewers and doubled the spices except for the garlic powder. I threw in some fresh minced garlic at the end when I added the lime juice (I just squeezed two limes, didn't bother to measure the amount). This chicken is DELICIOUS. I kept eating pieces straight out of the skillet while it was finishing up cooking. I added in some black beans at the end to warm them up, and we had burritos with the chicken & beans, some rice, salsa, avocado, and sliced onion. This is going to be a new staple at our house!

Absolutely loved it! I used fresh garlic and didn't use as much but so good and very easy!  I let the rub sit on the chicken overnight in the fridge. Next time I will cut the chicken breasts in half. Excellent!

Delicious! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and doubled the spices. I used bone in chicken breasts which took forever to cook. If you have limited time ... use boneless. When the chicken was done, I removed from pan and added the lime juice, garlic powder and 1/2 cup chicken broth to pan drippings. The chicken was returned to the pan and cooked, per directions until done. My husband was skeptical because he is not a citrus lover. But he had seconds .... an excellent indicator of a good meal! I will make again.

I have made this twice now. For my personal taste, I go just a bit above each amount for the ingredients but the recipe on it's own is great! Very tasty. This is now in our regular rotation.

This is a very tasty recipe.The chicken was very juicy! The only changes  I made were, I took 2 larges chicken breasts and cut them in half  & at the end I  added  the garlic by pinches, (not the 3 Tablespoons the recipe calls for) Other than that  I stuck to the recipe. If  I would make four large chicken breasts I would double the seasonings. Even my (taste tester) husband  liked this recipe.  He liked the smell of the spices when I was mixing them together & he said the chicken was juicy, flavorful , not too spicy the way I like it.

I've been making this for several years, and it's still my son's favorite.  I just add the lime juice and everything together (I use lots of fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder), then coat the chicken and maybe even marinate for a few hours.   When the chicken is finished cooking in the pan, I remove it and make a small amount of gravy using chicken broth and water/cornstarch.  It's great with the drippings still in the pan!

Excellent!  I used powdered garlic in the mix but used 2 T minced garlic in the sauce.  I ended up adding a little bit of chx broth at the end as it was getting too dry.  My husband and I loved it.  I had large chx breasts so I tested them till they registered 165 and then took them out of the pan.  Really flavorful and moist.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Good basic recipe but can be much better. Double the amount of the spices and brine the chicken breasts for at least 2 hours before cooking. The meat will be much more tender and juicy after the brining. Good quick recipe with the changes I suggested. Serve with white rice cooked in beef consommé and broccolini , steamed, coated with a vinaigrette of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

LOVE! I added the lime at the end but skipped the 2 teaspoons of garlic. That seemed like way too much after the garlic already in there. Turned out great--will definitely be making again, but probably make a huge batch of the seasoning to keep on hand for future uses.

Family loved it! I sliced the chicken in strips, dusted in flour and seasoning (added 1 tsp of chilli powder). We then layered the chicken with salsa, sour cream, sauted onions and pepper strips, hot peppers and avocado in hard shells. It was a very nice alternative to ground beef tacos!

Followed recipe, hoping it wasn't too spicy, with the cayenne pepper.  It wasn't too hot at all, just a pleasantness addition with the fresh lime.  Served it with fresh buttered broccoli, and a rice dish (leftovers!) from several days ago. A pretty and new meal!  I also mixed up double of the spice mixture, sealed it in a small jar,  so next time I want this dish, it will be extra quick to make!

We loved this recipe.  I did change it a bit, however.  I made twice the spice for the large platter of chicken I was frying, and I used coconut oil instead of butter and olive oil  The subtle mix of coconut and lime was sublime.  I will make it exactly the same next time.  This recipe will go into the all-star line-up for our house.

Videos are awesome!  I suggest if you want only the recipe, go to "recipe" and for us who like videos, I believe they simplify the preparation if it is a new recipe to try.  Thanks!  Keep up the good work.

A simple recipe to make that was loved by the entire family.  I followed this recipe exactly as written.  While a little light on being spicy, the blend of spices coupled with the lime juice created a wonderful taste.  A new staple dinner recipe.

Simple to make, nicely flavored. I made it just about true to the recipe, help back on the heat a touch, personal preference. Chicken can out fairly tender and tasted of lime.

This was simply amazing! The combination of the spices just work and produce this delicious chicken that looks and tastes like those in 5 star restaurants.  I followed the recipe with a couple of modifications as per other readers' suggestions.  After rubbing the spices all over, I put them in a zip lock bag and let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours which absorbed the flavors even more.  After taking them out of the fridge  I let them rest on the counter while I prepared the side dishes.  I also used 2 large cloves of fresh garlic pressed instead of the garlic powder and added 1/2 cup of chicken stock to the pan. I had roasted a spaghetti squash for the side dish and after removing the chicken from the pan I tossed the squash in the wonderful glaze which added such flavor to the squash I could not stop eating it!  Thank you so much for this quick and tasty recipe.  I will make it again and again!

I can never understand the use of onion and garlic powder when the flavors are enhanced so much by using real minced garlic and real minced onion.    Those products are so 60's.   With those changes, Very good Chicken

Make sure you get the breast with the rib meat attached, makes for a juicier end result. This is a thicker cut, so after the first 3 -4 minutes, cover to retain moisture and promote more thourough cooking. Didn't have limes, used lemon instead. Also added anout 50% more butter than recipe called for. Also added Chili powder, threw in some lemon slices to cook in juices in pan, adding to the flavor of "spooning" juice. Last two minutes topped with more lemon slices. Came out awesome! Nice crust outside, flavorful and juicy!

Tasty.  I butterflied the chicken and doubled the spice mix.  Coated the chicken and squeezed the lime juice over the meat.  Baked at 350 for 20 min.

I loved this recipe. I doubled the spices and the butter and lime so the chicken was coated properly and there was enough sauce to cover the chicken.

My husband and I always add some extra cayenne for a bigger kick. We've also taken to making pasta to go along with it. The juices that you cook the chicken in make for an awesome, light pasta sauce. Shredded Parmesan cheese on top finishes it off perfectly!

This has become a go to recipe in our house.  I use boneless chicken breasts, so do not need to cook chicken as long.  I add 1/4 to 1/3 cup chicken broth to the recipe to make a nices sauce and then serve it over allrecipes Semi-Indulgent Easy Brown Rice.  Healthy and delicious.

I made it exactly like the recipe and got half way through it and didn't even have enough spice rub for the second side. I hurriedly mixed up some more for the second side which was a big pain and put me behind. The basting liquid was tasty. Wasn't impressed.

I would definitely cut the salt to 1/4 of a tsp. and increase other spices to make up the difference. Also, when you sprinkle it on, this recipe is for a light sprinkling. If you want more spice on your chicken, you might had to double the recipe. Unfortunately, the salt was way to much for my family and they don't want me to make this again, but with some tweeking, it could be really good!

Great and simple recipe. Definitely needs to double the seasoning in order to coat the chicken well. Added chicken stock at the end to give more of a sauce finish. Will use again.

we  loved this recipe...even my picky kids loved it. i made it 2 different ways...first i took the other reviewers advice and used chicken broth with the "sauce" and followed the recipe. then i just sauteed some from start to finish in the "sauce". i liked them both but felt the second way had a more savory flavor. definately a keeper ! thanks for sharing! :)

Very tasty! I didn't even need a condiment w my chicken (rare for me). I used one very large breast, as the spice mix doesn't make enough to cover 4, seared it well on both sides & then sliced it into medallions to finish cooking. Make sure you keep spooning the broth over the chicken to really infuse the flavor.

Delicious and easy chicken on the stovetop! So good. I used all of the same measurements for 2 breasts, and it turned out perfectly spiced for me. When the breasts were done cooking, I poured the remaining juice from the pan over the breasts while they sat. I will definitely make this again!

Five stars for how easy it is and how much my boyfriend loved it! I'm a vegetarian and this was my first time making chicken so I was quite nervous and thought that this recipe would be easy and hopefully tasty. I followed the recipe almost exactly (I did use fresh minced garlic rather than the powder and did add some broth with the juice as suggested in the reviews). My boyfriend took seconds and he had some for lunch the next day, so I think that's a sign of success! Thanks for sharing your recipe :)

Very good!  I didn't use the butter at all….just cooked the chicken in olive oil .  No need for that extra fat.  I added half of both the peppers and it had just the right spiciness.  My kids liked it a lot, too.  Very juicy!  I will make again!

Excellent flavor, super easy, I will definitely make it again. The whole family loved it! I do have to note that none of us found it to be spicy at all, so maybe kick it up a notch if that's what you're looking for.

This isn't the fanciest way to prep chicken, but it's a great way to make tasty chicken out of the spices you already have. Limes keep fairly well as well, so this is super practical. Consider increasing the amount of spice mix, mine was running thin.

Not my favorite.  The chicken was a little dry.  There was way to much lime and it over powered the recipe. The ingredients sounded good but this recipe just fell short for us.  I wont make it again.

It could have been user error, but using salted butter with the added salt in the recipe turned out to give it almost too much of a salty taste. Then the large amounts of garlic powder overpowered the other flavors. Next time I make it i'm going to be reducing the garlic powder and maybe using unsalted butter. The flavor overall was really good! I would definitely make it again

Excellent Cardiac Diabetic chicken recipe!  Use the Coconut oil, and fresh everything so much better...serve with fresh beets, fresh green beans, and wild rice.  Husband went back for seconds - definitely a sign that it is an awesome recipe.

I cut back on the salt and used Tequila instead of chicken broth because I didn't have broth and wanted a bit more liquid.

This was delicious! Didn't have onion powder, cayenne pepper, or paprika, so left those off. Also left out thyme. Had to make more of the rub, but I was cooking six chicken breasts, not four.  Guesstimated the amount of lime juice, (I just used the juice of an entire lime), and I sliced the chicken into strips partway through cooking to help them cook faster. I also doubled the amount of garlic powder in the rub, so didn't add any afterwards with the lime juice. Came out beautifully, received lots of compliments from family, and will definitely make again! Thanks! :-D

Except for one change, I followed the recipe. I substituted red pepper for cayenne pepper because I was out of the latter. If I were to make this dish again, I'd make additional sauce as it's a delicious topping for rice.  The recipe is easy, and the cooking time is spot exactly right.

I followed recommendations of others.  I used chicken tenderloins and pounded them.  I used 1/4 t.  of all spices.  I seared the chicken until browned; removed from skillet.  I added 2 minced garlic cloves (instead of garlic powder) and sauteed until golden.  Then I added  1/2 c. chicken broth and lime juice and returned the chicken to the skillet, simmering about 7 min.  My son declared that this was the best chicken I ever made!  Obviously, I'll make it again.

I am probably to blame for the less than satisfactory outcome of this dish. Instead of leaving the chicken breast whole, I cut it up before applying the spice mixture and cooking (I did this to speed the cooking process as I was in a hurry). BIG mistake. I found the spice mixture to be just overpowering and WAY too salty.

Delicious with just a little kick. However due to trying to multitask, I put the chicken in the oven with butter, lime juice, and a can of chicken broth rather than browning in a skillet. I left off the oil and the chicken was delicious. Unlike some, I had plenty of herb mix to coat 4 large chicken breasts.

This was tasty, with steamed vegetables for a side & on my salad the next day. I doubled the spices, added 1/2 tsp cilantro, & let it marinade in a Ziploc for the afternoon with the lime juice as others suggested. (I didn't add the additional garlic when cooking, it smelled like plenty, but I love garlic so I'm sure it would be great too.)

I used about half of the suggested salt, substituted cilantro for the parsley, added a few extra pinches of garlic and onion, and made sure to dump all of the extra spices into the pan when cooking! 

I also forgot to add the second round of ingredients (the extra onion powder and/or garlic powder) and it was still phenomenal.

I shredded it and used it for taco meat! Was absolutely delicious. The lime definitely makes a difference.

Spicy enough to taste, not spicy enough to make your senses cry!

Would definitely make again.

Made this tonight and hubs said: "Very Tasty!" We both enjoyed it very much.

Since this was my first attempt at this recipe, I followed the instructions to a T. Yes, all the garlic powder (we like garlic, and it was yummy.) And fresh squeezed lime juice. EVOO, unsalted butter. 

All the other spices. Perfect! I served it with steamed asparagus, and quinoa prepared with low fat/low salt chicken broth. 

Wow! Will most definitely make again.

Yummmmm!!! The whole family enjoyed this.  I did have to double the spice rub to coat all 4 of my chicken breasts. Also, I left the cayenne out of the rub and just sprinkled it on each breast according to each recipient's  taste.

I have made this several times now-and it is always perfect. The only thing I do a bit different is just use more of each season.  But I do that for all recipes because that's my preference. Fantastic IMO.

Loved it. Family loved it and the left overs are perfect for quick easy lunches.

I served mine over a bed of greens but fantastic on a bun or as a wrap with some crunchy romaine lettuce.  Already plan on making it again next week.

I made the spice rub as stated but found it only covered 2 breasts. I forgot about sprinkling the extra garlic when making the sauce and used the juice of one lime and about  1/4 c chicken broth with fresh herbs to deglaze the pan for the sauce. This tasted very good and I will make a larger batch of the spice to keep in hand. Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe!  It's become one of my regulars because it's easy and delicious.  I let the spices set for about 20 minutes before I start cooking the chicken.  I also took the advice of another commenter and add 1/4 cup chicken broth to create a pan sauce and I use minced garlic instead of garlic power (~ 2 tsp) for the step while the chicken is cooking.

Great recipe!  The kids LOVED it!  It looks lovely and tastes great.... The lime was a great counterpoint to the spice and was perfectly refreshing in this hot summer!!

This was great! Easy to make and very tasty. I added leftover tomato paste to the pan as the chicken cooked.

Need something good for dinner, but don't want to be in the kitchen all night? This is the perfect recipe. It's spicy enough to be good and garlicy enough to be great. Make sure to trim some of the fat off of the chicken breast or it won't absorb the flavor as well.

I made twice as much of the spice mix (didn't double the salt, cut out the garlic powder, as I don't like garlic powder). Pounded the chicken breasts down a bit. Browned the chicken in olive oil-butter mixture, then added 2/3 cup of chicken broth, and 3 large cloves of garlic, crushed. Cooked the chicken, then added the lime at the last minute. Served with rice. 

Delicious.

The spice mixture definitely needs to be doubled I also added more lime for extra lime flavor. Other than that it was delish.

I couldn't bring myself to add 2 tsp of garlic powder with the lime at the end, so I gave it a heavy dusting. Very quick to prepare and my spice rack is readily available so it was not inconvenient to me to create the spice mixture.  We used skinless, boneless thighs as that us what we had.  The flavor was good, but next time I will try additional cayenne for more kick, and go a little lighter on the lime juice, or maybe go with crushed garlic rather  than powder. Good recipe to tweak to suit your taste. Thank you for sharing!

Super easy to make on short notice. I added pickled jalapeños  and the brine from the jar with a little chicken stock to make the sauce spicier. We all loved it.

I was super excited to try this recipe, since I generally LOVE anything with lime in it, and the ratings were so high.  It was just so-so.  I really wouldn't make it again.  It had a tartness that for me was too overpowering.  My husband didn't care for it much, either.  Part of it is probably that you can only do so much with a boneless, skinless chicken breast.  But honestly, for me the seasoning was kind of off.

Halved it and used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. Baked rather than sauteed the chicken and broiled for the last couple of minutes. Added a splash of tequila which did not come out as good as I hoped - it smelled like tequila while cooking which made me kind of nauseous. So nix the tequila, the marinade is pretty good by itself.

I made this the other night, but needed to substitute the lime and cayenne pepper. I used red pepper and I used white wine and lemon. Still amazing! I will definitely repeat with lime or lemon!

Since I had all the ingredients I to try something new, I loved it!  I doubled the recipe for four breasts but I cut the cayenne and black pepper in half because I can't take the heat.  This came out so tasty!  My teenage son really enjoyed it as well and the left overs were just as delicious!

Great recipie. I usually end up doubling or tripling the recipie for 3 large chicken breasts. It's great as-is but I substitute chilli powder for cayenne pepper when I am making it for my son (18 months old) so it's not too spicy for him. it's still very good this way.

The whole family liked chicken prepared this way.  I pounded the pieces to a uniform thickness, and I placed the combined seasonings in an empty spice jar to sprinkle evenly over each piece.  I wonder how this would be with chili powder instead of cayenne, and Mexican oregano instead of thyme?  Think I'll try it like that, next time, because the cayenne adds heat, but not much flavor.  I chose not to use the extra garlic powder at the end.  I squeezed the lime over the chicken pieces, then covered and turned down the heat to low.  The pan juices were enough to coat the chicken, and we did were fine without a sauce.

I thought this was really good and so did my husband. I only made one change based on another review-I did not add the 2 teaspoons of garlic powder at the end. The lime juice added great flavor!

This was very good, will make again.  I used two chicken breasts cut lengthwise to make them thinner.  I double the spice mixture and it was just right to cover the four pieces of chicken.  Served with white rice with chopped carrots, red pepper and onion in it.

This recipe was great! It's was easy to make and I had just about everything in my pantry.  I served  it over whole  wheat pasta..( I did add some chicken stock ) .. Next time, I'll use fresh lime instead of concentrated lime juice... My family cleaned their plates, and even asked for more!

I was good, it was quick...just felt maybe a little less garlic would suffice.

I was just browsing, looking for something to do with the chicken breasts I had thawed for dinner. So glad I came across this recipe and gave it a try!  Loved the easy spice mix--will use it, as is, to season other recipes of chicken, too. The lime/garlic mix was just right and made a wonderful sauce. Thanks for this recipe!

My family LOVED this recipe! I followed the recipe except I sauteed fresh minced garlic prior to adding the chicken breasts to the pan.  I also doubled the recipe for 4 chicken breasts and barely had enough to cover all of them.  I would add a bit more cayenne pepper too because we like it spicy, but this recipe as is has a nice little kick. The juice of one lime was enough to offset too much spice.  I will definitely be making this recipe again!

I tried this last night while looking for healthy chicken recipes, and it was delicious ! I used a little less garlic at the end, but that was the only thing I did differently. I served this with yellow rice and refried pinto beans, and plan to try it again as fajitas with tomato, onion and bell pepper. Just absolutely delish. No other words for it. Don't use too much lime, even if you think it'll be better, the lime was JUST ENOUGH. (Unless you like eating limes.)

Me and my husband really enjoyed this recipe, I didn't have the cayenne pepper but it still tasted great! However I did use the amounts mentioned only for two chicken breasts so I assume for 4 won't be enough if you like your food well seasoned, its very easy to make ??

this was a great recipe.  I added cumin and more paprika.  It didn't make enough rub to cover my chicken.  I used chicken thigh instead of breast.  I also added a splash of tequila after cooking for a few minutes then removed the chicken, added another splash of tequila and a little water (a cup of broth would have worked nicely too) and let it reduce a little and served it over rice.  It was easy and tasty.  I will make again.

I made this tonight, only swapping garlic powder for minced garlic. I sliced my chicken breasts into thin fillets for faster cooking. Delicious, fast, easy. The lime shone through. My husband cleaned his plate and asked to me to make it again. I made it with the Potatoes & Peppers recipe from this site with a salad. Thanks for a keeper!

I made this mostly as directed. I sliced the chicken before coating and sauteed it to serve over pasta. I thought it was okay, but my daughters didn't like the flavor of lime with chicken.

This recipe was fantastic! Doubled the spice mixture to ensure there was enough to sprinkle on the chicken. Other than that, no modifications and it came out great!

Excellant flavor!  Try it on a good bakery bun with cheese, bacon, lettuce and tomato.  Got RAVE reviews from everyone.  Will defiantly make again.

Excellent but I did need to almost double spices used to rub on breast. That being said, it was super and my teenager even loved it, and he is hard to please.

Pretty good dish. I couldn't find any cayenne pepper when I went to the store so crushed red peppers. Came out good to me. I'll probably make this for my kids when it go see them.

Excellent seasonings! Loved the lime flavor on top of it all. Served it simply with a salad and tortillas on the side for anyone who wanted to make their own wraps. My family entire family enjoyed it, even the daughter who cringes at spicy food.

This is a keeper. I used chicken tenderloins and modified the spices to my liking. I added cilantro and fresh jalapeno, and served it in corn/flour combo tortillas with habanero jack cheese. It turned out great, and the leftovers were even better.

Fantastic chicken! I made it into a marinade and grilled it on the Weber instead of cooking it in a pan. I had to slice really thick chicken breasts in half, then 30 minutes in the marinade before grilling. It turned out flavorful and really moist, served it with rice pilaf and a salad. Thanks!

3 TBSP olive oil
6 TBSP key lime juice
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
1/2 tsp paprika
2.5 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp thyme
1 tsp dried parsley

I changes it up just a little bit by using fresh onions and garlic also a little red wine... I served it over noodles and with veggies that had cooked in the sauce for a minute. My  twenty month old boy loved it!

This was delicious, healthy and easy. Minor modifications...

1. brown the seasoned chicken on all sides. Remove from pan and set aside. 
2. Add 1/2 cup chopped onion and saute. Add a splash of dry white wine to deglaze pan. 
3. Then add 1/3 cup of chicken broth mixed with 1 tbsp corn starch or arrowroot starch to thicken the sauce. Add 2 tbsp. of lime juice at this point, reserving last tbsp. 
4. Return chicken to pan, lower heat and simmer until done. Add reserved lime juice to add at the end of cooking time. 

Other suggestions: you only need about a half tsp. of salt and a final sprinkle of the additional garlic powder. I decided not to add the last 2 tsp. garlic powder, and my dish had plenty of flavor.

Made this tonight...it's a KEEPER!  Instead of chicken breasts, I bought pre-sliced chicken breasts (on sale), which made for quick frying, and I also tripled the spice mixture, and doubled the sauce ingredients, also adding some low-sodium chicken broth.

I made it "as is" and enjoyed it so very much.  I did however, cook it in my microwave pressure cooker for 30 minutes.  That process forces the flavors, spices, herbs, through the meat and certainly enhances the eating pleasures.  I did add 1 cup of chicken broth because I needed a certain amount of liquid to properly pressure cook the breasts.  Next time, I will put the lime rind (from 2 limes), into the pressure cooker to magnify that flavor even more.  

Great recipe... C. Perez!  Thank you!

It was good, but like most, I modified it a little. I added about 3/4 C. of chicken broth and mixed it with a little corn starch.  That made for more sauce for the rice and it thickened it so that it had more body and stuck to the rice.

Quick, easy, and flavorful. Gave it 4 stars because I needed to increase the amount of spices by quite a bit as the measurements listed barely covered the chicken. I also added a bit of honey which helped to round out the flavor in my opinion. Not too much, but just enough to soften the kick from the cayenne pepper.

This really is simple and delicious.  I didn't have dried parsley, so I just use a small amount of tarragon.  Even my husband, affectionately know as HRH (His Royal Highness), thoroughly enjoyed it.  This will be cooked regularly in my house.

Great for a quick weeknight dinner.  Next time, I'll try with a bit of tequila to enrich the sauce.

I am having a very difficult time rating this dish. My husband HATED it (didn't eat more than two bites); however, I really liked the spices used with the chicken and the butter/oil frying method (I am actually adapting a chicken fettuccini alfredo recipe from this base). I don't know if it was the sauce coating the chicken or what. I am going to play around with this and adapt to my tastes. 

P.S. I would have rated 2 1/2 stars (as he hated and I liked)-- but I felt the easy in preparation should count for something!

Surprisingly great for chicken tacos! I thought it was great but it was a little spicy for my family's taste. It also goes well with cilantro brown rice. Love it!

I loved this recipe the flavor was amazing. I did have to double everything up though and also added a quarter of white wine. The juice was delicious and I poured it over my rice.

I gave it two stars because of the ease to fix. We just did not like the flavor. It wasn't for us. Very easy to make, very quick, which is what I was looking for. Unfortunately, it didn't work with our taste buds.

Two stars for taste in my book and three stars for the enjoyment that my little one and I had making this together and the great fraction lesson we had while she mixed together the herbs and spices.  I thought that the flavor of the dish was blah.  My granddaughter (a picky 9 year old) loved it--both the experience of cooking with Nana and eating a very bland dish.  My major complaint is that I had leftovers which my husband has been willing to eat as he will eat anything eventually.

I LOVED this chicken recipe!  I only used 2 chicken breasts but followed all other ingredients the same. The spice and flavors were amazing at this ratio! My whole house smells fantastic! I made a small 3 oz. Portion with a mixed greens salad and champagne vinegrette. Needless to say, I can't wait for lunch tomorrow!

I used chicken tenders with this recipe. It was very easy to make and I happened to have all the ingredients on hand.  Very flavorful!  I only used 1/2 of the garlic powder cooking the chicken and I didn't have any butter so used a little more olive oil.  I will definitely be making this recipe again!

Reliable, quick and easy.  Delicious and not too spicy even for kids, because the lime gives a kick without a bite.

YUM!  And soooo easy!  I skipped the cayenne and toasted Italian bread in the remains of the butter and such after I removed the chicken and ate this as a sandwich.  I also put on fresh salsa from the deli, shredded cheddar and sour cream.  This chicken can be eaten as is or dress it up. So good.  I also like extra lime. mmmmmm

I adjusted the recipe to reduce fat. I used all the same spice mix, but grilled the chicken butterflied on my grill pan. I had sprayed it with butter flavored Pam. It was excellent without a sauce.

This recipe always has a great flavor!  For my taste buds, there isn't enough "kick."  I have followed the measurements, (doubling, so it gets more seasoning per bite), and it is good.  Tonight, after I baked it, I'm going to shred it up for tacos/quesadillas/wraps or something.  Thanks for the recipe!

Ok so pretty good but definitely pound the chicken thin before cooking.  Also double the seasoning recipee and double the cayenne pepper quantity.  Took way longer to cook then recipee showed because chicken was to thick.

Just tried this tonight and it was delicious.  Moist, very flavorful.  I did double the spices to coat 6 chicken breasts and I did add 1/3 c chicken broth when I added the lime juice based on zadimom's review.  Company worthy!

This was my first time sautéing chicken on the stove top, as I don't cook often. I looked for a great recipe online and came across this one. My family, including my MIL all loved this chicken! I was so pleased. I followed the original poster's recipe exactly, because I was afraid it would be an awful disaster. The one exception is that I used 3 chicken breast scallopine (from Sprouts), and instead of 4 chicken breast halves. I also rubbed the chicken with the spice mixture. The end result --it was moist and delicious. My 9 y.o. daughter said it was a little too spicy for her but she liked the chicken a lot. First time I've ever used someone else's recipe and it came out lovely.

After looking at all of the reviews I made my own version of this recipe and I absolutely love it along with my family! Instead of using chicken breasts I chose cutlets and marinaded them with the exact spices above (but doubled) for 2-3 hours. Then I did everything else like the recipe said but because I was using cutlets, the cook time was reduced greatly. I did not use the broth like others suggest, and I will definently make this again! I especially love the spicyness of the dish because it kicked in later and it wasn't too hot.

The chicken comes out very juicy. If your not a fan of lime flavor you should cut down on the amount in the recipe. It leaves a very strong lime flavor.

Even though I accidently thawed chicken thighs instead of breasts this was yummy. I had planned to serve it over salad with margarita dressing but anyhow...a keeper.

This was very good but a little too salty.  I would use less salt, possibly a sprinkle over the chicken instead of adding it to the seasoning mix.  It also took longer to cook then indicated possibly because my chicken was a little thick.  I didn't have much liquid at the end so just added water, covered and simmered for about 10 more mins.

It was ok, nothing special.  If I made it again, I would add more spices as I couldn't taste them at all.  Only really got the flavour from the lime juice.

Was great - rave reviews! Substituted 1 1/2 tsp. seasoning salt for salt, black pepper, first garlic powder, and onion powder. Only had 1 tbsp. lime juice, so used 2 tbsp. of lemon juice. I was concerned about the 2 tsp. of garlic powder at the end overpowering everything, but no concerns now - it was fabulous.

I doubled the spice mix just to make sure I had enough.  Glad I did as I used about 1.5 times what was called for in the recipe.  I was nervous about adding too much lime and garlic at the end; wish I would have had more lime, but I was fine I held back on the garlic.  I also found for the cooking times required, you don't necessary need to pound them that thin...maybe just the thicker parts a little.  Also, a side note, I added leftover lime to the parmesan-basil orzo I made with it and it turned out pretty good.

Quick, easy, flavorful... I took one reviewers advice and added chicken stock but in the end I don't know that it was necessary, but it probably imparted more flavor. There were plenty of liquids left when it was finished that I went ahead and made a gravy and served it over the chicken. My family loved it.

Prepared this exactly as as written, unlike others.  Husband loved it - said "THIS is a keeper!".
As I am wont to do, I gave him the leftovers for today's lunch.  When he got home from work today, I asked him how it was, & his response was "It was even better than last night!  I wanted to give a bite to (co-worker) but decided I wanted it all for myself."
I guess I'll make extra next time.  LOL
Thanks for a terrific recipe!

Fabulous recipe. I made a pan gravy at the end. To do that, I added a couple Tbsp of flour and about a cup (give or take) of chicken stock. I added plenty of freshly ground black pepper and just a dash of garlic powder. I added a splash of milk a few times...total about a 1/4-1/2 cup. The gravy turned out awesome and was a nice touch to the chicken. The dish went FAST so I will have to double next time. Thanks for the recipe!

My family devoured this...and I even forgot to sprinkle the garlic powder at the end.  The lime flavor was strong at first, but I thought it was pretty good.  However, I love garlic powder, so I'm sure it would have been even better.  I had to make another batch of seasonging because it wasn't enough to cover the chicken.  And I had a hard time getting the chicken to brown with all the liquid in the pan...but maybe it had to do with the size of my pan.

This is real winner! So very easy to make. I did more than thyme. I used a mediterranean spice mix with about 4 herbs and it turned out fine. I served this with fresh vegetables on the side.

Excellent recipe. I used the spice blend as listed, 1 tsp garlic powder and the full amount of lime juice and oils.  I will cut the oil in half the next time I make it.

Loved this recipe. We used thinly cut chicken, and only had three pieces. I will add 1/3 cup chicken broth the next time. We tried it with tortillas, but I think the best choice is over rice.

Really like this. Modifications for next time: less salt and less butter in the pan. With pasta, added some chicken broth so there would be more of a sauce with it. Next time, I want to make this with a mango chutney topping/side.

The entire family enjoyed this recipe.  The spice added pizzaz to the recipe, but not so much that those who don't like spicy foods would dislike it.  I did cut the breasts into 3 or 4 pieces so that they would cook faster, or it would  have taken much more time than the recipe called for.

If one wanted to make a sauce for rice or pasta, chicken broth could be added, scraping up the bits from the pan.

The second time I made this, I grilled the chicken, brushing it with the butter/oil/lime mix as it cooked. Delicious!

This was okay as written for me, but I definitely think the spice mixture could be doubled next time. The lime juice was a little bit too overpowering for me as well, so next time I think I'll either cut that down or add some chicken broth to balance it out.

Everyone enjoyed it!  Including the 5 & 8 year olds.  Admittedly, I omitted the cayenne on my daughters because she doesn't like spicey food, but it was received just as well.

This is my go-to chicken recipe! It's also fantastic with pork chops. I often use a couple chopped up chili peppers instead of the cayenne, to increase the heat a little. Served up with some fresh steamed veggies, this is one of my favorite meals!

This chicken is tasty however it did require doubling the spices to achieve all the flavor. I didn't have the lime juice so used lemon juice but other than that followed the directions as written

I loved it and so did my family.  I cooked it in a dark roasting pan in the oven; however I did sear it slightly before placing it in the oven.  I'll definitely make this one again.

Easy and delicious. I used the amounts as written for 4 breasts although I only used 2.  However,  I sliced the chicken breasts to thin them out and there was more than enough to coat everything. As someone suggested, I served them with peppers and onions to make fajitas.

I've made this two times already and both times came out great! Couple changes - I had to cook my chicken longer, added lime at the very last minute, and used chicken broth for the sauce. DELISH!

I went a little healthier, skipped the butter, coated the chicken with all the dry ingredients mixed together, splashed the lemon juice on top and cooked the chicken on a George Foreman. Turned out great.

Pretty darned good. I omit the salt completely, and I think doubling the amount of spices would be essential for the rub. Of note, I only had 1/3 of the needed amount of lime juice and it made more of a lime/garlic spread that actually ensured a good garlicky taste without overwhelming citrus. I love lots of spice and this wasn't even close for me, so I think the entire family would enjoy.

Whole family loved this! Doubled the spices because it didn't look like enough. Also added chicken broth with the lemon juice per one reviewer's recommendation. Was even better the next day sliced on a salad. Will definitely make this again!

This recipe was very spicy and good! I took the advice of one of the users and used the fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. Also, at the end I sliced avocado and laid it on top of the chicken to help with the bite. It was an excellent pair in my opinion! Also, I grilled it instead of frying it. Turned out very yummy.

Very yummy.  As suggested, I used a meat mallet to flatten these before seasoning and cooking.  I did not use butter, (allergies and calories), and it was still very moist and flavorful.

This is a good dish.  It's easy and quick.  It was just too salty for me and even a little too salty for my boyfriend (who loves salt).  I would maybe cut the salt in half next time.  We will definitely be adding this into our dinner rotations though.

Excellent recipe! Tons of flavor plus I kicked up the spice a bit since I like hot dishes. Mine kinda turned into fajitas with some sour cream on side plus I toasted some flax wrap squares and added chicken on top of it on a bed of lettuce with sour cream on top......OMG killer! Don't do too much starch so served with broccoli and zucchini mix on side.  I really kept squirting on the lime juice and it insured the flavor! Will have again real soon! My wife loved it!

Good! I opted to brine my chicken breast a couple hours before I cooked it (soak in salt water mix -- 1/2 cup kosher salt to 1 quart of water; pat chicken breast dry before cooking) and skipped the salt in the seasoning. It turned out to be a bit on the salty side for the parts of the chicken that were thinner, but perfect for the center (not to mention tender and juicy!). I might reduce the salt in my next brine (1/4 cup), but otherwise would follow the recipe as is (eventually experimenting with using real onions and garlic though). Served over rice with some veggies yum yum :)

You can trust to leave this recipe as is, which is rare!  It's delicious. It's so nice to have a go to recipe that calls for everything you already have in your spice rack. The only thing I have to usually buy is the limes.

We loved this recipe! I doubled it for more servings, but I didn't double the salt. In fact, I would probably only use 1/2 t or less of salt next time. I also only had 1 T of butter left in the butter dish so I did a 1 to 2 ratio of butter to oil in the pan. I had so much chicken that I had to cook it in two batches, so when it was all cooked I poured the drippings back in the pan, set the chicken aside, and added the garlic powder and lime juice (from two whole limes) to the drippings for the sauce. Then poured the sauce over the chicken on a platter. Wow! Our friends went back for thirds! Absolutely delicious served with rice and veggies!

This was absolutely the taste I was looking for.  I made as directed except I omitted the 2 teaspoons of garlic at the end.  I served these as Baja tacos by placing the shredded chicken in soft corn shells and topping with pico di gallo  and lettuce. I  loved the taste of this chicken.  perfect balance of spices and so versatile.

What a great way to make chicken not boring! I've been trying to eat healthier, which at first meant a lot of boring chicken. My husband and I were getting bored with chicken so we gave this a try. We both love it, even my husband who highly prefers pork and beef. This is a great way for me to get a healthier meat into his diet! We never change a thing, it tastes great as is.

Spicy, zippy, yummy! I served this with black beans seasoned with fresh cilantro and a spring salad mix. The lime really makes this dish. Use fresh lime juice, if you can! I also recommend pounding the chicken breasts before cooking. Thank you for the recipe!

I LOVE this recipe!  My husband loves it too, which is even more incredible.  I follow everything exactly, except that I do not add the extra garlic powder at the end.  I felt like it would have been too much, and we love it without it anyway.  If I'm making more than about a half pound of chicken, I always make at least double the spice mixture.  I also might trying to use less butter when cooking it, as it tends to brown a little quicker with it, and it risks burning the edges of the chicken.

Excellent recipe...just make sure to double the spice mixture.  Also, the next time, I plan to use minced garlic in the sauce.

I gave this recipe five stars but made major modifications to suite my personal taste. I used fresh garlic, onion and parsley also added some fresh cilantro. Substituted cayanne for franks hot sauce. It has become a regular dish at my house. Despite the changes I made I think the origonal recipe would be good too if you didnt have fresh ingredients on hand.

good flavor but needs more sauce. Followed another review by adding chicken broth at the end with the lime. Next time I will double the broth and add 1/2 cup w/ 2Tbs butter and 2 Tbs Flour to thicken. Be careful not to overcook chicken.

I love this recipe but I did change it the second time I prepared it just on how I prepared it. I went ahead and mix up my spices and add 1 teaspoon of Season All Salt to it as well. I sliced my chicken breast up where they looked like more like stir fry slices instead of whole breast for faster cooking time.  Then I put the chicken with the spice and shake it up. I fixed the butter olive oil with fresh minced garlic kind of like scampi style. Then just before I pulled it I squeased on my lime juice. My family like it better the second time because they said the chicken was spiced more evenly. This now has became our go to chicken taco recipe. Thank you for share. Last night I tried even adding the splash of tequila as one member suggested by add it with Lime juice and it was great as well.

This is my new summer recipe. Very easy to make and delicious! I served it in the taco shell with lettuce on the bottom and squeezed lime juice on them. I did not change a thing. I didn't have a side dish so I made the All Recipe Spanish rice. Awesome! Thanks......

the only thing I would change is the amount of salt.  Granted I use very little salt, but this seemed too salty for me.  Otherwise the taste was delicious!

LOVED THIS DISH!  Decided to barbeque the chicken instead of frying it.  Only thing that I would change next time I make this dish is cutting back on the cayenne.  Family that I served it to tonight found it a little too spicy for them.

I made this a little bit differently and it came out amazing.

I skipped the cayenne pepper since my son doesn't like spicy - then I mixed all the ingredients together - make sure the butter is softened not melted. It will form a loose shmear.

Use chicken THIGHS instead of breasts (make sure you pound them to thin them out a bit) then spread the thighs with the shmear and place and grill. I used a stove top grill pan - it came out so amazing! The lime just gives it something special. Will definitely be adding to my frequently used book.

Very yummy!  Even picky kids liked it. I agree it needs double seasoning for best coverage. Served with risotto and green beans for a nice dinner.

I have made this twice and it has been a hit each time. Because my audience like heat, I add just a bit more cayenne in the spice rub, and more lime juice at the end. Sooo good there are never left overs.

Followed the recipe to a T. I was highly excellent. Even my picky chicken lovin' brother-in-law liked it and gave it a thumbs-up. Thought the recipe might be a bit caliente with the cayenne but it was spot on with just enough heat. The garlic and lime makes the whole recipe pop. Definitely recommended and would be good grilled as well.

Great cooking method, chicken was perfect.  Lime was a bit strong, and spices a bit faint.  Making again, I would double the spice mixture, and/or halve the lime juice.  I didn't use fresh lime juice though, so perhaps a fresh squeeze will mellow things out.

This chicken was so tender and juicy! Perfect blend of spices.  I used chicken tenderloins instead of chicken breast, it's easier to cut.  I also used chopped onions instead of onion powder, I used it to saute the chicken.  Amazing results!

I made this as is, and it was so bland for us for some reason. Not a winner at our house.

Delicious. I was using thicker chicken breast pieces, so I cooked them in the skillet to seal the flavors in and then moved to the oven to finish off cooking. I also cut the halves into smaller pieces.
It turned out so well!

This recipe was delicious the spices were right on the money,(did not use lime juice) I used only one large organic chicken breast pounded to 1/2 inch thick cut the seasoning in half and cooked to golden brown with 2 Tbsp olive oil and 1 Tbsp butter, Then set aside to rest and added 2 Tbsp butter 2 Tbsp flour about 1/4 cup chicken broth and reduced to a pan sauce seasoned sauce with RSS and put chicken back to blend. served over rice.

This recipe was perfect for 4 boneless chicken breasts.  The lime was a wonderful touch too! The times were even accurate.

OH. MY. GOODNESS!!! This was a keeper, for sure. My husband was late leaving the office, and he said he had skipped lunch and was starving. I had everything ready the minute he walked in the door. A very quick, very flavorful chicken dish. I prepared it exactly as written except for taking the suggestion of some other reviewers of doubling the spice mix except the salt, and adding chicken broth to deglaze the pan. I also pounded my chicken breasts. They came out so juicy, tender, and delicious. This was phenomenal! Next time I want to try the suggestions of using fresh garlic and onion instead of dry spices. Still, as written, this is one of the best quick dishes I have ever cooked. Served with yellow Spanish rice and black beans. Hubby said to make sure this one goes in the regular rotation.

Great recipe,I only made one change by adding 2 fresh minced garlic cloves instead of the powder at the end. Served with black bean and corn salad, delicious.

Turned out a bit spicier then my family prefers. I like 'hot' foods, so I thought it was great.
 I would cut back the cayenne next time.

Great recipe!  The minor changes that I did was to double the dry spices with the only exception being the salt.   I sautéed in a bit extra butter and added lime zest at the end.  Served this with saffron rice.  Will definitely make again as my family loved it!

This was quite nice and my whole family ate it happily. I substituted fresh garlic and onion instead of the powdered version and then fried the chicken off prior to cooking it in the oven for about 20 min on 180 C. Just prior to serving I squeezed lime juice over the sliced up chicken and served with a couple of salads. It was a lovely, light meal.

I like the recipe, but as I prefer fresh garlic and onions vs. powder. I sweated 1/2 onion & 2 cloves of garlic in the butter/olive oil mixture to infuse the flavors before using that to cook the chicken.  I deglazed the pan with the lime juice and a bit of white wine, and poured this over the onions & garlic.  I used this to baste the chicken for the last bit of cooking.  Totally Delicious!

This recipe was delicious. Instead of frying I brushed chicken with olive oil before sprinkling on the seasoning and then I cooked it on the George Foreman. The combination of spice and lime with wonderful.

Wow! This was the juiciest and most tender skillet made chicken we've ever had!  I think our family would add a little more kick to it, but it's awesome as written.  Will definitely have again.  Very nice flavor combination.

Very yummy! The lime was wonderful! I didn't have cayenne, so I added a bit of hot chili oil to the sauce. The sauce was a quite salty, so it paired great with my low seasoned risotto. Would also be wonderful with mashed potatoes. Used fresh garlic and onions, sautéed with the chicken. Will be making again!

This recipe was so easy and just so yummy. My wife raved over this chicken. I followed the recipe with the exception of the rub, as I doubled it and added one teaspoon of lime juice on each piece. I pan fried this with olive oil and put a lid on the pan. Just so juicy and tasty.

Just made this for my family, and they all loved it.  I made two batches, one with chicken, and one with flounder.  I didn't cook the fish as long, obviously.  I think the flounder may have turned out better than the chicken.  The only change I made was to cut the salt in half.  Great light recipe!

Made the chicken per the recipe, but then chopped it up and put in tacos and on top of nachos. It made for a delicious meal that we will make again soon!

I had all the ingredients on hand (except I skipped parsley) and this was a quick, easy, last-minute dinner! It came out moist and delicious; the hints of thyme are subtle but really tasty. Will absolutely make this again.

This was amazing. I did make this a little less spicy because I have little kids, but they loved it. I put all of the ingredients in a large ziplock, let it marinate for half an hour and then cooked it in a cast iron skillet with the butter and oil. I used fresh lime juice and garlic. Very moist and delicious!!

This recipe was great! My family loved it and it was very quick and easy to make. I left out the cayenne pepper so it would not be spicy. Deff will be making again. Served with the corn and black bean salad 2 recipe that was also a great.

I'm very much a beginner to cooking meals and this looked like a simple recipe that I could try and cook for my girlfriend and myself. It came out great and my gf hasn't stopped complimenting the meal. Next time I may add just a little more lime juice, but otherwise it was an easy meal to prepare with lots of taste!

Excellent, foolproof, chicken recipe. I found myself making this recipe so often I changed the serving size to 40 and reprinted it so I could keep a large batch of the spice mixture on hand. Having the spices already combined makes for a very fast and easy last minute dinner. I always butterfly and pound the chicken thin before adding the spices and I am very heavy handed with the rub, generously coating both sides of each piece of chicken. I serve this most often with spanish rice and sweet mexican corn cake.  Also good cut up and served wrapped in grilled totillas or on a bed of tortilla chips with salsa and melted cheese.  PERFECT with margaritas!  After three years of using AR and over 800 recipes saved, this is by far my picky eater husbands most requested recipe.  My husband even begs me to make it for company and it always receives good reviews even requests for the recipe.

This was excellent! It took only a matter of minutes to prep and cook. Very tender and juicy, but it can dry out quickly once cut. We had it on top of salads. I'll be making it again, I'm sure - probably many times.

Love this recipe.. chicken was delicious.  I had made 2 minor modifications just because I didn't stuff on hand but think it would have been great as written ... I didn't have cayenne pepper so I used chili powder instead.  I didn't have thyme and parsley so used italian seasoning to replace those.  chicken was juicy and flavorful.

My husband proclaimed best chicken I have made!  I did tweek the recipee just a bit to the following:  Whole legs - skin removed, rubbed the chicken with the spice rub and allowed to sit overnight in the fridge after browning really well I put the chicken and the juices in a baking dish and cooked in a 350 deg oven for 30 min.

I add more lime juice and about a cup to two cups of chicken broth to make extra 'sauce'. This is my favorite way to get in my frequent craving for hot and citrusy meals.  My family loves this chicken served over rice.

Wow! That was delicious! My hubby and I LOVED this recipe! I doubled the spices and cut the chicken breasts in half as many suggested.  I also added a shot of tequila with the lime juice. Mmmmmmmmmm!
**I just made this same recipe with salmon filets.  So good! I lessened the cooking time to 4 minutes per side and then cooked them for about another 4 minutes after adding the tequila and juice ( I used lemon juice this time b/c that's what I had on hand). I love this recipe!

Great recipe. As other reviews had suggested, I doubled the spice mixture (I also added a bit more cayenne pepper...I like my food extra spicy!). I also added a bit less lime juice than the recipe called for and I added some chicken broth at the end for the sauce. Still super tasty!

This recipe was perfect just the way it is.  I'm not the cook in our family but when my husband's away I've got to figure it out.  I followed this recipe word for word and it turned out really great.  The spice mix was perfect for 2 chicken breasts.  If I was going to make 4 breasts as the serving size suggests, I would double everything.

Very yummy! I doubled the recipe as my chicken breasts were very large. I could have laid off the spices about 1/4. Maybe mix up a full batch of spices but only put about 3/4 of the mixture on. I like spice but it was almost overkill. I did not use as much cayenne - just sprinkled a bit - to keep heat down. Nor did I sprinkle the extra garlic powder at the end - that would totally be overkill. Like another user I put 1/3 c chicken stock on with the lime juice at the end. then ladled sauce on chicken when plating. served with a homemade rice pilaf and the whole family was happy!

Good dish with a minor change. We placed olive oil on the chicken and sprinkled the seasoning on the chicken. We grilled the seasoned chicken on the bbq grill and then completed the dish in the mentioned saute. Turned out very tasty!

This chicken was really good! I mixed all the ingredients together (including butter, oil, and lemon), marinated it for about five hours and then cooked it on the stove without adding anything else directed. Great tasting and easy recipe!

Great recipe.  Instead of pan frying it I mixed all the spices (just upped the first amount of garlic to 1tsp and omitted the second part), the olive oil, and lime juice to use as a marinade.  Then I grilled the chicken.  It was very tasty.

I was sceptic about the cayenne and paprika, I thought it would be too spicy but it turned out perfect! Just the right amount of flavour and my bf (who is fussy) finished off my plate (even the little pieces)! Now that says a lot! I will definately be making it again (he practically drools looking at the picture I took)

My husband is very picky when it comes to chicken and my son chooses wisely himself; both LOVED this recipe. My husband said it is a "keeper" and my son had seconds! Loved it myself! I didn't have paprika on hand so I added a little extra cayenne pepper. Great eat!

A really easy and tasty way to spice up your chicken!  I just made this and followed the recipe adding the hints of other reviewers.  I used just two chicken breasts and pounded them to the same thickness.  Even using two breasts I had to double the spice mixture to cover both sides.  I also added 1/3 cup of chicken stock with the lime juice and basted the breasts for the last 5 minutes.  I served it with chicken rice and  drizzled the sauce over both.  It was fresh and spicy, I could really see adding it to a salad.  I will make again for sure!

I'm a beginner cook & just do it for fun. This recipe was really easy. I actually forgot to get the lime juice on my grocery list, but I read the comment about the chicken broth added at the end. What a great mix! This mix of spices is a great "staple" or "back up" plan when you want something good, but just aren't in the mood for serious cooking, etc. Thx for posting this recipe!  :)

This is a great receipt, but the measurements in the ingredients should be doubled if you use 4 breasts. Otherwise you will only have enough seasoning for one side of the chicken. Notice it says "generously"... But if you have high blood pressure, stick with this amount. I love my food spicy so I double the ingredients, and didn't use parsley or onion powder. I instead used a real cut up onion to fry it on top of... um um um!

Absolutely delicious. Hubby put it up there with our favorite restaurant's chicken dish.  Changes were 3 large breasts cut in half, less than 1 tsp of garlic powder at end (would increase next time), extra sprinkling of paprika at end (would increase initial amt to at least 1/2 tsp), 3 Tbsp of chicken broth added to lime juice for sauce.

Exceptionally easy and good!  I used boneless, skinless thighs instead of breasts because that's what I had on hand.  I probably quadrupled the recipe for the dry ingredients.  I also used about 5 limes (they were small) and served it with additional lime wedges and sliced avocado for those of us that love avocados.  My son and I both agreed that the coolness of the avocado really complemented the spiciness of the cayenne and black peppers.  I would definitely make again.  I served it with a red bean and rice mix and some prepared bean and cheese burritos topped with salsa.

My husband did not like this--he said the taste of lime was too strong and tangy.  The spices were good, but it definitely had a kick.  We would tweak it a bit to our taste, probably using less lime juice.

I thought this  recipe was not only delicious but super easy to make.  My chicken wasn't really that spicy though.  Maybe next time I'll add a little more cayenne and paprika.  I did add 1/3 cup of chicken broth along with the lime juice like some posters suggested but I don't think it needed that much liquid.  The 3 tablespoons of lime should work fine.  This one is on my favs list now!

I was surprised how easy this recipe was to make.  I was a little skeptical because their didn't seem to be a lot of the spice mixture so I rubbed it on both sides of the chicken.  It was so awesome!  The chicken came out so moist and packed with flavor!  I have made it twice already.  Thanks for sharing!!

Tasty! Once I cooked all the chicken, I added some cornstarch to the drippings to make a nice gravy sauce to put over it.

Absolutely LOVE this recipe. I make it about once a week for my fiance and myself. I do not use any butter though, just to make it a little healthier. And I add a little more cayenne than what the recipe calls for, only because my man loves spicy food! Serve with brown rice and sprinkle a little lime on it. Delish!

Made this with legs/thighs (skins on) and it was wonderful.  They did need  longer to cook but were excellent, skin was crispy and the tang from the lime made it special!  

This is a quick and easy dish - no effort!

This was great!  I cut back just a tad on the garlic powder but left everything else the same.  It's tangy, spicy, and garlicky--so don't make it if you don't like those elements!  Overall a good, easy recipe!

Very good taste.  I did have one problem at first.  I do not have a non stick pan yet, but heavy stainless steel.  I ended up adding the butter and oil and burnt it.  I took it immediately off the heat to let it cool, cleaned it up and used spray and it still seemed like the little booger was going to stick so I cooked it a bit on both sides to sear it, and added a little water, like 1/4 c or so, and the chicken turned out so moist.  Great flavor!  A little spicy cuz I rubbed it with a double batch of spices, but had it with rice and it countered the spices for those who don't like it hot.  Thank you so much for this recipe!  Next time I will make more and use leftovers on a salad.

Used a small, minced onion instead of onion powder and fresh garlic.  Also added half a minced green pepper.  Could definitely up the cayenne if you wanted it spicy, since we didn't notice any heat at all.  We cut 3 rather large chicken breasts into strips, mixed with seasonings, browned, then cooked with the lid on for 15 minutes before added additional garlic and the lime.  Yum.

This was excellent!  I did pretty much double the spices and added chicken broth as some suggested.  It came out tender and juicy with a little kick....very flavorful.  My 7 year old daughter even loved it and she's pretty picky.

So good and so easy! I've tried it several times and it's always a good meal. On a few occasions, I've also added fresh mushrooms and onion to the pan to make it extra flavorful.

This is a good solid recipe. Quick, easy, and tasty results. I'm giving it 4 stars because it's not mind-blowingly amazing, but definitely a keeper in my recipe rotation. I used some dried cilantro instead of thyme because I was out. I nearly doubled the cayenne pepper because we love spice in my house! I also used 1/2 lime, 1/2 lemon juice because I ran out of lime juice. I doubled the spices as suggested, because I cut up my chicken breasts (more surface area to cover = more spices needed). I also added some broth at the end to get the brown bits up and whisked in a little corn starch to make a sauce. It was quick, tasty and satisfying. Will make again.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was a HIT!!  I will definitely be making this again.  The only change I made was to cut the chicken breasts in thirds for smaller pieces.  
The chicken was very flavorful and juicy!

Excellent.  I cooked finely chopped and peppers in the butter and oil before adding the chicken.  I also added a teaspoon of honey at the end with the lime and garlic to give it a sweet and spicy effect.  Delicious!

Very good - perhaps a little heavy on the garlic, even though I love garlic. Quick and easy, and I always have all the ingredients on hand.

I had no idea that this would be SO AMAZING! It was such a nice mix of heat and flavor, and I loved the tart bite of the lime sauce drizzled on top. I served this with roasted broccoli, garlic, and cauliflower, and rosemary mashed potatoes. MMMMMM! This is a recipe that will impress, totally keeping it!

Makes a great sandwich - but use fresh garlic in the sauce rather than adding the garlic powder in... it burns.

I am 1000! This recipe is still delectible as stated 999 times. You would think the flavors would over power eachother but you can taste each individual one. 5 stars all the way.

Spicy Garlic Lime Chicken Haiku: "This was pretty good. I'd rather more spice, less lime. Otherwise, not bad!" I made this and found the lime to be too loud and the seasoning to be too quiet. When I make it again, I think I'd prefer to reduce the lime, increase the seasoning, and grill the chicken instead.

I enjoyed this a lot.  Per other reviews I doubled the spice mixture (and still barely had enough for 4 breasts) except for the salt.  Increased the cayenne and garlic powder a bit.  I also pounded the breasts to be a bit thinner.  I just sprinkled the breasts with a bit of garlic powder instead of using the full 2 teaspoons.  Added a few tablespoons of chicken broth to the sauce as well.
Good flavors and spice level, not a whole lot of lime taste.  Would definitely make again.

Awesome!  A couple of changes - I added all of the garlic to the rub mixture and increased the thyme & parsley to 1 Tbls each.  I also added about 1 Tsp of cayenne and left the onion powder out.  I seared the seasoned chicken in a dutch oven with just the olive oil and then I added the juice of two limes to finish cooking.  Added the butter right at the end to give a little body to the pan drippings and served over a creamy lime risotto.

Delicious chicken with a little kick.  My hubby and I both enjoyed the flavors used on this chicken.  My hubby is not a chicken fan, so the fact that he thought it was good goes to show how tasty this was.

This is my first review, and if I could give this more stars I would! My husband raved about the flavor. I used this to make pork fajitas with thinly sliced pork loin. The only thing I added was a teaspoon of grated lime zest to the dry ingredients, with I then used as a dry marinade-I put the sliced pork into a zipper bag with the dry ingredients,shook to distribute, and fridged it for 2 hours, then did a quick saute to brown. WOWWOWWOW!!! I'm going to do this for my dad-in-law's birthday picnic this summer with the chicken. FANTASTIC, C.Perez, thank you!!

I am a lazy cook (and I use the term 'cook' loosely as I typically burn rice) but this was not only an easy peasy recipe to follow but absolutely delicious! I wouldn't skimp on any of the ingredients because they all blend together perfectly. I definitely needed to add about a 1/4 cup chicken broth at the end for the sauce and it came out moist and tender. Used finely minced garlic instead of powder for the rub otherwise followed this recipe to the letter. Thank you for saving my dinners!!

Y.U.M. My three year old kept running back to ask for more after I made it. I used boneless skinless tenders and cut them smaller. Didn't have any thyme, and added a little shallot salt. Only used half a lime. This will be a regular now. Thank you!

The only thing I did differently was use real garlic and onion, and being too impatient to measure everything I just threw the ingredients in a pot. I added a little water now and then to keep everything from burning into the pan too. I can't even understand how something so simple turned into something so incredibly delicious! That never seems to happen when I make up my own ingredients to throw in the pot!

I loved this recipe!  I added a little less cayenne and I think I'll reduce it even more next time I make it.  It had a little too much heat for the kids - they wouldn't eat it.  I didn't add the extra garlic powder at the end, just because it seemed like too much.  The flavor is phenomenal though!  Recipe is definitely a keeper!

Delicious! I love spicy dishes so I used 1/3 of the cayenne pepper, garlic powder and black pepper. I've made this with chicken breast and chicken thighs as my husband likes dark meat.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Chicken was awesome!  I added some lime juice to the water for making rice- it was to much lime flavor.  Served with Rice and Green Beans.  My family wasn't fond of the sauce as an extra for dipping or to top the rice- but the sauce on the chicken was wonderful.

This was a pretty good chicken recipe. Easy to do for a weeknight. It wasn't the best flavor we've ever had, but it was good enough. I'll probablyy make it again.

We loved it!  Thank you. Only thing I will do differently next time is less salt-- but we don't eat much salt so it probably tasted more salty to us than most people.

This recipe is great! My boyfriend and I are fans of spicy foods so I added a little more cayenne pepper and some red pepper flakes and it was amazing. I made rice to go with it and added some lime juice to it while it was cooking. After it was done, I added some of the sauce from the chicken to it and it really gave the rice a nice flavor. I will be recommending this recipe!

This was FANTASTIC!! I am going to make enough of the dry seasoning to fill a spice shaker so I will have it on hand ready to go at any moment! Next time I'll try serving it with grilled pineapple and cherry tomatoes with rice or mashed potatoes. The sauce would be SO good on either of those! I added 1/3 of a cup of chicken stock to the drippings with the garlic powder and lime juice. I will double that next time so I have plenty of sauce. Thanks!

Wow, that was good.  I accidentally misread the recipe and added 1/4 teaspoon of paprika to the dry rub, which turned out fantastic anyway.  This recipe will definitely be repeated.

This was so good, so moist.  I didn't find it spicy but I did find it delicious!  I listened to the other reviews and only added 1/4 of the garlic at the end and that was enough.

This was very good and the whole family enjoyed it.  The chicken was a little dry but I might have overcooked it a little.  Great taste.

This recipe certainly was not bad, but it was actually a bit too lime-y for us! Perhaps go easy on the lime, then add some to taste.

Made this exactly as written only doubled because I had 9 thinly sliced chicken cutlets. I had some fresh cilantro on hand so I added about 2 tblsp. The chicken was a bit spicy like we enjoy it and juicy. You can add as much or as little cayenne and you like. Will definitely make again. Super fast and easy.

Great for college life! I had been looking for something with a lot of flavor that didn't have to marinate for hours (with classes and homework, etc, I kept forgetting to start making food until I was actually hungry). This definitely qualifies. I'd season a few extra breasts and freeze them for a pretty quick, tasty, homemade meal - especially useful during finals week. And since the frozen breasts were marinating for a while, they tasted even better!

Would have rated this a 5 star since the flavor was so good.  However, it wasn't spicy like the title states.  Pound the chicken flat for more flavor from the rub.

I fixed this and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  When I make again I will probably up the cayenne pepper.  I like things spicy and while flavorful I really didn't think it was spicy.

Great Easy dish. We like things spicy so I tripled all the spices except the salt and cut the chicken into strips to ensure cooking time was adequate. Also, like others, I added 1/4c chicken broth with 1/4c tequila and increased the lime juice. Served with a salad and couscous and you have a satisfying but easy meal. Thanks!

Tons of flavor! My husband normally sticks his nose up at chicken but loved this recipe. I didn't have onion powder so I diced up onions and put with the rub. I will definately do this again next time. I also added vegatable stock to the sauce instead of doubling the olive oil and butter like some suggested. This was an exellent recipe. I predict that this will be eaten often in our house.

This was one of the best chicken dishes I have ever had. I did have to double the spices for 4 breasts. Next time I will cut the salt in half though, it was a little salty for my family. It was very easy and quick to make!

Wow, this was good!  I used breast tenders instead of breast halves because I just seem to have bad luck with large pieces of chicken (they always turn out tough and/or flavorless).  I didn't change anything else, though.  Absolutely spectacular!  Excellent served with a black bean/corn/salsa side dish.

very good and spicy! I love spicy stuff, but next time will only use half the amount of cayenne called for, as I thought it was a tad too spicy. (I realize the word "spicy" is in the title) I only did one breast and doubled the spices because it didn't look like it was going to cover the entire breast and cooked it on medium and put a lid over it once it was browned to keep the meat moist. Next time I will use fresh garlic and pound the breast thin as a few other reviewers mentioned.

I made this tonight, along with Baja Stuffed Potatoes also on this site, for dinner.  It was a quick and easy recipe that did not need alot of babysitting while I was fixing the other recipe.  My husband and I really liked it although I felt it was a little salty - I used kosher salt, which made have made a difference so I will adjust for next time.  Great flavors though.  I also flattened the chicken breast and then split in two to make smaller portions that would cook up a little faster and go a little further.  Definitely a keeper!

Excellent flavor and SO easy and quick to make. Perfect for that last minute gourmet meal. It tastes very similar to the marinated chicken I buy at the Mexican market, I won't be doing that again! Thank you for the great recipe!

Really good.  We opted to cook it on the grill and then drizzle the sauce on right before eating it.  Everyone enjoyed this for dinner.

This was one of the very first recipes I made from this site, years ago. I never remembered to rate it. I make it about once a month, and I love the spice combination along with the lime juice. I like to serve it with mashed potatoes, because the creaminess of the potatoes makes up for the spiciness of the chicken.

Not very 'spicy', but it did have a nice flavor. I added 1/3 cup of chicken broth toward the end, to keep it from drying out, as suggested by other reviewers...Will make again. Thank you!

It was sooooo good!!  Thank you for the recipe and all reviewers' comments.  Mostly I followed recipe exactly except: I used only 1/4 tsp of salt and additional 1.5 TBS of Lime juice.  For next time, I will slice checken instead of pounding to have thinner ones, and instead of mixing all spices in a bowl, sprinkle the amount of each spice to each chicken evenly.  My hasband and I enjoyed this dish so much!

Loved this chicken as did my whole family including 3 teens who are always complaining "Chicken, again?"  They all went back for more.  Served this with tequilas, rice, and fresh tomato/avocado salad.  Only change I made was cutting the garlic powder at end in half.

Very good chicken! Spicy, but not too much. I didn't use thyme because I didn't have any, nor did I use onion powder because I don't like it. I doubled everything else because it didn't seem like enough. My boyfriend and I loved it and called it a keeper!

Several spices I didn't have, added my zucchini right into the chicken with a chopped tomato, so can't really rate this recipe, but do give it a '5' for the idea.

I took all the spices, the 3 tblsp of lime juice and a 1/4 cup of tequila, made a marinade and let the chicken sit in the marinade for an hour.  Then you can either cook in skillet or on the grill.  It was EXCELLENT this way!!!

I didnt have a few of the ingredients on hand so I substituted the cayenne peper for chili powder, and substituted the onion salt for a chopped onion that I sauteed with the butter and olive oil. It turned out really good. I would def make this again. I agree with others, I had to double the seasoning mix.

Very flavorful chicken! I made extra seasonings in a empty spice container for next time.  When I doubled the spice mix I just had enough for three large chicken breasts. I did not have fresh lime so I used fresh lemon instead. I added some chicken stock to make a sauce.

Excellent.  Even my husband loved it and if I had told him what was in it before hand (namely the lime juice) he never would have gone for it.  We loved how nice and crispy the outside gets when cooked in a skillet with the butter and lime juice.

Delicious with a couple changes that others suggested: I only sprinkled a little more garlic powder on in the last step - not the entire 2 teaspoons (it seemed excessive). The amount of spice was perfect otherwise. I also added a small amount of chicken broth when I put the lime juice in. My husband raved about this! Thanks for the great recipe.

I used fresh garlic and minced onion & rubbed all the spices on the chicken as directed. Then, I baked the chicken in the oven for 25 minutes at 350, then took it out and drizzled lime juice all over. Then, I returned it to the oven to continue cooking at 350 for about 8 minutes. It was great!

This was fabulous! I changed it a little. I used twice the seasonings except left out the parsley. I sliced the 4 chicken breasts like fajita meat, and used the seasoning as a rub. I pre-coooked an onion in butter that I had wedged then took it out and set it aside, then added the oil to the pan and cooked the meat. When it was almost finished I added one can of Rotel and a handful of fresh cilantro.  After that had cooked down (3 min. maybe) and the meat was done I added one tsp of garlic powder and 3 Tsp. lime juice and threw back in the onions. Served in a warm tortilla. Our foreign exchange student from Mexico said it looked like something his mother would serve. He loved it. Has a good kick without being too hot.

4 1/2 stars! The flavors were wonderful and my entire family loved it! Doesn't quite make a sauce though. There was too little liquid for it to even be a thin sauce. However, the chicken can definitely stand without it!

I'm usually not a person for "spicy" but this was a mild enough kick that it was very enjoyable! I added more lime juice with diced garlic to make more of a sauce. The chicken and sauce served over rice was delicious! Definitely something I will make again.

This was delicious. I didn't have any onion powder, but it tasted fine without it. I also used fresh parsley instead of dry because I had some on hand I needed to use up. My usually picky family ate it all!

My boyfriend and I made this tonight, and it was great! It's definitely on our "to make again" list. Neither of us are very experienced cooks.. It was very easy to make and we had fun doing it. I think next time we'll try a little less garlic and more pepper.

We loved this recipe! My 4 year old is the pickiest kid and he ate 1 chicken breast on his own. We tripled the spice mixture and added chicken broth to the sauce and it was perfect.

Very good and full of flavour, added a bit of chicken oxo to the butter/olive oil mixture and it was very tasty.  I also added fresh minced garlic to the butter and oil instead of adding more garlic powder. Next time I would use more lime juice and more garlic though.

This was a very good and quick dinner. It had great flavor. I served it with couscous. My fiance loved it. This dish will definately be added to our dinner rotation.
Update: I have started doubling the spice recipe except the salt. This is still one of our favorite week night meals.

this recipe is excellent.  The little tidbits that others have added below including the chicken broth were very helpful hints.  I prefer to use fresh herbs & garlic as opposed to the powders.  Pounding the chicken a bit thinner is also better.

Excellent!  I doubled the spice to give it a stronger, almost "blackened" taste.  Used lemon juice rather than lime. Fabulous, easy, ingredients all on hand and healthy! Thanks!

Very good! I threw my chicken on the grill after rubbing down with the spice mixture and just made the sauce separately. I did use significantly less lime juice and garlic powder, but the sauce had great flavor so I think that was a good move. Thanks! :)

I deviated a little from this recipe by adding all the spices to bread crumbs. I marinated the chicken in the butter, garlic powder and lime juice. Then I dipped it into the spiced bread crumbs to make a nice, spicy breaded chicken. It turned out really well and my husband and I both enjoyed it. Its not my favorite recipe of all time, but I plan on using it again.

Great with changes:  Mince together onion, garlic, and jalapeno and add to dry rub--with more cayenne than indicated.   Use bone-in/skin-on breasts and rub mixture under and on top of skin.  Broil to crisp skin (very important).  Sautee in heavy cast iron skillet in butter and olive oil until done.   Remove chicken.  Deglaze pan with lime juice.  Add garlic powder and pour over chicken.  These changes make this a five-star recipe.

I doubled the ingredients for the mix (minus the salt) and it tasted good. I think it would be great if I let it marinate for a few hours.

My husband and I generally only grill our chicken but now that's it's getting cold outside I wanted to find something that could compare. We loved it this recipe! We only made two chicken breasts (quite big) and I still made extra of the rub to use. It was the perfect amount of spice...will be making again!

This was really, really good. I made the recipe exactly as directed except that I used lemon juice instead of lime juice (I thought I had some lime juice in the fridge, but I was wrong). The spices made this really flavorful. I found that it took much longer to cook the chicken than the recipe had indicated, and by the time I got my chicken to the right temperature it had gotten a bit dry. If I make this again (and I plan to), I will probably pound the chicken to make it a bit thinner (and uniform in thickness) so that it cooks faster and hopefully doesn't dry out as much. The sauce was very good over rice.

I skipped the thyme and parsley,adn kept only the spicy ingredients. It didn't turn out too spicy, though. Great recipe, for a different taste of chicken. I served it with lemon risotto.

This is one of my favorites.  I serve it with a mango/cucumber salsa to balance the spicy and add color to the dish.

I added a bit of Tequila to the pan and was lighter with the garlic sprinkling at the end, like another poster suggested. I'm not sure if it was necessary, but the result was wonderful! I served with the campfire greenbean recipe (on this site) and cous cous.

This was EXCELLENT!!! (even thought I may have burned it just a little bit, somehow even the burned part was good) :) Next time I'll be sure to let the chicken cook on each side a little longer before I add the lime/garlic mixture. I think the garlic powder cooks very quickly. In spite of the slight burn, the chicken was still incredibly moist and a big hit. I served it with rice pilaf and corn. :)

Grilled the chicken, then cooked in skillet with doubled batch of sauce for 5 minutes. My husband said he couldn't think of a more delicious chicken dish! My kids, usually very picky, ate it up too.

Very good recipe, very enjoyable.  I made it into a marinade with 3 tbsp of orange juice as well.  I omitted the oil & butter.  Marinated for an hour and grilled on the BBQ. One of our fav's!

Yum!  A great way to spice up chicken, goes great with veggies. I have made it a handful of times already and just started to add the thyme since I did not have it on hand at first.  It is good with or without the thyme.

My fiance and I LOVED this recipe! I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!  I followed the recipe pretty close, only doubling the amount of seasonings and adding a little chicken broth per other reviews and WOW it was soo good! I chopped up the chicken and added it and the sauce from the pan to some pasta...Yum!

Fantastic as written. I also tried it, per another reviewer, mixing the seasonings and adding 1 Tbsp lime juice to make a paste and rubbed under the skin of bone in breasts and then grilled, also excellent. And, per another reviewer, made the Spicy Cilantro Dressing also from this site to go with the chicken - great! Thanks

excellent recipe! I would make more spice rub. the amount the recipe calls for was barely enough for 3 breasts.  Also, the butter-oil sauce dries up as the chicken cooks, so I would add more butter and oil as needed.

This was a really good recipe.  I made double the amount of chicken breasts, and didn't really measure out the spices.  All I know is that I doubled the spices for the first four, ran out and then made my own concoction.  I used fresh garlic, fresh onions as well as the powders.  I fried in butter for quite awhile and added some chicken broth too. I wasn't satisfied they were cooked so threw them into the oven at 350 for about 10 minutes.  Oh, and I put a lot of garlic powder on them before that.  They turned out perfectly and the flavor was great.  I served the chicken with some brown rice and corn on the cob and my husband raved about it.  This is a keeper.

I liked this I changed a little because we like real stuff.  I also cooked on the stove in a dutch oven.  I added ingredients changes were real garlic, parsley, two sweet chili peppers and scallions no butter.  All other ingredients I used.  So glad I did not juice a second lemon.  This was very good I will try again as a grilled chicken marinade.  I can imagine it would be five stars.

Great recipe. I have substituted chili powder for cayenne when I was out. It still turned out good. Prefer chicken thighs over breasts for this recipe. They don't dry out as much.

This was perfect, and we can't wait to make again.  Started the chicken in pan on stove, but DH was late coming home from work, so I put in 300 degree oven for 15 minutes and turned to "WARM" setting for another 15 minutes.  I thought it would be dried out, but chicken breasts were extremely juicy and flavorful.

I was in love with this recipe. M boyfriend and I were hungry for something spicy, and this did not disappoint in the least! It was not the spice that is typically expected, but I won't be able to say enough how perfect the blend was. My dad is on a diet, so I used just the rub on his and it was still really good! Thanks for a great combination of spices that we can use with pretty much anything!

My family loves this recipe.  We double the spices and I use thin chicken breasts so that they cook through.  We eat this by itself or we make chicken sandiches with a wheat bun, lettuce, tomato, and guac.  YuMMMMyyy!!

Now this is a dish with a nice tangy flavor. Loved the combination of spices, the only problem was I had to continuiously add spices as the chicken cooked because it never looked like enoguh. In the end the taste was perfect, however I did about tripple the seasoning mix ingredients, NOT THE LIME.

My husband loved this flavorful dish.  I doubled the spices as others had suggested and added a splash of tequila with the lime juice.  I added chicken broth and some flour to make more sauce and thicken it a bit then served it over orzo.  It will be fun to try some variations on this recipe (tacos, grilled).  Will make again.

I prepared this as stated and it was very flavorful.  No flavor was overpowering and they blended perfectly.  Despite frying the chicken, this is quite healthy and will become a regular in my rotation.

This was only okay for me.  I would make it again, but it's not something that I would crave or get excited.  I followed some reviews here and made it using tequila and used black bean salad as a side dish, which was a great combo.  I will probably be using the salad much more than this recipe.

This was good for a quick easy last minute meal.  Tasted like it needed something. I'll definitly make again, maybe I'll take someone elses advice and use cilantro.

This is one of the few recipes my husband has asked me to make time and again.  I usually use chicken breast tenders (or cut chicken breasts into smaller pieces) to maximize the seasoning to chicken ratio.  I coat them in the spices and pan fry (I just eyeball the necessary amount of butter and oil) and add the juice from one lime.  Easy, quick and can play around with the spices to make it to your liking.

FANTASTIC flavor!  Made the spice rub using 1/8 tsp of EACH ingredient (for just one large chicken breast).  I added an additional tblsp of butter at the end to make a sauce that I could serve over sweet potato/white potato hash browns. Did not feel it was necessary to add any additional garlic to the browned chicken.  Very mmmmm dinner.

One of our favorite chicken recipes! I use thighs instead of breasts and put the spice mixture both on the outside of the chicken and under the skin. Because of this I usually quadruple the spices and find I have just enough spice to generously coat six thighs.  I also wait and add the butter at the end so the chicken doesn't get overly brown during cooking.

I followed the recipe exactly (with the partial exception of pounding the breasts with a kitchen mallet) and it was to DIE FOR.  I served it over a bed of herb-flavored rice and topped it with a dollop of Hidden Valley Ranch Dip for a 'cool' flavor to go with the spice.  I can't wait to cook it again!

I defrosted my"chicken" , came home from work unwrapped the butcher paper to find it was the pork tendor loin I purchased the same day! So I used that in stead. I rolled the meat in the spices, and finished it off with the sauce (I added honey to make it stick to the meat). Good a liitle spicey for my 4 yr old nephew, but I just didn't give him the outer edge of the meat.

Wow! My family really liked this recipe a lot! My son's friend came in the kitchen and said "It smells like gourmet chicken!" I followed the recipe as written. I chopped up the chicken when it was done cooking and served it in small flour tortillas with chopped tomatoes, onion, cilantro and minced serrano peppers. It makes great soft chicken tacos! Thank you very much for submitting this recipe. YUM!

Instead of pan frying chicken breasts, I roasted a whole, butterflied chicken in the oven, reduced the butter to 1 tbsp, no olive oil, and added 1/4 cup of chicken drippings to make the sauce. I had enough to pour over the whole chicken, and it was SO DELICIOUS!

Great recipe.  I added a jalapeno and garlic clove.  I also substituted the onion powder for onions.  Spicy and delicious!  Chicken can be so boring, but this made me feel as though I had a fulfilling meal.

Big hit!  I cut up the chicken before cooking and served it over a  salad with tomatoes and green onion and a little shredded cheese.  Nice Mexican Salad.  Would be good in tacos as well or over rice.  My mistake was overspicing, I will remember a little goes a long way and it does not need to be covered.

This recipe has enough 5-star reviews but I feel like I need to add one more. The chicken came out great, extremely flavorful. I followed the recipe exactly except that instead of measuring the lime juice, I squeezed half a lime over the chicken. It tasted like enough, anything more would probably start tasting a bit sour.

Awesome!  So easy - I put the dry ingredients on the chicken and marinated overnight.  Also used some garlic powder and some minced garlic to give it more flavor.  I did double the butter and lime juice and this was excellent!  Very quick and great flavor - this is going on our short list of favorite recipes!

Excellent chicken recipe!  I did as the reviews said and I pounded the chicken breasts thin...I'm glad I did.  I don't think it would have been near as tasty if I didn't.  And, I wouldn't say this is spicy....it just has a tangy kick but not at all hot.  It's great!

Easy and delicious. DH thought is was a little too spicy but I enjoyed it. I used boneless skinless thighs since that is what I had on hand. Lightly browned in the pan and finished it off in the oven made it moist and tender. Would make again. Thanks for a healthy alternative for thighs.

YUM had a very nice kick to it!! Served w/ chicken flavored rice,veggies and rolls. I did add about half a shot of tequila when I added the lime. Also made a little gravy out of the juices. Next time I will cut the salt in half, a little too salty for hubby gotta watch his blood pressure:)

I thought it was just a bit above good. My family loved it and it was a nice spin compared to the typical chicken. There was a nice little kick with the pepper but a nice buttery flavor w/ lime and garlic in the sauce. I would make again except I realized tonight I may have an allergy to cayenne/paprika :(

This was okay.  I'm not sure why people rant and rave about this dish.  It seemed plain and a bit too sour for my taste.

I usually lean hard toward using fresh herbs, but I had to try this. I was quite pleasantly surprised. This is quite good the way it's written.

Excellent! I doubled the spices and added aleppo peppers for extra heat.  I served the chicken with a side of Archer Farms coconut ginger seasoned rice. This was a easy meal to prepare.

Delicious!  We used boneless skinless chicken breast.  The sauce was amazing.  My husband does not normally like just chicken breast unless it is in something like enchiladas but He loved this!

This was wonderful. I doubled the seasonings as some had suggested and it was a little more spicy than we normally like, but it was still great. I will definitely make again.

I made this for dinner using 2 leq quarters like someone else suggested. Also had to substitute lemon for lime since that's what I had. Loved it and so did my husband! Great addition to my menu. Will try with lime next time.

This is a good recipe.  I doubled the spices on the chicken and did not use parsley because I was out.  When the chicken was about done, I added broth to the pan so there was more sauce.  Family loved the chicken, very tender and flavorful.

This recipe was great!  I did have to double the spices as the original amount was not enough to sprinkle over the chicken.  There was not a lot of leftovers but what was leftover, I used for fajitas.  Delicious!

This is very flavorful!  I am giving it 5 stars, because I came home from work last night with no plan for dinner and was able to produce this lovely little dish from what I had in the pantry/freezer in less than 30 minutes.  That's a 5 star recipe for me!

This was great! Although, I did change it a bit.  I followed the directions except I baked it in the oven and when I made the sauce I omitted the butter (Healthier).  Also, I didn't have any cayenne pepper so I substituted chipotle pepper powder.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

This is a wonderful quick and easy chicken recipe full of lots of flavors. The only change I made to the recipe, since I didn't have neither, was to substitute the dried thyme and parsley for italian seasoning. Served with scalloped potatoes, it was a big hit in our house lastnite. I am happy to be adding it to my recipe collection. Thanks for sharing!

really good, and different! my husband and kids gobbled it up too! the only change i made was to omit the onion powder since i didn't have any, added a little extra water to the sauce to cut down the tartness of the lime juice just a bit. definitely a hit at my house, i'll make it again often.

Very good, but a little too greasy with the butter.  Next time I will probably only use 1 tbsp of butter.  As recommended, I added chicken broth to make the sauce and a little less garlic powder in the last step.  Also, had to double the spices to have enough for all the breasts.  Combo of flavors is great!  I will definitely make this again.

I liked the flavor, but I prefer more lime.  I think it might be better marinated and next time I'll use fresh garlic too.  I will try this again.  I also used leg quarters and I baked it, which made the meat very tender.  My 11 year old daughter went back for seconds, a big surprise!

I was skeptical about this recipe, but oh was it delicious! I didn't have any lime so I substituted lemon juice & it turned out wonderful. I served "Chicken-Flavored Rice Mix" from this site & Broccoli. Wonderful Meal!

Yum!  This was a big hit with our family.  especially since 2 of us (kids) are picky eaters.  I didn't have time to read the reviews of others so I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. I was looking for a chicken recipe on the stove and this was the Recipe of the Day so I went with it and am very pleased.

Wow - this was easy and so tasty! Its nice to have a recipe with ingredients I always have.
My only negative - seemed too salty. Next time, I'm cutting back on the salt.

This was a great recipe. My family loved it.  Perfect blend of spices and a great zesty flavor.  Followed the recipe, except the last 1 tsp. of garlic powder.  Next I will make more sauce as it was great over the rice and chicken.

Great flavor! I let the chicken sit overnight in the spice rub prior to sautéing it. I chopped up the remaining chicken breast and put it on a salad the next day. Delish!
Even my husband liked this and he normally doesn't like chicken.

This was very good. Before supper I told the other 4 family members to let me know what they thought after they'd ate so I would know if the recipe was a keeper or not. Everyone came back for more, even my picky eater & since there was only 6 breasts to start with & 5 eaters, several disappointed people didn't get seconds...will definately make again...probably at the end of the week:)

I loved this chicken! The only thing I changed was to use chicken tenders instead of breast because that's all I had on hand. It turned out great no leftovers. I will be putting this in my favorites. Thanks!!!!

I thought this chicken was AWESOME. I doubled the spices and made it with plain white rice and "Cream Corn Like No Other" from this website. I also made guacamole to dip the chicken in. Perfect.

This is an amazing recipe! Just be sure to double the spices and to use extra lime juice. Also, I add the leftover bits in the pan to some instant white rice for a tasty side dish.

My husband and I love this dish - great with rice and steamed veggies. The spices are tedious to prepare every time so I made a 32 serving batch of just the spices and dispense as needed. Huge time saver, removes the "fussy" from this tasty recipe. I think tenderizing the chicken to an even thickness made the biggest difference along with cooking at a slightly lower temperature. Previous higher temp attempts led to calling this dish Chicken Asphyxia - so much hot oil in the air we were choking and had to open all the windows. Even after an experience like that I still get requests :)

Awesome flavor!  I doubled the amount of spice and cut my chicken breasts into pieces.  Served with rice and corn on the side for myself and my husband.  Cut the chicken even smaller and mixed with the rice for my kids.  They loved it too!

Unbelievably amazing flavor.  Would be perfect for company.  If you but chicken in pieces, or buy chicken tenderloins, would be a great buffet item.  I think I will take to next Super Bowl party and am sure to win a prize.

This is excellent! Very flavorful. I tripled the sauce as the recipe didn't seem like enough for 4 breasts, and I added a little bit of chicken stock too. Next time I'm going to pound out the chicken for cooking time, too.

I also doubled the amount of spice rub. This chicken had great flavor and was moist when it was still a breast. I decided to shred it and make chicken tacos, like other viewers suggested, but the chicken dried up. It was still very good in a tortilla shell with sour cream, salsa, avacados, lettuce, and tomatoes. But overall, ill try making this again just as a breast with rice and veggies. Thanks!

Hmmmmm. Made this for dinner tonight. While my bf and I both liked it, we didn't LOVE it. It did smell great while sauteeing though.... I ended up purchasing a package of 3 lg. chicken breasts, but the amounts of spice and lime were for 4 (as called for). Served over Knorr brand garlic herb rice with Mexican Corn (by KBALDRIDGE) on the side. I think this might be good cubed into bite-sized pieces and served in soft corn tortillas with all the toppings, sort of like a lime chicken taco. Next time, I'll prepare that way (and maybe it'll get one more star for doing so...). Thanks for sharing!

One of my top 3 go-to dishes.  I've been making it for years in a million different ways. Serve it with rice, as a sandwich, or cut in strips and wrapped in a flour tortilla.

I only made two breasts and there still wasn't a lot of sauce. I did add the chicken stock to the pan to make more sauce. All in all pretty good. Especially easy to make for two with now leftovers.

My husband and I love this dish and never get tired of it.  I followed the advice of others and doubled the butter/olive oil.  Also, I usually use a little less than the called for lime juice.  3 T. was a little overpowering for us.  I also found that if you cook the lime juice mix. more than 5 minutes, you don't have much of a sauce.  So stick to the 5 minutes.  It's a great chicken dish!

A very tasty blend of spices and herbs. I opted for grilling the chicken on my indoor grill instead of frying it in the pan. I brushed the meat with the sauce frequently to keeping it from drying up. I served this dish with a side of cremini mushroom rice. Delicious! The only variation I would make next time, would be to add a little more cayenne pepper for an extra kick. Very simple and tasty chicken recipe, that is also healthy.

Yum Yum!!! This is some really good chicken! I pounded the breast before so they would not take too long to cook. My husband and kids all loved it and asked for seconds. I served it with black beans and a southwestern style salad.

Very good, but it wasn't saucy like I thought it would be and I may have cooked it too hot. The lime juice turned into more of a syrup. But the flavors were good.

My husband and four boys LOVED this!!! I used chicken legs b/c I didn't have the breast but it worked out great.  Definitely a keeper.

DELICIOUS!  Based on others' suggestions, I pounded the chicken breasts til they were about 1/4 - 1/2 inch thick.  I also doubled the butter and lime juice to have more sauce to baste the chicken as it was cooking.  The chicken came out very moist, tender, and flavorful.  Thanks for a quick and tasty recipe!

This recipe was pretty good, but if I were to make it again, I'd need to tweak it a bit.  The lime was way too overpowering for my tastebuds, so I'd definitely have to cut that back.

Pretty good - but not as much flavor as I would have liked.  I might try to marinate the chicken in the spice mix next time with some oil and see if the flavor spreads through the chicken more.

Used fresh garlic (about 1 tbsp) instead of garlic powder, and added 1 tbsp tequilla and about 1/4 tsp dried hot pepper along with the lime juice. After adding these liquids and cooking for about 5 mins, added 1/2 cup chicken broth and cooked for another 5 mins. With the broth, there was sauce to put on the rice and meat.

Simple and easy to make; it's a good weeknight recipe.

This chicken had great flavor! It was a snap to make and was great with rice. Didn't have a lot of sauce for the rice but the flavor of the chicken carried it through. Great recipe!

I followed the advice and doubled the seasonings, and I used ground ancho chili powder instead of cayenne.  I also added 3/4 cup of water with cornstarch and made a thicker gravy. My 6 year old said, "Mom, this is a do-again!"

This was very tasty. One change I'll make next time is to use less salt. I doubled the recipe and used the left over chicken on a salad the next day.

first time I made this is was very yummy, but it had no kick to it.  second time I doubled all the spices and it was definitely better.  I only use 2 chicken breast halves, I served this with Death by Garlic and it was a great combo.  Will keep making this dish, but this time with double the seasonings.

I loved this recipe.  I made it exactly how it was written and I can't think of anything I would adjust to make it better.  I was nervous about the amount of lime juice but it turned out wonderful.  It would be perfect for fajitas!

This was quite nummy!  I was worried it'd be too garlicky with the rub AND the extra garlic powder at the end but it turned out great!  I did make a couple changes just because of what was available - lemon juice instead of lime, basil instead of parsley.  Was very flavorful and SO quick and easy!  A great recipe for a last minute dinner.  Paired it up with asparagus and rotini with butter, lemon pepper and parm and we had a meal!

Very good chicken!  I wish that I had pounded the chicken thinner.  Next time I will make sure to do that and also add a smidge more lime.  My hubby and I would have preferred a stronger lime taste.  All in all, it was very, very good and we will be having this again soon.

This was very good! I made one or two quick changes  because of what I had on hand - I used the juice of one orange, one lemon and a splash of Rose's lime juice. It reminded me of a Caribbean version of Cajun blackened chicken. I'll definitely make this again.

This was mouthwateringly delicious. Not too spicy since the acid in the lime juice mellowed out the red pepper, and combined with the butter/oil mixture (I used low fat butter) it made a great "sauce" to spoon over the chicken once it was cooked. I served mine with brown rice and steamed carrots. Delicious and relatively lean!  Will totally make again.

wonderful! Loved this recipe. Satisfied my craving for Mexican flavor tonight. Added fat-free sour cream on the side and kind of mixed it up with the sauce from the butter and lime. OMG, so good! Had it with couscous and sauted veggies.

I am a very busy mom and make dinner the night before and I (my own fault) dried out the chicken, well can I tell you, that was the BEST cooking mistake I ever made! My 22 month only will only eat chicken mixed with sour cream, so I mixed everyone's with sour cream and it was incredible!!!!!!!!!!!! I also doubled butter and lime juice and we will definately make this again (and probably dry it out again, but on purpose this time).

This recipe was excellent! I didn't think there was enough lime and butter to really call it a sauce, but the chicken marinated in both long enough for it to still be yummy. Definitely double the spices and be careful not to over-salt.

Very flavorful chicken.  I followed the recipe exactly, but used only 2 large chicken breast halves and sliced them into 'tenderloins'.  I found the 'sauce' to be not so much a sauce, but more like a glaze.  In the end, I think we liked it a lot, but it wasn't *fabulous*.  It reminded me of a cross between the Roast Sticky Chicken recipe and the Greasy Chicken recipe, both on this site.

By far, my favorite recipe that I got from here.  It is very spicy (i like it like that) and I usually have this with some macaroni and cheese which sits in the sauce from it and tastes great!

I tried this because it had such high reviews but I just didn't care for it. The lime sauce was way to tart so i added some brown sugar but didn't help much. The chicken was way to spicy for me and I love spicy food. I think I didn't like this spicy because it was hot with no other good flavors. My BF didn't care for it either but he ate it because we had nothing else to eat.

I will definitely make this again. Little to no prep needed. I used chicken thighs instead and cut off the excess fat. Like many others, there wasn't enough sauce, so I just deglazed the pan with some wine, water, and thickened it with a little flour. Great recipe.

A quick and flavory recipe. I didn't have parsley so I added some basil. I served it with homemade mashed potatoes and a side of corn; really tasty.

I thought it turned out so-so. I liked it alright, but wasn't sure I'd make it again. Everyone else who tried it LOVED it, so I'm thinking I was just having an off day or something since outside of me the opinion was pretty unanimous. We'll definately try again since they liked it so much, and to give me another chance.

This was very tasty.  I had 6 chicken breasts, and doubled the spice mixture, and I felt like I could have used a little more of the spice mixture.  I also doubled the sauce ingredients, and it worked out very well.  I served it with the Quinoa and Black Beans recipe from this website, and some steamed veggies, and it was a delicious meal.  So healthy and good.  Thanks for posting!

We enjoyed this healthy chicken. Made recipe as is except omitted the paprika as I was out. The only reason I didn't give it 4 or five stars is b/c there really wasn't a sauce for me to coat the chicken in as recipe states. But still good and flavorful. Thanks for the recipe.

Tasty and easy too, both of which are important in my kitchen. I served it with cuban style rice and beans and a simple green salad. Hubby declared it a keeper after his first bite. Mods: I made it with lemon because I didn't have limes, and I didn't have onion powder so I used chives which I powdered in a mortar and pestle. I think I'll make it in a larger quantity and put it in a shaker so I can make it quick time.

The spice mix is great for seasoning poultry.  I skipped the butter though.  I just added 1/4 to 1/2 cup water to deglaze the pan, then let the water boil down until a sticky sauce forms.  Great flavor.  I use cold leftovers for salads.

Very good!!!  Used fresh garlic (a big heaping tablesoon) instead of powder in the sauce.  Used only 2 chicken breasts instead of four but kept spices and sauce amts as the recipe stated.  Still could've used a lil more butter/lime juice.  Will definitely make again.  I'm eating the leftovers cold out the fridge, would be awesome sliced on a salad.

Pretty good.  Spice mix is very similar to Emeril's Essence spice mix, which I use often.  I recommend squeezing extra lime over the top of the chicken before serving.  Served with rice made with chicken stock, onion, garlic and cilantro and a salad.

This was very tasty and easy to make.  We loved the little kick from the cayenne and the lime flavor.  Served with a vegetable and salad, this is an excellent low fat choice.  Thanks!

This chicken recipe has the potential to be quite flavorful but unfortunately, I found the salt and garlic powder to be way overpowering.  Overall, it was an alright recipe and likely something I will make again with a few adjustments.

(I actually just made it the second time without remembering that I had already rated and tried this recipe several years ago which alone speaks volume on the recipe's impact.  I gave it four stars initially but have changed it to three stars.  I've found way too many great concoctions in the last few years; this pales in comparison.)

My boyfriend loves this spicy chicken.  He is picky about "Southwestern" fare because he hates cilantro.  BUT, he loves lime and this is the perfect recipe for him.  I serve it with Lemongrass Ginger rice and steamed broccoli.  THANKS!

Not a fan. Followed other reviews and doubled spices and sauce. Way too spicy for me, and the sauce was just ok. Husband ate it, but wasn't crazy about it. I think its just not for our taste palette. Sorry.

I tried this but then added my own twist to try to emulate Applebee's Fiesta Lime Chicken...I did the recipe almost exactly, added tequilla with the lime, but then at the end de-glazed the pan with broth. Then topped the chicken with salsa-ranch and Cheddar and placed on a bed of crumbled chips and broiled...sooooooooooo good! The flavor of the chicken is what really made it! Next time I'll just try the chicken shredded into tacos, or over nachos! MMMM! This is my new favorite chicken!

They really need to have half star options. I debated.. Four.  Five.  Whatever - this is fabulous chicken.  Pound those breasts thin!  Double, if not TRIPLE, the spice mixture.  (I used Penzey's Pasta Sprinkle, in place of the thyme, and I never have Paprika on hand)  I did add 1/2 tbs of sugar, as my four year olds were supposed to eat this. Sauteed the chicken with red onion. Did add in some chicken broth into the oil/butter mix. And finally, added a tbs of Cuervo - which really came through and added a lot of depth. Husband ended up snaking the rest of my piece off my plate, while I went for another glass of wine. Will add this to the permanent recipe box!!

Excellent.  I didnt have Cayenne Pepper so i substituted with red pepper flakes.  Turned out just as yummy.  I didnt use the remainder as sauce as it wouldnt have been enough.  Other users said they added to it but I thought it was great without any sauce

This was okay...the "sauce" was barely there and it was a little too lime-y. I will try again with some of the suggestions here.

We used the spice mixture to rub on the chicken, sprinkled with lime juice, then roasted it in the oven for 2-3 hours with some veggies.  Delicious flavor!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was good! I accidentally put the garlic powder in with the rest of the seasonings, (I should have pre-read it first, shame on me!) - but it did not really over power like I was afraid of.. I made this with lemon garlic pasta and the flavors went well together. I also steamed some green & wax beans and served with iced tea.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a nice recipe. The chicken was tender and the lime gave it a nice kick. I omitted the cayenne pepper.

A nice simple recipe but a little too sour for my taste. I will try again and will add more spices and instead of lime juice use a liquid margareta mix instead.

I also doubled the lime juice and butter for more sauce! This went over very well at my dinner party along with the lemon drop recipe i got from this site! My husband and friends loved it. Also being 23 weeks pregnant and very picky i loved it as well!

This is such a simple and delicious recipe.  I rubbed the chicken breasts with the spice mixture 2 hours before I cooked them.  Other than that I did everything exact.  No flavor was over powering; everything just blended. This will be a regular in my house.

Absolutely the best finger lickin' good garlic lime chicken recipe! I add a little bit more lime juice to have more sauce, but that is the only thing that I would change!

We server this with rice and vegetables sauteed in the juices left over from the chicken. Excellent! Chicken had very good flavor with a slight 'kick' to it and very moist and tender.

Good flavorful chicken recipe.  I rubbbed chicken breasts with the spice mixture and then marinated in olive oil, butter and lime juice. Tossed them on the grill with some asparagus and served with couscous. Dinner went from grill to table in 15 minutes!

I really enjoyed it, BUT: There was wasn't enough seasoning, I really couldn't tatse it. I would recommend doubling it, and I personally added extra lime juice to my piece, but I like it limey. I'll make it again, only with chicken tendors(since they are not as thick). Cook it!

This was pretty good.  I cut my chicken up into slices - I always wait to the last minute to thaw, so they cook faster when cut smaller.  The only other thing I changed was that I added fresh broccoli to the skillet at the lime/garlic powder point, and it steamed in minutes - and got a lot of garlic lime flavor.  I also removed the chicken and broccoli from the skillet and briefly reduced some white cooking wine and added some salt, pepper and a smidge of cornstarch for a slightly thicker sauce.  The flavor was very good.  We served it over jasmine rice.

i would have to say this is just ok... the seasoning mixture was great I will definatly use it again... next time I am planning on rubbing the mixture on grilling the chicken and right before i take it off the grill pour some of the lime juice on it ! so that way there is not so much lime taste to it... it was over powering for me! My husband and brother thought it was Ok also....

I doubled the recipe and there was too much salt on the chicken for my taste...next time i'll add the salt onto each cutlet after the seasoning is already on each side.  Otherwise, it was quite good.  I used thin cutlets and you need to really watch the cooking time so they don't get dry.

This recipe was great! Very flavorful and has a really nice kick. Also this was very easy to make. I Had to double the amount of the spice mixture to fully cover the chicken, but the recipe was so easy it was no problem! I highly recommend this recipe if you need to cook something quick but want something tasty.

The family liked this, but they didn't rave about it. I liked the spice, it was really a pretty good balance of spice and tang from the lime. I might make this again and top salads with it.

This dish was incredibly good and flavorful! I actually made it with only 2 chicken breast halves, but kept the rest of the amounts the same because I wanted extra sauce to drizzle over brown rice. In fact, I wish there had been more sauce! I also served with roasted sweet potato wedges seasoned with brown sugar, chili powder, salt, and pepper. A+!

This recipe is fantastic! I have made this several times and it always turns out great.  I recommend doubling the spice mixture so you have a generous amount to use on the chicken. 
We love this chicken paired with the Lemon Horseradish Potatoes recipe - which adds an extra kick! Love it!

This was great! I added a little more lime juice, and didn't use the butter, and it came out perfect. Served it with broccoli and rice, which I also added lime juice to.  My husband and I both loved it and we'll definately make it again.

Tasty w/a little kick(I reduced the cayenne). Not sure what the lime juice contributes, I didn't taste it.

Definitely a make again recipe. Like another reviewer did, I too used fresh minced onion, garlic and deseeded chilli peppers instead of the powdered versions. Also, I sauteed minced garlic with the oil and butter before adding chicken. Really good. Thank you for sharing.

I made this for my husband and a visiting relative of his, and am giving it 5 stars even though I didn't have any because I'm a vegetarian, the two guys absolutely LOVED it.  My husband said it was some of the best chicken he's ever had.

Was expecting more due to all the reviews, but just tasted like regular seasoned chicken to me. I also found it a little salty.  Good flavor, but not very creative.

This was great.  I served it with my favorite rice and had a green salad on the side.  The men in my house all had it in extra large tortillas with rice.  I did however add 1t of chili powder and 1t of cumin.  I will make this over and over again.

Very easy to make, and  very tasty!  I doubled the rub mixture, and let the chicken breasts sit in the rub for a couple of hours before cooking them.  Otherwise, didn't change anything.  Try this one!

Pretty good, and fairly easy.  I'm glad I gave this recipe a second chance.  The first time I followed a lot of other reviewers advice and it turned out, well, icky.  This time I followed the recipe and it was good.  I used chili powder instead of cayenne because I have wee little ones.  I served it with black beans, corn and Mexican Rice III (from this site...I love this rice minus jalapenos). thanks for sharing this recipe.

I liked this chicken but I found it a tad bit too strong. Next time I'll tame it down a little as far as spices go. I did pound the chicken thin but that's about all I "changed".

This recipe is SO easy & very tasty!  If you like extra flavor & crunch on your chicken, double the rub recipe. Tastes great with vegetables that are cooked in the same sauce.

Spicy - yes.  I too grilled my chicken, using boneless, skinless thighs, and thought the overall taste was just OK.  Boyfriend LOVED it.  Will make again only I will see about changing the spice amounts more to my liking.  There was just something about this dish.....thanks for the recipe!

My oldest sister made this for my other sister and me. Since I'm a vegetarian, she used about 2 servings of macaroni pasta instead of the chicken. Wow! It was sooo good! It didn't turn out as great when I tried it, but it was still good. I'll be making a lot of this in the future. What a wonderful combination of spices. Thanks for the recipe!

Very flavorful! I usually just estimate when it comes to spices but there were so many that this time I pulled out the measuring spoons. Normally I need to cook food longer or shorter, but the times on this recipe were very accurate. Will definitely make again.

The flavor is very strong, but so good!  I followed the recipe exactly and served the chicken over white rice with Mexican-style veggies (corn/black bean). It was truly a wonderful twist to chicken and I'll make it often.  Just be careful not to overcook the chicken.

The smell alone got me!!  I just eyeballed everything and my breasts were almost too thick so the outside got blackened, but I liked it that way.  I used real garlic and sauteed garlic chips with the chicken.  Love the lime and used 2 whole limes.  I get so sick & tired of trying to find new chicken recipes and am thrilled with this because it is so flavorful.  They also tasted great in fajitas as my husband ate them!

This is really easy to fix and it looks just like the picture. Definately a five star chicken recipe. I didn't change or add anything and it was really good. The spices give it a unique flavor that both my wife and I really liked. Highly recomended. Thanks C. Perez for a great chicken recipe.

This was really good, even tho I had to substitute lemon juice for lime, and chili powder for cayenne.  I served it with rice but it would've been good with buttered noodles too.  Unfortunately, my 4 & 2 yr olds thought it was too spicy, but I'll make it again for the adults.

good recipe.  I had to kick up the spices a lot to make it spicy enough for my taste.  But I'd definately make it again.

This was tastier than I expected. We loved it. I left out the red pepper and just sprinkled it liberally on my husbands chicken breasts (Daughter and I can't eat spicy) Left proportions of spices the same for 3 breasts and used it all up. Great!

Excellent, easy and healthy. I used a cajun seasoning blend that I have in place of the individual spices, and used a little more than called for, but it was terrific. I used more olive oil and lime juice for the sauce so we had extra for steamed broccoli. Thank you!

Really excellent! Very easy and quick to make, but won't taste that way. I did up the spices the second go around (love garlic and spicy stuff!) but even made the way it calls, it should satisfy without being overwhelming.

I made this last night for my husband, who doesn't like spicy, but he loved this recipe.  I did take advice from others and doubled the rub mixture.  It was very easy and I did cut chicken into strips.  Served over brown rices with garlic asparagus.  Yummy!!

I made this a few weeks ago and before posting my review I looked at the posted reviews again. How ironic that Constance did the exact thing I did.  We like things very spicy and with lots of flavor, so I cut my chicken breasts in strips and doubled the seasoning.  It was wonderful. A great change from my usaual Tony Chachere's sprinkled on chicken. I am going to make a big batch of the seasoning mixture to keep on hand for quick seasoning. Thanks for the recipe.

Nice change from the ordinary. served it with couscous and black bean salad (also this site)as suggested by another reviewer. only changes I made was doubling the spice mixture(all but the salt) and using chicken tenders. couldn't be any easier and husband declared this one of his new favorites.

Definitely LOVE this recipe... I doubled the cayenne (I like my food spicier) and it was still not too hot for me. I think I could've made 3x the amount I did and it would have been eaten in one night... there's so many flavors, it's great.

This is a constant at our house.  The only change that I make is that I use half the amount of garlic powder and use the rest with garlic pepper.  Then at the end when you add the lime, I add another tbs of garlic pepper.  We love the little extra kick.

Yummy! I was quite proud of myself with this one. The kids wanted their chicken fried, so I dusted the chicken breast w/flour, dipped in egg beaters, then dipped and coated with the seasoning mixture, and fried in the olive oil/butter. I mixed up flour, chicken broth, and Rose's lime juice (shook up in tupperware bowl to make sure there weren't any clumps), then added to the pan, stirring up all the brown bits and added more chicken broth till it was the consistency I wanted (squeezed more lime in too). I then cooked the other two chicken breasts in the sauce, for my husband and I. Served with white rice (with the sauce poured on top ... YUM!!)

This chicken is SO fantastic. If you like spicy, you will LOVE this chicken. I have baked and fried it- both were great, I prefer frying it because the spices get cooked into the chicken better. But if you're looking for something a bit more healthy, bake it. Fantastic!

I've made this recipe for a few years now.  I don't measure the spices on the chicken.  I just use more and less of the spices I like.  The sauce at the end is great.  I do not put as much garlic powder at the end as the recipe calls for.

Flavor was ok, however this was so dry. I thinly sliced the chicken and browned in hot oil & butter. Lots of leftovers, I will find some sort of sauce to help choke the rest of it down, otherwise it goes to the cat.

I didn't use the cayenne as I don't like it but the rest of the herbs and spices made it a very tasty meal.

Great flavor. We grilled the chicken so we increased the spice amounts a bit. We also added some Tequila.

This recipe was Ok.  It tasted like something I made before with a little kick to it.  A little too herby for me.  I will try again with a little least thyme and parsely next time and little more of the other spice. Maybe a little more of the cayenne pepper and onion powder.

I thought this was pretty good.  Definately easy to make.  My chicken looked pink for a long time, so I overcooked it a little which made it slightly dry.  But other than that, I thought it was really good - I'll make this again.  Thanks!

Pretty good!  I didn't use quite as much lime juice as the recipe called for, and it had a nice spice to it without being too hot.  I'll be making this one again, since it was tasty, quick and easy to make.

I found that this chicken is quite tasty.  The one thing that I will need to work on is how to cook chicken without getting splashed by the butter and oil.

Low carb, low cal, easy  & delicious!!! What a winner. I automatically reduce any cayenne by 1/2.(I'm a wimp) But don't be afraid of the 2 t. garlic powder. I was, but used it all & I'm glad! This doesn't look like it would be such a great recipe, but it is. Thanks C. Perez!!!

Definitely double the spices for the marinade and either pound out the chicken, use thin sliced chicken, or cut the chicken into strips.  We love spicy food and this was delicious!  Next I will try making fajitas, as others have suggested, using this chicken.  Try making the Black Bean Couscous (from this site) as a side dish.

The meat eaters in my home would only rate this a three. They said it wasn't bad, but nothing to brag about. The spices really didn't come out, only the lime flavor. Maybe if the chicken sat for a while with the rub and marinated it would have brought all the spices out better.? I probably wouldn't make it again because it was only so/so rated in my house. I have much easier chicken recipes that give a higher rating that I will continue to make- and continue on my search for even better.

Easy, easy, easy.  And who would have thought that these simple ingredients would make such a tasty dish!  I make this now at least once a week.  My only other comment is that the amount of spices/oil/butter listed here is geared more for 3 chicken breasts, not 4.

Wow!! Absolutely wonderful! I was a bit apprehensive because I had never sauteed chicken before. It was far more tender than anything I have ever baked. I followed the recipe exactly, but halved the amount of cayenne pepper because we are whimps----just enough spice to have a kick but didn't make us cry! Even my 11-year-old loved it. This is going in my permanent rotation.

"Some of the best chicken I've had" said my son.  I cut chicken into strips and grilled them on my stovetop grill for fajitas.  Loved the lime juice and garlic seasoning afterwards.  I used fresh garlic and a little lime zest - YUM!  This is our standard fajita recipe now!

This was so quick and tasted great!  I sliced the chicken breats and made chicken fingers.  Also, I didn't have onion powder or cayenne pepper, so I just sprinkled the chicken with cajun spices.  I will definitely make this again.

This was just okay. I didn't care too much for the combination of spices. But the lime aspect of the recipe was good. Served with rice.

I only used 3 breasts (they were on the large side), cut into strips and I thought that there was just barely enough of the spice mix. Since DH said "you can make these any time you want", the next time I'll make a bunch of the spice mix!!!!!

This was excellent - doesn't dry out and has just a little kick, to make it interesting.  I've been making this for lunch - Healthy!  My husband likes in as a sandwich.

Excellent dish.  Very easy to make.  I prepared it exactly as directed and it's a definate keeper.  I served it with brown jasmine rice and green beans.  Both my husband (who's not a big fan of chicken) and our 2 year old son loved it.

Fantastic dish--even reheated, it won raves.  I didn't have the cayenne pepper but added two dashes of chili powder.  Turned out great.  Thanks so much!

Fantastic!  I usually double the amount of spices called for to give it a bit more kick!

Not sure what all the fuss in about on this one.  It was pretty good, but nothing to add to your "wow" list.

I really enjoyed this recipe, though my husband found it had too much lime, which is easily adjustable.  It was really quick and easy, which is most important.
