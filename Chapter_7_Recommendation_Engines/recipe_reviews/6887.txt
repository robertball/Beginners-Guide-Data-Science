A great way to use up bread that's past its prime! I like to use a lower oven temp so that the bread is crisp and dry all the way through before it starts to get too brown.

I've been making these for years, and my kids looooove them.  
Using french or italian bread, a garlic-salt mixture with parsley in it, and a butter-flavored cooking spray (rather than the butter) gives them a top-level restaurant taste. I also like to use ranch-dressing dry mix in lieu of the garlic salt at times--you can also use garlic powder with salted cheddar popcorn topping--the possibilities are endless!----One of my kids' fave all-time snacks are actually borne of the "crouton" premise: Called "Crustinos", you make them by slicing basic french or italian bread into approx. 1/2 inch thick slices, then spraying the slices with butter-flavored cooking spray, adding your seasoning atop, and baking at 200 degrees until they are light golden and crispy.  So much better for everyone than chips--and they keep for a week or more in a sealed bag (although I cannot keep any in my house more than 24 hours--the kids eat them up fast).  When you have a salad or soup,(or even need bread crumbs for a coating) take a few and break them up. Quick, easy, and a great way to use up extra leftover bread.

These were better than restaurant style croutons!!  The only changes I made was I cut the bread into cubes first, than put them in a container with the melted butter, than I added garlic and onion salt, put the lid on and shook it all up, then dumped it on to a baking sheet.  There were great!!  Even my husband and 4 year old couldn't get enough!

I used Pam Butter spray on one batch and Pam garlic spray on another - then seasonings of my choice.  The spray cuts down on the calories and keeps them crispy!

Instead of buttering the bread directly, I poured melted butter over the sliced bread and mixed it well.  It worked out great.  Didn't take a lot of time.

I'm glad to see other people make their own croutons! They are so easy and quick to make and are great to jazz up a salad. I toss cubes of bread in olive oil and freshly crushed garlic and sprinkle with a little grated parmesan before cooking ... yum!

Easy recipe for garlic croutons. I 
used day-old bread, which made even
crispier croutons. Used them in a casserole and it worked out great for me. EDITED: You can make this to suit any kind of salad or recipe you need it for. I like to use homemade seasoning mixes to season these croutons, anything from italian seasoning to cajun seasoning. If you cool them and throw them in your food processor and grind them down, you instantly have homemade breadcrumbs that are excellent in meat loaf or meat balls!

needs more spices!   I use a loaf of French or Italian bread, cut off the crusts and cube.  I toss the cubes with 3/4 cup of olive oil & lots of spices: garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, Italianing seasoning, Mrs.Dash, Nature's Seasoning, etc.  Spead on baking sheet & Bake at 425 for 10-12 minutes (watch! don't let them burn!)

Great recipe...only thing that I do differently when I make this is to add some garlic to it.  It is great to take a whole clove and rub it on the bread when it comes out of the oven.  The hot bread just melts the garlic clove and it is delicious.  Thanks for a recipe that helps with that stale, left-over bread.

Faced with the prospect of tossing a loaf of whole wheat bread I'd not used, I decided to give homemade croutons a try. And they are very, very good!

I trimmed the crusts from the loaf and cut into pieces approx. 1 square inch. I then melted Land O'Lakes light butter with several cracked cloves of garlic (substituted for the garlic salt) and tossed with the bread in a large plastic bag. 

I spread in a single layer and toasted at 300 degrees for 10 minutes on each side. I then turned the oven off and left the pan in for an hour or so. This might have been overly conservative, but I tend to burn things so I opted for the lower temp and longer cooking time.

The flavor is good and the texture is perfectly crunchy without even a hint of too-dark toasty spots.

This recipe was a great find.  The croutons are just like the "homemade" ones in fancy restaurants, except you can season them to your own taste.  It's a definite keeper!

This is really good, but even better IMHO with a few changes.  I cube the bread first and put it all into a big mixing bowl.  Then I melt the butter in the microwave and stir in the garlic salt - I also add 1 tsp of crushed Italian seasoning to this mixture.  I find that mixing the butter with the seasonings first helps it go on more evenly.  Then drizzle over the bread cubes and toss until evenly coated.  Spread on the pan and bake as directed, stirring occasionally.  These are so yummy I can hardy keep myself from just snacking on them fresh out of the oven.  P.S.  if you crush the croutons later, they make a DELICIOUS breadcrumb coating for chicken etc.!!!

Very good! I used spray butter and sprayed and seasoned before I cut the bread up (used a ulu knife which made it very easy to slice!). Lowered temp to 325. Excellent, enjoyed on a salad. Thanks!

I couldn't find any store bought croutons without phosphates so I wanted to try making my own.  SO EASY!!!  I did like another reviewer said and melted butter in the bowl, sprinkled a little garlic salt in there, then tossed in the bread cubes and shook them up with the lid on.  GREAT!!  I didn't cut off the crusts.  I used leftover bread heels as well.

I made several finger sandwiches for a function & cut off the crust. Usually, I throw them away, but ended up with a lot of waste once I added in all the end crusts. So, I decided to try making these, instead. Turned our absolutely fantastic! My husband pronounced them a keeper, so don't think I will throw anymore crusts away! I ended up baking them at 350 for 25 minutes, then turned off the heat & left them in the oven for another 10 min. They were baked in a pan with 1-1/2" sides.

Right now (November) bags of bread bits are sold for less than $2 at your local grocery store. They are sold as stuffing bread but I used one of those bags to make croutons. The bread is already cut up, it's really cheap, and makes a lot of croutons.

Used a whole french baguette for this recipe. I used half for croutons and the smashed up the other half for seasoned bread crumbs. Stored in ziplock bags. This was eassy! Thanks!

I would say that this is a great recipe. What a way to use what would be tossed away. I did change a few things as suggested by other members. I kept the crust on, increased the butter to little less than half a cup, added garlic salt and oregano to the melted butter. I placed the bread into the butter and mixed it together that way. I lowered the heat to 315 for about 25 minutes or so stir occasionally. My 8 year old loves them!

Cost savings all around...what a great way to use up old bread!  I combined melted butter, olive oil, garlic salt, parsley flakes, and parmesan cheese in a sealed container, added bread and shook until coated.  I will never be buying in a box again, or even crackers - I much prefer these in my soup!  Next time I'm going to cut my bread into 1" cubes and use in french onion soup, I bet it'll be a lot easier to eat then trying to saw through soggy french stick with a spoon!

Yummy yummy yummy yummy!  My bread wasn't quite stale, but it still worked wonderfully!  After brushing with the melted butter and cubing, I tossed them with oregano, garlic powder, and parmesan cheese.  I could eat these as a snack!  Thanks for the easy great recipe!

Great basic recipe.  I toss the buttered bread cubes with a couple teaspoons Poultry Seasoning and bake them up for a wonderful stuffing base.

Yummy - I cubed the bread (didn't measure) and put in a bowl.  I used a combination of melted butter, melted bacon fryings and olive oil.  Then added to the melted mixture dried parsley, fresh garlic, cracked pepper and parmasen cheese.  Poured over the cubes and shook the bowl to well coat.  Baked at 325 degrees for 30 minutes stirring every 10 minutes.  I do believe my husband will have them gone before I can use them on a salad!  Will make these again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

These are so yummy I can just eat them out of the bag! I used garlic powder rather than garlic salt and mixed that into the butter. I toasted the bread cubes first, then tossed them with the butter mixture (as another recipe advised) which worked out very very well. If you have more or less slices of bread, I figured on about 1 tablespoon of butter per cup of toasted cubes.

I used a combo of butter and evoo which I heated and added garlic and onion powders and lots of herbs and spices. I normally fry my croutons but this was so much easier, not to mention healthful. Went beautifully with our Halloween pea soup last night. Thank you Carol.

I used about 7/8 pieces of stale wheat bread.  Cut off the crusts first and then I cut the bread into squares.  Then I dumped the pieces into a bowl and poured melted butter over it.  Tossed it until it was well coated.  Set the bread onto a cookie sheet and then sprinkled three packets of parmesan/romano blend cheese powder from the local pizza place on top of it.  I also sprinkled a good helping of garlic powder onto the bread as well.  Cooked them longer than I needed to because I love croutons crispy and a tad burnt.  They tasted amazing, the best I've ever had (and I'm a huge crouton fan).

I like this recipe.  A great tip is to use a pizza cutter for things like this.  Actually,  pizza cutters are great for kids to cut up their own food. I used texas toast, butter, onion and garlic powdre, salt and italilian seasoning. Delish !

I've been making these for years! They are great when you don't want your bread to waste, but it's not quite sandwich material. I just use a soft spreadable butter, like country crock, and then I form mine into balls so they are a bit chewy in the middle. That's just me though! Love them either way!

Great basic recipe and very easy. I used very dense bakery wheat bread cut up into cubes with crust and placed in large bowl.  I melted 1/2 cup butter, poured over bread crumbs and tossed.  I also added Kirkland's (Costco) Rustic Tuscany Seasoning to taste.  Baked as recipe said and....yummy!

great croutons!! way better than store bought!  i only made a few small changes: melted the butter, added italian spices (maybe 1 tsp?) and garlic salt (about 3/4 tsp) to the butter, then tossed with the bread cubes. it didn't look like enough butter/spices, so i melted an additional 1/8 cup of butter and added more spices & salt. tossed again. then arranged as evenly as possible on a GREASED cookie sheet, cooked at 235 for 30 min, then let them stay in the warm oven for 10 more minutes. they are so crunchy, but not at all hard, if that makes sense... my husband and kids LOVED these, will be making again!

Very nice! Used Rye bread as I was putting them in a Russian Green Bean and Potato Soup (on this site). Sprinkled with a little garlic powder and sage.Used a storage bag, put the cubes in and poured the melted margarine in. Shook the bag and dumped them onto the cookie sheet.

I love to cook, but hate the clean up part of cooking, so I cut the bread up (I used the crust part, too), put it in a gallon zip-loc bag, in a glass measuring cup I melted the butter, garlic salt and I added a heaping tablespoon of pesto, in the microwave then poured it over the bread in the bag, 'zipped' it shut and tossed it until all the pieces were coated.  Be sure to add some air to the bag, helps the bread to coat better. Then I lined a pan with foil, baked for 15 min. at 350, and they are AWESOME....love the pesto flavor.  (I used less bread, as I only had 1/2 loaf left from the night before.  For more bread I would double the recipe, that way all the pieces get lots of flavor).

I was just gifted a loaf of artisan sourdough bread and knew we would never eat it all, especially since Hubs is not a big fan of sourdough anyway.  Simply turning it into bread crumbs was an option, but with Thanksgiving on my mind croutons became an inspirational option.  Besides, with bread crumbs I was limited - with croutons I still had the grind-them-into-crumbs option.  Hubs also doesn't care for croutons on his salad (I could go on and on...) so I knew if I sized them smaller, like the packaged stuffing croutons,  I'd have a good and fresher use for them - for stuffed pork chops or chicken, crushed for meatloaf, or as a coating for meat, poultry or fish before baking or frying.  I did use the optional garlic salt and wish I hadn't.   The croutons were just  a tad saltier than I would prefer and will limit me when I mix them up with anything else.  I need to remember that no additional salt will be necessary!  I also added some poultry seasoning and dried parsley flakes, tho' the seasonings you  could use are limited only by your imagination.  I froze these in freezer bags so I expect they'll stay fresh a good, long while.  There are no words adequate to express the good, fresh taste of these compared to the hard and stale taste of the commercial croutons.  They're a little bit of monkeying around, especially if you make them small as I did.  But I'll tell you what - I found myself nibbling on these and I just can't see myself doing that with the packaged stuff!

I used Italian bread. I started with half butter half oil. I melted the butter then added Italian spices and then the oil I did not measure anything. Mixed all three together. I added the diced bread pieces and gently mixed all four ingredients together by hand. l put them on a single layer in the oven. I put them in the oven on 300 for about 10 minutes. AWESOME!!!! My kids and I started eating them right away! They loved it! Thank you!

Easy, delicious, and a great way to use up old bread! Instead of brushing with butter I coated the inside of a large Ziplock bag with melted butter, added bread, and shook to coat.  Then I spread on the cooking sheet and sprinkled with garlic powder.

yum! but why cut off the crusts? I took my cue from my favorite italian restaurant that doesn't cut of theirs and they turned out great. Instead of brushing on the butter, I just tossed the cubes with the butter in a bowl. I also sprinkled on some grated parm before baking.

Instead of tossing some stale hamburger buns, I decided to turn them into croutons. I knew they would be easy to make but rarely have taken the time.  It is so easy to just log on to All Recipes and get a quick recipe and all the advice that goes with other reviews. Thank you for providing this service. Good croutons by the way and no more wasted bread. :-)

I used the empty bread bag and added the cubed bread. I drizzled the cubes with olive oil, then sprinkled with onion salt, garlic salt, orgegano and marjoram. With the bag puffed with air, I twisted the end and shook it all. Spread on a baking sheet - 300 degrees for 20 minutes. Hint: go easy on the salts.

Great basic recipe!  Used olive oil on bread with the crusts left on. Sprinkled with Penzey's italian herb mix.  Baked 25 minutes.  Great with soup! And so easy!

This was the first time my own croutons.  They were wonderful.  My son especially liked them.  He ate most of them before I could get a salad (cobb) made.  I think I am going to make anoter, bigger batch right now.

I used this idea for stale biscuits that I made over the weekend. I sliced them in half and then cubed them. Heated a skillet and added 4 tablespoons butter and grated 4 cloves of fresh garlic into the butter. Added salt and pepper. Spread the cubes on a tray and then drizzled the butter over and baked for 15 min.  Turned out awesome! Normally would of went with garlic powder but was out.

Easy and delicious.  I didn't use garlic salt, but I added chopped fresh garlic, onion powder, and seasoning salt.  I also halved the butter and added equal amount of olive oil.   With these, who needs lettuce for a salad?

These were alright. They were really nothing special, but when I decided to make salad last minute, they did the job and they did it quick. I might use this as a base recipe later, but I will definitely spice them up A LOT as they tend to lose their flavor when they bake.

I also use a bit of onion powder or onion salt with these.  Then, if I want to stuff a chicken breast or pork chop, I just use my homemade croutons and prepare like I would for stuffing.  Fast and easy !

These were fabulous. I just did a light sprinkle of garlic powder (I'm not crazy about garlic) and I also sprinkled parmesan cheese over them. They were delicious!

These are a great way to use up leftover bread! I saved the heels of the bread in the freezer until I had enough, supprisingly they added up pretty fast. Then I took them out and defrosted them in the toaster and followed the recipe.

With today's high prices I can't afford to throw anything out, had five slices of Italian bread. I used butter and olive oil mixed with some garlic powder, salt and Italian seasoning. Baked at 350 Absolutely delicious. Will make again.

This recipe is awsome.  I didn't want to by a $2 bag of croutons when I had slices of leftover bread that went stale.  I cut up the bread slices with the crust on, drizzled melt butter, parsley, basil, garlic powdwer and salt.  Mixed it together and baked it.  Oh how delicious!!

I enjoyed these with a whole wheat bread and just a touch of seasoned salt for extra kick. Actually had eaten half of them alone before I was ready to use them in the dish I had planned for them. Yumm!

These were good but using the "brush on" method as directed didn't leave enough butter for all 15 slices of bread-I only got thru 1/2. I decided to just stick w/the half. Good but  we prefer "garlic croutons" on AR.

Easy and delicious! I used half garlic salt and half Mrs. Dash for a little extra flavors.  No need to buy croutons ever again, with the bonus that you can vary the seasonings and size of the croutons to your tastes. Thanks for this recipe- I will be using it often!

This was very easy and tasty.  My bread wasn't stale so I toasted it on the lowest setting of my toaster to help dry it out first.  Thanks for saving my salad.  :)

Great simple recipe. I add oregano to the butter. Tasted great! I do have a hard time brushing the butter on the bread, the brush gets all crumby and gunked up, so I chop the bread up and shake it all up in a bowl with a lid, covers the cubes of bread better.

This is great to use as a starting technique.  I also add a little olive oil, parmesan cheese and a sprinkling of oregano to the butter, much like I do with my garlic bread.    Also try omitting the garlic, butter the bread and then sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.  Perfect for those more fruit-based salads when you add things like apples, pears, raisins, nuts, chicken breasts etc., or to top pumpkin or butternut squash soup!  I bake these at 300 degrees because the sugar tends to burn quickly.  Yum!

Great. I too. cut the bread first, poured the melted butter over cubes, then added the galic salt (I halved the saltd). Bake them a coupeld extra minutes. None left for the salad; the family ate them as a snack. Delicious and easy! Thank you, no need for store bought, these are fast and much better tasting. :D

Great.  I sprinkled basil, oregano, black pepper and parmesan cheese into melted butter.  Did not use garlic.  Baked in oven for about 19 minutes to make a little crispier.

I used butter flavored cooking spray instead of melted butter and then sprinkled with garlic salt.  I also cut up a loaf of french bread.  So good the kids and hubby ate most of them before we even had salads.  Will definitely make these instead of buying the hard croutons in the box.

Awesome basic recipe that you can doctor up if you wish, or just keep it simple.  I used olive oil instead of butter to be a tiny bit more healthy.

I took the basic concept of this recipe and ran with it. So much better (and cheaper) than store-bought croutons. Plus I like that you can create a bunch of different flavor combos with just a little creativity. I'll never throw stale bread away again! I seasoned mine with parmesan cheese, fresh ground pepper, garlic powder, and italian herbs. My husband and I ate more by the handful than we did on our salads!

Great recipe! I cubed my bread and set in oven for a couple days (oven off!) to get get a jump on “staleness”. Sprayed with olive oil and used Trader Joe’s Garlic Salt   Followed recipe first couple of times but found that baking at lower temp produced croutons just the right color and crispness. Thank you for a keeper recipe!

I used whole wheat bread and experimented with the crusts. Honestly, they're just as good with crusts on--I can't tell the difference in taste. I also included some basil and Parmesan to taste. Excellent recipe--I had to use a lot of self control not to eat the entire batch right out of the oven. Yum!

Easy, and worked well with a low-carb/high-fiber bread. Will make this again. I seasoned with an All-Purpose seasoning instead of the garlic salt.

Great base recipe. I used some soursough loaf bread from Costco and I used olive oil and salt and fresh cracked pepper. I prefer mine with a subtle flavor. I will use these on my salad and in some roasted tomato soup like they do at Tender Greens. Excellent, thanks!

THANK YOU! I made this recipe this afternoon and they tasted wonderful.  I have always found store bought croutons to be SO hard they hurt my teeth. These are toasted just enough and taste great!

WOW! What a great fun recipe! My family loves croutons and now that I have made these I will never buy boxed again! I used butter spray and played with the seasonings. I experimented on about 7 different pieces of bread and we loved them all. You can really do anything with the seasonings on this. I will try next time with real butter, less healthy, but I'm sure they will be to die for. I also did not remove the crust, very tastey!!

These are great!  I rarely use croutons so it doesn't pay for me to buy a whole box.  Now that I know how simple it is I'll always just make them.  These did seem a bit salty (I use salted butter) so next time I'll use half garlic powder.

VERY YUMMY!! I attempted to make homeade bread for the first time in my new KitchenAid mixer...for my first time making bread it wasn't bad...but very bland!!  So I didn't wanna waste a whole loaf of bread...

I made Delicious Ham and Potato soup (from this site) for dinner and I topped it with these homeade croutons...

I melted some butter in a pan and used garlic powder, parsley, salt and pepper.....i tossed the butter with the bread in a bowl then dumped onto a baking tray!  we put the croutons right on top of our soup  :)

SOOOO good and I cant wait to make them again!!

I used leftover dried up foccacia bread with a hint of ?rosemary? Lovely texture.  As decribed, heated with butter and garlic, then 350 for 15 minutes.  OOOO my god!  SOOO good.  I added a touch of salt as my butter did not have any.  *Bad, I know, but I like salty stuff!*

I will never buy store bought croutons again! These are so fast and easy! Had to make a second batch since we ate most of the others as soon as they came out of the oven.  Can wait to try with other seasonings.

I like to make these with "everything" bagels and cut them in long, thin slices.  These have so much flavor all you need to do is butter them before baking.  Then I refrigerate them in a ziplock and they last for awhile.  Good stuff!

Made these croutons today.  Absolutely wonderful results!  I found that I had to bake a bit longer than recommended, but then everyones oven is different.  Just keep an eye on them the first time you make them to make sure they are dry and not too brown.  There will never be another loaf of stale bread in this house!  I'm munching while I type!  YUM . . .

I had half a loaf of rosemary garlic bread that I did not want to go to waste...thankfully I found this recipe, they made THE BEST croutons!  I used olive oil instead of butter and some fresh ground pepper.  What a versatile recipe

These turned out awesome!  I will never buy them again.  We always have stale sandwich bread or French bread around the house.  These took very little time to make.  I used some stale French bread that I was about to pitch so I decided to make croutons.  Glad that I found this recipe.  These are so good, I am just eating them as a snack.

I cubed the bread, put it in a bowl and drizzled in the melted butter.  Added garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.  Tossed with a fork, spread on a preheated baking sheet and baked for 17 minutes. (perfect for my oven)  They were awesome.  I'll never buy croutons again.  Thank you!!!

So good. I used EVOO in place of the butter.  Placed the bread in a bowl threw some EVOO and garlic salt over the bread and mixed well. Baked for about 15 min. Crunch and delicious!

I did not bother to cut into cubes, just sliced, and used spray instead of butter, what a great suggestion! These were perfectly crisp and very tasty. I used them in french onion soup, with just a sprinkle of parmesan cheese. Very good, and low fat! Thanks for the easy recipe.

These were good, but the powdered seasoning makes it taste a bit artificial to me. Straight butter without the seasoning might be better. I also did a batch with more olive oil than butter with very difference taste results (obviously), but still the same good crunch.

Very good croutons.  I like crispier croutons than this recipe allows, so I baked longer than stated.  I baked at 350 for 15 minutes, then stirred them and baked another 10 minutes.  This resulted in the perfect crispiness for me.  I, too, just poured the butter over already cut bread cubes and mixed with garlic powder and a bit of salt (no garlic salt in this house).  Turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow! I used my own creativity with these and they are knock outs! And like others have said they are spectacular out of the oven. Still slightly chewy and warm and flavorful. Yuuuuummmie! I threw them in a bowl with some hunks of mozzarella and fresh tomatoes and basil and had me a brushetta salad! Fabulous!

Simple, easy, and delicious. The garlic salt was an absolute must for me. Without it, I would have been afraid there would not be enough flavor to help the croutons kick into the salad. It turned out great and absolutely tasty!

This is a fantastic crouton recipe.. I don't even buy store bought croutons anymore. The garlic salt is a must.

This is the basic of the basic crouton recipes and yes, you will never want to buy boxed croutons again.  Get creative! Add seasonings, or cheese.  I also cube the bread (use bagels, english muffins, french/italian bread, etc) I've used 50-50 butter and olive oil and even added some Ceasar dressing or Ranch dressing for "flavored" croutons.

Perfect! You can add spices etc to suit your tastes and needs. I add fresh ground Italian Blend for an Italian take on these and have also add grated Parmesan as well. I haven't purchased store bought croutons since finding this. Thank you so much!

Way too easy, probably will never again buy the store brands now that I know this.  There are so many variations that you can experiment with, can't wait to run out so I can make some more!  And I love that I don't have to throw away stale bread now.

This recipe is a good idea but with some modifications its FABULOUS! I used the left over butt ends of my homemade breadmaker bread. (Nobody in my family likes the butts.) They were perfect for croutons. Then I pounded up a mix of grilling herbs with my mortar and pistle threw in some Adobo seasoning and used probably a little more butter than would be very healthy and it was perfect. The herbs and extra salt made these the perfect complement to my salad and even a great snack. Next time I'm going to try olive oil. I'm expecting the same general result but better for us.

Great recipe ! This is a good way to use stale/ getting old bread.  I made them last night with some leftover hot dog buns and my husband did not believe me that I made them.   Awesome recipe and easy to adjust for taste, such as adding additional seasonings (basil, etc)

Who knew croutons would be so darn easy.  We had some leftover three-cheese bread from Panera that was going stale.  I cut it up, tossed in a ziploc bag as another reviewer recommended, poured the butter in and tossed.  Put on a couple cookie sheets and baked it up!  I did turn the croutons half-way through baking, and the cheese bread took much longer than the 15 minutes.  We've already ate half of the batch just snacking!

Perfect!  I forgot to buy croutons to go with the soup I made today.  Of course my favorite recipe site didn't let me down!  I only had 5 slices of wheat bread, but I ended up using the same amount of butter, brushing it on both sides.  I didn't cut the crust off, which was fine- yummy, crusty croutons!  I sprinkled garlic powder on one side, garlic salt on the other, without measuring.  I baked for like 20 minutes, checking frequently.  I'll be sure to make these again!

SOOOO much better than store-bought.  Instead of butter, I lightly brush my bread with light olive oil and sprinkle it with whatever sounds good (I try to stay away from the salts - garlic salt, onion salt, etc.) since we don't need the extra salt when they taste so good!

I used a loaf of rye bread and they turned out great.  Ran out of butter, so I used some Pam spray, and it worked perfectly!  Will definitely make again.

I absolutely love this recipe! I saw the prices in the grocery store for croutons and I decided why not make my own? This was the first recipe I found and it is great. I love the fact that the spices and seasonings can be altered to make different flavored croutons.

WOW! What fun! So good, so easy. cut up bread, drizzled butter with a little ranch mix and some garlic powder baked and enjoyed.  Read all the reviews and made a double batch on first try figuring I'd bring some to my sis who just had a baby... Well, my kids gobbled them all up.  I had to hide some for tonites salad.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I work at a bakery and have stale bread laying around all the time.. not anymore!!

Gave it 5 stars because I know it will be good.  My first try yeilded a 1 star because "I" messed it up.  Used WAY too much garlic salt and parmesean cheese(which is salty by itself), and unsalted butter.  Needless to say, it was so salty we couldn't eat it.  My only recommendation is to watch the salt products because it doesn't take much.  Next time I will try w/ unsalted butter, garlic powder, and parmesean cheese.

This is the best, easiest way to make your own croutons. I use it for leftover homemade bread, so I usually have to cube it in advance. We make an artisan loaf that has a fair number of holes throughout. So since it's easier, I melt a little butter with some fresh garlic in it in a container, then pull out the garlic, put the cubes in and shake to cover. It works great for us since we follow a low salt diet and my hubby doesn't care for heavy garlic. I say spice it to taste and go for it!

I used whole wheat bread and butter flavored cooking spray. Using garlic salt made it too salty so I used garlic powder sprinkled on 1 side of the bread. Then I had tasty, low calorie breadcrumbs.

This was super easy.  I had some sour dough bread and it made great croutons.  I found I needed to cook them for another 5 minutes for them to be the right crunchiness.  I went very light on the garlic salt, and I sprinkled on some dried parsley just for color.

I made these for my caesar's salad and it was perfect!  I had 2 french rolls in the freezer which needed to be used - had borderline freezer burn.  I sliced them still a bit hard and followed the recipe.  After 7 minutes, I flipped the cubes so both sides were browned and continued baking for another 7 minutes or so.  Will definitely make these again!

Thanks for the recipe. I am too lazy to melt the margarine for a small serving, so I just spread it on both sides of the bread before cutting it into cubes.  I like to sprinkle my croutons with oregano, basil and onion powder.  The baking time is perfect.

Great! Left the crusts on and cut up the bread with a pizza cutter. Used pizza seasonings instead of garlic salt.

Excellent!  My hubby and I are on the Weight Watcher's program, so I used Village Hearth brand Light Italian Bread, Parkay brand FF Spray Butter, and Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb flavored seasoning.  We both have been eating them as a handy snack.  Thanks so much!

These were great!  So easy too!  Tasted like the kind you get in a restaurant.  I used garlic pepper salt, but next time I may just use garlic powder.  I've tried to make homemade croutons before like my mom used to... in a skillet on top of the stove, and I always ended up with a burnt mess.  Will never buy pre-packaged again!  Thanks Carol :)

Great recipe to add whatever flavors you like...My italian bread had been in the freezer, so I turned down the heat to 325, and let it dry out longer..I only had garlic and onion powder, so I added regular salt.
I have two more loaves of 39¢ Italian bread to use.
The recipes plainly states to add your flavors...This is just a basic start..People shouldn't rate the recipe low because they didn't read it.

I made this with more bread, twice the butter & more of the spices. the bread was potato bread, from mashed potatoes I had left over, and about a week old. I ended up crisping it up for an extra 7 minutes and it came out great. It's going to be on the menu with some salad at a dinner tomorrow.

These croutons turned out great. I didn't have any stale bread so I used Texas toast. I left the crusts on and cut the bread up into cubes, melted the butter and mixed in garlic powder and seasoned salt, poured it over the cubes, mixed and coated, then baked. I like these better than store-bought.

I made and modified to use what I had on hand. Garlic powder with a pinch of kosher salt.  I followed another reviewers advice and cut bread into croutons first then put  in a plastic bag and poured butter and other ingredients over it, shook and then put in oven.  I also added about a tablespoon of sundried tomato spread because I thought it would add a nice touch and it was lovely.  Loved the crunchy outer parts in contrast with the softer center- so good!!

I thought I would give this recipe a try because we were out of store-bought croutons. I took the advice of another cook on here and baked them at 200 for a really long time. These are so easy, and you're in charge of what's going into them. My husband likes them better than store-bought ones, so its a winner!

5 stars for my version- I didn’t use butter. I sprayed the cookie sheet with Crisco butter flavored non-stick olive oil spray, then sprayed the tops of the cubes in their single layer on the sheet. Sprinkled (liberally) with garlic powder. YUM!

So good...never buying packaged croutons again. I usually pick up day old bread or rolls on discount when I make these. So it is  really inexpensive and comes together quickly, no reason to buy pre-made croutons ever again! I have used half butter and half olive oil and also all olive oil and they come out tasting great every time. Sometimes I will add a little fresh grated parmesean too! This is something I can feel good about putting on my salads, in my soup, or just snacking on because I know exactly what is in it! Thank you for a great recipe....one more pre packaged food I can leave off my grocery list!

Simple and good. I used garlic powder because I didn't have garlic salt and it was tasty. I might have taken them out of the oven just a bit sooner than 15 minutes - maybe because my bread was already quite dry.

This is pretty good. I would recommend using kaiser buns and some Lowry's seasoning salt to give it an awesome punch.

I had some stale bread so chopped it up and made croutons and they are really delicious. we eat it like chips. I replaced butter with olive oil and put trader joe's 21 seasoning salute and it was so easy, quick, and great tasting.

I do use this recipe for leftover bread but I also buy Rosemary Herb Slab Bread or Olive Bread and make tastier croutons as hostess gifts. I increase the garlic salt and butter for my tastes and package them attractively.  They freeze well and all always a great addition to soups or salads.

Easy and good.  I used the ends of several loaves, as my family tends to waste those.  Stored extras in the freezer 3 months.  Thawed quickly and was still crunchy.

Very tasty basic recipe. I only used half the butter and subbed olive oil for the other half just to make it a little healthier. They came out much better than store bought.

I used this as a jumping off place.  Used leftover gluten free sandwich bread, including the end pieces.  Cut into cubes first, drizzled with avocado oil, then salt, cracked pepper, and dried thyme. Toasted for about 5 minutes at 410, while toasting my bread for today's sandwich, then 8 minutes longer at 350. They were still a bit soft inside, so I put them back in the oven while it cooled off and left them there for another 30.  The thyme smells heavenly in the kitchen and will lend a strong flavor to tomorrow's salad.

Whenever I have a loaf of nice bread that we don't finish, I freeze it and make croutons for salad or soup. I love to make nice big ones for soup.  I add some olive oil too.

This is the best and simplest crouton recipe I have ever made.  I will use this one again and again.  I have made it three times already using different kinds of bread and they were all fabulous.  The first time I made these I used regular white sandwich bread, the second time I used potato bread and the third time I used some stale hamburger buns and all worked equally well.  I followed the recipe to a "T" however I left mine in the oven a bit longer than the 15 minutes because I like my croutons fairly brown and crunchy.  I use different seasonings each time based on what I feel like using.  My favorite is a little garlic salt, onion salt and paprika.  YUM!!!  This one is definitely a keeper!  I will NEVER buy the store bought croutons again!

Delicious! These were so easy. I had a leftover loaf of french bread that was becoming stale so I used that instead. For a healthier choice use low-fat margarine instead of butter. 
For some different variations you can add some cheese, cinnamon, basil...ect

I use my olive oil mister to spray these instead of using butter or shaking them in a bag. It cuts down on the saturation so they stay crispy. Easy, quick recipe that works very well.

I really am so proud that I made my own croutons, and I did it with this recipe!  I think I might have made more than required per the recipe.  I used a hotdog bun and eight large hamburger buns that were stale.  The croutons are nice and crispy without the threat of breaking your teeth.  Next time I will use the suggested amount of garlic.  I used only half this time.  Also, I will use French or Italian bread next time, but the buns worked well too. I did not remove the crusts, and I baked them for twenty minutes on 350.  I think this will work with any kind of bread.  Thanks so much for sharing!

These are delicious. I used leftover day old loaf of Italian bread that you take home and bake. I did not remove the crust. I used McCormick sea salt and garlic grinder for the seasoning. I cut the slices into about 1/2" cubes, put the cubes in a resealable zip-lock bag, ground the sea salt/garlic, closed the bag and shook. I served them on homemade tomato basil soup. We will be having these again.

Sooo good! I debated on throwing out 2 ends and 1 slice of whole wheat bread yesterday and I thought about homemade croutons. So with only 3 slices of bread, I cut into cubes,sprayed with olive oil spray and sprinkled with garlic powder and fresh cracked pepper. So yummy and crispy on my salad last night. Will make again and try different herbs and spices. Thanks!

These croutons turned out fabulous. Thanks to previous reviewers I made sure to use a pizza cutter which saved lots of time I'm sure in cutting the croutons. Also 10 minutes was a better gauge of time for my oven. My husband's face lit up when he popped one in his mouth!

I had bought a wheat free bread hoping to enjoy my first sandwich in a long time.  However my white rice bread was not sandwich worthy.  Not wanting to waste 5 dollars it did make excellent croutons and bread crumbs with the outers.  I added a little fresh basil to the butter while melting and the garlic powder.  I used a little more butter to soak in the bread.  I have allergy legal croutons. =)

Who knew croutons were so easy to make!  I will never buy them again.  Fresh is the way to go from now on.  To be honest, my 5 year old who loves cooking pretty much made these on his own.  I just helped him cut the bread and put it in the oven.  Even the hubby commented on how good they were :D

I realized when dinner was almost ready that I dodn't have any croutons for the caesar salad.  I lightly toasted some whole grain bread, cut it into cubes, tossed it with melted Becel, garlic powder and parmesan cheese and then baked. I'm glad we ran out, these were much better then store bought.

I used this recipe directionally... Diced up 1/2 loaf leftover Vienna bread, tossed in a bowl with a bunch of spray butter, Italian seasoning and a little parmasean cheese.  Baked for 20 min. at 325 degrees.  Delicious!  Crispy but so light and fluffy!
