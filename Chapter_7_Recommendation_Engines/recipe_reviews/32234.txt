Not bad, but a bit much on the syrup.  Don't really like raspberry with my tequila.

this was good.  I think I like my drinks a little less syrupy though.

This is pretty good. I added just a little less syrup and used sugar on the rims instead of salt. It's kind of like Applebee's perfect margarita. Yummy!

Good drink but you really should use sugar instead of salt to rim the glass.
