This was excellent!  I made it exactly as written except I soaked the sliced bananas in acidulated water to prevent them from turning brown.  I sprinkled crushed vanilla wafters on the top because the picture with the whole cookies on top doesn't look very appealing.  My husband, who loves banana anything, ate it all gone!

This is delicious and super-easy.  I have made 2 double batches in the past week for people at my school, it went like hotcakes.  Several people asked for the recipe.  I used french vanilla pudding mix, one extra-creamy CoolWhip and one Vanilla CoolWhip, 8 oz. regular sour cream and 8 oz. light sour cream.  I used about 1/2 cup less milk than the full quart needed so the pudding would not be soupy.  I also used Pepperidge Farm Mini-Chessmen cookies in place of the vanilla wafers.  I highly recommend using Chessmen cookies, either regular size or minis, anytime you make banana pudding.  They really class up the taste.  That said, if you are only making a single batch, I would use the regular sour cream instead of the light, since light sour cream has a much softer texture and probably would make a 'soupier' pudding.  All in all, a wonderful pudding recipe and really quick and easy!  Thanks for the posting!

Not your typical banana pudding taste.  I really like this one better.  It's not quite as sweet and rich.  Has a GREAT flavor!  I like it better if you make it ahead and let it chill for 24 hours before you serve.  Also, I always stir the bananas into the pudding then layer with wafer.

Wonderful banana pudding recipe. My kind of recipe, very easy and fast to make and not a ton of complicated ingredients or instructions. Tastes great. I used 2 small, 3.4 oz., boxes of vanilla pudding instead of one larger one. Stayed with the same amounts of milk, sour cream and cool whip. It was a little thicker but I actually liked the neat servings out of the bowl being less sloppy than your usual puddings. My mistake: I whisked the pudding, sour cream, cool whip and milk but discovered that some of the pudding mix was on the bottom and didn't get mixed in until I was pouring the last layer. I mixed it in as best I could but had a bit of a lumpy super thick last layer. No one noticed though as they were too busy gobbling it up. Even if you don't use this recipe, I highly recommend using any recipe calling for the vanilla pudding in the banana pudding dish and NOT banana pudding mixes. Banana pudding mix has sort of an artificial banana flavor but the real bananas and the vanilla pudding make it perfect.

Made this last night for girl's night with ALL fat free or low fat ingredients.  It was such a big hit!  I had some today, 24hrs later, and found it to be even better, now that the cookies have softened up.  This was great, different, and sooo easy!

This recipe was so easy my husband thought there ws no way it would be good!  He is used to "his Mom's" baked banana pudding and thought this would not come close.  I made it for a dinner party we had, and he LOVED it, as did every one else.  I used light sour cream, light cool whip, and 1% milk, and I couldn't imagine it any better.  Thanks for the easy recipe it ROCKS!

Wonderful, easy recipe. I always end up using more bananas than what this calls for though...Update: Every time I make this one I get raves. I think its the sour cream.

This recipe is DELICIOUS! My family loved it. First time I made it exactly as stated. However, the second time I substituted the sour cream with soy sour cream and the milk for plain soy milk (due to milk allergies in my family). It tasted exactly the same! Will make again and again!

You will love this Banana Pudding!!! Whenever we have a picnic or pot luck I am always asked to make this. For those of you that said you soak your bananas before making I really don't think you need to do that. I have never had mine turn brown in this pudding recipe. I am not sure if it is the sour cream that stops them from turning or what but they don't. Also I finish this off with pudding not wafers then I crush some wafers and sprinkle on top. This recipe will not disappoint ....

Not bad, I would cut the sour cream down to 4 ounces though, I could still taste an over powering taste of sour cream. Would make again though, just tweek it a bit. I would give 3.5 starts if I could so I will give it a 3 for now.

I think it's the sour cream that really makes this recipe... I tried another banana pudding recipe on here that used cream cheese and did not care for it. I used french vanilla pudding mix instead of vanilla, honey graham crackers instead of vanilla wafers, and lite sour cream instead of regular sour cream. I also coated the bananas with lemon juice so they wouldn't brown.  I also only used about 2/3 of the container of whipped topping for the pudding mixture - I used the remaining 1/3 as my top layer. I placed vanilla wafers on top of the final whipped topping layer just for looks... Anyway I made it the night before to allow the graham crackers to soak in the pudding mixture. I got RAVE reviews on this one - people said that for a northern girl, I can make awesome banana pudding down here in the South :)

May all time favorite recipe!  I added more banans because people said it was a bit skimpy on them.  I also added more cookies - I lined the bottom of the pan and the top too!  This is a mega keeper - so light and fluffy it will make you eyes roll back in your head!

Tasty, although I added lots, lots, lots more bananas. Sliced them down into thin slices and sprinkled them with reconstituted lemon juice to make sure they wouldn't turn black.  Used regular flavored instance vanilla pudding, but probably will use French vanilla next time and/or add vanilla extract. Wanted just a tad more vanilla flavoring. Used generic vanilla wafer cookies, so maybe that might make a difference as well.

This is just as tasty with lowfat/fat free sour cream, "free" whipped topping, sugar free pudding and nonfat milk or fat free evaporated milk. To keep your bananas from browning quickly, you can toss them in just a tablespoon of lemon juice. For a more banana flavor, I suggest using banana instant pudding.

This is probably my favorite recipe for Banana Pudding.  It's not too sweet like the ones which use condensed milk.  I lower the fat and calories by using 1% milk and fat-free frozen whipped topping. It is still just as delicious.

Worth every 5 star if only for how easy it is to make.  I used everything with reduced cals a little less milk since the low cal pudding is a little softer than regular pudding mix.  Think I'll try it with ginger snaps next.

Absolutely fabulous recipe! Very fluffy and light! I followed recipe EXACTLY. To the reviewer whose pudding was "soupy", I would bank that she either didn't use the correct size of pudding box (it is the LARGER 5 ounce box, not the smaller 3.5 ounce) or she actually prepared the pudding with milk in addition to the milk in the recipe. This banana pudding, as made per the recipe stands up completely tall and firm adjacent to any cut portion. Will make again and again!!

My diabetic aunt made a low sugar and lowfat version of this using sugar free instant pudding and sugar free Cool Whip, skim milk, lowfat sour cream and reduced fat Nilla wafers.  I use 2 pkgs of the sugar free instant pudding and 4 cups of milk and whisk this together for a full 2 minutes before folding in the sour cream and Cool Whip.  It makes a big recipe, good for a crowd.

Made this as written, but used low fat ingredients for everything other then the sour cream, just because that is what I had on hand.  This came out very good, but does need to be made a day ahead of time for the wafers to soften up.  Will make again for a quick no bake dessert during the hot summer months here in the desert!! Thanks for another great AR recipe!!

I made this recipe over the weekend for my boyfriend. I used skim milk and soaked the bananas in 7-UP before layering them. At first I wasn't too sure of the taste because while I was mixing all I could taste was the sour cream but after chilling for several hours it was perfect and my boyfriend said it was incredible. I liked it too!

Absolutely the best Banana Pudding recipe I've come across!  I like the almost mousse consistency of the pudding and that it's not overbearingly sweet.  It's just right!  Made this for a Memorial Day picnic and it was the first dessert that disappeared & everyone wanted the recipe!  Excellent and quick & super easy!!

This recipe will be used often!!!  I made earlier in the day. Delicious.  I added 1/2 pkg. of regular (8 oz.) cream cheese to milk mixture first in kitchen aid mixer for about 3 minutes to blend in well, then added other ingredients.  With banana slices, put them in a little water with lemon juice to keep them from browning.  Awesome recipe!!!  Thanks for sharing.

I didn't try this out yet, but plan on making it this week for a coworker's birthday.  He asked for a banana pudding with vanilla wafers.
Anyhow, I love watching the Food Network and two different personalities had suggestions that are perfect for this recipe:  Sandra Lee said that she will put the milk in the freezer for 15 minutes before mixing it up in her banana pudding.  The second came from the Neely's.  They made their own whipped cream by using 1 cup heavy cream, 4 Tbsp confectioners sugar and 1 tsp vanilla.  Just mix the heavy cream for a couple of minutes, add the confectioner's sugar and mix until you have soft peaks.  Fold in the vanilla.  
In the case of this recipe, I would fold in the sour cream, pudding mix and milk at this point.

Very delicious! Even better overnight after all the pudding is soaked up in the bananas and cookies.  I strongly suggest you prepare the night before serving.  My only concern was that the pudding was a little too soupy.  I will probably add less milk next time to make it a little thicker.

Don't panic if you don't have time to thaw the whipped topping--I thawed for 15 minutes in a bowl of hot water then whipped it smooth with a hand mixer. I substituted banana cream pudding for the vanilla.  My last layer was banana, which didn't look very appetizing.  I topped it crumbled nilla wafers.   Next time I think I'll try real whipped topping for the pudding mixture and topping.   This worked great!  I prepared it in 15 minutes.

Everyone loved this! I made mine in an 11x8 glass dish since I don't have a trifle bowl. I did my layers as: cookies, pudding, bananas, cookies, pudding, bananas, pudding, then crushed the remaining cookies and sprinkled them on top. Covered it, and chilled it overnight and served it the next night for dessert, and it was inhaled! Seriously easy and so delicious, I will be making this again happily as well as at the insistent request of my family! Thankyou!

First time ever making banana pudding, it turned out great.  It was so easy & quick.  I made double batch.  I did use the bite size waffers instead of the traditional size, and crumbled some for the top layer. I also sprinkled the banana slices with lemon juice to keep them from turning brown.

This was great!! Very easy and simple. My 2 yr. old helper had a wonderful time. It takes about 10 minutes to get everything ready then another 5 or so to assemble. I layered mine in a trifle bowl with 4 layers and got many compliments. I have made other banana puddings with cream cheese instead of the sour cream and this one tasted lighter and not as rich. More kid friendly in my opinion.I would definitely recommend this.

Awesome. Good balance by using sour cream.  I used 3 oz of pudding w/ 6 cups of milk (like making reg. pudding by the box). Seperately combined by sour cream and cool whip. Seperately made my pudding. Layered like this: Wafers, pudding, s. cream/whip mix, bananas. Repeat.  Was asked for the recipe. So good. Definitely will use this again! Oh, I used light s. cream, lite cool whip, 2% milk, and sugar free topping - still stinkin' awesome.

My family loves layered banana pudding and this is special because of the addition of sour cream. I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the pudding and mixed only about half of the whipped topping into the pudding, then put a thin layer of the whipped topping on top of the pudding. My husband and I only had one helping because my daughters had their friends over and they ate what was left.

Yummy!  Very rich and flavorful, especially with vanilla pudding.  

My only trouble was this: I refuse to use Cool Whip (hydrogenated vegetable oil and high fructose corn syrup...no thanks, I try not to eat plastic when I can help it ;))

I used real whipped cream from a pressurized can, which I believe kept the pudding from setting up correctly (since real cream has lots of water in it).

Is there a version of this for those of us who prefer REAL food and not laboratory-manufactured chemicals?

My family and I did not like this recipe at all!  The filling was way to thick and I even added 2 extra cups of milk.  This recipe didn't seem to have enough flavor either.  I will stick with my old recipe and will not be making this again!

We really liked this banana pudding recipe.  I didn't use anywhere near the amount of Nilla Wafers the recipe calls for and I really don't see how you could use an entire 16-ounce box and not have there be way too much cookie in the dessert.  I used about 2/3 of a 12-ounce box and it ended up being perfect.  I finished with a layer of pudding mixture with Nilla Wafers sticking partway out of the top around the edge of the dish and then crumbled up about 6 more Nilla Wafers on top.  I really liked the slight tanginess the sour cream gives to this dessert.  Other recipes that call for sweetened condensed milk are just way too sweet.  I'll definitely make this one over and over.  Thanks for sharing, LeAnne!

Excellent and easy recipe!  Instead of using whole wafers on top, i crushed some in a ziploc and sprinkled them on top.  Followed with powdered sugar.  This is a keeper for sure!

THE BEST BANANA PUDDING EVEN THE LOW FAT VERSION!! I have made this several times and EVERY time people beg me for the recipe. There is never any left over. I make it with fat free cool whip, fat free sour cream, skim milk, sugar free vanilla pudding (use two of the large boxes) and low fat vanilla wafer cookies and it is still AMAZING!!! Also, I line the bottom of the glass dish with the whole cookies, but I crumble the rest of the cookies and layer the pudding and bananas with the crumbled wafer cookies so you get cookie in EVERY bite!!

Easy and great tasting!  I opted to use only 1 2/3 C. of milk to keep it from being soupy.  But for my first time ever making Banana Pudding this was about the easiest recipe I could have chosen!

I have made this several times now, and used some different variations.  I usually layer with the cookies on bottom, then the bananas (so they're covered up as others have said), then the pudding mixture, and then I usually put another layer of whipped cream on top with a few crumbled vanilla wafers, just for presentation.  I have made this with fat free sour cream and 2% milk, I've also used both regular vanilla pudding and french vanilla pudding, and I've also made a couple of times with fat-free sugar-free vanilla pudding for my diabetic niece.  All variations have turned out wonderful, the only thing I've had problems with was when I used the fat-free sugar-free pudding I found it didn't mix as easily so I had to make sure I added the pudding after I had mixed the other ingredients together and had my hand mixer at the ready to blend it in well.  Other than that it was wonderful.  A good dessert that is very yummy and not too rich.  My family has started expecting me to make this for family get-togethers and it is so easy that I'll keep doing it.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is simply an amazing recipe.  The pudding is firm, thick, and rich.  It's not overly sweet.  I would recommend using less vanilla wafers.

Yummy Yummy Yummy and SOOOO easy.  I cook for other families and it was great to layer 3 seperate tupper ware containers full!  I will make this again and try it with light sour cream. It calls for whole milk but I used 1% and it came out great.

Kids and adults at our church potluck scarfed this dessert up! The bowl was empty real quick! Everyone asked for the recipe and was pretty amazed that the recipe called for sour cream (the "secret" ingredient). This is a must have!

I made this for a family gathering and now everyone asks me to bring this super easy dessert. I made it the day before and let it sit in the frig. It only gets better with time.

Exactly what I was looking for. This is a stellar, super-simple dessert. Great tasting and also fun if you let the kids help.

This was so simple to make and it is so! delicious. I used about a 1/2 cup of sour cream and dipped the bananas in a lemon juice and water mix to slow down their browning. 1/4 cup water 2tbs lemon juice. Must make again

I made this for my students (high school seniors) and the response was a unilateral thumbs-up! Even the girl who doesn't like bananas liked it! I made it just as written, although I ended up not using as many bananas or nilla wafers as called for, this was likely due to the size of the dishes I had used. I will definitely make this again!

The whole family loved this!  I halved the recipe and refrigerated the pudding/sour cream/milk/whipped topping mixture for a few hours before serving.  I topped with bananas and mini nilla wafers just before serving.  It was a hit!

This is without a doubt the easiest and best no hassle Banana Pudding recipe I have ever come across.  This didn't last 24 hours in our house and there are only 2 of us.  I used skim milk and light sour cream and Creamy Cool Whip  (I did use 6 bananas instead of just 4 - we love them!)  - I put it in a 2 quart corningware dish - spread some pudding in the bottom and then layered MINI Vanilla wafers  then bananas - pudding - mini wafers - bananas - pudding.  It holds together perfect so doesn't look like mush when you plate it.  I will never use another recipe.  If I could give it more stars I would!! This is a perfect recipe as it is!!! THANK YOU OP for this - I will never go back to the stove top for this again!!!! Yummo is all I can say! =)

This is a quick, solid banana pudding recipe.  It is good and I wouldn't mind serving it to other people.  It was very easy to make.  You can also use reduced fat sour cream or whipped cream.  I don't like really sweet desserts, so this is good without being overly sweet.  I'm not sure if it is the best or will be the best I ever have, but it's solid.  UPDATE:  On Day One, I gave this four stars.  Now I'm revising it up to five stars!  It tastes even better on Day Two!!  Actually, it tastes amazing on Day Two!

WOW!

I was raised to believe that banana pudding must hang out in the fridge for at least 24 hours to be worth a darn.  I had a birthday emergency today for a banana pudding fiend however, so I gave this recipe a shot and had very low expectations-I took a little taste after mixing the ingredients and wasn't impressed.  After two hours in the fridge, I served this and WOW WOW WOW was it incredible!!!  The only thing that was wrong is that the cookies were still a tiny bit crunchy but my guests actually said they had never had it this way before but really liked it.  The best part is that it took a ridiculously small amount of time to make.  I am SO glad I found this recipe, right on!!!  Thanks for sharing!

As much as I hate to admit it, my family declared this the best banana pudding I've ever made.  I have always cooked a banana pudding on a hot stove, with no pudding-mix-shortcuts, stirring constantly - thinking that was the only way to make a really good banana pudding.  How wrong I was.  This was delicious.  Much lighter and more refreshing than the thick custard type puddings.  We polished the whole thing off in one sitting and the kids immediately begged me to make another!  Thanks, LeAnne - this is a terrific pudding!

Huge success.  Felt bad about all the fat and calories though.  So I went with fat-free sour cream, light whipping cream, reduced fat vanilla wafers, and stayed with the whole milk.  People loved it!! Became an instant family favorite.

This is my favorite recipe for banana pudding, and it's very hard to beat.  I agree, you should never leave the bananas on top, they turn horribly dark.  Better to seal them off with a layer of pudding or whipped cream and top with crushed cookies.

This is really good. Of course as I was getting ready to make it I realized I didn't have 2 boxes of vanilla pudding. I used one french vanilla and one white chocolate. I also replaced the sour cream with vanilla yogurt since I had some to use up.I used up what wafers I had (less than 1/2 box) and ground up some graham crackers to use with the layers ending with them on top. I also mix my bananas in pudding mix. Good next day too :)

This recipe was pretty good.  I only gave it four stars because unfortunately, it's not as good as Aunt Betty's banana pudding (from this site.)  I tried this one because I didn't have any sweetened condensed milk, which is required for the other recipe.  So it was good, just not as good.

I have made this recipe for very large functions (and have had to bring copies of the recipe with me to pass out).  Even folks who have said they don't like  banana pudding taste it and rave about it once they've heard others talk about how good it is.  Very simple to make -- it's just unbelievable!  I usually do a layer of pudding, layer of cookies, another layer of pudding, layer of cookies, layer of pudding, lots of bananas in the center, and then another layer of pudding, layer of cookies, layer of pudding, layer of cookies and then a layer of pudding.  On the top, I push cookies down the side and then make a beautiful design with the cookies for the top.  Always a hit because people love a lot of cookies.

Absolutely delicious!  Every time I make this recipe it disappears that same day!  Get requests for it all the time.  Used this pudding as a topping on a 9x13 pan cake, WOW, that was gone in no time too.  When using it as a topping just mix in the bananas and I crumbled vanilla wafers as a topping. I highly recommend this pudding recipe! Thanks LeAnne for sharing!

Wonderful recipe!!!  Tasted great and everyone liked it.  The sour cream does make it richer and a more special than just normal banana pudding.  Tasted even better the next day when the flavors blended more and the cookies softened.

Great banana pudding--I actually used 2 boxes of sugar free pudding but kept the other stuff the same. The sugar free pudding boxes have very different ounces on their packages and even the 2 I had were very different. They added up to about 5 ounces though.  I would have added milk if needed but after putting in the sour cream and the whipped topping it was perfect. Everyone loved it.

Very good,easy, just the right amount of banana flavour. I did subtitute astro balkan style yogurt for the sour cream. I use yogurt instead of sour cream, it gives a milder flavour, and from another reviewer, I also stir some lemon juice into the banana slices before using. Family loves this recipe.

Fantastic and so easy! I used almond milk and it came out great, too. Next time, I'll use 5 bananas because I had more pudding mixture and cookies left over.

I was about to make banana pudding dessert because I had some Nilla wafers and remember my husband said he liked it. Not sure why but I asked him how, and he said just mash up cookies add pudding and bananas.....ugh. I found this and WOW, it is to die for. So easy, made it in under 10 mins. Used banana pudding bacause that's what I had. Great one thanks!
*QUICK TIP*.....A reviewer mentioned that the filling was watery prior to filling. Because it's instant pudding, throw it in the fridge for just a few minutes and it thickens right up to perfect consistency

O M G this was so heavenly & sublime! my husband could not stop coohing & aaahing!
i used sugar free vanilla pudding, skim milk, & light cool whip. (but regular sour cream) however, i skipped the cookies. & i didnt layer. what i did was chop up 2 bananas & mixed it in the batch. i then bought mini graham cracker crusts for little tarts. i brushed those w/egg whites & baked for 5 mins @ 375. when those cooled, i heaped a mountain of this pudding mix & topped it w/ chopped walnuts & sliced bananas. im sorry, but the cookies seemed too much! the pudding mixture, though, is brought to another level w/the sour cream.... very fancy !

I used 1/4 of the the sour cream that the recipe called for.  I also used mini wafers instead.  It turned out great.  I also squeezed fresh lemon juice on the bananas as I layered them to avoid browning.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  Not too sweet, either.  I used 2% milk and it worked just fine.  I added a little extra whip to the top of my pudding; would be great either way!  Thanks for the recipe!

I substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream and increased the pudding mix to 2 (3.5 oz.) boxes since that's what I had on hand. Turned out great, especially after soaking for the night. The flavors seemed to meld together more.

Have made this twice.  The first time - exactly as described, the second time was the "low fat" version -light sour cream, skim milk, light cool whip.  While the low fat version is very good, the REAL (full fat, full flavor) original recipe, is so much thicker and tastier.  If you don't try it at least once as submitted you are cheating yourself out of a real treat!  Also, had to add that I served this at a family gathering of 19+ people (dbl recipe) and EVERYONE loved it more than my mom's traditional baked banana pudding.

Huzzah!  Doubled the recipe as well to fill my punch/trifle bowl! My two cents: use the mini wafers! They are similar in size to banana slices and keep it even looking for presentation. Also, I saved my 16 oz sour cream container to help portion perfectly even layers. With a double batch, fill your 16 oz sour cream container to the brim each time for 5 even layers.

Fantastic dessert! It even beat out our 15-year-old quickest-disappearing July 4th dessert. I've made this recipe as listed above and a much healthier version. Here's what I recommend to get the most nutritious and best tasting dessert you've ever had:  1. The best substitution for sour cream is nonfat plain greek yogurt or regular yogurt, but nonfat sour cream works fine too. 2. Nonfat frozen whipped topping. 3. 2 small boxes of nonfat (and sugar-free if desired) instant vanilla pudding mix. 4. Skim milk instead of whole milk. 5. Ginger snaps instead of vanilla wafers (this is the best part by far!). 6. I mix in 1/3 cup peanut butter (low or no salted variety if using natural peanut butter) with the first ingredients.  That being said - I recommend mixing all the ingredients mentioned in the beginning and adding the pudding mix last. It makes a lot of pudding but not quite enough to use the 4 bananas and the whole box of cookies, but this all depends on the size of your dish I suppose. I usually use 2-3 bananas and half of a box of ginger snaps (which is perfect to make a second batch). Let the dish sit in the fridge for at least 8 hours or overnight. The ginger snaps turn into like a crystallized ginger sugar, they're unbelievable! Enjoy!

Wow!  This is the best uncooked banana pudding that I have tried.  Okay, I did alter it a bit.  First, I don't like slimy bananas in my pudding, so I didn't use them.  Instead, I substituted banana cream instant pudding for the vanilla pudding.  I like this recipe because it calls for sour cream instead of sweetened condensed milk like most of the others on this site.  The sour cream is much better!  I have tried both and the pudding is definitely sweet enough without the sweetened codensed milk and the sour cream enhances the flavors.  I took this to work and it everyone wanted the recipe.  It is a definite keeper and I can stop looking for the perfect banana pudding recipe.

Very good! I have already made this twice!! The second time, I added a tsp of vanilla extract for flavor. I believe when I make it next, I will decrease the cool whip. Excellent and it has become a family favorite already!! Thank you for the great recipe!

This recipe is so fast and easy, on top of being delicious. I made it low fat by using sugar free pudding, skim milk, lite sour cream and lite cool whip, and it was still so rich.
   I've made it twice, and it's def. a keeper!!!

This was a hit with the whole clan. Very easy and I also recommend to make it early in the day if serving at night or making the day before to let the cookies soften.

This is really good, old-fashioned comfort food.  It's so tasty served cold on a summer afternoon!  My husband couldn't stop eating it! It is fast and oh so simple. I used light dairy products and it turned out just fine.  We will make again.

I'm a single man who has just entered the world of cooking.  I love banana pudding and my mom still bakes the best(however it is the cooked version, no instant pudding). This recipe however was excellent, especially since it required no cooking on my part. When even a non experienced cook, can make it and get rave reviews, that tells you something about a great recipe. I did like the one comment that was posted. I suggest that you do save some ot the topping to cover the banana's like one reviewer suggested. This is especially true, if you don't eat it all quickly, the bananas on top tend to brown the next day. The pudding actually tasted better to m e on the second day, than the first. I would highly recommend it. Now I can look Genius at those covered dish outings and no one will know my true secret, unless they ask of course.

Absolutely delicious! Ate some the first day and thought it might be a little too sweet, but apparently all it needed was a night in the fridge for the ingredients to "marry". Smooth, creamy, just wonderful! Thanks for a great recipe.

my entire family of picky eaters loved this pudding.  i used two small boxes of great value banana cream pudding mix and a little extra whipped topping and sour cream  and milk to account for the increased pudding (7 oz in two small boxes versus 5.1 oz in one large box).  it was amazing, definitely a keeper.

This was terrific. My boyfriend isn't interested in dessert unless it's chocolate. He tried this and stated it was the best non-chocolate dessert ever and insisted I make it for all family gatherings. I used fat free sour cream and lite cool whip and mashed up the wafers, otherwise followed the recipe. Also, I'm a notoriously bad cook and I almost never even attempt baking so to have a recipe like this in my arsenal is great.

This is just like my mother's sour cream banana pudding.  Wonderful, we always have a copy of the recipe for any party we take it to.  One tip, it is much easier if you mix the milk and pudding well first then fold in the sour cream and thawed cool whip.  That way you can make sure all of the pudding mix is well dissolved.  Also the crumbled cookies on the top looks very nice.

I was craving banana pudding, but was not willing to make it from "scratch" like my mom always did.  This recipe is awesome! I did not use 5 oz of pudding mix, I used 2 oz and it was still very thick.  I took it to work the next day and everyone asked me for the recipe.  It was so good.  I will make this again and again.

I have been making this banana pudding for years. People always ask me to make it for special events we attend. It is really light and the perfect dessert for a hot day. It can also be made using fat free sour cream, fat free whipped topping, skim milk, sugar free pudding and fat free vanilla wafers. It still tastes just as great. It is best to make and refrigerate for a few hours before serving.

Loved this pudding.  It was great tasting, but not overly sweet.  I crushed the cookies for the topping just like previous reviewers.

i followed all the directions. it came out ok but not as fantastic as the reviews say. i guess for an uncooked pudding this is pretty good, but in comparison to baked it isn't really.

I really like this recipe.  It was easy to make, great if you have small children who want to help out too.  My 6 yr old son helped me and had a blast.  The only thing I changed was I didn't put the whole cookies on the very top, I crushed them and sprinkled them on the top layer.  Great recipe too if you need to bring a dish somewhere, quick, easy to make and to carry to a desination.  I will make this again without a doubt.

Very yummy. I made it as a pie w/ graham cracker crust and layered it with pudding on the bottom, bananas, pudding and then I crushed some graham crackers on top and refridgerated it. It was very soupy but what the heck, more fun to eat! :)

I bought a 3.5 oz box of vanilla pudding instead of 5.  I had to doctor it up but it still came out so good.  I've made this a few times and it is so good.  It's a quick easy banana pudding.  Thanks!

Got rave reviews from my neighbor (the ppl I made it for) and the pudding mixture was even good to me and I detest banana pudding! Next time, I'll add strawberries as a layer or change things up and use chocolate pudding, chocolate cool whip and rasberries!

I'm giving this 5 stars for two reasons.  First, I chose this particular banana pudding recipe not for the convenience or time involved, but for the ingredients.  One of my favorite snacks ever is a sliced baaana mixed with a bit of sour cream, so I thought I would definitely enjoy this, as sour cream was not an ingredient I came across in other recipes. As far as flavor goes, it absolutely did not disappoint. I'm sure the fact I used homemade vanilla wafers helped.  The second reason was because I had mixed all the pudding ingredients together when I realized I needed two boxes of pudding, not one, and it was too thin.  Unable to get another at the time, and not wanting to waste what I had, I poured the whole thing into a saucepan, added some extra sugar and milk, dissolved some cornstarch in some water, brought the whole mess to a boil while stirring, added in the cornstarch and let it bubble until thickened, threw in a pat of butter and some vanilla and let that chill in the fridge for about 1/2 hour before assembling the pudding.  Although the volume of pudding was a lot smaller because the whipped topping lost its whip, and it needs more pudding in ratio for the other ingredients, it still came out tasting wonderful.  Any recipe that can be that botched and still come out great deserves 5 stars in my book!  I'm looking forward to trying this again as written.

The recipe was easy and rich-tasting. I made the mistake of placing sliced bananas on the very top and they started to turn brown in just 2 hours in the fridge. I did have it covered in the fridge. Fortunately we had it that night for dessert.

This was a wonderful recipe! I'm not used to making the pudding with the whipped cream mixed into to the pudding but it tasted wonderful! A few changes, I used two boxes of vanilla pudding and crushed some wafers in a ziplock bag and spread those on top of the mixture to make it pretty and also the pie got an even taste of bread crumbs. Definitely a keeper!

Good because it wasn't too sweet like other banana pudding recipes that call for condensed milk. This was so much better than those.

Not only is this dish requested at EVERY family function but my friends often ask for it as their birthday and/or holiday gift.  I sometimes substitute "100-calorie" Lorna Doones and if on hand, use French Vanilla creamer in place of 1/2 of the milk called for.

the only thing i did different was i ended up only using 1 cup of milk, since the bowl i was using to make the pudding ended up being 1 cup too small. it actually turned out perfect for me though, i like mine really thick and creamy... it was delicious!

This is DELICIOUS!!!  I used Mini Nilla Wafers for 2 layers and on the final layer I crushed them on top of the last layer of bananas.  I just made this for the second time in a week tonight!  Soooo good!  The only thing I might change next time is dip the banana slices in lemon to keep them from browning.  But that's just for aesthetic purposes.... it tastes SO GOOD!  Thanks!  :)

It's better after it sits awhile to soften the wafers.

Awesome recipe. Great for potlucks or anytime a quick dessert is in need. Not quite the classic custard style banana pudding I was looking for, but pleasantly surprised. Next time I will reduce the whipped topping. I am also going to try this as a pie filling. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for my son who just returned from Afghanistan.  All of his AF buddies came over and they couldn't get enough.  I ended up making 3 batches. It is so easy and the best banana pudding I've ever eaten.

You will never cook another banana pudding recipe after you have tried this one!  Perfect texture, delicious taste, and 100% easy!  I use the extra creamy cool whip, light sour cream, and mini-Nilla wafers and it is so dreamy!  Very highly recommended - people will be oooing and ahhing the night away!

This did not taste like something I threw together in a just a few minutes.  I was apprehensive about the sour cream, but this was so good, and even better the next day after the cookies softened up.

wow, this recipe was quick, easy and delicious. We ran out of Nilla cookies so I crumbled some pecan shortbreads on top and put the pudding in a graham cracker crust. It got a double thumbs up by my hubby.  Even my one year old loved it!

This was very easy and very good. I didn't mix in the bananas or the cookies and instead let everyone put together their own parfaits. Not quite a 5 star dessert, but if you're looking for quick and easy you can't lose!

How could something so easy be worthy of serving to your mosp special guests??  The best part is I substituted the low fat versions for everything I could:  the cool whip, the milk, the sour cream and the the vanilla wafers....and it was still AMAZING.  My husband, who is a confirmed "dessert addict" declared it to be the best dessert EVER!!!  One extra tip, when ready to serve I scooped it into glass wine goblets.  Very pretty presentation!!!  Thank you for a recipe that is a "can't miss".

The cookies tend to make it dry. I just put one layer of cookies on the bottom and up on the sides sorta like a crust. I also put in more bananas and make sure they care covered with pudding or topping. I sprinkle crushed nuts or almonds and a little shaved chocolate on the top.

Wow!  Really easy and delicious!  The only modification I made was to use the mini Nilla wafers (which really isn't a modification) because that's all I had.  This dessert was nice to look at (I made it in a pretty glass trifle bowl) and delicious.  My 6 year old son had thirds.  Don't change a thing.

I never would have thought sour cream and whipped topping would make this so good, but it's a thick and creamy pudding.  Easy to overeat, so be careful! :)

I adore this recipe. I've made it many times exactly as it was written and with low fat/no fat substitutes. It always turns out well.  I second the idea that the pudding has much more banana flavor if you let the desert set in the refrigerator overnight.

I made a mistake and followed the recipe to a T.  It says a 5 oz box of Vanilla pudding mix, so I added 3 1.5 oz boxes. It was WAY too thick. I think one 1.5 oz box would have been perfect.

This is absolutely fabulous.  I had reservations, and my husband thought it tasted too much like cake batter (since when is that a bad thing?), but all my fears and reservations were completely unfounded.  And by the second day, it didn't taste like cake batter at all.  I was surprised at how much of the banana flavor it really took on.  Also, I made this with entirely fat free ingredients (except the cookies - just reduced fat) and no one noticed.  So it was that much more fabulous for being so guilt-free! But, as others have mentioned, most definitely cover those bananas!  Rearrange the layering and top with crushed cookies instead.

This dessert was delicious!  I trimmed some fat from the recipe by using Sugar-Free Pudding and Fat Free Sour Cream.  The entire family loved it.  In fact, when I was giving a small amount to our son as he was heading back to college, Hubby started whining that HE wanted the rest for a snack later.  Sheesh....  This is a keeper - so easy & good!

was making a "fresh strawberry cake" (also on this site and delicious) and mess up my cool whip icing (also on this site).  anyway, i had already used the vanilla pudding and milk and cool whip (which was where i messed up the icing.  anyway, i looked up banana pudding and needed to use some sour cream up.  i had made 2 other ones from here that were very good, but my son and husband agreed, this is the best. i also forgot it was in the frig. until 2 or 3 days later and it was as good as it was when i made it. very quick and easy and good for a save when you mess up. :-)
 thanks.

This is a very fast, but rich-tasting dessert.  The mixture of ingredients for the pudding makes it a cut above the usual banana pudding.

This is my go-to recipe for banana pudding. My family loves it, and I always get rave reviews when I take it for potlucks. The only changes I make are to use French vanilla instant pudding for a richer flavor, and then I top it with another 8 oz. container of Cool Whip and crush the remaining vanilla wafers in the box to garnish on the top.

Oh my goodness! After reading the reviews & knowing I hate runny pudding I used a 5oz vanilla pudding & a 3.5oz cheese cake - made whipped topping then used 3c of that - mixed everything on,y using 1c milk - whipped that then waited 5 min for it to thicken - it was too thick so I added 1/2c more of the milk - I love this!! It's not too sweet it's just perfect the sour cream made this!!!!!! Thank you for sharing

SO easy and SO yummy! I did crumble the vanilla wafers for a bottom and top crust.  

I also put a very tiny layer of the pudding mixture over all of the banana slices on top to keep them from browning and this worked very well!

I really enjoyed this pudding!  I don't like cool whip so I whipped whip cream until thick with powdered sugar.  Then I added to allready mixed pudding, then I added the sour cream.  I did the rest as it stated.  It was very good! My whole family liked it!

Super easy and delicious. My boys asked me to leave out the bananas next time. That's fine, as it will make the dish even easier!:-) Definitely a keeper!!

This is a good easy recipe, and tastes great. I have also doubled it for a family gathering this past Mother's Day, but because I was running low on whole milk, I substituted heavy whipping cream for the milk. The result was a delicious, rich dessert which one of my daughters described as "almost like banana pudding cheesecake." I plan to use this recipe later this summer for an event I am planning for about 120 people.

This has become my favorite recipe. Quick and easy, thick and rich! Delicious! I've made this so many times, and now my 9 year old son makes it. We bring this to my son's events and people are always impressed that he makes this by himself. It is always a hit. Super simple and you can make it look fantastic by crushing some Nilla wafers and throwing them on top. We can usually stretch this to a 9x13 casserole dish with careful distribution of cookies and bananas. (lots of em) lol

I'm from the south and banana pudding is a staple at all get togethers. This is by far the best I have had. So simple to throw together. The only change I make is using banana cream pudding mix in place of vanilla. Sprinkle cookie crumbs on top and you have a winner!

This is the best Banana pudding I have ever had. The only this I changes was I added 1/2 package of softend cream cheese and cut the sour cream in 1/2. 100% top notch pudding. I have so many request to make this again. Everyone loved it.

I give this 4stars instead of 5 just because I thought this was a little rich. Very Good if you have a sweet tooth but, its not as light as the bananna pudding I grew up on. Very convienant and easy to make. I also mixed the banannas into the pudding then layered the pudding mix with the cookies.

Do not be afraid of the sour cream! It is so good. not too sweet like some can be. I used light sour cream and skim milk. Was not too soupy like others turned out. I started with a thin layer of pudding then the cookies so that they would soak up the goodness faster.

I got the exact recipe from a coworker when she bought the pudding to work. Everybody loved it and emptied the bowl in a flash. I had been making them ever since, to bring to various potluck or to any gathering in my house and it was always a hit. I tried other recipe but this is the best so far.

I made this a little more healthy by using only low-fat/non-fat ingredients (mostly low-fat).  No one could tell, not even the "dessert snobs"!  I got it down to 3 - 4 points per serving.

Good, but I don't think I will be making again. I didn't think the pudding mixture tasted much like pudding which is what I like best about banana pudding. I agree with other reviewers that it tastes similar to cake batter. Now cake batter is yummy but I wanted banana pudding! I think the cool whip, pudding mixture would probably taste yummy on top in a smaller quantity.

I rated this recipe five stars in 2008 and have made it many times-always a hit. This time I had a bunch of raspberries to use and was tired of shortcake. I subbed purchased pound cake for the vanilla wafers and used slightly sweetened fresh raspberries for the bananas. After making the pudding mixture, I layered it all in my trifle bowl. Beautiful and delicious. Whoever figured out that whipped topping/sour cream/pudding/milk combination is my new best friend.

Much better than the "traditional" banana pudding cooked on the stove. This is smoother and creamier and has a much better taste.  My husband prefers this over the traditional banana pudding and he used to refuse to eat anything but traditional style.

LOVED, LOVED, THIS PUDDING. THE ONLY THING I CHANGED WAS TO USE INSTANT BANANA PUDDING INSTEAD OF THE VANILLA PUDDING & ONLY 1 CUP OF MILK INSTEAD OF 2 CUPS. I ALSO LIKE TO USE MORE BANANAS THAN CALLED FOR. I MAKE THIS A LEAST TWICE A MONTH. THANKS FOR A GREAT PUDDING.

Love it! Try making it with ginger snaps for a little variety. But it is simple, quick & perfect just the way it is. I mix the pudding and milk together first before adding the remaining ingredients.

This recipe was very easy and so delicious!I used lemony flavored animal crackers (keebler or shoprite brand is good)instead of wafers and it added a little more zing to the overall flavor. My whole family enjoyed it! I will definitely make it again!

Wonderful!  My husband is so hard to please when it comes to banana pudding, although he says he loves it.  When he ate this recipe, he was in love!  This will be a regular at my house.  Thanks!

I used advice from others and made with reduced fat ingredients (sour cream, sugar free pudding, and 1% milk).  This was excellent.  I served during Memorial Day family get together.  Several of my family members have serious health issues, and have to limit sugars and fats.  This was a big hit, and there were no leftovers.

This is wonderful!  I use lite sour cream, lite cool whip, 1% milk, fat-free/sugar free pudding, and 1/3 the amount of low-fat vanilla wafers.  I've made it for two big family dinners now.  I always make a double batch, and it still disappears.

LOVE IT!  When I make this for home, I leave the bananas out and cut them on top fresh when I serve after dinner.  It keeps them from turning brown when the pudding is stored in the frige.

I used this recipe, however I added a couple of things that made it GREAT! I added strawberries & cream chesse (whipped). I used fat free whipping cream, fat free sour cream, reduced fat vanilla wafers and 1 cup of 2% milk. after letting it sit in the fridge for a couple of hrs, it was great. Everyone loved it. Will definatley eat again. It's ALMOST guilt free.

I was looking for something quick and yummy to make at the last minute.  This pudding did the trick.  I don't think it was overly rich and it's even better the next day.

This was very easy to make and tasted so good. I made it the day before so the flavors would have more time to meld. It turned out very light, creamy, and banana-y. I used lite cool whip, light sour cream, and 1% milk, and the pudding mix wasn't soupy at all. Since there are only 4 people in my family, I halved the recipe except for the pudding part and used the leftover pudding mix as filling for crepes.

This recipe was very good.  My husband will not tolerate sour cream in anything....even if you can not taste it.  I substituted an extra tub of cool whip for the sour cream and it was still excellent.  Very tasty and very easy! Thanks!

My family loves this Banana Pudding and is always requested when it is my turn to make deserts. A bit of vanilla extract is the only change, but it is great even without it.

In response the the previous post, I think the moist, cake-like cookies are the best part!  Usually I like to eat bananas that are still a bit green so this is a great way to use those bananas when they're a little too ripe for my taste.  The ripeness gives the pudding a nice, mellow banana flavor without tartness. I was leery of using the sour cream, but it turned out great.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla.  This is as close as I'm ever going to come to my very southern Nana's homemade banana pudding (but I think I might like this better!).  The best part about this recipe?  Tastes even better after a night in the fridge.

Easy to make and delicious to eat.  This is how I layered mine: wafers, pudding, bananas, repeat a second time, top with whipped cream and sprinkle crushed wafers on top of that.  Let sit overnight in fridge.

This was out of the world!  After it's chilled for a while, the wafers become a cake-like consistency in between the pudding.  Delicious!

Wow! What a great recipe. I made this at my work's last pot-luck and I didn't even get to eat any because it was gone in less than an hour. Now I'm making one for our St.Patrick's Day pot-luck, except I'm adding a few drops of green food coloring to the pudding to fit the occasion. Easy to make, delicious to eat, doesn't get any better than this! Thanks for sharing the great recipe!

What a great idea to put the sour cream in!  Makes a LOT of pudding filling, but thats okay.  I did save about 1 cup of the whipped topping to spread over the top over the last layer of bananas to prevent them browning.  Also added about a teaspoon of vanilla extract into pudding just to make the flavor a little more intense.  This will be be my banana pudding recipe now!

Big hit with my family. To cut calories I used fat free everything (2 pkg of fat free-sugar free pudding mix it wasn't thinking fast enough)  and 1% milk. Still came out wonderful.

Banana pudding has always been one of my favorite desserts.  This recipe does not disappoint.  I think I have found my lifetime recipe.  I used all fat-free products (sour cream, Cool-Whip, and milk), and I also used the 11oz. box of low fat wafer.  Still very good and not chemically at all.

I think this is a great recipe.  It makes so much!  I use low fat Cool Whip, low fat sour cream and 2% milk, and no one knows the difference or misses the fat.  I slice my bananas on the diagonal to get a longer, prettier slice.  It's delicious.  I usually crumble up some extra vanilla wafers on top right before serving for an extra added touch and crunch.  I've made this many times, even for company who are delighted with banana pudding for dessert -- a fun dessert for a change.

this is an uber-easy recipe to make.  i made it for my boyfriend and every time i fly down to visit, his roommates ask me to make "my" banana pudding.  it's absolutely fabulous!  i too made it with "lite" ingredients and it turned out fine and everyone ate more because they didn't feel at all guilty.  the wafer cookies aren't needed in my opinion, but they do add texture.  by the next day they tend to get soggy.

The flavor of the finished product was okay but not significantly better than simply adding 3 cups of milk as my 1.5 oz box directed.  I won't make this version again.

Everyone loves this banana pudding! For me, it is best to whisk the pudding mix and milk, then whisk in the sour cream, and then fold in the cool whip. I do use light ingredients and no one has noticed a difference.

AMAZING. So yummy. I love the sour cream in this, it gives it a little tang. I also tossed my banana slices with lemon juice to keep them from browning. I was worried they would taste sour, but they were good. I layered all ingredients in a trifle bowl, and had extra whipped topping so I layered that in too, and on top. Sprinkled nutmeg on top too. Let it sit for a couple of hours in the fridge and the cookies were perfect, mostly soft but still a little crunchy. Thank you for such a great recipe! Way better than making tons of banana bread to use up all my bananas!

OMG this banana pudding taste amazing! its rich and creamy. The only thing i did different was that i added 1 and a half cups of Lactaid milk (because my daughter is Loctose Intolerant, so the less lactose the better) as oppose to the 2 cups of whole milk that the recipe called for. This recipe was perfect not too sweet just right!!!Thanx for sharing

amazing! we love it and everytime i make it for a crowd i always get asked for the recipe! i made it exactly how its written, except took the suggestion to use French vanilla pudding instead of regular vanilla and it was awesome!! i tried it with the chessman cookies and we all like the Nillas better. the chessman cookies were good but too buttery and hard. it was better the second day after the cookies softened in the pudding but who wants to wait an extra day for their pudding! :)

Made today, but couldnt resist to add my Mex flair to it and added vanilla, cocunut milk instead of milk and cinnamon. My whole life I have tasted not quite pudding in southern bbq joints in Calif, but never quite tasted like my "adopted" grandpa from Louisiana made for me as a child. I was always so intimidated be/c it seemed complicated but this recipe was easy and spot on.  DELICIOUS!

The flavor was great but very thick, 5 oz of pudding is 5 small boxes!  So I'll try just 3 boxes and/or add more milk next time.  It was all eaten up!

Thank you thank you for posting this recipe. I had this from a friend on my computer and lost my hard drive that it was on. I love this banana pudding and I always get rave reviews when I serve it.

Loved this! Not your typical banana pudding, in my opinion, it is MUCH better. Very light/fluffy and not as sweet. I really like the difference the sour cream made.. Excellent!! I made it the night before and it was wonderful the next day. I did however crumble the wafers on top instead as I did't want the whole wafers to be mushy. This will definitely be my BP recipe from now on. Thanks!

I would give this 10 stars if I could...And I'm not even a banana fan.It was Delish!! I didn't have a 5oz. box of vanilla so I used 1 sm. box of vanilla and 1 sm. box of banana creme. My DH who is the pickiest person I know loved this. It wasn't to sweet like my previous recipe. It was thick and so creamy.... Thanks So Much LeAnne

Couldn't be easier - and couldn't be more delicious.  It was a huge hit at a dinner party last week, and I'm making it for the big game today.  As soon as it's mixed, it's done!

This recipe is okay, nothing special though. It's not like traditional banana pudding, hubby and I both prefer vanilla pudding and cool whip NOT mixed together.

My husband is a banana pudding fanatic.  He always wants it for his birthday instead of a cake.  He has always insisted on "cooked" banana pudding, but I was running late and decided to try this one.  He raved about it and called it the best banana pudding he has ever tasted!

This is great!  Mmmmmmm, comfort food!  I did substitute real whipped cream (it is so easy to make).  Also, as I only had an 8-oz box of vanilla wafer cookies, I dug around in my cupboard and found some Annie's Graham Bunnies (like little mini graham crackers shaped like bunnies).  I had them dancing all over the top.  Cute.

Oh my Gosh!!!  This recipe is soooo good!  The first time I made this my friend and I ate the whole bowl in one night.  Seriously, it is incredibly easy and the result is delicious.  I'm made it again for a friends birthday which is tomorrow, but I did lick the mixing bowl clean tonight. I used skim milk both times, but I've used light and regular sour cream and I can't tell the differance. Try this recipe---you WILL love it!

I don't usually make recipes with instant pudding and cool whip but given all the great reviews, I tried this. It was good, but I like the kind made with the cooked custard better. I also like banana pudding best while it's still warm.

This is the next best thing to the cooked version. I used free/low fat and sugar free indg. when I could. I also crushed the cookies because they don't get soft because a hot pudding mixture isn't used. A really great tasting pudding.

This was GREAT! I used 1% milk and lite sour cream and it was still smoothe and creamy. My husband said it was the best banana pudding he'd ever had and went back for seconds! YUM!!!

The filling is too heavy and thick, not like real pudding or custard.  Otherwise, it taste good.

I gave it 4 and not 5 stars because immediately upon tasting it my family loved it, but once we continued eating it we noticed it was too rich. So rich to the point that no one finished their bowl even though they loved the taste.

Excellent pudding!!! I forgot to get vanilla wafers, but had a bag of mini Milano cookies. The little bit of chocolate was a nice touch and it was still great.  This should get another star for the ease of preparation. Will definitely be making this again.

this is great!  but i got all nonfat or reduced fat ingredients: whipped cream, sour cream, wafers and milk.  it was still wonderful, not as heavy (which was good b/c my stomache can't handle anything too heavy on dairy products).

How many yum, yum, yums can I give this?!  It was so easy and so very good.  I also love those soggy wafers in the whole mix.  I did end up with the pudding mixture on top so the bananas kept their color.  I also used non-fat milk and light cool whip.  Thanks for sharing LeAnne!

This was an extremely easy and good recipe.  My family, however, doesn't care for the taste of soggy cookies.  The next time I make it I will combine the pudding and bananas and chill it.  Then I'll layer it with coarsely chopped cookies just before serving.

This recipe was so easy and had a really rich, creamy taste. One suggestion if you like your cookies softer, make it a day ahead because they softened up and it was even better.

Excellent recipe. I was hesitant to try this, but was extremely impressed!!!! For those people who rated it 1 or 2 stars...you are nothing but silly. This was a fantastic recipe that was so simple; yet didn't taste "simple." 

Thanks so much!

This is the same recipe that I use to make banana pudding. However I like to layer it with waffers then the sliced banana until it gets to the top of the dish. I then pour the mixture completly over it. I crumble a few waffers on top for presentation then cover it with plastic. I then let it sit for several hours or over night. The waffers are much softer and and it is almost cake like when you eat it.

Kids just loved this! Great dessert on a hot summer day. The only thing that I would do different next time is, I would break the cookies up first and sprinkle them  in place, instead of placing them whole (Use the whole box of vanilla wafers) Otherwise don't change a thing! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Very tasty, but not quite as wow as I expected.  Unfortunately, not a big eat at the party I served this at, and so I had lots of left overs, so maybe I just got sick of the left overs.  Would have preferred more pudding than wafers.

This is delicious.  It is almost identical to my mom's (she doubles the whopped topping, pudding mix and milk.) We had this at every holiday dinner growing up and now I make it randomly for my son and I. I really enjoy not having to bake it!

Love this recipe! So easy and tasty for the little amount of work it takes. I used French Camilla pudding and didn’t use the complete 8oz of sour cream. Crumbled wafers on top.

The problem was w putting it together; I made the pudding and followed the rest of the ingredients. When I added the milk it got real liquidity. Not thinking the milk was to be used for the pudding instead of making the pudding first. So I’m trying the recipe I will try again and let u know

My coworkers loved this recipe! I used banana creme pudding instead of vanilla and couldn't tell it had sour cream in it.

This is the BEST! Anytime we are invited anywhere or we have  people over, the number one request is for this pudding. When going to outings with large crowds, people always tell me they've heard about my fantastic banana pudding and can't wait to try it. I usually end up making a double batch.....  I've never come home with leftovers!

I followed this exactly as instructed.  Personally, I thought the sour cream overpowered it - that’s the primary taste in this recipe.  I didn’t mind that it wasn’t as sweet as some other recipes but seems like it needs something to offset the sour cream.

This was a wonderful and easy recipe! I tried the pudding while making it and it tasted very "sour creamy". However, after letting it set in the fridge for a few hours the flavors incorporated into each other and the final product was perfect. this will be my go to recipe from now on as my other recipe is too labor intensive. I literally whipped this up in less than 10 minutes!

I have been using this recipe for YEARS now and everyone loves it I always have to make a lot. I just usually go with it by taste. If you are making a lot buy 4 containers of cool whip, use almost the whole 16 oz of sour cream, use a splatter (not a lot) of vanilla extract, use one and a half of French vanilla instant pudding mix, only use a half cup of milk, Use 5 bananas, only use 3 bags of Pepperidge Farm Chessman cookies because the taste is better. Start off with putting your cookies at the bottom. And just start layering cookies, pudding, bananas, and repeat. When you are done, crumble some cookies for the top. And then you are done. I hope this helps.

Made this for a pot luck...  rave reviews.  Everyone  loved it.  Super easy to put together.  I used my stand mixer and real whipping cream, Stevia & vanilla rather than cool whip.  It was really fluffy and light.  It a keeper.

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was really good.  I thought it strange to use sour cream and whipped cream.  I don't think that anymore.  I have made banana pudding from scratch and this is much easier and you cannot tell the difference.  I will definitely be making this one again!!  First, I whipped up the pudding, then added the sour cream, then folded in the whipped cream.  That way, all ingredients were mixed in very well.  It was SO good!!

I added an extra layer of  whipped cream to the top and added miniature  vanilla wafers on top of that.  Made it tall but very light, every one loved it.   I liked the uncooked recipe better than cooked versions due to its less sweet and more creamier and lighter.

This turned out fabulous!  I used 8 oz of Fage 2% Greek yougert in place of the sour cream and sugar free vanilla pudding.  I also used Pepperidge Farm Chessmen cookies that someone suggested.   I put it in a 8x8 square pyrex dish and sprinkled chopped walnuts on top.  Everyone loved it!

I made this to Bring a dessert to our local police station.  I made a double batch and they cleaned it out.  Some of the officers served dessert first then went back for their entree!

this is really good because it is not too sweet. I have made it with condensed milk and while that is also really good it is way too sweet for my tastes.  Unfortunately, I only had the smaller box of pudding and I didn't realize it until I mixed everything so the pudding is more like a sauce topping but oh so delicious.  I would make it again and adjust the ingredients accordingly.

Very tasty. I doubled it, which filled 2 3-quart dishes. Having read the reviews that were skeptical of the sour cream, I substituted plain Greek yogurt. Final dish was light, flavorful, and scarfed up by everyone at the potluck. No left overs, and several people couldn't believe it was "assembling, not cooking."

I made this today.  It's very good.  I did cut back on the sour cream.......only used 4 oz., but it turned out great.  I will definitely make again.  I used sugar free pudding, low fat cool whip, and low fat sour cream......it was excellent.

Soaked the bananas in lemon juice

This is my go to banana pudding recipe...I did change one thing. I changed the sour cream to cream cheese. I have made this several times. My husband prefers this over any other banana pudding I make, including homemade.

Everyone loved it! One even said, "Hate to say it, but this is better than my Grandma's!".  A few small changes;(2)3.4oz boxes of pudding instead of (1)5.1oz box.  For a thicker pudding I used 1½Cups of milk instead of 2. Also used 5 bananas instead of 4.  On top of each layer of bananas I lightly sprinkled cinnamon sugar.

This tastes great when made with Graham crackers instead of vanilla wafers. Also I used only 3 Tablespoons of sour cream just to give a bit of tangy flavor without over powering it.

I have made this for years and still love it. The only change I make is that I use a bit less sour cream... I find using the entire container makes it a bit too rich.   I also add 1T of vanilla to add a bit of depth.  Both are purely personal - the recipe really is perfect as is!

Banana pudding isn't my favorite dessert, but I was headed to a birthday party and needed something I could prepare quickly. This dish was indeed very easy to make. I made a few small changes:

-sour cream: added 12 oz instead of 8 oz
-milk: used 2% instead of whole

I thought the results were pretty darn delicious. Some who tried the pudding said they thought it was really good; others didn't comment at all so not sure how they felt.

This is the best and easiest banana pudding I have ever made.  My family thought so as well.  It was gone in two days.  A lot of times when I have eaten banana pudding in the past, it is way to sweet.  This is just right.  I made no changes.

I've made this recipe over 1000 times and everybody rants and raves how it's the best banana pudding they've ever had. One secret to it is to made it at least 24 hours prior to serving and you will notice a big difference in the flavor.

LOVED IT!!! My box of pudding from Kroger was slightly bigger but I made it exactly as the recipe stated otherwise. Maybe it was the size of the dish I used, but I couldn't use the whole box of vanilla wafers and I took the suggestion of another person and crumbled some to put on top. Hubby ate two huge portions in minutes and raved about it! No more waiting for pudding to cool down for me now, this is my new go-to recipe!

Excellent. Pleases others every time. Quick and easy to make. Much better without using sweet and condensed milk as I see in other recipes; not too sweet, but just right.

Love this recipe, so simple.  Was a hit at Parent Teacher Conference Dinner.
I made a double batch and changed a few things.
1. I used 1 Extra Creamy Cool whip and 1 Kraft Seasonal delight French Vanilla.
2. I only used about 3 1/2 cups of milk.
3. 1 lite sour cream and 1 regular.
4. I used mini vanilla wafers &Pepperidge Farm Chessmaster cookies. With each layer I used 1/2 of the chess man cookies 1/2 wafers. (My Kroger only had 1 package of chessman cookies)
5. I only used 6 1/2 banana's
I sprinkled crumbs of the chess man cookies&wafers on top.
I had to take dessert in a throw away container so I put it in a 139 pan. There was just enough left over for my 2 kids and hubby to have some (after filling pan).

I guess what type of bowl/pan you use and how you layer it all really decides how much stuff you need. I DOUBLED the recipe and I only needed 1 box of cookies, 5 small bananas, and 3 cups of milk. Also I had about 3/4 of a 16 oz. container of sour cream so I used that and a container of vanilla Greek yogurt. I also added some almond extract. And I would recommend to anyone, whether they wanna make this healthier or not, to use lite whipped topping. It made it so like and fluffy, like a mouse.

I tried this receipe for the first time and it is the best I've tasted so far! I followed suggestions  mentioned except for one thing... I made a mistake and brought cream cheese instead of sour cream. Before  I realized the receipe stated sour cream i had already mixed in cream cheese I even let it get room temperature. When I got ready to incorporate in the the next ingredient  I realized it stated sour cream. Inspite of my mistake you can't tell the difference it turned out delishious!!  Everyone is asking  for the receipe. ??

This recipe is awesome! I have made it several times. I swapped the Nilla wafers for Pecan Sandies last time and it was even better. Definitely a winner.

Love this recipe! It's different than the classic my dad makes where he makes soufflé etc. Have made it several times and the only tweaks I made were I used Pepperidge Farm Chessmen cookies instead of vanilla wafers, I put a teaspoon vanilla flavoring in the pudding mix and sprinkled the top with cinnamon/nutmeg mixture for color and a twist on the flavor. My kids love this recipe.

Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! So easy. Made it for my husband on Father's Day because it is his favorite dessert.  The six of us ate the entire bowl!!!  Everyone had a second serving. I made mixed my pudding with the milk first then added the cool whip (extra creamy) and sour cream.

This was really great tasting for the amount of time it took! Not too sweet and quite light and fluffy. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I am not a huge fan of Nilla wafers- this might be worth trying with a different 'bread' component.

I brought this recipe to our family's Easter party.  It was a hit and there weren't any leftovers.  I made it the night before the party.  I did squeeze lemon juice over the bananas to stop them from browning.

OMG Whenever I take this to a party its gone within 5 mins. I use a 9x13 pan and I use 5 bananas instead of 4... I make the night before and let it sit in the frig to allow the wafers to soften.  Its a very cheap and yummy dessert :)

This recipe was so easy and delicious. Instead of layering the bananas and cookies, though, I everything into the pudding. I put a layer of cookies in the bottom of my bowl, crushed up more cookies and mixed them, along with the banana slices, into the pudding. Then I put more cookies and banana slices on top. My family loved it!

This recipe was very easy to make and tasted delicious.  My only issue was the bananas turning brown...when layered as described, I ended up with a layer of banana on the top which didn't look good and turned brown despite being dipped in a bit of lemon juice.  Even hidden under the last layer of cookies it didn't look good.  I will make this again but try mixing the bananas into the pudding mixture.

This was pretty good. I just made a 1/2 recipe and put it in a smaller bowl and I just used one small box pudding for this amount. I didn't have the recipe with me and accidentally picked up banana cream flavor and it worked fine. I topped it with the extra cool whip. I would consider bringing this to a picnic or potluck and may even try real whipped cream next time. ty

Yes, I do have to agree that this recipie was fas and easy- but definately not worth the 5 star rating.  I thought it had a pretty basic taste, and was slightly dry.

I just made this last night for my family and they really loved it. I did do some changes to it. Since I doubled my recipe, i used 2-5oz. boxes of vanilla pudding, 8oz. of crushed pineapple drained and only used 1 1/2 cups for the recipe, eventhough i doubled it. It is a very RICH dessert, but it is also very good. will continue to keep making it. Thanks

I have made this recipe a few times to rave reviews, especially from my kids!  I always use fat free or light ingredients and it is still delicious. Wonderful summer dessert!

I tried another recipe for uncooked banana pudding, it was good but overwhelmingly rich!! This pudding is excellent!!I will be using this recipe from now on! I can't wait to try it out at the 4th of July party I am hosting for my family and friends!!!This pudding is 100% better than the one that first got me hooked on banana pudding!

I half'd this recipe to serve 4 adults for desert.  It was the perfect amount - just a little left over!  it turned out very good - but i didn't think there was enough banana flavor.  Next time i may try using banana pudding instead of vanilla.  but over all - it was very good!

This is a really delicious recipe.  My experience is that people who don't normally even like banana pudding will devour this recipe.  I used 2% milk which worked well.  Next time I will double the recipe because we licked the bowl clean!

I served this last night to my husband and father-in-law.  I liked it, but neither of them were crazy about it.  I do think it tastes better the next day.  But it is definitely worth making again, especially since it is SO easy.

Awesome Pudding!  SUper easy to make and everyone liked it.  Next time Im going to throw the cookies in the trifle bowl instead of putting a layer at a time.  I thing the overall apprearance of the dessert would have been enhanced had I did that plus by the time the bottom of the bowl comes you have more than just soggie cookies.

I was hesitant to use this when I read that there was sour cream in it. My mom's version didn't have that...but I was in a pinch without her recipe. I went for it and I have to admit, it was the best I've had! My husband and neighbors at our New Year's Eve pot luck loved it. This was VERY easy and VERY good! Thanks LeAnne :o)

This is the best Banana Pudding that I have ever tasted.  I have always used the cook and serve pudding mix that never turned out right.  This recipe is easy to make and the whipped topping melts in your mouth.  This recipe is always requested by friends and family. I've made it at least 20 times.

The best...and very easy.  I wasn't sure about instant pudding.  I usually stick to the cook and serve kind.  Considering the fast that I was looking for a fast dessert, I used the instant pudding.  I wasn't sorry.  The flavors melded and I didn't notice the "chemical" flavor that I usually taste in instant pudding.

I tried this recipe and it was okay, but I'll have to stick to the one passed down in my family.  There's no sour cream for one thing, and instead of vanilla pudding, use Banana pudding, layer it with the cookies and pudding, and refrigerate it overnight.  It's good with or without whipped cream on top.

WOW!  This was great!  I wanted to make banana pudding and bought the vanilla pudding mix and vanilla wafers, and I had bananas on hand.  I didn't realize however that most other recipes call for sweetened condensed milk.  So I was glad to find this recipe and had all I needed to make it.  It was great and will serve it for a party this weekend!

We were disappointed - the reviews were good, but my husband said this tasted like cake batter.  We did leave time for the flavours to "marry". We felt it was not as amazing as the reviews indicated.  We will not make again.
