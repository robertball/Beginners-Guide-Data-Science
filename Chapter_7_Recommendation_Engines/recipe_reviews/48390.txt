This was an Awesome dish.  I added an extra cup of apple juice along with the full pack of liptons onion soup, which created sufficient juices.  Half way through the cooking I added cut potatoes and had a stew.  It was sooooo good my husband had the left overs for breakfast.

My husband just got back from Caribou hunting and I tried this recipe with a shoulder roast. It was WONDERFUL!!!!! I had 2) 3# roasts so I used 2 pkg soup mix and 3 c. apple juice. It was a hit!!!

My crockpot does not have a medium setting which was a major part of the problem with this recipe (in fact, I'm not sure a lot of crock pots have a medium setting!)  So, I started it out on high, but I think it made the moose way too tough.  Next time, I'll just put it on low and let it go for a longer period of time.  The flavor was great, but as mentioned above just too tough.

This was very tasty! On my second and third times preparing this recipe, I substituted the apple juice with apple sauce and water... it turned out amazing! Plus, the apple sauce helps to form a "thicker" gravy-like sauce that doesn't need thickening. This dish paired with horseradish sauce.... Yum!

This recipe is EXCELLENT!  I've made it for company, and everyone raved about it, and fought over second-servings. There were no leftovers.  The gravy can be thickened with cornstarch and is excellent over mashed potatoes  Thanks so much for posting it - it's so easy, but SO delicious!

I don't use apple juice but sounds good.  You might want to add 1 to 4 tblsps of horseradish. It adds a nice zing

I made this for a Christmas party, and no one knew what it was!! surprise surprise!! It was incredible. It was tender and moist and the gravy had such a sensational taste. If I am ever to make it again, I would throw in a little wine and some fresh mushrooms. Absolutely wonderful surprise. It was gone in a flash.......

I was skeptical of how good the moose roast would be with just 4 ingredients, but I made the roast for a church potluck and it was amazing.  It was so tender and tasty!  It tasted wonderful by itself and I was upset that it was gone at the end of the potluck!  So good and ridiculously easy!!!

I tried this recipe for the first time because like many wives, I have a freezer full of moose roasts etc, and no idea what to do with it. The only thing I changed was I added a can of beer in to the slow cooker instead of apple juice or other liquids.  It added a nice flavour and took away alot of the gameiness taste.  I'd seen it done that way on one of the hunting shows my husband watches.  Try it - it was great and my kids loved it too and they had no idea what they were eating!

My fiance went hunting and I ended up with a freezer full of moose and no clue what to do with it since I had never even tasted moose, let alone cook it!  I came across this recipe and thought I would give it a shot. IT WAS FANTASTIC!!! No gamey taste at all and the meat was fall apart tender! My fiance said it was the best moose roast he had ever had!  Quite the compliment coming from a hunter!  I have made this recipe about 4x since and it is totally foolproof!  Wonderful every time and the apple juice with the meat juices makes for a simply scrumptious gravy.  Thank you so much!!

This makes for a moist tasty roast!  I received some moose roasts and was unsure how to cook them so they would stay moist without adding extra fat.... This recipe works great!  I added a single serving apple sauce to the top of the roast to keep moist, and it made a thicker juice.... Will definitely make again!

I added Salt and Pepper to the roast before browning but would also consider adding a touch of Garlic to the mix.

Moose is tricky. If you don't cook it right it turns into a gamey hockey puck, which although quite Canadian, is not particularly appetizing. Slow cooking it is the way to go and the apple addition here was right on. My husband loved it and we've passed it on to his dad who is the moose hunter.

Delicious! I was skeptical of the ingredients, but the roast was amazing. I added two cups of water and an onion, quartered. My Father stocks our freezer with moose each year and we're always looking for different ways to cook it. My husband said this has been his favorite so far. Serve with horseradish and/or hot sauce. Yum!

A friend gave us a moose roast.  We used this recipe and loved it!! 

Only problem, we want to make it again but it is very difficult to find moose roast.  I suppose I'll have to take up hunting.

Oh my goodness! This moose roast is the most delicious and juicy I've ever had! It strings apart it's so tender! I've used both regular apple juice and homemade crab apple juice. Both turned out delicious! I do use two packs of onion soup mix but that depends on your taste. Go for it on this one!

Here's the positive and negatives about this recipe.  

Positive: No gamey taste and you don't need to soak the roast overnight with buttermilk.  Easy to make and only a couple of ingredients.  Can use applesauce and water in lieu of the apple juice which results in a thicker gravy.

Negative:  Nothing special but good.

Overall, I like Slow Cooker Italian Moose Roast Sandwiches more than this recipe.

Loved the flavor of the meat, but the sauce is lacking. It did have somewhat of a gamey taste, which is okay because I like a lot of a flavor in my foods. I like the idea another poster had, where she suggested applesauce and water (Probably a cup of each)poured on top instead of apple juice. Don't pay attention to the medium temp part (Can't imagine very many people have one like that); just use a thermometer. I had a three pound roast, and I went 4 hours on low. I decided it was done with a 150 degree standing temp. It was tender enough to cut with a plastic knife when eating (Hey, give me a break, I live alone.:-)). Only three stars because of the sauce, and the ridiculousness of a medium setting.

While the roast was definitely moist and tender, the apple juice causes the flavor of the meat (and any veggies you may have added into the crock pot) to be far too sweet. The apple juice gravy was the worst part of this meal. Instead of apple juice I would STRONGLY suggest using beer.

My in-laws were coming so I decided to make a moose for supper.  I never made a moose before in my life so I was a little nervous to do it.  I found this recipe and I’m glad I did.  The moose was gone before I could eat it.  I had to eat my children’s leftovers and that’s how I know how good it tasted.  It was a very tender meat.  Do not cook it for 8 hours though.  It’s enough with 6 hours.  That’s what I did and the meat turned our amazing.  Enjoy!!!

Awesome!  So quick and easy. I've never made moose before and was worried but this turned out fantastic. The gravy was alright but I think my husband added something when I wasn't looking (he tends to do that) because he looked guilty and it didn't quite taste as good when I started to make it.  I would highly recommend this recipe and keeping a close eye on your hubby so he doesn't mess up your gravy. Lol

Followed instructions, added some garlic, fresh onions and celery to the pot, while it cooked.  Like one other review.  I did not have a med on my slow cooker.  So I cooked it low for 12 hours.  Turned out awesome.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is a great recipe for those not too familiar with cooking game meats.  I had never cooked moose roast before and had two of them to make for the 12 guests who were coming for dinner! This recipe was simple but very tender and really tasty.  We got excellent reviews from our guests and even though I was sure I'd made way too much food, lots of people had seconds and there was absolutely nothing left over! My husbands only complaint was that we don't have any more moose roasts left in the freezer!

Found a moose roast I had in the freezer for over 6 months and wanted to try something different with it. I did not have the onion soup mix but instead I had a package of beef stew mix. I used half of that and cooked on low for 8 hours. It was very tenderand flavourful.  Will definately make again.

My buddy had a couple of moose roasts so I made this recipe.  It turned out fantastic!  I  added a 1/2 cup of red wine and 3 tsp minced garlic.  In slow cooker for 8 hours on low heat.  Oh, I added 2 Oz of onion soup and covered most of the meat with Apple juice.

I have made this recipe and was very impressed and now I use a variation to personal taste.
-sub pulp free Orange juice (2 cups) for apple juice 
-add 1 1/4 cups Red wine of your choice
-6 garlic cloves ( peeled & halved)
- 3 celery stalks cut into 1/2" slices
-1 large onion of choice coarsely chopped 
- 6  carrots cut & quartered in 2" lengths
1 Knorr onion soup packet
1 Tbsp. hot mustard

Add all non liquid ingredients into slow cooker then add the braised moose roast. 
Pour dried onion soup mix over top of roast
Pour orange juice over roast 
Pour red wine over roast
Then rub top, sides and ends of roast with the hot mustard 
Place cover on cooker and cook on high for 4-6 hours ( to taste and tenderize). 
Optional: with 90 minutes remaining on your cooking time you can add nugget potatoes to cooker.

When done remove roast and let stand a minimum of 10 minutes before carving.  Remove vegetables and potatoes from pot

Remaining liquid can be used as is for dip "Au-jus" or makes an excellent base for a nice thick gravy.

I forgot to put the apple sauce in, but it was absolutely delicious. Will definitely use this again and try it with the apple sauce and a pork roast.

For ease and simplicity, this recipe is great!  I don't have a medium setting on my slow cooker, so cooked a 4.5 lb roast for 2 hours on high, then 4 hours on low.  Very juicy and tender.  I didn't much like the flavour though.  I'm not really fond of game.  My guy, however, loved it.

i do cook a lot of moose. i've done onion soup mix with great sucess and apple juice with great sucess so this should be great. 
i have to state that my favourite so far way is with cola-cola. it's a little bit sweet and fall apart tender(but use canned coke bottle kind dosen't have the same results)

This was a wonderful way to serve up moose for the uninitiated.  Both my family and the family we were entertaining loved it.  We used applesauce instead of juice (all we had on hand), and used the few leftovers to make moose dip the next night. Thanks!

This turned out amazing!  Like another reviewer, I didn’t have apple juice so I used a cup of applesauce with a cup of water.  I browned the roast with sliced onion, and salt and pepper.  I made gravy with the broth, and that made the moose roast spectacular!

We were given a Moose roast by a friend and I had no idea what to do with it. This recipe was so easy and delicious. My roast was only 2 lbs so I cooked on low for 5 hrs, removed the meat and added corn starch to make a thicker gravy, then added meat back in to keep warm. Served with roasted vegetables and mashed potatoes. Definitely recommend.

The apple juice helped the gamie taste of the moose but ruined the gravy. Would not make it again.

What I did was use a packet of McCormicks,seasoning mix and about 1 cup of water and added onion and baby carrots and potatoes, I guess more of a stew, my family loved it.

Thanks for a great recipe!  The moose roast was tender, juicy and had wonderful flavor.
