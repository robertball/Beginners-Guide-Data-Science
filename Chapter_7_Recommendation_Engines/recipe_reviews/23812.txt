I like this a lot!  I cut the recipe in half and it was more than enough for 2 adults and 4 kids.  I assumed the topping would be dumplings but when I mixed according to recipe the "batter" on top was very thin.  At first I thought there was a mistake, but after cooking I could see that the milk, margarine and flour topping is what makes it taste like real pot pie instead of scalloped potatoes.  It is a real satisfying dish.  For the full effect you could put a crust over the top.  Also the recipe does not specify covered or uncovered, I did not cover and it was just right.

I must have done something horribly wrong when I assembled this dish.  Was the batter that is poured on top supposed to be discernible after the dish cames out of the oven?  Even though I don't think I did it exactly correctly, it had a wonderful flavor.  My husband and I agreed that it would make a great homemade chicken soup if I replaced the potatoes with egg noodles and add a bit of cream to hit.  I will do that with the leftovers.  Also, I would also cook my potatoes and carrots a bit as only the smaller pieces were cooked enough.  Thanks for a real comfort food, whetherit be pie or soup.  :-)

The filling was great, but the "crust" was not impressive.  Baking these in individual sized pot pie containers allows the potatoes and carrots to cook.  Probably won't make this again.  If I do, I would use an actual crust.

As is, I would rate 4 stars, however, I can never just make a plain recipe like this. I added red bell pepper, mushrooms, celery, green chilies and 2 cloves of garlic. I cooked it in a large casarole dish for 1 hr. and 15 min. and it was wonderful. Now, I would give it 5 stars.  JS

I hate having to say this, but if I could give this no stars i would. The "crust" was non existent. Still a runny mess after over an hour in the oven and the potatoes were still crunchy. I will never make this again.

Eh. There was nothing great about this. The flavor was okay, but the crust just didn't turn out good at all. I'll stick with a regular crust and my old recipe next time.

I was very disappointed with this dish.  The crust was nothing to write home about, and the instructions should have directed to parboil the potatoes and carrots.  Even in my convection oven, the vegetables were hard as rocks after the full hour and 15 minutes.  It came out as a big soupy mess.  Will search for a better pie recipe!

This is the best chicken pot pie we have ever eaten! I cook ingredients a day ahead, asemble pie and bake a day later! Feeds a crowd. Just wonderful for Sunday dinner!

YUM!  I would have taken a picture to upload, but we couldn't quit eating it long enough to get a picture!  I followed some suggestions from other reviews and put a bisquick crust on top.  I actually made a mistake and forgot the onions, so I put cheddar french fried onions on top.  It was a nice touch.

It tastes great but you have to use a bigger dish than a 3 qt. I will probably split into 3 nine inch pie plates and freeze two for next time. Also the potatoes and carrots must be pre boiled. I love how easy the crust was. Thanks

This is a good meal for picky kids... trying to get my little boy to gain a little weight and eat more meat and veggies at the same time. The only thing I did different was I nixed the flour mixture topping and just topped it with bread crumbs instead... glad I did. 
Will make again for sure. Might even throw it in a pie crust next time.

I used broccoli instead of peas, and 2 cream of chicken, one cream of mushroom, and one cream of celery soup.  I used campbells 98% fat free soups, skim milk and light butter.  My husband and 6 yr old loved it.  My daughter is another story, but if it's not macaroni and cheese, she won't eat it.  So she doesn't count!

I tried this recipe with turkey breasts and cut the recipe in half.  It was delicious.  In the future, I might try different crusts.  I will definitely make this again.

The crust didn't work out, it just melted right into the dish. The taste was excellent, though, so I'll probably make this again.

Unfortunately, I was not pleased with this recipe.  It tasted bland and there was really no crust, which is the best part of chicken pot pie.

Awesome ! ! ! Although I was hesitant when I placed this in front of my kids and they all said it looked gross!!! But then they tasted it (because that's a rule in our house!) and all three of them ate every last bite on their plates! Even *the dad* had seconds !!! I added some corn to this as well plus cut the recipe in 1/2 and have enough for another meal ! 

Thanks for a great recipe Casey! It's terrific !

I followed the recipe exactly, but this dish didn't turn out at all!!  It was soupy, runny, and didn't look or taste anything like any other chicken pot pie I have ever tasted.  This was so runny it actually ran out of the casserole dishes into the oven and all over my countertop.  Will never make this again.

Delicious recipe.  I added Italian seasoning and pepper only.  I used the low fat Campbells soups and skim milk to make it less calories.  I cut the recipe in half and it was more than enough!!!

It has been years since I uploaded this, had honestly forgotten it, and must say when I prepare it now I completely exclude the broth and for the crust use 1/2 cup of milk. Also if you dice the potatoes and carrots well enough they should be cooked through in an hour and a half.
I appreciate all the comments positive or otherwise :) Thanks for trying it.

I made this recipe with a Bisquick topping, and everyone raved about it.  Would make it again curry flavored.  Included onion and a little garlic.  Made 1/2 recipe but full recipe of Bisquick topping, 35 minutes at 400, then 35 minutes after Bisquick topping at 350.
