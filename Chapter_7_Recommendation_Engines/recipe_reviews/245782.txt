I'm so excited about this recipe! First, browned butter spaghetti is one of my favorite dishes from the Old Spaghetti Factory, and this brought back so many memories. Very easy to make, and so easy to add other things into this dish. I wanted a bit more veggies, so in the same large pan that I made the chicken breasts, I added some sliced red pepper, onion and zucchini. Also stirred in some fresh parsley. Mizithra cheese is hard to find, but both Whole Foods and Trader Joes carried it, as did King Soopers. It's a semi hard cheese and you can buy it pre-grated or you can grate it yourself. Really loved this tasty and very nutty flavor-y dish. Thank you!!
