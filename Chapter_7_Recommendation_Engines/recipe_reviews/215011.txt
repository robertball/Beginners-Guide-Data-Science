Oh my, these are some of the best tea biscuits ever and being half English I know my tea biscuits! I am so happy to be the first to rate this recipe. These come very close to my Grandmother's! I used a full cup of raisins and doubled the amount of sugar because I like my tea biscuits a little on the sweet side. I also used half and half vs. milk. After I cut the biscuits, I let them set for 30 minutes to let the baking powder "react" in order to get them big and fluffy. After I did the egg wash, I topped them with a bit of turbinado sugar before popping them in the oven. These came out moist, light, fluffy, and simply delicious - perfect with a cup of tea! I have also made these substituting the raisins with miniature chocolate chips or dried cranberries. Thanks What's for dinner, mom? for a great recipe - my Mom (Nancy) requested these while she was in the hospital and I was so happy to have been able to make them for her one last time....

This recipe duplicates the Tea Biscuits we find at our local grocery store.  They are not very sweet.  My husband prefers them to the bakery style that have more sugar and vanilla.  If you prefer a sweeter biscuit then up the sugar to 1/2 cup.  Add in 1 tbsp vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp lemon or orange extract.  That will give you the bakery style. Those are my favorite :)  --The original recipe was for lactose free biscuits.  In order to do this I used vanilla soy milk or almond milk.  I also use Fleishmann's margarine as it is parve.  I also used dried cranberries in place of the raisins for this batch.  YUM!  On the days where lactose is not an issue - I have also tried using buttermilk and found it to work very, very well! **********8/15/10 -Made these in my new biscuit cast iron pan - really easy!  I preheated the pan and when the dough was ready I skipped the rolling stage and simply scooped about 1/2 cup of batter into each of the little pans.  They baked nicely and in a uniform size AND without all the extra work of rolling them out, getting a biscuit cutter, re-rolling scraps and lessened the clean up which was a big bonus.  I did pat the dough down to make the tops smoother and topped with cinnamon sugar - no egg wash this time.  I am very happy with the results so if you have a scone pan, large capacity muffin pan or a cast iron biscuit pan - give it a try!

Wow.  I reviewed these yesterday but my review is gone.  I will try again.  I made these with the extra raisins and sugar mentioned in Jillian's review and they were delicious!  I used half butter and half 'smart balance' cuz it has some health benefits and I could not be more pleased with the results.  Will definitely make again and this was so easy I am inspired to try making plain biscuits too.  Highly recommend!

These were really great.  My husband always likes something to have with his coffee each morning and these were perfect.  You can adjust the sugar to your own preference for sweetness, change flour to whole wheat and add cinnamon, etc for additional flavors.  I soak my raisins in orange juice that I warn in the microwave to instill a little extra flavor into the raisins.

These were so easy! I tried it with double the sugar, but they were waaay too sweet. So I tried it again with 1/4 cup of sugar instead. It was sweet, but not too  sugary. It's a great recipe and I'll be using it again!

Saw raisin tea biscuits in store today, and being a baker I hate to pay the price in supermarket. Came home and saw this recipe and read reviews, so I used a cup raisins and 1/4 cup sugar and the rest followed exactly... the best i have ever eaten... had 2 already and thinking I better put them away ... thx for a great recipe.

These are SOOO good!!! I listened to a previous review and doubled the sugar and raisens, I was worried that it would be too sweet but it wasn't, it was just perfect! The dough is a bit hard to work at first, especially when adding in the raisens but just keep pushing through because these turn out great!! Also, I found that I had to bake these more like 25 min instead of what the recipe called for.

Very Very easy recipe and the tea biscuits were gone!!!! My co-workers enjoyed them and the most popular comment was 'its not too sweet'. They were very easy to make, thank you for the recipe. Oh i added a teaspoon of almond essence and they came out excellent. I used regualr parkay butter (what i had on hand at the moment).

These were great! Taste was spot on and couldn't be quicker or easier to make. Would be almost exactly like a Hardee's raisin biscuit with a glaze on top. Will definitely be in the rotation for breakfast

Simply Delicious! Better than the other tea biscuit recipe I tried on this site. I also added more sugar, roughly 1/4 cup because I like it sweet. I also used 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup cream, and I used slightly less flour than the recipe called for because I ran out. I split the batter up to make three different flavours: chocolate chip, cinnamon & raisin and raspberry. This is the first time I've tried cooking with frozen berries and It turned out quite messy but delicious. These turned out very moist, not dry at all. I will definitely be making these again

My husband has been a big fan of tea biscuits for years.  I haven't been able to buy them since we moved 3 years ago.  He found this recipe and asked me to try them.  They were easy to make and so good.  Definitely a hit!  I followed others' recommendations and upped the raisins to 1 cup and the sugar to 1/4 cup.  Also let the biscuits rest for 30 minutes before baking.

I'm very annoyed with this recipe.  I used it to make biscuits for a high tea this afternoon and they turned out horrible.  Your ingredient list calls for a cup of hot water but in the directions you don't say to use it.  I assume the reason my biscuits are so doughy in the middle is because I didn't use the water.  Please correct this so others don't make the same mistake.

I doubled the sugar and used buttermilk.  The biscuits came out buttery and delicious.  The texture is on the heavy side though not as light as I hoped for but they are still delicious.

These were pretty good. The base dough had just the right amount of sweetness with the 3 Tblsp. of sugar. I was asked to find a recipe for blueberry biscuits. I couldn't find one and so I decided to use this one and add blueberries. I did the same amount of frozen blueberries, as raisins, and soaked them in warm water and dried them on a paper towel. To finish the biscuits, I drizzled them with a glaze: 1 cup confectioners sugar, 1.5 Tblsp. of milk, and 1/2 tsp. of vanilla from another recipe. I got 12 very generous sized biscuits from the recipe. My tweaks were fine, but honestly I think I would have just liked the soaked raisins with a little cinnamon and some powdered sugar on top, as depicted. Mine were a little sweet.

These are okay.  They weren't sweet enough for my taste (and I had already added extra sugar).  They also didn't get very light and fluffy like some other reviewers said they did.  They're not bad, just not what I'm looking for.

I seldom work with dough…. Let me rephrase that. I never work with dough. But these biscuits seemed simple enough. I wanted something to have with tea in the afternoon.  And I gotta say they turned out great.  I did use a little more sugar and when I went to grab the milk all I had was almond milk. I just ate one with my tea and I want another!

I really liked these biscuits! I had to use shortening as I didn't have butter but I think the butter might have made them almost too rich. I used a full cup of raisins and 1/4 cup sugar as others suggested. Definitely going on the make again list!

"Can't talk.  I'm raisin two little tea biscuits.  Gotta concentrate so it doesn't turn into raisin hell!"

These were definitely delicious, easy to make and no one raised hell about them so I guess that means they enjoyed them.  Although it might have been because the egg I used had two yolks in it.  Must've been twins.  Twins make everything more delicious apparently.  Anywho we tried these with jam, honey and cinnamon roll glaze and the winner, by far, was the cinnamon roll glaze!  If you go that route be sure to use a thicker glaze so it doesn't soak into the biscuit as much.

Fabulous! Best ever! Made it decadent by using heavy whipping cream and European butter. It was worth the calories!

I'm always a little bit wary when all of the reviews for a recipe are 'amazing', but this one was pretty good. I'll probably make it again to go with my tea. =)

My family loves Tea Biscuits and they are a bit pricey in the around here for just four . so i looked up the recipe. The only thing I changed was the sugar level used 1/4 cup and I used the dried cranberry's and a bit of cinnamon. They went nuts over them. Next time I might add a handful of chopped nuts for a more rustic turn to them

Wow! These tea biscuits are great. I too added 5 Tblsp. of sugar instead of 3. Everything else was the same as originally written. Thanks for a great recipe

Very nice result. Not too sweet; light yet 'substantial' texture. Ill make again. I used a 3" biscuit cutter and the yield was 9...they came out larger than I expected.

These were great! I was struck with a craving for Tim Horton's Raisin Tea Biscuits (I haven't had them in years) but did not want to grab one of those as they are not vegan. 

I made some simple swaps to make the recipe vegan friendly. I substituted the milk for vanilla soy milk, the butter for Earth Balance and a mixture of 1 tablespoon agave nectar and 2 tablespoons vanilla soy milk for the egg wash.

I ended up cooking them for about 20 minutes to get the tops to brown. I’m not sure if that was due to the size or me subbing for vegan egg wash but it was easy enough to keep an eye on them.

They turned out very good, especially for my first time ever making biscuits. I cut the dough into 8 triangles (it said 8 servings) and they seem pretty huge to me, I will probably cut it into 12 next time.

Both my husband and I thought these tea biscuits were good. I did add extra sugar, ( doubled the amount in the recipe). Next time I will add vanilla as I feel this would make them even better. The dough is a little sticky but that makes for a good biscuit! I had to bake for 25 minutes also. All in all a good recipe that I will use again. Thanks for sharing.

These turned out really good!  The additions of raisins in a biscuit is soooo good.  I definitely will make these again :)

The flour taste is very strong, helps to mask it with vanilla or orange rind. 

I cut it like scones, instead of biscuits coz i can!  Baked for 22 min. 

I dont have a pastry cutter, so grated the frozen butter before adding to flour mixture. 

Thanks for the recipe.

My husband loves all of my cooking and baking, but he raves about these! I always add more raisins because he thinks there are never enough.  This is a great recipe, I give it out to everyone!

Yum. I would make again. I used dried cranberries since I didn't have raisins. I would add more plus I might do half raisins half cranberries. Also I had to cook them more than 15 minutes. More like 25. I used skim milk since that was all I had on hand. 

Thanks delicious

So much better than store-bought! Pretty easy to make so it can be a spur of the minute preparation. Also, most of us have all the ingredients in the pantry. Try them, you'll like them!  One thing though…they took quite a bit longer to bake than the time stated in the recipe.

This is seriously the perfect tea biscuit! I am sitting down right now to a cup of tea and a biscuit fresh out of the oven. DELISH! I did run into one problem. I used lactose free milk and I don't know if that was the issue but I needed to add almost 3/4 cup more milk to the dough. I guess this changed the baking time because they needed an additional 9 minutes.They rose beautifully and I have 8 pretty large sized biscuits and 8 minis. I don't care for raisins so I used cranraisins. I will double the amount next time and maybe some time try chocolate chips. There will be a next time! Thanks Wfdm!

LACKED THE FAMILIAR BEAUTIFUL SCENT THAT WE ALWAYS NOTICE WHEN WE BUY THEM FROM TERMINI BROS BAKERY IN OUR AREA OF PHILADELPHIA.  MY HUSBAND DIDN'T LIKE THEM SAID THEY WERE DRY, AND VOID OF FLAVOR.  I WAS DISAPPOINTED, BUT WILL TRY AGAIN USING BUTTERMILK, VANILLA, AND A FEW OTHER FLAVORINGS. WILL ALSO LET THEM SET FOR A WHILE BECAUSE OF BAKING POWDER BEFORE BAKING.

No tea biscuit expert, but these were great! Dough was pretty sticky after adding the raisins but biscuits still turned out good. Did cook them longer - maybe 7 or 8 minutes more.
