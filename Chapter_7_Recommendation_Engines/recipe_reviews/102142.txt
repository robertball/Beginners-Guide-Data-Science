We're not into real spicey food, so we left out the peppers, and we used the mild sausage.  Next time I'll try using a sausage with a little more spice.  Kids loved them too.

I used HOT sausage after reading the reviews, but these were still awfully bland. i would rather just make an omelette or frittat and have a piece of toast on the side - would have taken much less time! doubt we will make this again.

They were okay. They have potential...maybe add some more sour cream and veggies to the batter. I'd try it again though.

This was very dry and grainy like other reviews stated.  Pretty bland too, however, I did NOT use "Hot" sausage and left out the Jals, so that might have contributed to the blandness.  I DO like the idea of this recipe, however, and will try it again, but I think next time I'll look up a crab cake recipe and what it says on getting it to stick together better.  MINE fell aparty VERY easily :( ~ Maybe next time a corn muffin mix or breadcrumbs??

I was reminded why I don't eat corn bread.  I'm just not big on the 'graininess' of it.  It was kind of bland, but I left out all of the veggies, so I should've added salt and/or onion salt and more pepper.  While I could do things to add taste next time, I don't think I'd make it again just because of the cornmeal.

These were ok.  Dry, not all that tasty, but decent.  Both hubby and I said 3 stars.

I shared this recipe with four others and every one of us rated it a four.  Be careful not to burn.
