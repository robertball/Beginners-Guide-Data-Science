Wow! Very good. What a unique way to eat a kiwi! I just had to try this as I had one kiwi left and all the other ingredients on hand. I just eyeballed every thing and didn't bother to let the ingredients "develop" for a day. Who can wait that long? I could only wait long enough to lightly toast my bread.....

I REALLY enjoyed this sandwich! I made it on a whim so I didn't have time to let the cream cheese mixture refrigerate overnight but it sure was tasty. I just eye-balled everything to taste and used dried lemon peel and whipped cream cheese for easier mixing/spreading. I served this on lightly toasted Italian-style sliced bread. This was also a big hit with my little guy. I will definately be making this again! Thanks for sharing.:)

I made these for a birthday party and they got mixed reviews. Some people liked them but others took one bite and didn't finish it. Personally I liked the mix of honey and kiwi.

My kids thought this was great. They've been on this whole kiwi kick for almost two weeks now so this was a great way to use up more. I didn't chop the kiwi fruit I just sliced it like I would for a tomato sandwich. I also didn't have time to refrigerate the spread. This was a great way to use up ingredients I always have on hand and clear out the fridge before grocery day. Thanks.

This was really yummy. I didn't have any lemons on hand so I used lemon curd and skipped the honey. Such a different idea but one that we loved.

This was delicious! I used lemon juice instead of lemon zest and did not refrigerate over night but it turned out great. This is one of my new favorites for a quick tasty breakfast.

I added a bit more honey and lemon zest for more tang!
