This was really so easy to prepare and a showstopper!  It looked beautiful plated and the flavors were really good.  I loved the orange flavor in the sauce over the sweet potatoes.  I will definitely be making again.

This is my favorite of all the Gourmet Mixes. I love the sweetness of the dish with the sweet potatoes and apples. I only used one tenderloin but still used the entire mix package and kept everything the same.  Don't overcook the tenderloin so it remains moist. Absolutely delicious!

This was so good and sooooo easy.  The apples and sweet potatoes are such a nice complement to the spiced pork.  I didn't want to overcook the pork, and it was done at 25 minutes.  I put the sweet potatoes and apples back into the oven, tented the pork and let it rest for another 5 minutes, and a beautiful dinner was then served.  Wouldn't change a thing, and as an added bonus, it's actually a very healthy entree with sides.  For anybody following Weight Watchers Plus, this calculates to 5 points.  Wouldn't hesitate to serve this to company.

LOVE the sweet potatoes and apples in combination with the perfectly spiced pork. So easy to put this together on a busy weeknight and the end result is fantastic! Perfect meal for a cold fall or winter evening.

I'm thoroughly impressed by the McCormick spice packets! This was my first time using one and my guests were raving about it for hours after the meal ended! The recipe couldn't be simpler and I love that it all cooks in one pan. I will definitely make this again!

This is such an easy, flavorful meal to prepare!  All the spices you need are in one packet, and my family loved this--especially my husband.  All of the McCormick Gourmet seasoning packets are fabulous, and such timesavers!

I was a bit dismayed when I saw the price for the McCormick's Seasoning packet was $2.00 but I bought it anyway and I'm glad I did. The seasoning and brown sugar creates a "rub" that goes over the pork. Then o.j. is added to the remaining season to create a "sauce" for the potatos and apples. The seasoning's is a bit spicy but is offset by the mellowness of the potatos and sweetness of the apple. P TIP: the directions are a bit confusing. Mix all the seasoning with brown sugar. Then take about 1/4 C and rub on pork. The remaining 3/4 C seasoning/brown sugar is mixed with the O.J.

I wasn't thrilled with this recipe.  I thought I would be because I love the ingredients.  First off, I thought the mix gave the pork an odd, metallic taste, although it tasted great on the sweet potatoes and apple.  It was also sort of salty which is saying a lot because we like salt!  It was a huge disappointment to us.

It was okay but not great like I was hoping for.  It also took a lot longer to cook then the suggested.

This is wonderful!  I made it before and it was so good.  Today I added butternut squash and onions to the roasting vegetables.  I used half a pork loin rather than tenderloin cuz it was on sale, so I just left the veggies chunkier to allow for the extra cooking time.  And as someone else suggested, the cornflour slurry at the end makes a wonderful gravy.

This is the first of the new McCormick Spice packets I've tried and it was very good!  I loved the spiciness of it.  I had one pretty large pork tenderloin (the ones from Costco, you know everything is bigger at Costco).  I cooked a little longer at a bit lower temp and used a meat thermometer so I would get the pork just right and it all turned out perfect.  The sweet potatoes and apples went so well with it and the sauce with the spices and oj made for a great sauce.  I'm excited to try some more of the new spice mixes.  Makes doing a nice meal a snap!!

This was super easy and very tasty!  I lowered the servings to 6 but followed the recipe to a T.  Not too spicy and just the right amount of sweetness from the apples.  I love sweet potates and roasting them is a great way to enjoy them.  I would highly recommed this recipe to anyone.

Absolutely delicious! I had guests over for dinner and tried this recipe out. It was a HUGE hit. I seasoned the pork with salt, pepper, and adobe along with the seasoning pack. I also added some cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg to the sweet potatoes. Outstanding!

Delicious. The McCormick spice packet is a great weeknight shortcut, but this is truly a company-worthy meal. Next time, I will probably use more apples, as we loved that aspect of the meal. Butternut squash would be good in place of the sweet potatoes as well.

Very easy, very good. Two comments:

(1) "12 servings" doesn't mean that it serves 12. I added an extra apple and an extra sweet potato and it was still a little light for eight people. As a one-pan dinner, I would recommend you plan on this recipe serving six people.

(2) Folks at altitude remember it will take a little longer to cook (I'm in Denver and it took nearly an hour instead of the 35 min suggested in the recipe).

Very good, we really liked it. Tasted like Oktoberfest in a baking dish.  I covered mine in the oven when the cooking time needed to be doubled.  It was tender and juicy.   I removed some to the spicy liquid and placed in a saucepan, added 1 tablespoon cornstarch to ½ cup apple juice and cooked until thick and bubbly.  This made a wonderful sauce for potatoes.  This would never serve 12 at my table, 6 nice servings are more likely for 2 pounds of meat.

I posted this earlier but don't know where it went.  Made this recipe last night and fell in love with it.  I made some changes.  I had 3 lbs of pork chops and used one pack of the spice pack mixed with OJ, oil and brown sugar and marinated them over night.  I used another spice pack and coated the apples and sweet potatoes.  I baked the apples and sweet potatoes in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.  I seared the pork chops, 3 minutes on each side and baked them on top of the sweet potatoes and apples the last 15 minutes.  The flavors of the spices blend amazingly well with the apples and sweet potatoes.  Great job McCormick!

This dish was amazing and very easy to make. I was originally skeptical because of the pre-made spices, but it made it easier in the end.
The pork was thoroughly cooked and juicy. Complemented well with the potatoes and apples.
I recommend this dish for any situation. It felt very classy and fresh, but could easily used if wanting to wow guests. I will definitely be using this dish again especially during the fall!

This is excellent and so easy.  I used boneless pork chops this time and turned out great.  Make sure you cut the sweet potatoes small like the recipe says so they are done when the meat is done.  1" cubes is perfect.  I quarter an apple and that seems to work well also (I used an apple slicer the first time and they were smaller slices and they were a tiny mushy). This is so delicious!!  You can find the spice mix with all the other packet seasonings in most stores.

My family, even the 8 and 2 year olds, LOVE This! They have all asked that I make this for Thanksgiving. Yes the meat was good but the apples and potatoes were the real Hit! I used red potatoes, but kept every thing else the same. My husband told every one he knows about this dinner. It is a must Try!
