i made this in the slow cooker and it turned out amazing!  i even caught the husband eating chunks of pork out of the pot, something he never does!
i cut the roast into smaller pieces, browned all sides in a little oil, and made the sauce in the same pot.  i lined the bottom of the slow cooker with a sliced onion, and placed the pork pieces on it, then dumped the sauce in.  after about 5 hours on high, the meat was falling apart in tender chunks and the house smelled wonderful.  plenty of juicy gravy too!
next time because i like ginger so much , i think i'll simply add sliced ginger to the slow cooker with the onion bed.

Very tasty and flavorful pork. It was a bit heavy, but it made a good combination with jasmine rice. I used low-sodium miso paste, but the meat was still somewhat salty. I will either cut down the soy sauce or use low-sodium soy sauce next time. Also the sauce thicken up pretty fast, so be sure you check frequently to see if you need to add more water.

I won't lie.  I skipped step one and dumped everything into the crockpot and set it on high before i headed out on a sunday morning.  when i got back in that evening- the meat was falling off the bone, tender, full of flavor.  will definitely make this again- and thinking of trying it with other meats.

Very delicious!  I am not a cook by no means.  I followed the exact recipe and everyone loved it and couldn't get enough.  I would, however, cut off all the pork fat which I didn't do, the next time I make this dish.  The fat made it just TOO HEAVY and lardy.  Other than that, taste was just superb!

Couldn't find any Miso so made it in the slow cooker without, should have added more liquid.  Still very good.

Perfect in the Instant Pot! (80  minutes at High pressure with Natural Release.)

 Instead of cutting in 2" slices, I made full-thickness cuts with a long knife throughout the roast. Browned in toasted sesame oil,  doubled the fresh ginger, added lemongrass and kaffir lime and 1/2 cup shao xing cooking wine, reduced water to 1/2 cup, and used low-sodium soy sauce. Served with rice and steamed Asian veggies the first night. 2nd night, shredded the leftover pork and tossed with leftover pan sauce and soba noodles, with Asian slaw on the side.

Cooked the roast whole on a high setting for 6.5 hours in a slower cooker.  Skipped the browning step. Cut down miso to 1/2 cup after trying this recipe several times.  Used a large 4.5 pound roast; it worked out great!  Just the right amount of saltiness.  Will be one of my go to recipes for a busy day!

This recipe is delicious beyond words. The only thing I did differently was to add sliced sweet onion to the mix. I serve it with buttered thin rice noodles with saut√©ed carrots and snow peas and a little of the miso broth mixed in. We then dice the leftover pork in small pieces and soak overnight in the remaining broth and make the Pork Fried Rice recipe from this site the next day. It amounts to two days of Asian food heaven.

I really liked this.  Did in the slow cooker : lo 8 hours.  I added more water to cover the pork, but it ended being too much.  Also I used 3/4 cups miso paste, not miso soup. The instructions were a bit unclear.  . Also I added 2 teaspoons ginger rather than just one.  Awesome!!  This is going in the rotation as it  was good the first night with sauteed cabbage and rice.  It was even better the second night. I used some of the broth to sauteed collard greens down and then served it over rice.  The 2 year old chowed down!
 Perfect weeknight meal.  10 minute prep in am.  Come home cook rice and sautee veggies.  Easy and tons of leftovers.    Definitely a comfort food being from Hawaii and all...

I am uber excited to try this dish.  My problem is the white (shiro) miso.  I have looked at vons, trader joes, and fresh and easy.  Perhaps I do not know what I am looking for.  Does anybody have a tip they would be willing to share?

the marinate is good but a bit salty and at times overwhelms the pork which is fairly mild. i think that maybe this would be better with a different protein, such as chicken thighs that has a bit stronger flavor on its own.

So much umami going on here! The aroma is intoxicating. We serve this with rice and the gravy. We also cut away the extra fat when we cut the roast into large chunks. And we cooked the gravy down a bit. Keeping the kids happy, we heated up some green peas for the veggie and ended up mixing it all together on our plates. Easy and delicious. Thank you for posting Renee from Hawaii  !

This is AMAZING. Makes A LOT of rice so that you have something to soak up the sauce. You will want to eat all of the sauce.

I followed the recipe exactly, using low sodium soy sauce. This was not too salty, nor too fatty. I did simmer it for the last 20 mins uncovered, but the sauce thickened up as it cooled anyway. I served it with Kings Hawaiian rolls as an alternative proten at a sushi party. All 5 lbs were devoured. I barely had to clean the dutch oven. Perfect and amazing!

loved the flavors of this miso braised pork. I didn't slice the pork roast as ours was Bone In, but still seared the roast in a pan and followed the direction as if it was sliced. Though at one point I was concerned the roast wasn't going to FIT in the pan (it was 5.5lbs!) but luckily I have a 7qt slow cooker to hold the behemoth! The only thing I would change is next time is to add some kind of thickener to the "juice/drippings" afterwards, because its watery on its own. Instead we used it as a "jus" in small bowls to dip the meat into.

Made this in a slow cooker. Will not add oil for slow cooker next time. Used ‚Äúred‚Äù miso (more like dark brown) for no other reason than I had some already. However, it did add good color to this dish. Also added minced garlic and ginger an hour before it‚Äôs completed cook time to max out its flavor. Cooked for 6 hours. Took it to a potluck dinner and got LOTS of compliments and was completely gone in no time. Definitely my new go-to recipe for any occasion. 
Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Sorry but I found this to be very bland.  The flavor didn't permeate the meat, which came out very dry, though tender to the point of falling apart.

I made this with a little extra water after reading the other reviews and this was delicious!  I will make it again for sure.  Easy and yummy!

This turned out quite well.  I added an onion as others did and left the lid of the slow cooker open for about 1 1/2 hours to thicken up the sauce and give the pork crispy edges.  Really good over rice!

Made this for dinner last night and it was excellent! I used pork tenderloins instead of a roast. Cut them in half and seared the halves all over. Then continued with the recipe. Needed another cup of water to cover them. Only needed 2:15 hours to be ready. Sauce was excellent over sticky rice with book choy. Definitely a keeper!

Very good but a bit salty.  Added extra garlic and ginger, plus zest and juice of one lime.  Great over rice but you have to skim the fat then simmer a bit to reduce sauce (I had to add more liquid to cover 5 lbs of meat) . will make it again.

Fantastic! I doubled the garlic and ginger in the recipe. All other things pretty much as written. I can't wait for leftovers tonight. I have made this in the past and it is better the next day. It is a very good dish for a rainy day meal.

Delicious! Cooked it in the crockpot after browning on the stovetop. Added some sliced onion to the bottom of the crockpot as another reviewer had suggested. Sooooo good!

The whole family loved this (though surprisingly the hubby did not).  After step 1, threw everything in the slow cooker because we were going to be out all day, and after 8 hours it came out awesomely tender.  It microwaved even more tender and flavorful over the next few days. No extra water was needed - it still made so much gravy - more than I know what to do with. Served over angel hair.  Cut down the brown sugar by half (dad is diabetic) and didn't miss the rest - followed the recipe to a T otherwise.

This dish was so easy to make, I put the pork in a crock pot, mix the other ingredients, poured it in the crock pot.  You can use white or yellow miso paste, I had yellow miso on hand so it worked out perfect!  Although it was a bit salty we all loved it!  I might try it with just a 1/2 cup of miso (we don't have low salt miso) and low sodium soy the next time.  I skim off the oil from the top before serving since pork butt is a very fatty cut.  I will definitely make this one again!  YUM!!
