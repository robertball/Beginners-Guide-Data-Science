This candy is super delicious and sweet.  My mother use to make this for me when I was little, I made it for my children and then grandchildren.  It's always a big hit.  Do NOT alter this make as directed. Thanks for reminding me of my childhood Brandilynn.  Brings back so many memories. I would give this a 10 if available.  Keep this refrigerated after you make it.

Love this recipe! It's a traditional Irish recipe that my family made for years around the holidays. I use more than 1/3 a cup of peanut butter because I like a thick layer (and I like the peanut butter with the honey because the flavor is wonderful and it's easy to spread.) Make sure that you put this into the fridge until you are ready to serve.

A favorite recipe from my childhood! My mom made this for Christmas, to put on the cookie tray and it was always one of my favorites, because I love peanut butter so much. I did not measure the peanut butter for this recipe, I just spread a generous layer on top of the potato/sugar layer. You definitely want to keep this in the fridge until you are ready to serve. I keep it in an air tight container, with wax paper in between the layers.

I must be stuck on stupid today.  My daughter came home from school today and told me she needed a cultural dish for her class potluck, TOMORROW.  I panicked at first but my Dad suggested I make potato candy like my grandmother used to make when I was little.  A little online research brought me to this recipe and the reviews that raved about how easy it was.  Well here it is ten o'clock at night and I have watery sugary potato soup.  I followed the directions to the letter and somehow ended up with nothing even close to being able to be served to my daughters class.  Guess it is time to head to the grocery store and find something else.

I've made Potato Candy in the past, and since have lost that recipe. This recipe looked right, so I gave it a shot. Like many others here, my mixture was nothing but soup and completely unusable…then I evaluated the situation and realized why.

Here's what's wrong with this recipe: The recipe calls for 1 (16 ounce/1 pound) package of Confectioners Sugar…THIS is nowhere near enough. If you shop at Wal-Mart, you'll notice that their bag is (32 ounce/2 pounds), this entire bag is what you should be using, not half of it, or your typical 1 pound "box".


In addition, a little adjustment to the directions- 
1. After mashing your potato with vanilla and milk, refrigerate it then, not after it's dough- the cold dough is too hard to work with.
2. After your mashed potatoes have cooled off, mix in half of the sugar all at once. (it's ok if it's soupy at this point) Then, after that is mixed, dump in the rest of the sugar all at once, and mix. (this time it should make dough)
3. Do Not refrigerate your dough before you try to roll it, your dough should be workable right out of the bowl. Chilling the dough will just make it harder to work with.

Hope this helps!

Note: I have an alternate recipe for this in my collection, with the correct ingredient list and helpful tips within the instructions. Come on over and try it out!

I followed this recipe, as another reviewer said, exactly...well, something was amiss.  It was a blob of soft dough that even after 1 hour in refrig it was nearly impossible to roll out.  I had to add at least 1 1/2 to 2 cups more sugar(and it should have been more) in order to roll it.  Then the peanut butter was so hard to spread!  I needed much more than 1/3 cup just to cover the dough.  Then the act of rolling the dough, it was more like pushing it into a form of a log.  Shish! Not really worth the frustration, even if it is an Irish tradition.   And in the end, it just too sweet.

This is one of those recipes from my mother's childhood that was never written down.  A few modifications - forget measurements!  Start with only HALF of a small boiled potato (peeled and mashed), add a lid of vanilla and mix.  Then add 3 large spoons of powdered sugar and mix up a little, let set for a few minutes.  When you come back, the sugar and potato mix begins to melt!  Keep adding and mixing in powdered sugar until you get a pie dough consistency.  This takes a lot of powdered sugar and mixing - it's a great arm workout.  Once pie dough consistency is met, sprinkle powdered sugar on a clean dry surface, rub on hands and then roll out the dough to about a 1/4" thick.  Then use CRUNCHY peanut butter spread over the surface.  Roll up the dough, cut into 3 sections.  For each section, roll it out until less than 1.5" in diameter.  Do so for each segment (or wrap and store in fridge for later) then cut into bite size slices.  Store in fridge.  The crunchy peanut butter adds texture and keeps the entire thing from being too runny or so sweet.  Some people even add shredded coconut.  I wonder what adding dark chocolate shavings would do...

I couldn't believe how easy this candy was! Make sure to add enough powdered sugar to get the potato portion to a dough that is easy to roll, and not too sticky- I think I added a little more than 16oz. And use more than 1/3 a cup of peanut butter. I probably spread on a full cup (I LOVE peanut butter and wanted a thick layer but I would say 2/3 a cup would be the perfect amount). I actually rolled the outside with dark chocolate shavings before I sliced it and it turned out really good and made it look nice.

Friendly tip: DON'T add milk. Not that it's impossible to make the dough with milk, it is just so much easier to get the desired texture if milk is not added. Most recipes do not call for milk, and milk is most likely the reason for the soupy mess many got. If milk is added, more sugar will likely be needed. Hope this helps!

Yummy! (and super easy!) This candy is very sweet so I decided to use natural peanut butter. The natural peanut butter with the potato/sugar layer complemented each other perfectly! Do what other reviewers mention and increase the peanut butter (I probably used double the suggested amount.)

This is the exact recipe from grandma (I think it came from a cookbook from the 1960's) but honestly my family does not measure the peanut butter- we just spread a nice, thick layer on it (more than the recipe calls for). You definitely want to sprinkle a generous amount of powdered sugar out on the cutting board or waxed paper when rolling out the dough. The dough can be sticky, but adding more powdered suar will fix this- do not add additional milk or vanilla and use thick, homemade mashed potaoes for the best results.

I tried this recipe and like others I ended up with a semi-fluid mess of half liquid sugar and mash potatoes. It never firmed up and I had to throw it away because it was inedible.

I did a little research but could not for the life of me figure out why this was. Maybe it's cause I added the powdered sugar when the potato was still warm/hot? But it doesn't say anything in the recipe about chilling the potato once mashed. So I'm at a loss.

My little nephew loved this candy and I loved the taste and the fact that it was super easy to make. I took the advice of another reviewer and made this with natural peanut butter, which was perfect with the sweet powdered sugar/potato layer.

I'm not sure what happened, but this mixture didn't come close to a dough - it was very soupy although, I checked 10 x's over to be sure I followed the directions exactly. I used to make this also as a child with my grandmother and never had such a soupy mix.  I thought that 1/4 cup of mashed potatoes was very little - I remember using at least one potato.

Such a simple and sweet candy. I did what other reviewers suggested and added more than the 1/3 a cup of peanut butter- I ended up spreaing about 2/3 a cup on it. I also rolled this out on a silicone baking mat that was generously dusted with powdered sugar and this it super easy to roll!

I've never eatin this candy, but my husband has been asking me to make it because his grandmother used to make it for him. I only used 1 tablespoon of milk and that was the perfect consistency. Next time I won't use the vanilla and go ahead and use the other tablespoon of milk to even it back out. It would've been ok, but the vanilla was too powerful for us. Nothing a few little changes can't fix though! Defiantly be sure to have enough sugar around to put on the parchment paper or wax paper whichever you use to keep it from sticking. I also chilled mine in the freezer for about 10 minutes each time it said to refrigerate to speed the process up.

I tried this recipe exactly and it turned into a blob. If someone could please share with me how this "dough" is suppose to be firm enough to spread peanut butter on it, I would be very appreciative....

OMG, don't do it :/ It was like sickeningly sweet potato soup and I used TWO lbs of powdered sugar and it still melted right off of the waxed paper. My kids are so sad and I am too. It wasn't cheap wasting all those ingredients. I'm going to try again for them tomorrow but I'm going to make the dough my own way. This definitely isn't right and the recipe needs to be fixed or removed before people waste even more food and money :( Wosh I could give it NO stars.

I love this recipe... however, you have to make sure the mashed potato is cold or else one of two things happen.... potato soup or 3 lbs of sugar is needed :) Been there and done that...

The tricks to potato candy
1 mash ur tator with vanilla and milk then let it cool down. 
2 START WITH  1lb powdered sugar then continue to add more till it gets kinda like a pie crust texture. IT WILL TAKE AT LEAST 1 1/2LBS OF SUGAR! 
3 there is no set amount for the peanutbutter. use what ur family likes. 
3 you can omit vanilla and use any flavoring you like!  roll the potato mix like ya would if making a snake out of dough. cut off in coin size pieces and dust them with powdered sugar. 
4  you dont have to use milk.  use your flavoring for a more intense flavor. 
Potato candy is all about mixing till your arm falls off with adding your favorite flavors or add in.  if its soupy add more of the sugar or if its getting to sweet then use instant tators mixed with the sugar.

It was awful, a blob of soft dough and a big mess, if you chilled it, it was too hard, and then it was too soft.

Definitely needs way more sugar than called for. I had a 32 oz bag, so I doubled the potatoes, milk and vanilla. Guess I should have just left it alone, because I ended up with soup even after 48 oz of sugar. This recipe needs to say to add confectioners sugar UNTIL it forms into dough. Not just a set amount.

This is an old-fashioned recipe that is fun to make with the kids (as long as you do not mind messes!  I use 1/4 cup of store-bought mashed potatoes, 1/2t vanilla and about 1 1/2 pounds 10X sugar.  I keep milk handy in case it gets too thick, but I've only ever had to use a teaspoon or two.  Otherwise, you get the potato soup the others were complaining about.  And be generous with the peanut butter- otherwise, it can be a bit sweet.  I'm addicted!!!

I will be making this again very soon. The ingredients were simple and I have them on hand at all times, and the candy turned out delicious. I did use a lot more peanut butter, because I LOVE the stuff and wanted a really thick layer.

When I was a child my mother would make this candy if we had leftover mashed potatoes. I don't remember her using vanilla extract, but that was a very long time ago. For Christmas you can roll it in red or green colored sugar to coat the outside and make it pretty.

Love this recipe. Yeah, sometimes you have to add way more sugar then you thought or sometimes way less. It always turns out to be a favorite at a party though!!!

I learned to make this in school 40 years ago but lost the recipe.
I always start with cold left over mashed potatoes. Then add your sugar. Work it util a stiff dough is formed then layer your surface with 10x sugar and roll out. To make spreading easier you can slightly  warn your peanut butter by floating the jar in a bowl of warm water Not Hot. If its too warm it will squeeze out when you roll it. Speard out the PB and let it rest a 10 minutes or until the PB comes  back to room temp before rolling. Chill the roll for 1 hr before slicing.

I agree with the lady who said to just get a half a boiled potato, add some vanilla and then start adding powdered sugar until the dough is of a consistency that can be rolled.   Just forget the recipe!  Also, you can separate the dough into sections and use food coloring to color it.  Looks very nice with the peanut butter filling.!!

PLEASE READ. To all the people whining about it being "soupy" or "watery", if you would have done enough research, some potatoes are bigger than others when you just use one potato. All you do is add more powdered sugar until it's a form dough. That's it. Add more sugar. I did this EXACTLY and they came out AMAZING!! Just like Granny makes. Also, the milk isn't even needed.

My family has been making potato candy for generations. Please remember that every potato has a different amount of moisture so the amount of powdered sugar needed will vary. You will need to add powdered sugar until you get to a dough consistency. If it's soupy you need to continue to add sugar. Sometimes if you add too much and the dough is dry, then you can add just a little bit of milk, maybe a tablespoon. I always start with one medium potato - dice it boil it and mash it. Then get started added the sugar. My family never actually wrote down a recipe. Every time we make it, the potato dictates how much sugar. Be patient. This is a delicious candy and fun to pass the technique down to the next generation.

I tried making this recipe twice (the first time with a similar recipe)... this time I let it sit over night in the fridge, and still had a goopy mess. I'd love know what to do to fix it, I don't want to give up, but am tempted. I hate throwing food away.

Was good but had to add more powdered sugar to recipe since as written made more of a batter than dough. Kind of like fudge, you can only eat one at a time due to sweetness.

DO NOT USE THIS RECIPE. I used it to the recipe. Followed directions, it's too much milk and vanilla. I ended up having to double my sugar. Half the milk and half the vanilla or you end up with a soup.

Grandma started me on this candy, never used a recipe. Leftover mashed potatoes , about a golf ball and a half size, few drops of vanilla then add powdered sugar to get to the consistency of pie dough. It will take a LOT of sugar.  Roll it out spread a heavy layer of crunchy PB. Roll it up chill and have at it. one small piece at a time is adequate.

The smallest amount of mashed potato will enable you to make a dough. I'm not sure what the chemical reaction is for mixing confectioners sugar with cooked potato but the cooked potato feels like an insatiable pit for the confectioners sugar. I'd say this is a good recipe for winging it. Take 2-3 tablespoons of cooked mashed potato, then add confectioners sugar until dough is formed. Spread with goodies of choice (peanut butter is very American, and why not try shredded coconut or chocolate?). Definitely want to chill after rolling and not before. Is was made by my grandmothers (German and Irish) and I had no idea how little potato and how much confectioners sugar made up this treat. Still tastes like love.

I use 1/2 of one small potato, cooked, mashed with a little dab of butter and salt, and chilled, or at least room temp. The heat affects the sugar just like you put it on the stove, so that explains the gloppy mess. I have a 2 lb bag of 10x sugar on hand. This is not an exact measure recipe. How much sugar you use is going to depend on the type of potato you use and how wet it is before adding it to the sugar. Add sugar in gradually until it forms a ball of dough. It should be minimally sticky. If it begins to dry out and crack as you work with it making it into a log, add a drop or two of milk with your fingers to soften it. Add crunchy peanut butter or topping of choice. Again, there's no measuring here, add what works for your personal preferences. 

Roll into log and thin with hands by pulling gradually if its too thick. This is very sweet and a little goes a longggg way. Thin slice and store in refrigerator. Its definitely a fun recipe to do with kids, but prepare for a mess!

We used to make this with my grandma from South Carolina.  It IS painfully sweet, but fun to make and pretty yummy in SMALL quantities (like less than a whole 1/4" slice!).  Fond memories earned this an extra star.

I always thought this was a family recipe. I guess not. Really you don't need the milk or vanilla just mashed potatoes and confectioner sugar milk maybe if you put to much sugar in. And you don't have to refrigerate dough before adding the peanut butter just after. If your husband is like mine you can use hazelnut spread as well. I like it either way. The internet does know all.

Favorite childhood recipe from my mother.  I have used cream cheese instead of potatoes - delicious!  Be sure to use more powdered sugar in recipe and put a LOT on the waxed paper to roll out.  The only time I refrigerated was after it is rolled and before slicing.

Oh dear!  Very hard to form dough and if you continue adding sugar it gets way too sweet.
My husband described this candy to me...his late mother made it when he was a kid...and he has been asking me to make some.
After looking at the ingredients I was afraid it was going to be a disaster.  If you really want to try this, maybe start with half a batch and see what happens.
For those who try it and end up with a sticky mess- you may be able to salvage your ingredients by remelting whole mixture- then stir in rice krispies or other cereal and press into balls. Try this in a small way at first too...to be sure it will hold together.

I followed the recipe, but never could reach dough consistency! I added 2 more cups of powdered sugar, PLUS I added about 1/2 cup of all purpose flour. That created the dough ball, I regfrigerated, then rolled out, but it has to be done quickly as the sugar starts to melt.
