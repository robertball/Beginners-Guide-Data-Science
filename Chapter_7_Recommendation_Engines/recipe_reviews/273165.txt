I made it for the family.  Everyone loved it. It is simple to make.  The sauce is what makes it.  I did add Zuccinni to it as well.

This is a great recipe for a Keto eating plan.  Although I really would like to have a sized down recipe, for four.

Delicious!!! I made it one day and didnâ€™t eat it until the next. Still amazing! Going to freeze part of it and I think that will work great.

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was good but we found that there was too much chicken for the amount of broccoli.  Next time we will add other vegetables like mushrooms, red pepper, and maybe zucchini as well as the broccoli.

Pretty good. I added a bit of ranch dressing mix.  What would be unhealthy would be canned soup,  flour,  vegetable oils,  carbs, especially for diabetics.

We didn't like almond slices (people thought they were chicken bone chips). Mixed feelings about the pork rinds - next time might make half with pork rinds for the keto dieters, and just bread crumbs (or nothing) for the non-keto folks.
