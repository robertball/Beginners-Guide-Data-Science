Another update!- I was the first reviewer of this recipe a couple of years ago and I have been enjoying these on a regular basis ever since. Then yesterday I had an epiphany- Brownie Sundae! I topped these warm gingery, gooey delights with some french vanilla ice cream and warm roasted pears in pear caramel sauce. I topped with a few toasted walnuts and a dollop of whiskey whipped cream. Eye-rolling-toe-curling-oh-my-God good! 12/13/14 Im sitting here again eating one after another of these fabulous brownies. I can taste the butter, the brown sugar, the molasses etc... Every ingredient seems to be perfectly balanced with every other ingredient. Jozi is either a baking genius or very lucky because these are perfection. I am a shameless, unapologetic tweaker but my advice is to do these exactly as written the first time. You can always tweak them when you make them again. And you will make them again. I can almost guarantee it.

Lovely, spicy, tasty bites. Since my crew loves their ginger baked goods to have a pleasantly warm afterglow, I added a full tablespoon of ginger and several good shakes of cayenne pepper. Then sprinkled the top with sugar to ensure a crackly crust. These didn't disappoint. I'm perplexed by the reviews that call this recipe "cake-like" because mine were nice and chewy, with a thin, shiny crust that shattered when bitten into. To be fair, I need to note that I used only all purpose flour, as I didn't have any whole wheat. Maybe that made the difference? Another possible explanation I can think of is overbaking. They were devoured in no time flat, and one friend who is a major fan of gingersnaps said he actually prefers these because of their chewy texture - the flavor is virtually the same. These are easy to whip up in no time at all - much quicker than making individual cookies. I always keep molasses on hand, and this is just about as good an excuse as any I've found for continuing to do so. A+

These are really good!  Very easy.  The batter is quite thick, but gently spread it in the 9x13 pan.  I baked mine for 35 minutes and have crispy edges and a soft interior.  Mine are very much the texture of brownies, not like a cake at all.  I read the reviews and added a sprinkling of cayenne and just a pinch of cloves.  Also sprinkled the top with some white sugar before baking, which gives a little sparkle to the top. One reviewer mentioned they were too salty...I wonder if that person may have used salted butter and also added the salt in the ingredient list.  I used unsalted butter. Also, be sure to sift your baking powder and soda into the flour.  Perhaps you tasted a little lump of baking soda.  Just guessing.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It's a keeper!

These are incredible - chewy, sweet (but not too sweet), the perfect amount of gingery zip.  Try these.   Love them. As an aside, it did take a little extra time in my oven - almost 40 minutes.

I gave this recipe to my 16 yr to make for my b-day present. I had not baked it prior so I was not sure what to expect. (Risky yes) While I enjoyed the flavor, it did need a longer baking time (by at least 10 min) than indicated in the recipe.

These are really good. I found them to have chewy and brownie-like texture. I did have to bake a bit longer (more like 40 minutes) but did not wait until my toothpick came out dry- just clean.

I went out of town for a day, came back, and the entire pan was gone!  Beautifully moist and delicious, definitely not cakey, with a nicely balanced ginger flavor.  I baked mine for around 38 mins., which made the edges slightly crispier than I would have liked, but the interior was perfect and cut into squares with no problem.  These will be a fall tradition from now on.

Delicious! Chewy and dense, and great flavor.  We did think they were too sweet, so when I make them again, I'll reduce the sugar by at least 1/2 a cup.

I increased the ginger by 50% and sprinkled about a quarter cup of candied ginger on top before baking. They are delicious and the ginger flavor intensified over several days as we ate them. Next time I'd make them a few days in advance for the stronger flavor.

I absolutely love the dough structure. THe treat was enjoyed by the whole family! However, I noticed that the dough is too solidy to make brownies, so instead I  put lumps on the batch to make cookies. Other than that, it was very delicious!

These are so good I'm going to have to ban them from my house! I cannot stop eating them.  Chewy, buttery, gingery, brown sugar goodness!  I avoid gluten, so I used GF flour but otherwise stuck pretty close to the recipe. I added a sprinkle of nutmeg and allspice and about 1/3 cup soft diced ginger (from King Arthur Flour).  Since I was adding a crystallized ginger product, I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and used mostly dark brown sugar. The bars are nice and moist with a lovely ginger flavor. Next time (and there WILL be a next time!!) I may add some fresh ginger, too.

12 5 16 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/214223/ginger-bars/ ... These are really, really goooood!  Only changes I made in the recipe were increasing ginger to 1T; decreasing sugar to 1 1/4c & salt to 1/2t;& 1/2c butter w 2T olive oil.  I changed preparation just a little, too.  It just didn't seem right as listed. I mixed the butter & sugar, then oil & molasses, then added vanilla & eggs one at a time.  I put the ginger in with the flour.  In a glass 9x13, done in 25. I made one cookie - just to see - since the batter was cookie/brownie-like.  Soft & good, but cookies would need more flour therefore changing the flavor.  Go for the ginger brownies.  They're not all that pretty, but you're not baking them to look at now, are ya?!  :D  I didn't notice a big change in intensity of ginger as others did after a couple days, but they are still yummy & not sticky - as you might think they'd become.  'Haven't tried, but French vanilla ice cream & caramel sauce sound divine with these babies ... I renamed this "Molasses Torte a la mode" in a local recipe contest & won.  :) .... SOMEWHAT related ... http://allrecipes.com/personal-recipe/63855793/ginger-molasses-cookies/ ... It uses whole wheat, too.  :)

I love these!! Brownie-like texture, gingery, buttery and just the right sweetness. I was out of ww flour, used all all-purpose flour. I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. Mine were done in 20 minutes. I will use this recipe again  :)

These do need to bake longer but maybe because of my high altitude, 6500 feet. I baked until dark brown and crispy on edges and were still doughy in the middle. But had a great taste. Will try a larger pan so can spread out more next time.

Easy to make, and the flavor was very nice.  But in terms of texture, this wasn't brownie-like at all.  A good recipe for ginger CAKE though.

Delicious. Fantastic. When I get bad period cramps, I turn to ginger. This batter can hold a lot before it gets too much. I probably threw in a quarter cup of grated fresh and maybe I'll do more next time. I look forward to messing around with the spices and cooking time. Next time, I'm definitely sugaring the top and maybe adding a little cinnamon or cloves.

Amazing!! Gingery, chewy, crunchy edges....all good! Like other reviewers said, it is a thick batter so you need to spoon it into the dish and spread it, does not pour. I cooked it in a glass baking dish for 25 mins and it was perfect. Will be making this one again and again. Thank you!

These were extremely flavorful! Yummoooo!! I was a bit concerned they were going to turn out to cake like for my taste so I did tweak the recipe a bit to insure they would have the texture of a brownie!My changes were I melted my butter and only added one egg and used slightly a bit less flour.with my changes produced a Delicious,chewy like brownie! Wonderful!!!! And to the reviewers that said they were bland add a bit more spice to them!!! you cant go wrong with this recipe!!!

These are amazing!! Soft chewy and delicious! I would change the wording of the recipe to "spread the batter into the pan" instead of "pour the batter into the pan". The batter is very thick and not very pourable. I will definitely be making these again!

These were great. I love the idea of a something you can eat like a brownie but has a change from all the chocolate recipes out there. I think I undercooked mine a little bit but it was still great. When it came time to 'pour' the mix into the pan I thought perhaps I had made a mistake along the line as it was a thick batter that needed to be spooned into the pan and spread out. I think the wording was just a little off. I also had to use two cups of all purpose flour as I didn't have any whole wheat flour available. Still great but I might try to get some whole wheat flour for next time to see the difference. I also used golden syrup in place of molasses as that is what I had in the pantry. It was quick and easy to prepare before starting dinner. Thanks for a great recipe!

Mmm.  Yes.  Very much like a moist gingery blond brownie.  With the relatively low ratio of liquid to dry ingredients, you'll probably find yourself spreading instead of pouring the batter into the pan.  I'll probably add a whole tablespoon of ginger next time; if you, too, really love ginger, I'd go ahead and add that amount the first time you make this.  If you're looking for something that tastes a little more like a traditional ginger cookie, you might want to add some cinnamon and cloves as well.

Great recipe!  I used only white flour as I don’t like wheat.  Cooked for the exact time recipe state and they come out soft and chewy.  I did add 1tsp of ground clove and nutmeg and oh my gosh best ever.  My friends raved about them and asked for the recipe.

Make these bars!  My nephews love gingerbread, but this is a year-round and faster way... same flavor and so chewy.  I added cinnamon, cloves, ginger... all the gingerbread man spices, extra sugar, and cream cheese drizzle -so delicious!

Very good flavor as written, but here are the changes i felt it needed: reduce brown sugar to 1 1/4c (or maybe less), and at least a tablespoon of ginger. I was looking for even more spice, though,  so i upped mine to almost 2T. I didn't trust that there was enough batter for a 9x13 pan, but I should have...it rose a good bit and filled out more than I was expecting.

Great just as written, but amenable to personal tweaks as others have noted. A half teaspoon of cardamon works well, for example.

We both enjoyed these but then we both love ginger. I made this as written with the exception of a pinch of cloves. The texture was great and the baking time was bank on, 30 minutes. Thanks Jozi for the great recipe.

This could be very good, it has an interesting taste and great texture, however, there are some issues. 1. It is salty! I will only use 1/2 tsp. of salt next time. 2. It should bake for more than 30 minutes, more like 35-40 minutes. The batter looks like there is not enough liquid but when it bakes the consistency is excellent. 3.There is too much sugar. I reduced it by half a cup and it is as sweet as it should be.

Very nice texture, chewy. A little blander than I like, even with adding crystallized ginger.  Will increase ginger next time.

I made these to take to our fellowship time after our church service.  I was tempted to add some cinnamon and cloves, but decided to just stick with the ginger.  I'm very happy with these bars!  They are like gingerbread with a brownie-like texture.  They are dense, slightly chewy and oh, so good!  Ginger and molasses is just a great combo!  Thanks for the recipe, Jozi!

Definitely a great substitute when you want gingerbread cookies but don't feel like doing cut outs! I used all white flour because I didn't have wheat and they came out really well, just like a brownie in consistency. The only thing I didn't love was that the molasses flavor is very strong. I would cut back on it a bit if I made them again.

Yum!  The only change I made was to increase the ginger and add a pinch of cayenne as suggested by others. Gives it a subtle kick, not spicy but just a nice long gingery finish. You can taste the molasses as well, so they are a lovely fall and winter flavor. More light and cakey on the edges, more dense and chewy in the middle. Right on target for the baking time. Quick and easy and delicious!

I've been looking for this recipe my entire life.  I'm a ginger-aholic  and this recipe is so very satisfying for my  ginger addiction.  Another name could be ginger brownie, as it has the density of a brownie the day after you bake it. It was more cake-like warm from the oven. I ordered it the next day.

Love these, as did the rest of my family! I served them for our Christmas lunch and they were a hit! I did, however, have to leave them in the oven for about 40 mins. Also for the fun of it, I added a bag of pumpkin flavored candy chips, along with some cinnamon. I think next time I may try them plain. Oh I also used only all purpose flour and the consistency was that of a brownie! Very good recipe!

Not what I was expecting. I wasn't too crazy about the flavor of these. I thought they would be spicy like a gingersnap or sweet & moist like gingerbread, but they weren't either. They were also too dense & heavy for my taste.

These had the texture of chewy brownies - nice! I love molasses, so I enjoyed these bars. Four stars for the barely there ginger flavor. I may try again with fresh ginger and a bit of white pepper.

Made these as directed and drizzled icing from a spice bar recipe over the top. That wasn't enough help for these. They were bland. Won't be using this recipe again.
