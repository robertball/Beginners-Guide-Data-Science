I make these in the oven when I am using it for another dish.   I bake them for about an 45 minutes to an hour at what ever tempurature the other dish is cooking at, you can sqeeze them to see if there are tender.  I see that you vent the foil, if you don't vent you will not need the ice cube, I  also add pepper. If I am baking a chicken recipe I use a chicken bouillon instead of beef. Also make sure you put them in a oven safe dish, in case any of them leak.  Another tip is pre- cook the onions a little bit with the seasoning & butter in the microwave in a glass baking dish, then take them out and cover dish with foil and finish cooking them in the oven.

I have been making these "little-goodies" for years on the grill. If you like onion soup, you will love this.  Fresh pepper is good on them, no need for salt because of the bouillon cube.

This is actually a Paula Dean recipe and, as is the case with her version (Saturday Night Vidalias), sweet onions like Vidalias or Walla Wallas are the best prepared this way.  They can be served as a side dish, family style, or if your onions are smaller, as an individual side.  I would definitely omit the ice cubes.  Sweet onions produce plenty of their own liquid and, as another reviewer suggested, add fresh cracked pepper.  Yum.

This is wonderful! A friend of mine introduced me to this and my young daughter and I both found it delightful. For a little more flavor add a little garlic salt or powder to your onion before closing it up in the foil. You will need a bowl when it is ready plus, you will find that the liquid is good dripped over your steak or pork chop.

The recipe sounded really good but they turned out bland. I added a little brown sugar hoping the sweet would cook in with the butter and it was still bland. Would not make this again.

These were the BEST Grilled Onions!  My DH and I had them for dinner with a Vegetarian guest & they were a fabulous hit!  I cut the tablespoon of butter into quarters and used 1/4 to rub the outside of the onion before sprinkling the garlic powder over it for added flavor.  The butter added just the right amount of liquid added with the juice of the onion.  I cooked at 350 for 45 min and turned up to 400 for another 15 min.  They were just oh-so-perfectly cooked.  (with an ever-so-slight 'crunch' to them)  We used the leftover for our breakfast omelette the next morning!!!! YUMMY!  Will definitely make again, and again, and again!!!

These were great! My sister had told me about them & I had to try it. Great little side for any barbecue dinner - quick, easy & light - and a little something different to add to the mix. Thanks, Megoondas!

We made these for a "gourmet grilling night" with friends. They were a huge hit. We will be making them regularly for ourselves at home. They did have a wonderful french onion soup taste. Add a little cheese to the onion and it will be there!

Cooked one onion on our 3 burner Weber grill in between the first two burners for 30 minutes on medium. Could have gone longer. Still very firm. The ice cube was not needed. We also added fresh cracked pepper and grated gruyere, which was very good.

I used small Walla Walla onions with 1/2 cube chicken bullion cube, tablespoon of butter and a heaping spoon of jar minced garlic (you can never over-garlic something in our house). Foil wrapped on the grill for 45 minutes. Yumm!!! Definitely a new standard grill side  for us.

This was a great side dish to 'Smothered Filet Mignon', 'Grilled Rock Lobster Tails' both from AR and grilled Parmesan green beans.  I only made one onion for my husband and I to share.  The flavor was very good, but the beef bouillon made them salty.  I will made them again, but will be using low-sodium bouillon.  The onion I used wasn't huge, and it took about 35 minutes.  It was perfectly cooked without being the least bit mushy.

I've been making these for 15+ years and agree w/ the other reviewer - no need for the ice cube.  I sometimes omit the bouillon and they're still awesome!

These were great.  I did use a little less than a full reduced salt bouillon cube since I didn't want it too salty.  Will definitely do this again.

Really good. Try adding a tsp of brown sugar and a smidge of sherry cooking wine. I've also added a drop of gravy master. Suggest double wrapping the foil. I bake @ 325 for 35 min. before guests arrive and then a quick pre-heat on grill. (Heads up - don't prick foil to see if they are done.....leaking mess...lol) Wonderful!!! French Onion Soup indeed.

These have become a staple in our house.  The only addition - some sherry. Definitely don't need the ice cube when using sherry.

Great flavor out of our sweet onions. However, I found the ice cubes unnecessary. Also, even though we used fairly small onions, they weren't quite caramelized after 30 minutes. I will definitely make this again, but next time leave them on the grill for much longer. 

PS - we ate these with grilled steaks. Delicious combo!
