I didn't have trouble with the bars being soggy, but I did make sure to squeeze all the excess liquid out of the zucchini first, which may account for the other reviewers soggy bars.  I also didn't roll them in powdered sugar--they are quite sweet and don't really need it.  A really yummy way to use up those leftover zucchinis!

We liked these bars. The flavour was great but as the other review says they were a little cake like and soggy. You can really taste the honey which I like. I substituted rasins for the dates. The powdered sugar absorbed so I dont think I'll use it next time. I also might try adding some oats in hopes that they will turn about a little more dense.

I altered this recipe based on what I did and didn't have. I added 1 1/2 cup dates, no nuts, no powdered sugar,and whole wheat flour instead of white. I squeezed the water out of the zucchini as mentioned in the other comments. This is a very tasty way to get rid of zucchin, and I will make it again. It is very moist, which did not bother me.

I loved this recipe. It's not only easy to make, but easy to adjust to what's on hand. My husband is a baking "expert" and when he tested them he said this recipe is definitely a keeper! :-)

This is a very nice recipe! I made it exactly as presented and had no problems at all.  The only thing I did not do was the powdered sugar. This is a tasty treat!

Good recipe, full of good stuff!  I had to make a substitution because I had only 2 eggs, so I added a banana; then I realized I didn't have any butter, so I substitued olive oil, which was flavoured blood orange.  As a result, the bars turned out very sweet, but with a lovely orange flavour.  Looking forward to trying it again with the suggested ingredients.

Came out perfect! I didn't have dates or walnuts, so I substituted candied pineapple and cashews. I also forgot to squeeze out the juice form the zucchini, so I added in 1/4 c. of extra flour.

I also used whole wheat flour, and used egg beaters substitute for the eggs.  Cooked for about 32 minutes @ 325 .  Delicious, not soggy at all.

Let's just say that I'm back in the kitchen this morning making another batch.  My family tore it up.  I did what one of the reviews suggested - squeezed the zucchini to rid it of the excess liquid - so I had no problems with soggy bars.  And I left out the powdered sugar coating.  Like some one else said it really didn't need it.  I don't think I'm going to be able to freeze any of this zucchini(it was an 8 pounder) but that's ok.
