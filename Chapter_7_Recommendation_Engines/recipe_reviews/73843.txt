This recipe was well received at our Thanksgiving dinner.  I did make some changes for ease of serving a crowd.  After I halving the squash and removing the seeds, I sliced each half into quarter inch slices using an electric knife (amazingly easy!).  Then I arranged the slices in a single layer on parchment lined baking sheets and baked at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes.  I removed them from the oven and brushed with the apricot preserve/butter mixture and slipped the baking sheet under the broiler for a couple of minutes, or until brown.

Boy did I love this.  Really easy and delicious.  Used light apricot preserves and left out the butter -- didn't matter a bit.  Still very sweet and delicious.  I'll definately make this again!

I have only ever had acorn squash with brown sugar and butter, and so had my husband. We were both pleasantly surprised by this! A very delicious, not overly sweet flavor at all. My new favorite way to serve acorn squash!

This is a great recipe!  It takes a little longer to cook than given, and I leave out the salt, but I have made this twice and it is very good.  My kids love it.

Tasty, but had a difficult time getting the "meat" of the squash  soft enough to scoop from the shell, so I baked it 15 minutes longer, let it set a bit, then cut each half into thirds. That made it much easier to handle, and made a better presentation

Great! I used 2 tbsp of preserves, and could have done with even less -- maybe my squash wasn't very big. A nice change from S & P or maple syrup and butter. Thanks for the recipe. :)

I used a sugar-free apricot perserve and sprinkled about a 1/8 tsp of Splenda brown sugar mix on each halve.  I didn't have to cook it any additional time - mine was smaller than most squashes though - probably closer to three servings than four.  My husband hates new vegetables and he will definately eat this one again and it has really added some flair to our diets!

I really liked how this wasn't too sweet like the usual brown sugar recipes for squash.  It had a lovely hint of flavor that made the squash come alive.  Note, I only give 5 stars for the rare recipe that is to die for.

Yummy and easy.  I sometimes use orange marmalade instead of apricot preserves.

ALSO DELICIOUS WITH CURRY added to the apricot spread.  Found it in a Family Circle in late 2004 and I still have the tiny clipping in my recipe draw.      Just add 1/4 tsp black pepper  1/2 tsp salt  1/2 cup apricot preserves  1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted  1 and 1/2 tsp "Calcutta Heat" curry (or any old curry powder if yur not fancy)    "In a small bowl, combine apricot preserves (breaking up large chunks), butter, curry, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/8 of the pepper.  Mix well.    Spoon mixture over the baked acorn squash."    Enjoy!

My husband and I love this recipe. It is so very simple to make, and often we substitute butternut squash for the acorn type. We have it at least twice a month!

We realy prefer the brown sugar/butter kind of squash in this house.  This was kind of odd tasting.  Bummer too as I was hoping to find another way to prepare acorn squash.

Simple and yummy! I had to modify the recipe but the essence remained the same. I microwaved the squash on high for 10 min. to cook before adding the other ingredients and broiling. We don't eat dairy so I substituted coconut oil for the butter and I picked the recipe specifically so that I could use some of my giant stash of home-canned jams/preserves. I didn't have apricot so I used a peach/orange marmalade. My 7 year old said that the squash was so good that it was "paradise."

Simple. Awesome. Simply awesome. I also think this is good with butternut squash. And marmalade is a good filling, as well.

I make an even simpler version of this and any other acorn squash recipe.  I never bake squash in the oven. Instead I microwave it.  Follow your recipe for any squash dish, make sure the squash is halved and the seeds are removed.  Then oven bake on high for approximately 12-15 minutes (depending on size and how soft you like your squash.  Broil as directed for glazing.

Fantastic! I actually make 3 acorn squash today (6 halves). 2 I did with the traditional butter/brown sugar, 2 with this recipe and 2 with the Orange Baked Acorn Squash recipe (also from this site). All are delicious! Enjoy!

This was a yummy twist on acorn squash. Mine took a bit longer to bake but it was a pretty thick squash so the cooking time will depend on your squash. We loved the preserves and the sweet and tart it provided to the squash. Def a keeper.

This was delicous and easy; however, I couldn't get the little ones to eat it, even though I thought that they would like this.  Next time, I think that I will remove the skins and mash it a little for the kids. I personally preferred it with walnuts added.

Very nice and a good change from the standard brown sugar and butter squash. After the butter and preserves melted under the broiler, I spooned then over all of the cut sides and put it back under the heat. This allowed the squash to get a nice glaze.

Made this to accompany a brandied shrimp recipe and baked brown rice with toasted almonds and cranberries. It was wonderful! I had to cook it for 60 minutes at 375 degrees so that I could make the rice and squash at the same time in the oven, and it turned out perfect. My husband was apprehensive about the squash but said it was his favorite part of the meal. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

DELICIOUS!  I made this for my family Thanksgiving and got rave reviews!  I used SF Appricot preserves and no one could tell.   I also sprinkled on a few crushed walnuts before the final baking.  MMMM, will make again for sure!

Great idea.  Glad to have another way to cook squash.  I used sugar free preserves as we don't eat sugar and added a little brown sugar Splenda.  I was worried about the topping being a little bland and sweet, so I blended  a touch of cayenne pepper and salt with the preserves.  A hit at our table.  Thanks for the idea.

Great recipe Edith! I suggest using Apple butter and a few of those yellow apples you might have around. Peel and cut into bite size pieces, mix with the AB and pop it into the oven for another 10 or 15 minutes (till those apple bites are nice and soft). Makes a tasty side or top with vanilla Ice cream for a new dessert treat!

This was excellent! I microwaved the squash cut-side down for about 10-ish minutes instead of baking it in the water. I don't think it compromised the flavor and it was done so much faster. Plus, added about 1/2 tbs more of the apricot preserves to the butter/preserves mixture! It was so yummy! I'll definitely be making this again!

This is a quick and easy to prepare recipe, that I have made often, especially in the fall.  After I cut the acorn squash in half, I make a small slice off the bottom, so that when I set the squash open side up, it sets flat and level so the contents won't spill out.  (I also do this when I make deviled eggs, so they sit flat without tipping over.)  I have also used different preserves, like peach, with a 1/2 tablespoon of real butter (not margarine).  I have also added a few chopped pecans, yummy!

This turned out really tasty.  I made it last night and it's completely gone already.  I used Smucker's Simply Fruit Apricot Spreadable Fruit to cut down on the sugar.  My garden is currently cranking out acorn squash, so I think I will try it with other jams/jellies/spreads I have on hand.

Really good.... When hubby first saw it he asked what was inside of it. When I told him it was  jelly he started scooping it out without even trying it. Then he tasted some of it with jelly on it by accident, then started scooping the jelly back into it. Lol .... Really good!!!!!

This is an awesome recipe that combines sweet and savory so well.  A great twist on an autumn classic.
