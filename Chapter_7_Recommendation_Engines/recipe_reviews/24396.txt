A few simple changes easily elevated this 3-star recipe to 4-stars, and darned near to perfect.  To begin with, as I was measuring out the carrots, I stopped at about 1/4 cup, thinking that using a full cup of carrots would be waaaaay too much.  I filled the remainder of the 1-cup measuring cup with celery and we loved the addition/substitution.  With not much in the way of diverse and complex flavors going on here, I thought it was important to make the very most of the flavors I DID have - namely, substituting a good chicken broth for the water and chicken bouillion called for and adding fresh minced garlic to the onions as they were being sweated out.  Finely, while straight Cheddar is inarguably the best for flavor, replacing half of it with processed cheese (i.e. Velveeta) ensures a rich creaminess that is virtually guaranteed not to break down and separate.  Several good shakes of salt and freshly ground pepper and we were rewarded with a rich, creamy, flavorful and comforting broccoli cheese soup.  I garnished it with a crostini topped with a sprinkle of grated Cheddar cheese and a tiny broccoli floret.  This, along with "Greek Chicken Wraps," also from this site, was a nourishing, easy, and laid back supper.

I love the fact that it doesn't use "processed cheese food" as that is just wrong. Anyway, yummy! A few changes: I was out of carrots, though I didn't miss them I'm sure they would have added a great flavor. I used homemade chicken stock instead of boullion. I also used my immersion blender to blend the broccoli/stock mixture. Lastly, after reading the reviews that it was too thick, I used equal amount of chicken stock and milk and the consistency was perfect. I will make this again, and again, and again...

This is absolutely the best cheese soup recipe I have ever tried.  It is incredibly good by itself but especially good with a crusty bread.  I have made it with celery instead of broccoli and if anything, it's better.  My whole family raves about this.

Great soup. It uses common ingredients and is fairly simple and quick to make. It didn't taste much like cheese (I didn't use sharp; sharp recomended), but it was still very good. I used 1 bouillon cube instead of the 1 tsp granuals. 

This recipe is also very adaptable. I have substituted potatoes and celery for the broccoli and left out the cheese to make a wonderful potato soup. Add a can of minced clams for clam chowder. Plus, it is easy to adjust the yield; simply add more vegetables, bouillon, and milk.

Ah, when company shows up unnanounced and you scramble to make something delicious out of pantry/fridge staples. :) This simple recipe is great without revisions. As I do with nearly all cheese dishes, I added about 2 tbsp. hot sauce - LOVE the flavor of hot sauce with extra-sharp cheddar. I also love that this recipes uses real cheese instead of processed. If there are concerns about texture breakdown, whisking the cheese in gradually instead of adding all at once ensures a perfectly smooth texture.

This was really good.  I added 1/2 pound of bacon, used bacon grease instead of butter, celery instead of broccoli, and added 1/4 tsp dry mustard.  I served it in bread bowls and got great reviews from everyone.

This is simply the best cheese soup recipe I have ever had.  Instead of chicken broth I use vegetable broth (ovo-lacto vegetarian) and it is incredibly delicious.

I made this with cauliflower and carrots and it was very tasty and filling.  It was a bit bland, so I think I will play with the seasonings next time.  I also put the cauliflower and carrots through the food processor before cooking, to make for a smoother soup.

Very good!  Came out a little thin and the vegetables were too crunchy for my liking.  Would cook them a little longer next time.

Excellent soup AS IS!!!!  I have made it several times just as the recipe states and it is one of my FAVORITE soups on this site.  I have also simply added 1/4 cups chopped celery to it with a little more water and it's delicious as well.  Delicious with a perfect consistency!

Wow - this soup was awesome! I did make a few modifications - first I used about 3/4 - 1 cup of onions (onion lover), 1 1/2 tsp of bouillon and I used celery instead of broccoli. I had to add more water to the flour and butter because the onions soaked up most of the liquid. This recipe was so good that I plan to make it a staple in our home. Thanks!!

This is a very simple, yummy soup.  I do however wish that it had just a little stronger of a cheese flavor, although my 11 year old didn't miss it.  I'm going to try extra sharp cheddar next time.  Thanks Rachel!

Great recipe! I really like how this recipe actually uses real cheese. I used vegetable broth instead of both the water and bouillion to make it vegetarian. I also added 1 more cup of liquid to the vegetables and after they cooked I pureed them in a blender. I topped off bowls of this soup with some extra shredded cheese and it was delicious!

This recipe provided me and my girlfriend the best cheese soup I've ever had... However, I do have one suggestion: I'm a vegetable lover, so I prefer to add greater portions of vegetables than the recipe calls for.  :)

Being a WI girl, I had to try this.  I was looking for a recipe to use up some left over cooked broccoli that I had in the frig, and this was perfect.  I, too, like that it didn't use processed cheese (something is just not right about that stuff).  This took about 20 minutes to make, and it made exactly enough for the four of us for dinner tonight.  Bought some crusty french bread this morning that will go great with this.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm from Wisconsin, and my mom used to make cheese soup when I was growing up I thought I'd see if there was anything else out there better, and this comes close. I like the addition of the broccoli (mom wasn't big on veggies). I make mine a bit thinner than this one, with equal parts chicken broth and milk. To avoid the clumping of the cheese, add it very slowly and stir in gradually as it melts.

This recipie was so easy.  I have a very picky family and they all gobbled it up.  I used sharp cheddar, but I bet it would be good with any kind of cheddar.  It was a good recipie to serve after watching the football games on Sunday.

I made a broccoli soup recently with the block cheese and I have to say, this was much, much better. The block was too rich and the sharp toned it down to a really good soup.  Followed the recipe's exact ingredients, except I put carrots and broccoli in the ninja before adding to the chicken broth.  This made it creamier, which is our style of soup.  Thank you so much for sharing.  I will definitely use this recipe again when it comes to getting my children to eat their broccoli!

Yummy very good.  I sauted the carrots with the onions and added some celery  and garlic to the pan.  I also added 1/2 cup of dark beer. Finished it off during the last few minutes of cooking with garlic powder, onion powder and season salt. This was yummy.  I have one child that is not so keen on broccoli so I blended the soup up in the blender and all the ingredients were chopped up and this was more like a smooth soup. Very good and I will make again. Topped with green onions, mozarella cheese, and croutons.

This was super easy and fast to make.  Tasted really good.  Replaced half of the carrot with celery.  I feel like this needs beer in it, just because it has Wisconsin in its name.  Maybe I will try steaming the veggies with a bottle of Spotted Cow next time :)

Simple but good. I was searching for a recipe that didnt use processed "cheese food."  I like the broccoli in here. The sliced carrots were a bit too big, next time I think I will dice them. You could probably thicken this with mashed potatoes. But I like this the way it is. Thank you.

This recipe is great! I used swanson broth instead of the granules and also added extra toward the end of cooking time since the soup was so thick! I followed the recipe pretty closely adding only garlic salt and using less cheese than recommended (approximately 1 1/4 cup of SHARP cheddar) I enjoyed this so much and I'm really glad to have found a broccoli soup recipe that doesn't use nasty fake cheese. Thanks!!

This was really good AFTER it stewed for an hour or so. Use half the cheese and it's a good broccoli soup.

This recipe is so good I didn't have all the ingredients and it was still AWESOME!  I didn't have 2 cups of cheddar cheese so I had to use 1 cup cheddar, 4 slices of American singles, and some Parmesan to make up the 2 cups of cheese.  I like soup blended so I gave it a few seconds with a hand blender.  Delicious!

Yum yum yum! I added red bell peppers to the veggies when boiling in the first step. Everything else the same, except my family loves black pepper so I added more than called for. It turned out fabulous! My mom is still asking me to make it again and again!! Mmmmm Mmmmm Good!!!

Very good soup. I also added cauliflower. It was part of a mixed, fresh cut up bag of veggies I had bought. I would make this again, maybe added cooked chicken. But it's good just like this too.

Great soup, especially for cold weather.  Recommend that you chop vegies fairly small so they fit on spoon nicely.  DON'T use low-fat or non-fat cheese; they don't melt right and you'll get a mess.  I took the advice of other reviewers and increased the liquid.  Instead of 2 cups milk, I added 1 can chicken broth and 1 cup evaporated milk.  Very smooth and satisfying soup.  Thank you, Rachel.

This was wonderful~ a nice creamy, filling soup.  I didn't have the fresh veggies the recipe called for, so I pureed a bag of broccoli/carrot mix in my food processor and used it instead.  My soup was pretty thick~ (maybe because I changed the veggies?)  more like a cheese sauce~ so I added about two cups of chicken broth and then it came out perfectly.   This recipe is definitely a keeper- thanks for sharing!

I love this soup. I added a little worchestershire and a dash of seasoned salt and it was delicious. I have also added potatoes for a different twist. I have made on several occasions and we love it. Tastes better than some that we have had in restaurants. Very easy to make.

I hate to rate it  a 5 because I changed a lot of things but it was so good that I just have to. First, I threw broccoli, onion, celery and a few peeled and diced potatoes went in the pot. Covered with water just to cover it and threw 3 chicken bullion cubes in.  For the onion and cheese part, I used 1/3 flour, 1% milk (although you probably could use half n half or heavy cream if you're not too concerned about calories) and a cup of Velveeta, only because I had a little bit left, and about a cup of shredded sharp cheddar --adding the cheese slowly . Next time I will use only the sharp cheddar as I'm not a huge Velveeta fan.  Put in a teaspoon or so of minced garlic and the pepper to taste. Threw everything together and let  it simmer a bit.  Next time I'll add even more veggies! You won't be disappointed with this one!

Four stars for simplicity, good consistency, and delicious flavour. It was very quick and easy, I'm typing this while eating a second bowlful, I cant wait to try the variations described in the reviews with celery, stronger cheese, and maybe even some bacon.

This is my go-to recipe when a big bag of broccoli is in the fridge.  I don't add as much cheese though.  It doesn't really need it.  I like the other veggies in it, too.

Very good.  I used a bit more brocolli.  The soup is pretty thick, so I added a little milk at the end to thin it down a little.  Next time I will probably double the water and bouillon (since I add more brocolli).  Flavor was great.  I made garden salads to go along with it, and warm crusty bread.  My 3 year old and husband loved this as well.

Simple, quick, and delicious!  I added a chicken bouillon cube to my own homemade veggie stock and used a mix of sharp cheddar and pepper jack cheeses.  I was pleasantly surprised how nicely this soup came together. Easy and it's homemade!

This is the BEST! Added a few flares of my own! I added white pepper and pressed garlic.  Instead of regular onion I used green onion.  OHHH my kids loved it!

This is one of my favorite soups, the proportions are perfect. Don't use anything but SHARP cheddar, and fresh broccoli is nicer than using frozen.

I thought this was a good base recipe.  I did however make a few changes. 1. I added 1/4 cup chopped celery to the saute and shredded the carrots 2. I doubled the broccoli 3. I added a 1/8 cup more of flour 4. I used chicken broth instead of water and bouillon and actually used 4 cups of the liquid 5. I used 1 cup sharp cheddar along with 1 cup of velveeta 6. I added 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg (I know it sounds weird but when adding nutmeg to broccoli dishes it adds just that extra bit of something.  It doesn't taste like nutmeg but you just have to try it!

Used one cup chicken broth instead of bouillon. Otherwise followed exactly then used hand blender just to make for a thicker consistency. (Did not grind up everything, so still chunky.) The cheese taste was just right, not overwhelming. Loved it.

I am surprised at all the rave reviews this recip has received. I normally agree with the All Recipe fellow cooks, but this time I guess I am in the minority.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using celery instead of broccoli and it was just OK.  I won't be making this again.

Super easy, and good.  Start with the one cup of stock as recommended and keep an extra one on hand so you can change the consistency to your liking. Glad to find a recipe that uses fresh vegetables and real cheese. Thanks.

I really wanted to like this recipe. I was searching for a cheese and broccoli soup that didn't rely on processed cheese - my mistake! Processed cheese works much better for a creamy soup like this. That said, the vegetables were wonderfully tender yet crisp, and it's an easy soup to make.

My children hated this.  That just means that it had taste.  This was by far the easiest soup i have made in ages.  I had a party last night and had cheese, veggie tray and all kinds of things left over... everything went right into the soup.  Rich, creamy... just right.  The only thing i added was cayenne pepper but i like everything with hot pepper in it.

Very quick, very tasty.  Added more broccoli and omitted carrots, because I was looking for a broccoli cheese soup that did NOT call for processed cheese, this was perfect!  Will probably add a bit more salt/spice next time.

This soup is OK, but it's basically broccoli cheese soup.  I like that it uses real cheese instead of Velveeta.  I'd rather have had smaller pieces of broccoli and carrot, so if I make it again, I'll use matchstick cut carrots and chop the broccoli.  This did NOT freeze well.

everyone is right when they say this is the best cheese soup you will eat. my son ate 5 helpings at dinner and then ate the last bowl before he went to bed. he said it was the best soup he has ever eaten. i did add a few things though. i added a couple extra chicken cubes. i also added celery and blanched broccoli at the end. i sliced and pre cooked and drained of fat smoked sausage. it made a very hearty chowder on a cold night.  a must to try.

This was very good...I never had a soup like this before.  I did add more broccoli and used whole baby carrots instead of sliced.  Also, be sure to whisk the flour and milk so you don't end up with "lumps".  My family enjoyed this soup....Thank you for sharing..

Wow, this tasted great - I added extra onions and broccoli. However, it was so dense! And the main problem with this soup was that after eating it, everyone had bad indigestion troubles. So make this if you are not going to be in polite company, or don't mind the house smelling for some time. It does taste great and is very filling!

An excellent soup, though I made a few modifications.  I added garlic powder and white pepper, and a little dry mustard.  Also added celery and potatoes.  I think it needed about half again as much cheese for good flavor, or maybe I will try extra-sharp cheese as suggested by other cooks.  I will make this again!

Real cheese veggie soup!! Love that its made with REAL cheese, and several veg's, nit just broccoli. Could easily add cauliflower, potatoes, peas, green beans and more- easy soup base . Cooking the vegetables in the broth gave them perfect texture and flavor. just be sure not to overcook (5 minutes was perfect).

This recipe for broccoli cheddar soup was Ah-Mazing! I pretty much followed the recipe provided with a few small changes: I did use some shredded Velveeta in addition to the cheddar (processed faux cheese I know, sigh... but it had been hanging out in the fridge from a previous recipe & although it would probably keep for the next 7 yrs I wanted to use it up). I also used an extra cup of milk when I got to that step. Needless to say this came out great and I would absolutely make it again. Thanks for sharing ??

This soup is quick and delicious and uses common ingredients - and REAL cheese! I didn't have cheddar; used Colby. So to bump up the flavor, added a pinch of salt and a few shakes of Frank's hot sauce.  Also found it to be a little thick, so added a little more milk to get a better consistency.  Used leftover broccoli - hate to  waste food - and added it near the end so it was not too mushy.

This recipe was great!  I used some of the suggestions and made a few shortcuts of my own and am really happy with the outcome.  I'm excited to finally have a recipe for this soup that actually uses real cheese!

A nice Cheese soup and I too like others, appreciate the fact that you use real cheese instead of many that call for Velveeta.  I did keep to the recipe, but did add just a tad extra bit of water and I only had 1-3/4 cup of sharp cheddar so I subbed the rest with some mexican mix I had on hand.  My daughter was hesitant about the carrots but really enjoyed them once she tried. The reason for the 4 was that I thought it was just a tad blander than I like. I also added some salt at the end. On my second bowl I added a pinch of thyme, that added a nice touch.  Next time I might even try adding some pepper flakes, I just like to try and stay on the recipe with out changes the first time I try it so I can truly rate the recipe.

This recipe is great tasting as is, but I always try to find ways to make it healthier.  I used half olive oil and half butter.  It made a great rue.  I also used whole wheat flour instead of white, and mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar.  I would rather have the cheddar; the taste is better with cheddar, but my husband's heart will be happier with the mozzarella. I also used the "Better than Boullion" paste instead of granules for better flavor.  I also used half skim and half coconut milk.  Next time I will try all coconut milk, since the fat in coconut milk is much healthier than cow's milk.  

It took me about 45-60 min. to make, but was very easy.

This recipe was ok. Not as good I thought it would be and I followed the recipe to a T. Except I used rice flour (Gluten free). I always feel like pre-shredded cheddar cheese is always grainy and not very smooth. Saving my left overs but will most likely not make again.

Best cheese soup recipe I've used! Of course, I did alter it. I used the basic formula and just changed the veggies and cheeses to what I had on hand. For veggies I used celery, carrots and green beans simmered in vegetable broth. Instead of butter I used bacon fat and garlic olive oil. For cheese I used horseradish cheddar and Neufchatel cream cheese. At the end I gave it a sprinkle of dill and went heavier on the black pepper. Fantastic!!!! The texture is perfection.

Sooo good.  We have made a lot of different variations of broccoli cheese soup, but this is by far the best.  We had a party on Halloween and one of the last guests to leave was drinking pretty heavily.  We gave this to him to help sober up.  A few weeks ago he told us it was the best soup he ever had (nearly 6 months later)!

I did not like this soup. It didn't taste like the wisconsin cheese soup that I'm use to. Ya its quick and easy to make. There were a few things that I would have done different when I made it. I would have gradually added the cheese and not cooked it on such a high heat either.

This soup is amazing and so simple to make!!  The only changes i made were -- instead of 2 cups of milk i used one cup low fat milk and one cup fat free creamer.  I also added in some chopped spinach.

This is a delicious and simple soup to make.  I needed to use up a lot of broccoli, so I quadrupled the veggies, milk and water.  I only doubled the roux to save on fat and calories; it is still creamy, but not too thick (just the way we like it!).

I made this tonight and it was delicious!  Made some changes.  Added 2 cooked, cubed chicken breasts, didn't have carrots so I used sliced zucchini, and added about a cup more cheese.  It was easy and tasted great.  Will definitely make again and continue to try variations.

This soup was super easy.....Not like St.Louis Bread Co. soup, but close to it. I used the california mixed veggies instead of just broccoli and carrots to make it heartier. This I will make again!

Good soup. My family enjoyed it. I used skim milk and reduced fat cheddar cheese. Didn't come out as creamy as I had hoped probably because of the cheese but still good.

I thought this soup was really good. I added about 1/4 tsp of nutmeg but I think I would add a little more next time and I would definitely add more veggies, as it really didn't call for enough. It was delicious!

I added garlic and 2 cups broth/2 cups milk (as was recommended) and substituted mushrooms for carrots. It was awesome!

It's good, but I feel that it needs some added spices -- I'm just not sure what. I added garlic, Adobo salt, marjoram and a little cayenne.

Very good. My husband and I enjoy this soup for lunch on cold days. I always serve it with homemade garlic and cheese bread. I love the fact that it has added veggies to it and is not just cheese.

I added flour near the end to try to thicken it up and the texture turned out a little grainy like.  I don't know if that was from the flour or if the cheese seperated.  It was good though, but I thought it would be a little more flavorful.  I will try it again, but add some more chicken broth or something next time.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  It was so filling; it was the first time my husband was actually full before he could even ask for seconds, he can put away some food.  I was most excited about the fact that it called for sharp cheddar cheese and not American cheese.  I added garlic and cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit.  It was a little thick so I added a little chicken broth too.  I can't wait until I can make this again!

Absolutely delicious! I added a little softly cooked turkey bacon for a smokey taste. My two year old daughter and I finished the whole pan! Fresh veggies, real cheese, and complete satisfaction. Can't wait to make again!

This was good, really cheesy!  I used red potatoes instead of brocolli and added some garlic powder.  We ate it with Ritz Crackers.  Alot of reviewers said it was too thin. So, I put the milk in 1 cup at a time and let it thicken.  It took longer to prepare but it was worth it.  Will make it again.

Perfect on a cold winter night.  It is just as good with all broccoli and can also be made with 1 c chicken broth instead of the water/bouillon mix.  Great soup!

My family loved this recipe and I have to say it was really easy to make.  Really thick and creamy.  I read the reviews afterwards and think it would be really good with bacon added, as one reviewer suggested.  Will definitely make again!

Great soup! I did take some other suggestions and added more bouillon and water. I also added some zucchini. I cooked the veggies for another 5 minutes in order to get them to the tenderness that I wanted. Will make again.

I made this recipe without the carrots and added lots of garlic powder.  I didn't particularly like the soup but my husband did and said he would have given it five stars, except that he didn't like the texture of the broccoli in the soup.  I may try it again...

This was okay.  It had a gritty/rough texture to it.  The soup became extremely thick shortly after it was put on the table.  I will most likely never make it again.

Maybe I did something wrong, but my cheese tried to return to its prior shape!  It melted fine, but once off the heat it began to come back together and get sticky and stringy.  It was a gloppy mess that stuck to our spoons and was hard to eat.  Flavor was fine, but would not make again.

Verrrry good and yummy! We tried adding some worchestire sauce and some cayenne pepper as well. (We only tried that on half of the batch.) I also used homemade chicken stock, since I had some on hand. Wow! This soup is perfect either way (with the add-ins or not!)

This was wonderful! I added more broccoli - like 3 cups and about a half cup more of carrots. I made the simple whole wheat bread recipe to go with this. Such a good meal. I will definitely be making this again.
