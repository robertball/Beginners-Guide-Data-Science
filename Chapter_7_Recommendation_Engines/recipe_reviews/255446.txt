When my son was heading back to college after a visit home, I wanted to send a healthy meal back with him.  I thought this would fit the bill and it did! I sent one with him and kept one for myself. The only change I made was keeping the dressing separate from  the chicken, added a little Dijon mustard, and putting  the dressing in the jar first.  To keep apples from turning brown, I will chop them up and soak them in a lemon-lime soda for a few minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a "healthy lunch swap" at work. It was well received!
