This is not a 'five-star vegan recipe' but a straight five-star recipe. 

I used:
An 8oz unsweetened (bitter) baker's chocolate cocoa bar.
Adam's (all natural) creamy p/b.
Trader Joe's Grade B Organic Maple Syrup. 

I got rave reviews from everyone that tried the fudge. I cut it smaller than the listed serving size due to the richness. It has a deeper-darker taste that is best enjoyed in small savory bites.

I have made this recipe a few times and it is always amazing!  Always requests it at family gatherings.  It is super quick to make and put together; I always use a 6x9 pan and the pieces come out pretty thick.  Make sure that you use real maple syrup, not the Mrs. Butterworth's kind, I could see that giving an off maple flavor.  This recipe has never failed for me.

I used 8 oz semi-sweet chocolate, regular creamy peanut butter and Grade A Maple syrup. This may or may not be the best fudge in the world, depending on your definition of fudge, but it did what it was supposed to do. Only licking the cooled spoon silenced the chocolate craving monster until next time. I didn't find the maple syrup overwhelming at all. In fact you might really have to pay attention to discover it's there. Stir until everything is melted and combined. Pour in a dish and refrigerate. Couldn't be easier. A child could make it. Good job!

This recipe is awesome.  I made it for my sister because she is eating Vegan for Lent. She, her boyfriend, and I all loved it.  Can taste the chocolate and peanut butter strongly.  I used pure maple syrup and really couldn't taste it.  Also I used semi-sweet baking chocolate squares instead of chips.  I also added a few handfuls of cashews to add a nice surprise.  I definitely will be making this again.  And for those without a double boiler I used a pot about half full of water and put a stainless steel mixing bowl on top of it.  That worked great.

I don't have a double boiler yet - so I melted this in the microwave. I mixed the ingredients well in a glass bowl and microwaved for one minute then removed it and stirred alot. I repeated that once more and it became a beautiful, thick yet light, creamy hot fudge. The dominant flavour was chocolate, then peanut butter and I couldn't really tell it was maple syrup that gave it its sweetness, but I did use 100% pure Canadian Maple syrup. I also used grated dark, callebaut chocolate instead of chocolate chips. As a sauce it was delicious - hopefully I can wait the six hours to let it solidify. :) ***Update*** Once solid, it is still delicious however, I would not call it fudge. It is more like a soft chocolate square - kind of like the Moritz Icy Squares you can buy. Super yummy and super rich - so cut into small pieces. :)

I made this, and it tasted like pure maple syurp. It was also a very strange consistency...kind of like greasy play dough. It would be great for someone who really loves maple syrup, but if not it's awful. I made it for a vegan pot luck, but had to go out and buy a fruit tray instead.

Tried last nite. Used Peter Pan creamy peanut butter, Nestles semi-sweet choc. chips & real Vermont maple syrup. Put in an 8x8 pan. Wonderful!! Can't taste the maple syrup but wonderfully creamy. May try chunky peanut butter next time. A Keeper for sure!

So easy and delicious! Tastes just like a peanut butter cup. The fact that this is vegan is just a bonus for my vegan friends. It is great to have something so delicious from only 3 ingredients!

I really liked this. It was so easy! I made it during the same time I made hamburger helper! And it was delicious! I added a dash or two of vanilla extract in mine as well. I could see you being able to add any kind of nuts and things like that too.

This was very easy, and I loved the texture and flavor of the resulting fudge. I replaced half of the chocolate chips with unsweetened bakers chocolate, and thought the bittersweet flavor was just right.

This depends entirely on one's tastes, but I didn't care for the maple syrup in this recipe. It imparted a semi-acrid flavor that couldn't quite overcome the chocolate and peanut butter. Not bad, but not outstanding.

Easiest dessert I have ever made. Most difficult thing: deciding which pan to put it in! Used semi sweet chocolate chips from See’s candies, MaraNatha creamy peanut butter and Grade A maple syrup. Tastes like there is plenty of sweetness to this yummy fudge!

I used corn syrup instead of maple, since most of my family doesn't like maple syrup. Worked great.
