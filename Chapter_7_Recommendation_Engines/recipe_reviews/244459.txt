Ok so made as is, it’s a tad dry. I adjusted recipe as follows. I store bought pizza dough and let it rise with some olive oil in the cookie sheet I cooked it in, stretched and pre-baked for 10 min. I had to figure out a way to make a savory sauce but not pizza sauce because I felt the recipe was too dry the first time without some type of sauce. I whipped up some type of creamy mock Alfredo sauce using mayo, sour cream, cream, garlic, salt and pepper. (I know right) i used it as the bottom layer, then topped that with American cheese slices, then shaved steak mixture, then sautéed onion, green peppers and mushroom and finished it off with mixed pizza cheese. For added flavor I put some basil, red pepper flakes and salt and pepper. Baked at 425 for 12 min and broiled on high for an additional 3-4 min to crisp the crust. It was AMAZING!

Someone commented that green peppers don't belong on a Philly Cheesesteak...I say NONSENSE to that.  The _best_ Philly Cheesesteaks _do_ include the peppers.   (also...the _best_ cheesesteak sandwiches are not even made in Philly!)

The idea behind this pizza is good but the execution, not so much. After I got done sauteing everything, I had enough ingredients for two pizzas, but I continued to follow the recipe as written. Because there was so much on the pizza, the dough only cooked on the outside 1' ring and everything else was very doughy. The flavor was ok. Reminiscent of philly cheesesteak, but kind of bland. The chewy, partially cooked pizza dough, though, made this pizza inedible for us.

I thought this was okay but a bit of salt, ground pepper, and garlic powder on the meat before frying might help the overall taste.

I made changes to it. Replaced the white American cheese and Mexican cheese with mozzarella.  Gotta keep it real!  It was awesome!  YUM!

Dang, this was GOOD and very filling.  A reviewer said it was dry but I didn't find that to be the case.  I only used 6-7 slices of American Cheese, not 12. I had the sliced steaks (like Steak-Ums) and used 4 of them.  Did not have the pepper so I didn't use that.  A true Philly cheesesteak does NOT have green peppers as one reviewer said.  It's the steak and usually Cheez Whiz.  No other toppings.  I did saute the onion and mushrooms.  I can't wait to make this again.  Was so hungry when I made it so I had 2 slices.  One slice would have been enough.  It really was filling.  Thank you so much for posting this!

prep work took more time and I made it with homemade gluten free pizza dough.  Will pre-back crust next time to improve crispness.  It was definitely worth the effort.  White American cheese was only available at the deli counter. Will make again

Pretty good flavors but on the dry side. If I would have had some boss sauce or country sweet sauce on hand adding a drizzle of it on top would have helped.

I will certainly make this pizza again!  I could not find white American Cheese so used white shredded cheddar cheese and followed the directions except for that using green peppers and mushrooms!  It was delicious!

It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't terrific either. I probably won't make this again. I prefer meals that make eaters happy rather than just a shrug of their shoulders (which is what happened).

Absolutely loved it!! I’m not a fan of veggies so I completely ignored that part of the recipe, added some black pepper, and it turned out tasting so amazing! The only thing I’d do differently is check on it at around 10 minutes because 15 nearly burnt my crust. That could just be my own oven though..
