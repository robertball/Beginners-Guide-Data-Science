although this was easy to make, it had very little flavor. i finally added some chicken broth, more pepper, salt, dry mustard and my own home made hot sauce which gave it some more zing. i would not make this again since i spent more time trying to doctor it up then it took to make in the first place....penny c.

I did not like this soup at all. I hate the taste of beer, and it was a little too strong for me. Probably won't be making this again.
