This stuffing is awesome! I made it for Thanksgiving.  My mother-n-law always made cornbread stuffing every Thanksgiving, and she passed away this year, I wanted to make this for my husband.  It is a lot of work but worth it.  I chopped all the vegetables, herbs, and garlic & put in a freezer bag the day before (took a full hour since I don't have a food processor) so it was a breeze the next day putting it all together.  I was hesitant to use 7 eggs, but it turned out fantastic. I did not stuff the turkey, I just baked it in a greased casserole dish on 350 for about an hour.  The flavor is incredible.  I cut up the leftover stuffing into squares and wrapped individually in sandwich bags & then put all in a freezer bag. Thanks Kevin.  This will become a regular at our house!

My in-laws loved this so much that they have deemed it the "new Thanksgiving tradition"!  Yes, LOTS of chopping to do but well worth it.  I saved some time by substituting dried herbs for fresh (1 T fresh = 1 t dried).  Cooking the spices in the butter first really allows the flavor to get into every bite of the cornbread.  It was a little tricky to fish out the bay leaves after the cornbread went in.  Next time, I'll pull them out before adding the cornbread.  I made this the night before Thanksgiving, put it in a 9x13 pan, and baked in the oven for an hour or so.  It was a great twist on a classic, added a new taste to the meal, and turned out fabulously!

This is a LOT of work, but very good.  Here is a tip for making it though, I have several picky family members who do not even eat stuffing because it has too many chunks of things that they do not like, so I minced everything.  The result was fabulous! I did eliminate the cayenne pepper all together and I would recommend that if you make it this way, don't add the salt at all.  The recipe has so many spices that it does not need the salt.

I just wanted to say thanks to Kevin for submitting this recipe.  I am an American living in the UK, and so throw a Thankgiving bash here as an excuse to have a party.  I made this stuffing because it just sounded so good.  It was incredible.  Everyone who attended said it was the best stuffing they'd ever tasted.  I'll be using this recipe again and again.

We make this stuffing EVERY year!!! It is fabulous. The zing is what makes this stuffing great. If you do not want to make your cornbread from this recipe, we find it easier to use 2 bags of bagged stuffing and 1 bag of cubed stuffing from the grocery store instead and THAT will save lots of time and work. The outcome is incredible. We think you will love too if you are looking to have a not so traditional stuffing that your family will enjoy.

I have made this my signature stuffing for Thanksgiving (past 2 yrs);1st time: I made it went by the recipe, 2nd time: I decided to lessen the chicken broth and evaporated milk. My hubby preferred the second version, even though he liked the first one.

Being born and raised in New Orleans, I was excited about this recipe.  However, I was very disappointed.  The cornbread itself was pretty good, and the seasonings were okay.  But the texture of the dressing was awful.  I couldn't think of how to describe it until I read someone else's review saying it was like oatmeal.  Exactly!  Gummy.  I like a more grainy texture.  Sheesh, I hate being the "Debbie Downer."

My friend in Wisconsin made this recipe to celebrate Mardi Gras.  She made it for approximately 20 people, so she had to cut back on the spice. I am from the south, and I have two tried and true recipes that do not even come close to this one!  I have never had anything better.  This stuffing was amazing!  Thanks Kevin!

This was a good recipe and I will probably make again.   May try the cornbread mix next time instead of making the cornbread from scratch.  Cut the cayenne in half as others suggested and did not find this to be an overly spicy recipe.  I think the amount of wet ingredients (chicken broth & evaporated milk) could be reduced slightly as the stuffing was a bit moist after baking (in the turkey).  Also, you can definitely cut this recipe in half!  The "makes 10 cups" version made a ton of stuffing!  Overall a good recipe.

This is the best! It is a little spicy so if you don't like that, TRY IT ANYWAY! just cut back on the spice a tad.

this recipe was great.  i was a little skeptical at first cause i've never had cornbread stuffing before.  i didn't stuff the turkey though.  i used it as a side dish.  i had to cook it longer so that it would firm up and i wanted to make sure the eggs were done.  i baked it in a casserole dish for about an hour longer.  this was a huge holiday hit.  i would definitely make this again next year. 

forgot to say that i used store bought cornbread to save time and i only used 5 eggs.

despite omitting the jalepno peppers this dish was still spicy hot.  However I really did like it.  I served with a crown roast pork.  I will definetly make again however for myself and my family's sake I will cut down the cayenne pepper to 1 teaspoon.

Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!  I made this recipe last year and it was a HUGE hit with my family.  It was our first year having Thanksgiving at home (instead of with grandparents) so I had never made stuffing before... but this recipe is almost impossible to mess up.  Being from the South, this recipe was actually not quite spicy enough for me so I was a bit more liberal with the cayenne pepper as well as adding about 1 tsp of paprika and about 1/4 cup of chives to the recipe.  The spices are easily adjusted to your own personal taste without taking away from the recipe itself.  In fact, I just hopped on to double-check the recipe so I can make it again this year!  Definitely a keeper for a spiced-up Holiday meal.

One of my family's favorite new dishes for the holidays!  I've made this for the last two years and everyone gobbles it down, no complaints.  I usually add a little anduille or spicy italian sausage, apple and/or cheddar cheese for some zip.  But I love the old-fashioned, from-scratch taste!!

We added steamed shrimp, prepared with Old Bay Crab Boil, after the stuffing had been baked and as we were breaking it up into a serving dish. We also used jar jalapenos instead of fresh to reduce the heat, and baked in two casserole dishes. My in-laws have now requested that I make this stuffing every Thanksgiving! Great recipe!

For all the trouble it was to make, this stuffing was not what I expected. It came out like oatmeal consistancy and the flavor was not all that. Cornbread tasted like sawdust. Will not be making this again.

This looked great until I added the 7 eggs. My husband didn't like this at all and I had way too much left over from Thanksgiving.

Way too many spices for one dish.  If you like spicy then give it a try but for my guests that I served for Thanksgiving this year they were not too impressed.

I loved this recipe as well as everyone at Thanksgiving dinner. I did back off on the cayenne and tabasco (actually I am a LA Hot Sauce user!). I added a little Old Bay instead.

This is excellent for a change from traditional stuffing.  I probably won't make any other stuffing from now on.  I used the serving converter to make 8 servings and it still came out great.  Didn't use it to stuff the turkey, but baked it in a 9 X 13 baking dish instead.  Came out great as a side dish.

We have been using the same stuffing recipe for years, and I decided to switch it up this year. My whole family liked this dressing better! I couldn't find chile peppers anywhere so I used something that looked similar. Next time I will use a little less salt, and cut the recipe in half because it made enough to feed a small army. Thanks!

I cannot begin to tell you how AWESOME this dressing is! If I could give it 6 stars I would. Contrary to what others may say, I wouldn't change a thing about. It's definitely worth the time it takes to prepare. My husband is SUPER picky when it comes to peppers and onions and whatnot, but he is the biggest fan whenever I make this. He brags on it to everyone and has requested it for the past 2 years. I am thrilled to death to be making it again this Thanksgiving. Thank you sOo much for something so tasty and unique to look forward to for the holidays :)

This was a delicious stuffing.  Even though the list of ingredients is extensive, I am making it again this year.  Worth the work.  I feel it had an authentic creole taste.

I really loved this recipe, I tweaked it by using a pinch of cayenne pepper and I was a cup short with the buttermilk so I substituted reg. milk by adding a Tbsp of fresh lemon to sour it. I can easily see myself creating a variation with turkey meat. The cornbread portion of the recipe was good solo as well it was a nice change from the sweet cakelike cornbread I've been eating all these years

Wow! This stuffing has such amazing flavor and color! I lessened that number of eggs at the end the second time I made it, and I liked it a little better. My husband had me make it 2 weeks in a row!

Great recipe! I cut the hot sauce and green chilli peppers and it came out spicy but delicious. I boiled the turkey neck and gizzards with some seasoning, then cut it into small pieces and added it into the stuffing.  I also added some turkey drippins since I cooked it in the oven and did not stuffed the turkey with it.  Everyone love it.  Will definetely do again. Thanks.

This recipe was AWESOME! My in-laws loved it and they are very picky eaters. I have never tasted a stuffing so full of rich flavor and texture. I put everything into the stuffing that the recipe called for and I also added a little sage and some boudin. I also did not stuff a turkey with it. I put the stuffing into a large roasting pan and cooked it in the oven on 350 for about 1 and a half hours. I will be making this recipe for years to come.

Made this for Christmas last year for my Italian in-laws.  They LOVED it!! Have been asked to make it again this year; will be cutting back on the pepper combo though as that was the only "suggestion" I got about the flavors.

This was very very good!  Everyone in my family just loved it.  Got praise even from those who are almost always reserved.  Next time, I might just up the spicyness a little.  We will do this again at Christmas!!

This could have been a 5-star recipe for me if it wasn't so incredibly spicy! Don't get me wrong - I like flavor as much as the next gal, but after looking at the recipe I cut the Tabasco and cayenne by half and it was STILL too hot for my family. This recipe also makes a LOT of stuffing! I had a fair amount of difficulty stirring it all up in even my biggest fry pan. You might wanna go for a big soup pot instead. Anyway, I wound up stirring/storing it in an 8x13 baking dish, and it filled that to the brim. I'm definitely making this recipe again - it WAS delicious, I'm just going to modify the spices a bit, and maybe cut the recipe by half.

Loved it!! (My 4 and 6 yr old didn't so much but the adults raved)I followed some advice on here and cut down the spices: 1 tbsp of cayenne pepper and eliminated the chile peppers and tobasco.  I also managed to have only sweetened condensed milk rather than evaporated so I used heavy whipping cream instead which worked fine.  Also rather than making the cornbread I just made it from two boxes of cornbread muffin mix and followed the recipe on the box adding a can of cream of corn. I made everything the night before and finished cooking it in a crock pot the next day.  It was very moist and we like our stuffing a little drier so I threw it in the microwave for 8-10 minutes uncovered right before serving to dry it up a little and it was fabulous and not too spicy at all!  Thanks for the recipe!

I recently tried this recipe for a galatine (deboned whole chcken). The spice mixture looked similar to my Blackened Spice mixture, which i seem to have on hand more often than not. This saved a step, adjusted amounts and voila RAVE REVIEWS. Thanks

Great flavor, it feels like a real accomplishment after you've made this and sat down to eat it. We did hold back a bit of the jalepeno, not much, though. It was the perfect spiciness and the stone ground corn meal makes for a great base.

This recipe is a bit of work, but worth it. I made only half a recipe. I baked the cornbread (in an 8-inch square pan), mixed the spices together, and chopped the veggies the day before, which saved a lot of time on Thanksgiving. I used less cayenne pepper and didn't add the tabasco sauce or green chile pepper, and it was spicy enough. I didn't stuff my turkey. I baked it in a greased 9x13-inch pan uncovered for 1 hour at 350 degrees, stirring halfway through. (I like my stuffing dry and a bit crunchy.) Very tasty and even better served with gravy on top.

Polarizing recipe. About half my family liked it and the other thought it was bad. Too many conflicting spices for my taste.

This stuffing was really good.  I made it the same as what the recipe called for and it was delicious.  Full of spices, I was expecting it to be very spicy, but it wasn't.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will definitely be using it again.

I was very disappointed with this.  I enjoy heat, but this was way too spicy even for me.  It was also very bland...there was cornbread and heat and no flavors in between.  I would not make again.

this stuffing was spicy as prepared. if you prefer lower heat, I reccommend reducing the amount of pepper. We used Corn bread mix from the store and it came out just as great. I will make this again.

I made this for the first time Thanksgiving 2008, and it won't be the last. Yes, it's a lot of ingredients, and a bit of prep work, but well worth it. My family loved it, and raved so much. I followed the recipe exactly, except I added a little celery and paprika. The spices were perfect, even the cayenne and jalapeno, although I burned my hands chopping those darn peppers. (Never had that happen before!) My dish was not going in the bird, so I put it in the oven for about 25 minutes, instead of letting it cool in a bowl. I'm surprised noone has mentioned how pretty the stuffing is! Very colorful!

this was quite yummy, a nice addition to my favorite regular bread stuffing. Very spicy! It was well received by all at thanksgiving, but those who were partial to cornbread or spicy stuffing, RAVED! I halved the recipe (used 3 eggs) and used boxed cornbread. Pretty sure i'll make this again, but with fried fish or fried chicken.

Good but a litle too spicy.  Had to mix some with Stove Top Stuffing to tame it for the kids.  Lots of preparation.  The food processor definitely helped.

I used a boxed cornbread mix and mixed up the dry seasonings days before I actually made the stuffing.  This was an unusual addition to Thanksgiving and really spiced things up.  It would probably not suffer from the addition of vegetable broth instead of chicken broth for vegetarians.  Excellent!

This was very good stuffing.  I got plenty of compliments on it.  I used a cornbread mix instead of making it from scratch.  I also left out the evaporated milk, and took a little creative license with the amount of vegetable broth and eggs to get the consistency I wanted.

Wow this is delicious,this will definitely become a family favorite. I hated the chopping part,but next time I will have my hubby chop for me the night before. I also use Jiffy for my cornbread mix, it is a family favorite and cut down the preparation time greatly.

Thanks!

This was very interesting and quite good. I made it for Thanksgiving, though, and didn't really think it worked with turkey. I will make it again but this time use it as a side for a spicier creole-style dish.

This stuffing was fabulous and I didn't find it to be all that much work, like others have said.  Though I did break it up over three days, which helped.  Night one, I made the cornbread, chopped the veges and premixed what I could.  Day two, I made the stuffing, and morning three, I popped it in the oven for an hour on 350.  The only changes I made were cutting the cayenne to 1 tsp., using a 1/2 can of mild green chilies over fresh and omitting the hot sauce.  Personally, it was still a tad spicy for my tastes (I'm a spice wiener) and I'll probably cut back even more the next time, but others raved about it, especially my hubby who loves spicy food.  It's definitely a keeper and I can't wait to try it again!

VERY FLAVORFUL!  I tried this recipe because my husband hates and refuses to eat chicken and dressing which I love.  He will actually eat this one!  Word of advice: This took me forever to prepare.  Maybe I am just slow but I recommend getting your vegetables chopped the night before or use the food processor.  I think even without prior preparation it takes awhile to make but worth it.  Especially if you want something different!  Be careful of the spice if you have picky eaters!  Even my Aunt asked for this recipe and the only thing she complained about was how long the list of ingredients is and expensive to buy.  But once again worth it even if you only make it every other year!

This will be my 4th year to make this recipe for Thanksgiving and it is fantastic!  Very, very good!  Everyone goes on and on about it.  I substitute 2 boxes of jiffy mix (baked according to package directions) and crumble it, instead of making the homemade cornbread, just to make it a little quicker.  LOVE IT!

This was the best stuffing I've ever had. It had a good amount of spice and so much flavor. It didn't come out dry at all for me. I actually thought it was going to be too mushy at first from all the liquid I used, but it wasn't. It was a perfect texture, even reheated. My boyfriend and I both agreed that it would be so easy to just never stop eating it. Awesome!

this stuffing came out a bit dry. My wife made it while I was smoking the turkey and she followed the recipe exactly. She cooked it in a pan in the oven instead of inside the bird. That may have been the reason for the dryness.

Made it for Thanksgiving dinner last year was a huge sucess.  I love spicy food so this was great for me and all loved it for being something other than the usual thing.

Good, though one of the spices present, I think the oregano, definitely didn't work for me in this recipe, but that's a personal preference.

It is a great recipe! I've never made stuffing before, and despite a long list of ingredients, it was very easy to make. Definitely spicy!!! Instead of stuffing the turkey, I put it in a form and baked at 350 for about 40 minutes. Will make again.

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving.  Most of my guests had never had stuffing- not typical in Holland, and they loved it.  I cheated a bit though- I used Jiffy mix as my base.  Sorry but who has time at Thanksgiving to make everything completely from scratch?

The first time I have deviated from the old standby sage recipe in many years - but had to try this one.  It is delicious, my family loved it and raved about the flavor throughout the Thanksgiving dinner.  This is my holiday dressing from now on - out with the old in with the new!

I really liked this stuffing. Next time i might cut down on the spicyness. I only used one chile in it, but i am not a fan of spicy stuff. If you are you would enjoy this recipe. Anyhow, it is even better the second day !!

Tears came to my eyes when I tasted this - it brought back memories of my Granny who was from Louisiana.  Her first  language was Creole and all of her cooking was too! It is a great way to remember and honor her by serving this on special occasions!   Its a lot of work but a food processor will cut prep time way down!

Changed it up, but was still overly spicy. My husband hates dressing, but he liked it. Omitted the Tabasco, chilis and jalapeno.  The spicy came from the combination of spices so I would advise to maybe cut back a bit on them. It seemed to have a "peppery" taste which led me to believe it's the spices. I do not know when one to either omit or cutback so use them at caution. I added the cajun sausage to help drowned out the spiciness and it kinda worked. It made a ton, so unless you plan on eating it all or freezing it, I suggest you cut the recipe in half.

i'm an OG allrecipes user and have used this cornbread stuffing recipe in combination (my own original twist) with another older stuffing recipe on this site -- i think back in the day they were two of the top reviewed stuffing recipes on here! together they're great, and at least 50% of the reason must be because of this delicious recipe. the blend of spices are sublime and special.

I have made this cornbread stuffing every holiday for at least fifteen years now. It is a hit every time. I use Bob's organic cornmeal mix for the cornbread. Otherwise I follow the recipe. It is spicy, so I agree you can cut the cayenne a bit if you want less spice. Just divine--the highlight of the holiday meal.

The only change I made was to omit the sugar. I'm from Texas & I grew up eating cornbread without sugar. I'm 81 & every natural-born Texan I've known considers cornbread with sugar "corncake" not cornbread. lol I guess we're just "weird" that way.

This is a keeper! For years I’ve made my grandmother’s cornbread dressing, which is similar to this. But this year, we made a turduken and so wanted something a little different, with a kick. This is the best dressing I ever made! The only thing I did differently was use fresh bay leaves (we have a tree), and I used about 12 leaves. I didn’t remove them, but left them in while baking them inside the turduken. I put the leftover dressing in a Pyrex along with a few chicken wings for flavor and baked it along with the turduken. I was concerned when making this that there would be way too much salt and spices (it makes a huge bowl full once added together), but it was perfect! I think sautéing them in the butter is a secret to the flavor of the dressing. I think the evaporated milk is also a nice touch. My family said it was the best dressing I’ve ever made, even though I was already famous for my dressing. I’ll be making this from now on. Thanks so much!

I did not use all the eggs or buttermilk it makes a crappy consistency. I made my corn bread like normal an froze it ahead of time. no need to blend it. just chop and mix by hand. did my broth with all the veggies and tonys creole and larry the cable guy beer battered chicken seasoning. not a single drop was left over. You cant use hot sauces with children they simply cant digest it. I'm from new Orleans as well but a mom and granny too. great recipe but needed to be modified. And guess what, I'm making my 3rd pan in the morning. none left my dears. Just enough flavor you don't need to douse it in gravy.

Love the recipe, but it is missing some instructions! How much broth? How much evaporated milk? I am guessing at 3c of broth and a can of evaporated milk. Hope it comes out okay!

Very good!  I didn't add the sugar - don't like even a hint of sweetness to my cornbread dressing.  I also didn't add as much cayenne.  Great recipe.

I mixed this with crumbled sausage and stuffed it into acorn squash. The spicy stuffing made an amazing mix with the slight sweetness of the squash. Next time, I think I'll add sauteed mushrooms. I will definitely make this again!

The stuffing was really good.  It was moist and it had a little kick to it.  It definitely had a lot of flavors to it. I only added one green chile pepper instead of two. If  I had added two chile peppers it may have been too spicy for me.  Also the next time I will only use one table spoon of salt instead of two, and I may also use low sodium chicken broth. It tasted a tad bit salty to me, but everyone else said they liked it just the way it was. I am definitely adding this dish to my Christmas menu.

I used a cornbread stuffing mix to cut down on the time. I also cut the Serving size down to 8. It is delicious. I made it last year and my husband requested it this year.

I left out the green chiles, sub'd black pepper for white, and added pulled chicken before I cooked it and it turned out great.  Moist and not dry at all.  The recipe will give you more than a 9x13; I was able to make a 9x13 *and* a pretty darn full graniteware roasting pan (dimensions of that  pan: 13x8x5).  I'd cut down the salt next time, and the cayenne and/or pepper as it was just a hair too salty and spicy.  Great recipe!

Best dressing ever. We did not put the bell peppers in ours because forgot to get them while shopping.  Not one drop was wasted!

I make this amazing stuffing every year at Thanksgiving. It is the perfect compliment to our Cajun fried turkey. A few tips... get all the spices pulled together and all the chopping done the day before. I cut the cayenne to 1 tsp - just personal preference. The recipe for the cornbread itself is good but I am lazy so I usually use three mixes instead. When I add the liquid, I start with 1 cup stock and 1 cup evap milk and add more as needed to get the desired consistency. I use only 5 eggs. I also add a lb of Andouille sausage but this year I used chorizo (from the butcher not that packaged stuff in the grocery) and it was really good. I make this in a big iron skillet and just pop it in the oven for about 45 minutes at 350. Its done when its brown and crispy on top.

This has a good flavor but it is a bit too hot for our tastes.  I followed the recipe except for using some dried spices vs fresh due to convenience.  That may have made a difference.  Worth trying again.

I love the consistency and all the ingredients.  I decided to use prepackaged cornbread mix to save time, and I had to use 3 pouches to get enough cornbread.  I also did not use the 7 eggs at the end, just the evaporated milk.  I did not use hot sauce, green chili peppers or white pepper and it was still just a little bit too "peppery" for my family.  I think next time I will just use the white & black pepper, and a pinch of cayenne pepper.  Also, instead of stuffing it in my turkey, I precooked 2 pounds of chicken thighs and used the stock from that for the dressing, and shredded the chicken, added it to the dressing and baked covered with aluminum foil at 350 for 1.5 hours (last 20 minutes uncovered and stirred periodically to get it to brown throughout - this is how my grandmother does it.) I'm from south Louisiana and it reminds me of my grandmother's cornbread dressing.  Overall, I love this dressing and will definitely make it again.

This stuffing is amazing!  I have made it for 2 Thanksgivings so far and everyone loves it.  In fact, everytime I run into one person throughout the year he says "I can't wait for Thanksgiving to eat that stuffing!"  It's also very good mixed with leftover mac n cheese! :)  Thank you to the person who wrote it!

I love this recipe and make it every year and everyone loves it. It may not be for those who do not like spicy, but I can't get enough of it. If you are cooking for kids or non spicy eaters then just cut the spicy heat down by half.  I don't stuff a turkey with it, I just bake it for about an hour on 350.

I like it. At first I followed the directions as it called for originally. It was good, really spicy and all the eggs gave it a solid textured. After that, I modified it too fit my family. I don't use milk, I used chicken broth, cut the eggs down to 1 or 2 (depending on how big my pan is), omitted the spices, used a dash of cayenne pepper and that was it. I have small children, they can't handle spicy foods. Made my own cornbread and didn't use the buttermilk either. I pretty much used this recipe for it's seasoning.  I like the original version, I'm just a little health nut and don't do eggs or milk like that, so that is the main reason for my modifications. Still both ways came out great!

My favorite of the 4 from artful stuffing Allrecipes Tweet up 11/09/2010. Big white & black pepper spice, light black twizzlers. Moister than most others. Corn Meal Base gave it a different texture, yet the flavor was so massive, it simple blew my palate away. Paired on my Undergroud Winos Blog Site.

This was wonderful!!! I'd been looking for a cornbread dressing recipe that was different and this definitely was it.  One thing that I noticed when I made it was that as hard as I tried to follow my list I did forget one or two of the spices, but Italian seasoning has most of the seasonings in it, so I was able to substitute with that.  This was too great!!! I also took members suggestion and cut down the cayenne pepper.  It was great!!!!

I make "dressing" every holiday for my family and it has become their favorite.  For New Years I decided to be creative and make a cajun-styled meal.  My family LOVED this stuffing!  Very nice taste, the spices blended well.  I will definitely try this for the next holiday!

As someone who has never really liked traditional dressing, this recipe was an awesome find! This dressing was slightly spicy and perfect to mix up Thanksgiving dinner with. My husband really enjoyed it as well! We'll be making this again in the future!

Wow! I admit to taking the lazy way and using Kroger frozen cook and eat dressing. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter.  RAVE reviews from family and friends. I served it with peppered ham, buttered baby Yukon gold potaotes, and asparagus a l'orange. Perfect blend of flavors and textures. I'm going to make it with shrimp and crabmeat next time.

This is an excellent recipe but I will have to lessen the 'heat'. We are not from Louisiana so maybe we just can't handle the spiciness! We can't eat more than a small portion at a time because it is very spicy. I would make it again-just with less cayenne pepper and maybe one green chili.

I joined allrecipes just to review this stuffing, I loved it so much!  I cant figure out how anyone can follow this recipe and say it has no flavor, its kicking!  I like stuffing, but i couldnt get enough of this stuff!  I cut the recipe in 4 because it was just for my family and the kids wont eat stuffing.  I loved the fact that you made it from scratch because i didnt want to go out to the store, whipping up the corn bread took no time and even the plain corn bread tasted great.  I had to sub a few things -- a can of diced chilis, all onions (no green) a few mushrooms cuz i had no sweet peppers . . . and extra broth instead of the condensed milk ... if i wasnt so full i'd go sneak down to the fridge and eat some more!

This is THE BEST stuffing I have ever tasted.  My first Thanksgiving, both with my husband and as the cook, were a HUGE success.  Very zesty and will definitely become a staple around our house.

This was the first time I ever made stuffing and my husband loved it. I don't like stuffing but this was good except I don't care for spicy stuff that much. This makes so much the next time I will make half for my husband and half with less spices for me.
