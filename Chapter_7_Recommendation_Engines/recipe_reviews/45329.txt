The only downside to this recipe is that it does not indicte whether the marshmallows are to be melted or not. The upside is the time factor involved (1/2 hour tops). I intentionally let the mixture cool just enough so that the marshmallows did not melt or only partially melted, and I substituted chopped dry roasted peanuts for the pecans. Very yummy...definitely a hit with this chocoholic.

i give this recipy three points...because even i only being thirteen, turning fourteen, know that you could save alot of calories by not using the condensed milk. instead, mix butter, valilla, and MARSHMALLOWS in the pan makeing a guey, paste, add choco and butter scotch, then mix untill all brown and guey....add nuts, and then put it on the wax paper. Note: you will not make as many. but there is another way around that.... have you ever heard of....corn syrup??? just add 1/4 cup to the pot when you are melting butter and marshmallows.

A little too soft/squishy. Didn't hold it's shape well. Especially if you don't wait for the chocolate to cool enough, the marshmallows will melt to make them more soft.

I've been making something very similar to this since I was a kid (a looooooong time ago) but I use peanut butter instead of butterscotch and chow mein noodles instead of pecans.
And no condensed milk !!!

I recently made these and froze them so they would last because they are irresistible! I used slivered almonds instead of chopped pecans, and peanut butter chips instead of butterscotch.  They are incredibly easy to make and delicious right out of the freezer!

I looked for this to sub for an old candy recipe I lost. It is nearly identical and came out great. Super easy, fun to make with the kiddos and makes mom look like a hero! I like to spread the mixture in a flat pan and then cut it into squares. This recipe makes alot of candy. A hit at our house and so easy to adapt for different tastes. I used walnuts and skipped the butterscotch. You can use peanut butter chips or even mint chocolate. Never be afraid to play with it. make it your own!

I thought these were really good!  Because I knew of some nut allergies among the group I was serving them to, I omitted the pecans, and replaced them with Heath toffee bits for a little crunch.  So good!  They were really easy to make and what drew me to the recipe was that I needed to make treats in a hurry and didn't have time to go to the store, so I had to pick something I had all the ingredients for.  So happy I found this recipe.  I think that the next time I make these, I may try them with peanut butter chips, pretzels, all kinds of different stuff...lots of fun possibilities to work with. :)  Thanks for the fun, easy, tasty recipe!

Gotta love fun and easy when you're in the kitchen with the kids.  I was worried that the marshmallows wouldn't keep their shape but they held up just fine and they taste wonderful!

Not sure quite what happened but the chocolate didn't melt/blend into the mixture and it was a Bust.  Waste of ingredients.  I'm a sad girl.
