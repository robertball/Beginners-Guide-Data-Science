The fennel was so subtle that it had more visual and textural impact than flavor.  Still, a nice, simple, elegant way to serve fresh fruit.

A definite hit. A wonderful lite end to any meal. I don't like raisins, so was leery of the red currants. They were fantastic in this dessert.

Really good, but I used raspberries, sweet cherries & blueberries.  Instead of fennel, I used basil from my garden in one batch & mint & lavendar in another.  Delicious!  Even better if you cook it  and serve warm.

This was really good and very easy.  I couldn't find Fresh Currants so I bought dried, and then reconstituted them in 1 cup of dry sherry by simmering covered for 15 minutes.  I substituted mint for the fennel because I love it.  then I reduced the liquid from the currents and drizzled it over the fruit on top of homemade pound cake.

This is very good, although not particularly special.  Try it again when red currants are available.

This was really expensive since I am at the mercy of grocers.  But... it was also really delicious.  I couldn't find red currants - not even dried - and I had to buy a fennel bulb.  I picked one with the most greenery available & used all the greens.  The fennel was very subtle, but still a classy addition I'd keep.  I brought the compote to a gathering & the hostess served it over angel food cake.  I thought it worked well.  Definitely will make this again.  Thanks, Amelia!
