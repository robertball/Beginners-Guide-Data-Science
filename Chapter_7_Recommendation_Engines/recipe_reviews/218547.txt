I have to admit, I was skeptical with the flavor of the three dry mixes called for, but this was the best tasting roast I've ever had!  Used "herb gravy mix for beef" which was the only one I could find and it was delicious.  Had a lot leftover so I made wide noodles the next day and we had a yummy version of beef stroganoff.  Definitely a keeper!

I've always thought that slower cooker dishes lack flavor.  I put in flavorful ingredients, but the slow cooking process seems to homongenize everything and the liquid thins out the flavor.  That did not happen with this recipe.  The gravy was thick and rich and highly seasoned.  I was very hesitant to use all those mixes, but I had them in the pantry (some for quite awhile) and I needed to use them up or throw them away.  My husband had two helpings and proclaimed it "Good stuff!"  Thank you so much for the post, keylimeone, this was great!

Loved this recipe! I went exactly by the recipe and this is the best pot roast ever. Very flavorful, just the right amount of seasoning. The gravy is rich and brown. The only change I would make next time is to add 3/4 cup of water instead. I like my gravy a tad thinner. I also added cubed potatoes.

I wish I could give this more stars.  Made this tonight and it was absolutely amazing. My wife actually licked her plate. I was skeptical as others about the seasoning combinations but it was without a doubt top notch. The only addition I made was a little red cooking wine over the onions in the bottom and I sprinkled the roast with worcestershire sauce before putting the carrots and potatoes on top of the roast. I also used a much bigger roast. The roast I used was around 5 lbs. This recipe is on top of my list. Wife is still ranting about the roast and is upset it's better and easier then hers. Thanks for the recipe.

I have been making this for years, but I do not use the flour or the water.  Put the roast in the crock, add your potatoes or carrots (small red potatoes cut in half absorb the juices and are oh so yummy), sprinkle and in 10-12 hours a roast that tastes like it has been in the oven.

I decided to make this pot roast recipe based on the rave reviews. I have tried a couple others from the site in my crock pot, but none were as easy and delicious as this one! The ingredients were incredibly simple and inexpensive, and it took only about 10 minutes total to prepare. I was leary about the lack of liquid in with the roast, but the water from the carrots and onions mixed with the beef and seasoning to make a delicious broth! Tonight my boyfriend and I are making roast beef sandwiches from the left overs, and I couldn't be more excited! I  found my new pot roast recipe and would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a cheap, easy and delicious dinner!

Great recipe and the meat was so tender that it practically melts in your mouth!

The first time I cooked it according to directions, the meat was too salty.  So I made it again and made the following changes and it was a hit (and better too):

1. I only marinated the meat with black pepper.  The dry seasonings have enough sodium already.

2. I couldn't find ranch dressing mix, so I used ranch dip mix instead.

3. I mixed the dry ingredients with hot water so that they'll melt faster and added some minced garlic too.  Then let it sit for about 10 minutes before putting it into the slow cooker.

Next time I'm going to put some jalapenos in there to make it spicy.

***Follow-up on my original review:

I made couple of other changes and the dish turned out even better -

1. Mixed the dried ingredients with 1 cup of water.

2. Added crushed red peppers onto the dry ingredients according to how spicy I want it to be.

3. Marinated the meat with crushed peppercorns.

4. I scooped some of the sauce from the side with a ladle and poured it all over the top of the meat 2 & 1/2 hours before it was done, so that the top of the meat would not get too dry.

5. I served it with rice the first couple of times, but served it with spaghetti because this time (I only cooked them according to the package's directions, no salt added into the pasta water), poured some sauce over the noodles and then the meat on top.  The sauce complemented the noodles really well.

My go to pot roast for the rest of my life.  It's honestly THAT good!  I've shared this recipe with a lot of people and they all agree it's insanely good (and easy to prepare!).  Having made this over a dozen times, I have my own little "enhancements" but you don't need them as it is great as is, but these things just elevate this to a whole 'nother level.  1)  I brown the WELL floured roast for a few minutes on all sides to get a nice caramelization going on before putting into the cooker.  I am fortunate in that my slow cooker insert is non-stick metal and I can use it on the cooktop directly.  2)  I use 1/2 cup red wine and 1/4 cup water for the dry mixes.  3)  I add 4 or 5 stalks celery chopped up (in add'n to the carrots).  Sometimes I add quartered red potatoes, but lately I just serve over mashed potatoes.  If you find this is too salty for your liking (I love it as is) the potatoes will help cut that down - potatoes always help make food taste less salty FYI... 4)  A few dashes of some Worcestershire sauce does wonders in the liquid mix.   Let this baby go low and slow and you will be happy you found this recipe.  If you want to get super creative try caramelizing the onions a little first.   Thanks keylimeone!  :)

Am I the only person who thought this was unbearably salty?  I wanted to love this, it was so simple and seemed like a great idea.  The meat was great, but the veggies and especially the gravy were so salty I could barely eat it.  It made so much gravy, normally I'd be dancing with joy but I had to throw it out.  I felt my blood pressure rising with every bite.

Best and easiest slow cooker pot roast I ever made!!! Very tender and tasty.Next time I'll try onion soup mix instead of onions. I used a bit more water( about 2 cups) and I added potatoes. It was delicious!!

We LOVED this recipe!  I thought that my mother's recipe was the best I'd ever had until I tried this one.
I will always make this one from now on. It's fabulously flavorful and delicious.  I added cut potatoes and more liquid for making the gravy because the 1/2 cup liquid seemed way too little.  All in all, this recipe was an easy and delightful surprise for my husband and me.

This was the best pot roast I have ever had! The gravy made from the juices was the most amazing I have ever had! I didn't have a packet of Italian dressing seasoning mix, so I made it using the Italian dressing seasoning mix recipe from this site (I omitted the 2 tablespoons salt that recipe called for ....too salty) I used 2 cups beef broth instead of the water ....1/2 cup seemed too little! So glad I did cause the gravy was to die for! Will definitely be making this again!!

I tried this for the first time on some family. My cousin's husband begged me to pass the recipe on to his wife. Here are my additions/recommendations: i always use pearl onions in my pot roast because people love to get their own flavorful little onions, add sliced mushrooms to the crock pot about 2-3hrs before your done-they turn out wonderful, and lately i make garlic mashed potatoes on the side and serve all together in a bowl. This is a hit!

So this is the first time I've cooked a pot roast in the slow cooker. I usually do it in the oven. But this will be the only way I do it from now on!! Amazing.  I read a lot of the reviews and took suggestions and added a few of my own. Here they are:
1- do not season the meat with salt. The seasonings have enough salt
2- instead of only 1/2 cup of water I used 3/4 of water and 1/4 of red wine. 
3- I added baby carrots and small white potatoes cut in half
4- crushed up one clove of garlic and added it as well
5- 2 hours before it was done I added a handful of in chopped mushrooms
6- I took the roast out if the fridge and let it sit out at room temperature for at least a half hour, no more than an hour. Allows the meat to cook more evenly
7- finally I cooked the meat for 9 1/2 hours and the ends came out well done and the middle was a perfect medium rare
8- once done remove some jus, put in a pan and begin to warm. Meanwhile take 2 teaspoons of flour and about 4 teaspoons of water in a cup and whisk until you get a pancake like texture. Slowly add to the boiling jus constantly whisking.  Creates a thick heavenly sauce 

Will do this every time as it was soooo good  seems like a lot if extra steps but seriously made it incredible!!!

This is the best pot roast recipe! I am not a really big fan of roast, but every now & then I get a craving for comfort food like mom used to make. I rarely ever would make a roast because I just couldn't seem to find a recipe that really impressed me until I tried this one. This is now my go to recipe & my husband and I love it! I've made it quite a few times, playing around with it a bit. It's good as is, but I've also browned the meat it in oil & added 1/2 c. red wine along with the 1/2 c. water to the 3 mixes and this is by far my favorite way to make it. Even though it's just two of us, I usually get a 2-3 pound roast. I shred any leftovers and use it for sandwiches later in the week. Yummy!

Made this for Christmas dinner today. The house smelled wonderful and it was a very easy meal. The beef was very flavorful...so much so that I still have a bite of tang in my throat one hour later. I will reduce the dressing packets to 1/2 packet next time. I would imagine the sodium content in this recipe is through the roof and since I never really salt anything, it's particularly noticable to me. My family ate it but there were no raves. Just keep this in mind if you're sensative to sodium content.

Amazingly GOOD !   I did everything in the recipe, EXCEPT I covered the pot roast with chopped up carrots, potatoes and celery.  A dome of veggies under the lid of the slow cooker.   The veggies give up their water, cook down and there's plenty of JUS.  A tender savory meal.  LOVE this recipe !   Thanks !!!!

Ok, this is the best and easiest recipe you will ever try - I just threw away my previous recipes for pot roast after making this. My husband's exact words were "This is the best roast beef I have ever had" and says that when I have made it before the gravy was "tasteless". Thanks sweetie for telling me that. Anyway, I was skeptical about using 3 packets of mix but that is what did the trick - gravy was so flavorful. I used a 5 pound roast and this recipe still worked fine but increased water to 1 cup.

DH's question: "Was someone drinking when they came up with this?" Don't care - it is amazing! I cringed when I read about all the "Packages" of pantry treasures that were going into this.....but....this morning, while trying to throw dinner into the Crock Pot before work, it was a "What the heck!" 8 hours in the Crock Pot on Low. Added (Tweaker Alert) 1/4 tsp. Red Pepper Flakes and 3/4 cup of water & Celery & Granulated Garlic. (Not too tweaked - I hope)! This was delicious and I will suffer my rings not fitting tomorrow. Really good! Teenager's attacked it when they showed up after 9pm. Gone. 5 lbs. of chuck roast, whole bag of baby carrots, gone. They got hamburger buns out of the cabinet & were dipping the buns into the left over gravy. It is that good. Next time, will probably stick to the 1/2 cup of water instead of bumping it up to 3/4 cup water. Totally will add this to the Recipe Box! More than 5 stars!

When I came home after work my hubby declared this roast was "da bomb!"  I made this on a day when I didn't have time to cook or plan.  So I needed something super simple to quickly throw in the crockpot.  Like others, I was skeptical about all the packaged seasonings.  Usually I try to make my own instead of using the prepackaged stuff but I simply did not have time nor motivation to do so on this day.  I did not add salt since the packaged seasoning would have plenty.  Also, I used a reduced sodium gravy mix and added probably 3/4th cup water but next time will probably stick to 1/2 cup because it made way more gravy than we needed. However, this was delicious and I am so glad I found this recipe.

I have used this same recipe for a few years with beef as well as pork loins. I know it sounds strange, but it really adds some nice favors to the meat and makes a great gravy for rice, potato or pasta. The only problem is that your gravy can be rather salty to taste if made exactly as written.

The problem is all those mixes contain a lot of salt which works well if used separately, but combined makes the dish way too salty.
 
My solution has been to prepare larger batches of my own ranch and Italian seasoning mixes (from this site) ahead of time, completely omitting the salt, and storing them in a airtight containers until needed.

Usually 2 or 3 tablespoons of the bulk mix (depending on recipe) equals a packet and the salt already in the gravy mix is enough to allow the flavor of the meat to come through without overwhelming the roast with saltiness.

This is fantastic!  I followed the recipe almost to a T.
I added more veggies (2 lbs red skin potatoes, 2 sticks of celery, 1 lb of the pealed mini carrots).  The other change I made was to bake it instead of crock pot it.  I cooking sprayed a dutch oven, added the sliced onion, added the floured check roast, and poured the gravy on top.  I put that into an over preheated at 375 for 2 hours, then tossed in the veggies and baked it for another 1 hour.  I think this is our new "default" pot roast recipe

Although very tender, I thought all of the mixes made it taste very artificially flavored and super salty.

Followed the recipe exactly. It was so easy, and so good. Everyone raved. Next time I will get a much larger roast, since there were no leftovers.

Honestly I don't know what happened. Followed this recipe exactly with the exception of using reduced sodium beef broth in place of water. After waiting all day for it to cook, I was appalled at how salty it was!!!  I was really really disappointed and will not make this again.

This was good. My wife is not a big meat person so she wasn't sure on this but she has asked for it a couple of times since she had it originally. The original recipe sisn't have potato or onion so I added those and put in enough water to cover them and the flavor was still well defined.

THE BEST slow cooker roast we have ever had.  I thought it sounded like a strange combination but it was delicious.  I have always had a problem making a tasty gravy but this was perfect.  I made exactly as directed but added cubed potatoes.  Definitely a do-over.

Holy Cow ! !  WONDERFUL  I was so curious about this recipe, with the 3 dry packs of seasonings. Just had to try. Can't believe how good this is. Yes it was a little salty, but I think the potatoes and carrots sucked up some of the salt. I used 1/2 cup water, and 1/2 can of beef broth. Came out great. Thank You Keylimeone. It's a keeper !

Loved the variety of seasoning!  The roast was so tender and just fell apart!  As others have said, I used 3/4 cup of water, added a package of onion soup mix also and an hour before it was to be finished, I added a can of canned potatoes.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I'm not a "pot roast lover" by any means...but this is 100% DELICIOUS! Savory, slightly tangy, melt-in-your-mouth perfection. The only way I will ever make pot roast again. I've tinkered a bit, but never strayed far...I do add a packet of Onion Soup Mix with the other mixes, only because we LOVE onions. A little minced garlic for good measure, but truthfully the flavor is perfect with the combination of dry mixes. BE SURE TO FLOUR the roast- The couple of times I didn't, my gravy was noticeably thinner (we prefer ours thicker! Nothing a little cornstarch can't fix though :) Homemade Mashed Potatoes (or roasted sweet potatoes!!) and some greenery, you're good to go!
Now I'm hungry!

I followed the directions as written. I don't know what gave everything that sweetness, but wherever the sweetness came from my family didn't like it.  Maybe the carrots I used were too sweet?  Or maybe I shouldn't have used red onion and should have used a yellow onion instead?  Or maybe it was the ranch dressing mix?  Anyway, to balance all that sweetness we had to use a bunch of salt to get the dish to the point where we'd eat it (yes, it was that sweet).  And the chuck roast didn't turn out tender enough in my opinion. We had to cut ours with a knife.  I cooked it the specified time and it was not tender. Then I kept it in there and kept checking back on it hoping that it would eventually get to that melt in your mouth falling apart point but it never got there. I'm going to keep looking for that slow cooker pot roast recipe.
UPDATE:  "Awesome Slow Cooker Post Roast" is a good recipe to try if you're looking for a really good Slow Cooker Pot Roast recipe.

Read alot of reviews.  Made a few changes which turned out wonderful.   I didn't have 8 hours so I cooked for 4 on HIGH.    Used small red potatoes and cut in half and used 3/4 cup of water instead of 1/2.   Poured some red wine over onions before putting in roast and then poured some worchestire sauce ontop of roast prior to putting carrots and potatoes.    My son loved.     Thank you !!

THE best pot roast I have ever had.  After tasting this marvelous pot roast, I am ashamed to admit that I orginally shared previous readers' fears about not enough liquid and the combo of flavors.  I couldn't wait to get rid of that hidden valley ranch packet I had in the back of the pantry, and now I can't wait to go buy more so I can make this recipe again.

I made this last night. This would be my very first pot roast and like everyone else, I was very skeptical of the ingredients. My husband told me that this pot roast is better than his sister, which both of his sisters are amazing cooks with with Grandmother being the number one. I try to keep up with them and to know that he thought my very first pot roast was that good made this recipe a true keeper. I followed all of the directions and added just 3 elements to this recipe:

1. Olive Oil: All meat, to me, needs olive oil to keep the tenderness and adhere to the seasonings better
2. Poultry Seasoning
3. Portabella Mushrooms and Bell Peppers

About 3/4ths of the way through the cooking process, I tasted the gravy. I must admit that it has this weird tangy taste that comes from the italian dressing. I left it alone to continue cooking the remaining 2 1/ hours. Once done, all of the spices came together and created this amazing taste and melt in your mouth roast. This is a staple and this will be a go-to recipe, always. I served this with buttered mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli on as the sides in addition to the vegetables from the pot roast. This is a must try! Thank you keylimeone!! I have one in the books towards being a greater cook, #competitive.

So like everyone else I waa skeptical of the packets but I used them anyway!!! I was worried about the comments that deemed it to salty so here is what I did... #1 I didn't pre salt or pepper the roast... I just cleaned it and rolled it in the flour...  #2 I used 1 1/2 cups of water and 1/2 cup of red wine... cut up red potatoes and used baby carrots and Tada!!! Perfection!!! My honey looooved it and got up and got his own seconds and I looked at him and he said and I quote " honey when I say this roast is REALLY good" and even my picky eater gobbled it all up!!! It was a win for my family!!!

So easy and so good!  I added potatoes  and increased the carrots. The gravy was thick and so flavorful. Only enough left over for my husbands lunch today. Everyone loved it.  So much easier than my regular pot roast.  I did get a bone in roast so we could share with the dogs!  They were happy too!  We'll have this again soon.

This one got RAVE reviews. "The Hubbs" was hosting a guys' weekend, and when they returned home from the field, of course they were hungry for something NOT cooked around the camp-fire.  This really fit the bill. I used a 3-pound roast, added both carrots and potatoes along with the onions, and subbed a packet of dried onion soup mix for the Italian dressing mix (...and I'm trying really hard NOT to think of the sodium content...oh well.). I had the slow-cooker on high for about 5 hours. Meat was practically falling apart, with a really nice flavor. I would say this is great for maximum results for relatively minimal effort...a keeper.  Thanks for this recipe.

This recipe is fantastic!! The flavors were amazing! I have never cooked a roast before and this was extremely easy to throw together. I probably used a little over a cup of water and it made the gravy perfect, just the right consistency. I also cooked on low 7 hours and kept on warn for an additional hour while I made my side dishes. I highly recommend this recipe! Easy and delicious!! I will definitely make again

Sorry. Followed the recipe exactly. Thought the spices were overwhelming with a strange and unsavory aftertaste. The saltiness was a bit much as others have said, but the spice flavor was very unpalatable and overpowered everything in the pot.

I followed this recipe exactly, and both my husband and I found the taste a bit peculiar and over-seasoned. The meat was certainly tender, but it always is in a slow cooker. I won't be using this recipe again. Sorry!

Wow! I have never been a pot roast fan but my husband loves it! I created a rub of flour, Montreal seasoning, cracked pepper, kosher salt, paprika, thyme basil etc. let it sit overnight (2-3# chuck roast). Seared/browned it in olive oil the AM.  Quartered a sweet onion placed in bottom of crock pot, placed meet on top, put 5-6 peeled carrots, 3 stalks of celery  around the roast. Then 3 large baking potatoes peeled and cut crossways around the side. Mixed 1 package of beef onion soup mix and 1 of ranch dressing mix with 1 1/2 Cup beef stock and poured over roast. Cooked on low all day 9-6 then changed to warm. Also basted it with turkey Baster periodically in the PM to keep roast and potatoes moist. Just before serving put 2 T of brown gravy powder and 2/3 c water mixed well into pot gravy to thicken slightly. It was nothing short of fabulous! This is the first review I have ever been inspired to write. A MUST try!!!

The reviewers are spot on, this is amazing and so easy.  I did enhance with veggies and potatoes to truly make it a one pot meal.  I just filled up my crock pot to the top with carrots, mushrooms, celery and potatoes.  Thanks for the easy recipe!

This recipe is great! I made this Christmas day, it was my first Christmas as a married woman and everyone decided to come to my house for the family get together. So, i really hoped it turned out good and it did! I opted out of the carrots but did everything else and my whole family loved it! My parents even said they loved it, which is amazing because they are hard critics! By the way, this recipe is perfect, i added a cup of water and then wish i hadn't becaue the gravy was still runny. Not bad runny, but just wish i would have went exactly like the recipe lol

Unexpectedly delicious! Could not believe that the combination would create something so tasty and easy. Shared it with a friend, and they love it too. It's pretty forgiving of changes.  I added celery, more onions, more water, and quartered potatoes in the last hour of cooking. It's the combo of the gravy mix, Italian & Ranch salad dressing mixes that make this one an easy and delicious choice. Try it!

Very good, and easy.  Didn't have packaged italian, so used some bottled italian and just adjusted the water accordingly.  Still turned out very nice, and very tender.

I really liked this very much and will likely make it again. I did not add additional salt, but found this to be a bit on the salty side. I used baby carrots and added 3 - quartered red potatos.

I wasn't sure about all the mixes but it was fabulous! Great taste, tender meat, savory gravy. The only change we made was to add a few small red skin potatoes. Will definitely make again and again.

DELICIOUS!! Wanted a slow cooker roast recipe for Easter his year and found this. Added red potatoes and celery to the mix. Unlike some other posters, I did not find the taste too salty, but it's likely ok to omit salting the meat, though I'd still recommend pepper. Cooked it overnight on low for 8.5 hours. Added about 1 full cup of water.  The meat was so tender. The next day I shredded the leftover meat took out the potatoes for another meal and heated up the remaining gravy with the shredded meat on the stove, I added 1/2 cup Cabernet which added more depth and then poured this over egg noodles. Ben better the 2nd day! I would've added the sliced baby Bella mushrooms if my child didn't dislike mushrooms so much. Solid dish!

This was awesome! Best pot roast I have made so far. I forgot to buy beef gravy mix, so I substituted 3 tablespoons of cornstarch with 1 tablespoon of beef base and all the rest of the recipes I made as stated. The gravy came out thick but not gloppy, but I think 2 Tablespoons of cornstarch would have worked better. The meal was very flavorful and the meat tender. Hubby likes potatoes, so I microwaved some medium to small size whole potatoes with the skin on for 5 minutes on high, cut them into quarters and threw them in the crock pot for about 20 minutes before serving. The gravy coated them nicely. Everything was delicious!

This Was DELICIOUS! I added Mushrooms, and Celery to the mix. It was great with mashed potatoes, and I also made a gravy with the juice from the Pot Roast. I can't wait to make it over and over again.

This recipe is the business!!! I did make two little alterations to the recipe: 1/2C water, 1/2C red wine and I seasonded the the onions with Mrs. Dash and seasoning salt (a Sistah's best friend). Other than that, the meat came out boss and that gravy...I'm still dreaming about that gravy. This was THE best pot roast recipe I've ever used. May use a 1 1/2C of liquid next time. Mucho, mucho Key for posting this recipe :)

Everyone loved this...even my 11 yr old who hates pot roast.  I added minced garlic and onion/mushroom soup mix to all the other dried ingrediants.  I also sprinkled worchestershire on the roast before I added baby carrots and pototoes.  Put in on low for 5 hours and they switched to high for 1/12 and it was wonderful.  Will be making again!

Like a lot of the other reviewers, I was really concerned about how the flavors of the ingredients would go together.  There really was no need for the concern, the pot roast was very tasty.  The cut of meat is quite fatty, so next time I think I would cut some of the fat off the meat before cooking.  When I cooled and refrigerated the left overs, I was able to get some of the fat out of the gravy.  I also added some potatoes to the slow cooker with the meat, and don't think I would do that again.  The seasonings were great on the meat, but left the potatoes with kind of a funny flavor that I did not really like.  My boyfriend loved the dish and was impressed that this was my first attempt at pot roast.  We will definitely do this again.

I wish that I could could give a 4.5. The only things I did differently were no salt or pepper, low sodium brown gravy mix & double carrots. It cooked for 8 hours. The sauce was amazing!!! I can't say that enough! The carrots absorbed the flavor perfectly. However, the sauce didn't thicken, which was fine, could always take it out & thicken it before serving. My meat was disappointing. It was dry & unflavored inside. We all had a little & smothered it in sauce. Then I sliced the rest & soaked it in the sauce overnight. The next day it was awesome, tender, flavored & juicy. So, in conclusion, I'm going to experiment to get the meat to taste better on the first day(maybe different cut, shorten time, slice before cooking?) but the sauce is my new favorite! LOVE IT!

I had to make a few substitutions, since I didn't have any ranch or italian dry dressing mix. So.... I sprinkled the roast with a flour mixture I had on hand for prime rib (may have got it here on All Recipes). Seared the meat on all sides and placed on top of a layer of sliced onions. Found some ranch dressing in the fridge, and thought, "Well, it's going to get wet when I add water to it anyway...". Also had some dry onion soup mix and the dry gravy mix. Added a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce and some whole peppercorns. Added water to thin it a bit and poured the whole thing over the roast. Added the carrots as per the instructions and left it on low for about 11 hours. Thought it was great. I'll make sure I have the dry ingredients for the next time, but this was really good!

I've tried several slow cooker pot roast recipes & this one's been my husband's & my favorite! My roast was 3.5 lbs., so I used 1.5 packages of each of the dry mixes called for and used about 1 & 1/4C water. Cooked about 6 hours on low & it turned out amazing - perfectly moist, perfectly seasoned! Pretty sure this'll be my go-to for pot roasts from now on.

Delicious!  The only change was that I used pot roast seasoning instead of the brown gravy seasoning.  My husband and I both thought this was possibly the best pot roast we've ever had.  Scrumptious and tender!!

Good, but very salty. I enjoy salt as much as the rest of America, but this was pretty salty. I even had a larger roast (2.9lbs) than the recipe called for, AND I had slightly less volume of beef gravy/ranch/Italian dressing mixes. I also did not salt the meat before cooking, I just added pepper. Maybe would be better if I watered down the gravy more? I also added some small red potatoes but that did not help the saltiness either.

Wow, this was good! My husband loved it, too - we both had two plates! I enjoyed mine over mashed potatoes, and it was delicious. I was running behind today and actually cooked mine on high for 4 hours, and I think it turned out just fine. And, yes, it's salty, but we like salty. Bravo!

I made this with cubed beef instead of a full sized roast, because that's all I could get at the market that day. I added diced potatoes along with the carrots. I ended up with a nice curry flavored meal! It was a surprise, but a good one. It's good as leftovers, too.

This recipe is amazing!  The flavors blended so well together.  I've tried alot of different roast recipes and this one tops them all.  The only changes I made were omitting the flour and adding potatoes and celery.  When I make it again I will use the flour (the reason I didn't was because I couldn't get on the internet to see the recipe again so I went by what I had remembered seeing).

I love quick and easy recipes so was very pleased to find this one. Unfortunately, I overcooked my roast to the point that it was mealy but the flavor was EXCELLENT. I removed the meat and am enjoying this savory carrot, potato & onion soup. I will definitely make this again!

My guy roomy and I just bought a crock pot neither one of us having used one before. I should also mention neither one of us really do that cooking thing either unless you consider making toast or a box of mac n cheese cooking lol. That being said, this recipe was super easy! The only variation I made was adding red potatoes cut into quarters and 1 cup of water. The roomy and I both agree that this was by far the best meal we've cooked and that dropping 25 bucks on a crock pot was an awesome investment! We will for sure be making this again, thank you Keylimeone :)

I've been looking for a good pot roast recipe for years now…and this definitely ISN'T it!  Way too salty (and I love salt), the "gravy" was goopy, and the mixture of the 3 dried mixes was just too eclectic for me.  So…I'm still looking...

My family is big on veggies so I cut up red potatoes, celery, carrots, two onions, mince several cloves of garlic and a slice up a 12 ounce package of mushrooms. I fill the crockpot and out the meat on top. I add the liquid with all 3 packets mixed well, but check after 7 hrs as not to dry out your meat. This gravy is my staple for making pot roast. Will never make it any other way!

Followed the recipe & was unimpressed. It was too salty & just overall weird in flavor. Did not suit my tastes at all. Will not be making again.

Just didn't grab me. The flavor combination tasted as weird as it sounds. I think I'm looking for something a little more steakhouse flavored. I'll keep looking..............

LOVED this!  I used beef stew meat as the roasts at the grocery store didn't look great and the stew meat was really good.  I was skeptical of the the 3 different mixes, but they melded together and made everything just flavorful.  I also skipped the flouring and frying of the meat and didn't miss it at all.  My husband and sister loved it, two picky eaters!

What a terrific flavor combination! I was quite hesitant to use all the different flavor packs together but I'm glad I did!  I was very pleased with this dish!  It was a "10" according to my family & my 3 yr old that doesn't like meat n potatoes just loved this! (I added baby reds & bakers along with baby carrots) THANK YOU for such a DELICIOUS recipe!! This may very well be replacing my recipe.  ;o)

I don't always come back and leave a review but I had to make an exception this time.  This was amazing.  So very easy.  I followed the directions exactly and won't alter a thing when I make it next time.  I like the idea someone else had about serving over egg noodles the next night.  Thanks so much for posting this one!

I have never rated a recipe before, but HAVE to do this one, it is soooo terrific!  I made it yesterday, the only deviation was I found an actual chuck roast WITH the bone in--by far my favorite and hard to come by these days!!!  It was perfect, and I will absolutely use this "unusual" recipe always!  Thankyou keylimeone for being so inventive.

This is without a doubt THE easiest and BEST tasting recipe I have made EVER!!  I used to HATE roast when my mom made it as a kid, but this was out of this world tender, juicy and flavorful!!!  I added potatoes and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  PERFECTION!

Awesome.  I served this up for the hubby and some friends and they asked for seconds afterwards. I ended up cooking the first 4 hours on low and the last 4 hours on medium.  The meat still came out tender.  I also added 4 large cut up potatoes and a 1/3 cup of celery.

I added celery & cut up potatoes because I like them. You have to add more water to accomodate for this. I also omitted the salt suggested by another user. This is the best pot roast I have ever eaten and I typically don't like pot roast. Even my 7 year old loved it. The smell alone made my mouth water.

Giving this 4 stars. Made the recipe as stated but added 1/4 cup water.

The meat turned out absolutely delicious. I found the veggies (and potato) to be salty. Maybe I'll use different seasonings next time.

I really liked the base flavor, however the comments made me weary of the saltiness. I should have stuck to the recipe as when I didnt salt the meat the gravy turned a little bland. It was my mistake for adding a little too much water as well to the mixture because I was adding pototoes and celery to the pot. The flavor and tenderness of the meat was 100% on point. Next time, I wont be afraid of the salt content and also halt the extra water. Great recipe! Great taste! Family loved it! Thanks!

I'd never made pot roast before, but I wanted to start using my crock pot more often. I chose this recipe, even though I was wary of using three dry mixes, thinking it would be too salty. I used the Ranch dressing and Italian mixes, and chose a "beef stew" mix instead of a "brown gravy" mix, which sounded like something you'd use for cafeteria-style mystery meat. I added medium red potatoes and some boiler onions. I also used about another 1/2 cup of water to mix the mixes. On low for 8 hours, and the result was perfect! Not overly salty (I didn't add salt to the roast, thinking the mixes would have enough), lots of beefy flavor and a lovely gravy, all served over egg noodles. The family raved and I had enough leftovers for lunch!

This is my go to recipe for the past year since I found this! When I mix the dry ingredients though I add 32 ounces of beef broth and then pour it all over the meat.  I cook mine in the crockpot also and after our meal - this is the best soup base - DO NOT THROW AWAY!  I take the leftover meat and shred it and make a beef barley soup with this broth/gravy from the crockpot and I add mushrooms. It is scarfed up real fast! You won't need another recipe on the site after trying this!

Followed the recipe and watched the video. I will admit that instead of 3/4 cup water, I used red wine.
The result was fabulous!
Served with mashed potatoes and green peas..
Looking forward to leftovers!

I love this recipe. It is quick to throw together and easy..I did add a bit more liquid and a bunch of vegetables along with a packet of onion soup mix because of all the extra water..it was very good and even with the extra liquid made a nice gravy. I will make this again :)

This was great! My husband has been begging for pot roast for the past two weeks and this recipe gave just the amount of effort I wanted to put into it. I got low sodium mixes and nixed the salt when I sprinkled the pepper on it.  I can definitely see how it came out too salty for a lot of people, make sure you get the low sodium mixes.

Had this for dinner tonight.  I couldn't find a 2 1/2 lb so I bought a 3lb. chuck roast.  Followed the receipe to the letter.  Added baby carrots after 3 hours.  Never thought the combination of the mixes would work.  I was wrong.  The meat was so tender, perfectly done.  Plenty of gravy.  Served also with mashed potatoes.  Husband went back for seconds.  Delicious!!!!!  This is a keeper and will definitely make again.

I halved the seasoning packets and it was still way too salty and had a weird after taste. I will try another recipe.

Easy, savory, and the way I enjoy my roast...slow-cooked!  Next time I might add more veggies.  The gravy/seasoning was just right!

It was easy to prepare and the slow cook made it nice to come home to a ready meal. 
I followed recipe exact as printed. Lots of gravy as promised. For me the flavor combination left an after taste in my mouth. Maybe the brand of seasoning packets I used changed the end product.  Enjoyed a nice hot meal but think I'll try something different next time.

Holy salt! Better have a gallon of water and Chapstick close. Good taste but way too much salt. I even cut the salt from the chuck roast and bought low sodium packets.

We enjoyed it very much. I skipped the flouring step and left out the added salt (since the mixes already have plenty), and it turned out great! What's more, the next day we put the leftovers on toasted ciabatta rolls with mustard and cheddar cheese. If anything, the sandwiches tasted even better!

Good and simple recipe, but the key to any kind of meat dish in the crock pot is to brown it first on all sides.  I realize that it messes up another pot and defeats the purpose of using a slow cooker somewhat, but there's no other way to get that brown color and flavor on the meat. I did omit the Ranch dressing mix to cut down on the sodium and added some celery and small potatoes to the pot too.

This is just absolutley fantastic!  I like to make this at least once a month or so now and have been spreading the recipe to family and friends.  Only changes I made was I used a Boneless Sirloin Strip Roast, I doubled the dry packages, spread on some olive oil to the roast before spreading it with flour, and added potatoes. I just posted these pictures - hope you all enjoy: http://imgur.com/a/2x0bw

Best pot roast I've ever had. This beats my grandma's, mom's, step-mom's, any I've ever tried while dining out. Simply delicious. I love that this was so simple too; no searing the meast before adding to the crock-pot. One of my husband's favorite dishes. I've tried other highly rated pot roast recipes on this site and was not thrilled with the texture or flavor. My search is over, this is truly the best out there and we will make continue to use this recipe for our roasts.

I did not care for this recipe. I want to say it tasted like italian dressing and red wine. It had a weird almost chemical aftertaste. Either way, I didn't enjoy it, and I don't think there was enough moisture in this recipe to make the meat as tender as I'd have liked. I cooked it for the full 8 hours.

I've made slow cooker pot roasts for 30+ years, and this honestly was the best I ever made.  I made my own scratch dry Italian dressing and brown gravy mixes to cut down on the sodium, and didn't use much salt on the meat, and it was plenty flavorful.  I keep a jar of Ranch dressing mix in the cupboard and it has sodium in it.  3T of that equaled 1 oz.  I did add a splash of red wine and Worcestershire sauce after reading other reviews.  I also threw in some baby new potatoes and a few pieces of celery and a chopped garlic clove with the baby carrots for flavor.  After 8 hours my 2 1/2 pound chuck roast was perfectly fork tender, so much that I had to be careful removing it from the crock as it was about falling apart.  The gravy was amazing, looking forward to leftovers today.  DH said 'whatever you did to this roast, remember how you did it'...lol.  Great recipe, don't let those dry mixes scare you off, just be aware if you use store bought, there will be more salt than if you whip up your own.

This was amazing!  I did add potatoes, but that is the only thing I did differently.  I have shared this recipe with all 3 of my sisters and they have shared it with others.  From now on, this is the only pot roast recipe that I will make.

I made changes I didn't really want to because I made the roast later than planned! I put potatoes in it as a preference from my bf and his friend, and we ate the onions I bought for it so unfortunately there was none. I fed three men this pot roast and they ate all but one tiny piece! For some reason they didnt want to eat it??? I usually do not like pot roast or any type of meat soaked gravy but this tasted absolutely awesome! The gravy was the best ever! I hate brown gravy also and I would have ate this with a spoon! Try this roast, very tasty!!

This is my favorite way to make roast. My family loves this. The roast has a really great flavor. I don't usually take the time to coat the roast in flour and I only add carrots and onion if I have them on hand. I usually make gravy out of some of the juices and serve with mashed potatoes.

DELICIOUS!!!!  I first rated this several years back.  Since then, I've used this recipe with great regularity.  My only substitute, really, is to use dark beer instead of water.  Every time, it comes out great.  Works well for venison, too!

I followed this recipe exactly. It turned out delicious. The beef was so tender and I strained the liquid and used that over the mashed potatoes. The sauce had a bit of zing to it from the Italian dressing but the ranch made it smooth. I love how easy this was to put together in the morning before I went to work.

Very tasty!  I added about half a can of beef broth to the crock pot to give it more sauce.  I think it would be really good with some stew meat also.

Best pot roast I have ever made! The flavor is outstanding. I did add an extra 1/2 cup of water as some suggested there was not enough gravy, but I ended up having to thicken up the juice with cornstarch and it made a TON of gravy, so next time I will only use the 1/2 cup. This one is definitely going in the recipe box!

My daughter April gave me this recipe and said it was the best Pot Roast she ever made so I had to try it. She was right it is the best I've ever had! I added 3 medium size potatoes peeled and chopped into bite size peices about 1 hour before done time.
And if you have leftovers it really makes a wonderful base for vegetable soup, just add one or two potatoes cut into bite size peices, a bag of frozen vegetables and 1 box of beef stock, a can of tomato paste, season with salt and pepper to taste and you a wonderful pot of soup.

I thought this tasted really good and the meat was very tender.  The gravy was really greasy, and I tried to skim some of the fat off the top.  It's not the recipes fault, just a problem with a fatty roast.

So Delicious! I would prob not add as much carrots next time because the sweetness of the carrots kind of took over the flavor! I also added new potatoes. Loved it! Will def make it again!

Delicious !  I have made pot roast for years and hubby says this is one of the best.  I used low sodium McCormick brown gravy mix and low sodium beef broth.  You will not miss the salt !  Great flavor!!!

A huge hit in my family! I am not a huge roast fan but this one has changed my opinion. My 5 year old said I made the bestest meat ever and she is a picky one! Thanks so much for sharing... Can't wait till leftovers tomorrow... Hot beef sandwiches

Excellent!  I used a pack of Au Jus Gravy mix, mixed with water as directed on packet.  I only used 1/2 tsp. of the ranch and dressing mix due to the sodium content.  I added baby carrots about 2 hours before roast was finished.   I served with oven roasted red potatoes.  Definitely a keeper!

Amazing!! I was skeptical with the different mixes but it was super tasty!! My whole family loved it!! I am making a stew out of it next!!  Can not wait!!  I also had to use brown gravy mix because I can not find beef gravy mix so I wish I could find it just to see if it would be better with this recipe or not.  Not a big deal seeing as how the brown gravy mix was marvelous!!

Great pot roast, I was skeptical about the blend of seasonings but they turned out to be a great flavor, I added about 2 cups of water and wish I didn't add so much once it was done cooking. I also just used a pork roast for it since that's all I had on hand and added extra veggies like potatoes, mushrooms and celery.

This was absolutely delicious!! I used this recipe as a base and made a few changes and it came out great. I used pearl onions instead of one large onion, they are a pain to peel but I love that they are bite sized. I didn't have an Italian dressing packet so I used 1 ts dried basil, 1 ts dried marjoram, and 1 ts dried thyme, someone gave me one of those dried spice racks for Christmas years ago so I've been looking for an excuse to use these spices. Also instead of whisking together the spices, gravy mix, and ranch packets with water I used a can of cream of celery that I had in the cupboard. Then I filled the crock pot with beef broth maybe like a cup or two so the roast was still poking through. I used washed and peeled baby carrots so much easier and I love carrots so I used a 2lb bag. I cooked on high for four hours I don't think it was as tender as it could have been but still really good.  I served this with mashed potatoes, this was a hit. The gravy the juices made were really good. Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful! I added more carrots and about four potatoes cut up into pieces. My chuck roast was also bone-in which didn't make any difference at all. It still was so tender it fell apart and the whole family loved it.

The best pot roast ever!!  Like others I was skeptical about the package ingredients, but they made the pot roast sooooo full of flavor.  I used a package of dry Au Jus gravy mix...everything else just as listed & half way through cooking time added thick slices of potatoes.  So easy!!

This is the BEST roast recipe EVER!! I made it for our early Christmas dinner and everyone loved it! I added sliced mushrooms at the bottom and got a 4.5lb roast instead (had a lot of people to feed). This will be my roast recipe from now on, for sure!

This is the best roast ever. I added some small red potatoes and it was fabulous. I also added 1 can of beef broth in place of the water. This will be the only way I will ever cook a roast again. Super easy and wonderful flavor.

This is a great recipe. So easy to make with a couple of changes. I followed main ingrediants, but added cubed potatoes,  2 stalks of celery cut into 1/3 pieceswith 4 med. carrots peeled and cut in 1/3 pieces. Ididn"t have beef gravy so made it with brown gravy wit a 1/2sp. worchestershire sauce and a dash of liquid smoke. Cooked for only 5 1/2 hrs. Searve with cornbread and enjoy

DELICIOUS! Best pot roast ever, so flavorful! Of course, I added potatoes though cause roast just isn't roast without them. I didn't have any beef gravy mix so I used onion soup mix and a can of beef broth instead of water. And I added a little cornstarch towards the end to help thicken it.

SO flavorful. This was the best pot roast I have ever had. I didn't change much. I added potato chunks, because I like those in my pot roast, and then instead of using water to mix with the packets, I used red wine. I did use a 3 1/2 lb roast, but I think that's just preference on how much meat you like. This recipe was absolutely fantastic. It is definitely I keeper!!!

Like most reviews, I too was skeptical of the dry packet ingredients, but let me tell you I stand corrected!  This dish was the most flavorful I've tasted or made.  I followed the recipe exactly as is and only added small potatoes cut in half.  I served over white rice.  It was a hit and a keeper!

Excellant!  Added baby carrots about 1.5 hours befor dinner and turned on high for 1 hour and then allowed to go to warm. Then started the mashed potatoes.  Took the gravy and put in a pot and thickened a bit with cornstarch.  All and all excellant!

Amazingly easy and extremely tasty.  This was my first time making pot roast and it ws a definite hit.  I made one change I used Old Bay seasoning before covering the roast with flour.  I also used creole seasoning mix (fresh chopped onions celery bell pepper) instead of chopped onions.  I used baby carrots with the meat.  I let the food cook for about 11 hours on low...and it was perfect.  I served the roast with rice (for the gravy).  I will be making this dish often.

I didn't have time to prepare the roast with the flour steps, but threw all into the pot, added a few potatoes and dashed off to work.  It smelled wonderful when I got home.  I thickened the gravy with the flour at this point.  What incredible flavour.   I was very happy and will definitely make again.  The potatoes were an odd brown colour after soaking in the sauce all day.  My kids thought I was sneaking in a new vegetable :-)  But they devoured the meal.  Thanks keylimeone

I liked this recipe as well as my mothers, though it had a tang to it, I suppose from the Italian mix. My husband enjoyed it immensely, saying that he doesn't like roast but he liked mine!

I am so pleased with this recipe. I made it exactly as written except I used 1/2 cup of beer instead of water. Everything else I left the same. I wasn’t sure how it would turn out because the combination of flavors seemed weird to me... but I trusted the reviews and I am so glad I did. This is by far the best slow cooker pot roast I have ever made. It is very tasty and my entire family went for seconds. I will definitely be making this again and again. Delicious!

This was easy to make. I used what I had for the ‘gravy’. I used one packet of ranch dressing mix, Italian seasoning. And beef broth (about 1/4 cup flour too). It was a bit sweet for my liking but my husband and kids couldn’t seem to get enough.

We liked it a lot! Used a 4ish pound top round roast, which I cut into 2 pieces. Started it on high for a few hours (3-4) until it was bubbling, then turned down to low for an additional 3 hours. (Last time I made it, I didn't feel like it was tender enough. This time it was amazing.) Very flavorful, good with some potatoes too. Very happy with it overall.

A little salty but very tasty. Made mostly as written with the Italian dressing mix from site and omitted salt in the dressing mix., half a ranch packet because I needed to use one up. My husband loved it. Served with egg noodles.

I was so scared this would be way too salty with all of the seasonings but it was perfect! I made a big batch for my husband's crew at the fire station and they all had second, even third helpings. I sent it with a few big loaves of Italian bread to sop up the gravy. If it can satisfy hungry firemen it will made your families tummies happy too!

Excellent. I made changes, but the heart of the recipe remains the same. I added small potatoes in halves and celery. Other than that, nothing, really. My husband loved it, and he’s a pot roast lover.

This is great, I’ve made it many times! Few cautions though. Depending on the brands of seasoning you use, it can come out unbearably salty or too peppery from the Italian seasoning. I use a full packet of simply organic ranch dressing, almost a full packet of the simply organic Italian dressing, and a full packet of McCormick brown gravy. I never buy chuck roast for pot roast, I buy like a broil. Reason why is because there is more meat and way less fat. Whenever I buy chuck I feel I’m always skimming for meat and trying to avoid the fatty pieces which also makes the gravy really oily and fatty which I don’t

This recipe is delicious! All I did different is I added mushrooms and as many carrots and potatoes as the pot would hold! The gravy is excellent! Best served with biscuits.

Excellent flavor! We added potatoes. Lining the bottom of the slow cooker with the onions made them almost completely textureless; instead we lined the bottom with the potatoes, then the carrots, then the meat, and layered the onions on top. The meat tends to be so tender that it falls apart; my husband and I ended up just cutting the meat up beforehand  and it came out very much like a stew. It's a favorite!

This is the best pot roast dish I think I’ve ever made!At first the dry ingredients sounded odd to me but I thought what the heck,I’ll try it anyways. This was sooo good,my husband and kids loved it.Not too many ingredients and very simple.I didn’t change anything and made it exactly as the recipe said.The only thing I did differently  was bake some fingerling potatoes in the oven and added them to the roast two hours before it was a done so they could soak up the flavor

The meat came out great, just not that happy with the taste of the veggies (carrots & potatoes). Like them better cooked in a pressure cooker which only takes just over 30 minutes.

Awesome flaovors and sooo easy. Taking others advice, I cut roast into portions, seasoned, floured then searedon all sides. Then deglazed pan with some red wine and added that to slow cooker. Served with mashed potatoes, this is a big hit with the family.

Very good!!! I followed the recipe with no changes.   I doubled it in two crock pots to serve twelve people. The meat shrinks & I was left with very little left overs.   I will definitely make this again.  My family enjoyed it.

Highly suspicious of this recipe with all that envelope stuff but it comes out with a kind of glaze rather than the soupy mix you usually get with slow cooking.  Company raved!!  I followed the recipe exactly except I seared the meat in a dutch oven, removed it, layered in the thick sliced onion, then the meat, then fat carrots all around and finally those tiny round white potatoes on top.  Put the lid on and left it in the oven from 10:30 in the morning until 7:00 at night at 275 degrees.  Served a salad as the first course then strawberry shortcake for dessert.  Big big hit.

Not the best.  I wouldn't put the carrots in until the last 3 hours to ensure it's not over soft.  The taste of the meat was good but I've tried other recipes that were just as great.  It was edible so not a waste of my money.

This roast beef was completely to die for. Like many others, I was very very skeptical of the packets used, but y’all it was so flavorful and the meat was juicy and tender (although we used a roast my roommate bought and I personally would’ve chosen a better cut of meat) it was all very delicious! I could’ve eaten an entire bowl of carrots and I added potatoes as well which I don’t remember if it called for. It was all great and sooooo easy and I’d definitely make it again!!!

Easy to prepare and tastes delicious! Be sure to season a little more if you’re adding potatoes.

Oh my goodness. This was the best thing I’ve ever cooked. Period. I hate when people add additions, but the ONLY thing I changed was a bigger pot roast, 3.25 pounds, and I put cut in half red potatoes in the crock pot, face down. Have to eat potatoes with pot roast. Lastly, I only cooked for 6 hours as that’s all the time I had.

I followed the recipe, and on the whole was very pleased with it. The dry mixes used make for a flavorful gravy, which I thoroughly enjoyed by sopping it up with slices of bread (not to self:  buy more bread)

The recipe itself was easy enough to follow and is a great, low-maintennance meal for your slow-cooker.  the only suggestion would be to omit salting the roast prior to coating it with flour, as the mixes are salty enough, and if you have a heavy hand when salting things, can make this a very salty dish, indeed. it it for this reason, I gave it four stars. Otherwise, this is a worthy permanent addition to anyone's recipe library.

I grew up on Sunday roast and I have hated ever since I can remember. It was always dry, hard to chew and didn't have much flavor. This recipe was the exact opposite! So tender it fell apart and practically melted in your mouth! Everyone in my house had seconds, even my very picky significant other who doesn't really like any thing that's not out of a box, and I even have some for lunch tomorrow. I will definitely be making this again!

If I would of told my Grandma that I used 3 different dry mixes to make the best Pot Roast ever, she would laugh and tell me to quit being silly. 
With this recipe I decided to flour and brown roast first. Then I placed roast atop sliced onions baby new and red potatoes and carrots then poured the magic on top. Voilà!

My crockpot died the day before I made this, and I already had all of the ingredients, so I bunged it all into a cast iron Dutch oven and  set the oven to 250* for 8 hours. I made a few changes just to suit our likes: instead of a chuck roast, I used an eye of the round cut in half, and I swapped out the water for red wine. It turned out great, and is now in my personal, leather bound cookbook! I served it with mashed potatoes, Yorkshire pudding and green beans, then I sat back and enjoyed the rave reviews!!

I made this once as I thought that the flavor was off and not to our liking. I decided it was the Italian dressing mix that was funky tasting, so I left it out this time on the second run. I added 1/4 cup of A-1 steak sauce , 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, 1 can of cream of celery soup mixed it up with the dry mixes (minus the Italian dressing mix) with 1 cup of water. To the crock pot I added 2 cloves of chopped garlic, fresh button mushrooms, baby carrots, Yukon gold potatoes chopped, and 1 bay leaf. I cooked for 4 hrs on high and this pot roast was tender flavorful and amazing! Now it’s a winner for us with the tweets!

Great recipe!  So flavorful, even after the first hour in the crockpot, the aroma had me running to text my husband that he was in for a chuck roast treat.   I DID add 3 large stalks of celery (had to use 'em or lose 'em) but I can't see how that would make any appreciable difference in the end result.  Also, the 8 hour cooking time was perfect!  I used a roast only a bit larger than the recipe called for.

Lovely, tender and tasty roast. We will make it again - and soon! But too salty for us. We will mix up our own spice packets next time. Around here, the available brand for the packets is Clubhouse. The 25g gravy mix contains 1.08g of salt; the 28g ranch mix contains 2.16g salt; the Italian mix adds about 1.2g of salt. In all, that's 4.4g of salt. Between them, that's a little under 1 tsp. Tastes like 5!

This was amazing! I, like many others, was quite skeptical about this recipe but holy wow, it was tasty. The only thing I would do differently the next time would be to do a larger roast. The flavor was delicious but very strong. A bigger roast might be perfect. Thanks for the recipe.

I was finally able to make a great pot roast after 35 years of trying! I can cook just about anything else, but boy I didn't have good luck with pot roasts. I made sure to follow the directions carefully and let it cook at least 8 hours in the crock pot and it came out delicious. I made a few recommended changes, though. I sauteed the onions in olive oil before I added them to the crock pot. I also browned the roast in a little bit of olive oil (and of course coated with the flour) before adding it to the pot. In the water mixture I substituted 1/4 c of red wine for that amount of water, and also added a few dashes of worcestershire sauce. I put carrots and celery in for the full 8 hours and added cubed peeled potatoes during the last 2 hours of cooking. It turned out really good and my husband was almost ecstatic that I finally mastered a recipe for this!

This is so great!  I made it the 2nd time with potatoes and carrots, but I have to say eating the meat with mash potatoes is my favorite because the gravy in this dish is amazing!  Don't salt meat though, because as others said,  it can be salty.

I've been making this roast for several years--it's my favorite! My recipe doesn't have the pounded in flour. Maybe that would help thicken the gravy. I'll try that next time. (I often add cornstarch at the end to thicken it but would love to save that last minute step.)  Sometimes I add a can of mushroom soup and I usually add celery along with the carrots and onions, no extra salt. For those who say it's too salty, try adding some potato chunks (although I prefer serving over name brand refrigerated mashed potatoes.)  You can also use only one half the ranch dressing packet and/or a larger roast to cut saltiness. This recipe is versatile as to vegetable choices (good with sweet potatoes) and red wine for part of the water. I like the hint of serving leftovers over noodles (add some sour cream?) for an easy stroganoff.  This recipe is a definite keeper!

I've made a lot of roasts in the slow cooker over the years and this recipe is the best, hands down!  Not only is it super easy, but it tastes GREAT!  I chop my onions into large  pieces so that they don't disappear during cooking, add quartered small Yukon Gold potatoes (skins left on), and whole baby carrots.  I don't salt the roast, but do add about 1 tsp of Better Than Bouillon (beef flavor) to the water and mix to dissolve before mixing with the other side ingredients.   I also increase the water to 1 & 3/4 C because I end up using about 3/4C flower pounded into the roast. Have served to all ages in our extended family and even guests from Europe and everyone has loved it.  Relatives in Europe even bought a slow cooker just so they could make this!! Needless to say, this is now in our regular rotation.

Good that the gravy gets nice and thick, also good with some buttered noodles on the side. I found the two kinds of dry mixes made it way too salty for my taste so I cut them in half and added more carrots and whole mushrooms and a heavy grind of black pepper.

So I had never made pot roast ever.  I just recently bought a crock pot and have been trying to find new recipes to make with it. I came across this one and read a ton of other reviews and decided to give it a go. The end result was AMAZING. We all loved it. The meat was so tender and delicious. It was not salty at all like I read in some reviews. I did make a few simple changes like other reviewers did. I did not salt or pepper the roast. I also added a few squirts of Worcestershire sauce into the dressings mixture.  I used 1 small can of beef broth and added a little extra water right into pot with the roast in it then poured the mixture over the meat and cooked on low for 8 hours because I had to work lol. When I came home it smelled delicious. I took the roast out and chopped up some red potatoes and onions and put that into pot along with baby carrots. I placed the roast over the veggies and turned to HIGH and let it cook for another 2 hours. And it was DELICIOUS. THE BEST POT ROAST I HAVE EVER TRIED and so easy to make. After 8 hours the meat was ready but since I was at work I could not add the veggies sooner. I read in another review that when added at same time as roast they became mushy so decided to wait to add them. I would recommend this recipe to anyone who's looking for an easy and DELICIOUS dinner.

Very good and easy. I was a little afraid of the ranch packet being too salty but it was just fine. After I bought the packets at the store the same recipe was on the back of the Italian dressing packet. The only difference was to roll the roast in the seasoning packets. I did that instead of the flour. It was delicious!

Never have I made a recipe from Allrecipes that wasn't at least a 4 star recipe. This one, however was hands down a 5 star. One has to have guts to make something for the first time then invite guests over for dinner! I must add that I did tweak this a slight bit ( I truly dislike tweaking any one's recipe!)and only because I was being lazy. I parboiled small red potatoes and small carrots. Then put them around the roast. About 2 hours before it was done I added another a 1/2 package of  brown gravy mix using the juices that the meat had made I was afraid that I wouldn't have enough gravy. WOW! With adding the small red potatoes and baby carrots along with more brown gravy mix. This was truly a one pot scrumptious meal. My guests LOVED it. There were no leftovers (except for the gravy LOL). Add Italian bread or Baggot bread with butter, guaranteed you'll have some very happy people sitting around your table. My friend asked for the recipe, when I told her where I found it she said "OH I get their magazine, I love it" I told her to try the Allrecipes web site as well. I made a copy of the recipe and shared it. So hats off to the person who sent in this recipe!!!

The only thing I added was some potatoes. The dish was delicious and I will definitely make it again.  I served it to company and we had enough for the next night and then we still had some carrots, potatoes and gravy left so ate that like vegetable soup.

I've made this simple and wonderful pot roast at least 5 times since I found this recipe about half a year ago. It is so easy and so delicious! Funny how something so simple to put together can get so many compliments! The only  thing I added was a bay leave for that extra flavor; nothing else. It's definitely a keeper!

Loved it and so did my family.  A couple of changes... Did not use salt, read the last review and followed her suggestion. Also, did not use Italian Dressing. Instead I used Italian Seasoning. Thirdly, used Stewing Beef, not a roast.  I had a difficult time finding a Chuck Roast and the Italian Dressing. Will definitely make it again!

Best I've ever had and suspiciously easy.  I did swap out the water for French onion soup (only because I had some leftover) and I added potatoes which I HIGHLY recommend because they came out perfect and flavorful all the way through.

I loved this recipe! The only thing I did was I doubled the dry mixes  and water in order to have more sauce to spoon over potatoes. I'm definitely making this again.

I was just as hesitant as other people when it came to the Ranch and Italian mix, but it came out sooo good. I followed the recipe as it's written, except I added celery to the pot and splashed some Worcestershire sauce on the meat before coating it with flour. I lighted salted the meat because some people said their pot roast came out too salty, but it turned out fine for me.

This is my very favorite pot roast recipe. I never make it any other way!  The meat comes out very flavorful and tender and the gravy is tasty and perfect for mashed potatoes.

Great recipe!  This is the first slow cooker pot roast that  we loved!  It was so good we made it two weeks in a row.  It is delicious and tender.  The second time I  made it, I changed the recipe very slightly.   I do not salt the meet.  I put flour and pepper only because there is a lot of salt in the dry ingredient packets.  I also added a 1/2 cup of wine.  The wine added a nice flavor.

Delicious and easy to make; great way to make pot roast.  The only thing I did differently; I added the flour at the last hour by taking out about a cup of gravy, let it cool a bit and then mixed about 3 heaping tablespoons of flour until smooth.  Then added back to the gravy to thicken it up.

It had enough salt in the mixes, so I didn't add any more to the recipe.  I also had some clean carrots so I didn't even peel them before adding to the recipe.  

Made some mashed potato to serve with the dish.  Husband loved the recipe.

I am the very common kind of guy who rarely cooks beyond frozen pizza, toast, or most common microwavable or frozen just-throw-it-in-the-oven foods.  But, I did get a crock pot in the last year... and with some googling this has become my #1 signature crock pot creation.   It is so good!  

I personally swear by good brands for the sauces... like sticking to hidden valley ranch (another reviewer felt this was too salty, but maybe that depends on the dressing brands used).  I deviate from the recipe here in four ways:

1.  I do not get too concerned with the flour and how well I pack it on.  I roll the roast in the flour and pack it with my hands to get to the good old measurable stage of "good enough".

2.  I add no salt, found it unnecessary.

3.  I get a pound of baby carrots instead of messing with having to cut any.

4.  Key addition:  I add 1 pound to 2 pounds of baby red potatoes (cut in halves, thirds, or quarters depending on size), basically as many as I can fit and still get the lid on.   Put the carrots around the sides and then put the potatoes on top of everything.  Trust me, the potatoes extend the meal awesomely and come out perfect.  

It comes out so good we can only go a month or two before we CRAVE having this again...

This recipe is easy delicious.  I have to say, the Italian mix did the job.  I did not believe it would be so easy.  The first time I went exactly by the recipe.  It turned out perfect.  Then I tried my style and messed it up.  Follow the directions and you can't go wrong

I made this last night for Easter dinner with my boyfriend. It was my first time ever using the crock pot for a full meal like this, and my very first time making a roast. I have to say it turned out perfectly! I was really skeptical of the gravy ingredients, but I decided to trust the reviewers and go with it. I'm glad I did! The gravy was great with just a little kick to it, the meat turned out super flavorful, and the potatoes and baby carrots were awesome with the gravy soaked in. Definitely not going to forget this one!

The easiest and best pot roast I've ever made. Italian, Ranch, and Gravy sound odd seasonings to go together but they worked very well indeed.

Made this while house/pet sitting for a friend and somehow misplaced the dry beef gravy mix so i added a dry french onion mix I found in the house.  The roast turned out great and I think the onion mix gave it a really nice kick.  Will try it again with the gravy but if you want a good replacement or something different, there you go!

Unsure how it would be - but everyone loved it.  I used a bottom round roast beef (had on hand) and it was excellent.  I added in a whole pound of carrots instead and added 2 onions total, upped the water to 1 cup.  Also threw in 5 whole garlic cloves.  Served over mashed and biscuits.  Even the kids devoured it!

Tasted great but there wasn't enough liquid which made it burn to the sides.

All I had was one package of dry onion soup mix so I rubbed garlic and onion powders into the meat (and a little steak seasoning) and then floured and seered in oil/butter.  Was perfect! My boys gobbled it all up.  I didn't have 8 hours so cooked on high for 5. I think really getting the flour and seasonings into the meat makes a difference. Perfect! Oh and added some cubed potatoes around the three hour mark for hubby -- boys and I had mashed.

Very easy and delicious! Added 4 cut potatoes and 1/2 cup red wine to the half 1/2 cup water and wished with the dry mixes. Poured over the roast and vegetables. Only used half of the dry mixes as suggested and no additional salt. The BEST Pot Roast EVER my husband said! No left overs... Enough said :)

Solid basic pot roast recipe. I used a leaner cut of roast, because I think chuck roast gets too greasy in a slow cooker. The gravy was one of those things that didn't really taste that good on its own, but was good with the roast and with the mashed potatoes I had with it.

The beef was tender, but the saltiness was overwhelming! I might use a tablespoon of the mixes next time, because under all the salt I THINK the flavor was good.

Best roast I ever made. I add a little more water but no more than a cup or else it will lose the gravy and be runny. Seemed to taste a bit better in roasting pan for some reason, but still good either way.

The only red meat I have ever made before (and not very well) were hamburgers. I used trip-tip instead of chuck, and my fiancé devoured probably an entire pound of the 2.8, in one sitting. If he wasn't leaving for deployment I would've told him to slow down, but I don't think he'd listen!! I love onions, so I added an extra one-half of a whole onion. I also put in baby portabella halves, with 2 tablespoons of minced garlic (sprinkled over the top of the entire compilation); as for spices, I followed them to a "T," and I tell ya, I couldn't get enough myself (I typically eat white meat and fish only)!! My mother, who is a souis chef had this with me as a 25% deployment mark celebratory dinner, and even SHE asked for the recipe! Thank you, thank you, thank you! I love it and so do the most important people in my life!!! Also, the mozzarella Texas Toast is delicious paired with this dish, especially for cleaning up the gravy! I will be making this for years to come, it is a staple in my home!!

Holy cow!!! This is simple and delicious. I used Mushroom Brown Gravy and added whole mushrooms to the crockpot.  I will be making this simple recipe again and again.  I did add more water since my crockpot wasn't full...and at the end, used the juice to create a nice thick gravy on the stovetop.  Mmmmm.  Winner winner!

Wow!  GREAT taste and so tender.  Had the onions in the pot, the flour pounded into the roast before I discovered I did not have Italian dressing seasoning...Used 1/2 c liquid Italian dressing for the liquid instead of water.  Just whisked together with the ranch dressing mix and the gravy mix.

The best pot roast I have ever had. I added potatoes, carrots and mushrooms to the point where my crock pot was ready to burst. It impressed my husband AND his boss/friend who we had over for dinner. They cleared out the roast that night to my surprise (surprise that their stomachs didn't explode that is!) But I was able to use the left over gravy (that my husband didnt manage to sneak in and sop up with bread) to make an absolutely heavenly shepherds pie to boot!

This was as good as all the other reviews stated! I put five garlic cloves at the bottom of the crockpot with the onions.  I took flour, pepper, and granulated garlic and put it in a gallon size Ziploc bag.  I rinsed the roast in water then put it in the Ziploc bag.  Once sealed I shook it around and used my hands from the outside of the bag to knead the flour mixture into the roast (instead of using a plate like the directions stated-less messy).  I then dumped the whole bag into the crockpot, extra flour and all.  It made for a creamer gravy, I believe.  I increased the water to 3/4 cup since I was using some extra flour.  I found a gravy packet that was low sodium and I think that helped with the salty taste.  Mine wasn't salty at all.  I really thought that there wouldn't be enough liquid when I poured it over the four pound roast.  When I got home from work sure enough the liquid was almost all the way to the top.  Don't know how it happened, but it did.  I put carrots and potatoes over the top of the roast like recommended in an earlier post.  This was great and my husband couldn't stop raving about it.  Very easy to do in the morning then you have dinner right when you get home from work.  I put leftovers into single serve containers for easy grabbing to take for lunch.

Delicious!!!!! So tender, and the gravy was great! Wonderful for someone who has trouble perfecting gravy (ie. myself!), as you do nothing to it. I may try this with less or no ranch mix. I couldn't exactly peg it, but I think it added something I could do without (and I like ranch). I also used reduced sodium gravy mix, which I would recommend. I'm not sure it can get much easier than this, especially for something so tasty! Thanks!!!

GRAVY from a crock pot? Yes!  In our family, gravy is its own food group.  I was amazed with the flavor and texture of the gravy.  The only thing I did after putting everything in the crock pot was to turn the roast over about 3 hours into the cooking process. I made some substitutions based on what was on hand, onion soup mix, beef broth and 1/2 tsp of Kitchen Bouquet instead of gravy mix and Italian dressing. Sorry about the substitutions but I think the onions on the bottom and flouring the roast would make a great base (ie, gravy) for various flavors. The reason I only gave it 4 stars was because it is very salty.  My husband likes that but I could not serve it to guests.  Conclusion: the method for gravy was great.  Look for lower sodium options.

This was my first slow cooker pot roast! And it was FABULOUS!  Had to make a couple changes. I got a 3 1/2 pound rump roast, added quartered red potatoes and some celery. Two onions instead of one. My husband is allergic to an ingredient that is in nearly all dry gravy packets and jarred gravies, except for one. So I put in a jar and a half of gravy. And also just a couple spoons of minced garlic. It was beautiful! Though I needed to cook it a bit more for everything to be softer.  My husband gave it a 10! Every wife loves to hear that, right? haha :)

My first time using a slow cooker and my boyfriend loved it. I was worried about it being too salty since I suffer from high blood pressure so I used low sodium gravy mix and ranch dip mix. Couldn't find low sodium Italian dressing mix but I picked one with the lowest sodium. I only used pepper to season the meat and I add mini red skin potatoes. It  came out perfect!

I had a 3 3/4 lb. 7 bone chuck roast, and followed the recipe exactly except that I didn't add any salt to anything!  I used 1/2 cup water as directed, then 1/2 cup red wine, three red potatoes, halved and a bay leaf.  Wonderful flavor, nice gravy, and with great leftovers for another meal.  Everything ready and tender after 7 hours.  Thank you for a flavorful recipe!

Best roast beef recipe ever!!  Never would have thought the three dry mixes would go together but boy do they.  My husband is already eating a sandwich from what little was leftover. I didn't add carrots just the onions, roast, mixes and the water an easy no fail roast. Thanks so much for sharing definitely my new roast recipe.

Excellent flavor.  I was pleasantly surprised. Made mashed potatoes and peas for sides.  My roast was 3 1/2 lbs but I did not add additional seasoning packages, just a little extra water (maybe a cup total).  Also threw in extra carrots (10 total).

This is the best pot roast I've ever had! That is what my husband kept saying all through dinner. And I have to agree! I didn't change a thing and it turned out perfect!. The flavor was awesome and it was so tender you could cut it with a fork.

Super good and super easy. I cooked this in the oven on 300 for 4 1/2 hours. Covered roasting pan. Added about a cup more water. Be sure and put the carrots in. They were excellent. Served over mashed potatoes. I did not salt the meat as the packets of seasoning have plenty of salt but did use the pepper. I will be making this again very soon.

this is hard to beat and idiot proof.  only way I do it now.  You don't really need to flour the meat but if you do I recommend browning it--  adds great flavor.  you can whisk in some corn starch mixed with cold water after you remove the roast to thicken the gravy.

Hmmm, not my favorite.  I liked the seasoning ok, but it does have a lot of sodium.  I may not have used enough flour because the gravy was very thin.  The meat was tender, but overall, I just didn't care for it that much.

I've made this several times now. It's my family's favorite way of having a beef roast. I sprinkle the roast with flour, then brown it before putting in crock pot. I always brown roasts first for the color.

Yes and it was fabulous! Two things, I didn't salt the meat, thought there was enough in the dressing,ranch mix and gravy paks. And instead of water I used strong brewed coffee. Made an awesome gravy!

Cooked this last week, added more onions and red potatoes, just because, and about three garlic cloves.  Great...Even better a couple of days later.

My favorite pot roast recipe but I bake it at. 300 for 3 hours in covered casserole dish. I don't add water or flour...just meat with 1 pkg each of brown gravy, Italian dressing, and  ranch dressing over it. Just toss on meat ...( less of  each pkg if roast is smaller than three pounds.) May add veggies last hour if desired. There should be lots of  flavorful  sauce to thicken for gravy at the end of three hours!

I've been using a variation of this for several years now and everyone LOVES it.  I don't bother with the onions, just use brown gravy mix, Italian dressing mix, and the ranch drsg. mix.  I like lots of gravy so I double the mixes...  Mix all the dry ingredients then rub the roast with the mixture.  Place the roast fat side up in the crockpot and sprinkle the rest of the dry mix around the roast in the crockpot.  I use 2 cups of water to cook with and add more at the end if needed to thin it out for gravy.  I also use baby carrots and celery, and sometimes red potatoes, around the roast.  If sodium is the concern,  I think I would decrease the Italian dressing, as I think it has more sodium than the ranch.  It definitely has a stronger flavor, so I think it wouldn't be missed as much in the mix..

Very, very, very good - and incredibly simple! Perfectly thickened gravy. Meat and carrots that are "just right" tender; not so soft as to fall apart, but fork-tender.
 In regard to complaints about saltiness- might be differences in the brand of any of the mix packages. We used Publix mushroom gravy mix (in lieu of beef gravy mix), Hidden Valley Ranch dressing and Good Seasons Italian Salad dressing mix - 1 package of each. Just perfect!  Might cut down on the pepper just a bit next time, but this is most definitely a "keeper" recipe.

My family and I absolutely loved this recipe. I made a few changes due to the amount of meat and timing. I used 4&1/2 pound roast which caused me to change the amount of water to 1&1/4 cups. I also added crushed garlic along with the salt and pepper before coating it with flour, and used two packs of beefy onion dry mix instead of one (because of the amount of water). And because my timing was limited I baked it in the oven at 325 for 5 hours. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!!
Thanks for the goodeats keylimeone,

Like other reviewers, I was skeptical of this recipe but decided to give it a shot. Man am I glad I did! This roast is amazing! So full of flavor. I served it over egg noodles. My husband begged me to make this as often as possible! Definitely going to be a regular recipe in our house!

Made this today & was very impressed!! I followed the directions exactly (although I used reduced sodium brown gravy) & it was fantastic! I made egg noodles to go along with it & also tried it with some leftover mashed potatoes - both were delicious. Thank you for sharing!!

Tried this recipe and loved it.  After reading several reviews, I decided to use an extra cup of water and felt the flavors were perfect. I definitely feel it would have been too salty for my taste if I hadn't added the extra bit of water.  I added a little flour to make gravy and served with mashed potatoes.

The Ranch dressing and Italian dressing mixes! I would have never tried that combination. When combined with beef broth (rather than bouillon or gravy mix), it make the best gravy. I add onion powder to the pepper and flour, and skip real onion. I usually add potatoes and carrots. Perfect for a cold night, and an easy meal to bring to a friend.

The absolute BEST slow cooker pot roast I have ever made.  Was a HUGE hit in my house.  The only thing I added was beef stock for a bit more flavor - not too much and about 2 hours before I was ready for dinner.  I made egg noodles and it was a perfect no fuss meal.  Husband wants me to make this even in the summer!  Now that is a success!

This recipe is amazing. We have never quite figured out what the original recipe author meant by "dry beef gravy mix" so we use brown gravy mix, assuming that's what they meant by beef gravy. The mixture of the gravy mix with the italian and ranch dressing mixes adds flavor to the beef like no other pot roast I have ever tasted. It's amazing! We use baby carrots instead of regular carrots, and we usually add an extra onion and some cubed red potatoes, if there is room in the crock pot.

I just completed this meal; this is very flavorful.  I love a background of vinegar; so this was excellent.  I added about 1 1/2 cup of water; a splash of Mojo marinade and a splash of A-1 sauce; other than that...everything remained the same.  It has been 6.5 hours on low and the meat is falling apart.  Can't wait to add it to the rest of the meal.

This is by far the best roast I have ever made.  Everyone fought over every last piece of beef, potatoes and carrots.  Yes, the ingredients sound a little weird together but...Wow!.  I can't believe how incredibly easy it was, too.  The only thing I did differently was to omit the flour.  I try to cut flour wherever I can because it's really not good for you.  In this case, it wasn't even necessary.  Oh, and I cooked it on a higher temp for only less than 5 hours because I started later than I had planned. Major YUM!  Will be making this again.  (It was already requested for next week.) Thank you, thank you to keylimeone for posting this yumminess.  (Have I mentioned how yummy this was?)


UPDATE:  1/24/16 - I made this tonight.  Comfort food for 30+" of snow in Maryland.  In the past I've made this as posted but the veggies were always a little soft for my liking.  I made the onion slices much wider and decided to wait and add the potatoes, carrots and celery for the last 2 hours of cooking. Perfect!  Everything had just a little bit of firmness to take away the sense of mush.  (I also added a little more than the recommended 1/2 c. water.)

I've made this twice. The first time it was very salty, but good. The second time I used a reduced sodium beef gravy packet and thought it was much better! Thanks for the recipe!

I was also skeptical but I tried it and it was a huge hit.  Have already made it a second time with similar results - didn't alter a thing.

Actually made this as a stew over egg noodles and it was awesome. Boyfriend said it was one of the best meals we've had together. I added potatoes and celery and it just made it! Great heated up as leftovers too. Will be having this a lot this winter!!

Ever since my mom died in 2001, I've tried to duplicate her pot roast with little success. This one did it. It is BETTER than my mom's (sorry dear). I made a smaller roast, but kept all measurements as is. I added mushrooms in the last hour, seared the roast before adding to the crock pot & put all veggies on top, rather than onions on bottom. To address other comments: No additional water was needed whatsoever, BUT my roast was small - a bigger roast might require more. I didn't add any extra salt as the mixes have plenty. Once served, I thought it needed a bit more freshly ground pepper. Fabulous roast & it was gone in less than 30 minutes. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!!

I have tried other slow cooker pot roast recipes and have been disappointed, but this is the one I'll be making from now on.  My picky kids went back for seconds and I didn't have any leftovers. After reading other reviews, I did leave out the salt on the roast, and used 3/4 cup of water.  Very tender, great tasting meat and gravy.

I love how quick this is to put together, and the seasoning combination makes for such an awesome gravy!  I sliced up some potatoes and threw in some baby carrots along with the onions, and those were some of the best potatoes I've had for a while! :D I cooked it on High for 4 1/2 hours because I was pressed for time, and it came out just right, not too tender and not too tough.  Thanks for such a great recipe!  ETA:  I still love this recipe as much as ever, but made it phenomenal with a few changes.  For one, sear the meat.  For two, instead of on High, I cooked it on Low like the recipe said.  I still make it with potatoes--turns out perfect every time!

The first time I made this recipe I followed it exactly and I thought it was good, not great.  For some reason the sauce wasn't that flavorful to me, maybe it was too watery.  I made it today and followed the recipe but instead of mixing the dry packets with water, I mixed it with a can of mushroom soup and a couple tbsp of water.  I poured that over the veggies, including quartered red potatoes, then put it on low for 7 hours (I had a smaller roast- a little less than 2lbs).  It turned out awesome! The sauce was a great consistency (not too thick or thin).  Adding the soup saved me from having to thicken it with corn starch, which would've been a pain.  I think I could've cooked it for less time too, maybe 6.5 hours instead.  But I loved the way it turned out, definitely a keeper!

I love this recipe. I have used this recipe the past five times that I have made a pot roast, and the only thing I did different this last time was I used an extra packet of dry gravy and mixed in some corn starch to make the gravy thicker, because before my gravy was coming out thin. I don't know if it was the extra packet or the corn starch, but it was PERFECT this time. Every time I make this I throw in some fingerling potatoes as well. I will never use another recipe for pot roast!

My family LOVED this. Hubby's not been fond of pot roast dinner till I made this- he had a 2nd helping! couldn't be easier! I added more onions and 2 small cloves of garlic whole because we are an onion/garlic family and also I used a whole cup of water to blend the mixes. There was plenty of gravy. I could see adding some mushrooms if you have mushroom fans. Unfortunately hubby isn't one or I would next time.

it makes a very good roast...I used a 3 lb bottom round roast with fat trimmed...so not too fatty. Yes sodium is high so add more water and larger cut of beef if you like.  Served mine with Pioneer Woman's mashed potatoes and the carrots from the gravy.  I like microwaving the carrots first till soft and adding them in the crock for the last 30 min on high. We go through 2 bags of baby ones. Oh and skipped the flour and searing step altogether....and no onions either.  Still fab!

This roast is awesome and so tender with rich gravy. I did not have beef gravy mix but had a little over half a packet of au jus. I also added lipton onion soup mix and the ranch and italian as suggested in the recipe. I used 2 cups of water to desolve the dry mixes in. I salt and peppered the roast then put in a ziploc and then added the flour, shake and then pound the flour in thru the plastic bag...worked great and clean up was easy. I have never put a roast in the crock pot without browning first and almost did it but decided to go ahead and put it in. There is no need for that browning step, its perfect without it. The color was just right. I used the onions but also put potatos in, then the roast and the carrots all around. Put it on before I went to bed. When I got up the smell coming out of the kitchen was awesome. I just finished eating this masterpiece. Yummm. This will be my standard pot roast recipe. Will be trying this with other cuts of meat as well. Thanks keylimeone for sharting this recipe!

Good Lord! This was just awesome! The only thing I did different was delete the salt and to quickly sear my roast before dropping it in my slow cooker. Nobody had ever eaten such a good roast before (including me)! The only thing I'll change next time I make this is to cut down a little on the ranch dressing mix. It seemed to me to be only slightly prominent (just to me though - since nobody else knew what was in the roast). I think just 1/2 or maybe even 2/3 of a package might work out even better. Thank you very much for this incredible recipe!

This recipe is EXCELLENT!  I've used with with several different roasts (including a pork loin) and my family loved it!  I usually add about 1.5 - 2 cups water, which makes a perfect gravy.

Very easy. The only modifications I made was leaving the potato's and carrots out and serving it with rice instead. Great combination.

The roast itself was really good, i didn't care for the carrots though, they seemed to have soaked up all the salt in the slowcooker.

The roast was fairly decent. Definitely easy to throw together and the meat was very tender. Even though I added potatoes and celery, the gravy was still too salty for me. My husband loved it because he usually pours salt on all of his food, but he didn't reach for the salt shaker this time. The mixture of flavors were good, just salty. I will try this again with maybe half of each of the seasoning packets.

I have made this several times with some revisions. I have used quartered red skins, chopped celery, beef broth, red wine and 2 small cans of tomato sauce. No matter what revisions you make the secret is the 3 dry mix packages. It is fantastic. Throw it in the morning and come home from work and it smells like someone has been cooking all day for you. I usually package some up and take it to my elderly Mom and Dad with a loaf of fresh baked Italian bread. They absolutely love it and so will you.

The roast came out the most tender of any roast I've made....I wasn't so crazy about the after-taste that lingered. Not sure if I will make this again.

Just make it! No-fail recipe that is pure comfort and ease. Surely, using 3 packets for seasoning and gravy is unusual but they are exactly why this recipe is a winner.

I had yet to make a pot roast that was worthy of being made again until I found this recipe. The meat just fell apart, the gravy was excellent. I am so glad to have found a pot roast that doesn't use an onion soup packet and a can of cream of something soup (YUCK!) Next time I will add some more water and make sure to flour my roast even better.

Definitely 5 stars!  I've cooked a lot of pot roasts and this was not only good but easy too!  I read about the saltiness but I was serving to several people so I had a bigger roast.  Used no salt on the roast; only pepper rubbed in before flouring and searing.  Used one packet each with one cup low sodium beef broth as well as about half cup red wine, small potatoes, carrots and onions.  Cooked it in a big covered pot in
 my oven for a couple of hours.  I removed meat and veggies and thickened the gravy with a little corn starch.  It got rave reviews from my family and 
guests, who asked for the recipe.  The meat was 
tender and flavorful and gravy as well without being overly salty.  Veggies were yummy.  I'll he using this one every few weeks as a main, go-to recipe

This was a big hit with my family!  There were NO leftovers!  It just didn't seem like enough liquid, so I added an extra half cup of water and one extra packet of brown gravy mix.  Very flavorful!

you have to know your slow cooker to use this recipe, as 8 hours on low leaves it tough in my cooker.  The flavor was nice, a fairly easy process for the results.

Awesome and easy to prepare. Has great flavor, and the meat is so tender and juicy.  Based on previous reviews, I used a little more water to dilute the salt.

The best roast I've ever had.  I'm not kidding.  I added a bag of mixed veggies and they turned out delicious, kinda soggy, but they were infused with the juice.  I can't say enough good things about this recipe.

Turned out wonderful. 2nd time making it, I added these things plus 1/2 way thru cooking added a can of Heatlthy Request Cream of Chicken soup - wow! to die for! One of the best pot roasts I have ever had!

Wow! Delicious! I didn't have the brown gravy mix. Used a 4 lbs roast and 2 packets each of the ranch and Italian. Also added potatoes. Got rave reviews on this one. Thanks for a flavor explosion pot roast! Oh yeah, I also used beef broth in place of the water. A whole 15 oz can

Best flipping pot roast I've ever had.  And so stinking easy to make!  I accidentally added 2 cups of water to the dry mixes and it was still SOOO flavorful.  I loaded the slow cooker with potatoes, carrots, onions and whole cloves of garlic along with the roast and cooked for 10 hours.  My whole family, 5 and 3 year old included, loved it.  WINNER!

Even the picky 3 year old asked for seconds!  I was afraid it would be too salty, but nope.  Added a little more water than recipe called for so the 'juice' was very thin but still tasty.  Great recipe.

Delicious!  This is by far the best recipe for pot roast I've made so far.  I followed the recipe according to the directions except instead of using whole carrots I substituted them with a large bag of baby carrots. I made red potato mashed potatoes and left the skins on.  My husband liked it so much he agreed to do the dishes (not like him) for making such a great dinner.

I was skeptical of the Ranch and Italian packets in this recipe but it turned out great! I loved the scents coming from the kitchen, filling the house with a delicious aroma! I teamed this dish with mashed potatoes and the whole family enjoyed it.

Very good!  Needed 1 cup water instead of 1/2, and you should omit the extra salt.  It is not needed.  I also added potatos. I loved it, however my son and daughtger-in-law have decided to go "vegan", so they drooled over it, but resisted eating it.  I could not have done that.  The smell was so delicious!  I brought some leftovers for lunch, and the smell is making my co-worker drool.  Now she is not looking forward to her protein bar for lunch :)

WOW!  Such a delicious recipe and it's SO easy to make.  Based on another reviewers suggestion I added a little red cooking wine to the bottom of the crock pot (over the onions) but otherwise followed the recipe as is.  I served it over egg noodles and it was "lick your plate" delicious!  Am definitely adding this to my recipe box!

WONDERFUL!  Put in quartered red potatoes and baby carrots - and cooked it for about 8 hours.  It was PERFECT.  Used the ranch dip mix as someone else suggested as I couldn't find ranch dressing mix.  This is a keeper!

DELICIOUS!! It could use a little bit of salt (but that may have something to do with the fact that I couldn't find a dry Italian dressing packet, so I used the Italian Dressing Mix off of here and there isn't a WHOLE lot of salt in it), and I think I may have put a little more water than called for (I could only find my 1 cup measure and estimated). I also added potatoes for a full meal. It was perfect. Completely tender and tasty, and it smelled so good too! I love using my slow cooker and coming home to a fully-cooked meal! Thank you.

Not sure I will try this again. Meat too tough/stringy. Bland. If I make again, will use red wine. Added beef broth to leftovers. Help a bit.

Overall, a VERY tender and tasty roast - I too was surprised how all the dry mixes came together to make a tasty gravy!  Gravy was a bit thick for me BTW, even with 3/4 cup water added to dry mixes. I'd probably recommend 1 cup minimum for water, unless you like thicker, strong gravy.  No salt needed on outside of roast with flour step - mixes are enough.  VERY easy, great recipe!

OMG soooo good. I omitted the flour and I pierced the entire roast and shoved whole cloves of garlic into it. I added sweet potato, celery and carrots. By far the best pot roast recipe I have tried, and I have tried a lot. Cooked on low for 8 hrs...perfection!

I so wanted this to be good. The dressing mixes sounded like they would be great, unfortunately, even though I only used 3/4 of each packet, the end result was way too salty for me. This is probably a great meal for someone who is a regualr salter.

The beef was super-tender and very tasty. I found that the gravy was considerably too salty, but to the recipe's credit - it may have had to do with the dry mix varieties I chose.

This was perfect!!!  The only thing I changed is that I added cubed potatoes and I added about a half cup of beef stock when there was about 2 hours left.  Definitely 5 stars!  My boyfriend loved it.

Delicious!!!!  My husband ate 3rds!  He said it was the best roast I've ever made & I'd have to agree.  I forgot the garlic, but it tasted delicious without it.  Will definitely make again & again!

I used a packet of Savory pot roast seasoning in place of the packet of beef gravy (I couldn't find one), and used 1 cup of red wine instead of water. I also used a bag of frozen pearl onions instead of sliced & carrots (the hubbs doesn't like carrots), and made garlic roasted red taters on the side. I ended up with a surplus of gravy, so I think I'll go with 1/2 C. of wine next go round. Thanks for the great recipe!

AMAZING! The melt-in-your-mouth kind of pot roast! Didn't change much except I put the flour in a plastic bag with garlic seasoning, salt and pepper. I also addend a pound of mini peeled carrots to the pot. Served this over mashed potatoes with a fresh salad and crusty bread...yum! I'll definitely make this again!

I was a little put off by the combination of the various powdered mixes, but the flavor of the meat actually ended up being quite good. The veggies and gravy were a little too salty for my taste, though. This was really easy to throw together.

This is my step-son's absolute favorite meal (in fact I put it in the crock pot just this morning!).  I use low-sodium gravy mix, and cooking wine instead of water.  The recipe I have always used does not call for coating the roast with flour so I haven't done that, but will definitely give it a try next time.

Best pot roast I ever tried.  

I did brown the roast, added 1 additional packet of brown gravy and a can of coke along with a goodly amount of potatoes and carrots to fill up the slow cooker.  When it was time to eat, I stuck in a fork to dig out the meat and slice it - and all I got were pieces because it completely fell apart.  AWESOME!

Absolutely fantastic. I just recently bought a slow cooker and was looking for an easy recipe to make pot roast...one that had flavor...and boy, does this one have it! I didn't make any alterations (I'm just not good enough at cooking to even come up with any at this time), and it came out fantastic just the way it is.

Super Yummy! I used a lot more water, cause I dont like super salty foods (2-4 cups) and added cubbed potatoes, a tsp of crushed red peppers. I had everything in my pantry and thought that I would give this odd mixture a try, glad I did! :)

I absolutely love this recipe! It's so easy to prepare especially for a novice like me :) My husband and daughter loved it so much. My daughter is not a big eater but she devoured hers. We had dinner earlier than usual yesterday because no one could resist the mouth watering aroma of this food as we walked in the house. I added a bit of water and and I'm thinking of putting in potatoes next time. I already got requests for a repeat from my twosome.

I LOVED this recipe!! Yum! ...the only two things I do differently is add some tomato paste to help thicken the sauce and I use beef broth (less sodium) instead of water.

Best pot roast I've ever made! I followed the recipe with a couple of exceptions suggested by other reviewers: used 1 cup instead of 1/2 cup water, sprinkled some Worcestershire sauce on the meat, and did not salt the meat since there is so much salt in this recipe already.

Came out fantastic! Boyfriend was impressed, and so was I!

Soooo good!! Could not get enough. I did remove the onions and added a package of dry onion soup/dip mix (husband doesn't like actual onions but likes the flavor, so strange) and used 1 cup of water instead of 1/2 cup. Also put about 1 TBS garlic powder, 1 TBS red pepper and a splash of cooking sherry. I added baby carrots halfway through. Let it cook on low for for 6 hours and high for 2 hours. Came out PERFECT. Served it over garlic-cheese mashed potatoes. It is so easy to make and incredibly flavorful!

That was absolutely amazing. I was a little weirded out by all of the mixes that we were putting on it, but it was so amazing. My husband said it was one of the best meals I have made in a long time. I am a pretty good cook, although that last comment may not suggest so. Even the carrots were delicious. Served it with roasted potatoes. SO SO good.

I left out the flour and used a frozen pot roast and a cup of water, plus I had accidentally forgotten to pick up the dry Italian salad dressing mix, so I found a recipe for it online and added the spices myself. I also added an adobo (chipotle) chili for more spice, plus 2 cloves of minced garlic, and 5 chopped green onions. It was SO delicious, and melt in your mouth perfect! I will definitely be making this recipe again!

I usually find roast tasteless and bland, but this roast was anything but bland!  I followed the recipe as is, but increased quantities since I had a larger roast.  The gravy adds some much needed flavor, but isn't so thick and rich that it completely covers the taste of the meat.  My family loved it.  Great recipe!

This turned out great!  My husband the chef even said it's one of the best pot roasts he's ever had.  I thought the three mixes seemed like a little much, but I proceeded anyway.  The only thing I really changed was adding more water. I added more like 1 1/2 cup of water.  The gravy wasn't super thick but it would probably be super salty without the extra water.  I also used a top round roast instead of a chuck roast.  I'm not sure what the difference is but it turned out great.  I will make this again

My family loved this pot roast.  I give it a big thumbs up.  My hubby said"that I can make it every day if I want to".  That's how much he loved it.  And I did not change a thing to it.  So I will be making it agin soon because it was gone the same day and we want more.

So good!  We didn't have some of the ingredients, but I used the cooking spray and onions then added the salt/pepper mix, flour, and added some beef bouillon on top.  My five year old asked for thirds!

This recipe was so easy and the flavor was fantastic.  My meat came out extremely tender.  I used the leftover meat to make breakfast tacos with scrambled eggs, salsa, and cheese.  Yum Yum!

This was excellent! I followed the receipe as listed except I seasoned the chuck roast with "Tastefully Simple" Garlic Pepper seasoning and let it sit overnight. I also added cornstarch to the gravy for thickness and added red potatos as noted by a few other reviewers . My husband loved it!! Definitely a keeper!!

This was a very good pot roast recipe.  I was skeptical, but was really impressed with the flavor of the beef and the sauce.  I did not add the optional carrots, as I had picked up a really big roast that took up my whole crock pot! Otherwise I was going to add a few potatoes and carrots.  The beef gravy mix I used was an "herb seasoned beef gravy" mix, as it was the only one on the shelf that actually had the word beef in it!  Great pot roast- will definitely be making it again!

I too was apprehensive about using all the different packages of salad dressing.  But I was looking for a new crock pot roast recipe so I decided to give it a try.  I will definitely make this again.  My brother and husband devoured it.  Here's the few things I changed:  I did not salt the roast; I floured the roast, peppered and seared in hot oil; and just before serving I added cornstarch to the liquid to thicken the gravy.  I love carrots so I added double the amount of carrots and served with mashed potatoes.  I had intended to take a picture before serving but everyone dug in before I could snap a picture.

This was delicious! Why the four stars then? Well, for one because I left out the extra salt; what was in the package mixes was just right. Secondly, part of the flavor on mine came from the two small cans of sliced (and drained) mushrooms I added somewhat near the end.  I also layered two onions on the bottom of the slow cooker, not one. Finally, I did not add carrots. My original intention was to roast potatoes and carrots in the oven because I love the crispiness of roasted veggies. But since I had leftover rice, we served in over rice and it was so good we will be having the same tomorrow night. The consistency of the gravy was perfect for that.

Two exceptions to the posted recipe, taking the suggestions to use red wine in split with the water and cutting back on salt. Results were superb and it's already been requested for next Sunday.

Great recipe, don't be afraid of the dry mixes, the flavor blend is awesome.   The gravy has a nice robust flavor.  Made it just as published.  Going to try it on a venison roast next.

I love it! I'm from Wisconsin and grew up on a farm, so...I grew up with beef pot roast a lot, especially for Sunday dinner after church! Needless to say, I am not a huge fan of pot roast, but this, to me, in my humble opinion, is excellent!! I will surely make it again and again! I didn't change a thing! I have mashed potatoes with it, since I love potatoes and the gravy from the roast goes right on top! Yumm!! Thank you for the wonderful recipe! I like beef pot roast once again!

Tada!  When you finally see this rich thick gravy, it’s like a magic trick!  What incredible flavors!  Such a simple, easy recipe that I followed except I used a leftover red wine (Chianti) that I had instead of the water.  It complimented the deep beef flavor so well.  The gravy & tender meat are perfect over egg noodles or mashed potatoes.

There is no need to change anything in this recipe other than perhaps omitting extra salt for dietary restriction or preference. Just follow as is and you will have the BEST pot roast perfectly cooked, tender and seasoned. I too will never use any other recipe or oven bag. It doesn’t get any easier-just throw it together in morning, go to work, come home and enjoy. Because I used a 3+ lb. roast I cooked for 9 hours. A wonderful recipe. Don’t hesitate.

Simple meal that yields excellent flavor! The only alteration I made to the recipe was to skip salting the beef prior to cooking. The carrots definitely absorbed the excess sodium from the seasoning packets, which left the beef and gravy tasting terrific (the carrots were edible but not great). I served over buttered noodles. I’ll make this again.

Used beef broth instead of water. Very, very good. I was leery of the ranch but this roast had a fantastic flavour. On HI for an hr, then LO for 7 hrs more for the beef, carrots, celery, and the bottom onions. Oh, ya... Meanwhile... Pan fried the salted/peppered quartered potatoes gently with bacon grease  til just starting to cook... added onion and garlic for 5 min stirring. Added them to the crock at 6 hrs in.  Two hrs later... Oh, man... In 56 yrs, and I'm a dang good eater! I've NEVER had a better roast. It is, imo, the best .

I followed the recipe exactly and this ended up tasting extremely strange. And like the recipe called, I cooked the meat on low for eight hours and it was still not tender! I always read reviews before making recipes and I saw this one had really high reviews which was why I decided to try it.  I really wish I would have went with a different recipe! It has a strange taste to it. I do not understand the high reviews in this one.  Waste of good meat and had to make a different dish for the family.

I liked this a lot. It was easy, tender, and tasty. I skipped the salt on the roast as recommended by other but next time I won’t.

This is great! I'm on a low carb diet, so the only veg I added was onion and mushrooms.  I served it with a side of mashed cauliflower with cheese.  Fabuloso!

I made this I like it,   I was skeptical of adding 3 packets of flavoring but followed instructions all except I used 1/2 cup of red wine and 1/2 cup water replacing the 1 cup of water and my dry beef gravy packet was only .87 ounces instead of 1 full ounce but it was all I could find the flavor is good I  will make this again.  I did add small red potatoes its been all while since  I used a slow cooker but everything cooked thru nicely on Low but took about  8-9 hours .  Ps I did not salt the meat only pepper

I made this with the ranch dip mix instead of the dressing mix because of the comments saying it was salty.  Also, I added potatoes.  We really enjoyed it.  If I made it again, I would double the amount of gravy.

Fantastic recipe. When I first tested it fresh from the slow cooker, I wasn't blown out of the water. Like most dishes, this recipe came to life after spending a night in the fridge. This dish in particular seems to benefit from it however. Also, I caution against using a fatty cut of meat as this will turn out to be fat city. 

tldr; stick it in the fridge overnight before consuming it the next day then thank me later. also, user a leaner cut of meat.

cheers

Awesome. Fabulous. Wow. I would've included a picture, but it got scarfed up too fast. Nothing to take a picture of here except an empty crock pot and smiling happy people with full bellies.
Barely strayed from this perfect recipe by adding celery and a lot more onions. Used a five pound chuck roast. Of course I always stab it with a knife and insert buttons of garlic. 
Thank you KeyLimeOne !
Perfection !

I like the flavour, but it is quite salty.  The second time I made it, I omitted salting the roast, used low sodium gravy mix, and made my own Italian dressing mix so I could cut the salt in that too.  It helped.

I’ve made this pot roast twice.  First time made was done exactly as given.  Flavorful. No leftovers!  Next time, I added baby carrots and small red potatoes, both sliced in half.  TIPS:  Use cooker liners by Reynolds.  OMG they are wonderful creations!!  Also, avoid mess of pressing flour onto roast, just use the palm of one hand to press down with other hand.

Added a bulb of garlic for medicinal purposes.  Would probably brown roast 1st next time.  The final gravy had just a bit of fat/grease, not too much, but it was noticeable.  The gravy was still excellent.

I was raised in East Tennessee, and before today I thought I knew how to cook a pot roast. I have never been more impressed with a recipe in my life. Is it a little salty? Sure it is and that's fine and I'm sure there are ways to lessen that but the taste and the flavor that is generated by this recipe is absolutely astounding. I followed it to T outside of adding some potatoes that I cut in half to the slow cooker and it is just amazing. there's just enough gravy do you use on the veggies and on the pot roast... Just perfection!

Ok I didn’t want to like this recipe because I’m very partial to the way I make my pot roast, but hubby wanted a new way, so I gave it a try. WOW! Yum! I browned my roast and sautéed the onions first and added 3/4 cup

Recipe to Keep
Only change to recipe is:  Used 1 can of Cream of Mushroom soup and 1/2 can of water, and half of the onion soup mix to cut down of salt.  Did not add vegetables.  When roast was done, added water and cornstarch to make gravy.  Served with mashed pot  It was full of flavor and it was delicious too.  Will make again.

It was delicious!! I agree that I was worried about the combination of flavors, but it turned out to be the best pot roast I’ve eaten. Definitely need more water, I added about 2 c water and it could have used a bit more. But it was sooo good!

Such a good dinner for a busy day! I do everything the recipe says except I add more water for more gravy and a bay leaf. I also add celery and mushrooms to the crock pot we love veggies with the roast after. Before serving I whipp up some mashed potatoes and it's amazing! 

Like others before I have made this with cubed potatoes in it and I wouldn't recommend it that way. It's to long for them and they start to fall apart and become mush. Making mashed separately is much better.

Will definitely make again— very quick and easy!

Instead of onions, I had a frozen bag of pearl onions that needed to be used— it was perfect!!
I did put some Worcestershire sauce in (~ 1Tbsp) ; I did not salt the meat at all.

Definitely will be repeated in my house!!  Yum

This was one recipe I was hesitant to try because the packet mixture for the sauce sounds so gross together. The reviews were too good not to try it though! It was SOOOOO GOOD!! I was also weirded out that it didn’t call for enough liquid to cover the meat. It still turns out great! I added a little more water, little tiny potatoes, baby carrots instead of cutting them up, and celery to it. I boiled up some egg noodles and served it over them! I will definitely be making this again!

Absolutely the best Pot Roast I’ve ever had- Hubbs agreed! The flavor was out of this world- almost buttery without using any butter at all. Super tender as well. I had to make some last minute changes as I tried to use my Instantpot as a slow cooker, and it didn’t work, so I transferred to the oven and cooked for 3 hours at 300. I added Onion Soup mix, as well as garlic gloves, red potatoes, mushrooms, and celery. I also sautéed the onions and garlic first, and browned the roast on each side before transferring to the oven.

I made this pot roast today and used all of the ingredients listed with just a few modifications.  I coated the roast in Wegmans searing flour and then seared it in my Ninja cooker alongside the onions.  I used baby carrots and added baby medley potatoes (white, red and purple).  I added a half cup of red wine to the 1/2 cup of water because I felt I needed more liquid since I added the potatoes.  I did not add salt and pepper until it was time to eat this luscious roast because the basting flour has salt in it.  It didn't require much as it was very flavorful.  I would consider adding more flour next time to thicken the gravy but it was fine the way it was.   My husband loved it!

My husband and I thought this was very good, I especially thought that it was the easiest dinner I ever prepared. the picture shows potatoes and I love them in this type of dish so I steamed a few small ones and added them at the end.  I didn't find this salty at all, because of our advanced years I buy everything I can "low sodium" including all dressings, soup mixes and gravy mixes. I wouldn't say that this was the "best" chuck roast I have ever had but it was certainly the best considering so little effort put forth.  I'll be making this one again.

Best pot roast EVER! Used a generous amount of flour and left it on the roast, added a cup of water, a couple of dashes of Worcestershire sauce, used baby carrots and cubed potatoes. Perfect! Turned roast over in cooker 1/2 way through so both sides were moist. Because of the added flour, gravy was just right and potatoes cut the saltiness.

I can't even believe how good this is. Followed exactly except I forgot to rub salt on the roast. That mistake turned out in my favor as the dish was just salty enough on it's own.

Very flavorful, however, I was confused looking at the photo and comparing it to the recipe. I noticed celery and potatoes yet none are mentioned. Mixes are nice but too many can make a very salty taste. I dropped the Italian dressing mix and added fresh Italian herbs instead. Diced celery joined the onions in the beginning. Also added a layer of thin sliced red peppers. Carrots  and then after, canned potatoes (no sodium) with the juice intact. It turned into an excellent dish!

The three envelopes of seasoning, and the long slow cook, made a yummy thick gravy, with lots of flavor. My wife and daughter gave kudos.  I did it as written, with a few stalks of celery added. Next time I'll use mushrooms as well. Rockin good!!

I was hesitant with the dry mix packages, but I also did not have Beef gravy mix. The brown gravyix was used in place, and it came it out perfect. I love how the Italian mix really brings out the flavor. My household devoured this meal. Next time, I will be sure to have the correct ingredients. Either way, this is now the new go to pot roast recipe. Thank you so much for sharing.

I was VERY apprehensive when I read through the ingredients... THIS DISH IS AMZING! I am saving this for my go-to roast! Tender, juicy and very flavorful! I’m not a big crockpot fan but this dish will make me keep one in the cabinets! Soooo good!

I added potatoes but that was the only change I made. The roast and flavorful. Honestly, this was such an easy and delicious recipe that my children both loved. I WILL be making it again.

This is now my go-to pot roast recipe. Easy and delcious! Lots of "gravy", so add noodles, mashed potatoes, or a hearty rustic bread to sop it all up.

This was simple to prep (10 minutes) & delicious. Even my picky eaters loved it. I was cautious about the salt because of the mixes used to season it so I only used a pinch of salt on the meat and low sodium brown gravy mix. It was perfect. I served it with mashed potatoes. I’ll be making this again and even though I have ideas of alterations, I may not change a thing. It was that good! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I made a few tweaks & it's perfect! I didnt have Italian seasoning so I used approx. 1/4 cup of Italian bread crumbs & 1/4 cup of Italian dressing. I also didn't have spray cooking oil or whole carrots, so I used Olive Pomace Oil & 3 cups of slightly thawed, prediced carrots. I also added small pieces of cut up white potatoes. For the first 2 hrs I had my slow cooker on high, then on low for the remaining 6 hrs. After the first 2 hrs, I opened my slow cooker & added 2 tbsps of flour, 1 tbsp of water, & 3 tbsps of Worchesteshire sauce(I wanted a thicker, more flavorful sauce). I also made cuts in the roast after the 1st 2 hrs so that it would truly be cooked thoroughly. I hope everyone enjoys! :-)

I am use to making a traditional pot roast in the oven, but was looking for an easier option since I work full time. Wow was this fantastic! I wasn’t sure about it because it seemed like a lot of seasoning but they flavor was incredible.  Just a couple of notes I would add - be careful how much salt you put directly on the roast, the season packets have a lot already. I also used 3/4 a cup of water - I like extra gravy for the mashed potatoes.  My husband loved it so much, he almost licked the plate clean! Defiantly making this one again

So tender, so juicy. I followed instructions exactly and we got home 2 hours late, and it was sooooo good. So, it’s ok to let it cook 10 hours.

I have made this recipe twice and my husband LOVES it! We added potatoes and fresh tomatoes and doubled the recipe this time because it wasn't enough to last him all week last time. Also added 1 1/4 cups beef broth because he wanted it more soupy like a stew. Delicious!

Super easy to put together and my family loved it!  I used a second pack of gravy mix and 1.5ish cups of water because I used a 4+ lb roast, but I didn't really need to.  It made at least 3 cups of gravy!  It was a tiny bit salty.  I will use less salt directly on the meat next time or maybe use a low sodium version of one or more of the mixes.  I used maybe a lb of bagged baby carrots.  They were delicious.  The family definitely wants me to make it again!

I made it w/o the onions and it was great! I added potatoes like many others. My slice of meat was a little smaller so it was done in a little over 6.5 hours. I’ll be making this often. Oh, and I served it over rice as well.

First of all like most people I was very surprised at the flavor of this. It is wonderful. I also more than doubled the recipe and used corn starch instead of flour for the sauce and instead of water used beef broth. I also used just the pre cut baby carrots and canned potatoes. The carrots came out perfect for the 8 hours the meat cooked and the potatoes I just added in the last hour. My one issue with this is I used quite a bit larger roast than the one in the directions and at 8 hours was still pretty chewy. I guess every cooker is different but if I made this again I would probably do no longer than 6 hours, cut the roast/add the potatoes for the last hour so no longer than 7 hours total. If the roast was a bit less chewy I would give it 5/5 for sure.

This was amazing, and refreshingly easy! I was worried it would be a bit salty even before reading some of the reviews, plus I was too lazy to make potatoes separately, so I skipped the salt and dumped cubed red potatoes in the pot. I also tossed in celery and mushrooms. End result did not taste overly salty at all, and hubby absolutely loved it.

I am disappointed.  This is my first bad review of a recipe.  My family and I did not care for the Ranch and Italian dressing packets, in the gravy.  It did make a good thick gravy however. 
I used a 2 1/2# Arm roast.  That was the only difference.
Sorry, just did not like the taste of the gravy.

I have never been a fan of pot roast because it always seem to lack flavor. This was my first time making this and it came out beyond what I had expected. I also added potatoes in the crockpot mixture. The gravy was just enough flavor to cover the beef when I spread it over brown rice. I would recommend this recipe to anyone who loves pot roast.

While the onions and roast came out great, the carrots were undercooked.  And I missed having potatoes.  I'm going to save the "gravy" recipe and use that again for sure!

Tasted so good! My daughter loved it so much and wanted seconds!! I added a few things like substituting heirloom carrots, put some old bay in the flour with salt and pepper, and diced tomatoes. It was sooooo good! Thank you!

Perfect! After reading comments I omitted the salt on the meat and used a reduced sodium packet for the beef gravy mix. Will definitely make again.

Yummy. I took several of the reviews and tried to incorporate some of the suggestions. The only negative for me, was the sauce was too thin. Next time I will either add more flour, or decrease liquid. or put it in a pan and thicken it .

Great flavoring except the others are right. A little too salty. One person mentioned to only use pepper in the first step and skip the salt. That would probably work. I will definitely make this again.

Everyone loved it! I did not do the flour step and used way more water. I added potatoes, because that is how I have always made roasts. I thought the combination of packages was odd but it turned out so well! Yes, it was a bit salty, even though I did not add any more per reviews, maybe the potatoes helped calm it down some. Next time I'll use a lower sodium package of gravy or something to help with that issue. Will definitely do again.

This is really yummy! I took the advice of others and did not add salt. I used 1/2 cup red wine and ¼ cup water. I also added some of the leftover flour to the spice mix, plus quartered small red potatoes. Turned out really well. I’ll be making this many times in the future.

I used Hidden Valley Ranch Dip mix since that is what I had on hand.  Also, I used onion soup mix instead of Italian dressing mix.  L.astly, I added baby potatoes, carrots, and onions.  This was so tender and had GREAT flavor!

Fantastic recipe. I have made this about 10 times at least and it never disappoints! I now skip the flour/seer, always use the herb gravy mix, and I always include onions and baby potatoes.

It was great, But It NEEDS to have some vegetables in there to help soak up the salt, god  it was salty when I first ate it. Just keep that in mind I think I'm going to put it in halfs of those small potatoes and hopefully that will help, Also I'm not going to bother salting the roast next time ill update this when id do to say how it turned out,

This is a solid pit roast recipe and very easy to make. Minimizing additional salt is a good idea with this one. Alterations made include: adding 1 cup red cooking wine, adding around 1.3 lbs of quartered red potatoes, adding as many sliced celery stalks as we had, and adding a few more carrots (which we cut into 1/3s)

This was pretty darn good but we’d like to tweak it a bit more to our liking. Floured and seared the roast before adding to pot, used red wine for gravy, added baby carrots, quartered baby gold potatoes, and celery. The gravy mix was reduced sodium and we didn’t add any extra salt to flavor the meat. Salt level came out on this was for us. We thought the flavor was good but a little too tangy for our taste (however, we’ve been eating it as leftovers and that flavor has softened up a bit). If you’re skeptical, give it a go! Try first, tweak second. Enjoy!

EXCELLENT!!!  I followed the recipe exactly but with the addition of potatoes and one stalk of celery.  I’ve always prepared chuck roasts in the oven, and old habits are hard to break!  But it was a lazy Saturday morning, and I decided to try this recipe, based on others’ reviews.  So glad I did!  This will be my go-to recipe from now on!  YUM!

You can’t go wrong with this recipe—it’s simple to make and certainly as good as any pot roast I’ve ever had. I was nervous about making it because I’d never made a pot roast —it is totally outside the realm of things I normally cook. However, I’m engaged to a guy with three teenage sons and they are all serious carnivores. They all love it—and I must admit, it’s really good.

Very good but almost too rich. I took the carrots out after about 5 hours because they were already cooked. Cooked roast for 7 hours instead of 8. I would use a low sodium beef gravy mix next time and I’m not sure that salt needs to be added to the roast as the recipe calls for. Very rich in salt flavor with the packages of ingredients.

So, I made this as a beef stew instead of a pot roast, but it was amazing! I added celery, potatoes, onion, carrots and beef stew meat (I still covered the meat in flour like the recipe suggested). I doubled the ranch dressing mix, Italian dressing mix, gravy mix and water and cooked on low for about 8 hours. I did end up adding a little extra water in the beginning to reach the bottom of the meat. It was not salty at all. I know I changed it quite a bit, but the sauce is what makes this so good.

The best pot roast I’ve ever made, or had. I followed the recipe exactly as said, except for the water part I had read some of the reviews and someone suggested 3/4 cups of water if I didn’t want the gravy as thick. It turned out out so good and tender. My family loved it as well!

This was a really good recipe! While I was browning my roast on all 4 sides in a skillet, I cooked a small pot of cubed potatoes. I then pressure cooked my roast to cut down on timing. Once that was done, I placed sliced onions, cooked potatoes,  and big chunks of carrot in the bottom of a dutch oven, and placed the semi cooked roast on top. Everything else to this recipe i did to a T (although I did add a little bit more water). The sweetness of the onions complimented the potatoes/carrots really well. I will definately make this again!

This was a very tasty dish.  I added a 1/4 c red wine, baby white potatoes & fresh mushrooms.  Big hit & plenty of gravey produced.  Will be a winter staple for our family!

It turned out awesome,, I increased the water to 3/4cup and used about 2 Tbs of the flour dusting the onion before setting the roast in,I also used some red potatoes on top with the carrots and cooked on high 5 hrs and then used a stick blender to mix the gravy,,nice and thick,super yummy.

This was delicious and extremely easy!  I used baby carrots instead of regular so that I could just throw them in as opposed to peeling and chopping.  I did read some comments and decided to add a couple dashes of Worcestershire sauce.  I also did 1/2 c of Chianti with 1/2 c of water to mix the dry seasonings with as suggested by another reviewer because I was concerned it wouldn’t be moist enough.  I think next time I’ll do 1/4 c of each (1/2 c total as indicated in the recipe) as the gravy was a bit too runny for my taste.  But, that being said, the flavor was absolutely delicious and the meat was very moist!  Will definitely be using this as my go-to pot roast recipe from now on!

This was delicious!  I substituted red wine for the water and added mushrooms as suggested in the video and served it over smashed red potatoes.  I don't usually cook with pre packaged mixes, but I'll make an exception again for this recipe.

This is a very simple yet flavorful recipe!  I left out the salt and added chopped red potatoes. Turned out great!

Easily the best pot roast recipe I have tried.  I used low sodium brown gravy mix, added another third cup of water and two tablespoons of flour to get more gravy.  I was VERY pleased with the results.

I used an elk roast with this and it was amazing! The only thing I did differently was the potatoes. My family likes baked so I wrapped them in foil and placed them around the roast for the last few hours. Best roast I’ve ever made, including my grandmas recipe.

This recipe rocks!!! I made this tonight and can’t believe how great it turned out. I did flour the beef & then browned the meat in a hot skillet. I can’t tell if it really did anything. I did not think it was salty at all. I used baby carrots which were fantastic with the beef. Others added potatoes but I simply served it over mashed potatoes.

OMG, this was the best pot roast, EVER! Even my hubby who rarely eats beef loved it. I followed the recipe to the letter, except for adding potatoes and I put them in first, followed by the onions & beef. So tender and delicious! I too, was concerned about the packet mixes, but what an amazing flavor and gravy it created. Can’t wait to make it again. It’s fall, so tis the season.

I also thought that this was extremely salty. My husband loved it. We have leftovers and I'm not sure I even want to eat anymore. Maybe the dry ingredients will come in a low salt version. I'll check next time I go to the store.

Great, simple slow cooker recipe.  I made a few slight changes: I seasoned and seared the roast in a pan with some olive oil before transferring to the pot.  I added a sliced mushroom medley, a small sweet potato and 2 Yukon gold potatoes.  The gravy turned out yummy!

I haven't made this yet, but, I've been looking for a new recipe for pot roast, the way I made it, it tasted so bland. I was just using Lipton onion soup mix and it just tasted so, blah. I can't wait to try this recipe, it looks so easy and yummy!!!

Followed the recipe nearly to exact.  We added some chopped bell pepper and celery, because we had it left over from a previous meal, and we had to put some quartered potatoes over the top of the whole thing.  It turned out amazing!  We have this saved and will make it the same for the next roast.

I made this, loved it, made it again, and again, and it is now our standing "Sunday Roast" recipe.  I have tried a few variations; 1 cup chicken stock instead of 1/2 cup water boosts flavor and makes more of the delicious gravy.  Various steak seasonings instead of Italian Seasoning varies the flavor (our favorite so far is 2 Tbsp Kinders' Buttery Steakhouse Seasoning (spice jar aisle at supermarket) for a peppery gravy), and I add washed, quartered potatoes around the outside of the roast, with the carrots.  I also warm rolls on top of the cooker for last 10 mins before serving.
LEFTOVERS: Hot beef and gravy rolls or add BBQ sauce for sliders next day.  Cook once, eat twice!

Made per the recipe, added diced celery and couple tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce directly on roast before adding package mixture. The gravy/Italian/Ranch dressing packets made a delicious flavor and wonderful gravy. I won't use anything else now.

This is the absolute best pot roast I have ever had.  I followed the recipe to the T with only a slight deviation.  I only used half of the ranch dressing mix because it contained MSG. Watch for this when picking out the dressings. I won’t  change a thing when I make it next time. Except to get a bigger roast!! 1/2c of water was plenty.

Very simple.  Adding all ingredients at the start made it easier than cooking the protein, itself, then remembering to add the vegetables later.  I did add a 1/2 cup of red wine.

Like everyone else the packets of seasonings seemed a little weird but once it was all in the crockpot and cooking it smelled delicious.

Came up on the old school side of Pot Roast and this was an attempt at a twist.  Put in more veggies on this recipe.  Found the flavoring a bit distracting; sort of earthen flavored although no mushrooms. Although I like the flour concept, this was a one and done.

It is good, but salty. I don't usually cook with a lot of salt. Putting a bunch of potatoes in helps though.

I really don't like to make changes/additions to a recipe, until I've made it as written first. But when you have all the spices except 1, what do you? I didn't have packaged Italian Dressing, but I did have a dried herb mix with some of the same herbs as the dressing mix, so I used that. Penzey's Bouquet Garni (Hand-mixed from: savory, rosemary, thyme, Turkish oregano, basil, dill weed, marjoram, sage and tarragon). Oh my, the best Pot Roast ever!!! It also naturally makes a nicely flavored gravy for the mashed potatoes I made to go with it. I read the many "too salty" reviews and had I had and used the packaged Italian Dressing, it very well could have been. But with the salt free herb mix I used, it was perfect. Penzey's also has an Italian Herb mix, which I would have used, if I had it. If you have never heard of or used Penzey's spices, you are missing out.

I made this last night. I put it on before I went to bed. It had me up all night smelling the goodness. The ingredients were simple but it was definitely salty. Not unbearable but it was/is salty. I will make This again but must figure out how to eliminate some of the saltiness.

Waaaaaaaaay to much salt flavor. I didn’t add any salt. The only changes I made were to add an extra onion, fresh garlic, and some red wine. The salt was very overpowering especially when we had it the second night for leftovers.

Used a blade roast and I was delicious and tender...best roast I’ve ever made and it got rave reviews at hubby’s bday dinner. Added baby potatoes. And served w bacon wrapped green beans. With the 3/4 c water and juices, I think I’ll use the leftover liquid for a beef stew. Yummm!

Definitely a keeper!  Everyone loved it!  I used a sirloin tip roast, and was so tender and delish!  I added baby red potatoes (as well as the carrots), and that was an awesome addition.  I couldn't find dried beef gravy, so I subbed a beef stew dry mix, and will probably use that again.  Very tasty and thrilled it tuned out so yummy!

The perfect pot roast flavor, it reminds me of my mom’s cooking. Also unbelievably easy! I’ve shied away from other pot roast recipes because the recipes looked complicatedly long and intense. But this is so simple yet so tasty!

I made 2 of these at once (mother-in-law in hospital), one with chuck roast, one with rump roast. Both turned out great! (I preferred the rump roast).
I was skeptical at first as I am a traditionalist and dont like to use spice packets, etc, but this was phenomenal! I naturally added  a few handfuls of garlic cloves and omitted the onion, but that is just my preference.
Definitely a keeper!

As tasty as the 1,000+ positive reviews say. I made it exactly as the original recipe said, and it was delicious. I might try using wine next time to kick it up an extra notch, but it was flavorful and tender exactly as written.

the hubby just called and said "we destroyed that pot roast!" I'm a busy working mom and didn't have time for all the steps so here are my changes: skipped the flour salt pepper process at the beginning and just threw the meat into the crock pot. I didn't have powdered gravy so I used a jar of Heinz beef gravy mixed with Italian  and ranch seasoning packets. added about 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire. cut up the vegetables and threw them on top of the meat with a small can of mushrooms and poured the sauce over top. Threw in about a tablespoon of peppercorns and some dried garlic.  Done. super easy! thanks for the recipe!

Great mix of flavors.  I cooked the onions a bit in a pan with some oil to get it a bit translucent before I put them in the crock pot, but this recipe is REALLY good.  Will definitely use it again.  Soon.

Fantastic! I too was skeptical about the 3 dry packets. It was really good. Took the advice of other reviews and added some peeled potatoes and I think that helped balance out the salt.  In fact, it wasn’t salty at all! I even added a bit of salt to my serving.

So I've followed this recipe exactly as written, with the exception of adding melody potatoes, and my family loves it! I made it for Christmas dinner and my boyfriend said it was the best pot roast he ever had and he almost went in for a 3rd helping. 

I've made this recipe twice and the first time I used low sodium gravy mix and didn't salt the beef because my family has a history of hypertension, but the second time I used regular gravy and salted the beef. Even though my family didn't think so, I personally thought it tasted a bit too salty. I think I'll stick with the low sodium approach, but I still love it!

Turned out great. I agree, you only needed one can of cream  of musher soup.  Makes enough gravy. I modified a bit. Browned the chuck roast before  putting in slow cooker. I also added  dry Rosemary sprigs .  cooked on low for close to  9 hours.

This is really good and simple - it doesn't seem like the recipe calls for enough liquid, but it ends up making a ton of gravy. I used a french onion dip mix packet instead of Ranch dressing mix (I was cooking for a dairy-free group and couldn't find dairy-free Ranch), and it was great. I added red potatoes in addition to the onion and carrots - definitely a good call. I would make this again. It warms over well too.

I've made this several times and it always comes out great though I do add to it a bit. I add extra of the three dry mixes, additional water as it cooks but not too much, a little beef stock and Heinz beef gravy. It makes for a thicker and more flavorful "sauce" like consistency. It disappears quickly every time.

I made the recipe exactly as written to give it a fair review. My husband liked it best, but our girls (teenagers) and I thought it was just okay. The roast was super tender, but we found the flavor a little...odd. We didn't care much for the gravy, or the carrots. They had an oddly sour taste. I am glad I tried it, but I doubt I would make it again.

My husband loved it but DO NOT add any salt.  I used a chuck roast and it took longer than 8 hours on low.  We loved the leftover gravy over bread. Will definitely make again.

All of the packages seasonings make the gravy pretty salty. Otherwise, the meet and vegetables were terrific.

The roast was cut with a fork tender. I followed the recipe & had no substitutions. However, we didn't find it very flavorful. Due to the lack of flavor, I won't be making this again.

I've got a few good pot roast recipes but this is hands down my favorite.  I made 9 pounds worth of roast (as well as a large bird) for 25 people on Thanksgiving.  My guests raved about it.  I followed some of the suggestions of other readers: omitted the salt in the beginning, added potatoes to the crock pot, added a full beer and some beef broth (for such a large amount I needed 3 crock pots!).  The gravy was plentiful and only took a few minutes stove top to boil down to the perfect consistency.  I did not need to add any flour.  This was great!

This is an old and favorite stand-by in our house-have been making this for years. The only things I do differently are: (1) I add some cut up potatoes to the bottom of the crock pot; and (2) I do not pound flour into my roast, but I do rub it with a seasoning rub (no, I do not brown it before putting it in the crock pot. You can use regular or “zesty” Italian dressing.

Delicious! I’ve made it several times, and the only change is that I don’t flour the roast. Also, when I don’t have powdered Italian dressing I use the bottled stuff & omit the water. I always add potatoes and, occasionally, summer squash (only for the last couple hours)

This is a very good recipe! A few things differently,  We made ours in the pressure cooker with potatoes and carrots and didn't flour it. Also didn't have packet of gravy so used a can, didn't make a difference. Turned out great! So much flavor, wasn't too salty until the leftovers the next day then it was a bit but still very good! Recommend!

I made this with the ingredients as listed. The only thing I did differently was to sear the beef with salt, pepper & garlic powder before putting it in the crock pot.  I thought this roast was good but nothing I'd brag about, my husband on the other hand thought it was excellent so I'm giving it 4 stars. It was easy to make and I'll definitely try it again. Food is subjective and maybe my taste buds were a bit off.  I thought it was bland personally

Love this recipe! Have made this several times and it’s consistently delicious. When I haven’t had the gravy mix on hand I’ve substituted a package of beefy onion soup mix and just thickened the gravy a bit more before serving. Thank you for sharing!

My hubby loved this recipe.  I thought it was good.  The meat stayed moist and tender.  However, it was a little salty.  If I make it again, I would probably look for the packets with less sodium.

Sorry for not giving it 5 stars. I made it exactly as written (as I typically do the first time) ......... and, frankly, I thought it was just OK. I prepared it using the exact ingredients and slow-cooked it for 8 hours on low. The many reviews just raved about the flavor and tenderness. It was tender, but lacked any real savory flavor.

Excellent!! I made it exactly like it says. My roast was a bit less than 2.5 lbs so I only cooked it for 7 hours on low. It could not have been more perfect! It fell apart and was so tender! This was my first successful roast in 13 years of trying to cook a roast!

Made exactly as directed but also threw in a packet of baby Portobello mushrooms. Turned out beautifully, easy to make, and had no issues with salt but I did pick packets of gravy, ranch and Italian dressing that had less sodium.

Like many others I also was skeptical but wow...this was absolutely amazing!  I followed the advice of some other reviewers and did not add salt and it was perfect.  I also used beef broth instead of water and added some Worcester sauce.  This will be a keeper for our family’s menu!

I made this last Sunday, followed most of the directions but made a few changes. Instead of spraying the inside of the pot I used a slow cooker bag which really made clean up easier. Instead of using whole carrots I used  pre-peeled and ready cut baby carrots and did use 4 potatoes. It was wonderfully delicious.

This was very good though quite salty.  I used a little more than a cup of water because I didn't want it to dry out, the amount of liquid was perfect.

Best pot roast I have tasted!!!!  we like our pot roast on the soup side vs a thick gravy.  I used one brown gravy packet and 3/4 of a ranch dressing packet. I was perfect for us. Try this recipe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I made this recipe as written and was not impressed. I was leery about the use of all the packaged mixes, but my curiosity got the better of me, especially with all the positive reviews.  Indeed, however, the gravy turned out to have a very unpleasant, chemical taste to it, and I threw out the leftovers. I will not make this again.

This is excellent and a family favorite. The first time I made it I followed the directions exactly. It was wonderful and my kids begged for me to make it again.
The next time I used wine instead of water for the gravy mix. I use one of those small bottles that are a dollar. Then dumped the rest of it on the roast. The flavor was top notch. It was pinot. I used small carrots only because that is my husbands preference.

I followed the recipe - it was fantastic.   My slow cooker, even on low, cooks much faster than many of the recipes state.  I cooked a 3 lb pot roast for 6 hours and it was perfect.  A keeper for sure.  Thanks for sharing.

I followed one suggestion for 2 cups beef broth vs 1/2 cup water.  I also added other veggies in addition to carrots and onion.  I might reduce amount of beef broth next time for thicker gravy.  Overall very tasty and you can’t beat crock pot cooking for busy lives!

I got an email for this and had to review!  I’ve made this sooo many times.  It’s my 7 yr old son’s favorite meal.  I have always mixed the seasonings with 1 cup water . I don’t even flour it any more.  I don’t like it thick.  I put any veggies in half way through.  I keep these 3 packets seasoning on hand just for this ! Just try it !

Delicious and Super Easy! Thought the ingredients were an odd combination but it worked out beautifully. The only changes I made was I cooked on high for 4hrs in cockpot instead of 8hrs. I also omitted seasoning the meat with salt due to the previous reviews stating it was too salty. Didn't even miss the salt. Very flavorful!

I've made this 10 times or more. There is nothing to change because the recipe is delicious as is. However, I have added quartered sweet onions, green beans, canned diced tomatoes and barley to round out the nutritional content. Make this; you won't be sorry.

Its alright.  I don’t like all the extra water in the crockpot when I come home! I think I’m gonna stick to cooking chicken in the crockpot.

We’ve made dozens of pot roasts over the years and this is by far the best ! One half cup water with the dressings and worked out perfectly.

Best pot roast recipe ever. Did not flour the roast. Used 1 c water and 1/2 c red wine. Gravy turned out perfect for us. Did not use any salt and previous reviews said it was too salty.

Oh my God this roast came out so good, I couldn’t stop digging into my crockpot. I followed the recipe exactly except I added baby golden potatoes and a side of green beans. This recipe is so simple and takes no time at all. The roast came out fork tender and full of flavor. My new favorite crockpot recipe. Thanks!!

Meat was tough and sauce very thin.  Made a cornstarch roux to thicken. It was flavorful but not tender like I expected.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Won't make again.

It was really good!  I haven't had much luck with the crockpot in the past but this was so easy and so tasty! I will definitely reduce the salt because I personally found it too salty but that's an easy fix!

The meat had a good taste, but the gravy became rather thick for me. I would suggest adding more water than suggested and the gravy needed something to offset the kinda salty taste.

I did make a couple changes, I was concerned with all the pkgs. I did make my own Italian dry, omitted the salt, used 1/2 pkg ranch, got the low sodium gravy pkg. I added red potatoes, carrots, mushrooms, celery  a splash of red wine  and Low sodium Lea Perrins' Worcestershire. I used about a cup of water, next time will add a little more.  At the end, I had to add some sea salt LOL. I peppered,  floured and browned roast, caramelized my onions. It was delish, Thanks for a great recipe, will be my go to for sure. Can toss all others.  I love anything I can cook in my Ninja, 4 stars because  I tweaked.

I made this pretty much to recipe. Only exception is that I added celery and fingerling potatoes to the vegetables. Outstanding flavor and awesome gravy! Some folks commented that it was salty so I did not use salt on the beef. However my final product needed a little salt. That's ok, better safe than sorry.

It was good. I decided not to add the salt because the dry mixes of ranch dressing etc was salty enough. Overall, it was delish!

The only change I made was adding more water, I wanted to cook red potatoes and carrots with the roast. The meat was moist and flavorful and so were my veggies. I will definitely cook this again!

Great easy recipe - everyone at home loved it!! Follow the directions and you can't go wrong:-) I would only change the following. The recipe calls for 1/2 cup of water; I would add a full cup + to keep the roast from drying out and also 1/4 of red wine for some extra zest! Enjoy!

What a great recipe!  I was skeptical about the 3 dry mixes, but wow - great flavor.   Only 2 tweaks - which ultimately really wasn't necessary - I browned the roast on the stove before adding to the crock pot, and added 1/2c red wine w/2 T Worcestershire to the water.

So simple and so delicious!   I made this according to the directions.  I used a mushroom gravy mix and omitted the salt and pepper directly on the roast.  Also, parboiled some small red potatoes and added them for the last 20 minutes of cook time on the roast.  Mine only took 7 hours.

I followed exactly as recipe said and got a very salty gravy and carrots.  On top of that the chuck roast was really chewy. I can't fault the slow cooker as it has been perfect every time in the past. (Allclad).  After eating what we could, the rest went in to trash.

I do not like the way your stars work, really hard to judge what you mean.  I didn't like the smell of the the gravy and the meat was really tough.

Wow!  Better than Grandma's!  I made this last night and can't wait for the leftovers. I used homemade ranch and Italian salad mixes and a package of beef gravy mix. My husband as skeptical, but I like to try anything. I followed the recipe but added garlic to the liquid mix and used a can of Cola instead of water. My family has always made pot roast with cola. It cooked on low for 10 hours. I didn't add the potatoes or carrots to the crock pot because I don't like everything tasting the same, so they were cooked separately. The gravy that was made with the drippings was amazing. We had it over the mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding. This is now a family treasured way to make pot roast. Thanks!

I am in love! 2.5 lbs of roast is $15 in my area, and the seasonings/veggies came out under $5. It took me about 15 minutes to cut and clean the veggies and season the meat. A $20 meal with 15 minutes of prep work is a massive score for a broke college student with no cooking experience. I think next time I will add the potatoes some commenters suggested and maybe a little Worcestershire sauce to add some more kick. Thanks for the amazing recipe!

This is my second time making this! We made it for Christmas dinner (something different). We typically make a ham but this roast has become a tradition now! My husbands been begging so I decided to make it tonight! Just like last time, absolutely amazing! It's so tender and delish! We add baby potatoes as well as the carrots too. It's the best pot roast I've ever had! We're a pretty basic family, my husband and daughter are pretty picky. If you're looking for a good recipe and don't know whether the flavors will mix, trust me, everyone will love it!

I made this yesterday and it was fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used about a cup of water with the dry mixes. My roast was bigger, about 4 lbs. After the meat was done, I took it out, sliced and trimmed it, and put it back in the crock. Next time I'll add a few little potatoes. Leftovers are gonna be good tonight! Love this one.

I skipped the flour and added potatoes.  Used a mushroom gravy packet instead of the beef (as it was all I had on hand) - Also added 1/2 cup more water  - The hardest part was waiting for it to be done -  I made it Saturday and it was gone on Sunday - My family tore it up.  Thank you for sharing such an easy and delicious recipe

Family liked it. Very easy to prepare. I used a 3 pound roast. Increased water to 1 cup. Added small yellow potatoes with the carrots. Cooked in 8 1/2 hours. I will make it again.

Simple, easy, and yummy. I added mushrooms at the last 2 hours and thickened up the gravy with cornstarch in the last 1/2 hour. I added more water than was called for because I was afraid it would be too salty. 
The meat was fork tender, and the carrots still had a slight give to them and weren't mushy at all.
This is definitely a keeper recipe.

Who would have thought! When I saw the three dry ingredients I was interested enough to buy the meat. 
The paste that you put on the roast is thick. I put in small red potatoes with the carrots. Putting the onions on the bottom was new and seemed to work. 
It is a really thick gravy when done. I put in some beef broth to give me more juice vs. gravy. 
All in all, this is now my favorite slow cook roast recipe. 
Thank you for posting it.

I made this for a big Sunday dinner crowd so I had to double the recipe. The gravy needed a little thickening before serving but everyone raved about it. I have no leftovers!!

Made it for my peeps at work on the night shift on my birthday so we'd have something to eat with the birthday cake.  Everybody loved it. I used garlic and I used beef broth instead of water. I also cut up some red potatoes (skin on ) and added celery.  I brought in a big  CROCK POT full and left two servings at home. My wife loved it, I loved it and everybody at work loved it.  They ate every bit.

This was fantastic, my wife called it the best roast she's ever had! As a lot of other reviewers suggested I upped the water to 1 cup and I still want more gravy so I'll up to a 1 1/2 cups next time. If using a frozen roast like I did 2lb roast was 6 hours on high.

This was very good but I found it a bit peppery. I will probably not season the meat with pepper next time because the dry mixes add so much flavor.  Will make it again for sure.

This has quickly become one of the more requested recipes I have made! I pretty much make it as it says, except instead of salt and pepper, I use a Spicy Montreal rub on the pot roast. This gives it just a bit of kick. I also use an Au Jus packet instead of Beef Gravy packet (mostly because the first time I made it, that was the closest my store had). It is fabulous!

If you want to add potatoes (and I've done this at different levels), it seems like you get about 4 cups of root vegetables total in the sauce, so mix your preferred level of carrots/potatoes or whatever within that ball park. My favorite so far has been to quarter some smallish red potatoes and have about two cups of those with two cups of cut carrots. 

And as for the onion, I've tried it with different types. Favorite so far has been a white onion, but yellow ran a close second. 

It is a great recipe as is and easy to customize. Love this one!

Delicious. I dissolved the packets in 1 cup water. I added 1/2 cup red wine and Worcestershire sauce. I also omitted the salt rub but did use the pepper. Added potatoes. Very happy the way it turned out.

I made this exactly by the recipe, which I don't usually do, and it was fabulous!  My kids loved it and my son's girlfriend even said it was the best roast she's ever had.  Thanks for this recipe.  It's definitely a keeper.

SUUUPER easy to make. I also didn't salt or pepper before putting it in for fear of what a couple of people said about the salt content. I also did a bag of baby carrots and fingerling potatoes. The carrots were great, but when I do it again, i may cut the larger potatoes in half. Great for a cooking beginner!

I started to make this and was hesitant when I caught a whiff of the gravy and two dressing seasoning mixes together. But I forged ahead.  Instead of water for the mixes, I used beef stock. About 5 hours into the cooking, my wife called and was bringing company home. I never try out new recipes on company. I was more than willing to go out for dinner, but once they arrived they both agreed it smelled wonderful and wanted to try it. It was a huge hit with all four of us. Emailed the recipe to my daughter in college for her to try, and she absolutely loved it. I have a 8 quart crockpot so I added 3 lbs of small/medium whole red potatoes and some celery (chopped about 3 inches long). We'll be making this again.

I am just telling you, make this. Don't adjust anything and you will NOT be disappointed.  I usually don't like leftovers and was so disappointed when all of this was gone.  The leftovers are just as good.  BEST RECIPE EVER!!!! Did a side of Bob Evans mashed potatoes and doesn't get any better.

Loved this recipe.  I didn't use the flour on the meat, and I used the roast beef gravy packet as that was all I could find.  And I added potatoes and covered with beef broth.  It turned out so good!  Thanks for the recipe!

Added red new potatoes (whole). Absolutely most flavorful roast  we've tasted in a good long while. Spare seasoning with any additional salt as the three dry packets of seasoning per the recipe will provide plenty of sodium.

My husband and I loved it. Rich flavor and easy to make. I did swap the water for beef broth and browned the outside on a frying pan before putting it in the crock pot. I also added baby carrots and baby potatoes. Everything came out perfect.

Love this easy recipe. Followed suggestion of reviewer who substituted red wine and beef broth in place of chicken broth. And I agree, it's important to sear meat until it almost looks burned for deep flavor. Good winter meal!

Very good recipe. I can't do a recipe without making some changes. I added Worcester powder to the dressing mixture. Used Mrs Dash & Old Bay for the rub. No salt. I browned the roast before I put it in the slow cooker. I added potatoes & peas late. This is now my go to pot roast dish.

Pretty good, the flavor was a little tangy but it went together really easy. I just wish it added potatoes to the batch (I just roasted some in the oven to go with this).  Other than that it was really quick and easy!

This is a quick easy recipe. I cooked it for 7 hours and basted the beef periodically. I added carrots, celery and potatoes. Veggies were softer than I like but it could have been a result of the basting. Next time, I'll add veggies in toward the end of cooking. Hubby loved it and it was very tasty and tender. I prefer to use natural ingredients and thought it was a little salty for my taste. Super, quick and easy recipe though!  Looking forward to trying a new crockpot pot roast recipe from Allrecipes.com.

A b s o l u t e l y the best flavor ever!! As we had 6 people for dinner I bought a 4lb roast and doubled the ingredients.    This was a hit by everyone. I did add baby red potatoes though and because I used a 4lb roast and only had 8 hours to have it ready, I put on high for 4 hours and low for 4 hours and that's when I added both the potatoes and carrots.    This is a keeper recipe!!!

8 hours for a 2 1/2 lb roast?  Seriously? I did mine on low for 4 hours and it was as tough as shoe leather and so overdone.  We couldn't eat it.  Fortunately I made potatoes, carrots and gravy so hubby & I were able to eat something for dinner but the pot roast got tossed.  Will not be repeating.

This really turned out very well. I've long been searching for a good pot roast recipe. I had powdered gravy mix but used italian and ranch dressings as I didn't have the powdered, and added some worchestire and garlic. Really nice flavor.

This was easy to make and delicious. The kids loved it. I added a bag of baby carrots and bought Bob Evans Garlic Mashed potatoes. The teenagers could put the plates together on their own and I could go to the gym!!

This roast was amazing.  Very tender and juicy.  The only change I made was adding a couple of cans of new potatoes.  Our normally picky 17 year old raved about this dish.  Thanks

I have never been a big fan of pot roasts or slow cookers but I LOVE this recipe.  Don't be worried by not having much sauce in the pot when you turn it on.  It makes a sauce to die for!  The meat is so tender and yummy my whole family gobbled it up in a half hour! Thank you for this fabulous recipe! This is definitely a keeper!

After my husband tried it he stated, "Now this is what beef stew is supposed to taste like!" This will be made often in our home. Only differences were I used beef cubes (because that's what I had) and added potatoes. Amazing recipe!!

I used a Knorr vegetable soup and a little Italian seasoning as I didn't have the Italian dressing package, added a little red wine as well. Amazing flavour, tender and just devine.... hardly any left-overs! This one is a keeper!

I made this as specified only substituting the ingredients to "gluten free" items where needed and found it to be very tasteful. wish I had added potatoes to it but will do next time. very good and will make again.

I loved this recipe! It was fairly easy and tasted great! 
Here are the modifications I did: 
- I added celery and potatoes because I felt the recipe didn't have enough ingredients 
- I did it on high in the crock pot for 5-6 hours instead of low and turned out fine. 

Saving this for the future for sure.

This was a great recipe! Quick easy and most of all very tasty. I too was worried about the saltiness of it but it was just right . I didn't have the powdered Italian dressing that the recipe called for so I used about 1/3 cup of real Italian dressing I had and added potatoes and celery . It turned out perfect for a wintry cold night ??

Really great recipe. My slow cooker seems to go faster than most recipes call for, so just checked it often. 2nd time with this recipe so I made some egg noodles and a side of brown gravy and made a stroganoff type of dish with it. Love this recipe

I added 2 cups of water total and let it cook.
It came tender and seasoned but it was just OK.  My husband liked it. Used baby carrots instead of whole.

This is by far the best pot roast I've ever made and God knows I've made several different versions!  I do use about 3/4 cup of water instead of just half and as One reviewer said it was too salty, well if you find that to be the case then just mix some extra water with a little flour and then pour it in so that it still stays thick and eases the saltiness but honestly I find this perfect!

Loved it,  by far my favorite slow cooker pot roast. I did omit the salt because I thought with all the seasonings there was plenty already. It did make a lot of gravy which I was happy about. My family ate it all which hardly happens. Definitely making this again.  I added some red potatoes to it and will probably add celery next time for more color.

Best recipe ever.  Didn't use any salt to season the beef.  And used 3/4 cup of red wine + 1/4 cup water for liquid.   And used carrots and purple turnips.  So yummy!

The gravy was AWESOME.  When we ate a bite to check for doneness, it was so yummy we almost ate the whole little roast standing right over the crockpot.  This is a keeper.  I'm going to make a second roast today to add to all the great gravy!

Used a shoulder roast.  Added mushrooms and celery to the pot along with the onions and carrots.  I did brown the roast for a few minutes on each side in the electric skillet before putting it in the crockpot.

I usually make Paula Deene's Old Time Beef Stew, but not anymore.  This is the new go to pot roast recipe.

One of the best pot roasts I've ever made.   I didn't have the gravy mix, so just used the ranch and Italian dressing mixes.  Sounded crazy but the reviews were right.  This is a favorite!

The reviews were right! This was really easy and really good!

I did make a few changes out of necessity. For instance, my crock pot is small, so I about halved the meat. I layered halved pearl onions in the bottom of the cooker, and put halved red potatoes and baby carrots on top. I couldn't find just normal beef gravy mix, so I used mushroom gravy instead. Also, instead of water, I used a mixture of beef broth and red wine. And I think I generally used more liquid than the recipe called for. Also, I cooked it on low for more like 10 hours, because I had to stay late at work that day.

So there's that.

But hey, it turned out really well! I was worried about it being really salty, but it wasn't. If you're sensitive to salty tastes, I think it would be a bit strong, but I think the added liquid and potatoes helped.

And talk about easy to assemble! I actually woke up late that morning and wasn't sure I would have time to prep it before leaving for work, but the whole thing took like fifteen minutes. Piece of cake! Exactly what I want out of my crock pot recipes.

I'll definitely make this again. Maybe next time I'll try it with stew meat instead of chuck roast.

Wow, the flavors were just so good, after some minor changes. 
 I have to agree, with some who posted, that the gravy was a little too salty, so the last ½ hour, I added some mash potato flakes mixed  with warm water, & after I made that change, and let it cook for another 15 minutes, it was amazing.                                                                                                         I did not use any salt, when putting this all together and whops, I forgot the sliced onion, but it was sooooooooo  good, I will NOT make pot roast with onion soup mix again, this was so much better.
I will be keeping my eye open for low salt mixes, for next time. Not sure if bottle salad dressing would work the same, anyone used bottle ranch or Italian???

This was delicious!! I had never made pot roast and wanted an easy version for the first time. I am a make from scratch kind of girl, so was skeptical about all the packets, but given my extreme time constraint, went for it. Like some others I worried about salt so I didn't salt the meat and used low sodium gravy. It turned out perfect! My gravy loving son used half a baguette to get as much as possible and my non-gravy son actually asked for some. I served with egg noodles and also put potatoes in for the leftovers. YUM! Will soooo make this again.

The gravy was flavorful and tender.  It was pretty easy to prep! I added diced celery and cubed white potatoes as a covering overtop of the roast.  I also added about another 1/2 cup of water to keep it from being too dry.  It was a perfect fall meal!

Let me first preface this by saying I usually despise roast and so does my husband! All these years people have been doing it wrong.  This was super easy to put together and I turned mine on before bed and off before work, let it cool and called my hubby to put in fridge. I did it this way to allow the juices to settle for dinner making it even more flavorful. I packed some for lunch and threw some mashed together to bed the meat&carrots on. I sat for lunch nervous, took a bite and was blown away with the tenderness and how flavorful it was!  I now am a roast lover and am so happy I got the Bogo on roasts at Kroger this week! I used low sodium gravy mix (cause that's what the hubby brought back), I didn't salt the meat at all & used 3/4 cups of water. I did all this to avoid the saltiness that some people sighted. I also couldn't find a roast smaller than 3 lbs. I'm not sure if this impacted the outcome of flavors though. Perfecto!

I used a 5 lb. Chuck roast, so I doubled the sauce, and added 1/2 cup of red wine.   We felt that more carrots and onions and fewer potatoes would have been better for our family.  By doubling, I will have enough for two nights. (4 adults)

Everyone said this was excellent!  It is saltier than we are used to, but no complaints.  It does enhance the flavor of the sauce.  I did not have the salt shaker on the table, just pepper.

I will make this again.

Made it last night & absolutely loved it!!! I added 1/4 cup of white cooking wine for more liquid and had some potatoes on hand so I cubed them up & put them right on top of roast.  Came out amazing, will definitely make again.

I've made pot roast before and I thought my recipe was good. I tried this because I was interested in how these packs of soup would taste together.....OMG!!!! This was the best pot roast I've ever had! My nephew, who will NOT eat beef, devoured it. My picky teenager had two helpings (she would have eaten the whole roast if we'd let her). The only thing I did differently was to add a little Worcestershire sauce. Easy, excellent meal!! Will become one of my go to meal staples.

I made this last week, but had to substitute some things because I didn't want to clean up to go to the store. Hey, I'm retired now! 
No onions in the house, so I chunked some potatoes to put in the bottom. No Ranch dressing mix, so I used Vegenaise Ranch dressing - just poured in about a half a cup. No Italian dressing, so I used Italian spices. And I only had a turkey gravy packet, so I used that. 

My husband was STOKED! We even ate the leftovers! He bought two more roasts this weekend with a request to make another roast. This time I'm using the actual recipe - I'll let you know how that one turns out, but man, oh man, was that ever some great meat!

Absolutely delicious even my husband loved it. I've made pot roast before and it always came out lousy but This will be my go to recipe from now on. I also added dry mushrooms in the beginning so they cooked with the roast. It wasn't too salty at all

I love this simple recipe and like most folks, I tweak it just a little.  I use two prepackaged brown gravy mixes as I have found the envelopes in the store now are about .8 oz instead of the 1.2 oz. the recipe calls for.   I increase the amount of water to at least 1 cup.  I add plenty of cut potatoes and baby carrots as well as fresh garlic.   I usually marinate the meat overnight too.  The real trick thought is to sear the meat after its flour bath on all sides in a skillet with a small amount of oil.

Loved this!!! I substituted another dry gravy mix since I did not have brown gravy mix. The sauce that was created was on point! I'll probably try to make more sauce the next time. Will try adding some green beans or peas to make it a one dish meal. Easy to prepare.....easy clean-up.

I changed it up by adding 10 of beef bullion as the fluid to mix the ranch and salad dressing dry mixes, but it made a lot of gravy and it was seasoned nicely.  I also did the standard of carrots, celery, potatoes which were a nice addition.  You can serve this on noodles, rice or mashed potatoes.

Loved this! Probably the best pot roast I've had ever! I was skeptical about the mixes, thinking they might lend a bitterness to the roast from the ranch dressing(not my fave) but the flavors meld together beautifully. Didn't salt the roast and poured the mix over the roast with the water around the edges. Moist, tender and delicious! Will use this as my go-to pot roast for now....til someone comes along with a better mouse trap! We had this with buttered egg noodles. Great as left overs since the flavors marry with time in the fridge. FYI- don't add too much water to the crock pot as the roast and the crock pot itself create enough moisture. The caramelized onions are the bomb! All in all, a fantastic recipe!

Loved it! The only change that I made was to double the water. I was hoping to reduce the saltiness through saturation. It was so easy to make, the gravy came out thickened, and not too salty! It was a winner in my house and I'll definitely make it again. It was easy to start this morning and awesome to come home to a nice dinner. Thanks for this recipe!

I made this recipe with an eye of round roast and it worked out great.  Very moist and delicious.  I didn't have gravy mix or Italian dressing on hand so I used a packet of onion soup mix and the dry ranch dressing.  Very tasty.  I will definitely make this again.

This is by far the best pot roast recipe I've ever made!  I increased the water a bit because of comments from others, and it turned out delicious! Deep, rich flavor.  I'm keeping it and will make forever.

Very easy to make.  Very good meal.  My family loved it.   I added 1/4 cup of wine for flavor.  The meat was perfectly cooked and not dry at all.  The brown gravy was delicious and gave the roast a great seasoned flavor.   It was even better as a leftover.   If you need something easy to make in the crock pot consider this recipe.

Pretty good! Hubby loved it & he normally can't stand pot roast! He even ate it the next day leftover instead of getting take out--also unheard of!!

This was delicious. Made it twice and adjusted a few things for the 2nd time.   Seer the meat prior to tossing in the slow cooker, the caramelization really adds flavor.  I threw in some celery as well as potato and it helped balance out the fattiness of the gravy.  Am making it again tonight!

Perfection! The only thing I changed was that I used baby carrots and added them in with 3 hours remaining so that they didn't get overdone.

One of the best stews I have had.  I added 1/2 cup of burgundy wine and 1/2 cup water. Cooked it on low for 10 hours.  I did not mix the mixes with the liquids first. I sprinkled the mix on the meat then poured the liquids over that.  It turned out just fine. I also added quartered potatoes.

I've made this several times.... Added potatoes... & one HUGE CHANGE....
A LOT more water!!! I fill the Crockpot almost to the top.. About 5 cups..
It's AWESOME!! Yes, it does end up more like a Broth than a Gravy... But, the Extreme saltiness goes away.
I could put a straw in the Crockpot!!!

This is the BEST and easiest recipe. I didn't have an onion to use, so I put in a can of French onion soup. I also added about 2 cups diced petite red potatoes. When tenderizing the meat, I sprinkled with the salt, pepper & flour, then wrapped in Saran Wrap a few times and covered with a dish rag and used a hammer to tenderize.

My family loved this! It wasn't too salty for our taste, but I can see how some wouldn't like it. I added in a half cup of beef broth, a beef bouillon cube, and I stuffed a couple of cloves of garlic in the roast. I also added potatoes. Best. Roast. Ever

My kids are asking for me to make this again, SOON! The flavor is wonderful and the meat just fell apart. I did not have beef gravy so I used 2 cans of beef broth and the 'gravy' was perfect, ideal for dipping a nice crusty bread.

This is the first time I've made pot roast and I am thrilled with how it turned out!  It was definitely salty, I will not salt the meat next time and I will look for low sodium gravy, you can always add salt at the end. I also plan to add more veggies but the overall flavor was delicious, I can't wait to try again!

This is a great, easy recipe.  Very quick to assemble. The taste was awesome.  The meat was tender.  The vegetables were tender too, yet not mushy.  I added potatoes too and that made a one-pot meal. I also cooked it on high for 4 hours instead of on low. Yummy!

Having recently been turned on to the fabulousness of "Mississippi Roast," I was curious to try another roast recipe using weird combos of dry mix as ingredients. We loved this! The gravy was great, and the meat & carrots were tender with excellent flavor. I will certainly make this again, throwing in more vegg next time. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was so easy to make and my husband said it was the best pot roast he's ever eaten. I omitted the salt and pepper and added potatoes and carrots on top of the roast. I put this in the crockpot before work and just left it on low until I got home. It turned out perfect!

After reading some other reviews, I left out the salt (and used pearl onions instead of slicing an onion), and this came out perfectly. The meat was flavorful, and so tender it fell apart as I was removing it from the pot. I would make this again in an instant.

While the beef itself was pretty good, we did not care for the gravy (over mashed potatoes).  It had a different taste.  Am assuming it wasn't from the Durkee brown gravy mix.   I won't make this again.

This was easy but just OK.  I browned the roast  before I put it in the crock pot.  I did not salt the roast and one of the dry mixes was low  sodium, but when it was about done , I tasted it and it was pretty salty. I added in potatoes. That helped make it taste less salty. My husband enjoyed it quite a bit, but I likely won't make it again.

Best Pot Roast EVER!! The flavors were amazing. I like my gravy a little thinner so I added about half a cup of low sodium beef broth to the bottom of the pot. I put the onions under the meat and then the potatoes and carrots on top. I only cooked for 7 hours and it was perfect. At the 5 hour mark when there was enough liquid to cover the veggies I stirred the veggies on top so the carrots could cook. They weren't really cooking up until this point since they were sitting on top. I also added a fresh sprig of Rosemary and Thyme on top of the meat while it was cooking. Delicious!!!

I am not a "happy" cook. I do it because I must. I loved this roast and, more important, my guests loved it. Simple and great for a group. Was not certain about all the dry mixes but made great gravy. I did need to thicken gravy a bit before serving. Added a few new potatoes with the carrots.

Really good and really easy!! I added a few cut up potatoes and added mushrooms near the end. I also did not use salt on meat as I feel there’s enough in the dressings and prefer lower sodium. Will do again.

Very easy and good taste.  Followed as is.  Next time I might add a tad more water and lots more fresh mushrooms.  Served gravy over rice one night and the second night baked potatoes.

I added 8 oz. sliced mushrooms.
I added four or five halved peeled potatoes.
I added 1/4 c. red wine
I increased water to 1 and 3/4c.
I didn't add additional salt

So excellent for dinner.  So excellent  for sandwiches.
Great flavor!!!

This is the easiest and most delicious pot roast recipe! The water amount is truly a suggestion. It depends on how much gravy/sauce you want, and how thick you want it to be. I use two packages of (low-sodium) brown gravy mix with the dry dressing, and then just add water until it's the consistency that I want. Also, I use a bag of frozen mixed vegetables instead of the carrots. I serve it all over whipped potatoes, and it is amazing! Definitely recommend!

Like a lot of reviewers, I was unsure about the packet mixes but I'm glad I made this. It was my first time making a pot roast and it was delicious! I used a cup of water and I added a few cubed red potatoes, I think that helped cut out some of the saltiness other reviewers mentioned. This will definitely be a recipe I use again when I want an easy, warm dinner on a cold night.

My family loved it! I used a little less Italian to cut down on the salt. I also added marinated button mushrooms which was a wonderful addition to the depth of flavor. I did eight hours on low and it was so tender and delicious!

Salty.  Should've used the cream of mushroom with onion soup base recipe again instead.

Might be good for some, but not for me.

This is one of my favorite recipes and I have made this meal several times already.  So easy to make yet  so flavorful!  I don't add extra salt because the packaged stuff already has that (unless these have LOW SODIUM or NO SALT at all) .  Adding potatoes do cut down on the saltiness and, perhaps, depending on the amount of meat used, one could also add half a cup of water.  I typically add potatoes, chopped celery and carrots.  The family loves this meal! :) Thanks for sharing!

I understand why this recipe has so many 5-star ratings.  It's wonderful!  And easy too! 
I browned the meat first, left off the flour and salt ( knowing there was plenty of salt in the packets.)
You're going to think that a half-cup of water isn't enough, but it is.
Great recipe!

Orgasmic!!

lol!

If I could give this more stars I would. Everyone has their own adjustments they have to make as expected. I didn't make many... just dropped the flour, salt and pepper, and onion and added celery and potatoes, and I needed more water as expected. I've made this many times, and its by far my favorite dish ever! And I am a rather picky eater. ;-) NOM NOM NOM!!

I loved this.  My boyfriend loved this.  It was ridiculously easy.  I had a 2lb beef roast, and I didn't have an Italian dressing packet.  Only other change was to add more water and about a tablespoon of red wine vinegar.

Phenomenal! Going to be a new monthly staple in my arsenal. Some pot roast recipes just lack flavor and sadly STINK by adding too many things that don't balance! This one DOES NOT disappoint! Great job and thank you for the recipe! This really is a nice recipe. I enjoyed watching it come together over the hours and never would have thought about the ranch and Italian packet seasoning. Smart additions I gotta say... 

As I always do I added a little something but the recipe itself is FANTASTIC and doesn't need to be altered unless you like to mess with perfection; (which I always do for some reason.) I added 3 small russet potatoes, 8oz of dark lager beer and a 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to kick it up a bit about 6hrs in; but like I said... ONLY TO MY LIKING. This recipe is GREAT and I'm ONLY sharing my personal additions to open up the possibilities. 

Thanks again for sharing. BEYOND happy with the finished product.

Awesome recipe!  I added one large potato sliced, as well as two colored bell peppers.  At the 3/4 cooking mark, I added two cups of wide egg noodles.  Once the meat was cooked to 170 degrees, I removed the meat from the slow cooker and chopped into bite size pieces.  Once completed, I returned the meat to the crock pot.  I then added a can of cream of chicken soup and a half a can water.  Seasoned with salt, pepper and hot pepper flakes.  Put the SC on low for 20 minutes and you have an awesome dish of comfort food!

I made this in a Nesco instead of a crock pot and it was a 5# roast so I doubled everything except for the Italian dressing mix because I thought it would be to salty, I also browned the roast before putting it in, and it turned out amazing.  Best roast I've ever made.

Perfect beginner recipe! Easy to make with lots of flavor. The only thing I've changed over the multiple times I've made this, is I use about 1/3 of a ranch packet instead of a full one. My boyfriend and I prefer mostly the Italian mix with a hint of ranch. I've also made this with pork roast and it's amazing!

It was just delicious but like one other person I found it incredibly salty, but not bad enough that I couldn't eat it. The next time I make it I definitely will not salt and pepper it and will cut the ranch dressing back a bit. Other than that it was melt in your mouth incredible.

Wow! Followed the instructions to a T and this was hands down the best slow cooker pot roast ever! I thickened the juices on the stove top, and let me tell you the flavor was incredible, I served with nice fluffy mashed potatoes to put the gravy on.

Added a little extra onion and lightly browned the meat before flouring.   (Should've done it the other way around duh).  Other than that pretty exact as the recipe and it was so good.   Made it for Christmas and my family raved about it.   My mom wanted the recipe.   That's saying something. Not too salty as made although I didn't go overboard on salting the meat itself.   It was perfect with the mix packets.   Gravy didn't really thicken but it was the tastiest dang pot roast I've ever had.   Only one serving left from four people!   They liked it. Oh,  and mom doesn't even like ranch mixes.   Yummo.

This was so delicious and so incredibly easy. I made it for my boyfriend and it beat out his mother's roast (a win for me!) I would only add more veggies. Other than that it was scrumptious!!

Very good!  I had a larger cut of meat 4lbs) so I doubled the recipe and it turned out great!  Also added some potatoes.  Will definitely make again.

I have to admit - I was skeptical that this would turn out salty with all the flavor packs.  I was wrong!  Added mushrooms and it was awesome.

I love this recipe as is, but I've modified it over the years out of laziness.  I dump all the mixes (herbed gravy mix for beef) in the bottom, add the water, and mix with a whisk.  Then I throw in the onions and place the roast on top of it (without any of the flour or seasonings).  To add even more lazy to the pot, I throw in a bag of baby carrots and pepper the whole thing.  Lid on.  The end.

Simple to make, potential to be tasty but salty to the poinit of being almost distracting.  Issue is with the three packets of gravy, Italian dressing and Ranch dressing.  OVer 900 mg of sodium in less than three ounces of mix!  Find a way to substitute those ingredients and this could be a great meal...  perhaps a little canned gravy and bottled dressing would improve it.    OK, maybe it deserves three stars.

I made some changes. I marinated my roast overnight and drizzled olive oil, garlic powder, and a package of Lipton onion soup mix along with (1) tbsp. of salt and pepper all over the roast. I cut up (2) large baking potatoes in chunks and (2) stalks of celery and carrots (1) small onion and bell pepper diced. I sprinkled (2) tbsps. of flour and (1 1/2  cups of water) to make its own gravy in the juices and cook on low 8-9 hrs. It will be flavourful, tender, and moist and will brown itself. No need to brown in skillet.

I used an addition envelope of Mcorrmick pot roast seasoning.  So 4 envelopes mixed together with 1 can beef broth and 3 cloves of garlic. This is THE best pot roast I have ever tasted.

I was super skeptical of this recipe, but after reading everyone's review I knew I just had to try it. I used the Herb Gravy mix for Beef, and Ranch dressing packet only. I had also added just another cup of water. Last but not least, cubed up some red potatoes and some celery! Amazing recipe! It had smelled so good within 30 minutes of it being in the crockpot! Definitely plan on keeping this recipe! Thank you :)

This was a very tasty pot roast, one of the best I've made.  Husband LOVED it!  I added a few red potatoes cut in half but other than that made the recipe as is.  Thanks for the recipe and will make again!

This was delicious!  I added about a cup of water to this recipe.  It is pretty salty. I suggest putting this over rice or noodles.  Bread and butter go great with this recipe too.

Excellent recipe. Everyone loved it. This is my new crock pot roast recipe from now on.             I did not add the extra pinch of salt and my roast was closer to 3 lbs. Perfect flavor and not overly salty as others have stated.

This is my newest favorite pot roast recipe!!! So easy and soooo much flavor! It was perfect. I served it with bisquik biscuits and a salad. Family loved it! Depending on how you like your roast- this one didn't have very much liquid juice or gravy. Next time I may try to add more water or another gravy packet to try to get more liquid to try and serve with potatoes. I also added celery. Must try!

By far this recipe is amazing! I'm not a cook by any means and this was the easiest and most flavorful dish I could have ever imagined making.  I followed the recipe exactly, however, I did had some potatoes and mushrooms as well. Also I added a bit more water. Other than that I set my crock pot as directed and let the rich aroma fill my house as my mouth watered anticipating the deliciousness that was brewing.

Here is the Pot Roast Recipe i made for Mom's bday I had quadrupled the recipe though..and  added about a 1/4 c worcestershire to taste, along with a can of tomato paste. I seared the meat, then floured it on both sides and put all meat on top of veggies in my roaster. It cooked overnight at 250, then in the morning, I pulled the meat apart and I turned it up to 350, to get it bubbly to thicken some more.  I did add an 8 ounce package of Bella mushrooms. I wanted to add more, but wasnt sure everyone liked them, so didn't say they were in there.  (hehhehe)  I used the Herb Beef Gravy mix, which was the only one i could find at Giant Eagle .

My mother used to make pot roast and I always loved it. She recently passed and I did not have her recipe for it, so I started searching on allrecipes when I came across this one. I am so glad I did.... It was WONDERFUL.  All five of us (3 picky kid-eaters) and 2 adults ate it all up!  I did not add flour, just seasoned meat with salt, pepper, garlic powder.
WONDERFUL!

I have made a lot of roasts different ways, but this came out, by far, the best one I have ever done.   So simple and so delicious. I followed the directions exactly. I do not salt anything and I was worried about the saltiness but it was perfect.

Oh my gosh, this pot roast is sooo good!  Like other reviewers I was skeptical adding the packets of dry dressing and gravy (I used mushroom).  I thought the final product would be dry; however, the roast was perfectly seasoned and juicy.  Next time I plan to add potatoes.

This was amazing, so tender and melt in your mouth! After reading the reviews, I left out the salt altogether.  I did not have beef gravy seasoning so I used McCormick brown gravy mix, used baby carrots, and added cubed red potatoes.  Even my picky man loved it!  The gravy is a little runnier than we like, so I will thicken it up with cornstarch about 1 hour before serving next time.  Will absolutely make this again!

It was DELICIOUS! Few change ups... Browned the whole roast in oil after dredging it in flour, garlic powder, onion powder and paprika. Cooked it on low for 9-10 hours (meat was amazing and tender). Made it more of a gravy and added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch. Added mushrooms and red potatoes with 3 hours left to cook. Seved it over rigatoni. My husband loved it!!

My husband wanted to bring pot roast for his coworkers so we found this recipe and made it exactly as written except that we added celery, quartered red potatoes, and baby carrots. (I think the pot roast may have been bigger than 2lbs but we still used this recipe as written.) All the ingredients filled the crockpot to the top. Super quick and easy. Husband left me some and took the rest to work. He called me to RAVE about this pot roast and ask what was in it (he was actually helping with the assembly but I guess he wasn't paying that much attention - until after he ate it). I saw some reviews saying it was too salty - but mine wasn't at all. Maybe it's because I added potatoes. We also accidentally put the salt & pepper on after rolling it in the flower...but I don't think that would make too much of a difference. I don't usually make pot roast but I have a feeling I will be now... Glad I have this simple, easy recipe!

Slow cooker pot roast recipes have a special place in my heart as they make for impressive looking dishes with a minimum amount of effort! Like others, I wasn't sure what to make of so many dry mixes but our roast ended up being far more flavorful than any other recipe we've tried up to now. The only substitution I made was using onion powder instead of an actual onion (my wife doesn't like the texture of onions) with no adverse effects. Definitely a winner!

This is absolutely fabulous!  I've made and it was better the second time I made it!  I used an English roast since they were on sale both times. I put an entire bag of baby carrots in. I leave for work at 6:30 in the morning. I set it on low and let it go until we eat around 5:30 or 6:00. I make homemade mashed potatoes Each time and it's the perfect meal!  I'm not a leftover person, but we eat this meal until it's gone!!!  Thank you for posting such a fabulous recipe!!!

I thought that this was pretty tasty, but my husband didn't like it much. I think the problem is that you don't really taste beef roast. You taste lots of other yummy things, but we really like the flavor of good beef.

Followed the recipe exactly ... except that I didn't have time time to cook on low so I had to cook on high ... and I didn't add salt/pepper to roast before coating in flour. My roast was 3.5 lbs, I added an entire package of celery and used a 1 lb bag of baby carrots around roast. Salt and pepper to taste to the finished product. Delicious.

Amazing! Similar consistency to a stroganoff. Followed exactly, except did not add salt. The meat gets plenty of salt with the seasoning. Tastes great with Jasmine rice. Made the meal for tomorrow, hopefully I will have some left by then.

I didn't have my crock pot handy and made this dish for Sunday supper on July 19, 2015.  I mixed all the ingredients together and added a bit of cayanne pepper and italian seasoning, followed the directions and cooked in the oven, covered, for approximately four hours.  OH MY GOODNESS, this dish was fantastic.  This will be my go to recipe moving forward.

Used a very inexpensive eye of the round roast. Added a can of rotel and potatoes.  Cooked it on low for 6 hours then turned it down to warm. Added yellow beans and mushrooms. Pretty well cleaned the fridge out of old vegetables.

My boyfriend said it was better than is mother's and grand mother's recipes. I was also concerned about the dry mix combo but had an Excellent taste.
I did add potatoes, 2 cans of beef broth in place of water and I didn't have the dry ranch seasoning and it still came out moist and very flavorful. Gravy from dripping was just as good. Look forward to using the complete recipe.

My family loved it! Even My 8, 7 and 5 year old! I didn't have 8 hours to cook but 6 hours on my 2nd high (6 hour) heating setting worked out. It sat on off in crockpot for an  extra hour  and it was perfect and so tender. I added as another reviewer mentioned some red wine but did not substitute it for the water.  Used the water and just added some wine in the end.  I liked the consistency and flavor. Thank you for this delicious and easy recipe.

A bit too salty... I had too dilute and season dish.  But the meat had a shredded consistency.  Next time I'll pound the roast in only one direction.  My family didn't care. Placed on top of rice, it only lasted  for dinner and Hubbie's late night snack.  Definitely will repeat with alterations.  Like use only half Italian seasoning and add green pepper to the onions. Unable to illicit my true opinion... 4.5 stars

Great receipt! I did leave out the step with the flour. Also added cut up potato, as many as can fit in crock pot. Put on before going to bed. Next morning make sure all potato and carrots pieces are under the juice(gravy). Let cook until lunch time.  Usually cook this for Sunday lunch. So easy yet so good! Have made this many times.

Truly easy recipe with a tasty result. We thought it was slightly salty so will try different brands next time. The roast was tender and gravy rich. It truly delivered in easiness and richness!

Like many others, I was very skeptical of the combination of seasoning packets - but the roast turned out very flavorful (and not very salty) and so tender.

This is my go-to recipe now for pot roast.  The whole family loves it.  Hubby and I are eating fairly low-carb, so I leave out the flour.  It's still delicious without it.

I didn't like this as much as my usual "french onion soup mix" pot roast, but it did have some nice points that I probably will steal.  For some reason, this had almost a heavy celery flavor to me.  I'm not sure if it was the ranch dressing mix or the italian dressing mix, but the whole roast/gravy tasted heavily of celery.  This is not my favorite flavor and I usually leave celery out of soups and stews to avoid that overwhelming flavor.  I really liked the consistency of the gravy and I think I will start using the 1/4 c flour rubbed into the meat from now on.  I really liked using the chuck roast. I usually use just whatever is on sale but I think chuck is how I'm going to go chuck from now on with pot roast.  My next roast I will go back to the onion soup mix packet, but thanks for the recipe.  I'm glad so many like it, it just wasn't my favorite.

I just made this.  I stuck to the recipe exactly.  All I did was sautee the onion (slices) then in the same pan, I browned the roast.  Put it all in the slow cooker, then covered the roast with baby carrots and cut up red potatoes.  I was skeptical because of all the reviews saying it was salty -- so I added the potatoes (to make it a complete meal, and to soak up any extra salt I didn't want from the dressing mixes).  

Mine cooked for exactly 8 hours and came out perfect!! I used a 2.6 lb roast and there was nothing left!  My husband ate 3 plates of it and said it was a keeper.  I thought the meat was incredibly tender and the potatoes and carrots flavorfull.  I liked how insanely easy it was.  Will definitely be making this again, but will buy a bigger roast!  ;)

If anyone is worried about it being salty, just throw some potatoes in with everything.  I didn't find it salty in the least.  I don't know why you wouldn't want to make it with potatoes anyway, it's a complete meal that way! :)

I ended up adding almond flour instead of normal flour and added sliced sweet potatoes to the mix and- WOW! This is the best pot roast I've ever had.

Followed recipe as directed, (although I added potatoes) and was a great family meal - all 3 of my boys really ate it up.  Doesn't get much simpler than this!

I was a little apprehensive about this when I read the ingredients, but I'm really glad I tried it. It's easy to fix and delicious. The only change I made was adding a couple peeled and quartered russet potatoes to the cooker about 3 hours before serving.

This is probably the best slow cooker pot roast that I have ever tried. I took it to my boyfriend and his coworkers for lunch and they ate the entire thing and were looking for more! (There were only 3 of them). I added some red potatoes and that was it-kept everything else the same. This has a lot of flavor!

Tried this using beefy onion soup mix, ranch dressing mix, and brown gravy.  The flavor was awesome!!! I will say however that the cooking time was way off for me. My slow cooker may run hot on the low setting, but 2 3/4 lb roast only took about 5 hrs on low and at that point was overdone. 
Will make this again, but will watch the roast a little more closely to avoid over cooking it.

I couldn't find any beef gravy mix, so I just used regular brown gravy mix instead. Also, I used potatoes instead of onions and about a cup of water instead of half a cup. Besides that, I followed the recipe. I had to cook it for almost 7 hours on high to get the meat as tender as I like it, and the flavor of the gravy just doesn't do it for me. Maybe it was the Italian dressing mix, but it just seemed too herby. And it definitely needed more salt.

I also was a little bit skeptical about the three mixes this recipes calls for, but it turned out to be super delicious even my picky son ate two servings of it. 
Definitely this recipe is a keeper in our family recipe book.

I made this pot Roast using 2 chuck roast and after cooking it for 8 hours exactly it turned out very tender and delicious. I  added a few extra to it. I used garlic powder &onion powder to my meat and I browned both sides before i put it in the slow cooker also, I used beef broth instead of water to add to the dry seasonings. I used frozen stewed vegetables and onions.Will be making this again , my family loved it.we ate garlic mash potatoes and green beans with this and was an  absolute hit!!!

This roast is delicious!!! I use low sodium brown gravy , add turnips and potatoes. You can also use better cuts of meat other than chuck for even better results. Very easy to make, has become a family favorite.

Excellent slow cooker for beef meal.  I added potatoes...red, Yukon, Fingerlings will do.  Added white onion and Brown Gravy mix..."Simply Organgic", Lipton Onion Recipe Secrets Mix, and dry Italian-style salad dressing mix.  Can cook faster, higher heater... @4 hrs.  Either slow or fast... Good.

This seemed like such a good idea, and the reviews were great. Unfortunately it was another in a long history of pot roast failures for me: Dry meat, fatty broth, bland veggies. Meh.

Yes.  I've made it several times and it is always great.  I add potatoes with the carrots and a little garlic with the onions and it always turns out great and is a big hit!  Love how quick and easy it is and that you don't have to brown roast first.  10 mins or less to get in slow cooker then house smells great all day.

Perfect exactly as is! I hate when people review with high stars but change the entire recipe. I followed this to a t and made mashed potatoes as a side. It's my new favorite recipe! I was worried there wouldn't be enough liquid but it turned out perfectly. I highly recommend!

Rich & delicious!!  And my eldest son, who believes he makes the best roast, proclaimed it was the best roast he had ever eaten (and he has no problem saying a food isn't up to his standard.)  The gravy is thick and has wonderful flavor.  This is absolutely the go-to recipe for roast, in our family now.  Eldest son just arrived for Christmas Eve, and when asked if he had anything he particularly wanted, this evening, he said "that roast you made!" He agreed that tomorrow would be soon enough, so I'm off to buy a chuck roast.

We loved it! I cooked it over the stove for about 2 hours,but next time I will push it to 2.5 hours. I added potatoes to it. I also think next time I will not sprinkle the salt as the seasonings in my opinion provide enough salt. I added more water about 3/4 cups, since I like a bit of thick soup in anything that is stew like recipe. The potatoes helped to the thickening of the recipe so if you think that much water will be too much think about adding the potatoes. The thickness will be just right. Keeper!

Moist, delicious, and perfect to come home to on a cold day! Uniquely flavorful. I did cube two russet potatoes and sprinkle them with seasoned salt to taste, placed on top of the carrots. Thanks for the excellent recipe! This is going to be a weekly meal at our house!

We've done lots of roasts and usually they turn out on the dry side but are ok. This recipe is our new favourite for doing a roast. It turned out juicy and flavourful. The kids even wanted seconds ! Thanks for this one !

I was dying to try this as the ingredients seemed unusual.  I can't understand the rave reviews.  We were very disappointed.  My kids asked me not to make it again.  I followed recipe exactly.

I had a big dinner party and made 2, one with onion and mushrooms, the other without.  Both were out of this world delicious.  Everyone raved about it.  It was easy and will be made many times in the future, just as the recipe calls for.  This could be my new signature meal! My grown son, who has never eaten a vegetable in his life actually loved the carrots and celery.  The meat really did melt in your mouth.

This was good. I didn't have gravy mix so I used a mix of onion soup mix and a liquid gravy base. Like others, I added about a 1/2 cup red wine to the crock pot and that gave it a touch of sweetness which helped balance the spice.

I tried this recipe and just did not like the combination of flavors. My favorite part of a pot roast is the vegetables and the gravy in this really drowned them out.

I've always loved the Amish Restaurants' Roast Beef, and this Recipe gives you the same wonderful taste and flavors ! I added  potatoes along with the carrots. Serve with French Bread to sop up the tasty 
gravy !
It's DEEELICIOUS !  Kids & hubby asked for seconds !

I have to admit ... I too was skeptical about mixing all those dry mixes but the flavor was amazing!  Served with a side of mashed potatoes and warm biscuits ... comfort food at its finest!  This recipe is a KEEPER!  Can't wait to make it on a cold, snowy day this winter.

Good recipe.  1-pound bag of baby carrots was a great substitute for unnecessarily tinkering with larger carrots.  I would add some Worcestershire or something similar to the gravy too or have horseradish on hand as a condiment.  Very tasty though.

I too was apprehensive of the seasoning mixture, but DO NOT change a thing! I made a little under 2.5 # roast and by the time I got home from work all that was left was one small Rubbermaid container for my husband to take to work. I was able to sneak a bite out of there, and let's just say, I will be making roast NO other way ever again! Easy and flavorful...I am so glad I came about this recipe. I did add potatoes with the carrots and 3/4 c water for slightly thinner gravy.

Yummy! I read the reviews prior about being too salty, so I just bought packages that were low in sodium. Also with each package I only used half. Still has great flavor! Like others I also added potatoes & celery and 1.5 C of water

This pot roast is awesome! I've made it twice now,  both times with mashed potatoes and the second time around I doubled the ranch, gravy, and italian mixes because we liked it so much. My boyfriend is pretty picky about what he eats. He loved this!

I loved this roast. I used a bone in roast and I feel it was even more flavorful. Served it with some roasted potatoes and the gravy around the roast was actually thick enough to spoon on top of them. That has never happened with another roast! Don't skip the flour step!

My husband said, "That's the best roast I've had my whole life." He's almost 50, so that's saying something!  :)  I just threw everything in the slow cooker and went to work. It was ready to eat when I got home. For next time, he suggested dropping in some chunks of potato with the onions and carrots.

Followed the directions accordingly and it was a big hit with the family. Easy but packed with flavor. I enjoy pot roast with brown gravy so this is a winner to me.

wow! a new favorite of mine.  Great flavor and super easy. I added a little more water and next time I'll try it without the flour.  I added some carrots and small red potatoes. It was so delicious.

Absolutely delicious. My father who's even more picky than my 5 year old loved it so much he requested I make it for his 80th birthday next week. And cutting down on the sodium doesn't take away from the flavor one bit.

OMG AMAZING!! I cook regularly and I swear this is the best meal I've ever made!! I added the carrots and red potatoes as well as 2/3 cup water instead of 1/2. Everything else was followed exactly..I did not find this at all too salty but if you're worried about that use low sodium seasonings and don't salt the roast, easy peasy :) So yummy and super easy!!

I tried this recipe last night and thought it was too overwhelming of a taste of all those dry packets. Maybe I put too much of each but all I could taste was the spices and not the beef. I wanted to venture from my simple recipe of garlic salt and onion powder but I think I will stick with my recipe. Hubby said it was not a keeper. Sorry!

Yes, it's sort of a strange combination of mixes, but it works wonderfully!! I added quartered, peeled potatoes around the sides of the roast. Love the simplicity of the recipe for busy days. Thank you!

I have tried this several times and is very good. I don't use any salt and Is salty enough for us.  My own preference I use the small can of chicken broth instead of water. Will be making another one tomarrow .

Easy and delicious.  Followed the recipe as is except added some baby gold potatoes and a few celery stalks.  Tender and juicy, great flavor. It got rave reviews and was gone within a day. Definitely making again soon!

This was awesome!  My family loved it!  The flavoring is just right and everyone I share the recipe with loves it as well. The seasonings make the most amazing gravy I have ever tasted on a roast. My roast just fell apart it was so tender. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I loved the flavor but it was pretty dry. I think shredding the meat part way through would help.

This was the best pot roast I've ever made!! I used all purpose gluten free flour, and gluten free dressing and gravy mixes as I'm celiac. I put the carrots in, an added halved mini potatoes. It was a great success!!

If you are a ho-hum pot roast fan, you will love this.  If you're a pot roast lover, you will go ape over this recipe. Truly the best pot roast I've ever made. I didn't think it was too salty like other reviewers, although I added several potatoes which I've heard soak up some of the salt. I increased the water to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of wine. Next time I will stick to 1/2 cup water plus the wine..that would be plenty of liquid. I also added baby portabella mushrooms.  After about 7 hours, I thickened the juices with a 1 tablespoon of cornstarch mixed with a little cold water and continued to cook a total of 10 hours. Delicious.-can't wait for leftovers.

I thought it was delicious but we made it twice and found it very difficult to slice the meat. It was shredding. Did we do something wrong? I used a rump roast because could not find chuck roast. Would that have made a difference? The second time, we let it sit  20 minutes before slicing and we had the same problem, could not get good slices, just shreds. Can someone help?

Excellent!!!!! The flavor was fabulous! !!!!! The only thing I changed was I only put pepper on the roast before the flour as I was afraid of this being to salty. I also layered the bottom of the crockpot with pearl onions. My son who is a picky 9 year old loved this and so did everyone else. This is a definite keeper, thank you!

This was the best slow cooker meal that I have made.  It was easy, and the meat was tender and delicious.  I added small Youkon Gold potatoes.  My husband usually dislikes anything from the slow cooker, and he can't wait to eat the leftovers.  This is a keeper.

This was terrific!  Tried it for the first time this weekend.  Through it together before I headed out for a day of shopping with friends.  We were visiting potters in Seagrove, NC, about 1-1/2 hours from home.  I called my husband when we were headed back just to let him know when I could be expected and he told me, "by the way, I invited so-and-so and so-and-so over for dinner."  It was absolutely perfect!  I was also concerned with the conglomeration of flavors and wondered whether or not it would be too salty. The gravy was thick and flavorful and I think it helped a lot that I also added potatoes mid-way through the cooking. I did not salt the roast prior to dredging it.  Very tasty!  I'll definitely do this again!

It was good, not excellent.  The seasoning mixes made it rather salty, I would use 1/2 of each and more water next time. Cooking time is way too long, at least for my crock pot, it was cooked (and slightly overdone) after 1 hr high + 3 hrs low, wish I had checked it sooner.  I will try again with less seasoning, more vegies, and shorter cooking time, then this really will be a great roast.

I love this easy recipe, it's been around forever.  But, I add tons and tons of veggies.  Potatoes, carrots, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, red  bell peppers and fresh herbs.  I think that helps to cut the salt issue some have with the just meat and packet version.  I can't imagine a pot roast without veggies.  I would never add additional salt!  Wait until it is done and season then if necessary.  I'll be making a yummy Cottage pie with the leftovers.

Tried this recipe today and needless to say, there's nothing left. It was awesome. After reading some of the other posts, I worried it would be too salty but we thought it was fine. I added some cubed yukon potatoes and a little bit more water but otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. Will definitely make this one again. So easy!

This was so easy.  I loved how you could serve it from the same pot.  The self made gravy was so yummy.  I will make it again. My husband helped with the meal and browned the meat first then we coated it with flour. It worked just fine.  (He had not read the recipe all the way through when he tried it.

This worked really well and did have more taste than normal slow cooker pot roast. I cubed some potatoes and added them to the mix.

I did something different here. I substituted a 4.5lbs pork shoulder for the beef roast and used 2 packets of pork gravy, doubled the rest of the recipe, cooked it on high for 6hrs plus threw in some cut up gold potatos at the three hour mark. It came out great! Plus, the house smelled wonderful well into the night time. It is now on our list to serve when we have company, it is that good.

Great taste.  We like roast with more veggies, so I added potatoes and celery to the mix.  It had a thick broth-more like gravy than soupy.

I have this in the slow cooker right now - I've tasted a potato and carrot and just from that I can tell that the gravy is amazing. I used a 1/2 round roast that I had in the freezer, in case I didn't like it I wouldn't mess up a whole roast. I was very skeptical, even though the reviews are great, I didn't know how the Ranch dressing mix would taste (I didn't have Ranch dressing mix so I used Ranch Dip seasoning - practically the same thing!) I made a few minor changes - First I browned all sides of the roast then added dried diced onions, about 2 T. minced garlic, about 1/4 C Burgundy wine and about 2 tsp Lea & Perrin's Worcestershire sauce.  I added a little black pepper and NO salt, and the gravy is perfect. As it cooked the gravy got very thick so I added more water as needed. I can't wait until the roast is finished cooking - I want it to be fall apart tender. It smells so good and will have it with fresh collard greens, also on the stove right now. I'm not going to tell my husband about the Ranch Dip & Italian Dressing seasoning, otherwise he'll get it in his head that he won't like it. - Great Recipe! If the roast comes out as good as the gravy then I have a new quick way of cooking a roast in the slow cooker. Next time I'll use a chuck.

I have been doing this recipe for a long time and each time, it gets raves. It's perfect as dinner when you are expecting guests but don't know the exact time they will arrive. I don't add the extra salt or the flour--just brown the roast a bit in a heavy pot, then transfer to the slow cooker, add the seasoning mixes, a little water, and let it become delicious.

I made this and it turned out Wonderful. I used a top round roast five pounds. It didn't fit in my crock pot so I put in the oven on 275 degrees for Eight hours. I also browned the roast first. I cut giant carrots in chunks and put under the meat and I used a can of beef broth instead of water. I cooked some baby portabellas in butter and when the roast was done I added those to the gravy.

Can someone advise on how to make this gluten and dairy free. I know I can't use packaged spices because of those two ingredients. Help! Sounds wonderful.

Saw this on fb, but didn't save it. Thought I could remember all ingredients, and used taco seasoning mix instead of ranch dressing....it was delicious. Next time, I'll try ranch.

I have tried this recipe and it is delicious.  I did not put the flour in but I did put potatoes in also.  Meat, potatoes and vegetables all in one.  I am not a fan of cooked onions so next time I'll try a package of dry onion soup with a little extra water.

This has to be the best pot roast I've ever eaten! I did make a couple of changes: first, I was concerned about the saltiness that some reviewers warned about so I upped the water to almost cover the entire roast. I know this sounds like a lot of water but in the end I was so happy I did because I put the left over in the freezer at the request of my picky eater who wants to add it to her steak :D. Second, instead of onions and dry beef gravy, I substituted 2 packages of Lipton onion soup mix only because I was rushing. Oh, and I added baby carrots and celery during the last hour.

So forgiving!  I loved the flavor, my husband hates pot roast but loved this and even the picky kids ate it without complaint.  I forgot the onion.  I didn't have italian dressing mix but Italian spice mix so I used it instead, just a bunch of shakes, and I sure didn't take the time to coat it all nicely.  I tossed the roast in the crock pot, all the dry ingredients on top of it then turned the tap on over top of it all to mix it all up on top.  I gave it a bit of a swirl and closed the lid.  It was already noon by then so I turned it on to high until we ate at 5:30.  So good.

My boyfriend and I made this today.  It was simply amazing!  The only changes we made were a cup of water instead of a half cup and then we also added in red potatoes.  The roast was really tender!  The gravy was my favorite part :)!

What a great recipe - quick and easy.  The carrots were outstanding soaked with all of the flavorings.  I accidently picked up spicy ranch mix - but it still worked - gave the flavor an extra kick.  My boyfriend got home before I did and add a little more water just to thicken the "gravy".

The husband loves pot roast, so I figure I give it a try. WOW. Although not really a meat person, I loved this! Made the recipe as directed and added baby carrots and potatoes. YUM! Not too salty and not sweet (that a previous review complained about).

Family loved recipe. Super easy! I didn't have Italian dressing packet so I used regular Italian seasoning I had in pantry. And didn't use flour. I subbed brown gravy packet for the dry beef gravy mix. It thickened it up nice. Thanks for the recipe :)

I too was skeptical about adding the "dry mixes" but was very impressed with the results!!  The only change made was adding "dry" beef with mushrooms gravy mix to bring the total beef gravy weight up to what was required (1.2 oz).  The best crock pot roast I have ever made!  Thanks for the recipe.

I loved this! I've always had issues with beef in slow cookers not retaining it's moisture. This, since it was basically cooked in gravy was absolutely perfect. This was also one of the easiest recipes I've tried. Can't wait to make the leftovers into sandwiches!

THIS is The Way Pot Roast Should Taste!  Absolutely the tastiest and easiest dish of comfort food you will make this Fall/Winter. I followed the recipe exactly. Served the left-over two nights later over wide noodles. Delish. :)

This was FANTASTIC!  I used a packet of Aujus mix instead of the gravy so my "gravy" didn't thicken like it should have.. I just thickened it the old fashioned way, but other than that... it was PERFECT! I put a few potatoes in the pot with the carrots and onions, but also made mashed potatoes on the side.  I served it with a garlic beer bread which was also very good! Thanks for this keeper!!

So good! I did everything the recipe calls for but added some red potatoes, like I noticed a lot of people did. The only thing is that it's so good and so easy I almost feel like I'm cheating!

I made this a few weeks ago and have come back to safe the recipe so I can make it again.  I was delicious!  I did add more water to the crock pot.  At least a cup during the cooking process.  I also omitted the onions as I thought the tastes would be over powered by it.  
Very easy and very good.

Just made this yesterday. I made it exactly as it's listed here. It was simple and very tasty! The meat was very tender. This Ones's a keeper. Next time I will add celery stalks, and red potatoes along with the carrots and onions. It tasted even better today for lunch!
Thanks,
Ed

This has to be the MOST DELICIOUS pot roast I have ever tasted. I've been making my mom's recipe (baked in the oven)for years and it doesn't compare to the incredible flavors in this recipe. I was not sure about leaving out potatoes, but I did and served it with garlic mashed potatoes. So good and easy! Only thing I did different was to cut up the carrots into thirds and add as many as I can fit in the pot. The first time I made it I didn't have to share with anyone and I can vouch that it makes incredible leftovers, too!

This recipe sounded so crazy, but had good reviews, so I had to try it.  It is now a standard in our house.  I've made it with chuck roast and pork roast, but otherwise cook it exactly by the recipe. Thank yous to the cook who submitted this.  When I'm out of ideas, this always works.

My favorite pot roast recipe!
Found this recipe last fall and have made it lots of times since. I even made it has our Christmas Day Dinner this past year with the kids and in-laws over as something different then all the ham and turkey we've been having for the holidays during that time frame from Thanksgiving and Christmas. 
If you make following directions this is soooo good if you like a bit of punch of flavor. The awesome thing with this recipe is if you don't prefer the taste as tangy then just add more water when you make it. I add more water because I Love the gravy and like extra for the next day with left overs over noodles. I do add beef bouillon cubes though so its just not plain old water. Say 3 cubes to 2 cups water.

Wow. This was really tangy. I was so curious what this would taste like because I would never have thought to combine those 3 mixes. Well, the end result was a very tangy sauce that is difficult to describe. The closest thing I can compare it to is something like a pepper steak gravy (though there is no pepper added to this). I followed this recipe exactly except that I only used a 1 1/2 pound roast. But I still made the full amount of gravy/sauce this recipe calls for. And I'm glad I did because there was barely enough gravy for the  1 1/2 lb. roast. I'm not sure I'll make this again, though. Will probably try a different recipe. And I definitely wouldn't ever make this for company because I could see how the taste might be too strong for some.

This was fantastic.  I used as big a roast as I could fit in my crock pot since it was being made for a pot luck.  Didn't have any carrots, but used one large parsnip and 3 potatoes cubed and one head of celery.  That roast was very tender and the flavor was amazing.

Astounding and easy.  I make it for dinner on the coldest nights.  This has enough flavor to salvage low-grade roasts, but I prefer leaner cuts if they're on sale.

I've tried making pot roast before and mine always came out dry. I don't know if it was the cut of meat I was using, but this particular recipe was sensational! I probably would cut out the sprinkled sat on the roast as the gravy mix and ranch mix have enough as far as I'm concerned. This is definately a keeper!

I'm always looking for a way to spice up pot roast or beef stew without overdoing it.  Instead of just using Italian Salad Dressing, I used Wishbone Robusto Italian.  This has a real kick to it and was absolutely delicious.  I didn't use the ranch dressing.  Instead I used dry onion soup, brown gravy mix, Robusto Italian and some water. I don't measure, so I can't give numbers, just wing it.  But, the Robusto made the difference.

This is my favorite pot roast!!! I've tried others that had wine and/or added cream of mushroom soup etc, but this is the best which infuses all of the flavors and it's super simple. I'm on the lazy side so I usually grab the baby carrots and cut up some potatoes so everything is in one crockpot. Delish!

I just finished eating this roast. It is the very best I have ever made. I added 3 quartered potatos 2cloves of garlic and I used chicken broth instead of water in the recipe. All I can say is wow. Your going to love it.

Flavor!  I had struggled with less than flavorful pot roasts before this.  Onion soup packets and mushroom soups were not enough.  This, however, was very flavorful! I have finally found my pot roast recipe!I salted and peppered the roast and skipped the flour.  I simply rubbed the roast with the dry packet mixture and then added the left over dry rub to the water and poured it over the roast.  I put it in the cooker with the carrots on the sides/top.  My kids loved it, especially the carrots.  Mashed potatoes are a must have with this, you will want to pour the broth over everything! THANK YOU!  This will go in the regular rotation!

Very good!  I didn't have a lot of time for it to cook, so I set the slow cooker to medium for 6 hours, instead of low for 8 hours.  No other changes and it was fantastic!

I LOVE this recipe!! It is the best tasting pot roast I have ever had, even my picky kid likes it. The only change I've ever done is adding more veggies. I like to add small red potatoes and some sliced celery along with baby carrots.

Love this! For a nice spicy kick, I switched out the beef gravy mix for a McCormick's garlic/peppercorn sauce packet. It's our new favorite!

The easiest and most delicious pot roast I've ever made.  Added 8 oz. of fresh mushrooms.  Served with mashed potatoes+cauliflower, cooked spinach, and cranberry sauce.  Hubby said it was as good as Thanksgiving dinner!

Really, really great! It's so nice to see a slow cooker receipe for roast beef that DOESN'T include a packet of dried or canned onion soup! (We don't care for that). The flavor of the gravy was really great and the roast of course came out so... tender! The only changes I made was to add a full cup of water instead of a 1/2 and we added red-skinned potatoes.

I have made this dish a few times and I am never disappointed. It is satisfying and easy. I have also shared with other friends and they agree. I occassionally serve with sauteed string beans with garlic because I love veggies, but it is not necessary.

My husband raved and he doesn't even like roast. I made it according to the directions but used pork roast instead of pot roast because that's what I had on hand. The meat was delicious, moist and juicy, and the veggies were flavorful and tender. Thanks for the great recipe!

Might be the best pot roast I've made.  I had to substitute Italian dressing (from a bottle) for the packet, which made it a bit oily.  Tasted SO good!

I think this will be my go-to pot roast recipe from now on.  This had great flavor, was very tender,  and the leftovers were good on sub rolls with cheese.  They would also be good as beef over noodles.  I made a couple changes to suit my tastes.  I did not use onions, just sprinkled some onion powder in.  I placed the carrots under the roast and I also used extra of those.  Lastly, I used two Italian-style salad mixes and and did not use the ranch dressing mix.

I was skeptical about this recipe but I am so glad I tried it. We just love it. I cook my vegetables separate so I do not add any water. The juices from the roast make the gravy. Awesome way to cook roast.

Super good, but a little on the salty side. I think next time I'll only use half of the amount of Italian seasoning and see if that helps any.

This recipe was great. Made it for the family and had them asking for more. I used pot roast seasoning in addition to the recipe because I couldn't find the dry beef seasoning. It turned out as good as ever.

Fantastic Recipe... at first, I found it strange not to put a lot of water in the crock pot but it turned out fantastic.  All family members raved about it.

I love this recipe! It is so easy and tastes amazing!  The only change I make is that I don't add the whole package of dry Italian dressing mix.  It just depends on how tangy you want it.  I have already passed this recipe out many times!

This is so easy and turned out great! It is really good as is, but I have also made it with a couple of small changes to suit my family's tastes. I add a few potatoes cut into quarters or smaller, 3-4 minced fresh garlic cloves,  3 stalks of chopped celery. I also used beef broth instead of water when mixing the packaged spices together. The first time that Iade this, I was skeptical about using ranch on the roast but it added a nice flavor. I will definitely make this again, both following the original recipe and with my changes. Super easy, great flavors, and tender meat....it was a hit with my family (even my picky eater cleaned his plate! I served it over rice like stew or with a salad and crusty bread.

I just made this today and it was WONDERFUL!
I was always intimidated to use a crock pot but I am so glad I did. I read the reviews and this is what I changed: I added  2 whole garlic cloves and peeled, cubed russet potatoes (these are known to soak up the sodium, and it did). And as per some reviewers I whisked the dry ingredients with 1 cup hot water.
I also made this on high for 4 hours.
I will definately make this again and maybe try cooking it for 8 hours just see if there is a difference. I don't think it was too salty as some people said. Thank you Keylimeone for this recipe; I feel so impowered to make more meals!

Made this exactly as written. It was good but wasn't so amazing as other reviews have said. To me it tasted very traditional, nothing special. I was hoping for something a bit different flavor-wise. Maybe I'm just not a pot-roast gal!

That is the best recipe ever!! The Roast was perfect I only had to cook mine 6 hours before it was perfect and super tender!! I did add potatoes and thicken the gravy a little at the end with some corn starch! But I will never use a different roast recipe ever!!!

Amazing. Huge hit with my belly. I added a little cornstarch to the gravy to thicken it, but kept all the remaining ingredients as is. Can't wait to make this for a holiday family dinner.

OMG!!!! This was sooooo good. I was skeptical at first with the ingredients, but it was absolutely wonderful. I could not find the dry beef gravy mix in the store so I used a pkg of dry beef stew mix. That was the only thing i changed. Didn't need to change a thing to this recipe. It was so dang good. My family loves tortillas so I warmed up tortillas and added the meat. Yum and we used the wonderful gravy for dipping sauce. High Five for this recipe.

This pot roast was okay, but I found the gravy to be too tangy.  Probably due to the italian dressing and perhaps some of the ranch.  I added extra water, and was very thankful that I had.

My husband and son liked this recipe a lot but I was told it would be even better if there was more heat to it- like adding some cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes.  I'll try that next time!

I loved this recipe! It was a bit salty for me from the dry mixes but everyone kept going back for seconds. The meat was very moist and tender. I added 1 cup of water and I am so happy I did. I think 1/2 cup wouldn't have been enough. Next time I will try a 5 lb roast instead of the 2.5 lbs to see if it would be less salty. No additional salt needed! I just added pepper.

Made this last w/e for apres ski dinner.  Extended family loved it.  Didn't change a thing except used a 5.5 lb roast and 2 cups of water.  Melt in your mouth tender and delish!

I loved this.  I used a new crockpot that I'm not used to.  I seemed a bit dry but that was probably the crockpot.  The gravy was great.  I'm going to add a little sour cream to it and make stroganoff tomorrow.

I too had reservations about the mixes but after preparing this dish twice I am a believer!  This is just what the doctor ordered for a chilly winter day...and so easy to fix.

This recipe is awesome, I made it and my 15 year old who is not fond of roast asked for seconds. You cannot beat the flavor of this dish. Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!

This was excellent! I too was skeptical using the 3 different mixes but it is so good. I added a few potatoes and cooked this overnight on low temp so it was ready for lunch today. 2 thumbs up from DH and will make this again for sure!

This was definitely a keeper.  Added the 3/4 C water for thinner gravy & the flavor was just delish !
