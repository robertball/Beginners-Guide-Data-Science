Great marinade!  It definitely has a southwestern flair to it.  I only used 1 Tbsp. of chili powder and added a tsp. of smoked paprika.  I pounded the chicken breasts down thin and let these marinate overnight.  The flavor from the lime really came through but wasn't overpowering.

I didn't have any limes, so I used 1 lemon per 2 limes for the recipe and also added garlic powder to it. Came out amazing. Will definitely use this again.

My taste buds are dancing!  I loved loved loved it while the hubster just said it was "okay". We have a trailer here in town that sells barbecued (smoked) chicken and it comes with corn tortillas, beans, rice, grilled onion and a couple chipotle peppers and limes and it's known as "trailer chicken", well, this is it! I sliced this up and served it with corn tortillas, mexican rice, tortilla chips and warm jalapeno corn dip and trimmings like mexican cheese and sour cream. All I was missing was some sliced avocado. Thanks for a wonderful meal!

Wicked moist and flavorful! I meant to grill it the same day but ended up baking it the next night. It was marinated over night. I breaded it and baked it 35 mins at 350 and it came out delicious! I baked it on a cookie rack over a baking sheet...Next time I'll try grilling it. Followed the recipe ingredients exactly.

WOW!! This is a great recipe. I have been marinating my chicken in a similar marinade for a while since we have lime trees, except I have used Old Bay, but I love these seasonings. I do marinate for longer but it is good to remember that limes do somewhat cook chicken after too long.

My boyfriend always likes to eat the same things and never likes to change it up.  Well I made this put it over white rice and had snow peas with it.  At first he looked at it and said "what is this?".  I told him what was in it and he just made a face.  Well after he took a couple bites that all changed.  I was so surprised that he liked it so much.  Actually he has asked me to make it on a regular basis.  So, I would recommend this reciepe to everyone.  It  may seem like a werid group of ingredients but man is it good.  The only thing I did change was, I put half of the amount of chili pepper and subsituted the other half of it with smoked paprika.  (just because I have terrible acid reflux)  Well it worked because I was able to eat it with no problems.  Anyone who try's this recipe please rate it and comment.  I'd love to see if everyone feels the same.

Outstanding, I didn't baste the chicken while cooking due to sanitary concerns of the chicken juice being in the marinade. The Chicken was flavorful and moist, Great recipe.

Made this just as specified and only marinated three large breasts.  It was way too much marinade but the flavor and moisture were fantastic!  Loved the zest of the fresh limes.  Didn't really notice the chili pepper much honestly.  I let the chicken marinate for about 3 hours and I would do it again that same amount of time or longer.    Will definitely make this again.  My husband and mom both enjoyed it as well.

A good recipe but a little heavy on the limes. If I had used 2 or 3 limes instead of 4 I think I would have given this 5 stars

LOVED This marinade!  I kept it in the fridge for 2 days and the taste was incredible. CHicken was SO tender too.. NOt sure if it was b/c of the lime juice or what but it was deelish.  Sometimes I have a hard time with chicken breasts..  sometimes they are too dry but this turned out perfect.  can't wait to make it again.  It makes such a difference on a charcoal grill too... vs a gas grill.  the coals give it much better flavor.

I made this for dinner and it is cooking right now as I type this. I will say that is smells awesome! I did change the recipe a bit---I only used one tablespoon chili powder , added fresh minced garlic cloves and a half teaspoon of red pepper flakes plus a little salt and pepper. I did not use four limes! Only two limes and one lemon, juiced. Just a tip... heat the fresh lemon and limes in the microwave for about twenty seconds. It really gets all the juice out of the fruit. Can't wait to eat this chicken!  My neighbor next door just came outside and asked the hubby what we were making for dinner. He-he! I will send him the recipe later on.

This was too much lime and it overpowered the other flavors.  No one was thrilled but it did smell amazing on the grill.  I will use less lime if I make it again and maybe some orange juice for sweetness to balance the lime.

If you love lime flavor on your grilled chicken then this is the marinade for you. I thought it was too much lime and I used 1 lime for 2 pieces of chicken. The chicken came out nice and moist. I served it with LF sour cream and slice avocado. I would definately make this again and just cut down on the lime a little more. I went with some of the reviews and cut back on the chile powder but I should have used the full amount. It wasn't spicy at all. I this would be a good marinade for chicken fajitas. My husband enjoyed it!

Absolutely excellent. I didn't have sage so I put granulated garlic in it's place. I pounded the chicken to a 1/2 in thickness and added the marinade to a zippered bag. I chilled it 3 1/2 hours, turning twice, and it was EXCELLENT. I was worried about the chili powder amount but it added a subtle heat. Very tasty. In the future I may try some minced garlic, just because I love garlic.
I will make it with sage next time to give the recipe its' due, but it was great the way I made it. I grilled it over coals.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe. It's a keeper!

A very good marinade. I let my marinade in the fridge for several hours, then baked the chicken (and didn't baste it). The spices and seasoning are wonderful, a little too much lime for my personal taste, otherwise great!

Overkill on Chili powder and lime.  Salt and garlic powder would have help.  All in all disappointing.  Don't know how this got 5 stars.

Awesome recipe I thought it was too much chili powder at first, but used the recommended amount any way and it was great, the lime juice cuts the heat of the chili just slightly, we did ours overs mesquite charcoal, yum!!!

I thought this was fantastic! It was a little on the "limey" side but I love lime and it made it super moist and tender. This was so simple and it turned out great. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great start. I loved how juicy it made my chicken but it had too much going on for grilled chicken.

Husband and kids loved it. I thought it was pretty good, so I've scored it in the middle. But I must say, the men gobbled it up. I used 1 t of chili powder instead of 2 T due to my yung'uns (1 yr and 3 yr) tender taste buds. It definitely is an unusual blend of flavors but it works!

I made this tonight with legs and thighs...the flavor was awesome!!  No added salt or pepper, made it as stated and it was so flavorful, the skin was crisp and the meat was tender!!  This is a new favorite that I will try on pork and beef as well.  Thank you for sharing and being bored ;-)

This quickly became a favorite!  After reading other reviews, I did cut the chili powder in half, the rest I kept the same!  BUT I did use chicken tenderloins, and only marinaded 30 minutes on each side.  Amazing!  I've used this on top of salads, and in tacos!  So good!

Very good marinade! I originally had two chicken breasts marinating in this, but our plans changed and we weren't able to grill the chicken that night. Two days later, I managed to salvage the chicken by baking it in the oven, shredding it and using it for some really tasty quesadillas! I hope to try this marinade again on the grill!

UPDATE: I used this marinade again over the weekend, and it's still a five-star recipe! My boyfriend loved the flavors. Even his friend, who went to culinary school in NYC and has worked in a lot of restaurants, complimented me on the marinade. My only change would be to maybe use on less lime. Other than that, this is a keeper!

This had a very heavy lime flavor which is okay, but it was too much for my kids and even my husband.  Might make this again with some slight changes.  We also felt it needed more of a kick so I would add more chili powder and paprika (orginally used 1 T of each).

Our family really enjoyed this recipe.  I marinaded the chicken for 3 hours.  The fowl was very juicy and tender.  We will definitely make it again.

What a great marinade. I wanted to grill the chicken but we were out of propane, so I had to cook them on the stove. I think they would have been more tender on the grill, but they were still good. I added a tbsp of paprika as suggested by other reviews. Kids loved it so I'm happy!!

LOVED THIS!!!  So few ingredients with such big flavour!  Really quick to put together, the lime gave this chicken great zing - I used Chipotle Chili Powder instead for extra kick and even more southwestern flair, yummy!  Repeat hands down :)

Absolutely fantastic!!! I did cut the Cumin down to 1/2 teaspoon just b/c I'm not a big fan of Cumin and I used lime juice instead of juicing the pitiful looking limes available at my local grocer, but everything else was followed to the letter. I disagree w/ those who thought it was too lime heavy or too chili heavy...I thought it was a perfect balance as did everybody else in my family. It had just the right amount of spice (I wouldn't serve a lime and chili based dish to the kiddos, anyway, folks) and the chicken was very moist. DEFINITELY a keeper deserving of much better reviews than some that have been received. Thanks so much for the recipe!!!

My daughter and I tried this last night and we found it to have a very stong lime taste. I will do this recipe again but cut the number of limes in half.  I think the leftovers will make good chicken nachos.

MUCH too sour, and I only used 1/2 of the lime juice. I added minced garlic, but that didn't help either! Am definitely taking this out of my recipe book!

Good Recipie. Used oven instead. The yogurt makes it even more tender. Enough for 4 people if you make a nice salad. Enjoy!

I must admit i was hesitant at first with the amount of lime this recipe called for so i used a bit less. Still turned out great. Made the chicken really moist and was great to serve for the family.  This one is definitely a favorite of mine and i will continue to make it.

This was INCREDIBLE!  It was too snowy outside to use our grill, so I used a stovetop skillet/grill.  It was still amazing!  I served it over risotto, adding oregano, sage, curry powder, and a little crushed red pepper to the risotto.  It will definitely remain a favorite in this house!  Leftovers work great over a salad for lunch!

I didn't have any sage so I used 1/2 tsp dried marjoram and 1/2 tsp dried thyme. I marinated for about 3 hrs, turning once. I will probably cut back to 3 limes next time. It kind of reminded me of how some mediterranean kabobs are marinated. I really enjoyed this dish. Next time I will use the sage.

I put mine in the fridge in the morning to marinate while I was at work.  I skipped the part about using the leftover marinade, and frankly, don't think it was needed.  This had a very standout flavor that was appealing, but could be overpowering for some people.  I would make this again.

I took the advise of others and cut the lime juice to 1/2 and it was still to much.  Very disappointing. Really thought this has some potential.

Excellent dish!! Prior to marinating, I sprinkled lightly with garlic salt and only used 1 tblsp chili powder. Also, I didn't feel that basting was necessary so that cut out a step. This chicken was full of flavor. It's become one of our favorites.

It was just OK.  A little on the "too hot" side because of all the chili powder and the lime was a little too much.  I think if you would add garlic and omit one T. chili powder it may not be so bad.

We're picky eaters and this was awesome. This was printed and stored in my actual recipe file in the kitchen. I did it exactly like the recipe called for, it turned out perfectly. The husband, eight year old and the three year old loved it as well and that's NOT normal.

This chicken was delicious, and enjoyed by a large group this past weekend who would have told me otherwise.

I used 4+ tablespoons of bottled lime juice  because it was easier.  I also added about 3 large cloves of pressed garlic, and one packed tablespoon of brown sugar.  I marinated in a plastic bag overnight in the fridge, and the next day, tender, juicy, flavorful chicken on the bbq!

Do not ease up on the chili powder.  I added the brown sugar only to cut the tartness of the line juice- the taste was still wonderfully limey, and the chili gave it a nice kick.

Awesome, awsome.  I don't believe I've ever had better chicken.  I followed the recipe exactly, so juicy,so tender, so flavorful.  My daughter and husband loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this last night for my family.  Everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly, no changes.  I thought it would be to spicey with the chili powder...it is so not.  GREAT JOB....

The lime was overpowering and the meat was dry. I only used two limes and left it in the marinade it for one hour. Neither of us liked it.

My husband and I both thought that the lime was way to overpowering.  I used the marinade on both grilled chicken breasts and steak.  I used the meat to top a salad for dinner.  We used an avocado ranch dressing which drowned out some of the lime taste.  So, overall the salad was very good, but we would not have enjoyed the meat on its own.

No one was impressed with this.  Too much lime, too much chili.  Thought this would be good as it is basically a Fajita marinade, but it was not good.

This recipe was good, but it could be better. There was too much lime for my tastes, and there also could have been a little bit of broth added. Will try again, but change a little.

I made the marinade mostly as directed (I put in one TBSP of chili powder and after mixing it in, it was clear I didn't want to add any more, especially as I was cooking for my mom and she cannot tolerate too much spice) leaving aside the oil to whisk in last (this is how I always do marinades with oil), and then I tasted it.  It had a very sharp, flat flavor, so I had to add several other ingredients to round it out and give it more depth and complexity.  I added mustard, lemon juice, white wine, garlic powder, and salt.  The cooking instructions were good.  With the changes to the marinade, the chicken turned out great.  I want to try my version on thighs, too.

I made the marinade in the morning and added the chicken expecting to grill it that evening. Things happened and I didnt grill it until the next evening. Lets just say that the flavor was in every single bite, the whole family loved it.

this was ok but honestly I don't know that it had that much flavor - the lime wasn't overpowering.  I think next time I'll add brown sugar, a little salt and some garlic like others have suggested.

Only thing I can say is it was moist. Overall a big waste of spices, nothing blended together & I followed the directions & didn't change a thing. Won't be using this again when there are so many excellent chicken recipes on this website.

I made two changes that should not greatly effect the original recipe. I used fresh sage instead of dry and I cut the breasts into cubes and mad kabobs. The marinade itself tasted terrific however after cooking down the leftover marinade and basting the meat the flavor was overpowering. I would skip the basting all together. 3 stars relates to my experience only. I will try this again because I really enjoyed the flavor of the marinade after I first mixed it.

Good for fish or chicken. Can be done on foil in oven, as well. I recommend cutting the chicken breasts in half lengthwise and tenderizing with forks for the best absorption of flavor

Pretty good! It was a bit to acidic. Next time I might add a bit of agave nectar or honey and perhaps some garlic. It was good, but the lime overwhelmed the herbs and spices.

Very easy to make for a not-so confident cook like me. Not real spicy, and we also used the marinade for center cut pork chops as well and they grilled absolutely deliciously! Thank you -  a definite keeper recipe for our summertime fun.

Such a great Marinade!!!  I used 3 chicken breasts and 3 limes and didn't feel like there was too much at all.  I did just marinade the chicken and not brush the left over marinade on the chicken while it cooked.  I made this last weekend and I am making it again this weekend!!!

This was really good, all I added was a handful of fresh Cilantro to the marinade (I had a bunch and it seemed to fit the theme).
My 19 year son didn't drown it in barbecue sauce so it must have been good!

OMgosh!!!
This chicken is the best!!   I threw all the ingrediants in a pan to marinate early in the morning and then I grilled it around 7 PM.   It tasted very similar to Pollo Tropi. chicken and as one reviewer had said the chilli pepper did not over power it or make it hot.  I did everything except use fresh limes.  I didn't have any so I used lime juice and .....whoops I forgot to turn it over every 30 minutes while marinading .
Someone had said they got to much marinade; I didn't.   I would make more just to use for the basting.
Oh I also used boneless skinless chicken thighs.
I served corn from the grill and a strawberry and spinach salad with it.  they were both recipes from the site.

Just like another reviewer had stated, all I could taste was lime juice. I followed the recipe exactly as described. I will likely try it again and reduce the amount of limes from 4 to 2 and see how it turns out.

Used chicken parts and roasted indirect on grill at 350, to internal temp of 165.  This way kept meat moist without basting.

Everyone in the family loved it. I’d suggest keeping a little of the marinade back in reserve, and pouring it over the cooked chicken, because even marinated and basted, chicken breasts tend to dry out a bit.

Excellent as written regarding ingredients. I put it all in a large baggie and refrigerated overnight, turning bag every few hours. I would never use marinade from raw chicken to baste with, but that's just me. Some say cooking it makes it a non-issue. I take no chances!  Great combo of flavors.

I've made this a few times--it's a nice easy marinade for chicken. I don't always have limes and have substituted lemon (including some lemon zest) with perfectly fine results. This last time the weather wasn't conducive to grilling so I threw the chicken in a skillet with a bunch of the marinade and a little chicken broth and cooked it that way. It was really good.

I loved this marinade.  We had had some terrible results with chicken breasts lately.  This marinade made for tender grilled chicken with taste that got loads of rave reviews at a graduation party.  The hardest part was juicing the limes!  I clearly need to get a juicer if I am going to keep making this, which I am!

Superb. I made this late at night and it tasted delicious. The chicken had a nice citrus taste,  on top of being cooked on a bbq grill and slightly chard. 

If I had to sacrifice my body to the gods I'd rub my body in this marinade just like this chicken did. Salute to you ol' chicken.

Did not care for this at all-too much lime, giving a dry, puckery taste, and the savory herbs added to that sensation.  Lacked depth and needed a complementary flavor to sweeten or lighten up the dryness/flatness.

I really like the lime on the grill, so we put this one together last night.  I was sure I wouldn't be able to eat it as soon as I smelled the finished marinade - I was wrong!! We threw all the chicken quarters in and let it set for several hours while we did errands, then fired up the grill late afternoon.  They were great! Easy to put together, great coloring on the grill.  Think I will stick to "thin" meats though, the meaty parts that didn't have crispy skin or direct marinade time were perfectly juicy but without much flavor.  This one surprised me, thanks!

I made this exactly as written but it wasn't one of my favorites. The chicken was very moist and the lime favor was nice, but apart from that a little bland.  I think some salt may have helped it but I think I'll try other recipes before trying this again.

Didn't care for this. Not sure why it got such good reviews. The chicken was very moist but the cumin and sage were overwhelming. Might try it again with other spices minus the sage and cumin

I served 28 guest that loved it. I used concentrate lime juice(for that many servings & a even strength of the taste). I sub'd some of the chili powder for cayenne powder & added Smoked paprika. I marinated boneless thighs 4 hours, coated in fine Italian bread crumps and baked. Plan on doing the grill version @ first chance.

We had this for supper tonight and neither my wife or I liked it. We both only ate 1/2 a chicken breast. This is one recipe that we will not keep or make again.

This was ok.  I like the flavor of lime, but it was a little too prominent here.
