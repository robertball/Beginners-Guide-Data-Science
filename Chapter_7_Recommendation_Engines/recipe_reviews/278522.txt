Both my Hubby and I really enjoyed the flavor of this oatmeal. However, I used an unflavored, unsweetened protein powder, and only 1 tbsp at that. I think an entire scoop (the one that came in the protein powder) would have been far too much for just 1/4 cup of oats. I also added a pinch of salt, vanilla extract, and some cinnamon to make up for the fact that the protein powder was unflavored. This oatmeal comes together very quickly and easily (plus it has plenty of peanut butter and banana flavor) that it would make a great anytime snack. I topped mine with extra banana slices and some extra melted peanut butter. Will make again! Thank you for the recipe!
