This is a great recipe.  I've been making it for well over 25 years but haven't added the nutmeg, will do that now.  
The only things I do different is use margarine/butter in place of the shortening and take corn flakes, put them into a one cup measuring cup, crush them down with my hand until I have a cup, then sprinkle on the bottom crust before putting the apples (I use macintosh or cortland) on the crust.  It catches and absorbs the apple juices and no one would ever guess the bars contain cornflakes.

This recipe is also called "Apple Slices". That is what my Danish grandmother called them. It's the egg yolk in the dough that makes it different from pie dough. We like this dough much better than pie crust. My mother brought it to every family gathering. When cool, drizzle with glaze made from confectioner's sugar and lemon juice. No water or milk! That also is authentic.

This recipe was very good. My only suggestions are to increase the sugar if you are using Granny Smith apples. I always use those in baking b/c they don't get mushy but this recipe turned out quite tart. Also, moisten some waxed paper to stick to your counter then lightly flour it and roll out the dough. This way you can just lift the wax paper, turn it over and peel it off your crust instead of trying to get the crust off of your counter in one piece. I do recommend the lemon juice/powdered sugar glaze as another suggested, be sure to taste for sweetness before drizzling. I found this recipe is easily halved for a smaller pan.

FANTASTIC Apple Pie recipe!  No brown sugar?  Use white sugar, and drizzle a little honey inbetween apple layers. White sugar or honey doesn't hinder the taste, and the honey adds a special flavor.  Don't be scared to add a couple extra teaspoons of cinnamon, it only makes it better. The thickness of your apple slices determines the texture of the filling:  extra-thin (1 cm) slices for soft filling (almost apple-saucey), and thin (3 cm) slices for chunky apple pie.   The fact this pie was in a 9x13 and not in a round pan was PERFECT for my situation - Im in Europe right now, and wanted to share a traditional American recipe, but didnt have a round pan for it! This recipe was the solution, and was a fantastic treat at that.  I've made it three times already!  And the crust recipe is absolutely wonderful, I've used it for quiches as well. Because this recipe has top and bottom crust, you'll have to alter it a little: Just cut the amount of the ingredients for the dough in half, and there you have a bottom crust for a perfect homemade quiche. (Just say no to ready-made pie forms!)  Recommended: 'Belle and Chron's Spinach and Mushroom Quiche '  Note for dough:  Keep dough cold!! Easier to work with, and best on a cold marble counter top. Put the second half in the fridge when youre working with the first half.  Use your fingers to cut in the shortening, it works the best. And don't stop before its finished, it needs about 3-5 minutes, until its really thoroughly cut in well.

This recipe was a big hit with my family!  The crust was to die for, it was so easy and quick to make.  I used an apple peeler corer all in one to slice up the apples, this saved a lot of time.  When the bars were still warm I poured a glaze on them that was powder sugar, butter, milk and a little vanilla extract.

My family and I love this recipe and so did everyone who has had it.  Other than the logistics of manuevering the dough into a 9x13 I found the dough itself to be easy to work with. What dough isn't a pain to get into any pan perfectly?  I made sure that both layers of dough were over-lapping the pan and then I just pinched and tucked it under itself.  Any excess I cut away, rolled out and used a leaf or apple shaped cookie cutter and laid them on top for decoration. The 9x13 size makes it easy for family functions because you only have on pie to carry versus 2-3 individual pies. We love and I make it frequently.  I think I'll make it now.

I've always have great success with this recipe.  The crust is especially something special (if you use butter instead of shortening).  It makes a perfect amount for a traditional double pie crust with embellishments.  

To make prep a snap I put the flour and salt in my 11-cup food processor.  I cut the butter into tablespoons then toss all of it into the processor bowl and turn it on until it resembles wet beach sand.  Then I put it in a bowl and add the milk/yolk mixture and kneed it together with my hands.  After chilling it rolls like a dream.  I've used it for all my pies for years.  Thanks Nancy for sharing.

Excellent recipe, easy to make and dough is easy to handle.  I added one tablespoon corn starch to sugar mixture as a thickener.  It was wonderful!

I was always afraid of making an Apple Pie. No longer! This recipe was easy and everyone in my family raved. The crust alone is to die for, as it will go with any pie you like. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks Nancy!

I have never rated a recipe with 1 star before, but I don't think this one deserves more than that.  First, the dough was a gloppy mess after adding the egg/milk mixture, so I had to add more and more flour to even get it to roll-out consistency.  Second, this calls for 10 apples - WAY too many for a 9x13 pan and the little amount of sugar it calls for.  I would say it only needs half the amount of apples (I used Braeburn).  Which brings me to the sugar - too little for all the fruit.  AND this definitely needs some cornstarch or something in the filling to thicken it up.  I was horrified that after baking time I pulled it out of the oven to see that there was boiling apple juice around the sides as that makes a soggy bottom crust.  So I had to hold the pan over the sink and tilt it to run all the liquid out and at least a cup of it came out.  THEN I was trying to cut and remove the bars (I made them as part of an order from my home baking business for a graduation party today) and it was a nightmare - the crust was slipping off the apples, all the apples were falling out of the center and not staying together, etc.  If I had time to make something else and chuck this entire batch I would.  It's basically like an apple pie, except the crust is tasteless and the filling not very desireable either.  Sorry, will not make again or recommend to others.

Yummm! My picky eater asked for seconds! Used heavy cream in place of milk for pastry, rolled between plastic wrap for easy handling. Will sprinkle top crust with white sugar next time.10 apples? what size? Used 8 cups thinly sliced Washington Gravestines,fresh off the tree.

I gave this recipe 4 stars only because I believe the proportions are off. I used 6 instead of 10 large granny smith apples. They are tart and they keep their shape when baked. Also, I had enough dough to make 2. I made them each about 10 inches round I placed them on cookie sheets instead of a rectangular 9X13. They turned out flaky and golden brown. Also, I whisked together a little milk and powdered sugar for a glaze to drizzle over the top. Will definately make this again. Yum! thanks!

the dough was pretty hard to spread, and before cooked, it was stretched very thin, although it did poof up after being cooked. The top layer I had a hard time fitting. It wasn't too sweet, next time I would add more sugar, or get sweeter apples.

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would!  The crust on this is fabulous, melt in your mouth type.  I used butter in the crust and  more apples than stated because they cook down so much.  When mixing the apples with the sugar I also added some flour for thickening.  Great recipe!!!

I lined my pan with foil to make it easier to remove, I used Granny Smith apples, added 1 tbsp flour and doubled the cinnamon, these were a big hit!
I have started using my food processor to make the dough and it makes it so easy.
I halve the recipe for a 9x9 pan.

Yummy! I added some flour to the apple filling and more spices then it called for, and made the dough by adding milk a little at a time untill it was the right amount of moisture instead of just dumping it all in, but other then that, went as the recipe said and it came out wonderfully. I didn't add any glaze to the top, but did brush the top with some of the liquid from the apples before the end of baking and sprinkled with suger.

This was pretty yummy!  I actually thought it was a little bland at first, but the next day it tasted even better. I did like another reviewer did and instead of rolling out the dough, I just patted the dough in the bottom of the pan, layered the apples, then put the rest of the dough in pieces over the top. I also crushed some cornflakes and put them on top of the dough before putting the apples on, and I did the apples first and then let them sit while I made the dough, and poured the syrup that was in the apple bowl over the apples before putting the dough on top. I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar over the top (next time I will dab some butter on top as well) and into the oven it went! Definitely better warmed up the next day with some ice cream and caramel sauce!

I love apple pie so I thought I'd give this recipe a try. It wasnt bad, but I was disappointed. For all the work I put into this, I could have just baked an apple pie, and my applie pie recipe definately tastes a lot better than these pastries.

This is a really simple and delicious dish!  My kids loved it and I will make it again.  I made it just has directed.  Only thing I would say in the instructions is to place it in the pan like a pie crust with the bottom crust going up the sides.  I just laid it on the bottom and then realized I had to seal it to the top crust.  I had to dig for my edges.  It was still fantastic!  Thanks Nancy!

Would have given this ***** stars, but for the degree of difficulty rolling the crust (floured, chilled, & between wax paper) still had issues.  I added the cereal to the bottom crust and upped white sugar by 1/4 c.  (personal preference)  Even w/ my problems my guests were WOWED!  Will make in the future, but will use a large tart pan w/ removable bottom.  Thanks for another good apple recipe.

This is an excellent recipe, however adding 1/8 teaspoon of cream of tartar to the flour with the salt improves the texture of the crust.  We like more spice so I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg.  I used splenda instead of sugar and could not tell the difference.

The first time I made this I had a really hard time with the dough.  The second time I wrapped the very wet dough in wax  paper and refridgerated it for about an hour and it rolled out much better.  Also, make sure you use a crisp apple otherwise it tends to  be a little mushy. I also used an almond glaze on top.

You may never bake a round pie again!Not only is this delicious but you dont have to worry about the edges getting too dark as a round pie and it feeds more people.I was out of brown suger so I used all white but drizzled molasses and some honey before mixing apples.

Simply awesome!  Best apple dessert of the season.  I made the recipe as directed but portioned it into two pans to create thinner bars, then drizzled with glaze.  Amazing!

My apple bars turned out fabulious! I didn't have any granny smith apples, and just used a mix of apples that I had in my refrigerater. I was very impressed. The only think I added was a powder sugar glaze on top.

Excellent!.
My husband, the apple pie snob, raved about it and I'm having a hard time not having a second piece.
I used only 7 apples, because that's all I had and I kept the sugar and the spices the same, but I added two tablespoons of flour so I wouldn't be so runny and a quarter teaspoon of ground ginger, I also layered the top of the apples with chopped walnuts before adding the crust.
I personally didn't have any problems whatsoever with the crust, in fact, I find it easier to work with than the classic pie crust.
It also looks beautiful with the egg wash.
It's not really fall until you bake your first apple dessert, isn't it?.

This was a great recipe!!  I made it exactly as given.  The only thing I would change would be to add a little cornstarch to the apple mixture to thicken it up.  I will definately be making this again.

Absolutely the best apple dessert ever. The crust was really easy to work with, my daughter did most of it herself. Needless to say there were many holes which were easily mended. And when baked the crust was delectable, light and delicious. Better than most pie crusts I have ever tasted. The filling was also very delicious, I would recommend not using granny smith apples, as I did. They were a little too tart. Overall, I would Highly recommend this to anyone who loves really good apple pie without the hassle. Yummy!!!

Very tasty.  The crust was very flaky.  I don't know that I would call these bars though, but this is a very good alternative to apple pie.  My family loved it.

Very good.  As did others, I had trouble working with the dough. My solution is to roll it out a bit then smoosh half the dough into the bottom of the pan, add the filling, and then place the rest of the flattened dough in pieces on top. It leaves a lot of "cracks" but I choose to view it as a more "rustic" look.  Besides, this tastes so good, we're too busy gobbling it up to worry about how it looks!

Normally we have just a regular, round apple pie but it isn't enough for a larger crowd so I tried this recipe.  My family loves it; husband likes it better than my pie and my son called it 'to die for'.  Very good although you have to guess on how many apples and whether to thicken or not.  Turns out great no matter how you do it.  Thank you for a new keeper recipe!!!

I needed dessert for 100 people and made 7 full size cookie sheets. I cut and prepared apples and spices a day early, sprinkled with a bit of lemon juice, and packaged into 7 ziplock bags and stored in the fridge. Used Cortland apples--they were large so only needed 6 per sheet but could have used more if I wanted. They still browned a bit--didn't change the taste though. I rolled out the dough in a rectangle on waxed paper (another recommendation from here--it was much, much easier to assemble), dampening the wax paper underside so it didn't slip. I also sprinkled cornstarch on bottom crust before adding the apples, and added a touch of maple syrup. Served with homemade salted caramel sauce because Cortlands were fresh but not overly sweet. Lots of raves!

I agree with other reviewers: the pastry dough is certainly good, it resembles puff pastry without the trouble and bother. It deserves to be exported from this recipe and used in other pie recipes and is the reason of my 5 stars rating. That said, the apple/sugar/cinnamon part is easy enough and always the same as in countless apple pie recipes.

I just made this recipe and it's great. The only thing I did differently was cut the amount of apples only because I didn't have ten and just used what I had on hand which was about 5 or 6 Granny Smiths and then I sprinkled the top crust with sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon just for a little something extra. It's a cross between an apple pie and an apple turnover. Make sure you use a heavily floured surface to roll out the dough and if it sticks any, as you're rolling it onto your rolling pin for transfer to the baking dish, just use a pastry scraper to loosen from the counter.

I made this first following the recipe (except that I used butter in the crust), and it was good.  I made it a second time using blueberries instead of apples, and again, it was good!  I love the crust--it is so easy to handle even rolled thin for my 11x15 pan, though I did of course roll it out on waxed paper.  I wonder what I'll put in it next?

FABULOUS!!!  Perfect, thin and crisp pastry!  I made a 9x13 and an 8" cake plate since my mom always made this in a cookie sheet.  Its a little thinner then - more like a bar or streudal than pie.  I halved the sugar - it was very good for breakfast the next morning!

I've been on this site for a long time and this is the first time I had to rate a recipe. This recipe is excellent. Someone gave me a case of apples and I had to find something to do with them. This was a fantastic reciepe. My family and co-workers loved them. Thanks!!

So yummy! The dough is superior to any other. Also, it is very simple to make. I did not use shortening, but substituted I can't believe its not butter, and the results were marvelous. It was tricky to get the dough into the pan intact; I rolled the dough out on wax paper and this allowed a fairly smooth transfer.

Love pie and love bars.  So whats not to love here?  Did use half butter and half shortening for crust to maintain flakiness and boost flavor.  Also used fairly sweet winesap apples, so cut out the addition of the brown sugar. piped a simple glaze of powdered sugar and milk on top.  Made glaze fairly thick and piped it onto bars while still warm and in diagonal lines.  Maybe next time I'll add little pieces of butter to the filling and extra cinnamon for more flavor and instead of making glaze with milk, use a little vanilla and apple cider.  I like lots of flavor.  Very good!!

I really liked this, although I have a sweet tooth and would have liked more sugar.  The crust was delicious!  I'm definitely saving the crust recipe to use all the time (pies, quiches, etc).  It's funny that they are called "Danish Pastry Apple Bars."  All it is, in my mind, is Apple Pie, just baked in a casserole dish.  It tastes exactly like apple pie.  I added some golden raisins and walnuts, but I don't think they added much.  I'll stick to the recipe next time.  Next time, I'll do the same things, but just bake it in a pie dish.

I was a bit overzealous and purchased a 1/2 bushel of apples this recipe was great using half of that.  It's easy, tasty and basically 2 pies in one pan

I'm rating this 4 stars only because I found the crust difficult to work with.  I think the end result would have been better if I had been able to roll it thinner.  I think next time I will place the crust dough in the refrigerator for an hour before rolling out.  Despite the crust being a little thicker than I would have liked the end product was very tasty and looked beautiful.  I used 6 gala apples and that was plenty.

This has become a family favorite. I do a lot of baking and this crust, alone, is fabulous and has become my standard pie crust for any fruit pie. I use Granny Smith for all my apple recipes and have increased the white sugar here due to the tartness of the apples, otherwise, don't change a thing. Thanks, Nancy, for an excellent recipe!

Didn't have enough shortening so used some butter.   The crust was excellent but a little hard to work with, probably because of the butter.   I will make it again and make sure I stick to the recipe.

Very good!  Almost as good as the apple squares my Mom used to make us...boy I miss her making those.  I will add a bit more sugar to the apples the next time I make these.  I can see how other fruits would be great also.  The crust is very nice, I did substitute 3 T. of the shortening to butter for a richer flavor.  And to avoid runny apples, I added 2 t. cornstarch with the apples.

These are amazing, however, I have another version of this recipe that my family has used for approx. 30 years. If you sprinkle crushed cornflakes over the bottom layer of crust (under the apples) it soaks up a lot of juice. (It does not stay crunchy!) I use approx 8 -10 cups of apples, and I just sprinkle the sugar mixture liberally over the apples. I usually increase the amount of sugar. If the dough is too soggy, I add a small amount of flour until it is the right consistency. I am not an apple pie lover, but I LOVE these!

I love this recipe but I have found that the dough is easier to work with when you use the egg white in the dough instead and whip the egg yolk with a bit of milk and cover the crust to help it golden.

I wish it was as easy as the recipe. I completely agree with a previous reviewer, the dough is impossible to work with. I had to resort to roll it in the pan. No amount of additional flour helped. Way too much milk- and i didn't even put it all in. I've made homemade play dough that was easier to work with than this. Very disappointed

Everyone seems to love this recipe. The dough can be a bit sticky to manage so flour well. But this is a great way to use surplus apples!

I just made this for a family gathering. I used Truvia 75% White and their 75% Brown - Stevia Blends instead of straight sugars and it was wonderful. Many compliments on the crust as well. Will make many times and use the crust for lots of other items too.

Have had a hard time finding this recipe!  Years ago I made something similar. The crust is perfect..much richer than pie.  I added a bit more flour to make the dough easier to work with.  For the shortening I used 3/4 c butter and 1/4 c pork lard...perfect combination!  Doesn't get any better than that. So glad to have "apple squares" back in my recipes!

fantastic recipe.  I am a long time baker and pretty proficient.  I read all the reviews.  This dough was perfect and very easy to roll.   don't let the 1 star review factor in at all.  This is an easy to follow and results oriented recipe. Following the directions.  Don't downsize the pan.  tender.  You will never buy an apple bar from a bakery after these.  Make a glaze use confectionary sugar and freshly squeezed lemon juice to make these even further billowly.   I bake almost daily and these are a 10.

Excellent!! I didn't make Apple Bars, however, I used part of this recipe to make crust for an egg, cheese and veggie breakfast bar. Let me tell you... It was absolutely delicious. Also, this was my first time making a danish-like crust. This recipe was crazy simple and easy to follow, and most importantly, it taste great! Thank you!

This recipe tasted great. It was not overly sweet. I do not suggest adding sugar to the crust at all, but I do not prefer sweet things. The only problem I had was the amount of apples, and the amount of liquid that accompanied them. I'm definitely going to use this recipe again; however, I will add some cornstarch next time, and I will probably only use about six apples. Thanks for a quick, and easy treat!

I wowed the members of my meeting today when I brought in these bars.  Totally easy to make.  Did as a couple of others recommended - used my food processor for the pastry.  Added the egg/milk mix in quick pulses to avoid over-beating.  The dough was a little wet in parts but I just sprinkled extra flour on it - no big deal.  I rolled the dough out on waxed paper that I had laid over a glass cutting board. (Putting a splash of water between the board and the paper eliminates any shift while rolling out the pastry). When it was the right size/shape, I placed the baking tray (a jelly roll pan) over the pastry & flipped the whole lot (glass cutting board, pastry & bake tray) - just had to peel off the wax paper - really easy. I agree that the size of apple can vary hugely so why not just say "10 cups or about 10 apples".  In my case, I used large Honey Crisp and only needed 8 to give 10 c. I thought the amount of sugar called for was perfect. I cooked the apple mixture in a saucepan for about 10 minutes on low heat to soften them a bit. Baking time was right on.  Finally, after baking and cooling, I drizzled on an icing of Confectioners sugar & milk, just for presentation.  The taste of the apples really come through,I will be making this again for sure.  Thanks to poster Nancy.

yummy, my apples were super juicy so I baked a bit longer than called for which created a hard bottom crust.

I have made this exact recipe for years, except I do use half butter and half shortening.  I've always baked it in a jelly roll pan.  It is a little tricky rolling and stretching the dough to fit, but we like it this way and it makes more servings.

made this on Dec. 17, 2013  I have been looking for a recipe like this one.  My grandma used to make apple kuchen just like this.  I will drizzle some powder sugar frosting on the top.

I tried this recipe and LOVED it!
I am no brilliant baker or anything close but this apple dessert was DELISH and extremely easy to make! My whole family was over the moon with the results. They came back from vacation to this in the fridge and everyone thought it was store bought.

Don't understand why some had problems with this crust. It was by far the easiest I have ever worked with. Cannot wait for my husband to get home to see his treat tonight!

Love this recipe, REALLY love the pastry.  I'll use this crust recipe again and again for other fillings.  I used 1/2 shortening (for flakiness) and 1/2 butter (for flavor). Best of both worlds! Dough was a little wet, next time might use a little less of the liquid. Rolled out dough on floured waxed paper which makes it easier to lift and flip into the pan. I prefer recipes which measure fruit in cups, not whole. The size of your fruit can make a huge difference. Used about 7-8 apples (lost count). 1/2 Granny Smith (for tartness) and 1/2 Royal Gala (which fall apart a little and become creamy). Again, best of both worlds.  Reduced sugar to 1/4 cup of each (personal preference). Did not add any cornstarch and didn't need any - once cooled the juices thickened up on their own. Baked for about 60 minutes and glazed cooled pastry with icing sugar and milk glaze.  Not too sweet, not too sour, flaky crust, perfect amount of apples. Winner recipe!

I altered the recipe using peaches instead of apples. Since peaches are juicier than apples I added 2 TBSP corn starch with the sugars. The fruit squares were popular at our overed dish dinner at church.

I was in a hurry and didn't read the reviews, so I made it exactly as it is written.  That said, it is way too tart for my taste.  I used Granny Smith apples, and I should have used about 1/4 each more of sugars.  I will probably make a powdered sugar glaze to make it a little sweeter so my husband will eat it.   I didn't have a problem with it being runny, but my apples were pretty dry when I started.  It's pretty much about the same amount of work as regular apple pie, so I will probably just make apple pie next time.  It was good to try something new though.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wow. Can't count how many times I've made this recipe. My family loves it.  I use only butter, I add a 1/4 cup more brown sugar & almost double the apples, sliced very, very thin. Great Recipe. Thanks for sharing.

this recipe is perfect and easy.  I had to add a little more flour to the dough, but I think it was an error I made, and not the recipe.  Overall, definately a great recipe and very easy.

I can't do pastry well but this is the best.  It's like a pie you can cut like a cake.  The crust was great and my family loved it. Hands down it's the best.

If the recipe is followed as directed, it will turn out good!  It isn't real sweet, which is the way we like it, so if you want yours to be REALLY sweet, add more sugar.

I made a few small half pies by making circles out of the dough and then folding it in half around some of the filling. Turned our beautifully and taste great! came out short on dough and with lots of extra apple filling, so I cooked it with pork chops for dinner. Turned out better than inagineable!

I make these as cupcakes.  Sometimes I use cherrys and blueberries in place of apples and omit cinnamon, nutmeg, etc. They come out a little sloppy but still taste great.

Great recipe! Can use any time of the year, and great recipe for kids to help with- my 6yr old daughter loved making it and rolling on the dough!
