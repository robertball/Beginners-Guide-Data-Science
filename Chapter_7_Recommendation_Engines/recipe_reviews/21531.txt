Always dry the sago well on paper towels after soaking overnight & before cooking. I also like to add a potato and cover and cook it along with the chili and cumin.

We make sago khichdi without the coconut, but we add pieces of fried potato, sort of like mini french fries. Also we use mustard seeds and curry leaves instead of cumin and cilantro. Your recipe was good too. Liked the coconut, gave it a more fresh feel.
