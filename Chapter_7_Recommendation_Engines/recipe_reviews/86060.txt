It was good!  My kids liked it.  I made this super quickly by browning cubed raw chicken in a skillet and then pouring the sauce over it and simmering for 10 minutes.  Thank you!

I loved this recipe - easy and tasty but  I think the portion sizes are a bit optimistic. I'd say this was for 6/4 people depending on how hungry they are.

Sorry, this didn't work out for us.  I wish there were some way to get the flavor of the sauce to penetrate into the chicken, but as written, it's just a yummy sauce over dry, tasteless chicken.  Yes, the sauce is rich, and it's not a taste I'd like all the time, but if the flavor was in the chicken without all the heaviness smothered on top, and the chicken was moist, it'd be a a recipe I'd make again.

This tasted nice & was easy to make but the sauce was a little too rich for our liking.

This dish was GREAT!!
I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and doubled the sauce.
I thought it would be really sweet but it was just right! (and the sauce is good over rice too) :)

Even using no sugar apricot preserve and fat free sour cream, this was a bit too sweet for our liking.  It was very easy to make, but I doubt it will make the regular rotation.

When i told my family what was in the sauce they weren't to sure what to think. After they tasted it they were hooked. This is a great, quick recipe for a meal the whole family can enjoy. Not to sweet; not to bland...just right!

I do serve this with rice Pilaf whenever I cook it. Now the portion sizes are based on the regular food guide to what we should be eating but of course I always double the recipe because we love this so much that we eat bigger portions than the norm. I don't always like to have left overs  as I do not like how it tastes microwaved but my husband thinks it's great as leftovers.

This was awesome.  I used 2 legs and 2 thighs with the skin on and it was great.  And there was lots of sauce left over.    I can't wait to eat the leftovers.

I like that this recipe didn't require excessive amounts of sugar and salt like so many apricot chicken dishes that call for russian dressing and onion soup. The sour cream provides a nice creamy texture and the mustard a pleasant zip. But while I liked the idea of a dish that required no extra cooking vessels, I decided to brown the chicken in a skillet before baking. That allowed me (1) to lock in more of the moisture and (2) to increase the time the chicken spent baking in the sauce, infusing more flavor. I really enjoyed the result and plan to make it again. 

I rate the recipe as four stars based on potential for improvement to five.

Thanks for the great idea. I just ate my leftovers and look forward to making it again!

I altered the recipe based on my family's tastes and the other reviews. I cut 4 chicken breast halves into cubes and seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper. I put 1 tbsp of olive oil and 2 tbsp of butter in a skillet and melted. I browned the chicken in the skillet along with 1/2 of a chopped white onion. Once the chicken was cooked I added in the sauce. I doubled the recipe for the sauce because my family loves sauce and we always eat rice with our chicken. I cooked the chicken an additional 10 minutes in the sauce then tasted. After tasting I felt like it needed something so I added a tbsp of brown sugar and 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper. I served over rice with veggies. It was amazing!! I didn't think the sauce was too rich and the flavor was great! I won't be making it all the time because we have other recipes we like more but it's definitely something I will make again!

WOW !!!  If my husband can say "This isn't bad honey", this is a 10 in my books.  Before I added the chicken to the casserole dish I did think about browning it in a pan then letting everything simmer, BUT, instead I added olive oil to the dish before I put the chicken in.  Put a healthy addition of sea salt, pepper and seasoning to the chicken and just pressed on it.  The flavor just POPPED !!!  I am adding this recipe to my "to do again list".  Thank You so much for putting this in all recipes !!!!!

Great, easy recipe! Even though I followed the instructions to the letter I thought the finished product looked really bland so I drained a can of sugar-free apricots and sprinkled over the top then put it under the broiler for 5 minutes. Also we served it with whole wheat couscous and drizzled some of the sauce over it, making for a healthy, tasty, healthy and attractive dinner. Will definitely make this again with the changes noted.

I actually get requests for this dinner. It's so delicious! My husband gets excited when he sees me pull out the apricot preserves. I like to cut up the chicken into bite-size chunks, cook it on the stove, then add the sauce and let it simmer till warm. Then, I serve it over egg noodles. Yum!
