I used the already made polenta in a tube and sliced it up about 1/2 inch thick. Drizzled it with olive oil and dried basil and let it cook in the preheated over about 12 min, then added tomotoes/basil/cheese to the top and cooked until golden. YUMMY and easy. AND FAST. A keeper

I would substitute olive oil in for the butter next time.  It was very tasty with the butter, but I'd rather use EVOO.  It seems more appropriate with tomatoes and basil.  Also, I wouldn't add any salt, since the parmesan is salty enough.

I had a tube of polenta with basil and wanted to use it and tried this recipe.  Like most I tweaked it a bit, mostly due to what I had on hand.  I sliced the polenta and baked it, then added the tomatoes.  In the meantime while it was baking I sliced up an onion and fried it with olive oil.  I threw that on top of the polenta and tomatoes and added a splash of balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper.  It was pretty good!

Delicious! Quick to make, but still flavorful. I substituted an Italian cheese blend, because we're not too fond of plain parmesan.

I used dried basil and topped this with a can of drained chopped tomatoes and garlic because I didn't have any fresh on hand.  It was a delicious accompaniment to spicy meatloaf.  Next time I think I'll use additional cheeses.

This recipe is easy and delicious.  I know it has loads of calories but so good with fresh stewed tomatoes, basil and oregano,outof my garden in Alabama. I baked, them cooled, then served the sauce on top.

Delicious! I made my version with store bought polenta, tomatoes, basil and cheese just as the recipe, but used mushrooms we had on hand as well. Just added the mushrooms when I added the tomatoes. Yum. Went wonderfully with the sauted zucchinni and mushrooms we had as a side! We will be having this again!

Polenta....something new for us tonight.  I had two different polenta recipes that I wanted to try tonight, so I made a half batch of each.  This was nice and moist with crispy, chewy edges.  I liked the outside of this dish and DH liked the inside of the dish.  Other than halving the recipe, I made as written and will do so the next time.

Eh. Just okay for me. Really could have benefited from a little more moisture - perhaps a powerful sauce?

This was a different way for us to eat polenta, and we enjoyed it. I used all water in the polenta, that's the way my grandfather taught me (he was born in Italy.) Polenta is made with a 3 to 1 ratio of water to polenta. You can always add water, but you can't take it away is how I was taught. Butter is a must, and maybe a little more cheese (I use Asiago.)

I use a whole 9 oz box of instant polenta with 11/2 cups of half and half and 3 cups of water.  I use olive oil instead of butter and add 2 tsps. of dried basil when adding the Parmesan.  I put this in a 9x13 baking dish and follow the recipe except for using a liberal sprinkling of dried basil after salting the tomatoes.

This recipe is very good. The changes i made, as one other reviewer did, was to sub the parm for a blend of Italian cheeses.....I also diced up fresh garlic and marinated the tomatoes and basil with the garlic, in olive oil......served with a red sauce(not bought in a store) and it was very good.

This recipe was awesome!  I made a few tweaks by using half vegetable broth instead of all water to boil the polenta.  Also, in addition to the sliced tomatoes, I topped with thinly sliced red onions and probably used more than the recommended fresh basil.  And added just about 1/4 cup of shredded cheddar / mozzarella cheese to the shredded parmesan sprinkled on top for the last 10 minutes.  I served this as main dish with a green salad and it was a great combination.  Next time I'll dial down on the calories by trying low/no fat substitutes, but had to try it this way first.  Too yummy!

I made this recipe as is (except I diced the tomatoes and subbed chicken broth for water), and I really didn't like it. However, I think it has a lot of potential. Changes I would make: use maybe a half cup of heavy cream in place of 1/2 cup of milk, use chicken broth in place of water, dice the tomatoes, use more basil. Do not sprinkle the basil over the tomatoes, put it under. If you put it on top, the basil will get dry and crispy. Lastly, and most importantly, DO NOT stir the polenta/cornmeal right into the boiling liquid!!!! I did this part without thinking and the dish was extremely lumpy. You must whisk the polenta into the cold liquid, then bring to a boil. Whisk often as you heat it.

This always turns out good. Since my husband can’t eat too much tomato, I usually only place sliced tomatoes on half a side.

I had prepackaged polenta which I sliced and followed the rest of the recipe.  I added some crisp bacon.  It was good but not spectacular.  The Guys I work with certainly enjoyed it though :)

This is perfect for tomato season! Like others, I tweaked it a bit. Using the polenta in a tube I baked it with olive oil at 450 degrees for 20 minutes. Then covered it with chopped fresh yellow squash, diced tomatoes from the garden, green onions, black beans and covered with parmesan and mozzarella for 20-25 minutes. It was delicious. Also, I had run out of basil and substituted dried oregano.

I used red flint Floriani polenta. I have it already made up and can make single serving dishes this way. I added Manchego cheese instead of Parmesan and just melted it in the polenta and added the tomatoes, basil, and more cheese to my dish. And viola a very tasty and quick meal!

I made the recipe exactly as is and loved it!  I have tried the premade polenta in the tube before and did not like it, but thought I would give this a try and both myself and my roommate really liked it.  Fresh basil from the herb garden made it extra good.
