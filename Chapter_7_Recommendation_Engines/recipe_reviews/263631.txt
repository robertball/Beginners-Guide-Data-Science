OK, I'll admit it.   I have been all over the world, and I have honestly never heard of sausage made from seafood.  I like to challenge myself in the kitchen sometimes, and this recipe did not let me down.  I doubled this recipe the first time I made it, and was amazed at how it turned out - exactly like Chef John's video!  Amazing!

Holy . This was absolutely delicious. I had real reservations about making sausages from seafood. Falling apart in the water. Water leaking in, looks disgusting while making lol. Used salmon, cod, shrimp, and artificial crab. I can't say enough about this idea as recipe. Made way too much. Looking forward to leftovers.

I have to admit, I was skeptical about this.  This was a HUGE HIT!  Very different but absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe and it turned out perfect.  I honestly donâ€™t think I would change anything except maybe adding a few more spices.  Great change to the menu and will make again!

FANTASTIC recipe!  Made it exactly as written.  The flavor was wonderful, mild, not rich at all.  The texture was soft and almost melt in your mouth.  When he says don't wrap it to tight...don't.  I wrapped a few a little to tight and yes, they did explode.  They still were wonderful!

Easy to make and very tasty. The trouble I had was, though I followed the instructions regarding wrapping the sausages for poaching, they all bust out of the plastic and foil during the poaching process.  Nonetheless, they cooked through and browned nicely and were enjoyed by all the family.
