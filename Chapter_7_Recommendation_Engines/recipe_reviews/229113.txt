I was skeptical about the use of coconut milk in this recipe since I thought it would be a little heavy, but it added a nice rich mouth feel to the filling.  I will say that I did not use the 1/2 and 1/2, I used 2% milk because that it what I had on hand.  It worked perfectly.  I think that using the 1/2 and 1/2 would have made the filling too rich (if there is such a thing) because it was plenty rich as it was.  Also, for me, it works better to blend the cornstarch, sugar and salt together in the sauce pan, add the beaten eggs and incorporate them and then add the liquids a portion at a time.  This ensure that all the cornstarch and egg gets incorporated into a smooth mixture before you begin cooking it.  My tasters LOVED this recipe and I will be making it again.

This Coconut cream pie recipe is so delicious.  I did as the first review suggested and blended the cornstarch, sugar and salt together in a saucepan. Then I added the beaten eggs and gradually poured in the milk.  I did use 1/3 cup cornstarch and I used 2 and 1/2 cups of 2 % milk and only a 1/2 cup of half & half.  Those were the only changes  I made  from the original recipe.  My husband always loved his mother's coconut pie as we all did.  No one in his family had her recipe. My husband says this recipe comes close. He thought his Mom used fresh cream after they milked the cows and it was of course much richer.  Many thanks for sharing this goodness!

This was very easy to make, taste was good, but not great. Firmed up beautifully, was thick and creamy. I think the cornstarch gave it a slightly "off" taste. Made it exactly as written...Will make again, though with some slight preferential alterations.

I made this with a few changes.  Used only 1/3 cup cornstarch and mixed dry, then egg then added liquids. Took only a few minutes to thicken after bringing to boil slowly - bringing to boil is what takes the time. Its also important to stir almost constantly. Used 4 egg yolks in custard (no whole eggs) and used 4 egg whites for meringue. Only 4 tbsp sugar in meringue. Toasted the coconut before adding to the pie.  It is beautiful and the custard is perfect. Will make again for sure!

Excellent texture and taste!  For me it tasted like a combination of coconut and bananas!  One thing I would do different next time is begin whipping the eggs at the same time I begin stirring the custard because the eggs took 30 minutes to whip whereas the custard only took 15 minutes to cook.

I made this for a church meal today. WOW!! It was a hit. Had trouble finding coconut milk, so used Silk coconut milk with 1/2 1/2. I wanted to get 30 pieces, So I made this in an XL cake pan. I used refrigerated Pillsbury pie dough, customizing it to the pan  -- worked great. Meringue was more like a frosting, but was delicious.  I called it Coconut Pie in a Pan. It's a keeper.

Awesome recipe!  I used fat free half and half (yes, there is such a thing) and it made the custard just the right consistency. And I used 3 egg yolks since I would need 3 whites for the meringue. It didn't take nearly 30 mins to cook the custard but I won't argue with the cook because she shared a true winner of a recipe.

I made this for my Wife and she loved it. I also used 2% milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2. The only difference was I accidentally put 6 tablespoons of sugar in the filling. My wife and Kids said it made it sweeter. All in all a great recipe.

The addition of the coconut milk is wonderful imparting a great flavor!  I ended up using a combo of what I had on hand to total 3 cups of whole milk/half and half/coconut milk.  I'm sure any ratio would be great.  Also was short on corn starch so supplemented some tapioca flour, so added less still with a firm result.

I made this for a friend since they love coconut pie. I used 5% cream for the half and half. I heated up the coconut milk and cream in the microwave while I got the other ingredients ready, I used the 3 egg yolks from the meringue whites to not waste anything, my filling thickened in under 10 minutes with using the hot cream mixture and firmed up nicely upon cooling. The meringue is beautiful, an easy pie to make, the only thing I would do next time is add a tsp of coconut flavouring instead of vanilla to the filling as it was not very coconutty to me.

First time ever using coconut milk... I mean like ever. I was little put off by the smell. I don't like coconut, but my church members love it. This was my fourth attempt to make this pie
 trying three other recipes each time its a little too something or not enough something. I'm SO EXCIDE TO SAY THIS WAS A HUGE HIT. I got... this is just right from my aunt. I jump for joy. Right amount of sweetness and coconut flavoring. I will definitively be making this again. Thank you so much.

I made a chocolate ganache bottom for my pie, just used a lot more cream than usual to get the right consistency.  Rolled slivered almonds into the crust before blind baking it.  I used a whole can of coconut milk instead of just the 12 oz. the recipe called for.  Would definitely make again!

Very rich and creamy. I put my custard through a deuce to get out any small lumps of egg or cornstarch. Only change I wouldn't make next time is make more meringue. Maybe 5 egg whites instead of 3.

I cooked the filling in the microwave. I did one minute intervals times 3, stirring well after each minute. Then I did 30 second intervals several times, stirring well after each until it started thickening a lot. If it get a little clumpy, just whisk it. Then I did 15 second intervals stirring after each until it was nice and thick. I didn't have to stand over a hot stove and it turned out perfect

Yummy! I've made this several times and follow the recipe as it's written. It turns out quite coconutty and not too sweet. It does take longer than you expect for the custard to thicken.

I made this using coconut milk instead of regular milk due to milk allergies in the family.  I also toasted the coconut before adding it to the custard.  It was fabulous.  I would likely reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup next time due to the sweetness of the coconut milk.

I made this pie for the 7yr old daughter.  I didn't have any half and half, so I used equal parts heavy cream and 2% milk.  Turned out great and my daughter loved it.

"Excellent" says Sandra. My wife she said "just put the filling in a bowl, it doesn't need crust or topping". Made this for holidays last year and everyone wants more this year. Tip: Use extra large yard egg (whites) for mile high meringue.

Followed the directions to the letter, and even after a whole day in the fridge it was soupy.

This pie is awesome! I did make one change; I used 2 cups of coconut milk and 1 cup of 1/2 & 1/2 because I didn't want to waste the coconut milk. It's a keeper!

This is my first attempt at coconut cream pie.  This recipe was easy to prepare and the results were wonderful.  I entered my finished product in a pie baking contest (after being challenged by my big brother!) and tied for first place!  I made a second pie the next day and my family and friends LOVED it!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I rarely make pies, especially creme pies, but the hub begged for a homemade coconut creme. I found this recipe and followed it as per the recipe. My hub absolutely loved it as did I! This is very rich but sooo good! Hub rarely gets "possessive" of deserts I make but has claimed this pie belongs to him! LOL! Too bad! I still snuck in a piece! Definitely will keep this recipe!!

My family really loved this recipe. The custard didn't take anywhere near 30 min.to thicken. Overall it's a great and quick recipe. I will make it again soon. I topped it with whipped cream instead of the meringue (personal preference) and toasted some additional coconut in the oven to sprinkle on top of the whipped cream. Excellent recipe that my husband thinks can't be beat!
