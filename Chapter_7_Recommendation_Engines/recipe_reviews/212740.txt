Made this using homemade marinara sauce (a tomato sauce with seasonings and red wine) and ricotta instead of the Swiss cheese.  I cooked the lasagne covered, removing the foil during the last ten minutes of cooking and then browning the top under the broiler in order to develop a few crispy bits for texture contrast.  Flavour was bland and the matzoh mushy, although an acceptable lasagna substitute for use during Passover. When I it make again, I want to try including caramellized onion for a richer flavour and mushrooms to give one's teeth something to bite into.  Garlic and a layer of fresh leaf basil wouldn't hurt either. I'd also consider adding pine nuts for texture.  I think this recipe has potential, but needs further refinement in order to make it something really special.

I made it like regular lasagna.  I skipped the swiss and used ricotta, egg, and parsley.  Then mozzarella  and barilla tomato sauce.  I added sauted mushrooms and spinach.   Everyone had seconds and asked for the leftovers.
