After reading some of the other reviews/suggestions, here is my take. Basic soup was good, but I added more chopped garlic and roasted garlic seasoning to the broccoli. I noticed the flour/butter mixture did tend to clump a little, but I solved that by tossing it back in the blender with a drop or two of chicken stock and smoothing it down (and yes, being from south Louisiana, I do know how to make a roux!). Also, I used whole wheat flour just cause I like the extra "goose" of flavor and texture it gives a roux - one of my cooking tricks that I usually don't reveal :-). Finally, to add a little more body to the soup, I sauteed a handful of chopped mushrooms in butter, roasted garlic seasoning and another splash of chicken stock. After adding the sauteed mushrooms to the soup, I cooked it about 10 minutes more over a low heat and served that puppy up. The shrooms thickened it up just right, and I suspect it'll taste even better tomorrow after the flavors blend a little more. Bon appetit, y'all!

Very good tasting and easy soup to make.  The only thing I would do differently is only puree half of the broccoli and then chop the other half, it seemed to have too much grit in it with all of broccoli pureed'.

I thought the recipe was excellent with the combination of the broccoli and garlic.  YUM YUM!!The only problem I had preparing it was the fact that I think the recipe calls for too little butter with the amount of flour that the recipe uses.  It just turned into a big pasty mess.  I've made the recipe numerous times and I now add a touch more butter to it (adds a little fat to the recipe, but not enough to worry about) and it comes out perfect.  Also, it sounds like a strange combination, but I've also added chicken to it on occasion to make it a one-bowl dinner on those lazy days.  The best compliment I can think of to give this recipe is that my mother loved it.  And if you know my mother, she doesn't like anything!

Just made the soup and it was a breeze.  I checked out the other recipes and chose this because of the simplicity and the garlic.  That's the key to this soup.  I put a little extra in as well as a little more broccoli hoping to make it a little thicker.  It's not a thick soup but it is very tasty.  This will be a regular for me.

I never follow recipes as reads, so I used homemade ham stock, not chicken broth, & added a few handfulls of chuncked ham...mmmm good!! And, true to form for us, in goes chopped onions. Gotta have 'em! Don't be afraid to try new things, see what you have in your pantry & you will be suprised.

I really wanted to like this soup, but it was too thin.  I am used to a thicker cream of broccoli in restaraunts and was hoping this was something close.  There was not much flavor either, even after I added double the margarine/butter.  I did learn that making this soup was not that hard, so not a complete loss.

Wife loved it, I thought it was 'pretty good.'  Fairly easy to make once you get the consistency right...   Kinda lacked flavor... but a quick glance at the ingredient list could have tipped me off to that.  I added some cheese in my bowl and it helped.  Next time, probably just make broccoli cheese soup.

A bit involved with respect to preparation, but *very* tasty and smooth.  The chunks of broccoli give this dish some texture, while the pureed broccoli provides great flavour.  This receipe is now in our regular rotation!

I felt that this soup was a bit on the runny side.  I also think that next time, I would either roast or saute the garlic before adding it.. the end product was way to garlicky for my tastes.  But I love how healthy the recipe is.

Amazing! I didn't have broth so I used the water I steamed the broccoli with. So light and fresh: this is NOT the pudding like lump of fat & salt you get from a can or a restaurant. It's delicious! Can't wait to try it with asparagus too. ***tip*** Some have complained it's lumpy: make it like gravy. Once the flour/butter browns, SLOWLY add the milk/broth and whisk like crazy. I add  1/3 c. liquid at a time. Probably takes 4-5 min total. Never had lumpy gravy, sauce, or soup.

Yay! I made this soup in no time flat! Needs lots o salt to (my)taste. It's like a fool proof recipe-hey I made it AND it came out perty good. Will definitely make again and again. I had some heavy cream in the fridge and I figured I'd use it before it went bad so i added that -1/2 cup and 1cup-ish 2% milk, I didn't wanna use too much flour so I added cornstarch as a thickening agent as well(1tspn starch & 1 tspn cold water in small container- then to hot soup). This was low cost too which adds to it's appeal. Next time I will take another reviewers tip and make a nice lil meal out of this by adding shredder or diced chicken. yum-o!

I've already made it twice in one week, and made a third batch for my neighbor.  I had a little trouble getting the flour and margarine to a smooth paste, so I eliminated the margarine and dissolved the flour in 1/4 cup water.  I started heating the cup of chicken stock, then stirred in the flour mixture.  It reduced the calories a little and cut out most of the fat.  Everyone who has tried this soup loves it!

Absolutely delicious with a few little tweaks. I needed to use a bit more flour to thicken my soup and I also added a few more garlic cloves for flavor. I also chopped the remaining broccoli to make the soup smoother. This soup is a great low fat treat!

Snow and soup go hand in hand, but this soup is pretty good by itself. Granted, I gave the soup a flavour flourish by sauteeing the garlic with some mushrooms and onions - all of which was added to the food pro for pureeing. That's a small change with big results. I got an even bigger result when I added some thyme. Garnished with parmesan, it chased away the chills!

I usually don't add any salt to begin with just to see whether it needs it: this does need a little, but SO good and so filling! I pureed all of the broccoli in two batches: the first batch as described in the recipe and the rest to be added later. I will be making lots of this and freezing it in icecube trays to be warmed up for a quick lunch.

This recipe was awesome. It took no time to make, and I have an 8 month old on my heels at all times. I followed the recipe to a tee, except I added about 4oz. of 2% Cheddar Cheese before I added in the puree & chopped broccoli. It wasn't to cheesy. I will definitely be making this one again.

I love this soup! The best part is that because it's so low-cal, you can add different things to it to spice it up. I added a pound of boiled, shredded chicken to give me some protein one time. Another time I added Velveeta Light to make it a cheesey, creamy low-cal dinner. Amazing!!

I might try adding flour after poring chicken broth in becuase browining the flur with the butter in the beginning caused it to clump! Other than the few clumps it was great!

This is great soup, have made it several times in the past, then lost the recipe. I use whole milk or 2% and put pieces of steamed stem into the soup along with the pureed broccoli. If you know how to make a roux you shouldn't have lumps as another person said she had.  Great Soup

This soup was good, but not terrific. It was missing something. Next time, I would add cheese and maybe some sauted onion and red bell pepper. Just to add some flavor.

Fairly tasty soup and super easy to make. This is a great starter recipe, a good foundation upon which to experiment. One could swap out the broccoli with mushrooms or red bell peppers to make an equally tasty concoction. Thumbs up!

My wife loves cream of broccoli soup and was recently put on a low sodium diet. So I substituted low sodium broth and eliminated the salt. I used 2% milk instead of skim and a whole package of frozen brocolli. It was a hit! This will definitely become standard fare at my house.

This recipe turned out great, I added a few more cloves of garlic than called for and seasoned well with salt and pepper.  I also boiled a couple chicken breasts, sprinkled with salt & pepper, chopped it up in the food processor, and added it to the finished product.  It thickened up the soup nicely because I used a whole can of chicken soup in the recipe (didn't want to waste any), and it gave it a nice added flavor.

So-so, I even added 2% milk, garlic and more butter and the soup was still awfully bland...won't make again.

I found this recipe to be very good for a low fat recipe.  I love cream of broccoli soup and this is very satisfying. I will make this over and over again.

This soup was easy to make and tastes delicious.  I threw in a few cups of shredded cheddar cheese, but it's fine without the cheese.

This soup was...ok.  It's a little too garlicky I think, and overwhelms every other flavor in the soup--might need to be renamed to garlicky cream of broccoli soup...Also, not sure if this was my inexperience with cream soups (although I have made sauces with this same milk and flour base in the past) or the kind of margarine I used (Land O'Lakes Light), but the mixture of the flour and the melted butter never quite "thickened" for me.  It actually became clumpy and stayed that way, even after adding all the other ingredients.  I ended up having to fish out clumps of flour and butter...smashing them did no good, they just became pasty and regrouped into other clumps.  Doubt I'll be making this again (at least with this recipe).

This soup is so good!  There are no leftovers.  Next time I will double!  I will be making this again and again.
