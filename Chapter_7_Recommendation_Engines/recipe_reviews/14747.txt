Nice recipe! I prefer to replace ketchup with tomato paste, and hit it with a splash of vinegar if you find you need the acidity. 
By the way, on the strange feedback comment about this dish not being hungarian, I am from Hungary, and I can verify that not only are tomatoes extremely common in Hungarian food, "tons of paprika" do not appear in every dish. That would, frankly, be bizarre.
Tomatoes are called paradicsom -the same word as "paradise"

I thought this was very good, but I, as did others, tweaked it.  I used thick bone in pork chops, because they tend not to dry out.  I browned the pork chops, removed them and sauteed 1 carton of baby bella mushrooms and 1 medium onion, which I sliced thin.  I then added the pork chops again.  I used 1/2 cup cream, 8 oz sour cream, 1/2 good sherry (not cooking), 1/8 cup ketchup, 1/8 cup tomato paste, 1 TBS W-sauce, and 1/2 tsp hot paprika, 1/2 tsp salt. I let it simmer on low for 40 minutes and added 6 oz cooked egg noodle and let them soak up the sauce for 10 minutes.  It came out really well, and my husband raved.  I would have given in 5 stars, but I changed it too much!!

YUMMY!  First of all let me say that I heeded the warnings and used less ketchup, cooked it less time, and put the sour cream in at the last 5 minutes.  Also, I sauteed some onion and garlic with the pork chops, I used hot Hungarian paprika, and increased the amounts of worchestershire sauce.  This was excellent!  Contrary to others, this smelled great and I served it over egg noodles.  I will definitely make it again!  Thanks!

Alright I read all the reviews and heeded the warnings, halved the ketchup, used more w-c, used tomato paste, simmered for about 25 minutes, tons of Hungarian Paprika (I added garlic too), etc- and added my own- I used Wondra flour to coat the chops first. When my boyfriend and I sat down to eat- we thought the sauce tasty, the chops were cooked right and juicy- the only problem was that the chops themselves only tasted like lightly seasoned pork chops! None of that tasty sauce (which was still too ketchup-y, Definitely using some crushed tomatos and tomato paste next time) had managed to seep into the chops! My solution: Marinade! In a big plastic bag, pour a nice mixture of however you're gong to concoct your tomato base, w-c sauce, and the chops. Poke the chops a bit with a fork before adding them to the bag. Leave in fridge for a few hours to overnight and cook the next day. This resulted in juicy, flavorful chops that were complimented by the sauce rather than coated by it.

I didn't have Sherry, so I used cooking wine.  I used les ketchup like others suggested.  The taste was great, but the presentation was pretty bad.  All the breading came off the chops.  It still tasted great.  If I make this again I won't bread the chops!

We were wondering what to do with our chops one evening and this recipe answered that for us! They were wonderfully different than what we normally would do with chops, but not too different. 
The tangy sauce is perfect! We used a Manzilla sherry (0) and combined with the wooster booster (Worcestershire sauce) added just the right zing. 
A really good balance of flavors.

Delicious.  I cut back a bit on the ketchup, used dry vermouth instead of sherry,   heavy cream instead of sour cream (started cooking without looking carefully at what I had in the store cupboard), cooked it for about 30 minutes and it was great.  My husband said it was probably the best pork chop recipe he has eaten in ages

This is a delicious way to prepare chops.I used the advise of others and use half the ketchup. I also made a few other alterations. I add 1/4 cup more sour cream,a few more dashes of worcestershire, 1 Tbls of paprika,1 tsp of minced garlic and 1/4 tsp of onion powder,also I garnished with fresh chives. This recipe is a winner in our home. It was requested again already. I will try this recipe with chicken thighs next time!!

I sauteed some sliced onions and some fresh minced garlic in a few tablespoons of butter before adding the flour. I also used white wine instead of sherry--I made no other changes. I served this with buttered egg noodles and roasted broccoli. The family liked it, it was a quick and interesting new way to make pork chops. It kind of reminded me of the beginnings of stroganoff.

We did not like the flavors in this.  Maybe because I used cooking sherry instead of dry sherry.

I am not a huge fan of pork chops-mostly because I tend to dry them out when cooking, but not with this recipe. We really enjoyed them served over whole wheat egg noodles. Thanks for sharing.

Yummy! I used THICK (1 1/2") chops and would recommend chops no more than 3/4" so the flavor permeates. I didn't have sherry so I used white wine. I also added extra Worcestershire and paprika (used sweet Hungarian) and next time will add a little hot or possibly smoked paprika for a little more zip. My husband and daughter don't even like sour cream so the fact that they liked it is very telling! I served it with home made spaetzle. The smell while cooking is amazing.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe. The cream is rich, thick and flavorful. It would be great paired with some white wine. The one-hour cook time is too long. The thick, bone-in pork chops were a little overdone after 50 minutes. I think 35-40 minutes would have been right.

Substituted white wine for the sherry and salted to taste.  After browning both sides of the meat, I simmered for 20 minutes with the sauce. The meat was moist and the sauce was flavorful.  Family liked it.

These had great flavor! The only thing I changed was to use tomato sauce instead of ketchup (personal preference) and of course I used Hungarian paprika. I didn't measure anything, just approximated and the flavors were still well balanced. I didn't need to cook this for an hour, it only took about 30-40 minutes. Served over egg noodles. Mmmmm....

I served this last night for dinner.  It was fabulous.  The only change I made was, I didn't have any ketchup in the house, so I used barbeque sauce.  My daughter-in-law is from a small town in Hungary, I asked her if this was close to real Hungarian food.  She said pretty close.  The only thing she would add to it is a little bit of garlic.  Great recipe.

This turned out great! It was a hit at my house. Doubled up the paprika because i used sweet paprika...also mixed ketchup with fresh tomatoe sauce. I used fresh cream instead of sour cream which is difficult to find in Mexico. All in all it was a grand hit. I served them over spaetzle (german noodles).

Good, the family liked it, but I was a little annoyed that the breading didn't stick well after the simmering of the sauce.  I also did not cook for an hour, in fact my sauce started to dry out/thicken too much so I add some extra water. I will probably make it again, but maybe not with the breading as it seemed to be a waste of time.

This was the most tender pork I've had in a long time. Didn't care much for the sauce though. Used tomato paste instead of ketchup and it gave the sauce a strong tomato taste. I also added the sour cream when the recipe called for it instead of waiting until the end, and it kind of curdled. I think I may make this again sometime with some changes.

My kitchen was somewhat unequipped for this recipe, but I went ahead and made it with a lot of substitutions. Bear that in mind when reading my suggestions, because they may be the result of my swapping ingredients.

More paprika would definitely be good, and I also ended up making extra sauce and still having it cook down a little too much. I'd keep an eye on the sauce as you simmer.
Onions and mushrooms are a great addition, as other reviewers have said. I will definitely put in a lot more onions next time. Cooking them a bit, then simmering them in the sauce gives them a great flavor and adds a lot to the pork.

All in all, a very good recipe that I think will be great as I tinker around with it some more.

I made this tonight for my picky boyfriend. I didn't think he'd like it but he agreed to try and it was really good! He even wanted seconds! I used 1/8 ketchup like people suggested and extra worcestershire sauce, also added a little bit of onion powder and minced garlic. I dipped the pork chops in eggs then flour to see if it would stay on better, but a lot of it still came off while cooking, but I think it was still worth having in the dish. Definitely EXTRA paprika, although I am Hungarian and love the stuff :) I'm just learning how to cook, and this was the first time I actually cooked meat outside of a George Foreman, so I'm pretty amazed at how easy it was and how great it turned out and am definitely more confident to cook more! Excellent recipe! Will definitely use again :)

DELICIOUS!  Pork chops were very juicy and the sauce was SPECTACULAR!  I think I will be trying the sauce on other items as well.

This was a tasty recipe. I served the pork chops over rice with green beans and blistered cherry tomatoes on the side. I used the full amount of ketchup and found it to be OK.

Delicious, very easy recipe.  I thought it was a wonderful variation for pork.  Rich and zesty...yep, that's a pretty accurate description.  And nothing's better than when the house smells so delicious while it's cooking.

Delicious!  I was only cooking for 2, but I didn't decrease the sauce ingredients.  Should have, though, or should have served with rice or pasta.  I forgot the bay leaf, but that didn't seem to make any difference.  Will definitely go into my rotation.  Thanks!

I didn't have any sherry, so I omitted it from the recipe, but followed everything else. The pork chops were the most tender I've ever had and extremely tasty.

I used reduced fat sour cream when I made these.  They turned out great.  They were creamy and delicious and the chops were soooo tender!   The sauce started out thin but thickened up while cooking and was great over some rice.   We did not have any leftovers from this recipe!  :)

I fixed this for supper tonight.  Really tasty.  I think next time I would add a real small can of tomato sauce and cut the ketchup back to 2T.  I didn't taste ketcupy but it did have too much sweetness for my liking.  I also added 1/4t. onion powder and 1/4t.  garlic powder.  I would definately fix this again

I subbed 2 % Greek yogurt for the sour cream, white wine for the sherry, sherry for the Worcestershire sauce (i'm out and the roads are ice) and rice flour for all purpose flour to make it GF.

I followed Ilovetocook's advise and made those changes, except I didn't use the hot paprika and I  substituted Marsala for the sherry. I liked this recipe and would gladly make it again.

I only gave this recipe 4 stars as I have mixed feelings about this recipe.  I followed the original recipe, even though I was leary of adding the sour cream at the beginning of simmering, and it turned out well (no curdling). I served it with homemade Amish egg noodles. While my husband and I liked it and ate it all in one sitting we both agreed it was not something we would want again.  I think there was some flavor that was "off" in the sauce to our tastes, but can't figure out what it was exactly. Perhaps if I had substitled some tomato paste for the ketchup and sauteed some onions and/or mushrooms as suggested by others we may have liked it better.  Still it was a good recipe, easy to fix with readily available ingredients.

We like this and I make it occasionally. I like the fact it uses things I have usually have on hand.  One thing I do differently is first I saute some sliced onions, removing them before I brown the pork chops.  Then return them with the sauce.  I also add some garlic along with the sauce.

I was somewhat dubious about cooking sour cream so long, but the gravy was delicious.  Next time I think I'll braise it with broth and then add the sour cream.

This recipe is delicious. My 10-year-old daughter put it together with only minimal help from me. I tasted it when it was done and it was really good. Then it kept simmering while we took down the Christmas tree, and by the time we ate it, it was even better!

Wonderful, Quick and Easy. I did a couple changes based on what I had in stock. I doubled the sauce and used a whole can of tomato sauce instead of the ketchup. I skipped the paprika cause I had none and I used red wine. I also seasoned the flour with salt and pepper and italian spices before I dragged the meat through it. Really good, my whole family liked it.

I do something very similar to this but I do water, ketchup, brown sugar, worcesteshire sauce and beef boullion. Then I add the sour cream and a ton of minced onion. It is so good!

Absolutely Delicious! I was out of Sherry and used 1/4 water seasoned with 2t chicken base & 1t mushroom base, garlic and a dash of red pepper flakes.  It was the best pork chops we've ever had!

I make this recipe regularly, the family loves it. I follow the recipe as it is, but cut the simmer time down to a half hour, an hour is just too long. I serve with egg noodles and seasoned green beans.

This recipe was very tasty with changes from others (less cooking time, adding onions, more worcestershire and more regular plus hot paprika, and adding the sour cream at the end). My change was to use concentrated tomato paste half and half with the ketchup. Maybe a little thyme would be good, too.

I used less ketchup, white wine, and much more paprika and the taste of this dish was excellent, however the appearance was not as good.  I think it might be a good idea to put the chops into some egg yolk before dipping into flour because as soon as I cooked it, the breading came off in clean chunks, so the end result looked like meat with chunky orangy stuff (and you can use your imagination to picture what that looks like on a plate).  Good taste, horrible presentation.

I thought this recipe was a nice change from the way I normally fix pork chops.  The smell was fabulous and as it cooked, I had a glass of sherry.  I served it over wide noodles with a green salad on the side.  Thanks Christine!

This is Hungarian only if you have no idea about Hungarian cooking... anything Hungarian would have tons and tons of paprika, and probably nothing tomato based.  However this was tasty enough, if a bit too sweet with the ketchup.

This was great!  I'll admit, I was scared, the ingredient list did NOT look appetizing.  But it tasted absolutely delicious, it was easy and had a nice flavor but was not too overpowering.  I will definitely make this again.

This sounded so good so my husband and I made sure we had everything on hand a couple weeks in advance.  Unfortunately, the flavors didn't blend together very well even though we prepared it to the recipe specifications.  One bite was heavy in ketchup, the next heavy in worcestshire.  I do not recommend this recipe, and will not be making it again.

Very good and very easy.  Pork was juicy, tender, and had just a hint of spice to keep the creamy flavor interesting.  A keeper!

easy and quick dish.

Ho my gosh.  I substituted greek yogurt for the sour cream, went easy on the ketchup, and added a bunch of Tabasco to the sauce... and wow.  This is my new favorite way to eat pork.

I made this tonight for my husband whose normally does not like cream sauces.  Even though it does not look good, the dish was delicious and will make it again.

I made this dish exactly by the recipe and was very disappointed with the results. When I tasted the gravy about halfway through cooking, it was too sour... perhaps too much sherry, along with the vinegar in the ketchup. So I added about 1/2 cup more of sour cream, but that didn't improve the taste. It was rather bland and still sour. I added a little rosemary because I thought it needed some kind of herb other than the bay leaf, as well as salt and pepper, a pinch of garlic and a little more paprika.
Still not very good. I strongly urge others not to waste good pork chops on this recipe!

I used half tomato sauce and half ketchup, tripled the worcestershire and paprika, no problem browning the chops dipped just in the flour, also no problem here adding the sour cream along with the other ingredients.  I think the trick is to make sure the heat is on low.  The pork chops turned out very tender and flavorful, we served over egg noodles.  Also browned some onion and garlic along with the chops, seemed to help enhance the other flavors.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't have any bay leaf, so I added a bit of dill because I thought it needed an herb.  I also added more paprika than the recipe called for.  I had 2" thick boneless pork chops so I needed to turn them during the cooking time so the sauce would coat them.  I also used the leftover sauce to put on my egg noodles.  Very tasty!

I agree that the cooking time is way too long.  I browned the pork chops with some onion which was good and only cooked it covered about 30 minutes.  And, even though I cooked this on very low heat, the sour cream sauce looked like it was separating.  I wasn't that crazy about the taste so I don't think I would make this again, but if I did, I would put the sour cream in right before serving.

It was OK, but not my favorite. I followed the recipe exactly and served over rice. I think I may have overcooked the chops and would recommend reducing the cooking time to about 40 minutes.

After reading the reviews, I used half tomato paste / half ketchup in the sauce. The flavour of the ketchup was still quite overpowering. However I served the sauce with pork sausages instead of chops and it worked really well.

This was a good way to have pork chops.  I did follow others and made a few changes. I seasoned the porkchops, dredged in flour, then dipped in egg, and repeated with the flour before browning.  I also simmered the porkchops for only 30mins.  Aside from that there where no other changes.  It is a dish worth trying and very simple.  I will make again adding sauteed onion and garlic as suggested.

The sauce wasn't that good, until I added some cheyenne pepper to it.  So I suggest tasting to see if you like, others do, and if you don't, add some cheyenne pepper.  The sauce will be wonderful if you do.

I was a little worried about how this was going to turn out, it didn't smell very appetizing while it was cooking and it also didn't look very appetizing. Other than shortening the cook time to about 30 minutes (after browning) I didn't change a thing and it turned out really very good. Hubby really enjoyed these too but the kids weren't too crazy about them (I think thats mainly because they didn't like the way they looked).Will make again but probably wouldn't serve to guests as it's not very appealing to the eye or nose. Served with baked potatoes with sour cream and chives and corn. Was a very good quick and easy meal!

My family loved this recipe.  My husband is Hungarian, so I always try to spoil him up, making dishes his family made.  He'd never had this actual dish before, but enjoyed.  He's extremely picky, so I got me another winner.  Thanks for a new pork recipe!

Liked this a lot but I think the cook time is way too long.  I cooked for about 35-40 minutes and it was still too long.  I followed the directions but added 1 tsp of hot hungarian paprika along with 1/4 tsp. sweet paprika to give it a little kick.  The sauce was so good.  Served it with Homemade Wonderful Bread from this site and served over German spaetzle.  We thought it smelled wonderful as it was cooking.  Will definetly make again.  Thanks Christine

These were not good.  They tasted like ketchup pork chops.  I might use this concept to make a sauce with no ketchup and at least a tablespoon of paprika.

it was too sweet for us and that was even with cutting back on the ketchup.  Also, I'm not sure why the person is calling this Hungarian Pork chops.  my In-Laws are Hungarian--like born and raised there--and mother-in-law never made anything like this.  Went to several different relatives places for meals and pork was rarely served....maybe this is a 'newer' dish in Hungary.  Also, that is not much paprika for a Hungarian dish.  I'd say this is more of a Russian dish (or Ukraine etc).  JMO
