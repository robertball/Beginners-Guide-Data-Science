My husband and I LOVED this. I added about a cup of halved grapes, and might reduce the dill slightly for next time but otherwise it was completely delicious!

Thank you for not having fruit in the recipe. When are people going to realize that in a real chicken, grapes have no place.

I looked over many recipes and this one was the one I decided on!  I wanted a basic chicken salad recipe without fruit but not bland.  The onion and celery give it the crunch, the mustard and spices the flavor, and the sweet relish and bit of sugar the sweetness it needs.  I did not use pecans, lemon juice, dill, or paprika because I did not have them, but it had plenty of flavor without!   I used 2 large cans of chicken breast which made this recipe quick and simple!  Next time I have leftover chicken I will use it!  This in my opinion is the best basic chicken salad recipe!

I thought this was a fresh, basic chicken salad. Really good! I didn't have any relish so I was worried about that. But I think that's why it had a simple flavor and I kinda liked that for a change. Also, I used onion powder in place of the onion and did half sour cream and mayo for that part. I really enjoyed the pecans and the texture that brought. Great recipe!

I did that whole paleo thing where you make 5 pounds of shredded chicken to use the whole week... I needed a way to use ALL of that chicken ;)!

I did not have pecans or a lemon. I chopped a dill pickle, didn't have relish either. 

Husband said it was the best chicken salad he has ever had. Kids liked it... So happy there was no fruit in it. 

I do plan to make it again as written, but it was fantastic with the ingredients I had on hand.

Very good. Poached the chicken with 1 bay leaf, a few pieces of whole black pepper, and one crushed garlic clove, about 12 mins. Chopped very fine. Omitted relish, out of sugar so omitted sugar as well. Squeezed the juice of one lemon wedge. Only used about 1 tsp of black pepper. Added hot paprika. Refrigerated overnight.

This recipe is very good but I will probably cut the ground pepper in half next time.  It really overpowered the sandwich.  Otherwise, it was delicious and I will definitely make again!

Excellent flavors. Not a paprika fan so hardly put any of that in . I recommend tasting it before you add any sugar. I found the sweetness of the relish was enough and so I didn't have to add any sugar.  Will definitely make this again. Oh yeah, my husband hates pepper so I just threw a tiny bit of that in.

This is the best chicken salad I’ve ever made... and I make a lot of it!  I get rotisserie chickens every time I go to Costco .... didn’t have pecans but otherwise made exactly as stated. Some of the ingredient may sound like they could be omitted but believe me, they are what makes this so delicious

Wow, this actually has become My Favorite Chicken Salad!  I have been hankering for a good chicken salad sandwich and browsing the many recipes and this one stood out, it is easy to make and I also halved the recipe and it worked out great.  Thanks SunnyDays Nora!

This is a very flavorful chicken salad. I made it close to the recipe except added a little more fresh lemon juice. I measured out the 2 med to large boneless breast cut up, and it was 3 cups. Will make it again soon. Delicious!

This was so delicious, but the amount of pepper it calls for is way too high. Cut it in half and it's perfect!

Absolutely awesome! I was afraid of too much pepper and dill, so I cut them back to 1 tsp, LOVED IT.

Update: I swapped out chicken for 1 can drained, rinsed, and partially smashed chickpeas for vegetarian option...still DELICIOUS!

Very tasty chicken salad! I halved the recipe (as I had 1 leftover chicken breast from a Costco rotisserie), used red onion, and dried dill (I think fresh would have been better, but I didn't have any). I had this for lunch on toast the first day, and had it on crackers the next. Would definitely make this again! Thanks Nora!

This is probably the best chicken salad I've ever had.  I used leftover BBQ chicken breasts, removed the skin and cut the meat into cubes.  Served it on toasted seeded bread - it was amazing.  I highly recommend.

Didn't have sweet relish, so I diced some dill pickles and added an extra pinch of sugar. No nuts, either. This chicken salad was amazing! I love the crunch and classic taste.

Hard to believe that just 1 1/2 tbs. of relish and the tiniest bit of sugar would take this chicken salad to a heavenly realm. Didn't have pecans, but recipe was still sublime.  His is my forever chicken salad.

I left out the pecans, celery and sugar, but this was still a really good chicken salad.  I also substituted lemon pepper for lemon juice and cut the mayo (miracle whip) by a 1/3.  I'll be using this recipe again.  Healthy and tasty.

First I thought this was complex for a simple chicken salad recipe but it taste pretty good. I cut back on the sugar, pepper, dill, and mustard, used onion powder and almonds and added grapes. I thought I had messed up with the mustard because of high yellow tint. I’m use to a nice creamy white color. I would recommend this recipe and will fix again. (Maybe omit the mustard)

I made it just like it called for other than using dried dill instead of fresh and adding some chopped dill pickles - about 1/4 cup (we like more veggies).  Will do this again!

This was deeelicious.  I didn't have a lemon so used lime.  And used my green tomato pickle in place of relish. Did not add salt. Had to add more mayo because too dry.

This is delicious! I didn't have pecans and we have one who doesn't like celery, but I think it would have been even better with both of those. Thanks for sharing.

This made a great alternative to the curry/fruit chicken salad I usually make. Doubled the recipe except for the dill and pepper and stuffed in puff pastry shells for a party. Big hit and everyone thought I bought them somewhere.

This is delicious! I omitted the pecans (personal preference) and used left over grilled chicken breasts from last night’s dinner. I tasted it right away and loved it without even letting the flavors blend in the refrigerator. One of my new favorites!

We loved it. Followed the recipe but cut back on the pepper as other reviewers mentioned and my grocery store did not have fresh dill so I used dried. Perfect just the way it is, but if you like grapes, they would be an addition that would easily blend in to the flavors. Thanks for the great, super easy - make the night before - recipe.

This has to be my favorite chicken salad recipe I’ve tried so far. I used one large, drained can of diced chicken breast (approx 1 cup) & halved other ingredients. Didn’t change anything else. Will definitely be making again.

Ran out of fresh dill so I used dried but still really great. Also left out the pecans since my husband doesn't like nuts in his salads. I used homemade avocado oil mayo.
A lot of flavor going on. No bread needed. We served with bread or lettuce and it was great just by itself, with maybe a bit of fresh tomato and a bit of dijon mustard.

I am making this weekly now! I don’t use the dill and I think I go a little light on the onions and celery. I also am a little liberal with the mayo. It’s a huge hit in my family and recently took it to a baby shower and everyone was raving and asking for the recipe. ????

Great recipe! Even though I omitted a few ingredients  (pecans, pickle relish, dill, paprika) and substituted others (purple onion, red grapes) it turned out delicious! This is our new favorite chicken salad, thanks for sharing!

This is a good base recipe. Plenty of flavor. I omitted the sugar, onions, and pecans (didn’t have any on hand). Even the kids that don’t usually eat chicken salad enjoyed it. I put chicken breast in the crockpot with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and dill the day before. It added a deep flavor into the chicken. I also added sour cream instead of just using mayonnaise, which makes a major difference. Will definitely use this recipe again. Thank you.

This is my absolute favorite chicken salad recipe! I’ve been using it for years. It’s great with smoked chicken(my fav), or even leftover rotisserie or oven roasted chicken. Be careful with the salt depending on how your chicken was cooked. I only use 1/4 tsp at most, and only about 1 tsp of pepper. I like to sub slivered almonds for the pecans sometimes, and to really put the salad over the top, sub sweet chow chow in place of the sweet pickle relish.

I made this vegan by using Tofurky "chicken" and Veganaise. I kept everything else the same and omitted the pecans due to nut allergy.   DH and I both liked it a lot.  Thanks!

Great base recipe, and it's easy to add or delete to your own family's taste.  This is a keeper and wonderful go to recipe for luncheons. I served it to family and friends and they all raved about it.I didn't really change thins much, just added a couple tablespoons of sour cream.  Enjoy!

My BF was less than thrilled when I said we were having chicken salad for dinner, but one bite and his tune totally changed.  I served it on a bed of baby greens drizzled with a bit of honey mustard dressing, but it would be great in a pita.   I left out the pecans and reduced the salt  (personal preference).

I left out pecans. I decreased black pepper and dill to 1/2 teaspoon each. I also made a marinade from lemon juice, pepper, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, celery seed, paprika, dill, and 3 tablespoons butter. Rub it onto chicken breasts and bake covered 1 hour at 350 and 1 1/2 hours at 225. Chop chicken and proceed with recipe. I also substituted green onion for the yellow onion.

I read a number of recipes before I made this one. I was worried that my husband wouldn’t like it as he doesn’t like trying anything new. I was very happy that he really enjoyed it! Very flavourful and an excellent way to use up leftover roast chicken.  I didn’t put in the pecans but I will next time.  I will definitely make this again!

We really enjoyed this chicken salad. I used a rotisserie chicken,  halved the black pepper and used dijon mustard. I didn't have any sweet relish on had so I just used about 1/4-1/2 c of chopped up grapes and I omitted the celery because my family just doesn't like it in salads. I also substituted pecans for almonds since that is what I had in the house. Came out delicious!!!

We loved it, I gave it 4 stars because I switched it up a bit. I did switch it up a bit and I used a dill yellow mustard instead of the fresh dill.  I also added halved green grapes. Gave it just a little sweetness.

Would have gave it a 5 but the garlic was a little much for my taste. Will make it again minus the garlic.

This is AMAZING!   Love chicken salad and this is great.   Used sliced almonds instead of pecans because both my daughters are allergic and is still blew my family's mind.   Total keeper!!!

This is my favorite now. What a wonderful, flavorful chicken salad. I made it without pecans (didn't have any) and because I had a limited amount of roasted chicken I eyeballed most of the ingredients. Delish. I didn't add the sugar after tasting, but put a bit more relish which worked beautifully. This will be added to my rotation especially since summer is here, even tho the calendar say May 2nd (88 degrees)  :-)

I will definitely make this super salad again.  Right now the salad is in the refrigerator for the final step of 1 hour if I can even wait that long.  This is my kind of salad, fruit and all.   No changes here.

Sandwich type salads are a staple for us, and I love trying new ones. This one was good. I used leftover turkey breast instead of chicken. The only change I made to the dressing was that I just sprinkled in some salt and pepper--I thought the amounts called for seemed too much for us. Also, I had to use almonds instead of pecans, but that worked fine. Thanks for a tasty lunch!

Great recipe.  I used rabbit meat instead of chicken.  I also added a few capers and olives.  I didn't add pecans to the entire salad, I just added to each serving.  My wife doesn't eat wild game, but she admitted that it was very tasty.  I will make it again.

Great recipe. I used a large portion of what I had left from a slow cooked whole skinless chicken (about 2-1/2#). I followed the recipe as best I could base on the amount of chicken I had. The end result was very good but I have to say it was a raving success when I added small fresh apple chips to the recipe. The freshness/sweetness and crunch of the apple chips complemented the other spices in the recipe. Can’t go wrong with this one!

No dill, mustard(don't eat) or pecans on hand. This recipe was ok, but I think I will omit the salt next time, at least maybe by half.

This is now my favorite chicken salad, too! I prepare my chicken breast using the Baked Split Chicken Breast recipe by Prospective PhD  on this site, substituting dill for the basil that is called for. The only other change I made was to use spicy brown mustard and omit the fresh dill and sugar from this recipe. I made it in big batches for lunches while on a keto diet, absolutely delicious!! Thank you for the recipe!

I've made this many times and everyone loves it.  Like some others,  I only use a grinding of fresh black pepper, but add ¼ teaspoon of Hot Hungarian paprika,  This gives it a little zip and works with the black pepper for flavor.  For a special treat, I cut down the mayo a bit, but add a couple of TBS of cream fraiche. 
Wonderful!

I really didn't care for this - I'm not one who necessarily needs something like fruit in my chicken salad, but between the granulated garlic, the mustard and the paprika, this one went just to far to the savory side for my taste - I'll not be making this one again - C

Loved it!  I made it mostly as written.  The only difference is I didn't use the sweet relish like suggested.  I don't like sweet relish and didn't have any.  So, I poured some dill pickle juice in.  Just a tablespoon or two.  It was delicious and disappeared so fast, I made it again a few days later.  It was great on a croissant or on crackers.  Heck...it was good on a fork too!  :)

I omitted the pecans, onions and instead of dill, I used dill relish, instead of celery I used celery seed. It was a big hit with my 4 very picky kids. They loved it! I know, I know... everyone hates when people change recipes and then rate them, myself included and I usually don't but I felt like this one was just too good not to rate and review! And besides, the only reason I left the ingredients out is bcuz I didn't have them on hand. I will definitely add them next go round ??.

This is the best chickensalad I've  ever made!  I took it to a football party and served it with Hawaiian sweet bread. It was gone before the first quarter was over.   I will save and use this recipe again!

By far the best tasting chicken salad I've tried. I cut the pepper but that's all. Fantastic!

The best chicken salad ever.  I cut recipe in half, because it was just for me.  I didn't have sweet pickle relish, so I used dill pickle relish, eliminated the dill.  I had no lemon juice and used walnuts instead of pecans.

Followed this recipe almost exactly. I baked the chicken and seasoned it with Paprika, garlic powder, and pepper. Replaced about 1/3 of the 1/2 cup of mayo with greek yogurt. Turned out delicious! The relish really makes it. I doubled the recipe and brought on vacation for my family to eat on the beach.

Perfect, thank you! Dry dill...no fresh.  Walnuts...no pecans. Awesome, adding to my list of favorites.

I used one less piece of celery (husband's preference).  I liked the sauce.  Next time, to add a bit of sweetness, I will add a tiny bit of chopped apple to it.

I made a vegetarian version using Morningstar Farm chicken strips, vegan mayo and didn't add sugar.  It was mustardy and savory.  Definitely will make it again.

I used slivered almonds because that is what I had on hand. I will also say I was very please grapes were not called for, grapes do not belong in chicken salad, at best they should only be used to garnish. Anyway, this is a very delicious chicken salad I will most defiantly be making this again.

I enjoyed this chicken salad. I baked the chicken the night before and seasoned it with a generic poultry seasoning mix. The next night I chopped everything up and mixed it. we packed it for lunches the next day. It had a heavy onion smell that my family didn't care for, but my husband and teenage daughter enjoyed the taste. My teenage son did not try it.

This is a great chicken salad. I,however, like my chicken shredded but that doesn't take away the melding of the spices. Thanks for a keeper.

I cooked the chicken in my crock-pot, which made this even easier.  With great flavor and texture, I will definitely make again!
