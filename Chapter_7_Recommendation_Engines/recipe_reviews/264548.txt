It was very tasty! I have been making regular oatmeal for my husband for years to help with his cholesterol levels and heart health so this was a welcome change to his menu! Adding the flax seed meal and other healthy ingredients was an added bonus. Super simple too!

Followed directions cooked overnight  and we really,liked it. It was much creamer than when done on the stove top. My husband isnâ€™t crazy about the blueberries so when I make it again I wil Use 3 mashed bananas & add a tablespooon  Of brown sugar. It was really good! Also added some chopped walnuts.
