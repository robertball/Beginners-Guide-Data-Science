Wow- okay, I'm the child of a chef, have been to the very finest restaurants and am very cautious about making a new recipe for guests without giving it a test drive with the family BUT... this was the hit of my party. Don't be afraid to try it especially with all the ingredients that don't seem like they would be appealing together.  ENJOY!

I got this recipe from my mom 40 years ago - served over rice it tastes just like stuffed cabbage!  You can substitute a jar of grape jelly for the cranberry sauce, use whole-berry cranberry sauce, etc.  My only real change is to use a pinch to 2 tbsp. brown sugar if any - 1/2 cup is way too much because of all the sugar in the cranberry sauce!

I was not to sure about trying this recipe since I hate sauerkraut but I thought I would give it a try.  We LOVED it.  I took it to a potluck and I brought none home (too bad).  We will be using this recipe a lot and it is worth trying.

I think I may be the only 3 star rating thus far, but I'm sorry I wasn't that impressed with these meatballs.  The sauce is a very very mild "sweet and sour" but you really have to "taste" for the sour.  As other reviewers noted, it is very sweet.  So to the reviewer with the picky eater husband who complained they were too sweet, he was right on.  I really wanted something with more kick.  I should have tried one of the recipes with the chili sauce.  I brought this to a potluck last night and brought home more than half the meatballs, so that should explain itself.  I'll keep looking for a better recipe.

I tried these out on my picky family, and I must say, the pickiest of them all now calls this her favorite dish!  She gets so excited when I tell her we are having this for dinner!  I serve it on top of white rice, with spring rolls and sauteed stir fry veggies on the side!  A total hit and totally easy for this working and VERY busy Mom!

Easy and excellent! Everyone loved these at my holiday party--my 10 year old daughter to friends who are great cooks.  I think I used too much tomato sauce, but it was still good.  I bought frozen meatballs, let them defrost a little bit and then browned on medium heat first for ten minutes while I made the sauce.  I was running short on time, so I put the slow cooker on high for about 90 minutes and as soon as the sauce had a fairly smooth consistency and the meatballs were cooked all the way, I turned it to low for the rest of the night.  For vegetarians, they do make seitan "meat"balls (which I made a seperate batch of on the stove), but I think you would be better off with "meatless" sausage links with this sauce if you have to go vegetarian.

This was such a bizarre combo of ingredients that I figured it HAD to be good - and it sure was!! The flavor of the sauce is sort of like pickled red cabbage.  I used homemade turkey meatballs.  This was really delicious.  My husband did not like it though (hence the 4 stars instead of 5), he thought it was too sweet (but he's a very picky eater!).

TASTE AWESOME. I have a 3qt slow cooker I believe (its pretty small).  1bag meatballs (2lb), 1 jar pasta sauce(ragu 6cheese flavor), 1can bravarian sauerkraut(rinsed), 1 can whole jellied cranberries, half cup brown sugar. Set it on low overnight and BAM. These taste sweeter than normal meatballs, very good combination of flavors!******update***made this again, followed recipe exactly, served over pasta AWESOME

This reminded my husband and I of a sweet/sour soup and meatball dishes served at a restaurant in the southern suburbs of Chicago called Scott's Prime Rib.  This was really delicious and I will definitely be making again and for family functions too.  It was so easy!  I used 3 boxes of homestyle meatballs (box said 15 in each - on sale $2/box) and held to the recipe exactly.  Put the frozen meatballs in the crockpot with all ingredients.  I actually had them in for about 6 hours and they were absolutely delicious - didn't fall apart or burn.  Made enough for dinner for couple nights for us and other half going to Mom's.  5 stars for ease of making and taste!  I had on sandwiches but dh said definitely w/mashies next time.

I've tried a lot of recipes for meatballs in my day even my own but these are by far the absolute best I've ever tasted.  My Italian husband gives them a 5 star too! Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these for Christmas Eve dinner tonight.  I got many compliments and requests for the recipe.  I didn't change the recipe at all.  They are delicious and I will make them many more times, I'm sure!

These meatballs are so delicious!  I made them for a Holiday buffet type dinner, and everyone commented on how good they were.  We had a little bit left over, and ate those the next day over some brown rice - tasted even better the next day!  I've been craving them lately, and will be making them again soon.   Thanks!

made this for an office potluck lunch...people were 'stealing' them before the lunch even started...many raves from coworkers.  Will definitely make again.  Used cheap frozen meatballs and store brand kraut/cranberry/spaghettie sauce and it was great. Don't like sauerkraut at all - but I loved these!

While these tasted delicious.. they seemed really fatty and unhealthy.  Kind of like how McDonald's tastes good, but I don't eat it.  I'll probably never make these again.

This recipe sounds strange, but I was convinced by other reviewers to make it.  I made this a few years ago for the Super Bowl, and it was demolished before half-time.  It has become a yearly staple.

This is by far the best meatball recipe and it deserves 10 stars! I made this for a group of men and one guy must have ate 25 meatballs!  We ended up calling him "Meatball Man".  This is a keeper!

We loved these meatballs, as did everyone at the church potluck where I served them. Two women sought me out for the recipe, one of them is 92 yrs. old and said they were the most delicious thing she'd ever eaten!  The only thing I changed was to use frozen turkey meatballs.  I microwaved them (3 mins. at a time for 10 meatballs) and threw them in the crockpot.  I would bet this recipe would also be very good layered with some kind of pasta or noodles too.

I Found this recipy a few years ago and had forgotten to write a review.  Let me tell you I have used this so much for get togethers.  Everyone loves them and are suprised to find out the ingredients but that dosent stop them from having seconds or thirds.

The reviews got me on this and I had to try it because my husband enjoy sweet/sour even if I do not.  My family did not enjoy this at all.  The sweet/sour was so significant it was hard to eat without making that "tart" face.  We won't be making this again.  Thanks anyway.

This recipe is AMAZING!!! Don't be afraid of the ingredients, it all turns out mouth watering.  I have made this dish for MANY occassions, and each time it's a hit!  We use store bought frozen Italian style meatballs when saving time - Fantastic!  People always ask me for the recipe, and are so surprised with just how simple it really is.

I too was turned off by the unusual mix of ingredients - but WOW!  these were good.  My Christmas Eve crew gobbled them up and wanted the recipe.  I'm making them again for New Year's Eve. Try them - you won't be disappointed.

OUTSTANDING!!  I have made this on several occasions and have gotten raves each and every time.  I myself am not a huge fan of kraut but my husband is so I compramised.  I used almost a whole can of  Bavarian kraut and a pinch of regular.  Bavarian is milder and sweeter.  thanks for the great recipe!!

You have to try these.  I took them to a gathering and people devoured them. I made them because they sounded different. I'm tired of the same cocktail meatballs with the same sauce.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were a hit.  My son likes this for supper. I'm making these for the Super Bowl this year.

A strange sounding combo but this was a major hit and tasted great. With leeway to make your favorite meatball recipe and your own red sauce if you like, you can really customize this one. My meatballs were 1/2 pork, 1/2 beef (75/25% fat) with some panko & parm breading, browned in an iron skillet in butter.

OMG I made a double batch and went to a pot luck.  The meatballs where gone in 10 minutes.  I saw the people at the pot luck 2 weeks later and they are still talking about my meatballs.  They are great served as a meatball sandwich as well.

Oh my goodness, these are addicting! They are so yummy! Very easy to whip up. I've made them several times and they're always a hit. For those of you that are turned off by seeing sauerkraut in the recipe, DON'T be. It's all a fabulous blend.

This is seriously the most disgusting sounding, but very tasty recipe I've ever made.  My friends wanted to toss me on the porch as I was preparing it (the smell is horrifying) but once it was done, I brought it to the gathering and everyone loved it, asked for the recipe, etc.  Very very very wierd recipe that turns out to be very good!

We absolutely LOVED this recipe. I served the meatballs on hoagie rolls sprinkled with mozzarella cheese. It made a great meatball sub. The unusual ingredient combination made for an excellant sweet yet tangy sauce. My husband's exact quote was "You can make these anytime!"

Awesome! The ingredients do seem weird but the taste is unbelievable and so simple to make. I filled up my crock pot and served them when we had guests over. Everyone loved them. We had plenty left over only but for a couple of days since we couldn't stop eating them.

5 friends and myself were testing recipes for sweet and sour meatballs.  This one came in second..but it was close.  They came out on the sweet side. We all agreed that the sauce would be fantastic on spareribs.

I too thought that with this unusual mix of ingredients this recipe had to be good to take to a potluck at work and I was not disappointed--they were wonderful!  Only change I made was to use the whole jar of spaghetti sauce the first time I made them because the mixture seemed "dry" to me when I mixed it up (maybe I used too many meatballs).  Made the recipe again the following week and used the whole jar of the next larger size of spaghetti sauce and loved this consistency even better!  A definite keeper!!

I must admit i was leery at first about trying these....but they were delicious ...they have a very distinct flavor...i think these meatballs will double as a delicious yet different pasta topping...the only changes i made was adding about a teaspoon of garlic salt and pepper and i also added red pepper flakes for some heat....i really enjoyed this recipe

I honestly thought my review would be like the others, "oh these were fabulous", but on the contrary. I made these for my sons 1st birthday party- and I still regret it!!! The sauce doesn't go with meatballs AT ALL!! I wish I would have just made the easy sweet meatballs instead of trying to impress people with something new. I love trying new foods, new recipes, and I love everything- so this was surprising. I will never make this again!

This sounds like a pretty strange mix of ingredients, but everything ends up mixing together perfectly. I've made this recipe for several potlucks and I always get rave reviews...and come home with an empty crock pot.  I made it once for a family get together and my sister now insists that I make them whever she is up to visit.  I've even had people who swear that they don't like saurkraut try this recipe and end up loving it.  It is definatley one of my go to recipes now.

Made this today as it looked interesting and I was not disappointed.  I am not a fan of sauerkraut, but this recipe is wonderful.  I made my own meatballs, and spiced them up with finely chopped onions, salt and garlic powder (could probably have used more spices).  Fried them lightly before adding to slow cooker.

I was very disappointed with this recipe though.  It may have been operator error.  But Thanksgiving is not the day for a so-so result.  

I will try this again, as direct, but instead of meatballs I will use sausage.  Simply throwing in meatballs with this recipe does not work.

Absolutely wonderful flavor.  I made my own meatballs spiced the way I like them and cooked them on top of the stove.  After the meatballs were browned and cooked through, I added the sauce, prepared as written and simmered for about 5 minutes.  This sauce would be excellent with smoked sausage slices or just about any meat.  Really good, thank you.

These really dont seem like they will taste good when you are making them and see all the strange things that go into it but these really are great! I made them for my daughter's birthday party and they were a hit. You really can't taste the sourkraut and it makes the sauce thicker. I will make these many more times!!

Very easy and super yummy. Not "gourmet" tasting but PERFECT for a party/potluck. Everyone loved them. I think I'll use more saurkraut next time just because I love it.

This is THE BEST sweet and sour meatball recipe ever! I was a skeptic at first, especially while blending the ingredients, it just smelled so nasty! But in the end it is just the tastiest dish I've made so far from AllRecipes.com! I used lean ground turkey and threw a bunch of spices in to make the meatballs, added the weird mixture of canned goods and VIOLA! Perfect! Make this dish, your family will thank you!

Made this for my husband's "guys night" potluck. Here are a few things I did
Doubled the recipe
Added hot sauce 
Ended up having to put the meatballs & sauce on the stovetop, due to after 4 hours the meatballs were still raw in the middle. cooked them on medium heat (brought to boil- then reduced) for 30 mins & returned to the crock-pot
I didn't care for the smell these made.
The men ate them up, so go figure.

I followed the recipe to a t, but I didn’t think it had the contrast of sweet and sour I thought it would have.  Anyway, I wont be making this again.  My friends said that they didn’t care for them, even though every last meatball was eaten.

I too, was a little put off by the different mixture of ingredients, but I decided to try it, and I'm glad I did! This is wonderful, and Joy is right, addicting! I also added kilebasa sausage to the recipe.  It was enough for me and hubby to have leftovers.  I ate it all through the next day as I couldn't stay out of it and was really mad when hubby stole the last of it to take to work!  This has become a favorite for us! YUM! Thanks Joy!

I added bread crumbs and an egg to the ground meat and browned it in a little vegetable oil before putting adding the other ingredients. Next time I am going to cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup because it was a little sweet and substitute a can of whole berry cranberry sauce instead of the jellied cranberry sauce.

Delicious!  I used frozen meatballs and followed the recipe exactly.  It wasn't too sweet for us using the 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Husband and stepson liked it too.  I served it with rice and an asian veggie mix.

This recipe was AWESOME.  I made my own meatballs using stale bread, breadcrumbs, eggs, onion/garlic powders, salt/pepper, and diced onions.  I fried them until browned and then added them to the crockpot with the remaining ingredients.  I used a whole can of sauerkraut, a whole can of jellied cranberry sauce, 8 oz. of BASIC tomato sauce and a can of diced tomatoes w/sweet onion.  I eyed the brown sugar, and added a bit more about 2hrs into the cooking process after tasting.  I served it over buttered Jasmine rice.   I love putting hot sauce on this recipe, so if you like it, try it on this for sure!!! This is a recipe that reminds me of the tastes of my grandparents cooking.  Give it a try!

I was a little skeptical of trying this recepie to serve at my party, I usually stick to what I know is a hit, but I'm so glad I did! Everyone loved it! I served the little I had left to my family for dinner (picky eaters) they all loved it as well. This one is going in my favorite page...

I made this for co-workers (we have a group that alternately provides a crockpot lunch on Mondays). I made my meatballs (turkey) from scratch, using a dense multi-seeded bread for breadcrumbs,egg and a handful of 'craisins'- then microwaved them in batches. The only changes I made to the recipe was to substitute Splenda Brown Sugar for the reg.brn sugar as we are all doing the 'biggest loser challenge' at work. The jar sauce I used had carmelized onions and roasted garlic in it. The comments from the 'crew' were 'Awesome!', 'to die for...', 'f--- wonderful'(from a woman who we rarely hear swear), and 'oh my God! this is great!!!'. One person came by my desk and said, "definitely 5 forks!" ... enough said? My husband even had enough left for our dinner that night. He loved it, too... need I say more?

Sorry, I was so excited to have these for the game after reading the majority of reviews.  After the watching the first few people have a taste and "ewww", I pulled the whole thing from the table.  To be honest I felt the same upon first taste but hoped it was just me; turned out not to be so.

This recipe is Awesome!!! You would never think these ingredients would blend together 
I made it twice.
First time I followed receipe exactly. Found it a too sweet. Next time I decrease brown sugar to 1/3 & added more spagetti sauce 32oz. This made plenty of sauce for the pasta as well.
I made this for the super bowl. I keep forgetting to take pics. Will try for next time.

These were the best freaking meatballs my mom and I have ever had. I think about them all the time still. It also made me do a 180 with sauerkraut. I love the stuff now.

I made this when my sister visited over the weekend.  It was ok and we all found it to be on the sweet side. If its made again I think more kraut or maybe some lemon juice or apple sider might give it more sour taste, but not really sure if it will be made again.

Wish the sauce was thicker.  Was watery after the meatballs were fully cooked.  Sauce was also bland tasting.

I followed the recipe exactly and family loved it.  I admit, I was a little unnerved by the ingredients (I swear by chili sauce and grape jelly) but was pleasantly surprised.  Will definitely make again.

Made these over the holiday, exactly to the recipe. They were good, but a little too sweet, and I couldn’t taste much sour — and I used really sour sauerkraut! Next time maybe less sugar, as others have noted. Tried serving over rice, but I think they’re better just as an appetizer/snack.

Really liked it but cut back on the brown sugar as suggested. Recipe forgets to mention that the meatballs have to be cooked, either homemade or store bought. Still don't know if the sauerkraut should be drained before putting in the Crockpot. First time, had to add some tomato sauce because it seemed there wasn't enough sauce. Second time, no problem. I suspect this sauce could be put on top of anything, not just meatballs.

I made these using 1/2 ground pork (New Years Day!) and 1/2 ground turkey. They are fantastic. I cut back on the red pepper flakes because I am a wienee when it comes to intense spicy seasoning, but I still got some heat. Will definitely make again.

I made this recipe exactly as written except I used the whole jar of spaghetti sauce. I cooked in crockpot on high for a couple hours and low a couple hours. Delicious and a crowd pleaser at a NYE party. Leftovers very good warmed up the next day for lunch. Will make this again.

My family loved this recipe. Cooked it in my instant pot on the slow cook setting for 3 hours. 1 hour on normal temperature  and 2 hours on highest temperature. Used my instant pot just as if it were a crockpot! Came out delicious!

I only used 3 tablespoons of brown sugar based on others’ recommendations and they were plenty sweet. Very easy!  We made meatball sandwiches with the leftovers.

I made this recipe the evening before for my family for Christmas, as others advised it tasted better the next day (which was the perfect suggestion). 
I changed the recipe a bit with turkey meatballs, added additional sauerkraut, an additional can of cranberry sauce + a bag of fresh cranberries (along with a little more brown sugar crumbled on top of the fresh cranberries).  It was an absolute hit with my German/ Italian family! We had it over rice the first night, and over mashed potatoes the second. It was wonderful!

I have been making this for years with a little change. Instead of using spaghetti sauce, I used a jar of chili sauce and then fill that jar with water and add it. I also make my own meatballs. I don’t cook them first. I just place them raw in a pan and pour the cooked sauce over them. Then I bake them for 1 hour covered and 1 hour uncovered at 350. This recipe sounds so strange but I can tell you it’s AMAZING. No one can tell there is sauerkraut in it!

I do a great deal of cooking....this was GREAT!!!  I would suggest doubling the sauce recipe since I also fixed rice to go with this in case someone wanted more.  I'd rather have too much sauce than not enough.   Everyone went face down in this and asked me to do it again!!!   In case you run out of CRANBERRY...use Smuckers Red Plum jelly and skip the brown sugar...not as good, but a good back plan!

This is one of our favorites and we make it a lot. It sounds like a strange combination of ingredients, but they all blend so well together. We have also made it with turkey meatballs and it was just as delicious.

Use 2 TBSP brown sugar instead of 1/4 cup. Use 16 oz. of marinara sauce.
