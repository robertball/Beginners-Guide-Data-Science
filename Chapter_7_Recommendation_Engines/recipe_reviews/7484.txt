I remember this version of the tunnel of fudge cake recipe from years ago. It is fabulous and was the winner of the Pillsbury twenty five thousand dollar bake off back in the late sixtys or early seventys. The problem is I haven't been able to find the frosting mix and I understand that the original one made by Pillsbury is no longer available because all the frostings come in cans now. But no other recipe that I've tried for the tunnel of fudge cake compares to this one!

This is hands down the best chocolate cake ever! Mom used to make a version very close to this for decades. Since she passed and I can't find her recipe book this is the next best thing. Thanks!

I tried this recipe again and added 1/2 package of chocolate instant pudding.  I also reduced the heat by 25 degrees because I have a Bundt pan with a dark lining.  The first cake I made was really good but this cake was AMAZING!  You can't use canned frosting!  You have to order Jiffy frosting mixes from Amazon and use 2 boxes per recipe.  When you do this you will see why this recipe won so much money!

Why does everyone on this website absolutely rave about every recipe on here?  I made this recipe exactly as stated. It was edible but I won't make it again. It's much more like an OK brownie with a semi cooked middle.

You do have to use a dry mix (not canned frosting) with this exact recipe, and you can't scrimp on the nuts, I understand.  To be truthful, I haven't actually made this yet, but there is no other way to leave a comment!  I just wanted to say, King Arthur makes a chocolate frosting mix that can be purchased online.  I've had it, meaning to try it in this recipe.  After reading glowing reviews of the frosting mix, I intend to make it for the next special occasion.  I'll edit my rating if necessary, but hoping not!  :-)

When I made this, I left out the walnuts and lessened the sugar to a little under 1 cup. For the frosting, I used a dark chocolate frosting, so I thought it'd be sting enough. I'm not sure what made the chocolate flavor not come out in the final product, but next time I make this, I'll use the right amount of sugar and add some cocoa powder as well. Also, be sure that your eggs are up to room temp. I used mine right out of the fridge and it curdled the butter and made the batter look nasty and hard to work with :P other than my own mistakes, this is a great cake recipe: it's dense and chewy and not too too dry, but I'd recommend having this with vanilla (or chocolate) ice cream or some other type of topping. Used a chocolate coating instead of frosting, and it was great, but use frosting if possible.

I did use canned frosting as a "package" of frosting was no where to be found. Not sure if the fudge part that settled to the bottom was supposed to be the tunnel. This wasn't that fudgey or chocolaty, it was just ok. Good to know though that if you don't have chocolate in the house and you might have canned frosting that you can make a dessert with it.
