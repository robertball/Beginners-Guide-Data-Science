These were fantastic, but NOT moist!  First, you do not need to dip the fork in sugar when you press these cookies flat.  They are sweet enough!  Don't press the cookies flat if you don't like thin & crispy cookies.  Leave them in little balls for thicker and more chewy cookies. Finally, I added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts to the batter and then divided it into 3 bowls.  In one, I added 1/3 cup of raisins, in another, 1/3 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, and in the last one, I added 1/4 cup of dried cranberries and 1/4 cup of shredded coconut.  They needed a full 10 minutes to bake and they were all DELICIOUS!!!

This recipe makes a great cookie! You can tailor it to your liking: take them out a bit early for softer cookies, or bake them a little longer for a crisp cookie. I divided the dough and added raisins to one batch; chocolate chips to the second; and Craisins & white chocolate to the third, which were absolutely delicious! Of course, they were great without adding anything. I did reduce the cinnamon to 1 tsp and added 1/2 tsp ground cloves which gave them an even better taste. Also, I didn't grease the pan, chill the dough, or flatten w/fork and they turned out just fine. Try it for yourself!

Wow!  I loved these cookies and they were super easy to make.  I used Splenda instead of sugar.  WW flour in place pf white flour and added raisins.  I also took the advice of another eviewer and left them round instead of flattening them with a fork and the came out round, soft and perfect.  I will make these again and again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

True to their name, these cookies were quite soft, and tasty too!  I didn't find it necessary to refrigerate the dough, and rolling it into balls was too time-consuming.  I just made your basic drop cookies using a spoon.  I also tried flattening some using a fork dipped in sugar, but it really didn't make a difference.  In my opinion, you can just skip that step.  I will definitely make these again!!

These were great! the first time i made oatmeal cookies and a total success. i chose this recipe cos it said 'soft', which is what i wanted and they really are - lovely and moist, chewy and with v.good oatmeal flavour. changed a few things - added 1 1/2 cups raisins, so cut white sugar to 2/3 cup so they wouldn't be overly sweet. next time might try cutting to 1/2 cup cos i dont think the cookies need the extra sugar. also used margarine instead of butter. unfortunately realised that i didn't have enough cinnamon (only about 1 small teaspoon!) so next time i'll make sure i have the right amount. found this dough really easy to work with. had to knead the raisins in by hand cos it was too thick to stir, but that was ok. after chilling it rolled really easily into balls without being sticky! i baked the cookies on parchment paper, and made 30. baked for 8 minutes - they come out looking way too doughy, but give them 5 minutes and they firm up to perfection! tip - i found that these cookies do not spread and flatten much by themselves, so i'd advise anyone to flatten the balls a lot before putting them in the oven. i'll be making these again and again!! :)

This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe I've had yet.  I can't put my finger on what separates this one from the rest, but the ingredients are the perfect combination for a great tasting cookie.  Crispy on the edges and soft and chewy in the middle, with a perfect blend of spices.  I can't wait to try them with raisins and various flavors of chips (chocolate, butterscotch, and cinnamon).  Thanks for a great recipe.

The perfect oatmeal cookie. No rocket science here--simple to mix, simple to bake, great results. Bake longer for chewier, shorter time for softer cookies, add nuts or raisins if you like or just as is. Nice oatmeal flavor with just a hint of cinnamon and not overshadowed by a ton of spices. Just that simple.

After reading other reviews I subtracted 1/2 cup of sugar, and I was sorry I did.  They were still delicious, but next time I will use the full amount of sugar.  The cookies even stayed soft for 4 days (that's when everyone finished them). Excellent recipe!!!

Outrageously delicious! I cut the amount of oats to 2 cups to make them more chewy and thin + some chocolate chips for the Mrs. She doesn't usually have a sweet tooth for cookies 'n cakes, but these - I had to fight vigorously to get my share!

This has become a new favorite in our home! One of the only recipes I've ever tried that truly lives up to the soft cookie name. The flavor is just right, the cookie melts in your mouth, and they are easy to make.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These are very good.  I made a few personal changes, but the original comes out awesome.  I saw a few reviews mentioning that these came out dry.  One thing I've learned about oatmeal cookies is that they are done when the edges are golden brown.  Yes, you're going to touch the middle with your finger and say to yourself, "no, they need to go back in the oven".  Wrong.  The center will seem to be undercooked, but they are done.  If you don't believe me, at least take one out earlier than you think it's ready.  Let them cool for a little bit and they'll be chewy and awesome as they should be.  I make them with a 3oz scoop and flatten them -- that size takes almost exactly 8 minutes at 375°F.  What to do with the cookies you left in past when I said to pull them out?  If you like milk or coffee, you can always dunk them!

fantastic! This is the perfect oatmeal cookie base. I have made these twice this week! First time I halved the recipe and added semi-sweet chocolate chips. Last night I halved it and added SunMaid dried fruit bits. I also substituted Smart Balance light spread for butter and it is still the best oatmeal cookies ever. As for making the cookies uniform in shape, I simply pressed these little babies into patties like I would a mini hamburger. They came out perfectly chewy yet cooked throughout.

UPDATE: The third time I made these, I replaced the butter with peanut butter. AMAZING! So good.

So Good!! I made a few changes to make it healthier and it turned out well. I used 1 1/2 stick of butter and 2 tbs of unsweetened apple sauce, 1 egg and 2 egg whites, and I used 1 c whole wheat flour and 1 c all purpose. They were super good and had to force myself to stop eating them. I have found my new oatmeal cookie recipe!!

Best oatmeal cookie recipe! I made two batches so far - one plain and one with white chocolate and dried cranberries. My oven required more than the 8-10 minutes for baking - 12 minutes was just right. I didn't have quick oats and used Old Fashioned Quaker Oats and it came out fine. At first I followed the advice of one of the reviews to only use 2 cups of Old Fashioned Oats but thought the dough was not oatmeal-ey enough so I ended up using the full three cups.  Also, I reduced the cinnamon to only one teaspoon and added a dash of ground clove and nutmeg. The only down side is that we can't stop eating them!

Just finished making these and WOW, they really are amazing...I wanted to find a recipe that used what I already had at home and so the amount of oats I had on hand was only 2 1/2 cups, but they still turned out great.  Also, I read a tip awhile back that said you can sub old fashioned oats for quick cooking anytime, just keep in mind the product will be a little more chewy...so I used old fashioned and they turned out great.  I thought I'd pass that tip along to other novice cooks like myself.

Easy, good but not the best recipe for raisin-less oatmeal cookies.  I'll try these again sometime and see if I just didn't get it right the first time.  It might be the cinnamon, but we usually love cinnamon. Also way too salty.  Thanks for the recipe.

These are excellent oatmeal cookies -- very soft and moist, with the right balance of oats to flour. The only change I made (and will make again) is to take the white sugar down to 1/2 cup. I have a huge sweet tooth, and these were plenty sweet -- even with the reduction in sugar. A definite keeper of a cookie recipe. Thanks!

These cookies are great!  Unfortunately I had to stray from the recipe just a bit due to an egg allergy (toddler).  I used an egg sub (1 banana mashed with 1 tsp of baking powder for the 2 eggs) and baked them for just under 8 minutes.  My little guy LOVED these!  The banana didn't overwhelm the oatmeal taste either.  Great cookie, thanks so much Barbara!

The title says it all!  This is an amazing recipe and the cookies came out moist, soft and chewy. I used a small ice cream scoop to make all the cookies the same size. Be sure to chill the dough before baking. It didn't seem to matter if you flattened the cookies. I tried both ways and all of them came out perfect. I did make one change. I rolled the cookies in sugar before going on to the cookie sheet (I've done that with other oatmeal cookies) and it made them even better!! 5-stars all the way!! I baked all the batches for 8 minutes then pulled them out (they still looked a little doughy) and let them sit on the cookie sheet for 2-3 minutes then let them cool on a wire rack.  We can't put them down!!!

These were great!  I gave 4 stars because I altered.  I added 2tsp. Vanilla, and doubled the cinnamon.  First batch I made too large and they "ran" everywhere, so I made smaller walnut sized balls and they came out PERFECT! Also don't bother with the sugar and fork mess...unless you like flat cookies...  These are soft & chewy.  This is a keeper!  Also PERFECT with this *cream filling: 1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened  1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar  1 cup marshmallow creme  1 teaspoon vanilla extract   *from the Cream-filled chocolate cookies recipe from this site.

I'm no baking extraordinaire, but seriously, I want to meet the person that can mess up the taste of a cookie recipe that has 1 cup of butter and two cups of sugar. It just doesn't happen. My clogged arteries thank you.

 That being said, I only used 1 cup of sugar- brown sugar only- and they turned out good. To replace added some honey and reduced sugar syrup. Tripled the amount of vanilla extract. As usual.

The dough was pretty cement-like for me, but not too bad. I just used a spoon instead of my hands. I didn't do anything like refrigerate it. Coz lets be honest, I want cookies and I want em now.

The people at work love me when I bring in these cookies.  Two dozen are gone in a matter of hours.  They also freeze really well.  40 seconds in the microwave when frozen, & it's like they just came out of the oven.

My favorite oatmeal cookie recipe yet!  I only had "old fashioned" oatmeal, so I ran half of the oatmeal through my food processor.  The cookies were fantastic.  Soft and chewy.

Very nice.  I also put 1/2 cup less of the white sugar and they turned just right.  My two-year old enjoyed making and eating them too.  I pressed the dough on the rolling board and let my daughter cut it with a biscuit cutter.  

I was very surprised, though, when we've got more then 50 cookies, using the recipe scaled for 24...  We gave away some to my little one's daycare and some to her aunt and her gradma.  Everyone said they were good!

I've made these twice and they really are nice and soft. First time around, I did it almost exactly as the recipe stated and oh my god, it's way too sweet.  And they were a bit plain (bland) outside of the massive sweetness. I didn't flatten the cookies with a fork dipped in sugar (thank god, the last thing this recipe needs is more sweetness) but I did press them down with my palm. This recipe doesn't spread all too well so it needs it. I ended up baking them 8.5 minutes.

Second time around, I only used 2/3 cup of both the white sugar and brown sugar. And I added more cinnamon, some cloves, nutmeg, and ground ginger. That's when it really started coming together. I will definitely make this recipe again, with the adjustments.

This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe I've used.  I added 1 cup raisins and I love cinnamon so I eyeballed (and probably doubled the requested amount)... it turned out perfectly soft.  Take them out on time... they might not look fully done in the middle but once it cools it is PERFECT and SUPER SOFT!  SO SO SO delicious.  
I am a sugar fiend and per my sister's request only put 1 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar (reduced sugar by 1/4 cup) and it was perfect... just remember that the raisins will be sweet too if you add them.... if were to have added nuts though, I would want to keep the full amount of sugar because the skin on nuts taste bitter to me.  
What a great recipe!

Pretty good recipe, DH loves it but I'm not overly fond of oatmeal cookies as a rule so it's hard for me to say for sure.  Most definitely soft and moist, I don't think they're going to last very long.  I made 2/3 the recipe plain with no add-ons but added semi-sweet chocolate chips to the remaining 1/3.  Pretty good too.  Edited to add:  On the second day, the cookies were MUCH better.  Suddenly I could taste the oatmeal (which I think is what I was missing before) and the texture and everything was much better.  Changed to five stars from four.

I skipped the chilling of the dough, as well as the flattening the cookies with a sugared fork.  I also added a cup of craisins.  The cookies came out soft and delicious!  A definite keeper.

Amazing. Straight up amazing. My batch came out completely chewy (no crispiness at all, just as my husband and kids prefer :), and I followed the ingredient list as written. I didn't chill or flatten with a fork though; instead, I rolled them into balls (I managed about 4.5 dozen), and popped them into the oven as is (no flattening or chilling required). 8 1/2 to 9 minutes later? Perfection. Definitely my "go-to" oatmeal cookie recipe from now on. :)

These cookies are terrific. I have been experimenting with various oatmeal cookie recipes this week (including the one one the oatmeal box) and this is the best. I made batches with raisins, craisins, chocolate chips and plain. All great. I used parchment paper and did not grease. I did not refrigerate the dough, I used 3/4 c of white sugar instead of 1 cup.  I flattened the cookies slightly, with damp fingers. Did not use more sugar. They are the best....thanks.

I used this recipe to make oatmeal squares.  I substituted 1/4 cup vegetable oil plus 1/2 cup applesauce for the 1 cup butter and used only 1/2 cup white sugar.  I added a good helping of Craisins and baked in a 9x13 pan for about 30 minutes, then cut into squares.  They were super yummy!  Next time I might use only 1/4 cup white sugar.

Very nice. I did add a half cup of raisins, which I soaked in hot chai tea and drained before adding it to the dough. These baked up nicely and were a wonderful cookie to make with my boys. NOTE: I cut this recipe in half which made 24 medium sized cookies.

These cookies remind me of the thick oatmeal raisin cookies you get at the grocery store bakery or Costco....yummy.  They stay thick and chewy as long as you take them out early.  My family loved them gone the first day I made them.  I had to make more the next day, my husband couldn't get enough of them. I will definitely make them again.

Wow, I cut the sugar in half, only using 1/2 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown, and they turned out great!  I'm sure they would be awesome with full sugar also, just not as good for you :)

These cookies were wonderful.  They were heavenly soft right out the oven, and mine only needed 8 minutes.  The first batch, I left in for 10 and they came out a bit crunchy.  I cut back on 1/4 cup of sugar and added some coconut instead, but I think 1/2 of coconut would be better.  Also, when I was mixing the batter, my wooden spoon snapped!  Be prepared for a workout if you don't have an electric mixer.

This is a good oatmeal cookie but it's way toooo sweet!! I will absolutly make this recipe again, I will just cut the sugar by at least 1/2 a cup.  It's really good with dried cranberries and walnuts, I also used 1 tablespoon of vanilla and cinnamon for added flavor.  Thank you for this recipe.

Great cookie recipe! I underbaked them slightly, so that they would be soft and chewy. I made this recipe pretty much exactly as written, except I left the dough in balls, and didn't press it down with a sugared fork. Also, I divided the dough in half, and added raisins to one half, and miniature M & M's to the other half before chilling. This worked well, and the cookies came out beautifully. My family is really enjoying them. Thanks for sharing the great recipe! I'll be using this one again and again!

I made these cookies for my boss for "Boss' Day".
He loved them and said they were better than the
bakeries.  My husband gave them two thumps up.
They were soft and baked up perfect.

Delicious!!! I couldn't stop eating the batter while I was making them. I didn't press them down and they came out think and soft. they were super easy to make too. after I left them out to cool they got as hard as a rock. These are best to eat as soon as they are out of the oven while they're still soft and warm.

I made these cookies yesterday for the first time, i did not refridgerate them because i didn't see the need for it, i just put a spoonful on the cookie sheet and pressed them down with my palm of my hand, i like mine a bit thicker and i put dried cranberries in them, they weren't over the top, i find no oatmeal cookie recipe that is flowing over with flavor but they were good and i will make them again.

Made these the other day, outstanding! Added 1 cup of white chips and 1 cup of craisins. I didn't find any need to refrigerate the dough. I made walnut size balls and left them that way and I baked until lightly browned any more than that made a crunchy cookie.

I love these soft chewy cookie. I added raisins cause an oatmeal cookie is not complete without them. The recipe states to push the cookie down with a fork, prior to cooking, but I didn't want more sugar so I just left them in a heap on the cookie sheet, and found they fell flat, just fine, without the added step.

My husband said they were the best oatmeal cookies he had ever had.  I did add about a cup of raisins.  The first batch I let chill about 45 minutes.  Decided to see how it would do in the frig for longer so I left it overnight and made another batch the next day.  And finally one more fresh batch on the third day.  The dough kept nicely and I was able to have a fresh cookie for 3 days!  Several days after being baked they have held up really well and are still very moist.

i am 15 and this recipe is so easy and delicious that i had to double it just to  ensure that they last for more than 2-3 days!  But i DID change it up a lil. Instead of using all purpose flour i used whole wheat flour and splenda to make it a little bit healthier. I did not use vanilla but i did use caramel pecan extract which is phenominal in the cookies!thank you soo much for the amazing rexcipe!!

These were so good! We baked them as directed for the first pan full. For the second and third pans, we baked them 12 minutes, and then immediately transferred them to the wire rack without cooling them on the pan. It seemed to go faster that way. They were delicious!

Love this cookie!  Like many, I tweaked mine based on the reviews.  I coarsely chop 2 out of the 3 cups of oats, add 1 cup each of the white choc. chips, walnuts and sweetened dried cranberries (Craisens).  I also add a tsp of cinnamon to the mixture as well.  Just be sure to get them as uniform in size as possible to ensure even baking.  I know that’s a “duh” moment for many of you, but I’m always in such a hurry I forget. ;-)   I've always gotten rave reviews from this cookie and I'm so glad it was shared with us!

Made these with my 4 year old daughter and they turned out very well.  Quick and easy to make.  As they cooled, they got a little crispy, but still tasted great!! Thanks for sharing!!

What a lovely recipe! I made a half batch of these cookies, and they turned out great! I used margarine instead of butter, and I measured everything else out except the cinnamon and salt. Just added a dash of salt and maybe 2 dashes of cinnamon. Also I baked them at 350 degrees since I was using an aluminum cookie sheet and was afraid they would burn, and cooked them for about 12 minutes instead of 8. They came out great! Also make sure the dough stays cold. I left the bowl of remaining dough out on the counter when the first batch was baking. The second batch did not puff up as much as the first, but still came out good. Also baked the second batch a few minutes longer to make them crispy.

These might just be the best oatmeal cookies I've ever made. I did add one cup of raisins, and they ended up being perfectly moist & chewy. This one's going on the frequent-rotation list.

Made as is and also made using half butter have vegetable or canola oil. Doing the former is tasty and doing the latter makes for a softer cookie with enough butter taste. I like these esp. since I can easily half the recipe as the full recipe calls for two eggs. I would suggest chilling the dough first before baking though.

Ok, so I rated 1 star for now because of the consistency of the dough. I haven't baked these yet so I'll update after they come out of the oven. I normally use an ice cream scoop to form my cookie dough. Well...I just took my dough out of the fridge and omg, it's hard as a rock! Perhaps this is why the instructions say to 'roll the dough' because, quite literally, it's unscoopable.  Being the stubborn gal that I am and, I'll admit it, I'm feeling lazy today...I'm going to let the dough sit out for a bit and see if it softens enough to scoop. I shall return! UPDATE: Alright, I couldn't wait until the dough softened. I struggled with my ice cream scoop, dropped 'em on a parchment lined baking sheet, DID NOT FLATTEN, and stuck 'em in a 375 degree oven. After 8 mins, the edges were browned and they were utterly flat. I pulled them out but they still looked completely raw in the middle. Back in they went for another 2 mins. Although they looked like the middle still wasn't fully cooked, I took them out because they were getting really dark. I made 2 different batches, one with butterscotch chips, the 2nd batch I made with semi-sweet chocolate chips, dried cranberries and toasted almonds. The second batch turned out better. The flavor is really good. We'll see if they stay soft. I decided that if I make these again I'll reduce the amount of oats and NOT refrigerate the dough.

These cookies were moist, delicious, and had the perfect amount of spice.  *However*, and this is a bonus, my dough yielded 44 healthy sized cookies and I followed the recipe to a 'T'.  Some even started out slightly larger than a walnut.  Also, I skipped the refrigeration step (due to time constraints) and I didn't bother with the smooshing of the dough balls (due to laziness) and they couldn't have been better.  Last, these are QUICK to put together, even for a slow-poke like me!

Don't add any liquid to the cookie dough. I made the mistake of adding 1/4 cup of milk to the dough to make it easier to manage and my cookies turned out flat and doughy. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly + adding a cup of dried cranberries. I chilled the dough for an hour too. I greased the cookie sheets lightly w/ olive oil which I'm not sure if that affected them. Let's hope they firm up more in the next couple of days.

These came out at a pleasant mix of soft and chewy. However: You do not need to chill the dough, in fact, this stuff becomes almost frozen stiff if refrigerated. I'd skip the part about dipping the fork in sugar etc - I just rolled these into balls, and used parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheet.

These cookies were not soft AT ALL. They were actually very hard, and tough. I made the recipe twice just to make sure it wasn't the way I had made, them but they were just as awful as the first round!

These cookies really aren't that great. They are very crunchy. Not soft. I doubled the size of the cookies and they turned out a little better.
I'd rather buy oatmeal cookie dough from the grocery store.

I was first nervous about making these because the serving size says 24, and I needed to make exactly 36 cookies. I then found that one reviewer commented that this recipe made 50 cookies for her. so, I decided to keep the recipe the same & not change the serving size. I added a heaping cup full of Trader Joe's Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips, reduced the oatmeal to 1 & 3/4 cup, and added a Chocolate chip morsel in the center of each cookie. SO CUTE!!. You don't need to refridgerate. In the end, I ended UP making 48 regular sized cookies & 4 JUMBO COOKIES!!! YUM-O VERYYY GOOD. I love chewy, gooey cookies & these were perfect!

These cookies are AWESOME!!  I added a half a cup of raisans and some dried pears.  They are so yummy.  Some of the other reviews said to take out some of the sugar, but I think they are perfect the way they are.  If you were to take out some of the sugar, they may be a little to boring.

Delicious!!! Made half with chocolate chips, and half with craison and white chocolate chips.  Both turned out amazing!  Followed the recipe exactly (the cinnamon is the secret ingredient!), except I just froze the dough in the freezer for 10 min while the oven was preheating, then used a cookie baller instead of pressing flat with a fork.  Be sure to take the cookies out when they are just beginning to turn brown around the edges.  Then let cool on the pan for 5 minutes before transferring.  So good!

Wonderful recipe! I made this twice in one week! That is now good this recipe is. During the first time I only used 1 tsp of cinnamon because I only had that much around. The second time around I had forgotten to buy some more cinnamon, so I made it without the cinnamon. I didn't pack the brown sugar and skipped the fork dipped in sugar at the end. I used a cookie scooper and ended up with 2 inch cookies. I baked them for about 9 minutes. They tasted and turned out great both times. Very chewy! I couldn't stop eating them, and I even had a few for breakfast with my coffee. I got plenty of compliments on these cookies as well!

Made as written except for the sugar, I used coconut sugar (low glycemic) but used the same amount as written, also I didnt flatten them but left them round. They came out soft and chewy and taste great!

The best oatmeal cookies! I did not refrigerate them, did not grease the cookie sheet, used spoonfuls dropped on the cookie sheet and did not flatten them with a fork. I did try a little sugar and cinnamon sprinkled on top. All of this I got from other reviews. What ever you do this is a good starter to add stuff too or even good just as they are. They cook a little quicker than 8 - 10 minutes so you need to keep an eye on them. My new favorite.

These are an absolutely perfect basic oatmeal cookie recipe. Dress them up however you prefer your oatmeal treats to be. I added 1c white chocolate chips and 1/2c dried cranberries. Otherwise I kept the recipe exactly as is. Do chill the dough before baking and form into balls for thick, chewy cookies. Don't flaten them. Bakes in 8 minutes.

I gave these to a friend of the family and she told me later they were the Best oatmeal cookies she's ever had anywhere!  I always add chocolate chips to mine because that's what we like-not much of a raisin-cookie family.  But this is a great recipe to add whatever ingredient(s) your taste buds prefer.  I also cut down the sugar by about 1/2 cup total...just a personal preference.  Everything has SO much sugar in it these days.  If you cut back on this recipe they are still VERY sweet cookies-you won't even notice and they'll be slightly less fattening that way too.

I made this recipe with my grandsons (ages 5 and 6) and it turned out great. I added dried cranberries and walnuts. I halved the recipe at this time and it was great right away but it gets a bit stale the next day. Don't double the recipe. I did that and it was very dry and wouldn't keep their form.

Oh my yummy!! I followed ingredients as written (but I did replace the white sugar with splenda). I did not chill the dough, I went ahead and rolled them into 33 little balls (did NOT flatten them or grease the cookie sheets) and baked at 375 for about 11 minutes per batch, cooled a couple minutes on the cookie sheet and moved to the cooling rack. This resulted in DELICIOUS and soft little cookies which is the way we like them. The flavor is really great!

Just love these cookies!!! I will say I made them exactly as the recipe said and they were VERY thin!! I pressed the first bath down with a fork and baked for 8 minutes, and they turned out underdone and incredibly delicate because of how thin they were. Don't worry about pressing them down!! They spread a lot! I may use margarine or shortening next time, as they have higher melting points. I will probably add in some raisins, too, but the flavor of these without anything added is superb!! I went with a 9 minute baking time. I like my chocolate chip cookies a bit underdone and soft, but you can't do that with these - it just doesn't work the same. They need to be cooked until they are pretty brown. Overall a wonderful recipe and a definite keeper!!

Overall I quite liked these cookies.  I did find there were a little too many oats, but that may be down to personal preference.  Reduced oats to 2 1/2 cups, added 1/4 cup of Raisins and 1/4 cup of mini choc chips.  Followed the recipe exactly.

These turned out DELICIOUS!!!  I don't usually review things and I kind of hate when people write what they did, but I thought these changes might be helpful and time saving...  I used whole wheat flour and they still taste great (not whole wheaty).  I also did not chill which saved a lot of time, and I did not press down with a fork with sugar.  They were sweet enough already and I didn't want them to get too crisp.  And I added craisins and pecans for an extra touch!  Great recipe.  I highly recommend!

Everyone who gave this a good review must not have actually followed this recipe exactly as written.  I tried twice and got the same results with flat ugly looking cookies.  Taste is fine but nothing special.  Not soft...crispy and crumbly, no matter when I take them out of the oven.

There isn't really much to say that hasn't already been said but these are really great cookies.  I followed the recipe exactly but did not chill or flatten dough.  I think next time I will chill a little because they turned out a little more flat that I like.  Excellent cookie!

I've never liked oatmeal cookies until now. These are absolutely outstanding.   I followed the recipe exactly with the addition of 1 cup of dried cherries.  I used a small cookie scoop and ended up with about 6 dozen cookies.

Five stars for sure.  These are so delicious and a great base recipe for different add ins.  I just dropped mine onto cookie sheet with my cookie scoop without making a ball or flattening.  They were perfect. Not sure how some submitters got flat cookies-maybe ck your baking soda that its not old. Store it in a cool spot.  It will lose it power. I cooked 8 minutes for a softer cookie and ten minutes for a crispier cookie. Perfection.  Added 1 cup walnuts and 1 cup raisins-YUMMY! Will add choc chips in very very soon ;)

These cookies are very good, I love them because they are chewy!  But they are so sweet, I already decreased the sugar to half and they are still too sweet, and you can feel the granules.  Next time I think I will only use the brown sugar, there is no need for both.  Also, there is no need to chill the batter or flatten the cookies with a fork dipped in sugar(please no more sugar! haha).  You can use the batter as soon as you make it and the flattening, that all depends on the shape that you prefer for your cookies, if you like them flat them flatten them, if you dont then dont!  Overall this is a yummy oatmeal cookie.  I added raisins; next time I want to try dark chocolate chips and walnuts! YUM!  Just a tip, when you store them (or any cookies), keep them in a plastic container with a tight fitting cover, and put the cookies in while they are still a little warm; this way they stay very chewy!! I actually think these cookies taste better the next day.

This recipe is excellent.  I made the cookies on Monday and Friday they were still moist and chewy.  With just my husband and I at home now, the amount was just right.  I will definitely use this one again.

Excellent recipe.  This is my husband's favorite cookie.  This is better than the name brand oatmeal recipe.  I ended up with about 3 1/2 dozen cookies and had added a cup of chocolate chips.  I also only cooked for 9 minutes since we like them to stay soft after a day or two.  This will definitely be the recipe I stop at for good!

Mmmm... These made my house smell so good! I followed the recipe almost exactly, except for 2 things. I only used 1/2 cup of butter (1 stick) that's more than enough. I was craving chocolate and I LOVE oatmeal, so I decided to make these into choco-oatmeal cookies. All I added was 3TBSP of Hershey's cocoa. If you want to use baking squares instead it equals out to 1 square. Delicious!

Absolutely amazing flavor! I'd suggest really watching these cookies while they bake though. They continue to cook even after you pull them out of the oven (and therefore lose that "soft" element). PERFECT flavor-- give this one a try!

These are great cookies and always get compliments. I prefer to use 2 c. of oatmeal because the cookies spread more and are more chewy. Either way, delicious!

Easy, soft and chewy cookie!!  I added a 12 oz. package of butterscotch chips and omitted the cinnamon.  I used a level measuring tablespoon and just flatted them with my hand.  They all were all uniform in size (big) and my grandkids think they're the best oatmeal cookie they've EVER HAD!!!

I skipped the hour chilling and just dropped them by the rounded spoonful onto the baking sheet. I followed the recipe exactly and they were a nice simple soft cookie.

These are true to the claim!  Soft and chewy and delicious!  One thing though, they don't spread much beyond what you squish them down to with a fork, so if you want larger cookies, make larger dough balls and squish accordingly.  Excellent recipe!

These are kick-butt cookies!! I also changed the brown sugar to 1 1/4th cup and backed the white sugar down to 3/4 cup. Also I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla. They came out awesome!! My girlfriend tried them and said that from now on, I will be in charge of all "cookie making" in the family. Try this recipe, you wont regret it I promise.

These cookies are wonderful. I added 1 cup of butterscotch chips.
Note: when they come out of the oven, they will be very soft but they firm up after standing for 5 minutes on the cookie sheet.

This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe.  I have been baking for over 30 years and this recipe is a winner.  I make it at least 3 times a month.  My husband is addicted to these cookies.  I do add 1 cup of raisins and 1/2 cup walnuts and 2Tbs of molasses.

The oatmeal raisin cookie recipe I have been searching for!  These cookies are great if you like soft, chewy cookies.  I only did a couple of variations...I like oatmeal raisin cookies so I used a cup of raisins.  I soaked the raisins in the egg, vanilla and a 1/2 tsp rum to plump them up and also added a little extra cinnamon. Delicious!

a couple of changes for us...
First used 1/2 cup splenda sugar blend and added a ton (2 1/2 cups) raisens
second didn't chill, but instead spread out onto a lightly greased jelly roll pan
3rd baked at 350 for about 5 minutes longer
4th cut into about 72 small bar cookies.  Saved a lot of time rolling and smushing.  and then I have lots of little chewy cookies for my family.

Yum Yum and Yum.....these cookies were great.  Soft and chewy..even when thawed from the freezer.  I scaled for 96 and got 180 good size cookies, oh dear, but oh well the more the merrier. I divided it into 3 batches....oatmeal raisen, plain and simple...oatmeal, raisen and white choco chips a little sweeter....oatmeal, raisen, white choco chips, macadamion nuts and skor toffee pieces, now thats a cookie...works for the sweet tooth.  Husband and three teens give it big thumbs up.

I love having bacon with pasta, but with the garlic and the oil it makes the recipe really Italian. This is ideal for large amounts of people quickly and easily with a delicious meal.

Great Recipe, turns out perfect just the way it is.  Accidentally omitted the cinnamon, loved it anyway.  Gives a sweet and chewy cookie.  Recipe recommends 8-10 minutes in the oven- 8 minutes was perfect for me.

Awesome taste. However, they are crumbling even following the recommendations of others. Perhaps one less cup of oatmeal. Sadly this will be the first and last time I will make these .

I goofed when making this recipe.  Instead of using one cup of butter I used one stick.  The cookies actually turned out great.  I feel a little less guilty eating these knowing I used half the butter!

These cookies turned out great. Followed most of the recipe. Accidentally used baking powder instead of baking soda I used old fashioned oats because that was what I had and added 1 1/2 cups raisins. I lined the cookie sheet with parchment paper instead of greasing it.  Also used my own homemade vanilla extract. When their still warm from the oven they're soft and chewy. After they have cooled off completely they firm up, but are still chewy and delicious. My husband and kids kept sneaking back for more.  For all those who tried this recipe and had their cookies fall flat. Try mixing until the ingredients are just combined. Over mixing can cause them to flatten out. Will definitely make these again. Going to try adding chocolate chips next time.

when I made this recipe I cooked them at 350 degrees F and for 10 minutes and it turned out nice and soft when I tried it at 375 degrees F and 8-10 minutes like the recipe said it turned out dry and crunchy  but over all the cookies were soft tasted great but were a tad dry.

I had some quick oats that I wanted to use up, and these cookies were the perfect solution!  I wanted to add some raisins, and following what another reviewer said, I accordingly decreased the amount of sugar used.  In addition, I didn't refrigerate the dough or press the cookies with a sugary fork because it seemed unnecessary.  After I had combined all of the ingredients, I noticed that the dough was a bit dry; to compensate for this, I added a little unsweetened applesauce.  The cookies baked for ten minutes exactly and came out golden-brown on the tops and bottoms yet soft inside--the perfect combination of crunchy and chewy.  I ate five before I stopped myself--they were that good.  Very impressed!

So delicious! I made them because they looked easy and quick. My sister loved them! I still have a few batches left in my oven baking!! I baked mine for 9 minutes and they were perfect! This is my all time fave oatmeal cookie recipe! 
My little tip:
I used Splenda instead of sugar. That's what I dusted with. They are so good!  

I am definitely making these again!! Love them! :)

I just made them with a small revision of 1/2 cup suger, 1/2 cup brown suger , 1 tsp of cinnamon, and 3/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. They came out amazing! I did 9 minutes and very important walnut size on the pan.  They came out light and tasty.

-Instead of pressing with the back of a spoon I simply give them a gentle press with my thumb before putting them in the oven.
 
-I only used 1/2 cup of each type of sugar.

-Instead og baking for 8-10 minutes, I take them out at 6 minutes, when they are still gooey inside. When they cool, this will keep them very moist.

-I also added 3/4 cup of raisins.

I would give these six stars if I could. These are perfect. Chewy, melt-in your mouth, positively delicious. A permanent addition to my recipe collection.

excellent cookie!  I followed the recipe as is and wouldn't change a thing.  I did take the posters suggestion and added 1/2 cup walnuts and a 1/2 cup of dried cranberries.  I yeilded 30 cookies from this recipe due to the addition of nuts and berries.  Highly recommend!

Excellent!!!  Thank-You for the recipe!!  I am not sure why some say they are not moist??  Mine were soft and moist, I just followed the directions (Except didn't have butter, so I used a baking margarine).  I assure you I WILL be making these again!

I followed the recipe and they turned out really well! I did add in dark chocolate chips which were good, but clashed with the cinnamon. So either I would skip the cinnamon or the chips next time! Good cookie! Also I did just drop them with a spoon on a cookie sheet you don't need to chill them and flatten them with a fork..

My coworker made these and brought them in today. They are delicious! Not too sweet, not moist and yet not dry, not as soft as I expected (I don't like them too soft anyway), not buttery. Overall a great tasting, guilt-free oatmeal cookie!

These are great! I did make a few modifications based on a wonderfully chewy chocolate chip cookie recipe I have.  I melted no salt butter and allowed it to brown slightly to enhance the nutty flavor.  I decreased the overall amount of sugar to 1 3/4 cup and used 1 1/4 cup of light brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, using more brown sugar than white also increases chewiness.  I whisked the butter and sugars together until well combined and added the eggs and vanilla.  I whisked for 30 seconds and allowed to rest for 3 minutes, repeating this 2 more times, this allows the sugars to fully dissolve.  I also added a pinch of ground cloves and nutmeg to dry ingredients.  Adhered to the directions from this point on and got rave reviews from my taste testers.  They are so addictive. WOW! I've made these cookies probably about 4 times in the last week, tweaking each time a bit, and they keep getting better.  I definitely recommend melting and slightly brown the butter, reducing the sugar to 1 1/3 cup total (1/2 cup white sugar and the rest brown), reducing the flour to 1 3/4 cup (I used 3/4 of whole wheat flour on my last batch and they were awesome and a little healthier).  I use a heavy teaspoon of cinnamon, plus ginger, nutmeg, and ground cloves, 1/2 t each. SO SO GOOD!

Delicious baked and unbaked!  I read from some reviews that you should not flatten the cookies with a fork or else the would be too thin and crisp.  I did not flatten mine and they were slightly brown on the bottom.  My second round I slightly pushed them down with my cookie scoop, they turned out great.

Excellent.  I used old fashioned oats. Didn't chill dough or flatten. Turned out excellent.  Cooked for 9 minutes. I made 1/2 the recipe and it still made about 20 cookies.

Just made these today. My family loves these. These are my go to oatmeal cookies. I've tried many different recipes, but come back to this one. 

I did NOT roll them into walnut size balls. I always drop them by spoon. I get 4 dozen outta this recipe every time. 

My kids love the taste of these cookies. I like the way the cookies look, always perfect. They never ever turn into those lumpy fat oatmeal cookies that we dislike. They always have the look of a chocolate chip cookie, chewy and flat, but not thin.

The dough mixes up perfect for me every time. So very very easy. I have made 8 dozen at a time just to stock up the freezer. They freeze perfectly.

I never have added raisins, kids dislike them, but bet they would be great.

Can't say enough good things about this recipe.

Totally agree with Jenip. These cookies can be soft if you just bake them for 7-8 minutes at 350.  Or they can be crispy if you decide to bake them for longer than 8 min. However, I think these cookies were only designed to be soft.  Ingredient ratio is great, but it only works for soft cookies. Yes, The cookies will be crisp if you bake them long. Only problem is that they will also be dry. So if u like crisp cookies, dont use this recipe. If you like soft chewy cookies, this recipe is perfect, but only if you underbake.

These are delicious frozen.  I know it sounds weird but they make an excellent frozen treat (plus they last longer... not that you'll need them to).  I made them once the normal way (Yum!).  And once using splenda for the white sugar and apple sauce for half the butter (guiltless yum!).  This is a great recipe!

After reading all the positive reviews I was very disappointed. I followed the recipe exactlt and they were way over-the-top sweet.They were also very flat.

I'm trying to decide if I should try "tweaking" the recipe. Or just move on to a better one. If I tweak -- these are the changes I'd make:

Use butter flavor shortening in lieu of at least 1/2 the butter and not refrigerate or flatten before baking. Would also cut back at least 1/2-cup on the sugar. Then we might have something.

I made these the other night with my little boy and we followed the recipe exactly, well we added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, and some nutmeg...and they turned out perfect. A hugh hit. For greasing the pan I used a non stick spray, baked at 375 for exactly 8 minutes, centres still looked a little gooey but I pulled them out anyhow and they were perfect. Soft, baked through and delicious. LOVED THEM! They are all gone. Making another batch tonight! :)

I made these just before the holidays after my last batch turned into hockey pucks within a day. These were fantastic. I do recommend that you watch the cooking time if you want them to be soft. My oven (gas) cooked them in 6 minutes. I used a tablespoon to measure so they were all the same size. They didn't spread much at all. 
Overall, great recipe and I will definitely make them again.  I added butterscotch chips and pecans to a few to give them a holiday kick!

I made this recipe exactly as is and we were disappointed! They flattened out in the oven, even further than you flatten them with the fork. They were completely crispy after 8 mins in the oven due to the spreading out and they were flavorless! I do not recommend these cookies.

All I can say is this is a great recipe for 'GOOD & MOIST'cookies. You must take the cookies out in 10 minutes and not a minute longer. THey will be brown on the bottom and soft and gooey like on top, but once they rest they are awesome. It will look like you are taking out undone cookies, but don't fear, because they are still cooking on the hot cookie pan once you take them out. I just love this recipe.

Perfect.  I added a splash of black-walnut extract and a didn't refrigerate, didn't press with a fork.  Just drop-cookie style, baked for about 8 minutes.  I only made half a batch and I got 30 cookies!

Hubby drooled after eating them.  I took a reviewer's advice and added 1 tsp cin and 1 tsp cloves and then I added to dash's of nutmeg.  YUM!!!!  I didnt cool them in the fridge. I just scooped them, flattened them and cooked them till almost done (7 min)... let them stay a little longer on the pan, and then removed to the rack. Moist chewy deliciousness!!!

These are the absolute best oatmeal cookies I've ever eaten! I made these recently for a family reunion of over 100 people and they were definitely a hit and everyone was asking about them! I didn't change anything about the recipe and I even let the dough sit in the fridge for several hours before baking. If you do refrigerate the dough then you will need to press the dough down with a fork because they didn't spread out much even after 10 mins in the oven. They were thick and chewy and just perfect; and I've never made oatmeal cookies before. I highly recommend this recipe!

LOVE these cookies. So soft and yummy! I made some changes - used palm shortening for the butter to make lower-cholesterol, used 1.5 cups brown sugar instead of any white sugar, put a little extra vanilla to my taste, omitted cinnamon and added chocolate chips. 

n the past I've left cinnamon in and added dried cranberries and walnuts, which is awesome too!

I followed the recipe to the "T."  Easy to follow and taste good. I added 1/4 cranberries, 1/4 raisins, and 1/4 butterscotch chips in half of the oatmeal mix so i can have varieties. Both cookies were delicious!

I followed the recipe, but I added in a cup of mixed: raisins, almonds, and coconut...I regretted following some of the suggestions, like not pressing it down with a fork, because the balled walnut sized version didn't cook up properly on my oven. Burned bottoms, raw interiors. Next time I would follow the sugar with the fork suggestion.

Great cookies but really too sweet for my taste, next time I will certainly cut down on the sugar. I divided my dough into 2 parts. I baked 1 right away the other I chiled for an hour, but the result was no difference between the the two batches.

These are so delicious - I added 1 cup of raisins & 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips.
Soft, chewy - exactly the kind of cookie you want your child to remember when she is all grown up!

Perfect! I just used Demerara sugar for both the white and brown sugar, as I'm a huge fan and always adds an extra richness and delicious caramelized texture and taste to baking. Thank you! My boyfriend approves too;)

I gave this 5 stars because it was easy and it turned out great, well half of them did. So my first batch I used a traditional dark/semidark cookie sheet with the lip - and I used parchment paper - they turned out absolutely PERFECT! BUT when I tried to grease a lighter flat sheet the bottoms got real weird and crunchy ... the whole cookie didn't spread well except for the very bottom, not good. Also, I took others recommendations and didn't bother cooling or rolling the dough, and I added raisins. Delish :)

Got rave reviews from this one.  I actually added half wheat flour as well as some molasses with white sugar instead of part of the brown sugar.  Turned out wonderfully!

Delicious! Definitely soft. I made the dough yesterday and didn't get to baking them until today. I was a little curious about whether you needed to flatten them so I did it to every other cookie. Personally, I didn't taste a big difference. I didn't dip the fork in sugar either. Instead of rolling them, I used a small cookie scoop. Will definitely save this recipe.

Great cookie!  Crispy on the outside, and chewy on the inside.  Though alot of sugar, this cookie is actually not overly sweet (I even added some semi-sweet chocolate chips!).  It made about 40 normal sized cookies (3").  I did substitute half of the butter with vegetable oil to lower the saturated fat content, and replaced 1/2 cup of the quick oats with natural bran.  The dough will feel a little dry after refrigerating it an hour but it will still hold even after I press the balls of dough down slightly (I think you can possibly skip the refrigeration step).  I like my cookies as fresh as possible, so I usually bake a dozen and freeze on parchment lined trays, and Zip-loc bag the remaining dough pucks to bake for a quick batch  fresh, hot cookies from the oven.  Mmmm!

These are some of the better oatmeal cookies I have tasted.  My ONLY dislike was they were SUPER sweet.  I mean, really really sweet.  But based on other reviews, I did not want to cut the sugar and mess them up further.  So I left the sugar alone. I did not have all purpose flour so I used self rising and omitted the salt and baking soda.  They WERE pretty moist, almost too gooey so we had to bake longer than the time given and turned the oven down 25 degrees when we did that to prevent them from burning.   They were very rich and yummy though.  We did add 1 cup of raisins and they were great.

I have tried a lot of oatmeal cookie recipes but this is the best one I've tried so far. This recipe needs no flavor alterations. It tastes GREAT!!!!  My kids loved them. They are crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. Bake on parchment paper and the cookies will come off without having to grease the pans.

These cookies are nice and soft.  The flavor was really good, except my husband and I both thought that the cinnamon flavor was a little too strong to be an oatmeal cookie.  My husband joked that they were a combination of a snickerdoodle and an oatmeal cookie.  So next time I will probably reduce the cinnamon.  But regardless, they were definitely tasty!

Picture perfect cookies!  Try pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon, and they'll have a wonderful spiced flavor to them.

Made these and loved them a little too sweet so definitely decrease the white sugar especially if adding raisins. Hence the 4 stars.

The only ingredient substitution I made was regular-flavored Crisco for the butter because I didn't have enough butter.  Also, I didn't refrigerate the dough, press cookie dough w/a fork dipped in sugar, nor grease the cookie sheet.  They turned out awesome----best oatmeal cookie recipe ever......slightly crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle---YUM!  Thanks for sharing!

This cookies are the perfect oatmeal cookie. They are very soft and tasty. I had to substitute applesauce and canola oil for the butter since I can't have dairy. I also replaced half the flour with whole wheat flour. I added raisins too. I couldn't stop eating them.

Very simple and tasty.  You can't mess this one up.  I didn't chill them at all, didn't grease the cookie sheets, and didn't flatten them with a fork and they still came out great.  I even decided to mix everything in one bowl, just to see how it would happen.  Perfect.

This is a very good recipe.  For me there is something missing that would make it great, but I'm not quite sure what.  They do come out nice and soft.  I divided my batch in half, and put raisins in one, and dark chocolate pieces and dried cranberries in the other half.  I did refrigerate mine for a couple of hours, as I didn't have time to bake them right away.  I rolled them into balls and flattened them a little bit with my palms.  One very useful tool I would like everyone to get familiar with is parchment paper, it will make your life in the kitchen much easier.  I always line my cookie sheets with it and then there is no need to grease anything.  I don't even need a spatula to remove the cookies to a cooling rack.   It is great for lining your bread pans and cake pans too.

Ok was looking for a good cookie recipe and I came across this one and I am so glad that I did.  These cookies were so soft and moist. They were even the same the day after. Kids were happy, I was happy and most of all husband was happy and he love oatmeal cookies.  Thanks for sharing and this one is a keeper.
As for cooking them it is always good to take them out a little before time so that they won't burn on the bottom.  :)

Hubby says "Oh man....They're DELICIOUS!"  I have to agree.  I used a bit less cinnamon and added mini choc chips.  These are not "fluffy" or cake-like....they're ooowey chewey awesome good! ****UPDATE!  Do yourself a favor and before you dream up all the possible add-ins....make at least 1 batch as-is.  OMG!!  Simple and OHHH SOOOO GOOD!!

These are by far these best oatmeal cookies that I have ever made and I have tried alot of good ones.  I also followed another reviewers suggestion of adding 1/2 t. of ground cloves. I used butter flavored crisco instead of butter because it is cheaper.  I liked it so much I made 3 batches. 1 with raisins, 1 with cinnamon chips and one with butterscotch chips.  All were very good.  Thank you so much for sharing.

I cut the white sugar in half and added some chopped pecans and some yogurt chips (which are delicious, id reccomend using them if you can find them, its the same stuff they use to make yogurt covered pretzels). I didn't chill or flatten my dough because my butter didn't get too soft. I did have to lower the oven temp to 350 because at 375 the bottoms of the cookies burnt before the centers were cooked.I also got way more than 24 cookies, especially with "walnut sized balls"... I got 57 total. These were good, they won't be my 'go-to' recipe but id make them again.

I used the granulated sugar substitute in place of the white sugar to bring down calorie count. I also doubled the vanilla to 2 teaspoons (used Mexican vanilla - you can find this at mexican food mart  - it is better than the regular big box store vanilla). These are AMAZING cookies! GREAT recipe, I have made them 3 times, always a hit!

Yum!  Great cookies and a simple recipe.  They all turned out soft and moist.  No need to roll them into balls, just dropped them on a cookie sheet and they turned out great.  Also didnt use a sugared fork, they bake up nice on their own.  This one is a keeper!

Since I was making these for the first time I followed the recipe exactly in regards to ingredients/measurements.  I split my batter in half and added cranberries to one half and left the other just like the recipe.  I saw quite a few reviews where people said they didn't chill the dough, so I decided to use my two batches to try both methods.  Had MUCH better luck with chilling the dough...not doing so made for very flat, thin cookies whereas my chilled batch came out perfectly (I rolled them into balls but didn't flatten them).  Loved the flavor and texture, will certainly make again!!!

Excellent recipe! I read all of the negative (1 star) reviews before making it, just for kicks, and was very amused that the vast majority of unfavorable reviews were from people who got negative results when they didn't follow the recipe. Amusingly, I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but the results were some of the best cookies I've ever made (I ended up using slightly less butter, adding chocolate chips, and a tad bit of milk).  Will DEFINITELY use this one again!

Wow. I have never found such a brilliant oatmeal cookie. Its chewy, soft, and simple, yet flavorful. a couple little things: many people have commented that you don't need to refrigerate the dough. I think this depends upon the temperature of the kitchen--if its cool and the dough isn't warm, then you're fine. I was baking in a tiny kitchen with no AC in 85 degree heat and my dough was starting to get melty by the time I was ready to bake. I would just be sure the dough is firm. If you follow this tip, do not press them down; if the dough was cold, that would be ok, but otherwise your cookies will spread too much (unless you want them crunchy which is fine, but not what the recipe advertises). I also definitely agree with the person who said to keep them small--walnut-sized is perfect. They spread out a bit and brown perfectly at a small size. And then you can eat MORE! Happy Baking!

I really like this recipe! If you use all whole wheat flour, the cookies won't spread as much, but it's still really good. It's a great base recipe. I can't wait to do more of my own variations.

WOW! These are SO tasty. The first batch I baked for 9 minutes and they were too hard -but the second batch I timed for 7 minutes and they came out perfect -the next day they were still chewy. I dusted the tops with cinnamon-sugar before baking and right after pulling them from the oven...I will definitely make these again! I froze a few rolls of this dough for quick baking next time.

Good recipe.  Added 1 cup raisins.  Did not chill and did not flatten.  After mixing the dough I immediately scooped in heaps on the baking sheet and baked for 8 minutes.  Yummy!

Fantastic cookies.  I added shredded coconut to the batter and then topped the cookies with some toasted coconut about two minutes before they were finished baking.  I did not press the cookies down with a fork and mine were nice and thick.

These cookies were amazing. I did not add the sugar on top, I try to use as little sugar as possible...but they turned out very chewy and moist! I will definitely make these again, but next time I may add some raisins. Thank you for posting!

These cookies are very good. I followed what others said about not pressing w/sugar fork. I used a cup of dried bluweberries and instead of butter I used I can't beleive it is not butter and instead of white sugar I used Splenda. My son is allergic to eggs so I used 1 tsp dry yeast to 1/4 cup warm water per egg. Even with these few changes the cookies are very moist, chewy and YUMMY! Many Thanks for sharing!!!!

I was looking for the Quaker Oatmeal Cookie recipe that you usually find on the inside lid of the container. I bought store brand oats though, so I checked here for something comparable. I think this recipe is almost identical and it was exactly what I wanted. The only thing I changed was I added a cup of chocolate chips. I didn't chill the dough or flatten it with a fork and they turned out great. Thanks for posting this recipe.

Excellent cookie! I double the vanilla and use pure mexican vanilla, because my husband loves a rich vanilla taste. I also add a quarter bag of white chocolate chips or of andes mint pieces. For softer cookies, don't flatten them - they will spread out into perfect rounds on their own, retaining a moist, chewy center.

I've made a lot of oatmeal cookies in my life.  These are by far the best.  I subbed the white sugar for splenda, and dropped them onto sheets instead of refrigerating/rolling.  Air-bake cookie sheets, 10 minutes, perfect cookies.

These are simply DELICIOUS! I didn't use butter. We use Fleishmans Olive Oil spread. Didn't have any vanilla, though it didn't matter. I would not press these cookies down with a fork.  They turned out perfectly when formed into a walnut size ball and placed on cookie sheet.  Mine did take almost 12 minutes to bake.  Very moist and chewy. This is now my "go to" oatmeal cookie recipe. I might also add that making them walnut size, you will get WAY more than 2 dozen...at least 4 dozen. I've stopped counting!

This recipe was a great success...in fact, the cookies were "as close to perfect as they could possibly be" (my husbands words).  I added 1 cup raisans and cut the sugar to 3/4 cup. One could play with the sugar and additions to come up with their own "perfect" version of this delightful recipe.

KEEPER!! I have been looking for a good oatmeal cookie recipe, this is a great one.  After reading reviews I did do "my thing" with the recipe.  I subbed fresh ground white wheat for the flour, only used 2 cups quick cooking oats, 1/2 cinnamon 1/2 nutmeg, then added 1/3 cup raisins to half of the recipe and a handful of chocolate chips to the other half, baked 9 minutes and they were perfect.  Didn't put in fridge-couldn't wait! Used a #20 scoop and got 20 large cookies. Hubby loved them.  Thanks for the recipe, it will definitely go into my notebook of favorites to hand down to my daughter.

Great tasting cookies! I prefer them soft and chewy. I did flatten the cookies a little before putting them in the oven since they don't spread very much. I baked them in my oven for 9 minutes and let them cool. I added raisins to the second batch I made and love them even more.

"These were the best cookies I've had in a long time." - My husband. I followed the directions to make the dough exactly and then added chocolate chips to half the batch and white chocolate chips and craisins to the other half. The taste and texture were awesome and I was really appreciative of a simple recipe without a mile-long list of ingredients! I'll be making these again!

Great recipe!  Very nice flavor, substantial texture, and easy to make.  However, I would not describe them as "soft."  I liked the texture but really found it more chewy and crunchy.

We made 3 adjustments:
- Replaced 1/2 c. of white sugar with Splenda.  Next time, I'll replace all the white sugar with Splenda (but still use regular brown sugar).
- Added 1 cup mixed chocolate and butterscotch chips (yum).
- Baked for 12-14 minutes (at 8-10 mins, they were still raw).

I will make these again and experiment with adding a bit more cinnamon along with raisins and toasted pecans.  

Thanks for sharing this classic, "go-to" recipe.

AWESOME!!!!  I have NEVER been able to bake a cookie in my life.....until now!!!!  This was the best cooking that I have ever tasted!  My children love them just as much as I do.  I could not wait to post my rating.  I will admit that I did not wait the hour to  put them in the fridge.  Maybe it was more like 20 minutes for the first batch, and then I made up more cookie sheets and threw them in the fridge while the first ones baked.  They were all the same. But I think that I would not have had the same results without some type of cooling.  Also, these batter does get very "thick" as others have suggested.  I was lucky to have plastic gloves and mixed it by hand.  And I used the exact amount of sugar and would do so every time.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I have tried several different oatmeal cookie recipes.  I finally found a soft chewy oatmeal cookie.  The name says it all.  I just made these this am for my husband to take on his business trip.  I had to make a second batch b/c we ate so many of them already!  Thanks for the recipe Bittersweet1.  This is a keeper!!

Excellent!  I added dried cranberries and pecans also.  I baked them for 11 minutes on my air bake cookie sheet, and they turned out perfectly soft and chewy.  I didn't refrigerate or flatten them.  I always use parchment paper, and I just dropped them right off the spoon. I'm saving this recipe to use again.

These were very good and turned out perfectly just spooned and flattened a bit and baked for 10 min. (soft) or 12 (a bit crispier). The 4 stars is because they are WAY too sweet--I think you could reduce the brown sugar by half and maybe even the white sugar, too, particularly if you add sweet mix-ins.  They hurt my teeth, but hubby loved them. Like he said, "They are really good. They are too sweet for oatmeal cookies but they are good!" He doesn't like oatmeal cookies and I do, so they worked fine for him!  I was looking for something a bit less sweet.

These came out wonderful! I added 1 cup of Craisins (soaked in warm water for about 30 minutes). They were perfect and got rave reviews. I made no other changes other then adding the cranberries.

These are outstanding. We used half whole wheat flour and half white, and did not flatten the dough with a fork.

I didn't want to give up on this recipe so I tried it again tonight and they are perfect! So yummy! and in case you are wondering what I did differently here's EXACTLY what I did; I used margarine instaed of butter, I used ALL brown sugar and liquid honey instead of vanilla. As for the steps, I turned on oven just before I started to mix (thats right, before chilling the dough) I creamed the egg, brown sugar and margarine until it looked like frosting, mixed the dry ingredients by spoon THEN I mixed the dry into the wet ingredients 1/4 bowl at a time and mixed each 1/4 really well, once I finished that step I mixed 1 cup of quick oats in at a time mixing well. I let chill for about 50 minutes. I sprayed the cookie sheet with butter flavored Pam and rolled dough into ping-pong sized balls, flattened them to 1/4 inch thick with bottom of a glass and topped with mini choclate chips and another batch with frozen blueberries. Be sure that when you are making these that you take them out when the edges brown, if you have ever made sugar cookies before that is the browning you are looking for! Now that my boyfriend has caught a whif of whats going on in the kitchen, I wonder how long these cookies will last this time......?

Fantastic!  I made this recipe and the Quaker recipe to compare.  This one was a lot better.  I expected them to taste the same or the Quaker recipe to beat this one.  I think refrigerating the cookies made a big difference.  I made both recipes when it was in the low 80's outside so maybe that's why the Quaker one turned out flat and didn't have the great texture and appearance this recipe had.  Both tasted good but I preferred this one because of texture.  This one does have more salt and sugar though...

I am not a big cookie fan but this is good!Had lots of excellant reviews and i was skeptical but let me tell you listen to them. I love to bake and give it away and this will be next on my list!

I just wanted to let everyone know that this recipe is very easy and is the best oatmeal cookie, it says soft and chewy. I followed the repice to the letter. I do like mine a little more spicy so I added 1 more teaspoon of cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon of both clove and freshly grated nutmeg.  They were absolutely divine. I will be using this recipe from now on in my x-mas cookie boxs for my friends and family!

These are really good, best oatmeal cookies I've ever made.  I added my own likings,dried cranberries and coconut.  They look like the kind you will find at bakeries and coffee houses and taste crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Yum...they are really great

Awesome! Just like everyone before me, I think these cookies are the best ones I have ever had or made! I don't generally like oatmeal cookies much because they never seem to taste better than good ole choc chip, but these are soo good! I made mine with Whole Wheat Flour and added about 2 cups of raisins that I plumped with water ( didnt know about the egg/vanilla thing) I chilled about 2 hours and used a cookie ball scooper, I also followed others recommendations to not flatten, so, being Lazy I didn't. they flattene on their own but not too much.looks great, tastes even better. Also thought I'd mention that I use an electric oven in case it helps anyone.

Good tasting cookie - KEY is to not over cook - only cook 8-9 minutes even if you think they are not done.  I made that mistake on my first batch and they came out hard. The second batch is really good.

I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies tasted good but mine turned out really thin, flat and not particularly pretty. I also baked another recipe of chocolate chip oatmeal cookies and they were thick and beautiful, so, I know my ingredients were fresh. In spite of the way they look, they are soft and do taste really good.

Very yummy recipe. Cookies were very moist, flavorful and freeze like a dream. No need to add nuts or raisins to this recipe....cookies are perfect without them. I highly recommend lining the cookie sheets with parchment paper instead of greasing the sheets.

This is the 2nd time making these cookies. The first time I followed the directions completely. They turned out nice and soft. I made them again today. However  I decided to make some changes and see how they turned out. I cut the sugar in half and used half butter and half shortening. They turned out great and will always use this recipe for oatmeal cookies. Thanks for the recipe.

Hands down the best recipe! I followed the direction but added raisins and did not grease the cookie sheet & my cookies came out fantastic! I also just spoon drop my cookies in lieu of flatten them w/a fork. My family insisted that these are our new "must have" Christmas cookies. First time making them and it won't be my last.

Great oatmeal cookie recipe! Aside from not adding nuts or raisins (or the extra sugar right at the end) I didn't change anything and the cookies came out perfect. Very moist, chewy cookie even after they cool!

This is a great, great base recipie. 

I agree with others that it is unnecessary to press down. I also add a bit of milk of the batter seems to dry. I have never refrigerated the dough. 

You can add almost anything to it and it turns out fantastic. I normally add a cup of both raisins and chocolate chips. My family requests these over and over!!

I love this cookie! I was looking for an oatmeal cookie like my granny's and I found it! Crispy on the edges and soft on the inside. Cook a little longer for a crispy cookie.

These are really good. At first i thought they were going to be hard (I only cooked them 9 minutes) because when they first cool they are hard. After a little while of sitting though they get soft. I like the flavor but did not do the sugar on the fork thing for they were sweet enough..I also went just a little less sugar and used about a tablespoon of honey. I think I might try all honey next time to make them healthier.

I've made this recipe a few times. To make them moist and chewy, I add a pkg of vanilla instant  pudding mix (no additional liquid) and top with melted butter (a must). I also add a half tsp all spice to up the flavor. Make sure you flatten the cookies, especially if you make em big like I do. If your cookie has a salty-chemically taste than you used too much baking soda. The more baking soda, the further cookies spread

Delicious and perfectly crispy. I used Quaker Quick Oats, halved the recipe and added a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. I also did not chill the dough or flatten it with a fork. Cookies turned out great.

Just tried Jan 1st, 2015...magically delicious!! I left out the salt and vanilla extract. Used half of all ingredients since I'm only cooking for 2. Instead of regular oats I used instant maple and brown sugar oats 4 packs....and waaa laa!!! Did not fork them left them walnut size and baked only 10 minutes exactly. Very soft and warm delicious with soy milk...;)

Originally I gave this recipe 4 stars because the first batch I made seemed to be lacking flavor. However, upon request I made it a second time, and it turned out much better somehow! I would strongly recommend adding raisins for added sweetness and a more interesting texture. Also, I subbed canola oil for half the butter and that worked fine. Instead of flattening the cookies with a fork, I just pressed them down a little with my finger - that way they were still super chewy, but cooked through. These truly are the ideal oatmeal cookie - nice taste (and you can go heavy on the spices. I even added a little nutmeg), and they bake perfectly. Would recommend!

Love this recipe! So easy and always perfect. I do half wheat and half regular flour. Add a tsp of baking powder. Use half quick oats and half regular oats. Sometimes chocolate chips or raisins. But even plain they are delicious. I flatten some (no added sugar needed in fork) and leave some in a ball so everybody gets to pick a cookie to their liking. Also, I use ice cream scoops to make it easy and mess free (awesome tip given to me when I was first making cookies and frustrated with having my fingers and hands sticky with dough while rolling them). And place parchment paper on cookie sheet so there is no need to grease it. In my oven, it takes about 12 to 13 minutes to bake, but I assume each oven is different. Totally recommended recipe! It yields about 3 dozen medium size cookies, or more if adding chocolate, raisins, etc.

Just finished making these and they are absolutely delicious! !! Soft in the middle and crunchy around the edges.   I didn't change anything, but I did add raisins to 1/4 of the batter.  I  don't think they will last through the night! !

I loved this. The dough was almost better than the cookies! I replaced the egg with 1 tsp flax meal + 3 tsp water, mixed separately. I used ground quick oats (put through the food processor). I added a spoonful of coconut oil after cooking the first batch, they were a little dry for my taste. I also added a handful of chocolate chips.

I thought this recipe was to sweet so I cut the brown sugar in half and a quarter cup of the white sugar out - perfect after that.  Cutting both sugars in half would be the max.  After cutting the sugars down really enjoyed the cookies. Also added another 1/2 cup of oatmeal to the recipe and soft raisins.

To die for! Don't grease your cookie sheet and don't flatten these, in fact I formed balls with the dough and they turned out wonderful. Also important to not overcook.

Too sweet!  And too much cinnamon!  Followed the directions as written.  Texture was good.  Baked for 8 minutes and they were chewy (as desired) and not crispy or hard.  Didn't taste like a cookie but like chewy cinnamon flavored sugar.  In contrast, I also made the Easy Sugar Cookies submitted by Stephanie and they were perfect.

Everyone loved them! I only used half the sugar (1/2C white and brown) and added some dry fruit. These are GREAT with fresh fruit and yogurt! I didn't not refrigerate the dough first AND I accidentally melted my butter but they still came out great! Next time I'll try with some agave.

Just made these and they were awesome.  I think they were moist enough for an oatmeal cookie.  I ran out of quick cooking oats and also used Quaker Multi Grain hot cereal for the rest.  There is no way I could wait 5 minutes to let them cool!  I did not flatten them.  They are a tad sweet so may cut the sugar back the next time.

9/4/13 - I can't even tell you how many times I've made this recipe.  The cookies are awesome.  The only thing I changed was reducing the white sugar to 2/3 cup.

Very good taste.  I didn't have any raisins so added chopped pecans, different but good.  Ended up with nearly 4 dozen cookies, that must have been a doubled recipe.  Will make again.

I only used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Also added butterscotch and chocolate chips and they tasted amazing.  Rule of thumb with any cookie recipe is to cut the sugar in half.  It makes a softer cookie.

A wonderful oatmeal cookie with a crunchy outside and chewy interior. I used my cookie scoop that measures about a heaping tablespoon and got 3 dozen cookies. Cooked each batch of 12 for 10 minutes.

Perfect as-is and with additions. Tried it both ways and loved it all. The instructions were spot on - 10 min exactly in my oven and then allowed them to cool a few minutes on the pan. Absolutely perfect. NOTE: Don't hesitate to substitute old-fashioned oats for the quick-cooking oats.

These cookies were delicious! I made these for Christmas and did three different additions, raisins, craisins, and raisinets. No adjustments of any kind were needed, these are perfect the way they are!

I followed the recipe exactly, the cookies were not soft or chewy. They were hard and had very little flavour.

Great recipe, a total of 1 cup of sugar (1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown) is more than enough for sweetness. It can be even further reduced, to a total of 3/4 cups of sugar. I added some chopped dried apricots and chopped toasted walnuts. Great cookie, chewy, soft, filling. Baking time 10 min.

I tried a different Oatmeal-Raisin recipe first and I did not like them at all. So I did a little research and found this recipe with the step by step video direction. WOW! I loved it it has just the right flavors! I added a few cups of raisins and they were great! I was afraid that I would not have enough so I doubled the recipe....Was NOT necessary I still have a good two dozen cookies left over after setting five dozen cookies out at a pot luck! Will make again.....maybe with some nuts next time.

Fresh out of the oven and incredible! I split the batch- raisins in one half, chocolate chips in the other. 
I did chill the dough, but didn't flatten it. The cookies spread out just fine without any help.
This recipe is a keeper.

These cookies were great. My girls enjoyed making them. I did follow the dips that others suggest. Dipping the fork in suger and leaving them thicker made them chewy.

Perfect base recipe!!! Due to health concerns, I substituted half of the butter with canola oil (just mixed the canola oil in with the softened butter), and results were excellent! I added raisins and chopped walnuts. Since I was too anxious to wait for one hour before baking them, I put the dough in the freezer while the oven was preheating (10 minutes or so) and they were easy to handle. I also skipped the rolling and flattening with a fork dipped in sugar part - just placed walnut-sized mounds of dough on to the cookie sheet and flattened them with the back of the spoon. I had to bake them 9-10 minutes for slightly golden edges and very chewy center. Delicious!

This recipe is perfect! Soft, chewy and lightly spiced. I added *raisins the second time around, and they were fantastic! 

*(when adding raisins to baked goods, it's always best to simmer them on the stove for a few minutes in a little bit of water first, to plump them- then drain and cool before adding)

Thank you Bittersweet1! This recipe worked out great. Oatmeal cookies aren't even my fave but we wanted dessert one night and only had the ingredients on hand for these. I was amazed! Keeper for sure, and they even earned me a backrub from hubby. Thanks again!

P.S., Only things I changed were I didn't have time to refrigerate (although I can see how refrigerating would make the dough much easier to handle) and I didn't dip the fork in sugar.

These cookies are incredible, a big hit with the entire family, even those of us who don't usually enjoy cookies. I made this recipe as is and it turned out great. I added craisins rather then raisins though.

This cookie is amazing! I have been looking for a oatmeal cookie that stays soft days after baked.  We really like raisins in ours, so I added 1 cup of raisins (soaked in hot water for about 30 minutes then patted dry).  Upon reading others reviews, I tried not refrigerating for an hour, and made a few cookies, then I tried refrigerating and not smooshing the cookie down, and made a few cookies, finally I refrigerated and smooshed the cookie down.  My husband and I both agree, the smooshed, refrigerated cookie didn't spread as far therefore it was the moistest and tasted the best.  I won't ever try another oatmeal raisin cookie recipe!!! FANTASTIC!!

First time making these- they were super easy and taste great. We ended up making a sort of homemade oatmeal cream pies by sandwiching cool whip between 2 cookies we warmed up in the microwave. The kids devoured them.

I added 3/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1 cup of currents.  I would use 1/2 cup less rolled oats next time.  Also, I rolled them into balls and passed them through turbinado sugar.  They were a bit dry and crumbly unfortunately, which is why I'd use less oatmeal.

Made the cookies exactly as the recipe called for. I have never gotten so many compliments on a cookie before, especially the softness of the cookie.  One thing, unless you are making huge cookies, you will get closer to 40 cookies than 24.

I'm not much of a baker but these turned out really well. Since my cookies always end up flattening out and spreading quite a bit, I didn't press them down with a fork. I took them out after 10 minutes, and they were still really gooey and floppy, but they firmed out nicely while retaining a chewy center. My only minor complaint is that they weren't quite sweet enough for me, so next time I will add some raisins or choc chips. Really good though. Thanks!

This was an easy recipe.  When I got to adding the oats I realized that I only had 1 1/2 cups.  I saw that other people skimped on the oats so I tried it too.  I added dried cranberries and coconut.... they were awesome.  I got lots of compliments and I am not a very good baker.  Try adding the cranberries and coconut for sure!

I added boiled raisins and it really made a difference in the 'moistness' of these cookies.  I have made these a few times now and never chill or flatten them, i add cinnamon and cardamom as well. Everyone loves this recipe! Will definitely make this one again!

Nice soft cookie.  Cut shortening to 3/4 c. and white sugar to 3/4 c.  I used a small scoop to dish them out, did not flatten  Added 1/3 c. chopped nuts.  Added white chips and dried cranberries to 1/2 the batter.

Turned out great!!!!  I did cut the oats down to two cups and added 1 1/2 cup of coconut and 2cups of butterscotch chips.  We love cinnamon so I upped it by 1/2 teaspoon.  Also from reading reviews I baked them right away doing drop cookies and they turned out perfect.  My best advice is don't over bake, when the edges look slightly brown take them out and let them cool they will be perfect.  My son thinks they are greatest!

Absolutely fantastic. I followed another review and only put in 1t cinnamon, but added 1/4t clove and 1/4t nutmeg, I put in some chocolate and peanut butter chips, and I did not smoosh them down. My guests couldn't stop eating them, everyone complimented the cookies and I was asked for the recipe. I only had them in the oven for 8 minutes (thank you for the comment on timing!) and it was perfect.

Lovely, simple flavor--very comforting.  After reading the reviews, I did not refrigerate the dough nor flatten with a fork, and I kept the cookies pretty small (walnut sized dough balls).  Thanks for the great recipe!  I served them warm with caramel/vanilla ice cream on top and drizzled them with chocolate fudge topping.

These were outstanding.  My 16yo son cooked them for 8 minutes in a convection oven at 350 degrees.  Our whole family of 7 loves them - even the die-hard "chocolate chip only" cookie lovers of the family!  He made them exactly like the recipe except he didn't press them down with a fork other than a tiny bit.  Cooked for 8 min in a convection oven at 350 degrees.  This is will be our "go-to" oatmeal cookie recipe from now on.

Really great oatmeal cookies.  As noted in other reviews, to keep cookies soft cook for 8 minutes and be aware that cooking time can be affected by the cookie sheet you use.  To make these cookies even better I added chopped pecans, cranberries (chopped them up in the food processor) and chocolate chips to the batter.

The best oatmeal cookies I've ever made. They do stay soft! I added chopped walnuts to the batter which enhanced the flavour. I'll make them again.

I followed the ingredients exactly, only doubling the salt because I was using Kosher salt (so good, much better than your average salt, imo), and these turned out SO GOOD! 

NOTE: I didn't chill the dough mixture in the fridge first, I didn't squish them with a sugared fork - I left them like little balls the size of walnuts instead and they were PERFECT, and perfectly sweet.  I also cooked them for 11 - 12 mins instead of 10 which made them nice and chewy.  Oh, and I added chocolate chips - I'm thinking raisins would've been delicious too. I also cut the recipe in half and it made at least 18 cookies - maybe more (I'm a dork, I didn't count them, but there were two pans full!) - Anyways, these were so good and super easy to make! I mixed it all by hand and it was easy-schmeasy! 5 stars!

I really thought these were tasty but they weren't the soft cookies I had hoped for.  They turned out very thin and kinda cripsy on the edges.  I think if I hadn't pushed them down with the fork, maybe they would've been puffier and softer, but I don't know.  Maybe I'll try it next time. :)  But they were very tasty! :D

These were great good texture on the crust and chewy on the inside I did change up the ingredients. Instead of adding salt I used sweet cream salted butter. It made quite a difference from the first time I made it. Overall I always use this recipe but just add different toppings ex.(chocolate chip,peanutbutter chips,raisin,walnuts).

This was pretty simple and very yummy. I added walnuts, raisins, and dried cranberries to one batch and made one batch plain. My husband ate about 9 of the batch with the raisin mixture and my finicky eater ate some of the plain. Thanks!!!!

While these taste great, they are no means soft.  I only cooked them for 8 min in hopes to make them a little on the softer side.   I also skipped the refrigeration step.

These came out great! I did sub bread flour instead of AP Flour. Also Did not press them down and I added pomegranate craisns, they came out amazing!
Also, I used rolled oats, before adding them to the mixture I toasted them over low heat (thank you Alton Brown) I think that really brought out the flavor and chewy

This recipe was awesome! I did make several changes.  I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored Crisco.  This change as well as taking the cookies out of the oven after 8 minutes and allowing them to remain on hot cookie sheet for 2 minutes made them very soft and chewy!!  I added 2 cups of mini chocolate chips.. very tasty with a nice cinnamon flavor.

These cookies were really great! Take the advice to only bake them until the edges are brown about 8 minutes at 375 (the inside will look like it needs longer but take them out anyway!). They set up really nice as they are cooling and are moist and chewy! Did some with raisins and without, and used whole oats chopped in a food processor. Delicious!

These came out excellent! I did reduce the white sugar to 1/2 cup. I used this recipe to make thumbprint cookies: make an indentation in the top of the dough ball, then add a spoonful of raspberry or cherry preserves. I got a ton of compliments on these cookies and there were none left by the end of the party!

Excellent flavor and texture.  The cookies remained soft after they cooled.  I divided one recipe into 3 separate bowls.  I left one as the original recipe as written.  In another bowl I added chopped cashews, shredded coconut and coconut flavoring, in the remaining bowl I added craisins and chopped walnuts.  All variations turned out perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Made these this weekend. Really good. Great flavor. I had no problem with the dough after being refrigerated, used a small cookie scoop. The dough was somewhat dry to work with, but bake up moist and chewy. Thanks for a great recipe:)

Wow-this is the best recipe! I can't stop eating them! We made a bunch of different types of cookies for the holidays yesterday, and mixed up a double batch of these, but got too tired to bake them.....so I got them out today to ball them up and bake 'em. Oh so good! These are my husbands favorite type of cookies and I will be using this recipe from now on!

Just try this cookies and love them.  We substituted 1 cup of Bob's Red Mill organic High Fiber Hot Cereal for 1 cup of the oatmeal and love it.  Added chocolate chips we did not chill the dough and had not problems.

My whole family just love these cookies... They were so good that my sister ask me to send her the recipes, and her family just went crazy over them... then her girl friend, ask for them too! So your Oatmeal Cookies are the no#1 in our family... Happy Holidays!

Very good! Maybe a little too much sugar, next time I will cut that down a bit. Different than any other oatmeal cookie I have ever had. Great with craisins. I cut the recipe in half due to what I had on hand yet still ended up with 24 good sized cookies!

These are okay, but certainly not delicious.  I did find them most if you are absolutely vigilant about taking them out before they brown.  The flavor, though, is only so-so.

These cookies were really good. I made as instructed but I did not refrigerate the mix before forming and they still came out good. I left one batch in for 10 minutes and they came out soft and chewy in the middle - just the way I like it. I left another batch in for 12 minutes and they came out crunchy - my husband likes crunchy. All in all the flavor was great.

Fantastic texture and flavor! I used these in Halloween-shaped baking molds and while it didn't capture visual details in the molds because of the texture of the dough it worked really well in the bone-shaped mold! Since the cookies are soft some of the bone-shapes broke, but that was thematically consistent.

Very tasty cookies, and very soft. My only problem with them is that they flattened out a bit too much. I didn't flatten them with a fork nor did I roll them into balls. I just used a spoon like  a drop cookie and they still flattened out more than I would like. I was expecting them to be a bit "fluffier". It's a very tasty and easy recipe, however.

Whoa, way too sweet for me. Great recipe for chewy and soft cookies but it's too much sugar. I tried this using half the sugar and it was just right. Oatmeal cookies have a great nutty flavor thats good with just that dash of sweetness..

Great recipe. Added 1 1/2 cups chopped dates to add to the chewiness of these great cookies. A terrific addition if you like dates.

Hands down, the best oatmeal cookies I've ever made, but I did make a few changes. I used margarine instead of butter because that's what I had on hand. I used only 1 tsp. of cinnamon and added 1/2 tsp. of allspice to the flour mixture.  I also borrowed the idea of soaking the raisins in the beaten egg and vanilla from another recipe. I did use walnut-sized amounts of cookie dough, but only flattened them slightly and didn't bother putting sugar on the tops.  I didn't so much follow the cooking time, I just removed the cookies from the oven when the edges turned a light golden brown and the cookies came out delicious, chewy and perfect. Yum!

I only eat soft, doughy cookies and these were the best ones I have ever made! I took other people's advice and cut the sugar down and made 1/2 a batch with chocolate chips and the other 1/2 with raisins. I still found them to be a bit too sweet, but they are so soft!!! I also didn't flatten them with a fork, and they ended up flattening by themselves. I am so excited to have found a cookie recipe that's so easy to make.  It's a keeper!

This is the best recipe I have tried to oatmeal cookies. To have them chewy in the middle,just roll into balls-don't flatten. They cook perfectly.

Great Recipe. I added craisins in half of the batch and chocolate chips in the other half. They were delicious. I left them in mounds on the pan and they were plump and very moist cookies. If you want a chewy cookie just leave them in little balls. Thanks for a great recipe. They were gone in no time!!!

Oh my gosh!!! All I can say is amazing!!! These are the best!! I made the recipe almost exactly. I added 3/4c. caramel bits and 3/4c. dried apple slices; chopped and made them into caramel apple oatmeal cookies. I also only left them in the fridge for about 10mins and didn't smash them down before baking and they flattened out perfectly! I will definitely be making these again!!

These cookies are delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a pinch of cardamon.  I also used rolled oats because I don't keep quick cooking on hand, and the cookies still turned out fabulously.  Only problem I will have is not eating them all the same day.

I usually read the reviews before I make something but I didn't this time.  I missed the bit in the instructions about flattening the cookies before you bake them.  Mine came out very flat anyway.  They spread quite a bit, and I'd chilled them for about an hour and a half.  They also took longer to bake for me - 13 minutes and they were brown on the bottom and very chewy.  They were what I was looking for - a nice chewy, sweet oatmeal cookie.  Thank you!

This is a great recipe. I'm sure I will be able to make at least 3 dozens of medium sized cookies. If you are in a tight budget but still prefer choco chips on it, you may place several semisweet chips after you have created balls of the batter. I suggest not to press the ball with fork as it will eventually flatten on its own while baking.

This is the best recipe I have ever ran accrosed! I did change the butter to shortening and added half of fourth Tsp. of ground cloves. They were moist and just perfect. Butter would have made them taste even better but, I think they would have been drier and would have dried out sooner if they are not eaten right away. Thank you for this wonderful recipe, it is now a favorite and my search for a good oatmeal cookie recipe is over.

Wonderfully soft, yummy cookies, with a hint of cinnamon! I did not chill the dough, grease the cookie sheets, or flatten with a fork, and the cookies still turned out perfectly.

SOOOoo good will now be a permanent in my recipe book. For those having gooey problems first off press the cookies down as is stated in the recipe and second they will seem gooey when they are straight out of the oven. i used a toothpick inserted in the center of the cookie it came out clean so i knew it was done. once the cookies cool off they are not gooey they are firm on the outside and soft inside.

I made these in hopes of going into labour. I added chocolate chips rather than raisins. I was very fortunate to go into labour the next morning and these cookies were an amazing treat through out recovery. Very very delicious, chewy and yummy. I will definitely be making these again and again.

Very good & easy cookie!!  I didn't freeze the dough, I just spoon dropped on the cookie sheet right after.  I also didn't press flat with a fork and it came out chewy and a little crispy on the outside.  Perfect!  I have this saved for next time!

This is my new go-to oatmeal cookie recipe. It is awesome plain or with raisins! I did everything as the recipe calls for, except I used rolled oats instead of quick cook for a slightly chewier texture. Overall these cookies were a hit in my house!

Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect. Very nice fluffy firm cookie. Oh but I did add chocolate chips. I prefer raisins and think they would have been better but my boys were demanding the chocolate chips. This recipe is a keeper.

if you're following the recipe to a T, your cookies will come out quite thin. i'm going to remake these once my family has eaten the batch i've just made. they like the flavor, but, they prefer thicker oatmeal cookies - more to bite into. in order for the cookies to spread out less, i'm going to reduce the amount of butter and sugar, possibly replacing some of the sugar with honey. i'll be back!

If you love soft and chewy cookies, this is the one for you!  These were very easy to make and are delicious.  I didn't chill the dough and they still turned out fine. The sugar on the top was a bit much but still good.  This was the first batch but I'm looking forward to adding chocolate chips, raisins or peanut butter on the next batch.

The only thing I didn't do was flatten them. This made them soft and chewy. But my cookie scoop is pretty small too. I think cookies the size the instructions want would need to be flattened. I got 4 1/2 dozen, not 2 dozen. DAY TWO: These are still amazing. I'm glad I only brought four with me to work. Otherwise there wouldn't be any left for my hubby.

These very soft and hearty! I enjoyed the texture, although I did substitue half of the butter for apple sauce and lower the sugar amount for a lower calorie version. I added white chocolate chips and dried cranberries.

These were just OK. When I see a title that says "soft" I think "cake like" which these were not. I also felt like more spice was needed.

A very good, basic recipe...very similar to the one found in the "Joy of Cooking". I liked the touch of cinnamon, which was not in the "JofC" book. I cut down on the oats (2 and 1/2 cups) in favor of a 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. Thanks for sharing :)

Excellent.  Followed recipe exactly, added raisins and chopped walnuts.  Needed 8 mins. 30 seconds and came out perfect.  Flattened them a little before baking but did not dip fork in sugar!

Subbed applesauce/oil for the butter (because I was out!), doubled everything except the sugar and used all brown sugar, about 2 1/2 cups. So good! Made mine big and they were a tad crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside!

Delicious cookies, and I made them with gluten-free flour and oats. They still tasted great! I also cut the white sugar in half, and added a half cup of golden raisins. I thought they were great, my parents both thought the sugar could still have been cut more.

You really don't need to refrigerate or press this dough down with any more sugar. The cookies are sweet enough as is and bake really nicely. Just as some other reviewers said, take them out a bit early for chewier cookies. These are really delicious with raisins.

hands-down one of the best cookie recipes i've found to date! they are the perfect mix of chewy on the inside & slightly crisp on the outside. i omitted most of the cinnamon & added butterscotch chips. as other reviewers said, there is no need to refrigerate the dough before baking, it is good to go right after mixing.

This recipe is a keeper. The only thing I didnt like was letting it sit for a hour thats to long to wait for a cookie, but It was worth the wait in the end, this was so easy to make and so delish! It needs the rasins and nuts to make it 5 stars . Thats the only thing I recommed. God Bless and thanks for sharing!

These are great!  I didn't have enough oats (and only the old fashioned kind), so I used only 2 cups of oats and it turned out well.  I'll try 3 c next time (like the recipe calls for)!  I did not refrigerate the dough for an hour, nor did I flatten them with a fork and it was just fine.  I bet white chocolate chips would be perfect in this recipe!

Wonderful recipe.  The quick oats make them nice and chewy without the large pieces of oat.  Some reviewers argues they were crispy.  I learned from America's Test Kitchen that the secret to soft oatmeal cookies is: 1) roll them in bog round balls then flatten a bit with your hands. 2) Take them out of the oven when they don't look quite done - just barely golden on the bottom and not at all on top.

My favorite favorite oatmeal cookie recipe.  Even my husband, who claims to not like oatmeal cookies, begs me to make these.  They are consistantly soft- I do not flatten before baking.  Also, they store well in tupperware for a few days. Great base recipe, delicious on its own, but add ins work fabulous-we like cranberries with pistachio-white chocolate!

These are amazing!  I followed recipe, but did not do the fork.  I left it in rolled balls.  I added 1 cup sweetened coconut, 2 cups semi sweet chocolate chips, and 1 cup chopped walnuts.  They turned out fantastic.  Soft and moist.  My batch yielded about 4 dozen, but my balls were about 1.5 inches big.  I will definitely make these again.

Great oatmeal cookie!! I agree with some other people's posting - I do not press my cookies down flat, doing that does tend to make them a wider and more crunchy cookie - I left mine in little balls for about 10mins and let them cool completely. Came out perfectly chewy. I will omit the salt next time, I use salted butter and I think I can do with out the added salt. Also add a little bit of nutmeg to give them a bit more flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

Great cookies, the only thing was for me the dough seemed reaaaallly dry when mixed so I added 2 tbsp of honey to make them a little stickier and less dry. It may have been my measuring was off a little but they came out good!

These taste wonderful. I made these pretty much exactly to the recipe, and they came out great. I didn't flatten them with a fork; I just made them like a drop cookie. I also didn't chill them for an hour. They came out great. My whole family loves them. One of the best Oatmeal Cookie recipes I have tried.

Just took these out of the oven and they are perfect!  I only used half of the recipe and it works just as well, no alterations.  I added some shredded coconut to the tops of them before putting them in the oven, yum.  I didn't chill for an hour and they turned out perfect - slightly crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  I will make these again for sure :)

Wow - this is our new favorite cookie recipe!  Usually my kids go for chocolate chip, but we didn't have any in the house, so I went hunting for a new recipe.  To this, I added chopped dates, chopped apricots and coconut.  I flattened them just slightly, with no sugar added, and they turned out perfectly!  I'm known for my cookie-baking acumen, and these are absolutely the best I've ever made.  Thanks!!

Just made these tonight and these are fabulous! I did as others suggested and didn't refrigerate the dough or flatten. I just used a cookie scoop to drop them on a cookie sheet. I also substituted Pumpkin Pie Spice for the Cinnamon because I was really in the mood for that type of flavor and it was really good!  I cooked mine for 8 minutes and they came out really soft in the center but crisp on the outside; PERFECT!

wow! Don't tell my husband, but I'm in love with a cookie!  Like other reviewers I didn't flatten, but otherwise followed the recipe- added raisins.  So amazingly good.

I am only giving this 4 stars because the original directions say to flatten with a fork and place on greased cookie sheet.  I did that with the first batch and sadly the bottom burned.  Second batch I left as a ball and used an ungreased sheet.  Much much better!  I also put some chocolate chips in some of the dough. Delish.

These are easily the best cookies I've ever made. I've made these a few times and always get rave reviews. Since I like to add mildly sweetened dark chocolate chips and raisins, I usually leave out the white sugar completely to compensate for the added sweeteness. The batter is so thick and holds its shape so well that I have never found the need to refrigerate the dough first, so I skip that step entirely. Also, I like thick, moist cookies, so I also skip the flattening step and just make roughly shaped balls out of them.

Heavenly! This is a perfect recipe. I made chocolate chip, original, and chocolate chip with peanut butter and they were fantastic! I used Smart Balance (butter), and 1/2 cup of all natural sugar with 1/2 cup of regular white sugar ( i didn't have enough natural sugar). I also made them a bit bigger then walnut size and baked for 11min. My husband loved them and even took some to his work to share with his health nut buddies! They loved and approved =) Can't wait to make them again. Definitely a keeper! Thanx for sharing

This is such an easy recipe and the cookies alway come out great! The cookies are usually gone within an hour of me making them. I've also added in Walnuts, pecans, shredded coconut, dried cranberries, chocolate chips......you can pretty much add anything to these! I also make them in 1/2 cup portions for giant cookies.

I've made these cookies at least a dozen times already and love it each time! I've found that if you live closer to the ocean making the cookies smaller (3/4 walnut) they tend to caramelize much better. Also if you want to add chocolate chips or raisins 1 1/2 cup makes the perfect balance!

This turned me into a Breakfast Cookie person!!! I saw the plate of cookies this morning and just *had* to have one with my coffee.  I cut the white sugar down by 1/2 C, and they have the perfect amount of sweetness for me. I didn't overcook them, which is amazing for my cooking. 6 minutes seemed to be the perfect amount for them in my oven/with the size I made. It was such an easy recipe too! I've never made oatmeal cookies before. I did have to use regular oats, not the quick cooking kind, and the oats *might* be underdone, but not really noticeable. I'm going to buy quick cooking oats today though :)

These cookies are seriously good.  I added walnuts and cranberries....Yummmy.  You can save some time by not flattening with a fork.  They come out looking puffy but flatten out when cooled into a beautiful cookie.

I added 1 cup of dried cranberries, 1 cup of white chocholate chips and 3/4 cup of chopped toasted almonds.  I did flatten the dough a bit before baking at 350 for 9-10 minutes.  Made almost 6 dozen cookies.  Scrumptious!

These are the best Oatmeal cookies I have ever tries, they work perfect every time, I cook them a little less time so there perfectly soft, there chewy and a little bit of crunch perfect they don't last long! Also i kind of flatten the dough down  with my hand  on the tray right before baking,so they get bigger when they cook, I also added semi-sweet chocolate chips and coconut YUMMY!

I found the cookies to be tasty right after coming out of the oven but by the next day the consistency wasn't right. I believe that they would be a lot better if there was maybe a cup less of oatmeal.

Chill the dough overnight. You can add butterscotch chips, chocolate chips, or raisins to change things up.

Wow, we loved these cookies! I experimented with adding chopped pecans and dark chocolate chips to some. The pecans really added something to them, and I'd definitely add them again. They're easy to make, and the texture is wonderful. Thanks for the great recipe! We'll definitely make them again.

This is the best oatmeal cookie! I did not make  them with raisins or nut, but I actually didn't think they needed them. I like that they are not spicy or crispy like many oatmeal cookie recipes. Make sure to refridgerate, as suggested, as the cookie will bake up a little thicker and not flat. The whole recipe makes 4 dozen with a cookie scoop. In order for them to be soft they must be removed from oven about a minute or so before they are completely done, as I do with most cookie recipes. I also found that 10 seconds in the microwave will make them soft again. They taste great out of the oven or really good the next day with coffee.

Fantastic!  I cut down on the fat a little by substituting half the butter for applesauce!  I cut back a teensy bit on the sugars and it was still a little too sweet for my taste, I think I'll cut the sugar back a little more next time I make these!  Oh!  Also, I did not chill my first batch before baking and they still turned out wonderful!  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Hey, these are great!!  I halved the recipe, but otherwise did not change anything. I was only able to chill them for about 45 minutes, and they turned out great. Slightly crispy outside, chewy inside! Yay! Thanks :)

Don't overbake these - my first batch looked 'not quite done' at 8 minutes but they WILL darken up after they come out of the oven. First batch was overcooked, after that, they were perfect!   I added about a cup and a half each chocolate chips and dried cranberries, probably could've done half a cup less oats just because of the extra additions (lots of oats floating at the bottom of the bowl in the end).

Great recipe. These were DELICIOUS! I couldn't stop snacking on them...definitely dangerous having them around when you're on a 'diet'...

Great recipe! I followed the recipe exactly.  I added raisins to half of the batch and left the other half plain.  Both came out moist and delicious!

These were delicious and probably the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made. Thank You!! I followed the ingredients listed exactly, but added 1 cup of raisins. I also did not grease my cookie sheets and they were fine and did not stick at all.

these cookies are so delicious and easy to make!  i halved the recipe and still managed to get 28 cookies out of it.  the only changes i made were that i did not freeze the dough and i didn't flatten/sugar the tops.  i just scooped the dough onto the parchment papered cookie sheet using a tablespoon icecream-type scooper, baked for 8 minutes, cooled on pan for 5 minutes, and transferred to a baking rack to cool completely.  this is an excellent basic oatmeal cookie recipe that i will definitely be making again!

These are without a doubt the BEST oatmeal cookies I have ever made.  I made 1 batch and they were gone in a day so I had to make more.  Everyone raved about them.  Definitely a keeper for the recipe box.

YUM-MMMY!  ME COOKIE MONSTER (or "sometime snack" cookie monster)!  My fiance made these cookies and added a cup of raisins as suggested, and they came out phenomenal.  I keep stealing them as they come out of the oven.  Taste great the next day!

Yummy! These were really delicious. I used 1 cup regular flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour, plus a tablespoon of wheat germ. I only used 1 tsp of cinnamon and added 1/2 tsp of cloves. 2 cups of oats were plenty. I also added 3/4 cup shredded coconut and 1 cup cinnamon chips. Chopped almonds or pecans would have been really good in this but I didn't have any. The batter was kind of crumbly, so I did form them by hand into balls, but I did not flatten them with a fork or top them with sugar. I baked them for a full 10 minutes. I got 46 cookies out of this recipe. Less than 24 hours later, there are only four left! I will be adding this to my recipe box for sure!

Excellent recipe.  I substituted pumpkin puree for the butter and added cloves and nutmeg.  Cookies didn't spread much without the butter so flattening them with a fork was necessary--didn't dip the fork in sugar though.  Very moist, flavorful cookie.

These came out so good!  I love them!  I did use Splenda for the white sugar and 50% of the flour I substituted for whole wheat flour (can't even tell!!!)  Threw in a few raisins.  Did NOT chill.  First ones I rolled into balls and got puffier cookies.  Second tray I rolled into balls and flattened slightly and got a slightly flatter cookie.  By no means did I end up with a thin cookie...so maybe refrigeration is not needed, or I got lucky :)

Perfectly chewy and moist...I added chocolate chips and omitted the cinnamon, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  My cookies did, however, take approximately 13-14 minutes to bake.

Love them!  Have put raisins and also crainsins and white chocolate chips in them.  All really good and super moist.  I don't press them down so that they will stay this way.

AWESOME!  I used the exact ingredients and amounts and they turned out perfect. The only modification was, I used a glass mixing bowl with 2 sticks of Blue Bonnet butter, I added the sugars and I set the oven to 200° and warmed bowl with ingredients for 10 minutes then mixed. I have read a lot of comments that mention they don't refrigerate the dough after completion, this is a mistake. You refrigerate the dough for at least the hour to make it less sticky so you can handle in your hands when you roll up balls. The key is to space them far enough apart, the 2 inches in the directions is adjustable depending on how big you roll your balls, trail and error. The walnut size suggested isn't universal, some walnuts are bigger than others. I made mine the size of a super-ball. Remember them? Those tiny rubber balls that would bounce really high, bad visual I know. Once I rolled the balls and spaced them on sheets after I sprayed the sheets with baking oil, I then used a small spoon and I lightly sprayed the bottom of it with the baking oil spray every other cookie. Only press down a little, DO NOT flatten balls or the cookies will be too flat. At 375° I baked them 11-13 minutes, just enough to make the edges of the cookies a medium brown. Cool on sheets for 5, then move to wire rack to cool 15. Perfection.

Best homemade cookie I have ever made. I added 1/2 cup of raisins and 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts. Also, I added close to a tablespoon of vanilla extract and only used 2 1/4 cups of quick oats. Oh! And I used 1/2 cup of light brown sugar and 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar. My cookies were not dry at all!

a week later and these cookies are still soft!  i did change up the recipe a bit and used splenda for baking in place of the white sugar and all whole wheat flour.  Because I have found that whole wheat flour sometimes makes a recipe dryer and my family likes soft cookies, i used half shortening for the butter.  I don't know but it's been my experience that butter makes a crisper cookie while shortening or margarine make a softer one so i just went with what i know.  i added mini chocolate chips to half the batter and dried cranberries to the other half and this recipe was sweet enough for the cranberries.

This recipe was awesome! I've only really tried two other recipes...the quaker oats one and mom's treaure island cookies.  But this one was definitely the softest and chewiest!  I was craving oatmeal cookies so I made them and they turned out great.  I added some semi-chocolate chips to satisfy my chocolate craving too. I will definitely keep this in my recipe box. Thanks! =)

Great recipe!  I needed a basic recipe for oatmeal so that I could "play" with it a bit.  I added raisins, chocolate chips and some walnuts!  I didn't refrigerate them and didn't flatten them with a fork in sugar.  Just dropped them normally.  They came out great!

All I can say is WOW! OMG! I wasn't going to review this recipe at all. I didn't even have an Allrecipes account, but decided to just to let everyone know how great these are. I made these and tried the dough, just to make sure they tasted amazing, and I couldn't even stop eating the dough! However, I did manage to stop myself from eating all of the dough and baked some off. These are HANDS DOWN THE BEST oatmeal cookies I have ever had and ever will have. This is a PERFECT recipe! Thanks sooo much for sharing this with the rest of the world!

These are great cookies! The whole family loved them and they did not last even two days! Changes: I did not freeze the dough, nor did I flatten them. I just mixed, and spoon dropped. I also added raisins. Be sure not to over bake and they will be soft and chewy!

I made these cookies with the following modifications: used whole wheat flour instead of regular flour, added 1 cup of chocolate chips and omitted the cinnamon.  Came out divine - these will be my go-to cookies. Thanks!

Really soft cookies!  Delicious!  I added milk chocolate chips too, but I don't even think these cookies would need them.  Oh, almost forgot.. I used wheat flour and they were awesome!

Excellent recipe!  I slightly flattened them with the palm of my hand instead of the sugar and fork and then sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar.  Exactly what I was looking for!  Thanks!

These were excellent!  I added mini m&m's - I didnt have to flatten they went flat on their own, maybe I didnt put the full 3 cups oats, but it was close.  Still I will use this over & over.  Excellent!!  Thanks

[I had to add on to my review. I've made these three times now and everybody LOVES them. I took them to a weekend cottage retreat (8 people) recently and everyone kept taking one - one here, one there, and by the end of the second day, they were gone. This recipe is in my "keeper" file, for sure.]  Yum!!! Soft and chewy with a little bit of crisp around the edges. Really very tasty! A keeper! The only thing I did different - 350 degrees for the oven temperature - and baked for 10 minutes.

This is a very good cookie recipe. I was short on time so I did not refrigerate the dough first and it was fine...not too sticky and still okay to roll into balls.

I had high hopes based on the great reviews, but I was actually a little disappointed with the way these turned out. I was looking for a chewy cookie, but the texture of these was much too cakey for my liking. Although the flavor was very good, I wouldn't make them again.

Excellent recipe! Very versatile. I added in coconut, chocolate chips and raisins.They seemed a little dry and crumbly, so I added some water and that did the trick! I really liked the flavor with the cinnamon and oats. Will make them again! Thanks

These turned out really bland. After tasting the dough and not thinking much of it, I added more spices (ground nutmeg, ground cloves, pumpkin pie spice, and more cinnamon), but the cookies still turned out really bland. They lived up to their soft reputation, but I expected a lot more, especially after all the high reviews. I would rather have hard cookies with flavor than soft cookies with none.

I used old fashioned oatmeal, and added a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips with everything else. The kids tried talking me into letting them have them for breakfast the next morning. A keeper!

These were soooooooo good. The first batch were a little hard because I over baked them. They aren't kidding when they say 8-10 min. I took the second batch out when it still looked a bit under done, and let it set...those were perfect. Hearty and delicious, and perfect with raisins!

First of all I found the dough on these cookies to be really dry and I could hardly get it to stick together to make a mound on the cookie sheet.  Then as they baked, they spread out and burned.  Not sure what happened, I followed the recipe exactly, but I will not waste my time on these again!

Excellent cookies!  I've followed the recipe exactly & they're wonderful as written.  However, I usually make them with the following changes: using 3/4c butter, Splenda instead of the white sugar, replacing 1c of the flour with 1/2c wheat bran & 1/2c wheat germ (both finely ground), adding 1c craisins & 1/2c chopped pecans.  If you leave them round before baking, they stay plump and sturdy, yet soft and chewy!  I always freeze the dough & just bake up a batch at a time.  If you do not prefer a very sweet cookie, I would recommend reducing the sugar by 1/2c.  This is a great base recipe that you can easily alter to you liking!

I followed the recipe exactly with 2 exceptions: 1) I added 1 cup of Raisinettes which is a perfect raisin-chocolate ratio. 2) I used parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheet. It made exactly 5 doz, walnut-sized cookies.  I made these for my boyfriend. He really liked them and said they were very good, but not the best ever. If you like soft cookies, take them out of the oven when they look raw.  I took them out at 8 mins (10 mins tops) and they were soft and chewy for 24-36 hours. When I took them out when they looked done (12-14 mins), the cookies were very hard (within hours able to break teeth hard)  and had a granola like taste.  I do plan on making these again; mostly because my boyfriend likes them. But I found these really easy to make. I liked the fact that they spread very little on the cookie sheet so I could put 11-12 on each sheet.  I also liked that the dough was firm enough that I could roll them into balls, put them into little baggies and freeze them. I didn’t eve have to defrost them. I set the timer for the usual 8 mins, put them on the sheet as balls and put them in the oven for 1-2 mins. Then I took the sheet out, pressed them flat and then continued to bake them for the remainder of the 8 mins.

These cookies are dangerous!  Don't try this recipe if you are on diet (like I am) because once you bake 'em, you can't stop eating 'em!  SOOOO DELICIOUS!!!  I followed the recipe except I reduced the amount of white sugar to 3/4 cup because I wanted to add 2 cups of golden raisins which are usually very sweet and moist.  The cookies came out just so perfectly with perfect amount of sweetness!  Darn, that's why I can eat them endlessly!  I tried both flatten version as the recipe says (but no sugar) and just dropped the dough on a cookie sheet version but like many reviewers mentioned, both came out almost the same.  Maybe the flatten version came out slightly more crispy.  Because I prefer soft and chewy cookies, I won't bother chilling or flatten them next time.  I wasn't even a fan of oatmeal cookies.  I only decided to bake some because I got a box of oatmeal which I don't usually eat and didn't want to waste it.  Now I'm a biggest oatmeal cookie fan!  This was my first oatmeal cookie recipe but I don't think I have to try another one.  Thank you very much for sharing this.

These cookies were soft and delicious, the recipe was solid.  The only thing I did which sent them over the top, was to moisten the bottom of a glass, dip it in sugar and then press down the dough balls before baking.  My husband is picky with oatmeal raisin cookies and he really liked these.

These cookies have a wonderful buttery flavor.  I added raisins, dates, walnuts and pecans.  Nice chewy texture.  Held their shape, didn't spread out flat.  This will be my go-to oatmeal cookie recipe.

Excellent cookies.  I made some alterations, i added chocolate chips and pecans and rolled into larger balls (as previously suggested).  The bake time was the same and they turned out fabulous.

Best oatmeal cookie I have ever had or made. I got the idea to use butterscotch chips from another review but forgot to add it. So as I rolled the dough to freeze (it freezes well) I rolled it into the chips. YUMMY!

The best oatmeal cookie I've ever made. Would be delicious plain or with your favorite additions - I divided the dough and put raisins into one half and butterscotch chips into the other.  I used a sugar-coated glass bottom to press them, but didn't press them down much, just a little as they continue to flatten as they bake.

I'm not a big fan of oatmeal cookies in general (and I hate raisins), but these were excellent!  Everyone loves them and they're so simple to make.  These are now in my Christmas cookie tin line up!

Excellent base recipe - I used 1 Tbsp fresh orange zest, 1 cup Craisins & one package white chocolate chips per other reviewers' suggestions. They turned out perfectly soft with 8 minutes of baking time. Heavenly!

By far the best recipe for Soft Oatmeal Cookies that I have found! They taste great with or without raisins. They were a hit with all the people at my husband's place of work and with the whole family. Even after a number of days, although the outer surface became a bit tougher, the inside was still a beautiful consistency.

I made these cookies with my daughter, and it was very easy.  Everyone liked them.  I split the dough into 3 parts and added chocolate chips to one, raisins to another and left the 3rd one plain.  Baked them for about 8 minutes and they turned out great.

Made these cookies with raisins, chocolate chunks (Mexican chocolate, no less), and plain. All were delicious! I used whole wheat flour and reduced 1/4 of the sugars, using Splenda for white. This recipe makes 24 very big cookies; I flattened them slightly on the sheet before baking because they didn't spread. Like other reviewers, I neither chilled the dough nor used sugar on top of the cookies.

These were crunchy, not soft. Instead of vanilla I used crushed cardamon(but only a little) and oil in place of butter. Overall I give them 4/5 stars as they don't top another recipe I have. However, these could still stand in for your basic oatmeal cookies as long as you're not looking for "extraordinary".

very good cookies.  they turned out very soft and chewy as described.  I added a little bit more cinnamon and a dash of cloves and ginger for a little more spice. I would consider using a little less sugar next time since they are bit sweet for me. I didn't refrigerate the dough for the full hour (probably around 20 minutes) and they still turned out fine.  Another note- they stay pretty true to size and don't expand much when they are done cooking, so keep that in mind when measuring out portions.

I followed the recipe exactly and give it 4 stars. I thought the taste was great, but the texture was a little dry for me. Although it is a good cookie, I think I will keep looking for that perfect oatmeal cookie recipe.

Wonderful and easy oatmeal cookie...I followed other reviewers suggestions and didn't grease the pans, press down the cookies or chill the dough.
They tasted great, a very homey flavour. My husband loved them!

These were so delicious!! Oddly enough, I didn't have enough oatmeal so I used around 10 packets of cinnamon and spice instant oatmeal and then just omitted the cinnamon in the recipe. Worked great. Thanks for a really great recipe.

The few minutes difference between soft & chewy and hard & crumbly is nominal so keep an eye on them!!!  I add fresh grated orange zest, sundried cranberries and pecans to mine.  Heavenly...

Very easy to make and delicious.  I didn't put the dough in the fridge to chill simply because I couldn't be bothered. And I simply dropped tablespoon sized balls (without flattening) onto a cookie sheet lightly sprayed with cooking spray. I baked for 10 minutes and they were perfect.

These cookies were awesome! The first time that I made them, I went by the exact recipe. The next 2 times I only used 2.5 cups of oats, substituted 1 cup of flour for whole wheat flour, used 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and added raisins. The last time I also added chopped walnuts. Each time they were gobbled up by everyone. The best part, aside from the taste of course, is how easy and quick these are to make! The only minor problem I had was mixing after adding the oats. Will make these again and again. Thanks for the wonderful recipe, Barabara!

This is a great basic oatmeal cookie recipe - chewy and not too sweet.   It also works great with the addition of pecans, chocolate chips, dried fruit... pretty much anything.

These were very delicious. Be sure to leave plenty of space between the cookies. I didn't have to flatten my dough. I also didn't refrigerate the dough.
I added some ground cloves to mine and I added in dried cherries. I took about a cup of dried bing cherries and soaked them in hot water with a teaspoon of vanilla for about 10 minutes. Then I drained them, chopped them up and added them to the dough after the oatmeal. I also stirred in about 4 tbsp of flax seed that I round a little with a morter and pestle.

I have probably tried hundreds of cookie recipes over the years, but I have to say that these cookies are some of the BEST I have ever had!! I followed the recipe, and made sure to put them in the fridge for an hour. They were crisp on the outside, and very soft and chewy inside. I also added 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter, and they were delicious! These have become our whole family's new favorite.

This was a good cookie!  I used all brown sugar instead of the white and they still turned out REALLY GOOD.  I had to cook them a few minutes longer than the recipe because they were too mushy when I first checked them.  I also added only 1/2 the cinnamon and used egg whites.  Next time I am going to try replacing 1/2 the butter with applesauce. 

UPDATE: I made this recipe w/ 1/2 the butter, the other half applesauce, all brown sugar, and wholewheat flour.  They were pretty good, not nearly as good as the first batch with the reg. ingredients.  They were cakier and not as chewy...more like a muffin, but still delicious.

My hubby is an Oatmeal Raisen Cookie Lover! Over the last 10 yrs. I've tried many, but this is by far the best one! Soft and Chewy, just the way we like them! I scaled the white sugar down to 2/3 cup, and next time I'm going to try 1/2 cup. I added 2c. raisens and a little extra cinnamon.

Great Recipe!  I followed the advice of a few others and only used 2 cups of oats, I used 1/2 cup of white sugar, and I put 1 1/2 cups of raisins.  I think it would have been better if I added even more raisins, maybe 2 cups next time. Also more cinnamon, or maybe next time try cloves as others suggest.  A great cookie, i did an experiment and baked some right after I made it, and they spread out fine on the pan and I didn't spray the pan.  They stuck a little but otherwise ok.  I refrigerated for about 45 mins and the consistency was better, but I still sprayed the pan so they wouldn't stick.  If you use a cushion air baking pan then you won't have a problem of really burning the cookies, I've left them in there for 11 or 12 mins, and they were dark brown  but not burnt, and just a little crisp on the edges, but still super soft.   Great cookie!

Super good cookie!!! I baked mine for 9 minutes and in my oven they were PERFECT! I did grease the pan for the first batch but found it really isn't needed. I didn't dip the fork in sugar either.

I made as written (except I used old fashioned oats), then added chocolate chips to one half and raisins to the other half. I didn't chill the dough or grease the pans or flatten the cookies (just dropped them on with a spoon). They turned out delicious, soft, chewy, and slightly spiced. Just like an oatmeal cookie should be! (And a really big "mmmmm" from my toddler, who rarely gets cookies!) I don't often have such good success with cookies. This will be my standard oatmeal recipe.

This recipe came out really good. I used fructose instead of the white sugar and they still came out great. I also put dried cranberries and nuts in some of them for variety. Great flavor and consistency.

I added raisins to 1/2 of the batter and chocolate chips to the other half before chilling.  Both turned out great but the raisin half would be good with some added cloves.  NOTE: With the add-ins the recipe makes closer to 5 dozen cookies, not the 2 doz as listed...

I made these cookies trying to use up some ingredients that I've had for a while. They were definitely soft. I added some chocolate chips. Next time I will reduce the cinnamon when adding chocolate chips to this recipe. Very good. Thanks for the recipe.

These are absolutely the best!  I made half with raisins and half without as my husband does not like raisins.  He devoured them and he usually only eats chocolate chip cookies.

These are awesome!!!  I didn't have any raisins for them, so I just chopped up some grapes (I know that sounds weird, but it worked!).  I forgot the cinnamon, but these cookies are so good that they don't really need it (I think, anyway).  I made them for my daughter to take to preschool choir for snack and she came home with 2 cookies left (out of a bowlful) and 3 requests for the recipe!  I'm making another batch today!

This is now my only oatmeal cookie recipe - they're that good. Be sure to chill the dough, or else they spread out a lot - on the other hand, if you like thin cookies (as my husband does), don't bother and put them straight on the cookie sheet!

I made a huge batch (then split it to add different toppings) and they were the rave of christmas. i gave them to friends and family and most of them either called me back or sent me a thankyou note because they loved the crisp/chewiness of it.
I didn't particularly like them with semi-sweet chocolate chips, but the dried cranberry and the spice ones (nutmeg, clove, cinnamon) were the favorites.

Good recipe! I did lower the amount of white sugar and substituted it with brown sugar.

These are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever tried. I followed the recipe exactly, and personally, I don't think it needs any twinking. Last time I made half of the batch 'as is' and added chocolate chips to the other half batch. My husband LOVED the chocolate chip ones. Tonight I am going to make them again - half chocolate chip & walnut, half cranberry white chocolate chip. Can't wait!

This is one of the strangest post i will make.  My husband tried one and while looking at it and tasting it he said they don't look or taste like Oatmeal cookies, but they are the best Cookies i've had.  So i rank them a four star because they are very good, but won't give a five because they just don't have the look or taste of a traditional oatmeal cookie.  Even though he is requesting i Make more for him tonight haha.  Now if your confused, then you know how i feel.  :-)

Really yummy cookie. I followed other reviewer's advise and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1 1/2 brown sugar. I added white chips and craisins to 1/2 the  mixture and chocolate chips to the other half. These cookies are great and they don't go "flat" in the oven.

Yummy Yummy Yummy! I've used this recipe at least 6 times in the last 2 months. I like it better with semi-sweet choc. chips (it reminds me of my favorite resturaunts choc. cookies). I also use 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening. I did this one time because I was low out of butter. Also suggest decreasing the amount of cinnamon as it interferes with the chocolate.

I love this recipe! Lost my old oatmeal cookie recipe and found this today and tried it...with awesome result!! I did made a change however, used half butter and half shortening instead of using all butter to make it crispy around the edges and not spread out too much like all-butter recipe. Must try! Only problem is that you tend to eat about 10 at a time...

These cookies are so good by themselves that you don't need to put raisins or chocolate chips in them. I made some plain & some cc/raisin, and I thought the plain cookies were better.  I only used 1/2 t. of salt & 1/2 t. of cinnamon. Also, I didn't chill the dough. They came out nice & soft just like the name says. We loved them!!
This is one of my favorite cookie recipes.

These turned out wonderfully well--with a few changes.  I used only whole wheat flour, and I used 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar with 1/2 cup of white.  I also added closer to 2 tsp cinnamon.  They were flavorful and soft but not mushy.  Thanks for the recipe!!

These were DELISH!!! I modified the recipe a little bit with the 3/4 white sugar, 1tsp cinn, 2tsp vanilla and 1 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I also added cransins, white chocoloate and coconut. These came out so perfect and soft. I only cooked them for 8 minutes. They did look undercooked, but they weren't. BEST EVER!!!

the cookies are delicious... i baked only 2, and formed balls and froze the rest so we'll have a treat ready to bake when we're in the mood.  the recipe is very similar to quaker oats' 'vanishing oatmeal cookies'- just an extra 1/2C sugar and flour here.

Quick question-  this is my favorite oatmeal cookie recipe.  I've made it about 3 times now.  I baked these cookies today and something was different- they were not as moist as they usually are.  I baked them for only 8 minutes as I always do.  Any suggestions on how to make these cookies moister and chewier??  Should I add more brown sugar?  I don't know what went wrong this time.  They were still delicious, but someone not as moist as they usually are.  Maybe a teaspoonof milk would help?? Thanks.

Love these cookies! My only suggestion is to reduce the amount of cinnamon in half.  I found the cinnamon a little overpowering when I used the full amount.

I was surprised that such a simple recipe yielded such an extraordinary cookie! I cut out the white sugar completely and added a bit more brown.  I also added raisins.  Best oatmeal raisin cookies ever!

I HATE baking. hate it hate it hate it. But I have to say, this recipe was easy to follow and who knew I actually had all the ingredients in my cupboard already!  Despite not being the avid baker that some of my co-workers are, I got rave reviews. Thanks for the great recipe!

So I don't even like oatmeal cookies, and I couldn't help but to nibble on these.  They weren't crazily oatmealy- and were definately soft inside with a crispness on the exterior.  Everyone loved them...made half the batch with raisins, and half without.  Would definately make again- so easy!

This recipe is great! I had such fun playing with it. Instead of a whole cup of butter, I did a half cup. Then I added a half cup of PEANUT BUTTER!! Omitted the cinnamon and added a touch of milk to make it a bit more doughy. I also added a smidge more baking soda--JUST a smidge. They turned out fabulous. I would reccomend if trying this version, flatten the dough balls a bit with your fingers (otherwise they come out kinda rounded)Thanks a bunch for the great recipe!

These are delicious!  I was kind of skeptical, since I have tried so many different oatmeal cookie recipies and have never found one to my liking.  But I gave it a chance, since it had some many rave reviews, and I am so glad I did!  Soft, definitely the right texture, and such a good taste.  I added 3/4 cup of raisins to the second batch (the first one was gone in a matter of hours)- yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these as directed, and added some dried cranberries, just to try something other than raisins...they turned out very yummy, and I will make them again!  BUT...I chilled the dough overnight and it was hard as a brick, I had to wait quite a while before I could even scoop any out, and then I found it to be very crumbly, and impossible to flatten with a fork.  I had to shape the dough into flat round shapes with my hands before cooking them, which was very time consuming. Maybe if I had let the dough come to room temperature first it wouldn't have been so difficult.  As I said though, a very good end result!  I definitely recommend the cranberries.

DELICIOUS!!! Truely very moist and tasty. Everyone loves them.
I added 1 cup raisins, and cut back a little on the cinnamon.
To prevent them from spreading too thin when baking, I just left the cookie sheet ungreased.
The amount of listed ingredients actually makes 4 dozen cookies.

This had a little too much cinnamon for me, but my boyfried and my brother L-O-V-E-D these cookies. I rarely review recipes, but I am so grateful to have one of "those recipes" in my arsenol. I am chilling dough for more now, this time with less cinnamon and some chocolate chips!

this is THE oatmeal raisin cookie i've been looking for my whole life. the edges are the slightest bit crunchy and the rest is moist, chewy and soft. i added 1 1/2 c. raisins, 3 t. cinnamon. i also took the chilled dough out of the fridge and formed them into 1 1/2 inch balls and slightly flattened them with the palm of my hand. they were a gift for my grandfathers birthday. A++++++ better than any bakery cookie!

The first time I tried this recipe, I used old fashion oats.  Though there was good flavor, it flattened the cookie.  The next time I followed the recipe exactly (using quick oats) and it turned out to be the perfect cookie! No kidding. Soft, firm and moist.  I baked it for 10 minutes, any less and they didn't get done. I also used parchment paper to bake on and I highly recommend, so much easier and cleaner too.  This is now a top of the list cookie!  I have already added it a cookbook I am creating for my son of my favorite recipes.  Thanks!

I just pulled the last tray of these out of the oven, and I couldn't wait any longer to rate this recipe....FABULOUS!  Soft and chewy in the center with just the right amount of crunch around the very outer edge.  These are by far the best cookies I have tasted, better than gourmet bakery cookies or even those Otis Spunkmeyer cookies they sell in restaurants.  I followed the recipe exactly, and added 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  A word of WARNING, though, this recipe takes some elbow grease!!  I don't have an electric mixer (or even the hand-crank kind), so I mixed it by hand with a spoon.  Quite a workout!  The dough is very thick, but it is well worth the work.  Also, mine were done at 8 minutes...don't overcook!!  They will look raw when you take them out (browned only around the edges and soft/gooey in the center), but they continue to set as they cool.  As my boyfriend (who grabbed two right off the first tray) said, "these are the PERFECT cookies!"

This one isn't a keeper.  It's not bad mind you, however I don't believe it would take a bit of time to find a better oatmeal cookie recipe.  These cookies are okay if eaten within 48 hours but after two days the kids wouldn't even eat them and they ended up in the trash.  I cook and bake a lot, I am always in search of the perfect recipe for everything and this one, in my humble opinion, just doesn't make the grade.

Best oatmeal cookie I've found yet - & believe me I've been looking!  If you follow the directions correctly and not over cook them they are PERFECT!  These have the right texture I was looking for... I only added a teaspoon of cinnamon, and one cup of chocolate chips.

Excellent recipe!!  Really easy to make. I left the dough in the fridge for a couple of hours and then it was really easy to roll.  Could almost use some more cinnamon.  Maybe next time!!
Anyway thanks for this recipe.  It's  a keeper!!

A good tasting oatmeal cookie.  Mine did not turn out soft but they were not as crispy as other oatmeal cookies.  I added more cinnamin and did not press cookies with fork and sugar.  My husband and I both give thumbs way up!

Don't do what I did. I added the oats but forgot to add the flour.  The cookies melted all over the sheet pan.  But still they were delicious.  I told my husband I had made granola. :)

I rarely bake cookies but I was in the mood for oatmeal cookies.  I added a cup of toffee bits to the dough when I added the oats.   Also made the cookies quite a bit larger.  I quadrupled the size for each cookie.  I was able to bake 24 cookies from this recipe.  They were baked for about 15-17 minutes.  They came out soft & moist.  My friends want more of them!

I would have rated with 5 stars but they were a bit salty for my preference.  I suggest if you're like me to cut back a pinch or 2 of the salt.  If you like more salt than I do then change nothing.  I believe those that like more salt than I do will rate this recipe with 5 stars. Side note: I added raisins and also lined cookie sheet with parchment paper because it's nonstick and easy clean up.  Also, I made a basic powdered sugar icing and put in a baggie, cut a tip of the corner of the baggie and squeezed the icing on top of some of the cookies. Was really good.

they turned out really great! tough but nice and crumbly-soft on the inside (not breaking a tooth when you bite into it, basically). if you’re looking for a healthier way to make ‘em: less sugar, less butter, and a healthier flour (maybe almond or whole wheat). some other pro-tips: make sure all your ingredients (especially butter) are all at room temperature before you start mixing, chilling the batter after you’re done is not necessary unless your mixture is very sticky/runny, add some dry fruits and nuts!, and take them out of the oven a lil bit before 8-9 minutes - if you leave them in they become ROCK SOLID after they dry, make sure they’re soft so that they remain crumbly and soft after they cool. enjoy!

These cookies were delish. I substituted the white sugar for organic palm sugar and put in half white and half flour. I did not press with fork just spooned on cookie sheet and pressed down a bit.. wanted them moist.

Excellent cookies! I made a half-batch to try, like a holiday dry-run, and I'm very happy with these. Perfect amount of spice - just a hint of the cinnamon. To half of the batter I added raisins. To the other half, chocolate chips. I made as the recipe states, walnut-sized, so they're smaller. The first batch I didn't press down, and they came out fine. I just pressed down a bit with my fingers on the last batch (no fork), and those were good, too -- either way works. Baked for 9-10 min. They came out perfect - a nice chew and a little crusty on the outside. I'm bringing a few to friends, but will probably make these again for more gifting. Thanks for the great recipe!

These were great the first time I made  them, and the whole family loved them! I however, am gluten-free, so I just substituted the all-purpose flour for Pamela's gluten-free all-purpose flour, and they were delicious! Just in case you were wondering, you do not need to flatten them before baking. I used a smallish spoon to put little golf-ball-sized drops of batter onto the cookie sheet, and thy came out pretty much perfect. I would definitely make these again.

I only used 1/2 tsp salt and sifted all the dry ingredients together first then added slowly to mixture. Everything was exactly the same. Perfectly chewy and one of the best oatmeal cookies I ever made. Thank you Allrecipes for sharing!
Oh yeah did not add any nuts or anything my family doesn't like it. I do so next time.....

While a tad more labor intensive than regular oatmeal cookie recipes, I think the extra step of refrigerating the dough for "at least an hour" seemed to raise this recipe above the rest.  The cookies in my oven seemed perfect at 9 minutes and were just as described...chewy and delicious. I tried adding some chopped dried cranberries to some of the dough at the end and thought they were awesome also. Will  definitely make again, probably without any changes, other than perhaps trying to add other chopped dried fruit for variety, such as dried cherries or apricots.

These cookies are amazing! Some of the other reviews said they were too cake-like, so I only used 1 egg. I cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1 cup of chocolate chips. The batter does get very thick and hard to stir. I found using a wooden spoon helps. Will definitely make these again!

I liked the texture and it did come out chewy when I left them as balls and cooked them for 10min.

But taste was disappointing. They are much too salty and too sweet. I made them exactly as the recipe states. They remind me of the sweetness of Archers oatmeal cookies with the frosting, but these don't have frosting. It's an easy fix though. I will make it again but after reducing the salt to 1/2 tsp and the sugar to 2/3 cup. My kids are at least enjoying them.

Great Cookies.  I am abroad and didn't have my "go to" oatmeal cookie recipe so I looked on line and I must say, this is a winner!  Perfect amount of salt and sweet!  I couldn't find baking soda here so I substituted baking powder according to a conversion chart for substitutions.  2 teaspoons baking powder per 1/2 teaspoon baking soda.  For this recipe I used 4 teaspoons baking powder :) with great results!  Next time ill add dried cranberries !!

This is the exact same recipe found on the back of my Kroger brand quick rolled oats, except for refrigerating and rolling out.  No need for that, just spoon out the dough after mixing.

Great recipe! I made my portions 2x the walnut suggestion, and didn't press flat so I needed 10-12 minutes. I used 1.5 tbsp of vanilla instead of 1tsp which made a big difference in their softness. I like this recipe because you can sub out 1c of oats for 1c of whatever flavor you'd like.  My houses' favorite is coconut.

This  is the oatmeal cookie recipe of all oatmeal cookie recipes. I did not use raisins or vanilla extract and I substituted the butter for virgin olive oil. The cookies came out amazingly. Substituting the butter for virgin olive oil made no difference in the taste. I also used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and six tablespoons of white/granulated sugar (instead of another 1/2 cup). The cookies were perfectly sweet. If you don't put enough sugar, your cookies WILL have an olive oil aftertaste. They're chewy inside and crunchy outside. Apparently, olive oil will make and keep your baked goods moist. Even hours after cooking them, leftover cookies were soft.

These are FANTASTIC!!! My cookies came out moist and chewy. I did not refrigerate them before cooking or press them flat. I followed the recipe to a "T"  then  dropped them by the Tablespoon onto the cookie sheet and baked for exactly 7 minutes and then let them cool on the cookie sheet for about 3-4 minutes. My family LOVED them, they were gone by the end of the day!!This is my new go to oatmeal raisin recipe : )

This is a perfect oatmeal cookie. Soft and chewy at the center, crisp and melt-in-your-mouth-buttery at the edges. I've made it exactly as written many times. I've also made it with some normal adjustments like skipping the sugared fork and drizzling a quick powdered sugar/milk icing on top, with nuts, raisins, craisins and various combinations of all of these  changes. They always turn out amazing. As a side note I have to wonder about the folks who give a recipe a bad review when 3k other people liked/loved it.  There's no accounting for taste. Or skill.

Just made these but excluded the cinnamon and the chill time. I also added two heaping tsp of PB2 (powdered peanut butter). It did not make it very strong peanut butter but just enough for us. I also did not dip the fork in sugar as there is enough sugar in the mix. But mine turned out very soft middles with crunchy edges and moist insides.

These were yummy and easy. But they were definitely on the crispy side (which I personally like). If you want them to be moist and chewy, I would recommend baking for 7 minutes or less.

These cookies are AMAZEBALLS!!! I made them for my husband who fell asleep before the dough had chilled so I only made a couple cookies the first night for myself and I thought they were good but really dry. The next day the dough had dried out further so I added 1/4ish cups of oil (only made 1/2 the recipe) and that made all the difference. I didn't roll the dough into walnut sized balls or press them with a fork (if they look too perfect how will people know I slaved over them ; P). I just scooped big globs onto the pan and they turned out SO well!

These cookies are good. My youngest daughter has a a gluten and dairy allergy. So I changed the butter to Blue Bonnett Lactose-Free. For the flour, I used Bob's Red Mill All-purpose baking flour. I had to add a 1/2 teaspoon of xanthan gum and I also added 1/2 cup of Enjoy Life semi-sweet chocolate chips. These chips are dairy, nut and soy free. I skipped the chill stage and the cookies are just as moist. Awesome recipe though

Great tasting! After the third batch I eliminated the sugar on fork because we thought it made the cookies too sweet. Other than that, followed the recipe and added raisins.  Very good!

The cookies are great. The first batch was in the oven for 9 minutes which seemed too long so the next ones were only in for 8 minutes. After I took the dough out of the fridge, I tried forming little balls but it was way too messy. Instead I used two spoons for putting them on the cookie sheet. I think my cookies are a bit chewy but they taste great. Maybe a bit too sweet. Next time less sugar.

I just made these cookies and they were great! I followed the recipe exactly except I used organic oats from whole foods & I baked them for 15 minutes. They weren't as soft but they were still great. I recommend these!

This is the best recipe I have used and I find the cookies are excellent even without raisins or nuts. Be sure to use the fork on the rounded balls. So so easy and delicious.

These are pretty good. The refrigeration isn't absolutely necessary or the flattening with a fork. They are a little sweet for an oatmeal cookie though, I think I'll cut the white sugar a little next time.

These are yummy!! Ill give it four stars only because I made a few changes. I used one cup wheat flour and one cup white. I  also cut the sugar a bit. I used one cup brown and half cup white. I also added raisins and chocolate chips til it looked like enough! Not very exact but whatever! I refrigerated for an hour and 30 minutes,  then baked for 9 mins. Do grease the sheet and let cool before removing though!

I followed the recipe nearly to a T. The only difference is I didn't press the cookies with a fork prior to baking, which I thought was only a peanut butter cookie thing. Any how, I used my small scooper to make equal sized balls. Baked on parchment paper for 12 minutes (10 didn't seem long enough) at 375 and they are perfect. I mixed in a cup of raisins and a cup of vanilla chips when I mixed in the oats. I creamed my butter and sugar with my hands mixer but did all other mixing with a wooden spoon to avoid over mixing. Delicious and moist cookies!

This recipe is deelish! Some seem to have problems with the texture. Make sure to use Quick Minute Oats. It makes a big difference to texture and moisture. I added a little more cinnamon than called for. I didn't cool in the fridge or press down and they were perfect. It is quickly our new go-to favourite. Thanks!

Hubby says these are the best oatmeal cookies he's ever had. I added 1 cup raisins. Didn't refrigerate dough or grease the pan or flatten. I wanted large cookies so made golf ball size and baked about 10 min in 350F convection oven, just until beginning to brown on edges.

Good recipe. I added 1/3 - 1/2 cup raisins (boiled and drained to be more moist- cheap alternative to 'baking raisins') and reduced the cinnamon due to my picky eaters. Wonderful.

Update: I tried to replace the butter with applesauce. Not so successful....  did 1 cup applesauce to replace the butter. I knew they would not be as good as the original, stil, they are edible but disappointing. I will still to the recipe from now on !

Everyone loves them! My friend and I add chocolate chips and coconut. They came out perfect. And we keep making them. Tips would be to only push the fork down so the cookies become thick round discs.

Not a Bad Recipe.  These didn't turn out Soft, they were slightly Firm after Baking.  Still pretty good.  I did Sub the Butter for Butter Flavored Crisco cause that's what I had on Hand, so they have a Buttery Flavor, I can taste the Salt right off then the Cinnamon.  Pretty good Cookie.

It makes great cookies that my whole family of hard-to-pleasers loved! I used equal parts of white and whole wheat flour. I also used whole large flake oats because that's all I had on hand. I was kind of worried that they'd make the cookies too dry but they didn't. It'll definitely be a staple in our house from now on. Thanks!

I just made these and they were SO GOOD! I used whole wheat flour, added a scoop of vanilla chocolate protein powder and a bit of milk, and they were delicious! They were soft when they came out of the oven, but they've crisped up a bit, which is fine. They're still tasty. Can't wait to make them again, maybe add some chocolate chips next time. Thanks!

Easy modification tips:
- I used 2 1/2 cups of oats and a 1/2 cup of wheat germ (instead of 3 cups oats) and they had the BEST chewy texture!
- I used 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- this recipe is MUCH better without chocolate chips--so I don't recommend adding any
- you can use Splenda instead of sugar, but they won't be quite as sweet

This is by far the best oatmeal cookies I ever had. My husband and daughter absolutely love them.  The only I will do different next time is add less sugar just a bit to sweet for us. Thanks for sharing it, it is a keeper in our home.

I have been using different recipes on AR for the last 6 years. I'm a novice baker and love to make cookies for my two year old.  I NEVER leave reviews for any of the recipes I've got on AR , so that should say something about this super yummy soft and chewy cookie!!!

These are delicious. I added 1.5 cups of chocolate chips. Cooked perfectly at 11 minutes for me.  Did not chill the dough.  Used a melon baller and flattened with a fork without sugar.  I used parchment paper instead of greasing the pan.  This made 70 2 inch cookies.

Great cookie.  No need to refrigerate dough and no sugar needed on the fork to press dough down.

I recently tried this receipe with a few adjustments. First I used margarine instead because I had no butter on hand and my mom was having a sweet tooth that was being relentless, second I used whole wheat flour (i forgot to make sure I had regular flour before i started mixing), third I didnt measure my cinamon or vanilla because I thought the measurments wouldnt overcome the ww flour taste so i eyballed and tasted until satisfied, & fourth I put some ginger in the batter and i accidently forgot the salt(probabley good since the cookies arnt as moist as promoted salt would have dried them out more). They came out great my mom loved them and so did I tatsed excellent ^.^. Also the sweetness is perfect so I didnt do the fork in sugar and flatten routine thought it would be over kill. Enjoy.

I followed the recipe, but mine didn't come out soft and the color seemed too light. I'll try again to see if I did something wrong. The flavor was good and the family still loved them.

I made this recipe today with a few changes.  Refused sugar to 3/4 cup of each, reduced cinnamon to 1 tsp., added 1/2 cup dried cranberries and 1/2 cup white chocolate.  Backed on parchment lined sheets in 375 degree convection oven for 7 minutes per sheet.  I did not flatten them.  Perfect texture and taste.

Love the cookie recipe, My variations, I used 1cup of light brown sugar and 1/2 cup of maple syrup. Also,  2 cups only of old fashion oatmeal, didn't have the instant type.  Cookies came out soft and not too sweet. Also first batch in for 10mins, afterwards 9mins for all other batches. I got 45 cookies

This recipe rocked my cookie world! Very simple to make with an excellent taste and texture and wonderful visual appeal.  Not that it needed it, but I doubled the vanilla to 2 tsp. and added milk chocolate chips.  I've taken these cookies to holiday events a few times & they've gotten rave reviews.

These are amazing and so easy to make! I added 1 cup of raisins. My husband loved them. The only thing I did to the recipe was double it! Very moist, I did only bake them for 9 minutes and they were perfect.

These are amazing!! So easy to make, I've only baked ready to bake cookies so I wasn't sure how these would turn out.. followed all directions, added a spoon full of mini simi sweet chocolate chips.. I read another review that said as soon as the edges are golden they are reasy, just let them sit, I would od thought they needed more time but once they cooled they were perfect!! Will definitely take these to the in laws for Christmas ;)

Yummmmmilicious!!' We added a lot of dry fruits like almonds,  walnuts,  cashew-nuts, etc and in stead of 1 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon we just used 1tsp. Also, we made half the batch on the job using sand and half a batch in a tandoor!!! :))

Really good, though I did change it a bit after making them exactly the first time. 375 was too hot, so I lowered it to 350 and the cookies came out great. Instead of 1C of white sugar I did about 2/3. I still did 1C of brown sugar. This made the cookies sweet but not too sweet like the original recipe. Instead of 3C of oats, I did about 2.5C for a more chewy cookie. Also, I cut back on the salt to about 1/2 tsp. Added about a cup of choc chips. Yum!

Kinda dry. Maybe i over cooked them?
I should have added raisins or cranberries instead of chocolate chips. I will not make these again. There's just to many other things out there to try.

Pretty good, but..Too much sugar. I had a couple of people taste and they all agreed on this, even though I only used 1&1/2 cups in total. Also, I would go for a bit less flour in favour of more oatmeal. These felt more like snickerdoodles than oatmeal cookies to me. Finally, it took me 15 minutes to get them cooked, but this may be an elevation issue. I've had better oatties, but these were quite nice with a glass of cold milk. Thanks OP!

This recipe is amazing! I didn't have any eggs but still wanted to try the recipe so I used an egg substitute (1T cornstarch+ 2T water= 1 egg) they turned out amazing, soft and chewy and almost had a snicker doodle taste to them. Will make again for sure .

I used old fashioned oats in this recipe, so I added six teaspoons of warm water to the wet mixture and then stirred in the oats and let it sit for about 20 mins before adding the dry ingredients. The cookies turned out amazing!

I didn't have any regular quick cooking oats on hand, but I did have a few boxes of instant oatmeal in the single serve packets (regular flavor of course). I used 9 packets which turn out to be roughly the 3 cups that the recipe calls for. Also I didn't flatten the cookies like a few reviewers suggested and they turned out great. The recipe said it would make 24 cookies but I had quite a bit of left over dough so I slapped some plastic wrap around the extra and froze it.

An excellent recipe. Very easy to make, and super tasty. You can control how soft your cookies come out by how warm the dough is when it goes into the oven; warmer dough spreads more and gives a thinner, crisper cookie. Regardless, these cookies spread a lot upon baking, so make sure to leave plenty of room between your cookies or they'll run together.

I made these tonight for my family's desert and they are really good.  But, like others have mentioned, they aren't moist but rather a little dry.  My children didn't notice the difference though, and ate them up!!  I will have to find a way to make the cookies more moist but, until then, the way they are, isn't bad.

These cookies were very good.  A secret to make them very soft is to add 1 tablespoon of sour cream in the mixture.  This will soften most any type of cookie, chocolate chip ect.

Hands down the best oatmeal cookie recipe out there. When I broke out this recipe a few months ago my daughter was so happy - it brought back great memories for her. It's the only oatmeal cookie we make where I work - the previous recipe has been retired.

This recipe no matter how I tweaked it by suggestions still came out hard not soft. It was not as flavorful as the recipe that I have already.

I am not a fan of Oatmeal Raisin but these made me a believer. Very yummy as written, well almost. I added a cup of raisins. Delicious! I guess I also changed the process too...I did not refrigerate them. Just scooped them out and baked them as the recipe said. Really tasty!!

This recipe, slightly modified, is excellent.  My new go-to oatmeal raisin cookie.

Modifications:  I weighed the flour (not really a mod, but more accurate) 2 cups all purpose = 8.5 ounces.  I also increased the cinnamon a little, to 2 tsp.  I only had old fashioned oats so that is what I used, as is.  I completely skipped the "chill" and "flatten with a fork" steps.  In my oven, 8 minutes was perfect.  Chewy oatmeal raisin goodness.

My 8 year old made these as written but i baked them and they were perfect.  I used stoneware and baked them on a hot stone for 8 minutes.  Then I let them rest on the stone for 1 minute before removing.  I even added 1/4 cup raisins to the last batch.  They were tasty, we couldn't stop eating them!  We will definitely make them again.

Delicious oatmeal cookie recipe! 5 stars because the cookies are great as written, however I do like to make a few changes. I add a splash of lemon juice to make the cookies a little fluffier (I almost always use it as a leavening agent when paired with baking soda if I'm making cookies...you can't taste it, and it makes the cookies not go flat). I also use pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon -- trust me, it is SO good! Cooking time is on point. I use parchment paper and cook for 9 minutes at 375, leaving the cookies to cool on the sheet for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack. They come out perfect every time!

Tried this recipe while stuck inside on a rainy day. It turned out that I didn't have vanilla or cinnamon! Not feeling like braving the weather to go to the store, I used Kahlua in place of vanilla and used 1/2 tsp of cloves instead of cinnamon. The cookies turned out great! crispy on the bottom and gooey on the inside. I did not refrigerate the dough and did not press the dough balls down. They were done at exactly 9 minutes. Highly recommend this recipe, it's fun to swap out ingredients and experiment with what you have laying around in your kitchen cabinets.

We make these cookies all the time, and always get compliments on how yummy they are. We add craizons (and walnuts sometimes) however which give it a nice fruity sweetness. Always a party favorite. The only skip we often bypass is the refridgeration for an hour. We have done it both with and without, and they taste the same. Overall though, delicious!

I love oatmeal cookies, but hate raisins. Of course, you can't find plain oatmeal cookies usually, so I wanted to try to make them myself. I had been using whole wheat flour to make banana bread and figured I would use it to make the cookies. I accidentally only added 2 cups of oats vs. the 3 called for in the recipe. I definitely did not miss the 3rd cup of oats and actually think it would have dried the cookie out too much. They turned out perfect! I probably got about 3-4 dozen cookies by scooping a tablespoon of dough for each cookie. I did flatten them with a fork, but they don't flatten much more after baking for 8-9 min. Since the first batch, I have tried them several different ways by adding chocolate chips, shredded coconut, etc. They have been awesome each time! Even my picky 6 year old, who oddly doesn't usually like cookies, loved them. I did try this recipe with regular flour, but the cookies turned out terrible. They were too flat and thin. I didn't even bother cooking the whole batch and actually threw them all away. I will definitely not make this recipe with regular flour again, as the taste just wasn't good and doesn't compare to the whole wheat cookies. I gave a 4 just because the regular flour does not work for me, but a 5 with the small alterations I made. I didn't realize what a difference the whole wheat flour would make. I'm glad my first batch was with the whole wheat flour, otherwise I wouldn't have made these cookies again.

These are delicious.   Very good as written, but for my favourite variation I add raisins, cranberries and apricots, and use a 2:1 mix of quick oats to rolled oats.  Don't skimp on the salt, it boosts the flavours.

These are without a doubt the best cookies I've ever made. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, except we're gluten free so I used an all purpose gluten free flour. I also just dropped them and didn't flatten them. SO MOIST and DELICIOUS!

Of all the recipes for oatmeal cookies I've made over the years, these are by far the best! Have to agree with RedSoxRule that can't put my finger on what separates this from the rest, but they are awesome! Although I omitted the cinnamon and added 3/4 cup coconut that I pulsed a few times in the food processor(think the texture of the cookie is better if I do this)and in doing so, added 1/4 cup less white sugar, due to the sweetness of the coconut. Next time I may make it as written...either way, this is one good cookie!

The cookie actually tasted pretty good; it had a good flavor and it was soft and chewy. After tasting the raw batter, I was afraid it would be too strong of a cinnamon taste, but it mellowed out and was perfect. However, the cookie didn't hold together. It stuck to the pan and had the consistency more like granola. Maybe it needs more "cookie" substance and a few less oats.

These were really good. I made these for my Mom. I personally never liked oatmeal cookies but these are so good. I can't stop eating them. I only used 1 teaspoon of cinnamon & that was actually too much for my preference. Next time I wont use it at all. Half of the batch I added raisins.

These are the most delicious oatmeal cookies EVER!!!!  I highly recommend these and to soften them up when you are ready to serve them just put in them in the microwave for a few seconds.. I put them in about 10 - 15 secs per cookie!  This makes them seem fresh right out of the oven!

they are very thick and dumpy.. but it seemed to be chewy when they cooled so that is a plus- I used half of the brown sugar to make them softer- too much sugar would have made this more stiff.... so good recipe minus the sugar

These cookies turned out great, however, I followed the advise of other reviewers and cut the white sugar down to 2/3 cup. The cookies were crispy on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside. I will definitely make these again!

I haven't been able to find an oatmeal raisin cookie recipe that I've liked after a lot of searching.  I chose this recipe as a base and it turned out perfectly.  Short on time and didn't flatten with a fork or refrigerate, I just baked them and they were perfect.  At 10 minutes the outside was just crispy while the inside was cooked but soft.  I tried adding raisins by soaking 1 cup of raisins in hot water, draining and then tossing them with about 1/4 c. flour before stirring them in at the very end after adding the oats.  I was making these for someone else as I have never been a fan of this type of cookie and WOW. Hands down, best oatmeal raisin cookies EVER.  Thank you so much for sharing!!

Just made these last night, but made some changes as this recipe looked a little bland. I added more cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. I also added about 3/4 cups of cranberries and 1/3 cup dark chocolate chips. No refrigerating and make them slightly bigger, like the size of a meatball. Baked for 15 minutes and they were perfect. They were chewy and a nice buttery taste with just a hint of crunch. Even my picky daughter gobbled them up. This is a keeper with modifications.

Awesome! I added chocolate chips and used coconut flour instead. They kept disapearing!

I made a couple of modification, I used agave instead of sugar, and wheat flour , but tey are awesome! A tad salty , I like them that way, but if you don't like that decrease salt to half. I did not refridgerate, did not grease pan and did not use the sugar fork method. I just rolled them into balls then flattened slightly. They don't spread much so you can load up the baking sheet.When te time is up the ARE DONE. Even if you don't think they are, they ARE. Trust me...if you want them soft, pull them out at 8 minutes! Even this healthier version is great!

I'm a bad cookie maker. They hardly Ever turn out right. Until these!! These are truly the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had, much less made! The only changes I made were to use white whole wheat instead of all purpose flour, and I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup. After making the batter (which I did not refrigerate) I divided it into 4 parts...one part I added semi-sweet chocolate chips (@ 1/2 to 3/4 cup), the second part I added craisins and dried unsweetened coconut, the third craisins and pecans, the fourth butterscotch chips and pecans. After scooping them I did roll them into balls and squished them a little with my hands before putting on the parchment paper. I baked them 2 batches at a time for approx 9 minutes, and let them cool on the pan for 5 min before removing to a cooling rack. This recipe made 4 dozen for me. The husband doesn't like oats, so my 2 little ones and I will have to finish these off ourselves. Terrible I know. Wonderful recipe...my new go to oatmeal cookie recipe. Thank you for sharing!!

I just tried this recipe tonight, and the cookies turned out really yummy. I made them a little fancier by adding cranberries instead of rasins and walnuts. I will definitely make this cookies again. -Gracie

This is an awesome recipe! I didn't have vanilla extract, and i used about a cup of oil instead of butter. Al so, i added chocolate chips. I mixed everything as instructed and baked on 375. They came out, Really moist and a bit chewy. Soooo good! I will be keeping this recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly but did not do the addition sugar on a fork.  I also divided the batter and added raisins and chocolate chips.  I was unsure of these at first.  I never made oatmeal cookies and chocolate chip are always my go-to.  Any c.c. cookie lover knows that c.c. cookies are best right out of the oven...well...I tried one of these oatmeal cookies out of the oven and thought it was bland and flavorless.  I let them cool on a wire rack and tried one a few hours later.....still bland, still flavorless and this time...HARD.  I figured it's a cookie and my kids will enjoy them for school so I packed them up in a AIR TIGHT tupperware container and called it a day.  I gave them each one in their lunch the next day and they were raving about them inquiring how on earth I made them.  Puzzled, I told them it was easy and that they could actually make them by themselves (they are 6 and 8) and spouted off the ingredients since it was that easy and simple to recall them.  I then went to the pantry and tried one and oh my goodness...these cookies are AMAZING!!  They softened right up in the container and the cinnamon and other flavors just brewed so nicely over night.  My kids love all kinds of chocolate but they both prefer the raisins in this oatmeal cookie.  I will be making these again soon and may add some M&Ms, peanuts, cranberries or whatever else tickles my fancy.  Thanks so much!!

great recipe! i divided my dough into two batches. I mixed one with 1/3 cup walnuts and the other with chopped chocolate and I must say, both were really great. I used a little less cinnamon (about 1 tsp) though because I didn't like the taste of it. I also cut my white sugar down to 1/2 cup. Despite all these cut downs, the final product still tasted really delicious!

I've made these cookies a lot, and a huge hit in our house. The secret to a soft cookie is take out early. I take them out of the oven when the center of the cookie still looks raw.

This is a great recipe! I've been on the hunt for a good oatmeal cookie recipe and this one fits the bill. It's a great versatile base from which you can add dried fruit, chocolate, or even other spices.  Some of the issues that others described sound more like issues with technique rather than issues with the actual recipe; others could just be flukes. If your basics are covered (I.e. butter is softened, not too melted or too cold, butter and sugars are creamed for around 2 minutes, etc.) they should turn out well for you :)

Making this recipe was quick, but the mix crumbled so much, I had to throw away most of it.  I would advise using less oatmeal and a little more vanilla or butter. Although a crumbly mix, it does taste good!

Amazingly simple and tasty recipe. Followed recipe to the "T" with the exception of adding raisins. The cookies turned out as promised: Moist & Chewy with a slightly crunchy outside. Only thing that is a minor deterrent is it's a bit more time consuming than a mix and toss in the oven. I failed to see the part about letting the dough rest for at least an hour and was in a hurry to throw together a quick snack for my boys before they got home so needless to say my guys had to wait an extra hour but it was well worth it. They said that these cookies were the best oatmeal raisin cookies they'd ever had. Highly recommend! :-)

these were good, the second batch turned out better because I made them bigger cookies. I also added soaked raisins and didn't smash them down before baking. P.s. I skipped chilling the dough, it was thick enough to form balls without that extra step.

Way too much flour. Cut it back a cup, drop one of the eggs, and lose a cup of oats, then you've got a good cookie.

Well, I don't often write reviews on recipes but these cookies are so delicious I thought I may share what I did when I made them!  First of all, we didn't need two dozen so I changed the servings to 12 instead of 24.  I like raisins in my oatmeal cookies and also love walnuts in cookies so I added 1/2 cup of raisins and 1/2 cup of walnuts to the mix. I did refrigerate the dough for an hour as it does make it much easier to roll the dough into balls. Now, the recipe says to roll the dough into balls the size of a walnut, which I did, keeping them all a consistent size.  I ended up with 41 cookies!  Perhaps adding the raisins and walnuts created more volume but I wouldn't have thought it would add that much more volume!  Because we had so many, I froze two dozen and let me tell you, these cookies are the tastiest cookies I have ever had!  Right out of the freezer too!  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing this lovely recipe!  This will certainly be my go-to recipe for oatmeal cookies from now on!

Good cookies! I added chopped dates. Don't forget to grease the pan, like I did.

Delish!! Used about 3/4 cup sugar and was plenty sweet enough. Next time I'll substitute apple sauce for half of the butter and use just a half cup of sugar to get rid of some more of those calories :)

These cookies were fantastic! I did it just a little different. I reduced the salt by more than half, I added a large handful of coconut and about 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts. I also only did 1 tsp of cinnamon and added about 1/2 tsp - 1 tsp of allspice:) I did not let them sit for an hour in the fridge before, I did however leave my dough on my patio in between batches..because its Canada LOL
One last thing..I found that using a fork to flatten them helped because they did not flatten easy. I skipped the extra sugar on top though! Made about 45 cookies!

These were very good and easy to make! I didn't cook them all the way; this left them nice and soft in the middle, while the edges had a nice crispness to them!

These were delicious!  Just perfect combination of soft but not cake like...still had some of the soft "crunchiness" of the oatmeal. I did cut the sugar in half, so 1/2 cup per type of sugar and added about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. It was still pretty sweet...I think it would still be sweet enough without the chocolate chips.  I also used 3/4 cup of canola oil instead of 1 cup of butter to make it a bit more heart healthy.  And used 1.5 cups of wholewheat flour and 1/2 cup of white flour. I rolled the dough into a 2"x2" log inside a piece of parchment paper, chilled in the fridge for an hr then sliced into 24 pieces.  It was the perfect thickness, just had to place them on the sheet, no need to flatten. I cooked them for 8 mins which was a bit undercooked but that made them soft and how I like my cookies.  Will definitely be making this again and again as my hubby is an oatmeal cookie lover.

Last tray of these is in the oven now. I cut the recipe by half and added about 1/2 cup of raisins. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!! My hubby and I scarfed them. 1/2 the recipe makes about 30 cookies for me. The first dozen will be gone before the last six are even done. This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe I've ever had. It's definitely going in my regular cookie rotation.

These are just what I was looking for.  I did not flatten the cookies, just baked the balls.  They flattened out some during baking, but not too much.  Very good flavor-my husband says they are addicting. I like the texture of the oats, but still find the cookie to be quite moist.  This recipe is a keeper.

Turned out great. Subbed half dark brown sugar for light to boost flavor. Reduced sugar to 3/4 c.  Pressed down lightly without sugar and cooked for 8 min till still slightly undercooked.  Used regular oats instead of quick cooking making for a nice chewy texture.Made 3 variations with one dough (raisin, chocolate chip, and cranberry white chocolate.)

These oatmeal cookies are fantastic!  Contrary to other reviews, they ARE very moist :)  I like adding dried fruits/nuts to mine and use a glass dipped in sugar to flatten them (but only to about 1/2in.).  I don't think using the extra sugar when flattening is necessary, but does add a nice touch to the cookies!  For those who may not be getting cookies quite as soft as they would like, just a little tip...  make sure you are using REAL butter!!!  Margarine is NOT good for baking (unless specifically called for in rare circumstances)! ;)

My entire family loved these cookies. They said that they were the best cookies I've made yet and I must agree with them. Very easy to make. I left them in the oven for about 9-10 minutes and they came out extremely soft, moist and didn't fall apart. I used "Bob's Red Mill" gluten free old fashioned rolled oats. This recipe made nearly 3 dozen cookies. I let them cool on the cookie sheet as directed and then transferred them directly to my pub table on some parchment paper. All of the cookies were gone within 2 days.

Over all this was a very successful recipe! I added 1 cup choc chips and cut the cinnamon down to 1 teaspoon.  1 Teaspoon cinnamon was perfect, but I would add more choc chips. The total amount should be somewhere between 1.5-2 cups.  Thank you for sharing such a solid recipe!  Delicious!

Absolutely amazing. These are the kind of cookies that are going in my family's special recipe collection. I was craving those Grandma's Iced Oatmeal cookies (the crunchy ones at the store) so I used this recipe to recreate them and they turned out amazing! 
I followed the recipe exactly, although I added 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg and clove to add a hint of spice, and 1/2 cup of nuts for some crunch. Flattened them (these don't spread, and I didn't chill them either) and baked at 375 for 12 minutes. They were thick, crunchy and absolutely delicious. I iced half of them with a vanilla icing which made them that much better, although the plain ones were equally as delicious!

So easy and delicious.  I had all the ingredients on hand (that never happens for me).  My 3-year-old loved helping -- her favorite part was rolling them into balls.  We didn't flatten them and they took a little longer to bake (about 14 minutes), but they came out delicious.  We also added raisins.

These are the BEST cookies and are probably my favorite, even over the classic, Chocolate Chip!  I modify the recipe by adding only 1/2 cup of Sugar as I find that to be plenty.  I don't do the "fork thing", either.  I let them chill while I'm cleaning up the dishes, so only about 20 minutes, and that works just fine to make them a little firmer.  I roll them into balls using my hands, and they bake into thick, soft, moist cookies.  My biggest piece of advice is to really watch them and DON'T let them overcook - I often let them undercook a bit - or they won't be moist.  Great recipe!!

READ THIS TO LEARN MY SECRET! I use recipies as inspiration and then substitute! Used half the butter, the rest no sugar applesauce. Used half the brown sugar. Used no white sugar, substituted with 1/3 cup Truvia (sugar substitute). Used 2 tsp vanilla. Substituted 1 TB of apple pie spice for the cinn.(This was my "secret"!) Added 1 cup of chopped apples, 1 cup raisins, 1 cup walnuts. Just scooped onto cookie sheet without rolling in a ball or flattening. 12 min 350 deg.

They cooked a little strange, but the flavor was good. I added cranberries and raisins to spice it up. Make sure to space them out a lot and be sure to chill the dough for a while before baking, because they will run everywhere into one big cookie!  that is sketchy and they don't look as good when you have to cut them.

This is my favorite oatmeal cookie recipe.  Very easy, you do not need to refrigerate in my opinion.  I don't bother with the sugar and fork either.  I just make them like regular drop cookies, adding a cup of raisins as suggested.  The cookies come out so nice, crispy on the outside and soft in the middle.  I guess I make mine smaller because I get 4 dozen from a batch.

I have never liked oatmeal cookies, but for some reason I had the urge to make them. These were amazing! I now love oatmeal cookies as long as they're these ones. I followed the recipe almost entirely, but I added a small amount (maybe 1/3 cup) of yogurt covered raisins and apple chips (both cut up very small) from some apple cinnamon trail mix I had. I know they would have been fantastic without the changes though. Thanks for the recipe!

they are most perfect cookies!! they have the best flavor and texture!! but they are not soft at all.... they are crispy but somehow moist and chunky... I used 2 cups of white sugar because I didn't have brown sugar and they turned out great... also DO NOT forget to grease the cookie sheets!! because they get really stuck in the cookie sheets if you don't. I will really save this in my favorites list!

Awesome recipe; simple to follow even for inexperienced cooks / bakers, and easy to change around by adding chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, coconut (shredded) for a few examples.  Made these for my neighbours and had to do 2 more batches.  Everyone loved them!!

Bittersweet1, I have hated oatmeal all my life. My husband loves it. I made your recipe just for him and wound up eating most of the batch. You converted me! These cookies are moist, sweet and delightful. Thank you! (I added plumped raisins and look forward to adding pecans or walnuts next time.)

Cookie perfection!  Instead of 3 cups of oats, I used 2 cups of SPELT flakes and 1 cup of oats.  I didn't dip the fork in sugar, simply made drop cookies and the dough did not need to sit in the fridge.  Absolutely to die for!  So chewy and soft. Couldn't stop eating these and the kids raved about the delicious taste.  A definite winner.

These were delicious!!!  I threw in about a cup of raisins.  I had to cook mine closer to 12 minutes and I think I may add more cinnamon next time, but overall, they were by far the best oatmeal cookies I ever made.

These were delicious!  I had the hankering for something sweet but 'healthy' so I set to work finding a good oatmeal cookie recipe.  This was easy and packed full of flavor.  I cut the recipe down to a dozen which lasted all of two hours in my house before my husband my kids and I had gobbled down the entire batch.  Then of course is the question, 'So mom, are you going to make any more?' haha ;)  Awesome cookies! Thanks for the recipe.

I grew up making oatmeal cookies that flew off the tray, and these might be even better! I made them exactly as written, and was not disappointed. My family gobbled these up and requested I make them again two days later. Looks like I'm off to the store to buy more oatmeal!

Perfect cookie. I soaked raisins and dried cranberries in water and added them to the cookie dough at the end. No nuts. Outstanding

A wonderful, some may say basic recipe but I have been trying to find a recipe to duplicate my husbands Mother's recipe for 30 years now! I found it! I add raisins (as did Mom) but I use organic very plump sweet Thompson raisins and they make all the difference when adding raisins to this great recipe. 
I make several batches at a time using a Kitchen Aid mixer, makes it so much easier and faster and then I roll them in to a cylinder shape much like the already made cookie dough you find at the market that you would slice and bake. Then I seal them and freeze. When my family wants cookies I simple take one out , defrost slice and bake. Easy and good!

A great basic oatmeal cookie recipe... I made mine without any additions... if you do add something sweet such as raisins or chocolate chips I would definitely recommend cutting back on the sugar... also I don't think it is necessary to flatten these I did mine both ways and the ones I didn't flatten spread just about perfect while the flattened ones got a little thin... I used rolled oats because that is what I had on hand... I am sure it would taste great with the addition of nuts or raisins as well...

I have made many oatmeal cookies but none as good as these. I followed the recipe exactly except I halved it and got about 16 good size cookies. I just rolled them into balls did not bother pressing flat and they spread perfectly.

I only had enough oats for 2 cups...so instead of the full batch, I revised it for 16 servings, and it was perfect!  For the 1 1/4 cup eggs, I just put 2 small eggs in.  They are so yummy!!  Next time, I'll be sure to have enough oats to make a full batch.  Going to try peanut butter instead of butter too, with chocolate chips!

SO....2 days later I made these again!  Full recipe this time!  I halved the recipe so that I could add dried blueberries to one batch and butterscotch chips to the other half.  FANTASTIC!!  Oh, and you DO want to wait about 5 minutes to take them off the pan...you'll fight with them and they will crumble to pieces as you try to pry them off the pan right out of the oven.  It was like they were burnt and stuck to the pan, so I left them for a bit, and wellah!  They came off easily & perfect condition!  SUPER SUPER RECIPE!! Will be passing this one to the kids/grandkids!  ~Thanks!

Very delicious cookies. I recommend leaving them in balls and not pressing them down, that will definitely help keep them soft and chewy. Also, I omitted pressing them down with a fork dipped in sugar, the recipe for my liking has enough sugar already! Also I found that they only need to bake for 8-9 minutes tops depending on your oven of course. Enjoy, I know myself, family, and friends did!

I lost my recipe for Rolls Royce Oatmeal cookies 20 years ago, and have been looking for an acceptable substitute for a long time.  This recipe comes the closest to it than any I have ever found. I suggest you follow the baking times and temperature precisely - I bake my cookies for only eight (8) minutes, and they come out perfect every time - warm, soft, chewy and with a terriffic flavor.

Kudos to the nice person who provided this recipe - it is now part of my recipe collection that I will be handing down to my children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews.

Your recipe will now be part of our lives forever.

Thank you very much!

best oatmeal cookie recipe I've tried- when I add raisins I soak them in hot water for about 10 minutes and then drain well before adding them- this keeps the raisins nice and soft.  I use this base oatmeal cookie recipe now for all kinds of cookies- adding chocolate chips, nuts, cranberries or whatever else I have handy. Although I  do use a touch less sugar just because I don't like my cookies quite as sweet. I also may use a little less oatmeal if I'm going to be putting alot of other stuff in.  I've also found you can use whole wheat flour and it works well too.

BEST oatmeal cookies I have ever had or made. I don't bother chilling the dough, just drop onto the cookie sheet by the tablespoonful ... Makes nice big chewy cookies. Delicious.

The best oatmeal cookie recipe I've tried. I made a few changes. I used regular oats and added 1 tsp of nutmeg. I split the batter in half and added 3/4 cup of raisins to one half of the batter and dark chocolate chips with dried cranberries to the other half. Both types of cookies turned out fabulous.

I agree with other reviewers, that these cookies are delicious, but not 'moist' as the recipe promises. You can definitely skip the sugar sprinkled on top if you make them according to the recipe, and no need to chill the dough. The second time I made these and added 1/4 cup of molasses and sprinkled sugar on top to counteract they bitterness--they came out much more chewy and moist.

THANK YOU!!! What an awesome cookie! I've been searching forever for a "go-to" oatmeal cookie and finally...! :) My husband couldn't wait for the 1 hr. chilling time-but they still turned out great. Years ago, I worked at a bakery and was taught to roll out the cookie dough into a thick log-then slice into 3/4" pieces-then bake. They turn out so uniform that way. If, like me, others couldn't wait for the "chillin' time", the flatter ones make awesome ice cream sandwiches. Just put a dollop of ice cream between two cookies, wrap in foil and freeze. Next time will put in fridge for the hour to get them thicker-but for taste, these can't be beat. (I can't tell you how many recipes I've gone through!) Thanks again!

These cookies are just great.  I used 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. shortening, only because I had but one stick of butter left in my fridge (I did my shopping after putting the dough together).  I kept the rest of the recipe the same.  I divided the dough in half and made one batch with dark and golden raisins (soaked in warm water, drained) and the other with dried cranberries (also soaked and drained) and some chopped walnuts.  The cookies baked for exactly 10 min. and still came on nice and soft.  Both varieties were delicious.

These are the best Oatmeal cookies We have ever made.  We added chopped dried cranberries and it was delicious. We did not flatten the cookie, when we take them out of the over we lightly drop the pan on the counter, it makes them perfect

Quick Tip: do not leave them more then ten minutes they might not look cooked but if you can see a light golden brown color on them then trust me they're ready! I made this mistake the first time i made these and they burnt. Also leave them to cool a little before taking off cookie sheet because they will be a bit soft. I also added a few m&m's on top for color :)

This is so far the best recipe for oatmeal cookies I've found. I made a half batch and so far, they're perfect!  I tweaked a little for altitude (5000 ft) by taking out a pinch of baking soda. I also doubled the vanilla and added a little vanilla powder to the flour mixture to replace the soda and up the flavor. I also added about 3/4 butterscotch chips to make oatmeal scotchies. 

This will be my go-to oatmeal cookie recipe for now. I can only give it 4 stars because it calls for quick cooking oats instead of plain rolled oats. I had to compensate by chopping up half my oats with a knife.

I adore this oatmeal cookie! I thought everything about them was perfect. I followed the ingredients exactly but I did do a few things differently. I ended up leaving the batter in the fridge overnight (but only because I ended up not having the time to bake them)I never added the sugar when pressing your cookie down, but the best thing I did was take 2 cookies, put a HUGE scoop of ice-cream between them and had the best icecream sandwhich EVER!! We tried one right after the cookies cooled, but the best way was to freeze the whole sandwhich. I made these cookies last week, & I'm now making them again, as I type the batter is in the fridge! Thank you for the best oatmeal cookie recipe I've tried yet! :)

I only bake 8 min bc I like all my cookies soft and chewy best!  This was my first time baking oatmeal cookies, and I wanted to compare to a generic recipe on my oatmeal box; so, I did a batch of this recipe and a batch of generic.  This one was definitely the better one! :)  Next time I'll experiment with raisens!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  2/27/12 I've been tasting between the two recipes, and find this one a bit too sweet; next time I would put in only 1 tsp of cinnamon and maybe cut the salt slightly..and then adjust sugars in following trials.

This recipe was delicious moist and crisp on the outside. I used old fashion oats and unsalted butter and I also separated the dough and added ghirardelli chocolate chips to one batch, raisins to another and left one part plain. My boys loved them. This recipe is a definite keeper.

These are fabulous! I tried to healthy them up a bit my substituting 1/2 cup of the flour with 1/4 cup wheat germ and 1/4 cup whole wheat flour and you can't tell at all, even my kids love them! I left some plain, and then mixed in dried fruit, raisins and chocolate chips for a variety. Will definately make these again! Thanks!

Awesome cookies!  I was never a fan of oatmeal cookies until these.  The only modifications I made were that I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup, didn't chill the dough and I didn't flatten them,  I just flattened them slightly with my hand after I rolled them, and they came out great.  10 min was perfect for me.  I actually iced half of them (husband's request) and left the others plain.  For the icing I just used powdered sugar and milk, and they were great both ways.  I didn't find them too sweet at all, even with the icing, and they're still soft after 4 days.  This is a recipe I will keep and make often.  Thanks!

I love these cookies! I gave 4 stars because of my changes but feel the end result is 5 stars. I use rolled oats not quick oats.  I also used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 white. As I don't like cookies too sweet and  I always add other sweet extras such as choc chips or raisins, I only add the cup of brown sugar and omit the white sugar altogether. 
I make one batch which I prefer with raisins, crumbed walnuts, cinnamon and allspice the other batch my husband prefers with milk choc chips and I omit the cinnamon.  I've also made them with white choc chips and dried blueberries but didn't like these as much although they were still eaten very quickly. Don't over bake and they are moist and stay that way for days in a plastic container.  The dough freezes well as individual cookies put in a freezer bag as previously suggested to make fresh cookies whenever you feel like it.

In less than 3 days, I have made two batches of these cookies adding 1 cup each of semi sweet chocolate chips and chopped pecans. They have disappeared with in 24 hours of baking.  This is the PERFECT cookie recipe!

Delicious and i made these in less than 2 hours. I did not need to refrigerate the dough for at least an hour. I put them straight into the oven. I did not dip the cookies in sugar either. The most important thing is that they came out real chewy. Depending on how you like your cookies. For a chewy cookies, it can be less than 11 min in the oven.  Good recipe!

These cookies were soft and delicious. I made them different times using chocolate chips, craisins and raisins...delicious every time. I did not chill the dough or use a fork to flatten and they still turned out great. Thank you for this recipe.

Awesome! I didn't have eggs so I subbed 1/2 cup strawberry yogurt- delish! This actually makes 48 2" cookies so you could definitely half it if needed. Quick and good cookie fix recipe.

This is the BEST oatmeal cookie recipe! I add 1 cup of raisins and 1 cup of chopped walnuts and they are delicious! Don't refrigerate the dough or you'll end up with burnt cookies! Also don't squish them down or they'll end up not chewy or soft.

I usually use the Quaker oatmeal recipe they have on their lid of the oatmeal container. This recipe is so much better!  I'm hooked!

These were soft (I did not flatten with a fork), but pretty flavorless cookies.  Need more brown sugar and cinnamon.  Disappointed, especially since I doubled the recipe!

This is my favorite oatmeal cookie recipe...the recipe that others ask me for after trying the cookies.  They are perfect--soft and nicely spiced.  I make them exactly according to the recipe.  Some of my taste-testers layered these with cream cheese frosting to make whoopie pies.

Pretty good- tastes like an oatmeal cookie.  Recipe doesn't deviate too much from a standard oatmeal cookie recipe-slightly more flour and sugar. I'm not sure if I could tell the difference in a blind taste test from this and a Quaker Oats recipe, assuming they are baked correctly. this one may taste a little sweeter. I would use this again and found nothing wrong with it- it just didn't "wow" me enough for 5 stars.

I needed a quick and easy "Santa" cookie recipe, and this was PERFECT.  From start to finish they took me one hour to deliver moist, delicious oatmeal cookies.  For those people who use Victorian Epicure spices, I substituted the cinnamon for Poudre Douce (same amounts) and the results are fantastic.  Thank you for saving the day!

These cookies were great! They were soft even after a week they still hold up to their name. I found them to be a bit too sweet for my liking so I reduced the amount of white sugar to half a cup instead of the whole cup. I added raisins and walnut pieces and my kids gobbled them up. This recipe is a keeper.

Excellent! Added 1 tsp extra vanilla and the vanilla I used was double strength vanilla. Cookies in a tin retained their flavor four days later.

Love these. They are soft and moist and just plain delicious. I add milk chocolate chips occasionaly just for a little something sweeter. They never last more than a couple of days around our house. Just too good.

These are wonderful if you follow the advice of those who said cut out a half a cup of oats so they stay moist. I put raisins in a batch and they were very tasty. Even my son who is not a raisin fan loved them.

Made the recipe exactly how it says the 1st time & found that, sugar forking makes the cookies too sweet (but it was still a big hit). 2nd time without the sugar forking was a charm!!! It's a huge hit!!! The kids & adults love it!! 

I've even added crushed pecans, made some with walnuts, and my favorite was ones I made with pecans, semi-sweet chocolate morsels & Angel Flake Coconut sweetened!!! Delish!!

By the way, I've only used Great Value 100% Whole Grain Quick Oats!!

This is one recipe that will remain in my families kitchen for years to come!  Thank You!!!

I'm a novice baker but I had an easy time baking these cookies. And not only that, they turned out delicious! My boyfriend and his family couldn't stop eating them. I even made them for my students and a bunch if them wanted seconds. I'm not even a oatmeal cookie person but this recipe changed my mind.

Very good! I used old fashioned oats, and didn't crush the cookies. They would have been thinner and not as soft. My husband ate like 20 of them, and I had to make him not eat the rest. LOL!

I am currently baking these cookies, we've eaten 4 of them soon as they cooled, not sure I can keep the guys from finishing them off before I'm done cooking them all. Made recipe as written for the first time, winner recipe for sure.  The 2 dozen it says I am not sure about, I'm making them about 3 inches across and am on #43 with about 2 cups of mix still to bake.  Used real butter and did not place mix in fridge, just started baking. Added raisins to the mix, about a 1/2 cup(?), just eye-balled them.  Will make these again!

First time making oatmeal cookies, they came out really good.  After I tasted the first batch, I thought they needed something else so I added some cinnamon sugar to the tops of the individual cookies after I placed them on the cookie sheet, and they tasted better.  They are soft & chewy which is what I like, so they were perfect.  I also found that 11 minutes was the perfect time to cook in my oven.  Will definitely make these again & again.

These are great. I added a little more cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. I also refrigerated mine for 2 days prior to baking because of my work schedule. Next time I am going to roll it into a log before refrigerating that long because it was a little crumbly and harder to roll into ball. Great taste though and mine weren't too moist but undercooking a few minutes helped keep them a little bit softer.

These are wonderful! Soft inside and a little crisper on outside. I was out of vanilla so used about a Tbsp of Honey. I was surprised they turned out as well since the dough was a little harder than most cookies but they really turned out great.

I did as others said and didn't refrigerate I just used my cookie scoop and cooked them right away without pressing down, I would not recommend not pressing them down.  My cookies would not fully bake.  On the 4th pan I decided to press them down to see if it made a difference and it definately did.  Also they were a bit salty so next time I would omit 1/4 of the salt.  Otherwise they have a great flavor and I will be trying them again.

This recipe is reallly good.  Soft and chewy all together.  I did however change to 1/2 cup margerine and 1/2 cup shortening.  They did not spead, and I took them out as soon as they turned golden brown.

Great and easy.  I thought I was adding plain chocolate chips and added mint chips instead - what a surprise - these were better then the raisin ones or subsequent ones that I have made with regular chocolate chips.  I have also made with toffee chips.  All are good but the ones that are plain or with the mint chips go the fastest.  If you want chewy, which is what we love, do not overcook.  Enjoy experimenting with different additions!  Thanks for the recipe

These were great!  I halved the recipe and used 2T less butter (so 4T for the full recipe) and added 1 big spoonful of peanut butter (about 4T, so 8T for full recipe).  After chilling, I added about 3oz mini chocolate chips.  The peanut butter goes great with the heavy cinnamon in this recipe, but it is not so strong that you can pinpoint the flavor.  I baked for 11 min and they are perfectly soft the next day, but please do enjoy one still warm!

Listened to a few suggestions. I cut sugars down to 3/4 cup each. I also only used 1 tbsp. cinammon because I didn't want it to be overwhelming. I would consider cutting down the cinammon some more next time. It's still a bit sweet, but it's fine. I cooked mine for 10 minutes.

These cookies are the BOMB!!!! I am proud to say this was my first batch of oatmeal cookies and my family loved them! I did make my own modifications, instead of butter I used coconut oil, and I added 1/4 cup of  1% milk! I also added raisins! Delicious is an understatement!

Amazing, best oatmeal cookies I ever ate! They were so soft, moist, and had beautiful color. I did make some changes that were very slight. I use margarine instead of butter just what I had on hand and I added 1 cup of raisins and 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. I also only chilled the cookie dough for 45 minutes and I didn't grease my cookie sheet I used parchment paper. I made very large cookies so my cooking time was about 15 minutes. They looked so gourmet, these cookies were very impressive to look at and amazing in flavor. I will be making these again and giving them as gift!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! It was so easy and it was easy to adjust to a healthier version. I used peanut oil (partly cause I was almost out of butter) for lower cholesterol and splenda instead of sugar, now I'm wishing I had omitted the eggs and used egg whites. Oh well, that means I'll have to make them again ;) Only bother was how stiff the dough was, had to use ALOT of elbow grease towards the end.

I found that my cookies seemed to cakey. I will try again with less flour and maybe only two cups of oats. I enjoyed the flavor I just like a different texture.

These are awesome! I made a batch with dried blueberries (oceanspray) and some with whole pecans on top. I also added a dash of nutmeg too to round out the flavor. The chilling of the dough is very important to get and even bake! Also, if you are able to chill or at the very least keep the baking sheet cool till the last second that will help keep the dough from spreading and cooking unevenly. The first time I made as directed and loved it (5 stars). This time I added to aforementioned items and still loved it (5 stars). I always found oatmeal cookies underwhelming, but I actually prefer these to the "Award Winning Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies" recipe, which I so adamantly stood by for the longest time (which I got from this site) its still a good recipe, too. Try! I have tried raisins, chocolate chips, pecans and blueberries...all wonderful ways to change-up the cookie. Though, they are superb by themselves :-)

Very good cookie - easy & fast recipe!  I made it as stated with no revisions & it was good.  Refrigeration is definitely not needed; I made it as a drop cookie, they don't spread too much which I liked.

I am very picky about by oatmeal cookies. this however was ACES! they were delish and easy to make. however, i realized from my own impatience that its imperative you refrigerate it for 1 hr at least! I makes all the difference! Thanks so much for sharing this with us!

These cookies were yummy!  I did not change a thing in the original ingredients but I scooped out the dough instead of flattening with sugared fork.  I added 1 cup of semi-sweet morsels.  They were crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I would definitely make them again.

Very moist and crumbly! These are by far the best oatmeal cookies in the world. After the balls of cookie dough were on the cookie sheet instead of flattening the balls with a fork I just left them the way they were and they turned out very thick and moist. I will never make any other cookie besides these. this is now my family's favorite cookie by far.

If you follow the recipe to a T, you will get soft oatmeal cookies. I made a mistake by listening to some reviewers and did NOT flatten my first sheet of cookies, which left me with very round cookies that needed extra time to finish baking and turned out too brown outside just to be baked inside. The next sheet I did flatten (without the sugar coating, works just as well) and in exactly 8 minutes I had soft oatmeal cookies :)

I made these a while ago and they were the best oatmeal cookies I have ever had.  I will be making them again soon, but adding chocolate chips.  I did chill, but did not flatten with a sugared fork--I just left them in balls.  SO good!

These were great!  I did use white whole wheat flour (King Arthur brand) and also used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored Crisco to keep them from being too flat.

Made 1/3 with pomegranate craisins; 1/3 with chocolate yogurt covered raisisns and 1/2 wirh rum soaked raisins.  I added an extra TBSP of flour to the portion with the run soaked raisins to soak up the extra moisture.

Baked only 7 min and I used the rollinto ball method.  Made 61 cookies - 

This is a keeper!

The cookies taste really great and I was very satisfied in finding such a simple recipe, but the cookies did come out a little funky.

These cookies are fantastic! I added a cup of raisins and a half cup of walnuts...yum! I would suggest baking them for no more than 8 minutes, maybe even for 6-7 muinutes to keep them nice and soft.

Soft and moist. I made it just like the recipe said and added some raisins for the last couple batches. They were great and soft!! I didn't put it in the fridge first, made the first batch then stuck it in the freezer while they baked and just kept it in the freezer in between batches. They came out perfectly.

Fabulous cookie recipe! I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and I didn't bother flattening them down or adding additional sugar to the top. These are so soft and yummy. I've been wanting to try making oatmeal cookies for awhile and these do not disappoint!

This was a great recipe, however, I found that there was too much sugar. When I made this recipe, I cut it down to 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar and it was still too sweet. Next time, I will cut the sugar down a little bit more. I also tried a variation - to one half of the mixture I added about a 1/2 cup of diced dried cranberries and a 1/2 cup of coconut; and to the other half I made plain oatmeal but then I melted down some semi-sweet and white chocolate and dipped the cooled cookies in one of the chocolates and then drizzled the other chocolate on top.

I've never been a fan of oatmeal cookies until now. These were yummy. I made a batch with raisins, a batch without, and then today a batch with white chocolate chips. Every batch turned out great. I did add a touch more cinnamon to the plain ones, and a few drops more of the vanilla to all (I like vanilla). Make SURE that the butter is softened before you start and they will be wonderful.

Very good.  Only use brown sugar and 1 1/2 cups instead of 2 and it's still very sweet.  I don't eat raisins but I like my cookies to have that nutty bite so I use wholewheat flour.  Also I use 5 spice and ginger in place of plain cinnamon.

These were outstanding.  I followed the recipe exactly and then added half a bag of mini chocolate chips.  I'll be honest, they seemed really stiff after I let them cool.  I had to pry them off the pan, so I was very worried about them.  However, the next day, they were SO soft and chewy.  This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe that I've found.

Good recipe but too sweet, and I can normally drink honey and molasses straight from the bottle!  I did add some nuts and chips and raisins, but this only made them sweeter.  Will find a different recipe.

These were good, not exactly soft, depends on the cooking time. I divided the batter into thirds. I added chocolate chips in one, peanut butter in second batch and raisins/cinnamon/nutmeg/ginger in the third. I did get 24 good sized cookies. This recipe is OK, normal. This recipe is equally as good as my friends oatmeal cookie recipe.

These turned out exactly as I hoped...soft but a little crispy.   I added butterscotch chips (the whole bag makes the cookies really sweet but half a bag is just perfect to me).  I didn't flatten them with the sugared fork since the chips add enough extra kick in the sweet department.  Thanks for the recipe, Bittersweet1!

Great cookies. I followed the ingredients perfectly, but I did not chill them and left them round. I baked them for a full 10 minutes at only 350 degrees and they turned out absolutely fantastic.

Ok, these are incredible! I made the cookies exactly as written except I cut the recipe in half since it's just me and my son who like oatmeal cookies...that was until the other kids tasted them then Iwish I would've made the full amount. I did add to the half recipe 1/8tsp of ground cloves, and also to a few cookies I added some craisins. Very,very good, this is my new oatmeal cookie recipe!

Found this after the BF said that he had a craving for Oatmeal Cookies, he prefers soft ones. These were amazing!!  Didn't change anything but I did add some chocolate/peanut butter chips to the last batch.  BF loved these and we will be making these time and time again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty darn good! I didn't give it five stars, because I only added 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1 cup brown and 1/2 cup white. I added extra cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp cloves, since I like a spicier oatmeal cookie. I also took others' advice and didn't chill them for an hour, just dropped by tablespoonful onto ungreased cookie sheets. None the less, this is a great basic cookie recipe - nice and soft and tasty!

Instead of butter I used margarine and canola oil. I didn't have lemon extract, so I threw in some Captain Morgan instead, and added a little honey. They were delicious! Really do need something else, though, along the lines of nuts, chocolate chips--my roommate suggested apple bits, we may try that.

Just plain fantastic. Didn't need the sugar on top since they were already sweet enough, but I did flatten them. They were fantastic, soft and chewy, and easy to make.

Very good! Decreased sugar to 1.5 cups and used all brown. Used 1.5 cups whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup ground flaxseed instead of all purpose. Increased baking soda to 1.5 teaspoons because whole wheat flour is heavier than white. Used 2 cups oatmeal and 1 cup oat bran. Added bittersweet chocolate chips and pecans to half the batter and coconut and craisins to the other half. Did not refrigerate dough or press with fork. All was great, cookies were soft inside (cooked 8 mins). Will definitely make again and will try subbing 1/2 of butter with sweet potato baby food (a much healthier substitution than apple sauce).

These cookies are the best!  I can see these quickly becoming a family favorite!  I divided the dough and baked some with butterscotch chips added and some without.  Both are outstanding! Next time I'll try chocolate chips, dried cranberries and/or nuts just for fun.

OH my goodness these are so good!  Super easy to make too.  I used slightly less oatmeal because the batter was so thick.  Baked for about 8-9 minutes and they are soft and delicious!

I made these cookies just like the recipe and they came out perfect and delicious. They are moist and chewy with a nice light crispy edge. I baked them at 375degrees for 9 minutes, just until they are a bit underdone and then let them sit on the pan for 2 minutes and removed. I split the dough into thirds and made plain, with raisins and with chocolate chips. Refrigerating the dough helps with even cooking and also helps blend the flavors. I did not press the cookies down because this step really isnt necessary. Before making ANY changes to this recipe I highly suggest you try it as is. I do not find them too sweet, they are perfect. If you follow the directions and dont make any changes then you will come out with the BEST oatmeal cookie. I used parchment paper because greasing the pan usually gives the cookies a dark bottom. Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious!  I planned on following the recipe exactly.  But I started making it and realized I didn't have vanilla.  So I added some nutmeg and honey to add flavor.  Then I realized I had vanilla & caramel creamier in the fridge...so I added a few teaspoons of that to add vanilla flavor.  The texture of these cookies are so good.  I used 1 1/2 Tablespoon sized scoops and would have made about 32 cookies with this recipes.  Cooked them for 9 minutes.

Perfect oatmeal cookie.  Just the texture I was hoping for.  Added some butterscotch chips.  Used the small pampered chef scooper and got 32 cookies from a half batch.  Did not flatten down.

A yummy, chewy cookie with crisp outsides! I found this recipe after my brother had started to make the Tollhouse chocolate chip cookies. He added everything except the flour, so I took over from there and just added flour, oats, cinnamon, and more sugar to the dough. I also added chocolate chips. Make like you would make chocolate chip cookies- drop by spoonfuls or form into balls and place on cookie sheets. They spread a bit, but don't get too flat. After 10 minutes, they might look undercooked, but once they cool they'll be chewy. It makes 48 cookies.

These cookies are fantastic!  They are simple to make and I usually have all the ingredients on hand which is nice.  My boyfriend requested that I add some craisins..and they are delicious! Usually I bring half of all the goodies I make to work to share with everybody..but my boyfriend has stated that "these cookies are staying here..no giving these ones out!"

Excellent recipe. Cut back the white sugar to just slightly less than 1/2 cup, otherwise followed ingredients list through the adding of the oatmeal. Did as some others described and made a third of the batch with golden raisins, another third with craisins and white chocolate chips and the final third with M&Ms. Big fan of the raisins and M&Ms. I think I'll try another type of combo instead of the craisins/white chocolate chips next time.

These cookies are to die for!!!  No need to refrigerate them before you put them in the oven.  I added white chocolate chips to the recipe and it tasted great!  Bake it for 7 minutes and they come out soft.  Enjoy!

Not chewy. I think next time I'm going to try per suggestion of adding clove for 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. And don't press them. But my husband likes them and that's who I made them for.;)

Absolutely delicious!  I am living in Germany and my German wife fell in love with Pepperidge Farms soft baked oatmeal cookies while living in the US for a year.  I myself, have always loved them.  Unfortunately, they are unattainable here.  Problem solved! I had forgotten what a real cookie tasted like...til now.  Thanks!

I used shortening instead of butter. I did not chill the dough and I soaked raisins in the eggs for awhile to plump them before adding them to the sugar mixture. The dough was alittle crumbly but the taste is awesome!

The best ... perfect soft cookie! Added Ocean Spray Craisins and pecans. Have made them 3x in 2 weeks and they don't last but a few days. To keep moist, put a slice of bread in the cookie jar. Thanks soooo much!

I used all organic turbinado sugar & whole wheat flour because that is what I had on hand. Added a 1/2 tsp of baking powder to compensate for the whole wheat flour.  Added 1 cup of chocolate chips. I also used an ice cream scoop to put them on the baking sheet.  They kept this nice round shape. So yummy!  They were moist and cake-like.

We substituted wheat-free flours for the wheat flour, and they came out terrific following the timing advice regarding pulling them out right away.  Thanks so much for sharing. We used the base recipe for cranberry-white chip and for "cowboy cookies".

Can't wait to try this recipe.  I will add pecans for a nice crunch.  Thanks Bittersweet1 for sharing your cookie recipe with the world.

OMG!  I made these tonight Dec. 29, 2010. I ate 4 coming out of the oven.  These cookies are fantastic.  Store bought cookies are now history.

These cookies are fantastic! I made up a batch and they were gone that night. I made half a batch with chocolate chips and they were amazing.  The only thing I did differently was not smash them with the fork, I just made drop cookies. They turned out great regardless.

These taste like a great snickerdoodle cookie, not like an oatmeal cookie. Also following the directions for baking and these cookies are soft but flat. I didn't flatten out the cookies after the first pan and although they don't look done coming out of the oven, once they cool off they will be soft and chewy and thicker. If you want a chewy and thick cookie, don't flatten them.

I tried the recipe on the oatmeal box and they come out very cake like. My husband and I really enjoyoatmeal cookies so I decided to keep trying until I found something we both like and this is it! Excellent recipe and even better when you add your own thing to it such as raspberries or raisins, whatever you like.

my cookies turned out great!! I did someting a little different, I used whole wheat and pastry flour. I also sifted them both. I added Raisins   You really don't need to flaten with a fork. I tried both and they turned out yummy......

Pretty solid recipe, but I didn't think chilling the dough was necessary. I added chocolate and raisins.

These were great!!  Moist and soft, but not mushy!  I didn't chill the hour recommended, only because I didn't read that part until the 1st batch was already baking.  :)  oops!

Flavor okay and flexible with adding own spices, but pressing the walnut size rolled ball not good. Also, mixing wet and dry difficult. Will try my own alterations till I get what I wanted.

Wow. these are the best oatmeal cookies that i made in a long time. I made a few minor changes, using margerine (what i had) and i halved the recipe but used a full tsp of cinnamon a few dashes of cloves. The spices were perfect.  I was alittle worried about the bake time but these babies are perfect. Crispy on the bottom an soft and chewy in the middle. No more frustation over the quaker oat recipe. Thanks!

Mine were light and airy, and crunchy on the outside. Not very chewy. Maybe because I halved the recipe? They are definitely good, though.

I make this recipe all of the time and everyone loves it! I like to add raisins, or toffee chips and use less sugar (1/4-1/2 less). I always get a soft cookie by leaving the dough in a ball and not pressing it down with a fork. With the timing, the cookies might not seem like they're done after 10 minutes (especially if you use 2 racks), just leave them in til the sides lightly brown. Enjoy, these cookies are deeeelightful!

I didn't change anything in this recipe except I used a little less salt and I did not chill the dough before baking and did not press them down. They flattened out a bit but not too bad, perfect to my liking. I did have to cook them a little longer than 10 mins but I made them bigger than walnut size.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Tried a cookie a few minutes out of the oven, and for the first time in my life, even my 5 year old and 2 year old won't finish a cookie.

Great recipe! Cookies came out soft and previous revieweres were right, you can bake them right after you prepare the batter. I added white chocolate chips in and cinnamon sugar on top! :)

I needed to make some low-fat cookies, so instead of 1 cup of butter, I put 2 tablespoons of margarine into a 1 cup measure, then filled it with applesauce.  The final mix wasn't quite thick enough for cookies, so I added an additional 3/4 cup oats.  I made drop cookies instead of rolling the dough into balls and baked them for 9 minutes.  The result was surprisingly good!

Followed recipe exactly and the cookies were soft and delicious! I added Hershey's cinnamon chips and they enhanced the flavor even more! Will definitely make again and try different add-ins suggested by other reviewers!

Oh my, so good! Skipped the freezer step. Only trouble I had was keeping my son out of the cookie dough (almost better then the cookies themselves!). I made them slightly larger then one inch drop cookie style, and cooked for 8 minutes. They looked a little undone coming out of the oven, but hardened up around the edges after cooling and remained soft in the middle. Yum!

PERFECT!  I made this recipe just before my grandsons arrived for a sleepover.  Crisp on the edges, moist in the middle and excellent flavour. I found the recipe made over 36 cookies.  I added dried blueberries . . .yummy!  Remember to refrigerate for at least an hour for best results.

These are addicting! Very soft and chewy and yummy!  I didn't have vanilla extract so I subbed coconut extract and skipped the cinnamon and added chocolate chips.  Fabulous!

Super yummy!  The other reviews are right on!  I added 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and used old fashioned oats instead of the quick cooking oats and they were great!  Also, I did not refrigerate and it still turned out WONDERFULLY!

Wonderful recipe!  There is no need to flatten them with a fork, unless you prefer a flatter/crispier cookie.  My favorite way to make them is with a cup of butterscotch chips added, and then taking them out of the oven a bit early for soft, chewy deliciousness.  Nom, nom, nom.

These were very cakey, but not very moist.  I cut out half a cup of sugar, and added raisins, oatmeal and pecans.  No need to flatten with a fork unless you like thin and crispy cookies.

My first time making oatmeal cookies and they came out great. However, I tweaked the recipe somewhat- I added 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2tbs cinnamon and about 1/4 cup of almond milk. I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of chopped raisins. I baked them at the rec'd temp. but the appearance of the first batch wasn't too appealing- I had to turn them and put them back in the over fot eh other side to get colour.   The second batch I turned down the temp to 340c and they came out perfect!

I split the dough in half and made half chocolate chip, half raisin walnut.  Both were irresistable!

These are the BEST oatmeal chocolate chip cookies I have ever made! They weren't to dry and they were super moist in the middle. I made them for a bake sale and I had people asking me for more when they were all gone.

Great cookies. I omitted the cinnamon and added butterschotch chips and chocolate chips.  Like the others, I didn't chill the dough or roll it into balls.  I just made drop cookies onto a ungreased cookie sheet.  Very good at high elevations (4900 ft here).

I had some oatmeal I wanted to use up. Even though oatmeal cookies are not at the top of my list of favorite cookies, I thought I would make some. This recipe is FANTASTIC! I think oatmeal cookies are now at the top of my favorite cookie list.  I made a batch a couple days ago and had to make two more batches today--one went to my sister's work and they were gone in about 15 minutes. I have probably eaten at least 8 cookies so far today and ate at least that many on Monday. That's the only bad thing about these cookies, they are sooo addicting!  Like some other reviewers, I did not put in the refrigerator nor did I flatten with a glass. I didn't have the patience to wait for the dough to chill. They came out perfect!

THE BEST oatmeal cookie, we love these cookies.  I've made them with raisins, without, with all brown sugar, extra vanilla or less cinnamon.  And I do not bother to refrigerate the dough. Every time they are simply wonderful.

Wonderful cookies!!!  I made exactly as directed, though I accidently didn't use the quick cooking oats.  I added 1/2 cup golden raisins and 1/2 cup dried cranberries (the kids' favorites).  I let them chill overnight and baked them this morning.  They are delicious!!! Thanks for a great recipe!!

I was excited to make this recipe and followed it completely..They baked up completely flat, and had a baking soda after taste..Maybe if I had used self-rising flour instead of all purpose and left out the baking soda and salt, they would have been better..I will try it that way next time and rate this again..

Great recipe! My cookies came out so yummy. I had to make some minor changes, I only had a half stick of butter so I used 3/4c applesauce to replace the butter I was missing and then I added some peanut butter chips and caramel chips and that's it! They came out chewy and very tasty. And I felt that the cookies needed the full 10 min of cooking as well. So try this recipe out, you'll love it!

In an attempt to make these cookies healthier, I cut out all the butter and substituted with 3/4 cups of apple sauce and 1/4 cup of almond filling instead.  They still remained soft and chewy and tasted great (especially since they were guilt free!)

This was very good.  I did add a cup of raisins.  I found the dough to be pretty sticky.  I kept returning it to the refridgerator after preparing each cookie sheet.  Next time will put it in the freezer for an hour instead of the fridge.

These are wonderful! I did everything exactly as stated, except I didn't flatten the cookies with a fork...baked them for 10 minutes and they came out crispy on the outside but soft and chewy inside. I will definitely be making these again!

These cookies are indeed soft, even days later.  I added 1.5 cups of raisins to them and reduced the amount of sugar a small bit to compensate.  I enjoyed them but they failed to get a strong reaction from anyone else (over a dozen people).  Figure that is because oatmeal raisin are more or less the basic staple of the cookie world and are thus unlikely to wow.

There were so many inconsistencies with this recipe. First, holy unhealthy batman! These were grocery store sweet, so I would use Splenda or cut back next time. I only used about 2 cups oats because they got too thick to work with and that made them spread out more on the pan. I added raisins and ground cloves as well. I might try adding white chocolate next time. Lastly, I made 52 cookies, NOT 24!

Best oatmeal cookies ever! My boyfriend's mom is an amazing baker and she even loved them! A hint of cinnamon was brilliant. They are amazing plain, I made a third of the batch with dried blueberries and the other third with chocolate chips. They were all delicious. definitely my go-to recipe now!! I didn't leave the batch in the fridge or flatten them though. Baked with WW flour, they were healthier and still delicious. I halved the batch and still got about two dozen cookies.

Very good base recipe.... 4 stars because they do come out a bit dry and need something added in to give them more flavor, I tried dark chocolate chips this time...

Pretty good.  Added ground flax seed and used 1/2 whole wheat flour to make them a bit more nutritious

In the words of my BF: "DIVINE!" (declared with a mouthful of cookie). He professes they're good enough to package and sell. Used Earth Balance in lieu of butter. One half was raisin chocolate chip and the other half was semi-sweet and white chocolate chip with shredded coconut. They're wonderfully crispy and for this they beat 'Beth's Spicy Oatmeat Raisin Cookies' from this site. (Disclaimer: the butter to margarine edit was also done to Beth's recipe for fairness in judging.)

I rushed through this recipe (added both eggs at once; didn't refrigerate dough; just dropped by rounded spoon; didn't flatten with fork). I also split the dough in half- added 2 cups choc chips to one half; added 1 cup of white choc chips and about 1/2 cup craisins to the other half. Made a ton of cookies (needed 4 cookie sheets). Easy. Delicious. Thanks!

These are great, chewy oatmeal cookies but be warned, DO NOT double the recipe unless you have access to a super industrial strength mixer or there is a body builder in the house looking for a workout.  I usually double and even triple all my drop cookie batches. I then drop them on a cookie sheet using my cookie scoop to freeze raw.  I then put them in a ziplock after they have flash frozen.   I just pick out however many I need to bake and am good to go.  I'm sure these will freeze beautifully that way but I won't try doubling the recipe again.  My husband, teenage son and I all had to take turns mixing the dough in my dutch oven pot!   Had to make a rather messy transfer from my large kitchenaid mixing bowl.  Lucky my little dog likes oatmeal!

I made these cookies in a resonable amount of time and they turned out great.  They were a hit with the holiday crowd.  Find what oatmeal cookie recipie you like and stick with it.  I did take the advice of a previous review and took the cookies out a little early, and the softness was perfect :)  Two things people want is a good taste and softness.

These cookies were delicious! They don't flatten out too much when cooking. They stay nice and thick and soft. They didn't last too long in my house. I make double batches now!

These are fabulous!  Soft and chewy and wonderful.  My husband loves them, and he's terribly picky about cookies being the right texture.  Super easy to make.  I didn't bother with refrigerating the dough or flattening the dough balls on the cookie sheets.  I did make a few minor changes: cut back on both sugars, used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose, and used regular oats.  I also reduced the cinnamon and threw in a touch of nutmeg and ginger.  Oh, and reduced the baking time to 6 minutes.   Next time (and there will be MANY next times) I'm going to divide the dough in half and add dried cranberries and chopped nuts to one half (have to keep some unadulterated for DH).  I'm also going to tinker with the recipe bit by bit, to reduce the butter a couple tablespoons at a time (subbing applesauce).  Can't wait to play with this recipe!

Although the cookies were soft I found that they were to sweet. The amount of sugar suggested definitely needs to be reduced.

First oatmeal cookie I have ever made, and after trying 2 more, I will be  using this one from now on and always and forever. My family ate these cookies in two days flat and they were begging for more. I changed nothing but added raisins. I followed the directions exactly, and they were great. I highly recommend these cookies and after you use another oatmeal recipe you will end up back with these...they are spledid, spectacular, delicious and very easy to make and work with. A+++++++ :OP

Perfect oatmeal cookie recipe. They are soft and delicious. If anyone who rated these, saying they are not soft, I would suggest making sure not to overbake them. Any cookie will get hard if overbaked. A good rule of thumb, for any cookie, is to remove them from the oven, just before they're completely baked, and let them sit on the cookie sheet for a minute or so. This way they will continue to bake, without getting too brown or hard.

My husband's favorite cookie is oatmeal raisin.  I had been searching for years for a recipe both he and I could agree on.  I've finally found it.  If baked longer they have a bit of a darker look about them and crisper cookie texture.  If baked to "just" done they have a pale look about them adn have a nice soft texture (my favorite).  The only thing I did was add 1 cup raisins to this recipe (as it suggested in the the comments above) as we both like raisins in our oatmeal cookies.  Next time I may try with chocolate chips.  I thought the recipe had the right amount of cinnamon taste.  Very good recipe.  Will definately be keeping and making this recipe in the future.  I made a double batch (as I gift cookies for Christmas).  I used a small cookie scoop and recipe made roughly 10 dozen cookies I believe.

These are awesome.  I changed the recipe to 16 servings and used cane sugar.  I also added chocolate chips.  I skipped the refridgerater step and I didnt mash them down with the fork.  I used a melon baller and made them bite size, I didnt spray the cookie sheet either.  This made 3 full pans of 24 cookies.  Cooked them for 11 minutes and let them sit on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes before mooving to a rack to cool.  Perfect.  This recipe will be in my family now. Thanks

Its not right to rate these cookies 5 stars when they actually deserve at least 10 starts!!!  Super easy to make, very soft and the best taste ever!!!!  I find that there's no need to dip the spoon in sugar since they are perfectly sweet already.  I slightly dipped so that they would not end up cruncy.  EVERYONE has given these cookies rave reviews.  I have given them as gifts as well as baked them by the truckloads for both of my children's classes.  This recipe is a no-fail attempt and there is absolutely no need to change anything.  I added raisins but purely due to personal choice.  Your search for the perfect oatmeal cook ends right here!!!  Thank you so much for the recipe.  I will be making these over and over and over again!!!!!!

These were good, but they ended up being very flat and thin. I've made them twice now, thinking that maybe I'd done something wrong the first time around, but they were just as flat the second time. I'm not sure what's up with that, but I'll keep experimenting.

These are absolutely incredible as-is!  I make these for cookie exchanges and events and people absolutely RAVE about them!  I have even made them without refrigerating the dough and they still come out great!  For a chewier cookie, forget pressing them down with the fork and bake them by the spoonful.

These turned out great!  I made one batch and got 53 cookies.  I added Raisinettes, and they are yummy! I didn't refrigerate them, so I didn't press them down.  I added a bit of Nutmeg and 1 tsp. of Cinnamon.

Oh  Wow!  These are so great! I can't wait to take them to work tomorrow-the guys are going to Love them. I bought new pans today (the baking pans from Sam's Club) & used my new silicone liners that I got @ CostCo yesterday-clean-up was so easy.  I mixed them in the stand mixer-next time I will use the bigger bowl so I can add in more stuff.  I used both vanilla & almond flavoring, added in raisins that I plumped in the microwave & mixed in a few chocolate chips.  I wanted to add some chopped nuts, but the bowl was full. I dropped the cookies using the 2 spoon method, no chilling & they baked in about 10 minutes. Flavor & testure is great & I will freeze some so my hubby will get a few, since he is out of town right now.

AWESOME!!!! AWESOME!!!! AWESOME!!!! I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could. Oatmeal raisen cookies are my very favorite and I will forever use this recipe.  I loved how the dough rolled so easily after chilling it.  I added 1 cup of raisens and 1/2 cup of pecans.  I used Pam lightly on the cookie sheets and after baking I let them cool for 5 minutes and the cookies lifted off the cookie sheet very easily.  After I rolled 1 tablespoon of dough in a ball, I flatened the dough slightly with my fingers and they came out just perfect after baking for 9 minutes.  I thought putting more sugar on top would be too sweet since I added the raisens.  Thank you Bittersweet 1 for this fantastic recipe and Merry Christmas!!!!

The best oatmeal cookies I've ever made.  I had baked lots of different cookies the day I made these, and once I was done with the batter, I put it in the fridge to cool and forgot all about it.  The next day, the batter was concrete solid.  But I worked with it and it softened up, but not enough to add the chocolate chips that I had wanted to.  No matter, with no extra add ins they were fantastic.  Just right on the outside and chewy inside, and a nice subtle spicy smell and taste.

Wonderful!  I subbed 1/2 wheat flour, used 1/2 the salt, and made 1/2 the batch with raisins.  I might decrease the salt a bit more next time.  Everyone loved these!

My local cafe makes amazing oatmeal cookies and I've been trying to duplicate them with different recipes.  My search is over, this recipe makes those exact same cookies!  They are perfect, soft and chewy and full of flavor.  The only thing I changed was I only used 3/4 cups of each sugar instead of a whole cup, and they were still sweet enough.  I also added chopped walnuts and craisins and blackcurrants.  Oh, these are fantastic!

I made this recipe for my boyfriend's work and his boss said, "If you break up with her, I will fire you!"  They were just that good!  I followed the recipe, except I omitted the cinnamon and added chocolate chips.  Also, I didn't do the fork covered in sugar step (in my opinion, these were sweet enough with the choc chips).  I also baked them for a solid 10 minutes.  They came out AWESOME!  And they still taste great a few days later!  Thanks for the great recipe!

These cookies are great, but I'm not sure they are 5 star great.  I made them exactly like the recipe.  I also did what other reviewers had said and divided up the dough.  In some I put walnuts and chocolate chips; in another I put nuts and dried cherries, and I didn't add anything to the last group.  The cookies with something added had some thickness to them, but the ones with nothing added were very flat.  All the cookies were good.  I'm not sure why some of us had flat cookies.  I refrigerated the dough as specified.  Maybe we need a bit more flour?

What happened?!  My cookies turned out as FLAT as a pancake.  No, wait...they were FLATTER than a pancake!  =)  Although they were flat, my husband liked the taste of them.  I didn't chill the dough (because I read so many reviews that stated it wasn't necessary), and maybe that's why my cookies were so flat.  If I make these cookies again, I'll chill the dough to see if it makes a difference.  I divided my cookies into 3 batches--the first batch had chocolate chips; the second batch had cranberries; the third batch had raisins.  My husband and I liked the oatmeal chocolate chip cookies the best!

This was very delicious! I brought it to school and share with my friends and they all loved it! I just followed the recipe as is without the changes some people suggested and it turned out very well. This oatmeal cookie is soft, but not very moist and it'll last about three days before becoming very hard. Also, the cinnamon added is wonderful, it doesn't overpower, but rather come subtle to the taste buds, the first time I bit into one my eyes widened in delight!

These area fantastic!!!  I ended up chilling my dough for 24 hours (no time to bake the day I mixed them up).  The day I was ready to bake them, I took the dough out of the fridge just before leaving for a 90-minute walk; I baked them as soon as I returned and they were perfection.  I did need to flatten them down just a bit, and they still baked up very nicely.  I got 52 cookies out of this recipe, though I also added 1 package of Ghirardelli Bittersweet Chocolate Chips and 1 cup of raisins.  Thanks for posting this recipe, BITTERSWEET1; it makes the ultimate oatmeal cookie!

Mmmm this is a good Oatmeal Cookie recipe !! I followed the recipe to a T except I did have to use a 1/3 cup of margerine (ran out of butter) and they came out fine.  I also baked mine for 13 minutes (golden colour), they are still chewy in the middle but crunchy on the outside.  Very simple to make..I do not own an electric mixer (just an old fashioned hand held one) and it was still pretty easy to mix all the ingredients (just had to use my muscles lol). I, like others, did not let the mixture cool for an hour, and I did not press down with a fork+sugar... I just scooped the mixture out with a spoon on plopped it onto the cookie sheet.  Next time I'm going to try adding chocolate chips!! Yumm !! Thanks for this recipe !!

This is really good recipe. I changed some parts for making it chocolaty... So instead of 2 cups of sugar I added I cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of instant chocolate mix. As for the oatmeal I added 2 and 1/2 cup of instant oatmeals, and I added 1/2 of sliced almonds. That way I still got the soft oatmeals and with delicious chocolate and nuts :) enjoy

Okay as an always baking ~MoM~? These are by far the greatest cookies!  I altered a few steps as I was pressed on time and patience...LOL I did NOT place the dough in the fridge at all and instead used 2 spoons to scoop and scrape amount of dough to cookie sheet. I then baked each sheet for 12 minutes.  OMG!  My daughter in law and I were horrid! We'd sneak a taste of the dough between bakings-you know...to make sure the taste remained consistent! Yeah that's MY story and I'm sticking to it!  I had to make these two nights in row! Doubling the batch the next day as the first batch barely made past morning and half my sons weren't even aware that any had been made!  Yeah. They're that good!  Only ingredient changes I would dream of making would be to maybe add some chopped pecans to the mix...hmmmmm...Oh! my daughter in law and I also thought what a great flavor this dough had precooked? We're gonna take some and freeze it till hard- chop into bits. Take some vanilla ice cream and thaw till just softened.  Add the dough, mix and re-freeze!  Yeah...mmmmmm...this dough is just THAT good!  Also great with your favorite coffee to wash those cookie crumbs down! Hehehehe

Cookies were saltier than I'm used to. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It took the full 10 minutes to bake. Next time, I would reduce amount of salt and add more oats. Thanks for the recipe!

To die for! These cookies are so delicious I couldn't stop eating them. I don't ever grease anything. But I do use olive oil non-stick cooking spray and it worked very well. No it didn't taste like olive oil (haha). Very easy and quick to make. I did put the dough in the fridge for about 30 minutes and in between baking. I did not form them into balls. I just used a heaping teaspoons and pressed each cookie with my index finger on the cookie sheet before baking and they came out wonderful! My husband says I can make these anytime! They are so good! MMmm perfect with a glass of milk.

My daughter is a vegan so I had to alter this recipe some, but it's become a household favorite!  I used 1/2 cup coconut milk and 3 tablespoons ground flax (allow to sit a few minutes) as a stand-in for the two eggs. I also added 1.5 tsp baking powder and used oil instead of margarine/butter. I did not grease the cookie sheets.  These cookies are VERY moist, thick, chewy, yummy!

Excellent recipe.  I do not typically like oatmeal cookies,  made this recipe for family,  and even  I couldn't get enough of them.  It makes a very soft thick cookie with great flavor.  You do not need to grease cookie sheets, as I find this gives cookies a weird crispy edge. I also baked them at 350 to cook the cookie enough, yet not overcook the bottoms. Instead of rolling into balls,  I just grabbed a chuck of dough and dipped the tops into sugar,  which gave the cookie a nice glistening top.  The recipe doubled nicely as well.  I added 1/2 c. crasiens(unsweetened) and a 1/2 c. golden raisens, which gave a nice color as well as taste.   I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone that loves a nice soft, chewy, and thick cookie.  This one is a keeper for me.

Delicious and moist, and they leave tons of room for whatever dried fruits or nuts you'd like to add. A big hit with my family.

A great oatmeal cookie recipe! Crispy on the outside - soft on the inside :) I altered the recipe by substituting 1/2 tsp of vanilla for 1/2 tsp of maple flavoring. I also cut the oats down to 2 1/2 cups so they wouldn't be too dry. I added 1 tsp of baking powder in addition to the baking soda because I like a "puffier" cookie. I added 1 cup of chopped dried apples and 1 cup of white chocolate chips. Finally, I baked them at 350 for 14-16 minutes, and took them out a bit early to finish cooking on the warm cookie sheet. A keeper for sure!

We really enjoyed these cookies!!  After reading some reviews saying it wasn't necessary to refridgerate the dough, I decided to cool half the dough and see if there was a difference in the cookie.  I ended up keeping the dough in the fridge overnight and made the cookies the next morning.  The result was a cookie that was a lot fluffier and tastier.  That being said, the dough that wasn't refridgerated was still tasty and looked good, it was just a bit flat and crispier.  The refridgerated dough also needed the full 10 minutes, where as the dough that was not refridgerated only needed about 8.  I also did not flatten the cookies--I didn't see a need.  I also found it easier to get the cookies off the pan after greasing it.

These were delicious! I'm so glad I finally made them! The recipe was very easy to make, and they cooked perfectly at exactly 10 minutes. I drizzled half with white chocolate, and the other with chocolate. They looked very cute, and were soo good! :)

I tried this recipe over the weekend and noticed that when I initially made the batter, I went on and put the dough onto my cookie sheet without chilling.  I had to do drop cookies because the batter was not chilled enough to roll into balls.  Like other reviewers, I did not flatten them out.  This set of cookies spread and made bigger cookies, but they were still soft because I baked them a little less.  I didn't want to make all of the cookies that day so I refrigerated the dough and then made more cookies the next day.  I noticed that when the dough is chilled, the cookie balls tend to stay smaller and they don't spread as much.  As my dough warmed up, my cookies also got bigger and bigger.  I'd actually suggest to take BITTERSWEET1's advice and chill the dough for at least an hour or bake unchilled dough a little less time.

I did not refrigerate the dough before baking and I used a regular cookie scoop to make big cookies, increased baking time to 13 minutes with cooling on baking sheet 5 minutes.Baking 6 at a time per cookie sheet ended up with 15 cookies total. Soft texture but after fully cooling held together well when picked up (about 5 inches in diameter)   These are bakery quality and will be in gift baskets come Christmas.

As I am standing here eating the dough while waiting for the first batch to come out of the oven, all I can say is that they are great and taste just like the one's my Mom made while we were growing up. I lost that recipe (sorry Mom) so this is the one that is going to take it's place. I did add 1 1/2 cups of choc chips

Excellent.  I've made these cookies a few times now, and I have it honed now.  Overall, I make the recipe pretty much to the letter, just with some additions.  Prior to mixing up the batter, I let the eggs sit out until they reach room temperature, and soak raisins (1 cup worth) in warm water, 10-15 minutes.  I always just use one cup of shortening, in place of butter.  I notice no difference.  I also add 1/2 a teaspoon of cardamom, just because I like that spice.  At the end, I add the wet raisins into the batter and maybe 2-3 tablespoons of the water that the raisins soaked in.  (I've never really measured it.)  I find the batter is too dry and will crumble if I don't do that.  Like other reviewers have said, dipping a fork and pressing down the cookies is pointless.  Just roll them into balls and they'll flatten on their own in the oven.  There's no real need to refrigerate the dough for an hour or grease the pan either.  There's enough grease in the cookies.  They shouldn't stick.  I don't always add raisins.  I've added other butterscotch chips and chocolate chips as well.  In those cases, again, don't forget the 2-3 tablespoons of water, or else the batter will be a little dry.  This is my honed recipe after a few tries.  My cookies don't last long, people love them.

These are my absolute favorite oatmeal cookie.  Even my 12 year old DD loves these.  I do add additional flour to ensure the cookies are not flat.  I also do not roll them in sugar, flatten them with a fork or put the dough in the fridge.  They're soft and chewy and eaten faster than I can make them.

This recipe is the best.  The only change that I made was to add 2 cups of quick cook oatmeal and 1 cup of regular cook oatmeal.  The regular cook oatmeal is slightly bigger than the quick cook oatmeal.  I even bought the store brand oatmeal.  The cookies were a big success.  I’m going to make them again for my sister’s bridal shower.    Oatmeal cookies are my husband’s favorite.  And, he can’t get enough of them.

I added a cup of toasted pecans and left out the cinnamon.  I knew they would be good when I could not stay out of the dough!  Mine were really flat, but I will take the blame for that because I did not have the time to chill them first.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

These cookies were incredibly good!  I did make a few changes, I cut both the brown and white sugar down and used 3/4 cup of each.  My son is allergic to eggs, so I replaced the eggs with a total of 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce.  I divided the dough and made several varieties.  A batch with mini Enjoy Life semi sweet Chocolate chips, another with choc. chips and dried cranberries, another with raisins.  Also a set with white chocolate chips and finally white choc chips with cranberries.  A real keeper of a recipe!

The BEST!  I followed the recipe exactly, but didn't leave them cool on the baking sheet because they started to stick.  This is the best oatmeal cookie I've ever baked!   Thank you BITTERSWEET1 for sharing.

This recipe rocks! I did a few little changes though. I used a hot cereal that contained oats and barley and other healthy stuff and used 2 cups of that, and 1 cup quick oats. I also threw in a awesome fruit mix I got at Trader Joes that had pomegranate, raspberries, and black currants. I did also use half white flour and half wheat. Wow, it turned out amazing and I had a bunch of people ask me for the recipe! Yummmm..

These turned out exactly how I imagined that they would - oatmealy and soft.  We added 1/2 cup of shredded coconut to the recipe and it gave it that extra oomph to it that we loved!

This was one of the best cookie recipes my family and I have tried.  The chewy center and crunchy edges were delightful.

These cookies were fantastic! Here's a tip: if you want them to be chewy in a container, DO NOT OVER BAKE THEM. Take them out when they are golden yellow and not brown. Or you can just pop them in the microwave for 10 seconds and they'll seem like they came right out of the oven. Plus, there's not need to dip the fork in the sugar when pressing the dough down. Although these cookies were a bit sweet, so I suggest you reduce the granulated sugar about 1 to 2 tablespoons.

I agree with the reviewer who stated they were not moist; mine weren't either. Also I found them way too sweet. I made the cookies the way the recipe says & added the raisins. If I were to use this recipe again, I would radically cut the amount of sugar. I will say the person I made them for asked for soft cookies & they did come out soft, although he indicated the flavor was nothing special.

pretty good, cooked 10 min. came out perfect, cooked on parchment paper, a little bland so i added coconut and dark chocolate chips to the rest of the batch, much better flavor that way. Next time i will add more spices for flavor, good base recipe though ;0)

DELICIOUS!!! the sugar was just enough in this recipe so I didn't dip the fork in extra sugar. I did add raisins to half the batch and cranberries and white chocolate chips to the other half. Both kinds were wonderful...everyone loved them. I actually flattened them and baked them for a full 10 minutes since my family likes these more crunchy than soft...perfect!!

I'm not sure what exactly I did wrong but these cookies turned out crumbly and a little too sweet for my taste.  It made me really miss the ones my mom used to make.  Also, to top it all off, the next day when I went get one out of the ziploc bag, the whole thing was filled with ants!  It was like some bad cookie omen or something out of a horror movie.  Anyway, these just weren't for me.

These cookies were pretty good they weren't the best that i've ever tasted but lets be honest and all agree that grandma makes the best of everything but if you want them even more moist add some milk in with the oats. about a cup or 2 should be enough

I thought this was a Great Oatmeal Cookie recipe.  They were moist and very easy to make.  I added some butterscotch chips to half the batch and they were awesome.  This recipe is going in the vault for sure!

I made these sunday night - absolutely delicious. they are heavy on the oats though so I am really glad I did half the dough with 1/2 c of raising and the other half with 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips and some raisins. I brought them to the office and everyone raved about them. I still have a few left and am trying ever so hard to not eat them for breakfast. Follow this recipe as is and add some raisins- you will love it. Oh - I kept my cookies in little balls rather than flattening before baking - still soft two days later! Great recipe!

these are very very good. Try adding about half a small bag of chocolate chips.......we almost always do and it comes out just lovely. Update. I added half a box of butterscotch flavored instant pudding. Best. Cookies. Ever.

You do NOT need 1 cup of butter in these cookies! My husband who is not a baker just made these cookies and informed me that he only used 1/2 cup and folled the rest of the recipe as is.  They came out great and chewy with only half the butter!! I would have never known :)  Only thing is they were a little flat but taste great!

I never made cookies in my life, but I love Oatmeal Raisin cookies, actually I like any cookie. But Oatmeal is my favorite, and I followed this recipe to a tee other than the chill for a hour part. Here is a tip for rookies in baking cookies like these, you will know when your cookies are ready when the edge of the cookie is brown. Dont worry that the cookie doesnt look all brown as when it cools it congeals and hardens. Dont touch it.   These cookies are awesome and taste better than any oatmeal cookie I have eaten from grocery stores. BTW add raisins, I put a cup but I think a Cup and a Half would have been better. I like raisins!!, but a Cup of raisins will be enough. GREAT RECIPE!!!

I made these exactly as described, and they were fantastic!  They baked into the perfect cookies - not flat, perfectly chewy, not cakey.  Next time I am going to try 1 C whole oats and 2 C quick cooking oats, to see if I like them even better with more texture.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Great cookie! The only thing I did different was reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup each & using parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheet. I put them on the cookie sheet in balls and they flattened out slightly to produce a nice hardy cookie, not flat! Yummm! Oh and I did add rasins.

I pretty much followed the recipe and they were the best oatmeal cookies I've ever made.  They looked underbaked when I took them out at around 10 mins, but set enough on the pan and were perfectly chewy (and still are next day).  I used half whole wheat flour and added about 2 Tbsp flax seed, and did add raisins.  All around terrific, soft, chewy oatmeal cookies.  Will be my standard recipe for oatmeal raisin cookies.

Humph. I don't know what went wrong with these. They COMPLETELY flattened and are not soft at all. I reduced the temp to 350 and it still happened. My baking soda is not expired, but maybe it went bad somehow? It's obviously something I did wrong, because everyone else's sound and look great. I think I'll try these again when I buy new baking soda.

I made these reduced fat/cal (used smart balance for baking and splenda blend) and they were super moist and delish!  I can only imagine how awesome they'd be with all the full fat/cal ingredients.  I also subbed 1/2 a cup of whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour and used regular oats.  Don't hesitate to make these!

I didnt squish them with a fork in sugar like suggested, i just rolled them in little ball (the size of large walnuts). the temp was a bit high, so i had to reduce it to 350. they were a perfect blend of spices that made them delicious!

I would actually give this a 4 star rating, but everyone else who ate them absolutely loved them so I've bumped it up to 5. I followed the recipe exactly besides adding in butterscotch chips. I did chill the dough and they came out nice. The first pan I pressed the rolled balls like the recipe said, but thought they came out too flat. The rest of the dough I just balled and did NOT press and they were perfect. Plus, mine took 11-12 minutes and were still very soft. Maybe my oven is a little off in temperature?

Thanks for this one. This is my husband's absolute favorite cookie. I make them at least twice a week to have with our evening tea, I add lots of raisins and pecans, for an extra healthy snack. The dough can be difficult to stir, so I usually add a few drops of milk.

Holy cow! These are amazing. I followed the recipe, except I doubled the vanilla extract and didn't flatten the cookies with a fork. Not needed. The recipe also easily changes yield. I only had 1/4 cups of butter, so I made 6 servings (which were really 8 large cookies). They came out perfectly round. 10 minutes at 375 makes them come out golden brown. I chopped dried cherries and put white chocolate chips in mine.

YUM, I will make this recipe again and again.  The chewy cookies baked up perfectly with nice crispy edges.  The cinnamon gives them a mellow flavor that's super tasty but not overpowering.  I didn't change a thing about the ingredients but I did make the first batch without refrigerating the dough and they came out fine.  I'm going to make the rest tomorrow to see if there's a noticeable difference but either way, these were delicious!

This really was a SOFT oatmeal cookie!!  Very good but ofcourse with every great recipe something can be tweaked.  Brown sugar, more cinnamon, lemon extract, etc.  Just a bit of experimenting can take this cookie from great to outstanding!!

Excellent recipe! Followed the recipe, plus using the advice on increasing the oatmeal. I used 2-1/2 cups. Also added 1 cup raisins, 1 cup chopped walnuts, and 1 cup of shredded, sweetened coconut. Fabulous! Cool, they are crisp with a chewy center. They soften up beautifully in the microwave, if you want to relive that 'just out of the oven cookie' again! Thank you!

These are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever had.  The only thing I changed was the oats.  I didn't have quick cooking oats, so I used the old fashioned.  I also added chocolate chips and pecans.  This is the only oatmeal cookie recipe I will use.

DELICIOUS!!! Since my boyfriend and I are choco-holics I threw in a few mini-chocolate chips. This made the cookie the best ever! In fact, I had to bring them to work cause my co-workers were wondering where I got such a great cookie. Hands down, the best! They key to getting a nice soft cookie, is simply to not over bake it.  I did not find any problems with this recipe and the cookies were soft and chewy. Yum Yum!

Due to a snow storm, I only had half a cup butter, so I substituted shortening for the other half. I don't know if that's why it seemed to be a bit bland, but I added nutmeg and cloves, and it still needed a bit more. I split the batch in half and added dried cranberries to half. The cranberries made it super yummy! I took them out at eight minutes, when they didn't look quite done, but once cooled they were perfect. I know it's not fair to judge a recipe when I didn't have the proper ingredients. Will update once I make it again, properly.

Turned out well - I made mine with raisins. I would suggest flattening the dough significantly if you like flat cookies. I baked for the full 10 minutes. Cookies were dense and moist.

Followed this recipe exactly, adding only 1 cup dried cranberries, 1 cup white chips and 1/2 TBS fresh orange zest.  Baking for the shortest time produces a soft cookie, the longer you bake, the more crisp and dry it becomes, so you are in control of how they turn out in that respect.  Hubby says, THIS is also a keeper as well as The Best Oatmeal Cookie recipe. I love recipes that allow me to add my own extra flavorings but produce a great result on their own.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  Both get 5 stars, too hard to choose!

Great basic recipe and easily adapted by using Splenda, adding nuts, etc. to slightly alter flavor and/or make a more healthy cookie.  Perfect consistency and bakes well, crispy on edges and soft in the center.

These turned out delicious!!!I just finished baking them and couldn't wait to post a comment!Super easy to make, chewy and soft. I have never made oatmeal cookies but boy did these turn out great :) I made some small changes to the recipe: reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup, reduced flour to 1 1/2 cup, and instead of using  quick cooking oats, it actually worked perfect with old fashioned oats. I will be making them again tomorrow for a birthday party:) Thanks for the recipe,and ENJOY to whoever decides to try!!!

I had my doubts about this recipe, but made exactly as printed. To my surprise the cookies came out light and moist. Not to mention delicious. NOTE: I left in fridge overnight and used old fashioned rolled oats not the quick oats. Cooked 9 minutes at 375. Made 3 dozen. Thanks Bittersweet1

I followed the recipe (adding in 1 cup of raisins) but did not chill ingredients, nor did I flatten with fork dipped in sugar.  When everything was mixed, I rolled them into a ball and baked immediately.  Very good!  Since we like our cookies a little fluffier, I made another batch a few hours later adding an additional 1/4 cup of flour and they were perfect. These freeze very well.  This is a keeper!

excellent cookies!  soft and chewy.  i had a request for oatmeal ccokies at work and chose this recipe.  very easy and yummy!  i normally add raisins.  my only complaint is that the dough is very stiff, but obviously that can't be helped.  i actually broke my cookie scoop making these one time!  LOL.  but they were worth it.  thanks so much for the recipe.  i make them often!

I'm not that good at baking and every time I attempt to make oatmeal cookies they turn out underbaked/cooked.   This recipe was easy to follow. They turned out great for me, but i tweaked the recipe a bit  Instead of 1 cup each of brown and white sugar, I used 3/4 cup of each and added chocolate chips.  I'm making them as a present for my boyfriend who will spend a lot for oatmeal cookies. I really hope he likes this. My mum took 2 already.   Thanks for the recipe

The only thing I changed was that I didn't roll the cookies in sugar or use a fork dipped in sugar. Kept everything else the same, baked them all for 8 minutes because I LOVE soft, chewy cookies!

BEWARE! These cookies are delicious! The only problem is that you're likely to not even come close to the recommended serving size of two dozen -- the cookie dough will get you, and get you good. After your upset stomach goes away from all the delicious dough, the cookies are great. Finally, only cook them for 7 1/2 minutes.

I loved these! And I loved JENIP's idea of breaking the batter up into 3 parts and adding different nuts/dried fruit to each part. Next batch I'm going to ice with a glaze made from orange juice, orange zest and powdered sugar! Yum!

Outstanding recipe, and so easy to make! I added 1/4 tsp. of ground cloves to the original, and it gave it a great, but subtle, kick. Even without it, this recipe is fantastic!

Delicious! Yumo! These were definitely soft and chewy. I used 1 Cup of raisins and this was the perfect amount. I tried a batch rolled into balls and not pressed. They were a bit softer, but even the ones that I pressed with a fork were still soft and chewy, so either works :) Enjoy!!

These are totally delicious! I add a half cup each of craisins and chopped walnuts when baking these for adults and plain when baking for children. I usually make a half batch because this recipe is so generous.

I got rave reviews when I added 1 Cup of pecans and 1 Cup of cranberries to this recipe.  I also found the refrigeration unnecessary but did find I had to flatten the cookies once they were on the baking sheet, otherwise I had to bake them longer.

First of all, let me say thank you for sharing!! I loved these cookies.  Soft and chewy just like they should be.  Only thing I changed was making it 1/2tsp. cinnamon and 1/4tsp. of all-spice simply because I'm not a huge cinnamon fan.  Absolutely delicious

OMG these are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever had, and probably one of the best cookies i have had, oatmeal and other. I had to cook a few different batches since my cookie sheet was small, and I think they came out better shaped when I did not use the fork to press them down - unless I pressed down too much. I also did not use the sugar on the fork, and they still were excellent. Best oatmeal cookie hands down!!

I have tried 5-6 new oatmeal raisin recipes over the past few years, and I'm finally done searching -- these turned out great!  I included 1-1/2 c. raisins, 1 c. chopped walnuts and 1/4 teaspoon allspice (on top of 1 heaping teaspoon cinnamon).

Well  I choose this recipe because of all the great reviews and boy am I glad I did!! These are wonderful!! I added raisins and craisins!! I doubled the recipe because I am making them for gifts to give at Christmas. I added 1 tsp of cloves because to me its not Christmas without the smell and taste of cloves!!And I cant imagine eating an oatmeal cookie without raisins!! Thank you so much for this recipe!! It will go in my recipe book and will be one I hand down to my daughter (who absolutely LOVES them!!)

I made these as part of our cookie assortment for Christmas.  I don't normally like oatmeal cookies but I hesitantly took a piece that my husband offered me as they were cooling.  All I can say is WOW!  These cookies are delicious and now unfortunately for everyone else, these oatmeal cookies are MINE and won't see the cookie tray!  We did leave out the raisins since neither of us are fans and the recipe certainly didn't miss them!

very good...cut the cinnamon back to 1 tsp, and I added a cup of craisins and about 1/4 cup of currents, then to the last half added an additional 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. very good either way. I didn't chill them for an hour, I just mixed them up and dropped them onto the cookie sheet, didn't press them flat. will definatly make them again they are very versitle and would be good with any combination of add-ins.

I HATE this recipe! Haha. I have eaten probably 25 of these cookies in the last 4 days. And I'm TRYING to lose all my pregnancy weight from the baby I had 5 weeks ago. At this rate I will weigh more than I did at 40 weeks pregnant! These are the BEST! I cut the salt in half and only used 2 1/2 cups of oats because I added chocolate chips and walnuts. WARNING: THESE ARE ADDICTING! This is a keeper. ***UPDATE*** 2 years later I am still making these cookies!!! I have completely perfected them and get SOOO many compliments every time I take them somewhere. I've been making a batch a day for the past few weeks and I CANNOT get people to leave them alone until the 2nd day! LOOOOOVVVEEE these cookies!

These is a great recipe for deliciously chewy cookies. The first time I made them I followed the instructions but the second time around I made my own modifications because I wanted them to be chunkier and more flavorful. I added one cup of raisins and one cup of walnuts plus a 1/2 teaspoon of allspice. I did no hill the dough and I did not flatten it with  fork dipped in sugar. The raisins makes them sweet enough. The result was a sinful cookie bursting with flavor and with sweet raisins and crunchy walnuts in every single bite. YUM!

The cookies were very good. The bigger you make them the better. I'm a moist cookie kinda gal so these were pretty good. After they cool them seem crunchy but the inside is just right :) Also the cookies are great with either rasins or chocolate chips. I also used splenda insted of regular sugar and they still tasted just as fabulous. flattening the cookies with a fork diped in sugar is critical! dont forget it :)

WARNING:  You will not be able to resist these cookies!  I ate 3 right out of the oven and had my husband hide the rest.  I added raisins (that I had soaked in hot water) to these and it really complimented the cookies.  My family ate these in one day.  This will be my permanent Oatmeal Raisin Cookie from now on!

I have never made oatmeal cookies before and these were easy. I have made them two different ways. X-large scoops of dough (baked 12 min.) come out super soft. I have refrigerated the dough overnight and made small golf ball sized scoops. The cookies hold the smaller shape and are crispier on the outside.

These cookies were great! I was a little skeptical because the batter was slightly drier than I thought it would be, and of course I added a lot of raisins and they turned out perfect. Definitely a keeper!!

This recipe is great, I've made them twice in a week. I did make some changes to make them slightly healthier; I cut the white sugar by 50% and the brown sugar I cut by 25% and used spelt flour rather than white flour. I also added dried cherries and chopped walnuts. I thought they were plenty sweet without as much sugar and the spelt flour added some fiber while still keeping a great soft cookie consistency. My husband and I loved them and I took some to work and 2 women asked me for the recipe.

great oatmeal cookies. I did cook them for 12 minutes as I bake on stoneware. I took the recommendation of adding a little allspice and not refrigerating for 1 hour.

1/2 portion.  1/2 cup brown sugar, and 1/2 equiv of splenda, 1/2 cup all purp flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. Added about 1/2 cup walnuts, 1/2 cup plus of dark choc chips. Excellent!

This recipe was wonderful. Each cookie turned out so soft and moist.Because I'm always trying to make recipes a little healthier i did change a couple of things . Instead of 1 cup butter i used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup apple sauce, and added 1/4 cup ground wheat germ and 1 cup large organic raisins. My family loved these, especially my 2 1/2 year old who loves cookies.

The very BEST oatmeal cookies I've tasted! Thank you for this recipe! The only changes I made were: 1) I replaced the butter with margarine and 2) only added 2 cups of oats. Sooo chewy! A healthy snack for the sweet-tooth mom and kids.

Other than adding walnuts to the recipe no other alterations were made. The first day they were quite yummy but dried out the next. Kept 'em sealed tight in a container-didn't seem to help. Will probably only make a few at a time as they dry out pretty fast. Weren't very "soft" to begin with, more so chewy than anything else.

This recipe makes a great oatmeal cookie! However, I found if you hold the dough overnight in the fridge, the cookies don't bake up as well; They are not as soft as they should be and that's what this recipe is all about!

I had high expectations with this recipe, based on all the positive feedback from past reviewers.  The cookies baked well & tasted great the night I made them.  I hoped the flavor & texture of the cookies would last longer than they did.  After a day or so, the cookies ended up tasting dried out (although sealed in an airtight container) & unfortunately lost some of their appeal.

By far the best oatmeal cookie I have ever tasted! Even my chocolate chip cookie loving boyfriend loves them. He rated it a 10 and told me not to change a thing. Oh, I forgot to mention, he's the pickest eater ever. What a great recipe. Thanks!!

Yum! My husband loves these almost as much as my chocolate chip cookies, which is a huge deal! I did use regular oats (not quick) since that's all we had, but I actually like them slightly chewy. Even though the recipe says it yields two dozen, I got almost 6 dozen large cookies out of it! That should last us a while - or maybe not!

O.K., These turned out amazingly good even though I'm an idiot and think that little elves must stock my cupboards with sugar, flour ect.  First off: 3/4 cup sugar (ran out) and 1 1/4 cup brn sugar. Completly out of cinn. so I had to use like 1/2 teas cloves. Everything else I actually DID have and even with these mistakes they still turned out awsome! Net time I'll have the stuff to actually make them RIGHT and I bet there even better.

These cookies were really good! I did add a bit more cinnamon to the batter and only used half of the sugar. The cookies are still sweet enough though... am even thinking to reduce the sugar a bit more next time. I baked them until the edges of the cookies were crispy and the inside was still soft. Nearly all gone now!

Yummy and easy. My husband and daughter loved these. After mixing the batch, I separated equals into 2 bowls. My husband likes raisins, so I added raisins to one/half of the batch. He also likes his oatmeal cookies hard (not soft), so I baked his batch an extra 5 minutes. This recipe make a lot of cookies, so you can play up the divided batch on each cookie sheet that goes in the oven. On some batches I didnt press down the top of the rounded dough with a fork, so they come out extra soft (the way my daughter likes 'em). Also, next time I will add applesauce in the mix to replace some of the butter, just for a healthier recipe. Hope they turn out...as yummy as the first batch.

Excellent soft oatmeal cookie.  I followed the directions exactly the first time I made them and they were great, but this time a decided to add a few extras.  I included about 1/2-3/4 cup shredded coconut, almond slivers and Californian golden raisins. Great recipe just as but also versatile enough to incorporate different things in. Thanks!

I came home from work to find my husband and 3 year old son making these cookies so he can do them anyone can!  They turned out great and I think what made them really good was the cinnamon.  He did some white chocolate chips that needed to be used up which added to the great flavor.  We will have to make them again.

Very Tastey cookie but a little flat. Almost like a lace cookie. I used butter and it seems when I do it makes my cookies flat so next time I will try margarine.

***** Excellent!  Yummy!  If you like oatmeal cookies soft and chewy without being spicy then this is the recipe you want.  You can't eat just one.

Maybe I did something wrong, but these cookies turned out very flat for me. I rarely have ever had this problem baking cookies. Also, I like sweet cookies, but these were definitely too sweet for me. If I were to try these again, I'd definitely decrease the sugar. For now, I'm sticking with the recipe on the oatmeal box as I've never messed those up!

These are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever tasted.  They stayed so soft and chewy even after a few days.  My family loved them, including my daughter who doesn't even care for oatmeal.  I didn't have cloves so just omitted that ingredient.  I also forgot to add the vanilla to the first batch and they were still delicious.  I did add vanilla to the second batch and they were magnificent.  This recipe will be one of my regulars.

Great recipe!!!  The only addition I made was to add 1 cup of chocolate chips, but it would have been just as good without them!  This would be an excellent recipe around the holiday times b/c of the hint of cinammon in the background :).  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I added a cup of raisins to these even though I normally don't like them very much, but these were great! The bit of cinnamon really complements the raisins, and these didn't get hard or fall apart like so many oatmeal cookies I've tried. I bet lots of other mix-ins would also be good with this recipe, and I'm sure they're still really good without anything added at all!

There is a reason this recipe has a 5 star rating.  I have tried countless oatmeal cookie recipes always to be disappointed.  I made a batch of these today and can say that I have finally found the PERFECT oatmeal cookie.  I too added some chocolate chips but that was it.  Bake time on these were exactly 10 minutes to perfection.  I think next time I may add a little peanut butter.  Thank you, thank you for a great recipe.

My 10 year old niece and I tried out these cookies......she's not a HUGE fan of Oatmeal Cookies but she liked these. We followed recipe exactly - (except for adding chocolate chips) I thought they were the BEST Oatmeal Cookies I've ever made! Recipe was easy, although we would recommend a BIG mixing bowl - it was hard to mix once the oats were added - just make sure you have a sturdy wooden spoon!

Makes an excellent oatmeal raisin cookie!  I think that my search is over - I'll happily make these again and again.  Note: I remove my cookies from the oven the second that they look just baked enough, and even I had to bake these much longer than the 8-10 minutes stated.

Speed is necessary when I cook/bake so I didn't chill for an hour, I used a cookie scoop, and flattened them down a smidge with my fingers.  I added a cup of dried cranberries instead of raisins.  Despite all my shortcuts, they came out delicious!  Using the scoop, I got more than 4 dozen medium size cookies.

Terrible. I followed the directions exactly; they were runny and approached second-degree-burn status at only 7.5 minutes. Maybe I should not have refrigerated the dough? The raw dough is delish, but I had to throw out the cookies. I had made only one batch, saving the rest of the batter for another time. I will try to salvage that by adding oats, a bit of flour and soda, and NOT refrigerate before baking. My oven is calibrated, so it's not that. Sad waste of ingredients and my time. Next time, back to the oatmeal box recipe.

I substituted apple pie spice for the regular cinnamon because I like a little more spice to my oatmeal cookies, and I put in about a cup of raisins ( I don't know the exact amt, my 9-yo and I just kept adding handfuls of raisins until it looked right.) Then we put a pan of cookies in the oven and took spoonfuls of raw dough to sit down and eat. MMMMM!!! GOOD!!!

These are great cookies.  I halved the recipe, and it still made *almost* 2 dozen LARGE cookies.  Also, I added just a bit less cinnamon.  The cookies came out soooo soft and chewy.

These came out perfect and everyone loved them.  I soaked the raisins first.  No need to put the dough in the fridge first.  Toffee bits are also good instead of raisins if people don't like them.  I'll never use another oatmeal cookie recipe.

Nice cookie.  Total comfort food.
I used regular oats (ie not quick cooking).  I wanted to try to make them a smidge healthier (I also added chocolate chips, pecans and raisin) so tried grating 1.5 carrots into the mix.  Next time I'll even try more carrot since it was not at all noticable.

These cookies were fantastic. I used salted butter, so I decreased the salt to 1/2 t. and added about 3/4 c. each craisins and white chocolate chips. 
I didn't chill the dough, just formed into balls on greased cookie sheet and baked for 7 minutes, then let cool on cookie sheet for another 5. The cookies were very moist and delicious, a hit with my toddler.

These were great!  We prefer our cookies soft and chewy.  I tossed in some raisins and some toffee chips I had lying around.  I appreciated the tips about leaving them on the pan and squashing them with a fork.

These cookies were just what I was looking for!  I wanted an oatmeal cookie recipe that was good enough to stand on its own without raisins or chocolate chips, but also tasted good when add-ins were included.  I scooped mine using a small ice cream scoop onto parchment paper lined cookie sheets, and didn't bother pressing them down before baking.    My cookies were done in exactly 7 minutes. I added mini chocolate chips to the last half of the batch, and must admit, they're my favorite of the two types.  Great texture and flavor.

Good cookie.  I add about 1 cup of dried cranberries.  The next time I make these I probably decrease the flour to 1.75 cups of flour.  If the cookies are flattened, the cooking time only needs to be about 7 minutes.  Update:  I now add 1/2 tsp of cloves (halved recipe) which it gives the cookie more flavor.  I also use 1 full cup of raisins (halved recipe).  I also use a regular ice cream scoop to make large cookies.  I flatten the cookie and bake for 12-13 minutes.

The reason this cookie recipe has such high ratings is simple: it makes a GREAT COOKIE. I baked two batches of these to take to a potluck. I added craisins & nuts to one batch; butterscotch chips to the other. Both batches turned out wonderfully soft with just the right amount of crunch. As always...use room temperature ingredients and watch them closely in the oven. Overbaking will create a disappointing result. Thanks for passing along this wonderful cookie recipe.

These are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever had.  My daughter made the first time and accidently only put one cube of butter in the cookie.  We loved the recipe and I made it again and really didn't notice the difference between one cube or two cubes.  The first batch was a little salty, so if you want to cut down on the fat, just use one cube of butter and cut down a little on the salt and it tastes just as good!

Great cookie!  Delicious flavor and perfect amount of sweetness.  Texture is great too - soft and chewy with a little crunchiness from the oats.  I was able to make a low fat version by substituting applesauce for the butter, but doing that does require to add an extra 1/2 - 1 cup of oats.  I also mixed in a combination of raisins, chopped pecans, and dried wolfberries, and that was delicious.  These cookies only spread slightly, so make them the size and flatness you want.

Very delicious cookies. Stayed very soft. I added bananas to mine and used a healthier spread instead of butter.

These oatmeal cookies are delicious. The ratio of flour to oatmeal is nice - you can definitely taste the oatmeal, but not so much that it overwhelms the cookie. They turn out twice as many cookies as the recipe states, if you drop by tablespoons. When I make these I reduce the total amount of sugar by 1/2 cup so I can add mix-ins without making the cookies overly sweet. I've added white chocolate chips and cranberries, chocolate chips and butterscotch chips, and raisins. Sometimes I sprinkle in a bit of coconut as well. I would suggest leaving out the cinnamon if you make these with chocolate chips.

Thanks for the recipe!

This is my favorite oatmeal cookie recipe--as others have said, a great basic that bakers can alter to take in fun, delicious directions. I'm partial to adding chocolate chips, and a friend's cookies have inspired me to add melted chocolate to make "soft chocolate oatmeal cookies." Even if you don't change a thing, these cookies will be a great treat.

These are really really good. They are good if you add raisins, they are good if you add chocolate chips, cinnamon chips, butterscotch chips, or just a glass of milk! Thank you for a recipe that would deserve 7 stars!

It was my first time making this and it really is a simple recipe. I think it's also a forgiving recipe, so don't be afraid to try it.

I found that it helped chilling the dough, even for just 15 minutes in the refrigerator/freezer so that the dough didn't melt so quickly when rolling them into balls. 

I added chocolate chip to one batch, craisins and choc chips to another, and kept one original flavour. They were far and away the tastiest cookies in our office bake off.

These are perfect as is, but if you want to make them slightly healthier: Substituting half whole wheat flour and adding 1/4 c flax seed didn't seem to make them any less delicious.  Added craisins to half the batch and chocolate chips to the other half.  YUM!  Didn't look done, only the edges were brown, but took them out and they were just right (soft with crispy edges).  About 9 minutes using a convection oven at 350.  Had a lot of trouble creaming the sugars and butter by hand, but found that once I added the egg, it was much easier to mix.  I was mixing by hand.  To mix the dry ingredients with the wet, I had to use my hands, and that did the trick to get a more thorough mixing.  I personally liked the saltiness of the cookie and would not add less salt.  The saltiness balanced the sweetness.  I did not bother chilling the dough since it was fine to work with but just a little sticky (although I used 2 extra large eggs--maybe this was the reason why it was not crumbly).

This cookie was so soft for an oatmeal cookie, it really surprised me! It just crumbles in your mouth. I followed the recipe, but used instant oats instead of quick cooking.
I didn't chill the dough, just let it sit for 15 mins and it'll be easy to handle.
I didn't grease my cookie sheets either, and the cookies slid off easily still.
ADDING RAISINS IS A MUST! The sweetness and juiciness of raisins complement this cookie perfectly!

in my recipe i substituted the white suger with splenda. and only used less than half because splenda is much more sweet. and i used whole wheat flour instead of white all purpose. and i used about half as much brown sugar. but they still turned out great! i only made these healthier because my dad is a diabetic so next time i make these i'm definitely going to go by the actual recipe!

These cookies were great!! I didn't change the salt amount but I will next time. Maybe 3/4 of a teaspoon.  I really preffered baking them on wax paper better than aluminum foil lined cookie sheets.  These have definately become one of my husbands favorites!!

This recipe was awesome.  I didn't bother chilling the dough, and they still turned out great.  If you have a stoneware baking sheet, use it, it works great for these cookies!  My only recommendation is, if you are going to add chocolate chips, leave out the cinnamon.

This is by far the best recipe for oatmeal cookies that I have EVER tasted!! It is very close(top 3)to the best cookie recipe I have ever made (&tasted)!! And that includes every recipe with raisins or chocolate chips!  this recipe is so great on it's own that i'm truly suprised! Seriously you don't need choc.chips or raisins! I did not change anything about this recipe but for a small smidge of nutmeg; but only because I believe that every recipe that includes cinnamon should have a smidge of nutmeg.  Thank you soooo much for this wonderful recipe!

These are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever tasted! I have made these a few times now and they always turn out great. This time I added a cup of raisins. So good!

Wow, this was GOOD. I didn't use vanilla or cinnamon (didn't have) but they are still great. Might add chocolate chips next time =)

These are very good cookies, but even better with butterscotch chips.  That is the only change I made.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was a big hit with my kids, neighbors, and me.  I feel good about sending one of these in my son's lunch instead of processed cookies from the store.  I leave out the cinnamon, as I'm not fond of raisins, substitute dried cherries, and add nuts (any) and chocolate chunks.  Yummy, and more nutritious than plain chocolate chip cookies.  Not sure how long they stay chewy, because they don't stay around long.

WOW ! i'm 36 and this is the 1st time ever i've made oatmeal cookies, duh ! And this might be the 1st and last recipe i'll use. They are GREAT, soft and chewy and a little crispy on the outside edges, I took the advice of other reviewers and used 2 and a bit cups of oats, and they were regular oats, i don't know if this made a difference, i'll probably try it with quick oats to find out. Mine were in the fridge chilling for hours, cus i fell asleep, so i let them soften up a bit and i also did flatten with a LARGE serving fork dipped in sugar. I'm pretty sure they wouldn't have spread on their own. You have to make these, they are great with a cold glass of milk !

My family wants soft cookies so I tried this recipe.  The taste overall is pretty good and I added butterscotch chips to the dough as well.  However maybe I should have removed them from the oven sooner or maybe its my oven I dont know but they werent soft.  They were right out of the oven but as soon as they cooled down they werent soft anymroe.  They do make a great crisp cookie but they didnt stay soft which was dissapointing.

Very good oatmeal cookie recipe. Baked them for 8 min and they turned out perfect. They were almost too sweet, though. I think reducing the sugar would be a good idea next time I make them. I will be using this recipe again for sure.

There's nothing better in the world than a soft oatmeal cookie - and these definitely take the cake!  Talk about EASY to make and even EASIER to eat!  Everyone was in awe of how soft these were - and how they stayed soft for days!  Love this recipe - will use many more times!  I cooked them a little longer than the recipe called for to ensure they stayed together.

Not being an oatmeal cookie fan, I called in a couple of experts for their opinions--my DH and best friend.  They both thought they were delicious, some of the best they've ever had.  My kids loved them too.  I thought they were pretty good.  Add some chocolate chips and now you're talking!  LOL  I made the first batch with raisins soaked in water for about 20 minutes.  I added  1/2 tsp. of cloves, used very soft salted butter, and for the first pan, chilled about 30 minutes.  They spread *way* too thin.  Had to pick them up carefully or they'd fall apart.  So I chilled for the full hour, didn't flatten the cookies, and the next tray was a little better, but still too flat.  So the next day I omitted the raisins and switched to sweet butter (salted butter has a higher moisture content), and chilled the dough for several hours.  I didn't flatten them before baking.  They were still a little flatter than I'd like, but good nonetheless.  All cookies were baked for 9 minutes.  I give this recipe 5 stars because it's easy, the measurements are nice round numbers, and all the oatmeal cookie fans thought they were the best!  Thanks for a great recipe.

i saw this & thought it would be the perfect thing to satisfy my son's craving for oatmeal cookies. i stuck to the basic recipe but used half light & half dark brown sugars then half old fashioned oats & half quick oats for appearance & to boost the fiber content. i also stirred in 1 cup of golden raisins & a handful of finely chopped walnuts. lastly i rolled the dough to the size of a ping pong ball & got twice as many cookies (bake for 8 minutes). we love the crispy edges & chewy inside! many thanks barbara!

It was hard to pick from all the other recipes out there, but I thought given its reviews I'd give this a try.  Although tasty, it was missing a zing, and not gobbled up by my family as Mrs. Fields or other oatmeal cookies I've bought.  So I'll still be on the lookout for a soft - but not doughy- oatmeal cookie!

These had really good flavor - mine were a little on the dry side though, perhaps I baked them too long or it was because I used one of those 5-grain-flax-super-hippie oatmeals.  I'd make'em again though to try and perfect them.  Happy baking!

This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe I have ever found.  It is so versatile.  If you want them crispy just bake them longer, as I did by accident.  I prefer them soft and chewy.  I overbaked them and they came out golden brown and still somewhat soft in the middle.  Not at all ruined, just crispier.  I used toasted pecans, golden raisins and coconut.  Next time I will use a little spice.
With this recipe as a base you can have them anyway you want.

These cookies do not taste like oatmeal cookies.  The taste is okay but I was expecting it to be alot better.  I followed the recipe exactly and I am a little disappointed about the taste of this cookie.  Won't be making this one again.

Loved these cookies. I cut back on the sugar a little bit, and added soaked raisins and choc chips. Cookies did not spread at all, and were soft as named. Thank you for posting.

Simply wonderful. So moist and chewy. However, I do not cool the dough and roll. I just drop by tablespoons right away and bake. I take them out as soon as they are lightly browned.

I added the touch of iced cookies by mixing 1/2 c. confectioners sugar and a tablesppon of milk, mixed well.  After the cookies baked and cooled most of the way I drizzled on the icing.  Very professional looking cookie.  They were super simple to make and I was already asked to make them again - they were only half gone!

Love them! Added only 1/2 cup white sugar instead of the full cup. I scooped them out in round tablespoons and then lightly pressed each one down to get a nice even baked cookie. Average cook time for me was 9 minutes. They were very soft!

Really good cookies! Definate keeper--Did go with the 1 1/4 c. brown sugar, 3/4 c. white sugar-for a softer cookie. Added mini chocolate chips one time for my son and made them with plumped raisins and nuts for my husband--many many request for this recipe. great!

This is AWESOME. I did the 1 and 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 3/4 cup of white sugar thing and used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon. I put in almost a full bag of Heath bar bits, but I dont think it needed it. I may do chocolate chips next time. It tastes like the crumble on top of apple crisp, which as we all know is totally rad. I baked almost all of it, but saved the rest of the dough to eat raw because MAN this tastes good. That's all that needs to be said!

These are REALLY good cookies. I did follow some advice from the others such as DO NOT over bake...(8 min. was fine for me )add more brown sugar then white and 2 tsp. of vanilla. I also used chocolate chips (2 cups). I will use this again for sure.

I liked this recipe as is, though I thought I would share another way to vary it -- Apple Cinnamon Oatmeal Cookies.  Using this recipe, I added 1 to 1 1/2 cups of peeled, shredded apple with the oats.  The juice from the apple will water the dough a good bit, so there are two options.  1) squeeze a little of the juice from the apple prior to adding to dough or 2) add enough flour (approx 1/2 cup) until the consistency returns to normal.  I prefer to chill longer than an hour, maybe over night, to allow the apple to incorporate but it's not absolutely necessary to extend the chilling time.  Hope you enjoy!

Excellent recipe!!! I always use more brown sugar than white in cookies (keeps them more moist), so I modified the sugars to 1 1/4 brown, 3/4 white.  I did a batch with cinnamon chips and a batch with Craisins and pecans.  A co-worker who is the same age as my mom said that they were the best oatmeal cookies she ever had.  WOW!!!

These are so good!! I have never had any luck with oatmeal cookies. They are always too dry or too dense, but not these. They were nice and soft and tasted very good. My whole family really liked them.

These were great. Hubby loves them and they are easy and healthy for a little one to eat! I only added 1 cup of coconut to the exact recipe. I think next time I will only add 1 Tsp. of cinnamon though. Thanxs for sharing!

This recipe yielded beautiful plump, soft, chewy cookies!  It's our new favorite oatmeal cookie recipe.  The only changes I made were to substitute "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" for regular butter, I used 1 cup of regular flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour, and I use 1/3 cup less white sugar.
They were wonderful!  We will definitely have these again!

This is absolutely the BEST oatmeal cookie recipe.  I omitted the cinnamon as I'm not a big fan of it and I didn't refridgerate the dough just spooned it out onto the tray. I could have eated the entire batch myself but the kids and husband kept taking them...

I just made these for my husband who loves oatmeal cookies.  He can't stop eating, they are so good. I added a cup of raisins and soaked them in egg and vanilla (like someone recommended in one of the reviews) and they came out great.  Soft and chewy, awesome!

The cookie dough was very crumbly, so the cookies were more crispy than soft.  Also, I found that smooshing them with a fork before baking just made them crack, so I ended up smooshing when they were in the oven.  Despite all of this, these cookies were VERY good!  Will make again

I would give this recipe 6 stars if i could! It was absolutely perfect.  I added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, 1/2 cup rasins and left out the cinnamon.  For the flour i did 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 regular flour.  This is my new oatmeal cookie recipe! Thanks so much!

Wow, these are some yummy cookies.  I brought them to work and everyone thought they were delicious.  I read some of the reveiws before baking and I have to say I disagree that these cookies are bland, they are very flavorfull.  Also, I didn't think they were ugly or looked under cooked at all.  I also used old fashion oats because I didn't have the instant and added some raisins and butterscotch chips (just a few) all in all these are the best oatmeal cookies I've every made.

The look of the cookies is ok, need some frosting, becasue they are not as brown as the store one, maybe my 10 mins is not enough.
It does not taste very sweet. A plus, becasue my guest all on diet after Chrsitmas. They prefer not over sweet. The cookies taste like the package you bought from the store., just more soft and less sweet. However, they are  not as good as what I had before ,really soft after hours.  
Definitely will try again to get the softness and add some more sweetness for myself. 
The ingredient made a lot, maybe I am making them small ball (like a small walnut size), I had 42 pieces.

I tried this recipe yesterday and all I can say is YUMMY! The cookies turned out soft and round. The only things I changed was using 1 cup of light margarine than 1 cup of butter to try and cut out some of the fat. I also used 1/2 teaspoon of salt. The only advice I can give is to make sure you watch the clock so that the cookies won’t over bake! Definitely a recipe I will keep.

These are so yummy! I am not a big oatmeal cookie fan, however, I really liked these. I added a cup of cooking raisins. This is the second time I have made these and everyone loves them!

Well, I hope I'm not doing this cookie an injustice, but I won't know until I try a lot more oatmeal cookie recipes :)  This one is great.  My fiance loves them and I just finished making a second batch (just made the first only a few days ago.  I did increase the oats just a little and the cinnamon.

I am just about finished baking these cookies for the first time.  I made half the recipe as written (no variations), and didn't bother chilling the dough.  I got 36 small cookies out of it, and must say, they are truly delicious.  Nice and moist, chewy, and flavourful!  I'll be making these again.  And for those who are on Weight Watchers, those 36 cookies are only 1.5 points each!!

I froze half the cookie dough for later use, but when I baked the one batch of dough for 8 minutes, they were not soft. Browned a little around edges...I would definitely keep an eye on your cookies and not overcook them. Otherwise a good recipe. Added golden raisins, 1.25 Cup.

These were pretty good. I added some chocolate chips for the men of the house, but I will probably leave them out the next time I make them.

This cookie recipe is SO AWESOME! I made ALOT of cookies with this because my mom likes them small. They are packed full of flavor and they are so deliciously chewy! I had to add a little more flour cuz the dough was a little runny the first time I made them, but it's better now! I added pumpkin pie spice (it's up to you guys how much you want to add; I use a little like a 1/4 tsp.) Be careful with the cinnamon, it sort of overwhelmes the taste. The oatmeal does have a tendency to seperate from the dough, though. So if you really want to have some oatmeal taste in your mouth, add more. Overall a BOMBING recipe that deserves some extra recognition!

very good cookies.soft and chewy. I varied the recipe a little. I used 2 cups of individual packets of raisin and spice instant oatmeal and 1 cup of regular rolled oats. Made for a tasty cookie. My kids loved them. This is a keeper! Thanks.

Oh my goodness...I LOVED these cookies and I am not a huge oatmeal raisin cookie fan.  I added 1 cup of raisins (used baking raisins which are softer and more plump than regular raisins).  CAUTION: do not double this recipe unless you have a "monster" of a mixer.  I tried to double it and almost burned up the motor on my mixer.  It is a very stiff dough.  I ended up kneading it with my hands.  The trouble was worth it though because they were probably the best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever had.  My friend (an oatmeal-raisn cookie expert) loved them but offers the advice of using more raisins and a bit more cinnamon.

delicious. i used 1 T less butter (i was a bit short) and dark brown sugar, plus pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon. so good. 
even my calorie-counting roommates couldn't resist. 
also, i cut the recipe in half and it worked just fine.

I thought these oatmeal cookies were great! I was out of cinnamon and only had regular old-fashioned oats so I went with what I had.  I skipped the chilling and rolling and used my small cookie scoop instead.   As another reviewer noted these have a butterscotch flavor that I found delightful.  The old fashioned oats added an interesting texture that I enjoyed.  This recipe is a keeper in my house!

Totally delicious.
I disagree with the reviews calling them 'bland' - I didnt put any chips or fruits in mine and I thought they were excellent.  The cooking of hte brown sugar along with the butter (although I used half butter, half margarine) gives a subtle butterscotch flavor to the cookies.  Also, I added a little Almond Extract, and that worked well to give it a tiny kick.  
Very chewy - YUM!

Best oatmeal cookies I've ever made - and that says a lot! They would be even better with some chips or raisins as they are a bit bland without.

I was a little dissapointed with this cookie. I found it rather bland tasting.  I had to throw out half the batch, as they sat in the cookie jar for weeks!
I don't think I would make these again.
If I ever do I would definately add 1 or maybe even 2 cups of raisins, if anything just to give these cookies a little flavor!

These were amazing! I agree with others who say not to push the dough down with a fork. They will naturally flatten out, leaving you with super yummy, chewy cookies. I made half the batch just as the recipe says and then added dried cranberries to the second half. Both were delicious!

I will likely make again, however I did use 1.5 cups of white sugar instead of 2 cups (1 brown and 1 white). I found that this kept it from being overly sweet and reduced calories as well.

Best oatmeal cookie recipe I have found!  I added raisins, did not chill or flatten the dough, used a large cookie scoop to place dough on silpat sheets and avoided greasing the cookie sheets. Baked for 8 minutes in a convection oven on 350. I am definitely saving this one for my go to oatmeal cookie recipe.

Terrible.  These cookies are just gooey and NOT soft.  What a waste!  Made these for my baby and im afraid to even give them to him because they seem raw rather than soft.  If I wanted to eat some dough, I'd skip the baking part.

I made it twice - first time melting butter in microwave 85% and didn't chill the mix at all. Added coconut and dried cranberries  This resulted in thin, crunchy almost macaroon textured biscuits. Today I made it again and melted butter in microwave 20% followed recipe adding coconut, cramberries once again.  Once again, did not chill the recipe. This time I was able to roll it in to balls and achieved a more scone like appearance.  Delicious either way, really pleased :)

First time attempting oatmeal cookies and came across this recipe. Loved how easy and straightforward it was especially because I didn't need to use a stand or hand mixer. I had made this recipe once before and found, as others have mentioned, that the amount of salt did make the cookies a little salty. The second time I made this, I only put a cup and a half of white sugar and half a teaspoon of salt. Did not change the integrity of the cookies in terms of how soft it was and how many cookies it yield but I love how I'm able to adjust the level of sweet and salty to cater to my own personal preference. I added more than the recommended amount of cinnamon and vanialla extract and also put in some Trader Joe's Pumpkin spice and powdered ginger. Chilled the dough for maybe fifteen minutes just to make it less tacky when rolling. Rolled into walnut sized balls as others have suggested and did not squish it flat so that it retained a lot more chew and density after baking for 9 minutes at 375F. This recipe made 40 cookies for me! Will continue to use this recipe for all future oatmeal cookies!

Simple and wonderful. Crisp outside, chewy inside. Lots of sugar makes these taste delicious. I've tried many different variations now, too; dark brown sugar adds a richer taste. I've subbed almond flour and used white/whole wheat with equal success. This is my fave, decadent ('cause of the sugar), oatmeal cookie - hands down (or in the air like I just don't care!).

This recipe is wonderful.  Delicious.  Sweet.  So soft.  I roll the dough into balls.  Not flat.  If you want sugar? I have rolled the dough balls in granulated sugar prior to placing on cookie sheet to bake.  The dough was stiff.  I did add a bit of milk to batter to soften up  however.  It didn't hurt the cookie or make the Batter runny.  Not with 3 cups of oats.   Enjoy

This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe I have ever found. I made them for my older kids and grandkids. I had to drive over to their house to deliver them because I was  in danger of eating them all by my self. I didn't alter the recipe, it is perfect just as it is.

I added 1 cup of crushed walnuts and these were the best oatmeal cookies I ever ate in my life.  They were so soft and tasty, that they didn't last very long at all.  I've made them twice since then and twice they were a hit!

These are DELICIOUS! I made as is with adding 1 Cup of chocolate chips at the end. Like others, I didn’t chill the dough or flatten with a fork. I used kosher salt and I think that made them extra yummy. A keeper!

Love these!!! 

My oven sucks so I did them at 325° for 9 minutes & 30 seconds. 

Seriously, these are the only cookies I didn't burn! Not one batch!!! I've made a lot of cookies and I'm not very good at it but holy smokes I rocked this recipe!

Will be adding this to my recipe box for sure!

Maybe next time I'll add raisins for fun.

I've made 2 batches, 1st one following the recipe and 2nd for some changes. These are good, but not moist or soft, and are very sweet, I have sweet tooth but still got overwhelmed. Both batches turned out thin flat and crispy, the 2nd had more chewy inside due to I didn't press them out. I reduced white sugar to half and changed a little bit butter with veg oil, putting the dough in fridge didn't make significant change. Made some changes with small oats, raisin and choco chips. This recipe is good, but I still need to look for a softer one

Sometimes, it came out more crispy and puffy than usual, maybe because of temperature and error in measurement of  ingredients.

I backed off on the sugar by 1/4 cup, didn't flatten or refrigerate, baked for the full 10 minutes and loved the results. Next time I'll use 1-tsp salt and bake for 10-1/2 minutes. The search for a soft oatmeal cookie recipe that rivals my mother's is over.  (She passed away without leaving a recipe.)

You can adjust the baking time depending on how soft/crunchy you want them, but be careful not to overbake.  I used less sugar then the instructions suggest, they were sweet enough.

Cookies came out a tad bit too sweet for me. Next time, I'd lower the sugar content. I should also flatten my cookies further to make it more cookie-like. Overall, family likes it!

I only put 2 cups of oats. I halved the butter and added a half cup of crisco. I also used Apple Pie Spice in place of Cinnamon. I only had to bake mine for 8 minutes. They were nice and chewy. Very happy with the recipe.

I added finely crushed candy canes and sprinkled it on top of each cookie. Going to take some to a church Christmas party.  Hubby and college son will enjoy the rest. I also set aside some for neighbors next door. I accidently put my thumb in one of them as I took them out of the oven, so I ate that one. Ha Ha  Really Good, if I say so myself.

These are quick and easy to make cookies. I lowered the amount of sugar from two cups to just one. My kids loved them, but I thought it was still very sweet and lacked in flavor. Also I took them out right at 10mins and they were over baked. That’s my fault though I should of checked on them sooner.

Very easy and everyone loved them, but I would highly recommend not pressing them down with a fork. They become crispy. Still good, but not as pretty, chewy, or soft.

Great cookie recipe.  My granddaughter, a friend of hers, and I made these together and had so much fun!  Of course, 13 year old cheerleaders are a lot of fun anyway, but this was over the top fun. Watching them shape these cookies into balls and the amount of cookie dough on their hands was so fun!
I did add extra cinnamon to this recipe as was a suggestion from some others.  Glad I did!  This recipe is a keeper for sure!!  Will be making many more in the coming days.  Thanks for a super recipe!

I made this, following the recipe for the most part.  The only things I did differently, was not refrigerating  the dough before baking and I made them smaller(about half the size-I’m on a diet). They taste good and are soft.  Thanks for the recipe!

If only you would know how awful I am at cooking. I had a cookie competition at work and I really wanted to win, and figured Oatmeal cookies would be a good idea/easiest thing. TURNS OUT I WON THE COOKIE COMPETITION! If you are as bad as me in cooking, these are SUPER easy and are a hit with everyone.

I did make a couple of adjustments,  and luckily they turned out great still!  I added a cup of peanut butter,  and 1/2 tsp more of vanilla, because I left out the cinnamon altogether.  Also, I  replaced 1 cup of flour with 1/2 c of more oats and 1/2 c of hemp hearts, flaxseed, and chia seed combined. They're still chewy and have a really good healthy oat and nutty flavor. My family loved them!

I didn't refrigerate the dough before baking and I just dropped them on the cookie sheet. Also, used parchment paper. I would definitely bake these again!

Used this recipe as my palette, then added raisins, butterscotch & chocolate chips, sunflower seeds, pecans, cashews and peanuts for extra protein and texture. Baked 10 minutes, and they look beautiful. Thanks!

Good basic recipe but I added only half a teaspoon salt and added tablespoon of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon nutmeg and quarter cup vanilla to make then taste deeper and richer. When you add these things it isn't over powering at all, It just tastes like gourmet cookies. I dropped the cookies instead of flattening because they make perfect cookies this way. I didn't shape them at all, but piled the cookie about 3/4 of an inch high, that way they will be moist and chewy. I baked them for 8 minutes only.

AWESOME oatmeal cookie recipe without raisins.  Followed directions exactly, turned out very moist and chewy. Not cakey or dry at all.  Make sure to refrigerate dough for minimum 1 hour as indicated, and between batches.  This helps reduce spread and make the cookies develop a chewy texture.  Yum!!

I've made these cookies a couple of times before, and they turned out to be quite hard afterward, but I think it may be because of the ingredients I used. However, my most recent batch was unbelievably successful. The cookies had a perfectly soft texture and had the right amount of chewiness. I also cut 1/4 cup from each type of sugar and found them to still be slightly sweet (for my taste). I also added some dried cranberries to give it an extra kick and they turned out delicious!! Made about 50 cookies and they were gone within seconds with positive feedback! Will definitely use this recipe again :)

I’m not sure where I went wrong but this cookie wasn’t great.  Flavor was okay but not moist at all.  I made several different pans and varied the cook time to see if I needed more or less time, they all turned out pretty dry.  I will keep looking for my go to oatmeal recipe.

Great! Cook for about 9 minutes for chewy, soft cookies. No need to let it sit in the fridge. Cookies are a lot prettier and without pushing them down with a fork and sugar. Used 7/8th of a cup of vegetable oil instead of butter. Cook until edges golden. Inside is so chewy and delicious. Eat some while they are warm. So good! I will make it again.

We are a new kitchen in a small town testing recipes and came across this one. So we decided to give it a whirl.  We did not make any changes and yes, we will be making them again.  They definitely hold up to several of the reviews. They are soft, chewy and moist. Our friends and family just loved them.

I usually eat dairy-free, so I used melted coconut oil instead of butter (a little more than one cup melts to be about a cup), and didn't refrigerate and they came out great! 

Super important to grease the cookie sheet though, and don't leave them on the pan for more than 5 minutes, or they'll be hard to take off.

Also, I made halved the recipe and it made about 2 dozen cookies. Just for reference.

I was looking for a basic recipe to add coconut too. This was perfect. I just reduced the oatmeal about 1/2 cup to account for the volume of coconut I wanted to add which was 3/4 cup. I reduced the sugar as I usually do but I did even more because I used sweetened coconut. I held a tab back on the vanilla and added just a bit of coconut extract.  You have to be careful with it. 
Cookies where just what we wanted. Wish we had walnuts in the house. That would have been perfect. Oh, I went real light on cinnamon.

I love these cookies.  Some how they always end up running, maybe because my husband can't wait for them.  I might try adding less butter next time.  I used unsalted butter,  but I added an extra 1/2tsp... because I love the sweet and salty flavor...

These came out so good. I did not smash them down and they baked perfectly. I added chocolate chips, raisins and chopped walnuts. This recipe also makes quite a few. I will definitely be making these more often.

Big hit with the family.  These are almost sugar cookie tasting - which no one hear minded.  I would maybe cut the sugar amount next time.
Very nice cookie

I'm not sure what I did wrong but the cookies were way too difficult to make into a ball.  When i used a fork to flatten them they just broke apart.

My family loved these cookies! I substituted  0.5 c of monkfruit sweetner and 1 c of applesauce for the white sugar. I also substituted  Bob’s Red Mill Gluten Free 1:1 Flour for the all purpose flower.  I added 2.5 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of ginger; 2 c of Crasins and 1.5 c of chopped walnuts.  I did have to bake the cookies for  about 12 minutes since I made them 4 inches in diameter.

Excellent cookie. I made according to recipe except I added nuts and coconut and I didn’t mash the cookies balls with a fork. They came out soft and moist.

I didn’t add any chocolate/nuts/cranberries and left them plain. I found them a bit salty, but otherwise great! You can definitely taste the cinnamon. I pressed them down with a fork and they were crispy on the edges and soft in the middle.

I went to make this recipe when I discovered I was out of all purpose flour.  But my heart was set on eating some oatmeal cookies so I used half whole wheat flour and half almond flour.   I also added about 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips, because yumm!  I baked them for 9 minutes and resisted the urge to put them back in for longer.  If you want soft cookies, take them out when you get the slightest bit of brown.  My modified cookies are definitely 5 stars, and I can’t wait to try them with all purpose flour!!

Easy recipe to follow and very delicious. No need to use a sugar fork unless you want a flat cookie. They come out nice and chewy without the fork.  Family loved them.

I followed other suggestions and didn’t flatten them and they turned out so good. My family loved them, will definitely make these again!

These cookies were a great snack. I put in half raisin and half white chocolate chip. Super chewy, if you like chewy cookies I would keep them in for about 10 minutes. Overall great cookie!

These were great! I followed the recipe as is but divided the batter in to two. One batch i kept original the other i added a chopped up a Pink Lady apple to. Both were delicious. I saw someone complaining about how hard the batter was after refrigerating but that was probably their error because the batter was absolutely fine. I didn't flatten out with a sugar covered fork because i love them thick but they flatten themselves out just fine with out the help. They were super quick to throw together and really tasty. Will make again.

I make these with my 8 year old granddaughter (my little baking companion).  Everybody loved, loved, loved these cookies.  The only changes I made was:  I used 1/2 cup sugar, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp salt, 2 tsp vanilla, 2 tsp cinnamon.  I put the oats into food processor for a few seconds; (I added 1/2 cup Crisco Shortening to the required butter mixture: only because the processed oats turn into a flour consistency); and stirred in vanilla chocolate bits.  Other than that, I followed original recipe.  [NOTE: With my adjustments, the cookies are NOT soft -- the consistency is more like a regular cookie....not soft, but, also not dry]. 

Thank you for sharing your easy and delicious recipe.  It is filed with all of my top recipes and will be a "staple" in our family treats.

Super good. I used less cinnamon and added 1/2 cup each of peanut butter and semisweet chips. I used a large cookie scoop and baked until just brown on edges, about 14 min, in my oven.

It was a nice recipe I made for my mom and I realized that while baking,  after 10 minutes it was still very soft but if you take it out to cool,  it will harden a little more.

Great great cookie.  I loved it with the raisins!  It's a five star taste, just  don't over-brown-it, then it won't get too hard.  A real success with my Family and Friends!

I made these slightly substituted. 
1/2 c of coconut oil
1/2 c of butter
2 tsp of cinnamon
Added raisins
Baked at 375 for 11 minutes. I did discover that if you want softer cookies, follow the 8-9 min suggestion. Medium as I like them was 10-11 min. Crunchy came out at 12-13 golden!
All variants were delish but my favorite was at the 11 min bake time.

I ALWAYS change recipes to make them healthier. I used half grass fed butter, half organic coconut oil. Then I substituted the flour with almond flour. Substituted the sugar with coconut palm sugar, and used a little less. Then used sprouted, gluten free oats and added pecans (I didn't have walnuts). Yummy!

I followed the recipe to the letter, except that because I didn't have any plain flour at hand, instead I used ground oatmeal and it was great. 
Knowing that works and with my gluten intolerance I continue to do so. 
Thank for sharing.

I made it and used King Arthur’s gluten free flour instead of the flour. This made a yummy gluten free cookie with no gums added to it. Though the cookie can crumble a bit more easily than a typical cookie the flavor and chewiness were there. Yum!

These were alright. The flavor is good. I did as another person suggested and didn't flatten the balls of dough. Glad  I didn't because they still really flattened out and were more hard and almost crunchy, rather than the soft, chewy consistency that you expect from oatmeal cookies.

This receipt made awesome soft chewy oatmeal cookies. I added chocolate chips to mine and did not use sugar or flatten. I just dropped them maybe heaping tsp size on the pan and they turned out perfect.  Not too flat or crispy, they were perfect!

We didn't have time to chill the dough and just scooped it into  balls and it came out perfect! I was worried about the cinnamon being too much, but the other flavors mellow it out. I'd like to add nuts and raisins next time.

I've made these twice and added a cup of raisins each time.  They are delicious, and they stay soft even after a few days in the cookie tin.  One cookie sheet full I forgot to mash, but those are just as soft as all the rest.  We love them.

I had some leftover cream cheese frosting I made for a cake earlier in the week so I decided to make some cookies to go with it. I halved the recipe and it made about 16 cookies. I followed the recipe except I didn’t refrigerating the dough or smash them down. They turned out perfect and chewy. Sandwiching frosting between 2 cookies, for sure is the best way to go!!

These are excellent! I'm always the person who can't stand when people change the recipe without trying it first...BUT! I made these for myself as they are my fav cookies and I did add a sprinkle of nutmeg, cloves and ginger, just because I love those spices so much! Will make again! Soon!

These were excellent!
I replaced white sugar with 1/2 c stevia & 1 c mashed ripe banana. Also I added 1/2 c raisins ,1 c walnuts and 1 egg. I skipped refrigeration, baked for 10 minutes.
Very adaptable recipe.

These had great flavor but came out way too crispy for my liking even tho I cut down the time. I didn't flatten them out just left them in a ball and chilled the dough for well over an hour. Maybe I'll try them again someday.

I reduced to make 6 servings and it resulted in about 12 small cookies. The cookies taste more like sugar cookies than oatmeal but a very delicious cookie recipe. I like that the edges have a little crisp but soft on the inside. I added raisins to half—definitely better with raisins.

These are lovely, sometimes if I want them thicker, I add another cup of flour, just how I like it. They come out perfect, and sometimes they didn't come out right, they were flat, dark, not soft. So i tested different things, i realized that i cant just scoop them with a round spoon, i have to roll them into tight balls, then they come out round and puffy and soft! Omg i cant get enough of these. I've actually gained some pounds because of these darn cookies they are too good.

These cookies are so yummy! The best part was that I had all of the ingredients on hand. I didn’t change anything about the recipe except that I added cranberries and chocolate chips to part of the dough. The cookies didn’t turn out to be uniform in size, but I wasn’t bothered by that. I highly recommend these flavorful and simple cookies!

This will be my go to oatmeal cookie recipe from now on. Very easy to make and great oatmeal cinnamon flavor and texture. I made two batches and I added white raisins to 1/2 of the second batch. The cookie is so sweet that I may try reducing the sugars to 3/4 cup.

Delicious! My 13yr old daughter wanted to make oatmeal cookies, I happened to have quick cooking oats on hand and the rest of the ingredients are staples at my house.  She made the cookies by herself.. they turned out so well that  we asked her to make another batch today! Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

Excellent cookie.  Easy to adjust the recipe and still comes out great.   I bake as a bar cookie (just rotate the pan half way through). I also like to grind about 1/2 cup of whatever nuts I’m using into a “flour” and add that along with the chopped nuts.  In this recipe I’ve added baking cranberry/apples instead of raisins as well.   Everyone who has eaten one so far wants me to make more.

Great cookies but I did change the amount of sugar. I put in 3/4 cups of each white and brown instead of a full cup of each. Also, I added a cup of both walnuts and raisins and extra cinnamon which my family loves. I left them in balls as another reviewer suggested and they turned out beautifully. I did extend the baking time by 3-4 minutes because they were too soft and the bottoms were not slightly tan. They looked under cooked. When they cooled, they were not soft/chewy but crunchy. Everyone like them! I’ll try again and not add the additional cook time and maybe they’ll be soft/chewy. Thanks for the great recipe.

I followed as instructed, and they turned out wonderfully. I made three batches,  the one put in for about 9 mins was the best. So I recommend to not wait till the whole cookie is brown lol! best cookies ever!

I realized when I went to put the oats in I only had old fashioned oats instead of quick cooking, so I used two cups instead of three, and also added butterscotch chips. I also took the advice of some other reviews and did not flatten the cookies. They turned out fantastic!

The “don’t overcook” caveat is spot on and it’s kind of hard to tell when they’re done so yes take them out earlier than later. 

I did Chill dough but only for 15 min, and likenothers I didnt add sugar and fork press, I just hand pressed down gently more in the middle than sides, and they came out perfect. 

I found these a bit salty and would cut back salt to 1/4 tsp since the butter is salted; otherwise delicious, just right Vanilla-to-cinnamon ratio. You can’t go wrong with all that butter and sugar in a cookie.

Skip the refrigeration step unless you want paving cement for dough. Broke my brand new cookie dough scoop on this stuff. Also the first batch of twelve took twice as long to cook as the rest. Just mix and bake. Lost a star because of that, otherwise best oatmeal cookies I've ever made. I added raisins as recommended.

Happy national oatmeal cookie day! I didn't have quick oats, so I used my blender (4 to 5 quick bursts in food processor was what recommended online) to chop up old fashioned oats for the recipe. The cookies turned out delicious!

I made this without the cinnamon and then filled them with chocolate ganache.  They flattened nicely to make into a sandwich cookies.  These cookies were good on their own as well as with the chocolate.

I made it exactly as the recipe had it, which I always do the first time I make any new recipe. The cookies were a little bit dry. I’ve got to figure out how to fix that. If anyone has any suggestions, I’d love to hear them. Otherwise, they were delicious.

The cookies turned out amazing. I put honey instead of brown sugar as I was out. I thought that dipping the fork in Sugar was unnecessary as it was sweet enough. I took them out 3 minutes for a soft oatmeal cookie it was great

Definitely something anyone can make with ingredients you most likely already have at home. This does make quite a big batch of cookies depending on how big you make them. Because of the amount of cookies I made my family and I couldn't finish them in one day. Even after sitting out for a couple days they were still as soft and moist as when they first came out of the oven. Definitely recommend this recipe!

Hi ho!
These cookies did not need any butterscotch chips they were delicious, sweet, and soft. I recommend using flavored oatmeal (maple syrup, blueberry, raisin etc). I also used Dixie fine china spoons to scoop each cookie for a perfect walnut size serving. 
Warmest Regards, 
Nikki "Cook" Nicole

Great recipe. I did tweak a little. I reduced sugar to 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup unpacked brown sugar. I also added a tbsp of natural peanut butter. Cookies were great!  Made the recipe twice already.

These are perfect. Pull them when the edges turn darker for a very soft cookie. I put Amy Sedaris's buttercream between cookies for oatmeal cream pies. SO GOOD.

I am addicted to these cookies, they are great cold with coffee. in  the early morning, taste almost like a scone.  I cut the recipe to 12 servings instead of 24 and cut the  white and brown sugars to 1/3 cup, put in walnuts.  I like my cookies thin and crispy so I flatten them and bake them 10 minutes.

Minus the salt. Minus the caramelizing the white sugar, only the brown, add white to the dry mix.
Also added Choc Chips as well as raisins another time.

Solid base recipe.

I used whole wheat flour ( slightly less than the 2 cups) and substituted Splenda  for the white sugar. As well, I used Becel lite instead of butter. The result was terrific.

This recipe makes delicious cookies! I divided the dough in thirds and added almonds, dark chocolate and dried blueberries. They came out very delicious but just a little too sweet for me and I did't even flatten them with sugar. Maybe next time I'll cut on the sugar a little. Other than that, thus recipe is perfect!!

I just literally finished baking this oatmeal cookies and they are soft crunchy on the edges and gooey inside. I used old fashion oats. I only put 2 cups oats. I didn’t chill I just  shaped them to a small ball size and shoved them in the oven for exactly 10 min. I am never gonna buy cookies again. I’m just gonna make it from now on. I didn’t press down on them or put sugar on the fork. I also made plain oatmeal and another batch with almonds.

I made 2 batches. One with cranberry raisins and one with finely chopped walnuts. Both were fantastic. Only a 15 minute prep time and clean up was a snap.I will gladly make them again.

My first time making these. I made a 1/2 batch.
Very good cookie! 
I dipped a glass in sugar and used that to press the cookie down. 
I see there is a not to use foil to keep the cookie moist. I have used a slice of bread in with cookies when I store them. If the bread gets hard grab a new slice.

These were definitely chewy, I used salted butter and didn’t skip adding salt like I should have.. if you use salted butter, skip the tsp of salt. My 6yr old said they were “ok” I thought they would’ve have been good with a little more vanilla and a little less salt

Thesae are good, even although I changed and lessened some ingredients. I turned mine into granola cookies by adding some bulk dried fruits and seeds. Note: I xan imagine the would be greater with all the ingredients. I did not have butter and lessened recipe of 1 cup of sugar.

I added plumped raisins with a Tbsp or so of water because the dough was so dry.  I used salted butter so I never add salt to any recipe requiring salt.  Not a big fan of this recipe, but my boys liked them.  They won't go to waste, that's for sure!!

I didn’t have plain old rolled oat but I did have oatmeal in the microwave packs ... so I improvised because I really wanted oatmeal cookies! I did sift out all the extra sugar, dates walnuts and raisins that I could. Cookies turned out good :)

It was too sweet for me and the cookies did not turn out very moist or chewy. They did not spread out in the oven but stayed in same shape and size as when put in the oven.

This makes a LOT of cookies. I made 12 cookies using the original recipe. Then, I added 1/2 cup milk, 1/4 cup cocoa, 1/2 cup chocolate chips and made another 18 cookies.  I added 1/4 cup smooth peanut butter to the remaining chocolate oatmeal mix and made an additional 12 cookies.  Thanks for the versatile and yummy recipe!

Yum! this is a great recipe! I added in 1/2 c chocolate covered raisins and 1/2 c yogurt covered craisins - the resilt was heavenly! Cookies are delicious and moist. Like bakery cookies. I put the dough in the refrigerator to make it easier to handle by hand, then used a knife to subdivide the dough onto 24 lumps. I rolled them into balls by hand, flattened them, then placed them on the cookie sheet. To die for! Will definitely make again.

It was a little hard to make but I guess thats on me. (I put in to many eggs and it took longer than it says.) I put them to chill in the freezer for 15 minutes and they ended pretty well. This recipe was good.

I made these and they definitely came out nice and chewy! They were, however, too sweet (and I have a sweet tooth!) next time I’ll halve the white sugar.

Followed along with another review and added 1/2 tsp cloves and only 1 tsp cinnamon.  I also used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter instead of the whole cup of butter.  I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1 1/2 cup of white sugar.  These turned out great with chocolate chips in 1

Made half of the batter with 1/8 cup of cocoa powder. Personally found them a little too sweet but everyone else thought they were perfect. Might go with 3/4 or 2/3 cup of sugar next time. Also baked them at 360F for 10 minutes instead of 375F and they came out perfect consistency wise. Crispy on the outside and moist and chewy on the inside.

I would have given this a 5-star rating but... though my end result was a great tasting, sweet, flavorful cookie, they hardened. Not so much they were uncomfortable to eat, but they did harden quite a bit. I'm not sure what the secret is to keep cookies soft and/or chewy (I rarely have a problem with other cookies) but, overall, this recipe is very good. I followed to the letter and ended up with a very sweet tasting cookie!

I made half the recipe with no other changes. It made 27 cookies of 1 to 1 1/4 inches. Eight minutes of baking, edges started to turn brown, crunchy outside, moist inside, great taste. Perfect!

These cookies were definitely NOT moist. I followed recipe to the letter but I feel that three cups of oatmeal is way to much and made the cookies too dry.   Very disappointed to have spent the time and effort on these for my holiday baking.

Interesting how the same recipe turns out differently for different bakers. Followed recipe, added mini chocolate chips to batch then halved it adding coconut to half, heath bits to other. Very good! Would not squish  down next time.

Great basic recipe that you can add to easily. I used half quick oats, and half old fashioned oats since I like the mixed texture and they were delicious.

To sweet.  I compared this to the recipe I usually use, and it has more sugar.  These were crunchy on the bottom and under cooked on the top.  I don't think I've ever had a crunchy bottom on a cookie baked on an AirBake cookie sheet.  For new bakers, it's the excess sugar that makes them crunchy on the bottom.   I really didn't even want to give 3 stars, but they were edible, so I did.

Very good cookie but too much oatmeal.  The next time I make them I'll use 1/2 cup less oatmeat, but still a great cookie.

I loved this recipe.  I made it for work and tripled the recipe because I work in a kitchen. I have to make desserts for our specials.  I choose this one and made 2 changes.  #1 I didn't add sugar and smash the cookie.  I used a spoon and put them on the tray.  I had to adjust my cooking time due to an industral oven.  I added chocolate chips to my recipe.  The other change I had to make was use half glutton free oatmeal and half regular quick oats.  We were running out and I needed enough so I used it.  They were very soft and good.  Loved the touch of cinnamon in them,too!

This s is a delicious soft oatmeal cookie.  The only change I would make is to use less salt, 3/4 tsp instead of 1 tsp

The first time I made these I added Chocolate chips, Walnuts and a few other bits of this and that to the recipe, I found the next time I will do this I need to double the recipe to make sure I have enough of the dough!  But they were amazing!  I just made them as the recipe says and they turned out just as nice!!  :)

I put raisins in  1/2 the batch & butterscotch chips in the other 1/2. And because I only had medium eggs, I added a 3rd egg. They all came out delicious.  Next time I'll make a double batch, so I can use raisins and butterscotch chips again.

Really good recipe, made about 150 of them in large quantity. Just a couple things, I added a little less cinnamon and didnt coat the fork. Took about 12min in the oven but I was cooking a large amount at once. I recommend pressing the cookies down 100% the dough is super thick and would take forever in the oven otherwise. A small ice cream scoop works great for traying no need to roll.

I’m only giving this recipe two stars because of the taste of cookies. I followed the recipe exactly. They were soft and yummy immediately out of oven, but if you wait until they cool, you’re gambling with your teeth. They were hard as rocks! I made them for a family gathering and luckily I knew how to sprinkle with water and butter (spray can) and popped in the microwave for a few seconds to make them soft again. This saved me a lot of embarrassment. I won’t make again.

I made it exactly as suggested except... I used 3 C of apple cinnamon instant oatmeal (it's what I had). I didn't use cinnamon and I didn't use a spoon and flatten them with sugar either. I cooked them on a Pampered Chef stone and they turned out amazing. 
Thanks everyone for sharing their ideas as well. 
Happy baking.

This is the only oatmeal cookie recipe I use! Putting the dough in the fridge makes all the difference honestly and totally worth the wait. I add extra cinnamon and even a bit of honey (not in the recipe). These cookies are definitely addicting and won't last long!

Personally, I thought they were too salty. Next time I’ll cut the amount of salt in half.

A few changes were made but overall very good base recipe for oatmeal cookies!!! I didn’t have baking soda so I used baking powder, worked fine. And I did not flatten them or add sugar on top before baking, I rollled them in balls and then baked the balls as as, made for very moist chewy cookies. I also added about a half cup of raisins to mine .. it’s a fave in our house now! I’ve made them twice and they don’t last a day here

Recipe is great! I creamed butter really well before adding other ingredients as well as added a cup of raisins. I also measured out my cookies as 1/4 cup for each cookie an roller into ball, did not flatten it. Cooked for 10-11 minutes.

This is going to be my go to oatmeal cookie recipe from now on. Moist, sweet and soft. They are plenty sweet enough that a dipped fork in sugar to press the dough really isnt needed.  Raisins or chocolate chips would be awesome if added.

I love them. I followed every direction and added chocolate chips & cranberries to some. Using sugar on fork helps cookie to not stick while pressing. I'm so making these around the holidays.

Delish!!!!  I halved this recipe, used one cup of old fashion oatmeal and 1/2 cup of coconut.   Cookies are wonderful!  Soft yet a little crisp around the edges.  I call them perfection.

I really liked this recipe, I have a business where I sell desserts and I kept getting requests for these amazing oatmeal cookies. I of course, had NO idea what an oatmeal cookie was because I had never eaten one before. I tried out this recipe and it was delicious!  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe. My first oatmeal cookie was absolutely FABULOUS! I will definitely use this recipe again.

I made mine a little bigger, so I needed a longer cooking time. I also used unsalted butter; next time I will add a touch more salt to compensate (or use salted butter). I also added raisins after soaking them in hot water. My next attempt at these will include way more cinnamon, and some nutmeg. As is though, the nutty, buttery, chewy-ness of these cookies are fantastic, I will absolutely make these again.

Used scant teaspoon of salt, only one teaspoon of cinnamon and some fresh grated nutmeg. Added 1/2 c chocolate chips to half of the batter and 1/2 c chopped walnuts to the other half. Baked 8 minutes for small cookies.

This recipe is really good but I later had to modify because I had to go mostly vegetarian.  I did use 3 egg whites,  less sugar, added granola and ground flax, used 1/2 the butter and other half olive oil, used red winter wheat that is unbleached and not enriched.

We love fall spices. So in lieu of spiced rum I add to all of my oatmeal cookies I added 1/8 tsp of nutmeg and ground clove.

Tip- Take it out after 8-10 mins. My first batch It looked too soft after 8 mins so I left it in the oven for 10 more minutes. Came out crispy. Taking it out after 10 mins it will harden naturally as it cools. Otherwise followed the directions exactly and the other  batches were chewy  and taste good. First time making cookies too.

I didn’t put it in the fridge at all nor did I flatten it with a fork. The recipe called for a cup of brown sugar but we ran out! Instead I substituted in 1/2 cup of white sugar and the only 1/4 cup of brown sugar we had left. It tasted fantastic! It was soft and chewy with the edges a bit crunchy. Another tip, make sure to separate the cookies by at least 1 1/2 inch, so they don’t come together like one big cookie!

You may want to reduce the baking soda to 1/2 teaspoon. They taste a little baking soda-y but they are good.

First, I cut the recipe in half since I'm a single guy on a diet. ;-) ... I like how simple and quick these are to make. Have made them several times with some modifications. Using organic instant packs of oatmeal with maple cinnamon, added much less brown sugar because of it. Used a little canola oil to replace so much butter. Also used a little less sugar as these are plenty sweet for me. Mixed and chilled for an hour. Rolled up dough batter to golf ball size and baked for 10-12 minutes at 350º F on parchment paper (a little lower temperature and longer). Flattened down to about 4" inch diameter 1/2" inch thick cookies. 4 days later they are still soft and chewy inside, stored in a ziplock bag. Would be easy to add chocolate chips. Very tasty!

HI. I made the recipe exactly as was stated and they were so yummy good. For some reason they tasted like they had just a hint of ginger in them. I shared some with my neighbors and they said the same thing and asked for the recipe so I gave them the site address. I think these may be the best cookies I’ve ever made, they are soft and chewy, and they never get hard. Thank you.

These cookies were the bomb! And I didn't change a single thing except I didn't refrigerate them before cooking. My husband is all picky and critical and he had not a single bad thing to say. As a matter of fact he ate most of them. So easy! I cooked them for the least amount of time. 8 minutes and they came out just a little crunchy on top but they were still soft and chewy. I'll never use another oatmeal cookie recipe.  If I were to make any adjustments, I might put a little less sugar in the batter.  They were pretty sweet.

Fabulous! Oatmeal cookies have never been a favorite of mine, but I was looking for something sweet that wouldn’t completely throw off my diet and still tasted good. These hit the spot! I made some substitutions to make them a little more diabetic friendly. I substituted white sugar for Splenda and replaced the brown sugar with Splenda Brown Sugar Blend. Lastly, I subbed the white flour with almond flour. Turned out perfect! Even my non-diabetic household members loved them.

I’ve been looking for a soft oatmeal cookie and this is it. I did chill the dough for an hour and did not flatten the cookie balls. Initially I baked them for 9 minutes but after the cookies cooled they were darker than I wanted. I’ll try 8 minutes from now on. I added chocolate chips to the dough and after letting the baked cookies set a few minutes they tended to stick to the baking sheet. I used parchment paper after the first batch and they slid right off and stayed a bit rounder too. This recipe is a keeper. I will try it with an assortment of different chips to change it up, but the basic recipe is just wonderful.

I honestly don’t know if I reviewed this before so I’m doing it now or again....

These are amazing cookies. I never did flatten the cookies, to me flattening with a fork should be for peanut butter cookies not oatmeal. 

Anyway, they have been perfect every time I’ve made them, which is going on about a dozen times with my latest batch  of dough sitting in the fridge for a bit before baking. 

I do not use raisins as I don’t care for them and has nothing to do with the recipe at all. 

My husband has never cared for oatmeal cookies until I made these and now he asks me to make them for him. I have and do recommend this recipe to anyone that’s wants an easy recipe for an amazing cookie.

I will say they can become addicting so bake as your own risk.

Overall they were very tasty,chewy and filling cookies. They were really good looking when they came out of the oven. If your a beginner baker and you want to make something for your family,friends or even just bake for fun this would be a great recipe to tryout. Have fun baking! :)

Very good.  I made some changes and used spenda blends to get the sugar down.  Plus, I used margarine.  I'll play with the sugar ratios again......maybe less sugar by at least 1/2 cup.  I added nuts and raisins, And watched them very carefully in the oven because they go from almost done to overdone very quickly.

Delicious! I didn't have any white sugar so instead, I used another cup of brown sugar and they came out amazing. Right, when I pulled them out I sprinkled some cinnamon on them and it was just the icing on the cake. Delicious cookies that I highly recommend.

I followed the recipe as written. Cooked using three racks on convection for 10 minutes.   Should have checked at 9 minutes as they were a little crispier than I prefer, but still delicious.

They were easy to make and I made them small so I got a lot out of the batter. My friends and family loved them! I didn’t press them flat though, I left them in small balls, and the cookies I got were small, but soft and delicious.

Mine were thin and crispy.not what I was hoping for.
I am not sure why but made two changes
1 I used Becel margarine instead of butter, and I weighed my flour (113 Grm for 1 cup flour)

Also after 10 minutes they were not firm and could not be lifted. I needed 15 minutes

Did I need more fat?

Excellent recipe!  I even forgot to add in the vanilla and eggs at the right time (I mixed them in after the flour was incorporated), and they still turned out fine.  I didn't chill the dough, and the first batch I put in the oven I didn't press down with a fork.  They didn't spread out, and wanted to brown too much on the bottom before cooking on the inside, so I pressed them down during the last 2 minutes of cooking.  On the second batch, I pressed them down with my finger before baking  and I was much happier with the results.  They were soft in the middle and crispy on the edges.  

I added dried cranberries and chopped walnuts to mine, and made no other adjustments to the recipe.  This will be my oatmeal cookie recipe from now on.

Baked them longer for more of a crunchy cookie, didn't throw them in the fridge, and added some ground cloves and chocolate chips. They were amazing and turned out lovely.

Just took these out of the oven and let them rest for 1 min on the parchment and then onto the cooling rack. Delicious! We ate a dozen while they they were still warm. They were soft and chewy as the name indicates. Recipe made 4 1/2 dozen of 2-2 1/2 in. cookies. Made one addition and one subtraction: Added 3/4 cup dried cranberries and reduced the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon and I will only use 3/4 teaspoon next time. I'm not a fan of cinnamon. I baked on parchment lined baking sheets and did not bother to chill the dough; used immediately. I didn't roll nor flatten; just used a spoon to scoop and place on baking sheet. These were quick and easy to make. This will be my go to oatmeal cookie recipe from now on! Thanks BITTERSWEET1!

Delicious. Very rich and soft. Made a few adjustments. Did not use a fork nor did I roll the dough balls in sugar. I used an ice cream scoop instead and barely pressed the balls at all. I added Godiva semi-sweet chips, 2 tablespoons of rum, and 3 tablespoons of organic honey. Left them in a for a little less time so they’d be softer.

I added a half cup of peanut butter and a fourth cup of baking cocoa. My little brother loves it. The mixture was very sticky, but that was most likely due to my additions.

I’ve had better. These  tasted salty, even my 11 year old said she could taste the salt. She usually loves cookies no matter what, but couldn’t finish her second one because of this. I didn’t chill the dough and used a small cookie scoop- the consistency was fine. They’re soft if you take them out of the oven and immediately transfer them to a cooling rack at 10 mins. Otherwise, they’ll be crispy.

I’m definitely saving this recipe! The outside had a little crunch while the inside is chewy. I rolled mine in big balls (maybe 2 tablespoons worth?) and left them round while they baked instead or flattening them.

I'm diabetic, so used Splenda for the white sugar, but used regular brown sugar and it seemed to work fine.  I was hoping the cookies would have been a little softer and maybe the Splenda had something to do with that.  I will use this recipe again.

They came out great! Everyone loved them! My 3 yr old wanted to bake oatmeal cookies. Actually had my 3 and 1 yr old making them. We chose not to flatten them with a fork and my 1 yr old added extra cinnamon.  Super soft and tasty! Will make them again.

liked it a lot, the cookies flatten while baking so don't worry about the thickness of the ball.

This was the first time I was disappointed by a recipe rated so highly here. They aren't soft, more chewy...but only if taken out at the perfect time. And too salty. I don't recommend this as a no fuss, good cookie recipe.

I cut the amount of both sugars in half. Added raisins to half the batch and salted caramel chips to the other half. Was plenty sweet enough. Didn’t need all the sugar in the recipe. Will make again and try other additions.

I used steel ground oats. I also divided it in thirds. One plain. Second with 2 TBS  peanut butter, the third with craisins. All three were very nice.

Like the reviewer who found the dough too dry, I also thought the dough didn't stick together well to form dough balls. I  added a couple of tablespoons of milk to the remaining dough after I baked the first pan full. I'm not sure that helped much.  

I did not flatten the cookies so I do not know if I would have had the results that some did. I think the cookies would have been dry and too crisp. Unflattened, I found them chewy and yet soft enough.

I did find the cookies sweet enough - perhaps sweeter than  other  oatmeal cookies I've made and the cinnamon flavor was noticeable. If you don't like cinnamon,  I would reduce the amount.

 I also didn't add as much salt  (about half) as  recommended as I grew up in a household with family members on a low salt diet .  Therefore, most foods are too salty for me anyway so these cookies were okay in that regard.

My spouse doesn't care for raisins  so that is why I tried this recipe.  We both like the flavor but I don't think I will make these again. I may just make  my personal favorite raisin oatmeal and omit the raisins in favor of nuts or chocolate chips - which he does like.

I made these formy husband, though I don't eat them. He loved them, our son, daughter and granddaughter all loved them as well. I did however try another reviewers suggestion to leave them rolled them in a ball when baking them. I tried both ways and leaving them in a ball worked so much better. I also surprisingly had to add a little more time. Our oven is new and tends to bake faster, so I'd suggest doing a few small batches to check the time. The cookies started chewy until they had finished all of them.

The cookies were very "fluffy" and they tasted alright. Like the other commentor said, they were a tad salty, but pretty good. Also, I didn't add brown sugar to the cookie batter and the cookies came out wonderfully! Would definitely recommend this recipe to others. :)

So easy to make! I made a few changes: I didn't refrigerate the batter, I added pecans (cuz that's all I had), I didn't flatten the cookie with a sugared fork, and added a few dashes of cloves. Next time I might add more cinnamon or cinnamon chips. Really like this recipe. Although there was 1 cup each of white and brown sugar I didn't think it was too sweet.

I tried twice. 1st time  they came out flat and 2nd time I did a bit improvement, and they were not as flat as the 1st attempt but the center of  the cookies were still under cooked but the edge was burned. Not sure where went wrong. Flavor was good though. These cookies just didn't turn out well with me :(

These cookies are amazing! I made an adult version of these cookies because we found a bottle of cinnamon whiskey. First, I soaked raisins in the whiskey all day. Added the raisins to the batter when I was ready to refrigerate the dough. Then, I took the left over booze from the raisins and made a glaze. Also, I put just a touch of orange peel in the dough for an extra touch of magic. This recipe is easy and leaves lots of room for any personal touches you may want to add. Thank you so much for thus amazing recipe!

The best oatmeal cookies I have EVER eaten!!  Like so many other reviewers, I made them exactly according to the recipe except I didn't refrigerate the dough  or press them down with a sugar fork.  I rolled them into balls and they were divine!!  They don't spread very much so you can put them fairly close together. I cooked them for 8min. just until they were crispy around the edges but still very soft in the middle.  They hardened a bit as they cooled but stayed super soft and moist. These were truly the BEST oatmeal cookies I have ever had.  This is my new go to recipe.

Made these 3 times in a week so far.  Reduced the sugar a little, and added raisins.  Can't get enough of them.

I googled best oatmeal cookie recipes and this was the 2nd from the top. This will now be my go-to recipe, these cookies are SO good!! I baked them for my husband (who doesn't really have a sweet tooth but loves oatmeal cookies) and he couldn't stop eating them lol. 
I did everything exactly as the recipe called and it was all super fast and easy. Thanks for sharing!
*I did add two 1oz each boxes of craisins to add a little sweetness and they were perfect.

Little dry - will add a bit more butter next time or maybe a bit of milk.  Excellent flavour.   I used a cup of dried cranberries, really enjoyed them.

I have made this several times and have made some variations to make this the perfect, semi-nutritious oatmeal cookie. These come out soft and more importantly, they stay soft even days later. I altered the recipe first cutting the number of servings in half (12 servings or about 2 dozen), then by subtracting half a cup of flour and adding 3 tablespoons of brewers yeast and 3 tablespoons of ground flaxseed. I add the slightest bit (tablespoon -ish) of water to the oats before combining all ingredients together and the oats seem to be a little bit softer. I also add butterscotch chips to the mix just before baking. I usually don't chill the dough, but it is better to in order to prevent the butter from melting too fast and causing the cookies to run together. They are also good with chopped walnuts. When I made the recipe exactly as stated, the cookies came out almost cake-like, but hardened by the following day so these small alterations seem to make a big difference.

These came out great, with a nice combination of flavors I haven't found in other recipes. My only beef is not being able to get them as flat as in the main photo here (even after squishing them down with the fork), but still very nice!

A delicious oatmeal cookie! Like others, I didn’t flatten with a fork. This resulted in a soft, 2 1/2” cookie when done. My oven cooks a little cool, so it took 11 minutes of bake time, plus 5 minutes on the pan once out of the oven before transfer to a cooling rack. Refrigerating the dough for an hour before rolling up into balls and cooking definitely helps  prevent the cookies from flattening overmuch, so don’t skip that step. The recipe is easily adaptable. I’ve added up to 2 cups of nuts/chocolate chips/ soaked raisins with outstanding results. Yum!

Loved this recipe but I did however minus 1/2 of white sugar and add 1/2 a cup brown sugar...I found they stayed soft longer and with a couple of batches I actually pressed them down flatter as my husband loves crunchy cookies.

This recipe is awesome as it is! It’s my go to oatmeal cookie recipe. I have however made adjustments recently. I read that adding extra oats to your diet helps increase milk production while breast-feeding. That being said I make them all the time. But since I’m eating them so often I reduce the sugar. You can make this recipe with 2/3 cup white sugar and 2/3 cup brown sugar and they turn out great. Definitely not as sweet. They’re still really good. If you add raisins this way it will add some sweetness.

I loved this recipe, and I did modify it a bit.  I'm not a sugar fan so I cut the sugar in half.  I only smooshed the cookies slightly, and I didn't put sugar on the fork.  I baked them for 10 minutes, and they are soft and moist.  Hubby and the dogs give it thumbs and paws up.

Delicious!  Moist or crispy or a little of both depending on how long we cooked them.  The only thing I did differently from the recipe is use regular oatmeal (didn’t have quick cooking) and I pressed the flattened cookie in chopped walnuts before baking instead of flattening with a sugar-dipped fork.  Awesome.  I said, “I’m keeping this recipe” and my husband gaped at me and said, “Well, yeah!  Why wouldn’t you?  They’re freaking addicting.”  Husband seal of approval!!

These cookies were a big hit with my husband and father. Chocolate chip are forte, but out meal cookies went over like the moon. Thank for the recipe. To make them chewy, I lowered the temperature by 10 degrees and cooked them 3 extra minutes. Fabulous

Not even a one star for this mess, I was fighting the flu so I wanted an easy to mix and bake cookie to have. I started out looking at this thinking it had an awful lot of dry Ingredients..My first mistake when I tried to mix with a hand mixer, got caught up in the blades and threw around the counter, I already had such an expense on ingredients that I continued on..Could not blend finally tried to mix the rest by hand..I was so ill by the time I finished this, I had to go lie down..Please find another recipe this is just the most expensive nightmare I have had in all of my 40 years of baking. When I finished they would not let me submit without a star, so I had to put a star on thisl

Just base recipe. I enjoyed  the cookies as well as my family. They where sweet enough without adding  the top sugar, and I used dried cranberries instead of raisins. I also added in honey and almonds. Moist, soft, and easy to make!

Halving the recipe made 15 - 18 cookies.
I left out the cinnamon and put 1.5x the vanilla in.
The cookie dough was delectable, although the cookies were amazing as well.

Hard as rocks mnot airy.  Don't like soft eother but these beyond little crisp.   Think need be handful size as normal.   Also more sweet & bitter than buttery.  Lost mothers recipe when her book taken trying find again.

Hubby is VERY picky about oatmeal cookies as it is his favorite. I got two thumbs up from him and the three kids! I beat the butter, sugars and eggs for 5 mins till they were really fluffy, and cooked them for 9 mins rotating and switching racks half way through. DO NOT OVER BAKE and remove from hot tray right away. Crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle. YUM!!!

This recipe is very easy to make with all easily available ingredients. I added less sugar as my family likes it that way. Also I didn't dip fork in sugar.  May be next time I will add a bit less oats as it was bit too chewy.

Wow these were great cookies! FYI the temperature needs to be pretty precise, I accidentally preheated my oven to 675 degrees and they came out a little dark.

it's a beautiful recipe I followed exactly everything and the cookies were tasty but adding 2 cubs of sugar is to much and made it very sweet, next time I will add 1/2 cub of brown sugar only.

Delicious.  Made half with raisins.  Half without.  Will add nuts or dried cranberries next time.   Dough was wrapped in wax paper and refrigerated overnight due to time constraint.  Worked great!

Great recipe! Can't keep them for long though as everyone gobbled them up (even had them hidden)! 
Followed directions except pared down on sugar and didn't press down. Definitely a keeper!

I'm not an experienced baker so it's possible I did something wrong but I was disappointed. For the record, I used old-fashioned oats instead of instant oats. I found that it tasted kind of weird and too sweet at the same time. Maybe too much salt, I'm not sure.

I skip the roll into a ball and the fork in sugar thing. I have made with chocolate chips and dried cranberries, raisins and walnuts but the best response is to dried apricot and walnut. I have been asked for the recipe a lot!

I reduce the cinnamon to 1 tsp and add a bag of Cinnamon Baking Chips, always a crowd pleasure.

Be aware that these are not like most cookies - if you push them to test for doneness, if they spring back to the touch they are overcooked. They'll be a crispier but still very tasty cookie, but when you press them you want them to give a little when touched to get a soft chewy consistency.

These are nice though pretty ordinary cookies.  I reduced the recipe to 12, as I didn't want alot leftover (made them for Bible study) to avoid tempting myself.  It still made 24. I formed the dough into golf ball size balls, then flattened with palm of my hand.  I didn't chill the dough, though I did add cranberries.

I used this recipe to make cannabis butter oatmeal cookies and they were better than other recipes I'd tried previously.  I use cannabis for pain control and it's legal in my state.

I usually add a banana to oatmeal cookies, as it helps make them moist, and did here.  
I substituted 1 cup of homemade granola for a cup of the oatmeal and added walnuts and cranberries.

I felt the cooking time was too short, I cooked mine for 12 minutes. as at 10  minutes they were pale and under done.

They are tasty and more cake like that a previous recipe I made...a real addition to my 'medi--bles' or edibles made from cannabis.

Fantastic recipe! I didn't change much , just added raisins and cut the oats by half a cup (I wanted to be sure they were soft cookies)
I didn't have time to chill the dough so I just did drop cookies and they turned out fantastic! Mine were thicker so they needed 10 mins to cook. 
Will make this again and again !!

I was really looking forward to these new soft cookies.   I mixed together all ingredients  exactly as listed on recipe. When I got them out of the oven I could  hardly wait for them to cool down to taste how good they were. And they tasted sooo good.
I placed them in a ziplock to keep them nice and soft.
Next day I asked my husband how were his cookies and coffee, he replied they were hard . Them I got myself one and it tasted good but was really hard. So no more soft cookies with this recipe. I give it a thumbs down.

Wonderful cookie! Perfect for making oatmeal cookie sandwiches which I did as you can see in my posted photo. For the filling I took 1 stick butter and 1/2 cup of vegetable oil cream together for 10 minutes in a stand mixer till it looks fluffy then add 3 cups sifted confectioners sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla. When it’s done I put it in a gallon zipper lock bag and cut the corner and pipe onto cookie and sandwich them together!

These cookies are known as "THE COOKIES" in my office, a few changes I have made is I use dark brown sugar with semi sweet chocolate chips and when I put them in the container I put in a few pieces of bread (look up cookie osmosis for the explanation) it makes a huge difference in the softness!

Best oatmeal cookies ever, thanks for sharing! I reduced both sugars by a third and the cinnamon by a quarter, just personal preference. The only tip I can suggest is to use a pizza stone for baking. Cookies are much more moist and evenly baked. Try it, you'll never use a cookie sheet again.

These were probably the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had. They were soft and chewy and exactly what I was looking for. Plus I got loads of compliments on them. I will be making this one of my go to cookie recipes for sure!

Love how these are crisp to the tooth but soft on the inside! I added raisins and almond slivers (because I didn't have walnuts). They turned out fantastic! Can't wait to share them!

Pretty good. Used shortening and baked at 350 instead until it was done. I thought  the sugar topping was a nice touch.  :-)

Cookies tasted great, but sort of thinned out in the oven. They were more crunchy than chewy. I added chocolate chips to the recipe and they turned out good.

Very good cookie I added 1c raisins, used splenda in place of whire sugar and added  a pack of pumpkin spice chips (toll house seasonal). 9 min was right for my oven and there was very little or no spread.

Mine turned out a little dry.  That may have been due to my almost 4 year old helping me measure.   They are still VERY edible.  I was just looking forward to the moistness I was reading about in the other reviews.

Loved it! We added raisins and used regular (not quick) oats. Didn't flatten them at all, and they're perfectly moist.

Between batches, I nudged up the temperature a bit. In my photo, you'll see the first batch is a bit pale and the second batch is golden. No preference between the two batches - just nice to have variety.

This is a good basic recipe.   There wasn't much payoff for all the work of rolling and dipping the fork in sugar.  After one sheet of that I just scooped them onto the cookie sheet.  I had been hoping for something a to make a "stand out" cookie based on the number of reviews this had.

This recipe is great!. Just made a few changes - Unsalted Butter!, 3/4 Teaspoon Cream of Tartar, White Chocolate , Almond Flakes, Regular oats in lieu of quick
Don't add sugar when pressing flat  and 8 - 9(Max) mins
Add flour mixture using Strainer/Sifter
This makes it the best thing I ever ate in my life.
I also use chocolate chunks and walnuts in lieu of white & almonds.

I've made this recipe 5 or 6 times over the last 4 months.  My kids love them because they're soft.  I've added chocolate chips and peanuts to this recipe with great results. My only complaint is that the recipe is a little salty so I cut that out.

A delicious recipe. I made these with mini Gharadelli chocolate chips, pecans and raisins, or combinations thereof, and then made them into Ice Cream Sandwiches, using vanilla or chocolate chip ice cream. They were thoroughly enjoyed by all! Thank you!

These were good. I mostly followed the recipe but used a few of my tricks for keeping cookies soft. First use half butter and half Crisco butter sticks. Second add 2Tbs of honey with the eggs. Lastly don't over mix after adding the eggs just beat till blended. I did add a cup of large golden raisins. I just dropped by rounded teaspoon onto sheet. No chilling or rolling or flattening. Baked them at 350 for 10 min. Definitely let them rest (finish cooking) on baking sheet for 5 min.  These were plump, chewy and didn't last long!

This recipe turned out amazing. But I did change it up just a little bit because I had some fresh dried cherries from our tree that I wanted to try instead of raisins. So I froze the dried cherries and then put them in the blender to junk them up smaller and replace the raisins with cherries. And also I added about a half a teaspoon of raspberry flavoring to the cookie batter. And I even added about 5 semi sweet chocolate chips to some of the cookies for those chocolate lovers. They were a huge hit! The key with using dried fruit, is you really do need to refrigerate the batter because the fruit has so much extra moisture in it.

Tastes great when you add a melted marshmallow blob to the top of a cookie. Microwave marshmallows on high for 30 seconds with walls of container at least 3 inches high. (Marshmallows will rise). 2-4 cookies: half cup worth of melted marshmallow with half teaspoon of margarine.(Microwave margarine). 4-10 cookies: 2 cups worth of melted marshmallow with 1teaspoons of margarine. 10-15 cookies: 3 cups worth of melted marshmallow and 2 teaspoons of margarine. I LOVE THESE COOKIES!!!

This is a GREAT recipe, and I can't wait to mess around with it by adding nuts, chocolate, etc. I used a packet of vanilla sugar instead of vanilla extract, the.

Delicious cookies! Slightly crisp on outside, chewy in the middle. I'll make again. Mine came out on thin side FYI which wasn't an issue for me, but just thought I'd note these didn't come out as thick cookies like some do.

I followed this recipe exactly (except I omitted the vanilla because I didnt have any) and the cookies turned out great. Perfect soft buttery taste with a slightly crunchy outside and soft inside. My only tip is you should modify the baking time per each batch and check on the cookies a little before they are done. The first batch could take longer than the second and vise versa. This helped me get perfect cookies each round. For healthier people out there these cookies are also great with buckwheat flower.

Best soft oatmeal cookies I have ever made , We love them and this will now and forever be my recipe.  The only thing I didn't do was smooch with the fork or chill  before baking. 8 minutes baking was perfect

Best oatmeal cookie recipe ever!  I make big oatmeal cookies because that's what my family likes.  Baked a little longer.  I just added some raisins and we were good to go.  Made a double batch because I knew these were going to be good and I was right.  Awesome and will definitely make again!

These were very good! I would suggests a little less salt. I used unsalted butter and regular table salt, but still got some crunchy/salty spots in the finished product. Plump your raisins/dried fruit in some hot water for 5 minutes before adding to the dough. I added cranberries, a raisin tri-medley mix, and chopped pecans. Cooked for 8 mins only to keep soft.

I followed the recipe with the addition of 1/2 c chopped walnuts and Old Fashioned Oats verses Quick Oats. After reading the reviews I decided not to refrigerate and I flattened the balls with no sugar. The cookies spread out losing their shape. The second batch I refrigerated for an hour and rolled into balls. This time they were perfect. I live at a high altitude of 7400 ft and wondered if that had an affect. I baked them for 9 min. Delish! A keeper.

Cookies are kinda bland and a little too fluffy for my liking. I like a sweeter crunchy cookie. I'm sure people who enjoy milder sweets will enjoy this but I'm not really a fan of this one. Maybe with some adjustments you can improve on it but you're proabably better off using a different recipe. I think Quaker has one.

I loved it! most years we go to the homeless shelter at Christmas and I always bring these because they are hearty and delicious.  But I usually put in 2 cups of brown sugar instead of 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar. It is much better! by the way Elle, maybe put in chocolate chips instead of raisins, if you can eat them.

These cookies were just ok to me. I substituted honey granules for brown sugar, which may have been why the cookies browned too much on the bottom. The next batch, I turned down to 350. Still browned too much on the bottom, but was better. Since I substituted I gave a 4 star instead of 3. I think they would've been a bit better with the brown sugar.

Excellent recipe. Every flavor is balanced perfectly. I creamed the cold butter until it was fluffy (about 10 minutes), then added the sugar and let it beat another five minutes - scraping the bowl periodically. Added the eggs at high speed one at a time and then turned the mixer way down to add dry ingredients. As soon as they were combined I stopped the mixer and folded it the rest of the way by hand. Chilled, scooped, and baked. So light, yet so moist. Lovely cookie.

These oatmeal cookies are amazing and moist! I added raisins and only put a pinch of salt as one teaspoon seems like too much. I also did not flatten my cookies (especially with more sugar) these are perfectly sweet enough!  Favorite recipe.

Okay, so I followed the recipe the first time and the cookies were a tad dry and a bit too sweet (and I'm pregnant and I love sweet things!), so today I tried again and changed a few things. 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar and a dash more cinnamon. To help with the dryness I used Self rising flour and didnt flatten them, and took them out a couple minutes earlier. I've eaten half a dozen of these already today. So yummy!

Following the recipe exactly as it is  it does not resemble anything close to cookie dough  so after much alteration Imanaged to save that mess and turn it into something other than a biscuit for a dog.

Could use a little less sugar especially when mixing chocolates into the batter or topping with some, but otherwise, it's soft, chewy, and so good!

Wow, I read several recipes and lots of reviews and I switched
The surger measures to 1 3/4 c. brown sugar  and 1/2 c. Reg. Surger. I added a 1/2 tsp of baking powder and lastly added 1 c. Golden  raisins , 1c. Semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1/2 c. Milk chocolate chips. I made a 3 inch cookie  so it needed 2 to 2 1/2 minutes longer. It was incredible and we served them warm with vanilla ice cream. Wow! With this taste combination it could fund raise.

These are the most delicious oatmeal cookies! Mine are a combination of chewy with crisp edges- perfection. I cut recipe in half and it made 18 medium sized cookies. I also used sea salt instead of regular salt. I can taste bits (not a lot) of the salt between bites- great combination of sweet/salt.  Lastly, I used baking parchment paper instead of adding oil to the baking sheet. I will make These again as the ingredients are simple and always on hand.

These cookies were perfect. I doubled the recipe and made it exactly as written. Every time I took  them out of the oven they were gone in 2 seconds. Follow the recipe exactly and you won't be disappointed one bit.  Have them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and you are all set. Enjoy!!!!!!!

I've made this recipe 3 times now, and my kids and husband love these cookies. I did cut back on the cinnamon (used 1 tsp) and salt (used 1/2 tsp). Also, 375 is too hot for my new electric oven. If I bake them at that temp they spread out more than I'd like, and get more done than we prefer. Instead I bake them at 360 and they turn out perfectly. I added chocolate chips to half the dough last time and the kids fought over them!

Very good, moist and chewy. I put the butter and sugars in bowl and had my son add the eggs while I got the rest of the ingredients ready. We added craisins to the mix as we enjoy the tang. Another reviewer said this is a dry recipe but I didn't find that to be true. I left the cookies in a ball as I scooped them out, put on a round cookie sheet (actually the pizza pan) and cooked them 9 minutes in a toaster oven on the convection setting. Perfect!!

I changed this up a wee bit by cutting the butter in half and replacing half with peanut butter.  I also added butterscotch chips along with walnuts and raisins.  Delicious.  Can't stop munching on them and it looks like they will have a long shelf-life if stored properly or not devoured first.

This recipe is my new favourite.  The cookies hold their shape and are crunchy on the outside and moist in the middle.  Second time I made them I added sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds and dried cranberries and they are delicious.

Since I prefer  a chewy cookie I added 2 teaspoons of regular
corn syrup.  The corn syrup keeps its properties right through baking so the cookies do not get crisp.

I am an avid baker and regularly look at this site for new recipes.  I've been craving oatmeal raisin cookies so I scoured until I found this one.  
The recipe is very easy to follow and I made only two modifications: I added a cup of raisins and didn't use a fork dipped in sugar to press them (I left them in dome shape from the cookie scoop).  
I have recipes that I've been making for over a decade and this recipe has made the cut in order to be added to my go to cookie recipes.  Friends and family are regularly fed and some people say that this is their absolute favorite!  A coworker commented that this is the best oatmeal raisin cookie he's ever had!  Thank you so much for sharing.

The second time I made this recipe I only made half of the original recipe.  I added in half a cup of chocolate chips and half a cup of walnuts.  I didn't press the cookies down, but left them in the dome shape of the 2" cookie scoop to bake for 10 minutes.  What a great hit!

I've been trying to find a recipe similar to my mother's oatmeal cookies. Due to a brain injury,  she was unable to remember quite how to make them. This is as close as I've come! I added chocolate chips, per my kids request... Yummy!

So quick to make! I thought they would spread out in the oven but they didn't, so next time I'll have to squish them down more! Next time I think I'll try adding almond extract and almond slivers!

I loved these cookies! I let the dough rest in the fridge overnight and they turned out perfectly.  I added chocolate chips to my recipe without changing anything else (except I added a tsp of caramel extract). They were super flavorful and a nice texture. My husband loves them to.

The prep time is a little misleading since you have to chill the dough for at least 1 hour prior to baking and chilling is necessary - the unchilled dough is a little too sticky to form properly. I don't really know what dipping the fork in sugar is supposed to do as only trace amounts, if any, sugar stick to the fork... The spacing is important! The cookies will spread out a fair bit as they bake. Be sure the pan is well greased as the cookies will stick otherwise - I used a "non-stick" baking sheet AND greased it and it still took a fair bit of effort to get the cookies off the pan although that may have been due to leaving them to cool far longer than the five minutes before attempting to remove them. 

Other than that, this is a fabulous recipe. The cookies come out nice and chewy with just a hint of cinnamon. Not too sweet either. I will definitely make these again and again!

EDIT: I made these again and this time I didn't bother chilling the dough, I simply dropped it by the spoonful. I also added 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Dropping the dough worked just as well as the chilled balls with far less time and effort. The chocolate chips made for an interesting contrast to the sweet cookie.

Really good. I didn't flatten the first batch and they took 2x longer to cook. I used a 1.5 inch cookie scoop and it got me almost 50 cookies.  Cooked mine for 13 minutes because like my cookies not so soft. great recipe. will bake again

Followed the recipe but instead of traditional oatmeal , I used Instant Oatmeal with banana and cream. They came out so soft, chewy and so addicting. My kids loved the cookies so much that they wanted me to pack them  with their school lunch.

I made it this weekend and it was good! I followed the recipe and enhanced it by adding choco chips to my batter and cashew nuts to my next batch. It came out perfect in shape and really chewy! Thanks for the recipe!

Well I did not follow the recipe exactly. The vanilla extract was not enough so I tripled it. I also tripled the cinnamon. Actually the cinnamon just fell faster than I could control. Then I added raisins. It made some really good cookies. These were probably the best oat meal raisin cookies I had ever had. I finally could taste the vanilla and cinnamon.

These were soft and moist as promised. Loved them. 

Warning for first timers: these really swelled up to more than double the size when put in the oven; better ensure significant distance between them when you put them in.

So these turned out great. But during the process of making the batter I wanna remind anybody who is going to make this to not forget to add the butter. I did and thankfully added some before I cooked these. I'm reminding you because it doesn't tell you to add the butter in the directions.

I used 1 egg and substituted the second egg with a 4 oz chunky applesauce cup.  I did not use the fork to flatten, I just used my fruit ball scooper like I normally do.

This oatmeal cookie recipe is definitely a keeper! Great taste and texture! I added raisins. Next time I will try a half batch with dried cranberries and the other half with chocolate chips, as more than one previous reviewer tried successfully. I also benefitted from another reviewer's comment that these cookies are done when the edges are golden brown, and the centers look doughy. That tip me tremendously to get them cooked just right. You can't go wrong with this recipe.

These turned out great! They were a little flat but kept their soft texture. I added some semi sweet chocolate chips for a little something extra and it worked out nicely. One suggestion I would have is to take them out while they still look a little underdone (just barely start to have a golden brown edge) because they continue to cook on the cookie sheet; that way it keeps their soft, moistness.

First time making these and they turned out good. Dough does need to be chilled it is too sticky otherwise. The only thing I would do is only add 1 tsp. cinnamon. They tasted great just a lil bit to much cinnamon with 1 1/2 tsp.

My favorite! Mine baked for about 9 mins. I added some chocolate chips and I didn't flatten mine out, and they were perfect. Three days later they are still nice and chewy. Will definitely make these again.

I signed up to bake oatmeal cookies to give away. I thought my family & myself would be less likely to keep eating them. 
Boy was I wrong!! These are irresistible. 
The only changes are changes I make to almost all of my cookies that I accidentally discovered one day that I was running low on ingredients for chocolate chip cookies. It turned into a very happy accident.
I sub half the flour with all purpose whole wheat flour and instead of vanilla extract I sub half of it with maple extract and half with almond extract (I don't even buy vanilla anymore)

Was not impressed by these cookies, super disappointing considering the overall rating. I followed the directions exactly except I did split the dough and did half plain and half with raisins and didn't press them down because I wanted a soft cookie. While the cookies were soft, they were also super boring. The oatmeal cookies from Costco are way better

I liked these but I have to say due to health issues I had to substitute the white flour with my organic whole wheat and I used only the brown sugar instead of any white. I also added raisins and a little molasses to keep them chewy. People loved them so much I had to make more so some could have care packages for some to take home.

I made these today, they are awesome. I did as a couple people suggested, I didn't flatten then, dropped by spoonfuls. I got a moist, soft, chewy cookie. I did add raisins cause I like them in oatmeal cookies. I was very impressed with this recipe.

What a great, basic recipe for adapting. First of all, I easily cut this in half for the two of us and it made a large platter full.  I used coconut palm sugarin place of brown sugar and a gluten-free flour blend. I baked it a bit lower at 360. Added dried cranberries and pecan pieces. Perfect and delicious.

Very good recipe. I added 1/2 cup butterscotch chips and 1/2 cup white chocolate chips and subbed pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon.   I baked golf ball sized dough for ten minutes and transferred to a cooling rack after cooling on the sheet for ten minutes.  Yum!

This is a very easy and delicious oatmeal cookie recipe.  I did not chill beforehand as the recipe mentioned but my house was a chilly 65ish.  I divided the recipe in half to do a test trial of the recipe but made the following modifications.  I doubled the vanilla, 1/4 tsp. additional cinnamon and a 1/16 tsp. extra baking soda.  I rolled into small walnut sized balls and flattened with a fork.  I did not use the sugared fork or rolled in sugar part.  I cooked them in a toaster over 350° for five to six minutes.  They were chewy and as moist as an oatmeal cookie could be and everyone in my house loved them!

Easy to make turned out great. The only thing I changed was dropping temperature to 350° and baked 10 minutes.  I made smaller cookies so I had to make the temperature and t I me adjustments.

This recipe has too much sugar, the cookies were too sweet.  I didnt even add the sugar fork at the end.  Next time i make these, im gunna cut the sugar by half.  I would also add PB chips and chopped walnuts. The cookies could also be cooked for 10-14 minutes, instead of 8-10 minutes.

Excellent oatmeal cookie! Followed the recipe exactly and added raisins. Followed the suggestion of soaking my raisins the night before I prepared them only I used bourbon instead of water and the results were incredible!!! I had a cookie that was slightly crisp on the outside but moist and chewy on the inside with a hint of bourbon aftertaste. Best darn oatmeal raisin cookie EVER!! This recipe is a definitely a keeper.

Amazing :)
I used 2 cups of instant maple brown sugar oatmeal.
Put all the dry ingredients in a separate bowl and gave the mixture a quick whisk, add the dry mixture a bit at a time to the wet while stirring.
You don't have to roll in balls just drop by tsp they will form perfectly :)

I made this exactly as written except that I added 2 cups of dried cranberries...DELICIOUS!  Soft in the middle with a very slight crisp at the edges.  I also took them out at exactly 8 minutes.  My new go-to easy cookie recipe!

I have a very picky husband when it comes to oatmeal cookies and he absolutely loves this recipe! No need for the extra in the fork sugar however, the cookies are plenty sweet without it. I typically cook them 8 minutes to keep them a bit softer.

I didn't have brown sugar so I Used a little dark karo syrup and added more cinnamon. They were a good texture but I needed to cook them at 350 for about 12 minutes. Very tasty!

Made these and followed suggestion of top rated comment - did not flatten them with a fork and they came out perfectly moist. I also divided my dough into 3 batches and added semi sweet choc chips to first, shredded coconut to second and raisins to third. They were all delicious! I didn't bother to chill the dough because I made them at midnight, and it did not seem to affect the outcome at all.

My family absolutely loved this recipe! The only thing I did differently was I did not dip the fork in sugar, and I did not press them down flat. The result was a VERY flavorful moist cookie! Definitely making these again. Thanks!

Simple, delicious, soft cookies. This is my first time making oatmeal cookies and I count it as a total win. I did not press the cookies with the fork, so I think that's what keeps them moist and soft.

I made this recipe and liked it! I used vegan butter. I also split the dough in half. Raisins in one half and dairy free mini chocolate chips in the other half. I added a dash of nutmeg and ground cloves to the raisin half. I also did not flatten with a fork. I cooked for about 10 minutes.

Not moist but soft. I loved this recipe. I made 2 parts, one just as the recipe and one with chocolate chips and marshmallows. Although i accidentally put half the dosages for vanilla, soda and salt they were still amazing.
I used 2 cups brown sugar instead of 1 brown and 1 white.

The marshmallows melted quickly so that part came out with weird shapes so if you want the marshmallow flavor maybe is better is you use marshmallow creme.

Thank you for sharing :)

I loaned my hand mixer to a friend so I made these with only a wooden spoon, it was so worth it.
I modified the recipe by using slightly less white sugar and my 5 cups of flour + oats was comprised of steel cut oats, white AP flour, ground flax, ground chia and red bran. 
I did chill, roll and pat down the dough and baked them for the entire 10 minutes.
The result is a chewy, sweet, moist cookie with so much flavour and good texture! This has become a favourite instantly.

I added chocolate chips and raisins to the recipe, about 1/2 cup of each.  I didn't chill the dough, and instead of rolling it out, I rolled it into balls and flattened with my fingers to about 1/4"  thick. The cookies turned out very well, light and slightly chewy. Please note that I did cut the cook time down to about 8 minutes, taking them out of the oven when the bottoms started to brown.

So, I have to be honest....oatmeal cookies are my least favorite cookie, but my co-workers love oatmeal raisin cookies, so I thought I would try these out.  I did add 1 cup of raisins as suggested. I tried half a cookie as a taste test and the cookie was very moist and buttery.  So, not bad for my least favorite. However, these were devoured at work!!!  People were grabbing three at a time, so I had to give these 5 stars. I did notice that 1 cup of raisins didn't seem to be enough.

I made these cookies yesterday and I am surprised that there are any left in the house! My husband and I agree - these are without a doubt, the best oatmeal cookies we've ever tasted! I made them exactly as the recipe was written. I cooked them on the low end - only 8 minutes. They were moist and chewy with a touch of crisp. These will definitely be a go to recipe in our house!

These cookies turned out great. Only change was an addition of raisins. I used a cookie scoop and did not flatten. 10 minutes in oven produced a cookie with a slight crunch and chewy middle.

I made these as written. I found them to have too much cinnamon. If you don't like the taste of cinnamon I would use less. They also needed about 12  minutes to be finished. Not a bad recipe but mot one that I will use again.

Great base recipe!! I add in whatever I have on hand, but my favorite is white chocolate-chips , craisins ,  walnuts and shredder coconut. I roll the cookies in sugar before I  press it down with a fork. My family loves theses cookies.

There was no need to grease the cookie sheet but I did use non stick pans.   We love these cookies and will keep this recipe, but I prefer to omit the pressing with sugar mainly because I like softer cookies. Thanks! Oh, and I added raisins mmm

Our new all time favorite basic cookie recipe. It was soft and delicious. We have thought up lots of ways to add things like coconut, chocolate chips or flavorings. Can't wait to make monster cookies with it! We even had to use baking powder instead of baking soda but it still turned out wonderful! Oh, and we made them walnut sized and just somewhat smashed with our palm...they didn't spread much but cooked in perfect time! Moist and soft but the occasional crispy edges were delicious too! ??

Substituted half the butter for cream cheese. Did not flatten or put sugar on top. Used a tablespoon cookie scoop. Baked for 9 minutes. Tasted great. They did not flatten out, so stayed plump and moist. Made probably four dozen smaller cookies. Wonderful!

I made these cookies for my family they loved them!
I did not flatten with a fork & add sugar I feel like that would of been to much.  I cooked some of the cookies for 9 min and they where nice and moist. 
I cooked mine for 12 min a little longer and it gave them a nice crunch. I like crispy cookies

This recipe was great. Easy and the result was so delicious. The only reason i gave it 4 stars is because i don't think it needed that much SUGAR. I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and it turned out great. Instead i divided the dough in two and  added 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 of walnuts to one part and dates and walnuts  to the second part.  The kids loved it too :-)

My son made these cookies and they turned out well. After cookies were in the oven, I asked him if he had trouble finding my cinnamon jar. He said he didn't add cinnamon. The cookies were good anyway, and moist because he cooked them for a shorter time. Yes, I'll make again, but without the cinnamon.

This recipe is awesome! I followed the recipe exactly and added some raisins. What I did differently though (because I was too lazy) was skip the chilling, forming into balls and pressing flat with a fork. I just used an ice cream scoop and just plopped the dough right into the pan (lined with baking paper) and baked em right away. Took em out at exactly 8 mins. The cookies came out nicely fat, chewy, moist and absolutely delicious! Thanks for sharing!

Very soft and delicious cookies. The only thing I changed from the original recipe was that instead of flattening the cookies on the baking pan with a fork dipped in sugar, I made a ball for each cookie and left enough space between them. I had to leave them 12-15 minutes instead of 10, but the cookies were very soft and chewy. I also added a cup of raisins to the batter and this made them perfect. My family and I honestly loved them.

I LOVED these cookies! They weren't overly sweet, which I was concerned about. So I didn't use a sugar dipped fork to press them. But they came out of my oven soft and just sweet enough. I ate two cookies myself before they even finished cooling!!

Too salty, I used half the sugar and rice flour. If I used a quarter of the salt it would be a four.  With a couple other tweets could be a five! ??

They are very good.  My wife wants me to make them again.  This time some of them with chocolate chips and some with raisins.  I like OMC with raisins but some of the other family members like chocolate...

Also, I agree with someone who said, you don't need to press them with sugar.  This time I probably won't press them with sugar.  Also I really don't know why, but they seemed more saltier than I expected.  I'm not sure if it's because I used kosher salt or what.

I followed the recipe and added 3/4 cup of chocolate chips, and 1 cup of raisins soaked in boiling water until they were soft. Those were mixed into the dough and then the whole mixture refrigerated. 

Turned out amazing! Coworkers raved that it was "the best cookie yet!" and I'll have to try to one-up this one.

I cut the sugars to 1/2 cup each and added 1/4 cup of milk. Amazing! Good, soft and not to sweet. I didn't press them completely flat so they turned out about 3/4 inch tall- Perfect! Tastes just like the packaged oatmeal breakfast bars!

I made half the batch with raisins.  That half I put in the fridge had the raisins so the raisins could be softer.  But I only put it in for about half an hour.   Turned out perfect.  loved it.

Recipe was perfect as is. Made them again today after making them a couple of years ago in hopes of enticing my picky, not quite two year old eater... it worked! He ate a whole cookie which in our house is quite an accomplishment.

I used this recipe as a base for a harvest cookie I wanted. Followed the recipe except I only added 2 cups of oats and I used dark brown sugar,  then added a cup each of dried cranberries, raisins, chopped almonds and pumpkin seeds. I needed to cook them for the full 10 minutes to get them to done but they turned out BEAUTIFUL! I only gave it 4 stars because I didn't bake the recipe to specs but for the purpose I needed it was great. 

As a previous poster stated - it is unnecessary to smash these cookies with sugar. I simple spoon dropped them and they spread into the oatmeal cookie consistency I'm used to :) 

(If you're using salted nuts, leave the salt out of the recipe!)

Made these exactly to the recipe but added 1 cup craisins. My grandkids who normally only want me to make chocolate chip cookies were blown away by these. They honestly said they were very good but didn't  rave about them, however,  they were all eaten within about 2 days and these are very tasty,  but filling cookies. Someone gave a review saying these were dry and not moist. Never had a moist oatmeal cookie, but they are tasty and don't leave off using sugar to your fork when flattening, it adds a needed touch and don't not flatten these cookies. I tried and they are not nearly as good when not flattened, too thick and not tasty. Love this recipe and will certainly make them again and again. May vary them with nuts and plain raisins, but craisins just seem to give them a needed tang. Great recipe, thanks.

Ok, so I made quite a few revisions but this recipe is a solid one to follow.  
*First revision: replaced amber honey for white sugar 
*Second revision: I didn't have plain rolled oats on hand (due to previously making my own oatmeal mix).  I used this mix and had no clue how everything would turn out. I WILL USE AGAIN - everything was amazing. I used scoops of oats that included chia seeds, flax seeds, shaved coconut, and shaved almonds. 
*Third revision: I did not dip fork in sugar.... Just rolled with my hands and flattened. 
These have been out of the oven for 8 minutes and my boyfriend has already eaten 4.... He's a cookie connoisseur... This is a keeper!
I'm thinking of putting in apple sauce next time to make it a little healthier.

So I was looking for a oatmeal cookie recipe because my taste buds have been screaming for them.  I came across this one on YouTube and decided to give it a try.  I always believe in following a recipe exactly as posted 1st to gauge if I need to tweak it to my liking. This one needs no tweaking at all. I added raisins, cranberries, walnuts and pecans and let me tell you. This is now my go to recipe period!

I followed the recipe with the addition of half a bag of semi sweet chocolate chips, refrigerated for an hour, baked 8 minutes, allowed to cool, and these cookies are good. Enjoyed making them with my niece. We will make these again.

I've actually been using this recipe for a couple of years now. I follow it exactly. (Every once in awhile I'll add a dash of nutmeg especially in the fall and winter seasons) It is absolutely delicious!

Very good recipe, I just halved the recipe (since it's just the two of us)  and added 1/2 cup of raisins and 1/2 cup of walnuts.  Cooking time was perfect at 9 minutes. And as other reviewers mentioned, it is not necessary to put added sugar on and mush them down. Just form small balls, they will turn out moist and yummy!

Holy smokes, these are seriously probably the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had. The only thing I changed was I added about a cup 1/2 of raisins. SO GOOD!

Nice, chewy cookies. I added 1 tsp corn starch to the dry ingredients to maintain the chewy structure of the cookie. I also reduced the sugar content to 3/4 cup of each sugar, which made them plenty sweet. I added about a cup and a quarter of miscellaneous dried fruit.

Good basic oatmeal cookie, cooked well, added some raisins and they did well.  Lost one star for being just a touch bland.

These cookies are Awsome! I was going to make a double batch cause I was sure the recipe wasnt going to make enough to last for a while, but the recipe made 24 big cookies and they were very soft and perfect amount of cinnimon! I starred this recipe and will use it for the remainder of my oatmeal cookie desires. You can add chocolate chips too instead of raisins.

I loved the recipe as is. I added a cup of raisins that I had soaked in water for an hour to keep them plump. Even my hubby Who is not a fan of oatmeal raisin cookies gobbled these up. They came out super soft and moist :-)

They were awesome! I thought they were very moist, with only the ingredients that were in the recipe. And also, in my opinion, they were better pressed down, just not totally flat. And instead of using a big sugar covered fork to press them down, I pressed them with my hands, then sprinted sugar on top. But I loved the cookies! I made them with my 7 year old cousin and everyone loved them too.

I added raisins to half the mixture & choc chips to the other half. Oatmeal Raisin were AWESOME! Something about it just works. I didn't care for the oatmeal choc chip, rather have reg chic chip cookies. Only issue I had was the bake time/size. In the 1st batch I guess my "walnut-sized balls" were too big I had to put them back in for another 5min. Once I made them smaller, I baked for 11min, left on cookie sheet for five min before removing to wire rack. Plus side, I yielded way more cookies!

I rarely ever have cookies turn out well, especially living in Cambodia with a crappy oven and where my ingredients melt in 5 seconds, but I've made these several times and have always had them turn out perfectly!!!

I just roll them into balls and don't flatten them, they flatten fine as they cook and are so soft if you leave them in ball form.

Great recipe. Made perfect cookies. I followed the advice of another reviewer and divided the batch into two, added raisins to one and dried cranberries to the other. Also I didn't flatten the cookies, they turned out soft and chewy. Thanks for a delicious staple recipe.

This recipe is easy, my 7 year old granddaughter made them with prompting and help. She has been cooking with me since she was 3. It's our fun and learning play. I loved the simplicity of this recipe and the cookies are yummy. Not too sweet. We did cut the recipe in half. My cookies were nice and chewy.  Thanks again Allrecipes for a tried and good recipe.

Awesome recipe! I used it as a base and added dried apricots, cranberries, raisins, pumpkin seeds and walnuts with just a bit of coconut. Honestly it is now my favourite. I didn't use a sugared fork to flatten the balls though, just my fingers. So yummy :)

I love this recipe.  I follow the recipe as is, except I don't flatten them out or add extra sugar.  Occasionally, I'll add sultanas or throw in a ripe banana if I have one on the counter that needs used up.

I used pumpkin pie spice ( plus extra for more flavor) as I was out of cinnamon. Cookies were really tasty. I also added soaked raisins as I like raisins in my oatmeal cookies.

this recipe is the bomb! i added chocolate chips to make oatmeal chocolate chip cookies!
everyone who got a bite loved it and wanted me to make some more!

i adjusted the recipe so that it would make 12 servings

i added 3/4 tablespoon (yes, tbsp) of vanilla flavoring since it's not extract and  added 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon instead of 3/4 teaspoon.

i also just bake a few pieces (depending on how many i'd like to eat) and chilled the rest of the dough until i crave for some more.

again, THESE WERE THE BOMB!
BEST OATMEAL COOKIE RECIPE EVER!

I made them just as the recipe said and they turned out great.
I had to put some in the freezer just so my husband wouldn't finish them the same day!
Will definitely make them again!

It was the first time ever i baked anything. I have been wishing to bake these cookies since long and this weekend I took my first step with the recipe listed here. The ingredients were very easy to gather, and the steps equally easy to follow. It turned out to be great and since then all my family and friends have had to put up with my bragging about how great a baker I am :)

The only thing I would like to change is - sugar. I understand everyone has their taste, but personally I take less sugar, so I would go easy on it the next time - maybe only 1 cup. Apart from that, great recipe and very quick and easy!

My whole family loves these hearty flavorful cookies.  I did add raisins and craisins to a second batch~YUM!  I also used as much organic ingredients as possible.  No more store bought cookies for us??

Very moist & chewy. Added 1 cup raisins. Maybe add more cinnamon next time. These cookies EXPAND into each other, even after spacing 2 inches apart, so using a couple bigger baking sheets may be helpful. Got 2 dozen cookies altogether from this batch. Bf loved em & said he'll dip em in his coffee.

OK, I'm not a fan of oatmeal unless it's in a bowl with some milk, butter and sugar. But I made these to take to work as something a bit healthier than the cupcakes that sit beside on the plate. I made it according to the recipe overall. I melted the butter in a pan because I didn't leave it out all day to soften. I also realized that I was pretty close to being out of brown sugar so I found some hard chunks under the counter and jammed them into the grinder and made brown sugar powder. I think I came up with about 3/4 c of that instead of the full cup. I think everything else was pretty much the same except I had no time (read too lazy) for cookies so I buttered up a 9X13ish baking pan and pressed the mixture into that to make bars. Oh, that reminds me that it was  an incredibly dry mixture so I splashed some milk into there. I can't tell you how long I cooked them because I was also cooking two batches of cupcakes and one thing was in, one was out... I waited until they were getting brown around the edges (it started to pull away from the edge a bit) and pulled them out. They seemed moist in the middle but  my gut told me to pull. Now that they've cooled. they're cooked in the centre. My daughter says they're great. She eats most everything, though.

Really great! Super tasty. Turned out soft and yummy, 8-10 minutes is the perfect time for these. Makes a LOT of cookies! Fed a huge hungry bunch, if you only have two or three people to feed I'd recommend halving it.

I like the way these cookies turned out.  I made half the recipe and it either makes really big cookies or half the recipe makes more than 12 cookies.  (I opted for the really big cookies.)  They took about 13 to 14 minutes to bake (because they were large), but they were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I will make these again.

These are awesome! I did cut the white sugar down to 3/4 cup and might do 1/2 cup next time as I put other sweet things in my mix. I used quick cook steel cut oats to give it more of a nutty texture and I only put in 2 cups of oats and then I substitute the remaining cup for 1/2 cup mini chocolate morsels and 1/2 cup toffee bits. Super yummy! Also no need to refrigerate the dough and I had to bake for about 12-13 minutes so just keep an eye on your cookies to see how they are baking.

Delicious the first time! The second time I used whole wheat flour, added 1/4 c flax seed, 1/2 c raisins and 1/2 c chocolate chips. I also didn't roll the dough into balls or flatten, made as a drop cookie. These are delicious!

I must say this is my new favorite recipe for Oatmeal (Raisin) Cookie ever. My family and grandchildren love them. I will suggest a few things only for helping others and not critizing this recipe at all. I used cinnamon sugar in place of just cinnamon, I also added 2 cups of raisins and that is plenty for this recipe. I do not use the sugar or fork I just . I use a measurement spoon (1 Tbl spoon) to scoop out my dough and make balls and they come out well round and moist. Hope this may help. Enjoy

I have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised on how well they turned out.                                    I substituted the butter for coconut oil (cold press)  but it is a great combination of favours.     I was a bit worried when I took the dough out of the fridge and tried to make the balls. It was very crumbly and wouldn't stay together. With the heat from my hands it warmed up a bit and they were ok.

Excellent. I only had regular, not quick, oats at home which I think makes them a little less moist. I skip dipping the fork in sugar. Make them all the time now.

Decent cookie but I had to lower cooking temp to 350 and the were more chewy than I really like. I won't be using this recipe again but I liked the tip someone shared to add cloves. Tasty! All in all, I prefer a different recipe for a better textured & more appealing cookie.

I will definitely make these again.  To make them a bit healthier, I used whole wheat flour and 2 cups of brown sugar eliminating the white completely.  I also grated in some nutmeg and added a cup of semi sweet chocolate chips.  I baked them for 8 minutes and they turned our perfect.  The recipe makes a lot, so I divided the dough, using the first half right away to bring to a family dinner, and the other half I refrigerated.  The cookies were a huge hit, but I found the oats felt a bit under cooked (tough), even though I used the quick cooking oats as is described.  They were a huge hit anyway, and I left what was left to our neighbours.  The next day I made the rest, and what a difference!  After refrigerating the dough for a day, the oats were perfect, and the cookies more flavourful.  So if you can, DO refrigerate them as recommended.  They are so much better!

These cookies are delicious! Very moist and flavorful! Being a vegan, I adjusted the recipe using:
Gluten free brown rice flower
Dark brown sugar
Agave syrup
Nutmeg 
Paprika 
No eggs 
Coconut oil 

These turned out very well! Very delicious!

This is a great recipe, although I made a few changes to my liking. I added about a cup or so of raisins, and instead of 1.5 teaspoons of cinnamon, I did 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and 0.5 teaspoon nutmeg which gave the cookies a more spiced flavour. 

Also, I didn't flatten the cookies, and only cooked them for about 6-7 mins. when it comes out of the oven it may seem really soft and undercooked, but when it cools, the texture is perfect!

Best. Cookies. Ever!  The only change I made was to reduce the amount of cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon.

I like " stuff" in my cookies so I added pecans, dried cranberries, white chocolate chips and a pinch of coconut".    I love that they are a little crispy on the outside but soft and chewy inside.   My family  and my neighbors are going to love them.

Followed the recipe exactly except skipped the fridge. Still turned out great. I didn't press the cookie dough down before baking and kept them in he oven for 10 minutes. This kept them perfectly moist. Great cookies!

These are very tasty. I made exactly according to the recipe. The first batch came out tasty but crispy. The second batch I turned down to 350 degrees and baked for about 12 minutes-much better. Could be something with my oven, but 350 worked better for me with these cookies. Will make them again, too many times I'm sure! :)

Very Nice base recipe. Used it as it and added, raisins, pecans, almond slivers, pumpkin seeds, dates, ground ginger, cloves, and nutmeg. Trying for a lot of fiber and roughage. They turned out awesome. Took a while to bake; 20 min.

We love this recipe.  They are indeed soft cookies, and if anything, they're TOO good.  The only change we made was to add 1 cup of raisins, just because we were in the mood for raisin cookies.

These we're so good! I used half all-purpose, half coconut flour and the Truvia baking blend instead of plain sugar, added raisins and chopped walnuts and dusted them with sugar instead of just dipping the fork in sugar. They came out soft inside and crunchy on the edges. Perfect!

I have made these a few times but the first time I made them I messed up and put 3 cups flour and 2 cups oats. The dough was really thick. I thought what happened here and I started thinking did I switch the flour and oats? So I thought what am I going to do now ? So I added another egg. They are so good this way. I make them the wrong way now hahaha and everyone loves them

This is the first time I've made cookies from scratch, and they turned out so well! Following another reviewer's suggestion, I substituted a 1/2 teaspoon of the cinnamon for ground cloves because I adore the taste of cloves. I was too impatient to chill the dough at all, and I formed them into balls that I flattened a tiny bit with with my thumb. I made plain, raisin, and dark chocolate chip. All baked for 9 minutes, and all are deliciously soft and chewy.

This recipe did excellently above 6 thousand feet! We did not flatten the balls and they came out perfectly. I added a cup of dried cranberries, changed the quick oat measurement to 2.5 cups, and substituted the .5 cups of oats I took away for unsalted roasted pumpkin seeds. Divine.

Wow, yum! I added walnuts and raisins. Made cookie balls with a spoon and froze for later use in a freezer bag...after tasting way too much of the dough! (Not recommended due to salmonella risk from raw eggs.) Cooked from frozen @ 375 degrees for 10-11 minutes. Delicious warm. Soft, not cakey, just right.

Really good flavor! Someone recommended refrigerating the dough first, which worked well for me. The first batch spread too thin and got super crispy. They also were too thin to easily remove from the pan and broke into pieces. I refrigerated for about 10 minutes, problem solved. I also used foil instead of greasing the pan. I added dried cherries and chopped almonds to mine.

Followed this exactly and these are the WORST cookies I've ever made. There is way to much flour! 
If you're like me and prefer a chewy cookie and need to rescue this cookie dough, I added 1/4 cup of MELTED butter and then rolled each ball in white sugar. They're edible now. 
I chose this recipe in a rush, so I'll be going with another from now on.

Great cookies, super simple and enough to freeze some leftover dough  to cut and cook later.  

I saw the other reviews about them not being moist but I had no problem.  They were moist and chewy.  I made sure I refrigerated the dough for an hour and had the oven up to temperature.  I cooked them just on 8 mins

I made these cookies last night. The recipe is very easy. My cookie texture is very nice, not like your typical oatmeal cookies, these are soft and moist cookies. I had to increase my baking time to 15 minutes but that could very well be my oven. I doubled the batch and inbetween trays I kept putting the dough back into the frig because it would get a bit sticky. Overall I am really enjoying these cookies however I think they are a touch on the bland side. I think the next time I make these I am going to increase the cinnamon and brown sugar just a little to add flavor. I did add raisins to them. I think chocolate chips may even be good in this recipe. I like this very unique texture.

The recipe worked very well for me.

I found I was out of regular flour, but had   King Arthur all-purpose Gluten free flour on hand. So I substituted one cup with 1/4 teaspoon of xanthan gum. I only made half the recipe to test. Next time I will make a full batch.

Yeah, these are a keeper. I never thought of putting cinnamon in oatmeal cookies, despite that sounding like a very natural combination now that I think about it. I did not, however do the fork thing at the end (because I forgot to do it; I was in more of a rush than I was intending), but they were excellent nonetheless. Although, if I would do that, I would use cinnamon sugar (4:1 (sugar: cinnamon)) instead of just sugar and get a little more of the cinnamon taste, but not something that's overpowering.  

They were flavorful, soft and filling. I would definitely make these again. I would recommend these if you're interested in trying them. :)

My husband is not able to eat butter, so I substituted with an equal amount of Nutiva Buttery Spread Original, a coconut spread.  In order to cream it with the sugar, I ran hot water in my sink and creamed the coconut oil and sugar in a copper bowl, allowing the hot water to gradually melt the coconut oil.  I added some shredded coconut flakes and used an oatmeal combined with some nuts and dried fruits.  This was a fantastic recipe.  I did have to bake a bit longer than suggested.  My husband raved over these and had not stomach problems.

Easy to make and delicious. Didn't have white sugar so used all brown sugar, just a little less than the recipe. Added raisins and cranberries with my second batch. Don't over bake and these cookies will be soft and chewy in the middle.  Plan to make again real soon.

They are really good cookies, but when making them you need to place them more than 2" apart.  My first batched turned into a cookie cake.  LOL but it was still delicious.

A little bit salty to my partner's taste. A few deviations from the recipe: melted the butter before mixing, added 1 cup of raisins (equivalent), didn't dip my fork in sugar. Good stuff!

This is good but needs at least 1/4 cup milk or water, I still taste the flour in the cookie. I omitted the cinnamon because we don't care for it.  I only got 30 cookies.

I substituted 1/2 cup coconut oil for 1 of the sticks of butter and used 1 1/2 cups white sugar with 3 tbsp molasses., and no brown sugar.  Chopped  pecans and almonds and dried cranberries and large golden raisins.  They turned out great - moist and crunchy.

Excellent! I did NOT press on the cookies with a fork as they flatten while in heat, and they have enough sugar in them! I baked at 350 instead; my oven burns things, fast. So this setting gave them a nice golden ring around them, letting me know they were done which took about 7-10 minutes. Delicious!!!

Goodbye store bought cookies!
These cookies were delicious and husband approved!The texture was perfect and had just the right amount of moisture. I didn't do the whole fork ordeal, mostly because I skipped right over that! When I was placing the cookies on the baking sheet, I used the palm of my hand and pressed down gently. After reading other reviews, I may even change it up a bit and add cranberries, raisins, or coconut. We'll see what the future holds! Thanks for the recipe!

They were really good.  I followed the recipe perfectly and for some reason, I got 48 cookies instead of 24 (which is a bonus). They weren't as soft as I'd have liked them to be, but if I'd covered them while they were still a little warm they might have stayed softer.  Anyway, they were crunchy on the outside and a little chewy on the inside, but still very good.

Everyone who ate these cookies loved them. The best compliment was from my daughter's best friend who doesn't like oatmeal cookies. 

I refrigerated the dough and it made making the balls and clean up easier. As other reviewers suggested, I left the cookies as balls. They spread nicely and were soft and moist. 

I reduced the cinnamon to 1 tsp and added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg just because I like the combination of  the two. 

Several reviewers commented on the difficulty of adding raisins etc. after combining the wet and dry ingredients. As a result of their feedback, I added raisins, cranberries and chopped walnuts (1/2 c. of each) to the dry mixture and folded the wet into the dry. That worked out well.

I'm not generally a fan of oatmeal cookies, but these turned out really well.  I added a half cup of mocha instant cappuccino powder to the flour mixture (as well as a bag of dark chocolate chips), so it was difficult to tell when they were done.

I added one cup of mixed fruit to my cookies & they came out beautifully. Next time I would probably use less dark brown sugar as they are very sweet.
There is no need to press the cookies flat...they find there own level.

I first made these cookies exactly as stated in the recipe.  The cookies were good, but I found them a little too sweet for my taste and not quite as soft as I hoped, hence the four stars.  The second time I made them, I customized them slightly to my liking.  I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup, added a tsp. of baking powder in addition to the baking soda and used a butter flavored shortening  instead of butter (50% less saturated fat than butter, no cholesterol and it usually gives me better results).  I like larger cookies so I used a 3-Tbsp ice cream scoop to measure them onto a greased cookie sheet.  I did not press them down!  I baked them for exactly 12 minutes at 375 degrees F.  They will still be soft when removed from the oven, so be sure to let them rest on the baking sheet for 5 min. before removing to a wire rack.  The result was a moist soft cookie that melts in your mouth.  This will be my oatmeal cookie of choice from now on.  I may add raisins, dried cranberries, dates or chocolate chips next time.

This was my first time making oatmeal cookies so I was excited to give this recipe a try. The recipe was super easy and didn't take much time from start to finish. The flavor overall was good but I think the 1tsp of salt made them a bit on the salty side. Next time I will def change to 1/2 tsp. Also I cut down the amount of white sugar to 1/2 c and kept the brown sugar at 1c. I would make again with a few modifications next time around.

I made an account JUST to rate these cookies. These cookies were amazing! Instead of putting them in the fridge for an hour, I put them in the freezer for about 15-30 minutes and they were easy to drop onto the baking pan. I also did not press them down with a fork in sugar. I thought the cookies weren't going to come out as sweet as they should be because instead of using butter I ended up having to use margarine which I think is probably saltier than normal butter so I also did not use any salt, the cookies were still sweet.Next time I bake them though, I think I'm going to cut down the sugar by maybe a 1/4 cup and add in a few raisins. Otherwise, these cookies were awesome. I cut the recipe in half just to try it out but next time I think I'm going to double it. :P

This cookie recipe is so easy!!  Even better, the cookies came out great!  The only thing is I agree with people who say to not flat the cookie dough out with fork.  I also added a cup of raisins.  Made a good amount as well.  If you are looking for a quick and easy recipe, this is the one!

So I wanted oatmeal cookies ,but had no oatmeal so I substituted it with special k (just give them a quick chop so the flakes are coarse so u have about 3 1/2 cup once chopped )and fold them into dough and chilk. I also rolled  the walnut sized balls in a cinnamon sugar mixture and cook them at 350 instead. My kids kept complimenting how good the oatmeal cookies were. I of course graciously thanked them.

Yummy!  These are so good.  Added 11 oz bag of butterscotch chips.  Didn't chill for an hour - just chilled the dough on the cookie sheets while others were baking.  Also no need to grease cookie sheets or press the cookies - they spread out by themselves.

Exactly the kind of cookie I've been looking for.  Easy to mix and bake and comes out moist and chewy.  Easy to add raisins or nuts or chocolate chips.

These came out really good. Grounded the oats, used agave instead of sugar, whole wheat flour instead of all purpose and added raisins. I changed the amount for each ingredient to half. My hubby & daughter loved them!

I tripled the recipe, expecting 72 cookies.  I got 112. 

I added dried cranberries and cut up pieces of a 78% dark chocolate bar.  Chewy and delicious! I find the ones I flattened with a fork like the recipe said cooked more evenly than the batch where I forgot.

Delicious! This one is a keeper. I did not chill the dough. I made balls about Tablespoon size and didn't flatten, cooked for 10 min. They turned out nice shape and texture. I also like my oatmeal cookies a bit saltier, so I increase sea salt to 1.5 tsp and brought the cinnamon down to only 1 tsp. I also added 1 c. Chopped pecans. Soooo good. This one is going in the recipe box. Thanks!

first time making oatmeal cookies. i only inserted 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and about  1 teaspoon of cocoa powder. the cinnamon was still strong and although there was no cocoa taste, it did give a nice flavor to it :D

i chill them and bake them in batches. theres so much and you only need a small size as they really do get big. big hit among my friends :D

These turned out perfect and so moist in fact, when you picked them up, gravity became a factor.   

I doubled the recipe then split the dough in thirds. The 1st batch remained plain, I added craisins and other dried berries to the 2nd batch, and added 2 Tablespoons of peanut butter and some chopped peanuts to the 3rd batch.

Admittedly; the peanut butter batch was not nearly as moist and reminded me of store bought cookies.  They had more crunch than the other two batches, but still had excellent flavor.  Contributing factors to the crispiness of the 3rd batch may have been the oil in the peanut butter, overworking the dough, or baking them last. (I’m going to play with it)

In any case, you will still want to slightly depress the dough balls, with a fork, prior to baking.  I see no need to use a sugar-coated fork when you can achieve the same, non-stick, result by dipping the fork into warm water.

I will defiantly be making these again!

These are absolutely delicious, but too sweet for my taste. Usually I only put 1 cup of brown sugar, but today I decided to try white sugar. I put 1 cup and the cookies turned out sooooo sweet! I can't believe that originally by the recipe  you need to use 2 cups of sugar.
I recommend to use only brown sugar (1 and a half cups).

I swapped the butter for spectrum shortening, the all purpose flour for whole wheat and the quick oats for thick rolled oats. I added cranberries and pistachios. I left my dough in the fridge a while and after reading reviews only flattened the cookies a bit, the result was a cookie that was dark on the bottom and a bit wet inside, If I hadn't flattened at all it would have been burnt on the bottom and dough inside. If I make them again I will follow the recipe to flatten them. Great cookies!

This was the best tasting oatmeal cookie I have made yet. I added 1/2 cup sweetened coconut, 1 cup white chocolate chips, and 1.5 TBLSP honey.

Thelse were amazing. This is "the" oatmeal cookie recipe I've been looking for. I made the following changes: half the amount of salt,  use 1 tsp of cinnamon, didn't refrigerate the dough or roll into balls ( just used a cookie scoop) and no flattening with sugar.

These were amazing! I did half whole wheat flour / half white, and half coconut oil / half butter (mostly because I wanted to use up the whole wheat flour and coconut oil). I also used slightly less salt (just eyeballed it). They turned out great. Added raisins. Froze some dough because this made a pretty large batch, curious to see how those turn out. -- The cookies made from frozen dough turned out just as delicious!

Very delicious cookies! I did not have vanilla so i was not able to add any but even without it the flavor was not lacking what-so-ever. Letting the dough chill also made it very easy to scoop up balls with a spoon to put on the pan !

These were perfect. Exactly what I was looking for. I halved the recipe and it made 19 average cookies. Make sure to use real butter and vanilla and these will not disappoint. I cooked at 375 for 8 minutes and allowed to cool on pan for 3 more. TIP: The edges and bottoms will be brown when done, but the center may not look set. No worries. It will set while they cool. If you leave them in until the centers are set, they will be crunchy not chewy. Edit: I did not put extra sugar on top. They don't need it!

I love this recipe.  I did make the following changes that I was happy with:  I substituted half the butter for coconut oil and half the brown sugar with coconut sugar.  Coconu sugar is healthier and add just a touch of a molasses taste.  They were fabulous!  I also cooked them for 9 min. at 350 rather 375 to keep them soft.

It came out quite good! Although, once it cooled it was harder than I though it'd be and very sweet, i'd suggest reducing the amount of sugar, unless you've got a huge sweet tooth! But I am very satisfied with the outcome and everyone enjoyed it! Will be trying this with raisin and walnuts the next time I bake these!

I found this recipe when I was craving my grandma's Gum Drop Cookies and didn't have access to the original recipe. These were just what I needed. I use lemon juice instead of cinnamon. And I stir in 1-2 cups of baking gums before refrigerating. They turn out awesome every time. I've made them several times now, including the original recipe. Beware, margarine is not a good substitute in this recipe. Some varieties will ruin the texture.

Great tasting oatmeal cookies! I added raisins and substituted 1/2 cup of butter with a 1/2 cup of pumpkin puree because everyone loves pumpkin during the fall! I didn't flatten them with the fork and sugar. they are sweet enough and I love super soft cookies. the pumpkin helps with the moisture of the cookie too! mine came out with a soft chewy texture. yum!

It's a good thing I absolutely love these cookies, because the recipe produced 85 of them! I did make modifications, reducing white sugar to a half cup and using only a little over a half teaspoon of salt. I also used whole wheat flour, regular  oats  (I was a bit short of three cups), and two teaspoons each of cinnamon and vanilla. Finally I added 1/2 cup each of dried cranberries, raisins, and chopped walnuts. All that made the dough very thick, so I didn't chill it but just used a spoon to drop it as is onto baking sheets with parchment paper. As another reviewer mentioned, they flattened perfectly while baking without any intervention. They needed 14-15 minutes' baking time, no doubt because of my modifications, but they still turned out nice and chewy and looked exactly like those in the photo above. I'll definitely make them again.

These were very easy, though I did add a little less sugar, I try to keep it a little more healthy. there perfect to make if your in a rush of a last minute snack, also perfect for packed lunches. I will say that they are not very moist...not  a fan of how well they came out in texture. i will try this recipe again later, maybe its just me

These were brilliant! Lowered temp to 170 on fan oven and cooked for 10 minutes and they turned out great. I added a 'breakfast topper' mix of seeds and dried fruit and added some chocolate chips too. I'm too impatient to wait an hour for the mixture to cool in fridge so I cooked straight away and this didn't effect the bake! I also didn't dip the fork in sugar to press the cookies flat as they were sweet enough already for me! These are really great autumnal cookies:)

I used 1/2 the butter and replaced the other 1/2 with shortening. I made the dough and refrigerated it over night. I just left them in balls on the cookie sheet and baked them. The cookies were very moist and soft. I will definitely make them again!

I used the recipe adjustment feature on this website because i only wanted 6 cookies. I did have to chill the dough to let it firm up a bit. I baked one cookie to see how it would taste and it was ok, but it wasn't moist or sweet enough for me. So I added three more tablespoons of butter and a little brown sugar (not sure how much). Lastly, i decided to add some fresh strawberries to the batch and sat the dough in the refrigerator for a few minutes to let it firm up some. Within 8 to 10 minutes, I had deliciously sweet and moist strawberry oatmeal cookies!

Wow, these are some tasty cookies!  I had to substitute a Crisco Baking Stick (Butter Flavor) for the 1 cup of butter the recipe called for because I was all out of the real stuff.  I dumped a bunch of raisins and some chocolate chips into the mix  and out came some DEEELICIOUS homemade cookies.  I'm happy!  Thanks for sharing your great recipe!

Great base recipe to work with! I made with gluten free flour, coconut sugar, (only need one cup IMO), added 1/4 cup flax, and teaspoon vanilla. Made healthier for the kids with sensitivities.

Followed the recipe but added some macadamia nuts and semi-sweet chocolate chips. I used a small ladle to form the cookies in a dome shape and did not press them down. As they cooked, the cookies flattened out and came out just fine. 8 minutes with the rack near the top prevented the bottoms from burning. My first batch I made few days ago had the "burnt" bottom. Had the trap in the middle. More than 8 minutes was too much.

Waiting to cool before you remove from tray is important for sure.

I was surprised from some of the other reviews. My cookies were nice and moist, soft and chewy. Just the way I like it. May have been the chips and the distance from the element. 

Very good results. This was my first attempt at cookies. I surely won't be the last. Awesome recipe, Thanks.

These cookies are delicious and are a favourite of my husband. I change the spice a little changing it to 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 Tsp of nutmeg . I also add coconut. I also add either raisins or chocolate chips.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe

they taste amazing! However, the recipe was too sweet for me, I deducted some of the sugar but it was still too sweet. I also accidentally baked them longer than I should have and they came out crunchier on the outside ( which I have no problem with) overall great recipe and my mom really likes it!! thanks for posting.

Very convenient recipe to use up stuff I already had on hand. Would make a decent lunch box treat. I used this recipe because I had a store brand quick oats box without a printed cookie recipe!

Great recipe! The only change I make is to use Old Fashioned Rolled Oats (NOT Quick Oats) because it makes a chewier cookie. I also use a small ice cream scooper to drop the dough on the sheet. Do not press it flat and it makes a nice, thick, chewy cookie. I have made these several times and play around with the goodies inside...Some of our household favorites are: walnut and chocolate chip, Toffee Chip, and coconut flakes with almonds.

Still chewy even after a few days (what was left of them) and still delicious. I did make some changes, though. I upped the cinnamon to 2 tsp and added an extra 3/4 cup of flour because I live at a high altitude. I also experimented a bit: I used 1/2 cup packed Truvia Brown Sugar instead of the full 1 cup of packed sugar. I may add even less than that because the Truvia sugar is very prominent in taste, but still very good. Definitely great with chocolate chips!

Very good! The only thing I did different was added raisins. I flattened the first batch but I like a more thick chewy cookie! Will definitely make these again.

Sooooo good! I baked for 8 minutes so they'd still be chewy in the middle. Not a cookie is left and I just made them - should have made the full batch instead of half the recipe! 
Thanks for sharing, yummy!

I loved it! They were very good but a little dry. I also edited the recipe by taking half of it and added butterscotch chips I can easily see myself making this again! I also wish you didn't have to let them sit in the fridge for an hour! The wait is unbearable!

Simple to make! I added pecans and raisins and they were delicious! I also added pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon. Like many reviews said, you don't need to flatten them. I ruled them into balls and let them bake! They also stayed nice and soft for 2 days after baking. I high recommend.

Great and easy recipe. They were delicious. I add chocolate chips to mine. I was looking for a golden finish so I left it in oven longer. Bad idea because the next day, they were hard. I'll follow the 8-10 mins next time.

Very good! The spices were not overwhelming. I'm  not sure you really need to roll them out and could probably just use a cookie scoop. You could add raisins too.

So, I halved the recipe and still made 24 cookies. I used all of the same ingredients, except used Stevia rather than white sugar. I did this because I wanted to make them low-cal (3 WW points per cookies). AND, I just pulled them out of the oven! THE VERDICT: delicious and soft! Wonderful with a cold glass of milk!!

This is one of those recipes that I go back to again and again because it's delicious exactly as written, yet wonderfully versatile as well. I have made these cookies several times and added 1 cup of chopped pecans on one occasion; 1 cup of raisins (soaked in boiling water then well drained) another time; or 1 cup of dried cranberries or blueberries a different day -- OR any combination thereof. Next time I intend to add chocolate chips or maybe dried apricots. Feel free to experiment, knowing that this cookie recipe is an excellent foundation.

These are just perfect oatmeal cookies.  I did add one cup of raisins.  I also added  an extra teaspoon of vanilla because I do not put cinnamon in my oatmeal cookies.  This is a really good recipe and I did not even refrigerate the dough.

These are a nice cookies. I didn't flatten mine and they were crisp on the outside and tender inside. I reduced the white sugar by half, & I used half light and half dark brown sugar. I also increased the cinnamon by 1/2 tsp,  and the vanilla to 1 tbsp. I added chocolate chips and pecans. I then baked the cookies at 350 for 8 minutes, rotating halfway. 

Thanks for the recipe, I am planning to make it again :)

These cookies are so easy to make and they taste great!!! I brought them to a get together and a man came up to me to let me know they taste good and they were already all gone. I had to cook them for 12 minutes, maybe its because my oven is 30+ years old.

We really enjoy these cookies and give 5 stars.  However, I still feel like it's missing ever so slightly a little something that I can't put my finger on.  I think I wish they cooked up a little thicker than they do, but I wonder if that had anything to do with the modifications I made.  I substituted whole wheat flour entirely for the all purpose and the cookies were still great!  I also used rolled oats versus the quick cooking - again, that worked out fine.  I did not refrigerate the dough for very long, and I simply dropped the dough onto the cookie sheet.  I will definitely make these again, and next time might try refrigerating the dough as suggested to hopefully help make a thicker cookie, and I will likely add raisins and/or pecans.

Very soft and chewy! I used coconut sugar instead of white or brown sugar. For health concious people you can actually swap butter to coconut oil. It will turn out the same..

I'm not a big oatmeal raisin fan but I needed to make some for a party. I made these per the directions exect for giving them time in the fridge and doing drop cookies with raisins. Next time I will take the extra time to flatten them some. I wouldn't recommend cutting back the sugar, we thought they could have used some more or extra raisins for sweetness. I also found these had a great taste but were not "moist" if anything they were on the drier side. I will try adding more butter add/or eggs next time.

I made these yesterday exactly as the recipe stated and they turned out fabulous! There was no need to chill the dough and I flattened only half. They turned out great either way but next time I won't flatten them at all!  Mmm.. Soft yummy oatmeal cookies!

Followed advice to cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup since I didn't want them too sweet. Also added raisins, and craisins to a small portion. Did not press the cookies flat as I was going for soft instead of crunchy. It worked! The cookies spread perfectly and didn't run together. Cooking time was 9 mins for each mini batch (only had 1 sheet). I'm not a big oatmeal raisin fan (these were for hubby) and I've been snacking on them like crazy! 

Changes I'd make next time: Make the balls of dough bigger for a larger cookie, and *maybe* use the full amount of white sugar called for.

Fantastic recipe. I substituted regular flour with king Arthur's all purpose GF flour and tossed in dash o flax (about 1/4 cup) and a handful of walnuts. They are perfect! No one can tell they are GF or that I added ground flax seeds. Keeper for my book!

This is a wonderful recipe. I didn't have enough butter (only 1/2 cup), so I used 1/2 cup Crisco Shortening as well. After reading the reviews about them being crunchy if pressed, I decided to not press them before putting them in the oven and it resulted in nicely-shaped and soft cookies. Also, MAKE SURE YOU DON'T OVER-COOK THEM! 9 1/2 minutes is the exact amount of time you need. 

If you make the doughballs walnut-size, your looking at at about 50 (3/2)-inch cookies.

I just took a batch of these out of the oven, and OH MY!! This will be my husband's favorite! 

After reading the reviews I did change the white sugar to 1/2 Cup. Other than that my only deviation was to add the zest of 1 orange and a generous cup of craisins and chopped walnuts. They are wonderful!! I have been trying to make soft oatmeal cookies forever but my other recipes always turned out crisp.

Made this as a welcome home treat for dad who came home from a short hospital stay and was on a relatively high fibre diet. I was worried he wouldn't touch these because of the amount of oats in them and the amount of chew that goes with oatmeal. But surprisingly he ate them one after another! These are picky eater dad approved! 5/5!

Fantastic! We did make a few changes. I had some crushed graham crackers I wanted to use up, so I substituted one cup of them for one of the cups of oats. Then I also substituted 1/2 cup of a hemp/flax mixture for 1/2 cup of oats. So I only put 1 1/2 cups of oats in. We also added about 1/8 cup of chia seeds for a small healthy boost. They turned out wonderful! We will definitely be making these again! :)

This oatmeal cookie recipe is the best that I have tried thus far! I followed other reviewers' suggestions: 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ground cloves, 1/3 cup of semi-sweet chocolate, and kept the cookies round for a moist cookie. SCOOP SIZE: Medium cookie scoop (1.5 Tbsp of dough)  BAKE TIME: 12 mins. The cookies came out slightly crispy on the edges and soft and delicious in the middle. Enjoy!!

My family loves these. My kids devoured the ones I made with chocolate chips, but I preferred the ones with raisins. The cookies are a tad sweet for my taste, so I would probably cut back on that a bit next time. The texture of these cookies is PERFECT if you take them out of the oven when you first see them browning on the tops. Great recipe! Also, I didn't chill the dough, grease the cookie sheet, or flatten the cookies. No need.

Fabulous cookies! I had these Costco bought Quaker oats packets sitting at home which my entire family had tired of... So I used 6 packets of maple and brown sugar flavoured oats... Some other changes to the recipe were no cinnamon (didn't want it to clash with the maple flavour) and no brown sugar.

I followed this recipe to a T and my whole family found it too sweet. If you're going to make two dozen cookies, use 1.5 cups instead. Otherwise it came out really nice, chewy and soft.

This isn't my favorite oatmeal cookie recipe.  It's definitely chewy but Seems like it's missing something else.  Would be better with coconut, chocolate chips or nuts.

Best Oatmeal Cookie Recipe!  Just like my Granny made!  Very soft and chewy I added walnuts and raisins to the batter and didn't press these cookies with a sugared fork also added only a pinch of salt. Perfect recipe highly recommend.  Don't know what I would do without all recipes.com

Really soft and sweet! I didn't use sugar to top them and I also used rice flour because of food allergies. These cookies were awesome even without nuts, raisins, or chocolate.

These cookies are not moist and not  soft. I followed the instructions except I used a little less flour and about 1/2 cup less oatmeal. They came out crispy on the bottom and thick. The taste was very good but I won't make these again.

Great recipe, I have actually made it many times.  I follow the recipe exactly except I use old fashion oats, and my family loves it.  We don't like raisins either, but they are good with this cookie (it's good with chips, nuts, craisins, or even plain).  I made a batch today and made them into bars, which I liked even better. I also drizzled a bit of homemade icing on them and they were delicious.

I was getting drunk off purple beer and four lokos and wanted some cookies to soak it up a bit so I can go do round two and I found this recipe to be very good.  I added an extra tsp of cinnamon and a dab extra vanilla extract for more flavor.  They were very tasty.  I'm now hoping that the milk I had with them doesn't turn to cottage cheese in my belly, when it mixes with the purple beer, four lokos and the vodka I'm about to drink.

I took the other reviewers advice not to press down on the dough with a fork. It flatten on its own. Either than that I follow the recipe to point and it came out delicious! My husband rave about the cookies and suggested to add raisins. I'll be adding those to my second batch. Thank you so much for the recipe !!!!!

my kids love these things, and they are my go to recipe for any bake sale or any classroom parties. one thing that helps to keep them looking like they came from a bakery  is once you've formed the walnut sized cookie dough balls. make an OK sign using your thumb and index finger and using the same fingers from the other hand press into 3/4 inch thick flat discs. my kids always tell me its the first tray to be emptied.

the recipe came out fine I made half with raisins and the other half without I made mine a little large because I don't like little small cookies. it was a little too sweet for me who don't like sweets to begin with; the next time I will alter the sugar part in the recipe overall it was really good.

My families favourite cookie.  Good with chocolate chips,  coconut or just plain.  They don't last long enough to get old.  We substitute brown rice flour  for all purpose flour to make it gluten free for our family (I use gf oatmeal as well).

Great, flavorful cookie. Like others before me, I was able to add in extras (1/3 batch had chocolate chip, 1/3 batch had craisins and white chocolate chips, 1/3 left pain). All versions were great! I didn't chill the dough but am happy with how they turned out. Maybe next time I will to see what I was missing out on!

These cookies turned out great, soft and chewy. I left them shaped like balls and pressed them down lightly with a fork right after I took them out of the oven. I divided the batter in half and added dried cranberries to half. We found these cookies a bit sweet so I will go easy on the sugar next time but they definitely do not need sugar added on top while pressing. I baked them for the recommended ten minutes and they were still soft.

Excellent.  Fast.  Short on time, I had to skip the refrigeration and the ball and squish steps, they still came out great.  Used 4 teaspoons of vanilla, can't help myself.  I love that flavor.  Sitting on the counter all day, still soft and delicious.

I added a 1/4 cup more of flour and didn't wait for dough to chill.  I also used one stick of Imperial Brand margarine and one stick regular butter. I really think that made a significant difference in the softness of dough.  It still turned out phenomenal and is most definitely the best oatmeal cookie recipe I've used. I'll be using again!

This was the best recipe I've ever used for these cookies!!  They need the full 10 minutes to bake and as soon as they came out of the oven I sprinkled them with a cinnamon and sugar mixture. Delicious!!

Don't use 3 cups of oats! I used 2 and chilled overnight. I added 1.5 cups raisins.  These turn out soft and stay moist for days!

delicious as is! they've gotten rave reviews so far. when i was making them i was concerned it was too much sugar but they ended up not being overly sweet. I didn't press the cookies and just cooked them til the tops didn't look shiny and they were perfectly soft and chewy. I did add a little more cinnamon, but that's just my preference.

I tried this recipe and I think they were AMAZING!! BUT, I did add a few things and I agree with the other reviewers and added less salt (1/2 tsp). I did add 1 tsp of baking powder in addition to the baking soda, I also used the 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon but then added 1/2 tsp of ground allspice,and 1/4 tsp ground cloves. I used Quaker Old Fashioned Oats instead of Quick Cooking and added 1 Cup chopped pecans. These cookies spread nicely, and then flattened out as they cooled. My oven runs a little cool, so I set the temp to 375 degrees F and left them in the oven until they were golden brown. That required baking them for 12-14 min. instead of the recommended 8-10. Finally the other thing I did a little differently was to use a 1 inch cookie/ice cream scoop. I cooked them on a sheet of parchment on the cookie sheet and it was not necessary to flatten them. They spread really nicely. While they were slightly warm, my husband an I ate a half dozen sitting there. They were warm and chewy. Later when they had fully cooled, they got a little more crisp, but still had some chew to them. My husband said they were the best oatmeal cookies he ever had. I highly recommend this recipe and I added it to the family recipe book we keep for ourselves online.  This is the only recipe I will use from now on. Thanks for posting this recipe!!!

Great recipe! As another reviewer did, I used a drop cookie method, rather than making balls. They had a nice spread, during baking, and we soft and moist. I also substituted butter-flavored shortening, for the butter. I also added 1 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 cup coconut. They enhanced the sweetness, just enough, and the coconut helped make them extra chewy and held them together, so they didn't crumble. Will add this recipe to my must use recipes.

I have been looking for a soft oatmeal cookie for quite some time.  These were a close as I've been to what I am looking for. They tasted a little more 'floury' than I would prefer, but I would definitely make them again!

Used old fashioned oats and still came out great but a bit heartier. Like others have said, adjust cooking time down for a moister cookie or up for more crunch.

Turned out hard and crunchy (no matter when they were taken out of the oven). I didnt add the vanilla, instead a TON of cinnamon. I took the advice of others, I didnt press them down with sugar or grease the baking sheet (there was enough of both in the recipe!) Besides not being soft....they were actually really great!!!  Will definately make them again!

These oatmeal cookies are bomb! I made them twice now, both times were amazing! Although I spooned them out much larger than called for, I didnt flatten them or put any extra sugar on the cookies. I think that most likely made a difference for the "soft" texture you're looking for.

Great Recipe! Many of the recipes I have tried before are crispy, and I do not like that in an oatmeal cookie. I added 1 cup of raisins, and baked them for 10 minutes, although I had used my large cookie scoop, and ended up with 45 decent sized cookies. I will be making these again!

Yum!!
I made them almost just as the recipe said except that I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and added chocolate chips.  They are moist and deliciously cinnamon-y.  I used to use the recipe on the Quaker Oats container but no more - I think these are much better.  I felt that maybe refrigerating the dough did something to make them better so I did it even between batches.  Highly recommend!!

One of my new favorites! I halved the recipe and it still made lots of cookies! I didn't flatten them with a fork I just rolled the dough into balls and mine came out nice and round and had the perfect thickness. I was afraid these would be dry and without flavor but they were so good and perfectly sweet! The cinnamon is a very nice touch and they weren't dry or hard at all!

Made these for a school party. They were delicious. Soft and chewy. I did not use nuts because they were for a school function, but would probably be good with nuts, chocolate chips, or raisins. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Cut white sugar down to 1/2 cup and added 1 cup raisins. Replace 1/2 the butter with applesauce and grade up a zuchini (1/2 cup). 1/8 cup of chia seeds and sprouted flax would also be a nice touch.  I baked with a stone ware cookie sheet and had to add 5 minutes cooking and up the temperature to 385.  AMAZING!  The batter tastes like the best granola bar you've ever had.

This was a great recipe!  My cookies turned out crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used old fashioned oats because I didn't have quick oats. My stand mixer did a good job of pulverizing the oats, so it was fine.  I also added a cup of mixed cranberries, chocolate chunks, almonds and walnuts (Aldi cranberry mix Trailmix,chopping the nuts before adding.  I will save this recipe and use it again. I think the key is using the two sticks of butter and the sugar to make the cookie crispy, but chewy in the middle.

Recipe is perfect AS-is. I have never made any changes to the basic recipe; I have added items such as raisins, walnuts and coconut. These are always a big hit. I usually bake them closer to 8 minutes.

The only problem was..... Most of it didn't make it to the oven cause it was so good raw!!! I added walnuts and coconut. Also used Spelt flour. Perfect!

These just came out of the oven and they are amazing! I used all whole wheat flour, cut the sugar by 1/3 and added 1/2 c dark chocolate chips. I also didn't chill, just spooned them on the cookie sheet. Thank you!

The cookies were absolutely delicious when they came out fresh from the oven. Though id have to say i think the baking time should be reduced..i left my cookies in the oven for the whole 10 minutes, and once the cookies cooled down, theyve become pretty hard!! other than that, these have just the right amount of sweetness and cinnamon to enjoy with a hot cup of coffee or tea!!

Loved it. I put it all in a bowl and folded it over until it was completely mixed. My son fell in love with these and they didn't last long at all. Quick, delicious and smell just as delicious as they taste. A+.

The 1st time I made these they were very sweet so I made them again, I cut the sugars and salt in half, added 1 tsp nutmeg, I put choc. chips in half and butterscotch chips in half. I did not refrigerate or roll into balls and flatten with a fork. I just did them like normal drop cookies and they are still just as good with only 1/2 the sugar. I worried they would be too gooey without adding flour but they weren't. They were great.

These came out amazing!  I made the recipe as stated, however I added some goodies.  One batch I added milk choc chips, dehydrated cranberries and cherries, and flaked coconut.  The second batch I got a bit crafty and added some cinnamon toast crunch cereal, mini marshmallows, and milk choc chips.  BOTH were delish!  This recipe made quite a few cookies too, enough to freeze for another day.  Will make again.... and again.... and again!

Thanks for this quick & easy recipe! They were unbelievably soft! I was able to make a little over two dozen. Unfortunately there weren't any raisins at home...They wouldn't been much better.
P.S. Dried cranberries are an alternative if you don't like raisins. They actually taste WAAY better! Maybe other dried fruits too.

Very good and soft. I used whole wheat flour because I realized half way into it that I was out of regular. They still tasted excellent! (I've made them with regular flour before)Very versatile cookie wish I would've had some raisins/crasins or nuts! Definitely will make again.

These cookies are the most moist and delicious cookies I have ever tasted! I skipped the cinnamon and didn't refrigerate and was still great! Next time I'll put less sugar, they don't need to be so sweet. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made plain oatmeal cookies last night no nuts no chips added. They taste amazing! I did roll them into walnut sized balls but when I used the sugar and fork I found it made them a tad crunchy. I tried without the sugar and fork and I was able to get a delicious chewy cookie.... I would make them again but maybe add a little less oatmeal and try them with Chocolate and Carmel chips

I made this recipe following directions to a "t"-these are the best hands down homemade cookies I have ever made. I was sceptical after reading reviews but they turned out delicious. The only thing I didn't do was flatten them with a fork as it instructed, they flattened on there own. I also mixed white sugar and cinnamon in a bowl and sprinkled on top and just added in craisins not raisins. I was looking for something guilty to eat and very gooey-this was perfect! I only made a few so I didn't eat them all in one sitting and rolled the rest in a log and froze for later. Guess I will see how well they hold after being frozen. Yuuummeee!

I used self-raising flower, left out the baking soda, salt and used less sugar than was called for. In addition, I didn't let the dough sit - just combined the ingredients and popped them into the oven. So easy and delicious! I also added in some walnuts!

My whole family loved these! I did a couple things different than the directions. I used heaping spoonfuls of cinnamon (of the Ceylon variety), I didn't refrigerate the dough, but baked it right away. I didn't push the dough down with a fork. They turned out great! My hubby said they are the best cookies I have ever made. Thanks Bittersweet1 for sharing!

with out a doubt the best oatmeal cookie recipe I have tried. I added a cup of raisins and a cup of milk chocolate chips and a 1/2 cup of toffee chips to the second batch I made... YUM... plain or gussied up these cookies rock. I forgot to chill the dough the second time I made these without experiencing  any difference.. perhaps because of the addition of the chips and raisins?

it was delicious but it breaks apart when you dip it in milk and also when you eat the cookie it tastes like a fart. It was okay but not the best. I suggest another recipe.

42 cookies fresh out of the oven and I have to say that this recipe is a real winner.  I followed the directions with one exception.  I added 1 cup of shredded coconut at the end of the mixing.  They turned out so delicious I can't wait to make another batch!

Everybody in the house agreed that these are the best ever. I baked them per instructions and they were moist and chewy. Also added 1 1/2 C raisins. I was half a cup short on oatmeal and didn't use sugar to press them but they still turned out fantastic! Thank you to Bittersweet1 for this new "old family recipe". It's a keeper!

These cookies are super delicious! I made two batches of them the first time, one with regular ingredients and one with gluten free flour and dairy free butter for my brother. Even with the differences, they worked perfectly! I make these often now, and sometimes I mix in some raisins or chocolate chips. This isn't one of those recipes that will go haywire with the smallest mistakes of measurements, which makes it very easy! Definitely recommend!

I absolutely love this recipe! I made a couple batches this morning and they ALL turned out perfect. I chose to not add raisins or nuts and my cookies were still both large and moist. I even pureed one for my son and he loved it!

Cookies were still very dry. Tried another batch with 1/2 cup less sugar, only 1/2 coup flour instead of 2 cups and added raisins. This batch turned out perfect. No need to push down with a sugar coated fork either.

Don't bother cooling, and don't you dare squish them. Roll up 3-4 cm balls and bake. They come out crispy on the outside, deliciously soft on the inside. Pretty much irresistible.

I followed the recipe but also added coconut, walnuts, and raisins. They were perfect. I have read reviews saying that these did not turn out soft for some people. One reason my be how they scoop or measure the flour. I always spoon my flour out into the measuring cup as opposed to just scooping the flour out with the measuring cup which can impact the flour and increases the amount you are actually using which could be causing the problem for some people.

These cookies were magnificent! They are not too sweet with a cakeyness to them with just the right amount of oatmeal. I made mine with dried blueberries instead of raisins, and even made some plain. So good! Recipe made way more than two dozen though, which was good because 24 of these delicious little cookies would not have lasted long in my house.

This is a good base for an oatmeal cookie, but the sugar is too much. I halved the amount of sugar & brown sugar, but the cookies are still very sweet. Next time I'd quarter the amount of sugar.

Delicious cookies!  I changed it a bit by using 1/2 cup coconut oil in place of 1/2 a cup of butter, and I added chocolate chips.   They are moist and perfect!  Oh and I didn't bother refrigerating or rolling the dough,  just dropped on cookie sheet.

This is sooo good. I made the dough beforehand and froze it for later use. I added raisins and baked them in a toaster oven. It did not have a temperature setting, so I just covered it with foil and checked it periodically to see if it's done. It took about 15 mins and an additional 2 mins without the foil cover to brown the top. It's awesome. I make it in small batches for freshly baked cookies for breakfast!

I really liked this! I would reduce the sugar next time I like to think these cookies are healthier then regular cho. Chip cookies but they were really sweet. I did split the batter are made one batch cho chips and walnuts and the other craisins and coconut extract. They were really tasty i cookies them for 11 mins. And i also used a cookie scoop because i really dislike flat cookies. .

I loved these. I didn't have brown sugar so I used all white. My batter was really dry so I added applesauce and some milk until it was a moist batter. (2 tbs of each) I added 1/4 cup of coconut. Amazing! I don't like oatmeal cookies normally.

I made the recipe as stated, but added 1 cup of chocolate chips (mix of Nestle dark chocolate and milk chocolate chips) and used old fashioned oats instead if quick cooking oats (that's all I had). Also, I didn't flatten the cookies with a fork and baked at 350 degrees for 10 min. 375 seemed too high for the chocolate chips I added. They turned out great! Soft on the inside and really "oat-y". If you love oatmeal, you'll love these cookies. Maybe the oatmeal flavor and texture was intensified by the use of old-fashioned oats, but they were terrific and went quickly.

Great taste and texture! They just did not look pretty... I will try this recipe again! Probably my fault, I rolled the entire cookie in sugar, then pressed with fork.

To chill, or not to chill the dough. Having tried both, here is what I can report. If you like your cookies thinner and crispier, don't chill the dough. If you like them thicker and chewier (like my family), chill the dough. I also baked them on parchment paper. Perfection!

My hubby and sons really enjoyed these cookies! The recipe was very easy to follow and they turned out delicious!   I added craisins and didn't press them with the fork or even let the dough chill.  They still came out perfectly!  They puff while they bake,  but flatten on their own once they cool,  so flattening isn't necessary at all.   I also reduced the oatmeal to 2 1/2 cups.  3 seemed like it might have been too thick.   Great recipe!

Easy and delicious! It made 37 cookies and pretty big ones too. I loved everything about the recipe. I did not have to use a fork dipped in sugar nor flatten them either. I like my cookies soft so I left them exactly 10 min. They came out cake like and delicious. My added part were the pecans. I added 1 cup of chopped pecans...of course...Texas style! Thank you for sharing the recipe.

My family loves this cookie recipe!  I have tried both pressing with the sugar-coated fork and just rolling into a ball without flattening.  Both methods work very well.  I think next time I will cut back on the salt--maybe 1/2 tsp instead of one tsp.  The only that baffles me is the yield--I got more than 5 dozen cookies, so I am not sure about the reported 2 dozen number, but no complaining here! :)

I just made these cookies and they are amazing!! very soft I baked them for the full 10 minutes but at 325 degrees and they were perfect!! I did throw in a little secret though.. I divided the batter in half and did half original then with the other half I added one package of m&m's and about 1/4 cup of softened peanut butter and another 1/4-1/2 cup of oats until it has the same texture as the original.. the peanut butter makes it a bit moister, you want it to make a formed ball but not soggy. Anyway it turned out delicious and I'm glad I found this recipe!!

I substituted Earth's Best for butter and flax meal mixed with water for the eggs to make this a vegan recipe.  Also followed some suggestions in the reviews and made a batch with raisins.  Overall the cookies came out good, but overly sweet in my opinion.  If I attempt again, I will try using half the amount of white sugar as another reviewer suggested.  Note:  if you use flax meal, the cookies will come out a little more crumbly than if you used the eggs as called for by the original recipe.

Very good and soft. No need to refrigerate dough or use the sugared fork. I rolled them and left them as is and they came out perfect.

It's not as though this recipe needs any additional positive reviews but I felt the need to thank the author. This is a fantastic, food proof recipe. Each and every time I have made and shared these, I have been asked to make and share them again. Everyone loves them! I have made them just as the recipe is and have added all kinds of goodies as well. My favorite add ins are cranberries and chopped walnuts. I've added apple sauce, chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, raisins, pecans. Around Thanksgiving, a friend gave me some persimmons, so I added persimmon pulp that I puréed in a blender and that was really yummy. Thanks for an outstanding recipe. I have thoroughly enjoyed it, and so have my family and friends!

I love oatmeal cookies but I had never thought of making them myself until I came across this recipe! For my first time they were awesome! I made them for my fathers birthday and I barely got to eat any, they were so good and gone within minutes. Moist, chewy and just enough oats. Will do again soon!

These cookies were amazing! To prevent the cookies from being overly sweet, I only used a 1/2 cup of white sugar and 3/4 cups of brown sugar. I also used a mixture of whole wheat and white flour to make them slightly healthier. Instead of flattening the cookies, I left them in round balls and they took 11 minutes to bake. They turned out nice and soft and had a great flavor. I will definitely be making these again!

These are the best oatmeal cookies!  The only change would be to use only 1 tsp. baking soda as they taste a tad salty to me. I also added a splash of milk. I used a cookie dough scooper and they were the perfect size...made about 3.5 dz.

We also added Coconut, pomegranate Craisins and walnuts to the dough and cooked them for 8 minutes to keep a bit softer. We use 2 Tablespoons per cookie ball and pressed them down with our hands instead of a fork. I wanted them to be thicker for the scoop of vanilla ice cream I was going to put in between them to make a delicious cookieice cream sandwich. Uh YUM! And it is kid friendly too!

My 3yr old and I made these tonight and we had a blast doing it together. I think she may have had more fun than me!! I added raisins to all of them and added chocolate chips to 1/2 of them. We didn't chill the dough, grease the pan, or use a sugared fork. We did flatten them slightly with our palms of our hand to get them to set on the cookie sheet. The recipe made about 40small cookies. They are amazing.  My husband who doesn't really like sweets gave me a 9/10, he said he would have given me a 10/10 but the cookies were small :)

Great recipe! I used half a cup of coconut oil & half a cup of honey instead of the whole cup of sugar and they were soft, chewy & moist! Plus coconut oil& honey  are healthier. Added some chopped almonds too :) Baking powder works just as good as baking soda in this recipe. But yes, a full 10 minutes is necessary.

These cookies were amazing!!  I divided my batter into 3 portions.  Added dried cherries and shredded coconut to one.  White chocolate chips to another and the last added semi sweet and white chips and raisins.  My kids gobbled them all up!!  I am making another batch today!!

for my first try at baking cookies these rocked will be my foundation recipe, they are very simple to make. Did not change recipe at all, did split dough and added semi sweet chocolate chips to one half those were the best.

The taste of these cookies was excellent, however my batch came out way too dry. Because I was experimenting (I was trying to find a good home recipe for a diabetic family member). I substituted Splenda for white sugar, halved the brown sugar and only used about 1 cup quick cooking oats. I will defiitely make them again but will try using even a little less of the oats. I believe they have a Splenda brown sugar, so next time I will use the called for amount in recipe. The taste was great! I just need to tweek my texture!

Awesome cookie recipe. I actually made it with spelt flour (what I had in the house) and it came out just great. I followed what other reviewers said and did not flatten the cookies, 9 mins was perfect. Simple and delicious!

I dont know what I did wrong but these cookies came out flat and crispy! I did add chia seeds and dark chocolate chunks but that should not have changed the texture. Maybe try again with better results

This is definitely the best oatmeal cookie recipe I've tried!  These cookies stay soft and chewy for a full week!!   
Have used this recipe a few times and I now substitute cinnamon sugar for plain sugar on top.  I sprinkle it on, then flatten the cookie balls a tiny bit (just until the top is no longer rounded, but flat) with a spatula or the back of a spoon.  I bake for 9 minutes, rotate the pans due to my oven's "hot spots", and bake for another 2 minutes.  They turn out perfectly every time. Skipping the refrigeration step did made them spread out more, resulting in a thinner, crispier cookie. I keep them in the fridge for several hours or overnight. Usually, I mix in a cup of raisins, but I've also added dark chocolate chips instead and loved the results.  Also, I use margarine in place of butter for baking.
A tip I learned from my mother about baking with raisins: always soak raisins in very warm water for awhile to plump them up prior to using. Be sure to strain them fully so you're not adding excess water to your mix, then gently stir them in. It's personal preference, but I find the raisins dry out a lot if I skip this step.

This was a hit at our house.  I did not chill the dough, and just dropped it onto parchment paper.  I used 2/3 cup each brown and white sugar to compensate for the 1/2 cup plumped raisins I put in.  I don't know how big those walnut sized pieces of dough are supposed to be to only get 2 dozen cookies.  I scooped them at about 2 TBSP and ended up with almost 4 dozen cookies.

Perfect oatmeal cookie. I followed basic instructions until the refrigeration for 1 hour, that I didn't do. Added baking raisins to half the batch and milk chocolate chips the the rest.

Delicious cookie that quickly became a family favorite.  Easy, fool-proof recipe that didn't need any modifications.  Baked for 12-13 minutes, though.

Made these cookies this evening and the recipe is a keeper!  Followed the directions and used the exact ingredients called for in the recipe.  The only things I did different was ... I used parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheets and I baked the cookies 15 minutes instead of 8-10 minutes.  I have three Pampered Chef cookie scoops and I used the middle one.  This recipe says it will make 24 cookies but I got 38 cookies.  Thank you Bittersweet1 for submitting this recipe.  It's the best plain oatmeal cookie I've ever baked.

Love this basic recipe. My first batch turned out under-baked and a lithe too brown on the bottom. (Using a dark pan). I changes the temp to 350 degrees and baked them for 9 minutes. This resulted with a softer cookie and overall great texture.

Delicious! These cookies had the perfect balance as they were soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The receipe was very easy to follow as I cut it in half. Next time I will add in rasins or chocolate chips. I look forward to making these again..that's for sure!

These cookies are delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and stirred in golden raisins and dried cranberries.  The edges bake up crispy while the center is melt-in-your-mouth smooth because of the brown sugar.  You could pretty much eat them without any mix-ins, though.

These cookies are delicious!  Took the suggestions from other members andI didn't refrigerate the door or flatten them out. They turned out great and we're very soft and moist. May try adding extra ingredients next time but this is a definite make this again.

Just made these for thanksgiving tomorrow. I added raisins to it and used an ice cream scooper to form balls. I didn't press them down with a fork because I wanted them chunkier. I was really pleased with how they turned out (I tend to like my cookies softer), they were very moist but also slightly crisp on the outside.

Too much sugar.  I would definitely reduce to about 1 1/2 cups total instead of 2. Other than that, I added chopped walnuts and raisins so that was a plus.

Yummy! I threw in a couple of handfuls of trail mix. Used an ice cream scoop and flattened them with my hand..take out of the oven when they look a little undercooked in the middle and they will firm up on the cookie sheet when they are cooling..good recipe!

I made these because my family asked for some although I don't normally like oatmeal cookies. But these were great! Easy to make. Not necessary to press with the fork, they cook down perfectly. They turn out so flat I was afraid they would be crisp, but they really are nice and soft. The cinnamon flavor is perfect which is what I don't normally like about oatmeal cookies, but it's not overpowering in these. I did add raisins as they were requested. I also used parchment which negated the necessity to grease the pans.

I followed the recipe nearly to a T. I followed reviews suggestions and did not chill for an hour. I decided to roll them into 'small' walnut sized balls since any taller and they get really wide.. I added it up and made about 63 cookies. all about bite size-medium sized. very moist! when i pulled the mfrom the oven i was worried i didnt cook them long enough but they will become stiffer once they cool! 9 minutes was perfect.

This was a good recipe. I used only 2 cups of oatmeal and did not refrigerate them or press them down. Brought them to a tailgate and everyone commented numerous times on how good they were. I also added m&m's to half of the batch.

I followed the recipe with a few exceptions.  I did not chill the dough (as other reviewers indicated this step was unnecessary). I used the scoop and drop approach without flattening the dough or using a sugared fork.  I added a package of white baking chips to the dough prior to baking.  I baked them 10 minutes.  They are very tasty and crunchy.  Next time, I would bake them less time so they would be more chewy than crunchy.  They do lack a little moisture.  I like when oatmeal cookies are a bit chewy and moist.

These are very good cookies. I have made them many times. I used chopped cranberries and pumpkin pie spice. My friends rave about them.

Not moist! I chose to make this recipe because it said these cookies were going to be moist. but not whatsoever! they were really good but dry while chewing it. i would of prefer them being moist and chewy. i did substitute regular sugar for splenda but i dont think the sugar was the problem oh and also regular flour for whole wheat flour

I don't rate recipes very often, but these are *excellent*!! I made the base recipe exactly as written, but because it's fall I used Pumpkin Pie Spice instead of the cinnamon, and then added 1 c. of Craisins, 1 c. of flaked coconut, and 1/2 c. white chocolate chips. The batter turned out so super thick that I didn't think it would spread much, so I didn't chill it. I made my balls the size of walnuts and put them on parchment (instead of greasing the sheets), but because of the additions, it made exactly 36 cookies instead of just 24. And in listening to some other reviewers, I didn't flatten them at all and they turned out absolutely perfect! All nice and round, just like they came out of a store bought box! They were so pretty - not too thick, not too thin. They had barely crisp edges, and the insides were chewy and wonderful! I *highly* recommend these, especially for the Holidays! Thanks SO much for this recipe! :) (Even my sister, who's the biggest cookie snoot, kept making happy "mmm... mmm..." noises when she tried one! Now that's sayin' *something*! lol)

I am just a regular guy that isn't particularly skilled at cooking or baking but I gotta say, this recipe is so quick and easy that I don't have to think twice about making it if I'm in the mood. This produces the most delicious and moist cookies that people I share it with actually think I'm good at baking! The only change I made was that I add a quarter to a half bag of milk chocolate chips. I gotta have chocolate in my oatmeal cookies.

When all ingredients combine it somehow forms meth, amazing addictive meth. I halfed the recipe and added a quarter teaspoon of cloves and substituted whole wheat flour. I now have a dozen and a half cookies infront of me and the will power is fading by the minute

Bottoms were burnt, however, I may need a new thermostat for my oven.  Did not turn out soft, but the dough was very dry.  I checked the measurements several times.  Just wasn't moist enough.  I did like the taste of these cookies.

I soak the raisins in the eggs in the refrigerator for 1+ hours before mixining ingredients by hand - something about mixing by hand makes them really turn out delicious. Hands down best cookies I've had in a while, this recipe is one of my favorites.

Fabulous!  I added 1 cup of Kraft caramel baking nuggets, used a Pampered Chef mini cookie scoop, and let the cookies sit on the baking sheet for 2 minutes (after 9 minutes in the oven) before transferring to a cooling rack.  One batch made more than 80 cookies.
I'm off to the gym!

Thanks to MRONUFRAK, we made some adjustments when we made these tonight.  We added a half cup of applesauce to make them more moist, didn't press them down, and gave them the full 10 minutes.  We also added chocolate chips.  PERFECTION!!

This recipe was good. I loved how soft and chewy the cookies came out. However, I listened to some of the other reviewers and cut the sugar in half and should have also cut the salt. They were a slighty salty so next time I won't use so much salt. I also used 1.5 cups of unbleached all purpose flour and 1/4 cup whole wheat flour. Also I think they could use some more cinnamon or perhaps some other spice as they were slighty bland. I didn't refrigerate them and they turned out fine. I also made a glaze out of powdered sugar and milk and topped them. I made them for a play date for my son and he loved them! I couldn't keep him away from them before the play date! Thanks for the recipe

I actually was looking for a good oatmeal cookie recipe to turn into a healthy, protein cookie for my boyfriend and I. We both have a massive sweet tooth!! 
Anyways I substituted butter with Ghee, (they sell it at trader joes and whole foods), instead of a cup of white sugar I used a cup of vanilla protein powder, upped the vanilla just slightly, added about a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, used whole wheat flour, and added just a quarter cup of fat free evaporated milk (my mom always used it in baking growing up, so delicious!!), as well as a generous helping of semisweet chocolate chips! The first time I made these I even substituted agave nectar for the brown sugar, it was still very good! But considering how many cookies this makes, I didn't feel like a cup of dark brown sugar was really that bad to use. I have given this recipe to all of my friends. In fact my boss said these tasted entirely too delicious to be healthy or have protein powder in them ;) happy baking!

I tried this recipe with a few modifications as I try to avoid wheat (the wheat in oats is minimal).  I used a mixture of King Arthur's Gluten Free Flour and 1/2 coconut flour (gluten free).  Even though I did grease the pans, after flattening the cookies, I turned them to loosen them.  And, if you take them off the pan before the four minutes, they break.  Take the time and let them harden.
All in all, this is a delious and easy to make cookie.

I am not a big fan of oatmeal, so I never bothered to make them...but for a benefit to raise money, I figured it was a good idea because a lot do enjoy oatmeal cookies...they were easy, baked perfect and I thought they were delicious.

These cookies have the best combination of chewiness in the middle and crispy edges! They have a sweet cinnamon flavor and the oats always make me feel like I'm eating healthy so I always eat a few at a time! So delicious!

I made these cookies for my family and they loved them! One comment I'd like to make is they're a little needy is sweetness. I made them the second time and add 1/4 cup extra of each sugar and they were amazing! Thank you. :)

They were delish. My daughter and i threw in some peanut butter and some chocolate chips! Super soft and moist. I also just dropped them onto the cookie sheet. No sugared fork flattening them. Turned out amazing!

This is the first oatmeal cookie that stays soft!! I really love this quick and easy recipe! Definitely going to keep it and pass it around to all my relatives. I made the batch 1/3 plain, 1/3 chocolate chips, and 1/3 raisins. It helps to use a cookie scoop so they all come out the same size. Great recipe!

Very nice recipe. I added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans and 1/2 cup of plumped raisins. I had to increase the baking time to 11 minutes. I didn't flatten them or dip them in sugar. They came out perfectly shaped and sweet.They were outrageous!

Makes a great base for whatever you can think of! I added Dried Cranberries, Raisins, Roasted Almonds, Walnuts, Granola and Chocolate chips for "trail mix" cookies. Soft, delicious!

These are great! I added a few things... A dash of cloves & 1tbsp molasses. Divided recipe in two. Mixed raisins in one half, and cinnamon chips in the other. Both are very tasty! I did refrigerate mine over night. I didn't roll them into balls, just used my cookie scoop, then smashed down with hand SLIGHTLY. My cookies had to bake for 10 min. HOWEVER key is to only bake till edges are golden brown. Cookie will not look completely cooked. But after you leave them on sheet for 5 min, they are perfect. And they are so soft & yummy! Thx for the recipe :)

Gluten free changes - the flour to coconut flour, 4 eggs for each cup of coconut flour. I did cut the recipe in half, added a 1/2 tsp of maca powder and made the cookies smaller. They are a bit dry, as others have stated so will add in some apple sauce next time. Keeping the recipe!

We ate these as quickly as we could without burning our mouths! ! The kids loved them, even my very picky 3-yr old who doesn't like cookies (what??!!). The texture is wonderful, and ours came out perfectly moist. . We didn't flatten them with a fork, though.

Its so easy to follow, though i made some changes i lessen half a cup of brown sugar and half a cup of white sugar, divided the mixture into 3, add 1/4 cup raisins in 1st , 1/4 cup semi sweet chocolate chips 2nd, 1/4 cup dried apricot 3rd. Amazing and gives smile on my face, my Husband and my 4year old Son like it so much... I love those ones with dried apricot, Which my  Honey and my Baby loves those ones with chocolate chips. Those with raisins i finish them last.

The best oatmeal cookie!  Added 1 cup raisins to make oatmeal raisin cookies which are my husband's favorite.  This recipe now replaces all the others I've tried and hung on too as I searched for the best.

these cookies are wonderful! my whole family loves them! they are soft and chewy, the perfect cookie. All though they were a little bland. I added fruit on top of them once they were done and it was delicious. They needed the full 10 minutes to get golden brown. Overall this is a tasty cookie that i recommend. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Great easy recipe. Turned out perfect. Not sure why others have had issues. Added walnuts to half the batter and drizzled with white chocolate once cooled. Baked for 13 min on 350 and got a nice soft chewy cookie. Thanks for recipe! Will definitely use this again

I followed the recipe with a few alterations. I only used 1 tsp. of cinnamon and I added 1 cup of raisins and a cup of semisweet chocolate chips to the batter. I made my cookies larger than walnut-sized; I didn't press them down and I baked them for about 14min. Absolutely delicious! Soft,chewy and very moist!

I've made these twice for real estate open houses to give visitors.  We bake a dozen at a time and keep hot fresh out of the oven cookies all day.  Let me tell you that everyone loves them.  Two people today said they were better than Starbuck's oatmeal cookies.  I've never had theirs so wouldn't know, but some guests came back for seconds and even asked if they could take one or two for the road.  You can mix the dough in like five minutes and the dough refrigerates well if you want to cook batches at different time.  I followed the recipe to a T.  I cook them for seven to eight minutes just preferring a softer cookie.  One thing I learned though, is to keep the dough chilled if you aren't baking them all at once.  I make the mistake of letting mine get closer to room temperature by leaving it out for an hour and my cookies looked like little rocks instead of the beautiful cookies they are meant to be.  This was a user created issue and nothing to do with the recipe.  Thanks so much for the post.  I will be serving these at every open house from now on.  ONE LAST THING.....I ADD ABOUT A CUP OF RAISINS TO THE DOUGH AND IT'S PERFECT.

Great recipe! I followed the recipe exactly, adding 3/4 cup raisins, but I didn't chill the dough. I used a small ice-cream scoop to make even size cookies, and didn't flatten the dough. They made perfect, soft, chewy cookies!

Absolutely amazing texture!  I omitted the cinnamon and added vanilla and chocolate chips.  I baked for 10-11 minutes.  The best oatmeal cookie ever.

I did what Colorado Princess did...used splenda, WW flour and did not flatten.  I also added 1/2 cup of a mix of raisins, cranberries and blueberries and a l/1 cup of chopped pecans and walnuts.  Excellent!!  I will definitely make these again.

BITTERSWEET1 - Thank you for the great recipe! I read many reviews and made very  miner adjustments! First, I baked at 350 instead of 375 for 8 minutes. I think the lower temperature helped to make them soft - and they were nice and soft! Since I added raisins, I headed the advice of others and only added the brown sugar and cut the white sugar out altogether. I also reduced the oatmeal to 2.5 cups instead of 3 cups and used steel cut oats. (The steel cut oats gave them a finer texture. ) This is a very good recipe! Very simple and easy to customize to ones taste. I will be making these again and again! Next time I'll try dark chocolate chips or cranberries and walnuts. Again, thank you for posting this terrific recipe.

This is the one!  It definitely makes more than 24 cookies, though, probably at least twice that amount.  I made the dough as is, then pressed 2-3 butterscotch chips into a couple of trays, and raisins into a few other trays.  I didn't need to dip the fork in sugar before pressing, either.  Next time, I may put a little less cinnamon, because my husband isn't a big fan, but, otherwise, these are terrific!

I followed this recipe as is to the end but I added chocolate chips and raisins to my batch and I found these cookies to be way too sweet. There is too much oatmeal in the dough which makes it hard after sitting in the fridge for an hour. A tip if you do still want to try this recipe because of the other thousands of glowing reviews is that you have to mold your dough into small balls right after mixing and BEFORE you let it sit for an hour. Maybe it it will work better for you, but this is one recipe I will not try again.

I whipped up half a batch of these bad boys during nap time and I have to say WOW! I wanted to use ingredients that I already had in the house but had to substitute almond extract in lieu of vanilla. I felt no need to put the dough in the fridge and didn't sugar the fork I lightly pressed the dough balls with. They were quick and simple, came out delicious! Crispy on the edges and soft and chewy in the middle. I was expecting 12 cookies and yielded 20 :) I don't think they will last until tomorrow!

This is a great recipe for oatmeal cookies. I tweaked the recipe to make the cookies healthier so I wasn't sure how they would turn out, but they still came out soft and flavorful. I substituted the all-purpose flour for white whole-wheat flour and instead of 1 cup white sugar, I added 1 tablespoon. I will try margarine instead of butter next time to see how that changes things.

These were delicious and I only made a few very small changes. I melted the butter completely and mixed that way-made a chewer cookie. Also, roll the dough into balls before you chill them. Then put the balls in the oven directly from the fridge. This keeps them from flattening! I tried to dip the fork in sugar but nothing stuck. So I flattened them a TINY bit and sprinkled just a bit of sugar on each. Baked for 10 min and they were wonderful!!!

These were great. Very simple and tasty.  I took the advice of others and cut the white sugar down to 1/2 cup, and I'm glad I did.  They were plenty sweet.  I will also admit to cutting about a half-cup of oats and adding about a cup and a half of trail mix with peanut, raisins, almonds, m&ms and a handful of chocolate chips for good measure.  They turned out just great. I baked about 9 minutes to get them just right, possibly due to the additions. Texture was just right. This is clearly a great base recipe that is very forgiving and invites variations. Experiment to your heart's content!

This turned out to be a great recipe, though the cookies did seem to spread out a bit too much for my taste. When I made them a second time, I added one mashed-up VERY ripe banana, which made for a delicious variation that also retained the shape a bit more.

I'm a novice baker, but I got a lot of compliments from these! 
To experiment, I baked 4 small batches with different properties, 8 minutes + pressed, 10 minutes + pressed, 13 minutes + not pressed, and 17 minutes + not pressed, resulting in cookies ranging from super soft to rather crunchy. The 10 pressed and 13 unpressed were very similar in quality, as the thicker unpressed cookies need more time to bake. They all tasted good though, though presentation-wise, the pressed cookies look better.
If I were to make these again, I would use a tad less sugar, and then do a thicker coating of sugar on top.

These cookies stayed soft for days. I took them out of oven at the minimum time. I agree with another reviewer the sugar on the top is unnecessary before baking. Tasted fine with raisins added. Still not quite the oatmeal cookie I am looking for though.

It was my first time making oatmeal cookies and these were really good!  I followed the recipe and added rasins, but didn't use a fork to press flat -- just used a cookie scoop.  They came out great!  Some people must over-cook because they were moist.  When you take them out they look like they need more time, but they just need to cool!

These came out bready and really dry. Seemed like alot of oats and was definately too much. I'll note that I only had an hour to let the batter sit so that might have made the difference. Will try another recipe for oatmeal cookies in the future.

I LOVE these cookies. They were the best, especially with raisins! When baked at the proper length, the cookies come out chewy and the insides were soft yet the outsides were crunchy. ^.^ I think dipping the fork is unnecessary and mine came out fine without doing so. :) (that is, if you add raisins)

just made them best soft oatmeal cookies ever I am not a big fan of the crunchie oatmeal cookies and this were just perfect moist and soft as the title announces my family loves them and the best thing is that is the perfect base to add any ingredient I made half with almond and the other half with unsweeten coconut the only thing I did was took out 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and added of nugmeg which gave them a nice flavor and use a little less of salt...my dad is very critical with cooking especially since he is in a healthy diet but had no comment on this ones he just loves them

Thought this was a really good one! y husband LOVES oatmeal cookies and thought I would make some as treat tonight They turned out great, however, for my, a bit too sweet, but not for him! I will use this one again in the future, might change things a little, like adding the raisins or chocolate chips. Thanks

Very delicious cookies.  I added a pinch of cinnamon and more raisins and they were very tasty.  I used a regular size cookie scoop and the cookies didn't spread like normal, so I ended up with small bite size cookies.  But they were still delicious.  Next time I might reduce the amount of quick cooking oats from 3 cups to 2 - 2.5 cups.

Great recipe! I changed it slightly because I am eating vegan so instead of the eggs I used the great alternative of 1 tbsp ground chia seeds and 1/4 cup of water for each egg. Turned out perfect!

I didn't have enough oats, so I halved the recipe. I also took the advice of other reviewers and skipped chilling the dough and did not flatten with a sugar-dipped fork. These cookies didn't need it, as they were sweet enough. Cookies were soft and chewy with nice crispy edges. Great recipe! Will try adding in other goodies next time. Thanks for sharing!

Texture was perfect, but the flavor wasn't there.  With so many reviews I was really really dissapointed.  All recipes recipes with thousands of reviews have always been fantastic in the past.  This one was a fail that I will not try again. ):

I just made these cookies, but I added my own little twist.  I added some chopped pecans and caramel bits.  I also added two splashes of low fat milk when I added the oatmeal. These are crispy on the outside and soft and soft and chewy on the inside.  They are YUMMY!!!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

I modified this recipe by using half as much butter, then 1/4 cup or do butter flavored shortening, and adding some applesauce. Sometimes rich cookies give me heartburn, and these are simple and delicious the kind of cookies my husband's Grandma makes!

Made this just a little bit ago, and did a few things different. Used Splenda, half ww, half white, and one whole egg, one egg white. Oh, and used more Splenda instead of brown sugar. Health issues demand I use as little sugar as possible. Any ways, yes, the rounder ones were more moist than the slightly flattened ones. Also, in the moist department, only cooked them for 6 mins, and some of them were made with a slight depression in the top, and a touch of fruit jam added before baking. They were awesome...teenager approved, even! I must say though, they really don't seem like cookies, more like muffin bites, that would be great for breakfast with a touch of butter and jam, or honey. My alterations in the recipe could account for that, but regardless, they were great for our purposes, and will be made again. Super after school snack, on the cheap without the guilt!

These are really good. I added some chopped pecans and chocolate chips and I wound up with way more than the recipe said it would yield. I recommend the pecans (or walnuts), they make it come together nicely in my opinion. Definitely trying it with raisins in a few days!

Thank you so much for the recipe. I tried many and this is the one I will keep doing. I just baked them and they are really good. I put half of sugar (only brown) and had to add some milk because it was too dry to get a dough. My son and husband loved them. I just think they have a bit too much of baking soda taste so I will put only 1 tsp next time. Thanks again!

These are great cookies.  Since it's just 2 of us at the house, I cooked a batch and then froze the remaining dough.  I wrapped them into tubes like you see at the grocery store, just sizing them down to a single evening desert for 2.  Wrapped once in wax paper and then a second wrap in foil, each recipe yields about 4 tubes for the freezer for us.  They turn out Delicious every time.   The only changes that I made was I used only 1t of cinnamon instead of 1 1/2t and cooked at 350.

I started making these a few years ago and this is the only oatmeal cookie I will ever make.  I make it exactly how the recipe states, with the exception of flattening with a fork.  They always come out great.  I make these every year during the holidays for family and work, and they're always a hit.  Actually I'm kinda now required by my coworkers to bring them in...lol.  Even my father who usually never would think of eating an oatmeal cookie LOVES these cookies.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

Perfect soft cookies, the only modification I made was to add some peanut butter chips to one batch and chocolate to another. No need to chill the dough before putting on cookie sheets.

Yummy! I wanted a soft oatmeal cookie recipe that I could add chocolate chips and pecans to and this was it! I added a splash of milk and about a quarter cup of applesauce to assure enough moisture for the additions. The cookies came out soft and tasted wonderful. Definitely a keeper of a recipe. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

If you prefer a cake like cookie then slightly flatten the dough before baking but if you prefer a soft and crunchy cookie scoop a spoon size amount (rolling not necessary) then flatten the dough as much as possible.  I thought I should mention that after refrigerating for an hour I rolled the dough into balls and slightly flattened resulting to a cake like cookie.  2 days later I scooped spoon size amounts and flattened really flat resulting a soft and crunchy cookie.  I enjoyed these cookies with a couple of modifications.  I added chocolate morsels and instead of dipping a fork in sugar I drizzled them with honey after "flattening".   If oatmeal were my absolute to die for cookie I would have definitely given a 5 star rating.  Overall this recipe creates a good oatmeal cookie.

My husband was craving oatmeal cookies and I had a ton of oatmeal to use so I gave this recipe a try and glad I did!! The cookies had a thin crust on the outside and the inside was soft. Everyone went crazy for them. Followed the recipe with the exception of not chilling the dough, only due to not enough time, baked them on parchment paper, no greasing the sheets, used a cookie scoop and pressed them down slightly and omitted the sugar.

i was in the baking mood but i was running low on supplies. so i used 1/2 cup oil instead of butter and all white sugar since i had no brown. these were FANTASTIC. super easy to make and easily tweak-able if i wanted to add raisins, nuts, or chocolate chips.

Yummy!  Makes a very thick batter so electric stand mixer is needed.  Followed directions exactly and they turned out great!

Good recipe.  I have found that I don't need to chill the dough.  I don't flatten them either--just walnut size balls which flatten out some with baking.  Really like them with chopped walnuts in them.  Double the cinnamon and the vanilla.  Be careful not to overbake. I baked half and watched them closely, taking them out while they were still soft.  Mother made the other half.  She flattened them, and let them bake until they were firm.  These were still good, but only with dipping so as not to break a tooth.

I have made this cookies a couple of times now and every one loved them. I have shared it with many of my friends and can promise you will like it too. If you like it crispy leave it in oven a few min longer. I liked them soft so 10 min was just perfect for me

I loved this recipe because they are soft and moist vs other recipes I have tried. Not only that but the cinnamon gave it a really good flavor kick. Oh and I would say the sugar's optional because they are fine with or without sugar. Overall great recipe, I'll be making them again.

These were amazing, but didn't come out chewy. The first batch was runny. I added more flour to the second batch, but that still didn't do it. Any advice? More flour next time, perhaps? I like the recipe, but I want SOFT cookies!

Delish!  I substituted applesauce for the butter and 1 C whole wheat and 1 C rice flour instead of all purpose - they are so yummy and moist!  This makes a large amount, I had 30 decent sized cookies and probably enough batter for another 6 or so leftover.  Baked for 10 minutes and then turned oven off and left them in for another 2 minutes or so.  They are just perfectly done for my liking - moist in the middle and slightly crunchy on the outside.

These cookies are delicious.  I have made twice.  The first time I only had 2/3 c brown sugar.  Both times they were great.  They can be mixed the day before.  I suggest if you make changes it just be adding nuts.  Every one that had tasted loved them.  Good for first timer kids to make.

These turned out wonderfully. I never put my cookies higher than 350 degrees, so I set it at that and baked them for about 20 minutes. I didn't grease the bottom of my non-stick pan and the bottoms were just a beautiful light brown color. They were moist, soft and delicious. I added dried cranberries to mine. I just used a spoon to drop them on the pan and flattened them slightly with the spoon. These are going in a gift basket for a friend.

I cut the sugars and salt by half and added 1 cup of raisins. I did not refrigerate them and just used a scooper and flattened them with a fork. They were still sweet enough. They came out soft and yummy.

Easy to make and very tasty. Next day though they were hard as a rock even though they were stored in an air tight container so we just dipped them in coffee like biscotti!

The best oatmeal cookies I've ever had. Even my husband who isn't normally a big fan of oatmeal cookies loved these.

1st time making oatmeal cookies. Followed recipe. Chilled it for 1 hour, halved the batter and added raisins to one half and craisins to the other half. Chilled again for 15 mins. Made small balls and placed on parchment lined cookie sheet. Skipped the fork dipped in sugar.  Baked at 350 degrees and noticed that it took more like 12 mins. Took them out when they had a nice golden color. I had to pop my first batch back in the oven since they were undercooked at 8 mins but ultimately came out great. These are a special request birthday gift, so we are VERY happy they came out so good.

This cookie recipe is very good.  Stays soft for days, and is almost a hybrid of Chocolate Chip Cookies and standard Oatmeal Cookies.

I made these for home and work, and they were an absolute hit! I got multiple requests for this recipe - it has this many reviews for a reason! I omitted the cinnamon by accident the first time I made them (I'm not a big cinnamon fan, so maybe I subconsciously left it out on purpose?) and thought they tasted delicious, so I always make them without cinnamon. I also add chocolate chips every time. For a less messy and quicker option, I use a cookie scoop so I skip the flattening with fork+sugar step. The cookies turn out beautifully every time!

These cookies were wonderfull! I will be making these again and again. The first batch were alittle flat, chewy and too sweet, so I added 1/4 cup of flour and they came out perfect! It gave them volume and fixed the chewy texture. I just spoon dropped the  onto the sheet, they were already sweet enough without the sugar.

Great! If your family is like mine and can't decide between chocolate chip and regular oatmeal cookies, bake the first half of the batch regular and add 1 cup of chocolate chips half way through. This recipe also makes a small batch, I double or triple depending on how many I need.

These were soft and delicious! Just made some little changes: I used only 1 cup of brown sugar(omitted the white sugar) and replaced the eggs with 1 pureed banana.

Just made these to ride out a storm and they are WONDERFUL!! This is the best foundation Oatmeal cookie I have tried. I cut both sugars to 3/4 cup each and sprinkles top with just a touch of cinnamon sugar mixed with a pinch of Pumpkin Pie Spice. Delicious and not overly sweet. They are chewy and tasty...THANKS!

This was easy and fantastic! It was pretty moist to me, but it was a little too sweet for my other family members. These were pretty soft too, and I didn't grease the pan very well, so they stuck. They were soft when they came out so I couldn't take them off immediatly and had to wait 5 minutes.

Great recipe!  1/2 of the batter was given white and black mini chic chips, the other 1/2, I added rum soaked raisins.  Wow!  The raisins ones were AWESOME!  I halved the amount of white sugar in this recipe, by the way.  Thanks for sharing!

Best oatmeal cookie recipe!! Only changes I made: cut back both sugars to 1/2; added another 1/2 tsp cinnamon; added approx. 1/2 cup each of chopped pecans, golden raisins and cherry craisins. They are done perfectly in 8 mins. and sooooooooo good!

The best 'secret' to good oatmeal cookies is room temperature butter (margarine) and eggs.    This recipe reponds very well to that and produced wonderful cookies.

I just made these cookies...got 35 of them instead of the 24, more than what the recipe said.  They are great and next time I will forgo the sugar on the top.
I didn't add any nuts or fruit to them.  Folks will enjoy I am sure.
I did not make any changes to the recipe, followed to the letter.

This is a great recipe for sweet oatmeal cookies. I modified it adding 1/4 cup peanut butter, 1/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips, and 1/4 cup raisins. I also left out the salt. This yielded about 3 dozen 3 and 4 inch cookies.

I just got done baking a batch of cookies and oh my goodness- it turned out so delicious. I had to leave out the teaspoon of salt because I used salted butter. I also didn't press down my dough with a sugared fork because I added some raisins to my dough. To get a nice chewy cookie all I did was roll a 2 inch ball and pressed it down firmly (not too much though or you'll have a crunchy one) and then bake it for 12 minutes in a 375 preheated oven. I decided to make this for my husband who is a flight engineer in the Air Force & his flight crew since they'll be flying early in the morning and I wanted them to have something to munch on during the flight! :) Give this recipe a try and I promise you that you'll love it!

This has to be the best oatmeal cookie recipe I've ever tried.  I added about a half a cup of chocolate chips, which made them even better.  These are fantastic!

These were great. I got 4 doz from this recipe.  Next time I will cut sugar back to 3/4c.  Ran out of oatmeal, so I  used 1 pkg of instant brown sugar oatmeal to equal 3 cups.

These were ok, although I have made better, and they were a bit difficult to bake just right, either ending up raw, or totally burnt at the edges (Probably because they are very thin) I made a few changes and finally got them presentable, but I don't think it was worth the effort.

1) Add 1/2 tsp. Cloves
2) Add 1/2 tsp. Baking Powder
3) Add 1/2 tsp. Vanilla Extract
4) Place on the tray as small balls, do not flatten! (No sugar on a fork - since you don't need to flatten them)
4) Bake for 9 minutes (Cool for three before moving to a cooling rack)

Hopefully they'll be bearable :)

Just ate one (okay, two!) warm from the oven. Crispy-chewy and delicious. Did NOT refrigerate or flatten, just shaped into balls with hands (first spritzed hands with non-stick cooking spray). I did add the raisins (actually a raisin-dried cherry-cranberry blend, soaked in warm water & drained). Also added almonds that I ground in the food processor (~ 1/4 cup after grinding) and 1/2 tsp almond extract. Made these as a gift for a friend but will have to make more for home -- And they won't last long!

An overall great oatmeal cookie recipe, but I also made some adjustments. First I should note, that I halved everything in this recipe because I was baking for a household of two. It made a batch of about 15 medium sized cookies (still more than enough for us). It's my personal opinion that plain oatmeal cookies are boring, so I threw in a large handful of Sun-Maid Raisins.  Since I was cooking at night, I did not have time to chill the dough before baking but I didn't have any issues with it being too sticky and the cookies still came out fantastic. As another reviewer commented, I also did NOT flatten the cookies and did not add any additional sugar. I prefer oatmeal cookies to be golden but still chewy, 9 minutes in my oven worked out perfectly! I recommend baking for 8-9 minutes for softer cookies or the full 10-12 for crispy cookies.  Would make these again.

Hoping the grandkids would eat these, and being sure that most of today's kids do not eat oatmeal, I ran the oatmeal though the mini processor a little bit.  Also added lightly salted peanuts, which ran through the processor as well to make unrecognizable as nuts (those kids!).  Because of the peanuts and using salted butter, I used only about 1/2 tsp salt. Did not chill the dough and used a mix of stevia and splenda and white sugar, but all the brown sugar for its part. Used all the cinnamon and gave a shake of allspice for good measure. Did not flatten or grease the pan.  Thanks for sharing!

These were very good. I made some changes to suit our tastes - I cut the white sugar to 1/2 C and added a 1/4 C local honey. I also cut the brown sugar to 1/2 C, not packed. Still a little sweet, but not too sweet. Also, I add 1/4 C ground flax to almost all of my baked goods, use white whole wheat flour (you can't tell a difference in these) and since I only had 2 C of quick oats on hand, I did substitute Irish Oats for the remaining 1 C. Oh, and I added 1 C of raisins.

best cookie recipe I've found. I recommend the full 10 minutes at 375 degrees and do 1/2 the oatmeal as old fashioned oats and the other 1/2 quick oats, otherwise perfect recipe.

Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe with us Bittersweet1!!!! I used a cookie scoop & air bake cookie sheets (love 'em). Left them in balls and baked for 10 minutes. (Did not refridgerate dough) they were slightly crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside. Made my husband very happy. Making a double batch in the morning. Will put icing on half of them. Taking some to work, I just know I'm gonna become everyone's best new buddy after they consume these...hehe... Thank you once again! Winks!!! Respectfully, birdkitty

I love this recipe.  It tastes like a buttery soft oatmeal cookie with a carmel under-flavor.  I placed white and dark chocolate morsels in the batter.  This really made the flavor even more incredible.  The brown sugar mixed with white gives the cookie a semi-soft texture.  For an even softer cookie, substitute the cup of white sugar with half a cup of brown sugar.

Easy to make and great taste and softness.  I found them a bit bland as I'm used to a recipe that uses cloves but that's an easy thing to add if it suits your taste.  This is a great base recipe especially if you're dividing it into halves or thirds to put chocolate chips in one, raisins and cloves in another batch, etc.  I also like how this recipe doesn't use lard/shortening as I don't usually keep that on hand.

This was an amazing recipe! I followed it as written and the cookies turned out soft, and delicious! My 2n batch I added raisins, and the next batch chopped nuts and raisins and chocolate chips! This recipe is great by itself, but you can add ingredients to fit what you're craving ;) my boyfriend only wants this recipe! Thank you!!!

Very good cookies.  Like others, I did not flatten nor add sugar (in fact I reduced the sugar a bit, which I do in pretty much all my recipes), nor did I refrigerate the dough ahead of time.  They made perfect drop cookies!  Quite chewy and moist.  I also added chocolate chips (ah, there's the sugar!), and we really really loved them.

These are yummy, cute little cookies. I'm not a fan of oatmeal cookies but these are good. I only had 1 1/2 sticks of butter so I substituted 1/4 cup of nonfat greek yogurt for the extra 1/2 stick and used old fashioned oats instead of quick oats then added a cup of raisins after I chilled the dough in the refrigerator. I rolled the dough into walnut sized balls but skipped the flatten with fork step. They turned out perfectly soft and chewy. I'll be making this recipe again.

My whole family loves these cookies.  We've made them at least 3 times since finding the recipe, and they're a hit each time!  I never do the sugar fork thing, and we still have great success.

This was the first time I've ever made oatmeal cookies and they are excellent! I read about 15 pages of reviews and found many conflicting reports. When I made them, I didn't chill the dough, flatten with a fork, or grease the cookie sheets. They came out perfect after 9 min. @ 375 degrees. I think next time I make them, I'll try some of the variations mentioned by others. Thanx for a great recipe!

This is a very simple and easy recipe. It is also as chewy as it claims.But I think that the yield is off because I was able to make 3 1/2 doz instead of 2. To make sure that they were also moist, I added 1/2 cup mashed banana to the mix.

So easy to make and so good. No need to add anything else. Although I would recommend not to add more sugar when pressing them with a fork, they are very sweet. I´ll be making a lot of these.

I looooved this recipe!! I was looking for a soft oatmeal cookie since the ones that I had done before were always very hard!! These were perfect!! I used 1 1/2 Cups of sugar and I think that next time I will use a bit less! I also used less oatmeal, I used 2 cups instead of 3! 
The sugar on top of the cookies made them look fabulous!

This has got to be one of the best cookies I have baked and ate. I cut the recipe in half, and added a cup of raisins. Left the cookies in a little longer, a little crunch and soft. So good! Saved in my recipe box.

These truly are the BEST.COOKIES.EVER!!!  I omit the cinnamon and add dark chocolate chips instead.  Sometimes I'll add a cup of walnuts or pecans... depends who I'm making them for.  I don't flatten the cookies, as recommended in the directions.  These cookies turn out chewy and moist and this recipe makes a LOT of cookies.  I use a pretty big cookie scooper and I still get about 4 dozen cookies!  I make sure I rotate cookie trays, top to bottom and front to back, halfway through baking.  I have baking these down to a science!  Oh, and I don't grease the cookie sheets... there's enough butter in the dough, so they don't stick.  If you love chewy, moist oatmeal cookies, these are for you!!!

Very tasty but I agree with some of the other reviewers... these are very sweet, you could probably use half the sugar called for and still get a very nice cookie, depending on you preference. If you're short on time (which I was), you can cheat a bit and chill these in the freezer for half an hour and the dough will be solid enough to work with.

These are really REALLY good.  Some have said they are not moist but they ARE!  Just don't cook them as long if they are not moist.  Not all ovens have perfect temperatures!  So cook a small amount, test to see if they are chewy and moist enough for you.  If not, LESS time in the oven fixes this and they are soooo WORTH IT!

These cookies are so yummy! I'm an avid baker, and finding something that all my family enjoys, AND was easy to make is hard. But these cookies were amazing! 
I did cut back on the sugars, using 3/4 cup for both the white and the brown, and they turned out perfect. Also, I did find the need to use cooking spray on the pan so the wouldn't stick, but besides that, they were great.
Great flavor and texture! I will surely make them again!

I added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. of cloves and 1/2 c FINELY chopped nuts for extra texture...i left everything else the same and they came out great! 

I baked until the edges were golden brown and that gave me crispy edges and chewy centers...perfect. I accidentally over baked one batch (until they were golden brown all over) and these were also great...a little more crunchy, but definitely great.

I will definitely bake these again!

This recipe is great!  I just made them with my 41/2 yo daughter to give to her preschool teachers.  I cut the recipe in half and added milk chocolate and peanut butter chips.  I also only used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, otherwise followed ingredients listed.  I didn't flatten the cookies either and they came out perfectly flat. A half recipe made thirty 2 and 1/2 inch cookies. They were slightly crispy and chewy!  The best oatmeal cookie I've had in a long time.  We put a stack of six cookies in a pretty cellophane bag and they looked like they came from a fancy bakery!
I will definitely make these again.  So easy and good!

I enjoyed this with a few additions!  I divided the dough in half and added semi-sweet choc chips/walnuts to one half and craisins to the other.  I did everything else the same but added white icing to them once cooled.  I made smiley faces/stars on them and they were a HIT at work!

Hubby and I absolutely love these cookies. I like to pair cinnamon with nutmeg, so I added about 1/4 tsp both times I made the cookies. Excellent recipe, easy and fun to make :). One note tho, first time i did not chill the dough, and the batter spread everywhere... still, it tasted wonderful.

We love oatmeal cookies and these are the best ever; very soft and cakey.  I did not have a cup of butter on hand so used about half a cup of butter or less and added coconut oil to make up for the rest (still did not come to one cup of oil).  Still delicious.  I did use 3 eggs instead of 2.  Perfecto!

I have been looking for an oatmeal cookie recipe like this for so long.  I followed this one precisely.  It is, hands down, the best oatmeal cookie I've ever had.  I can't wait to experiment with adding raisins, chocolate chips, etc.  Thank you for sharing!

I thought this recipe was spot on! Soft perfectly shaped cookies..and not to flat like some butter recipes can turn out..Minor modifications-didn't chill and flatten the cookies with fork/sugar-no need!Tried a batch on the convection setting on the oven and they didn't flatten as nice..even at a lower temp,so would have to tweak if I were to try the convection setting again..Def my go to oatmeal cookie recipe!

This is the third recipe I've tried searching for a soft and chewy, not cakey, cookie, and it's perfect! I make it with white whole wheat flour, flavored oatmeal (peach is amazing) and add dried cranberries, dark chocolate chips, and almonds.

These are very good, crispy in edges and soft in middle. But in Denver and at higher altitudes, I recommend using butter flavor Crisco instead of butter, and reducing temperature to 350 degrees for 9.5 minutes cook time.

These cookies turned out amazing!  Everyone loved them.  I added raisins to half of the batch.  They were really good with and without raisins, but I will definitely add them in next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! I followed the recipe EXACTLY as written, and it was perfect.  I'm not sure why the people that did not flatten them with a fork would think that they would turn out to thin if you did, because that is not the case.  They are still fairly thick, chewy, moist and delicious.  Does make a ton though!

i loved these! I did not chill them, or roll them, just dropped them onto the pan and they turned out fine. like some other users, i split the dough into 3rds, one plain, one with mini chocolate chips, and one with multi colored raisins. they were very soft and tasty - i used sea salt instead of regular salt and i wish i had used a tad more for a little more contrast.. (I did use unsalted butter b/c it was all i had.. so maybe that was it..) - thank you for the recipe it was great and i will make them again!

Ok so I made a gluten free version of this cookie with gluten free oats and flour and OMG I  LOOOOOOOVED it!!! They were moist and chewy and just sooo yummy! Dont over grease your cookie sheet or else they spread too thin and I found that they needed 12 mins to bake esp because I made HUGE balls! also dont flatten the balls too much or the cookies will be too flat but other than that they are delish! I added chocolate chips to mine and I can see myself adding many other things in the future like raisins and nuts! great great recipe !

Delicious!  I added a bunch of raisins (soaked first) but otherwise stuck to the recipe. I froze a bunch in snack bags and took them out as I needed them, and they all tasted fresh and as good as ever.

I used yoga te making cookies because I would either burn them or they wouldn't taste as good! Luckily I came across this recepe and am now in love with baking! I made these cookies for my family, since all in all the recepe said 30 cookies are baked I decided my batter into 3 groups. One was plain, the other was with cranberries and the last one was with walnuts, cranberries and coconut flakes! I deffenetely recommend this recepe to someone who loves crispy cookies on the outside and soft in the center! Thanks

These were okay. Very dry. I added raisons which helped make each bite a bit more moist. There are definitely better recipes out there. Maybe another egg would help???

This is a great recipe and works well GLUTEN FREE.  I used 3 cups of Bob's Red Mill gluten free oats and 2 cups of King Arthur's (I think it is by far the best) gluten free all purpose flour.  To bind it altogether make sure to add 1/4 teaspoon of Xanthan Gum.  Instead of greasing a pan, I always line with parchment paper.  I also left the cookies in the oven for an extra 2 mins ... as baking time is often flexible in G-free baking.  Cool the full 5 mins and then enjoy!

Wow. My husband and I made these and all I can say is AMAZING. We made the first batch without chilling the dough. We followed the recomendations of other reviews and did not use a fork to flatten them. We rolled them into balls and slightly pressed the center. Perfect. The next batch was the dough that sat chilled for 24 hrs. These took a little longer to bake but end result was the same. They are chewy and moist in the middle, and a little crispy on the outside. Baked both batches on parchment paper. I will try raisens or chocolate chips next time. These are incredible!!!!

I'm not into baking but this was easy and quick.  I didn't change anything, this way I know it wasn't my fault if it didn't come out right.   Very good but next time I will add dried cranberrys or raisens.  This is worth a quick bake and nice results.

This was by far the BEST oatmeal cookie I have ever made! I added one cup of dark rasins when I mixed in the oatmeal, did not chill the dough,lightly patted the cookie down with the back of a spoon and baked for exactly 10 minutes. Just perfect! I was able to make 36 cookies dropping by a heaping tablespoon full, cookies where large. 
Thanks BITTERSWEET1!!!

What lovely cookies!  They're not too sweet, they're chewy and yet firm.  Excellent.  

Like everyone recommended, I did not flatten them with a sugared fork.

I have made these again and again, and for someone who can't seem to make a consistently good cookie, this one has NEVER come out bad! I always half the dough, do raisins in half and chocolate chips in the other half-the whole family loves them!

I have been dubbed the Oatmeal cookie QUEEN because of this recipe. Down to the last detail, everything was perfect. I mixed everything in a mixer and the texture in the end was perfect. I will never use another oatmeal recipe other than this one.

These cookies are fantastic. I added a little coconut, raisins and used half coconut and vanilla extract. The only big difference I did.  I was out of walnuts in my pantry. I had made some maple fudge a couple of days before, that was loaded with walnuts. The fudge had turn out like a taffy in texture and my husband wasn't eaten it. So I washed the walnuts out of the fudge and used in my cookies. I removed all of the fudge from the walnuts. But, the maple flavor had soaked into the nuts. This gave the cookies a wonderful  hind of maple. Next time I think I will soak the nuts for a while in a couple of teaspoons of maple extract before adding to the cookies.

I have made these 4 times in the past few months.  With the exception of using regular oats instead of quick oats (because it's all I had) and soaking the raisins for a minute in just-boiled water, I stick to the receipe every single time.  Clearly the best.

DELICIOUS! I made these cookies in 2 batches. The first batch I followed the recipe to the T. The second batch I added 1 cup of RAISENETTES. Both were absolutely delicious! Can't wait to make these again. Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful recipe! I'm super happy with the outcome!
After reading over some reviews, I decreased white sugar to half a cup and cinnamon to 1 tea spoon. I added about 1.75 cups of raisins. Cookies turned out just like I had hoped! Will definitely make these again!

The recipe works with gluten-free flour as well! Mine turned out GREAT. No need to fork the cookies down with sugar... I used less sugar than called for and they are still very sweet. No need to flatten them either as earlier posts warned. Overall, a tasty easy cookie to make!

These are soooo good! I tried not to change much,only adding raisins and chocolate chips. I used pumpkin pie seasoning as I was out of cinnamon, and I actually really liked it that way! The mixture was a little crumbly at the end, so I added just about 1tbsp. of milk to bring it all together. These are perfect!

Great recipe.  Was looking for an oatmeal cookie recipe and this is it.  Pretty soft.  I used less sugar - 3/4 c. of each, and they were plenty sweet for my taste.  I only refrigerated for a bit and then did drop cookies that I flattened a bit with my palm. 8 minutes.  My cookies were smaller and got 3 dozen.

My mother-in-law makes these every year, the only difference is she uses crisco instead of butter.  Yum!!  I made some yesterday, and did the same, then sprinkled cinnamon sugar over them before baking.  I can't stop eating them!!!

These cookies are simply wonderful! They are soft but not too soft. They taste great! My family loves them. My 4 year old loved them, and she is a picky eater, and normally doesn't care for cookies too much.

These were an excellent cookie.  I made half a batch (just 2 of us eating cookies here) and it was so easy.  The only subtitution I made was i was out of baking soda. (of course I didnt notice until I had all the other ingredients together)  I used double the baking powder and omitted the salt and they came out great!  Thank you!

The recipe was easy and the cookies turned out so good. My family loves them. I didn't dip the fork in sugar and I used an exopat instead of greasing the pan. I added organic chocolate chips. They were moist and delicious. I love this recipe. I am not typically a baker and usually stick with savory recipes. This is a keeper. Thanks

These oatmeal cookies were great! I scaled the recipe all the way to just get 6 (can't have too many! I'll eat them all!!) and I got 9 cookies instead. Not that big of a problem, but still tasty. I also popped it in the freezer for 25 mins. instead of refrigerating for an hour. Honestly, that could've been skipped. I made them without raisins but I think I'll add them next time. I also added a bit more cinnamon and some ground nutmeg. Delicious!!

These cookies were so easy to make and they were great. If u want them hard u leave it in the oven for  10 min but if u prefer a softer texture u take them out sooner.My only issue was that the cookies were too sweet for my taste. Drinking milk didn't help mask the sweetness either.

Everyone RAVED about these cookies. I’m still fairly new to cooking/baking, so I know it wasn’t my superior cooking-making ability that won them over! ? I do have a few notes. I cut the recipe in half. After I added the oats, I also added a handful of raisins and mixed them into the dough. I refrigerated the dough overnight, instead of the recommended one hour. When I baked the cookies the next morning, it took about 10 – 11 minutes at 375. Aside from that, I stayed pretty true to the recipe. My husband is already begging me to make these cookies again! Thanks so much for the great recipe. The feedback I got from everyone who tried them really helps to build my culinary confidence. :)

PS - I have never rated a recipe before, but I thought this would be a great one to "pop my reviewing cherry". Heh heh. Thanks again!

I did what some of the others suggested and added 1 1/2 cups of raisins (what is an oatmeal cookie without the raisins?). I also did the 1tsp of cinnamon and the 1/2tsp of cloves. Basically these are some of the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had! Yumm-o!

The best oatmeal cookies I've ever had. Soft and chewy and perfect. I'm normally more of a chocolate fan, but I can't get enough of these cookies.  Every time I make them they get rave reviews. I add chopped pecans to the mix, and don't put any sugar on top.

Loved this recipe.  Made as written (did not dip fork in sugar on top) and rated accordingly.  I love soft oatmeal cookies and to achieve a softer version, after taking them out of the oven I flatten them with a fork so they do not continue cooking...leaves the centre a little on the "raw" side.  In my opinion these taste VERY close to the "Farmer's Market" cookies sold at Real Canadian Super Store in Canada.  Perfect!

Just made this recipe with no alterations but 1 cup of raisins.  Very yummy and soft as promised.  In fact, so soft that if you make them too big they will fall apart.  Keep them on the small side and they're perfect.  The only thing that has be wondering is why does everyone's cookies look so different in the photos?!

Really good cookie. i didn't have quick oats so used regular and they came out just fine. Did not flatten and cooked 9 minutes. They do look underdone when you take them out but don't be fooled. They are not overly sweet, which we liked.

I have used this recipe half a dozen times and I love it.  I use whole white wheat flower and substitute applesauce for half of the butter.  The cookies come out so soft and moist.  This is my go-to oatmeal cookie recipe.

Great Recipe! Followed the given directions and then added:
*just under 1/2 tsp ground cloves
*1/2c of raisins (soaked in a bit of warm water)

I used the #2 "cookie" scoop from pampered chef to get evenly sized cookies. It is a bit larger than a melon baller in size and I did not flatten before baking. They took about 11 min. to cook and five on the sheet to cool. They did not flatten out and they were chewy! :D

My husband and kids LOVED THEM!!!!! Me too!

This was probably one of the best oatmeal cookies recipes I've tried.  I didn't have any raisins or chocolate chips, but I had a bag of Heath toffee bits leftover from Christmas.  I have had several people tell me that these were the best cookies they've had in a long time... even my husband who is a picky cookie eater!  

I didn't find that I needed to refridgerate the dough or flatten the balls.  This is definately a keeper!

These are wonderful little sweet treats! Perfect amount of cinnamon! My 2 year old loves them and so do I! Only thing I'd say is, I got in a hurry on the last batch to go in the oven, forgot to press then down with a fork....not a terribly thing, but they don't spread out, so my last batch were very round, thick cookies. I will eat them....if no one else will! ;)

The flavor of these cookies is awesome!  I would say definitely bake them at 350 for about 8 minutes if you want them softer.  Like most cookies, these dried out the longer they were "leftover" (so I agree with another reviewer, they're not exactly "soft") but the flavor was still great, and you can always microwave them for about 10 seconds to get some of that softness back.

Barely sweet. I didn't squash these and they came out moist and cake-like, but I wish I'd sugared the tops or added more sugar to the recipe. Tasty, otherwise. I'll make these again, but sweeter next time.

GREAT soft cookie!!  I have always used old fashioned oats since I like a hearty texture, but these had a wonderful more even oatmeal texture.   I also DID NOT grease the pans and the cookies can off w/ no sticking! :)  I added white choc chips and craisins... LOVED by all :)

Batter tasted Great! I was so excited for them. And then....Looked in the oven and they were as flat as a pancake..I followed someone elses advice and didn't put them in the fridge or do the last step of dipping a fork in sugar.

Turned out moist and delicious!  I had no butter so I used margerine instead.  I added pecan pieces and a dash of nutmeg for an enhanced flavor.  My husband loved them and so did my 4 yr old!  Will make these again.

Very good! My changes: Reduced white sugar to 2/3 cup (could probably do even less), added 1 1/2 cups raisins, only chilled for about 20 minutes (because I was hungry!) and didn't flatten with fork. Baked about 8:30 to 9 minutes.

The kids love the cookies and give it 5 stars. However I am not impressed  these runny cookies.  Even added more flour to the mix  I live in TX so not sure if it was an altitude issue but the cookies were a total flop.

To me most cookies are too sweet and fattening, so I left out the white sugar and half the butter.  I had to add two cups of water to moisten it enough. They were tasty to me and I was very happy with the results.

Made these last night. They are great! Followed recipe exactly except I used 50/50 butter and virgin coconut oil. They came out nice and moist, then they crisp up as they cool. MMMM!

These were a big hit. Did make some changes, I added 1/4c. more oats, cut back on the white sugar to 1/2c., added a 1/2 tsp. ground cloves, and added 1 c. raisins. baked at 350 deg. for 9 minutes. Don't overbake.

I loved these cookies! I had to add 1/4 cup oats and an extra 1/2 cup flour, but they turned out awesome. They taste great with chocoloate chips! I made a second batch and added a dash of nutmeg, 1 tbs honey and about 1 tsp maple syrup and they tasted even better.

Absolutely PERFECT!  Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  My son said that the texture on the outside reminded him of the edges of brownies!  I did not change a thing in the recipe, and they were absolutely perfect!  Will make these frequently!

Fantastic. Soft and chewy, just like I like them but can never find. I was short 1 cup of rolled oats and tossed in some instant oatmeal - worked just fine. Half my cookies are plain, and half have raisins. The raisin batch needed 2 minutes longer. This recipe is a keeper!

Very good--soft.  We added a bit more cinnamon because we love the flavor.  We used an ice cream scoop to put them on the pan and did not flatten.  They turned out perfectly that way!

First time to bake cookies and the results were perfect... varied the recipe by adding 1cup/80g of raisins that had been soaked in apple juice for about an hour. As a base to begin customising, this recipe is perfect...

Great cookie. I added raisins and a tsp of nutmeg to mine and refrigerated for several hours.  Did not press flat, just baked in balls as they were and they were thick and chewy just like I like them!

Excellent. My picky son does not like chocolate, or raisins, and is allergic to nuts, so this is perfect recipe for him And super moist just like we all like! I also baked right after mixing, did not refrigerate dough, super easy recipe. Thanks!

Like others, I also didn't refrigerate the dough, roll it into balls & flatten. I simply mixed the ingredients & then dropped the dough onto the UNgreased cookie sheet & baked for exactly 10 minutes. These were perfect & just what I was looking for. Next time, I might add some raisins, chocolate chips, nuts, etc.

These were great -- only cooked them for 7 minutes, 8 was too much.... made a fresh batch of homemade buttercream frosting - and took two cookies and made an "oatmeal cream pie"... our crowd was in love with them!

Great tasting, easy recipe. Only used 3/4 c butter and 1/2 c white sugar. Added tons of chopped walnuts and raisins w/ required amount of oats. Dough was still wet so no need to skimp on them. For some reason, my drop cookies were about 1" in diameter and cooking time was longer than others; about 14 minutes. I lightly patted the top of the drops. Cookies were crisp on the outside and moist and chewy inside. Made 45 cookies.

Ummm.... yum! I used 1/2 C butter and 1/2 C butter flavored shortning. And I didn't chill them, or flatten them. Mine took exactly 9 minutes in the oven, and turned out PERFECTLY! They were the perfect "Welcome home from your first day of first grade!" treat! I'll definitely keep this recipe in my book!

These are really good. The only trouble I had was when I rolled them walnut size the middles didn't cook, so I rolled them 1 inch size. Could be me trying to cook in a gas oven when I am used to electric or because I cut the 3 cups of oats to 2 cups and added a cup of raisins. Nevertheless, once I straightened that out I am still very pleased with this recipe.

I made these for my kids and they were gone in about 18 hours.  The only change I would make is to add some extra butter to bring out the buttery flavor.  Also, I squashed the dough balls between my palms and the cookies turned out great.

This is the best-tasting oatmeal cookie that I have ever tasted.  I used unsalted butter, and did not add any raisins or nuts.

So great, these are going fast! I made some with chocolate chips and some with raisins.. those with chocolate chips I'd cut the cinnamon back on but the ones with raisins were perfect. These tasted a tad salty to me but they might not taste right if that's cut back? Anyways - these are very good and soft! :)

Perfect! Just like everyone else, I left out the chilling step and didn't flatten the cookies. They are delicious! I used regular oats instead of quick and used applesauce to replace the eggs (1/4 c. for each egg).

i wasn't completely in love with these the first time i made them.  the more i made them the more they grew on me.  my husband loved them right off the bat.  they are really moist and chewy.  i tried making them plain, with raisins, and with chocolate chips - favorite by far was with raisins.

This is a good start for a recipe. It's nice and soft. I found it to be bland. Next time I'll add a few more spices. I also added about 3/4 cup of semisweet chocolate chips to the batter which I thought  was a good addition.

I persoanlly didn't follow the recipe to the detail. What's amazing about it was because it was chewy. I had used a bit of instant oatmeal [the one for mornigns]. It was quite yummy! My friends complemented me the entire day saying how good it was.

so, so, so, so good......just the dough alone barely lasted as I was baking the cookies.  I used 2 cups oats and 1 cup chocolate chips, the cinnamon taste is really good.  Will be making these over and over again.  As others suggested I only chilled my dough for 15 minutes, no need to flatten cookies, just roll into balls and place on a cookie sheet.

These were fantastic!  Made them exactly to the recipe and then I split the batter and added raisins to one half and chocolate chips to the other.  Great!  They stayed nice and chewy too!

I've always failed at oatmeal cookies, but this was definitely a winner. I tossed in some raisins and they were perfect!

I made these for my son's snack day at school.  All the kids loved them.  They were very soft and I loved the cinnamon flavor.  They didn't make it through the day before they were eaten!

These were really delicious and chewy.  I added half a cup of golden raisons and just a little bit less brown sugar and it was perfect.

I found these cookies to be excellent. I was worried that they would be plain but they had a great flavor. They were soft and chewy the day after I baked them. A good choice of oatmeal cookie for someone who doesn't like raisins, but I'm sure they'd be even better if you added some.

Subbed shortening for butter (was out). Was also out of vanilla: added an overripe banana to make up for the flavor. On account of my changes, cookies tasted amazing, but were perhaps a little chewier than expected. Still, they were so so good, and everyone loved them.

I really liked this recipe. Now I can say that I can make any kind of oatmeal cookie right too instead of just chocolate chip. I made these cookies as oatmeal raisin cookies and only gave it a 4 stars instead of 5 because I made a few changes to increase flavor and for a substitution, and halved the recipe:     I used unsalted sweet cream butter in the Great Value generic Brand (Wal-Mart) (not a change really but wanted to let you know what butter I used)     I added 1/4th a teaspoon of cinnamon (so that would be 1 and one half teaspoons for those using the full recipe)    I added 1/4th a teaspoon of nutmeg (which would be half a teaspoon for those using the full recipe)    I didn't have any vanilla extract left and didn't want to go to the store to instead I used two times the amount of French Vanilla coffee creamer instead.     I also added nearly 1 cup of raisins. (for half of the recipe, which for full recipe users would be almost 2 cups if you love raisins as much as I do or just 1 cup of you're not too crazy about them)    I kept the dough in the fridge for about 3 hours.     As for other changes, I made none. Some say that the flattening of the cookies before baking wasn't needed but I found that mine didn't flatten much at all while baking so I had to.     You turn out with some soft and chewy, flavorful and super moist Oatmeal Raisin cookies cookies. How long do they stay this way? I have no idea because none have ever lasted longer than a few minutes in my house!

I made these for a party at school. I brought 24 cookies for a class of 10. There weren't ANY LEFT. The batter was very dry while mixing it so I added a tablespoon of water.

I made the cookies exactly as the recipe states and I find the cookies to be average.  Don't get me wrong, they were good and soft (even overnight in the fridge) but I felt like these cookies were missing something, maybe more spice or something.  They just seemed...average.

Very soft, chewy and moist. Very good dipped in milk, wonderful comfort food! I used the recipe as directed except for adding a 1/2 tsp cloves and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I rolled the dough into balls and placed on UNgreased cookie sheets.  I used non-stick sheets.  I baked the cookies for exactly 9 minutes and they were not overdone.  The cookies slid right off after 5 minutes of cooling on the sheets.  I could not find my wire rack so just put them on a plate after cooling them on the sheet.  These are nice cookies.

My daughter has made these several times for family, friends, teachers...but doesn't mash them down with a fork, just rolls them in balls and bakes them in the oven.  She is a vegetarian so these ingredients work with her diet.  If you leave them in the oven a little longer like we've done on accident, they are crispy and great.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.  Thanks for posting!!

the taste of these cookies is nice, but I substituted splenda and they turned out really really dry. I was disappointed because I selected them on the basis that they were supposed to be soft and chewy.

I'd give these about 4.5 stars. They were a nice snack for my son's class: kid-friendly but not chock full of sugar! I did cut back on the sugar a bit and I bumped up the cinnamon and added just a little nutmeg. They were nice and soft for about a day after I baked them, but they hardened fast - so eat them quickly! If yours turn out as well as mine did, they won't last long. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

FANTASTIC recipe.   One of the best oatmeal cookie recipes ever.  I did tweek it slightly - I used slightly over 2 cps rolled oats and I added 1/2 cp Bob's Red Mill flax meal and 1/4 cp oat bran, sprinkling of raisins & scant amount of carob chips.    They keep very well.  I also agree that I didn't flatten them - like them nicer when puffy.  Cooked a good 10 min.

I love this recipe! It stays soft and chewy for days. I put about 3/4 cup of sugar and a little over 2&1/2 cups of oats and added in about 3/4 cups of raisins. I shaped the cookies larger which took a few minutes extra in the oven. I made the mistake of overcooking them because they didn't look as cooked. But that left the cookies dry and hard. When I take them out they may look a little undercooked or light but they are perfectly done and tend to darken once they start to cool. Kids love them, my little brother always asks me to make these for his class parties.

This is ABSOLUTELY the greatest oatmeal cookie recipe I have ever tried. Everyone that has tried these loved them so much, that I am now being asked to make them for parties! Great recipe!  The only thing that I do differently is add a little more cinnamon & vanilla. Yummy.

I thought there were fabulous and quite chewy.  I did just a couple of modifications.  I used almond extract instead of vanilla and it gave it a wonderful taste/aroma.  I also used whole wheat flour instead of white.  YUMMY!

I just made these cookies. The taste of them is very good. But they came out very flat and some of them burned. 375 degrees would seem to be way to hot an oven. Next time, I will try them at 325 or 350. Since my family loves Cimamon, I used a tablespoon, which was good for us.

I added some coconut and chocolate chips. They were yummy and stayed soft and good. The recipe made 52 cookies. Mine must have been smaller.

These were great. I did add a pinch more salt and some sprinkles of nutmeg, but they were definitely soft and definitely yummy. The batter makes soooo many cookies! I wrapped half in plastic wrap and stuck it in the fridge for later. I will definitely be making these again.

Ingredient-wise I followed everything on here. I did add 1/2tsp of cloves and 1C of raisins. I didn't flatten the cookies before baking or refridgerate the dough. They were wondeful.

Great cookies if you love cookies dough! The outside of the cookie is slightly crunchy but the inside is doughy like the dough. I love it and will defiantly make it again.

Very tasty cookie! I added a 1/4 cup of wheat germ (for extra iron and protein), omitted the cinnamon, and 1 cup of butterscotch chips (for extra yumminess)! Definitely a keeper!

Delicious!! TRY AND ENJOY If you dont want to cool batter for an HOUR in the fridge put the bowl with batter in it iside the freezer for about 10 min. That's it.  You can skip the fork flattening trick. Cookies are yummy!!!

My husband loves oatmeal cookies, he really enjoyed these. I doubled the vanilla, used half whole wheat flour, reduced the cinnamon to 1 tsp, used 1 tsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp baking soda added 1/2 cup each of raisins and chocolate chips. Did not dip fork in sugar and didn't chill dough. Used my #50 scoop that yielded 44 cookies which baked in 12 minutes on Silpat lined baking sheets. Yield and baking time are way off.

This is a great recipe.  The cookie dough was a little dry, but that may have been my fault (I ground the quick oats because that is how I like my oatmeal cookies).  I just added a little condensed milk until it was a better consistancy.  I don't know what people were talking about when they said there was too much butter and it melted into flat oily cookies-maybe they did not properly chill the dough??  My cookies came out thick and soft.  I did 1/2 according to the recipe and 1/2 wtih peanut butter chips.  Both were delicious.

WOW! PERFECTION! These are the absolute BEST! Even better the next day. They came out exactly like the picture. Perfect texture and flavor. Would not change a thing. Make sure you beat everything for long enough--should be light and fluffy after you beat the eggs in. I added golden raisins and chopped walnuts. Next time I'm going to try butterscotch or PB chips. My whole family went ga-ga for these. Definitely a keeper in my recipe collection.

Awesome oatmeal cookie!  I added 1/2 tsp. of clove like another reviewer recommended.  The only other change I made was turning it into one big, long, 57" cookie just for fun with the kids.

These were really great. I jazzed them up by adding dried cherries, white chocolate chips, and chopped pistachio nuts. The only problem I has with them is they did not spread very well which is why I guess people said to press them down a bit. I'll be making these again for sure.

These were great, followed recipe exact. Didn't flatten the cookies though as I am at a higher altitude.  Separated into three batches, first-mixed dried berries and walnuts, second-maple chips, third-maple chips and semi-sweet chips.  All turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe!

The search is over for Oatmeal cookies!!! I tried so many over the years these are so chewy and just perfect! I didn't have time to refrigerate it so I just baked them and sprinkled sugar on top, also added raisins. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Great cookies! Easy to prepare, and came out perfectly! After I read the last review saying this would be the end of my oatmeal cookie recipe search, I just had to try it. They were right! I made no changes and my family loved them!

Very easy to make. I loved that the dough doesn't spread. I was able to get 13-14 cookies on one baking sheet, which was a relief as I was short on time.

Excellent cookie recipe. I did add a few handfuls of raisins. They turned out soft and chewy, look just like the photo.

I really enjoyed baking these cookies and could tell they would be soft and delicious as soon as I stirred in the walnuts. The first batch was trial and error, overbaked them for a minute. When I baked them for exactly 8 mins, they really lived up to their name...soft oatmeal cookies. Delicious.

So soft, most and chewy. The cookies always disappear very quickly once made. I double the recipe then divide the dough in four and make regular, chocolate chip, raisin and craisin varieties, very good. Will continue to use this recipe for sure.

I followed the recipe except for the freezing and sugar fork part and they were delicious!  I baked for about 9 minutes to keep them soft.  This was the 2nd recipe I found and I wish it was the first- ran out of oatmeal and halfed it all- came out fine!

These cookies are excellent.  I made some additions to the recipe. 1). 1 tsp of butter vanilla extract and 1 tsp of princess cookie dough extract. (Can order extract from Lorannoils.com). 2). 1/2 cup of baking golden raisins and 1 cup of pecans (crushed). 3). Bake for 8 mins. 4). Use parchment paper on cookie sheet

substituted with wheat flour and ended up somewhat dry and firm.  will try a second time with original recipe, but even then, the first batch was wonderful with a little milk and honey.

This recipe is pretty good, but the cookies aren't as moist as I had hoped.  I didn't roll them into balls, but used my cookie scooper and they came out a nice shape.  These took the full 10 min in my oven.  I added raisins to half of the batter and I much prefer the ones w/raisins to the ones w/o.  I will make this again, but will add raisins to the whole batch.

So good!  I added about 1 1/3 cups of chocolate chips and a splash (about 1/2 tsp) of almond extract along with the vanilla.  Following what  other reviewers stated, I didn't press the cookies flat.  They the third pan is just coming out of the oven and omg!  I can't stop eating them!!  So good!!

I made them just as the recipe indicated.  I split the dough and added raisins to part and chocolate chip chunks and walnuts to the rest.  They are both amazingly good.  I rolled into balls and did not flatten, I like thick gooey cookies and that is exactly what I got.  VERY GOOD, they will not last more than a day or two in my house.

WOW! This is fantastic! We halved the recipe to make a dozen and added: 1/2 super-mashed/pureed banana. Talk about amazing! We also tried variations with banana, raisin, and chocolate chip = YUMTASTIC! And, banana, chocolate chip, walnut = YUMMIERTASTIC! I agree with previous reviewers - no need to dip fork in sugar or even to roll them into balls. We just spooned it.

These cookies came out great-I made half with raisins and the other half with choc chunks. I did notice the second batch came out thicker(which I prefer) and I think it was because the dough was in the fridge longer.

Excellent! I split the dough in a half and put semi sweet chips in half..and keep the other half plain. I slightly pushed the dough ball down, slightly! I did not add sugar to it either.  SOOO good.. gone in two days! Soft chewy Delicious.

These cookies are DELICIOUS!! These were my first (successful) batch of cookies and they made me feel like "WOW! I CAN MAKE SOMETHING THIS YUMMY!" I added walnuts to the recipe and I can't stop eating these cookies. So soft and chewy!

As far as the taste goes, you can't go wrong.  They are wonderful!  However, my cookies were not soft.  Even if they looked soft and puffed up when I took them out of the oven, they immediately fell into flat, crunchy cookies.  I didn't flatten them pre-oven as some have suggested.  Someone advised me to use half softened butter, half butter flavored Crisco to give the cookies a softer, fluffier look.

My whole family loves these cookies.  I added a cup of re-hydrated golden raisins as well as just a pinch more cinnamon.  They are easy, fun to bake with the children and get wonderful reviews no matter where we take them!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

I have made oatmeal cookies in the past and they were just so so or hard but this one was the best I have ever made. My husband who is always critical actually loved these and thought they were nice and moist. This is officially my oatmeal cookie recipe! I will however use a little less sugar otherwise everything else is ok.

I liked this recipe a lot ,and will use again , however will cut the sugar by 1/4. I will also try with WW flour and Splenda as suggested. Also, I drop cookies on sheet, they spread nicely as they cook.

This is an excellent basic oatmeal cookie recipe.  Just the right amount of spices, sweetness and saltiness.  I've added chocolate chips, I've tried cranberries, and served them plain.  All versions were a hit.  The only thing I change is to use a tiny bit less of the butter called for, which helps them not flatten out too much.  I will definitely continue to use this recipe again and again!

Great Oatmeal cookies.  I baked them yesterday and so far they are still soft and chewy. Great tasting. I made two batches, one with raisins and one without.  Both are good, but I prefer the raisins.  I as well didn't push them down with a fork before going in the oven, I just kept them in a ball and they still melted down kinda thin. My only con to the cookie is that it didn't stay plump.  I will definitely bake them again, and would set out for company.

Excellent oatmeal cookie!  I added 1/2 cup each of chocolate chips, raisins and coconut.  I also used rolled oats instead of quick oats.

Yumilicious.  I used 1 stick of butter instead of 1 cup.  Also 1/2 cup of white sugar instead of 1 cup.  They turned out perfect.  No need for all the extra calories!  This one's a keeper!  This is a good base recipe that allows you to add whatever you want.  I did one batch with dark choc. chips, another batch with white choc. chips, dried cranberries, coconut and crushed pecans, another batch with raisins, and the final batch with butterscotch chips and crushed pecans.  Fantastic gourmet cookies.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is the first time I've ever made cookies and I just have to say that they came out absolutely gorgeous! I didn't leave the dough to rest, as another reviewer suggested, and just formed them into balls straight away. They are slightly on the sweet side for me so I would reduce the amount of sugar the next time I make them and they would be great with some added nuts/raisins/berries too. But even as they are, they're great, do try the recipe! :)

I almost gave these 4 stars cause my husband liked them.  In my opinion there's waaay too much sugar in this recipe.  The sugar hides the flavor of the oats.  Also, not sure how you only get 24 cookies if you follow the directions?  I scooped mine out into "walnut" sized balls and I got 50 cookies exactly.  There was also no reason to refridgerate the dough.  I think there are better oatmeal cookie recipes out there!

Absolutely AMAZING! I normally make chocolate-chip or sugar cookies for my family and I got a request to make oatmeal. I had never done so, therefor I knew I had to do deep research to find the perfect recipie. I honeslty didnt have to look to far because this was the 4th one I looked at and the 1st one I made. The whole family was extremmly pleased especially my father and his raisins. Haha. But I would defeinatly recommend this recipie to all cookies bakers :] They were soft, chewy, and not have too little or too much sweetness. Enjoy!!

WOW!  Great recipe!  Very easy to make.  I went ahead and added some semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Also, I did not refrigerate or press down with a sugar covered fork.  They did need the full 10 minutes.  I will definitely make this again, this is a keeper!

Excellent oatmeal cookie - moist and chewy.  Added 1/2 less sugar and they were sweet enough.  Also, did not use sugar to flatten cookie.  Will add raisins and nuts next time.

Love this recipe.  I like the fact it just uses butter without shortening or oil. Added a 6 oz. bag of dried cranberries and a couple handfuls of Giradelli's dark chocolate chips.  Very moist with a great flavor.

These are very good and I am addicted to them. I am trying to eat them till I am sick, but so far I just keep making more and more. I bake late at night when I don't have to share and no one will catch me. I added 1/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips, 1/3 cup butterscotch chips and 1/2 cup roasted pecans. Oh boy!!

I just made a batch of these cookies and they were yummy. Although some of my cookies burnt up a lil at the bottom. I suggest lowering the oven to 350 and baking 10-12 mins.

These cookies are really good! I added a cup of walnuts to mine and they are so delicious. You may want to add another cup of flour to this recipe though, the first batch I put in was too flat. Maybe adding the walnuts changed something? Who knows, but they sure are good!

I followed it exactly and they were good.  I did chill the dough a bit and did not flatten them.  I thought the temp at 375 was going to be too high so I did them at 350.  They came out pretty flat.  I have used the recipe on the oatmeal container for awhile and I thought I would seek out something new/better.  The one person that said the dough was dry did something wrong as the dough was very moist/wettish.  I think I would prefer an oatmeal cookie to be slightly "thicker"

I made these the other weekend and they were wonderful!  I did make a couple changes though.  I used whole wheat flour instead of white, Splenda instead of sugar, and I added about ¼ tsp of nutmeg, white chocolate chips, craisins, and chopped nuts.  They were gone before the night was over, and I made them after nightfall!

These were good, but not great. The recipe needed a bit of tweaking. The dough was too dry to for everything to adhere properly, so an extra egg was needed. The bottoms baked too rapidly so the oven rack needed to be raised. The oven temperature needed to be lowered to make them 'soft and moist'...and they are not really a moist cookie. That having been said, they were ordinary, good cookies, not great.

Pretty good. I made them with cranberries and was glad I did cause otherwise they would be a little bland. Also, I pressed some of them flat with a fork and sugar, and left some of them in a ball. The ones in a ball came out much better. They were softer and tasted better.

Made this for me and put it the freezer for future snacks. Started noticing my DH and my health conscious 16 y.o. visiting the freezer more than usual and realized they're after my oatmeal cookies!  Great right out of the freezer.  I added raisins & chopped peanuts.

I absolutely love these cookies.  I add Craisins and white morsels to the cookies.  Also, to keep them moist I put a piece of bread in the container to soak up any moisture.  Fantastic!!!!!

The best cookie I have ever had. My husband and my brother-in-law both agreed. Never changing to another recipe ever. I just shaped into balls, rather then press flat.

These were really good...very soft & chewy. The first batch I made, i didn't refrigerate the mixture & it was hard to roll into little balls so the cookies came out flatter. By the time I made the 2nd batch, the mixture had been in the fridge for a day so it was more firm & easy to roll into balls. After rolling into balls I dipped the balls in white sugar and baked for 8 minutes exactly. I let them cool on the cookie sheet for 1 minute & then moved to a cooling rack. They came out soooo soft, chewy, and delicious! Will definitely make these again!

I usually don't like oatmeal cookies, but these were fabulous! I maked them for 8 minutes only and took them immediately off the cookie sheet to keep them soft. This is a keeper!

Yummy! My family enjoyed them. I'm not that talented when it comes to baking desserts (I rarely eat them), but it's hard to butcher this recipe. Upon recommendation, I used 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of ground clove. I didn't try it with the 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, so I can't tell which is better. I just know that they were superb with the 1/2 tsp of ground clove. I also used 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup of Smart Balance rather than 2 sticks of butter. Gotta keep the cholesterol at bay. It was still great. Thanks for a lovely recipe!

This cookies are so yummy!  I was looking for a recipe similar to the Oatmeal cookies my grandmother used to make, soft and chewy.  These cookies fit the bill and they were so good!  Will definitely be making again and again and will add various things like choc. chips and butterscotch chips every now and then.  MUST TRY!

I had to come up with cookies for a bake sale that I did not know about and was unprepared for - so I had to use several substitutions.  Even with the changes, the cookies turned out tasty, although not that attractive.  I didn't have enough butter, so I substituted shortening for 1/2 of the butter, and I ran out of flour so I used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat.  Due to timing issues, I couldn't chill the dough for more than about 15 minutes.  I used a cookie scoop and didn't flatten with a sugar coated fork.  The cookies flattened considerably, but they were soft.  I also added choc.chips which made them even better.  Next time I will try these with the correct ingredients to see if they turn out prettier

I soaked the raisins in brandy, reduced the white sugar and added a bit of coconut. They were still a bit too sweet for me but the people I shared them with found them to be deadly-delicious and devoured every one. Nice and soft. Best results at about 12 minutes, maybe because of the moist raisins.

This is now my official oatmeal cookie recipe! SO delicious! The ONLY change I made was that I skipped the refrigeration and just dropped them on the cookie sheet with a spoon, no rolling or pressing. Baked for 10 min, and they are so soft and chewy! Next time I will try with choclate chips! Thanks for the great recipe!!

Superb cookies! They are so soft and yummy! I skipped the "refrigeration" and "rolling" step and just dropped the dough by the spoonful onto the cookie sheet.

Great recipe!  I added 1 cup of raisins and 1 cup of chocolate chips and they turned out great.  Next time will try almonds and dried cranberries.

Even better than Beth's.  I didn't use cinnamon, and halved the recipe because I only had 1 egg.  The recipe still yielded a startling 30 cookies, about 2 inches in diameter each. I put them in balls on a disposable aluminum cookie sheet and they shaped into nice thick cookies in the oven, just how i wanted them.  I turned them after 8 minutes and they still took about 4 minutes to brown nicely. They are my new staple oatmeal raisin recipe.

Fantastic! The only thing I would do is cut back the oats a bit next time. After chilling, the dough was a bit hard to keep together in a ball. I added butterscotch chips for some extra flavor and and texture. My family can't stop eating them! I will absolutely make these again.

This recipe is magical--I'm nor sure why it tastes so much better than the suggested recipes on the back of oatmeal containers (being that it is such a similar recipe) but somehow I managed to make the best oatmeal cookies I've ever tasted by following this recipe!  These were delicious~ :)

Very yummy! One thing - I used Irish quick cook oats, and I only chilled the dough for 20 minutes. The first batch didn't turn out very well because the cookies were too gritty; however, the second and third batch were perfect because they were sitting in the fridge while they first cooked. So if you're going to use Irish or Scottish oats, make sure you let the dough rest in the fridge for at least an hour like the recipe suggests.

This was my first time baking cookies and I have to say, they came out FANTASTIC!  The recipe was so easy to follow. I followed it exactly but added  1 cup of raisins to half the batch and 1 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips to second half.  Delicious!  And as others have posted, I got way more than 24 cookies!  Over 60!!  I'm definitely making these again.  Oh I pre-soaked the raisins, made such a difference!  I made the cookies last night and this morning they are still soooo soft.  Love this recipe!!!

THE best and simplest oatmeal cookie recipe out there. I never cool the dough and get fantastic results every single time I make these cookies. You can't go wrong - soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.

Awesome cookies.  The only change I made was that I didn't have one hour to cool the cookie dough so I put it in the freezer for 20 minutes.  Worked great. This is definitely a keeper.

I love these oatmeal cookies.  I have tried several recipes and these are the best.  The only changes I made was using whole wheat flour and adding chocolate chips.  They were so chewy and moist.

Delicious cookies and not difficult to make. Like other reviewers, I didn't flatten mine because I really wanted a soft cookie. I added about a cup of raisins and they turned out perfectly. Thanks!

They taste fine. I added raisins to one batch and chocolate chips to another, but one their own I'm sure they'd be fine too. My biggest complaint is how they cook. My first batch, I kept them in for 10 minutes, took them out, let them rest for five more. When I came to transfer them, they fell apart into mushy globs, as if they hadn't been cooked all the way. So I put them in for a few more minutes. Then they got so crunchy and hard! I just couldn't win with these. Maybe I was just having bad luck, everyone else seems to have such good things to say!  And yes, they flatten like mad on their own, you don't need to flatten them yourself unless you want them to be really crunchy and chip-like.

I've had better...I'll be as 'middle of the road' as I can - it could be that I used 'store brand' Oats, or that I used older Baking Soda; but my cookies were bone dry - I could not even make them into balls to place on the cookie sheet. Nevertheless - they were eaten - noting went to waste. I'm hopeful it was "just me" and not the recipe - I'll find out next time. Either way - oatmeal cookies, even ones that are dry; are still a tasty snack.

Very easy. I added raisins to half of the batch. Everyone loved them and they stayed soft for several days. I would cut down on the cinnamon a little.

These cookies were amazing! When I put the oats on I didn't wanna overbeat the oats so I mixed it with my hands... It was messy but it worked. My family definitely likes this recipe too. After his 6th cookie, my brother told me next time I make cookies they have to be gross so he doesn't feel bad when he eats a dozen a day.

Ok...After reading a few pages (lol) I am off to make these cookies. I have looked at alot of Oatmeal Cookie recipe's and well taadaaa I'm off to do this recipe and will be back to post when they are complete-I'm looking forward to them :) ....Back.... I really like them they are not super soft which is really good as I was looking for an Oatmeal cookie not "cake" But again I wasen't in the mood for a crispy cookie either so I must say good job I really like this recipie. I did put the batter in the fridge for 1.5 hours and I can understand why this is a "key" well now I am just babling but thank you this recipe is definitly going in our "family book"  Now I am back these cookies are fantastic dipped in tea. Happy Cooking all

Oh my goodness, these were fantastic! Instead of using the quick cooking plain oatmeal, I used the pre-packaged low-sugar maple brown sugar oatmeal (because alone it was not tasty) and they came out so good! I saw no need to use the fork, and they came out very chewy and delicious!

These turned out pretty good, considering the circumstances. My mixer broke and I was forced to mix it all by hand which was pretty painful... I'm not all that fond of oatmeal cookies, but these were really yummy. Mine got big and puffy, though... for some weird reason. But that may just be my horrible cooking skills. Also they turned kind of a weird color... but hey they were yummy! :)

I must say, I very rarely add reviews but this was definetely worthy of one. I made this as is for myself and my boyfriend and we loved it!!  12 minutes was perfect and we did not need to press down with a fork.  The consistency was perfect and flavor was perfect.  Great job!!

These cookies were wonderful.  I added dried cranberries instead of raisins and omitted the fork as I like me cookies big not flat...but I did do the sugar, just dip the top of the dough ball in a bit of sugar and they were perfect!

I added about 2 cups semi sweet chocolate chips and a cup of shredded coconut to the recipe and they were amazing. One of my friends even commented that they were blondies good. As in the cookie store. Seriously amazing!

Cookies were soft but not as flavorful as I would have liked and were a little flat.  Next time I'll add a little more spice to them. Good recipe.

Mmmph! These are delicious. The best thing about this cookie is that it's not runny and keeps its shape. I added five spice, nuts, and raisins to mine. I used old fashion oats but I pulsed the oats in the Magic Bullet first.

These were the best oatmeal cookies. they were soft and chewy. no need for the sugar on top, they are sweet enough on their own. I added mini chocolate chips and chopped walnuts. Yummy. Will make again.

These are great! I ran out of time so I refrigerated half of the dough. They were very crumbly and hard to bake the next day, but the rest of the cookies were fabulous.

I made these this morning for my daughters field day at school. The flavor is great. I thought they were a bit on the dry side, but overall a good cookie. I may add a little applesause next time I make them to bump up the moisture. I will also try to reduce the amount of sugar.

I would like to "second" the above comments.  I changed this up and did 1 t cinnamon and 1/2 t cloves. I didn't grease the pan and I didn't squish them with the fork dipped in sugar.  Baked just 8 mins.  My hubby said they're the "best cookies I've made!" Thanks for the great recipe and the great tips!

I made these for my husband since he loves cookies. After tasting the first batch, he requested raisins to be added. Those he devoured and wants them to keep coming. I quit putting sugar on top and flattening them because he loves them chewy.

I'm so happy I found this recipe "again" I made these then tried to make them 2 more times and realized I was using the wrong recipe-one on here for choc chip oatmeal- but there is no comparison-these are my fav-luscious! I didn't chill dough either, or flatten with fork & sugar, and I used parchment instead of any greasing and they came out wonderful!!! I like them better than my mom's! I added raisins & choc chips/walnuts. YUM.

These cookies were delicious!!! Everyone in my class loved them!!! I accidentally doubled the cinnamon, but it still was delicious! I also just used 1 and 1/4 cup of oats and that was enough. They actually did turn out soft. They were done in just about 8-9 min. They didn't spread out much though. It's better to flatten them a little if you want a bigger cookie. Thanks for the recipe!

i tried this tonight to see how it would go and test out on my co-workers.  I have been dieting for the last few months with a lot of success, so I made some alterations much like others.  I used Whoel wheat flour and splenda and it turned out alright.  Next time I will follow others' advice and use less oats.  They ended up not as sweet and very dense.  I will make them again though, just need to tweek it some more.

Very soft & flavorful cookie! I added 2 tsp. of cinnamon and 1 tsp. of nutmeg since my husband LOVES cinnamon and I baked them for only 7 minutes. They came out perfectly soft and stayed soft & chewy long after they cooled. My son also wanted to dust the cookie balls with a cinnamon & sugar mixture after he added blue food coloring to them for fun and they still tasted awesome...SWEET, but awesome nonetheless!!

Absolutely moist and delicious!  I'll add raisins or choc chips next time for some variation and may decrease some of the sugar as they seemed too sugary.  I did NOT chill the dough or flatten with a sugared fork.  Just mix, drop and bake!  I yielded 27 pretty large cookies; so it would be easy to get 36 from one batch - didn't help we were eating the dough too.

Excellent! I actually made these as a bar cookie instead of drop and they were delicious! I pushed the dough out into a jelly roll pan and baked for 28 minutes. I also added some almonds just cuz we like them. I cut them when I took them out of the oven.

Yumooooooo!!!!!! The only thing I would do is not make them into balls,I think making them flat would be better.  I also added some nuts to them,which gave them a nice crunch.

Wowzers those were good! I skipped the setting in the fridge and they worked out fine. A little flat, but my family really liked them. There was a ton of dough and made lots of cookies. I added chocolate chips and lots of raisens! They were super easy and quick!

These were great.  I used a small pampered chef cookie scooper and came out with about 88 cookies or so from the one batch.  I did not used a sugared fork to flatten.  No need.  Added Chocolate chips in half (for me).  Very good recipe.

Excellent recipe!  Better than the recipe on the oatmeal box.  My first batch, I left in the oven a bit longer than suggested since they did not look done.  These still came out good, crispy on outside, a little bit chewy, although maybe slightly dry.  The second batch I took out at 10 minutes, and they set up perfectly the way an oatmeal cookie should be.  Don't be afraid to take them out on time even if they don't look done!

These cookies were delicious!  The only critique I have is that the recipe yeilds waaaaaaay more than the 24 cookies it's supposed to.  I worried that I wouldn't have enough, so I doubled it and ended up passing off cookies on all our neighbors.  Not that they minded...

I followed recipe exactly as it is written exactly that I added 1 C raisins.  Cookies were very good and soft.  I would have rated a 5 but I think the recipe on the Oatmeal box is tastier.

Okay...I have made plenty of "oatmeal cookies" in my day.  I was very pleasantly surprised how great these ones tasted.  I added raisins, that I had presoaked and some crushed peacans. Very good!

These are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made!  I hate it when people add a bunch of ingredients to a recipe and then rate their own version, but this time I did add 1 cup of raisins, and sprinkled in some nutmeg and cloves to my 2nd batch.  They were delicious with the additional spices!  I baked them for about 9 minutes, and they had a nice chewy center with a little bit of a crunch on the outside.  They also held their shape well, since I put the dough in the fridge, and also had a cold cookie sheet to use.  I sprinkled the cookies with powdered sugar and they looked fabulous!

These cookies are delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, added some dried cranberries and walnuts and baked mine for 10 - 11 minutes.  I didn't chill the dough because I didn't have time and I just rolled them into balls; didn't flatten them.  Turned out great!  The smell when they are baking is heavenly!  Next time I make them I will try adding chocolate chips.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I'm not a huge fan of Oatmeal cookies, but really enjoyed these. Since I have a sweet tooth I try to make things that I don't really like to eat so I thought I would make these. Well long story short I couldn't stop eating them.   If you leave them in the oven for just a few minutes more you get the best of both worlds, chewy or crunchy!

This is really chewy. I tried 3 kinds of oatmeal cookies from this site. And I have found this recipe makes the best chewy oatmeal cookies. I think the secret of this recipe is the tempreture of oven and the amount of sugar. When you bake at 350F, the cookies' outside(not only the edge but over all)don't become crispy this much. And when you reduce the amount of sugar, the cookies become just soft, not chewy. I also tried to reduce sugar and flour and add extra oat to see how they turn out. The result is, the dough became more sticky but shaped almost the same when baked(thought they would spread), but the texture and the taste became just soft and flourly(oaty), not chewy. I recommend not changing the amount of sugar, flour or oat and baking tempreture. I think this recipe should have named Chewy Oatmeal cookies.

these were great! my 3 year old daughter helped me out and loved that we could separate the batter and add our different favorites (raisins/chocolate chips) at the end. i definitely recommend adding something. the raisins add just the perfect amount of sweetness. i did not use the sugar on the fork. my husband likes chocolate chips and i thought they made the cookie too sweet, so it's definitely a personal preference. naturally, my daughter likes anything with the word "cookie" in it but it has to be a good cookie or she will leave it half eaten. she ate these and then some!!

These cookies are delicious! I didn't change a thing in the recipe. I made these for my new father-in-law's birthday. Oatmeal Raisin are his absolute favorite.. They were such a hit.. He hid them from the rest of the people at the party!! He has requested that I bring them for Easter lunch.. So, I'm going to try half with chocolate chips and half with raisins! SUCH a great recipe! And really simple!

these were a huge hit!  I only had 2.5 cups of oats, so i compensated by splitting the dough in half and adding a ton of chocolate chunks to one portion and lots of coconut, white chocolate, and currants to the other.  every cookie was finished by the end of the night.

Since it's rather hard to find brown sugar in Indonesia, I just use palm sugar - same brown but kinda different in taste (it has a bit salty taste). The result is just perfect for soft oatmeal cookie. But if you let it baked for longer time, palm sugar makes the cookie harder at the first bite instead of crunchy. So I just baked according to the instruction, and it turned out just perfect!!!

This was VERY easy!! I added fresh ground nutmeg, which added a great spice taste not too overpowering.  I baked @ 375 on parchment for about 10 minutes, the result: a nice golden brown bottom and lightly crisp top perfect with a glass of milk! Enjoy!

These were so good!  Soft and moist and chewy.  Absolutely nothing wrong with them.  I kept them in the oven for 8 minutes and they were perfect.  I did not chill the batter, flatten with a fork, or grease the cookie sheet.  Also, I seperated the batter into three parts.  The first I left as is.  The second I added chocolate chips.  And the third, I added flaked coconut.  All variations were delicious.  I will be making these again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were good upon initial eating after they came out of the oven... after that they were not moist or soft at all, even kept in a container with a slice of bread for moisture they were hard as a rock right away. Will not be making this recipe again.

This is an excellent recipe that we modified by leaving-out the cinnamon and adding about 1/3 cup of crunchy peanut butter. In another batch, we further added chocolate chips - wow!

These are soft and delicious!  I didn't refrigerate before cooking and just dropped the dough on to cookie sheet by the tablespoon.  Cooked for 9 min and they came out perfect!!!! Thank you!

I just made these as in they are still cooling on the rack and these are the best!!! They are easy to make and oh so yummy! The only thing I did different was I used margarine instead of butter and added a cup and a half of raisins.

i have to admit, these are THE BEST cookies i have ever made, and continue to make. The trick is to add some coconut (if you like it). i took some to work, and gave everybody in the dept. one (only 1). and the next day they were beating down my door for them. so i sold them for a .25 apiece! ha ha!!! this is def. a keeper! THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR SHARING!

This is now my favorite oatmeal cookie recipe!  Cookies turn out soft and somewhat chewy.  I used chocolate chips, but raisins would be great also.  I used a small scoop to form the cookies into a ball and then flattened them with a glass which made them nicely rounded.  I will definitely make these again!

This was a fabulous recipe for Oatmeal cookies, they were soft (baked for 8 minutes ONLY) and flavourful. I added no raisins or nuts, but a little cinnamon and cardamom. I also only used 2/3 cup of white sugar. I didn't find they needed to be chilled at all, even left to sit on the counter for 10 minutes left them easier to handle. Great cookies! thanks!

Delicious cookie. I did not flatten with sugar, these are sweet enough. In a second batter, I added some raisins and walnuts. Great cookie!

OMG!I love this cookie recipe.I made the dough last night and just had to back a few this morning to try it out.I did add a dash of nutmeg and a little more vanilla because I ran out of the real stuff so I added a tablespoon of the imitation stuff.other then the fact that my pan id a  very dark one i cooked them at 350 for 8 minuets.they came out moist and fluffy and chewy.the perfect cookie.Thanks for the recipe.

in the last 2 weeks, i have made several dozens of these cookies....  AMAZING!  everytime, i follow the recipe exactly, and usually throw in a handful of chocolate chips.  if they come out too dry/ hard, reduce the baking time.  my husband likes them on the chrispy side, my daughter on the soft side, i've made both.  really great cookies!

I added toffee chips to the batter and my kids just loved them. I felt they were to oily and not as soft as I like. First batch turned out crispy, so on the rest I turned down the heat and only kept in the oven 7 minutes. They were soft, but almost seemed uncooked to get that way. This recipe did make a bunch of cookies, which is good for me with having 4 kids to feed. Probably won't make again unless I take omit some butter and add applesauce.

These were the exact style of oatmeal cookie I was looking for.  Soft, fragrant, sweet and salty.  Reminded me of my youth and now they will also remind my boys of theirs.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I added choc chips (my boys don't think cookies come without them).  They were a big hit.  Thanks for sharing.

Recipe as is is a great start for delicious soft oatmeal cookies. We made one batch as the recipe calls for and another with rasins and chocolate chunks We prefered the cookie with the add ins. Cookies were soft like the recipe says, even 2 days later.

These tasted really good. I made just like the recipe, but added dried cranberries and chocolate chips. I used butter flavored crisco, instead of butter. My only complaint was that the dough was really crumbly and hard to form into balls. The baked cookie stays together well though. The crumbliness might be my own fault for skipping the refrigeration time. Next time, I would put them in the fridge like the recipe and see if they are less crumbly. Thanks!

Refrigeration is really key for this recipe.  I made it once with refrigerating the dough and once without and the first batch was better.  Craisins and extra cinnamon went really well with this recipe.

Followed this recipe to a tee, but added raisins. The cookies turned out too sweet for my taste, but the hubby seems to like them. I will try this recipe again, but reduce the sugar.

Delicious! I added raisins to mine. Next time I will bake them a little less than 10 minutes because I found them a little too crisp. One of my friends even came over a few days later just to have more!

I loved these! I added a package of semi-sweet chocolate chips and they were delicious. They stayed soft for quite a few days too, just store them in an airtight container.

Delicious! Four days later they are still soft! Perfect recipe to use for chocolate chip cookies. I divided the dough in half and wrapped each in plastic wrap and refrigerated for l/2 hour, it was just the right consistency to work with.

DELICIUOS!!! Great texture! Chewy, yet held it's shape. Hard to find a good cookie without shortening- this is IT! This cookie would be great just as is, but I added 1 cup softened raisins, 1/2 cup Chocolate chips and 1/2 cup chopped pecans. YUMMY!!! They are awesome!

I love the cinnamon in this recipe! We have done with plain, with raisins and with chocolate chips! They were all good! I also flattened out the little balls and put them on a cookie sheet lined with wax paper to freeze and baked later. It worked great! (I did not refrigerate the dough first)

This has been a favorite at our house for years. Try replacing the vanilla with a tablespoon of maple flavoring. It gives a wonderful twist to a wonderful recipe.

Great recipe! The cookies are delicious and so is the cookie dough. I added white chocolate chips and cranberries to one batch, chocolate chips to another and raisins to another. They all turned out wonderfully! Definitely going to make these again...

YUM!!!  I just finished baking these and we absolutly love them.  I followed the recipe but gave up on the fork with the last batch and used my hand which is easier for my 7yr old.  I did half with 1cup raisens and half with 1 cup chocolate chips.  Next time I will put more of both in. A very easy recipe the only hard part is putting it in the fridge for an hour and yes not eating the dough.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

This is a great receipe that I will defintely use again and again. I added a touch more cinammon than the receipe called for and also chocolate chips. I only had old fashioned oats on hand and I used those. I put them in the food processor first so the oats would not be so big. They turned out great! Love, love, love this receipe.

Great recipe. To decrease the fat, I used 1/2 whole wheat flour & 1/2 white flour and instead of 1 c butter, used 1/2 c apple sauce & 1/2 c low fat margarine. But then I also added 3/4 c. each choc chip & raisins. Also, instead of making cookies I spread the dough in 16x11 pan. Cooked for 25 minutes and it came out great!

I'm new to baking and was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to make such delicious cookies! I don't have lot of fancy tools and for these I only had a fork, spoon, measuring cup, ikea mixing bowl and a small toaster oven. Anyone can make these! I like my oatmeal cookies chewy so I didn't flatten them after they were scoped onto the baking sheet. The result is a crispy shell with a chewy center, which is exactly what I wanted. I halved the ingredients and also changed the sugar/brown sugar to 3/4 cups of white and added one table spoon of honey (since I don't have brown sugar). I also added some dried cranberries. I've always wanted to make my own oatmeal cookies and not have to spend a bundle on gourmet store bought ones...thanks so much for this awesome recipe!

Very good!  I ended up putting these in the oven at 350 degrees for 10-11 minutes, to keep the bottoms from getting too crispy.  They turned out perfect.  So delicious, soft and chewy.  I also couldn't stop eating the batter.  Oops!

I need to try this recipe one more time.  The texture was good (soft with crisp edges), but there was too much of a buttery taste.  I'll have to add more raisins next time - maybe 2 cups.

i must have done something wrong. There was not much taste. Need to add more spices. They also were not chewy. My husband liked it as he is more of a lover of bland food in terms of dessert. Think I will stick with my mom's recipe  made again and changed my rating from a 3 to a 5. My family keeps asking for the oatmeal cookies including my inlaws. I make some plain, some with raisons and some with chocolate chips.

These are very good cookies.  I didn't have quiet a cup of raisins so I added some white chocolate chips with the raisins, and i also added about 1/4 teaspoon of allspice. My family loved them.

This was my FIRST time baking oatmeal cookies and it came out delicious! I substituted white sugar with Splenda (cant even taste the difference!) and I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose since I had it on hand. In addition, I added some Craisins. It is true that the cookies do not flatten much in the oven, so flatten it beforehand to approximately however thick you want the cookies to be. I made it a little thicker because I prefer chewy and soft oatmeal cookies rather than crispy.  It did take the full 10 minutes to bake. These were so good and  easy to make, I'll never buy oatmeal cookies again!

I've made these twice since finding the recipe last week.  My previouse attemps at oatmeal cookies resulted in flat and greasy or dry and flavorless lumps.  These were perfect!  I added diced dates the second time and they were great. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Excellent taste!  The only change I made was to substitute the butter with "I Can't Believe it's Not Butter."  You can add in extras such as chocolate chips or raisins, but these really are wonderful as is.  I also thought the amount of cinnamon was just right.  Thanks!

These were OUTSTANDING, and got rave reviews at the Christmas party.  I think the one-hour layover in the fridge is what really does the trick.  It gives the oats a chance to suck up some moisture and soften.

I made these with steel cut oats the first time and while I second guessed my decisions they were PERFECT! The second time around I used quick oats. I liked the steel cut the best.

Yum Yum!! These were perfectly moist and soft, yet held their shape well! Be sure to flatten them with fork (or hands). I added cut-up spice drop candies  plus 1/2 tsp ginger and 1/2 tsp nutmeg for a festive christmas touch and they flew off the plate at a gathering before I could get back for seconds! Thanks for the great recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly and these turned out great.  I kept a close eye on them so as to not overcook...they were chewy and yummy--- froze and cooked well to.

YUM! These are fantastic cookies!  I made these cookies for my husband (as I'm not a sweet fan), but these cookies were SSSOOO good - I'm now a huge fan, and have eaten several of them!  Perfect in every way.  The only thing I did was add a little nutmeg and chopped pecans.  NUM - and they cooked perfectly.  Definitely a 5* keeper in our house!

Fantastic!  I added a cup of raisins and a dash of nutmeg.  That's it.  My kids are eating them fresh off the cookie sheet.  My super-finicky son is gobbling them up!  (The only other thing I did differently was I lightly ground up my oats in an electric chopper before adding to the flour mixture. I don't like big oats in my cookies.) Great recipe!

I didn't change anything with this recipe, except that I didn't use a fork to mash the cookie dough balls down, and I cooked them for 12 minutes. The cookies turned out sooo wonderful!!!

Great recipe!  The whole family loved them.  I used dried cherries instead of raisins.  Also, I did not chill the dough or flatten the cookies and they turned out perfect.  This will be a regular cookie at our house.

SOO good! I substituted the 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar with 3/4 c sugar and 1 1/4 c of sugar. I also didn't flatten them. They're so good and very moist!

These were the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made. The ingredients were simple, the directions were straight forward, and it yielded large cookies that had slightly crispy with a soft center.  This recipe is without a doubt a keeper.

These cookies were pretty good.  I made a few changes.  I used 1 C. butter flavored Crisco + 6 tsp. water.  I also used whole wheat pastry flour (lighter texture than regular whole wheat flour) in place of the all-purpose flour.  I decreased the white sugar and brown sugar to 3/4 C. each.  The cookies were still plenty sweet.

These cookies are awesome! Mine came out soft and moist. I added some chocolate chips (1 1/2 cups) and then added less oatmeal 1 1/2 cup and it was the perfect amount. I also used the suggestions above, less salt, haft the amount and slightly less sugar which made them perfect. They didn't even last day at our house:) Don't pass this recipe by!

"The Best" is right! They really do stay soft! I didn't refrigerate the dough but i did flatten them slightly with my palm before baking. They puffed slightly and didn't spread too much. This one of the few recipes i've tried so far where i've been totally satisfied with the results!!!

My husband is a fanatic for anything "Oatmeal Raisin" flavored...especially cookies!!!  I've been making the recipe on the Quaker Oatmeal box for years, but I'm living in Australia and can't buy Quaker here so I decided to look for another recipe online...oh my goodness, WE ARE SO HAPPY I did!!  This is now our new favorite cookie recipe and I'll never search for a new one again!

Very good! I added some nutmeg and also a little extra flour after the first two sheets, as they "melted" some before they cooked fully. I also threw in about a cup and a half of craisins, which was really tasty. I'll definitely make these again with my alterations!

Great recipe!!! My kids did not want to try them because they were oatmeal.  But I saw them sneaking them off of the cooling rack.  They came out perfect.

MMmMmMmMmmmm they are so tasty!  I hate crunchy cookies and I manage to get a soft, chewy oatmeal cookie out of this recipe every time!  I always add white chocolate chips - but this makes it very sweet so try it only if you really enjoy sugar! =)

Im not to exited about oatmeal cookies but these had me sold. I made them twice. First, with quick oatmeal and found that the cookies melt in mouth and second time I used the regular oatmeal and found that these were equally delicious but had a thicker consistency. Thanks for this recipe. next time I think that I am going to soak the raisins in rum! yum!!!

Excellent- the structure of the cookie was soft and moist- really ideal. I added a few handfulls of raisins, 1 tsp allspice and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I also like big cookies, so I used 1/4 cup as my scoop and baked 15 minutes.

a really nice, chewy cookie. i only had regular rolled oats, so only added 2 cups for fear they wouldn't be done enough if i added the whole 3 cups. i think it'd be safe to add the whole 3 cups next time. will definitely make these again.

Delicious! I substituted pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon & added 1 cup of white chocolate chips, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. They were moist & went over quite well with my hubby (who normally is unenthusiastic about oatmeal cookies). Yum!

MMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmm! Yum!  Wonderful!

Also if you leave out the flour and bake on a baking sheet for the same time, you'll get PHENOMENAL granola to sprinkle on your ice cream, yogurt, or cereal....this was a super mistake that we made....2 recipes for one!

Really, really good especially when warm.  This made a ton of cookies, had to give some away to neighbors.  Husband who doesn't really like oatmeal cookies, thought that these were great too.  I didn't press the cookies down and added raisins.

These are easy and right on.  I like them about 9 to 10 min in my oven.  I did not change a thing in this recipe.  I did use my medium scoop from pampered chef and I have about 36 huge cookies.  O I did add 2tbs of flax meal, just because I try to do that to most baked items.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These were delicious.  I added 1 cup choc. chips to mine.  You don't need to refrigerate, roll into balls or flatten.  I just used my Pampered Chef Med. Cookie Scoop and they were perfect.  My 15 month old kept begging for them.  I had to hide them.  Hubby and daughter loved them too.

I just made these cookies for my family and they are phenomenal! The best thing is I got 48 cookies (not tiny small ones, either!) from the recipe. I am baking on a very frugal budget and that was a great bonus. I made 36 cookies according to recipe and the remaining 12 I added cranberries and walnuts. Scrumptious!

Very tasty cookies! I followed measures exactly adding brandy-soaked raisans and choc chips and they were gorgeous! I left the dough in the fridge over-night (because I intended to cook them the next day) and didn't flatten them with a sugar-coated folk. They were sweet enough for me, just right. I made 26 good-sized cookies from a 24 serving recipe.
Highly recommended!

I gave these cookies a second try and they turned out wonderful. I cut the cinnamon to about 1/4 teas and only used 1/2 teaspoon of salt. They turned out yummy. Easy to make. I'll def be making them again.

Excellent Cookies! Super easy/simple to make. The first batch of cookies I've ever made with my two year old. We didn't change a thing as far as ingredients and amount (except for when he became a little overzealous with the cinnamon). We didn't refrigerate, grease the pan, or flatten with a fork. They were still wonderful. Thank you so much for the recipe.

These cookies were very easy to make. Really all you need is one bowl. They are very moist. I put regular raisins and golden raisins for those who like more than normal because then your cookie doesnt look like only raisins but you get the extra. It also made about 40 cookies rather than 24. You should try them.

These were great! The only thing I changed was instead of 1 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, I used 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of cloves.  Yummy. I did half of batch with raisins and the other half with chocolate chips. They were both amazing.

yum! Even though I didn't think these cookies are very soft, I took them out at 8 mins, they are still delicious. The taste totally makes up for the crunchy-ness. I did not press mine and i wouldn't recommend doing so. I made chocolate chip and raisin chocolate chip. The raisin chocolate chip tastes like chocolate covered raisins!!! definitely try this recipe.

These cookies are so amazing! Mine turned out kind of spherical because I didn't smush them down. I added cranberries and chopped pecans, and they're really great! I'll definitely be making these again, with different additions. I'm thinking about chopped coconut next time...

Great cookies, easy recipe.  I did put the oats in a food processor to have a finer texture in the cookie.

These were very good cookies.  I took others' recommendations and reduced the sugar.  I added a cup of white chocolate chips and they turned out wonderful.

These were great. I doubled the recipe and made a ton of big, chewy cookies. I added golden raisins, beside that I stuck with the recipe. My kids, husband all loved them. (And they don't typically like oatmeal cookies.)I found you need to cook longer than 8 minutes, but my cookies were pretty big.

too much oatmeal and not enough cookie. i have had much better. if you want a cookie that tastes like a granola bar this is perfect, but at the same time you should probably just look up granola bar recipes.

Excellent!
These were a big hit and remained soft for several days. The second time I made them I made the following changes:
-decreased butter to 1/2 cup
-added 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce in place of the add'l butter
-used 1 cup of white flour, and 1 cup of whole wheat flour
-added: 1/2 cup raisins, 1/4 cup sunflower seeds, 1/4 cup pumpkin seeds, 1/2 cup flax, and 1/2 cup walnuts
-I placed them 1 inch apart as they don't spread much and I didn't flatten them with a fork. They come out like cupcake tops.
-I reserved some of the cinnamon to sprinkle on top before baking to give them a nicer appearance.

Pretty good cookies, I added raisins for sure. They are soft and chewy just how I like them.  The only thing I didn't do was I didn't put them in the fridge at all, I just made the batter and spooned the batter onto cookie sheets and baked.

Really easy recipe and nice cinnamon flavor without being too overpowering.  One note, though - this makes a TON of cookies.  I will halve it in the future!

Holy Cow!!  These are the most awesome oatmeal cookies I have ever had the pleasure to taste.  Only change I made was I used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon as that's all I had.  This is my permanent oatmeal cookie from now on! Can't wait to try with raisins and chocolate chips!

Okay so I never write reviews but this was an AWESOME cookie for even someone who is not a chef.  I was really wanting an oatmeal cookie that you would see out at the mall or Starbucks... So I made the cookie to recipe and spooned it by the heaping tablespoons onto my baking stone.  I was a little skeptical because it was a wet consistency and I thought I bet this cookie won't rise ( I have had plenty of homemade cookies that looked like a flat pancake).  However, in nine minutes I had the most beautiful looking and best tasting cookie out of the oven.  My kids are eating them right now and they are a hit!!  Will keep this recipe permanently.

I added about a cup of white chocolate chips, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  The cookies turned out wonderfully soft and chewy.  The oatmeal adds great texture.  The cookies may appear under-cooked, but after cooling, they firm up and remain chewy.  Overall, this was a great recipe.

Great recipe and easy to make.  However, for Asian baker, I would recommend you to reduce the sugar.  I found that American recipe are usually too sweet for Asian taste. After I reduce both white and brown sugar by 1/4 cup, it is still too sweet for us. Nonetheless,  I still give five star coz it is a great recipe and taste good (if less sweet) and we can't blame others with difference sugar taking level.  I will definitely make it again with less sugar!  Thank you.

Oh yeah!!!  Quite possibly the best cookie ever!  I shorted the sugar just a bit and added some raisins and chocolate chips, other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  The one thing I will do differently next time is to use unsalted butter.  Or if I do use salted butter, I'll omit adding the extra salt because I can taste a tad more salt than I would like to be tasting...but I know it's my fault for using salted butter so I still give these cookies a 5 star because they are just awesome!  They came out all fluffy and soft and chewy, I've never been able to get my cookies to turn out this way, so I'm totally excited about this recipe, it's definitely going in with my all time favorites!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This cookie recipe is awesome! I would put 6 stars if that were an option.   I made them smaller than called for so it made one shy of four dozen.  They were moist and so good.  I added chocolate chips and Reese's Pieces. I highly recommend them.

I made these with my 6-yr-old daughter.  We separated the dough into three parts and mixed one with raisins, one with dried cranberries and the biggest one with chocolate chips.  They're delicious!

I love this recipe. I've been looking for a good cookie recipe that is both perfectly yummy and easy to remember so I don't have to yank out the recipe every time I wanted to bake cookies. I made walnut sized balls and the recipe yielded 30 palm sized cookies. I flattened 12 down, dipped them in sugar  and froze them for later use and those turned out just as good as the first batches. Great recipe!

Made a huge batch of these, in 1/2 I added chocolate chips, and the other 1/2 white chocolate chips. Also added gr. cloves as another rater suggested. Did not like the flavour, think it was the cloves, and found them salty.

Only gave 3 stars due to odd taste, but then again, I am not the greatest baker.

These are very good.  I added walnuts and raisins to it.  There is no need to refrigerate these if you have a cookie scooper.  It makes it very easy.

Yummy! I also played with the recipe, only added 1 tsp of cinnamom and 1/2 tsp cloves as one member suggested. I added raisins, did not chill the batter or flatten the balls of dough with a fork and they turned out great. I also never grease any pan, I always use parchement paper to bake on and would not bake without it! So the cookies were great, Thanks!

Really good cookies.  Even the dough tastes good to eat.  The cookies didn't stay as soft for me.  I ended up cooking longer as I couldn't lift them from the sheet (needed to let them set on sheet longer after taking them out of the oven... I was impatient and wanted cookies NOW, so cooked longer so we could handle quicker)... so that was likely the reason they weren't as soft.  Good flavor.  We like both hard and soft cookies, so being crisper was OK with us.

They came out perfect! Although I accidentally put baking powder instead of baking soda. Next time I may try to cut back on some of the sugar for a healthier version! Awesome cookies!

I made these for my family, and they love it. I did use 1/2 cup less white sugar, and added raisins. Oatmeal raisin is my favorite, and I don't have to buy store bought anymore.

This recipe is so good. I didn't bother refrigerating the dough so my cookies came out a little flatter, but still very chewy! I also used craisins instead of raisins and the flavor is great!

Mixed the main ingredients and separated in half - one half I added  cinnamon and walnuts and the other half I added pecans and choc. chips.  Both were good but the cinnamon walnut version was the winner.  These are excellent cookies and everyone loved them!  Thanks for a great recipe!

These are the first oatmeal cookies I've ever made, and I'm incredibly pleased with how they've turned out.

And I'm telling you, the dough is almost as good as the finished product.

This has to be one of the best recipes I have used for oatmeal cookies. Soft, yet chewy. Perfect consistency. I did not chill for an hour, but put in the freezer for 30 minutes and dropped by teaspoon full and flattened slightly with spoon.

Taste was great!!The only thing I did not like was the color of the baked cookie ~ my hubby said it looked like plaster of paris!

I would make again.

This recipe is so awesome! I have made it many times and my family ALWAYS wants more!! i love the cinnamon it makes a big difference than the other recipes that i have tried that don't include it. I havent made many changes, i just add slightly more baking soda and 1/4 cup(or more depending how i feel) extra of quick cooking oats to make them cookies more oaty! Everyone raves about them, and loves the softness! thanks so much for sharing :)

I added some dried cranberries and chopped pecans.  Maybe that was the problem.  They were just okay for me.

My family loved these cookies.  Added a bit more flour, some left over semi-chocolate chips, macademia nuts, dark chocolate, walnuts, and extra vanilla extract.  Delicious!!!!!  My husband ate most of it right after they were done baking.

UPDATE:  Just made these and OMG!  So delish!  Made some more changes.  1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of applesauce.  1 cup of brown sugar.  2 tsp of vanilla.  2 cups whole wheat flour.  2 tsp cinnamon.  2 eggs.  1 tsp baking soda.  1 tsp salt.  3 huge cups of oatmeal.  Did not flatten or refrigerate.  The cookies came out moist and did not get flat like a pancake.  Surprisingly the cookies rose high and all I did was roll them in balls onto a parchment paper.  Added tons of raisins and my 1 year old and husband devoured so many for dessert.  ^_^  Will make often and will try it next time with no butter...just applesauce and less sugar.

These are fantastick!! I only gave them only 4 stars because they fell flat when they cooled. I baked them for about 12 min. becuase I like them with crisp edges and chewy centers. Perfect for dunking in milk. I would try these again.

These are absolutely the best I've found so far. Even beats out the Quaker Oats recipe found inside their container top. I did make a small change however, in my second batch I added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg for a little added kick.

I think I really needed to used quick cooking oats rather than just regular rolled oats...but either way, my cookies still turned out delicious!  Very easy recipe, very chewy, and not too sweet like alot of other recipes out there.  Just watch out with the stickiness of the dough, definitely don't try rolling it into balls, just try sculpting balls with a fork and spoon on your cookie sheet.  I'm thinking next time I'll throw in some butterscotch chips instead of the usual raisin/nut combo.  Overall one of the better oatmeal raisin cookie recipes I've come across!

This was my first attempt at making oatmeal cookies and they turned out great!  I used a little less white and brown sugar and added some chocolate chips.  I baked them for 8 minutes and they were a little *too* soft for my liking so next time i'll bake them longer.  Overall, they were very tasty!

These cookies are excellent! Soft, chewy, moist, sweet... Yum! I substituted WW flour for the AP flour and kept everything else the same. I had no nuts or raisins so was a bit worried they'd be on the plain side but they're fantastic. Also, I tried both ways, flattening with a sugar dipped fork, and not flattening them and the non flat ones were that tiny bit better.. This is the 3rd cookie recipe I've tried from this site and these are by far the best : )

I baked these cookies for a project I was leading at work and they were a HUGE hit! One of my co-workers even commented that if the nursing thing doesn't work out, I'll always have a future in baking...funny, cause I'm a very novice baker! As suggested by another rater, I added chocolate chips to half the dough and craisins and white chocolate to the other...both very good choices. I also used 1 cup ww flour in place of 1 of the cups of white and they came out really really good.

Great cookies - soft but not so soft they stuck to each other & tasted great!  Everyone else loved them!  Plus, while this dough was refrigerating, I was able to use the time to bake my choc chip cookies, so this recipe helped me manage my time a lot better too!

These oatmeal cookies are the best! Soft and moist, very yummy. I followed the recipe, except subsituted 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 cup of the butter, and added about a teaspoon of fresh ground nutmeg. They were a big hit with my husband, who is already asking for more! Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I liked this recipe, but I guess I prefer a little bit lighter and crispier oatmeal cookies. These ones were a little thick and dense. That is all personal preference though. I took them out a little early to make sure they were nice and soft and they set up nicely. My family really liked these too. They were gone the next day. Overall, very good, easy recipe.

What a great recipe!! Best oatmeal cookies I've ever had. The first batch I made, I added cinnamon chips...absolutely fabulous!! Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find them since. I've made these with Splenda, reg. sugar & with both & they taste great either way.

These cookies were great.  I made some changes which included reducing the salt level to 1/2 teaspoon and the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon.  I added 1 teaspoon of nutmeg and the flavor of the cookies great.  I added a 1/2 cup of raisins.  I did not chill the dough after preparing it however it was not sticky at all.  I used an ungreased cookie sheet and baked the cookies at 350 degrees for 12 minutes and they were a nice color and chewy.

This is a delicious cinnamony oatmeal cookie.  Some of my cookies were chewy because I cooked them longer and some were very soft.  Both are yummy!  No raisins for us and they turned out just great. Thanks!

I really loved this recipe. I made them and while they were chilling in the fridge I watched a movie! I baked them a little less than they say to because they were getting really dark and too crispy so my last batch was perfect and chewy I will use this again for sure

This is a great recipe. I didn't have vanilla, but had some vanilla sugar, so I used that on top of the cookies. Couldn't really even taste that I left out vanilla in the mix. For the best soft cookies, don't cook more than 8 minutes!

I couldn't believe how good these turned out. I baked them for 8 minutes, and they were a little crispy on the outside but *perfectly* chewy on the inside.

This turned out GREAT! I added toffee bits to the cookies as well but they would have been delicious anyways. I shared them with coworkers, friends, dog walker and received compliments from all. They stay so moist that my friend found one in her coat pocket days after I gave it to her and it was still soft and delicous.

These are awesome.  I only had 2 cups of oats on hand so I substituted 1 cup of Wheat Germ.  My dough wasn't chilled so I didn't mash the balls down with a fork and they worked great. They set up very chewy and after sitting out until the next morning were still soft and delicious.

Great and easy recipe.  I did not wait to cook cookies and did not have trouble with them being too sticky.  I did let my 5 year old sugar-fork the top which he loved doing.  Will definitely do again!

This is a great cookie recipe.  Very soft cookie.  Just the right amount of sweet/salt combination.  Good brown sugar taste.  I used half whole wheat flour, and I think I'll use all whole wheat flour next time.

Passed the test! Besides the adults, the picky 13 year old boy and the picky 8 year old girl thought they were soooooo good. I goofed and never noticed it said "quick cooking oats". I used my regular Quaker oats, and they STILL came out soft, round, and delicious. I did not flatten before baking. Cookies came out perfect.

Really good cookies.  I added a 1/2 tsp. ground cloves and a splash of milk and veganized the ingredients.  I also left the cookies in for a bit longer.  Turned out great.

Great cookies!  I followed the recipe except I reduced the amount of sugar by 1/2 cup.  Cookies tasted great.  I also added raisins and pecans.  Husband loved them.  I will make these again.

Wonderful recipe! I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and also a 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and omitted the raisins b/c I don't like biting into something squishy like that.  I will definitely make these again over the holidays, possibly even with some vanilla icing sandwiched between 2 cookies.  Thanks for sharing this yummy and easy recipe!

Even after i added twice as much flour by accident and added water to even out the consistancy, these cookies flew to corowrker's mouths. They especially loved the craisin/white chocolate ones. I will definately be making these again for the holidays.

i have been married 4 years and have messed up every cookie recipe. i attempted these for my husband, and they were perfect. i was makeing them for a sandwich cookie and they were in and out of the freezer like 5 times and each time they were as soft and chewy as when they were out of the oven. they are the best cookies i have ever had, and oatmeal cookies are my favorite!!!

Guilty pleasure!  The key to the recipe is the butter which makes them delicious.  Key changes - half batch with cherry craisens other half with mini choc chips.  I prefer crispy oatmeal cookies so I formed balls and squished down with hand until very thin and baked until golden brown.  They don't flatten or expand much during baking.  Keeper.

Super good!  I added 1 cup chocolate chips and 1 cup raisins and they're disappearing in no time.  I was concerned that they were not done all the way through when I took them out but letting them sit for the 5 minutes on the baking sheet really firmed them up.

Great recipe!  I used some of the other suggestions, I used only brown sugar, egg whites no cinnamon and added half a bag of chocolate chips.  Very yummy cookies, I can't keep my kids or husband out of them!

Tried this recipe tonight and I Love it! Love that the recipe can be changed around a little. Made some as in recipe, and some with raisins. They turned out beautifully. For something different I tried some with crunchy peanut butter and some with mashed banana, and then a few with both the peanut butter and bananas, even though the texture changed once I added those two items, they still turned out great! I will be making them again!

Very good, easy to make and soft & chewy as promised.  The reason for only 4 stars instead of 5 was that I found them a bit too sweet.  I will make again, but reduce the sugar.

Every time I make these cookies, they are a huge hit with everyone.  My husband even likes them better than his mom's oatmeal cookies (which he loves).  I add about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  Next time I am going to try cutting the sugar a little, though.

My new favorite oatmeal cookie recipe! I used a 2oz scoop and gently pressed with my fingers instead of the sugared fork.  Since they were pretty big I increased the cook time to 11 minutes. I completely didnt see that I needed to chill the dough until I came on to write a review.  They turned out great and I cant wait to try mix-ins such as raisins or choc chips etc. Thanks for a great recipe.

they were very chewy and good but they werent soft enough...to make them soft i would suggest flattening them out a bit more on the pan, so that they spread much more easily...

these were great!  I accidentally put in a tsp. of baking powder too - not sure how it changed the cookies, if at all, but they were GREAT!  Soft and crunchy, all at once!  I used regular oats too - I could tell the difference, but they were still very good.

Recipe was okay, something is better then nothing.  Didn't have time to put in the refrigerator for an hour but after I creamed the sugar, butter etc. in a metal bowl I put it in the freezer while I added the dry ingredients together and put everything away.  I then mixed it.  It was difficult to turn into a ball but it stayed fat and didn't spread out during the cooking.  So that helped.

I'm the only one in our family that doesn't like raisins, so I was excited about this recipe....  I made them both ways and was really surpised to see the raisinless cookies go first.  These will be a regular at our house.

Delicious flavor, the cinnamon really adds a great touch. I doubled the vanilla for extra taste. These did not turn out soft but I have a horrible oven so it's not surprising. They did have amazing taste and texture, regardless!

These are really good! For a variation (I've done these both ways now), try leaving out the raisins and spice, and add vanilla and chocolate chips, makes it a very kid-friendly recipe, and retains it's hearty oatmeal texture.

Very good cookie with a light cinammon flavor, crunchy outside and soft center. I followed the recipe as written.  My family prefers a thicker cookie.

Great recipe. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour, and 1 cup white. Great texture and really yummy. Make sure you don't over bake them, and they will come out nice and chewy :)

I made these with the other reviewers suggestion of 1 1/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar.  I added 1 teaspoon orange extract, 1 cup dried cranberries, and 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  So good!

This recipe is pretty good, but too much cinnamon. If you plan to add chocolate skip the cinnamon completely.

These are one of my husband's favorite cookies.  I like them because they are soft in the center and just crisp enough around the edges.  Great recipe.

I have a 14 year old athlete in the house and he doesn't like cookies too much.  He needed to add oatmeal to his diet and this was my last hope.  He doesn't like oatmeal, but absolutely loves these cookies.  Very soft, moist and great flavor just the way they are.  I didn't chill in the refriderator, just didn't have the time, and  they turned out great.  Will definitely make these again.  Thanks!

I thought these were pretty good.  I like my oatmeal cookies more fluffy and softer.  But the flavor was very good.

My search for a perfect oatmeal cookie has ended. These cookies were soft, chewy and delicious! Easy to throw together – I didn’t even chill the dough. I added cranberries, coconut and walnuts.  So good, they unfortunately didn’t last very long.  Next time I will have to double the recipe!

DELICIOUS...I have tried so many Oatmeal Cookie recipes and this one definitely stands out from the rest.  I added a cup of plumped raisins but made no other alterations.  I was making them for my husbands co-workers, but I can't stop my family from eating them...I will have to make another batch.  Thanks so much for our new favorite cookie recipe!!

Excellant! I thought that if I put it in the fridge for too long, it would be to hard to shape (as another poster suggested) so I went ahead and baked them immediately. The cookies spread a little, but were still very good. Next time I will let them chill before baking.

I'm a college student who likes to "try" and bake every now and then, but let me tell you that this recipe is SO easy to make and the best part of it all were the results they are SO SO GOOD!! One batch of these cookies were gone by the end of dinner!! They come out very moist and soft!! I'd also like to thank those of you who posted the FYI for adding and plumping the rasins!!!  :)   :)

These cookies are great! My family is constantly making requests for them. I usually prep the night before baking, rather than the one hour chill time to make mix a little firm before baking.

These are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made.  I have been using this recipe for a year now and everyone raves about these cookies. I do add 1/2 cup of flour and 1 cup raisins.  I do not flatten my balls and they come out soft and fat, rather than  soft and flat.  Everyone should try these.

Yum! I made these with 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup golden crisco. Then added raisins and walnuts to half the batch and dried cranberries and pecans to the other half. A new family favorite.

Great cookie; soft and gooey and utterly delicious.  And, even though I shouldn't be saying this, for all you cookie dough lovers out there--the dough tastes wonderful.  I haven't tried a big variety of oatmeal cookies, so I cannot compare to others, but this was one tasty cookie.

These cookies were fantastic.  My husband who hates oatmeal cookies loves these!  There is no need to refrigerate the dough prior to baking.  They flatten out on their own with room temperature dough.  I also added raisins.  Delicious!!

Followed the recipe almost exactly withe the exception of using the sugared fork.  Instead i rolled in balls and pressed down a little before baking and they turned out great.

These cookies are so wonderful!!!!!  Even my better half loved them.  And he is not even a fan of oatmeal cookies.  Followed the recipe, except did not do the sugared fork part. Also I did not add nuts or raisins and they were extreamly delicious on their own!  Will make again, thanks Barbara!!!

If I could this would be a 10+ .... Wonderful cookie, far better than any store bought oatmeal cookie. I also used more spice. Half the recipe I dipped the fork in sugar and the other half left plain on top. Added lots of raisins, in fact the mixture was so thick had to mix it with my hand, but thats the fun part along with eating them. Thanks for sharing. Ealine

These cookies are the best!  I followed this recipe to a "T" and they were so soft and sweet.  This was a perfect recipe for a toddler to help with; my daughters favorite part was flattening the cookies with a sugared fork=)

Nice and chewy; the texture I was looking for. No raisins for me, but next time I might add some chocolate chips or nuts. Mixed the oatmeal in with the other dry ingredients by mistake, but still turned out great. Thanks, Barbara!

THE BEST OATMEAL COOKIES I HAVE HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!  I have been following the recipe off of the oatmeal box for years.  I just discovered THIS recipe and WOW!  These cookies are so soft and chewy and FLAVORFUL.  No more cake-like, bready cookies will I ever make again.  THIS is the ULTIMATE oatmeal cookie recipe. My kids gobble them up! 5 STARS all the way!!

Excellent! Soft, gooey, flavorful! The best oatmeal cookie we've made yet! We researched what makes a gooey soft cookie and adjusted the recipe slightly. Also, we added walnuts, raisins, and more spices like the other reviews. Otherwise, we followed the cooking instructions for eight minutes and it turned out great!

These were good, my husband really liked them and I'm sure I'll make them again. These would probably be even better with some sort of chips (chocolate, PB, etc) but I wanted to skip out on extra fat. I really like this recipe because it doesn't specifically call for raisins and can get away with it. Like many reviewers, I got about 4 dozen instead of 2, which is fine with me :-)
