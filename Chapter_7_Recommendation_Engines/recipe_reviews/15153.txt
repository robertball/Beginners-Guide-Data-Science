The end result reminded me more of a sugar cookie, than a snickerdoodle.  Even with the nutmeg there was no type of zing or anything that made this cookie memorable.

My husband made these and used veg oil instead of shortening and only 1/2 the amount of nutmeg.  They were the best snickerdoodles I've ever had!!! And I thought that I was the snickerdoodle queen.

These were okay. The sugar/cinnamon/nutmeg needed to be doubled and these burned really easy, for some reason. And they didn't really spread. They were kind of snickerdoodle blobs. Not my favorite snickerdoodle recipe, but it's acceptable. It was easy, that's for sure. NOTE: They've been downgraded to a no-go. Husband did not like these at all.

Perfectly crispy with a nice light fluffy center. I used mace instead of nutmeg since I had none on hand, and they still taste perfect.

I had never made Snickerdodles before or tasted them, but they are my husband's favorite cookies...so I thought I would give these a try. I liked the addition of nutmeg to roll the cookies in, next time I may try freshly ground nutmeg to see how much that changes the flavor. My husband thought these were spot on though, just like his grandmother used to make which is a pretty high compliment. Thank you Cathe for posting this recipe, I will definitely make these again.

After reading the reviews, I decided to use the nutmeg in the sugar, cinnamon mix. Being my first time making snickerdoodles, I was amazed at how well they came out.  I did make one other change, I used butter instead of shortening. I think it really added to the flavor.

I've never made snickerdoodles before, but these were pretty easy and turned out great.  I only had butter flavored shortning, but I think it only added to the cookie flavor.  The nutmeg was a bit strong, but I grated a fresh nutmeg.  Overall, a very good cookie :)

I found it helpful to turn the oven down to about 375 and bake for 10 or 11 minutes to avoid burning.  

In the future I will probably use considerably more cinnamon, they kind of are more like sugar cookies than snickerdoodles, but still delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly. these are only ok to me. my boyfriend loved them, they are his favorite, so that was a plus. 
dough seemed very dry.
and they didn't flatten much. I smashed a little with a spatula when they were  done. 
I will make again, because he likes them.

I loved the idea of these and to be honest while they were hot, they were delicious. After one night, they were completely hard as rocks and I have no idea why...
