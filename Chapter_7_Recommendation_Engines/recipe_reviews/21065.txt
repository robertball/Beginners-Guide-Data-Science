I first had this recipe with chopped ham, not dried beef and it was called "Apache Bread". Being a seafood lover, I substituted the ham with crawfish (for Louisianans) or you could try shrimp. It was delicious (and almost like "Jazz Fest" crawfish bread. Also, add more green onions. Warm the spread in the microwave and then bake it in the breadbowl, it won't take as long and the bread won't get too overcooked. You can also use "lite" NOT fat-free cream cheese and sour cream and you can't tell the difference. Enjoy!

I've made this recipe about 8 times since finding it a few months back but I've passed the recipe out to others about twice that amount. Everyone I have served this to loves it! Guys have gone wild for it (should I make a video about that? Titled "Guys gone wild - for the Mississippi Six?" Now there's an idea!!) Thanks kelli for this fab recipe!

Great recipe! I used shaved roast beef since my husband objects to chipped beef - some hangup from his Navy days. I put the green onions on the side for people to spoon over their own servings. I'd like to try making this with small dinner rolls for an individual serving. Thanks for posting Kelli.

Fantastic flavors. Not too hot and spicy either but zippy. I didn't quite get the bread bowl thing right. I used a round loaf from the freezer and tried to hollow it out before it was completely thawed. I also had a logistics problem with the bread bowl fitting in my toaster over and I didn't want to use my regular oven. I made do by microwaving the dip and putting it in the cold bread bowl. It also made a lot as an appetizer for two so we ended up hacking away at the cheesy bread bowl for a couple of days. It was great. I'll make it again and try baking the dip in the bowl next time.

I have made this several times this summer. Everyone absolutely raves about it! They couldn't wait to attack and eat the bowl itself. There have never been any leftovers!

I have been making this recipe for over two years now and I have NEVER had any leftovers!!!  It is alway a hit and again I am printing off the recipe for someone else.  The only thing I do different is to not use the whole jar of dried beef as it would be too salty.

Wonderful alternative 'dipping' snack for those of us tired of regular 'chips -n- dips'! Everytime I make this, it is the hit of the party!

This is a great dip recipe. Don't let the green chiles scare you ... they don't make it spicy, just give it an overall good taste. I'll be making this one again!

This is a crowd pleaser.  Rinse beef before adding it to dip to lessen amount of salt. This recipe also works without the bread bowl.  Just warm in microwave safe dish until cheese is melted.  Spread on crackers or bread slices.

I grew up calling this "Shepard's Bread"... this was wonderful! It was the hit of the New Year's Eve party!! The only change I made was I put all of the pieces of bread on a pan and toasted them before serving. It made them easier to dip with. I also microwaved the cheese mixture for 3 minutes (stirring after each minute) to speed up the melting. Otherwise- no changes to the ingredients... make it as-is. Thanks!

I usually add about 1/2 cup finely chopped onion and an extra jar of chopped dried beef.  It's a big hit!

This recipe is very good for a winter party.  I have made it twice.  I subtituted ham for the beef.  I prefer that.  The second time I made it, was better.  I mixed all of the ingredients and put them in the microwave to cook for several minutes, stirring between each minute.  I then added it into the bread when it was hot.  This made  baking it easier and didn't take so long.  The first time, it took a very long time to get the center to get hot, and the onions to cook.

Great hot dip. I would use spicey shredded cheese in addition to the chiles. I also used canned chiles like suggested in an earlier review. I rinsed the dried beef and ours was not salty. Great with tortilla chips, also.

This dip was very tasty and a nice change from the regular spinach dip in a bread bowl!  I would add more chilli peppers next time to give it more spice though!

I THOUGHT THIS DIP WAS PRETTY TASTY. I USED CRACKERS INSTEAD OF THE BREAD BOWL AND USED FAT FREE SOUR CREAM AND FAT FREE CREAM CHEESE. PLUS I LEFT OUT THE GREEN CHILIES.

This was horrible and a major waste of ingredients. I completely rinsed the beef and it was still...horribly salty. Definitely will not be making this one again.

This has a great taste. I did add ½ a pound of cooked mild sausage crumbled. And of all things I had to add a little salt because I over rinsed the dried beef. I did get a giggle when a couple of girls were fighting over who got to eat the top of the bowl. Thanks for a great recipe Kelli

I really liked this, and so did everyone at the party that I made it for.  The only thing I will change the next time I make it, is that it was a little thick for me.  I might add a little carnation milk, or even a little bullion to make it a little more like a "dip" instead of a "spread".  The appearance was excellent, and I loved the bread bowl.  Looked very gormet.  Thanks for a great new recipe!

I used chopped fajita meat instead of the canned meat after reading reviews.  Maybe that was a mistake.  Taste was OK but probably won't make again.

This is excellent.  I have made it several times now and it's always a huge hit!  I rinse the beef now, as it was VERY salty the first time I made it for some reason.  I add more chilis or some chopped jalapenos. yumm!!!

PS...For all those curious about the name...I believe it to be called "Mississippi Sin" not six.  Someone must have typoed, or wrote a sloppy "N" when writing out the recipe. :o)

This recipie is great, however, be sure to really wash the dried beef, otherwise it is REALLY salty.  I also made this with cubed ham and it was great!

This was pretty good. I didn't know if you should eat it with bread or chips. I think the guests liked it, but there was a ton of other food there. It's one of those recipes that I'm going to try again when I know there will be less food available because 1) it's really easy to make; and 2) how can these ingrediants not taste really good?

Although I received many compliments on this appetizer, it was very salty and I wish I would have taken the advice of other reviewers and rinsed the dried beef before using. Overall, it was a good dish and I would probably make this again- if for nothing else, the bread bowl was very tasty!

I started making this a couple years ago for football parties and now family and friends demand I bring it every time there's a get-together. My husband even has me make it for supper sometimes! I usually double the dried beef. Super, super yummy.

I took this to a family picnic, and everyone loved it.  I heated it in the microwave first, as others suggested, then spooned it into the bread and baked it about 30 min right before leaving the house so it would be nice and gooey for the picnic.  It went over quite well.  The only change I made was I used corned beef instead of dried beef.  It's a very rich recipe, much thicker than I had imagined.  Make sure you have a spoon to serve it with!

I made this several years ago and then misplaced my recipe so I was so glad to find it here.  I didn't add the dried beef because my original recipe didn't have it and that is the way I prefer it.  This is a great and different recipe for bread dip.  I made it for a get together I had and my guests were gathered around it until the entire thing was gone.  Delicious!

This was a hit at my last party. I'm terrified of dried meat, so I substituted 3/4 c. taco-seasoned cooked ground beef  for the dried beef and omitted the Worcestershire sauce. I will make this recipe again.

Definately has to cook longer.  I even did as others suggested and microwaved it first.  Anyways, the recipe itself was really tasty.  I did substitute ham for the dried beef.  Went over big at my Super Bowl party.

We just returned from a party where this dip was the hit of the evening.  Everyone LOVED it and it disappeared quickly.  I served it with bagel chips and toasted rye bread...yummy.  I followed some other recommendations to microwave the mixture for a few minutes before baking in order to reduce the baking time.  The only thing I changed was to add some red pepper flakes and several generous shakes of Louisiana hot sauce.  Thanks for a great recipe...we will make it again.

I make this same recipe but use a 16 ounce package of ham chopped up instead of the dried beef. A friend gave this recipe to me and called it Mississippi Sin. My 11 year old loves it!!

This recipe is a keeper!  It is an appetizer that especially men will enjoy.  I made the cheese mixture a day ahead of time, refrigerated, and then put it in the bread bowl and baked right before I served it.  Yummy!

I made this for friends and everyone loved it.  Someone even asked to take whatever was leftover home with them!  Definitely rinse and dry the beef before you make this.  We like spicy foods, so I also added a few jalapenos (seeded and chopped).

This dip is INCREDIBLE!!! I substituted pepperoni for the dried beef (hubby has a childhood phobia about dried beef!!)I also added a few diced jalapeno slices from a jar. This will be a family favorite for years, I can't usually get all 5 of my children RAVE at the same time, but this dip did the trick!

This was great!  I heard a lot of "what's this?" but once people tried it, I got good feedback.  I made it in the crock pot instead of the bread bowl because I wanted it to stay warm.  Next time, I will rinse the beef because with the cheddar cheese, it was a little too salty.  I may use hotter peppers next time too.

While this dish generated the most curiosity, it was only reviewed as so-so. I'll try it again but make some changes suggested by other reviewers(shrimp, crawfish, etc.). Thanks for another creative option, Kelli!

I took this to a Christmas Party with younger adults and kids of all ages.  Everybody loved it and wanted the recipe!  I used a small can of chopped green chillies that I drained well and put it in a loaf of light rye bread with some dark german rye chunks added to the tray.  The dip was strong enough to be tasted on the bread, while being very appealing.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and heated the mixture in the microwave before putting it into the bread because I didn't have quite 90 minutes to bake it.  It came out wonderfully anyway, even after a 20 minute car ride in freezing weather and then sitting on the counter for another 15 minutes.  Yummy!!

Made this exactly as written, didn't find the beef or the recipe all that horribly salty, guess it's just our taste, we like salty foods. Made this as an appetizer for Easter and my in-laws raved about it, they couldn't stop eating it. Will be keeping this recipe handy for a long while!

YUM. This was so great, even better than I thought it would be. Looking at the recipe, I assumed it would need some salt, but I'm glad I tasted the dried beef first. It was salty enough to make the rest of the dip not need it. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a keeper!  The name is odd and doesn't convey what guests may be eating, but it tastes great!  I prepped it ahead of time and kept the "guts" in the frig until party time.  Then, I added to the bowl, wrapped, and baked.  Delicious!  THANKS for the recipe!

This is always a favorite at our house! We serve the dip in a Hawaiian Bread bowl and cut up leftover pices of bread to be used as dippers.  Also, instead of dried beef (yuck) we use chopped ham (8 oz).  And we serve with wheat thins as well!  If you think dried beef doesnt sound appetizing then go for the diced ham! Trust me on this one!

I've been making a variation of this recipe for years, but never knew there was an official name! In these parts, we call it "Italian Bread Loaf Dip". Most of the ingredients are the same, with a few changes:  Hollow out an Italian bread loaf, mix together 8 oz. cream cheese, 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese, 16 oz. sour cream, 2.5 oz. chopped Carl Buddigs beef, minced onion (to taste), and garlic powder (to taste).  Favorite dippers: Ritz Chips, Ritz crackers and tortilla chips.  Maybe I should call it the Ohio 5.2 ?  Excellent recipe! A favorite at every casual get-together as it is always requested. Hey Smoove Gravy, bring the bread dip!

I tried to pick out a super easy recipe that I could delegate to my husband to make for our Thanksgiving guests while I attended to dinner.  This was definitely it!  We opted to bake it in a dish for approx. 15 minutes at 350F, and served it with warm cubes of pumpernickel bread on the side.  We will (I mean he will) definitely be doing this again.

Really Good! The boys devoured it.. I used it more as a base recipe though. I used diced andouille sausage instead of the dried beef. I also used fresh mariachi peppers from my garden that I had minced for the canned green chiles. I think swiss or provolone cheese would make a tasty sub for the cheddar. So many possibilities with this dip. I just microwaved the extra that wouldn't fit in the bread bowl. (still good and so much faster) The guys preferred baked in the bread though. I will definitely use this again.

This is an awesome dish! I usually use the dried beef, but I have tried it with ham also and it was just as good. Thanks for sharing this recipe with us!!

This is a wonderful dip that EVERYONE loves!  I have made it half a dozen times and it's been the hit of the party and I never take home leftovers.  We like to increase the heat by adding habenero peppers when we know the group can take it. My favorite part of this recipe is when someone finally rips into the bread bowl. :)

Made this for Christmas and it was a big hit!  I made just as recipe said and it turned out perfect!  Cooked for 90 minutes even though I thought that may have been too long, but it turned out perfect.  Will definitely make again.

This was an awesome new appetizer I introduced into the family. As per others' advice, I cooked in the microwave for a few minutes before baking to cut down on baking time. Not the healthiest treat, but delicious!

I made this dish for our super bowl party. I had nothing to take back home afterwards... it was a huge it. I did not add as many chilies as the recipe called for and I wish I would have. This dish is WONDERFUL. Highly recommend!

I thought this was okay.  I wasn't as good as I was expecting it to be.       It kind of just tasted like one of those dried beef balls with cream cheese and worchestershire warmed up, but with a some other ingredients I couldn't really taste.

We did not care for this. Made it as written.  It was very bland and had a "fluffy" consistency for some reason. Will not make this again. Sorry.

I could not find any dried beef and so decided to use shrimp as others had mentioned it worked.  I liked it but don't love it.  I have made a lot of shrimp/crab dips in my life and this tastes like a lot of them.  Not better or worse, kind of unremarkable.  I took it to a party and people ate it but no one was overly crazy about it.

Go ahead and make copies of this recipe or be ready to email this link because all of your guests will be asking for it.  This is an awesome party dip, very delicious.  I especially love munching on the bread bowl itself after the guests have gone!  :)  I used diced ham instead of dried beef.

This was ok. Not the best for us. We're used to the chilled bread bowls. Thought we'd try it for a change. I was hoping for it to be a bit better based on the reviews.

My daughter and I loved this recipe!  I would suggest purchasing two loaves of bread so you can cut the second one up for extra dipping pieces.  I also used four strips of cut up, fried bacon since I couldn't find dried beef at the grocery store.  It tasted great!

I am rating this as a four star recipe only because I served this at a party and it was all gone. I got 2 bites and did not care for either one. I think I was turned off by the dried beef. Blech. But everyone else seemed to enjoy it.

I thought this recipe was great!  I omitted the onions and used canned chile peppers (well drained).
