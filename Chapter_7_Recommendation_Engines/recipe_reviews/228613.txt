I LOVED this! I had leftover grilled chicken which i grilled with a Greek seasoning, so i added that in at the end just to heat through. Instead of the vinaigrette(taste preference), i started off with 4 Tbl. of Olive oil, the Greek Seasoning, and squeezed half of a lemon on top at the end. I used Zucchini instead of Cucumber, and also added salt and pepper. This is a VERY satisfying dish, with no need for a side! I cannot wait to taste the leftovers cold, for lunch tomorrow!

We loved this dinner!  It was so quick and easy to make, and very flavorful.  I did some tinkering; here is my alternative recipe: In lieu of Greek seasoning, I sprinkled the chicken with a mixture of 1/2 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp black pepper, a little bit of salt (maybe a pinch), 1 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp garlic powder and the juice of one lemon.  I cooked it in a mixture of olive oil and butter.  After adding the spinach, I sprinkled it with 2 Tbsp. balsamic vinegar and stirred it.  Added cherry toms (whole) in place of chopped tomatoes and kalamata olives (whole) in place of the canned black olives.  I also added a bunch of pepperoncini, which I think really made the dish.  Thanks so much for a great recipe; will def make again!!

It was absolutely fabulous!! My husband and I are dieting, so I used quinoa instead of orzo to cut some carbs and add a little protein. I also did not have any of the dressing on hand, so I made some from a recipe I found on Epicurious, which was phenomenal!!

For my diet I am trying to eat more fresh greens and vegetables to make it complete. I like anything over rice or pasta, hot preferably which made this a terrific meal except for the olives that I do not prefer in my meals.The chicken breast is a good addition to this Hot Greek Salad that I hope to make again.

This was a nice change to a traditional cold salad. I made the recipe to the letter and we enjoyed it on this warm late spring evening, except now I wish I had picked up a nice loaf of fresh bread to go with it. As a personal preference, I would omit the black olives next time because both of us picked around them. I might enjoy some variety of pickled olives with this dish instead. Overall, we enjoyed this salad. Thanks for the recipe!
