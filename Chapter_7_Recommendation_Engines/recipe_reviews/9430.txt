In the directions I think it should say to boil all of the ingredients till the sugar melts. There was so much sugar in the recipe that even when I let it boil for 7 minutes, the sugar wouldn't melt. You also have to stir it constantly or else it burns. I ended up with really granular burnt fudge. The directions need to be clearer.

This recipe is perfect every time! I start the time when the syrup starts to boil, another recipe on this site says to do that, too! I have not had it burn, I stir it quite a bit while it cooks. Watch the heat. Thanks for the great recipe, I now can make chocolate and the peanut butter fudge (from this site) without fail! My mother used to say some people are candy makers and some not, I am so glad I can do it!

Yikes! Not EXACTLY "fool-proof." What went wrong? The sugar never melted and started to scorch. (I remember a recipe like this from years ago, but never had trouble with it before) Seemed liked there was too much sugar in proportion to the other ingredients?

This recipe was PERFECT! I just assumed with the amount of sugar in this recipe, and the milk, this is a recipe that had to be stirred. Mine did not burn, it turned out perfect! I have made it each year since it was added to the site. No problems with it here, but then, I am a seasoned cook and candy maker. I also don't need to have all directions spelled out, I figure it out on my own!

OK In this persons defense, I love making fudge and this recipe may nat say to stir constantly. You are right there, however people who do make these kinds of treats know that when cooking with sugar in this amount you do hac=ve to stir it constantly. I loved this recipe and wil for sure use it again! Thank you!!

Very delicious. Made this for a bake sale. Some lady came and purchased all that I had left after purchasing a bag thirty minutes earlier. Thanks for sharing.

It's good.  Also nearly the same recipe as on back of nestles toll house choc chips pkg. 
Hint: cooking marshmallows makes them splatter and burn the arms. And your fudge gets harder, faster. Not necessary. Wait until you cook sugar milk, margarine, 5-7 min, THEN add marshmallows, stirring til they're melted, followed quickly by choc chips, nuts, vanilla. Get into buttered 9x9 as soon as chips are melted.  Much easier.

I made this recipe and started to wounder when the sugar was going to evaporate.  It never did.  Too much sugar and it produced a grainy fudge. It wasn't  a hit with me.

if you want a sugar high, just dip some marshmallows and choc chips in sweetened condensed milk instead of bothering with the burn on the bottom of your pan when you are done making this fudge.  Too much sugar, too grainy and tasted burnt.

This is foolproof if you have a clue as to what you are doing. This might not be a good recipe for the inexperienced cook. I thought it was fantastic and very SIMPLE to make.

This fudge is delicious. It is still cooling at the moment, but someone had to clean the spoon! So, I only changed things by making my own SC milk, story of that and the review over at Homemade SC Milk, and I added a few more chocolate chips and walnuts than directed to empty the packages, but it turned out great. Just keep stirring and then mix in the chocolate quickly to pour over before it starts to set. Jean did good.

This is a terrific fudge that is both quick and easy!  However, it was a little grainy.  I will definitely have to make more next time!

This way way too sweet!  The too high amount of sugar just about put me in a hyperglycemic shock state.  It was also grainy.

Fabulous! Again, just stir it and keep it at low heat as you would with sugar anytime. Great fudge!

This had way too much sugar and was in no way fool proof. I had problems with it burning and being very gritty. I would not use this recipe again.

I am an experienced cook and my experience when making this fudge was okay,but not great..AND I stired and stired the boiling fudge mixture way past the time indicated on the instructions,( past 7 minutes to be exact!).Still after following directions,this fudge came out grainy and like other reviewers I found it too sugary sweet.  I am still on the search for a foolproof fudge recipe.

Delightful fudge but not for a beginner. Like old fashioned fudge, you have to heat it very slowly so it doesn't burn. Also, don't scrape the sides of the pan. Only the bottom. Scraping the sides is what causes it to be sugary. Still easier than the old fashioned kind I made as a kid because using the condensed milk, marshmallows and chocolate chips makes the boiling time MUCH faster and you don't have to use a candy thermometer or check the "ball stage". Wonderful recipe!
