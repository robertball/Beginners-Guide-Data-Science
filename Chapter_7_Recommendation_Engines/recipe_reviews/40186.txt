This was fantastic! I just love recipes like this-looks like it was complicated to make, but so simple! I made the basil pesto fresh the day before and omitted the mushrooms as they weren't on hand. I found the dish goes through stages and keeping it simmering just a bit longer than the 4 min. gets it out of that "oily" clumpy stage into a nice , smooth creamy sauce.

This was awesome!  I omitted the shrimp and replaced it with chicken.  Used 2% milk, but will use cream next time for a thicker texture. Used a can of Ro-Tel tomatoes for a spicy kick, instead of fresh, but did use fresh mushrooms.  Added this to spinach linguini and it was wonderful!  Even my 4 year old loved it!

Delicious! I didn't have any shrimp or mushrooms, so I made the pasta with just the cream sauce, and it turned out wonderfully. The only thing I did change is that I added an extra tablespoon of flower. After mixing in the Pesto, I felt that the sauce was still too thin, and I didn't think it would stick well to the pasta. After I added the flower, I let it simmer for an extra 5 minutes and it was perfect. Adding the pasta helped too because the starch from the pasta made it a bit less liquidy as well. Great recipe!

We really loved this.  One thing... I don't think it needs all the oil and butter that the recipe calls for.  I would use 1/2 the olive oil next time and we used half the butter; it was still really creamy and I couldn't tell the difference.  We also used skim milk.  Really yummy over homemade tortellini!

Delicious!  Even with soy milk!  My family can't really do cows' milk, so I was looking for a good pesto cream sauce that I could sub out the milk.  I followed the recipe with the following modifications:  I chopped the garlic rather than slice it, I cut the butter (Earth Balance Buttery Sticks) to 1/4 cup and stirred the flour into the oil/onions/garlic/butter (making a roux) before adding 2 cups Silk brand plain soy milk.  I used Pecorino Romano cheese (sheeps' milk, we can tolerate that well) and used prepared pesto made with the same.  My family raved (even the picky 9-year old).  This is definitely a keeper, and now I know it works with soy milk, I will probably make different flavored variations of the cream sauce.

absolutely fabulous, delicious.  I did saute the mushrooms with the onion and garlic; and then stirred in the flour "before" I added the milk;(like a roux);no lumps! I also used sauteed chicken tenders in place of shrimp.
This recipe is yummy

I made this dish for a man that I was dating.  He raved about it saying it was a gourmet meal.  I found it very easy to make and I am a fairly unexperienced cook.  The only change that I might make would to leave the tomatoes out.  They seemed to thin the sauce out.  Overall the taste was outstanding!  Definately the best meal that I have ever made.

Yum! This was good stuff! Be sure to cook the shrimp ahead of time. Somehow I glossed over the fact that you were to use cooked shrimp and assumed it would be sauteed along with everything else. We served this along with asparagus and garlic bread, and it was great together! I like the suggestion someone made to add artichoke hearts and will try that next time we make it. And there will be a next time! The recipe is really rich though. My husband said he loved it but no way he could eat a second helping. I think this is one everyone will love.

This recipe is really good -- I use a little less flour and no mushrooms.  (Just personal preference on the mushrooms)

As a garnish, and I think as something that adds an extra textural boost to the dish, I also slice roma tomatoes, and arrange them on top.

As far as the problem with the tomatoes making things too watery -- As odd as it sounds, I wrap the diced tomatoes tightly in paper towels to drain out the excess, and that fixed the problem for me.

Awesome!  I also added the flour to the onion/garlic and then added the milk to cook the flour well.  I added a splash of white wine, half and half and milk.  At the end, I pretty much threw everything but the kitchen sink in...mushrooms, shrimp, ham, and a sprinkling of green onions.

This dish was the best pasta dish I've ever made. I made a serving size for four but cut down on these ingredients. I lightened the butter portion to about 3 tablespoons and used a half a cup of milk with 1 tablespoon of flour. I then also only used two heaping tablespoons of pesto and it wasn't overpowering just perfect and more low fat! 

I also sauteed the mushrooms in with the garlic and onion to cook, but remained the same timing with adding the tomatoes and shrimp. Adding the linguine to the sauce and letting it simmer for 5 minutes really helped infuse the flavor all the way through.

This recipe is fantastic! I didn't have the shrimp or the pesto, and I didn't have any pasta either, so instead I made it with rice and beans. Turns out I didn't have any milk or salt either, so I substituted non-dairy creamer and Mrs. Dash. It turned out wonderfully!  /idiots.  Seriously, this recipe is very good. It's very simple to make, and tasts fantastic. Highly recommended.

I only made the sauce (no mushrooms or tomatoes) from this recipe, but I made it as written and it was a big hit at the party I gave. I had made it the night before, and reheated it the next day in my crock pot on low. Guests took bowls of pasta and choose between this and a marinara (Best Marinara Sauce Yet, on this site), as well as assorted toppings, salad, and breadsticks. We got lots of complements! Thanks for the great recipe!

I'm an italian girl and we make our own tomato sauce but I wanted a twist and wanted to try something different and this was probably the best sauce I ever had. Even better than anything I tried at a restaurant. My husband loved it and he doesn't like anything that involves herbs and he loved the pesto. Very Good Sauce!

Quick and easy, but very salty taste. Must be from the romano cheese. I think I would reduce the pesto and the romano next time.

This was awesome! I actually forgot to add the butter and used 3 cups fat free milk and 3 T. Wondra flour.  I added a cooked chicken breast chopped up in with the cooked shrimp because I have older boys that eat A LOT.  Everyone LOVED it. The only thing I would do different is sprinkle cheese on top.

Sauce was very creamy and full of flavor. I made a couple small changes, I sauted my mushrooms to give them a little color in a separate pan before adding them to the sauce. I used one cup of half and half and one cup of skim milk for the sauce and used about half the amount of pesto that the recipe called for.   It was nice and creamy and the shrimp were great in this dish.

This did not work for me or my family.  The romano cheese was too overpowering & I didn't even add all the recipe called for.  I'd say it was edible, however I wouldn't be making it again....sorry :(

My husband loved this but I felt it needed some spice to bump it up. Otherwise, it was fine and I would make again. Very easy and smooth sause! I sauteed chiciken breast and reserved to warm oven while onins, garlic and mushrooms simmered and then made the pasta after the sauce was well on its way. Added both slicked chicken and veggies to sauce and can't complain.

Delicious!  Instead of the shrimp and mushrooms, I added a little fresh basil the sauce, used the tomato, and shredded some boiled chicken.  Put all these in a pan layered like baked ziti, fresh mozzarella thrown in, and it's a fabulous pasta bake!

Fantastic!!! Very easy....I didn't have any veggies/shrimp to add...just poured it over some chicken and cheese ravioli. I only used 1/4 cup of butter and it was still great!

Very Good!! I used half and half instead of milk. Canned diced tomatos, and parmesian cheese as substitues. But will definately use romano the next time. This is a keeper for me...

Excellent recipe!  I did cut back on the butter - only used 1/4 cup and only used 1 cup of romano cheese. I did saute the mushrooms with the onion and garlic and added the flour to the vegetables to make a roux before adding the milk (used 2%). I also used uncooked shrimp which I added to the pan for a minute just before adding the cream. The shrimp continued cooking in the sauce and they were perfectly done. The sauce was the perfect consistency with no lumps. Next time I will add an additional tomato and maybe some asparagus.

This recipe is great. I substituted 1 1/2 cups of asiago cheese instead of the Romano (it was cheaper), used chicken, and left out the mushrooms. Definitely one our new favorites!

We left out the mushrooms, shrimp and tomato due to picky eaters (next time I will add them) and it was STILL really good! I liked the amount that it made as well.

Amazing flavor, I used fresh basil b/c I didn't have enough pesto, and fresh wild mushrooms, chantrells to enhance the mushroom flavor. This one is a winner by me!

This was good! I didn't have any shrimp or mushrooms on hand, so I went without, but will try it with those additions next time. I used minced garlic and had to add extra milk to get it to a thinner consistancy, as it was way too thick. Also, I did not use all the cheese called for, but served extra at the table. I served this with mini bow tie pasta. All in all this was a very tasty sauce that I would make again! Thanks for sharing. :)

The pasta was lovely! We enjoyed the combination of the excellent pesto we already hand and the cream. We decided to make it with the squash we already had on hand and it turned out perfectly. We will certainly be making this again.

I absolutely love all the ingredients in this recipe but together, not so much.  There was something off about the whole thing and it was somewhat slimey.  It was edible but not something I want to make again.

Was kinda disappointed with this, I specifically picked this recipe because it looked like it was a cream sauce with a little basil/pesto twist. In the picture its mainly cream.  I made it according to the recipe except i stopped after stirring in the pest and just put that right over pasta, instead of adding shrimp mushrooms and tomatoes. It came out like a green pesto soup.  The consistency wasn't bad but it definitely was a pesto sauce. My boyfriend enjoyed it, but i chose this one so that me and his dad-who aren't HUGE pesto people-would like it too.  I'm thinking about trying this again, but just adding 1/4 a cup basil pesto, or maybe even just chopped basil leaves and just add enough to give flavor but not be over powering the cream.  If anyone who has made this and has had better luck, I'd love your advice. This dish sounds and looks yummy, it just didn't when I made it.

I tried to make this a little healthier by using about 3 tablespoons of margarine instead of the 1/2 c butter that the recipe calls for. I also cut down the grated cheese from 1 1/2 c to just 1/2 c. It turned out great and still tasted perfectly rich!

This was out of this world. I followed other reviewers' suggestions of preparing a roux before adding the milk, and it came out sooo thick and creamy. I also subbed a chopped rotisserie chicken for the shrimp and mushrooms. I served over fettuccine with garlic bread sticks. Great meal!

You have to like pesto and garlic to fully enjoy this sauce.  This is now one of my new comfort foods.  To make it a more healthy recipe, I used whole wheat thin spaghetti pasta because the robust flavors of this sauce camouflage the whole wheat taste.  I also chose to use light or lowfat ingredients: skim milk, lowfat cheese, light butter.  I used large peeled and deveined shrimp but took the tails off so I didn't have to get messy doing that after the sauce and shrimp were mixed together.  For the pesto sauce, I used a small bottle of the prepared pesto sauce.  Just enough!

Wow, this is a very impressive dinner!  I marinated the shrimp in some pesto, and then grilled them on skewers and served them over top of the pasta.  Incredible!

Divine!!! I changed this recipe to suit what I had in the cupboard. I omitted the shrimps, used granulated garlic and used the tomatoes I had. This was wonderful and would be quick and perfect to make when visitors pop in, very filling. I will definately be using this again.

I cut the butter in half and it tasted plenty rich. Used non fat milk, shitake mushrooms and grape tomatoes cut in half. I also added about 2-3 cups of spinach during hte last 3 minutes off cooking - it added some nice color and vitamins. Tasty!

OK Awesome!  I didn't even have to use cream.  I used fat free milk.  I'm going do something next time about that stick of butter.  There has got to be a substitute.  But it was yummy.

I made this without changing anything.I love pasta and this was great. Easy to make instructions. Only one problem, I forgot to calculate number of servings so I made eight servings and I live alone so I gave some to coworkers and a couple next door. Had to give recipe to each becase they loved it also.

This dish was excellent!  The only two small changes I made was to cut the amount of butter in half (I used unsalted), and I only used 1/4 cup Romano cheese (instead of 1-and-a-half cups) and substituted a cup of low-fat mozzarella for the remaining cheese.  The rest of the recipe I followed as it was written and it was delicious!  Using less butter (w/no salt) in no way compromised the flavor, so I recommend this, to keep down the calorie and sodium count.  I served this with a side of Italian Kale, also found on this site.  It was a wonderful meal that I will be making again!!

Great recipe. To lower the saltiness I substituted Gruyere cheese for part of the Romano cheese. Crab meat or lobster meat could be substituted for the shrimp. I suppose the fake products could also be used.

Well,.. where to start! Aside from WONDERFUL... I'm giving this a 5 * but with reservations. The reason for my reservation:-... even with the full version, (I halved it) I was a little worried about the amount of Pesto. That was the only ingredient I altered. I used almost half stated and am VERY glad I did.
It is an incredible and wonderfully different cream sauce. Althoug we had it with steak from the grill and omited the shrimp, it actually would be better with the shrimp. 
 As far as tomatoes are concerned, I did not have any Roma's on hand and used 1 large tomato, but I scooped out the seeds and liquids; worked perfectly. Also only had very large stuffing mushrooms, was going to use 3 but after chopping only 2, realized that was more than enuf!
After making the sauce, turned everything off (had to go feed the horses) came back, cooked the pasta, reheated the sauce....  was wonderful.  Could taste everything - mushrooms, garlic, cheese, tomato, (and maybe use slightly less pesto next time) - but it was ....  WONDERFUL! definetely a keeper - thanks so much!  (hmmm, might add basil or oregano next time....)

Absolutely wonderful. I thought this might be a bit involved at first but found that so long as the pesto needed is readily available it's pretty quick. I had several jars of home made frozen pesto on hand so this was not a problem.

I think this would go over great at any pot luck and get plenty of "how'd you make that" inquiries. 

Highly recommended!!!

Really good.  There are times when you just need to ignore the calories.  This is one of those times.  (I skimped on butter- a whole stick?! but added extra cream, so likely a wash).  Religion-changingly good.

The only change I made was to use chicken instead of shrimp.  Delicious.  I also think I'm going to try just a plain cream sauce without adding the pesto.  I think that will be good too!!

Easy and delicious. Made without shrimp for a great main course pasta. Added 1 can diced tomatoes.

excellent recipe.  I mixed the flour with the onions and garlic before adding the milk.  I added Parmesan instead of Romano because that is what I had available.  I also used a can of mushroom pieces and a can of diced tomatoes (drained) and a bit extra pesto.  It turned out great.  I'm sure with fresh veges and Romano cheese it would be great also.  Will definitely make again.

Wow, this was delicious! I substituted the mushrooms and roma tomatoes for what I had on hand - mild green olives and sun-dried tomatoes, which just turned out perfect.

This recipe is very good AS IS,but it is VERY rich and heavy.  Next time, I think I will cut back on the butter/cheese to lighten it up a little bit.    I also made my own pesto sauce for this recipe, and subbed chicken sausage instead of shrimp due to a food allergy in the family.  My 18 month old gobbled this right up.    My husband kept calling me a gourmet chef. HAHA!

I made just the pesto sauce with the linguine pasta and it was amazing! Very simple to make and very delicious to eat! My family loved it...will be making again, next time maybe with some sliced Italian sausage!

This is the absolute best pesto cream sauce recipe. I have tried a few on this site and this is by far the best. The only change I made was I cut the butter down and scaled it to 4 servings instead of 8. If I could give this 10 stars I would. It has all the flavor and so creamy. My family devored this meal. There were no leftovers to my dissapointment :(  The recipe needs no change at all. In my opinion you dont need to waste your time finding a better pesto cream sauce. I am sure this would go great with other meats such as chicken or crab as well. Thanks so much for an absolute fab recipe!

Too many mushrooms.  Could be creamier.  The tomatoes tasted great in the sauce, though.

Absolutly wonderful!  I had a jar of basil pesto in the refridgerator for a couple of months, but did not know what to do with it.   I had taken a pound of frozen raw shrimp and tilapia filets and was challenged as to what to cook.  I remembered the pesto, which led me to thsi recipe.  I had the Kraft shredded Ramano/Asagio/Parmesan cheese, which I used.  I did not have fresh mushrooms, but did have a jar of Green Giant sliced mushrooms.  I sauted those right after adding the garlic to the onion/olive oil/butter mixture already simmering.  I did this to soften them up because I find that jar/can mushrooms are a bit tough otherwise. I had all other ingredients except the tomatoes. This was so good that I took some to my neighbor.  Everyone who's tasted it loved it.  I will make this again.  ***Updated 10/29/08 ... This time I followed the receipe exactly (again, without tomatoes).  I would HIGHLY recommend that you saute the mushrooms BEFRORE the end.  Even with fresh mushrooms, they tend to be tougher than I'd like.  The recipe still deserves 5 stars.  SIMPLY WONDERFUL!  Also, I can't imagine why the one reader couldn't get their sauce to thicken up unless they kept a lid on the sauce as it simmered.  The recipe does not say to do that.  Doing so will result in excess moisture/water in the sauce.

I used my own homemade sun-dried tomato pesto with combined with the roux, and the taste wasn't too salty, which was what I was looking for.  I also used skim milk and then added the pasta with the sauce.  Thanks.

Made this for my bf's bday and was an absolute hit (and he's italian!)  The sauce was super filling.  I did use chicken instead of shrimp and put it over penne noodles instead of linguine but definately will make again.  This makes restaurant quality pasta - I did add 10 cloves instead of 8 on the garlic.

I don't like to change anyone's recipe too much if I can help it but I really wanted to make this & was too lazy to go to the store so I had to work with what was here. This recipe really lends itself to substitutions. I used minced garlic instead of sliced. Cream instead of milk - because I like things to be as tasty & fattening as possible! ;-) Parmesan in place of Romano. And a jar of sun-dried tomatoes instead of fresh ones. WOW! This is a keeper. I will take this to our next church dinner - I always feel like I have to make something that is just as good, if not better, than the last thing I brought. This will live up to everyone's expectations! Thank you, Rosiella!!!

Used Pesto-in -a jar.
We all enjoyed the dish..
Made it again--- Still prepared the pasta with olive oil, butter and onions-----, but this time we simply used a can of condensed musroom soup- Just as good--- maybe even better, and a lot quicker.

What's not to love here?   It comes together in a perfect creamy sauce that you would have in any decent Italian restaurant.   I omitted the mushrooms, due to my families preferences and subbed out the Romano for Parmesan out of necessity, but otherwise followed as written.   I will make again.

this is restaurant quality.  I did add a bit of white wine as it got a bit thick as I was waiting for spouse to get home.  Outstanding.  Will make often.

YUM!!!! We keep kosher so the shrimp was out. And since people complained that the tomatoes made things too watery, I swapped them with broccoli. I cooked the pasta, then used 1 T. olive oil (no more is needed) to saute the onion, then added the mushrooms, garlic, and broccoli. In another pot, I used 1/4 cup butter (not half a cup) and flour to make a roux, added the milk and spices, let it thicken, then added in pesto and cheese. Once I had a creamy sauce (it took a little more than 4 minutes), I stirred in the veggies and poured the sauce over the pasta. It tasted like a high-end restaurant dish!

Wow! This blew me out of the water! I didn't use shrimp or tomatoes, but I bet it would taste fantastic with them! I couldn't find plain romano cheese anywhere, so I had a three-cheese blend with some in it instead, but next time I'm hunting some down to see if it changes the taste. But all I can say is YUM! I'm definitely making this again.

I did notice, however, that I had much more sauce than I did noodles. I ended up having to make more pasta to use the remaining sauce. However, this isn't enough to make me drop a star, just a note for next time!

This was pretty good. It would actually be 3 or 3.5 stars for me, but I made some modifications so I'll bump it up to 4 to be a little more fair. First, I can't fathom how some others found their sauce too thin. Mine was like cream of mushroom soup consistency! I didn't have any extra milk so I thinned the sauce with some water that the pasta cooked in. I used only 2 big heaping spoonfuls of pesto, 1 cup seemed like overkill. The pesto taste was nice when I tasted just the sauce but after I thinned it and added the pasta, there wasn't much flavour. On the one hand, I added less pesto so my fault, but it would have been fine if I hadn't had to thin the sauce. If I were to add water again (though I'd really just try to make a thinner sauce to begin with), I'd make sure to add at least 1/2 cup of pesto (the full cup still seems like an awful lot to me). Other than that the only changes I made were to skip the shrimp (only because I only wanted to make two portions and didn't want to buy a bag of shrimp to use only a few) and I used cherry tomatoes because I had half a container of them that I had to use or lose (the roma would have been better though). And, heavy cream would make this sauce more heavenly, but obviously it's a little healthier with milk. All in all, I would make this again, with my tweaks. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! Loved it. So rich and creamy. The only change I made was use 1 cup or milk and 1 cup of whipped cream for a thicker texture. Do try this. So easy to make and u could use any kind of meat! (Well..besides ground beef)

This is kind of strange, so many reviews but nobody listed the most important thing. Anybody making this pasta"Do not add  tomatoes (raw) to ur sauce, else it'll make ur sauce churn". I made this pasta following everything to t & it was absolutely loved by my hubby. No problems at all.I skipped the tomatoes.adding it raw would have made it from 10 to 0.anybody wanting to add tomatoes add them precooked when ur pasta is done while tossing it, dont cook them in sauve, or just leave the tomatoes . It's still tasty.

This is a great dish, with a few modifications. I followed other reviewer's advice and cut back on the oil (only 1T) and butter (only 2T) and I used raw shrimp. This was so good I had to take it off of the table so that I could have leftovers for lunch the next day!

I tweaked this recipe to make it gluten free.  I used Almond Mild instead of cream, grated parmesean instead of romano cheese, and gluten free flour and pasta.  It turned out really well!  I wish I had used more mushrooms in it.  It was very tasty!

This was freakin awesome!  I think next time I will skip the shrimp and substitute chicken.  Although with the mushrooms and maybe a few added veggies it would be a good vegetarian dish as well.

I used fresh made pasta and also made my own pesto. I substituted milk for half and half to make it creamier but cut the butter in half to balance the calories a little. This was redicilously good!

Great tasting recipe!  My total cook&prep time was an hour.  I added approx. half a yellow bell pepper with the onion--red pepper would have been better, though, taste-wise.  As done by another reviewer, I added flour into the onions and garlic, then slowly added one cup of the milk.  Before addding rest of milk and other ingredients, I swapped over to a kettle rather than continue with the skillet, to make sure of sufficient room to stir.  I didn't start my pasta until the last 8-10 minutes to prevent stickiness (I never rinse or oil pasta if possible). I reserved about half-cup of pasta cooking water to thin the sauce if necessary, but it wasn't necessary in this case--sauce had a perfect consistency.

Delicious!  Coincidentally we ordered Shrimp with pesto cream sauce and linguini a couple of weeks later at a nice restaurant and it was good, but this one is better.  It's extraordinarily creamy (which my husband loves) and flavorful.  I pretty much followed the recipe, except I used more like 1/3 a cup of butter and added a little cayenne and paprika.  Next time I might try to make it a little lighter by using only a cup of cheese or skim milk....we'll see, I definitely don't want to change the flavor!

fairly simple to make.   i added the mushrooms in right after the garlic and added the tomatos in a little later.  we used 1/2 romano and 1/2 asiago cheese for more flavor.   sauce tasted great after i made it, but needed more salt when it hit the tortellinis.

Fantastic!! This was absolutely delicious!  I used a pesto sauce recipe from this site for the pesto ingredient in this I didn't have any shrimp or mushrooms and I forgot about the tomato so I omitted those and just used the sauce over penne pasta. My husband loves it too!   I will definitely make again!!

I like this recipe, but I made a mistake using condensed milk, instead of regular milk- I think that was the problem (because I didn't have enough regular milk). The condensed milk was very sweet and thick (I mixed it with water), which made the dish overly sweet. I actually had to rinse it off with water which helped. But, my husband really enjoyed it.  Would probably make it again with the right milk.

I made this a couple of times and we love it,I followed the recipe except for a few short cuts,I used a can of prepared dice tomatoes with garlic and herb spices,and 2 tlbs minced garlic, the shrimp I tryed 2 ways one with 1 lb large frozen cooked and other with 1lb salad size frozen cooked shrimp, the smaller shrimp was best because you get some in every bite and is more tender just thaw and add at the end in sauce for about the last 5 minutes, very very good, great recipe thanx

Very yummy even though mines came out really soupy, I'll have to add more cheese next time. I also plan to sautee the mushrooms before adding milk mix. I know this will be a frequent meal for me.

I love this recipe.  I used the pesto sauce recipe subitted by sal on this site for the "1 cup prepared pesto", using the serving for 4 instead of 16 on that recipe.  I also included in this one a 10 oz. pk of frozen spinach thawed, red pepper instead of the tomatoes and cubed chicken instead of shrimp, as I an allergic.  I served this with penne noodles and it was fantastic.

I am only rating this because I can't keep track of what I make and try and don't make. In all fairness to the recipe, I didn't have the shrimp, tomatoes, or mushrooms. So that would have probably made the recipe better.

This was ok.  I scaled the recipe to two servings, but it made more like 5.  I followed the recipe exactly with only one minor change, I added about 1.5 Tbsp of flour to the milk to make sure the sauce was thick enough (based on another review that said the sauce was too thin).  This wasn't needed, the sauce was plenty thick without the additional flour.  So all in all, it was a pretty quick dish to make - but I just found that pesto completely overpowered every other flavor in the dish.  It gets points for being quick and easy, but that's about it...we likely won't make it again.

I cut down on the butter and oil and used skim milk for this recipe. I also made a home made cashew pesto instead of the normal pesto and left out the tomatoes. Very good and extremely filling! The cashew pesto added a great asian flair to this dish.

I had some leftover store-bought pesto and needed something to do with it so I found this recipe. I did however make a few changes based on what I had: used tomato-basil fettuccine for the pasta, 1 can diced tomatoes for fresh, omitted the onion (picky eaters), used 16 oz fresh mushrooms (didn't count), only 3/4 cup of pesto, 6 T of butter instead of 1/2 cup, used bottled minced garlic for the sliced, added 1 tsp. onion powder and used 1/2 tsp. garlic salt for the salt. I also changed up the cooking instructions a bit: sauted the mushrooms in place of the onion the added the flour and cooked for 1 minute before adding the milk and stirring until smooth. I then followed the directions as listed. It turned out wonderful. The flavored pasta I used especially added to the dish, but regular linguine would probably be fine. Thanks for posting this recipe I enjoyed making it for my family!

this recipes was very good. i made a few changes because it was at the last minute. i used two small cans of mushrooms and a can of diced tomatoes. i opted for scallions instead of a white onion. i have to agree with the previous review, this recipes could have feed an army! no worries...it did not go to waste...we loved it. i would definitely make this again.

Excellent and super easy to make!  I used heavy cream/half n half mixture instead of milk to make it really creamy. ETA:  Made this again as directed w/ milk and thought it was plenty creamy.  Kind of mad I added all those extra calories last time.  I used about a cup of Parmesan cheese and subbed half the butter w/ basil infused olive oil.  A very rich delicious dish that could be served at any restaurant!  Oh, also doubled the shrimp! 8/13/12 - made this several times now and I keep reducing the butter, this past time I only used 2 T. butter and it still tasted awesome.  I think I may just omit the butter all together from now on.  Maybe add a little extra olive oil.  I also use skim milk.  There are definitely a lot of ways to reduce fat in this recipe and still have fantastic taste.

This is an incredible sauce! Made it with fresh pesto
with basil from my herb garden, and used 1/2 & 1/2
instead of the milk. Omitted the flour (it thickened fine
without it using the 1/2 & 1/2). Left out the shrimp and
mushrooms (sauce is so good, it stands alone with-
out it) and served it over angel hair pasta with some
fresh garlic bread. The sauce will get lumpy if it cooks
too long, or over too high heat, so keep an eye on it.
Also, if the tomatoes are too ripe it will thin the sauce.
Great 5 star recipe, but not for the calorie conscious!

This was pretty good. It made a lot and we ate it all, but the texture wasn't quite right. Next time I may play with different cheeses.

Yumm, I followed all the instructions escept instead of 2 cups of milk I used 1 1/4 cups of milk and substituted the rest with water. I wanted to make it a little less creamy so that it wasnt too rich. It was lovely and im very happy with it. I copied it into my recipe book. :)

EXCELLENT. So unbelivably flavorful. I skipped the shrimp since I dont really like it in pasta, and I used portobello mushrooms along with whole wheat linguine. Thank you for the recipe, I will be making again very soon!

This is such a nice dish. The only thing I did differently was to add the flour in with the cooked onion and garlic to get rid of the raw flour taste. I let it cook for about a minute and then added the milk. So wonderful and thank you!

Yummy! I've been making a lower-fat version for ages and love it. In a saucepan, heat a package of low-fat pesto with two cans diced tomatoes with Italian seasonings. Add some red pepper flakes for heat. Bring to a boil. Toss in a 5 oz. bag of spinach until wilted. Add 1.5 cups of fat free half n half to a 1/4 c. corn startch and stir. Add into the tomato/pesto mixture and cook until thickened. Pour cream mixture over cooked wheat angel hair pasta and toss. Add cheese and some salt to taste. We often add in mushrooms, shrimp or chicken for added flavor.

This recipe is the best one I have found on this site, it was excellent.  I did make a few changes. I did not add shrimp, mushrooms or roma tomatoes.  Instead I cooked the sauce and when I tossed it with the pasta I added sun dried tomoatoes, broccoli florets and blackened chicken.

OK this was so good!  Couple adjustments. 1/2 the butter, added the flour to the onion, butter mix and THEN added the milk. Used 1.5 cups of milk because that's all I had! Used cherry tomatoes, 3/4 cup parmesan and a slice of provolone because again that's what I had! Made chicken, and used packaged gnocchi. Amazing!

This looked wonderful so... I chose this (minus the mushrooms and shrimp) as one of 2 pasta dishes to use for a swim team pasta dinner. I tripled the recipe. I used advice from other notes: I used half and half and I made the day before and heated in crockpot on low. It was delicious. The kids ate it all!! Next time, I’ll have to quadruple it!

Great flavor, but definitely no need to add an entire stick of butter (??!!). I just used 1 Tablespoon so it had a little butter flavor. The jar of pesto sauce already has a ridiculous amount of fat. Next time I'll try making my own pesto sauce to have natural ingredients. Like other reviewers I used chicken instead of shrimp too, because it would be a waste of shrimp since you couldn't taste them as it's pesto flavor. I boiled 2 chicken breasts, then cut them up. I sauteed the 16 oz of mushrooms along with the onion at the beginning so they had flavor rather than just throwing them in at the end. Fantastic!

Exactly what I was looking for, a creamy pasta without having to use actual cream (milk & flour do the trick).  I cut the recipe in half, as my large stir fry pan wouldn't have been big enough for this all.  Very yummy.

Delicious! I omitted the flour and used 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and 1 cup of whole milk in lieu of the 2 cups of milk. My family loved it! Will definitely be making this again.

Pretty good!!  Made as per instructions for the most part.  Little changes were: omitted salt and added a pinch of kosher salt with mushrooms, cooked about 4 mins to remove the liquid of the mushrooms.  Used flour to make a roux and then added milk.  We both liked it.  Its not something you have too much because its high in fat and calories but,  it was a nice meal.

Great recipe and super simple! Instead of Romano cheese I substituted Parmigiana cheese instead because I could not find it. Also used chicken instead and it turned out pretty good!

Great recipe but could have used more pesto.  I was disappointed that it didn't have that pesto flavour.  I used chicken instead of shrimp.  Added a splash of white wine.  Cut down the butter by half.  But the rest was as written.  Will make it again with more pesto.

I found this recipe when I had to change plans for dinner at the last minute. I had a pound of defrosted cooked shrimp on hand that I wanted to use. I didn't have fresh tomatoes or fresh mushrooms on hand so I used canned for both. This recipe was quick and delicious. I can't wait to try it with fresh mushrooms and tomatoes.

We liked it and I  will make again with a few changes. I made a roux like some other reviews suggested and the sauce was thick not thin. I used low fat half and half and only 3 T of butter, added tomatoes but not the mushrooms. Next time I will cut the butter down to maybe 1 T and add mushrooms.

DELICIOUS! I had skim milk, a little jar of pesto, half a box of sliced mushrooms and cooked chicken. I added the flour to the onions and garlic and mushroom. Also used just a bit of butter (1 tbsp more or less).

Used less than half the garlic.  It made way more sauce than pasta and I also included chicken along with shrimp.

My family loved this dish! Will make again! Served with while wheat fettuccine, salad and crusty grilled bread.  Yum!! The only thing I changed was I added the flour to the butter/onion mixture, let it cook for one minute, then added the milk. That's how it thickens the sauce.  I did use heavy cream based on a previous review.   But, it ended up too thick. Next time, I use milk.

I made the sauce as directed with adding the tomatoes, shrimp or mushrooms at the end because of allergy issues. Tossed it with linguine and grilled veggies. Very nice!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This sauce is fantastic!!  I added some white wine and some red pepper flakes to give it a little spice and really took the sauce over the top. I also grow basil and made some homemade pesto which by itself can be eaten by itself. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!

Delicious!  I used sausage instead of shrimp so I cooked that first and then used the grease in the place of oil.  I only used about an 1/8th cup of butter, and used one cup lowfat milk, one cup cream.  Added some extra veggies.  We all loved it, thanks for sharing!

I made this tonight and it was amazing!  Adjustments I made.  I used 1 cup of whole cream and 1 cup of milk.  The texture was very smooth and creamy.  Once you add the cheese I cooked 5 minutes to get from the chunky cheese phase to creamy... it came out perfect.. I made no other changes.  Everybody loved this recipe which is somewhat rare!! For the Pesto sauce I used 3 cups of basil, one cup of olive oil 1 cup of pine nuts, 4 cloves of garlic and salt and pepper to taste.  This was an amazing dish, a 5 for sure!

The pasta is really good but i feel like the 2 tablespoons of olive were unnecessary. You should add less olive oil or use some of the butter to cook the onions, otherwise it will have too much oil since pesto also has olive oil.

This was a great use for the leftover pesto I made.  I find pesto overwhelming on its own with pasta so this was perfect.  I halved the butter and used light cream instead of milk so no flour needed.  I also did not have tomatoes or mushrooms but did not miss them.  This really does serve eight people as it is rich.  This is a keeper!

So so so yummy! I even used less than half the amount of butter and 1% milk and it was creamy and delicious. I added the flour before the milk so that may have helped. I also ddded spinach instead of shrimp. Definitely make this!

Awesome, and to the review that was most critical..... you didn't even try it, you have no right to give this one star..... just because you have something against butter does not give you the right to bash another's recipe on here..... I don't like fish, that does not mean I go around looking for fish recipes and write bad reviews because it has fish. Super lame on you part. Back to the recipe I will most definitely use this again. That is all!!

This was delicious, though I had to make some changes because of what I had on hand. I completely omitted the butter and instead stirred the flour (I used 3 tablespoons) into the oil after sauteing the garlic and onion in it. I used nonfat milk, prepared pesto, and shredded Italian cheese blend. I served this on whole wheat noodles. Next time I will add shrimp or chicken, but it was great with tomatoes and kalamata olives.

It was a good, easy recipe. I made quite a few variations as this sauce was a last minute thing  and i didnt have all of the ingredients. i omitted the veggies (but not the onions), used some left over shredded mozzarella I had in the fridge instead of the Romano, and added some chilli powder in the sauce for a spicier kick. And I just chopped up some extra steak we had grilled for dinner the night before. Voila! Steak medallions in a light pesto garlic sauce!

Delicious!  I made a few minor adjustments.  I halved the butter and oil and I only used 1 cup of Romano cheese.  I also sautéed the mushrooms with the butter and garlic at the beginning.  This came out tasting like something you get in a restaurant.  It was amazing!

Love this recipe :) I followed it as written, but I halved the amounts and it made plenty for a family of four. I used chicken in place of shrimp, although I will try shrimp next time. It's EXACTLY like the new Chicken Pesto Penne I always order from Swiss Chalet, but BETTER :) Will make this again!

Excellent!! No need to buy sauce at the store anymore!  Added a little white wine to thin out the sauce and some fresh zucchini from the garden.  Delicious!

I really like the cream base with the pesto sauce- gives it a nice balance!  I did use 1/2 c. evaporated milk, 3/4 c. light sour cream & 1/2 c. parmesan for my cream sauce instead of the flour/butter/milk base.  Chicken & fresh tomatoes is a good addition too!

This is incredible.  Very easy to make.  I wasn't sure about adding the flour in with the milk.  So, I made a roux as I normally would when thickening sauces - I added the flour to the butter, onion, garlic mixture  and let it cook for about a minute and then added the milk.  Has worked fine both times.

The first time I made this with the pesto and it was fantastic.  The second time, I didn't add the pesto (as I didn't have any) but based on the ingredients I figured it would taste more like an alfredo sauce without it.  Sure enough, it did!  Great both ways.

So, so, good. I will make this again and again. I made it for guests this evening and it was a huge hit. I cut down on the butter substantially and used 1% milk and it was still very creamy. As one of my guests was vegetarian I omitted the shrimp. I also only used a couple tablespoons of pesto, and as other people suggested I sautéed the mushrooms with the onion and garlic. This one's a keeper! 5+ stars!

****Take 2**** Made this dish again tonight. Only 2 changes - cooked the garlic, mushrooms and onions down much longer. Also used the shrimp this time. Even more delicious than the firs time!

Wonderful recipe! We made a few changes...no mushrooms, halfed the butter and pesto (as others have suggested) and added a green onion. Other than that followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. We will definitely be making this recipe again.

OMG, this was so delicious!  I only used what I had on hand so I used half and half instead of milk and a tomato garlic pesto & added basil and used a combo of Romano, Parmesan & Mozzarella cheeses.  Oh, and I used a spinach fettuccini. Next time I will add the mushrooms a little earlier and give them time to get a bit more tender before adding the cheese and last few items.  My 17 yr old son said "this tastes like something you would get at Olive Garden!"  It is definitely a keeper, thanks for sharing the recipe, rosiella!

Very tasty sauce!  My family raved about this one and now it is a requested supper dish.  I made some adjustments as recommended by other members such as, less butter and oil, frying the mushrooms in the butter mixture (to make them crispy and delicious) and creating a roux.  I also purchased an already-made pesto mixture from Sobeys (it's really good).  Pine nuts are expensive and so this option is more affordable and tasted just as great.  I use linguine when I make this sauce but penne would be just as good.  Save some shredded romano for the end and sprinkle it on top.  Voila!

10/12:  I did this one today without the Mushrooms and it was great!  I would also consider w/ Chicken.  I think you could use much less butter although it adds great favor and texture.  The mushrooms I woudl think add a nice bit of texture as well.

So So So good. Way too heavy on the calories but who cares with this one. This was a hit with my vegetarian sister. We did not add chicken or shrimp and it was still fabullous. I only used one stick of butter and wheat flour (thats all I have) and sliced cherry tomatoes. Used 1/4 cup of Parmesan instead of romano (again, all I had) and still to die for.

This was soooo delicious and super fast and easy to make! I ended up using 1.5 lbs of medium sized shrimp in it, but next time I'll use 2 lbs because I love shrimp. The sauce was plentiful, and it stuck to the noodles so well. This dish was even delicious reheated! I'll definitely be making this again!

This sauce was pretty good.  My husband said he would add more cheese, I probably would too, but not in the sauce, but on top of the pasta before eating it to get a stronger flavour.  Other than that it was good :)

Loved this recipe!!!  I made my own pesto and replaced the milk with fat free cream and rice milk.  I reduced the butter by 1/2 and only used one clove of garlic.  I used spinach fetticuni noodles and left out the shrimp and mushrooms.  Added a bit more salt and this recipe rocks!!  Thanks!

This recipe is great!  I made several changes to make it less greasy.  First, I used "Pam" instead of the oil and butter. Second, instead of the 2 cups of milk, I put 1 cup of 1% milk and half cup of fat free sour cream.   The dish came out creamy and very tasty.

This was really good!  I had a bunch of pesto and some tagliatelle, and so I was looking for a good pesto cream sauce recipe.  This definitely fit the bill.  I liked that the sauce was based on a roux rather than using heavy cream.  Still, I did lighten it up a bit.  I used about one quarter the amount of butter.  I also used raw goats' milk rather than cows' milk because my partner can't take cows' milk.  I threw in some peas that we got in our CSA box and some chopped sundried tomatoes rather than the shrimp and mushrooms.  It was delicious.  It is on the heavy side, so you don't need much, but it's great for a cold, early Spring meal.

We made just the sauce without the mushrooms and shrimp. We used it for perogies. It was really good the first night, but made me a little sick for leftovers. Had to throw the remainder of it away.

I didn't have milk around so I used cream and about 1/2 cup of rice milk, also I used fetta cheese instead of ramano and semi-dried tomatoes instead of romas. I loved it! Nice and creamy

I've been looking for a pesto cream sauce that didn't require making the pesto first - and this one is pretty good! I used Trader Joe's pesto. My modifications: no shrimp or mushrooms (personal preference) and canned diced tomatoes rather than fresh, as it was what I had on hand. The tomatoes really added to it, IMO; I could have easily used an additional can. (I also browned and chopped some chicken breast for the household carnivore). The flavor was great, but you have to be in the mood for a very heavy sauce. I think half the butter would probably suffice. I will definitely keep this recipe and play around with it. :)

It could have been more flavorful. I added to cans of clams which made it better. Not thick enough.

I am a guy who is NOT a great cook, but this was easy and fun to make. My family and friends loved it. I did not include the tomato or mushrooms. I used pre-made pesto sauce from Trader Joe's.

Mmmm, I made I made this along with some steamed mussels, and modified BEst Lemondae Ever, delicious!! I couldn't believe I made this, my husband said it was beautiful!   I didn't have butter, I added the garlic in late, I used Mexican cheese as opposed to Romano, it's all I had! Still, this was a very beautiful meal. And, believe it or not, I used dried egg noodles instead of linguine, again, all I had.  Maybe because of all my modifications, it did need salt. Still great!

I did as suggested and added a little more flour and a little less butter. This is a delightful dinner. I'm vegetarian so I left out the shrimp. Scrumptious!

Delicious!  My husband called this "restaurant quality" pasta - and he's picky, even at restaurants.  I actually didn't put shrimp in, but I'll be doing that next time.  Since I didn't add shrimp, but wanted a little more texture I put in some slightly sauteed zucchini, which was also delicious.  Just a note, this recipe makes a ton of pasta (it says 6-8 servings, I would say it's at least 8!).  It was just the two of us (well, we have an 18 month old as well, but she's not crazy about pesto).  We had lots of leftovers, but they didn't last too long!

It was very good - nice and creamy. I didn't have enough of regular pesto so did half regular and half sundried tomato pesto. I also used 2 tbls less of the butter. I threw in a couple of handfuls of shredded mozzarella when adding the parm. cheese. Will make again.

This was good. I halved the recipe as I was making it for 1 and my sauce turned out very thick. I used a bit of chicken broth to thin it out. I also used parmesean cheese as I didn't have Romano, and I omitted the shrimp and mushrooms due to personal preference.

The person I made this for seemed to enjoy it but in my taste some of the measurements were kind of off?  I would use MUCH less Romano Cheese and much less pesto.  I would probably use less than a quarter cup of Romano and probably about the same for the pesto if not a little less.   I also used a drained can of diced tomatoes because I didn't have any fresh and they worked just fine.

This was really good! I used it as a side, so just the sauce (no meat) and tossed it with bow-tie pasta. Delicious, however it is very very rich!

I had a fabulous penne/seafood pesto meal at a high-class restaurant lately and wanted to re-create it in my own kitchen.  This recipe is it!  I followed the recipe almost as is.  (I generally don't think it's fair to rate a recipe if you make all sorts of changes, although I did use penne pasta and 1/3 half & half ^_^.)  This is a keeper, I will definitely be making this dish again!

Great recipe. I swapped chicken for the shrimp, used sun dried tomatoes, left out the mushrooms, and used half and half to change things up a bit and it worked out perfectly! Definitely recommend this with some minor mods to personal taste.

This was very good. I used sun-dried tomatoes pesto and chicken. Did not add tomatoes and lowered the butter just to sautee onions and garlic. Very fast and very good.

This was great I did change it alittle.  I added 1 cup heavy cream & 1 cup chicken broth instead of milk.  I also seasoned with various spices to taste and added italian cheese blend.  Served over noodles with Bruchetta Chicken...yummy

Sooo good! I don't think I added as much garlic as called for, even though I consider myself a garlic freak, 8 cloves just seemed like a lot.  This was sooo good, I used just the sauce on premade beef ravioli (allergic to shrimp).  I froze the leftover sauce (probably a good 8-10 Tbs) and am hoping it will keep well because I can't wait to have it again.

Just made it and loved it, feeling fat though! I did 1 c milk and 1 c cream and added slightly steamed brocolli, threw in fresh spinach when hot and bubbly. My husband loved it! Didn't use 8 cloves garlic as the classico pesto is very garlicy!

This was SO good & super easy to make.  The only thing I changed was that I used a can of Rotel (drained) instead of tomatoes.  Also, I added the uncooked shrimp in after the garlic & butter...I didn't want to dirty another dish cooking them by themselves.  I only cooked the shrimp for a few minutes then I continued on with the recipe as written.

I made this recipe tonight and all I can say is that is was incredible.  I have a picky wife as to what she eats (meat, potatoes gal) and she tried this and really liked it.  I did as well, what another user did and added grated parm.  I didn't however put the tomatoes in as I forgot to get them at the store but I am sure it would have made it just tasty.  I did put about a tablespoon of sugar to mine and made it a little sweet bite.  Very good recipe and would highly recommend to others to try.

Absolutely amazing!! I didn't have any trouble getting the sauce to come together and be creamy and I didn't have Romano cheese so I followed another reviewer and used grated Parmesan - delicious! I also had chicken instead of shrimp - this is something I'll be making ALL the time now, I couldn't believe out good it came out!

This comes out great without a ton of work.  After serving the kids I add some pepperoncinis sauteed in a bit of oil and red pepper flakes to the noodles and heat through once more in order to add a little "kick" to the sauce... then it is really great!  We also leave out the shrimp to make it vegetarian and I prefer some of the tomatoes thrown on top fresh.

This makes a good pasta dish but comes out bland. I made it the way the recipes states to make it and it took a while for it to thicken up. Also, this recipe needs salt! In the future I would use garlic salt instead of just simmering the garlic. Otherwise, decent recipe.

this recipe was great as is.  we just made it tonight and loved it.  nothing was changed except we used whole wheat angel hair pasta.  we usually substitute any pasta called for in the recipe to angel hair though, just because we LOVE angel hair.  the recipe makes A LOT.  we made the recipe as it is and it's just me and my honey and i think we have enough for 5 more plates.

we were also a little iffy about 20 mushrooms, we only used 10.  but actually, 20 would have been good, because we didn't realize how much the recipe actually made.

I thought this recipe was very good. I just made the sauce omitting the shrimp. I used cheese ravioli for the pasta and topped it with sun dried tomatoes and steamed asparagus. I will probably make this again.

Excellent flavor! I would add less Romano cheese (it made the sauce too stringy). Overall, my company loved it!

I love this recipe and make it often.  I pair it with Trader Joe's Gorganzola and Walnut tortellini.  I've also made it without mushrooms, but it's better with them!  It's best in the summer when the tomatos are good!

Cut the recipe in half, used spaghetti rigati noodles, and didn't have roma tomatoes so used one can of diced tomatoes instead. 

This recipe is so good and easy to make.  Will definitley make again.

This is a really good recipe. I didn't have flour at hand, so I used corn starch. I also added asparagus and scallops to the recipes. Turns out excellent.

I am usually a little overwhelmed by cream sauces, but this was delicious and not overly heavy.  I used an 8oz. package of sliced crimini mushrooms and then just chopped them, a total of 5 roma tomatoes, 10 cloves of garlic and 1/3 cup of butter but 4 Tbsp of olive oil.  I also used 1 1/2 pounds of shrimp which I think was more appropriate for the amount of sauce.  I will definitely make this again.  This recipe is so good you wouldn't even have to be afraid to serve it to company if you haven't made it before.

delicious!  I used a third cup of butter and skim milk and the sauce was just the right consistency.  I also added more tomato and spinach.  I did not feel that the tomatoes added too much water.  YUM i will make again!

This is one of my favorite recipes. Absolutely delicious. I've also added broccli and/or chicken in place of the shrimp. But the shrimp is the best.

I had a bottle of pesto and was not sure what to do with it, so I tested it out with this recipe. I substituted some cheddar for the Romano cheese because I don't have it at home.
I also stir-fried the mushroom + prawns with bacon and ham before adding it to the pasta. 

personally, I'm not much of a fan on rich creamy milky food, hence I did have problem finishing it; but I do think this will taste nice for ppl who like creamy stuff :)

Great Recipe! I only put in 1/2 a cup of romano cheese to cut back on the fat and calories and substituted sundried tomatoes instead of ripe tomatoes because I didn't have them on hand. Will add some roasted pine nuts next time for some added crunch and a little more garlic. My boyfriend thought it was restaurant worthy! Thanks for the great recipe!

I saw the picture for this recipe and had to try it. It's 10 AM here and I am eating pasta for breakfast, lol! It tastes delicious, I added a few more spices just because I was in the mood for a little more garlic. Great recipe , I also omited the flour and halved the butte(olive oil for hte other half). Turned out PERFECT and light.

My husband really liked this dish! We omitted the shrimp, since he doesn’t like seafood. Instead I added Italian sausage (with the casing removed). I added some red pepper flakes to “spice it up” a bit! I served this over homemade Ravioli. Overall this was very yummy and I will make it again. Thanks!!

I thought this was O.K.  I expected better with all the 5 star ratings.  Maybe it was the pesto I used, not sure.  My husband and I both thought it was pretty bland.

Versatile, tasty recipe. I made this without the shrimp or mushrooms and it still turned out great both times I made it. The only thing I would change is the amount of cheese. The first time I made it I halved the recipe and used 5oz of kraft parmesan cheese and it was really good, but the second time when I used 3/4 cup for another halved recipe it became clumpy. Still when you add the tomatoes it all ends well.

Excellent! I used cream and 1 TBL flour; a little less cheese and Parmesean/Romano mixed.  1-1/2 lbs shrimp.  Served over fresh linguine and it was great -- definitely a keeper - thanks!

This is simply a wonderful recipe. I made it for dinner yesterday night and my boyfriend couldn't stop raving about it! Will use again! *I used homemade pesto sauce and a little less cheese than called for, and no shrimp. Still turned out great! I will add chicken next time.

This was excellent!  It will all depend on your basil pesto, but this turned out great!  Will definitely make again!

Loved it!!  I made a few changes to the recipe to fit our tastes.  I sauteed the mushrooms before adding them.  I also used store bought TOMATO PESTO sauce instead of the tomatoes separately.  I also used Farfalle instead of linguini.  Enjoy

This recipe was almost 5 stars but not quite. It was pretty yummy but the cream sauce was a tad too floury. I used chicken instead of shrimp.It's very filling! Loved the taste of the mushrooms and tomatoes. Thanks for sharing!

Made this recipe exactly as it was written, and it was fabulous.  Very easy to make and delicious!  The only thing I might do differently next time is add some sliced sun-dried tomatoes and garnish with some toasted pine nuts and a chiffonade of fresh basil.

We made this the other day and left the recipe exactly as is, the only addition is we added freshly steamed PEI mussells, this recipe is a keeper, absolutely delicious.

good!  im not sure if it was the particular cheese that i used, but it seems the cheese made the sauce/cream very clumpy...i added milk and it helped, but next time i'd probably use less cheese in the sauce and add some ontop when served.  i also added more shrimp.

Absolutely delicious!  I made the recipe almost exactly, I just left out the mushrooms.  It was so yummy, my husband mentioned that it was just like at the restaurant, and even my 6 year old who is incredibly picky kept going on and on about how yummy it was.  Definitely a keeper.

This was awesome!  The only change I made was to omit the tomatoes (we just don't like them).  Next time I will add more shrimp and mushrooms, because it seemed to be mostly pasta, but the flavor was unreal!  I'll make this one again and again.  Thanks!

This is a fantastic dish!  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't add the shrimp. My husband thought this dish was one of the best I've prepared.  My 16 month old who seems to have developed gourmet taste couldn't get enough. The tomatoes and pesto added a nice flavor. Next time I'll try to add spinach.

We added frozen spinach, left out the mushrooms, cut the butter to a third, and had to replace the romano with nasty bland cheddar (all we had in the house)--the sauce was still very good, though it definitely wanted the bite of a sharper cheese.

This is a delicious recipe! It came out great and was fairly easy to make. I left out mushrooms because I don't care for them, and used a little less butter. Thanks!

Outstanding recipe!  I was looking for a creamy pesto sauce that came close to a dish I had at a favorite restaraunt of mine, and this is it.  I substituted chicken for the shrimp left out the mushrooms and would add a bit more tomato and a bit less oil.
