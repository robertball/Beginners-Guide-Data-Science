I used dark soy sauce and added in some chopped green onion. I chose not to add the additional salt only because soy sauce is plenty salty on it's own. I did marinate these chops overnight and most of the day. VERY good. We loved these chops. Quite flavorful. Paired well with homemade fried rice.

I gave this a 5 stars because it was VERY EASY AND VERY FLAVORFUL! I followed the recipe EXACTLY and for us it was a bit too much ginger, but its called Asian GINGER pork chops right? These pork chops grilled to a very NICE COLOR and I would try them again. Next time just for our taste I would cut the ginger to half the amount. But it is very good as is, ESPECIALLY to those ginger lovers out there! Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

This was great! My husband liked it so much he started stealing from the kids plates. He said I should absolutely make this again, so I guess I will. It was so easy to put together. I didn't put in the garlic chile paste because I don't have any - to the best of my knowledge I've never tasted it, so I didn't miss it.

These were good.  I didn't have any chili paste or orange zest and this may have intensified the flavors if I had used them.  The nicest thing about the marinade was I had most of the ingredients on hand.  I think I will pick up some chili paste next time I am at the store and give this another shot.

Only change was adding 2 green onions to the marinade.  Flavor was very strongly orange, yet tasty.  Next time I'll increase ginger to 3 T, garlic to 1 T or more.

I thought this was delish.  I added some honey for glazing and extra garlic.  The chops tasted great and I usually find them pretty boring.

This was my first time cooking pork chops and it was just delicious!!!! Everyone in my house loved it and it was really easy! I plan on using this recipe for those extremly busy days when I don't want to cook.  The ginger and chili paste were great additions!

I couldn't find chili garlic paste at the store, so I used Siracha instead. These pork chops were amazing! I also cheated and used canned ginger. I served it over some jasmine rice. I will definitely be making these when company comes over. I definitely don't think the siracha in this recipe would be too spicy for anyone.

Like many others, I didn't have the garlic chile paste, so I doubled the garlic and added chili powder. Very very tasty.  Everyone loved it.  Juicy, flavorful.  YUM!

Oh gosh, I LOVED these flavors.  I didnt have chile paste so just used some chili powder.  Didnt have chops but used pork steaks.  Loved, Loved, LOVED it!  I think I might have fixed them in the oven, but I can't remember that part.  It was a few weeks ago that I made them.  Thanks so much for sharing.

Loved it.  Didn't have garlic chili paste so I substituted with Heinz chili sauce and used ginger powder instead of minced ginger either.  Also, only had time to let them marinate for about 45 minutes so I cooked the chops on the skillet and then reduced the heat and poured the leftover marinade in the skillet and let the chops simmer for about 5 minutes.

These were really tasty, very orangy but that could be b/c they marinated over 24 hours.  We ran out of propane for the grill so I had to cook them on the stove top but they were still good, but def would have been better grilled.

It was easy to make and I had all ingredients on hand.  I marinated it for six hours.  Except for the taste of the ginger I really don't see what is Asian about this dish. It was tasty though and would make it again.

This was so good! Didn't have the garlic chile paste, so just used cayenne pepper instead. Used on some great butterfly pork chops.

Good recipe! I've made this sevral times. It's not WOW, but it gives the chops a nice flavor, and it's juicy and tender. I also added a few dashes of fish sauce.

I left out the orange zest, but followed everything else exactly. These were the moistest pork chops I've ever had! Even my 7 year old liked them, A LOT! Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

These were absolutely delicious! We were able to marinate them overnight. I also cooked some read onions with them in my pan as we were unable to grill them. Also served with a side of long grained brown rice.

This was really quick to make and the ingredients were on hand. I found the flavour could have been more intense or was missing something. Will try tweaking the ingredients if I try again.

A very good recipe, but I made a few adjustments according to what I had on hand.  I used "country spare ribs" (pork loin) and chili powder instead of paste.  I used fresh-squeezed OJ and grated fresh ginger instead of mincing it.  Because of weather we broiled the loin in the oven and I this was the most tender pork I have ever eaten.

Excellent and very simple recipe !! Made a few small changes overall but pretty much remained true to recipe. Didn't use orange zest or garlic chili paste since I didn't have any. per other reviewers i added some honey, chili powder,cayenne pepper and a little more orange juice to make up for the orange zest. Grilled the chops up and they came out great !! Wonderful smell and even better taste !!!

Being vegan, it's difficult for me to personally rate meat recipes, I rely totally on my family.  They enjoyed it.  I think next time I would marinade overnight, not the 2 hrs I had time for this on this occasion.

The marinade was great for my tofu!

My picky teenage son rated these as "the best pork chops ever" and begged me to make more soon. I did not have chili paste, so I used a little powder instead. It worked!

We only had 30 minutes to marinate and thought the flavors were good and balanced, but weak. I believe the key to this recipe is the long marinade time. Ginger is a favorite of ours and will add a bit more next time for a bolder taste.  Thanks for sharing!

The great thing about these chops is that they are really easy to make and they came out very juicy.  The taste, however, is just okay.  I might make them again, but probably only in a pinch.  I'll look for something with a bit more flavor.

I followed the recipe, but used two fresh oranges for the juice and zest.  Used a little extra Sambal Oelek chili paste, same maker as the Sriracha sauce.   Didn't add salt, because soy sauce is plenty salty.  Marinated for about three hours.  Everyone loved it!

This recipe was ok, it had a nice taste but probably wouldn't make again. I did buy the chili garlic sauce specifically for this recipe and couldn't taste garlic at all, just a bit of spice. I made it with a side of basmati rice and the broccoli/cauliflower steam bag, everything ended up tasting pretty bland together.

Excellent!!!!  The only thing I omitted was the cream cheese and orange zest. I didn't have garlic chili paste so I added chili powder & extra chopped garlic also didn't use pork chops I used chicken breast cut to 1/2 to 1/4 inch thick. My family LOVED this recipe.  It's a keeper!

Really good one. As others mentioned, I didn't add the additional salt due to the soy sauce. Didn't need it. I also grilled some scallions and cut them up to use for garnish on the chops.

I honestly can't even give this 4 stars because I couldn't taste ANY of the ingredients. Everything I used was fresh including juicing an orange from my own trees and there was barely a hint of orange flavor and the ginger didn't come through at all. The pork was juicy but otherwise this was nothing special for us. Thanks for sharing though.

Like the citrus taste very much! A very subtle marinade, which we enjoy over overpowering marinades. I skipped the salt as there is already soy sauce and the garlic chile paste is salted already. Glad I did that.

Great marinade.  I liked the lighter notes of the citrus with the salty soy, and fresh ginger really made this.  Will use again!

Oh My!  Very juicy, tender and flavorful...I marinated 6 thick cut loin chops on sunday in anticipation of Monday night dinner, but ended up having to wait till wednesday to grill 'em up.  They came out superb! The flavors compliment the meat very well, and there's a touch of heat and sweetness to the dish which I love.  Served these up with a sautee of portabella 'shrooms and snow peas in garlic n soy sauce, and there was nothing left at the end of the meal.

1st post for me, that's how yummy this was...  Used all ingredients with thick bone in chops.  (Seems to keep meat tender)  I actually marinated 2 days.  This was the best pork chop I ever grilled.

I never know what to do with pork chops so I was very happy to find this recipe.  I couldn't find the garlic chili paste so I used A Taste of Thai Garlic Chili Pepper Sauce instead. I thought the orange zest would be to much but instead it was a nice touch.    I marinaded these overnight and then cooked them on the grill.  I absolutely  loved these.   They will be added to my dinner rotation.

Loved this! So tangy and delicious!
I added some sesame oil and substituted the chilli paste for chilli flakes. I made this in a frying pan on the stove and it turned out amazing! This is definitely going on my dish repertoire :)
And a little tip: if you do make this in the frying pan, don't waste the delicious sauce that comes off the meat while cooking - I fried some mushrooms in it and that was a tasty side to the dish. Didn't have to add anything to the mushrooms!

I thought this was excellent! I hand squeezed juice from the orange and used about half of the zest called for. I didn't have garlic chili paste so I used garlic chili sauce. I also increased garlic, that's just how I live life. The result was a refreshing and crisp flavor. Just perfect. Will be making this again!

This simply rocks! I have made this three times now and it is the best version of ginger pork chops I have had. I will say that I don't think two hours of marinade time is enough for good flavor. I would recommend six or more based on trying different approaches.

The key to this is fresh ginger and fresh garlic.  I used dried peppers from our CSA and this gave a nice bite to the marinade.  Reserved about 1/4 cup marinade to brush on the chops, but I was unable to get the grill to fire up (too cold outside) I pan seared the chops, the poured in reserved marinade, covered the pan, and simmered for about 10 minutes.  Nice glaze and very tender meat.

This was the best marinade I have ever used on pork chops; all of my friends agreed.  I omitted the orange zest (forgot...oops) and added a bit of worchteicher sauce...would totally recommend!
