Great recipe as I concocted it...Used only oil (quite a bit less) in a non-stick pan to stir-fry chopped frozen broccoli pieces with minced garlic (same time) and-a little bit of-basil. Sprinkled one chicken boullion cube over this and added water before covering to cook. I also added some pasta water from (under)cooking bowties instead of rigatoni and then finished cooking the noodles with the broccoli mixture for a couple of minutes. Served with parm on top for a delicious  and fitting side to chicken marsala. Mmmm

What a sad disappointment!!!  I made this recipe with high expectations...I absolutely LOVE broccoli, and I thought the combination of broccoli and pasta would be a sure hit.  Unfortunately, I was so disappointed.  I followed the recipe to the letter, even added some extra italian spices to give it more flavor, but even that and the fresh basil could not save this pasta.  It turned out very bland--only remedied by adding a ton of parmesan cheese on the pasta.  I wish this had been better; I have still to find an excellent pasta and broccoli recipe.  Although it was easy to make, I unfortunately don't recommend this recipe.

One of my favorite dishes, which I've been eating on a weekly basis for years. I also usually make mine with chicken broth ( I use a little more than a cup for a pound of pasta) and just a sprinkle of dried basil. Crushed red pepper flakes are a nice touch as well. Any kind of tubular pasta will do for this dish, even large elbow macaroni. You just want a shape that will hold on to the broth. Mangia!

This was a great side dish!  I cut down the olive oil significantly and used chicken broth instead of veggie.  I also used dried basil.  Thanks for sharing:)

I know it sounds like it will be bland, but this was great. Now like pasta salad it gets dry once the pasta sucks up the sauce, but when fresh it was heavenly. I added some butter when reheating and it was good too. I recently served this with crab stuffed mushrooms and a strawberry salad.
UPDATE: I made this again last night and has a bunch of bacon I needed to use up. I cooked the bracon and crumbled it into this dish and added a little extra broth while cooking the broccoli. It was awesome and I will added bacon whenver I make it.

Very good, simple dish. I used beef broth instead of vegetable broth, as well as dried basil instead of fresh. I added some italian seasoning, onion powder, and a bit of fresh lemon juice at the end. It may have been a bit bland for my taste without the additions I made. I sprinkled in some mozzerella on the leftovers and it was a nice touch. Four stars for the recipe as written, and 4.5 with my alterations.

So good and easy! I added some sliced fresh button mushrooms I needed to use up and also a pinch of crushed red pepper. I also only had chicken broth so used that. Would be wonderful with some sliced grilled chicken or shrimp tossed in for the meat eaters.

Very quick and easy meal to prepare and clean up!  My husband and I both loved it!  I added some crushed red pepper for a little extra flavor and skipped the margarine/butter to cut out fat/calories.  Also, I added a few tbsp of the starchy water I boiled the pasta in to the simmering broccoli.

This is ABSOLUTELY a staple in my house now, both kids (2 and 4) love it.  My 4 year old requests it all the time and it is the ONLY way he eats broccoli.  So tasty, healthy, and most of all--EASY!!--THANK YOU!!!

I absolutly loved this and so did my kids and hubby, but I changed it up a lot with the suggestions of others. When I first added this recipe to my box I thought it sounded so good but then realized it would be bland so I thought of adding chicken then I read a lot of the reviews and ended up changing alot of things. First added chicken cooked it in a bit of oil and added a few seasonings to the chicken, after the chicken was cooked I pulled it out of the pan and put it in with the cooked noodles. I then sauted the garlic with the broccoli and then added a few red pepper flakes, Onion and garlic powder. I melted garlic butter in a pan and poured it over the noodles, chicken and broccoli and then added the cheese then tossed it all together. I then added a bit more cheese to the top! It was great even the next day cold or reheated. My daughter took it for her school lunch cold.

I've used this basic recipe but added or replaced the broccoli with other fresh veggies like summer squash, green beans, red pepper slices, and zucchini. I've also made it a one-pan meal by adding in the uncooked pasta and increasing the amount of stock/broth. So saute the veggies in oil & garlic, then add in 3 cups broth and 1 pound uncooked pasta, cover and simmer until pasta is cooked al dente. Add water or more broth if needed to cook pasta through.

I really liked this recipe! I sauteed the broccoli in olive oil and garlic powder, salt, and pepper. When it was finished I tossed in the cooked noodles. No cheese or basil, though both of those would have made it even better. So easy and so tastey!

Sorry, this was really bland. I did all I could to increase the flavor but it just didn't happen.  I don't think basil pairs well with broccoli either.

A three star review (by my family's standards) means it was good and we'll make it again, but wouldn't go out of my way to share the recipe. Very easy and good. I did add tuna and extra vegetables (red and orange peppers) and didn't use butter, and used whole wheat pasta.

I made a couple of changes to the original recipe. I used chicken broth, not vegetable and dried basil not fresh.  We really liked the flavor, but to me it felt like it was missing something.  I am going to put this in my meal rotation however because both my children ate it.

We made this with rotini, and only used 6 tablespoons of olive oil, not 8 (8 tablespoons is way too much oil considering the 2 tablespoons of butter!)

It came out fantastic but needed some salt to taste. We added turkey bacon, chopped in pieces, to the dish to give it some kick. Meat adds a lot to this dish. Overall, a very flavorful and great filling meal.

Delicious!  This turned out better than I expected with the reviews claiming it was bland.  I tried my best to stick to the original recipe but I did add onion with the garlic and pretty much tripled the cheese.  I  know it isn't exactly as healthy with all the cheese but it really turned out great when it melted and soaked up some of the broth making it more of a sauce.  With my changes I give it 5 stars but as is it would have been a little bland so I gave it 4.   I will make this again.  It was very quick and my husband gave it two thumbs up.

My family and I thought this was just OK, nothing spectacular.  It tasted fine, just nothing WOW.  I did add some canned chicken to make it more of a meal.  Plenty of leftovers.

I give this recipe 5 stars because it is SO easy, and made with all things that I already have in my kitchen.  Great last minute meal!  I also added a good basalmic vinegar (3-4 TBS) and it made a HUGE difference.  Also this dish would be good if you grilled chunks of chicken along with the garlic and broccoli.

As others have said, this recipe is just okay as is.  I added about 6 strips of chopped bacon, red pepper flakes and some cooked shrimp to take it up a notch.  Also increased the Parmesan cheese to about 1/2 cup (and used freshly grated) and decreased the olive oil to 6 Tbsp.  Both the kids and my husband said this should be in the regular rotation!

Very bland. Had to take readers reviews and add, lemon juice, double the broth, and extra seasonings to make it have flavor; also feta cheese.

Made this with slightly less olive oil, but just as listed for the rest.  Very pleased with it.  Simple and tasty and good as leftovers too.

Bland Bland Bland.  Did I mention bland.  This looked promising but the family all agreed that it was not real good.  Oh well you live and learn.  Needs some kind of spice to it.  I added chicken and sauted the breast but still was not something ill try again.

5 stars with slight modifications:  Chicken broth instead of veggie, dash of red pepper flakes and lastly, stirred in about 3/4 cup ricotta cheese at the end.  I also added about 1/2 cup fresh parm cheese instead of the 2 tablespoons. Made a nice creamy-like sauce with these additions.  Final note- make sure to sautee garlic for a good 5-7 minutes for a nice garlicky taste!

With a few modifications this recipe was delicious. I added some salt, red pepper flakes, and some chopped onion to the broth. I also reduced the oil as some of the other reviewers suggested. I will definitely make this again!

Make sure to use FRESH broccoli for the very best flavor.  What an amazing and tasty meal!  We were looking to cut down on our meat intake on at least one dinner per week, this one is our new favorite!

This recipe was delicious, filling, and quick.  I did take the advice of the previous posters and added a bit to the recipe and I do believe that without the extra additions it wouldn't have been as good.  Since I try to eat healthy I cut the oil & butter in half (and it was more than enough). I added red pepper flakes to the broccoli and garlic, cooked for about 3 minutes and then added the broth as instructed. After the broccoli was cooked, I added the pasta along with lemon juice, basil, and shredded mozarella.  Pretty yummy. :)

Delicious basic dish. My additions were 1 TBL italian spices and 1/4 tsp.red pepper flakes, and only 1 TBL basil. What made it 5 stars for me was sauteing it with mushrooms and cherry tomatoes, then cornstarch to thicken sauce just a bit. This helped with the taste and look which made it a great meal instead of a side dish.

I enjoyed this, and it was fairly easy to make. I used frozen broccoli because that was what i had. It needs a little more flavor...red pepper flakes, italian seasoning, salt, pepper...whatever! The parmesan really helped. I will make this again because it was liked, just might tweak it a little more.

Made as the recipe stated except adding lemon pepper sea salt.  This recipe was bland as directed.  Not real sure how to make it more flavorful -- maybe adding hot Italian sausage??

I was a little apprehensive about this recipe because everyone said "bland" so I did slightly reduce the oil, forgot the butter (oops!), used more cheese - a LOT more fresh cheese, subbed dry Italian seasoning for fresh basil (garden isn't ready yet), and sprinkled crushed red pepper flakes.  FABULOUS!  My son even ate the broccoli - a first without it being a quiche.  We're having it cold for lunch tomorrow & probably warm for dinner over the weekend.  


I would definitely make this again because it's easy, delicious, and made with simple everyday ingredients.

This was okay. kinda bland. I tweaked it by adding some roasted chicken that I had leftover and also some kielbasa sausage that I had grilled.  2 TBSPs of Parmesan is a joke!  I added about a cup and it still needed help.

I really liked this dish because it helped us to eat healthier without loosing flavor! However, I definitely agree to cut the oil amount in half, because with the amount on the recipe it just makes it too oily. But besides that I will definitely make this again!

I loved this!  Very quick, easy, light and tasty.  I sauteed onion as well when I through in the garlic, used chicken broth instead of vegetable (all I had) and added crushedred pepper.  Made the dish colorful and added a little zing.  I'm always looking for ways to get more vegetables in our diet and the broccoli was perfect in this.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

:\ sorry. I hate to give a less than great review but it has to be done sometimes as so many of us with particular tastes rely on these. I think this would have been great with an alfredo sauce...but there is just something about the basil and broccoli that really doesn't work for me or my family. We all agreed a sauce would have helped but on its own the basil is too over powering.

it was very good as a side dish but i don't think i would use it as a main dish unless i put chicken in with it. I also used a bit more basil then in the recipe required.

Thank you for the great starter idea to season broccoli. Both of my picky eaters loved it! I skipped adding the butter, sauteed the garlic only briefly so it wouldn't become bitter, sauteed the (frozen) broccoli, added 3 cups of water (to cover) and a couple of crushed bouillon cubes (what was on hand), basil, onion powder and piccolini (wagon wheels) since it only takes 7 minutes to cook. Brought it to a boil, covered & simmered for the 7 minutes, served with the Parmesan. Quick, simple, yummy and healthy! Awesome!

I added red pepper flakes, and used chicken broth in place of the vegetable broth.  It turned out delicious!  I have tried it the original way and it was quite 'blah'.  I make this often with those two small changes, and we really like it.

I just finished cooking this EXACTLY as the recipe stated and like the other reviews said, it is quite bland. I added some creole seasoning on my plate which helped. Also, I cooked up some ground beef and added that to the mix.

Very simple and easy recipe. I added probably 1/2 cup of fresh grated parmesan and whole wheat rigatoni. The fresh basil gives a nice flavor and even the kids loved it.

This was surprisingly disappointing to me because while cooking, it was so fragrant and great consistency.  I will try one more time and use smaller pasta, maybe penne and a little bit more broccoli.  Possibly throw in some cream cheese with the Parmesan to moisten it up a bit. Mmm mmm, smelled so delicious but was a bit sticky and bland.

Made this tonight for dinner and I agree as written is bland. Had to doctor it up by adding 2 bouillon cubes, a tsp of red pepper flakes and salt and pepper. We added more cheese. With the changes I was asked to make it again.

After following the recipe, the dish was pretty bland.  It needed quite a bit of salt and pepper to add flavor.  It's a great base recipe though, and it would be good with various types of veggies and herbs.

Love this recipe. It is my go to since i always have broccoli, pasta and broth on hand.  I do like to use chicken broth and shred some rotisserie chicken into the dish.  Fresh basil and good Parmesan cheese really makes it though.

Love Love Love. This is one of my favorite recipes. I'm a pescaterian that doesn't eat dairy (I opt out of the pharm...). This light pasta is a perfect dinner for me. I usually add mushrooms when I add the broccoli, using more mushrooms and more broccoli than I think I'll need. The dish usually ends up being a lot of past and not enough veggies. The next time I make this, I'm going to add a pound or so of pre-cooked frozen shrimp. I can't wait. I've yet to try some kind of whole wheat noodles instead of the white rigatoni, but that sounds delicious also. Or I could see it being delicious with brown rice. SO GOOD. EAT THIS.

I REALLY wanted to like this, and I followed the recipe to a T and it was easy, but it turned out amazingly bland saved only by adding WAY more parm in addition to a ton of salt & pepper. Sorry, not gonna try again.

I'm not sure why others have called this bland?!? As long as you activate your garlic (i.e. cook it long enough) and use the full amount of butter (I cut back on the oil), this is a wonderful aioli type sauce!  If it needed anything it was perhaps a touch of white pepper.  Adding some additional italian type herbs (thyme, oregano) might work as well.  Make sure you use the right amount of fresh basil too!!

I have to agree with other reviewers, this was pretty bland, and I added lots of extra spices/flavoring based on other reviews. I think I'll try it again but with a cream sauce maybe?

This recipe is very good WITH some slight changes, otherwise it will be bland.  After I changed it, it was really great and I'm making it again tonight!  Flavor EACH layer

Boil pasta with salt and garlic in the pasta water!
Cook broccoli with a pinch of salt and garlic
Add more Parm (use fresh)

Enjoy!

I used this recipe based on the "6 Dinners under $100" menu.....perfect vegeterian meal w/ bread and a salad!  It was an easy quick main dish to make on a weeknight - we love mac n cheese and alfredo and this fits easily into that category. We will be adding this to our menu regularly!!

It was quick and easy to make.  I didn't think it had enough taste to it.  Bland tasting.  But I will make it again and just add ingredients to it.

I made some changes to this recipe and it's now my husband's favorite.  I added shrimp with the broccoli, I also added some red pepper seeds.  To make the sauce even yummier - I added a half can of cream of chicken soup with half the amount of chick broth called for.  Delicious!!

SO easy to make! Very yummy I added 1/2 cup of parmesan and some feta, I'm vegetarian but I imagine that adding some grilled chicken into the mix would also spice things up if this is too bland for your liking

This is an easy recipe and best of all my finicky kids ate it without complaint. I don't know if this dish could stand alone as a meal in my house, though. I cooked some sweet Italian sausage and served it with the pasta and broccoli.

Delicious!!! I would definitely use FRESH grated parmesan cheese. I also used dry basil, because thats what I had available as well as chicken broth and it was still very good. Used about a teaspoon or so of red pepper flakes. I am making this again tonight but adding sliced mushrooms and cooked chicken.

This was super easy and really good. My only change would be more broccoli... I was hoping for a broccoli dish with pasta and it's more like a pasta dish with broccoli...if that makes sense.

This was soooo good!! I was so suprized at how wonderful it was.  I try to eat really healthy and I am also on a college budget so I made a few modifications: -I used brown rice penne pasta (trader joes) to make it a bit healthier. I cut the serving to two instead of six since I was just making it for myself and my lunch tomorrow. I didnt measure how much pasta but just used aboiut 1/3 of the bag. -I used less butter, about one teaspoon of I cant believe its not butter. -I didnt have fresh basil...actually i did! but i forgot I had it so I just sprinkled some dried basil. -I only had sprinkle parmesen not the good fresh stuff. -The recipe didn't really explain how to cut the broccoli, so i just chopped it up into a size i prefered. -i had it with a small salad on the side.  Despite not having all the exact ingredients, it was sooo wonderful. I can't wait to make it for my boyfriend this weekend!

I made a few additions to this because other reviewers warned it might be bland. It came delicious!  I didn't have chicken broth handy so I just used a cup of the pasta water and I also added baby belle mushrooms and sliced olives. Also used a bit of garlic powder and italian seasoning.  Loved it!!

Yummy, I made this tonight everyone loved it.  I'm going to try it next week with broccoli rabe and chicken.  

There is a restaurant by me that makes this dish with broccoli rabe, chicken or sausage. I have been trying to figure out what else they put in the sauce and this is it.  Thanks for the recipe

Thanks for this very easy delicious recipe! I made it with Cellentani pasta and added chopped onions  fresh mushrooms and some  Italian  seasonings. This recipe is perfect for all kinds of add-ins. I think next time I may add chicken or shrimp.

This was an okay recipe.  I used it as a jumping off point and added a little lemon and some sliced leftover chicken.  As written I thought it was a tad dull, but so easy and simple, and you can quickly adjust to your taste.  A good basic recipe that can be made your own.

I thought this was pretty good. I used chicken broth and actually thought you would use more than 1 cup. I thought it could have been more salty.

I love this recipe and so does my 2 yr old son.  The only thing I do differently is I use chicken broth (that's how my mom showed me) and I don't add the basil.

This is a great, healthy recipe to make if you really like broccoli and want something simple and easy.  We added garlic toward the end though, because it seemed like the garlic's flavor was being cooked through - I would recommend either adding garlic to this recipe or not cooking it for any time  before adding the broccoli.

Great flavor! I didn't use the whole box of pasta, however. I used chicken broth instead of the veggie broth, but it still tasted great.

Really great and really easy.  As a college student who enjoys cooking its a great balance between a quality meal and short prepare time.  I use chicken broth and it tastes excellent anyway!

We loved this dish. I did make it my own though, with a few changes. I roasted the broccoli in the oven with olive oil and lots of fresh minced garlic, then added the broccoli with the hot oil from the pan to the pasta. The roasting added so much more depth to the garlic! Afterwards, I added some high quality olive oil to the dish and served with salt and freshly shredded Parmesan cheese. Quick & simple mid week supper.

My family made a variation of this quite a bit when I was growing up. I made a pound of bacon, drained the bacon fat, and used only half of the olive oil called for in this recipe. I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, amd elbows instead of rigatoni. The kids like this with grated parmesan; the adults like parmesan and red pepper flakes. Easy and very tasty! I'll make this again!

Great recipe. I used more garlic because my family likes it a lot .  You also may want to save 1/2 to 1  cup of pasta water before you drain it  in case the  pasta dries out  as it sits.

Pretty good. Customized it a bit - added a little salt and used some reserve pasta water for sauce. Then mixed in a little lemon juice. Good simple dinner.

As this was my first time trying this recipe i followed what it said perfectly. Maybe added a little more than one cup of broth because it didn't seem to be enough liquid. It definitely needs more flavor it was a little bland for my taste.. I would have made it again in the future with a couple of changes but it gave everyone heartburn for some reason and that is not normal for my family.

Very simple and good. I used more garlic, because we are garlic-lovers. :) This is not a strongly flavored dish, but it's not bland either. Cooking the broccoli in vegetable broth makes it very tasty.

Very good easy recipe - I only used 2 Tbs of Olive Oil and 1 Tbsp of Light Butter because the other amount just seemed excessive to me and I didn't want to make the meal that fattening. I added 5 cloves of garlic, about a 1/4 cup of onion, and used 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth (i can't find vegetable broth anywhere)i thought it came out very well and so did my husband - ate this with the Amish white bread from this site and the meal was complete!

I loved this dish!  It was a huge hit with my boyfriend, very light and tasty.  I added a little bit more EVOO at the end and mixed a parmesan/romano blend of cheeses in with a bit of salt and pepper. I also poached chicken in broth then shredded and added in with the broccoli mixture. Otherwise, no changes!  Plus, it got my boyfriend to eat the "little trees" referred to as broccoli.  Will make again!

This was a good basic recipe that, after my improv tweakings based on what I had on hand, was fantastic. My changes: I roughly quartered the recipe and cooked the rigatoni in diluted beef broth. I used ~1/2 cup leftover lightly steamed frozen broccoli and supplemented that with half a can of sliced mushrooms, drained. I used margarine instead of butter along with the olive oil and sauteed the mushrooms before adding the garlic (jarred, minced, increased to ~3/4 Tbsp). I added beef broth instead of veggie and dried basil instead of fresh (decreased to ~1/2 Tbsp). Finally, when I added the broccoli, I also put in a splash of lemon juice and a ladle of pasta water/broth. There were no leftovers. :)

This was quick, easy, and delicious. I was just looking for a side dish, so I didn't use the pasta. It was very good and had several request the recipe. 
Thanks!

I thought this was very bland (I even added red pepper flakes, 5 cloves garlic, sunflower seeds, and Italian dressing).  I think that lemon zest would have been a good addition.  Not sure how I'll fix up the leftovers.

This dish was really good.  I did make some changes.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  I used 6 garlic cloves instead of four and only cooked them briefly before adding the broccoli.  I also gave it a couple good shakes of italian seasoning and a couple smaller shakes of cayenne pepper, which added just a little bite.  Finally I used an organic sprouted wheat pasta from Trader Joes which gave it a more complex taste.  Next time I might add some chicken.

This was very good, reminded me of my moms!  My son even ate some of the broccoli!  The only thing I did different was I didn't add the basil, and I halved the recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

Not the best recipe I have used off this site. It was just OK. Nice to have a change from the normal cheese sauce but will not rush to make this again too soon.
