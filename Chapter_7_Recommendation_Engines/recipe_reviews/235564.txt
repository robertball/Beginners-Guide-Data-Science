The 1st time I made this, I loved the flavor of the crust...that hands down is really good! Then came the mousse, it was very strong and overpowering with peanut flavor. I felt I followed it to a T but after 2 hours in the frig....it was flopping and wouldn't hold shape very well after I cut into slices. And felt this should be freezer style pie. But if set up over night, it held way better. Having said that, I made it a 2nd time. One, I didn't care for the peanuts in the pie, rather it be sprinkled on top as a garnish...just my feeling on that. 2nd, needs a FULL 8oz package of cream cheese because it needed to be thicker and I did add the additional cream cheese on the 2nd round to accommodate that adjustment. 3rd, at 1st I thought there was too much whip topping in the mouse because it didn't hold up very well the 1st time. But after rethinking on the 2nd round, the whip topping really needed to be very stiff, so if you chose to use a non-dairy prepared whip topping....might not be a good idea. I made sure my whip topping was stiff enough and when I added it to the 2nd batch, it help so well, it was really ready to slice and go. Having made the changes with the additional cream cheese, then making sure my whip topping was very stiff, and leaving out the peanuts....I found I totally loved the recipe. Will make it again with my modifications.

I modified this recipe quite a bit in order to reduce the overall fat and calories.  With my changes, I was able to shave off about 150 calories. I used 8 oz reduced fat cream cheese and reduced the butter.  Used Cool whip free instead of the whipped cream. It was still very tasty, but a little less of a guilty pleasure. I refrigerated it overnight. It held together beautifully even after sitting at room temp for a significant amount of time.  With my changes, the filling took on more of a cheesecake texture, but we were fine with it.  I will be making this again in the future with all my changes.

We were surprised the Ritz crackers made such a tasty crust that held together nicely! I omitted the peanut butter from the crust. I also cut the peanut butter in the filling in 1/2 and I made my own whipped cream. I did not like the peanuts in the pie. I would omit them if I made this again. I made this in the food processor which made quick work of mixing everything together so the filling wasn't grainy from the sugar, but even with cutting down the peanut butter by 1/2 I felt this was very peanut buttery, so I made a chocolate sauce and that helped tremendously! The pie held its shape nicely after spending a few hours in the fridge and topped with chocolate sauce and homemade whipped topping we were able to cut down on the strong peanut butter flavor and enjoy it. If you love peanut butter this is the pie for you!

Delicious! Hubby and I love peanut butter pie so I decided to try this to celebrate our anniversary. I omitted peanuts in the filling and sprinkled some on top as the only modification. I whipped the cream until it was very stiff as shown in the video. This helped the pie hold together better since only 4oz of cream cheese was used. We loved the lighter mousse texture this created instead of the cheesecake density produced by 8oz of cream cheese. This is my new favorite recipe.

I made this after a coworker brought it in and we all devoured it! I tried getting experimental and added chocolate chips thinking it would be like a Reese's peanut butter cup. Don't do that. The recipe is perfect as-is and adding the chocolate chips actually disrupted the perfect texture that my colleague's version had. And use smooth peanut butter with the fresh chopped peanuts. I tried it with chunky peanut butter to save a step and it wasn't the same.

The filling was a tad grainy at first. Added first addition of whipped cream and decided to fold in the additional 2/3 of cream without whipping it. Much easier to incorporate. Used the "whipped" cream for garnish.
