Very rich and tender lasagne and easy/quick to prepare.  But a few additions:  add 1/2 box of 10oz. frozen, chopped spinach to meat mixture while cooking for more nutrition & color.  Moms, this is a good way to sneak in something green.  Also, as previous reviews states, the cottage cheese needs one egg to bind together or else it's too runny. And add a few dashes of grated nutmeg to cottage mixture- (an old italian secret!).  And one more trick for lasagna makers: no need to wash an extra pot to boil lasagna noodles.  Put very hot tap water into a large bowl and soak the raw, hard noodles for 20-30 min.  Noodles won't be cooked, but soft and can complete it's cooking in the oven.  I learned this trick from a caterer, try it!

This is truly a fast (45 minutes to prepare ingredients) and easy recipe.  This was my first lasagna ever, and it turned out really tasty.  I did use Ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese (wanted a classic feel), however, I don't think it had any impact on the taste.  I read all of the reviews and based on all suggestions made the following alterations:
1.  Doubled the meat amount.
2.  Added 1 teaspoon dried oregano to meat/spaghetti sause mixture.
3.  Added 1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasonig to meat/spaghetti sause mixture.  
4.  Used Presco Spaghetti sause with mushrooms
5.  Added 1 teaspoon dried oregano to cheese mixture.
6.  Added 2 eggs to cheese mixture
7.  Added 2 teaspoons of fresh minsed parsley to cheese mix
8.  Added a layer of sauteed mushrooms after the meat layer.
9.  Added a few slices (5 per layer) of Provologne cheese after the mozarella, except for the top (no Provologne cheese there).
10.  Did not grease the pan, but put a layer of meat instead.
11.  Did not cook the lasagna noodles beforehand.  They cooked very well in the oven.
12.  Kept in the oven heated to 350F for about 50 minutes.

Next time I'll try Italian sausage and some garlic in the cheese.

By far the best lasana I've ever had.  Almost too easy to be true!!  The only alteration I make is I mix the two cheeses together along with two eggs which holds it together better.  When I get to the top layer I top the last layer of cheese mixture with a light layer of only mozzeralla chesse.  Make it the night before and bake it the next day---really lets the flavor set in!! YUMMM!!

This recipe turned out very good....but of course I tweaked it a little bit.  I used a pound and a half of ground beef due to other's suggestions to add more beef.  I used one whole medium onion, chopped, and 2 tablespoons of chopped garlic, and sauteed them before adding them to the browned meat.  I spiced that up with a little salt and pepper, garlic powder, and italian seasoning.  I then added just enough gravy (spaghetti sauce) to the meat mixture so it was absorbed, but not runny, then I let that simmer.  (Hint - use at least 52 oz. of sauce total in the recipe, or else your lasagna will be dry.)  Meanwhile I mixed up the cheeses (I substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese and locatelli for the parmesan - more authentic) and used Barilla lasagna noodles and did not boil them first - followed the no boil suggestion.  I layered with my ingredients according to the Barilla box - but sprinkled a little Italian seasoning on the final layer of mozzarella cheese.  Covered with foil and baked at 360 for 55 minutes, then removed the foil and baked for another 5 minutes.  My husband could not wait to eat it, and he has been raving about it for 3 days now.  Thanks to Bob and Barilla!

Bob is my hero! My family would eat this every night if I would make it. I discovered this recipe in december and have made it 6 times in the last 2 months! Based on other reviews I made three small changes; I used no boil lasagna noodles, 2 (26 oz) jars of spaghetti sauce, and I mixed 1 (15 oz)pkg. ricotta cheese with the cottage cheese. Perfect every time. Thanks Bob.

A very good basic recipe. I did make a few changes; I used no-boil pasta, 2 (26 ounce) jars of sauce, added 1 pound of sweet italian sausage (boiled 1st for an hour then sliced & put into sauce) & 32 ounces of riccota (mixed w/ 1 egg & 1/4 cup of grated parmesan)instead of the cottage cheese. I baked at a temp of 375.  Cooked covered with tin foil for about 40 minutes & then uncovered for 20 minutes.  Came out fantastic...good enough for Italian inlaws on Christmas Eve.

This was really good and super easy.  However, I would recommend that you add more sauce because I ran out and had to open another jar and used about 1/2 of it.  Also, don't grease the pan, just add a thin layer of the meat sauce and it won't stick.  I substituted 1.5 bls of ground turkey for the beef and fresh garlic for the garlic salt.  This was my first time making lasagna, so I was a little lost as to what to do for the top layer since the directions were vague.  For the last layer, it's noodle, sauce, then mozzarella cheese.  And at the last 10 mins, I sprinkled on parmasan and it was good.  Thanks for sharing.

I tried this as a change to my usual recipe. Maybe it's just my mediterranian backround but I didn't think this lasagna was so "awesome"...actually I found it to be fairly bland tasting and I felt it could do with a good dose of herbs. I also found that using the exact quantities outlined in this recipe, that the meat sauce was half what I needed to complete the layers. 
No way does this recipe serve 12 people. 
I think this lasagne would be OK for those used to "American Italian" cooking but I'll be sticking with the traditional recipe given to me by my Italian neighbour.

Absolutely wonderful!  I followed the suggestions to add more cottage cheese, and I also added the 1/2 cup of water to the sauce so I didn't boil the noodles..  I also covered the lasagna with aluminum foil for the last 20 minutes, because it had already gotten pretty brown.  Perfect, and my husband loved his birthday dinner.  Thanks, Bob!!

Fantastic. This was my 1st time making lasagna and my bf said it was the best lasagna he's ever had! Thanks to the suggestions of others the dish couldn't have turned out any better. My adjustments. 1.) Whole wheat noodles, 2.) Sauteed fresh chopped garlic with onion before adding beef, added oregano and italian seasoning 3.) Added chopped/drained spinich to meat /sauce mixture 4.) Cheese mix: used 1/2 ricotta, 1/2 cottage cheese, 1lb mozzarella mixed all together with 1 egg. 5.) Baked covered with foil for 50 min, uncovered for 10 then broiled for a few minutes until cheese browned. (Used 2 (24.5 oz) jars Classico Mushroom & Olive tomato sauce..perfect b/c it had some mushroom in it!)

Absolutely delicious!

stinkin awesome.  made beef mixture with 2 lbs g beef and can of drained spinach. soaked noodles like mommyfromseattle reviewer in 2007 said for 20-30 min in hot leftover spaghetti water.  combined and MASHED WITH FORK 24 oz cottage cheese and mozzarella and added tsp of nutmeg and 2 eggs.  layered 3 times, left in fridge a day then baked 45 min in convection oven.  used kroger traditional spaghetti sauce - little sweeter type - kids ages 6, 5 and 3 ate it too :)  my mom always uses cottage cheese in hers - this is a million times better and DOES NOT TASTE LIKE COTTAGE CHEESE like hers always does.  i think mixing the mozzarrella in and smashing up a little with a fork first helps this though :)  thanks bob!

Overall this is a great, yet simple enough recipe.  It turned out fantastic for me, but I added a few things and didn't cook the lasagna noodles. I just let them soak in a pan of hot water while I preped everything.  
1. I added about 1/2 tsp dried oregano, 1 tsp italian seasoning,3 cloves of miced garlice to the meat and sauteed the garlic and the onion in butter before adding to the meat mixture.
2. Then I added one egg and a pinch of nutmeg to the cottage cheese, which I cut in half and used half ricotta.
3. I put a layer of spaghetti sauce under the first layer of noodles instead of greasing the pan.  
4. Cooked covered with foild for 55 minutes and uncovered for 10 more min.

I suppose the name speaks for itself: this really was awesome. Simple to prepare and full of flavor, it was such a great weekday meal. I used ground turkey instead of beef to lighten it up a bit (no need to double it, unless you REALLY love meat) and used Lowry's seasoning and garlic powder to season, and added 10 oz. frozen spinach (thawed & drained) as per other reviewers' suggestions. I used about a jar and a half of Ragu Garden Vegetable sauce and might even use a bit extra, next time. Subbed ricotta for the cottage cheese and added dried parsley and one beaten egg. Also used the suggestion to soak the hard noodles in hot water while I cooked everything else. It came together beautifully, cooked perfectly in an hour and made my apartment smell homey and delicious. This is definitely my go-to lasagna recipe when I just don't feel like slaving away.

This was awesome and extremely easy to make. I soaked the noodles while I browned the meat. I added 1/2 cup parmesan cheese to the cheese mixture. I used a 45 oz jar of chunky spaghetti sauce since that is was I had. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was actually my first time making lasagna.  Super easy and very delicious! I subbed ground turkey for the beef to make it a bit healthier, and also added some zucchini.

This was the first I've ever attempted to make lasagna and it turned out GREAT!!!  I made the sauce pretty much the same way I make my spaghetti sauce (more spices and tomato paste added), but I discovered that I needed more cottage cheese.  After my husband got back from the store w/it, I finished the last layer and popped it in the oven.  Needless to say, my husband had eaten 2 helpings of it before I finished my first one.  He asked me if I was sure I wasn't part Italian.  This was a HUGE success!!!

this came out great! I made these changes: I added Pumpkin Spice to the cottage cheese, I also used Cheddar Cheese shredded w/ Mozzerela and I didn't boil the noodles I soaked them for 30 mins in hot tap water. Also I used finely chopped onions and garlic instead of garlic salt. I licked the plate it was great!

This was excellent, but I did make some adjustments. I substituted whole wheat lasagna noodles and 1.2 pounds ground turkey, to make it a bit healthier. I used 2 jars of spaghetti sauce (and that was just enough), and I added 1 egg and about 8 ounces of ricotta cheese to the cottage cheese. I also added one can of drained spinach to the meat mixture.

The end product was cheesy, filling, and delicious!

I am now famous for Lasagna thanks to this recipe! I do play with it and change up things but I think the Cottage Cheese is what makes this dish(I use small curd and lots of it)! I like to add real garlic instead of the Garlic salt, Pimento's(they are awesome in this dish)and I use Cobly jack cheese in addition to the Mozzarella. I also like to add  our homeade canned Tomatos from our garden and they make this dish even more special!

A nice basic lasagna recipe.  I did change a few things.  I doubled the recipe.  I added a container of ricotta cheese and some parmesan to the cheese mixture along with two eggs as a binder.  I used my two new lasagna pans (They have three long wells the shape of a lasagna noodle to make three long individual lasagnas - I LOVE THEM!) and it made two full pans three thick layers deep.  I also tripled the sauce (so three times the sauce but a double batch of everything else) it called for and added a few small bay leaves as it simmered.  Bay just does something special for italian food (and chicken too).  I was able to freeze several of the mini lasagnas for later so this was an awesome way to make six lasagnas and have some left over for the freezer!

This was excellent.  I added more italian seasoning and garlic than called for.  I also split mine in half--half with meat sauce, and half without meat but with chopped broccoli and carrots.  I added a frozen/defrosted package of spinach and 1 egg to the cottage cheese and placed throughout it all.  The meat eaters loved the meatless part equally well.  Thanks!

I love this lasagna! I don't know why I haven't rated it before. I like to use turkey sausage because I have it on hand more often than ground beef, and I toss in a little italian seasoning, basil, oregano and red pepper flakes while I'm simmering the sauce. I also add a little parmesan to the layers. I like to assemble this a day ahead (without cooking the noodles) and then baked for an hour when I'm ready. I never precook lasagna noodles, and they always come out great. I also like to added some finely chopped frozen spinach. Aside from being green, you can hide that in just about anything! This is a good simple lasagna, just like the one I grew up with. Delicious!

I added some frozen chopped spinach to the meat and sauce mixture and used only about 3/4 of the cheese.  It was really awesome!

Bob's lasagna is truly awesome.  I love that the recipe is basic, but full of flavor, which is just what the doctor ordered when cooking for picky kids!  My 13 yo gobbled this up like he was starving, so this will be on the menu again!  I followed the recipe with no changes.

I was looking for an easy lasagne recipe using cottage cheese and this one looked good. I made it just like the recipe and it turned out so well that my children who start dinner with "how many bites do we have to eat?" not only ate everything on their plate, but asked for it again tomorrow night. Talk about a miracle. Thank you for the great recipe!

My new favorite recipe - made several changes based on preferences/reviewer suggestions. Added spinach and mushrooms to sauce mix, added a little more sauce & meat, used egg in cottage cheese mix. This was an easy recipe - I'll definitely be making again!!

Love this recipe!  I use my own home made tomato sauce and instead of a layer of cottage cheese and a layer of cheese, I mix the cottage cheese with the cheese and add an egg to make it hold together a bit better and LOTS of spinach to add some veggies and up the taste a bit.  On top I sprinkle extra mozza cheese mixed with a bit of parmesan.  A big hit for my whole family!

This was yummy and uncomplicated.  I used fresh herbs, more chopped garlic and onions, and some grated parmesan.  Also, I added one egg to the cottage cheese.  Since the spaghetti sauce is one of the most plentiful ingredients, I think that the type of sauce will really influence the taste.  Since it was light, I used "Classico" Tomato and Basil (and added a ton of herbs, salt, etc...).  Depending on the style of lasagna you're into, a heavier bolognese sauce could do the trick.  I have never used no-boil noodles before, but the Trader Joe's noodles I used were delicious.  I wet them a bit and made sure they were coated with sauce before covering with tinfoil.  Delicious!!

A-... used ricotta cheese, two tubs of it, and two large packs of already shredded mozza cheese. Delish. Covered bottom of pan with meat mixture, then one layer of the pasta, then the ricotta and lots of mozza cheese and then repeat one more time- if you add lots of ricotta cheese and mozz, then you only need to repeat twice and hence only need 8 slices of the lasagna pasta (don't boil too much b/c it's such a waste to throw away). Also used 100% whole wheat pasta and no difference taste than the usual white one but a lot more nutricious. Also use extra lean ground beef and only light cheese but tasted awesome. Thanks for the recipe! It only took one hour prep and one hour to cook- although could cook in 50 mins easily. Put in oven for 25 mins with foil and then another 25 mins without foil and then 1-2 mins on broil to brown cheese. Thanks!

This is a great and easy recipe.  I followed some of the other reviewer's advice and added an egg to the cottage cheese mixture.  I also try and buy the no-boil lasagna.  It works the best.  I think the type of spaghetti sauce you pick can make a difference.  I always use Ragu Tomato, Garlic and Onion with a small can of tomato sauce added to it.  I love the taste of it in this recipe!  I have even made this with whole wheat lasagna and it was still really good!  I do cover it with foil now for the first half of it cooking since i was having trouble with the cheese burning.  Thanks for the recipe!

I guess this is okay if you like lunchroom lasagna, or if you have kids who don't like any sort of authentic Italian seasoning at all. Otherwise, this is bland bland bland. The large curd cottage cheese is lumpy; you really need to use ricotta instead or at least a half and half mixture of ricotta and small curd cottage cheese. And I'd substitute ground Italian sausage or even pepperoni (just layered in instead -- not precooked) instead of the ground beef. There are much better lasagna recipes out there that are just as easy as this one.

This lasagna was great and so easy to make! We're amateur/beginner cooks and this really was the perfect recipe. Although it lacked any vegetables, it still felt light(-ish) because no oil/butter was used and the entire meal went great with deep red wine from Madeira. Thanks Bob for such a great meal!

It was my first lasagna I read the reviews and used 2 eggs for the cheese mix, and more sauce. I think It needed more cheese.  with 8oz noodles, i was able to go up to 5 levels, so not enough cheese, nor meat. but turned out well,  i also added spinach

Superb, Bob! This went into my "Quick 'n Easy" file... but where are the spices and herbs?  I used half cottage cheese & half ricotta, and added more onions, chopped green pepper, more garlic, some basil, oregano, cayenne... and THEN started tasting.

Very good, while I was making this with the help of my 5 year old, she was saying how she didn't want any because she didn't like it, but after it was done, I had her try one bite, and after her normal, I don't want any I'm not hungry routine she asked for a plate of it after she realized how good it was. I didn't make any changes to the ingredients, but I didn't cook my noodles, just soaked in hot water while everything else was cooking, so as to not dirty another dish, I used my 13x9 pan to soak them in.

This is a very good recipe. I only made two changes. I added some canned mushrooms. Also, I mixed the mozzarella and cottage cheeses with one whole egg and tossed in some parmesean for good measure.

This was my first lasagna and it was a hit! I added a can of crushed tomatoes to the meat mixture, with some fresh italian spices.. also 1/2 cottage cheese and 1/2 ricotta mixed with some spinach for the cheese mixture. It was a lot easier than I expected it to be and the leftovers were good the next day too!

Whole family liked this.  Did make some changes as others suggested.  Increased meat to 1-1/2 lbs and added large clove of garlic, Italian seasoning, basil, and oregano.  I used a jar and a half of spaghetti sauce. Mixed the cheeses and added two eggs, dried parsley, oregano. I did not pre-cook the noodles, just put them in and it turned out great.

So good!  Like many others I used 2-26 ounce jars of sauce and the no boil noodles.  I cooked it covered for 50 minutes and then uncovered it for the last 10 minutes so it could get brown and bubbly on top.  It was a fantastic recipe with very little fuss involved!

Absolutely delicious!  Was gobbled up!  I didn't think that it could be improved, but took the recommendations of those who tasted it and I used half ricotta, half cottage cheese to make it more "traditional" and added some fennel seed to the cooked ground beef.  It was SUCH a hit with the snobbiest lasagna fans!!!

This is a sensational lasagna recipe. I added a 3.5 oz package of pepperoni for a little extra kick. I put the pepperoni on top of the meat sauce. The other thing I did was measure out 1/3 of all the ingredients so that no layer was too thick or too thin. This lasagna is better than any lasagna you'll find in a restaurant.

Great. Just like mom used to make only she made it from scratch. And so do I. I use tomato sauce and paste and fresh tomatoes...I also make enough for another lasagna. So I make 2 and throw one in the freezer and one in the oven. It's great. Cheap and the family loves it, plus you have a extra for when you don't feel like cooking a big supper but want something homemade just put the oven on a lower setting like 200 degrees.

This tasted alright but not exactly like my usual lasagna I make totally from scratch.  I used ricotta cheese instead of the cottage cheese since that's what I had. I also used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  I really do prefer scratch lasagna though so next time rather than cheating I guess I'll go to the store to get what I need.  The short cuts this recipe takes and ingredients it is lacking (eggs, parm. cheese to name a couple) really was missed at our table.

I have made this lasagna for years.  I am always told that this is the best that there is.  Very easy to put together.  You will get raves. (I haven't ever put the garlic salt).

I really enjoyed this lasagna. One recommendation I have is for the cook to really follow the recipe. I overindulged on cheese and it came out looking like lasagna soup. However, the next day it solidified, and it was delicious. Enjoy it as left overs and you won't be disappointed! -ShoeGal

Best lasagna I have ever had! I made a few changes after reading some of the reviews. I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and mixed it with 2 eggs, a splash of milk and 1 tsp of garlic salt. I also added minced garlic to the meat while I was browning it. Turned out GREAT!

I absolutely love this recipe. Very quick and easy to prepare. I made a few changes: added one box of frozen, chopped spinach to the cheese mixture. I added one egg to the cheese mixture to bind it together. I also added a few dashes of grated nutmeg to the cheese mixture. I added 1/4 cup parmesan cheese to the cheese mixture, I added 1 can diced garlic basil tomatoes to the spachetti sauce (45 oz. jar). I added 1 Tbsp. Italian seasoning. I used 1.5 pounds of ground beef.  I used 10 0z. ricotta cheese and 10 oz. cottage cheese. I used 2 teaspoons minced garlic instead of garlic salt.

First time making lasagna and this was pretty good! I made some changes based on other reviews. The first change was my own, using a 10x15 pan to make more. This gave me enough to feed a family of 4 twice and freeze enough for another meal. I doubled everything... the meat (2 pounds), the sauce (64 ounces), the cheese (32oz of Ricotta) and the spices. I mixed in 2 eggs with the ricotta along with oregano and parmesean cheese. I cooked the 15 lasagna noodles, but will try the soaking method next time. I added a can of diced tomatoes and minced green pepper to the sauce. I also put a little sauce on the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking.   All in all, this was pretty good but using a bigger dish I didn't have quite enough sauce, ricotta or mozzarella. I cooked it for the suggested 1 hour but left it covered the entire time to prevent drying out.  Next time I'll up the meat to 3 pounds, use slightly more ricotta, another can of diced tomatoes and use more mozarella (24 oz.) Also, I'll probably add some spinach to the Ricotta. Maybe add some mushrooms to the sauce. But remember, my changes are for a 10x15 dish and not the 9x13.  At the end of the day, this was an excellent starter recipe that needed a little tweaking. Thanks alot Bob and all of the reviews.

This lasagna is super easy and fast to make. In the last 2 months I've made it atleast 3 times and my husband and son love it. Not only that but even reheated for lunch its really good. Definitely delicious and easy on the pockets! The only thing I changed was the cottage cheese which I subsituted with the traditional ricotta... YUM! I've already shared this recipe with my sister and a friend!

Added the spinach like another reviewer stated as well as an egg to the cottage cheese mixture. Mixed the cheese up a bit with mozzarella and mexican cheese. Added an additional diced up roma tomato and chopped basil leaves as well. I found that the cottage cheese mixture was too little, only enough for 2 1/3 layers...tasted like ordinary lasagna to me.

I made this to bring over to a friend's house today and it was a big hit. They jokingly asked me where I bought it! I did make some modifications to the recipe as others suggested. I used 1.5 lbs of meat, a 45 oz. jar of Prego Traditional sauce, I added 1 egg and 1/4 cup parmesan cheese to the cottage cheese mixture, added about 1T tablespoon of Italian Seasonings and 2t. of minced garlic to the sauce, and topped the lasagna with remaining mozzarella cheese. I had some extra sauce but that's ok! This makes a big, hearty lasagna.

Great recipe- i only give it 4 stars only because you really need an egg in with the cottage cheese & there could have been more meat sauce. Other than that is was pretty darn good and really easy to make. I even hid some spinach in the meat sauce. Excellent basic recipe many things can be added to make this more interesting :-) Thank you Bob!

Very very good lasagna. I, like many others, tweaked it a bit -- I used twice the sauce, twice the cottage cheese, and along with one pound of hamburger I used one pound of Italian sausage. I also chopped some veggies up (spinach and peppers) to throw in it. My friends loved it!

OMG! This is just like the lasagna my mom used to make!!!!! It was my FAVORITE! MY son said he wished he had more thumbs to give it more than 2 thumbs up! I followed some suggestions such as 15 oz of ricotta, some cottage cheese, 2 eggs and little parsley. I used 2 lbs of ground beef and 2 jars of marinara. put sauce 1st on the bottom of the dish. I refrigerated all morning (5 hrs) and then baked for 45 min covered with foil. baked then for 20 in uncovered with parmesan sprinkled on top. ABSOULUTELY WONDERFUL! Thanks Bob! for this AWESOME LASAGNA!

This is a really great lasagna recipe - easy to make, goes together pretty fast.  The only change I made was to use ricotta instead of cottage cheese and I also added a little garlic powder and parsley to the meat when cooking.  I did cover the dish with foil the first 45 minutes of cooking then I took off the foil and cooked it for 15 minutes longer, broiling the last 3 or 4 minutes.  Delicious!

This was a really good lasagna. I made a few adjustments - soaked the noodles instead of cooking them, used less ground beef and added cooked cracked wheat, added an egg to the cottage cheese and mixed it with the mozzarella, covered with foil for the first 45 minutes of cooking. Very delicious!

Excellent Recipe, I did make a few changes though.  I used uncooked noodles and added 1/2 c of water to the sauce.  Also, I added 2 eggs & 1/2 c parm cheese to the cottage cheese.

I have been making this recipe for years.  It is a recipe that you really don't have to measure anything...just assemble...plus I happen to love jarred pasta sauce.  The secret to cutting and serving a lasagne square that doesn't fall apart, is to let it set up for about 20-30 minutes after removing it from the oven.  I use an extra jar of sauce for "gravy" to pour over the top.

Very very very good!  My mother always put cottage cheese in her lasagna and I prefer it this way.  I think it makes the whole dish a lot lighter and it's not as rich and sickly as with so much ricotta; although I do sometimes add a bit of ricotta as well.  I also make homemade sauce: a couple of cans of chopped tomatoes, 1/2 softened onion, couple of cloves of garlic, oregano, fresh basil, a dash of red wine vinegar, sugar, and seasoning.  Thanks a bunch Bob!!

STOP using cottage cheese! ricotta is better not only because it is traditional but also because it has a MUCH lower moisture content and you don't have to do silly stuff like mixing in eggs. Eggs don't belong in a lasagna. This is a simple recipe and there is no need to make it difficult. If you want to make it difficult try one of the gourmet recipe's. Virtually every decent sized grocery store in America sells ricotta these days so don't be afraid to use it.

This is a great recipe. I did make some alteration's and it was the best lasagna we have ever had ! I tend to eyeball everything instead of measuring. 1. mixed half ricotta and half cottage cheese with a pinch of nutmeg,some parsley, 2 eggs (made it nice and firm) and one package 10.oz fr.chopped spinach(defrosted) Make sure to squeeze out excess water. 2. Browned 1.5lbs of sweet italian sausage (instead of beef) and layered as usual. These are not my own alterations these are multiple reviews put together. I also soaked the noodles in hot water and they turned out
perfect.

I made a few tweaks.  I used 1.5 jars of sauce.  I mixed 1 jar Rinaldi's Sweet & Chunky Tomato with 1/2 jar of Rinaldi Three Cheese. I browned my hamburger with some Italian seasoning and then mixed it with the sauces and added 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.  I also used 15 ounces ricotta along with probably 8 ounces cottage cheese. I added an egg to that mixture.  I think maybe some of the reviews that thought it was too "bland" might need to consider what kind of jar sauce they used. If you are going to use a "bare bones" type of sauce and not add your own spices or veggies, you'll probably get a blander flavor. If you buy a jar sauce that's already a little doctored, that will probably help.

AWESOME!!  Based on other's reviews, I made a few changes.  I made my own sauce,  by combining 28oz sausage flavored pasta sauce with 8 oz tomato sauce, 2T brown sugar, 1 onion, 3 cloves garlic, 1lb ground steak, 1lb sweet sausage, 1/2lb portabello mushrooms, frozen spinach, bell pepper, oregano, basil and fennel.  The sauce took almost a day to cook down to I made it the day before.  It made enough for 2.5 (9x13) pans of lasagna.  I soaked  the noodles for an hour in hot water instead of boiling them.  Again after reading others reviews, I used the following for the cheese mix: 8oz cottage cheese, 8oz whole milk ricotta, 2 eggs, a dash of nutmeg, 1/2lb mozarella, 1/2lb provolone.  The setup did not fill the pan but smoothed out during baking.  After baking 45 min and removing the foil, I topped with romano cheese - a stronger flavor then parmesan.  When topping with romano, I was shocked to see so much liquid in the pan, but after  baking without foil and allowing the lasagna to rest, the liquid was gone.    All who ate this raved and asked for the recipe.  Definitely a keeper - Thanks Bob.

This is a wonderful lasagna!  I followed some of the other tips, including adding Italian seasonings to the meat, nutmeg and egg to the cheese mixture, and doubling the sauce.  Also, thanks whomever offered the tip to soak noodles instead of boiling.... What a difference!

This was great- who knew lasagna could be so easy? Changes I made- one pound ground beef and one pound sausage, two bottles of Sauce, 1/2 and 1/2 mixture of ricotta and cottage cheese, more garlic, larger pan. I was worried about the cottage cheese because I dont like the texture but I could not taste it at all. Covered with foil for the first 30 min. Set up great for me. thanks!

Excellent recipe...first time I have ever made Lasagna.  Recap some of the tips I used from other folks and a few of my own

1) 1lb ground beef and 1lb italian sausage were great.
2) You absolutely need 52 or more ounces of sauce.
3) If you use a throw away baking tin, make sure it is exactly to size or scale things up.
4) I did not let it sit overnight in the fridge, but it was very flavorful just made...I am sure it would be even better with an overnight mellowing in the fridge.
5) I used two eggs in the ricotta cheese...not sure if it helped, but it did not hurt it any.  I think you need 32 ounces of ricotta/cottage cheese as well.

I have a recipe book for 2 but I couldn't find it, so I tried this one out. I toned down the recipe (well, I used the same recipe amounts due to the reviews that said they needed more cheese and sauce) and put it in an 8x8 glass dish (for only the 3 of us and I'm the only big lasagna fan) I added some garlic powder, italian seasoning to the beef and onions, and some parsley and oregano flakes, along with adding the shredded mozzarella and an egg into the cottage cheese mixture, and then mixed it well (with hand mixer) topped the top with slices of mozzarella and covered with foil until the last 20 minutes of cooking. It was fantastic! Served with italian bread covered with a butter/garlic/italian seasoning mixture and sprinkled parmesan cheese and broiled til brown.

This lasagna is so good!  I took the advice of other reviewers and didn't boil the lasagna noodles.  I just laid them in the baking dish and layered them as instructed.  To my surprise, they were perfectly cooked.  Other than that, I followed the reciper verbatim and was extremely happy with the results.  I used two different sauces.  One was a Prego Roasted Garlic and Parmesean sauce, the other was Bertolli's Green Olive with Sundried Tomato Sauce.  The amount of lasagna this recipe makes is HUGE, be prepared to serve to a large gathering, or to be eating it for several days.  The upside is that it's so good, you won't mind having it again, and again, and again!

It was sooo good.  I had never made lasagna, so I was nervous, but it came out good.  When I make it again I'll add more meat and sauce though.  More cheese too.  I sprinkled the top with herbs.  I thought it would make it look nicer.  Thanks for the receipe.  I won't even bother to look for another.

No one in my family was fond of this.  It was OK but didn't have much flavor, tasted more like a pasta dish than lasagna.  I was disappointed in the presentation because it fell apart when served.  After sitting overnight in the fridge, it still fell apart.  I suppose I should have taken notice that most folks who rated this so highly made alterations to it.

This was a great recipe. I substituted 1/2 of the ground beef with italian sausage and it made it even tastier. I was hesitant about the cottage cheese but that made the dish!

You know what?   This is a darn good, basic lasagna recipe with no fuss.   Quite frankly, it's perfect because of the simple ingredients and easy preparation.  You can pretty much count on always having these ingredients on hand.  It's going to be a definite Go-To quick lasagna recipe for my family.    We all loved it just as it is written!

A great recipe! To healthify it slightly, I used 2% mozzarella cheese, whole wheat lasagna noodles and Egg Beaters instead of the egg suggested by others. I used Wolfgang Puck 4 Cheese pasta sauce. Hubby LOVED the lasagna and told me to please give it 5 stars.  I have to agree- delicious!

This was a good basic recipe.  I think it needed more Italian spice in it though.  It also didn't need to be cooked for a whole hour.  It was probably ready to come out after 45 minutes.  But, still pretty good.

My son (22 months) ate the whole plate, i used ricotta   instead of cottage and it had a kind of sour taste to it but it was delicious.

Good recipe, but I modified it just a hair like others had done.....added 1 egg to cottage cheese mixture, and used 56 oz. of spag sauce.  When I make this next time I will most definately use a very large container of ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  There wasn't nearly enough cottage cheese in the recipe, plus I think it would taste better with ricotta.  I soaked my uncooked noodles in hot water for 40 minutes and they turned out great.  Definately add more spices at your leisure, like garlic powder, italian seasoning, and a dash of nutmeg.

Delicious!!  I halved the recipe and made in an 8x8 pan.  I did still use 12 oz (fat-free) cottage cheese (rather than 8 oz) and added 1 egg to make it bind.  I also seasoned the meat and sauce with more garlic powder, onion powder and oregano.  This was easy, fast and TASTY!!  I will make this again!

I'm stunned how easy and delicious this is!  For years I've made a very complicated lasagna recipe which never wowed my family like I thought it should considering all the time and effort. Today in the grocery store I pulled up this website on my iphone, picked Bob's recipe, and was out the door in 10 minutes. All along I thought it would taste like Stouffer's. What a surprise!  My family gobbled it up, begged for more, and gave it a 9 out of 10 stars. This will definitely be my new go-to lasagna recipes.  Bravo, Bob! You just made my life a whole lot easier.

This was an excellent recipe but I felt that it was still missing something. Maybe a can of diced tomatoes. I used fat-free cottage cheese and blended it to take out the chunks. You could not taste the difference of using the fat-free compared to whole cottage cheese because of the rest of the flavors. I think it was much better this way than using Ricotta. I used extra-lean ground beef and rinsed off the extra grease after browning.  I also added a pinch of nutmeg to the cottage cheese mix. I used the largest can of Prego traditional spaghetti sauce that I could find which was enough for a 9X13 pan. also followed other reviewers and soaked my no bake noodles in warm water for 30 minutes to get them to soften. I made mine about 8 hours before actually baking. It was liked by everyone. My 16 month-old had to pieces all to him self:)

I could not believe how easy yet how GOOD this recipe was. Here are the tweaks I made:  Added more meat- used 1lb of ground turkey and 1/2lb or hot italian sausage ground up, used 1/2 ricotta and 1/2 cottage cheese (this was the key I think - it needed some ricotta but did not want to overwhelm it with it - actually it calls for 16 oz total, i use about 10oz ricotta and 10oz cottage cheese, added mushrooms - that is the beauty of this recipe - you want something...ADD IT :)

Thank you so much. This was super easy I added Ricotta as suggested. Ended up making 2 and freezing one for another time. Thank you so much for adding this recipe.

Great recipe!  Doubled the meat with 1lb ground beef and 1lb of ground hot sausage.  Also doubled the cheese mixture using a few dashes of nutmeg as other reviewers suggested.  Added Italian seasoning to the meat mixture.

I have been using this recipe for over five years now and I have not been disappointed.  It works best if you make it the night before and let it sit in the fridge.  The cottage cheese is really the key to this recipe.  Thanks Bob for sharing your awesome lasagna!

This was so good. I added a few touches, we like ours a little cheesier than this recipe calls for. I added a 16 oz. container of ricotta cheese and 1/2 a bag of KRAFT 5 cheese blend to the cottage cheese. Then topped with the other 1/2 of the shredded cheese. This makes quite a bit, so my husband brought the leftovers to work the next day. UM, the platter was literally licked clean. Thumbs up!!!

This turned out to be a very simple, but delicious recipe. I too also used some of the tips other have left here and it turned out fantastic! Instead of boiling my noodles, I let them sit in hot water for about 30 minutes. I doubled the meat as others had suggested as well. I also used 1/2 ricotta cheese, 1/2 cottage cheese mixed with 2 eggs for my cheese filling. This turned out awesome, and I definitely plan on making it again!

Not the best lasagna I've ever had, but a very good basic recipe. Very easy and quick preparation. The only change I made was to use half mozzarella and half provolone cheese. I definitely make this again!

This was very yummy! I'am vegetarian so I used Boca meatless ground burger and it worked just fine and I even added spinach to the meat/sauce mix. I followed some of the suggesstions offered here like soaking the noodles for 30 min instead of cooking them. That was perfect timing because by the time I had everything prepared the noodles were ready! And I added nutmeg to the cheese mix which made it heavenly ;)

A great classic lasagna that has been added to my rotation of meals.  I often use ground Italian sausage for extra flavor and extra mozzarella cheese.  Because really, the best part of lasagna is the cheese!

I found this lasagna really yummy and satisfying. I have very high standards and cook almost everything from scratch, so this was a fun one to play with. Like the other reviewers, I used a ricotta/cottage chz combo with an egg, and I also layered in fresh lightly sauteed portobella mushrooms and spinach on top of the ground beef. I also found that an extra can of spaghetti sauce is needed. You can never make lasagna too juicy or saucy in my opinion. You could use a little extra of everything to make the layers really full. I like to make an extra small dish to give to a family member and I like to grate fresh parmesean on it after it's served instead of baking the parm. Tonight I'm going to mix in Italian sausage w/ the beef. Great recipe!

I loved this Lasagna.  I did find it a bit salty though.  I recommend adding only 1/2-3/4 tsp of salt instead of 1 tsp.  Also I substituded garlic powder for the garlic salt.  I didn't have any spaghetti sauce so I used pizza sauce.  I also took others advise and added a beaten egg to the cottage cheese.  It was GREAT.

Luv luv luv this recipe. Every time I've made it I change it just a little. Some good things I've tried are use half ottage cheese, half ricotta cheese, and an egg. On top of mozzarella cheese, put a layer of parmesan. And try half lb ground beef, half lb Italian sausage. Yum!

Tis was awesome!  I made it for a group of 4 couples - and got rave reviews and many requests for the recipe!  I doubled it and used a comb of ground beef and hot italian sausage and made it about 5 layers deep.  I also used the no-bake noodles - could not tell a difference!  It was incredible!!!!

02/11/06 - After reading all the other reviews I made some minor changes to the recipe when I made it. I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, 1 1/2 jars of sauce and I also added chopped spinach. It came out perfectly and wasn't runny at all when plated! Will definitely make again - oh yeah, I also used fresh garlic rather than the salt version.

I made this, using full fat ricotta cheese instead of the cottage cheese.  The ricotta melts better, and doesn't leave curds, which have a funny texture.  With that change, this is the best lasagna recipe!

This was just an awesome recipe!  Used some ground pork along with the beef, Italian cheese mix, and didn't use the onion, but everything else I followed to a T.  The lasagna was so yummy that even my fussy 6 year old asked for seconds!  She never even finishes any of the store bought lasagna we've purchased before so from now on, this is our lasagna.  Thanks Bob!

We liked this recipe, although I did make a few changes.  I reduced the amount of onions (because we just don't like them that much) and added fresh minced garlic instead of the garlic salt.  It was very easy to make and it turned out delicious.  Thanks for the post.

I made this with ground lean turkey, low fat Ricotta cheese, and shredded romano to cut down on the calories.  I also scaled it down to 4 servings b/c it was just me and my boyfriend.  We both loved it!!  Easy and tasty!

The recipe was easy, but it was WAY to salty, and not enough meat or sauce. Im actually surprised so many people raved about it.

Combining a variety of recommendations, I used more beef & more sauce (a Barilla sauce formulated for baking), I added fresh garlic and about 2.5 T of various freshly dried herbs to the onions and sauteed them for 5 minutes before adding the beef, and I combined the eggs with the mozz. and ricotta cheeses and added 1/4 cup freshly chopped parsley.  I also get more compliments when I use fresh pasta-- I buy two sheets for $4 in the deli section of the grocery store.   This is a dense lasagna, so I serve it with a green salad and a small side of broccoli rabe (nice recipe on allrecipes.com).  Expect that people will want large portions, and scale accordingly.  ALthough this recipe says that it serves 12, I suggest that it serves 7-8 adults.  My boyfriend says, "I don't know how this lasagna could get any better."

This was so fast and easy.  I had never used cottage cheese in lasagna before, my family are not fans of cottage cheese.  But I did not tell them and they could not tell that I did not use ricotta.

We liked this recipe very much. I too, did not cook the lasagna noodles before layering, but I added 3/4 cup water to sauce to compensate. Turned out wonderful.

A little Oregano simmered with the sauce and a few tablespoons of Parmesan added to the top layer really enhance this already terrific and simple recipe. The cottage cheese instead of ricotta works surprisingly well.  I use part-skim Mozzarella to keep the fat levels within reason.

Delicious.  You don't have to cook the lasagna noodles though!  Just put them in the pan and layer as usual.  It turns out perfect every time.

This was my first time making a lasagna and it very much easier then I expected. I have made it twice now once for Christmas Day and again for my office New Year Party. Everyone raved about it both times. I only made two changes, I used Ricotta Cheese because that's how my mom always made hers, and I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I am so glad I tried this recipe, I will be making it again and again.

Bob, I commend you!!  My mother, her mother, and I have always used cottage cheese instead of ricotta cheese to make lasagna. It's so much creamier.  Although, mine takes quite a bit more time to prep since I do make my own sauce, I just had to let you and everyone else out there know that cottage cheese is the way to go! I've gotten alot of trash talk about using cottage cheese in my lasagna, but when the trash talkers finally taste it, not always knowing, they love it!  Thank you for sharing your version.  By the way, I can't really rate your recipe because I did not try it, but I had to rate it somehow to get my review in.  So,I rated it 3 stars because the sauce isn't homemade.  Don't take in personal! Lol

I've made lasagna this way forever. Only thing I do different is use a little garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Also my choice is add some chopped mushrooms to sauce while simmering.

This turned out great.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, which was fine.  I used a jar of spaghetti sauce - - and found the spiciest I could to add flavor (based on others reviews), and it was great!!!  The whole family loved it!!!

this was a good recipe. I will make again, but definatly add more meat and add more seasonings to spice it up a bit. It was just cheese cheese cheese. I mixed a tub of ricotta with the cottage cheese, adding an egg as a binder, also added parmesean cheese into the cheese mixture.

I don't cook much, and this was pretty easy. ALthough reading the other reviews, I agree, not enough sauce so I would double that, and I wasn't sure what to do with the top of the Lasagna...but now I do...meat and cheese...but I will make it again for sure.

I was curious about the lack of ricotta but wow! This is the best lasagne I've had- even better the next day warmed up. I added a cup of fresh, chopped spinach to the meat. It's a keeper!

I have used this recipe for years.  I found it on this site about 5 years ago.  I was looking for an easy lasagna recipe as something different for dinner and presto, there is was.  I hope you get to try it and that  you love it as much as me and my family do.

Easy to make.  Not too many ingredients compared to other recipes.  I did increase the sauce and ground beef.  I should have also increased the cheese.  I substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese.

Very tasty lasagna. Wanted it to taste as homemade as possible so instead of store bought sauce I made the "Seven Ingredient Tomato Sauce" from this site. Also added frozen spinach, egg and nutmeg to the cottage cheese. Served it with a full-bodied red wine and everyone loved it!

This was really good! It had really good flavor, however it needed a little more "oomph" with the spices for my family's taste. Also, next time i'll be adding more sauce & cottage cheese. I would love to try it with spinach as well! All in all, a very good tasting dish and am definately making it again! :)

I have used Bob's recipe at least a dozen times now.  Like another reviewer, I usually add spinach, which my family likes (in lasagna anyway) and I double the amount of sauce.  As with any recipe of this type, I tend to add extra spices to suit our tastes, such as garlic, extra organo, etc.  I have used pork sausage as a meat type along with beef, as well.  My family always looks forward to this dish.

Yum!! I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. I seasoned the turkey while cooking. I also used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. We had my mom over and she stuffed herself!

I signed up just so i could comment on this lasagna.  It was incredible! I did add 1 pound jimmy dean sausage, 1 container ricotta, and 4 eggs to hold the cheese together.  Personally i think the eggs gave it a better taste. Thank you Bob!

Yes, the recipe is kind of bland, but very easy to jazz up - add some fennel, garlic, can of tomatoes, tomatoe paste, possibly use half hamburger/half spicy sausage. Good base recipe to build upon.

Good, but you may want a little more cheese, meaning cottage or ricotta.

I thought this was a great - EASY recipe for lasagna.  I only had a 26oz jar of sauce, so I did cut back on the ground beef a bit to make sure it wasn't dry.  The only other thing I changed was to cover it while cooking.  Otherwise I think it would have dried out. This is the first time I have ever tried cottage cheese in lasagna, and it was suprisingly good.  Thank you for the recipe!

I have made this recipe at least 10 times now, and we love it more every time!  It's so simple, yet so very tasty.  My husband even likes it more than his mom's, and if that isn't a measure of success, I don't know what is!

A classic recipe that's hard to screw-up.  I use whole wheat lasagna noodle and sometimes ground turkey.  Prego or classico sauce (not the best tomato sauce) seems to make a great lasagna sauce!

I thought this Lasagna was dry, and bland. Next time I will add more sauce,and will throw in some more spices. Will probably skip the cottage cheese for ricotta.

Basic recipe, easy to make. Nothing about this would be considered awesome but the ease of making it. I thought it should have a little more sauce as it came out a tad dry.

Very fantastic, basic recipe!  I've made this several times (without the cottage cheese) and always run short on the meat sauce. In the future, I'll add mushrooms and finely diced vegetables to my sauce to make it go further.

Delish!  I added about 1 egg and 1 T. dried oregano to 24 oz. of cottage cheese.  Also used about 50 oz. of sauce as another reviewer suggested.  I didn't cook noodles, but put them under hot tap water for 20 minutes, as suggested by someone else.  I also added a variety of seasonings (basil, oregano, chopped garlic, etc.) to the meat mixture.  In a standard 9x13 pan, I used 15 noodles.  I did grease the pan too.  Cooked for 55 covered, 15 uncovered.  This was soooo easy and quick to make.  All my prep work took only 25 minutes (but I was rushing!).

Great!! I did as others suggested and added a beaten egg to the cottage cheese. I also cover it with foil for the first part of baking so as not to burn the cheese on top. Can be made healthier even with ground turkey and whole wheat pasta if you want.

This seemed like it should have been better than it was.  Not sure what i did wrong but mine turned out very dry.  Had to serve  with extra sauce on and wished that there was more of the cheese mixture inside. Will try again with these changes. UPDATE  made again with half ricotta and half cottage cheese. doubled sauce and used half ground turkey half hot italian sausage.  so much better!

Very well done.  This was my first crack at Lasagna.  As with others, I tweaked mine a bit.  Along with the ground sirloin, i browned some hot ground italian sausage to kick it up a notch.  I also included about three cloves of garlic, some oregano, and basil to the meat while it browed.  I also used some shredded provolone and ricotta.  Overall, very happy with it and is as good of a lasagna as I have had in a while.

Loved this helpful recipe!! I've been making lasagna off the cuff for years, and this makes every thing easy peasy!  I always add cream cheese chunks throughout my cheese layer, and I also used ricotta instead of cottage.  I mix in grated parm with my ricotta before layering...but the cream cheese chunks (1 8oz pkg) add a pleasant creamy surprise.  Thank you, Bob!  :)

I rated this as a four because I think it was probably a good recipe...I totally botched it.  I used too much cheese (if you can imagine that), I used more meat, as suggested by other reviewers, and I STILL couldn't taste anything but the cheese.  Plus, I used oven ready noodles...I will never do that again!  I will try this one again though, and maybe follow closer to the actual recipe instead of changing it so much.

The recipe lived up to it's name - awesome! I substituted the beef for lean ground turkey and used riccotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. Also added some Italian seasoning to the turkey while sautéing.

This is a great recipe to start out with if you haven't made lasagna before.  I used the basic recipe and then I added a little bit.  In addition to a pound of ground beef, I added half a pound of Italian Sausage.  I used 4 cloves of garlic and half the amount of salt.  I also added about a tablespoon of Italian seasonings to the meat mixture.  To the cottage cheese, I added 2 eggs and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.  I mixed all of the mozarella in with the cottage cheese mixture and just made one layer out of that.  It turned out great.  I'm looking forward to the leftovers for lunch today.  Thanks Bob! :)

Yum!  The family and even my picky boyfriend loved this.  I did make a few alterations.  I used only 1/2 tsp salt (to reduce sodium), put 1/2 tsp ground oregano and 1 1/2 tsp italian seasoning in the meat/sauce mix.  I used Prego meat sauce but added a small can of tomato sauce.  I used half ricotta and half cottage cheese and added an egg to this mix.  I soaked my noodles for 30 min as recommended and they turned out perfect!  I baked it for an hour, 45 min covered and 15 uncovered.  Next time I will try adding spinach!  Thanks to all for the great tips!

Excellent.  Since there are only two of us I made the whole recipe then split it between two 9 x 9 pans, made one last night and froze the other.  Probably the best lasagna I've ever made, and by far the cheapest as far as the ingredients themselves.  I'm glad there's a second one waiting in the freezer!

Very easy and very good.  A simple lasagna to make for the family. You can use this recipe as a base and add lots to it to make it more interesting too.  But it's good as is also.

Have made this a few times with some slight variation. I mix the cheeses together with an egg and a couple dashes of nutmeg. Also, used part ground beef and part sweet italian sausage. Tastes even better the next day. Made an extra one for the freezer - we all have those days when we'd rather not cook!! Enjoy.

This was my first attempt at lasagna and we enjoyed it. I thought that it was a little bland compared to my Mothers recipe, but can you ever really top Mom? Will try variations on this great starter recipe. Thanks Bob!

Awesome Lasagna Recipe.  I did change it a bit though I used Italian Style Turkey Sausage in place of the ground beef and since I was short on time when I made I used the no cook lasagna noodles.

The first time I made this I only had one bag of 8oz cheese- it definatly needed more because when I made it the second time, I used the full amount and it was way better. I had never used the no boil noodles- but I did and they were great- that really shaves off time!
Only changes I made were- added a can of diced tomatos, added an egg and parmesan to the cottage cheese with seasonings....awesome! Even better the next day..thanks Bob!

Oh, Bob, .....that was some GOOD lasagna!
I did a little personal tweaking, I added some roasted red peppers that I made and put about 1 tablesoon of oregano into the cottage cheese.  My husband hates and I mean hates cottage cheese.  This again was a lesson for women, what you don't tell them, they don't know!  He LOVED IT!  Even went back for seconds!  This went great with a fresh loaf of bread and a little side salad.   

D-LISH!!

I thought this could easily be improved -I made it according to the directions w/ the exception I left out the onions due to allergic reaction. I came away w/ some messy goop that was masquerading under the tempting name of "awesome lasagna"

Excellent and easy recipe.  The only thing I would really recommend is that it definitely has to have 2 jars of sauce.  It was on the dry side.  Otherwise perfect weekday meal, very easy.

This is the first item I have reviewed and I use this site a lot.  I have struggled to make a lasagna that everyone likes.  I tried this and it was a huge success.  I did make a couple of changes.  I used the no-cook noodles and half ricotta and half cottage cheese (I was afraid to use cottage cheese, next time I think I'll try all cottage cheese.) I added about 1 1/2 tsp each of dried basil, parsley and oregano to the cottage cheese/ ricotta combo before adding it to the lasagna.  And I also used half ground beef and half sausage (out of the casing).  My husband normally complains about the lasagna when I make it.  He made a point of coming up to me about 1/2 after the meal and telling me how good it was!  This is a definate keeper.

This was not good!  I was ver excited to try it because of all the high ratings.  the sauce was great, but the combination of all ingredients resulted in a runny lasagna that fell apart when you tried to plate it.  I would much rather have a lasagna made with ricotta than cottage cheese any day.  I think the cottage cheese was what made it runny.

Excellent.  Easy to make lower fat.  Used lean ground beef.  Instead of 16 oz cottage cheese,I used 8 oz 4% milkfat cottage cheese and 8 oz Low-fat ricotta.  Used 2% milk mozzarella.  Very yummy, will definitley make again.

This was good.  I used two big cans of Primo Tomato Sauce, and 9 whole wheat noodles.  Used regular creamed cottage cheese, may have been a bit runny.  Will make again, very easy.

This is a GREAT Lasagna recipe.  Simply delicious.  So easy and simple to prepare.  I increased the ground beef to 1 1/2 pounds and used the no boil noodles, and they worked great.  Upon advice from others I used 2 jars of sauce.  I sprinkly 2 T of parmesan cheese over the top before baking.  Simply scrumptious.....Thanks Bob!!!

Excellent recipe.  I used 2-26 ounce spaghetti sauce and no-boil noodles as well.  Used light cottage cheese and only .5 lb light cheddar cheese.  I used 4 cloves of garlic instead of garlic salt. Covered with foil for 40 minutes and w/o foil for 10.

This is the only lasagna recipe I make and everytime I make it everyone asks for the recipe.  I buy the Barillo no boil flat noodles. For the mozzarella, I buy two of the large bags - I think they are 3 cups to a bag??  I also add extra cottage cheese.  Instead of the garlic salt, I use two mashed garlic bulbs and I omit the table salt also.  I use Prego spaghetti sauce.  It sets up nicely and if you let it cool for a little bit, it will cut in perfect squares and not fall apart. I'm not sure if the flat no boil noodles make a difference, but I seem to think so!

Yep, definitely needs more sauce.  I had no sauce leftover for the very top layer, so I just left the top layer sauceless (i.e. the very top layer was the lasagna noodles)... BIG MISTAKE!  It made the top noodles hard and crunchy, or as my husband referred to it... "armored lasagna".  Otherwise, it was very good.  (and in case you run out of sauce, too, the top layer softens up after a night in the fridge)

This was wonderfully easy, and the meat sauce (which I made up of beef and pork sausage, a ton of garlic and stewed tomoatoes along with the listed ingredients)was WONDERFUL as I was layering it into the dish. Thanks Bob.

This was very good and very easy.  I made this sort of low fat and tweaked it a bit to add extra flavor.  I used mild turkey sausage instead of ground meat and add 1/2 c. pesto to cottage cheese and I used the no-boil noodles.  I think next time I'll use ricotta as there was a tangy flavor to the lasagna that I'd rather not have.  Still a good, fast recipe though.

My favorite lasagna recipe!  Not too many ingredients, but they combine for outstanding flavor. Great for those of us just learning to cook.  I use a little more spaghetti sauce than called for (Prego is my favorite), and put the last layer of cheese on during the last 5-10 min of baking.   Lasagna is my husband's favorite, and he always raves about this when I make it!

This was my first time making lasagna and everyone loved it.  I had some guests stop by unexpectedly and they asked me for the recipe.  I added onions and onion powder to the meat while cooking and I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I think next time I will try it with the ricotta and cottage cheese together.

This recipe is a hit with my family and friends!  It's flawless!  You can't go wrong making this lasagna.  I found you can use any variety of sauces, too.  I would also recommend putting more mozarella cheese and cottage cheese than what the recipe asks for.

My goodness!!

I made lasagne for the first time using this recipe last night and it turned out great!  I doubled the recipe and added 3 tablespoons of brown sugar and 1 cup parmesian cheese and ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese!

Oh...wow!  I was looking for an Italian place to eat out and now I am probably not going to!

Fills up my Italian craving...mmm...mmm!

I am not a good cook, so if I could make this any one can!  This is easy to make and ohhhhh so good. Second time I made it I added sweet Italian sausage, so it was very meaty.  The hot water noodle trick another reviewer suggested was brilliant. This freezes well which is important to me as I am single, so cutting it up into dinner size portions and freezing is a must.

Made this lasagna, it was the bomb. I added the nutmeg, 1 egg and spinach to the cottage cheese, it was so good! I had some other various cheeses already in the fridge, so I mixed some of that into my mozza, I will definately make this again.

This is an excellent basic lasagna. I tried it because my mother always used cottage cheese when making lasagna. This was a good rendition of what I fondly remember from my childhood. I wouldn't change anything in the recipe.

I made it for my son and daughter-in -law's candle light anniversary dinner. It was a hit. I did use extra italian sausage and 2 cans of the less expensive spaghetti sauce plus sliced provalone on each layer, yummmm. It will probably be my 'go to' recipe.

Absolutely delicious! Used the following suggestions from prior reviews: Added 1 lb. sweet italian sausage (cooked on stove, then crumbled into sauce). Increased burger by about 1/4 pound. Used two 24 oz. jars of Ragu (any flavor). Added 10 oz. frozen spinach. Used fresh garlic, not garlic salt. For the cheese mixture, used 24 oz. ricotta instead of cottage cheese and blended one egg and about 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese together. This was the best lasagna ever! Thick, hearty, and flavorful!

Made so many changes it's hard to give an accurate rating.  Subbed the beef for turkey and used a little less than a full pound.  Also used a little less sauce as the jar was not 32 oz.  Halved the salt and garlic salt.  Added Italian spices, garlic and chopped frozen spinach to the sauce as well.  Mixed the mozzarella in with the cottage cheese mixture and added an egg as well as more Italian spices and a pinch of nutmeg as suggested by another reviewer.  My only reason for giving it a four star was because I didn't stay true to the original recipe though with my changes I would give it a 5.

I had never used cottage cheese before, I always used ricotta. It was creamy and had a milder taste. The kids loved it.

This is my favorite lasagna recipe. I use homemade spaghetti sauce instead of jarred for better nutrition.  Yum.

Simple and delish. I added a layer of sun-dried tomato pesto between layers, and  a dash of chili powder and cayenne pepper to the ground beef as I was cooking it for an extra kick. My boyfriend and his friends all loved it!

I found this recipe about four or five years ago. My kids love it and their eyes light up every time I say I'm thinking of making it.  For those as lazy as me, I use fresh sheets of pasta uncooked and they cook in the over. Just make sure no edges are exposed when baking. It really cuts down on the time and mess of handling the cooked lasagna noodles.

Wonderful! I added mushrooms and fresh spinach (more veggies for my family is always good esp. if they don't quite realize they are eating them). I had never made lasagna b/f but this was great and super easy!!!

I made some changes.
Doubled the meat. Used 1 lb ground beef and one lb ground Chicken to make it a little healthier.
Used 1 entire container of Lowfat Ricotta & 1 entire container of Lowfat Cottage cheese (mixed in 2 eggs). I used part skim mozzzerella, and substituted the regular noodles for whole grain or semolina noodles.

My husband is SO picky and he still loved this. He said it's better than his mothers (and his brother agreed) and it's in the top 3 things I've ever made for him.


Thanks!

This lasagna was super easy and quick to make.  I used oven ready noodles, added frozen spinach to the meat while cooking, added fresh chopped mushrooms, and of course some extra cheese.  Effortless AND kids and hubby loved it!  Can't beat that!

Back to making this for about the 4th time.  This is probably the easiest recipe for lasagna. Sure there may be a 'better' recipe somewhere but in this busy world this recipe rocks. Quick, very, very good taste and texture. My only suggestion is to   throw the cottage cheese in a colander for a few minutes to drain any liquid. Just a note, NO ONE that I have served this too has missed the ricotta.

My boyfriend was never a fan of lasagna and he absolutely loved this one. Now I make it at least twice a month on his request. I did make a few changes though. I doubled the beef and used about a jar and a half of spaghetti sauce. I also added sliced mushrooms to the sauce mixture (sauted first on their own). Lastly I exchanged the cottage cheese for provolone. Turned out fantastic!!! Def a keeper!!!

I enjoyed this recipe.  Using the method of soaking the noodles in warm water prior to cooking (suggested by other reviewers) saved me from watching a boiling pot of water.  The noodles turned out tender.

Awesome recipe! I read the other reviews and soaked the pasta for 20-30 minutes, and it came out perfect. I alse used ricotta cheese instead of cottage, and I mixed the ricotta and the mozzarella together with two eggs before putting it on the lasagna. I also made this recipe low-fat by using 99% fat-free ground turkey, light pasta sauce (which is fat-free), part-skim ricotta and part-skim mozzarella. You would never even know! It came out fabulous! My boyfriend ate four servings!! Will definately make again.

This recipe for lasagna is most definitely FABULOUS!  

I did take a few suggestions and made a few changes: I used sweet italian sausage instead of ground beef (just for more great flavor) and used Ricotta instead of cottage cheese (I did add a pinch of nutmeg to the ricotta)
My family LOVED this recipe so much and I will most definitely make this again!!
Thanks Bob. You rock :)

I liked it pretty well and family members seemed to like it as well.  I use either all ricotta cheese or 1/2 and 1/2 ricotta and cottage.

Great basic recipe. It was a big hit with my entire family. I only gave it four stars because more veggies would make it more of a healthy option. But no problem, I just added my own zucchini, yellow squash and mushroom to up the nutrient quotient and it turned out great. Thanks!

This recipe is amazing!!!! I added italian seasoning to the ricotta cheese but didn't use an egg. I used the prego garlic and roasted herb jar sauce, but added minced garlic, salt, onion, and italian seasoning to it. The pre-soaking noodles in warm water for 20 minutes trick really does work!! My boyfriend and his roomate absolutely loved this!

This recipe was pretty good.  I added chopped zucchini and spinach to the sauce (probably should have reduced the meat a bit since the spinach and zucchini took up so much space) and used ricotta cheese.  I used another reviewer's trick by soaking the noodles in hot water for 20 minutes prior to layer and it turned out great!

This was really easy to make, but it was kind of bland.  I think it needed more cottage cheese than the recipe stated (a bigger container).  It was super easy and inexpensive though!  A good lasagna recipe altogether!

Excellent!  Quick and easy - I used 2 jars of Classsico, added fresh garlic and italian seasoning.  Also fresh grated parmesan on top before baking.  Everyone enjoyed it and it's now the only one I make.  Thanks for sharing!

This lasagna was the best lasagna I've ever made...and I've tried several recipes. My husband couldn't stop going back for more! I did follow the tweaks others recommended including mixing the ricotta and cottage cheese w/ the egg and nutmeg. DELICIOUS!

This is DELICIOUS!!  I used 1.5 lb of ground lean turkey and cooked it with the onion, some italian seasonings and garlic.  I couldn't tell that it wasn't beef!  Also, I used ricotta instead of cottage with one egg added.  For the noodles, I opted to use the "soak" method as suggested by others and it turned out fabulous!  Another suggestion is to put the ricotta / cottage cheese layer right after the noodle layers.  This is a traditionally good dish!

Over the years I have taken this base recipe along with other reviews and my experience to come up with my own version.  Changes I have made... I use the oven ready lasagna noodles, 1 1/2 lb of lean beef and a few dashes of Italian seasoning as it is browning, 2 jars of sauce (I use Prego's Italian sausage sauce) instead of just 1, use all of the cottage cheese it calls for but I also add in a lil bit of ricotta and mix the 2 together before I add to recipe and last, I add about half of a pack of shredded parmesan on top of the dish.  My family LOVES it!

My family and dinner guest raved about this lasagna. It quickly disappeared. I prepared half of the lasagna as described and for the other half I swapped the meat for sauteed peppers, summer squash, and mushrooms. I will definitely prepare this again!

This was a pretty good basic recipe, except my family and I found the meat seasonings to be too salty.  Next time I would probably cut those back or skip them altogether.

I opted out of the ground beef and substituted a can of black olives and a can of mushrooms that I minced.  I added a little extra sauce as per other recommendations.  My problem was that I did not have very much cottage cheese or mozzarella for each of the layers.   I backed for a 1/2 hour covered and 1/2 hour uncovered.  I thought it was very good and my fiance liked it too.  It was good and not too difficult to make but it didn't really "wow" me either.

I really impressed the hubby with this one.  I used ricotta instead of cottage cheesse and I added a package of chopped spinach (defrosted and drained).  I also added 1 tbs of italian seasoning to the sauce and about 1/4 cup of fresh grated parmesan cheese.

I love this recipe.  It's very basic and very yummy.  I have had several requests for the recipe.  I did follow another's suggestion of using 1/2 cottage cheese and 1/2 ricotta cheese.  I used prego's meat sauce and it turned out delicious!

I made this recipe for my neighbor after she got home with a new baby. Their whole family was raving about how delicious it was! So now I'm making it for my twin sister's family with their new baby! One different thing I used was 1/2 italian sausage and 1/2 regular ground beef!

For some reason, I am unable to find a good recipe for lasagna. I think it taste good, until I make it! However, this comes as close to a good lasagna as I have found yet. And my husband really loves it. Since it is just the two of us, I froze the remainder, and it actually tastes better reheated.

My husband and I both loved it. This is the first lasagna I ever made, and it turned great! I made it twice already, it came to 6 servings, and therefore 3 dinners for the 2 of us. Very delicious. I used pizza sauce instead of spaghetti sauce and also added spices, such as Italian seasonings, pepper, and Garlic Plus. Delicious, will make again for sure.

You can't go wrong with this recipe.  I used the Skinner oven ready noodles, instead of ones that I had to boil first. This saves time and tastes/cooks just the same. My family loved it!  Thanks for the post!

This is a very nice lasagna recipe. Made this for x-mas. I made a double batch. I added extra mozzarella and used 1/2 ricotta and 1/2 cottage cheese. It came out just like the picture on the recipe. Beautiful. The family was drooling when i took it out of the oven to rest.They ate till they were full and i wrapped the rest to send home with everyone. and it makes alot!! Will make this for sure again.

I enjoyed this recipe so much, I don't even try to make my other lasagna recipes anymore. I do sometimes like to add different kinds of cheese, like the italian mix that comes in packets at the grocery store. I always get compliments and people always go for seconds! I highly reccomend this recipe!!!

Thought this was great.  Pretty standard recipe. I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  Not a big fan of cottage cheese.

Good recipe. I used the no-boil lasagna, added a bit of nutmeg to the cottage cheese, a little bit of spicy tomato sauce and substituted turkey for the beef (for someone who doesn't eat red meat - next time I'll make it when he's not around b/c I think the beef will give it more flavor). I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and everyone loved it, including me! It was dense and filling. I thought it would last me 3-4 days but in was gone in less than 2!

Made this and used Spaghetti Meat sauce in a jar, and ricotta cheese, 1 egg and a dash of nutmeg instead of the cottage cheese.  Ok.  Not the best, have made and had better... but it did make a lot and the tip from the other reviewer about soaking the noodles in hot water 20-30 minutes SURE was a keeper!!  I'm doing that from now on, no more struggling with boiling hot noodles or too tough lasagna!  Thanks to that reviewer!  This recipe needs some tweaking somewhere...

This lasagna recipe is amazing!  It was very delicious, restaurant quality.  My husband loved it.  I will never look for another lasagna recipe.  This one is perfect!  I did use a 16 oz jar of spaghetti sauce instead of a 32 oz jar (Prego's Garlic & Mushroom).

Really enjoyed this lasagna.  My husband raved over it.  It was even better the second day as leftovers.  I served with an Italian bread and cabbage salad.  A great meal!

This is the best lasagna I have ever eaten.  I added some canned chopped tomatos to the spaghetti sauce and added some italian seasoning to the beef for more flavor.  I also added one egg to the cheese mixture. My family loved this.  Thanks Bob for a great recipe!

This was my first attempt at cooking Lasagna, and it was a complete success. It tasted so fantastic. Everyone had seconds! From previous advice, i did make a few changes to the recipe. I used 1/2 Cottage Cheese, 1/2 Ricotta Cheese and added an egg. This made a beautifully creamy sauce. I also added 2 Cloves of garlic and some Musrooms to the mince. This recipe has become a family favourite. It made everyone smile! x

This was definitely awesome! I made this for dinner for my husband, myself and our 16 month old daughter. A friend also happened to stop by and she also joined us. My husband said it was excellent and that I have to make it again. The friend loved it also, her mother just passed away and she said it was just like the one her mother always made. My daughter didn't leave one scrap on her plate at all. This is such a great lasagna! Hearty and good homecooked taste! I will be making this again, definitely. The only thing I did differently was that I used ground turkey instead of beef because I am trying to cut back on our food budget and turkey is cheaper. I also have to say I used a bit more cheese and also a bit more cottage cheese and it filled in the little side areas of the dish even better and was good and filling! An easy 5 stars!

This was great! Mine came out a little dry but I did not pre cook my pasta, I substituted ricotta cheese and mixed it with 2 eggs, 1/4 c parmesan, 1 1/2c shredded 5 cheese italian blend, 2 T parsley flakes, 1/4 tsp. mediterranean oregano for the cheese filling. For test purposes I used Paul Newman's Marinara sauce in a jar. I didn't measure the chopped onion, I used about 1/2 a small Texas sweet onion, I think it was maybe closer to 1/2 c. The next time I will add a little more sauce so the pasta won't soak up all of it, otherwise this was really good lasagne, just like my mom makes. I give it 4.5 stars!

While I personally prefer a veggie-type lasagna, this recipe was a huge hit at a dinner I catered! I made this, a spinach lasagna, and a tofu lasagna (big-time carnivores all the way to vegans made up the guest list!), and each one was much loved by its respective group of eaters. This will definitely be my choice if I have need of the meaty traditional-type lasagna. Thank you!!

Made this last night for dinner. The only changes I made was I made my own tomato sauce and added green peppers to the hamburger. I also followed other people's advice and added an egg to the cottage cheese.
My husband said to me afterwards "I'm usually not a lasagna person but, this lasagna was REALLY good!" The kids also gobbled it up. So, I'm definitely keeping this recipe.
I think the only thing I will change next time is to add some more cottage cheese. I don't even like cottage cheese but, it tasted delcious in this lasagna. 
Thanks Bob!

I make a "version" of this lasagna, with exactly the same ingredients (plus an egg for the cottage cheese).  I don't add any sauce to the meat, instead I add 1/2 cup of sauce to the bottom of the pan, then I add the rest of the spagetti sauce to the top of the lasagna.  I think what makes this lasagna so good is that it is very simple and the most picky eatter will even like it.  It's not by any means plain, tastes great and is so easy to make.

I liked Linda's Lasagna better because it had more to it.  Even so, this one is good and takes a little less time to prepare.

This is a simply wonderful lasagna dish. The only slight change I made to the recipe was using one cracked egg in the cottage cheese in order to help bind the dish together. Absolutly fabulous!

The flavor was amazing, but the lasagna came out too liquidy and it didn't set up right, like a slice of lasagna should.

I thought that this was a good recipe. I made my own sauce, I think it couls use a little more than the recipe calls for, but thats my taste! I used about half the amount of mozarella , and it was still great. I put foil over the top of the pan for the first 20 minutes of cooking as I had seen this in some other recipes (helped to keep the cheese from becoming burnt I think) I added fresh garlic and basil as I think it improves the flavor.

This was so yummy.  I followed the advise previous and did half ricotta cheese and half cottage cheese.  I also used fresh garlic and threw some grated regiano in with the other cheeses.  Yumm-o!

Used 1/2 ricotta and 1/2 cottage cheese. I added parsley, oregano and basil to the cheese mix and sauce. Turned out wonderful. Leftovers were even better! Thanks Bob!

Awesome is right!!  I used about a jar and a half of Prego Sweet Italian Suasage and Cheese spaghetti sauce and it was absolutely wonderful!!  This is by far the best lasagna I have ever made.  I think next time I will do as the others say and try Italian sausage also.

This was soooo good! I used half cottage cheese, half ricotta. I didn't have any onion, so I didn't use any, and I used 2 jars of Paul Newman's Vodka Sauce, and extra mozzarella. It was perfect.

Awesome is correct.  I added a little fresh basil and parmesian cheese to the sauce.  I thought I'd miss ricotta not being in this recipe but I actually prefer not to have now.  Thanx Bob.

GREAT RECIPE!! This is a tasty, less expensive version of regular lasagna. I tried it with the no-cook noodles and it turned out great. Great recipe to have in your collection!

Thanks for the GREAT recipe!  My husband is so picky about lasagna, but he ate half the pan with this one!  I too added more sauce and more cottage cheese, but it was fabulous!  Thanks again!

This was a great recipe.  I followed some of the other reviews and did a half and half with cottage cheese and ricotta.  I think next time I will use some italian sausage, but I will have to say that this was a great recipe.

I used turkey instead of ground beef.  Absolutely delicious.  The cottage cheese adds a nice touch. This was a hit with my family and will certainly appear on our table again.  Thank you!

This was a great recipe but I like my lasagna with a little more cheese. I added grated parmesan and used  8oz. ricotta along with the cottage cheese. I mixed 2 eggs and 1 1/2 tsp aregano into the cheeses.  I also covered the dish for 30 minutes of the cooking time. Came out great!!

This recipe is great! It's not difficult and it tastes great. I skip a step by using the type of lasagna noodles that you don't have to boil first.

very good.  incredibly simple to make, it took as much effort as it would to make spaghetti.  i added more of my spaghetti sauce seasonings because we enjoy lots of spices and it turned out great.

I love this lasagna. I have been using this recipe exactly as written for over a year. I like to use Ragu's Robusto Parmesan and Romano sauce. Anytime I take a meal to someone I always make Bob's Lasagna!

Well, Bob, I have to thank you. I've been married almost 9 years and my husband has NEVER used the term "delicious" to describe anything I have cooked---until tonight! I made a few modifications to this recipe such as using italian sausage instead of ground beef, using 2 jars of spaghetti sauce instead of 1, and combining cottage and ricotta cheese to make 16 oz (with a dash of parmesean), but he said it was DELICIOUS!!!! Bob, you may have saved my marriage! Thanks!

This is a great basic recipe that is easy to take up a notch.  I substituted ricotta for half of the cottage cheese, and added a little parmesan.  For the sauce, I added a teaspoon of oregano, and a teaspoon of basil, and let it simmer enough for the flavors to really blend well.  However, even as written, it is a great recipe, and a guaranteed favorite of guests.

This was pretty good for my first time making lasagna at home.  I did, however, take the advice of other members and tweek it a little bit.  I added 1/2 lb. of italian sausage with the beef mixture, used Vodka sauce with the Prego sauce, added a little hot sauce and fresh garlic.  Also, I used Barilla no-boil noodles which worked wonderfully.  I also mixed ricotta and cottage cheese to equal 16 oz, and next time will double that (I like lots of cheese).  My boyfriend loved it, and I can't wait to try it again.  (Made great leftovers, too.)  Thanks, Bob!

This was not too bad but it was salty.  I wound up simmering some potatos with the meat/sauce to try to get some of the salt out of there.  it was not overly cheesy also.  We won't try this one again per the recipe but will do some major modifications on the original and give it another go.

Bob's guidelines have really helped me fine tune my own lasagna ideas.  I think this is a great base recipe that needs to be kicked up a notch.  As suggested by other reviewers, I used (and needed) additional sauce and cheese.  I spiced up the meat with onions and seasonings and then replaced the cottage cheese for ricotta (mixed with a small amount of pesto and parmesan).  I found those homemade pasta sheets at our local grocery store too (thanks to whoever made that suggestion!).  One thing I love about lasagna, is that it's a great dish to prepare in advance.  I put it together the day before a party and pop it in the oven the day of.  THANKS BOB!

Easy, tasty comfort food. I've also made with my own homemade sauce, which makes it that much better--but using the jarred sauce is a nice convenience when you're short on time. Either way, this recipe is hard to beat.

This was probably the best lasagna recipe that I have made! I got all the way through the steps - when I realized that I only had half of the needed mozzerella. So I just sprinkled extra parmesan on the very top layer. It was fabulous! I did use a little extra sauce and meat that the others reviewers suggested. Thanks Bob - it was great!

I've always struggled with making lasagna.. it never would turn out right.  I believe strongly now that the key is to not boil the noodles.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, my family loves it.

I tried this recipe for the first time 2 years ago.  In fact, its been with me through 2 ex-boyfriends.  Everytime I make it, it is a huge hit!  Plus there are always plenty of leftovers.  When reheating, I add fresh mozzarella on top before I put it into the oven.  Thanks Bob!!!!

I thought this was a great recipe and very easy.  I added extra cheese and two eggs to the cottage cheese mixture.  My first time making lasagna and I was very impressed.

This was my first time making lasagna and I was surprised by how easy this recipe is.  And it was delicious!  I did subsitute cottage cheese with ricotta cheese, but other than that, I stuck to the recipe and it was great. :)

This is a very good recipe. I have never cooked lasagne with cottage cheese, or
for that matter even bought large curd cottage cheese. But, this was super. My 
husband usually likes to reheat his lasagne after it gets cold, but he liked this
one alot when it first came out of the oven. This is the recipe I'll use for lasagne
from now on.

I have been making Lasagne for years, but decided
to try this recipe. My husband says it is the best I ever made.  He was always opposed to me trying cottage cheese, but I did it anyway and he loved it.  I also tried the method of adding some water and not cooking the noodles try it you'll be amazed.  Make sure to let it sit for a few minutes though.  I crumble Italian sausage and cook it and add it to the recipe, or also some pepperoni pieces. YUM and EASY

Yum Yum!  Was easier and better than my old lasagna recipe.  Made 2 pans, but had increased the amount of the cheeses as others suggested.  I would probably also increase the amount of meat due to this.  Very tasty and very easy!  I am wondering about adding 1/4 lb of hot italian sausage, may do next time.  Will make again for sure.

I absolutely loved it.  I also added about 1/2 C of water to the hamburger mixture and then put the noodles in uncooked.  It was a real timesaver.
It was sooooooooooooooo good.

I doubled the recipe, adding a pound of Italian sausage, a 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes and a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce (plus Italian seasoning and fresh garlic). I blended the cheeses with one egg and about 1/2 cup of Parmesan. It was delicious!

Have made lasagna twice; first time disaster. This time success. I used "oven ready" noodles and added a small amount of water to the casserole pan - no boiling, perfect. Also added 1 Tbsp. of water mixed with 1/4 tsp. of baking soda to facilitate browning, but also to make it more tender. (Velveting) Will make this again - thank you for an easy to make treat!

Amazing!! I did add a couple of eggs to the cottage cheese and my teenage boys actually commented on that in particular. I also just soaked the noodles in hot water to soften while I prepared the rest. Noodles turned out perfectly. It was awesome

I have made this lasagna many times. My family loves this lasagna. I make the following alterations: ground white turkey, and I add grated Parmesan cheese on top of the mozzarella cheese.

Big hit with the family but the only thing I did different was 1 layer of ricotta cheese and 1 layer of cottage cheese

This was a delicious recipe. I made a few tweaks. I followed the recipe except I added 2 cloves of garlic instead of using garlic salt. I wanted to have a bit of a spice kick so I added one scotch bonnet pepper finely chopped and added cayenne pepper to taste along with a generous sprinkle of chilli flakes. Sometimes I add a splash of Worcester sauce to the beef sauce too. I sprinkled plenty of dried Italian herbs to the sauce along with some chopped mushrooms and a grated carrot. I added nutmeg to the cottage cheese and sprinkled cheddar and marble cheese on top with sprinkle of the Italian herbs and cayenne on top too. It was delicious! Served with garlic bread this was a delicious comfort meal. Thanks Bob!

Love it!! I substituted the ground beef for frozen beefless ground to make it vegetarian and swapped out the cottage cheese for ricotta. Super easy and delicious!

Not enough filling or spices.  Tasted bland and felt like mostly a mouth full of noodles.

Love how easy this was. I only made one change in that I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. I made two amounts thinking that I would freeze one for later but my teenage son had other plans, lol. Will definitely be making this again and again!

Would definitely make again. However, I used a whole white onion minced, 2 pounds of ground meat, and used a 64 ounce can of spaghetti sauce. Sauce amount is a must on this recipe.  Easily will feed 10.

Great simple recipe! Like others I mixed the cheeses with 1 egg and layered it. I also did not cook the noodles- layed them dry but the poured about 1/4 c water around the edge, covered with tin foil a d baked! So delish!

I'm not sure what went "wrong" with this one- but it did not turn out near as well as other lasagna recipes I have tried. This one was more "simple", for sure! But, the results were pretty flat & dry. Maybe I used a box of noodles that was too old? I doubt that killed the entire dish, but the amount of sauce called for is definitely NOT enough. Probably why it came out pretty dry. I also think some ricotta cheese should be added in- half cottage cheese & half ricotta would have worked better, IMO. And I think there needs to be a significant amount of Parmesan to accompany the mozzarella. This was a decent recipe for minimal lasagna ingredients, a lot less effort & time than other recipes entail... but the results were not that good. I would have been embarrassed to serve this to anyone besides myself. Not sure I will attempt this one again unless I am in a pinch.

I was a skeptic really about this simple cottage cheese lasagna but this turned out super tasty! I did modify the recipe though- I added a tub of ricotta a bag of shredded mozzarella and two eggs to the cottage cheese, as well as a decent dash of black pepper. To the meat mixture I added some herbs and a package of frozen spinach to make it heartier and healthier somewhat. Very tasty- I'm excited to have leftovers tomorrow!

This recipe is absolutely amazing and i personally recommend this dish for any quick quick delicious nights where you are tired or dont feel like cooking, but i highly recommend that you add to the mince while sauteing about 1 teaspoon of mild curry powder, give or take depending on your taste. Even if you do not like spicy food the mild curry powder adds a bit of 'pizaz' to the flavor.

It's a decent beginner lasagna recipe.  I thought I'd share some tips for the beginner "chef" or "cook in training".  Lasagna is one of those meals that can easily be transformed into a healthier well-rounded meal.  
   I use ground turkey & maybe add some Italian sausage.  *sautéed & drained if needed.  I use whatever jar sauce & canned tomatoes.  I also get sneaky & mince in a food processor or my vitamix VEGGIES!  *OH yeah- my lasagna is LOADED with carrots, onions, celery, mushrooms, peppers, and spinach.  Ricotta- can get pricey so I use cottage cheese mixed with ricotta. 
   I also use cheese blends and no boil noodles makes it easy to assemble.  I also add extra Italian seasonings & roasted garlic.  Serve with salad *yay for more veggies & garlic bread..

Tweaked the recipe per the suggestion of other home cooks. I used extra meat(well seasoned), ricotta (well seasoned), and saved time by soaking the pasta instead of boiling. I also cooked the dish covered in foil and removed the foil during the last 10mins. The recipe was super easy and quite tasty. I've never made lasagna before and based on how well it turned out i will definitely make it again.

This is our go to lasagna. Over time I've adapted it so I know to use 9 noodles and small curd cottage cheese. I like to mix the sauce, beef, and cottage cheese together for easier spreading. It wouldn't hurt to add some extra mozzarella but it is good as is.

This was good, but a bit on the plain side. Maybe some peppers in the meat would give it more of a kick. Also, I would use more meat then recommended. Some veggies like spinach, zucchini, or mushrooms in the sauce would be good also.

I used 40oz/2 jars of sauce, and my lasagna was still a little dry. The recipe called for 1 hour at 350F, I should have only cooked it for 45-50 min. I will do this next time and make sure that I use shredded Mozzarella for the top layer. 
It is a great basic recipe, but I recommend cooking it either a lower heat or for less time. Also, some Italian spices would give it more flavour.

Using a 9x13 pan and only 8oz of lasagna noodles would not have worked. I ended up throwing this in an 8x13 pan and put it in the fridge to make it tonight after work.

I used small curd cottage cheese instead

I also only put half the salt, and half of the garlic salt they advised. 

I added thyme and oregano to the grounded beef, and you should probably go with 1.5lbs of ground beef. 

Used Prego Spaghetti sauce 

Over all, everyone enjoyed this recipe :)

After you fry the noodles till as crispy as possible with out burning, use ricotta instead of disgusting cottage cheese, add an egg to the sauce, and add a layer of bacon to each level then it truly is a five star recipe with out those additions it's only 3 stars at best.

Delicious!  I made a few modifications based on other reviews: substituted half the meat with italian sausage and added an egg to the ricotta.  I'm usually not a lasagna fan but it's my husband's favorite meal.  With this recipe, we both enjoy lasagna!

Awesome, prepared this in about 30 min and turned out flawlessly. Not bad for my first lasagna. Simple and delicious, just like every great recipe. Only thing I would suggest is that you let it settle for atleast an hour. I cut into mine after 15 min and it was running all over the place. I actually ate mine the next morning and it was PERFECT.

I thought I'd try based on the 4.5 star review, but it was obviously misleading.  I also found the cottage cheese intriguing, but that didn't pan out like it should have, either.   .

This recipe was AMAZING. I made it Wednesday night before Thanksgiving and it was a hit! I made two huge pans and there were no leftovers. My sister's children said that it was even better than hers, which is a 10 in my book! I can't wait to try more recipes. I believe goulast will be next!

This was the first lasagna I have ever made, and it turned out great!  Several people suggested it needed more sauce, so I increased it by 50%.  The only other changes I made were to use 1/2 turkey sausage and 1/2 ground beef (96% lean) and to use 2% mozzarella cheese.  I also made enough sauce to make another lasagna, and I'm going prepare the lasagna, freeze it, and cook it at a later date.  Thanks for the recipe, Bob!

This Lasagna is delicious.  I used ground turkey and lowfat cottage cheese just to lessen the calories.  This is so easy to make as well.  My first try at making Lasagna ever a it turned out perfect.

A bit too much sauce, so next time I will reduce the amount of that.. but otherwise, very tasty! It was my first time making lasagna and the kids said it tasted as good, if not better, than store bought. Make sure you let it cool before serving, though... a lesson I learned. LOL.

Just o.k. for us. Bland and not cheesey enough. It reminded me of a frozen Lean Cuisine Lasagna. The cottage cheese just kind of disappeared, contributed little flavor and didn't add any body to the lasagna itself. I added 1/2 pound of  italain sausage to the meat. I think that really helped. I didn't bother to cook the noodles ahead. I just added a 1/2 cup of water to the sauce and covered the lasagna while cooking. Then when the nooldes were done, about 45 minutes, I took off the foil, topped with cheese and cooked for about 5 more minutes. Definitely wait the 10 minutes to serve. It helps everything set up.

I LOVE how easy this is!!! I added a little more meat than called for and some sauteed mushrooms. I didn't have enough spaghetti sauce or cottage cheese to cover 3 layers. I will add more next time. Can't wait to eat the leftovers tonight!!

My husband gives this a five-star, but I like my lasagna to have a bit more "stuff" in it.  A good base recipe, and easy to make. Maybe next time I will put mushrooms and black olives in half!  Thank you for the recipe.

I used the oven-ready lasagna noodles for convenience and I only made two changes to the recipe: I added a bit of garlic powder to the meat, and I took the advice of several reviewers and added an egg to the cheeses to make it hold together better. I didn't bother to drain the cottage cheese like some reviewers said you have to do and it didn't matter. Mine turned out perfectly! Not too dry, not too runny. This was the easiest lasagna I have ever made. I will make this regularly.

My family and I love this recipe, it's easy to make.  Just for fun, I will substitute sausage for the hamburger, or add mushrooms, onions, and black olives.

This had a great flavor and was very easy! The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that I thought it needed more sauce. Next time I will double the sauce and maybe add some parmesan cheese. Thanks for the recipe, Bob!

I will be making this recipe for the 6th time and it will be for Christmas this year- I love it and so has pretty much anyone that I've made it for. I make a few changes- To the jar of spag sauce (i use prego traditional) I add one can of crushed tomatoes as well as some fresh herbs and garlic- this makes then the perfect amount of sauce. I also use a 1/2# of ground beef and 1/2# of italian sausage instead of a whole pound of beef. Leave the cottage cheese as is- its what makes it so good!

I made this lasagna for my daughter's birthday, and everyone loved it.  I was rather suprised at how well it turned out.  Excellent recipe.  I did tweak it just a bit.  I used Ricotta (with egg) in place of cottage cheese.  I also soaked the noodles for 20mins, and it was fabulous!  They didn't break, and when it cooked, it came out delicious.  I added spicy sausage as well as oregano, garlic, bay leaf and other personal favorite spices to the sauce.  Fantastic!  There were no left evers, so my daughter asked for more the next day.

Very good recipe. I added sauteed mushrooms. Just like previous comments, add the meat sauce first and add 1 egg to the cottage cheese mixture. My hubby devoured the lasagna.

This was so good. I used ricotta in place of the cottage cheese, because I'm not a fan of cottage cheese. I used a lot more mozzarella, probably around 20 oz. or so. This was my first time making lasagna, and I'm very pleased with how well it turned out. Great recipe.

this was a very good fast meal.  I subsituted ground beef for ground turkey because I dont eat red meat, and it still turned out delecious.  My cheese mix was a little runny though and did not stay together very good.

This is one of the first recipes I used from Allrecipes.  Let me just begin by saying I can't cook unless I have a recipe.  This recipe is great.  My picky kids and super picky husband loved this and raved about my cooking - ha - that never happened before.  Of course, I doubled the cheese.

this recipe was great.  Next time I'll mix both the cheeses together and use as one layer, and I will definitely need more meat.  I added some cilantro and nutmeg to the meat mixture like other reviewers recommended and I think it added a little flair.

This lasagna is absolutely delicious.  It was my first time ever making lasagna and it was perfect.  Of course I used Elanameg's Reveiw to help me out.  I added almost everything that she added.  Except I used italian sausage and ground beef, I did not add mushrooms or the provolonge cheese.  With Bobs ideas and Elanameg's ideas...this was pretty much the best lasagna EVER!!!!  Even my b/f loved it and if you knew how picky he is you would understand why I'm so excited.  Thanks for you're help!!!!!!!!!

If I can cook this and have it turn out ANYONE can!!!  I took other reviewer's advice and soaked the noodles in hot tap water(turned out great...i was worried) and used 1/2 ricotta and 1/2 cottage cheese mixed with an egg.  I used almost twice as much mozzerela (hubby loves).  I didn't read enough reviews to realize you MUST cover for the first 45 minutes or you will have burnt cheese. - still tasty though.  I added 3 oz of cut up pepperoni to the sauce and a jalapeno to the meat mixture.   YUMMY!!!!

Good recipe.  I tweaked it quite a bit though.  Added 1 lb. of bulk italian sausage, another jar of spaghetti sauce, parsley, parmesan, and an egg to the cottage cheese mixture and some extra italian seasonings to the jarred sauce.  Started with the meat mixture so nothing would stick to the pan, and added a whole heckuva lot more mozzarella and parmesan to the top.  It's a good base recipe for lasagna beginners though.

This lasagna is very simple to make. I did make a few changes. I added 1 lb of sausage and browned the meat onion and sauce mixture for about an hour. I switched ricotta for the cottege cheese just because I don't like how cottage cheese looks. I know that is silly but I doubt it makes a difference.

This is so easy. I make it in the morning, cover w/ foil and when we are ready, bake for 1 hour. I add extra chopped tomatoes and cottage cheese. This is a keeper. Thanks Bob. Lekker!!

This is an excellent recipe for a quick lasagna.  It has taste and is fairly easy.  I give it four stars because the recipe will not impress, but keep in mind that if you feel like eating lasagna during the week after coming home from work, this recipe will be more than satisfying in taste and time.

It was great! We also soaked the noodles for 30 minutes, added one egg to the cottage cheese, and covered it in foil as previously suggested . Delicious and no burnt cheese! Will definitely make again with some spinach next time! Thanks!!

This  was okay but nothing spectacular. I've made better lasagna's. It was very easy to make so it's worth it if you don't have the time.

Was a great lasagna. Mine turned out a little watery for some reason.  I added mushrooms, and will add more cheese and maybe some black olives next time.

Fantastic!  I am from Italian heritage and this lasagna is superb!  I add a little italian seasoning and some oregano to the sauce for a little more flavor. This lasagna is much better than anything lasagna recipe I have tasted at a restaurant.

After reading the reviews, I added an egg and a dash of nutmeg to the cottage cheese. I also added shredded Parmesan and cheddar cheese to the cottage cheese mixture. I followed the rest of the recipe and then to top it off I sprinkled cheddar and mozzarella on the top of the lasagna.

This was disappointing.  Seemed like it was very bland ... not quite sure might have been missing. It was a lot faster than my normal sauce made from scratch, but sometimes slow is worth it!

Tasty...So quick and easy. I did mix the cheese with 2 eggs, doubled the sauce, added 1 tsp. oregano, and didn't grease the pan.I also did not precook the noodles, so I added 1/2 cup water. I also topped it with more mozzarella and some grated parmesan.

This was easy enough to make, although for some reason even though I used slightly more than 1 pound of ground beef and doubled the amount of pasta sauce, I didn't have enough meat sauce to  spread on 3 layers.  The other reviewers don't see to have this problem so I'm puzzled; perhaps I'll just have to chalk it up to inexperience but next time I might have to buy more meat. I also substituted ricotta cheese for cottage cheese, although next time I might try cottage as it looked much easier on a student's wallet. I didn't use any salt, just minced a few cloves of fresh garlic and used a very tasty and flavourful pasta sauce.

Edit: Now that I've had it, I found it rather bland, so next time I'll throw in herbs and such.

This is the best lasanga recipe ever.  I have thrown out the rest of recipes for lasanga that were in my recipe file.  My family is very finicky about their lasanga and they had me fix this two nights in a row and have asked repeatedly for me to make this.  The only thing that I change is ground beef for ground turkey (I don't eat beef), but that didn't stop my beefeaters from loving it.  Thanx Bob!!

Pretty easy and tasted good but had to make a couple adjustments.  Doubled the amount of meat, cottage cheese and spagetti sauce to have a real serving of 12.

Pretty quick to whip together and totally delicious!!  I used ground turkey instead of beef and added a package of frozen chopped spinach and some shredded parmesan to the cottage cheese mixture (added 1 egg to bind everything together).  Instead of garlic salt, I used some fresh minced garlic.  My husband and I are looking forward to eating the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

I had never made lasagna before.  This was so easy and tasty!  I wrapped the leftovers individually in tin foil and then all you have to do is defrost and nuke it.  Just as good as it was the night it was made.

This Lasagna was so good! I made it for a dinner party I threw and one of my friends fiance's even emailed me the next day to tell me how impressed he was.  I made just a few modifications.  First, i doubled the sauce and used sausage instead of ground beef.  I also probably ended up using more cheese than the recipe called for.  I made it a day ahead, so the spices would all have time to meld.  Thanks for this one, it's a definite keeper!

Wow!  This was sooooo yummy!  I think using cottage cheese instead of ricotta made it extra-good.  Both my small children ate adult-size portions... and asked for seconds!  My husband took the rest for his lunch.  Super!

This is a seriously good lasagna recipe. My family absolutely LOVED it. The only thing that I will change next time (and there will be a next time) will be to omit the regular salt, and just use the garlic salt. It was just a little too salty, but still delicious!

Great recipe. I followed some other suggestions and did 1 cup each of cottage cheese and ricotta. I also added an egg to the cheeses. It turned out wonderful. I did end up running out of cheese before I was done layering, so next time I will double the cheese mixture. Other than that, fantastic recipe!

This was a pretty good lasagna recipe. I used ricotta cheese in place of the cottage cheese & reduced the amount. Since I reduced the amount of ricotta I added more mozzarella cheese to replace it.

This was really yummy!!  I took the advice of some other reviewers and added an egg to the cottage cheese.  I also added (to the cottage cheese) 1/4 cup grated paremesan cheese, parsley, salt, pepper and a little garlic powder.  I also added a bay leaf to the sauce as it simmered.  My 5 year old gobbled it up! YUM!

By far the easiest lasagna I have ever made. I too thought it needed a little more sauce. Never-the-less, this is a great tasting, no fail, easy lasagna to make. I will make this again, next time I will add some ricotta cheese as well.

This recipie turned out awesome...I added some peppers to the sauce and used 2x700ml bottles of sauce...the only thing that kept this from being a 5 star recipie is that I found it rather salty for my tastes...next time I will omit the salt.

This was pretty good. However, it seemed to be lacking something. I like just a bit more spice. I may try adding a tiny pinch of cayanne to the sauce mixture next time. Overall, it was very tasty.

This is definitely a winner! I didn't use as much sauce, only 1(32oz) jar of spaghetti sauce and it still came out all juicy and good. Never thought making lasagna can be so simple. I already made it twice because my husband likes it so much.

I've made this several times. Everyone always loves it. It's a no fail recipe. I use the no-cook lasagna noodles, and sometimes add a little bit of ricotta cheese to the cottage cheese. Adding a chopped onion and some minced fresh garlic adds extra flavor also. I add extra spices to my sauce too. The recipe is wonderful on it's own. I just like to experiment!

This was a little bland for my taste. Easy to make, but will definitely add more seasoning and maybe some crushed tomato for some texture next time.

My husband and I made this last night and it was pretty good.  A little salty for our taste though.  Next time we'll probably leave out the salt.  It might have been the sauce we used.

Easy to prepare and a nice flavor...I did 1/2 cottage cheese and 1/2 ricotta as suggested. I will say...I would add more sauce next time.  A few picky eaters enjoyed it. :D thanks

My husband didn't like this very much.  I think it was because it didn't taste much like the traditional lasagna that I make.  I thought it was okay and it was pretty fast to make.

This is a no fail recipe with great results! It's easy to make and tastes great. Like many, I opt for the no cook lasagna noodles, and usually use extra cheese in my prep. The kids love it, and I love it for it's ease, and it makes a wonderful lunch the next day!

i made this last night. i'm just learning to cook, so my new husband has had to show me a little grace, but when he raved about how good this dish was i actually believed him this time. used fresh garlic only because i wanted to use the new garlic press i got for christmas. also used more sauce because i'm a sauce girl. was so good and easy, will definitely use again and again. thanks bob.

This is a great simple lasagna recipe. It tasted even better the next day. After reading other reviews, I added one 14.5 oz can of diced peeled tomatoes (drained), about 6 oz. of tomato sauce, and a teaspoon of Italian seasoning.  I also used no boil noodles and baked it covered with foil for the first 45 minutes. I think next time I will try it with 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 Italian sausage for a stronger flavor.

This recipe is good.  I did make the following changes though and it turned out really moist!  I used two 28 oz jars of spag. sauce and 30 oz. ricotta cheese.  I left out the cottage cheese.  I will definitely make this again.

Great lasagna.  Very easy and one of the more slimmed down versions out there. Doesn't skimp on flavor though.  You won't be disappointed.

Excellent recipe.  I will use it again.  It is too salty for our tastes, so next time I will use garlic powder in place of garlic salt.  I also think that I might use extra cottage cheese.  YUM, thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made this lasagna tonight for my aunt and uncle's family, and my cousin swore up and down she hated it because it had meat in it, but guess who I caught stealing a piece after everybody was gone! This was an awesome and quick thing to make, and I will definently use it again

Very good, very easy!  I did half cottage, half ricotta cheese like some have suggested and was very pleased.  I quadrupled the recipie because I was cooking for 4 families (includoing my own) and had everyone ask me for the recipe after that and give me tons of compliments, so I would recommend it to anyone!  Enjoy!

Blah. I didn't really care for this lasagna, it seemed pretty blah to me. My husband liked it though, hence the 3 stars. But then, he said as long as it didn't have ricotta cheese in it, he'd like it. 
Sorry, not what I was looking for!
Note: I used the no-boil lasagna noodles as well.

Thumbs Up! I've tried at least 7 different lasagna recipes and my family really loved this one!I used the no-boil recipe on the box for the noodles and used 2 (1lb.10oz.)jars of sauce instead of one.I was really pleased with the cottage cheese,because it was not as "heavy" and  will use  instead of ricotta from now on.

I could not believe how well this recipe turned out.  I followed the directions as written except I used the no boil noodles and used 2-26 ounce jars of spaghetti sauce.  Absolutely the easiest and best lasagna I've ever made.  My husband said we had to give this one five stars, and I would give it more if I could.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This was an amazing and easy recipe. My family wanted to east it every day for a week. It is almost better the next day! YUMMY. I left out the garlic salt (too salty) and I used 1/2 pound shredded cheddar and 1/2 pd mozzarella with a small tub of riccotta cheese slathered in between the layers. Highly recommend!

This was my first attempt at making lasagna. I am newly married and still getting used to the idea of having to provide for myself AND my husband. After many attempts to make something he would want to eat leaftovers of, this recipe was a Godsend!! He LOVED it! I left out the salt (as it was salty enough without it) and I think next time I will add more cheese. I will definetely make this again. Thank goodness there's something out there that novice cooks can't mess up!

Easy and delicious! Definitely need to use 2 jars (52oz) of spaghetti sauce. I omitted the salt and garlic salt because the cheese made it salty enough as is. I also sauteed 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic and used small curd 1% fat cottage cheese. This recipe is good for hiding random vegetables lying around. Add thinly sliced celery or some shredded carrots and the kids will never know.

This lasagna was very essay to make.  Instead of using garlic salt in the beef I used fresh garlic.  And I also added mushrooms to the meat when I browned it.  I used a prego sauce with italian sausage that added an extra flavor to the dish.  This recipe is very simple to make and the end result is absolutely delicious.

Awesome lasagna! A bit on the greasy side, but I suspect if I use a leaner ground beef and less cheese(I used 2 1lb bags) it'll turn out even better.  I used the no-boil lasagna noodles and it turned out great. I also used 1 1/2 jars of Prego Pasta sauce flavored with meat(though I think I will try some chunky veggie one or mushroom one next time). I omitted the cottage cheese and substituted the garlic salt with a teaspoon of minced garlic.  Oh, I also used a mozzarella/provolone shredded cheese mix instead of just straight mozzarella and it was real good. :9 I covered the baking dish in foil and it kept the cheese from burning....but be sure to "tent" it up a bit so it doesn't settle on your top cheese layer and stick to the underside of the foil. :)  I found letting it cool for maybe 15 minutes or so makes it set up better. I'll definitely make this again! Maybe add some hot italian sausage with the beef to kick it up a notch, maybe some crushed red pepper too. :)

I have never rated a recipe before, however this one is wonderful!  I served it to guests last evening and it was a huge hit!  I added an extra sauce, seasonings to taste,used no boil lasagna noodles, but other than that I would not change a thing!

Made this recipe over the weekend and everyone made comments that this was the best lasagna.  I had a very large pan and did a 1.5 ratio of ingredients to the noodles.  I also mixed together Ricotta and cottage cheese instead of just cottage cheese. It turned out great.  Will definitely make this lasagna recipe from now on.

This recipe was wonderful.  I made it for a dinner party and everyone absolutely loved it.  Everyone said that it was by far the best lasagna that they've ever had.  I made a couple of changes to the recipe that others had suggested.  I used 2 jars of speghetti sauce, added some Italian seasoning when cooking the meat, and used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  It was absolutely delicious and fairly easy to make.

I really liked this recipe, but I thought it was a little too salty. Next time I'll probably ease up on the garlic salt.

This recipe was perfect!! Nothing too fancy, just really good lasagna. If you are worried because you or someone you know is a cottage cheese hater, don't be. My boyfriend won't eat cottage cheese for anything, but he ate this lasagna for 3 days straight!!! Really easy and really good!!

Very good and very simple. Everyone loved it and it turned out much better than mine does, even though I thought they were basically the same, I guess having a recipe to follow can make the difference sometimes

Easy and tastes great!  I did use extra spaghetti sauce as others had suggested.  Plus I used 24 oz instead of 16 oz tub of cottage cheese.  We still have leftovers and my husband already asked when I'll be making this again!  Thanks for your recipe!  A+!

True to it's name, Bob's Lasagna is AWESOME! It is incredibly simple to prepare and bake. As previously indicated by others, it is best to have additional sauce and cheese prepared.  I used 1 1/2 jars of sauce and 1 1/2 lbs of mozzarella.  I also added 1 tbsp of pesto to the ground beef for additional flavor.  My husband, who dislikes groundbeef, loved this recipe! This was a wonderful contribution Bob!!!!

This was a good, simple recipe. I had some sauce frozen that I made the week before so I just used that. I also used Ricatta cheese rather than cottage cheese.

Great recipe.  The only things I changed:
-Used TWO FULL jars of sauce.  Used Barilla sauce w/ black & green olives.  Added extra italian spices, seasoned salt, and garlic salt to 93% lean ground beef.  Also added spattini seasoning to the sauce.  Brought to near boil then simmered on low for an hour.
-Mixed cottage cheese with mozarella.  Added oregano, 2 eggs, and italian seasoning to it.
-Topped with sliced mozarella.
DELICIOUS!

This recipe is good if you have about an hour a half to make it. I am not the cook in the family but thought that it sounded easy enough so I decided to make it. Not sure if I did something wrong or not, but I ran out of meat sauce when layering and had to spread it very thin. I thought I had used more than a pound (which is what is called for). And I was only able to use 6 lasagna noodles verses the 9 I think it called for. Over all though, the recipe was pretty simple....just a little time consuming for me :o)

I recently discovered this website and was fascinated with all that was available to try. This was easy to make, however I made some adjustments.  First I used a little over 1 lb of ground sirloin sauteed with 3 garlic cloves. I used Classico sun-dried tomato marinara sauce, 1.5 cans of tomato sauce and 1 (6oz) can of tomato paste.  I like my food spicy so I added red pepper flakes along with italian seasoning, oregano and parsley and let it simmer.  I also used 2 cups of ricotta cheese and about 1/4 cup of cottage cheese along with about 2 cups of monterrey jack cheese (all I had). Seems like a lot but my husband and I really enjoyed this!

The taste was fantastic, but the appearance wasn't so great.  I think I just needed to let it cool longer so it wouldn't fall apart when I tried to serve it.  It was a big hit though, and the leftovers were the best!!!

Our family has been looking for a great lasagna recipe, and we picked this recipe because my husband loves lasagna, but doesn't like ricotta cheese. We added alittle extra cheese, and sauce, then threw in fresh sauted mushrooms, which made it extra good! We made it for friends, one of which didn't like cottage cheese, and he still loved it. We are adding this to our family cookbook!

I have always used cottage cheese so this is basically the same as mine - great recipe though.  I used more cheese then this called for.

I like this recipe a lot!  I usually use ground turkey instead of the beef and ricotta instead of the cottage cheese.  Mmmmmm...yummy!

This recipe turned out very well, although in truth it's not much different from my own recipe that I've been using for years.  I use precooked boxed noodles, which saves a lot of time.  I have never used the garlic salt in my recipe - otherwise it's almost exactly the same.  Good, but I think I'll keep using my method.  Very tasty, though.

Everything about the recipe was great.. except it could have used an extra tub of cottage cheese and i only used 16oz rather than 32oz of mozzarella and it still turned out great.

I don't know what makes this recipe so good, but it really is.  We only had a 28 oz jar of spaghetti sauce so we added an 8 oz can of tomato sauce to the recipe.

This is a great, basic, hearty lasagna recipe. Perfect for when you're needing an Italian food fix. Like many of the other reviews recommend, I didn't cook the noodles first (added 1/2 cup water), added more spices to the sauce and I used ricotta cheese, which I like better. Enjoy.

My 2 year old loved it! I recently served in for Sunday lunch for 10 and everyone loved it. I did make a few alterations; I added shredded carrots, mushrooms, zucchini, summer squash to my tomato sauce(from a jar). And I also chopped up firm tofu and added it to the cottage cheese layer and used cheddar cheese and Gouda as well as mozzarella. I also used Turkey sausage for the meat. I loved using the cottage cheese instead of the Ricotta, GREAT idea, much lower in fat!

I absolutley LOVE this lasagna, it is easy to make and tastes great!  I usually triple the recipe and put it in to smaller square pans (makes about 6-8)Then I just freeze them so that I can pull them out for a quik and easy diner whenever I like. I usually bake one pan if it's just me and the boyfriend, or two if it's the whole family.  Freezing the lasagna doesn't take away from the flavor, but makes it much tastier as the juices have had time to come together.  I always add spinach and extra garlic to the sauce, as well as feta or some sort of other flavored cheese.  This makes for a wonderfully flavored pasta dish that your family will love!

Very easy, tasty lasagne. I actually didn't really enjoy the taste until the second day it had been sitting in the fridge. My 6 year old loved it, said it was better than macaroni and cheese (high praise coming from her!)

The best Lasagne I have ever had. Never knew that cottage cheese could taste so good. My family, especially my little girl, absolutely loves it too! Next time I will try to add a little cheddar cheese to the mozzarella. Thanks.

I was really impressed with how good this lasagna was! It was, by far, the easiest I've ever made, and tasted great. My husband thought it was a bit too seasoned (which I don't get because he loves things seasoned heavily), but still thought it was good.  I did add extra garlic, though, so that could have been why.  The leftovers the next day were even better!

I just got my Tried & True cookbook and was pleased to see this recipe in the book!  
Really simple for lasagne and everyone really loves it.  The cottage cheese makes it not as heavy as other recipes.  Sometimes I mix in a little bit of ricotta cheese.  Yummy and easy!

This was awesome!  I took a couple of other people's suggestions and added more cottage cheese but everything else was the same.  It was really cheesy and gooey and so easy to throw together.  I've tried several different lasagna recipes and this is by far the best - and the only one I'll ever use again.  Great job!

My whole family just loved this, especially my husband and 5 yr old son. It was so easy to make, much easier then some recipes I have used in the past, and it tastes wonderful.. I did add more mozzerella cheese on top then it called for.. but then we are all cheese lovers. This will be a staple in our house.

I've never before had a really successful experience with making lasagna, but this recipe changed that.  I made it this past Sunday, and I plan to make it again this Friday!  However, I would recommend letting it sit for as long as 30 minutes before serving, to make cutting easier.
