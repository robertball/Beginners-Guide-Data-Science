Followed exactly and came out great, so much better than just plain old peas,although I used Velveeta as I had no cheddar on hand

I liked these.  I had to use mozzarella cheese because at the last minute (I had everything else mixed together already) I realized I had no cheddar.  My husband felt there was too much rosemary and thyme, so next time I will probably decrease those spices by about half.

I really liked the flavor; didn't think the herbs were too strong at all. My sauce broke almost instantly, however - I guess that's what you get when you use nonfat milk. I had hoped using full fat cheddar would mitigate that, but no. So I think next time I will just cook some peas, combine the other ingredients in the microwave or something, and then pour over top the peas.

When I first saw the name and read the ingredients it made me curious to try. I thought it was great. Something very different. I doubled the recipe and did 1 part cheddar and 1 part velvetta. I will make again. But I think next time I will leave out the rosemary and thyme. I used less than the recipe called for and it was strong to me. Maybe it was one or the other but not sure which one. But other than that it was awesome.

LOVED the way this turned out! They were fantastic. I normally hate peas, but this made it possible for me to eat them. Thanks!

I've done this with canned peas and also frozen peas (just cook the frozen peas before adding cheese).  I've used about 9 slices of American cheese per can of peas also and it's worked fine.  A fast & easy microwave sidedish.

Tried this for lunch, with left over peas. I reduced the amounts of everything because I only had about 1/2 cup of peas. Really didn't care for this, too cheesy and the herbs were to strong for me. I prefer peas in a Bechamel sauce, with salt and white pepper to taste. Although I might try a Tablespoon or 2 of cheese melted into the Bechamel sauce next time, with maybe just a small pinch of rosemary.

I don't normally like peas but everyone else in my family does. I looked for something new...this was pretty good. I would make it again!

We really didn't care for these.  The cheddar cheese didn't melt that well and even with the cheese and butter they seemed bland.

Loved it!  I had to make some substitutions because I didn't have exactly what the recipe called for on hand, but it turned out great!  I will definitely be making this again!

Hmm.  I wanted to like this, but it just was not our thing.  Yes, we tasted the thyme and the rosemary and I agree it's a bit much, but we didn't like the cheese and milk in it either.  I'm glad we could try this, but it clearly isn't what we like in this household--we ate about 2 servings to get in our veggies but tossed the rest.  Don't let this stop you though if you are interested--it just wasn't a combo we liked.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  It needs a different cheese, although I don't know what.  The cheddar overpowered the other flavors.  But, it was still very good.

Always loved cheese & peas. My mom made these for us as kids so we'd eat our veggies. That was over 40 years ago. Only difference is that we always used Velveta and no eatra herbs. Love them still to this day. We never felt the need to add all the extra herbs to this dish.

My family found this delicious!  My only difficulty was the sauce which, even though I followed the recipe exactly, turned into a gluey mess quickly.  I thinned it out but it still didnâ€™t want to reach a smooth (not thick) consistency.  So, 4 stars for taste but I would really check the sauce for texture and adjust it before you add any peas!

Love peas and had never had cheese on them, so I was excited to try something new.  Hubby said it tasted like peas, I agree, nothing special.  Might try a different cheese next time.

I would not make this again. The rosemary and thyme were too over powering.

So i changed few things because of what i had on hand. I steamed the peas for 2 min and removed them to a strainer while i made the cheese sauce. I doubled the recipe, used frozen peas,  half n half(out of milk), and seasoned with mckormick standard italian seasoning, and a pinch of salt n pepper. I thought it was to die for.

I used this recipe as basically a template and added corn as well as shredded Colby jack and a slice of American cheese, some diced ham and bacon, garlic powder, salt and pepper, and a little more butter and milk. The end result was pretty darn tasty. Would give 5 stars if only the corn was at least added in the recipes because it goes so naturally with the peas. Still highly recommend you play with this recipe and make it your own! Good stuff
