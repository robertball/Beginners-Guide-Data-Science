Hello everyone.  I am so glad you like my recipe.  Some people were wondering why I called it spicy, my recipe was edited by the owners of this web site and they put corn chips down instead of spicy Fritos.  You can also use chili cheese Fritos in this recipe if you can't find the hot and spicy Fritos.  Another option is to get black beans with jalepeno peppers added, it gives the salad an extra kick.  Also, make sure to add the Fritos last, since they will get soggy if they sit in the salad too long  -Taseia

This was really good! I used leaf lettuce rather than Romaine, garbanzos rather than pintos. I also added chopped black olives, chopped red onion, chopped scallions and a bit of cilantro. Don't be afraid to adapt this recipe to what you have on hand. It works really well.

This was a huge hit at the cinco de mayo party!!!  Thanks for the tip about using hot-n-spicy fritos!  I also made a dressing by mixing 1 cup of ranch with ine cup of salsa (because I can't find any spicy ranch in my area) it was awesome!  Also added some red onion, black olives, and shoepeg corn.  A total delight!

My best friend asked us over for Chili last night and I took this salad.  It was a humongous hit! Everyone had at least two servings and there was very little left over despite the fact that I doubled the recipe for our party of six. I did add some black olives and an avacado to it.  Will definately make again!

Great, easy supper fast meal.  We use Ranch rather than catalina dressing just because we like it better.  I don't add the tortilla chips to the bowl, they get too soggy if there are leftovers.  Just place some on a plate and add the salad mix.

To add more protein, I added a half pound of cooked ground beef that I seasoned with homemade taco seasoning. I ate mine sans corn chips and I made my own dressing from salsa and sour cream (lower in carbs). Other than using my taco seasoning, I don't see what's spicy about it but we enjoyed it and it was a quick, healthy, lower carb supper for the kids and I after a long day at work.

This was a wonderful salad.  I followed the recipe exactly except I browned some ground beef with taco seasoning, let it cool slightly and added it to the salad.  It was delicious and my husband loved it.

SO SO SO yummy.  I made this for my boyfriend to go with enchiladas and Pina Coladas for a festive little meal and he couldn't stop raving about the salad.  I added avacados in place of the beans though (I avoid beans on dates!) and it's just delicious.  Also, I use bite-sized tortilla chips.  It'll be in my personal recipe box for years to come.

This recipe turned out very well.  I tried it for the first time at my son's birthday party and really liked it.  The only thing is, the chips will get soggy after a bit, so it's really better the first hour or so with the chips crunchy.  Good for feeding a large group of people.

This a great salad!  I took it to a luncheon we had at work and it was a big hit.  It's so easy to prepare, the next time I don't feel like cooking, I'll add some chicken to make a main meal.

A neat "meatless" taco salad!  Very good and so convienent and fast.  Very adapable - I threw some diced avocado and some minced jalapeno in too.  Will make this often this summer for a cool, easy supper.

Loved this salad Taseia.  We added some taco meat and used the Catalina dressing as instructed, but the spicy ranch that others have suggested sounds yummy!  I might have to give that a try next time we make this.  Thanks for sharing.

My husband had 3 bowls of this and he rarely has seconds on anything! I think next time I will try it with Mexican cheese and a more spicy/sweet dressing.

Sorry - just tasted wilty.  I skipped the black beans because I was using them in another dish and thank goodness - all I could taste was the pinto beans!  I did sub a mix of ranch dressing and salsa as some other reviewers did instead of the catalina, so maybe that didn't help.  Also, I used less than half the recommended amount of chips and that was plenty!  Unfortunately, they were wasted, as most of the salad ended up in the trash.

Other than the addition of black olives I followed this recipe.  I thought it looked very unappealing after mixing in the catalina dressing. I have had better tasting salads simular to this one.

Just ate this for lunch.  Good salad, but the only thing spicy about it was the red onion that I added, so I'm not sure what is with the name.  I absolutely LOVE black beans so I did enjoy having them in a salad, I added some left over corn as well.  Thanks Taseia!

Delicious and easy describes this one bowl meal. I had a half can of cooked chicken I wanted to use up so I tossed that in. Cut back on the chips by about half, too. But this made a great lunch. I will make this again. Thanks Taseia.

I couldn't believe how easy this recipe was and for the ease, how tasty!!! The piece de resistance of this recipe was the chips.  A great compliment to your mexican night.

Great salad with a few additions.  To zip it up a bit, I mixed the catalina with equal parts sour cream, a heaping teaspoon of taco seasoning and thinned it with lime.  To the salad I added red onion (1/2 cup) and cilantro (a good handful).  There was nary a leaf of romaine left in the bowl!

This was a big hit at a mexican themed dinner with friends. I crushed some hint of lime tortilla chips (used only 1/2 the amount called for), skipped the black beans and added one can of drained mexi-corn. The Catalina gives a great flavor - thanks!

This is a great quick and easy salad!  I don't put in the tortilla chips, but i've added olives and sometimes grilled chicken!  yum!  Also I found litehouse has a great jalapeno ranch dressing that gives it a kick (and i think its better than catalina dressing).

Liked this but it is not spicy in the least little bit. Also recipe said to use corn chips so I used Fritos but the above description said to use tortilla chips. Kids wouldn't try it but my husband cleaned the bowl.

Yummy!  Great for those meatless days.  The catalina dressing is what makes it different than anything you've had before.  I used chili beans instead of pinto, corn to replace black beans, tortilla chips to replace corn and 1 head of iceberg lettuce.  Really not as different as original but suits us. Thanks.

I made this using only one change.  I used Ranch dressing instead.  We LOVED this.  I used Spicy Doritos for the chips and added them right before serving.  The doritos gave it just the right spice and made it seem like a mexican salad.  There was only a little bit left and it was not edible because the chips got very soggy.  So I suggest not adding the chips at all to the salad, let everyone add them themselves.  YUMMY!!!

Agree this isn't "spicy", but what a great salad it is!  Very easy.. served at a dinner party and everyone loved it!   I did add red onions.. on the side and I thought it needed them.

I'm not certain why it is called "Spicy" Mexican Salad, as it isn't; however, it is a delicious, simple recipe.  Both my husband and I loved it.  This one is a keeper and will become a regular in our household.

This salad turned out really good.  I used the jalapeno ranch dressing (I found it in the refrigerated section with the lettuce) and it was really good with it. I also left out half of the pinto beans and put in a little extra lettuce to  give it more of a "salad" vibe.  Since other reviewers commented on the chips becoming soggy, I just sprinkled them onto the individual servings to avoid messing up the leftovers. Everyone loved it, it went well with a Mexican-themed meal, and is definitely a keeper.

This recipe has been around for many years.  We used to always make it for parties back in the 70's.  We just called it Catalina Salad.  We didn't have black beans then though; that's a new addition.  I can't imagine it with any other dressing on it.  The Fritos and Catalina dressing are really what makes this dish.  We did add some onion to it too sometimes.  I can see a lot of people are saying they added some browned ground beef.  That seems like a logical addition.  But, don't you just hate it when someone changes 10 things and then has the gall to rate a recipe?  I mean it's not even the same recipe if you change or leave out more than one thing in my opinion.  Changing the dressing on this one is a big no-no to me. At least try it the original way first. Oh well, that's just me.  I'm just glad we have this great website to get good ideas for awesome dishes.  Keeps things fresh and exciting in the kitchen.  Thanks

My mother in law has made a version of this for 30 years but her recipe is slightly different.  Add 1 chopped onion to the salad, grate cheddar cheese, chop 1 slightly ripe avocado and add both with Fritoes and Catalina dressing.  This is the best!

This is one of my favorite "I don't have time to cook" meals. It is so easy to throw together espcially on those busy weekdays. We use ranch beans and what ever lettuce I have on hand.

Great salad! Used head iceburg lettuce- 2 cup cheddar cheese- pinto beans drained- 2 tomatoes- catalina dressing and Crush the Fritos corn chips! We have been eating this for years and kids love it. Its hard to eat if you don't crush the chips.

I thought this was delicious, I took the advise of others and let everyone add the corn chips at the table as they wanted.  The best part is it takes very little salad dressing so its very low fat.  I'm not sure why its called 'spicy', next time I might add a jalapeno peeper to spice it up some.

This salad was very tasty.  I made it for a dinner party I was having and wanted to make a different type salad.  I used block Monterey cheese, cut into small chunks, used garbanzo beans in place of pinto beans, did not use the black beans because I was using them in another dish I was serving, added black olives and sliced red onion, whole cherry tomatoes and hot and spicy fritos (served on the side).  I served ranch dressing and catalina dressing on the side, allowing the guests to choose for themselves.

This was really good and easy. I added ground turkey (cooked w/ taco seasoning), green onion, jalapenos, corn, and dark red kidney beans instead of pinto beans. I only made these changes to use up some stuff I had. I didnt have catalina so instead I made a dressing I found on here called "easy southwestern salad dressing", which consists of ranch dressing and BBQ sauce. It turned out great. Next time I will make sure I have catalina because that is my favorite dressing.

Very tasty and filling.  I did use reduced fat cheese and light dressing to cut the fat and calories.  Also, I served the crushed chips on the side, so the leftovers wouldn't be soggy.

LOVE this recipe!  I make it often when I go to potlucks and everyone usually raves.  I do add Doritos (spicy) rather than tortilla  chips!  Some prefer the Doritos soggy (add before hand) while others prefer them nice and crunchy-  add just before serving!

This is really good. I thought it would be a little boring reading the ingredients, but it turned out really nicely. I used ranch style beans instead of regular pintos. Thanks for sharing this Taseia, this made a quick and easy lunch. I have plenty of leftovers for tomorrow as well.

This salad was excellent, it went well with my Mexican Chicken Recipe. I made a couple of changes, I used pre-shredded Mexican Cheese with taco seasonings added.  I added one other detail to other people's  suggestion of Ranch dressing in the place of Catlina dressing. I used a Spicy Ranch versus regular Ranch. This is a keeper!

Loved it, loved it.  We used Ranch because that’s the kind we like and a reviewer said it was good with Ranch. We put the sauce on our individual plates so we all could choose, as little or as much, as we want.  The same with the corn chips. I will be bringing this salad for lunch often now; I will put the dressing and chips in different containers and toss when I’m ready for lunch.Oh ya forgot to tell you it's not spicy.

Took this one to a potluck and it went over big.  Used only 1/2 bag corn chips and that seemed like more than enough.  This one gets soggy fast, so don't prepare in advance.  I just prepped the ingredients and then tossed when I arrived, adding the chips at the very last.  A very hearty salad.  Add some taco meat and it becomes a worthy main dish.

Wow! EVERYONE in my family of 5 liked this recipe. The only suggestion from a teen was to use a little less Fritos and to crush them. I made homeade Catalina dressing from this website that was fabulous. Great combo of salty and sweet.....who doesn't love that?!

I doubled this recipe for a work potluck lunch and received RAVE reviews. I used Chili Cheese Fritos so the salad actually wasn't spicy at all. It was still very good. I had several requests for the recipe!

I love this recipe! I love that you can add your favorites like olives, onions, tomatoes, etc... and it still tastes great.

This salad is quick to put together, contains a dose of protein, and has great texture with the corn chips.  I will definitely make it again!

I've been looking for a long lost Tex-Mex recipe that I used many years ago.  This is so similar except that my recipe used red & green peppers and red onions but no lettuce.  Also, kidney (chili beans instead of pinto or black beans.  Thanks for jogging my memory.  Just a note -- if you omit the lettuce and replace with the above ingredients, the salad can be made up to a day ahead of time - then just add the corn chips before serving.  VERY yummy!

Very spicy, great taste - wonderful side dish to Mexican lasagna or enchiladas.  I used spicy ranch and crushed up spicy doritos and blue corn chips on top for a little color.  Great presentation and my guests all raved over it.

Just made this for Christmas, but it wasn't a big hit.  It was very easy to make, and it was good, although not in my taste so much.  I didn't get too many opinions on this dish so I'm assuming the family wasn't terribly impressed with it.

Good stuff - overall very popular at my birthday party.  It's a nice side to serving tacos.  I also stuck to ranch since that's a dressing I know we love.

This is a great salad!  I did not use the pinto beans, just the black beans.  The calalina dressing was a great contrast to the rest of the ingredients. I served this salad with Whit's Chicken Enchiladas. Yummo!!Thanks for the recipe!!!

Really awesome!! I made it into dinner by adding taco meat; I also made some additions suggested by others, such as avocado, cilantro and green onions.  I used spicy ranch dressing and left out the pintos.  This is an easy and delicious meal that I will make again.

The only thing we did not like was the Catalina dressing. It was much to sweet. We did like the salad itself. I didn't mix the dressing into the salad so that everyone could use as much as they wanted thank goodness. That saved the meal. We added sour cream and hot sauce, OR ranch dressing. We liked it much better. Thanks for the recipe.

Hubby has made this but made a few changes. Instead of the pinto beans he put in a can of Mexi Corn drained. he used the Mexican cheese blend for the cheeses and used the Chili Cheese Fritos, yummy.

Delicious with some changes - added chopped scallions,  avocado, and fire-roasted corn defrosted under hot water and drained. I used garbanzos and black beans because I didn't have the other beans. No bottled catalina in our stores but I found a recipe for it online that included small amounts of chili powder, smoked paprika, and Worchestershire sauce, so I got some spicy and complex flavors in there. I also cut the sugar in half and may reduce it more the next time - when you cut out added sugar in your diet, it really comes on strong and can be unpleasant in something where you want tangy. We enjoyed this for a meatless dinner.

I have been eating this salad for the past week and it is delicious.  I made 2 modifications by crumbling the spicy chips and also added shredded grilled chicken for more calories.

I made this tonight but I didn't have black beans.  It was still good without them.  I also used homemade Catalina dressing.  Thanks for the recipe.
