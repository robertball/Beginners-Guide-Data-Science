I have tried this recipe twice. Both times I have found that this in no way will make 2 pies. Maybe because I was using a deep dish pastry. The first time I tried it I thought it was way too sweet and too much coconut. I liked the taste of the custard though. So I tried it again and used half the sugar and half of the coconut. I also added a couple tablespoons of butter and it turned out great!
