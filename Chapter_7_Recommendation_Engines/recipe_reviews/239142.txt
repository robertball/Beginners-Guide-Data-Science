Absolutely FANTASTIC!  I used Smoky Spanish Paprika, which gave off a lovely bacon aroma and taste.  I did 5 minutes on the first side and 8 minutes on the second side.  I paired it with my own recipe of mushrooms in a red wine and pear balsamic reduction.  Added some garlic herbed mashed potatoes and everyone was in heaven!  Thanks for a fabulous dish!

Tasty!  I also used smoked paprika.  These have a great flavor.  I added some brown gravy to our meal.  Thanks for the idea!

Whole family (2 adults, 11 year old/4 year old) loved this recipe, it was quick and very easy.  Broiling gave a superb flavor.  I made a brown mushroom gravy and spooned that over them once they were plated at the table.  I will definitely be making this again!

Top to bottom great recipe. The flour and broiling make 'em!  I served with mushroom gravy I made with packet brown and some sauteed mushrooms. Boxed mashed potatoes and canned green beans, and we were in comfort food heaven!

These were very good. Based on other reviews I also used smoked paprika. I didn't have a green pepper so used red instead. I also added at least twice as much of the minced peppers and onions, because those are my favorites. Will make again.
