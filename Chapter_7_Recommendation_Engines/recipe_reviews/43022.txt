I recently saw this recipe on television, and the chef first put waxed paper lining the pie dish and THEN put the pecan mixture on top of that, so the pecans would not stick.  It turned out very well.  I would suggest adding that step to this!  Great recipe though!

I made this recipe or one like it when I once worked at a Deli in our small town - the best way I've found is to line the pan with foil then add the nut mixture, bottom crust, apples, then top crust - if you roll the crust under before crimping the pie won't leak when turned upside down - great recipe!  Easy to make -

This is a great recipe! Easy and very tasty. Very nice on a chilly autumn day. Although, I did do a few alterations. I lined the pie plate with parchment paper, allowing the excess to stand up on the sides. I also put a row of halved pecans around the bottom. I added a about 1/2 cup of white raisins and 1/2 cup of dried cranberries to the apple mixture. After inverting the pie I allowed the pie to cool for about 20 minutes and removed the parchment paper. The wonderful pecan mixture was also on the sides like icing. It was beautiful and the pie plate was completely clean. Finished off with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The family loved it. A new favorite!!!
Thank you.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.You just need to make sure you don't let it cool for too long before turning it a plate or else it sticks.

This pie was good.  I did some changes--(1st) I lined my pie plate with wax paper so the pecan mixture would not stick--(2nd) 1/4 cup of sugar is not enough for Granny Smith apples I used 1 cup sugar & could have used 1/4 cup more. I baked the pie for 1 hour & it was perfect.  Will definitely make this pie again.

Tasted wonderful - nice twist on the traditional apple pie!  I chose to roast the pecans first for about 20 minutes at 300 degrees.  Another note I'll have to remember for next time: If all you have is a deep pie dish, don't make the pie crust edge very high.  If you do, you'll get a depression in the middle of the pie when you flip it over.  If you're concerned about it bubbling over, keep the crust edges on and break them off before you flip over the pie.  I'm glad others posted the wax paper tip!!

YUMMY!!!! I was kinda scared when I took it out of the oven and flipped it over, it didn't look so good, but it turned out great.  I added more sugar to the apples (1/2 cup white, and 1/2 cup brown), 1 tsp of cinnamon, and 1 tsp vanilla extract.  I also used ginger gold apples instead of granny's.  They are tart but not as tart as the grannies.  Thanks for the recipe....

This pie is fantastic.  I had no problems with it sticking to the bottom thanks to the other reviews.   So I lined the 9" pie plate with parchment paper sprayed lightly with cooking spray, then doubled the topping mix which takes the apple pie to a whole new level.  I the used 6 nice sized apple sliced thin and add 1/4 cup sugar and a little lemon juice. Also I did very lightly brush all sides of both pie crust with an egg wash to keep from being soggy.  I baked this in a preheat oven at 375 for only 40 minutes but I would check it at 30 minutes.  To check stick a knife in to check for the right softness of the apples.  Once done let it rest for 5 minutes, turn upside down on plate, wait 2 minutes and slowly peel off the paper.  The top comes out perfect and you will never want to eat a regular apple pie again.   Thank you so much for this great recipe!  P.s. you do want to bake this on a foil lined cookie sheet or you will have a mess to clean up

I made this a day before Thanksgiving and found the crust to be soggy. It was lovely golden brown when I  removed it from the oven. It inverted beautifully...thanks to the parchment paper recommendations! Maybe it needs to be baked longer?

Even the best pie makers in our group loved this recipe.  Because I didn't have a deep dish I used my spring form pan, lined the bottom with waxed paper and added about 10 minutes to the cooking time.  It came out great.

This turned out GREAT!  I used the wax paper as some people mentioned and it helped alot when flipping the pie over. Advice; Do not wait too long to flip the pie, when the sugars start to cool, they become very sticky and do not want to leave the pan, or wax paper.

I have been making Pies since I was high enough to reach to kitchen counter, taught by my great-grandmother (along time without telling my age!) and friends and family tell me that I am tops at piemaking...that being said.
This "PIE' was very good.  I loved the addition of the nuts, which gave the pie a 'cinnamon roll" taste, coupled with the loveliness of the apples. Lining the pieplate with 'non-stick foil' was a very good idea from another review...keeping the pie from sticking and protecting the crust from burning.
After comparing back to back with a regular Apple Pie,,,my husband and I agree that you trade in the wonderful flakiness of the crust of the traditional pie, for the nut topping.  both delicious...but we vote for the Crust of a traditional Pie.  Will certainly make again for something out of the ordinary.

OMG!! This is Soooo good and easy and very cool looking! Looks like a big sticky bun!  I used parchment paper as advised by others. We would give this 10 stars if we could! I added a t. of cinnamon to the nuts and a t. of vanilla to the apples. I was afraid that my flip would be a flop but not bad at all. This will be my new Thanksgiving dessert. Thanks for the really good recipe! My Boy friend loves apple stuff and he loves this this!

The pecan mixture on bottom makes it stick to pie plate. It is good, but will make it w/ the pecan mixture on top next time!

This is GREAT!  What a pleasant extra to apple pie!  I "cut" time and calories by using store bought pastry crust and a no-sugar pie filling.  It was beautiful and great.  My husband gave it a solid "10", vowing to prefer this for thanksgiving over the standard regular apple or pecan pie!

This is the best apple pie I have ever had.  And it is so easy to make.  I made one on Sunday and then another on Tuesday to carry to my parents.  Everyone loves it.  I used wax paper with mine as previous others mentioned.

This pie got great reviews by all of the traditional Apple-Pie lovers here.  I used pecan 1/2s and placed them in a decorative pattern instead~everyone thought it came from a bakery.  Great taste and beautiful presentation! (Also, appreciated the parchment paper advise- thanks.)

made it as my first apple pie ever today and it was a huuuge hit. used 1 cup of sugar instead of 1/4,  with about 7 granny smiths. also added 1 tsp. vanilla to apple mixture. definitely use wax paper so the pecans don't stick. some of the crust around the edges fell off when i flipped it but oh well! not the best looking pie but it's very delicious!!! baked for 50 mins and was perfect.

This was good-I didn't think it was too flavorful, but it was probably because I did not use the granny smith as I didn't have any on hand. I used gala which have much less "bite" to them. I will try again with the granny smith and see if I like it better. Maybe it needed more spices-who knows?
I did use the wax paper trick and it came out looking beautiful-loved the topping. Great warm with vanilla ice cream or homemeade whipped cream.
My family loved it and my daughter had lots of fun helping me make it. I did make my own pie crust which is a must for any pie, in my opinion. I will try again and update my review.

This is by far the best pie ever.  Perfect for families that fight between apple pie and pecan pie!

Oh my.....Just the best!  Have made this pie twice this week!  The only change I made was using 3 fresh apples and 1 can of apple pie filling.  I only had 3 apples.  First pie was gone in a day!  Also, very easy and looks wonderful.

I would like to give this recipe 5 stars but because I altered it I don't feel I should.  First, I lined the pan with foil and buttered the bottom and sides using the one tablespoon asked for in the recipe.  I then completely lined the bottom with pecan halves (rounded side down).  I mixed the brown sugar and butter and dropped it on TOP of the pecans.  From there I pretty much followed the recipe except I mixed the brown sugar/flour right into the apples rather than layering it.  Oh, I also used Macoun apples because that's what I had.  I folded the excess foil up around the pie to prevent excess browning.  When it came out of the oven, I flipped it within 5 minutes into a slightly rounded plate (to accommodate the rounded top- well I guess it is the bottom now!).  I served this at Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  So basically a good recipe that needed a little tweaking.

Excellent! I used 7 cups of McIntosh apples, not of fan of the tartness of Granny Smith, and 3Tbs. Flour and 6 Tbs Sugar in apples.  Lined pie plate with parchment paper and flipped in 5 minutes as called for in recipe. Everyone at the party loved it.  My new apple pie recipes.

I used parchment on the bottom and I changed the sugar to 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup of packed brown sugar to mix with apples.  I also added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla to apple mixture.  I actually cut the pecan mixture in half the second time and it wasn't as overpowering to the pie as a whole and I finely chopped the pecans.  The whole ones just didn't spread enough throughout the pie.  I only cooked 40 mins.  Any longer and the bottom pecan mixture will burn slightly and change the taste a bit.  My granny smiths seemed extra juicy so I also added another tablespoon of flour to keep it from being too watery.  We loved this pie and will definitely make it again and again and again.  Enjoy!

I make this pie for every special occasion. I spread the softened butter in the pie pan, press the brown sugar into the butter and sprinkle the pecans over the sugar. I have never had a problem turning the pie onto a serving platter, but I do it as soon as it comes from the oven.

I Followed the recipe as is.  It was “ok”.    The top crust was a bit soggy after turning it upside down and the pecan mixture made the bottom soggy.  I baked it in a ceramic deep dish pie pan for the full 50 minutes.   Would not make it again.

This was OK as written. Unfortunately, the act of flipping a hot pie onto a plate renders a soggy crust after the pie has cooled.

Well done recipe! The only change which I really didn't notice to much was that I cut in a third of a cup of butter with the shortening. Overall, I received awesome compliments on this pie! Will make again.

I took the advice of other reviews and added 3/4 cup of sugar to the pie mixture. And since I didn't have a deep dish pie pan or parchment paper I lined a 9 inch spring form pan with wax paper. It turned out great. This is definitely a do over.

This made a really great pie!  I loved the pecan "topping" that ended up drizzled over the pie. The use of Granny Smith's wouldn't be my choice next time though - I might use my "typical" blend of apples next time.

I just made this as a test run to see if it was good enough to be served at Thanksgiving. I'm not a huge apple or pecan pie fan, so I wasn't expecting much.  This was the best apple/pecan pie I've ever had. I think I ate half the pie myself. I can't wait till Thanksgiving to make it again!!
