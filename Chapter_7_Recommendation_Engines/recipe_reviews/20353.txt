I used dried cherries instead of raisins, just because I had them on hand. Also added the 2 TB of lemon juice, as suggested by the other reviewers. The apple-cherry filling was very good, especially when warm from the oven, but we didn't care for the crust. Next time I'll use my usual pie crust.

This pie is now my families favorite kind of apple pie.  My husband usually doesn't care for apple pie and he was skeptical, but he LOVED this one!
I cheated a bit and bought some ready made pie crust.  I did not line the pie pan with foil.  This step didn't make sense to me.

I added the 2 T of lemon juice over the top of the apples before adding the sugar mixture to toss. I only baked for about 45 minutes because the crust was more than done and the apples were getting overly brown. I let the pie cool and then drizzled with the icing. Upon cutting, the filling was runny and, with the addition of the icing, it was very, very sweet. We ate it on ice cream and the kids loved it but it was too sweet for my husband (an apple pie lover)and I. I will stick to a more traditional recipe next time.

Wow! Made this yesterday, and it's a nice change from the basic apple pie. I did add a top layer of crust and brushed it with milk. The glaze came out nicely on top of the crust.
