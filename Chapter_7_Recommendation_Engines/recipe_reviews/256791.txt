Comfort food in a dip. Creamy  flavorful dip, or meat topping. If you like gravy fries, you will love this on top of your fries. A keeper for me for sure.

We liked this recipe. It reminded me of Poutine a little which I LOVE! I served with Tater Tots. YUM!

This was good even though it might be a bit soupy for a dip.  I did let it cool off a bit and it firmed up but it was still fairly liquid-y.  I was dipping with crackers, however, so if you used something more absorbent, like bread, it's fabulous (or pour it over french fries - yum!)  It was super easy, which is always nice, too.  I used just the normal baby portobellos since that's what I usually keep in the fridge but it would be great to change it up, especially when the more unique varieties of mushrooms are on sale.  I did broil this for a bit after I baked it to get the cheese nice and brown on top.  If I make this again, I'm definitely going to find some crusty bread to soak up all the goodness!

WOW! This was absolutely amazing! I couldn't get enough and neither could my co-workers. By the end of lunch we decided to make it for Steak or chicken topping. Rice, pasta, etc. This could just about go on anything.  Will definitely make again. I was blessed to find the exact mix of mushrooms packaged together at my local grocery store.  Well worth it. I suggest making double if you got any more than a handful of people around
