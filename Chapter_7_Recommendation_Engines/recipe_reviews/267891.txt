Be careful when you add the green beans to the hot oil and sesame seeds. I had sesame seeds all over my cooktop. If I make this again, I'll omit the sesame seeds. They don't add much.

Simple and straight forward and the perfect side dish to a meal. I do feel the sesame seeds were out of place in this and I will omit them next time.
