Great taste!  I doubled the recipe.  I separated the veggies from the liquid in a strainer.  Then used half the liquid (in the food processor) to puree the veggies.  I used the food processor again to mix the rest of the liquid with the flour and cheese.  The added the cheese mix to the veggies, then the beer.  Husband went back for seconds...

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Instead of the shredded cheese, I use Cheese Whiz - which makes it really creamy.  Thanks for sharing!

PERFECT! and simple to make. Budweiser makes it. Would not change a thing. I used extra sharp cheddar which I really thought gave it that "super cheesey" taste I was looking for. Can't wait to make this one again.

A good version of beer and cheese soup. I added garlic to the mix, and I also added some pieces of cooked bacon to the soup before serving. Always a hit.

Great recipe!  Remember to use a regular(not light)beer if you want a stronger beer flavor.

I'm vegetarian, so I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I didn't have dijon mustard, so we substituted regular. It was delicious!

Great recipe! I added a bit more dijon mustard and a bit of freshly ground pepper in the final stages and it turned out great. Also, I used a can of Coors Light and it tasted fine to me. Thanks for sharing!!!

Pretty good! I'd suggest using 2 cans of broth and a whole beer and then adjusting thickness with the remaining broth if you want more beer flavor and a thicker soup. This recipe can be made gluten free if you have gluten free broth, beer, and flour. When I made it GF, I had to add cornstarch, too, because the GF flour didn't quite do the job.

Nice light tasting soup!  I wish it were a little thicker, but I couldn't NOT use a full can of beer - that'd just be . . wrong.  Used just 1 Tbsp butter to saute all the veggies and it worked just fine.  Also, pureeing the entire soup made a wonderfully consistent tasting/textured soup!

Wow I followed this recipe to a T and we were disappointed. Maybe it's because I used a Bock beer (Shiner) but the cheese almost seemed to curdle when I poured in the beer. The flavor was just not there, rather sour. I will be looking for a new recipe, if I feel like experimenting I may play with this recipe a bit, but I'm definitely not impressed with the base recipe.

this was an average cheese soup, made exactly as written, salt and peper to taste.  Seems it was missing a pop, of richness, but it was eaten by all.  Might make again, but will keep looking for a better cheese soup

This was fantastic! I've been looking for a really good beer cheese soup for a long time. I only gave 4 stars because I made a couple changes. With my changes it's 5. I added a little kosher salt & black pepper while cooking the veggies, and about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder before adding the cheese. Will definitely make again and again!

I've made this many times over and it's always good.  I added cubed potato and sliced kielbasa and did not puree any of the vegetables. LOVE IT.

I used half sharp white Cheddar and half medium yellow Cheddar.  It was a bit bland, so next time I would use all sharp Cheddar and maybe add a bit more mustard and maybe some garlic.  Used about 8 oz. of Bass Ale, which was plenty of beer flavor for most of us.

I doubled the veggies. used veggie broth, jalapeno cheese. I blended the veggies before adding the cheese. The cheese looked weird-sort of curdled looking, or maybe it was the flour mixed in with the cheese, so I blended it a second time. good flavor.

This might have been good with a different beer, I don't know, but everyone said to use a dark beer and the only dark beer I had was an imperial stout.  Do NOT make that mistake.

Great base! I made this recipe when we were snowed in so I had to substitute a few ingredients and added chopped chicken breast, sliced fresh/soaked jalapenos, and a cup of cooked rice! Will certainly make again!

As written this recipe is 2 stars.  I had to do a lot of doctoring to make it good including adding garlic, adding Velveeta, doubling the amount of cheddar cheese, and using corn starch to thicken the soup up.  It’s an okay recipe but I will try another one next time with better flavor.

Made this recipe this evening. It makes a big pot of soup and I only had maybe enough for one bowl for lunch tomorrow left over. I did read all the reviews and made some of the changes suggested. I had heaping measuring cups of vegetables (heck a little more has got to be good). I think I ended up with about a tablespoon + of the Dijon mustard, maybe 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper, a bottle of Coors light, and a couple of extra tablespoons of flour mixed with water to make it a little thicker. I was going to add some Worcestershire sauce but got talking and forgot! The soup was a hit and both ladies asked for the recipe. Next time I think I'll add a few ounces of sour cream or heavy cream to increase the body. Almost forgot... I used Sharp cheddar for the extra flavor and made up some crunch bacon bits to sprinkle on top! Yummy!!

I changed this recipe a little bit.  My roommates don't like onions and I do not have a processesor or any way to puree the vegetables in this recipe.  So instead, I used a can of french onion soup.  I also used to bags of cheese (Chedder and Colby&Monteray Jack).  I also chicken and a touch of sugar.  Roommates loved this.  I served it with flat bred.

The taste in this recipe wasn't what we were looking for.  The cheese, beer and mustard didn't blend well together at all.  I used a good quality sharp cheddar and a Full Sail Pilsner beer, following the recipe to a T.  The combo of the sharp cheese and beer (we love both separately) was overpoweringly bitter.  After tasting I added about 4 oz of Velveeta cheese to try and salvage it.   My son in law liked it (but he likes anything homemade), my wife said it was ok but she did not want it again and I thought it was horrible.  If I would try this again, I would use a combo of cheeses and a very light beer.

OK, I'll be honest, I did a little bit of tweaking which I typically don't do on a new recipe.  Used 2% Kraft® Extra-Sharp Cheddar Cheese (and added a little more than recipe called for), used only 1/2 can of IPA beer (thought a full can would have overpowered), a good shake of cayenne, salt and pepper.  Even though I used less beer and more cheese, the consistency still was a little on the thin side (I could have made a slurry and thickened it more), but that was OK with me because the flavor was where I wanted it.  I think the success of this soup is dependent upon 3 things:  using a high-quality chicken broth (my favorite is Kitchen Basics or, of course, homemade), flavorful cheese, and a good-quality beer.  With the changes mentioned above, I thought this was 5 stars.  Thanks, Marlee, for sharing your recipe.

This was an OK recipe.  I used cheez whiz like many others, I thought it was just very flat.  I tweaked it with some Worcestershire and that woke it up some then I threw in a bit of ground cayenne pepper, that did the trick!!  Now I want to retool the recipe using cornstarch as a thickener instead of all that BAD white flour...wish me luck!

Great, easy recipe.  I cut back a little on the veggies, but otherwise follow as directed.  Great taste & consistency.  Serve with white popcorn on top.

Great basic beer cheese recipe.  We lacked 8 oz of chedder cheese so we used 4 oz chedder and 4 oz pepper jack- which gave it a lite kick.  I had to add more flour.  Used Pabst for the beer- which I scared about and it still turned out great but only added 6 oz of PBR.
