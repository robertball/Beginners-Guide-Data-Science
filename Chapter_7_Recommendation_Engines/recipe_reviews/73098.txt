I made this for a picnic we're attending tomorrow but it looks a little bland.  Think I'll add some grape tomatoes and black olives for more color.  Also a little more mayonnaise and parmesean cheese.  We'll see how it goes over!

I used more dijon (about a tbsp more), white wine vinegar (didn't have any red) and fresh garlic instead of powder. Also, I added a couple of diced mission figs for a touch of sweetness.   I used rotini pasta instead of penne. I'm not entirely sure whether this is supposed to be served hot or cold...i served it room temp.   I used probably about 4 tbsp of mayo and a 1/2 cup of Parm.  This dish was okay. Nice to try but no one is clamoring for more. I can see taking it to a BBQ...but I'd probably come home with some.

Very simple, yet good. I made it with whole wheat pasta and threw in some colored peppers and zuccini too.

I had to add more dijon mustard for flavor, but other than that, this is a delicious recipe.

I used about another teaspoon of dijon, subbed red pepper for green pepper and doubled the mayo and parmesan.  For us, this just didn't work.  The onion needed to be cooked more so it would mellow, and I think it should have been a red onion.  Didn't have a lot of flavor - we probably won't be having again.

I thought this was very good, although I did make a few alterations due to food allergies and what I had. I used Quinoa elbow noodles, ume plum vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, and I only had one red pepper, one onion, and 2 chopped up carrots for veggies. I am sure I will make it again.

I added capers, along with the suggestion from others to increase the mustard and use fresh garlic.  They really gave it the kick it needed.
