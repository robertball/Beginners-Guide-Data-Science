Unlike some of the other pumpkin bar recipes on this site,  especially  the one that seems to be the most popular, this recipe requires no changes to make it right. This review then, is based on the recipe exactly as written and I found it perfect.  Actually, I noticed a lot of the changes made on the higher rated bar are those that are already a part of this recipe! I did make my own frosting, as I wanted to use the entire package of cream cheese, although I'm sure the frosting included here is good too. These are moist, but not soggy.  Evenly and pleasantly spiced, enough to be noticeable but not so much to mask the pumpkin flavor. I personally would prefer these with a handful of raisins and nuts added, but that's just an easily remedied personal preference. This recipe is perfect as it stands.  So save yourself the trouble of reading through hundreds of reviews describing changes that were made in other pumpkin bar recipes to ultimately come up with this recipe.

This recipe is good but it's not a brownie, it's a cake.  I also doubled the spices. I had to adjust the icing too.  I ended up using a whole 8oz of cream cheese and a full stick if butter.  With those adjustments this was a wonder CAKE! The whole family loved it.

This cake notice I say cake has very good flavor, but it is definatley not a brownie. I did not have pumpkin pie spice so I mix 1/2 t nutmeg, 1/2 t cloves, 1/2 t ginger and 1 t cinnamon in addition to the 2 t cinnamon already called for. Also the icing is just ok. I would make this very moist cake again, but I would use different icing.

I must agree with the other reviewers, they were not really brownies, it was a pumpkin cake. The taste really is wonderful, but if you're looking for pumpkin brownies, this is not the recipe; however, I will absolutely make it again, but I will serve it as a cake. I will probably make it in a 9x13 so the slices are nice and thick. It would be wonderful with raisins and walnuts!

Brownies, Cake, Bar, etc.. Whatever you call this, it is a wonderful recipe! Perfectly spiced, allowing the pumpkin to shine. Moist, but not heavy or dense and rich, but not overly sweet. Just perfect as written. I don't have a 15"x10"x1" but did find a 15.25" x 10.25x .75" and used that plus I got 24 mini cupcakes. I doubled the frosting, using 8 oz of cream cheese instead of 6 oz (just to use the entire package) and it is a perfect match. Again, not overly sweet. Kids and hubby all loved these and we will enjoy them often this fall and over the Holidays. Thanks for sharing!!

A delicious pumpkin cake that tastes great without frosting.  We ate this plain and also with a little whipped cream on top, just like you might eat a slice of pumpkin pie.  If I were to frost it, I would probably use the recipe for Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting (but use all vanilla, no almond extract) which has reduced-fat cream cheese and heavy cream instead of butter.  I think whipped cream and pumpkin make a great pairing that isn't too sweet.  This recipe lets the pumpkin flavor predominate...some have commented that they would add extra spices, and while I can see that would be good also, you really don't need to make that adjustment if you like pumpkin cake vs pumpkin spice cake.   I will be making these again soon.

These "brownies" are very good, but it's more like a cake than a brownie.  I had to bake it about 20-25 minutes longer than it calls for.  I would definitely make it again since it is very tasty.  The frosting is very good.

This recipe as everyone else says is more like a cake.  I had to bake it an additional 15 minutes but that could be do in part to me using a 13 x 9 pan instead of what was called for.  I keep having an issue with it where it sinks in the middle while it's cooling as well.  Still tastes good though and is very moist. I think it also needs double the frosting.  The first time I made it it seemed like an awfully thin layer of it.

Here's the thing; the finished product from this recipe  is not exactly what I was looking for when I began preparing it.  I was anticipating a brownie, but what resulted was cake.  Perfect cake.  Perfectly moist, perfectly light, perfectly pumpkiny.  This is no exaggeration.  The others in the household remarked same.  Now, I understand that there are some that would remove a star for this, errr, identity conflict, but I cannot add myself to that camp and be comfortable.  Why not?  Because, all in all, brownie, cake, whatever you want to call it, it happens to be some of the BEST cake I've EVER had in my life!  Who cares if it has an identity crisis?  Bake it, call it whatever you want!!  Remarkable!  Thank you!!

Excellent! I prepared the recipe as written and used the frosting as well. The batter is wet, smooth and comes together nicely. Since I did not have a 15 x 10 x 1 inch pan, I used a 9x 13 pan. A sweet pumpkin-y scent emanated from the oven as the brownies baked up. They were done in 30 minutes and took about an hour to completely cool. This is actually more like a cake instead of a brownie but a perfectly moist cake, not heavy or dense at all. It has a very good flavor and is wonderfully spiced letting the pumpkin stand out. I used the entire 8 oz. of cream cheese instead of just 6 oz. It turns out the thin layer of frosting was just enough to cover the 9x 13 pan of brownies. The cream cheese frosting is tasty, lightly sweetened but not overly sweet. I had 15 nice thick slices of brownies. I also dusted the top of the frosting with a little cinnamon for visual appeal. If I were to make this again I would add raisins and nuts and maybe double the frosting. Perfect for the Holidays. Thanks for sharing.

Wonderful.  I was a bit skeptical about this at first, but I love them.  I am planning to bring these to my family Thanksgiving tomorrow.  Now I am making another batch to take to my boyfriend's family as well.  These have a nice mild flavor to them and then the frosting is just the right amount of sweetness.  Great recipe!

More like a dense cake than a brownie. So moist and rich. I will double the Pumpkin Spice next time and use a thicker cream cheese frosting, maybe sprinkle with a little cinnamon. My family has requested this for Thanksgiving!

These taste good but have a texture more consistent with cake than brownies. I may try making it with less leavening.

This is a fantastic, moist cake mix. I used it to make 30+ cupcakes. Please note: (1) I added 1 tbs more of pumpkin spice; the batter just didn't have quite enough flavor (other than pumpkin) for my liking (2) as others have noted, it did require nearly 30 minutes to bake per batch. It was well worth it. I have had nothing but compliments and many people have requested I make them again. I made them for a work function.

More of a cake than brownie but really good. My 15 year old(the baker of the family)made these and they are great!! She didn't put icing on all of it I personally think it is better without icing and goes great w/ coffee(my pumpkin latte I am having right now). Very moist and light. She did add a bit more spice than what it called for and doubled the cream cheese in the icing recipe.

It is true that this is more like a cake then brownies but after making this and tasting it I still give it 5 stars. I have never left a recipe as is before but this one is a winner. I might add dried cranberries and chopped walnuts in the future to add more to my taste but seriously, this recipe is perfect as it is written. My husband ate almost all of this by himself and always ask when am I going to make it again. I am actually making this for a birthday party this weekend. Try this recipe, you will love it!

I didn't read this before, but this is a CAKE recipe!! I tried to make it to take to a friend's party (as brownies), but ended up just keeping it for myself.  It really is delicious...though the title is a little misleading :)

These are very good, made into cupcakes. Not quite as dense as a brownie, but moister and slightly heavier than cake. Used ginger and nutmeg in place of pumpkin pie spice.

I made these using the Wilton silicone bite-size brownie pan.  They were amazing!!!!  The recipe made 8 doz bite-size brownies.  I made the frosting with 8 oz cream cheese, 1 stick margarine, 4 cup confectioner's sugar, 1 t vanilla, and about 1 1/2 t pumpkin pie spice - I put it in a frosting bag with a large star tip and piped it on each brownie bite.  I made these for our kindergarten Thanksgiving Feast - the kids loved them but the teachers at my school really loved them. Several are making them for Thanksgiving.  GREAT recipe!!!

These are amazing! I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned, and they were just the right consistency.  The cream cheese frosting was delicious on them as well.

While I will admit that this recipe isn't my taste I give this five stars.  Just like the other reviewers I also agree that this is not a brownie and is, in fact, a cake.  The flavoring was wonderful and it was a nice texture.  I couldn't taste much pumpkin but I'm not sure how much pumpkin you should taste in pumpkin cake as I've never had it before.  I didn't have pumpkin spice on hand so I used just under 1/2 tsp cloves and nutmeg, just under 1/4 tsp mace and allspice, 1/2 tsp ginger, and an extra tsp of cinnamon.  Also, instead of the 2 cups of sugar I used 1 1/2 c. sugar and 1/2 packed brown sugar in hopes of giving the cake a more full flavor.  I also experimented a bit by adding a rounded 1/2 c. bittersweet chocolate chips to half of the cake (so I could see how it tastes with and without) and I found it added a bit of a twist to it but it neither enhanced the flavor or detracted from it.  Since I didn't have a 10x14 pan I used a 9x13 glass pan and baked it for thirty minutes, rotating it halfway through.  I also did not use your frosting - I just dusted some powdered sugar and I thought it was alright that way.  All around a nice recipe; despite it not being what I would go for I'll most likely make this again sometime.  :)

This recipe is very delicious, excellently spiced, and great for the season. The only reason I gave it four stars is because it does come out as a cake, not a chewy brownie like I was expecting. However, the cream cheese frosting recipe is excellent. I will definitely make this again - when I want pumpkin cake.

These are divine!  Made mine as cupcakes rather than in a brownie pan.  May have to leave the house to keep from eating any more!   Thanks for sharing.
