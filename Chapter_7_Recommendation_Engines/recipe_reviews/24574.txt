I used to make this recipe for every special occasion and somehow lost it.  Was I ecstatic to see it posted in "allrecipes"!  These rolls are the best.

When slicing the logs into individual rolls, use dental floss instead of a knife.  The rolls don't get squashed and the cut is cleaner and easier.  Use about 18".  Put the floss under the roll.  Holding each end of the floss, bring them up criss-cross over the log and pull in opposite directions.  Kinda like a tonsillectomy, I'm told!  Hope others find this way helpful.

This recipe is fabulous!  I must admit, I usually take the lazy route, and use frozen bread dough.  I use this recipe only for the caramel.  I've used many other caramel recipes, and ended up with really sticky/chewy caramel.  This recipe produces perfect caramel.  Make certain you do not boil the caramel, or else the caramel mixture will harden!  Do as the recipe says, and stir in the corn syrup after the mixture has been taken off the heat source.

I was really surprised at how easy this recipe was to make. I read the reviews and noticed a couple said it needed less butter, so I skipped putting the butter on the rolled out dough. Next time I'll make it exactly as directed. Also, I made my rolls in 3 round pans, and did only one with pecan halves because so many in our family say they don't like nuts, next time I'm going to make them all with the nuts, everyone grabbed for those first and it seemed to protect the rolls from browning too much. I also used parchment paper in the bottem of my pans because someone suggested it was hard to clean, but I think if you just pop the pans right into water for a few minutes after removing the rolls, you won't have any problems with cleanup. Great recipe, thanks Andrea.

OH. MY. GOD! These just came out of the oven and we are all going CRAZY for them!!! I halved the amount of dough, but kept the full amount of filling and bottom stuff. I also added 1/2 a cup of toasted chopped pecans into the filling. I learned a great technique to make a warm area for the dough to rise: I put the dough and a coffee mug of freshly boiled water into the microwave (don't turn it on). The hot water makes the inside of the microwave the perfect tempertature and humidity for the dough to rise perfectly! I didn't wait overnight, I just let them rise a second time for 30 minutes in the micro again and then baked right away. Mine only took 25 minutes in the oven. EXCELLENT!!!

I grew up with a recipe that is similar to this one, except it had Rhodes Rolls and butterscotch pudding for the topping. BUT, I wanted to go from scratch and when I saw this I knew that it just might work! Here is how I changed it to be like the one I grew up with...

I made the dough as specified but instead of rolling it out I stopped. I lightly greased two bundt pans, put finely chopped pecans and a handful of coconut in the bottom. Then I made the caramel sauce and put that on top of that. Then I took the dough and divided it as specified and made little balls and put that on top of the sauce. Then I followed the directions after that... covering, putting in fridge and baking in the morning, instantly flipping it out to let the sauce cover that rolls. 
It is beautiful and tasty!

This is the best dough recipe for a cinnamon roll that I've tried.  I used my bread machine and the dough turned out perfect.  The topping was very good but I added a cream cheese frosting that really made the roll.  The "Easiness Rating" really drops the overall rating.  Rolled baked goods are never easy, and this one is no exception.  It is just good messy fun.

I tried these months ago...changed a few things, instead of the carmel glaze I spread it on the rolled dough, add cinnamon - roll in log & cut.
It made my pans impossible to clean almost before.
HOLIDAYS????  I make AT LEAST 2 double batches a week!!!!!
Our small school teachers buy them to start out their Mondays, they are a great "Welcome New Neighbor" suprise, and as my revolving door with my 2 teenagers & friends....
Well, there is not one in there for ME today w/ coffee!
I do a powdered sugar glaze / milk / maple flavoring - just drizzle across....
No one has ever turned one down - or left crumbs!!!

I have been looking for a great roll recipe for the longest time.  I was a bit 
hesitant to try something from on line, but I gave it a shot and it turned 
out beautiful! I was a little crunched on time so the fridge time was not exactly
the recomended, but they still worked, just like in the bakery, and I do mean 
these girls were huge!  Try it for you family and I promise they will be asking 
for seconds.

I tried this recipe for the first time yesterday, made for a gathering for the "girls" Christmas party.  Seventeen accomplished cooks and bakers raved over these and requested the recipe!  I made a double batch (four dozen), and made a couple changes. One inadvertent one was that I used cornstarch instead of baking powder by accident (the red Rumford cans look the same!). It didn't seem to hurt the finished product one bit, though.  I also doubled the amount of the caramel for each recipe at the suggestion of others here, and was glad I did. It was just the right amount and wouldn't have been enough if I hadn't doubled it.  Also, I generously slathered the dough with a "cinnamon butter" made with the cinnamon, butter and BROWN sugar instead of the white. The cinnamon I used was 2 percent oil, too, so had a nice strong cinnamon presence. Combing the three ingredients was easier.  As to the pan cleaning? Use disposable medium-weight foil pans sprayed with Pam. The rolls slip right out when inverted (leave the pan on for a few minutes to allow all the caramel to run over rolls) and the pan gets crumpled up and tossed away!  I'm going to make them again for Christmas morning. Great recipe!

These were awesome! I rolled and sliced the dough pretty thin and it made 5 cake pans full (around 9 rolls each). (I used disposable foil pans for easy cleanup.) I let one pan rise for about 30 minutes and baked it right away; the other pans I froze in gallon ziplocs, thawed in the fridge overnight, and baked per the recipe. Relatively easy and SOOOOO good!! These are a keeper for sure.

These were ok.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I baked the rolls about 25 minutes and that was too long.  They were overcooked and dry, so that is the first thing to watch for.  I also didn't think there was enough caramel topping and that it wasn't thick enough.  If I make these again, I'd probably double the topping and make it thicker with more brown sugar/butter ratio.

Great, but a lot of work. The main change I would recommend is to double the caramel and put a lot of pecans in. Using the original amounts, everyone agreed it needed more caramel & pecan. The bread ends up rising a lot, so the caramel to bread ratio is off. I'd also make it in a glass lasagna pan so as much 
of the bread touches the caramel as possible.

I made another batch of caramel using 1/2 cup butter and 1.25 cups light brown sugar, so an extra 1/4 cup to balance out the butter.

Another tip: DON'T BOIL THE CARAMEL. I boiled the caramel a bit before reading the tip that the caramel hardens if you boil it.

Another tip: If you're too lazy to make the log and rolls, you can go with a monkey bread approach. Break the dough up into truffle-size balls, roll in a bowl of cinnamon & sugar, and add to glass lasagna pan. 
Another tip: I realize the caramel is buttery, but I'd add some melted butter over the bread, or in between the monkey bread balls.

All I can say is OMGawsh! My friend came over last night and we made them together. She took home a pan and I kept one. Next time I'm not sharing. LOL We doubled the topping (except pecans) and chopped up the pecans instead of doing pecan halves. I let the bread machine do the mixing and we used dental floss to cut the rolls so it was really a pretty easy recipe. We'll be making this one again and again and again and...

Fabulous recipe.  These were so, so good.  Make sure to have a big glass of milk when you eat these.  My 3 year old son said in between bites, 'these are excellent mommy!'  Now that's a compliment!!

I love this recipe! I have made them twice.  The first time I took them to work and the second time I let my husband take them to his.  Everyone raved about how good they were and still ask when I am going to make them again.  I didn't bother with letting them rise in the morning. They went straight from the fridge to the pre-heated oven and they turned out fine.

These are quite good but could be great with a couple changes.  First double the caramel sauce.  The rolls do not have enough caramel topping.  Second double the butter in the filling, change the white sugar to brown and double it.  Reduce the cinnamon in half so it doesn't overpower the caramel. The taste was good, the pecans crisp, the caramel flavor good.  But with the stated changes these would be exceptional!

I wanted to make something special for Christmas morning and these were the perfect treat! I read the reviews ahead of time and decided to cut the recipe in half but use the same amount of caramel and nuts. That was perfect and I can't imagine these any other way! I had never made any kind of bread or roll from scratch before but these directions were easy to follow and turned out great. I also loved that I could do everything the night before. My only mistake was baking about 5 minutes too long. The tops were a lovely golden brown but I didn't realize the sides, which were touching the pan, baked more quickly and got a little overdone. Next time I will pull them out of the oven a little sooner. There *will* be a next time!

I cut this in half, but should have left the topping the full amount.  There wasn't enough to even cover the bottom of the pan.  I was thinking that it would spread and cover while baking, but it was almost all absorbed by the rolls after baking.  I fixed the problem by making some more and pouring it over the rolls.  I added the nuts after because my kids don't like them, but my husband and I do.  I do really like this dough.  It was easy to work with and rose very well in the fridge overnight.  Just need to make more topping.

I've not even made this recipe yet, but I know that it will be perfect.  I'm writing to prevent any of you from following the advice by the first reviewer to go to the store and buy the canned cinnamon rolls.  There is NO substitute for scratch v. canned rolls or those horrible sliced cookies.  If you're going to buy something, go to the bakery for THAT is the only equivalent.


06/18/11...Review Update:  I have made this recipe several times since writing my admonishment to NOT use a canned replacement.  This recipe is outstanding.  I have made these and given it to neighbor's so that they will have them for Christmas morning.

These are good, convenient and easy to make.  I love the convenience of making them the night before.  My family thought they were a bit dry.  The next time I make them, I will either double the caramel topping or make another batch of it to pour right before serving.

This was amazing!!!!!!! I have made 2 batches in the last week.  The first batch was the original recipe and it was so good I had to make a second batch but with a twist --- my better half like oranges rolls, so I made the core recipe but omit the carmel sauce and pecans....grease the pan place the rolls in and let them sit overnight, then in the morning I baked the rolls as directed and then when I took them out of the oven ---just frost---- i used a frosting of 1 1/2 Cups of powder sugar, 2 tablespoons of Orange Juice and orange zest to liking......yum!

Great recipe - I didn't make the dough from scratch - but instead used frozen bread dough - worked great!

These were very easy to make.  I halved the dough recipe but used the same amount of caramel pecan mixture and it was perfect.  The family loved them.

Made these rolls for Christmas morning. They turned out great. I would have given the recipe a 5 star rating, but like other reviewers, I found I had to double the caramel topping. Other than that, the rolls were excellent and I will be making them again soon.

Wow.  These were so delicious.  Never made caramel before and it seemed grainy so I kept it on the heat a little longer and beat it with a whisk until silky smooth.  It was perfect. 1 batch of caramel per 9x13 pan and I chopped the pecans a little.  The next morning I put them in a warm place for 30 mins but they definitely weren't close to being doubled, put them in the oven anyway and man those suckers puffed up HUGE. Inverted pan onto parchment paper lined baking sheet and immediately ran hot water in the 9x13 for easy clean up.  Great Christmas morning breakfast and pretty tasty cold too.

Personally they needed more caramel on them. So next time I will double  that. Also, the dough wasn't much of a sweet roll dough. I have a better dough that I will use. They were still goood though

These Rolls were the best!  I did double the caramel and was glad i did or else there wouldn't have been enough caramel for my family.  I also cut the rolls a bit smaller to get more... friends and family loved em.  They were perfect for our early morning staurday garage sales :)

These rolls turned out great! We loved them. One problem, I had the dough in the bread maker and it was so gooey...I ended up taking it out and kneading it and adding lots more flour. I'm not sure if I made a mistake in the ingredients, or what. I liked the way these rolls turned out in the end. And being able to cook them the following morning...but did I do something wrong that made them so gooey?

This is for "Sometime Cook".  More caramel is great, but be sure to add at least 1 tablespoon of flour to your sugar mixture.  This will help make it thicker, and also it won't get hard.  Your are not going to eat all of these rolls while they are warm, so the caramel is going to get very sticky or hard.  The flour really helps to keep this from happening, and I love these things cold too.

This dough is the best cinnamon rolls that I've ever made, and I've made a few.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and followed the recipe exactly.  For 1/2 egg, I put an egg in a bowl, whipped it up and then used 1/2 of it.  The dough is better than Clone of a Cinnabon in my opinion.  I used the breadmaker and put all the liquids in first except the yeast mixture.  I let it go in the dough cycle and it was perfect.  Let me just say, I'll be making these again and again for those special mornings on the weekend.

I made these to have for breakfast on an overnight cottage trip with friends and they were a big hit.  I did follow the recipe exactly, but next time I would make a few adjustments. There wasn't enough caramel sauce for our taste, so next time I will double the caramel and put a full recipe in each pan. As well, there wasn't quite enough sugar/cinnamon mixture for our taste, so I will increase this as well. Lastly, I rolled my dough out quite thin and as a result, I had to use more butter (close to a half a cup). All in all - a really nice recipe that I will make again with the modifications mentioned.

These turned out amazing! I think the only thing I will do differently is not refrigerate the dough overnight. I used spelt four instead of all purpose flour to make them healthier too. Overall the are fantastic and they turned out better than any other recipe I've tried!

These are to DIE for! However, they should come with the warning to use a high sided baking tray - I used swiss roll tins and my caramel bubbled up over the sides, dripped onto the bottom of the oven and filled the kitchen with burnt sugar scented smoke. However, even that was not enough to stop us polishing off two of these babies each, hot out of the oven!  I got 32 rolls out of the recipe, which is a nice big amount, enough to share with the neighbours. Definitely the best rolls I have come across - I would give them more stars if possible - thanks for the recipe ERIBERRY!

These never last long at our house.  What a treat!  I make a little extra caramel for the pan, brush the dough with melted butter (easier to spread on tacky dough) and cut the rounds with non-minty dental floss (helps to keep the filling in).  Personal preferences, but the recipe is magical as is!

I halved this recipe so it would fit in my bread machine.  Did everything else by the recipe.  They were perfect. I used dental floss to slice as suggested by others.  I sprayed my pan with cooking spray and did not have a problem with the topping sticking to the pan. Watch the cooking time as others have stated.  I cooked mine for 25 minutes and they were a little dry when they cooled but nothing a little bit of butter and a microwave did not fix.  My first attemp at sweet rolls and these were grrrrreat!!!!

This recipe is great. Its a wonderful basic cinnamon roll recipe. I make the dough in my bread machine, which simplifies things a ton. I double the amount of cinnamon and sugar filling, and instead of making the caramel sauce, I make a cream cheese frosting. I tried the caramel once and it was just too much of a hassle, and its just as good with the cream cheese. Thanks so much for the recipe! Its a keeper!

Finally a recipe for Cinnamon rolls that works!! I have tried three times to make cinnamon rolls and none have turned out well. Finally on Easter I decided to give it one more try and it worked! At first this recipe intimidated me but I took it step by step and changed NOTHING and they were terrific. The best part was doing the work the night before and just popping them in the next morning. Next time I will eject them from the pans as I didn't do it right away on this batch. Delicious!! THANK YOU for this recipe!

These were the best! I did use my bread machine to mix the dough on the dough setting and that worked pretty slick. I also increased the ammount of pecans to 1 cup. Try it! You will enjoy these rolls!

Awesome straight out of the oven and even a few hours later.  VERY good.  However, I did not care for them today (day-after) at all.  They were dry and blah.  So, I will definitely keep them for "day-of" gatherings only.

These rolls were excellent, but I found it difficult to get them to rise the next day as the pan was too cold. I had to put them by the fireplace. Also, I didn't have corn syrup so I used honey and it was fantastic.

Very good!  Everyone at the breakfast raved about these.  I doubled the caramel pecan topping as many suggested, but it was too much sweet goo for me.  I will double the pecans, but not the rest of the topping next time.

Very easy but time consuming...Well worth the effort though.  After having trouble with other recipes, I will use this one again.  Pecans can be omitted or replaced with anything you want.  Wonderful right out of the oven!

Got up Christmas morning and whipped these out in an hour! I realized I had neglected by buy rolls or donuts, per our Christmas tradition, and we had about $15 worth of pecans in the kitchen cabinets, so I looked up the best recipe on AllRecipes - my go-to-place for perfect meals. My husband expressed confusion when he read the part about 12-hour refrigeration. I simply skipped that part and used a pan of water in the stove at 200 degrees to make these rise within 15-20 minutes. They were perfect! However, I don't see how they make two 9x13 inch pans - I poured the pecan mixture in two pans but combined them into one as it didn't appear to be enough by far. The rolls did fit in one 9x13 pan too - they were huge and high but that is how we like them! We may have taken a few bites of the dough as we were prepping them, too. LOVED these rolls and I will make them again soon (we still have a bag full of pecans). #yum! #nomnom

I only did half of the recipe, but it turned out so good. I added more butter, cinnamon, and sugar in the centers. I plan to keep making this. I'm doubling the caramel topping, and the center ingredients next time. I live in the country so if I want something fresh. I have to make it. Very easy recipe and fun to make.

I made this last year and made some minor changes.  I used two aluminum throw away pans that I don't throw away.  They clean up easily and I can make these in two seperate bakings.  When one is baked, I put th other one on top and just turn upside down.  All the good gooey stuff goes on top of the other one with no mess. Also, made another 1/2 recipe of the topping which it needed in my opinion.  Added white raisins because I love them.  Next time I might sprinkle chopped pecans on the bottom instead of whole ones, just like the ones at Panera.  They came out delicious.  I wonder if we can use some whole wheat flour and soy milk to make a healthier version?  With a butter substitute it might be a better way to indulge without dripping in cholesterol.  If anyone does try it before I make them again, I'd sure like to know the comparison in texture and flavor.

I accidentally let the brown sugar/butter mixture bubble a bit causing the caramel to be chewier than I would have liked, but even so these were great.  I halved the recipe, rolled the dough out thinly, and had enough small rolls to fill two 8" round cake pans.  I brushed a little melted butter on the rolls before baking.  We didn't think they were dry or lacking cinnamon or caramel flavor as some of the other reviewers did - after all these are a breakfast treat and not a dessert!

This has been our Christmas morning breakfast for the past 5 or 6 years.  We all look forward to the pecan rolls!  I make the recipe as listed except I add a little of the sugar to the yeast and water so that it proofs better.  It takes awhile to assemble these, but it is well worth the time and effort for special occasions.

Tasty rolls, but not sure if they are worth the effort.  There wasn't enough sauce for the two pans.  If I make again, I will cut recipe in half to make one pan, but keep the sauce the same amount.

Awesome recipe. These were the simplest and most wonderful breakfast rolls I have ever made. Reminded me of rolls I used to get from a bakery I haven't even thought of for 20 years. We just  had these for Christmas breakfast and they will be a tradition. Only changes I made was to add mini chocolate chips to some of them and omited the pecans for some for the kids. I also accidentally combined the butter, sugar and cinnamon so just spread that on, and it was great.

It was great to find a recipe that I could do all the work the night before.  Our family participated in a 5K race on Thanksgiving morning.  I had taken the rolls out of the refrigerator before we left and then put them in the oven to cook while we got ready for Thanksgiving at my mother in laws.  What a treat right out of the oven.  Especially since the race was in MN and it was the coldest weather in 25 years.

I used this recipe for a brunch we hosted for my husband's office staff.  I was nervous b/c I have never made breads/rolls before (however Hy-Vee is 2 minutes away so I had a backup plan).  I followed the directions exactly and they turned out great.

Excellent - I once tried to get a caramel pecan roll recipe from my mother in law and got excuse after excuse.  Thank you all recipes!  This recipe was excellent.  All I did different was make extra caramel sauce and add a ton of pecans.  I did them two ways, one I let them rise overnight and they were huge.  The other way I let them rise for two hours and once I cut them I let them rise i the pan for 30 minutes then I put them in the oven.  I preferred to just let them rise for a couple of hours because my instant gratification self couldnt wait all night.  They were to die for!!!

I made these as a special breakfast for Christmas morning.  They were pretty good, although a little heavier than I would have liked.  This may have been because my yeast was old.  I also would have preferred more sticky goo in the bottom of the pan.

Made these Christmas eve for Christmas morning. They smelled wonderful baking! Was a little disappointed it didn't make very much caramel sauce so they were a bit on the dry side. Quick fix.....more coffee! :)  Next time I might try to make an additional batch of caramel sauce for drizzling half way through. I'll play with it, but overall the whole family like them.

AMAZING!  I made the dough in the breadmaker.  I had to keep punching this monster dough down every 15 minutes or so because it kept blowing the lid off a 3 lb loaf bread maker. *lol*  I had to tie Hubby down when they were in the fridge as he kept asking when they'd be ready.  End of story:  The wait was well worth it! :D  Thank you!

Due to the feedback of other users, I doubled the butter and cinnamon sugar in the rolls, and 1.5X the "goo".  They are perfect!  I make them in 4 8x8's instead of 2 9x13 which makes them the perfect size for my family.  I make one and freeze the other 3-they are great to have on hand for company or special mornings!

These were SO GOOD!  I made the dough in my bread machine, and then followed the instructions from there.  I didn't need to let them rise the next day before baking, they were already perfect.  I will be making these again, and again!

These were as great as I wanted them to be after seeing how high the ratings were.  I omitted the pecans and lined the bottom of the pan with parchment paper to make cleanup easier.  While cleanup was super simple, I think it may have made the caramel part less gooey than I would have liked.  Next time I will skip the paper lining and see if it helps.  Otherwise, I am doubling the caramel part of the recipe.  A keeper at our house!

I made these for a family brunch. I've always wanted to make cinnamon rolls and when my sister-in-law asked if I could bring "ooey-gooey sticky buns", I thought what a perfect excuse!! They turned out really tasty and everyone liked them. I was a little dissapointed that the caramel turned out more chewy than I expected... but then again I guess that is what caramel is. I will definitely make this recipe again because it was so easy and I had fun doing it! I might try to tweak the caramel topping a little to make it more "ooey-gooey"!

caramel rolls are the best!  these always turn out and are relatively easy, you just have to start the night before and get up early to let them rise in the morning.  i use 2 cups of whole wheat flour and brown rice syrup instead of corn syrup to make them a bit healthier, and i use walnuts instead of pecans.  they fill two 9 x 13 pans, so they're great for a crowd.  they make a big hit on a holiday, birthday or sleepover morning.  my daughter always requests these rolls for her birthday.

I made this recipe for Christmas morning and was delighted with it.  I have been making yeast breads for a long time and have never seen baking powder added to a yeast bread before.  Next time I will make the rolls larger and have fewer rolls.  Definitely at their best the first day of baking.  I also think you could make them to the fridge stage and then freeze the buns for a later date. Be careful about adding the entire 7 cups at once, depending on the type of day --- you may need less flour.  Thank you, Andrea, for a wonderful recipe.

I'm fairly new to yeast breads and this was my first attempt at cinnamon rolls from scratch, trying to please my husband who believes that the best cinnamon rolls come from a can. These turned out very good. I chose this recipe because it had specific overnight instructions. I didn't change anything major -- did increase the caramel slightly and baked in two round cake pans. I did find that these took an hour and a half to rise in the morning, even in a cold oven with a pan of warm water. The husband verdict -- very good but more like "honey buns" than cinnamon rolls... Whatever!

I made these for a breakfast party for work. I liked the idea of being able to prepare them on the day prior to baking. Something went horribly wrong and I'm not really sure why. They fell apart when I dumped them out of the pan and when they cooled off the caramel was petrified. Based on the reviews I even made half again as much caramel sauce hoping for some extra gooeyness. Very disappointing. 

I have made this recipe many times and they always turn out amazing: http://www.food.com/recipe/iowa-state-fair-sweet-dough-caramel-cinnamon-rolls-435816

Recipe looks delicious except the filling is not near enough for my family's liking. My grandmother made homemade cinnamon rolls every Christmas morning.  She covered her dough with (probably for this size dough at least 1/3 to 1/2 cup) slightly melted butter, sprinkled heavily with  cinnamon and crumble a layer of plenty of light brown sugar to soak up the butter. When she rolled it up some of the goo would ooooz out the ends. So good.

These rolls are so good. The pecans add a delicious buttery-ness and there is the perfect amount of cinnamon and sugar in them. I'm going to make them again, right now.

one  word - fabulous.    They rise beautifully even  though refrigerated - the baking powder compensates I think.   Anyway  these are terrific.

This recipe was fantastic! My family loved them! I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only thing I changed was the amount of flour (6 1/2 c not 7) and I tripled the carmel. I I have a feeling that I will be asked to make these delicious caramel rolls at every family get together!!!!!

Wow! Absolutely delicious. This was one of the nicest yeast doughs I have ever worked with. I made them during the day on Christmas Eve and we baked them for Christmas morning brunch. Rave reviews from the family. I did double the amount of caramel and added extra pecans for an extra special treat. I will definitely be making this again.

The caramel topping is especially good on this recipe, providing just the right amount of "goo" for a 9x13 pan.

Delicious!  I halved this since I didn't want 2 pans of 12 rolls--we don't need to be eating that many sweet rolls!  I made one 8x8 pan for a work meeting I have, and one 8x8 pan for us.  I tried half a roll and bf ate one then proceeded to steal the other half of mine.   He must enjoy them, then!  He really likes gooey rolls, so I think this was a winner!  I might chop up the pecans next time or leave them out--the halves were a bit big for me.  Otherwise, this is easy (despite the long ingredients and even longer directions) and delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are the best rolls. Easy to make, wonderful to eat, plus you can make one pan with nuts, and one without for those who don't care for nuts and everyone is happy.  They are also great if they make it to a second day.

Delicious - whole family loved.  I did double the caramel sauce (as other reviewers suggested), and am glad I did as it was just perfect.  It is simple, but took a long time to make the dough - will experiment in future using bread machine or dough bought from store bakery (or frozen dough) - to see if I can reduce the preparation time without diminishing wonderful flavor and texture.

This was the first time I've ever let dough rise over night. I felt so talented! I followed the recipe exactly until it came to the drizzle on top. I had extra dough and required more topping. Easy to add more though! Delicious! We ate them on Christmas morning with my in-laws.

I have been making these rolls for Christmas brunch for the last 8 years. Everyone looks forward to them especially the grandkids.  This recipe rivals  the Amish caramel buns found at our neighborhood farmers market.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  It's a keeper.

I made these for Christmas morning.   Doing all the work the night before and having fresh warm rolls in the morning is wonderful!  I only made 1/2 the recipe and added 1/2 tsp vanilla to the caramel mixture for added flavor. I omitted the nuts since not everyone in my family likes them.  I will be making these again.  Thanks

FABULOUS!!  I can't give enough praise for this; we use it every Christmas morning and it is something to look forward to!  I don't use quite as many nuts as the recipe calls for, otherwise I don't change anything.

The kids loved this!  We served it with bacon and eggs for breakfast.  Followed the recipe to a "T".  Came out a bit dry.  The caramel was hard, not runny and gooey like I expected.  Overall, just a good, not excellent.  Will probably look for another recipe, or try to make it come out less dry next time.

WOW, these are really good and fairly easy to make.  I followed the directions exactly except with the caramel that goes in to the pan.  It didn't look like enough for two pans so I dumped it all in to one pan.  The second pan I just baked plain and topped them with cream cheese frosting.  EXCELLENT!!

I thought these were really good, but the caramel topping did not get as thick as I thought it would.  I will try this again, maybe I did not bake them long enough.

These were SO good! i made these for christmas day breakfast and i used my bread machine to make the dough. The end result made a very pretty presentation and it was tasty as well! My only piece of advice is to make sure you only keep the pan inverted for the 2 minutes it states. I left it for about 10 and the rolls started sticking to the pan. I will definatly make these again for company!

I personally will not make this again.  If you decide to make it, first: I would watch the time listed and second would be to go to the store and buy a can of cinnamon rolls, don't use the topping it comes with and that will delete all the waiting and mess.  Then you can proceed with the rest of the recipe.

These turned out great. I cut it in half because I knew we wouldn't eat two whole pans. And next time I will double the pecans because they were awesome!
Edit: I have made these a few times. Double the pecans and caramel. Otherwise they are a bit dry. Cut down the baking time. 25 minutes was plenty for ours. You need to turn the pan over pretty quickly or the caramel will attach to the pan. Make sure to loosen the rolls from the side of the pan first, before flipping.

I agree with the other reviewers that the caramel coating and sugar/cinnamon/butter for the middle needs to be increased for the ultimate roll, but it was still good and rose beautifully before baking.  With those revisions, this would definitely be a five star recipe.

I made these with just a few changes. My family doesn't like pecans so I with held them and added orange zest to the filling. I got rave reviews from my family!

The recipe was so very simple to execute and the taste is fabulous, It reminded me of an old German recipe from my family back home it called Schneckenudel we just add Filbert nut or raisins  to thec center of the rolled out dough and either glaze it or just sprinkle powder sugar on it before placing it on the table for our famous coffee hour.."Kaffeeklatsch" like we say it back home.

Made them a couple of times and they were a hit. I made them in one day, when I had time and froze, so we could enjoy them for breakfast on our Silver Wedding & a special birthday! (Took them out of freezer night before & heated them for 10 min at 170C in the morning)

I am the hit now for Sunday brunch!  This is my permanent assignment according to friends and family.  The only thing I do differently is use brown instead of white sugar to mix with cinnamon.  Just a personal preference.
Easy to make and very well received... and consumed!

These go to 11!!. Very important note-go easy on heating the butter/brown sugar mixture. I over-did it (even though not to bubbling). You won't notice you've screwed up until you invert the pan after baking and all that gooey goodness sticks to the bottom. Follow the recipe and don't go beyond heating the butter and brown sugar are just melted together - then add the corn syrup. Even with my "problem" of ending up with rather hard carmel, these got rave reviews. Love, love, love this recipe!!

We absolutely love this dough recipe. I did make one change because my daughter dislikes nuts but loves raisins. I substituted 1 cup dark raisins for 1/2 the recipe and then used 1 cup pecans for the other 1/2. Not one roll was left. I'm asked to bring this for every church or girlfriend brunch. It's worth making the dough from scratch.

Soo Good...! Made these Christmas Eve for Christmas morning. Recipe made 2 + batches. I made one with pecans and 1 with just cinnamon. Doubled the caramel sauce as recommened. The family ate them up and wanted more! Next time I will add some of the caramel sauce onto the large rectangle of dough, before rolling. I want more goo on the inside!

So good! I made this ahead of time, on a Friday evening using a log of purchased bread dough that I thawed. I prepped my rolled out dough as stated, spreading with softened butter, cinnamon and sugar, and cut into rolls. For the topping, I doubled the recipe. I put it together and let it sit in the fridge overnight, and on Saturday morning let it sit out for about 30 mins before baking. The result was deeelicious rolls, perfectly sticky. I've had problems in the past with caramel topping getting too hard or too grainy, but no problems with this topping--it turned out great. Thanks for sharing!

I saw a pic by a previous reviewer of the bundt pan version of this recipe and decided to do that for a large brunch I was having (mostly just to save time).  I think there were 6 coffee cakes and this recipe were the first to go!  As noted in a previous post, when you make it in a bundt pan, you can just throw in the topping at the bottom of the greased bundt pan, then roll little balls of dough in your hands (mine were mostly  grape sized with a few golf ball sized) and then you don't have to roll out.  It saves a lot of time and it looks very fancy.  Note that when you make this recipe in a bundt pan it will increase the bake time by 20-30 minutes.  I just looked at when the edges were getting just slightly brown and took it out then.  The only one thing I would do differently next time is to roll the dough balls in a bit of sugar and cinnamon or easier yet- once you have your first layer of balls in the bundt pan, sprinkle the entire thing with sugar and cinnamon.  The dough at the bottom was good, but it could have been tastier.  I think that would give it some more color and flavor.

I am not sure what I did wrong - but the dough did not turn out - it was like it was undercooked - or like it lacked yeast - but I put it in there. The flavor was there but the texture and consistency was all wrong. The preparation wasn't horrible - but when you spend time making any rolled out bread - you really want it to turn out! And the caramel nut combo tasted great but absolutely made a horrible mess of my pans!

Very good. I made these with frozen bread dough to have for Easter morning. I didn't think they would fill the pan so I used cut up refrige. biscuits for the second pan, they wore excellent also.  My father ask what bakery I got the buns from (bread dough ones) because he didn't think I could make something that tasted that good.

I made this yesterday for Easter. These were the hit of Easter brunch!  I didn't wait for them to rise overnight - just let them double rise and baked them.  They were perfect, sticky, gooey, and SOOOO tasty (not to mention beautiful).  Thanks for a super-keeper recipe.

I made these rolls when I was a kid in Jr. High School. My mother gave me this recipe to make for the family. It came off the back of a bag of flour (Pillsbury? Gold Medal? Can't remember.) They are an all-time favorite in my grown kids & husband's eyes.) A little hint from my mother (the BEST baker & cook!) was when cutting the rolls, use a piece of thread or dental floss to cut. Cross over the threads, & cut through. Makes a nice clean cut – much easier than using a knife.

I love this recipe!  I have made it many times and everyone loves them!  I use my breadmachine to make the dough and since mine doesn't hold that much i usually cut it in half; the breadmachine make it so easy!  Also, I add a small amount of heavy cream- about 1 Tablespoon- to the caramel, this keeps it from getting hard... Love them and you will too!

Excellent recipe!  Makes a lot of rolls, easily fills 2-9x13 pans.  1 usually cook one, and freeze the other.  I'm sticking with this recipe because it's great, it makes so much, and it's no more difficult than any other yeast bread.  I have had the caramel turn out a little grainy, I'm going to try cooking the sauce longer.

My grandmother taught me her similar caramel roll recipe.  Hers involved waking up at 3 am.  Although it is absolutely amazing, I didn't make it that often for obvious reasons.  I just tried leaving it in the fridge overnight like in this recipe and it was fantastic!  I think overnight was even better because the rolls soaked up more of the caramel.

Thank you Andrea for sharing this recipe!!
I have tried several pecan roll recipes over the years but have always been disappointed.  This one is the grand slam we have been looking for.
Although our family is devoted to baking, I have a phobia of using yeast!  But we carefully followed the instructions and this recipe came out perfect.  My 10-year-old daughter made them together, splitting up the different steps and making the process go by faster.  One thing to consider is to plan to be home for a while, since you need time to let the dough rise then continue with the rolling and cutting step.
Have fun, this is a nice and rewarding family project!

These were AMAZING.  I used to get these all the time when I lived in NJ and I really missed them.  I cut the recipe in half but still used the same amount of brown sugar, butter and pecans and it was so good.  It was a little time consuming but so well worth it.

Great, easy recipe.  I used my bread machine for the dough and the rest was pretty simple.  The taste is great.  We had no problem with them drying out the next day, they were gone in one day!! I halved the recipe and everyone LOVED them.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Great recipe, being a cook and baker in the US Navy, here's my tip. If you'd like to make these the same day without refrigerating. This will work for any bread or pastry dough to get the dough proofed and make the rising of the dough faster.
I get a pan of water boiling on the stove, I then  turn my oven on to the lowest temp, (mine goes to 170) only for a minute or two and then turn off the oven.
Place the pan of hot water on lowest rack, then place your product on rack above and close the oven.
This will act as a proofer similar to what bakeries use. Yeast will die at temp of 140 so you won't want your oven to go over this.
Ideally the best rising temp is 80 to 90 degrees and also with some humidity and this is where the oven idea comes.
I've used this method all the time and even reheated the oven alittle and reheated the water as well. Once you get the desired rise out of your dough, take it and the water out of your oven. You can then preheat your oven and finish the baking.

This was the only thing my husband requested for our Thanksgiving brunch and it didn't disappoint!  I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the glaze.  My husband loved them and my daughter texted me this morning and said it was the best brunch to date and how yummy the cinnamon rolls were.  I think we have found a new family favorite.  Mine got a little brown on top (probably due to the oven being very crowded) so next time I'll cover with foil the last few minutes. If you're worried about the amount of time it takes make them up the night before.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I usually have to double the amount of caramel for the rolls. The first time I made them, they were not caramely enough like they were when I was a kid. I make them every year now for christmas for my side of the family!

I’ve made these twice now.  First time as written, second time I subbed the white sugar for 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and added lots of cinnamon before rolling up the dough.  I also cut the recipe in half because one 9x13 pan was plenty.  Since I didn’t want to half an egg, I used a whole one.  Didn’t notice anything different.

Absolutely delicious.  Wonderful recipe.  Definitely be making this again, but probably just for special occasions, as it is a lot of work.  But then, the best things usually are.

I doubled the amount of caramel and pecans, and chopped the pecans roughly.  Those are the only changes I made.

Baked these for Christmas morning and they came out great! I made some simple adjustments for altitude since I live in the mountains; chopped the pecans; used brown sugar in the filling instead of white sugar; and added chopped pecans to filling. I also topped them with a basic powder sugar glaze. They were perfect!

Dough is great and easy to handle. I would increase the sauce by half to better coat.

I made this delicious recipe using my sour dough starter and made a batch of sour dough, then made a brown sugar butter sample syrup rather than using corn syrup.  Out of this world fantastic!!!!Also toasted the pecans for 8 minutes in the oven. 
Thanks for the recipe.

I tried making cinnamon rolls years ago and they were not worth the trouble! But these! ARE TOTALLY WORTH IT! And they really aren’t that difficult to make! I wanted to make something special for company Thanksgiving morning and these fit the bill! Everyone loved them! I followed the recipe exactly but next time I will double the topping!

I was given this recipe to make after trying the ones  my supervisor had treated the office to enjoy one  day.  I have made cinnamon rolls for my family & friends to enjoy for Christmas morning breakfast. They were a huge hit. When I received this recipe I had to try it out. Not saying anything to my family I gave it a try and didn't say anything about the difference until they ate them. This recipe was close to my original but my family said they liked these better. So this recipe became the new norm for us.  I also prebake them then freeze them for giving to family & friends for Christmas Breakfast.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe with the baking masses. Hope everyone likes them as much as we do.

These are really good.  I didn't make any changes except I doubled the caramel.  I frooze one pan which I took out of the freezer the night before and placed in the refrigerator unti morning.  Let it sit on the counter for about 30 minutes before baking.

These rolls were good but didn't wow me. I made a second batch without the 12 hour wait, increased the cinnamon and added a few chopped pecans to the middle. You need to make sure you do not overbake these.

PERFECT!  So delicious and even my husband who isn’t not a bread eater wouldn’t let me share these because he wants to keep them to himself.  The only thing I would stress is once the rolls are flipped out of the pan, remove the pan or some of the sides will stick.  I baked on regular bake setting and did not use the convection option because I didn’t want the bake  to dry out and it was perfect!

Great recipe!  Do all the work the day before, and bake it in the next morning.  At step 5 before preheating the oven, I like to let the rolls proof in the closed oven with a pot of boiling water inside to give a faster and more efficient rise.

I doubled the caramel like some of the comments said, and used a disposable pan like others said.  Followed the dough exactly.  This was the first time I made rolls and it worked... PERFECTLY!  It was great that I could make it on Saturday, put it in the fridge, and this morning my family had fresh hot caramel-pecan rolls.  They were delicious, and disappeared quickly.  I turned them upside-down on wax paper and there was NO MESS after.  

I will be making this recipe again.  Thank you for posting!

I haven't baked cinnamon rolls with yeast in 30 years and wasn't sure if I could remember how, but these cinnamon rolls made me look like I've been baking them all of my life. Very good recipe! I did use more flour than this recipe called for but they still turned out great. Will make again and again.

These rolls are amazing! Everyone raved about them! I like that I can make them a day ahead and bake them fresh the next morning. It's a keeper for sure!

This is a great sticky bun recipe. I did make a few changes I used walnuts instead of pecans because that is what I had, I also halved the dough recipe but kept the filling, nut and caramel amounts the same. They came out perfect and didn't last long. If you plan to make the entire amount of dough I would recommend doubling the filling, nut and caramel I just don't think it will be enough for all that dough. I baked mine for 30 mins and they came out prefect not dry at all. I will be using this recipe for Holiday mornings and I know no one will ever be disappointed. Thanks so much for posting this recipe.

Loved it! First time I've ever made caramel rolls and they turned out awesome.
The only thing I'll change is next time I'll use more pecans and chop them up in big chunks in lieu of leaving them hole.

Didn't care for topping. Next time will try whipping cream & honey instead of corn syrup

Made sticky buns from smitten kitchen that was amazing :-)

Amazing! A lot of effort but so worth it! My family devoured this! It might be my go to recipe for Christmas morning breakfast. I made one change. I used buttermilk as opposed to the normal milk as stated in the recipe. The buns came out light and soft and totally yummy! Excellent recipe!

Easy and very good.  I am not a good baker and these turned out great.  We let the dough rise twice and punched it down twice.., we got busy,  but I think it made them less yeasty which I liked.

Very good just double the caramel sauce and halve the recipe unless you need so many if so increase the caramel type sauce by 4. Thank you for posting.

Made these for Christmas morn and they were delightful! I did more butter and more sugar than it says but there's no need for another cinnamon roll recipe.

Makes a great Christmas Day breakfast... But I would make a few changes. Use more nuts (and maybe use a mix of pecans and cashews) and bake for maybe only 20 minutes. At 30 minutes, my rolls were a bit over cooked.

This is my go-to breakfast recipe when I host overnight guests.  I've made these many times and don't change the recipe at all.  The dental floss trick works great!

Terrific!  I halved the dough and kept the goo and pecans at full amount.  I used a bread machine (just warmed up the h20 and milk), and they turned out great.  They don't double in size in the morning, but it doesn't affect the roll at all.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  They were gone in about 2 minutes flat- even my pre-schooler ate two.

These are so good.  The caramel and pecans are the perfect chewy and crunch that I expect from this kind of roll.
