I am the author of this recipe and the Tangy Mustard recipe.  This one when you search for it states that it is not canned and just kept in the refrigerator.  I have always canned this mustard.  I put it in sterilized 1/2 pint jars and water bath for 10 minutes. I hope that you enjoy.

Today I made both the tangy mustard and this one, they are both really good!  but I think this one is better! The beer ( I used a red ale) gives a real depth of flavour. I also only used yellow mustard seed because that's all we had available locally. I will definitely make this again, may even give it as gifts! We now have mustard for months!

Hey guys! What did I do wrong? I used black and yellow seeds and followed the recipe.. My mustard was bitter and did not taste like mustard all.

Awesome as I knew it would be...I just finished making 6 (4oz) jars...so cute...lol...I did taste the final product and was very pleased, unfortunatley I used a light beer instead of a dark robust since it is what I had on hand. Non the less it is delicious and I know by letting it sit for 2 weeks the flavors will only get better. Another great mustard recipe! Thank you pelicangal...if it wasnt for your mustard recipes, I probably would never try to make from scratch!
Note: I reviewed this recipe originally as a personal recipe back on March 12 of this year..so I thought I would share my review here as well since it has become published! Kudos to you pelicangal!

OMG, this is HEAVENLY! I scaled down to 1/3 and used all brown mustard seeds. I held off on adding any sugar until 3 days as I wanted to "test" the flavor first. I was contemplating some horseradish, but after tasting it, it's got enough kick without it! I ended up putting a 'dash' of stevia to soften the tartness. It's wonderful on everything! P.S. I didn't do the canning as I just had one small jar, I'm sure it will be gone in no time!

I make this mustard year round and can it. If you can it, you should just go ahead and double the batch. I also increase my processing time up to 20 minutes because my experience  has been that 10 is not long enough to thoroughly  heat the mustard to create the vacuum needed to seal the jar. I use half pint jars.  I also heat my ingredients in a pan on low heat and use a hand blender to achieve the right consistency  and then place hot mustard in hot jars. I love the texture and use it in many recipes. It's got a tang to it . I use 805 beer.  I  make it for my family and friends.  Thank you to the author of the recipe.  I read the reviews on Oktoberfest beer mustard from the Ball canning recipes. I decided to go with this one and I'm  glad I did.

Very good mustard with a tangy bite. Perfect for sandwiches and various meats, both right out of the jar or in recipes. The consistency is key. I read to add more beer if the mustard had soaked up the beer too quickly. I was hasty to do so and the outcome was a bit runnier than I had hope for. Stick with the original recipe, then wait the two weeks. I ended up making a second batch following the amounts precisely and was very happy with the results. Thank you for the recipe.

Amazing!! I couldn't believe I actually made this at home! I used Amstel Light beer (it was all I had that someone left here!) and it turned out great! For the brown mustard seeds I used Andhra Mustard Seeds from the Indian grocery store up the street...they have quite a bit of a kick, so this turned out like a horseradish style mustard - delicious! I gave this as a couple of gifts and they are already asking for more jars. I will make this recipe again (with better beer next time!). I had to blend in the food processor for several minutes to get the desired thick consistency, and it turned out perfect!

This is a very nice mustard.  It is sharp and tangy.  I doubled the recipe and canned it.  It is great to give as a gift with other preserves, cheeses, meats, and crackers for a lovely charcuterie board.

It's been a couple of weeks and the seeds are still crunchy. Did I do it right?

It tastes great so far.

I made this recipe as stated excepted I processed in a hot water bath like the original submitted stater... the mustard had really good flavor when I canned it... we'll see what a week or two in the fridge does... this recipe was very similar to the Tangy Mustard with beer swapped in for some vinegar and no thyme... both these recipes are great recipes to play with...
