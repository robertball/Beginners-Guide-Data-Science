This is just like the plum pudding my English grandfather made when I was a child. He served it with CPR (Canadian Pacific Railway) Brandy Sauce.  2T butter  1/3 C sugar  1/2 C boiling water  2t cornstarch 1/2 C milk 2 egg yolks  2-4 T brandy.  Melt butter in saucepan, add sugar and boiling water. Mix cornstarch in 2 T milk. Beat eggs with a fork, add  remaining milk and beat together and add dissolved cornstarch into saucepan and stir constantly until thick (about 10 minutes.) Remove from heat. When cool, stir in brandy.

This has also become a family tradition for us ~ I've made it for years now.  It is so easy and so delicious!  I use a cleaned and buttered 1 lb coffee can for a "mold" and steam it in my crock pot (lid off).

This was my first experience making plum pudding, and while this recipe is different from those I've tasted, it was very tasty.  Full of a wonderful spice flavor.  We served it warm with ice cream and really enjoyed it.

This sounds great and I would really like to try it, but no where in the recipe does it tell me how to steam it.  I think that knowing how to steam it would be very important.

I made this for the first time yesterday and it was DELICIOUS!  I left out the currants and the citron (as I didn't have any in the pantry) and it was excellent nonetheless.  I'll definitely make it again.

Just perfect.  Served with a traditional sweet white sauce.  In Wales, we would even hide a sixpence in it.

Terrific.  I doubled it and used figs instead of dates  So while there are no plums it became a "figgy pudding" perfect for the season.  I used a bundt pan to steam it in and later served it cold with "creme de cassis" (black current brandy) drizzled over the top and then whipped cream.  Could become our new favorite for Christmas!!

This looks very good-will try it soon. I just wanted to warn everyone to not use real Holly or the berries for decoration.

I've tried a number of Christmas pudding recipes, and this was the first I found that did *not* have suet.  In the USA, it's hard to get beef suet, and pork suet does NOT work.  Not only that, but the suet gives it a strange musky taste that my family doesn't care for anyway.

What can I say, but wow.  This is an *excellent* Christmas pudding recipe -- much lighter than the suet based kinds, and sweeter.  You can eat more than one piece of this, but suet-based Christmas puddings sit in your stomach like a brick.

We made it twice this holiday season (kids wanted more).   It has a sort of fruitcake quality, but it's better than any fruitcake I've ever tasted.  I did substitute dried cranberries for the currants because true currants are hard to find in the USA (most stuff labeled "currant" in the USA is actually a type of raisin -- read the label carefully!)   I also substituted dried chopped mangos for the candied fruit peel, since I couldn't find that at our grocer.

I made Julia Child style creme anglaise (a type of pourable custard really), and added cinnamon, brandy, and almond extract to it to taste.  That really took this recipe to the next level if you ask me.  The pudding is great, but with that almond/brandy sweetness it was heavenly.

I read some of the reviews and decided to sub in the figs for the plums for a figgy pudding. I made it for New Years Eve. My family liked it. I served it with fresh whipped cream.
