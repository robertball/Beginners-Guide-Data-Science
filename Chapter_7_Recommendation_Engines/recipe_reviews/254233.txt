I used that flavouring as a base: chilli garlic sauce, less oil, fish sauce, a little bit of red pepper flakes and a little dried basil.   I applied this to whatever veggies I had to spice it up. This time I used peppers, mushrooms, snap peas and carrots, no meat. It turned out nice and was a good change up in routine.  I'll try sesame oil next time too.

I found this to be a bit bland. I ended up adding some crushed garlic and a little oyster sauce at the end to give it taste and color. Loved all the fresh veges and it makes for a beautiful dish over jasmine rice.

Very tasty and easy!!!   I used a basil paste b/c I didn’t have fresh basil.  I also used rotisserie chicken.  I ate it without rice to cut back on calories.  It was delicious as is!  I’ll make this again!  A great way to get my veggies!

I don't do well with spicy, so I substituted the chili garlic with hoisin sauce and 2 cloves garlic. It tastes so good!

This was a great one-pot meal using my wok.  For the veggies, I used onion, carrot, snow peas, napa cabbage (1/4 head sliced thin).  Added soy sauce and fresh ginger, and used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil.  Delicious served over rice noodles - will definitely make again.

This was incredible! Full of flavor and quick to make. I waited to add the basil until the very end to preserve the taste. I found it was salty enough and spicy enough without adding more salt or red pepper. I was so excited by this recipe find I forgot to add the bamboo shoots. Oops! I served this with some jasmati rice...yum yum!
