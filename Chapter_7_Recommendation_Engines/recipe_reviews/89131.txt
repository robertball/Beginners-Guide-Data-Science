I made this recipe and served to my guests. We all loved it. The fennel gives it a wonderful flavor and a wonderful aroma as well.

Very good, light and tangy.  The fennel definitely gives it that extra zing.  If you start out with a good quality balsamic vinegar you end up with a good dressing in the end.....

My husband and I love balsamic dressing and this recipe really hit the spot. We loved the tangy zip to it! I can't quite put my finger on it, but I feel it could use one extra ingredient and then it would be amazing.

Excellent!! I am used to having freshly made balsamic dressing at a local restaurant and have never like the store bought. But recipe is the best! Sadly, i didn't have any fennel seed.. so i substituted it for some maple syrup. It turned out wonderfully.

I didn't really like this dressing. It was very vinegary. The fennel was a wonderful touch though.

I was making a fresh broccoli salad, when I realized the recipe called for light balsamic dressing. I didn't realize the recipe didn't include the dressing, so I scrambled onto allrecipes.com and found this one. Made it and I have to tell you.... it's awesome!!!!  My 4 and 6 year olds couldn't get enough of the raw broccoli salad with this dressing on it. Thanks!!!

Sorry...but I found this to be not to my liking! I went back over the recipe thinking I did something wrong, but found nothing. I guess my tastes are different than all the people that like this.

I like almost everything, but ... not this one.  I like fennel seeds in many recipes, but I found them out of place here.

Followed this recipe to the letter and it was delicious. One of my dinner guests said I could sell it. (True.) Thanks for the recipe.

I wanted to complement a strawberry pecan salad so I made some adjustments: I used a citrus basalmic, substituted 2 drops fennel oil for the fennel seeds. Added a drop of ginger oil and drop of lemon oil, and 1/2 t. Minced ginger, 1/4 t. Pepper, 1/4 t. Salt, 1/8 t. Cayenne pepper, and 2 T. Strawberry spread.  It was very good and easy.

Delicious and easy to make balsamic. I added extra pepper and garlic to my tasting. Great on a steak salad!

The only change I made was to use strawberry balsamic vinegar rather than straight balsamic.  I  tossed it with spinach and arugula.  Everyone had seconds on salad.

Just the right mix of tangy and sweet with a hint of something extra (the fennel). Perfect for any type of salad.

Loved it.  I made this to dip raw veggies in.  Much healthier than Ranch Dressing.
