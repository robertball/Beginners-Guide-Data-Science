I could just sit there and eat the whole bowlful. But, Iâ€™m using them in  salted caramel pecan pie with chocolate ganache on top.

Very tasty!  I like to make these to add to my salad greens - excellent with fruit.  I use a small cast iron skillet and the pecans cook up in no time!

These are the best sweet roasted pecans I have ever made or eaten. There is no heavy sugar coatin but just a glaze that lightly sweeetens the salted nuts. I used half the syrup called for in the recipe and they were still sweet enough for my taste. 
This is the recipe Ihave been looking for for years!
