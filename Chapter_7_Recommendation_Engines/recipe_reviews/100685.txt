This was a nice change from your ordinary salad. The ingredient list said that the sugar was optional and I left it out since we like the tartness of vinegar. I bought beets for the first time just to make this and I was not disappointed. I did add a few mushrooms, croutons, and a sprinkle of parmesan to make it more colorful and appealing to my husband since he is not big on veggies but it really didn't add much flavor and was not necessary.

Very delicious.  I thought it would be tangy with all the vinegar, but it was perfect.  I let the beets sit in the marinade overnigt.  I also added fresh mushrooms and parmasean cheese.  This salad is awesome and very healthy.

Great recipe. I started it before I realized the beets were canned. Canned beets are yuk. I roasted some fresh yellow and red beets (which doubled the amounts of beets) and used those in place of the canned beets. I also encourage tossing the salad immediately before serving with the spinach in place of drizzling the dressing on. I topped with a dollop of goat cheese (why not?)and some warm, toasted pecans.

Added feta and crumbled bacon....no croutons.was delicious!
I roasted my own beets and then continued with dressing as per recipe.
