Not bad overall. I think it's a terrible idea to discard the juices. I put the juices into a fat separator, then put them into a separate pan on the stove (on low), and mix in 1/2 the bottle of BBQ sauce. That made for a richer taste that isn't overpowered by BBQ sauce.
Also, when you return the meat to the slow cooker and mix the juice/sauce mix back in, no reason to cook it for another hour. Just heat it through if it cooled down during the shredding process.

You had me at Shiner Bock :) I made a few changes because I needed half the pork without BBQ sauce, so I wanted a bit more seasoning. Used a pork shoulder because that all the grocery store had. Doubled the spices listed, plus added 2 tsp of hot paprika and 1/2 tsp of cayenne. I put half of an onion sliced in the bottom of the crock pot with some sliced garlic, put the pork fat side down on top of the onion/garlic, rubbed the three sides of the pork with the spices, poured in the beer and threw in a few drops of liquid smoke. Went to bed and when I woke up, I had the most delicious pork I've ever made. Easiest thing I've made in a very long time! Used Stubbs Original sauce on the half that got sauce, but with the pumped up spices, the pork without sauce makes amazing tacos :)

I used Stubbs original bbq sauce and just made a few adjustments to seasoning for a 8lb pork shoulder butt .  Completely fell off the bone very tender! My kitchen smelled like marriage proposals in the morning.

This recipe was extremely easy.  The pork practically shredded itself.  I couldn't even lift it out of the crock without it falling apart.  The only thing I will say is the meat itself really had no flavor before you put the sauce on it.  I would have liked it to have a little something on its own with out the sauce.  After cooking in the sauce, it tasted wonderful.  I would recommend adding liquid smoke, brown sugar, or cola to the mix to give it a little more dimension.

Simply excellent. Never thought I'd be able to make pulled pork at home in a slow cooker! - this is something we normally enjoy eating out. But this time I happened to have some pork shoulder in freezer, it was snowy winter day and comfort food was calling my name. This pulled pork was almost as good as my brother in law's BBQ pork which he makes using outdoor smoker. Well, let me tell you - I was very proud of my pulled pork it was delicious! I didn't have any onion powder so just omitted it, used Kraft's BBQ sauce and added a little of BBQ seasoning. Next time I would probably add some liquid smoke just to add that smokiness to the flavor. Otherwise - thanks to the author for the great recipe and I highly recommend it!

This was wonderful! Made as is, it is just perfect and tender. If you like it a little more sweet and spicy I also added 1/4 c. Honey, 3 Tbsp. Brown Sugar, and 1 tsp. Cayenne pepper to the BBQ sauce. Tasted GREAT! I'll definitely make this again.

I made this for a large group of guests who came to our home to watch the Sugar Bowl.  I made it exactly as described, except I used a gluten free beer (Redbridge) and omitted the salt because of dietary restrictions. The butt was 5.5 lbs and required 12 hours on low.  I turned it once after 7 or 8 hours. It was so tender, that I had to remove it from the slow cooker in pieces with a spatula.  I cooked the meat (carefully trimmed of any remaining fat or membranes and then pulled with two forks) with 12 oz. of Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce as described.  I left it on low in the crockpot for 2-3 hours instead of the recommended one hour and some of the sauce caramelized on the side of the crock. It would probably be better to stick to one hour or to stir the meat and sauce occationally.  The result was superb.  I've made pulled pork dozens of times following several different recipes and this recipe is far and away the best. It was even a pretty good antidote for the pain we experienced as we watched Ohio State beat up on the Crimson Tide.

Followed the recipe including the brand of sauce. Came out awesome. I've make pulled pork before in the slow cooker - but just as important as the seasonings is the step of removing the excess fat from the meat when you shred it. Beer added a certain je ne sais quoi, but it was subtle and outstanding flavor.

Very tender! Made so much pulled pork that my husband took the leftovers to work the next day and shared with his fellow Marines. They all lived it. A hit in our house!

OMG!!!  I left NC 15 yrs ago and have not found anything west of the Mississippi that remotely resembles NC BBQ.  I think the beer thing is the marvelous ingredient.  Must confess...I ordered my sauce from the BBQ capitol of NC...Wells BBQ in Burgaw, NC.  Had to make SURE since I'm serv'n a whole group that has been promised "NC BBQ" and has NO concept of "the real thing".  Just wish I had the NC Brunswick Stew to go with it!!!!!!!

Super Bowl hit!  I used shoulder pork roast, onion flakes, 3 cloves dminced garlic, Sweet Baby Rays sweet and spicy BBQ sauce, 1 bottle Bud, pepper, some red pepper flakes and a teaspoon liquid smoke.  High for an hour as recommended, then cooked for 8 more hours.  Guests were amazed.  I think the beer really is the trick.  Served on warmed water rolls from Publix deli.  Delish!  This one is going on my party rotation menu.  Homemade deviled eggs, baked beans, cole slaw and you are done!  Enjoy!

Not being a beer fan, I decided to try a hard cider instead. I also followed someone else's suggestion and put coarsely chopped onions on the bottom of the crock pot. The pork fell apart and was moist and flavorful. The combination of apple and onion was enough for me - I didn't need barbecue sauce on mine. But Stubb's brand Whiskey and Hickory barbecue sauce was a hit with everyone else. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

Wonderful recipe, but I always use a can of root beer instead of the beer. Sounds weird, but it is incredible! Sweet Baby Rays is a good choice for sauce.

Made for a late summer party with lots of foodies in attendance.  Followed the instructions exactly except for using Corona for the beer, and everyone was asking for the recipe. 3 keys to this...the cut of meat, slow and low cook time, and of course sweet baby rays (the most versatile BBQ sauce on this planet)! I've tried at least a dozen crock pot pulled pork recipes and this is by far the best. UPDATE: Just made a triple batch for a big party and every last bit is gone after using the same edits as last time (Corona and Sweet Baby Rays), just needed two 6qt crock pots.

First time ever for making pork bar-b-q and I had rave reviews from everyone!!!  Made no changes whatsoever - used a full 28 oz bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar.  I was concerned because my finished product didn't look like the picture in strands...was more like mush, but everyone said the texture didn't matter - it was the taste!!!  Thank you for an awesome recipe.  Will definitely make again.

I substituted chicken breasts for the pork and used the same recipe and it's was scrumptious! I also mixed 1/2 a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ and 1/2 a bottle of Sweet and Spicy for the sauce which I think gave it a nice kick.

Amazing!  I also used very thinly sliced onions instead of onion powider. Sonny's BBQ sauce was just the right touch.  Served with coleslaw and it was definitely a hit.

Very good and "flexible" recipe. Tried it twice with great results both times. Used layers of onion both times to add more flavor to the slow cooking part. Used different beers each time ans some smoked chipotle spice the 2nd. Sweet Baby Ray's (original) was the BBQ sauce of choice both times.

Made just like the recipe except used Bulls-Eye Hickory Smoked BBQ sauce since some top reviews said just needs a little more smoke flavor.  All I think is OMG! Sooooo can't wait to show this off at the next party!

The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is because I don't follow directions well. In addition to some minor seasoning changes, I added 2 or 3 shots of Jim Beam & some pineapple juice. After I shredded the pork, I stirred in a cup of crushed pineapple. Used Sticky Fingers Carolina Classic BBQ sauce. My result was definitely 5 stars!

This was a great simple recipe I tweaked it a little and every time I turned around my wife and son had a sandwich in hand. I sliced 1 1/2 onions and placed on the bottom added some lawry's seasoning salt to the other spices and rubbed all over the pork & a few drops of applewood liquid smoke. I never had Shiner Bock before but no I drink it often. I used Terrell Davis spicy BBQ sauce and WOW!!! House smelled great and we ate it all weekend long. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great, easy recipe. My entire family loves it. I added one bottle of Zatarains  Cajun hot sauce. I let the mixture cool just a bit on the warm setting. This let the fat come to the top. I spooned off the fat, then shredded the pork and returned it to the slow cooker. I added a little more BBQ sauce and heated for one hour on low. Turned out great.

I didn't use Sweet Baby Rays barbecue sauce.  I used the Kroger Hickory I had in the refrigerator.  In any event, this was the best pulled pork recipe I've followed in years.  Simple, direct, good flavor, everything about it says do it again.  It lasted for several lunches afterwards.  I saved the liquid from the crock pot and re-heated that when we made more sandwiches.  I put the recipe in my phone in the list I keep to match store sales to my favorite recipes.  Saves a second trip.

Easy and delicious. I used Schell's Deer Brand beer. I also used Jack Daniel's original no. 7 recipe barbecue sauce. It's a great barbecue sauce with less sugar than most other brands. It fell right off of the bone and pulled apart perfectly. Definitely will make this again! Cannot beat the amazing smell it leaves in the entire apartment. I'm surprised the neighbors didn't stop by to try and get some!

My wife and my son's family enjoyed it and all raved about it. My two granddaughters kept coming back for more. Not sure I would change a thing.

Used a smaller pork loin about half the size...cooked on high for 4 hrs. Removed and shred...boil down juices to add flavor to half bottle of barbecue sauce....really tasty...the beer added that little extra flavor....a keeper. Also a must add a teaspoon of liquid smoke!

I substituted Sticky Fingers Tennessee Whiskey BBQ sauce for the Sweet Baby Ray's. I also loosely chopped up a Spanish onion and added that to the mix. The Pulled Pork was the best I've had! Hats off to Paula.

I made this for Christmas dinner this year.  It was awesome! I used an 8pound pork butt so I increased the spices by 1/2 teaspoon. I used the Shiner Bock added 3 thick slices of onion and 2 drops of liquid smoke. The meat fell off the bone after 10 hours  and was juicy and tender. I put most of it back in the crock pot with the Baby Rays and left some plain in another pot for the kids.  Everybody raved about how good it was.

I followed the recipe almost exactly (I used a 4 lb pork loin) and it was wonderful!  Tasty and juicy!  My husband and ALL my kids loved it.  After I shredded the pork I mixed in the bbq sauce and put it back in the crockpot to keep warm.  There is no need to let it cook in the sauce for another hour.

Made this for New Year's Eve. It was totally awesome. I mixed apple butter bar b que sauce with Desert Pepper's Honey Pecan sauce but I dont think it matters what type you use. It was savory and sweet with a hint of apples.

This is pretty much the way I have made it for years. I like to use different rubs and I sear the roast on the grill to get the smoky flavor (if the weather is bad ,you can sear it in a hot cast iron pan). I also like to add an onion sliced in half-rounds to the final cooking stage.

Everyone loves this recipe. Root beer or coke works well too. I like to add a couple of sliced onions. Cook the pork for 6-8 hours, add the BBQ sauce and continue cooking on low for another 4 hours. The quality of the BBQ sauce counts a lot.

This was a hit with the whole family!  I used a 3.5lbs pork shoulder.  I needs at least 9 hours if not longer.  The meat would not shred so i chopped it up.

Made this and it was awesome! I only had miller lites in my fridge, and the beer had a great taste in the meat! Next time I will get a heavier beer though like it is recommended. Wonderful.

The pork was very tend, which is why I gave it a 4. However, the flavor was ok...just a little off of great for me. I didn't have anyone begging for seconds so I'm guessing they all thought the same thing! That is why I didn't give it 5 stars. I might try again with a different BBQ sauce...maybe that will change things, or a different beer. However, it was a BBQ sauce we normally love. Hmmmm....ya, maybe a dif beer.

This was a very good recipe. Used pork shoulder roast and it was great and easy to shred. Good suggestion on the sauce too. Would make again.

I made this for a group Get Together & everyone love it ! I did slow cook it overnight and then reheated 2 hrs before the event.  It taste great,but the texture was a little too mushy... Next time, I will slow cooker for 8 hrs and reheat for 1 hour.

Great recipe, but I followed the suggestion of someone else and added a couple of teaspoons of paprika and a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the rub and I added a sliced onion and minced garlic to the bottom of the crock pot before placing the pork shoulder into the pot.  I also cooked the first two hours on high heat (~400) turning once after one hour.  I simply wasn't sure that it would be done in time if I only cooked one hour on high heat.  The pork turned out great and my family loved the flavor so much that I couldn't keep their hands out of the shredded meat in order to prep for the next step.

I stayed as  close to the recipe as I could.  I used a 3 1/2 lb pork shoulder (not butt).  I decreased cooking time a bit and  other ingredients accordingly. I couldn’t find the Shriner Bock so I used a dark Samuel Adams lager.   I skimmed/cut fat off before shredding and saved the juice like other reviewers said.  I added some of the juice to the barbecue sauce.   My company loved it!  I would make again but I would try to find a larger piece of meat closer to the recipe as I wish I would have had more leftovers!!

I have finally found my go-to pulled pork recipe!  I love how easy it is with minimal ingredients, which is my style.  I had two bone-in  7 lb pork roasts so I added a half more of everything except the beer.  I put them in 2 different crock pots and used a Sam Adams Summer Wheat beer to pour on top, I also added some liquid smoke to give it a bit of a "smoker" taste, nothing too crazy.  I started the roasts around 9pm on low and in the morning at 9pm I shredded the meat, drained the liquid and put it to the side to add later if needed (but I didn't end up needing it).  I put the crock pot on high for an hour and then on warm with the lid off for a bit.  It sat on warm until the party at 6pm.  I never did add the bbq sauce so people could add it themselves. Everyone seriously loved it!

This recipe couldn't be easier! I have made this recipe many times and it never disappoints. It's also great to try different sauces. We either eat plain or use onion rolls. Definitely a favorite in our house. Try using different rubs as well instead of different spices to change it up  some.

This is a great recipe! Be sure to flip the roast over half way through the 8 hour slow cook time,  this will help in rendering all of the fat and make for a more even cook. Also, butter and toast the buns before serving and you will love it! If you are a pickle fan, add sliced dill pickles and it is amazing!!!

This is really good with French rolls! I have made this twice with Stone IPA.  It came out soooo good both times.  I have an 8 qt crock pot so I put 2 cans (bottles) of beer in so the pot is full enough.  I think recipe is for 6 qt. I also skip the last hour and just shred the meat, mix in BBQ sauce and heat in microwave for 2 min due to the larger crock pot.  This is now a new family favorite!

I stuck to the recipe pretty much. I added less barbeque sauce (to taste the meat as well). and  I lost  track of time and cooked for about 10hrs. I will make again and again.

I have made this recipe many times and the flavor is awesome. I generally use a dark brown ale or lager, because thats the type of beer I like, and it reflects in the taste.

Wahoo! I finally found a fabulous Pulled Pork recipe!! I needed this to be gluten free so I made this with Omission Lager Gluten Free and Sweet Baby Ray's Original Barbecue Sauce which is also gluten free. The flavor was terrific! I also froze the extra to use at a later date and it was just as good.

Excellent recipe. I made two pork butts because I was worried I wouldn’t have enough meat. I’m glad that I did, because I had a lot of fat to pick off the meat before putting it back in the crock pot. I spread it out on a cookie sheet and take a small knife to take off fat and membranes left. My family loved it!

This is delicious!  I used Masterpiece BBQ sauce and an Oktoberfest beer. I saved some of the juices to add back in for some extra moisture after shredding and cooking for another hour. Put it on a really good roll and you’re good to go.

This was so easy! I'm all about fast prep and little to no thinking when it comes to cooking. I had a pumpkin ale on hand and the flavors of that went soooo well with the seasoning. I was surprised other reviewers said they needed more seasoning, I thought there was plenty (though I think I was a pound short on the meat, so maybe that's why, or perhaps the beer with those added spicy flavors enhanced it), and I even loved it without the bbq sauce, but I was craving bbq, so I just added 1/2 the bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's. That's our fam's favorite! People can add more sauce to taste or enjoy more of the meat and seasonings flavor. This is going in our fave crockpot meals to cook frequently. Very yummy.

Cut the recipe in half  because I don't need to make as much at one time.  Did not change any ingredients.  I used Blue Moon beer because that's what I had on hand the few times I have made it.  I am making this recipe again today.  My husband loves it.  I keep some of the finished product plain, and heat some in Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce.  Either way, it's a winner!  Thanks for this great slow cooker recipe!

OMGoodness, can you say 'scrump-delicious'?!! I can't even spell that right, this recipe was so good! I only had a bottle of Miller Light, so I used the whole bottle. Otherwise, I didn't change anything from the recipe. I knew the hubby and son would gobble it up, but the real test was my daughter, who ate it all up also - and she's a VERY picky eater! Thanks so much for sharing. This is a keeper!

I used Laguntas beer. Slow cooker for 11 hours. Turned over once, reseasoned. Meat fell off bone but fat separated very well too.

We all loved it!! I mixed the spices together then rubbed them all over the top of the meat after putting it in the crockpot. I cooked it overnight plus a few hours in the morning. It turned out very tender, juicy, and delicious!

Tasted great. Only changes I made were: had a 8 pound pork butt, doubled the seasoning because of the roast size, and added a few dashes of liquid smoke with the beer.

This is the best pulled pork I've made.  I have made this twice, once with the exact directions listed here and a second time with some minor personal preferences.  (type of beer, more garlic, type of bbq sauce) and it was amazing. 

Use the recipe as is or switch up the bbq sauce to your liking.  The bbq sauce is where a ton of the flavor comes from, the consistency of the pork has more to do with the ingredients and the cooking.  

Really great recipe thank you!

Awesome and straight to the point! Nothing fancy, just salt, pepper garlic and onion powder and actually one whole white onion chopped and a few diced garlic along with a corona beer! One hour on high and 6 on low. ! Took 10 scoops of the juice and heated on the oven with a half a cup of Sweet Rays! This is a great straight to recipe!

Put a 7+ Pound pork butt roast on a bed of thick sliced onion, fat pad up. Followed rest of seasoning directions. Cooked it on high for 2 hours due to its size, then on low for 10 hours. Drained off liquid, shredded in a 10x15 flat glass casserole. I removed fat and bone, added Sweet Baby Rays sauce. Dish was full! I'll make this again!

I LOVE this recipe! I have made this 4 or 5 times exactly as written (I usually use Guinness). My only issue is never being able to find a 5 pound pork butt. I usually get about 3 pounds and then just eyeball the spices, so it’s no big deal. My family consists of just my husband and I so this is dinner for the whole week when we make it. So good!

I have made this numerous times and it is always amazing. After making this recipe I have made 2 changes. I use brown ale because I think the sweetness and flavor work well. I also drain the liquid, separate the fat then simmer the liquid with very little bbq sauce and I find the flavor of the port is way better than just tasting the bbq sauce

I was nervous about using pork tenderloin, as it can be dry, but this pulled pork was outstanding.  I used a bottle of Blue Moon and Neumann's Own Honey BBQ sauce.  Next time I'll finely chop an onion and add some minced garlic.  I put the meat in half thawed and cooked it on low for 9 hours with all the liquid.  Easy and delicious!!  Thank you!

The pilled pork turned out to be very tender. I enjoyed the taste but my wife found the beer taste to be a bit too strong.

I made this last night for a Halloween potluck and it was Fantastic!   I followed the base recipe but made a couple of minor additions:  I added some thinly sliced Vidalia onions,  1 tsp of smoked paprika,  1/2 tsp of cayenne and 1/2 tsp liquid smoke.  I used A bottle  of miller lite and cooked my 3 lb pork loin on low for about 10 hours.  All of the liquid was absorbed into the meat making it nice and juicy and the meat was literally falling apart it was so tender.  I served it plain with white slider buns with a bottle of sweet baby rays sauce on the side for anyone who wanted to add it to their sandwiches.  The additional spices made the plain meat very tasty for those who preferred to withhold the sauce.  Thanks for sharing!

My go to for making pulled pork in a slow cooker. I adjust seasonings to add more flavor (coffee grounds, garlic and onion powder, brown sugar, smoked paprika, salt pepper, red pepper flakes, etc). I also use hard cider instead of Beer (recommendation from professional chef friend). All gives such a great flavor to the super tender meat!

I have tried many pulled pork recipes from this site and this is by far my favorite! I adjusted some things to my own taste.  I only added a little BBQ sauce and added some liquid smoke  and Worcestershire  sauce. I'm weird, I don't  even like ketchup and rarely use it. I didn't discard the juices. I adjusted the flavor of the juice, strained it and put the meat back in to simmer  on low until it was eaten, adding a little more beer to keep it moist. It was truly delicious! I will make this again and again!

I don't even really like BBQ but my family does so I gave this a try. It's a huge hit every time and even I like it. I serve it on buns topped with homemade slaw.

Delish!  I used a pork loin and a can of Coors Light.  I did not throw away the juice as instructed because I wanted to tone down the spiciness of the bbq sauce.  I always used root beer but not having any on hand, made this a great find.  I will make again.  Thanks for sharing!

This came out fantastic!  I chopped some cloves of garlic and one red onion to use instead of the onion/garlic powder.  I used Shiner for the beer and Stubb's for the BBQ sauce.  I will be making this recipe again!

This is the second slow cooker pork recipe I have tried and this one was no better than the first.  I would not recommend discarding the broth-the pork was quite dry, and adding the barbecue sauce did not moisten the pork enough . I ended up adding a bottle of Not Your Father's root beer to add some flavor and moistness, but t was still just an OK recipe. No one else in my family cared for it and we threw out what was left over. A note to Southerners--this is not close to being as good as anything you get in the South--you will be disappointed if you are used to true siouthern barbecue,.

07.01.17 ~ Great recipe to use if you are having company and want the meat made a day ahead.  I put a pork loin in the crockpot at night before I went to bed.  In the morning it was cooked and oh so tender.  I didn't add the bbq to the meat after I shredded it as I knew some in our party don't care for it.  I served this on mini Hawaiian buns and had different flavors of bbq sauce available and Cole slaw for those of us who like to top pork with the slaw.  I am not a beer drinker - at all - but it sure did flavor this meat very nicely.  I wouldn't hesitate to make this recipe again.  Served the sandwiches with chips, 'Green Pea Salad with Cheddar Cheese' from AR, chips, veggies and dip and everyone enjoyed their meal.

This is a huge hit every time I make it.  Depending on which beer I have, I also add a squeeze of fresh orange juice. I use less bbq sauce and serve the rest of the sauce on the side because i'm not a huge fan of too much bbq sauce.

Super easy!  I followed directions, because they were so simple.  Many times, I adjust, but this seemed like a winner.

Put it on before fixing Sunday breakfast (Dutch Babies), and this was ready to turn down and let cook, while we attended church and lunch out.  Great Sunday meal.  And leftovers for lunches this week!

This was great and all my co-workers and family agreed. I made no changes and it is now my go-to recipe for pulled pork. I still will smoke a pork butt occasionally but for easy overnight pulled pork, this is very good.

this was a little more work than some slow cooker pulled porks.  That was due to the draining, cleaning and starting it back up.  It was very good though.  Work the extra steps.

I Tried it your way and was very happy, I usually us MOHO instead of beer, and poke holes in the butt and push garlic cloves inside and then complete seasoning heavy on the top. But I was very happy with the beer I used Bud lime . Bar BQ sauce is your personal taste, we usually have black beans and rice, and then make sandwiches with the left overs and us ether sweet baby rays or Pats on a patato burger bun. Yummy. With chips or tots.

The first change I had to make was the beer.  I forgot to buy any;  turned out I had a Heinekens on hand, which certainly is not a dark beer.  But the rest of the recipe was the same.  The barbecue was very good.  HOWEVER, may I say this recipe could be served without the barbecue sauce. Add some cooked apples, some hot sauerkraut, mashed potatoes with gravy made from the cooking sauce.  The meat was just delicious.  It was tender and juicy.  Fabulous.

The only difference I did was cooked a 9 pound pork shoulder. I added liquid smoke, garlic and onions. Instead of using salt and pepper, I used kosher salt and cayenne pepper. Overall it was good.

Thank you for this recipe. Made it for my son's birthday dinner, so I modified it a bit for his tastes. I was really worried that the pork loin I bought wouldn't do well for pulled pork. So I marinaded it with a rub of various yummy spices the night before. Then I added some balsamic vinegar, 1/2 beer and 1/2 root beer. Put a bed of onions on the bottom of the slowcooker and added the roast. Cooked for six hours, and it was a perfect 145 degrees. Shredded it (so glad it worked), reduced the sauce, and put the reduction and shredded pork back into the slow cooker with a bottle of BBQ sauce. Served with French's fried onions in brioche rolls with a vegetable salad.

So very very simple. This was my first try at pulled pork and it disappeared (& I had doubled it). I made my homemade bbq sauce to go with it instead of store bought but kept seasoning the same. The pork was so tender shredding was easy task by hand. Great for parties or busy day. Made for Memorial day so with everyone's different schedule there was food ready when they had time to eat.

Will be making again.... and again.... and again.

I used pork chops which were on sale cheaper than the pork butt. Using Miller beer. I added garlic, onion, A1 marinade, Worstershire sauce, along with Open Pit. I woke up to a great smelling house ! After shredding, I added some of the juice from the cooker and more Open Pit Honey and Bourbon sauce. Served on onion rolls, they were delicious !

I have made many pulled pork recipes like this in the past. I prefer to use organic BBQ sauce, but often make my own. Most commercial BBQ sauces use too much sugar, even HFCS, and too much salt. Also some unpronounceable chemicals. If I use any commercial brand at all, it is the Heinz 100% Natural, although it does contain xanthan gum, which I am not sure what it actually is. As to beer, I generally use a non-alcohol beer. Regular beer is made for drinking. I do sometimes like to use a stout or porter, but very sparingly.

I appreciate the fact that the BBQ sauce is not added until the end.  So many people make the mistake of cooking it all day in the sauce which then completely overpowers the taste of the pork.   I only discard about 1/2 to maybe 3/4 of the juice.   I shred the meat, add some black pepper and let it absorb the juice then add a very small amount of BBQ sauce (I use KC Masterpiece Original) and serve the rest of the sauce on the side so people can add (or not) to taste.   Good seasoning choices, great recipe!   (For an interesting tangy twist, try the new Heinz Carolina style BBQ sauce.....I was skeptical but now I'm a fan!)

Followed recipe to the letter until it came to the beer and someone else had used root beer so I did one better and used Not Your Dad’s Root Beer! Which I have to agree it adds a certain sweetness to the BBQ and freezes well if not feeding a crowd! Second time making this and definitely not the last!

I thought this recipe was very bland. I used the same beer and a KC spicy bbq sauce. I did LOVE the fact that it fell off of the bone..clean@  I will continue to cook my pulled pork in the smoker.

I have never made pulled pork before but wanted to make it for my company potluck, so did a search and came up with this one.  Seemed easy with straight forward instructions so I gave it a try.  I bought a 7lb pork shoulder and a can of Budweiser.  The only thing I changed a bit was I added a large sliced up onion (I didn't have onion powder).  I followed the cooking instructions and in the morning I had super tender pork.  I kept some of the liquid, about a cup and some of the cooked onions, stirred in the barbeque sauce and voila!!! It was that simple.  The hardest part was picking out the meat from the fat, but I certainly didn't mind.  The fat helped to keep the meat tender and flavorful during cooking.  This recipe is a keeper and going into my recipe book.

I made this pretty much as it is. It had a ton of flavor, better than some other recipes I have tried for pulled pork. We use the meat for a variety of dishes, not just with bbq sauce.
I will definitely make it again and use it as a go-to recipe.

Excellent recipe. The beer gives the look an extra zingy flavor. Like previous reviewer, I saved the juice and mixed it in with the BBQ sauce, it definitely helps the pork retain some of the beer flavor. This is a great recipe for a cool fall day or football Sunday!

It's great! I only had a 3.5# roast, so I didn't need a whole bottle of BBQ sauce. And I used a bit of paprika instead of onion powder (because I didn't have any). And I used Sam Adams Octoberfest. :)

Only change was to add 8 oz. of Famous Dave's Sweet 'n' Spicy BBQ sauce to the recipe. Delicious!

I used a 12 oz. bottle of chocolate peanut butter stout that got left at my house instead of a beer and added a sliced onion on the bottom and also some whole garlic cloves. Followed the rest of the recipe as directed. Used a crockpot liner (which if you've never used one, I highly recommend that you try them) for easy clean up.  Let me just say that there are hundreds of ways to cook a pork butt in a crockpot, this is a good way to use up an abandoned bottle of odd beer/stout that you don't see yourself drinking.

This was very easy to make except for separating  the fat from the meat when "pulling" or shredding the pork. I used a 6.5 pound shoulder roast and it worked fine.  I finished it about 6 PM and was serving it the next day so I put it into a dutch oven and put it into a oven set at 170 until noon the next day when it was time to serve it. Everyone loved it and I will be making it again and again. 2 things to note - I put a sheet of aluminium foil over the dutch oven and then put the top on - it keeps the juices in and prevented it from drying out. The second thing is that it came sealed in a cry-o-vac package and so I rinsed it out - putted it dry and cover ed with plastic wrap for a couple of hours before using. This should be done with any type of meat   to allow it  rest out of its own juices.

The pork turned out great. I'm glad I found this recipe. The only thing I did different was that I used Miller lite since I already had that on hand.

So easy, tender and very good! You could also add a Tbsp of liquid smoke if you want a smoked meat flavor.

Used 7 pounds pork butt from Costco, negra modelo, baby Ray's.  Just cooked on low overnight and after shredding and adding bbq sauce kept it on warm.  Turned out delicious and super easy for a crowd. (Andrew's baptism)

I used Yingling beer (because that's what we had in the house) - pork was delicious even before I added the BBQ sauce! - you could stop right there if you wished.
I used Robert Rothschild Sweet & Spicy Bourbon BBQ sauce - YUM!!!

I used this recipe and combined it with mine. I dont use barbeque sauce in this, I used ketchup & mustard instead. About a cup of the ketchup. I also use a jar of dill relish, juice and all.  It makes a yummy combination!.

Pretty good.   Lots of pulled pork recopies out there, and this one is solid though probably not my all time favorite.  I'd use a rub and let it sit for a day if you have the time.  I prefer to pour the sauce on top after and not into the crock pot,  and defiantly with this one because to much sauce over powers that beer flavor.   The beer flavor does show up,  if your going for that this is a good recipe.  I'd only pout out about half the juice, not all.  keeps it moist and  gives more beer flavor.

Loved it enough to make it twice, but the second time I used hard apple cider instead of beer. Turned out sweeter and with more flavor!

I prefer to slow cook it with a bottle of honey barbecue and lots of garlic the whole time. An hour before it's done, I shred the pork butt and remove about half of the sauce. Then, I finish cooking it like that.  I also make sure to use only all natural and gluten free products because of my children.  It makes for a wonderful lunch the next day as well! enjoy!

I rarely take the time to rate recipes on here, but I had to for this one. It was easy as could be and so delicious. The only change I made was I kept some of the beer in the pot (Sam Adams) before adding the BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's Original). I've tried 3 slow cooker recipes for pulled pork and this was by far the BEST!

I used a 9lb butt (it barely fit in the crockpot), and I trimmed some of the fat before putting it in to cook. I didn't have room to double the beer, but it seemed fine with only one bottle of Shiner Bock. 

After removing the bone, fat, etc, and shredding the meat, I ended up with a crockpot about 1/2 to 2/3 full, and used 3 12oz bottles of sauce. 

Don't remember what brand I used, but I buy sauce where corn syrup is NOT the first ingredient. 

It was very tasty, and everyone raved about it.

VERY disappointed!! I was looking forward to enjoying this all day as it cooked, but it just didn't work for husband or me. Even though I used additional seasoning as others suggested, the meat itself was nearly tasteless. Without the BBQ sauce added later, it would not have been usable.

I used a Pineapple Flavored Beer, it turned out great! So moist and full of flavor. Great recipe!
