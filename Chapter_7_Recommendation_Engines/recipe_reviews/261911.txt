It did take more attention and some techniques that I had never used before but following Chef John’s exact directions resulted in the best croissants my wife and I have ever had this side of Paris.

Not the easiest recipe and I am not much of a baker but following it step by step resulted in amazing buttery crispy flaky croissants!  The video really helped with the visuals!  I also froze half to make at another time.  Id definitely make them again - they were a huge hit with my family!

Well done, great recipe!  If you read the footnotes at the bottom of the recipe, it state to use 1 3/4  tsp of table salt if you are not using Kosher salt.  So if yours turn out salty, you did not read the footnotes.

This was a great recipe and the video was lovely. Some personal changes I made are:
I did half water, half milk. 
I used less sugar, maybe 3 TB, not 1/4 cup. 
I did an extra turn just for giggles.
We put chocolate chips in a couple and cinnamon & sugar combo in a couple. The butter in orginal dough threw me off. That step isnt in any other recipe I have seen.  

All in all, delicious!

This was a great recipe. Croissants are indeed challenging to make. Working with chilled dough requires discipline! But they are absolutely delicious.

Great recipe if you follow directions correctly -- be sure to watch the video. You can be creative with the shape and fillings. Make sure your rolling pin is sufficiently sized as it can be difficult to return to a large rectangle shape after so many trifolds.

I have made these a few times and each time they get better and better. I have even placed a small piece of fine chocolate in the center for the perfect confectioner treat. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and you’re going to make someone’s day.

After six hours of preparation, my croissants came out more like flaky biscuits I could have made in 1/3 of the time. Disappointed.

I didn't expect to have my result to look as well as the video, but I did expect them to task good.  Mine came out over salted (I used unsalted European style butter) and overdone.
