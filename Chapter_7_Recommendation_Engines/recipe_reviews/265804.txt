6.26.19  Do plan on having vegetable broth on hand because you will need it.  The recipe doesn’t say to cover the skillet, but I did just to get the carrots cooked.  I followed the recipe except for using probably closer to a cup of broth rather than a half-cup and adding it to the chickpea mixture along with the spices.  I could see no other way the carrots were going to cook in a dry mixture, felt this needed moisture for tender carrots.  If I were to make this again, I’d probably pop the carrots in the microwave for about a minute to give them a head start on cooking.  The flavor of the curry changed dramatically from the beginning to the end, so don’t shortcut the 30 minute cook time.  Honestly, I haven’t had that much Indian cuisine, but I did like the blend of spices in this curry.  It was O.K.,  just not sure I’ll make again.  I think that comment is more a matter of personal taste, rather than any fault of the recipe.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
