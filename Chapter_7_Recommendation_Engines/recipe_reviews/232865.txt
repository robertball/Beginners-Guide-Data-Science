This was a really simple recipe and it was very rewarding. Loads of flavour. I used cut up leg meat. Like the idea of putting mushrooms in it. Thanks (Must stop eating it)

Wonderful!  The sauce was very flavorful, I added an additional 1/4 cup of the white wine to thin the sauce and still needed the 1/2 cup reserved water - well worth the time!!

as Christina did, i cut up the chicken before i cooked it. this was pretty good. came out looking just like the picture. the ONLY thing i would try changing is to add some sliced white mushrooms when you saute the garlic. yumm!

I used 3/4 of a cup of chicken broth in lieu of white wine. I also used a combination of bacon and pancetta. When the pasta was done, I used about 1/2 cup of the salted pasta water (still warm) to the sauce mixture to thin it out a bit more.  Great flavor all around (I used a lot of black pepper because, well, I love it haha)!

Meh...not that impressed.  I used roasted chicken meat and  tossed it lightly with the bacon grease until it was hot.  Used applewood smoked bacon and added mushrooms.  Sauce was too thick and very grainy.  I would recommend using only 3/4  - 1 cup of parmesan cheese and only 2 eggs.  I would also thin it with either some chicken broth or water depending on your tastes.

Love this recipe!! I added mushrooms, diced tomatoes, & onion to the mix for more flavor and zest. The original sauce is amazing, but I added a little Alfredo on top for added boost.

Delicious! Very easy to make and had great flavor. I cut my chicken before cooking, just to save myself a step later. This is a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Follow the instructions from several other reviewers and added 1/2 cup pasta water and 1/2 cup more wine. After we stirred the pan reduction into the egg and Parmesan mixture, we poured it in the pot over the drained pasta and peas and stirred vigorously over the hot but off burner until a creamy sauce was formed.  Perfect!  No grit or graininess and super creamy. Thumbs up from the whole family!

My husband loved it!
I added frozen peas.  Very good, but pasta soaked up all the sauce for leftovers.  My husband didn't complain though.
Good, hearty meal!

Excellent flavor, but I had to add sauce as it became very dry.  I did add mushrooms and used cooked chicken to save time.

I used chicken broth since I had no wine. Even with the added watch at the end it still was very thick. Would have liked more of a cream flavor, will experiment with seasonings next time too as it was bland to me.

This is  great recipe...very flavorful... but it needs more sauce. I would one and a half times the sauce recipe. Then it would be amazing!

This recipe was excellent! I used bacon grease that I had saved from making bacon previously and turkey bacon bits to reduce the calorie count a little. Still, it remained an extremely flavorful one-bowl meal.

Pretty good, but I felt it was missing something as the recipe is written. I added mushrooms, as some other reviewers did. It needed more salt and pepper, and I sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top. Still felt like it needed a little something, but wasn't able to quite put my finger on it. Both adults at dinner liked it (including me), but my 9 YO did not. Will definitely make this again, as it was very good, but will experiment a bit with the recipe.

My wife and I make this quite a bit. As written it’s great. I cook the chicken with Italian seasoning and wrap it in cling wrap to rest then I shred the chicken and use the juices for the sauce. I also use broccoli florets instead of peas.

It didn't blow my mind, I would give it 3 stars but I'm dumb and put a billion more peas in than it called for so any flavor deficiencies are certainly partially on my account

Turned out great! Even despite the fact that I used the cheap grated (powder-like) Parmesan cheese. I used frozen mixed veggies, instead of just the peas. I didn’t have as much chicken so I should’ve used more veggies, but still delicious. Like other reviewers I cut up the chicken prior to cooking. I want to make again when I have mushrooms on hand.

I liked the recipe, I did change a couple things like the noodles, I used vegetable noodles and I didn’t have peas in hand but had a lot of Brussel sprouts and my husband loved it and my kids liked green spaghetti noodles I made. So win win for us. I added additional water because it was very thick.

This is a keeper for our family!   I used a herb rotisserie chicken and pulled it and used chicken broth instead of wine.  It's not easy pleasing three teenagers for dinner, but this one did!  The rotisserie chicken made it even quicker to make.  Will definitely make it again!

This was so good and relatively easy to make. It was creamy and the flavors were well balanced. I did not add any of the extra pasta water because the sauce was a good consistency. I added mushrooms which I sautéed with the garlic and I cooked the chicken after I cut it up. I added extra bacon which was a big hit. I would definitely recommend this meal, though I would not say itis an easy weeknight meal.

Another family hit! So tasty! I'm not a big fan of peas so with 2 cups it was a little much for me, next time I'll just try it with 1. Other then that super tasty and fun to make!

My sauce was too thick and grainy so ended up adding cream and whipping it in the metal bowl over the boiling pasta water which then overflowed all over my stove! Not sure what I did wrong to end up with that result but luckily I was able to save the disaster I had created. The end result was delicious though!

Absolutely delicious! Halved the recipe, but used 2 eggs and upped the wine so it wasn't super thick. During the step while cooking garlic, I added a Roma tomato chopped, small pieces of broccoli, and balsamic vinegar, and omitted the peas altogether. Will DEFINITELY be making this again. Absolutely delicious and can't wait to sop up the juices next time with garlic bread.

I swapped out the spaghetti for bow tie pasta and added the step of sautéed mushrooms in the bacon grease.

We loved it!  We used penne pasta and took the suggestion of adding mushrooms.  We made about 2/3 of the recipe (just 2 of us), and had it for two meals. Definitely will make again, even for company!!

This recipe was delicious. I traveled throughout Italy tasting carbonara and am married to an Italian- so I had high expectations. I did double the sauce because I was serving 6, and I wanted to make sure I had enough sauce to coat the pasta well. I also cut the chicken in smaller pieces and cooked in the pan instead of cooking and cutting later. We left out the peas because we don't care for them, and made sure to add enough salt and pepper. It was delicious! Serve with a side salad to lighten it up and it was awesome!

Only things different I did was cook chicken and bacon together in oven to save time and dirty dishes. I also only used 2 eggs because that was all I had so adjusted Parmesan to only about 1 cup.  Great recipe. Will cook again

Delicious!  I used angel hair pasta and sauteed chopped spinach/kale mix with the garlic (instead of the peas).  I also used leftover roasted chicken and pre-cooked bacon pieces because that's what I had on hand. Will definitely make this again.  Perfect for weeknight dinner!

I loved this recipe because it wasn't high in fat, and so simple and delicious.  Of course we add our own flavor touches  and mine was fresh basil and pancetta instead of regular bacon.  I saved it to my recipe box for future carbonara nights.
