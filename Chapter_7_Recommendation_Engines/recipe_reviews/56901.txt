An excellent, fresh-tasting way to eat salmon. Since I didn't have any garlic oil on hand, I used olive oil and added a couple cloves of fresh crushed garlic. I also didn't have any fresh parsley, so I substituted 1.5 Tbsp dried. The amount of spices is perfect and I like how the tomatoes don't overwhelm the taste of the salmon. I made my husband salmon with a sweeter sauce (I'm diabetic and can't share), and he kept trying to steal bits of mine anyway! I served it over brown rice instead of white for a healthier meal, and served it with steamed asparagus and fresh green beans. Very good and it tastes wonderfully fresh.

This recipe is worth 10 stars!  

I made this for my family and the kids asked me to fix it again the very next day!  I now serve it 2-3 times a month.  I have served it for dinner parties; guests always love it and ask for the recipe.  It's very easy to make.  Tastes similar to a dish Red Lobster used to serve, but this is better.

I subsitute olive oil since I can't find garlic oil in this area, and sometimes serve it over pasta instead of rice, which makes it extra filling.

Here's a quick update on this dish ... my husband suggested using jumbo prawns instead of salmon (although we love the salmon) ... I tried it yesterday and it's just as tasty.  This is a FABULOUS dish! Below is my original review ... 

I made it last night and I thought my husband was going to pick up the plate to lick off the very last of the sauce!  

I made just a couple of easy changes ... I used brown rice rather than white, simply because it's a little healthier and I think brown has a better flavor.  I used Mexican diced tomatoes since that's all I had, they were spicy and I figured that was what was being called for so what the heck?  

This dish is good enough for the PICKIEST of in-laws or children, a wonderful recipe for company or a romantic evening at home with your honey.  Honest to goodness, this was DEEEE-LICIOUS!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I was worried about taking a beautiful piece of fish and preparing it like this but it was wonderful.  I did serve it over angel hair pasta, which was great.  I feel bad about saying that I "tweaked" the recipe just a bit, but I did.  It seemed that the salmon needed just a bit more sauce and so I added about 1/4 cup of dry white wine and about 1/2 cup of heavy cream.  It was so delicious!  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

This is REALLY good. would never think about adding all those spices together.  The combo of all ingr. together reminded me of something canjun. One pointer... do break up the fish like the recipe says to do.  I followed another reviewer and didn't and think the flavors would have mingled even better if the fish was broken up.

thank you for sharing this very easy and tasty recipe - i agree - it truly deserves a fancier name!  i was a bit afraid to flake the salmon in the last part of the recipe so i just left it in cubes but will flake it a bit next time.  i didn't have garlic oil but simmered a large smashed clove of garlic in some canola oil before adding the salmon.  i didn't have fresh parsley so i used dried.  i didn't know what kind of parmesan cheese to use so i bought the type shredded in the bag and then put a little bit of the type you sprinkle over spaghetti.  i sprinkled capers over half because only one daughter and i like capers.  it's yummy and deeeeelicious and i will definately make it again.  next time i will try the canned tomatoes if i don't have any fresh ones.

This a wonderful new way to cook salmon! We like it over rice as well as over angel hair pasta. I omitted the [hot sauce, used a can of Italian-style diced tomatoes, and added 1 tsp. Italian Seasoning. It was delicious and reheated well, also. Thanks, we're keeping this one!

Loved this recipe as did the whole family (including my fussy 7 yr old son)!  Whipped it up in no time when I was running late getting dinner organised.  Omitted the hot sauce and didn't have any dill - but soooo good anyway!!  (I diced the salmon before cooking it) Thanks - the kids were asking me to cook it again... got to be good!

This is restaurant quality. I used sesame oil instead of garlic oil since I didn't have any (just boosted the number of fresh garlic cloves). Didn't have any Parmesan cheese so I substituted very finely shredded mozarella. I also used a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh. Think I will omit the butter next time to keep it healthier. It was so flavorful, I don't think it needed it. This is definitely a keeper!

This recipe has become a household favorite.  Everyone cheers when I tell them we are having "Salmon and Tomatoes" for dinner.  This is amazing since I have a 2 year old daughter who eats nothing, a picky 5 year old, and a 7 year old who is always asking me to try something new.   The flavors in this dish are wonderful!  I follow the directions exactly.  Sometimes I add some spices, but it is wonderful just the way it is.  I am making it tonight and I already have children dancing with joy in the kitchen.   My husband told me this was his favorite.  He always says that I do not make enough.  This recipe will be passed on to the next generations.  Thank you so much for sharing!!!!

A surprisingly delightful dish. Quick; easy to change up to your own tastes.  I added diced onion and a bed of sautéed spinach on top of the rice before adding the salmon. It added just the right veggie to the dish.

I was a little nervous trying this recipe without any reviews yet, but after reading the ingredients, I thought what's not to like. I did add capers, which we love, & served it over angel hair pasta with crusty bread, & a nice cabernet. This one we will make often.

My husband absolutely LOVED this dish!  I used the oil in the minced garlic container with a touch of olive oil...canned diced tomatoes, 
dried parsley and parmesan  instead of fresh...and only a "smudge" of butter.  It came out perfectl!

Good flavor and pretty easy. The fish did get a little bit too cooked since I had watery tomatoes that needed to cook down. In the future, I'll remove the salmon from the pan before adding the tomatoes. Once the tomatoes are cooked down enough, I'll add the salmon back in to finish cooking. I'll make this one again.

I found this recipe when I had little to cook but frozen salmon and some tomatoes from my garden. Oh, it was soooo good. The flavors were amazing. I used brown and wild rice as my base, uncle bens 90 second blend, lime juice, and the hot sauce you get at chinese resturants. I also used fresh garlic in the oil, minced, and smart balance butter instead of real butter. Shows how versitle the recipe is, lol.

I was surprised at how well this recipe turned out. I wouldn't have thought to add tomatoes in a salmon dish. I did make an alteration to the original recipe; I didn't have any hot pepper sauce so I added some flaked red pepper to the salmon, which turned out nicely. I also didn't break the salmon into cubes, I left it as a filet.

Made this tonight.  Had to make a few changes:  didn't have any garlic oil, so I sauteed 4 cloves of garlic in olive oil at a low temperature, used 2 cans of unsalted diced tomatoes, and substituted 1.5 tablespoons of dry parsley for the fresh.  The recipe didn't state whether the salmon filets should be skinless, so I removed the skins when the salmon was sauteing.  I used brown rice as a base.  It had a lot of flavor and was relatively easy to make.

this was even better than I thought it would be.  I'm not a Salmon fan but this worked out real well. I substituted pasta for the rice since we had rice last night, but it was very good!  The combination of dill, paprika, garlic, Parmesan and parsley was very good!

Oh yes, lick the plate.  One never has ALL the ingredients, do they?  As a salmon lover, these flavors are wonderful together.  Would not have thought of them myself!  Used SMOKED paprika (more than a 1/4 teaspoon) for the first time.... wow!!!

Made the tomatoe part of this with fire roasted diced tomatoes and used talapia fish. My son LOVED it.  I didn't serve it over rice, and it was still fabulous.  Thanks for a quick recipe.

I really did not care for this recipe, as written.  I felt it was very bland.  We took it up a star by adding a lot of heat by some cayenne and frank's hot sauce .  The salmon was nicely cooked but the tomato mixture was just bland.  I am not going to make this one again without changing the recipe.

The salmon dish turned out alright. It reminded me of a chunky fish stew of some sort. Tasted good, but it's probably not something that I would make again.

Delicious! Some reviewers were wondering why the butter is needed--it "mounts" the sauce, giving it a wonderful sheen and adding flavor and texture.  I followed the recipe, except I didn't have dill and used basil instead. I made my own garlic oil by warming the oil with a smashed clove, which I removed before adding the salmon.  I think I cooked the salmon a bit too long, so next time, I'll add the tomatoes sooner. I noticed in the photos that some cooks keep the salmon fillets whole, but I think the point is to infuse the sauce with the salmon flavor. I liked the dish served over rice--reminds me of a Creole dish. My husband ate his with mashed potatoes and loved it. My one-year old liked it. This is worth trying!

This was very very very good.  You can end up using quite a bit of salmon to fill it out, but it is worth it.  Definately serve it with rice because the sauce is excellent and would be good soaked into some rice.  I had mashed potatoes with it and while good, rice is the way to go.

Delicious! I made garlic oil by sauteeing garlic and removing it from the pan before adding the salmon so it wouldn't have a chance to burn. I also used one can of drained diced tomatoes in place of fresh and eyeballed the dill, paprika, salt and pepper. Rarely do you find recipes that are this flavorful without a lot of doctoring. Thanks for the yummy recipe! **Update, I make this at least once a week - it's so easy and so good. I start parboiled rice cooking and then start the salmon so it's all done in about 20 minutes. I highly recommend this recipe.

Unique combination of flavors--fragrant and delicious.  Great way to use tail portion of fillets-or other random pieces. Reduced oil/butter a bit --this is a delightful surprise.

Wonderful salmon dish! I grilled the salmon and put the sauce over it, but I am sure it would have better picked up the tomato flavor if it had been cooked in the sauce. I just wasn't in the mood for salmon chunks.  I did up the amount of hot sauce a bit. Served with brown rice and asparagus, this was a simple and delicious meal.

Really nice salmon dish! Similar to a way I prepare halibut. I used an Alaska sockeye salmon filet sauteed in olive oil that I flavored with fresh minced garlic. Used Frank's hot sauce, but couldn't detect any heat at all, so might up that slightly next time.  Served over basmati rice. Love that parmesan/butter mixture! Thanks so much for sharing your recipe, MToussaint!

Wow, YUM!  I too was skeptical about doing something so different with salmon without much to go on for reviews but this is REALLY REALLY good.  My husband loved it too which is so gratifying plus I was nervous because he personally caught the salmon.  We served it on rice with green beans on the side.

5 stars does not give this recipe any justice, an amazingly delicious and visually pleasing dish.  I added a handful of diced mushrooms and substituted red pepper flakes and cajun seasoning for the hot sauce while not adding the butter.  Paired with some steamed veggies and a glass of white wine the wife LOVED this meal.  Many thanks from the both of us.

The salmon was moist and the dish was flavorful. It tasted very good and was pretty healthy. The only change I made was to eat it with brown rice instead of the white that was suggested. Allow a longer cook time as brown rice does take much longer to cook.

When I made this, I doubled the recipe, and I thought the seasonings were tasty, but somewhat mild - maybe I need a different hot pepper sauce, because that amount for how much fish was not particularly effective. I also replaced one tomato with a zucchini, and it was very good. I served with pasta mixed in rather than on top of (I'm lazy). Very good, excellent even as leftovers, though my fish broke up substantially from mixing it up.

I would give this recipe a another star if I could. A great meal to make during a busy weeknight (or anytime)...it is quick, easy and very flavourful. Even my kids who do not like salmon, absolutely love it. I usually serve this over angel hair pasta, but really you could serve it over anything and it would still be delicious. It is also excellent heated up the next day...yum!

Fabulous! I've been so tired of baking or broiling our salmon fillets every week.  Finally, a recipe for salmon which doesn't require me to heat up the whole house!  My kids and I loved this even though I didn't make the rice.  I made potatoes and just ended up mixing the potatoes in with the salmon in my plate.  It was quite good this way, but I'll make the rice next time.

Salmon is one of my favorite dishes.  I make it often, at least once a week and this recipe is by far my FAVORITE!  I followed the recipe exactly except I added a bit more dill at the end, used 1 TBSP smart balance instead of 2 TBSP butter, and served with rice pilaf.  Thank you, thank you for the beautful recipe.  Even my four year old daughter gobbles it up!

Very, very good!  I didn't have any garlic oil, so I sauteed some garlic in olive oil before I added the salmon (I used 4 - 4oz frozen salmon pieces in he dish).  I used 1 can Rotel tomatoes and 1 can petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh.  I also used dried parsley instead of fresh.  It turned out great!  A little spicy but that's from the Rotel tomatoes and I put in more than 4 dashes of hot sauce.  I also added a can of no salt, whole kernel corn.  I served it over jasmine rice that I cooked with garlic and onion.  YUM!!!

I wasn't sure what to expect with the dill, paprika and tomatoes... but I enjoyed it quite a bit.. yummy.  I did make the change of brown rice instead of white.  Very good combo and nice change for fish.

This dish was incredible!  The salmon had such an awesome flavor.  I didn't make any changes from the original recipe and I'm glad I didn't.  I will definitely be making this again!

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used tomatoes with chilies and peppers which gave the dish quite a nice kick.  We'll certainly be making this recipe again.  If I use the spicy tomatoes again, I probably won't bother seasoning the salmon with the dill and paprika since those flavors got lost with the spicy tomatoes.  I look forward to trying this with fresh tomatoes.

I eat salmon often and this is a special way to serve it.  Very rich, and like an alfredo, as another reviewer pointed out.  I served with pasta instead of rice and used more garlic.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a delicious and simple recipe.  We all had seconds, including my son, who sweetly asked, "May I have some more salmon, please?" Because I am allergic to cow's milk, I skipped the cheese, and didn't miss it one bit.  I kept it light on the spices, too, leaving out the hot sauce for the family.  Fresh parsley is such a nice touch with the dill.  This will go into our regular rotation, for sure.

This recipe is delicious!!! And very easy. The grocery's tomatoes didn't look very good, so I used a can of diced tomatoes with chiles. I served it over pasta with a Caesar salad on the side. Yummy!

SO good!  Just as a previous reviewer, I used pasta (rotini) instead of rice.  Fiance and I loved it--I even made the following weekend for FIL's.  Thanks for the recipe.

Just got done having this for dinner and it was phenomenal!!!! I used sriracha as a substitute for the hot pepper sauce because that's what I had in the house, and it worked out great. Excellent recipe that was a nice change to the soy sauce and brown sugar based salmon marinades that have become common place. Thanks for sharing it with everyone.

turned out delicious! I added asparagus and mushrooms to the mix, but I didn't have any parmesan so I made Uncle Ben's cheddar broccoli rice to give it the cheesy taste.. was so good!

I love this recipe, and get requests for it from friends all the time!  I've made it a few times - it's hard to make this recipe anything but delicious.  I omit the butter, parmesan, lemon juice and hot sauce, and instead serve it over parmesan and romano cheese RiceARoni.  My favorite, though, is to add diced avocado ... it ends up creamy and wonderful.

Yummy.  Hubby didn't care for it, but I really enjoyed it.  I only used about 1/2 cup of uncooked rice (half and half of brown and white) and quartered cherry tomatoes.   Thanks for sharing.

This dish is a winner! Small changes I made include: I omitted the hot sauce, just because I didn't have any. Because I eye-balled the spices I do believe I added a smidge more garlic than what was called for. Used a mozzarella/parmesan mixture and cut down on the butter.  My boyfriend repeatedly told me how good the dish was and commented that it seemed gourmet and restaurant quality. The paprika gives the fish and sauce a beautiful reddish color.  I served over the brown rice and with a side of steamed green beans.

This was awesome! Baed Slamon II from AR was my go to recipe for salmon, but it has competition now! I was a little wary of the idea of salmon with tomatos, but it was the bomb. I followed the recipe exactly, doubling all ingredients as I had 4 salmon pieces. When I read the recipe, I thought breaking up the salmon into pieces was weird, but I did it anyways and it really worked.

I really enjoyed this dish, though I cut down on the parsley significantly. It's a great take on salmon. I subbed 1 16 oz. can of diced tomatoes for fresh and it still turned out great. I think next time I will try adding mushrooms.

Really quite good -- don't omit the Parmesan! It really makes the dish.  Only changes -- used 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper in place of hot sauce because I didn't have any on hand. No parsley because we didn't have any, and I upped the quantity of dill, lemon juice and paprika (doubled). I used a can of diced tomatoes and juice and served over plain brown rice.  My sister-in-law ate it without the butter or parm (due to preference) and said it was delicious too.  Will be making again and again! Thanks!

I like to use wild rice cooked in chicken broth. Use a 1:3 ratio of rice to broth. Usually 1 cup of rice is good.  Serve with cheesy-toast if you can find it, or some other bread. The tomatoes + toast are kinda like a little bruschetta with your dinner.

I can't believe it's taken me so long to review this recipe. I've been making this for years now and it has to be my favorite from this site...hands down! But, I did make one change...I use 2 CANS of diced tomatoes with the liquid instead of 2 fresh tomatoes. I love the liquid it produces mixed with all of the spices. It's incredible over rice! This will continue to be in my main rotation of meals. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  I made some adjustments based on what I had on hand.  (1 can diced tomatoes with roasted garlic, no dill)  I used 1/2 the butter.  Quick, easy & delish.  Will make this again & again.  Note - my husband is not as fond of salmon as I am, but with this chopped up, he really enjoyed it.

Edit: made this with tilapia tonight. Delicious!

I've now made this recipe several times and everyone agrees that it is a hands-down success! Something about the combination of spices is perfect with the salmon. I  always use a can of whole tomatoes, cut up into small chunks, rather than fresh tomatoes. The additional sauce is perfect because I always serve this over linguine. I combine the salmon, hot, drained pasta & the parmesan cheese in a big bowl so the pasta is well coated and the salmon fully incorporated into the dish, then serve & be gracious when accepting the compliments!

I've been trying to eat healthier, lately. And I stumbled upon this recipe (I love salmon). I am actually eating this dish right now! I didn't have any lemon juice, so I added lemon pepper when it was frying in the pan. I also didn't have garlic oil, so I followed another user's advice and just used olive oil and a few cloves of garlic. I served this over whole grain rice as well. I will definitley be making this again!

Great recipe, easy and quick to make.  I didn't have any brown rice on hand so I used whole wheat rigatoni instead.  Turned out really well and would make again.  Great way to get fish in your diet

I strongly dislike salmon but my husband loves it so I cook it for him.  I was tired of the same old baked filet so I tried this recipe and WOW!!!  I even ate it and now my husband wants it once a week!  Thanks for the tasty dish!

I sprinkled garlic, rosemary and dill on the salmon while I cooked it in the oil. Added a dash of lemon juice as it was cooking. Also added chopped onions. Then I added some white wine to the sauce. Served it over penne pasta. It was very good. Thanks!

This recipe is excellent !  My 9 and 10 year old ate every bite on their plate, and salmon would not typically be one of their favorites.

Great salmon recipe.  Salmon is not my favorite fish but I am trying to eat more of it because of it's benefits.  This recipe did it for me.  I kept everything pretty much the same except like many of the reviewers I didn't have garlic oil which was solved easily by adding fresh garlic to my olive oil and I also omitted the butter since I am trying to lose weight.  

Thanks for sharing.

I really didn't expect this recipe to work for ME for some reason, but it sure did! It was wonderful. I used canned tomatoes and didn't have any garlic oil and used olive oil instead (as I read someone else did below). Absolutely delicious, even though my salmon fillets were frozen on not fresh.

WOW, that was really good. I changed it a little, I used a can of diced tomatoes and I couldn't find my dill weed, and I used snapper. It was delicious. My hubby went back for 3rds.

It was easy to make and very delicious.  I used lime instead of lemon and added capers.  I also used garlic olive oil. I may use it for company in the future. It deserves a more glamorous name....spicy salmon rustico.

Really good.  Made this with the simple salmon chowder recipe from this site (awesome) for a salmon extravaganza dinner.  I try to eat healthy/low carb, so I took my portion out of the pan after adding parsley and ate it without rice.  My boyfriend got the rest - with cheese and butter and served over brown rice.  Really good flavor!  Highly recommend.

A very different way to make salmon, but it's my favorite way to make it.  I don't change anything, but maybe add more cheese.  My fiance loves it!

I love this recipe! Salmon is my favorite fish and I'm always looking for new ways to cook it.  I followed the recipe exactly, and served it over angel hair pasta, though I'm going to try it over polenta next time, but it's definitely good enough to eat all on its own.  It reminds me of an alfredo sauce, with the butter and parmesan, but nowhere near as heavy and just as delicious.  Thanks for sharing!!

Both my husband and I really enjoyed this meal. I used shredded parm. cheese instead of grated, and I added 3 green onions cut into slivers (added them at the same time I added the tomato mixture). We even ate it just by itself without pasta or rice. This will definately be a dish I make again.

This was fabulous! I made minimal simple changes...per a review (to marinate in soy sauce) I marinated the salmon in a mixture of tamari (50% less sodium) with the dill and paprika for an hour or so. I heated the garlic oil and sautéed red onion before adding the salmon.... I wondered about leaving the skins on but I love the skins and they blended in well. At this point I added cayenne because I ran out of hot sauce (who knew!)  I used a can of fire roasted tomato with garlic including  juices (because reviews suggested more of a sauce) with the lemon juice. I used fresh parsley and real parm.  I served over orzo and the BF and I just loved it! Wow! Thank you for sharing!

So so so yummy!!! I was amazed at just how delicious this was. It was so easy to make! The salmon filet I used had its skin on and gave it a little more of a fishy taste than I like so I'll use skinless next time. But I will be making it again and again. This is my favorite way to eat salmon

I kept the salmon whole and put the tomatoes in a separate pan. Then split the butter, parsley, and and parmesan cheese between the tomato pan and the salmon pan. Topped the rice with the tomatoes and placed the salmon on top! It was soooo delicious! Definitely added to my favorites to make again!

Oh my goodness! I was a bit skeptical making this because I am not a big fan of fish and tomatoes. But I had all the ingredients and didn’t want to spend all day in the kitchen so what the heck. This stuff is so amazing! I wanted to turn the pan up and just drink the sauce. I did make a couple of minor adjustments. Since I did not have fresh garlic I used a garlic/salt paste instead and omitted the salt from the salmon seasoning. I also used a blend of fresh parsley and green onion tops called cheio verde. One tip though- if you are using fresh grated Parmesan it would probably be best to add that on top as you are serving it because it tends to just clump up in the pan otherwise.

Halfway  through this recipe I was worried it wasn't going to come out very good, but oh wow, by the time it finished this dish was unbelievably delicious.  Handsdown the best homecooked salmon I've ever had.  Even my husband said it was great, and this is a guy who rarely ever comments on food.  I followed grayhogs advice and added the white wine.  We also added a diced onion early, subbed brown rice&quinoa for the white rice and added an extra tomato because we are currently swimming in tomatoes (late harvest from the garden) and it was still just the perfect meal served alongside some steamed broccoli.  Thanks so much for providing this recipe!  I never could have imagined a dish like this into existence!  Update, made it time and time again, sometimes with fresh tomatoes,  sometimes with canned tomatoes (in the winter) and it always comes out amazing.

I've been making this for years, but never got around to reviewing it.  Its my favorite way to make Salmon! I also add garlic to olive oil rather than using garlic oil.  I've also make it with canned tomatoes when I didn't have fresh on hand.

Best dinner I've made yet! I used local wild salmon, cherry tomatoes and fresh dill. I left the skin on the salmon until I could flake it off. I had Italian Kale as a side- recipe also from this site.

I am always looking for different ways to prepare salmon, and this was very flavorful! It's pretty rich, so next time I think I will cut the amount of butter in half. I didn't have garlic oil so I used olive oil instead. I served it with some seasonal veggies, but next time I'll try rice or pasta! Thanks for this fabulous recipe!

what made this so good was using all garden fresh and ocean fresh fish.  Every ingredient blended nicely.  Quality of ingredients would be important.

It was delicious My husband  loved it. My kids not so much but they are picky with fish. I added a bit of wine from another reviewer.  Next time I will try cilantro instead of parsley for that extra kick and heavy cream.

I enjoyed it but the next time I make this dish  I will add some white wine to the salmon or rice to make it a little more flavorful. I omitted the hot sauce too.

Use this recipe site all the time and have never written a review..Just got done trying this....LOVE IT!!!! I don't ever measure and all I changed was using canned diced tomato with green chiles.  I never cook anything new for my guy until I try it first.  Getting ready to make another batch for dinner!

Delicious !! I did change a few things though. After cooking salmon for two minutes on each side, I removed the salmon from the pan and threw in the tomatoes, lemon juice, and the garlic so the pan juices and browned bits would not scorch. I then peeled the skin off and chunked up the salmon and threw it back in,  lightly stirred, and allowed it to steam until the tomato juices were gone before adding the butter, parsley, ( i used cilantro ) cheese, and pepper sauce (i actually for got the pepper sauce). A quick stir to meld all the tasty goodness together and your done.

Wow, the flavors went together perfectly! I used fresh dill and dried parsley because that's what I had, as well as added garlic to the oil for lack of garlic oil. These changes would not have effected the flavor. Really really delicious!

I've made this twice in the past few weeks. The first time I pretty much followed the recipe - although I used olive oil, added extra garlic and used freshly grated Romano.  Everyone loved it. 

I made it again when I had some leftover sauteed spinach/onion with orzo. I cooked the salmon as above and then added the spinach/etc along with tomatoes. Another hit!

Thanks for sharing this great recipe. I mixed garden tomatoes, cilantro, onion, salt, pepper in my vitamixer & after cooking the salmon as per recipe combined ingredients & had over angel hair pasta, so good.

I made this recipe with a few alterations based on what I had on hand and also to limit fat and salt content.  But the other ingredients still made it very tasty.  My changes were: (1) olive oil plus some garlic instead of garlic oil, (2) a can of dice tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano instead of fresh tomatoes and additional garlic, and (3) no butter.  My wife and I both liked this.

Very nice.  One thing to consider however: The portions are generous.  If you are watching your calories I recommend making four servings out of the two the recipe says this makes.  I also reduced the amount of butter down to about a pat, used olive oil instead of garlic oil (not for dietary reasons, just because I didn't have any garlic oil on hand), and upped the diced garlic to about 1 1/2 tablespoons.

In that I was preparing the dish for very spice-sensitive family members I didn't add the hot sauce but instead gave them a side of hot sauce so that they could control the amount of heat in the dish (that seemed to work well).

Fantastic.  Increased the total volume of fish and tomatoes, used a bit more seasoning (my guest and I enjoy a very hot but balanced dish), and it turned out just right.  Very pleased with the flavor profile and delighted that so little prep could yield a dish this rewarding.

Delicious on its own, couple of changes to make it perfect.  We only use cherry tomatoes that we slice in half- makes a huge flavor difference. For the best flavors, use the fresh ingredients including fresh lemon juice.

The flavors of this recipe were really unexpected and lovely. I served the salmon with quinoa, and it was a hearty and filling meal. Looking at the recipe, I see how it can be adjusted to use canned salmon and tomatoes in the winter when fresh are not available. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is amazing!  My boyfriend and I are always on the prowl for new healthy recipes and this one hits the mark.  One quick note - the recipe didn't appear to specify whether the skin should be removed from the filet, however I assumed it needed to be because the salmon is cubed.  Therefore, we cooked the filets on medium, skin side down for a few minutes and then peeled the skin off.  It came off very easily that way.  Highly enjoyed this recipe - kudos!!

The title of this recipe does not do it justice!  This is so good, quick and easy which I love, and has wonderful flavor.  I made it as stated, and served it over thin spaghetti noodles.  So good!  I wasn't sure about breaking up the salmon, that seemed kind of odd, but that made it flavorful and juicy throughout.  Hubby would have preferred more hot sauce, so I will bump it up next time, and there WILL be a next time!  Yum!  Thanks for sharing!

This was my first time making salmon, and it was delicious! I scrapped the dill because I didn't have any, subbed hot pepper sauce for cayenne, and served it over fresh spinach instead of rice. So good!

I just finished cooking this dish and let me say it was great! My boyfriend is sooo picky when it comes to food. I just wanted him to taste a little before bed & he ate MY WHOLE plate. I served this over brown rice. This was actually my first time eating Salmon in my lifetime and it was so good! I didn't follow the exact seasoning measurementsI just added in how much I felt it needed (same ingredients though). I didn't have garlic oil so I used olive oil and diced up some fresh garlic. Did not have dill weed, did not miss it. Didn''t have paprika either, substituted for a bit of cayenne. No lemon juice, used lemon & pepper seasoning. Used olive oil as well, instead of butter. This turned out great. I've been buying fish lately hoping to find some good recipes and this one is great!!!

This was really good!  I didn't have garlic oil so I did 1/4 cup Olive oil with 1/4 tsp. minced garlic.  I also used 1 Tbl fresh chopped dill.  I only did 1/4 cup Parmesan because my husband doesn't love  when it is too strong in a dish, but he said I could've done the full amount and it would've been fine.  I did 1/4 tsp of the hot pepper sauce and it really wasn't spicy at all.  I could probably increase it next time.  My entire family enjoyed this dish and I will certainly make it again!

Great recipe!!!! Tastes very delicious! Didn't understand the value of the butter, so will not use it next time. Also, don't know what the "red hot sauce" is, so used Tabasco (it's red, and it's hot) :)  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This recipe was so good! The only things that I added was some old bay seasoning and about 1/4 cup of white wine. Then I just let everything simmer in the white wine until it was mostly evaporated. Turned out great!

Very good.  I used fresh basil instead of parsley because that's what I had.  Will definitely make again.

This was good but I feel like it could be better... I did add a small amount (1 tablespoon) of white wine, which really added a lot of flavor. This was a good new dish to try but next time I'll jazz it up a litt.e

Loved this! Easy, quick and a light dinner when accompanied with wholegrain rice and steamed asparagus (plus a bottle of wine for a little splurge). Made the same alterations as a few others: smashed up a few garlic cloves and cooked with plain olive oil, omitted the dill and hot sauce ( didn't have any on hand) and still came out lovely! Will definitely give this a whirl again. A big thumbs up from my better half too!

We really enjoyed this!  I used 1 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes with chiles.  Next time I make this, I will swap the butter for cream and serve over angel hair pasta.

This was my first experience cooking salmon. This really is a recipe worthy of 5 stars!. My husband said "we're keeping this one".  He wants to invite some friends over and have me make it again. A top restaurant quality recipe. Glad I tried it!

Very good, and it came together very quickly. I might add some more hot sauce next time (personal preference), but I loved that it was a quick and easy way to prepare salmon.

This was great! I did make a few changes but nothing that altered the recipe drastically. First I made couscous instead of rice and then used a can of fire roasted tomatoes instead of fresh. This dish was very good and will definetely make again since this recipe has such a great ease of execution. Thanks!

I enjoyed this recipes very much, but I did make some minor adjustments.  However, I must say the dish would probably have been just as yummy had I followed the recipe exactly.  Rather than breaking the salmon up and mixing it with the rice, I left the fish whole and served it over rice pilaf instead.  I accidentally left out the tomatoes and it was still delicious.  Two other small adjustments: I only sprinkled the finished dish with parmesan, rather than mixing in amount recommended; and I added a couple more dashes of hot sauce since my family loves heat!

I sauted some onion before adding my salmon. then used a can of italian style stewed tomatoes and no dill. OH MY this was the best salmon I've ever had. I paired it with long grain and wild rice and fresh roasted corn. My mother and I ate the whole pan. I will make this again and again and again. I have a new favorite salmon recipes.

Delicious! I am so glad that I tried this recipe. It was great  the first day, maybe even better the second. I did omit a few ingredients (parsley, butter and hot pepper sauce) for various reasons, and it was still great without them. I also used lime juice instead of lemon, as it is what I had on hand. I would also say, as another reviewer did, that the flavor of the mixture is the best when the salmon is flaked/chunked rather small. I served this one time rolled up inside wheat tortillas and it was yummy. It's juicy though so roll it up tight and be quick! It would probably also be tasty on good sub bread or noodles. More experimenting... Thanks so much!

AWESOME!  This recipe was outstanding.  I used pasta (good for gluten free pasta, comes out great), sauteed garlic in olive oil because I can't get garlic oil around here, and added about a cup of diced red peppers.  I will definitely add this to my collection of favorite recipes.

I left out the dill weed because I didn't have any and the flavor was great. I made again the next day, still w/o dill weed, adding chopped red and green pepper, and sliced grilled eggplant. A complete meal at one go. Easy and delicious.

This was a pretty easy recipe & tasted pretty darn good!  I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could!  Very nice ingredient combination.  Salmon comes out tasting great with no overwhelming "fishy" taste.  This is a keeper.  Recipe was followed exactly.  No variations.

Loved it!  Couldn't believe how great it tasted.  My husband, who is a great cook, could not stop raving about how good the flavors blend together.  Did everything exactly as the recipe stated, except I used powdered parmesan because that's all I have on hand.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Hubby and I really enjoyed this recipe.  Nice change since we usually use other recipes on this site and grill.  Didn't have fresh parsley so used dried and cut by half otherwise followed the recipe.  Definitely a keeper.

This recipe really surprised me! I am not a huge fan of salmon but have been trying to find ways to add it to my diet. This was super easy to make, but looked so sloppy I almost didn't try it. Boy am I glad I did! Delicious and it really doesn't taste fishy. I served it with quinoa and added some toasted pine nuts at the end. Yummy! The boyfriend (also not a salmon lover) also really liked it.

Not our favorite.  We agreed with some other viewers that this seemed a bit too bland.  It was WONDERFUL, however, the next day in an omelet with cream cheese!!  I would make it again just to have it in my omelets.

I love salmon so this is a great recipe. I have never actually made it like the recipe calls for exactly. I usually serve it over pasta and use butter and oil to make a nice sauce. I have also made it with chopped, drained frozen spinach that I throw in place of the tomatoes. I usually don't have dill so I will use Italian seasonings or salt and pepper works just fine with a ton of garlic.

This is so out-of-this-world good! You wouldn't think the combo of ingredients would result in something so delicious. Not low fat but hubby says "restaurant quality"! Use Frank's Red Hot Original (thanks for the tip, Cathy) for the right blend of flavor and kick.

My husband, three-year-old daughter and I really loved this dish.  It has such great flavor and is super easy to prepare.  I gave it five stars because it was great the day I made it, but even better reheated the next day.  Next time, I'll make a double batch to have plenty of left overs.  Also, I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I just used brown rice instead of long-grain white and also added a bit of extra parmesan (just because I love cheese:)

Super yummy way to cook salmon.  I served it over whole wheat pasta and left out the final sauce topping and it still tasted great.

Amazing! This had a great blend of flavors and cooked the salmon beautifully (even without the butter). I also paired the dish with zuchinni instead of rice. Thanks for the recipe!

Brace yourselves, fresh fish lovers. I actually used a can of salmon for this recipe. I took out the big bones and skin and was careful not to stir too much. I wanted a few chunks. It was so simple because I threw everything in my electric skillet at once. I added some capers as one other reviewer did. Excellent with tomatoes from my garden. My 5 year old daughter loved it! I'm making a double batch from now on.

This has become one of my favorite recipes.  Everyone who has tried it has lovvvvved it. . . and that includes my extremely finicky 8 year old.  She is the most difficult person in the world to please and she absolutely loves this dish.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This recipe has great flavor. To make it even tastier and healthier, try serving it over quinoa instead of rice. To make the quinoa, just melt a tablespoon of butter in a saucepan and add one cup of quinoa (make sure you bought drained quinoa). Simmer stirring it around for about five minutes.  Add 2 cups of chicken broth (or water) and bring it to a boil. Cover and simmer until all of the liquid is incorporated. Quinoa has a wonderful flavor that just adds so much to this dish.

OHMIGOD!!!  If I could give this 10 I would.  It was so good - actually kind of rich - not sure why - but a wonderful alternative to grilled fillets.  Hubby took leftovers for lunch the next day and he said it was even better reheated.  A keeper for sure!

This was very good--a nice change from typical baked or grilled salmon. It was saucier than I expected, and I didn't serve it with starch (not because I'm a carbo-phobe, but because I prefer to eat seafood with veggies), but I can see how this would be good over pasta, or even garlic toast for an upscale version of S.O.S.

This was outstanding! the only thing I did differently was to leave the piece of salmon in one piece - I didn't like the idea of virtually mashing it up. Husband loved it. Thanks so much!

The photo is misleading. you can clearly see a salmon filet and diced tomatoes mix on the side.
I seasoned salmon with salt, pepper, paprika and dill, then cooked until flaky. Set in oven to keep warm. 
Cooked garlic in butter, then added diced tomatoes, lemon juice, hot sauce, and parmesan cheese for few minutes.
Served tomato mix over salmon. 
gave 5 stars for the combination of flavors but 3 stars for recipe directions. averaged 4.

Made it as directed but without the dill (didn't have it) and it was OUTSTANDING!  Fresh, healthy, but rich tasting from the little bit of butter and the cheese.  I will be making this a lot.

Left off the dill as a matter pf preference and replaced the parsley with Italian parsley.  Also, didn't break up the salmon while cooking it.  Used regular canola oil with minced fresh garlic in place of the garlic oil, sautéed on both sides, then turned back to the skin side and cooked until firm and done.  Removed the fish, covered to keep warm. Scalded the tomatoes in the remaining oil, squeezed in the lemon, added the butter, hot sauce (liberally) and parsley (sort of like a Provencal garnish).  Brought the mixture to boiling, and spooned over the whole filets, then finished with grated Parmesan.  I made a Cajun style rice (chili powder, cayenne and chipotle) as a side, but next time will probably just stick to white rice or a simple pilaf.  The salmon really deserves center stage without any competition.

I’ve been making this nearly every week since the first time I tried this. It’s that delicious. I use cherry tomatoes cut in halves. Recently I’ve been adding chopped red bell pepper with the tomato. It gives it a crunchy bite but does not alter the main flavor. Today I tried it with diced yellow squash and added an onion along with the tomatoes. I think you could throw almost any vegetables in and still have a superb dish.

Mighty tasty! I just tried this recipe and the flavors turned out really well! I think the next time I do this recipe I won't break up the salmon to make the presentation cleaner, and I'll use a tablespoon less butter. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Delicious. Easy to make and a little different than typical salmon recipes. Just be careful it is easy to overcook

I did not have garlic oil, so I added crushed garlic into oil, also did not have fresh parsley, I substituted with dried parsley flakes, and this dish turned out very very tasty. I will definitely make it again. Awesome recipe, especially for the ones that are not very fond of fish as it tastes way better than boring fish.

I was doubtful, but it's SO good! I'm going to try and make it a little healthier next time (I halved the butter and it still tasted delicious). Also, I used a can of diced Italian style tomatoes because that's all I had on deck and it was still scrumptious :)

This is a VERY tasty recipe!  Ironically, it even appeals to people who aren't too fond of fish and/or tomatoes!  The only substitutions I made was a little cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce.  All I can say is I LOVE IT!!!

I made this last night for the family, it's a definite keeper for us.  The kids loved it! I changed a couple things, I keep the salmon whole versus breaking it up into pieces. I also used red pepper flakes instead of hot sauce.  It was refreshing and tasty great  summer meal.  I used brown rice  also.

I was a little confused at first because the picture showed a whole piece of salmon but the recipe called for breaking it up. I followed the recipe and was glad I did - it made a really nice hearty topper for the starch (I used pearl couscous instead of rice). Really enjoyed this dish and will definitely make again! So easy and quick!

Will make again. Was a definite hit. Seconds were requested!  Made minor adjustments for what I didn't have at the time. Didn't have fresh tomatoes, so put in one can of petite cut tomatoes straining juice off.  Didn't have dill and didn't substitute for it.  Chopped fresh garlic into olive oil since I did not have the garlic oil called for. Cooked salmon a bit longer than the recipe called for. Used my rice cooker, a real time saver. Guest liked the salmon cut into small portions. I liked that it was fast and uncomplicated.  The kind of recipe I could throw together never having made before and be fairly assured it would be okay to serve to a guest. It passed those tests and then some!

This recipe is a keeper! I used onion garlic stir fry oil, halved grape tomatoes, and green tobasco sauce. I also left out the  garlic and halved the butter. We had it over white rice but I imagine it would be delicious over angel hair pasta. The first bite earned an "oh wow " and the last bite a " you definitely have to make this again ".

This recipe was amazing!My husband and I both loved it, however, next time I think I will add another tomato, a yellow onion and a little white wine to brighten up the heavy cheese flavor and the thickness of the sauce. I definitely recommend this recipe as is though! I followed it exactly this first time and was not disappointed.

This recipe was very good, my husband enjoyed it and actually said he liked how the salmon was already chopped up in cubes.With the rice I toasted it a bit in about a tsp. of olive oil along with some chunks of onion and a garlic clove before adding in the water just so it could get a Lil more flavor. I also added a tbls 1/2 of butter to the rice along with a light amount of salt. With the salmon I followed the recipe but used olive oil and used a light amount of crushed red pepper flakes instead of the hot sauce that it says to use. I feel like this recipe was a bit different than how I'm used to normally eating salmon but it was good!

This is the first time I ever cooked salmon so I was a bit nervous thinking my family might not like it.  They  loved 
it!  I even liked it  and I'm not much of a seafood eater. 
I will definitely make this again and again.

I have to admit, I was skeptical about this at first.  I subbed regular olive oil and canned tomatoes because that's what I had and both my husband and I loved it!  This is a keeper. :)

After reading so many glowing reviews and I have an abundance of tomatoes coming in, this was a perfect time to try this.
I have to agree with some of the reviews that said this was bland. It was just missing something and I even added a couple spices to it like a few others did. It was so-so, I won't make it again.
Update: I have changed my mind about this dish. I tried it again and  it's pretty good but I do have to add more spices then what it calls for otherwise it is sort of bland. But, I think it's worth trying again.

Wonderful recipe!  Like another reviewer, I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used a drained can of diced tomatoes. Also used a minced garlic clove in olive oil.  I've made it a couple of times now and it's one of our favorite salmon recipes.

LOVED IT!!  Def a keeper recipe.  Quick and easy for sure.  Hubs and I will have this often.  Fresh tomatoes are the greatest, so its an awesome meal for summer time.   Looking forward to trying a richer sauce with the white wine/heavy cream recommendation, too!

It's a little more sour than I would like, but that could be tweaked. For me, the recipe is just so-so.

Wow, this was delicious! I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes; it created a sauce which was perfect over brown rice. There was a bit too much sauce for 2 salmon fillets, would have been perfect for 3.

I don't know how you could ever go wrong when garlic, butter, and tomatoes are involved.  This was really good and not too complicated.  It warmed up nicely in the microwave the next day on a half power setting.  I made a few substitutions to be able to use the products I already had on hand:  

1.  Used basmati rice, as I already had some made, and it was wonderful with this.  

2.  Diced a bit more garlic and sauteed it in olive oil rather than purchase a small bottle of garlic oil (with the same ingredients) for $7.00.  

3.  Used freeze-dried parsley so there would not be a lot of fresh that might go to waste.  

4.  Used fresh shredded, rather than grated Parmesan, because I already had some on hand.  

I tried this recipe with shrimp as well.  I cooked the (raw) shrimp almost done first, removed them from the pan, then added them back at the end.

This recipe is perfect as it is! Served it over Angel Hair pasta, with a side of broccoli with lemon-butter. Used the canned tomatoes (mild Rotel)and it was fine. Will make again and again! Thank you!

Surprisingly perfect! I thought it might end up in a disaster with such unusual combination of flavours, but it was DELICIOUS! Very well-balanced proportions of the spices/herbs. I followed the recipe to the point except i used a bit of chilli flakes instead of hot sauce bc thats what I had! Definately a keeper, thank you! :)

This recipe is delicious! I wasn't sure what to make of this seasoning combination but I made it tonight for my husband and he had three plates of it! I didn't change a thing other than doing what someone else suggested of crushing garlic into the olive oil since I do not own garlic oil and that worked just fine. This recipe is going into the regular rotation. Thank you!!!

I was surprised at how well this dish turned out. My husband was convinced I was ruining the salmon the whole time I was making it. But he had no complaints as he was eating it. I served it over white rice and every bite was eaten. Will definitely make again.

Awesome recipe!  Even my kids love it. I made it a little less fatty and omitted the butter and it still came out great.  Fresh tomatoes and parsley definitely make a difference for me but I have made this quickly before with canned tomatoes and dried parsley and the kids didn't seem to notice.

this was excellant. I made this last week and my husband who does not eat much fish has requested it again tonight.  A couple notes from last time that I will try tonight.  Remove the skin off the salmon before cubing.  I would like to find a way to have this flavor with a bit less calories but I do not know enough about healthy cooking to know what I can exchange at this point.  Between the butter, oil and parmesan cheese it seems like alot of calories but it is SOOOO GOOD that for tonight, I won't change anything.  For those who fear the hot sauce.  It is minor splash that enhances the flavor but there is no heat to this dish.  I can't eat hot foods so this was perfect for me.

Delicious! I've made it twice now (without the garlic oil, just don't have it), I love it, my not-a-fan-of-dill husband really enjoys it, and even my picky two-year-old will eat some of it.  Definitely a keeper.

While this did have a nice quality of flavors, it wasn't a favorite.  It really smelled and looked like restaurant quality food.  My hubby thought he would like his salmon left whole if we ever make it again.

This is soooo good. The ingrediants seemed a little wierd...but I am glad I trusted the reviews and gave it a shot! My only suggestion would be to use fresh dill and triple the amount...brings out that wonderful herb freshness and really compliments the salmon. I will be making this frequently.

This recipe was not for me! My boyfriend and I agreed it was too bland! However, I added a little too much salmon, which bombarded all the other herbs and spices! It just seems like there is something that should be added for a twist or tang! I will try again and play around with spices!

Really yummy.  I agree with a previous poster, it was quite rich, but the flavors were great - not bland at all, and it barely tasted like salmon - perfect for those who don't like the "fishy" taste.  We served it over brown rice.  YUM-O!

I thought this was great!  I served with pata and my husband who usually doesnt like fish said it was pretty good.  ( thats a compliment from him)  My daughter barely touched it but she is only nine and on a picky streak.  Thanks for something different!
