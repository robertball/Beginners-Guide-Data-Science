It's a nice and simple recipe, which I certainly appreciate.  I woud suggest being very careful about the salt and sugar (Splenda). I found that I didn't need nearly as much as was in the recipe. Be smart, start small and add to your taste.

I cooked it twice and both times it was freakin awesome. In addition to the salt and pepper I added cayanne pepper. Delish! Will make several times again.

I had everything in my kitchen so I thought I  would give it  a go. It was good really good!!!!! I may have put one or two more cloves of garlic in, but to be honest very very good easy recipe.

This recipe is soooo simple and it tastes amazing! There is a bit of a smell while cooking, but the end result is well worth it. I used real sugar instead of splenda, because I didn't have any splenda. I used about a half a cup total. I started with a quarter cup and added until the sauce tasted good to me. I cooked the chicken in about a quarter cup of chicken broth for the initial 25 min so it wouldn't get too dry. I also used chicken broth instead of the water that is called for in the recipe. The final result was tender and delicious! I will definitely make this again. The smell was minimal for how awesome the final product tasted : )

Thought I'd try because I love oysters and it sounded simple to make.  I only added about 1/4 cup of the splenda, luckily I tasted it before adding more because it was already VERY SWEET.  Something about the smell of this chicken dish cooking was just not right.  My husband couldn't stand to be in the kitchen and named the dish "stinky chicken".  Luckily it did taste better than it smelled, but not good enough to repeat.

This recipe is so delicious.  My family gave it 5 thumbs up and asked me to make it often.  The only change I made to the orginal was adding more garlic.. just a FEW extra cloves ;)

Fantastic, fantastic. Will make over and over again. Go slow adding sweetness to your taste. I did it as recipe called for and thought it was fine but for others it may be too sweet. Used the brown sauce to finish off my green beans so I wouldn't waste such a wonderful recipe.

have to agree with a few others - the oyster sauce was too smelly.  It was hard to eat with the aroma that felt like it should have been with seafood

I have made this several times and the family loves it.  I have to believe that 3/4 cup of sweetener is a typo though!  I find about 1 Tbsp is more than sufficient.  I also like to add a little sambol olek for heat and green onion for crunch at the end.

Very good. I also added more garlic and used brown sugar with good results. The second time I made it I substituted minced ginger for the garlic and it was equally delicious.

This was really good! I reduced the quantity to serve 3, and used honey as the sweetener.  I also had 2 small banana peppers, that i chopped into rings and a little jalapeno, i diced very small, along with extra garlic.  It was awesome! I also didn't need to use water at all.

A wonderful recipe!  I made it just as suggested, but used four packets of Splenda rather than 3/4 cup.  It was delicious, and I'll  make this again. Thanks!

Delicious and so easy. I did cut back on the sugar and added extra garlic as we are garlic lovers. I'll definitely do this again.

Made this by the directions except watched the sugar that went in.  This was a wonderful recipe that I will use over and over. Served with rice and made me feel like I was in a restaurant!  Thanks!
