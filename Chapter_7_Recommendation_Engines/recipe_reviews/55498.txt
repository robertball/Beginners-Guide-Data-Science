Portobellos are not so runny if the gills are removed prior to cooking.  Just scrape them out with a spoon. This is a quick and easy week night recipe.  Add a bit of fresh spinach or some canned artichoke hearts, halved grape tomatoes, cooked and crumbled Italian sausage, anything you like on a regular pizza. You can make it as healthy and low calorie as you like by adding or omitting ingredients.

I love portobello pizzas!  They are so good and give me a healthy alternative to satisfy my pizza cravings!  I cook the mushroom for 10 minutes at 400 degrees and then add the topping and cook for another 10 minutes.  Add whatever your favorite toppings are.  I added cooked broccoli the other day just for some extra veggie.  Delicious.  Update: After reading the reviews, a few people mentioned how watery the mushroom was.  A couple suggestions...DO NOT rinse your mushroom off under running water, mushrooms are very absorbent and will just soak up all that water.  Just take a cloth or paper towel and brush the dirt off the mushroom.  Also, try increasing the oven temp a little bit and cook the mushroom the first time around just a little longer to dry it out more.  The mushroom will always be a little watery, but hopefully with those tips it won't be as bad as some have posted.

to avoid a watery mushroom, cook longer (30 min) and hotter (425), turning over once. Add toppings and broil until the cheese melts.

If you remove the gills, scraping with a table knife first and then bake the mushroom cap gill side down for 5-8 minutes depending on the side, it reduces the wateriness. Then flip it, dry it out and carry on with your fillings as noted.d

Make sure to remove the gills of fresh mushrooms before cooking.  Added Parmesan cheese, and cooked for about 15 minutes--until the cheese came out with the golden spots (just like a real pizza).  Don't use too much cheese or sauce or it will overflow while cooking.  However, the sauce marinates the mushroom while cooking and it comes out with a delicious flavor!

These are wonderful!  You can't miss the step about baking the mushroom for a few minutes by itself before baking it with the added toppings.  I think that is why some people had issues with it being watery.  I know, because I missed that step the first time I made these!  Also, I made the rookie mistake of rinsing the mushrooms rather than just wiping them off with a damp towel!  They were still very good, though, and they have even been better since I realized my mistakes.  I topped mine with pizza sauce, mozzarella, and tri-color bell peppers.  Even my husband enjoyed them, and he is typically not inclined to enjoy anything unless it is meaty and greasy!

I thot these were great.  I changed the toppings to fit what I had on hand and I also used the tip from one of the reviews about crankin' up the heat a little at the first cooking of the 'shrooms. One more tip is, I pre-cooked them-gills down on a rack on a pan-once that first pre-cooking is done I then placed them gills down on a paper towel for a few minutes while I finished prep on the toppings. My hubby and I didn't find them to be too juicy at all. In fact he went back for seconds!

These were so easy and good that I had to write my first review.  I wiped them with a paper towel and used a spoon to clean out the cap of the stem and gills.  I then threw them on the grill flipping to get rid of any liquid.  Once I thought they were cooked enough I added my toppings.  Yumm and so easy!  I have a neighbor who loves to taste test any new recipes(or old for that matter) I try.  She loved it too!
Thanks for a great, simple recipe!

Excellent!  I marinated my mushroom in a bit of Italian dressing for a little extra flavor, and with a little cheese and tomato sauce, it was wonderful.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

This was an interesting and delicious departure from the same old sauteed mushrooms we always have with our Friday night grilled steaks. I removed the gills, but followed the recipe for the cooking time and temperature. Didn't use the pepperoni since this was a side dish for our steak.  Black olives, chopped onion and green pepper were a very nice mix of toppings.  I made extra, which Hubs requested be chopped up and made into a pizza omelet in the morning!  This was one of the more interesting things we've tried in awhile, both to eat as well as to include on the dinner plate for visual appeal.

I thought this was OK but not great. I have to agree with the other reviewer, who said they are difficult to eat. So, I'll probably not eat again. Sorry!

if you don't mind the slightly rubbery texture, these are great.  I also cooked the mushrooms for about 10 minutes prior to topping and rebaking in effort to minimize the moisture.  it seemed to work.  BABA BOOEY!

I made this as directed and thought it was pretty good. My husband wasn't so much of a fan. I think it's a great healthier alternative to eating regular pizza, so it's good in my book!

LOVED these! I scraped the gills out and baked gill side down for about 8 minutes to remove excess moisture. (then skipped the baking for 5 minutes part). I had red & yellow pepper, so I added those to the pizzas along with some fresh baby spinach. I wanted them vegetarian, so I skipped the sausage. What a great recipe and so versatile to whatever veggies you have on hand.....this is going to be the perfect summer recipe for us! Thanks for sharing!

Use the mushroom for the crust! Genius!!!
Used onion, garlic and green pepper in place of the olives to cut the sodium count a little and used turkey pepperoni.  Pretty darned good!!! :)

I'd give this a five if it werent so watery.  Delicious taste, easy, quick personal pizza.  Any ideas on how to dry out the mushroom a bit so it doesnt run all over the plate when you cut into it?

I have made these tons of times I love it!  I use cheddar cheese cause I prefer it over mozzarella. I also love green olives over black. My mushrooms are never watery. I rinse them then dry them that may be why. I was so happy to have this recipe b/c I got tired of grilled potabellas lol

really good. I followed the advice of not washing the shrooms, rather wiping them with paper towel. Baked for 10 mins, then added toppings. Not watery this way.

We make these regularly now! So yummy.  I usually lightly coat the top with italian dressing and bake for a few minutes cap sideup to soften and get some juice out.  I then lightly press a bit more juice out.  Then we top and finish baking.  doing this we have not had any that were too wet or slick.

D E L I C I O U S! I made these tonight and they came out phenomenal! I read other reviews and was concerned about the water. What I did was remove the stem and gills, baked on 425 for 20 minutes, and then layered on the sauce, cheese, a slice of salami and some pepperoni, then cooked it for an additional 15 minutes. It came out delicious, water was not an issue. It really took me back to one of my favorite pizza spots in San Diego. They've sense closed down because the owner passed away. I've never had pizza that fantastic again. This recipe HIT THE SPOT! Great. Would totally recommend. :)

I used pizza sauce as the recipe submitter suggested, I removed the gills, and had to sub garlic powder for the garlic because I used up my last one without realizing it. These were super tasty and a lot of fun to eat. Oh, and I used the mini pepperoni so that I could distribute them more evenly and they came in mighty handy for this. We enjoyed these and will make again. Thanks!

These were tasty, but they cooked up a whole lot smaller than I would have imagined.  I also would recommend rubbing some additional basil between your palms and sprinkling it into the pizza sauce before putting the cheese on it as some of the flavor somehow seems to get lost.  Comments about scraping out the gills first to allow moisture to drip out during the initial dome up/30-min baking are right on target.  As are comments to be sure to turn them upside down for a few extra baking minutes before putting on the toppings.  Also, I'd caution to be sure to use portobellos that are still young and, therefore, still curved like a little mini-bowl.  The toppings fall off and out of the ones that are flat.

I have learned that if you peel the outer skin of the portabello off it takes away the rubbery texture, and is easier to eat in a sandwich or a pizza.

Seriously delicious!!! I followed others advice and removed the gills from the mushroom and had no problems with the pizza being watery.  I have made this twice and both times were super tasty!

I have made this for many many years when I first discovered a similar recipe on the atkins website. If you are looking for a healthy and hearty pizza, definitely try this. You can play around with the toppings to your taste.

Loved these!  I'm on a low-carb diet and these really satisfied my craving for pizza!  Thank you so much for sharing the recipe!  I added diced bell pepper and a little bit of cheddar.

Everyone really liked this, even my eight year old.  We used pizza sauce and everyone put on their favorite toppings.  I used pickled garlic, cheese, green peppers and onion.  My daughter used cheese and pepperoni. Dad had pickled garlic, pepperoni, onion, green pepper, and cheese.  Will make agian!

This pizza was awesome and what a nice change of pace from regular pizza.  Certainly a lot healthier, too!  I used pizza sauce instead of spaghetti sauce and used closer to 1/4 cup per mushroom.  These would make great appetizers for a party.  Thanks so much KJones 27!

I am on Weight Watchers and the Simply Filling technique, so this recipe was perfect for me.  Unfortunately I didn't read all the reviews first but I did scrape out the gills, just to allow more room for toppings and glad I did.  However that being said, it was still watery...I followed the times and temperature to the letter.  In my next attempt, I will turn up the heat and pre-bake the mushroom caps for a few minutes longer, I will use olive oil and pizza spice instead of the more watery sauce and will experiment with a few different and additional veggie toppings.  This time I used lean deli thinly sliced ham for the meat and 1/3 cup low-fat mozza cheese, which for any WW people out there, amounted to two points on Simply Filling.  This was great...cured my craving for pizza and will most definitely be making this again.  And on a regular basis! :-)  
PS...hubby loved it, even though he only got a couple forkfuls...hehe  
Will need to make more next time.

The trick to keep the pizza together is to let it cool, almost to room temperature. Still warm but no hot spots. It stays together nicely. I dont precook the mushroom. I cook it on one of those Pizzazz Pizza Oven. IT makes great grill cheese too. U have to tweek the right time but still good

Great recipe! If you do the basic of heating of the mushroom first, you can change the stuffing/filling to suit your taste!!! 
  I try different sauces ie pesto's ,salsa and different paste to change the flavour. You can also use any toppings you like on pizza. Veggie to meat to cheeses- ect.Just use cooked meat.
 They are very filling!!!

Personal Portobello Pizza Haiku: "Good taste, but messy. Follow reviewers' advice. Doubt I'll make again." Scraped gills, patted dry, and baked shroom at 400 deg. for 10 min., then filled and topped w/ pizza goodies and baked another 20 min. Still a drippy mess to eat, so I think I'd just rather an English Muffin pizza w/ baby bellas on top instead; glad that I tried this recipe though!

I removed the gills as others recommended and baked the mushrooms longer before adding my pizza ingredients. They were tasty, but I feel like they need more spices and pizzazz next time ... that said, I will definitely try cooking them again and I will be more daring with my spices! UPDATE: I used pizza sauce and lots of diced red peppers under fresh mozarella slices - it was delicious!!!

I love this! I did marinate the portobello mushroom in Italian dressing and baked at 400 degrees. Also Added Canadian bacon. This my absolute favorite. Love it! Will be my new snack.

Good recipe, nothing can go wrong when it is applied as written. I use Portobello caps and the only addition I make is to add anchovies, I love them.

I use a grafefruit spoon to remove the gills, this also works on deseeding any fruit. Then i used my regular stuffed mushroom recipe.  Cook up a lb or more of Jimmy Dean hot sausage with cream cheese.  Stuff.
Of course do the regular drying out, can use olive oil on cap after the initial bake....this is so goo. Sprinkly the cheese of your choice on top after stuffing. I've used it all. Pepper jack, gouda, parmesan , . You can mix other things in the mushroom stuffing too...minced red onion, jalapeno relish, i love it hot and spicy with the 2. enjoy

I've made several "flavors" of portobello pizzas! They are limited only by your imagination. I've tried pepperoni, ham, veggie (onion/green pepper) and, roasted chicken with alfredo sauce rather than red, and, just a few days ago, with sliced, precooked chicken mozzarella garlic meatballs!  Here's the trick to to runny issue: Definitely remove the gills, but bake them on a rack rather than letting them sit directly on the baking sheet. Mushrooms DO weep, but if they don't sit in their juices while baking, they come out firm and delicious.

Read the reviews and the tips on removing gills and cooking it at a hotter temp for a longer time so that the portobello is not runny and thought I would give it a try. Really enjoyed this version of pizza and will definitely be making it again.

I did as others. Baked at 400. Did cap side down for 5 min, then cap side up for 5. Filled with sauce, cheese and pepperoni. The first time I only made one because I wasn;t sure if it would be good. Made 3 the next night. Very good. Next time I will try with Pesto.

I precooked the caps with the inside face down for 10 min in a 400 deg oven, then cooked at the same temp for 10 min. Used toppings of peppers, onions and black olives. A very good, light and low carb dinner.

Tried this a few times, great for South Beach diet fans. 
My final adaptation is an adoption of one or two of the reviews above.
1) Gill scraping vital, as it allows more toppings, and a drier pizza base.
2) Cook Portobello caps slightly longer to reduce water content
3) Add what you like on a pizza
4) be very careful of the cooking times suggested. If I cooked this for longer than 15 mins in my oven it would be a black dog biscuit. Oven thermometer is on my to do list:-)
Many thanks for this.

This was yummy... I was worried that I would never make it on a low carb diet but so far the food is not only creative by very tasty.  I put basil pesto instead of tomatoe sauce, some ricatta cheese, italian sausage, fresh motz cheese and some fresh grated parm cheese.. very tasty... i so forgot to add my fresh spinach.. I will for sure be making again.

These were awesome.  I have made them several times and they are a huge hit with everyone that has had them.  Highly recommend. You can "tweak" them with different toppings.  It's a great way to indulge without feeling like you have been bad.

Be aware that the mushrooms shrink about 40% during baking, so make sure you get enough to fill each person. This is a great low-carb alternative to regular pizzas. My parents and grandmother are in their 70s and 90s respectively, and it was a winner with them. I scraped the gills and baked upside down first to reduce runniness, as advised in other reviews.

I loved it!  it's like pulling the topping off of a pizza and eating it, except you feel full afterwards and have no nutrition guilt!

i followed the suggestions of some comments and removed the gills and precooked the mushroom a little hotter and longer.  i also sprayed the pan with a little olive oil cooking spray so nothing would stick.  my caps were pretty flat so the toppings ran off, but the cheese got crispy and delicious around the edges.  i topped mine with cheese and frozen italian style meatballs (microwaved according to directions and then sliced into 3-4 slices so they would lay flat).

We have used this recipe several times since we saved it. Each time it provided a great snack or lunch. The flavor profiles of the various ingredients when added together are amazingly delicious.

Delicious! I made quite a few changes though because my favorite pizza is the "Gourmet Veggie" from a famous pizzeria so I decided to take that route.  Based on prior reviews, I scraped the gills out and roasted for about 7 minutes on each side before putting the toppings on.  Mixed some red bell peppers, yellow squash, and vidalia onion with a little olive oil and kosher salt and roasted for about 10 minutes.  Used Ragu Alfredo Sauce seasoned up with some some minced garlic, garlic powder, dried basil, dried oregano, black pepper, red pepper flakes. To top, I started with a layer of mozzarella, then some chopped marinated artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, yellow squash, onion, spooned some of the Alfredo sauce over the veggies.  Added another layer of mozzarella and topped with a few pieces of sliced black olives, and a sprinkle of grated parmesan. Popped back into the oven on 375 for about 10 minutes.  Outstanding! This recipe would be great with any of your favorite toppings.  Next time I'll try it the way it was written.

Love it!  What a healthy alternative.  I used pizza sauce, onions, red peppers, chopped pepperoni and mozzerella cheese.  I followed the suggestion of someone who baked the mushrooms themselves at 400 degrees for 10 minutes and then again loaded for another 10 minutes. YUM!

This recipe was so delicious and simple.  I made it for the family using 5 mushrooms and multiplied the recipe by 5.  The only change I made was to use turkey pepperoni as I am on Weight Watchers.  Each pizza was 5 plus points.  I served it with fresh crusty bread.  It felt like I was dining at a cafe.  This is definitely going in my rotation for simple and yummy dinner.

My mom actually turned me on to these a long time ago, and they are great! This recipe is so versatile and really allows you to add any toppings you like or have on hand. This is a great low-carb dinner paired with a nice big salad, but I've also served these as a side dish too. YUM, YUM, YUM! :)

This recipe is AWESOME and perfect for low-carb eaters.  I agree with others that you need to remove the gills first and the perfect kitchen gadget to do this is a melon baller.  I made it with sauce, fresh chopped spinach and basil (from the garden), diced tomatoes, crumbled turkey sausage (Jimmy Dean makes it already cooked and crumbed!) and feta cheese.  Yummo!

I  LOVE this recipe! I have Celiac disease and can't eat anything with gluten in it (bread etc.). This is a great idea that I first saw in a health food store and went looking on the internet for a recipe, this is so convenient for me being I am the only one in my  house that has Celiac so I can make an individual serving.

I followed a reviewer’s advice and cooked the oil coated mushrooms and the diced up stems alone at 425 for about 15 mins with the bacon, sausage and bell peppers I topped them with on another rack I’ve the oven. Took them out and blotted up the juices. Let it cool a min while I was dicing up the cooked bacon and bell peppers and ham. Added pizza sauce,cheese, veggie layer, small sprinkle of cheese and my bacon, ham and sausage layer. Cooked it at 325 for 10 mins, pulled out and dashed Parmesan over it and cooked it for another 7 mins. Let it cool for 10 mins. Deeeee-lish. Sunday is pizza night, my kiddos still get the bready goodness, but the missus and myself have gone keto once more. Great idea and inspiration! Will be doing this again.

Tried this last night. I did scrape out the gills and cooked for 5 min at 400. I made an Alfredo sauce and mixed leftover hamburger with bell pepper. Added crumbled bacon and Parmesan/sharp cheddar cheese. baked for an additional 12 mins. Not the healthiest, but ooohh so good!

A flood on the pan and a flood in our mouths! Like other reviewers, we had some sopping wet shrooms, but unlike some others, my family loved the surprising bursts of juice and flavor that came flowing out of these Personal Porto Pizzas. Pepperoni, pickled pepper, pineapple, and potato all combined to round out my now soon to be famous Quintuple P gluten free pizzas. Thanks for the awesome inspiration!

My husband loved these. I did bake at 400 and pre-baked for only about 5 minutes. Small pepperoni were easy to distribute and crisped up nicely. Another reviewer mentioned adding a few fresh spices (basic) to brighten it up a bit, I will try that next time.

Amazing! i wasn't too concerned with them being watery... somehow to me it seems like a sign of fresh mushrooms. i used pizza sauce instead of spagetti sauce. I have been on the hunt for Portobello recipes and this is definitely going on my favorite list! i put the cheese down before the sauce... that may have helped the moisture levels... regardless, i will be recommending this to everyone i know! Thank you!!!!

This is an excellent recipe. I gently scraped the gills out and patted my mushrooms dry with a paper towel after rinsing them off before preheating. My family and I have one more tasty, healthy, quick, easy and inexpensive anytime option thanks to this.

Deliciousness is all I can say. I veganized is by using vegan ?? mozzarella cheese and instead of using pepperoni ?? I used Beyond crumbles.  I also added red onions.  This is my new go to when I want pizza without the carbs.  A must try.

Portobello pizzas are a wonderful idea and they do taste well. It takes prep, like scooping out the gills and  choosing the right kinds of toppings. It  takes  time, but what does not take time and is worth the work? Still tinkering with  the ingredients, but this is a n excellent  choice for a quick pizza.

Marinate in balsamic &  Italian seasoning. for 30 mins. Avoid watery mushrooms: cook longer - 30 min. and hotter - 425, turning once.  Add toppings & broil til cheese is melted.

I forgot to put in the Italian Seasoning, but it was still delicious. I made two for myself thinking just one wouldn't be enough. I was wrong. I was full off of just one of the pizzas. Can't wait to make it again!

I make aluminum foil rings to place my mushroom caps on before baking. Keeps them from being soggy. My husband loves these. We pile on all kinds of toppings. Great, low carb pizzas we have often.  I use Pizza Quick sauce and all our usual toppings, topped off with pizza cheese

This was delish. I didn't use pepperoni or black olives. I mix ricotta cheese, garlic powder, and Italian spices into pizza sauce then put on portobello mushroom with mozzarella cheese.

Putting the portobello in the oven for 5 minutes to start flattened it. I would re try this, by topping it and wrapping in foil and then putting in for 15 minutes.

I used regular pizza sauce, added minced garlic to it, used green olives, thats all I had. Added thinly sliced red onion. Really, you can do anything. Baking prior to afding toppings is key. Cant wait to eat it again ??

Absolutely delicious! Even better the second day. I used sweet Italian sausage instead of meat in recipe and I made my own pizza sauce which is under Easy Pizza Sauce on this site. Easy indeed and cheap! It was good on day one but excellent on day two!

I love making these! Satisfies my craving for pizza.  I also baked my mushrooms for about ten minutes before adding toppings. I also made a few changes to the recipe. I used pizza sauce instead of spaghetti sauce and used much less cheese. I love that you can really make this your own. Yummo!

Wish I would've looked to see how to make these without them being so runny before making them, but I probably should've added a bit more salt and Italian seasoning...but overall fairly good and easy to make

Not bad. A little runny, and I used chicken on top instead of the toppings she suggested.  I'd cook it longer next time but not bad, I did take out the gills as well. Better texture that way.

I am a vegetarian so I am always looking for easy recipes like this one, and it was great! I topped mine with a jarred mushroom marinara sauce, low fat shredded mozzarella, and peppers. I can't wait to try it with pesto.

This is SUCH a keeper! Loved it... Obviously the intent is to make a pizza with your own favorites, so don't be shy. I used red onions, bell pepper, jalapeno, green olives, pepperoni and a garlic and I was very, very pleasantly surprisedYum, yum, YUM!

Delicious! What a great way to use portobellos! Be sure to wipe your mushrooms with a clean cloth - don't run them under water. That may be the reason for the wateriness some people complained about. I didn't have that problem, but also I left them in the oven longer than five minutes the first time around. I basted them with a little bit of olive oil before they went into the oven, too. Yummy!

This is a really good idea, especially for me I am diabetic and try to watch those carbs, and I adore mushrooms...Thanks so much for the idea.
