I made this for dinner last night & it was really good.  I thought that 1 1/2 cups of salsa seemed like a lot, but it's not.  Also, even using the medium salsa, it was not too spicy.  It's a great way to use up stale saltines, too.  I found that a cup of crushed saltines is about half of a sleeve of crackers.  My husband poured extra salsa on top.  Very easy.  I will make this again & may even add a can of chopped chiles.

Followed the recipe the first time I made this.  I didn't care for the salsa in the meatloaf.  The next time I made it with Rotel tomatoes, and added onion and 2 teaspoons of chili powder, also added a little garlic salt.  This gave the meatloaf more flavor.  I also add more cheese.

This is a great recipe.  It's easy and a real crowd pleaser.  I have since been asked for this recipe from my sister, my mom, and even my grandmother.  It's that good. I sprinkled cheese and poured a strip of salsa along the top 10 minutes left in the cooking time to make it look even better.

A GOOD MEATLOAF! I will be using this recipe from now on. I did add about 1/2 cup of bell pepper(my husband says it's not meatloaf without it). I think it might need a small amount of salt, but it is a snap to prepare! I shaped it in a casserole dish so it would brown-and it came out just right.Thanks, Katthy, you have a winner here!

Great recipe.  Made it today.  I used 1 3/4 pound ground meat, and used Rotel (1 and 1/2 cans), and Multi-grain Club Crackers, and the other items (little bit more cheese, but only one egg).  I also added some extra cheese in the last 10 mins.  I thought it was going to be too moist, but turned out really great!  Cooked it about 1 hour 15 mins.   

Will be making this again!

Meatloaf in my world is akin to frozen fish sticks...yuck.  However, I really really liked this!  I followed the recipe exactly (a rarity for me) other than I made it in muffin form (still baking at 350, but for about 35 min, until temp reached 160).  The texture was a *little& "mushy" on the inside (I kept double checking temp to make sure it was really done), but the flavor is excellent!  I WILL make this again.  And again.  TY!

I kicked it up a bit at the end. Once it was done cooking I topped it with a mixture of 3T ketchup and 
1T Srirracha and then browned it under the broiler. I also used a mixture of a 4-cheese Italian blend and Sharp Cheddar instead of the cheese called for as that was what I had on hand.

This recipe bailed me out of a meatloaf emergency the other night. I went to make my usual recipe from this site (mini meatloaves) and discovered unwelcome 'visitors' in my container of  oats, YUCK! Then searched 'meatloaf' and luckily found this recipe which I had all the ingredients for, whew. Everyone liked it for a change and I will put it in my usual rotation. As always, I prepared it as directed which is the only fair way to rate a recipe the first time! Thanks!

I added 1 cup of the salsa to the mixture and put the remaining 1/2 cup over the top of meatloaf before putting in the oven. Instead of adding saltine crackers, add the same amount of Tortilla chips for that extra mexican flair!! This also makes the meatloaf  Gluten Free!

I made this recipe but used sharp cheddar instead of monterey jack.  It was great!  My husband loved the twist and the salsa taste.  It is a lot more moist than traditional meatloaf, but it absolutely delicious!

I prepared exactly per recipe.  It was fabulous!  My husband is the worlds biggest food critic, preferring everything to be "gourmet"... and he loved it!  My 2 year old loved it.  My picky 4 and 6 year olds didn't.  BUT...I will definitely make it again since hubby raved about it!  Delish!

To deal with some of the excess liquid, I put the salsa in a strainer while getting together the remaining ingredients.  That seemed to help make a more firm meatloaf.  It was a nice bit of variety that everyone enjoyed.  Great with cornbread and mexican sour cream rice (from this site).

I have been making my meatloaf this way for years.  I don't use the cheese and add Worchestershire and Franks Redhot sauce.  I also throw it all in a ziplock bag to mix...hands stay clean and just toss in the trash when done.

Awesome!  I've never been a meatloaf fan but this is really incredible.  The most moist meatloaf I've ever eaten.  The salsa makes all the difference.  I've tried  this with different cheeses and I'm going to bake this next one wrapped in bacon!  And the leftovers make the BEST meatloaf sandwiches!!

I used ground turky and bread crumbs because they were on hand and it came out very good. It was a bit moister than I expected so I cooked it an extra 15 minutes for good measure. Will definitely make again and maybe try with hot salsa next time :)

Very tasty but very moist.  In fact if you are making this for someone who has issues with lack of texture it may be too moist.  I will make this again but I think I will use bread crumbs rather than crackers.

I love meatloaf with salsa. I can my own from vegetables in my garden, then in the winter use the salsa in my garden meatloaf on this site. It tastes so fresh! Thanks for the idea with the monterey jack cheese! VERY GOOD!

This has got to be one of the best meatloaf recipes I've had the pleasure of eating!  Really!  My hubbie took ALL leftovers with him to work the very next day and what he didnt eat at work he brought home later and ate after our regular meal for his "nighttime snack".  Plan to use this recipe everytime I make meatloaf in the future!

This was the simplest and best tasting meatloaf I've ever eaten.  I had to substitute couscous for crackers because that was the only starch I had and it was still delicious.  What I liked best was that I could taste the flavor of the beef itself, not onion soup mix, or any of the other typical seasonings.  BRAVO!  Even Mr. Picky (my husband) liked it - he said it was "pretty good" which is high praise from him.

Great meatloaf with just the right amount of 'bite'  I used pepper jack, and added some minced onion and bell pepper.  Can't wait to have it on a meatloaf sandwich tomorrow -YUM!

The very  best meatloaf I have ever made, and I have made quite a few from this website.  After reading reviews, I was afraid of the loaf being mushy, so I used 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef and kept the rest of the ingredients the same, and it turned out moist and did not fall apart.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe! *****Second time around*****I chopped jalepeno peppers and used all pepper jack cheese--Now it has some bite!  Yummy!

I've hate meatloaf since I was a child but I make it because my family likes it. I have to say this is the only meatloaf I like I tasted it just to see if I could choke it down and I hafta say I will be having a second helping tonight

I was cautious about this recipe at first, since it has no salt, garlic, pepper, or any other spices in the recipe. But I made it to the letter, and it was great! It came out very flavorful and moist, and it made plenty for two plus leftovers. It's very simple and totally idiot-proof! Try this one tonight.

Very good. Needed more seasoning. The best thing I have learned from watching a cooking show is to make a small patty after putting ingredients together & cook to see if taste is to your liking.

This was delicious!  The salsa made it spicy, something that seemed to be missing in my other meatloaf recipes.  I will definitely make this again.

This is yummy, affordable as well as easy. I have made this a good dozen times with all deferent salsas and it never disappoints. I have even used a bit of spaghetti sauce once when I did not have the full amount of salsa on hand and it was still great. I do add a bit more crackers than the recipe calls for and it is still VERY moist. I serve it with oven baked crispy potatoes and a side salad. Prep time is as easy as mixing one bowl and patting into a loaf pan. Hard to believe how far a pound of beef with go! My kids love it too.

I followed suit with others and added remaining salsa and cheddar cheese last 10 minutes. Hubby went back for seconds. 19 years of meat loaf and never seen that! Highly recommend.

This meatloaf had wonderful flavor but was way too "wet".  Pretty much fell apart when trying to cut.  I will try it again but will cut down the salsa to 1 C.  and will drain it before adding to the meat mixture as other posters have suggested. Otherwise very good!

Very good, . . . I replaced the ground beef with ground turkey and used no fat saltines, reduced fat parmesan cheese and low fat Monterey Jack cheese to lower calories. Delicious

De-lish! This was excellent! I added a little garlic powder, onion salt and fresh ground pepper. Baked 1 hr and 10 min, still very moist. Oh and I added more salsa to the top for the last 10 minutes as another reviewer suggested. I think 5 words can sum this up...he went back for seconds! Thanks KATHYC4!

Normally I'm not a big meatloaf fan, but this was delicious! Mt salsa was chunky and had corn in it. This came out spicey and so moist! It is my favorite meatloaf so far! Thanks for sharing! We all went crazy over it!

This was a very good makeover for regular old meatloaf! I made a few changes based purely on what I had available in the pantry to make this... I used canned tomatoes with green chiles instead of salsa and bread crumbs in place of the saltines. We will definitely be making this recipe in the future. My husband had the leftovers wrapped in a tortilla with lettuce and sour cream the next day and loved it just as much! Thanks for sharing!

As good as it can get for a different twist on meatloaf.  I followed the recipe, but did as others suggested and added a little more spice; ie, a little bit of taco seasoning.  I used a muffin pan and baked little meatloaf balls in that at 350 for 35 mins.  It was moist but not 'wet'.   Surprisingly really good!  Served with Mexican rice and a salad it was a tasty meal.

I am a single guy and this recipe never fails!  I make it in 5 small 2" x 5" loaf pans and freeze `em.  I have also used cheddar cheese and mozzerellain it, and have used generic "cheese crackers"  GO FOR IT, this recipe is MOST EXCELLENT!

Mixed reviews in my house.  Hubby didn't think it had much flavor.  Son and I liked it.  It made a moist flavorful meatloaf.  Will make again.  Possibly in place of cracker crumbs next time will use tortilla chips or corn chips crushed to add a little more mexican flavor.

I hate meatloaf, but my husband LOVES it. I decided to look for a different kind of recipe to try when i found this one. it was awesome! the only problem i had was it needed a little more time to cook all the way through.  I find it a great recipe to make when i don't really feel like cooking.

Yum! I had 2 pounds of very lean ground beef thawed so I used that. I didn't exactly double the recipe, but I did add more of everything. Didn't have saltines so I used my homemade WW bread crumbs, yum!! Cooked it in my Pampered Chef mini loaf pan so it made 4 mini meatloafs. Took it out at about 35 minutes. Delish!

It was very good. My husband gave it two thumbs up and he isn't a big fan of my cooking. I used 2 pounds of meat and it was not mushy. It helps to add a little bit more of the breadcrumbs to bind everything together.

Wow! Good stuff! I used Pace's "Fire roasted corn & black bean" salsa and added some diced onion & green pepper. My family was SO pleased - even the picky people liked it! This recipe is a keeper!

This meatloaf is different than any other I've tried. I was pleasantly surprised. The leftovers (assuming you have any) can be used in a variety of ways. We made sandwiches, tacos, and taco salad. I used home made salsa, green chilies, and extra shredded cheese because I omitted the parmesan.

This was a great alternative from having "regular" meatloaf. I did make a few alterations: I used ground buffalo instead of the ground beef, also I substituted the salsa for 1 can of rotel and added some onions and garlic to the mix. It took 20 mins longer than the bake time mentioned and I did need to drain it halfway through, but my family loved it and not a single leftover! Definitely will make again!

I just got married and am making new meals for the first time for my husband.  This was my first attempt at meatloaf ever, and it turned out great!  The recipe was easy to make and my husband loved it.

Fantastic! I used about 1.5 pounds of ground beef, Pace Chunky Salsa (Medium Hot) and Pepper Jack cheese. Since I used a little extra meat, I utilized an entire package  of ground up Saltines and a heaping 1/4 Cup of the Parmesan and Peper Jack Cheese.  Very tasty.

This was a great spin.  I substituted the sweet heat chipotle sauce instead of the salsa and added grated cheddar.  My son loved it and he doesn't like meatloaf.  I will make this again for sure.

This was good, but not spectacular. It didn't bowl everyone over. I used a mixture of colby and jack cheeses and used one sleeve of buttery round crackers, as that's all I had on hand. 
It went really well with the Mexican Sour Cream Rice.

Neither myself nor my husband liked this recipe. Although it's an easy recipe, it was rather bland and tasteless. I think it must be the salsa I used. I'll use the leftovers to make a taco salad!

I made this last night. Really quick & easy. I thought it might need salt, but it was perfectly seasoned. I used Provolone instead of jack cheese, because it was all I had, but it was delicious. Next time I will be sure to try it that way, too. Also, I might try shaping it into a loaf in a roasting pan, so the top had a browner, more attractive appearance. But the texture and flavor were wonderful. I will be making it again.

I made too much!  Doubled the recipe, so it had to cook longer.
It was too spicy for me, but my man is Texmex, and he LOVED it.  Will make again.

I'm not a big meatloaf fan but my husband and I both liked this quite a bit.  I did have to wonder though if the meat should have been 1.5 lbs and the salsa 1 cup.  This was so moist, I had to put it in a loaf pan to bake, and even more moist after baking because the liquid couldn't escape. We had to spoon it out of the loaf pan, this was not firm enough to slice.

I used turkey instead of beef, WW bread crumbs instead of saltines, extra cheese, and cooked in a square pan for 35 minutes.  Very tasty!  I can't deal with very spicy food, and usually buy mild salsa, but decided to try this with medium.  It gives the dish just a touch of spiciness. A new favorite!

I made this exactly as directed, but topped with additional salsa and monterey jack for the last 3 minutes in the oven. I didn't realize how strong the salsa taste would be (maybe it was the brand I used, not sure), but had I known, I would not have topped with more salsa...Overall, this is a good recipe. Mine came out a little mushy, but pretty good.

This was a very delicious yet simple cuisine for the whole family.  And it's a good recipe for kids to work with.  I substituted medium salsa to a plain tomato sauce or flavored spaghetti sauce, which tasted better for those who are not fond of chillies.  I only used Monterey Jack and made a little over half cup of it. I made use of Sunflower crackers instead.  I guess the crackers were to substitute bread crumbs.  I had my kids add the cheese, the crackers, the sauce onto the mixture, and watch the time til it's baked.  After exactly an hour, it's chow time.  I served it with buttered mix veggies, which everybody just loved even the pickiest eater.  The loaf came out so tender and juicy.  It was a very delectable meal!!

This was really good. I've made it a couple of times and used corn bread stuffing mix instead of the saltines one time, another time I used bread crumbs. In both cases it was because I didn't have any saltines and just used what was on hand. The cheese and salsa both add excellent flavor.

Pretty good meatloaf!  I don't really care for meatloaf, but my family loves it.  So when I do make it, I try to use new recipes.  This one tops them all so far.  My husband suggested to layer meat then more cheese, then meat, cheese and so on.  I will try it that way next time. I will definately use this recipe again.  Thanks!

I'm not generally a big meatloaf fan, but this is delicious! I was running a little low on salsa so I added a small can of chopped green chilis for volume. After cooking we topped with more salsa - it was so yummy! I'm going to make it again tonight, this time I think I'll add some chopped jalapenos :)

This is an easy and great new taste in meatloaf. I added a new twist that some of you might enjoy. Instead of baking this recipe in oven, I smoked it in my Brinkman smoker with mesquite wood. I placed meatloaf (out of loaf pan, upside down) on top rack in smoker until thermometer read 160 degrees, about 1hr.

I'm not a big meatloaf fan, which is a bit ironic, bc I've always made my own version of it that my family loves.  I thought I'd try this one for a change.  I subbed plain shredded wheat for the crackers just to get rid of the shredded wheat, and it worked well enough.  I used 3 of the big pieces of shredded wheat.  I didn't really measure any of the ingredients, and added some garlic, onion powder and taco seasoning.  After it tested done, I topped with some more salsa and cheese then broiled for a few min to melt the cheese.  Success!  I didn't mind it--I like the salsa flavor--and bf had two big helpings.  Only issue I had was that it was a bit too moist and crumbly, so a bit difficult to serve.  But I think that's my sub of shredded wheat--I've always used saltines before in meatloaf and they bind a bit better.  Thanks for the recipe!

I am a food service director for a christian school and college and we feed the church people every Wednesday night so I was a little nervous about stepping out, meatloaf is one of my favorite meals and my family ahs made alot of meatloaves but we have never put cheese in the recipe before but let me just say that we had about 15% of the people that ate this meatloaf say it was the best they have ever eaten.Many people had said thay would use only this recipe next time. So thank you to the one who created it.

This was an AMAZING recipe. I like meatloaf and I make an Italian version but this was so good and easy! I read the other reviews and decided that the salsa amount was off. I used a cup of salsa, Kashi TLC crackers, and no cheese (I'm watching my weight). I cooked it a little too long but it was still really good!

This recipe was so easy.  I am far from being a cook.  I decided to come on this website to try to surprise my husband with an actual meal.  I invited my mother-in-law and they both LOVED it.

I added more crackers like others suggested but it was still pretty soft and crumbly.  We weren't overly impressed with the taste although it's still better than plain ole meatloaf. Needed more spunk to earn 5 stars from us!

A little soft, but a great taste. I added a half a packet of onion soup mix. I have made this recipe several times always with compliments.

This recipe is a nice change to ordinary meatloaf.  Definitely worth a try.  Love the zip from the salsa.  Could use more salsa and cheese on top 5 mins before done baking.

Best.Meatloaf.Ever!!!  Moist, flavorful. Did modify a little. Used 1 1/2 lbs. burger, 2 eggs, about 1/2 cup Jack cheese, no Parm. and 1 c. bread crumbs. I used my home made canned salsa. A huge hit with us all, and my daughter doesn't usually like meatloaf. This will be a regular feature.

I liked the flavor of this meatloaf, but mine was a little loose. I should have added another egg or more crumbs. Next time hope it turns out firmer. Very good flavor, definitly worth a try. I used home canned salsa.

This was a really good recipe!  I used 99% fat free ground turkey instead of beef, canned diced tomatoes with green chiles instead of salsa, and seasoned the turkey before adding the other ingredients.  I also added frozen onions, celery, and bell peppers.  I'm lactose intolerant so I omitted the mozarella and just plain forgot the egg.

Even with all my modifications this turned out delicious.  It was "wet" but after baking for 30 mins I poured out the extra liquid then let it bake again for about 20 more mins.  Turned out firm and tasty!

Definitely will try again.

My family loved this recipe.  I doubled it to make two loaves that I put side by side in a 9 x 13 baking dish. I also used 1 pound ground turkey and 1 pound ground beef. I also added sauteed onion and garlic, 1 tspn oregano, 1 tspn ground cumin, and 2 tspn all season salt.  I also substituted Rotel tomatoes and used half monterey jack cheese and half taco blend cheese.  I also sprinkled some extra cheese on top during the last 10 minutes.  It was really tasty!

Very good recipe. The amount of salsa was just perfect, and kept the meat from drying out. If you don't like salsa, then don't make this recipe. Other reviewer complained that it tasted like taco meat...well, the salsa makes it that way! I did add a couple of shakes of chili powder and garlic powder to my mixture for added flavor. Great! I make this every two weeks and we devour it. It's the only meatloaf recipe that my husband will eat.

I didn't have as much Salsa as needed for this recipe. So I improvised, using taco seasoning in the meat mixture and mixing the little bit of salsa I did have with a ketchup, mustard, brown sugar and taco seasoning concotion. MY family ate every last bite and with three kids and a finicky fiance that's saying something.

I wasn't a huge fan of this one. I only used 1 1/4 cups of salsa and it still seemed like too much. With only using 1 lb. of meat and so many other ingredients, you kind of lose your "meat" in your "meatloaf".

This is a keeper I added more hamburg and mine held together beautifully.  I also tend not to be such a big measurer so I none of my measurements were exact.  I also followed other advice and added some cumin and chili powder for some extra flavor.    I fed 7 kids and everyone but 1 loved it and asked for seconds.  When I can please this many kids you know its good.  I made two loaves and only a sliver was left sadly none for leftovers the next day.

A great meatloaf recipe.  We make it with Parmesan cheese instead of the Monterey Jack and extra spicy chunky salsa.  Very tasty.

My husband had no idea that I was trying a new recipe and out of the blue said, "This is the best meatloaf I have ever had in my life!".  I was very pleased at how fast and easy this was to prepare for such a response.  I used a little over 1 cup of whole wheat saltine crackers instead of chips and added a little tabasco to spice it up a little more.  I also used a 1/2 cup of a parmesean/romano cheese blend and 1/2 cup of a mexican cheese blend for the cheeses because that's all I had.  It was delicious and I will certainly make this recipe again.

I made this last night.  I did make some alterations based on other reviews.  I added about 1/2 C onion & green pepper, taco seasoning, used doritos instead of crackers and used about 1/2 c mexican cheese blend.  It was falling apart - but i did add extra doritos because it did seem somewhat "wet".  Next time I will just decrease the doritos.  The husband loved it.  We don't usually do left overs -- but he wrapped it right away wanting to finish it!  Thanks!

I used crushed Doritos and added taco seasoning.  Great flavor but didn't quite hold together very well.  We will be making this again, thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe with all the advice from all the other comments.  I cooked it at 400F for just over an hour, added chili pepper, garlic and tortilla chips and "tried" to roll the cheese (it didn't work for me) and this recipe was great!

I made some small changes. Instead of saltines I used crushed doritos to give this some extra flavor. I also didn't mix the cheese in with the meat. Instead I spread the meat mixture into a rectangle, sprinkled the cheese on top and then rolled jelly roll style pinching the ends closed. This created beautiful circular pieces with a lovely spiral running through them. Will make again, especially since it freezes well.

This recipe was good, but wasn't a home run with my family.  My boyfriend liked it better than my 8-year old son - he said there wasn't enough flavour.  I enjoyed it okay.  I used oatmeal instead of the saltine crackers or tortilla chips as some others have suggested, and that may have been why it turned out bland.  Perhaps more spices would have helped.

This is really a wonderful meal.
My fiance thought it was the best meatloaf ever.  I will make this on a more regular basis.  It couldn't be any easier to make either.

I love this recipe.  I've made it several times, and never had it come out wrong.  Be careful not to overcook, with all the cheese the texture is a little different that one is used to in "regular"  meatloaf.  I also like to use spiced crutons instead of crackers.

Very versatile recipe here kids. I had pretty much none of the ingredients in my house, except for the salsa. Here's what I used: ground veal-pork-beef; hot salsa; parm cheese; aged wisconsin cheddar (all i had!); an egg; crushed soy crisps which are like fake potato chips for us low carbers; and I added a bunch of seasoning...garlic, red pepper, chilli powder, black pepper. It was so easy and so deeeelish. The leftovers will go great in a tortilla tomorrow with some mexican cheese, lots more salsa and sour cream. My finicky daughter was diggin' on it as well. Great recipe you can do whatcha want with..enjoy! And thanks for sharin' Katthy.

I took the suggestions of the others and used crushed chips. I also used a meat thermometer to make sure it was done.  This came out great.

I hadn't eaten meatloaf in over a year, so I decided to give this one a try.  I was very happy with the result.  I used On The Border tortilla chips instead of the saltine crackers and added 1.25 cups (instead of 1.0) of the chips to reduce moistness.  The key to this recipe could be what salsa you use.  I used On The Border salsa (medium) because it is one of the best salsas you can buy in the grocery store.  Do not ruin this recipe with Pace Picante sauce.  

I added garlic powder, chili powder, and grounded red pepper to add a little more spice to the mix.  I cooked the meatloaf for just under 1.5 hrs, and it came out great.  Next time, I will try adding chopped onion and green pepper.

I made this for my family of three but instead of using salsa I used a medium heat homemade green chile and I also mixed in a tablespoon of red pepper flakes.  I also put a little extra sauce on the top for about the last five minutes of baking.  I did have to use an extra half cup of crackers as others had mentioned.  My family absolutely loved it!!  My husband says we have to make this a weekly dish!!  I would not recommend using my version unless you really enjoy spicy food, it was pretty hot, but extremly tasty!!  Thanks so much for the recipe.

This was really good - the whole family liked it. Our family of four at it all - no leftovers! I was only able to use 1 cup of salsa (ran out) and used colby jack instead of monterey jack (all I had on hand). I used an additional 1/2 cup of crushed saltines than what was called for because it looked too mushy. And instead of shaping into a loaf, I pressed the mixture into a greased 7x11 baking dish. Baked for approximately 50 minutes at the temp listed and it was not mushy in the middle. Next time I'll make sure to have plenty of salsa on hand to bake on top. Thanks for a great meatloaf recipe!

My husband loved this, and frankly so did I. We made this with Deer Burger,and, it was fantastic. However, a little soft. My huband said we should add a few more crackers to firm it up a bit.

I made this recipe tonight, and my husband and I are not meatloaf eaters, but I thought I would give this a try.  AND I am glad I did, I thought this turned out great, I only used one kind of cheese....I think next time I will use both.  I had to cook it a little longer than the recipe said, but that just may be my oven.

The BEST meatloaf I've ever made. My husband raved, my picky 2 year old, who won't eat anything with hamburger, LOVED it! I used mozzarella in place of the monteray jack because that's what I had on hand. I also used the parmesan garlic flavored cheezit crackers in place of the saltines for the same reason. The 1 1/2 cups of salsa is perfect not too much at all. I had no problems with it firming up. I did have to bake it closer to an hour and 10 minutes, but that might have just been my oven. Great recipe, highly recommend!

Made this for dinner one night and served it with the standard mash potatoes and corn.  I don't know what "I" did wrong, but it didn't firm up in the middle as I would have liked it too.  I doubled the recipe so maybe that had something to do with it.  Anyway, it was VERY tasty in a different non standard meatloaf way.  With the leftovers, because it didn't firm up, I ended up just letting the meat crumple all together mashed it down on top of a layer of leftover mashed potatoes layered it with the leftover corn and topped it with cheddar cheese and we had "mexican sheppards pie" for dinner tonight!  It was yummy!  Recommend you try this one, just as an alternative to "regular" meatloaf.   Oh, and for the salsa, I used the Walmart brand Chilies and Lime flavored salsa..it really gave it a wonderful taste!

I added 1 cup of crushed Cheez-It Cheddar Jack crackers in place of the saltines and cheese.
I put a little bit of salsa and shredded cheedar on top for the last few minutes of baking.  I will probably make this again.  It was very easy and my husband and I enjoyed it.  We called it Mexican Meatloaf at our house.

This was ok. After reading the reviews about too much liquid I decided to only used 1 cup of salsa, a mild southwest, and it was still very mushy. I wish I had doubled the cheese, you couldn't even taste it. I didn't have any saltines so I used panko bread crumbs. Not sure if I would make this again or not.

WOW. My expectations were exceeded on this one; very flavorful (I used Pace Picante Med salsa). This recipe has replaced the meatloaf recipe that I've been using for the past five years. I highly recommend!

To my taste, this was not good. The loaf was loose and lacking flavor. I wanted to like it, but I was very disappointed. There is no way this loaf yields six servings. More like two.

This was really good! I doubled the recipe and got two loafs, but they were moistste. They didn't stay in a slice form when cut--more like meatloaf mash, but still tasted excellent. Next time I am going to try smaller loafs or possibly cooking on a cookie sheet where the grease can drain a bit better. Otherwise, this tasted great!

Great taste...texture is very mushy compared to regular meatloaf though and thats AFTER cooking it for an extra half hour! I used breadcrumbs instead of saltines, even added extra, but it still didn't firm up very well. I also added chili powder and I added cheese to the top during the last half hour.

Tried this recipe 1st time last night and husband & son inhaled it.  Used 1.5 lbs ground beef, so I upped the other ingredients a bit, plus sprinkled some chili and cumin powders for an extra kick.  Also used shredded mont jack & cheddar mix since that's what I had on hand.  As others suggested I spooned add'l salsa & cheese on top last 10 minutes.  Use a good salsa and you can't go wrong!

I made this recipe as written and wasn't super impressed. It was pretty loose and took more like an hour and a half to cook. I might try it again using some of the suggestions offered on here.

I tried this and decided it needed to be tweeked just a little.  It was tasty, but I went a little bit further and replaced the mild to medium salsa with a can of Rotel chopped tomatoes and green chilis. A definate improvement.

I substituted tortilla chips for breadcrumbs, which could be why the meatloaf was not as tasty.  Next time I would definitely use breadcrumbs.  But, I really though the meat needed more seasoning the be tasty.  Even using 1 1/2 cups of salsa, and adding salsa to the top of the meatloaf, we still needed ketchup on it.  I think the Easy Salsa Meatloaf from this site has more of a spicy salsa taste to it.

Very good meatloaf recipe Katthy! I too used tortilla chips in lieu of the saltines and added more seasonings including chili powder, and garlic and onion powders. I also added minced fresh onion. I also poured more salsa over the top of the loaf. Thanks so much!

Thought this tasted *great* and is probably one of the better meatloaves I've had.  Only reason for the lack of that one extra "the best" star -- same problem others have mentioned that it was a bit on the mushy side.  Cooking it longer might've helped but a meatloaf should be able to hold its shape before it even cooks.  Reducing the salsa would lose some of the goodness about it and not sure if I'd like more crackers but I might try that.

This is a great way to spice up your meatloaf. I used a mild salsa (Newman's Own) and the loaf came out perfect. The next time I'll use something with more of a punch.

The whole family loved this recipe! I followed the recipe exactly except that I needed to leave the meatloaf in the oven for about an hour an a half to get it fully cooked. Great recipe, easy to make - thanks for sharing!

Deliciously different.  My family loved it.  I made similar changes to those I had read above and decreased the salsa to 1 cup and used tortilla chips instead of crackers.  We will definitely make this again.

My family abolutly adorded this recipe. I had to turn up the oven to about 400f AND put it in for about another hour but in the end it came out perfect. I had to use mozzerella rather then monteray, whole wheat saltines, and mild salsa, all due to lack of supplies, but in the end this was a smash hit... My mother was bagging me for the recipe!

I made this with ground turkey, since we no longer eat red meat, and it turned out pretty well!  I did bake it for about 20 minutes longer than the recipe called for.  I also used a lowfat mix of colby and monterey jack cheeses.  I liked this quite a bit, and while my husband isn't a huge fan of meatloaf, he did clean his plate!

I don't know what went wrong.  The loaf never firmed up and needed an extra 30 minutes to cook.  The left overs (and there were lots) will be used for taco fillings, with the addition of more spices!

I made this tonight, it was yummy!!!  But I didn't have saltines, so I used half crushed Club crackers and half crushed tortilla chips. I also didn't have Monterey jack so I used half cheddar and half mozzarella.  Then I topped it with cheddar cheese when it was on my plate.  My husband, two year old son and I loved it!!!

Wow, my husband ate this up!!! When we married 8 years ago, he told me he liked meatloaf..but I could never seem to find a recipe for one that he did really like, until now. :-) He told me that I could make this any day. When I asked him what I should call it, he told me...meatloaf, cuz when I tell him I am making meatloaf...this is what he'll expect! YUMMY!!!

I love meatloaf but I did not like this one at all, nor did my family.  My youngest daughter said it tasted okay; however, she left most of it on her plate uneaten.  I was not happy with the taste or texture and I'm sorry to say I won't be making it again.

Pretty good, but not my favorite.  My partner doesn't like 'a bite' so we used mild salsa.  Maybe next time I'll kick it up a notch with medium salsa.  Very moist however, and will make good sandwiches and left overs

This took about 10 minutes to prepare. If you don't like spicy foods, it tastes delicious with mild salsa; if you do, use extra hot and prepare to sizzle. Use different brands of salsa to dial in the perfect flavor and heat level.

I'm not a meatloaf person, but this was delicious! The husband and kids ate it all. I used only 1 cup of salsa. I subbed 1/2 cup Colby jack cheese for the two cheeses listed. Added cumin, garlic salt and steak seasonings. Plus a dash A1 steak sauce. Will definitely make again and again!!

My husband loved this meatloaf, saying it was the moistest meatloaf he's ever had. I substituted the saltines for stuffing cubes which were so good in it.

This is one of the best meatloafs ever!  Different from the traditional. I used chunky salsa and it complimented it very with the chunks of green peppers, onion and tomatoes. I also added in a few splashes of tobacco sauce. My daughter said this is a keeper and need to make it once a week.

A nice twist on meatloaf.  I used homemade salsa in the recipe and spicy saltine crackers.  It held together and cut in slices very nicely.  I served 'Creamy Kale Salad' and 'Cottage Noodles and Cabbage' both from AR with this meatloaf.

this is a great recipe but i also add 1/2 the meat in the pan and then put shredded cheddar cheese in between and sometimes i use med/hot salsa in with the mixture gives it an extra bite

Pretty solid.  I used a super spicy habenero salsa and italian bread crumbs.  It is not as firm as most meatloafs, but it was plenty tasty...

I love this recipe! My husband loves this and has never liked meatloaf ever! I've made it several times and he has even asked for me to make it when I've asked what he wants for dinner. Try it, you'll love it
