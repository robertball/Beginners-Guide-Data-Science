Maybe explaining what is in Herbes de Provence would help those who can't find it in their stores.  It contains a mix of ,dried Fennel, Rosemary, Thyme, and  Lavender.

I really liked this!  What a great presentation and I loved the crunchy bread crumb/cheese topping. I didn't EVEN pay attention to the amount of salt called for--it was obviously salt overkill.  I just gave it a light sprinkling of salt and pepper.  I made this two ways--one with the Herbes de Provence as called for, and the other with a Tuscan seasoning blend.  While both were good, I much preferred the Tuscan seasoning. This was a nice departure from the typical, sauteed zucchini.

i made this with the veggies that were on sale this week -- asparagus and yellow bell peppers -- and used only about 1/2 the olive oil.  veggies stayed firm, FANTASTIC flavor, refreshing alternative to cheesy casseroles/boring steamed veggies.  will definitely make again.

Great flavor but extremely salty! I thought that 2 tsp. salt was too much and fortunately reduced it to 1 tsp. - and it was still extremely salty.  Next time I'll probably reduce to 1/4 tsp. Could use less oil also.

If you're looking for a little different zucchini recipe, this is it!  I arranged the zucchini in a beautiful quiche dish for a beautiful presentation.  Followed the directions, but maybe didn't use as much oil for drizzling.  Everyone loved it, even the kids!!! (herb de Provence can be found in the herb and spice section of your grocery.)

I love these roasted veggies dishes. In France, we call them "tians". You can put just about any vegetable in them, whatever's in season. Thanks for this recipe!

I was cooking up a triple threat of herbs de provence for my wife, as she doubted we could ever use our jar of lavender. I already had a recipe for chicken and rice, so I needed a vegetable, and came across this gem. While we're not the biggest fans of using lavender in dinner, this baked zucchini recipe could use any sort of spice blend. This was the highlight of dinner, and is going to be our preferred method of serving zucchini. We almost ate it all before the chicken finished cooking!

This was pretty good. The top was the best part, so I think next time I'll add parmesan to all the layers instead of just the top. Also, after I finished cutting my zucchini, I noticed that there was no way all of that would fit in a regular 9 inch pie pan. I used a deep dish pie pan and it fit perfectly.

I used a mandolin to slice my zucchini evenly.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except that my herbs de provence were with garlic.  (This works for my boyfriend and I as we are both garlic-aholics.)  Maybe the squash was turning or we just didn't care for the herbs de provance with the squash.  The topping was amazing and our favorite part.  I didn't have crackers so I used the panko breadcrumbs that we did have in the cabinet.  I'll try this again and see if the strange bitterness was from the seasoning or the squash.

I thought these were pretty good, a lot better than plain zucchini for a nice change.  I forgot to look for 'herbes de provence' so I will try this again with the right seasoning; I just used my own mix of Italian Seasoning from this site but everything else the same. I brushed on the oil rather than drizzle it. The topping was very tasty.

Not thrilled with this recipe - very bland. If you have these ingredients on hand, I highly recommend making zucchini chips instead - almost identical ingredients, but instead of a casserole dish, you lay them on a baking sheet individually and turn half-way through cooking. It allows for a lot more flavor on every slice.

We really enjoyed this.  I followed the recipe exactly but used my pastry brush to brush on the olive oil rather than drizzle it for more even coverage.  Would never have thought of adding olive oil to the bread crumbs to crisp them up.  Easy and delicious!

Good! Too much salt for us, so I cut back on it quite a bit. I also cut back the cooking time - I like my zucchini a little firmer. Thanks for the recipe, nice idea!

This was terribly disappointing.  All you can taste are the herbes.  A teaspoon would have been plenty.

Made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was a definite hit.  Great combination of flavors and so easy to make.  Had a large group so assembled in a 9 x 13 pan.  I ran out of Parmesan so added some shredded mozzarella cheese on the top.

This recipe was the far best of many i tried in the past.
I used some other spicy herbs, it worked 100%.
My friends asked for more.
Big thanks for your great work. Alena

First, I dislike rosemary so I made my own version of Herbes de Provence:  1 tsp each thyme, fennel and lavender and grinded them.  These are strong flavored herbs and I sprinkled the zucchini very lightly with it and saved the rest for another time.  I also cut back on the salt as others suggested.  I enjoyed the zucchini but my husband did not.  I probably won't make it again since it didn't go over well with him.

Pretty good.  The herb flavor didn't come out too much, so I'd add more next time.  It takes longer than 10 minutes to get the crumbs golden.  I would recommend adding them sooner b/c I didn't think the zucchini needed to cook as long as it did.

It was pretty good, but I didn't really like the bread crumb topping, although the spices were good.  I googled them and made my own.  I'm not sure if I will make this one again though.

I didn't have any herbs de providence, so I just used some herbs I had on hand. This was yummy, but there was too much topping. Next time I will cut the parm and bread crumbs in half.

This is good, but being the cheese lovers that we are I added some shredded 4 Cheese Blend to step #2 and glad I did because I got a little carried away on the herbs de Provence and it helped to minimize the strong taste of the herbs.  Next time I will make it with some other kind of herb blend such as the tuscan seasoning that one of the other reviewers suggested.  I also used panko instead if breadcrumbs.  All in all a tasty, easy and quick recipe.  Thanks Toph Toph!

This was awesome. I made it for a church group and everyone in the group loved it, including my teenaged son.

This was very yummy! I really liked it. I din't have the whole spice mix, so I just did parsely, thime, and chopped fennel seeds. I eyeballed the amt. of oil and spices b.c I was making it for dinner group. I used much less of the topping than it called for. I liked it lighter than really thick on top. And I cooked it for 23 min. at first, and then 7 more w/ topping

It was just OK. It may be the flavor was too strong  for me.

Delicious, but it is a littly salty. I'd eliminate the salt completely. Also, I didn't have regular breadcrumbs, so I used a little shake n bake. Maybe that is why it is too salty. Something to keep in mind.

The seasoning was very strong - it was all we could taste, and it tasted primarily like oregano. I did like the texture of the zucchini, however.
