This is standard fare at my Grandmama's house for Christmas dinner.  I think she likes it at Christmas time because of the green asparagus and the red pimentos.  It's a very different dish with a lot of subtle flavors; nothing that jumps up and slaps you in the face, but a lot happening nonetheless.
