If these don't rise for you like they should, either your yeast is bad or something else you are doing wrong. Please don't blame the recipe & rate it down because of your errors! Also, if the bread dough was super sweet like some are wanting, when you put the glaze on, it would be so sweet, you couldn't eat it. Try a store bought doughnut without icing. No difference. And just because you grew up in a bakery, doesn't mean YOU can bake. I grew up with my father as a rock mason, but I can't lay rock!

Very tasty! My kids told me, "Mom, these are better than Dunkin'. Your the best cook in the whole wide world!" After a comment like that I will make again and again. Thanks!

This recipe is absolutely amazing! They do take time, but they are SO worth it! They are light and airy, with just a touch of crisp on the outside. They are bakery quality for sure! I made maple and chocolate glazes for them, and they are to die for! We will probably not get store donuts again! I fried them in mostly veggie oil with about a cup of shortening added in (something I saw on here somewhere). I don't know if it made a difference, but that's what I'll do from now on!

I'm a doughnut connoisseur... This is the best recipe I have ever found for doughnuts! Made 3 batches in 4 days. It can be a little tricky on step 8, because it doesn't say to knead dough after you punch down, but it's a must. I learned this on 1st batch, I followed recipe exactly as called for, but noticed the 1st doughnuts didn't rise near as well as the trimmings I kneaded back into a ball and rolled out again...even made a chocolate glaze to add a little variety.  2nd batch, I mixed in ground cinnamon in step #8 the kneaded & rolled out then cut dough into 1 inch strips and folded to make cinnamon twists then coated with glaze (I doubled the glaze mixture) and /or with cinnamon sugar... Phenomenal!!! All gone before I could take a pic(not kidding). 3rd batch, followed steps 1-7 then at 8 after punching dough I added 3 TBS powdered cinnamon and 2 chopped apples and kneaded as recipe calls for & separated & pressed out fritters. Follow steps 9-11, I had to triple step 12 to have enough glaze but it turned out great!

Love these! For my first attempt I think I over-mixed the dough and ended up with donuts that were more cake-like (as stated in other reviews). I'm not a fan of the cake texture and really wanted a Dunkin-raised donut so when I was finished around 10 pm, I started again...this time mixing everything by hand (really don't need the mixer) and trying to mix as little as possible. For my do-over batch, I also used rapid rise yeast and did not sift the flour to speed things up. Also increased sugar to 1/3 to sweeten the dough. I let the dough rise in a slightly warm oven for about 50 min. (I tested a tip to pour 3-4 C of boiling water into a pan and leave it on the bottom of the oven to warm it perfectly...worked great!) I cut the dough into strips instead of donut rings to save time and eliminate scraps. (Re-rolling the scraps made tough donuts.) Then I left the dough on the counter under loosely draped plastic wrap for 45 min. Everything turned out perfect. Kids all said this morning that they taste like Dunkin! I second another reviewer's suggestion to use the Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze found on this site. It's delicious...tastes like Dunkin!

Delicious.  Who needs Krispy Kreme with this recipe?
To the poster who wrote that her's didn't rise properly. Depends on the yeast being fresh.  All packets of yeast have expiration dates. Plus the temperature of the water.  Temperature is not to be guessed at, but, instead the use of an instant read thermometer is crucial.  Too hot and it kills the yeast.  Not warm enough will never activate yeast.

Great recipe! What I did was made them whole & when we cooled I put jam into icing bag, made a hole into the side right into the center & filled it. then dusted with icing sugar. I also filled them one day with whipped cream & then dipped in melted dark chocolate. The donut holes when they are still warm roll in cinnimion, sugar, melted chocolate. It's endless what you can fill them with or cover them with.

Perfecto! This is my third time trying recipes for doughnut - 1st epic fail, 2nd-average to almost fail, this time is so perfect..
I left the dough to raise in the fridge overnight and did the second proof as directed. I also used butter not shortening as I did not have one. It turned out very good.
This is definitely a must try recipe..

I've never made doughnuts before, and these turned out great, especially for a first try. DS and I made them together. We let the bread machine make the dough; it rose beautifully. I then rolled them out, and DS cut them out. I put them on cookie sheets and let rise in the oven with the light on for 30 minutes. We didn't try the glaze but frosted instead with buttercream icing and sprinkles. Fun morning, and now my tummy hurts a bit from eating too many. ;)  *Update- have made these several times now. My kids love them. I don't have a donut cutter, so per the cook's notes, I use a can and pill bottle. It works great!

This is a very good donut recipe!
I made just as directed with no changes.
Instead of 24, this recipe yielded 14 donuts with holes for me - I used a 4 inch donut cutter (instead of 3 1/2 inch) and didn't re-roll any of the holes. The yield was fine since I made these "just because" I felt like donuts! 
The glaze recipe is perfect also and makes just the right amount so you don't have waste left over. Per my daughter's request we rolled the holes in cinnamon-sugar. I would not have had enough glaze to do them as well, so if you're making the holes glazed then perhaps double the amount called for.
I've been making donuts for years and this will become one of my regular recipes. Thanks, Peggi!

I followed this recipe exactly. This was my first time trying this recipe and it was a waste of 3 hours and ingredients. They weren't "amazing", nor were they even "K(C)rispy K(C)reme-like" as mentioned in the comments. To me, they simply tasted like sweetened yeast. My family said,"There's no flavor." Another commenter was spot on: the glaze in this recipe was unremarkable. Use a different glaze recipe.

What I did: let dough rise for 1.5 hours. The dough doubled in size properly. The dough itself was perfect and easy to work with as stated in recipe.

My overall issue is the flavor, or lack thereof, of the finished product.

We each ate two doughnuts, hoping it was just 'us'.

The best recipe I've tried.  My husband said they were better than the one's he buys (Krispy Kreme).  Have to admit, didn't like the glaze too much, so I made chocolate frosting instead.  Added this to my recipe box.  Gonna make these again and again and again!  Thank you Peggianne!!!

These were nice doughnuts.  I am not a huge sweet tooth but the kids all thought that these were amazing!  The dough itself is not very sweet, and it's the glaze that really adds that finishing touch you're looking for.  I found that the glaze recipe was a bit thick as called for, and didn't make quite enough for the whole batch - I ended up mixing a second (smaller) thinner batch to finish them off and it was perfect.  Not sure if I'll make these again, as I'm not a fan of feeding my family Crisco, or frying anything for that matter.  I had to actually borrow some to make these, but since it was for a special occasion, I suppose once in awhile won't kill ya.  Maybe I will try subbing a different more natural fat next time.

I was scared to try this recipe at first as a first time doughnut maker. Some were saying the dough didn't rise or was too sticky to work with. I followed the directions perfectly and mine turned out WONDERFUL! I will absolutely make these again. My kids loved them and my husband wants to take some to work for bragging rights. Thanks again! :)

GLUTEN FREE VERSION
I followed this recipe exactly, except I exchanged the flour for gluten free all purpose banking flour, and added 1 teaspoon of Xanthan gum. They turned out DELICIOUS... they tasted just like real doughnuts.

I love, love, LOVE this recipe!  It's very easy, and the results are delicious.  The only thing I think I'll do different is double the icing.  But as far as changing anything,  there's no need! :-)

Forgive those who criticize this recipe for they know not what they say. This is the best raised doughnut recipe that I have ever come across.... ever! They turned out so light and delicious.... not greasy. This will be a for sure item for our breakfast gathering when the kids and grandkids come in. I want to freeze a few before the final raising to see hoe well they hold up so that I will always have some on hand for immediate use. Thanks again for posting

O.M.G.  This recipe is amazing.  A recent episode of masterchef made donuts look approachable.  They came out delicious, light, and DONUTS!!  I don't own a nice stand mixer or deep fryer but was successful.  Do buy a thermometer to watch the heat if frying in a pan/pot and make sure to properly proof your yeast.  If your dough didn't rise, it's the yeast or area where you're letting it rise.  I turn my oven on for a sec and let it get barely warmer than room temp.  Close the door...voila! perfect spot to let the dough rise.  Gotta go, donuts calling =)

Lovely well risen doughnuts.

I used vegetable oil instead of the shortening (I avoid trans-fats)and cut them out using a 4" cutter and got about 17.

I am not a fan of glazed doughnuts so I cooked and covered half of them in cinnamon sugar and have frozen the rest (once proofed) to cook fresh another day

My little brother decided he and I should make doughnuts after we came in from sledding.  I hopped on this site, came across this recipe and we tried it out.  We followed the directions to a tee and the doughnuts turned out fantastically!  They were light and fluffy and delicious, just perfect for a snack, breakfast or whenever.

These doughnuts were delicious.  We usually make the canned biscuit kind, but had some extra time on a Saturday and decided to try these.  The kids said they tasted heavenly and were pretty impressed. I'll make these again for special occasions.

I made 1/2 the recipe.  For making the dough, I used my bread machine. My dough turned out wonderful. I did use butter in place of shortening for the dough.  Once the dough was ready, I punched it down and placed the dough on a floured surface.  Rolled out once and cut using my doughnut cutter.  I was able to get 12.  I let them rise for approximately 45 min to an hour.  I used my deep fryer and a chopstick to flip the doughnuts and remove them from the oil.  I fried two doughnuts at a time.  My doughnuts cooked less than 2 min. at 350 degrees.  I used canola oil.  So keep a watchful eye while frying.  I used the glaze in the recipe too.  Glaze was good. I had to add an additional two tablespoons of water to get the glaze the consistency I wanted.  We all ate one doughnut immediately.  Very good :)  Very light and fluffy.  The doughnuts were even good the next morning too.  The glaze was not as pretty but still delicious.  Thank you for the recipe cookiequeen!!

I made these for my wife and myself and I can burn water but this recipe was simple, easy to fallow, and tasted great. I had to add a little milk to my frosting cause it got hard on me but I made the frosting before I started frying the doughnuts so maybe my fault. I can't multitask in the kitchen very well, but thank for the recipe it was awesome.

This was GREAT! The only thing that I changed was using butter instead of shortening because I don't have shortening and don't use it anyway.  I did not sift the flour and it turned out fine.  To save time, I let the dough rise for the first rising in an oven preheated to about 120 degrees and then turned off.  It only took about 1/2 hour for the first rising. Everyone (there were 5 of us) said it tasted just like a donut shop!  I have never made donuts before and was kind of afraid to but now I will make these often.  They were perfect!

These are better than Krispy Kreme fresh off the line. I put these in the fridge overnight before rolling them out. I don't have any sort of kitchen thermometer, so I used a doughnut hole as a tester to get the oil just right. (Medium heat on a gas range).

I woke this morning thinking how much my family would enjoy some homemade glazed donuts.  This was the recipe I chose to try.  I read several of the reviews beforehand.  I'd just like to say that, especially for my first attempt, this recipe is incredibly easy to follow.  I followed it to the letter and can't rave enough about it.  For those that said it wasn't sweet enough in their reviews I am shocked because there was just the right amount of sweetness in the glaze for all of my family members (even those with a raging sweet tooth).  I don't normally review things but I just had to on this recipe.  Excellent!

This recipe is simply amazing! Done it today and they are very tasty!

Pay a lot of attention to the oil temperature: stay ALWAYS at 175!

I suggest also to eat them with ham and cheese and (obviously) without the glaze!

Greetings from Italy!

Ok, so open your windows when you do this. Have a fire extinguisher ready, just in case. Make sure you wait an hour for the dough to rise, and you might have a sugar coma after so make sure you turn off the stove. GREAT RECIPE!

This is the perfect donut recipe! Crispy on the outside and airy and delicious on the inside. I made a half batch and got 12 donuts with several donut holes. They we devoured when I served them. I had two guests and they ate 11 donuts between the two of them!

I've made this recipe twice now and they are amazing! I didn't have shortening so I used margarine instead and it still worked absolutely perfectly. I was too impatient for the milk to cool so I ran cold water on the outside of the bowl, and that cut that wait time down considerably. All in all I loved it and I will be using this recipe whenever I make Doughnuts. There is no need to try another recipe cause this one is great.

These doughnuts came out faaaantastic! These doughnuts were fluffy and delicious.  We added a couple of other variations.  We also made munchkins and covered them with powdered sugar and cinnamon sugar.  We also used the glaze recipe and added some cocoa to the batch to make a few chocolate topped. Watch out Dunkin Donuts.

In the past I had always been annoyed with homemade doughnuts being dense and dry. These I am happy to say are  not! They're the best doughnuts I've ever made. I substituted pumpkin in place of the milk and added pumpkin pie spices. So yummy.

I tried this recipe today. The doughnuts taste great, but the texture came out more bread-like than light and fluffy. I'll probably try again.

I made these before, following the directions, and they turned perfect!  Tender, crispy, delicious!  I made them again yesterday using my bread machine and bread machine instant yeast.  When the dough cycle finished, I put the dough into a greased bowl, covered it with plastic wrap, and put it in the fridge overnight.  The dough kept growing in the fridge and I had to transfer it to a larger bowl.  By morning, it had grown again to the top of the bowl.  I almost tossed the dough because I was afraid the yeast might have used up all of its "oomph" and the doughnuts wouldn't puff up when cooked.  I rolled it out anyway, cut the doughnuts, let them rise for 45 minutes, then put them in the deep fryer.  They came out great!  Don't be afraid if you want to chill the dough overnight.  Just do so after it rises in the bread machine or the bowl and before you roll it out.  Great recipe, great doughnuts!

Great, a little labor intensive, but delicious. Good yeast donut. Would make again. The batter itself is pretty plain but tastes good. 350 seemed to be slightly too hot, they cooked really fast, but were good no matter how done they were. A few I added cinnamon to, and were amazing. Would try this again and maybe try some with small pieces of apple for fritters. Made some with vanilla glaze (milk, vanilla, pwd sugar), some with mom's choc glaze. Some we made without holes (cookie cutters) and filled with blackberry jelly, were delicious! Made 25-30.

I used this recipe to make filled long Johns and it worked perfectly! Just shape the donuts any way you like as long as you follow all the other general rules of the recipe.

Okay, these are terrific! I do bake a good deal, so leaving the donuts to rise again once they were cut out made sense to me, as did many other comments (make sure  your yeast is fresh, etc.) The recipe is very similar to one in one of my mom's old church cookbooks, a standard yeasted donut, and if you follow the steps, you will end up with a light, moist, tasty donut. I upped the temperature on my deep fryer to 375 (as per Mark Bittman of the NYTimes) and flipped them after 1 minute.  I needed twice the glaze suggested, and made cinnamon and sugar rolled donut holes with the extra. 
BTW, once you melt the shortening and heat the milk, you can complete the recipe in a breadmaker using the dough cycle.  Add ingredients as you would for any dough recipe (ie.start with wet ingrdients and place the yeast on top of the flour. No need to "proof" the yeast to start) Afterwards, roll out, cut out and allow to rise again for 45 minutes or so. Thanks for a great recipe.

FANTASTIC!  These are the lightest, fluffiest donuts I have ever tasted.  I followed the recipe with the exception of the glaze.  I frosted them with vanilla icing then dipped in coconut, chocolate icing, and cinnamon powdered sugar as I wanted a variety and Hubby claims he doesn't like glaze.  My mother stopped in while they were being made and she agrees these are a five star recipe without a doubt.  Thank you Peggi for sharing your recipe!  My mom took the recipe home with her!

I have tried many doughnut recipes in the past and all have had some success to various degrees but they have never been as amazing as this recipe.

OMG!! These doughnuts are to die for. So soft, mouth-wateringly good and not too sweet. I glazed them with the icing and it was perfection. The best doughnuts in my life. 

I will never use another recipe to make doughnuts ever again. 

I placed the dough in the fridge over night (8-12 hours) for it's first rise and took it out in the morning. i kneeded it a bit and then cut the doughnuts out. Placed them in a warm spot for an hour to rise (they doubled in size) then fried them. Came out perfect. Love this recipe to death!! Will never buy store brought doughnuts again

Family opinion....AWESOME.
I had to add 3/4 cup more flour  to get "dough". Any less was just a glop of glue. Not a big deal. I  was quite liberal with the yeast and proofed it well.  I agree with Peggy Weaver Tebben, people must have bad yeast or they are (1) making the proof water too hot or (2) adding the yeast to the milk when the milk is too hot (killing the yeast)
They were light and airy bites of a cloud, the glaze was pretty basic but I use home made vanilla ;) Made a few with cinnamon and sugar too.  This recipe is a keeper. Future note, I might try a dash of nutmeg.

I'm a decent home cook, nothing special. I moved to high elevation and have struggled with anything with yeast. This is my first time making donuts and this recipe is fabulous! Homemade food will not equal store food. Store and restaurant food has a ton of extra ingredients for shelf life, color, structure etc. Homemade is always better and I think people have been so accustomed to eating bad food that they forgot what good food really tastes like. Donuts are not supposed to be sweet as the icings and fillings make them sweet. Some notes from my first donut making experience- 1. I use pastry flour instead of all-purpose. I find that it is lighter and doesn't need sifting. 2. I didn't have shortening, I used butter and it seems fine. 3. I had to let rise for about 30 minutes longer each rise because I'm in high elevation. 4. Check the temperature of the oil before you start putting them in. I was able to get my oil at 350 then turned it down to low to maintain the temp. 5. I made a 1/2 recipe and smaller donuts and it worked fine. 6. After the second rise, be very gentle lifting the donuts as they will flatten, don't hold them long, immediately put them in the oil. 7. It only took my donuts about 30 seconds on each side to cook. I used a slotted metals spoon to transfer them to the paper towels. 8. I used the glaze, very basic, so I may try some others. All in all, very light, solid taste, family loves them!

This recipe is amazing. Another trick I discovered for cutting them: I use a non-flared, smooth topped glass that is a little smaller than the size of donut I want and a soda bottle cap for the holes...this has worked perfectly for me!

First try at donunts and they were a hit! Only problem was i couldnt measure the yeast and ended up adding a little more, hence a yeasty taste (nothing a dark chocolate dip cannot hide!!) Thank you.

I don't cook. I did make these for my annual effort and they were awesome. Very light and fluffy. I did make a small change to the recipe and that was to add more flower. The dough wouldn't unstick from the bowl. Other than that it worked perfect. Do it!

Just tried this recipe today and absolutely loved it!!! The doughnuts turned out so delish and were so light and airy. The only thing that was a bummer for me was the glaze, after reading the reviews I doubled the recipe and thinned it out by adding more water to it; although next time I wont double the vanilla it seemed to overpower the doughnut. But I also made some whole doughnuts and rolled them in granulated sugar and filled them with raspberry jam and they were amazing!! Definitely a recipe I'm gonna keep in my repertoire! :D  

And note for those whose dough didn't turn out, usually for me when I under-knead the dough it will turn out just fine, as long as you don't over work the gluten in the flour and don't kill the yeast it will be able to create that light airy texture. And I like letting my dough's rise in the microwave so that way there is no draft and it will keep it warm.

Great recipe! I followed the directions exactly and they turned out perfectly. I didn't glaze them since we like them coated in powdered sugar. I'm sure I'll try them with glaze, filled with lemon filling or with cinnamon sugar. Thanks for the amazing recipe :)

This was first attempt at making doughnuts and working with yeast.  The recipe and the instructions were easy to follow and the doughnuts were PERFECT!!!!  My only modification was I mixed a strawberry compote to the glaze but that is because I love strawberries.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  Everyone at my office LOVED these doughnuts and felt special that they were made for them.

I made this recipe for Halloween treats for my daughter, and they came pretty good, even I made with pumpkin flavor. To give more flavor I use a teaspoon of vanilla extract and increase the sugar a 1/2 cup. My family love them specially the pumpkin flavor. The recipe is pretty easy to do it.

First to wake up this lazy Saturday, so I decided to surprise the family with doughnuts. It took all dang morning, but it was well worth it. I followed the recipe exactly and these came out wonderfully. Really light and fluffy. I made half with the vanilla glaze and half with cinnamon/sugar. I sent some over to the neighbors and they liked them too. Thanks for such a great recipe.

I have been trying to make donuts for a while now and they always turn out bad. So I told myself I'll try one more time and started looking for a recepie .I saw that yours had shortening in it so i picked your recepie .I had just made bread that had shortening in it and it was the best bread. Anyways I wanted to make them again today and had a panic attack because I couldnt remember what recepie I used. Anyways I found it I was out of shortening so I had to use butter.
I guess that i will see if it makes a difference.
Am gonna write this recepie down cause it is the best!!! Soooooo yummy!

These were amazing!  They do take time, but for a treat it is really fun. I am not a glaze person so I just rolled them in cinnamon and sugar to finish them off. Perfection!

Was my first time using this recipe but not my first making yeast doughnuts. This recipe needs more flavor and lightness. I've used other recipes that were better. Giving it a 3 because my doughnut eaters said they were good even tho I didn't think they were.

Excellent recipe and very easy to make.  This will be my go to for donuts.  I made exactly as directed with no changes and the dough turned out perfectly.  I did add some extra water to the glaze and rolled some in cinnamon sugar.  Loved them!

these are the best doughnuts I've ever had. I made them over the weekend for my kids while the wife was at work and man they were delicious. I made doughnut holes not full size and it yielded about 50 of the them I rolled them in sugar and made jelly filled holes.

Actually pretty easy.  They definitely need the icing (which didn't seem to be enough), they aren't sweet enough to stand alone.

These were delicious!!  I definitely prefer these to cake doughnuts.  Lighter, fluffier, and great with the powdered sugar glaze.  I also rolled some in cinnamon and sugar.

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for.  I used to make donuts with my mom as a kid, and this recipe is even better :) I made it exactly as written, and wouldn't change a thing.  They were crispy on the outside and light and melt-in -your-mouth-airy on the inside.

This recipe is similar to mine yet I put a whole mashed up potato in mine. It helps with the fluffiness and gives it a great flavor. Got the idea from amish potato bread. It tastes just like Krispy Kreme. I also dip my doughnut in the icing to cover both sides. I also add about 1/4 of a cup of vanilla creamer to replace some of the milk. They are so good that I have even sold them!

Had the site cut recipe to 1/2 as this was my first try.  The recipe was easy enough to replicate.  Proofed dough in oven so rise time was cut in half.  The dough was more like a sweet bread - neither light nor sweet enough.  I will tweek the recipe and try again.  I was looking for a recipe that has the light yeast flavor in the donuts - more like Krispy Kremes.  Thank you for sharing.

my first attempt at making doughnuts.  These were very good  but not quite as fluffy as store bought.  Perhaps I overmixed them as suggested by another poster.  Guess I'll have to retry next Saturday, HAHA.  I put orange flavoring in some of my glaze, you could use any flavor really, and that added a nice extra taste to them.

Terrific recipe! Experienced baker, but I had never made raised doughnuts before. I halved the recipe, since if I screwed it up, I wouldn't have 2 dozen on our hands (or in our mouths), plus I had to substitute butter for the shortening, since I didn't have any on hand. Did 4 with powdered sugar and jelly inside, then the regular doughnut rounds with a cinnamon glaze, and the rest with a dark chocolate glaze. There were like fluffy pillows of deliciousness :-). beats Krispy Kreme any day (admittedly, I was never impressed by the cloying sweetness of Krispy Kreme)

this was light and fluffy, although not quite as much as it should be,but I have to agree with the reviewer who said it tasted like bread dough. no flavor anf not comparable to a bakery donut,,,and I grew up in a bakery!

Fabulous recipe. Added a tablespoon of vanilla paste to the dough, but it didn't need it, the flavor is so good: would just add to the glaze next time. Substituted oat milk for the dairy milk and you'd never know the difference.

One word: Perfect!!! If you like a bakery's doughnut: light, fluffy, soft, this is the doughnut for you! I used instant dry yeast, so I cut the amount of yeast to 3 tsp+1/4tsp+1/8tsp, when it first came out from the deep fry pan, I taste it and it kinda bland, but when I put the glaze and chocolate melt on, it perfect, it you don't want to put the glaze on, you should add more sugar.

they turned out great and fluffy just as promised, but when I touched the cut-donuts before frying them they popped, so I had to recut them. They were very fragile to touch, I assume in order to make them fluffy  I'm not sure if this is supposed to happen but overall it was great.

Well, we just made these fabulous doughnuts and had to let you all know how delicious they are. I started the process last night and let them raise in the fridge overnight.  I punched down, rolled out/cut them this morning  and let them rise for a solid hour. My cutter was passed down to me and is probably from the 50s when everything was smaller so I had a lot of doughnuts and used a biscuit cutter from the same era to make whole ones for jelly doughnuts. We made powdered, cinnamon/sugar and the glazed toppings, and filled the whole ones with raspberry preserves. This was absolutely delicious and will definitely be made again!

These donuts are great in texture and bite, but are seriously lacking in flavor. I think they do need more sugar in the dough, and there is a flavor missing that I just can't put my finger on.
Having been spoiled by a local family run donut shop that closed after 70 years, I have been searching for their donut recipe and thought this would be it, as the shop was appropriately named Ma's Donuts. But this recipe is close, as far as the tenderness and texture of the donut, but it needs to be slightly sweeter and flavored with something. Any suggestions?
On another note, when you set your donuts on a surface to rise after being cut, make sure they will not stick at all, or you will deflate them as you pull them off of something like wax paper. I suggest using a well floured board or clean towel, unless you have a huge work surface as mentioned in the recipe.
I will try this again with some modifications and see if I can make the perfect "Ma's Donuts" donut.

Excellent!  Light and oh so yummy. Only changes were When I melted shortening in the milk I also added the sugar and the salt to dissolve in it. Mixed by hand also. Dough easy to work with. I dipped in glaze of milk and powdered sugar.

Great recipe! I fried the donuts at a lower temperature (165 C instead of 175 C) and kept the glaze on a burner on low so it would apply smoothly.

I rated this recipe 5 stars because these still tasted great even though I made a mistake  (or two....). Can't blame the recipe. I will be trying this again in the near future and I hope I pay attention and follow each step the way I should. However, like I said, these still tasted great. Thank you for sharing!

Better than the raised donut recipe out of the CIA's Baking and Pastry textbook! Came out great! Way to go Mom! I did convert it to weights as this is what I am used to working in.  Add a pinch of nutmeg you wont be sorry.

I love this recipie. No-fail donuts if you follow every step carefully and precisely (that is coming from a novice baker). I made them perfect the first try. I used a heart shape cutter as well as a flower shaped cutter. Donuts were delicious and veryyyy fluffy. We used the leftover dough for pizza and it was amazing! It was a hit with the mr and my little one. I will be using this recipie for a starter dough. I am planning to use the dough for cinnamon rolls soon!

Best doughnuts ever to be made in New Zealand.  Follow the recipe and you will be thrilled with the results!  I have eaten doughnuts in the States, Pacific Islands, Australia and New Zealand - Mom's Raised Doughnuts are second to none.

The only change I made was I used Coconut oil in the recipe.  I would not have changed it but I didn't have any shortening in the house.  FANTASTIC RECIPE !  Thank you !

These turned out great!  I added 1/2 tsp. Nutmeg to the flour to add that little extra doughnut flavor.  My kids ate these up like they were the popular church raised donuts we get on Sunday.  Now it's Sunday any day my kids want.  Also, get the kids involved in kneading and rolling and cutting....they love helping.

This is a winner every time at our house! I usually do half of them just as written and then add some cinnamon to the other half of the dough just for variety. I also make the glaze thinner so I can dip instead of spread (that's just due to laziness on my part though) Like another reviewer mentioned, it doesn't take the full 2 min per batch to cook so keep an eye on them.

I thought these were better than store bought, even though I didn't do it right!

I overcooked the donuts. I did not knead after the first rise (this is not in the instructions and my donuts were a tad flat). The outside was crispy and the insides were soft and delicious.  After the shaping and second rise, I froze a bunch and pulled some out of the freezer last night for our first taste. I let them thaw in the refrigerator. I will never buy store bought garbage ever again! I can't wait to see how the next batch is when I don't mess it up! Thank you for posting this recipe!

I am shocked at how close to Krispy Kreme these really are! Thank you to the person that shared it. I bake a lot of cake donuts and the hardest part of these are to not over fry them. I tried baking some in my donut pans just to see what would happen and they have the texture of hard biscuits (yuck), but hey, gotta experiment sometimes. 
I would highly recommend mixing something in before frying if you want them to have a really interesting flavor.

This is a very easy recipe. The donuts are delicious, but the recipe makes A LOT and they do not keep well so be sure you have a crowd handy to eat immediately.
Will definitely make these again.

These are perfect! Will use this recipe as the base for all my doughnut variations from now on! Came out absolutely spot-on on the first try. Made them for a family dinner and they were a huge hit, no one could believe they weren't from a bakery! Thank you for a fantastic recipe.

I have never done a review before, but these were so fabulous I have to tell the world.  We lived in North Carolina and could get Krispy Kremes every weekend. Then we moved to Iowa, where good donuts are hard to find.  I made these exactly as the recipe says, and they are so close to Krispy Kremes it is unbelievable.  My husband is so happy!  Thank you so much for sharing this!

I followed this recipe exactly by the directions and I took one reviewers advice and kneaded for a few minutes at step 8 instead of just punching down. These were so soft and fluffy!

It was ok. it was crispy on its body but it wasn't fully loosed and foamy inside,it was almost like bread. I got 6 serving for  half the recipe. i was looking forward to having 12. i tried the recipe twice, i made little changes the second time but i got the same quantity. Could anybody help out on why it was so.

The first time I made these I followed the recipe precisely. Tdoughnuts were not as sweet as I liked nor as fluffy and light.  The second time I added a bit more sugar and another package of yeast. PERFECT! I would rate this recipe higher if I didn't have to tweak it for what I beleive to be  a good doughnut.

I have tried several doughnut recipes, but this is my favorite! I added vanilla to the dough, because the recipe is very similar to a fry bread recipe I have and I wanted some sweetness without more sugar. After the first rise, I cut them and put them on wax paper lined baking sheets and put them in the fridge for later. I ended up refrigerating them overnight and letting them rise in the morning, and they still came out great! This will be my go-to recipe from now on.

I just made these tonight. I followed the recipe exactly, I used heart shaped cookie cutters and made the glaze in the recipe as well as a maple glaze and rolled all of the donut holes in powdered sugar. Man these turned out amazing, totally worth the time.

good nice rising doughnuts. Next time I make, I would cut the doughnuts and then separate them and allow them to rise without touching each other. Very soft dough and tough to divide once risen.

I followed this recipe exactly. I am an experienced baker but have never made donuts before. They turned out perfect. My family are huge Krispy Kreme donut fans. They declared today "the best day ever!" Who knew I could make them all so happy with home made donuts?! It was a fun activity. We dipped them in a variety of toppings. We are excited to make them again. Thanks for this great recipe. I read and reviewed many donut recipes before I picked this one.

I think that this recipe is really good. I made a batch and I was successful in my first attempt to make donuts. Just make sure that the yeast is good  and gets really foamy so that you won't fail to make this. It is so fluffy. I only added a little bit of flour to set the dough right. For those who complained that the donuts turned out too bland or not too sweet, I think that the dough is just right to be glazed later on.
I made three kinds of glazes: chocolate, vanilla, and cappuccino.

SO good!  Also, I used rapid rise yeast and it worked out great.  I mention it because, as you can imagine, if you don't make the dough the night before, it is almost impossible to make raised donuts for breakfast with the need to rise twice.  With the rapid rise yeast I just mixed, let stand 10 minutes on my pastry board, rolled, cut into donut shapes, let rise less than an hour, and they were ready to go.  Still super light and fluffy and delicious!

It's a nice airy and chewy doughnut but I wasn't a big fan of the flavor. A little too bread-y and not sweet enough.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. It is true that the dough was not krispy kreme like, however, that made the dough also stand out. As it was soft and still taste good even when put on fridge all night. Dough I have to say that it takes a lot of time and effort, but the result was still amazing. The dough was soft, but did not contain too much air. Thanks again :)

All six times I made them my family say I  could make  so much money selling them. The donuts are fluffy with just the right sweetness and don't have the bitterness you get from recipes with baking powder. They're so much better than store bought donuts.

I made the recipe exactly as stated, and they turned out awesome! This is the first time I've ever made doughnuts, and they were delicious. My husband couldn't stay out of them. To me, I don't like overly sweet, and the glaze was just the right balance. I could eat the doughnut without the glaze as well. The inside of the doughnuts were the perfect consistency. It takes a little time because you have to let it rise, roll them out, cut them out, and then let them rise again. Yet, I enjoyed the process, and I thought this was an excellent recipe. Thank you!
