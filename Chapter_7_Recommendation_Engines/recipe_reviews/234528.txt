This cheesy melted-man-dip is the best!  
I substituted the pound of pork breakfast sausage for a real man meat sausage, none of that breakfast fluff, and it just melts into the cheese.  Aunty suggested bloods pudding for her tea, but I know she hasn’t been feeling well, and this melted-man-dip did just the trick to take away her peckishness.    She likes her dip spicy, so I made sure to cook my sauce for a good 25 minutes.  Sarah is still on her green platform though. she won’t eat anything but pork.
I may try using this dip as a sauce in my pasties.

I made this dip exactly as written and it is delicious!  You can find a tutorial of what to do and what my family thought of the dip on my blog:  www (dot) KellisKitchen (dot) org.  You should make this soon - it's great for watching a sports event or just watching TV.  A tailgating staple!

This stuff is amazing. It even warms up nicely the next day with just a little water!
