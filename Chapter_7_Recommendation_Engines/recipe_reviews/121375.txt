This is our favorite salmon recipe now. I have made it several times for company, it always get rave reviews and recipe requests. Wonderful flavor with very little work. Tastes like an entree from a fancy restaurant. Even my picky teenagers liked it.

We really enjoy salmon prepared this way. Often I forget to marinate the fish before hand so I just baste it as it cooks and the flavor is still very good. I also add a little fresh ginger.

These were delicious. I added 2 tbsp of brown sugar to offset the mustard. I boiled it to desolve the sugar and release the flavors of the minced garlic I added as well. Let it cool and then let the salmon marinate. It turned out excellent! Thank you for the recipe.

This was quite good.  I have a different glaze recipe that I normally use for salmon that I think we like a little more, but this is a nice alternative when we want something different.  The glaze is a bit too thin; I wanted to reduce it on the stove first, but I didn't take the time.  It still turned out pretty good, especially after I drizzled a little on the cooked salmon right before we ate it.  I did add a little apple cider vinegar to the glaze since it was super sweet without it, and I also baked the salmon at 400 degrees instead of broiling it.

Loved it! I added ginger and a bit of garlic, but loved the maple flavor. Served this with some soba noodles for a Valentine's Day dinner along with a cucumber salad. Great mix of flavors. Thanks for the recipe!

Simple and sweet.  The kids enjoyed it too.  I have made this recipe a couple times.  The second time I substituted garlic and onion powder instead of the minced version.  The glaze cooked on the stovetop, reduces down nicely for a sauce over white rice.

This dish was awesome! i added 1 tsp. of liquid smoke to the marinade... i made an additional batch of marinade instead of taking a portion out, and soaked sliced onions in it for a few hrs... 20 mins before broiling i took out the onion slices and soaked apple slices... i layered the fish then onions then apples... delirious! my 11 yr old brother loved it and so did my father who does not like sweet dishes. thanks for the recipe :)

I have been waiting to make this for a couple weeks now and it was so perfect! I would put a bit more marinade on the salmon but the flavor of the marinade was great! I am going to try it on chicken and veggies in the future because it was a great marinade!

I love cooking with fish and this was the best salmon I have EVER prepared! My fiance loved it (and he's not a seafood lover by any means). I used green onion for what was called and it was perfect. Thank you so much!!

This was fabulous! I can't understand why so many were adding brown sugar though, as it was quite sweet enough as is. We all loved it... even my fish-hating daughter ate some last night, so thanks for a great recipe, Kathy!

Good combination of ingredients to give baste that teriyaki taste. I follow the ingredients the way you mentioned and did not make any changes to it, and the salmon was awesome!! I only halfen the amount of garlic cloves the recipe called for. My only suggestion is to try and thicken the teriyaki sauce in a small pan on stove prior to pouring on salmon, because the sauce was a too soupy. Try adding some kind of rogue to the sauce to give it that thickness. Otherwise the flavor of salmon was great and I will be preparing this again!!

Easy and simple. You can marinate for longer it does not overpower the taste of the fish.  My kids love it!

Great recipe.    I changed it a bit. But this provided a good outline and I made it work in a way that I think tastes pretty good.    Never plan far enough ahead to soak it in marinade so I just put the sauces right on top of it and cook it. (maybe a bit longer, basting once or twice during cooking)    Didn't have fresh garlic so used garlic salt.    Didn't have apple juice - had this weird lime/apple combo juice - worked well on it. Also added some lemon juiced.    Otherwise used the same ingredients.    This will be the first time tonight I tried some minced onion on it - should be good.     Thanks for the great recipe! Fish is only good if it's cooked right!

wow.... I never really like salmon before, but after this one, I think I'll cook salmon more often. I did put a little bit of brown sugar and cooked the marinade on the stove before. I also put extra chili sauce on one piece and it turned out great, too. Thanks for the recipe and all the reviews.

Sorry, I found this very bland and the sauce very runny.  Basically, no flavor.  Would not make again.

Very easy and great tasting!  I would make twice as much sauce, because it's so good.  I had a 1-pound fillet and broiled it between 5-10 minutes.

I used this on whiting (that was what I had)-it was a little too sweet, so I added a dash of cayenne, some hot mustard (dry), and a splash of rice vinegar. I also added cornstarch to thicken and served it over my fish, didn't use it as a marinade.  And I omitted the onion just because.  I enjoyed this though and will probably use it again.

Pretty tasty.  It's very easy to make and my 2-year old loved it.  It was just a little too bland for me.  Maybe some more soy, or added ginger?

This was easy and very good!  I made it with glorified mashed potatoes, fresh green beans and sourdough bread.  I will add it to my list of 30 minute meals!
