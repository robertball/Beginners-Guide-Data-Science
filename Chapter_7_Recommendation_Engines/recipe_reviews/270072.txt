This was a great quick meal recipe. It would be VERY easy to adjust to suit whatever flavour profile one prefers. I happen to have liked this version but I'm sure I'll be playing with it in the future. I like the healthy amount of protein without needing protein powder. And it has a nice amount of fibre too. Almond milk and I don't get along so I substituted rice milk which worked great.
