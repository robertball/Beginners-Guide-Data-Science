I've been making this pie for years (got the recipe from a Boston cookbook) and it is on the table EVERY Thanksgiving.  I add 1 tsp. of almond flavoring to it for extra flavoring.  It's easy to make and a great hit with everyone who tastes it!

My husband has been on a big cranberry kick lately so I made this at Thanksgiving and I thought he was going to eat the whole thing.  Definitely put a pan under the pie pan as it will bubble over and mess up your stove, but it is so worth it.

I love this recipe.  It is so easy and quick to make.  I did not have pecans so I used chopped almonds and I forgot to add vanilla as other reviewers suggested and it was still excellent.  I ate 3 peices in a row while it was still warm.  I absolutely love the crust and the cranberries were not too sweet or tart.  I will make this one of my regular recipes as long as cranberries are at the supermarket or in my freezer.  Thank you for such a wonderfull recipe!

I made 2 of these pies to take to our family Thanksgiving dinner.  I could not believe how fantastic they were.  I was a little concerned by the amount of sugar in the recipe, but I didn't feel the end result was too sweet.  In fact, the tartness of the cranberries was the perfect finishing touch to our traditional turkey dinner.  This one is definitely a keeper!

Tried the variation of 1/2 cup cranberries and 1/2 cup blueberries with  tbsp of orange zest in the batter. Also added a tsp of vanilla and a tbsp of orange juice. It was incredible! The recipe, as is, is great but add the blueberries and it is really a cut above. I also used a cake pan and, after cooling, flipped it over like an upside down cake. Perfect! Be sure to heavily butter your pan before baking and to loosen the edges of the cake before flipping over. Looks great - tastes even better!

My grandma gave me this recipe almost 40 years ago, and I had misplaced it.  I am so thankful for finding it!!  A little bit sweet, a little bit tart, but so delicious!! We always have ours with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  Her recipe called for walnuts, and more cranberries I believe.  I'll buy extra to put in the freezer now so we can have this again at Christmas!  Thank you for sharing Amy!!

What a fantastic pie! I made a New England Feast for the Superbowl - my husband is a diehard Pats fan and was devistated to watch the Colts this year. He is a Boston-native and loves cranberries. This was the perfect combo of sweet and tart. The only reason why I would give this recipe less than 5 stars is because the pie is hard to invert out of the pan after it is done. Granted, I did not fully seperate the pie from the sides before trying to flip. Next time I will grease the sides thoroughly, and this should do the trick. I am giving five stars because no other reviewers had a hard time - must be the learning curve! Thanks so much for this recipe!

Really yummy, especially still warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! The pie did bubble over just a tad so you may want to put a cookie sheet on  rack below.

I got fresh cranberries in my farmers market basket last week and didn't know what to do with them.  I found this recipe and decided to try it.  I completely forgot about the pecans, and it was still delicious.  It's sweet and tart and super-easy to make.

I have been making this pie for years.  I found the recipe as "cranberry Goodie Pie" in an elementary school cook book.  It is easy and delicious.  I double the cranberries and half the sugar, for my taste.
Serves easily right from pie plate.

This is the same exact recipe that my mother has used for years!  It is so good and the crust has a consistency of a cookie crust.  I make it a family tradition every Thanksgiving and Christmas!  It is so good topped with whipped cream!

I made this for Thanksgiving and my family loved it! It is hard to make something that impresses my people because there are a couple of great cooks already. But my dad went on and on about how great this pie was and how it reminded him of his favorite cranberry muffins. I will definitely make this again and again! So easy too!

I made this as a Thanksgiving dessert and enjoyed it.  The tartness of the cranberries was a good contrast with the sweetness of the dough.  I added a tsp. of vanilla and left out the nuts (due to allergies).

I think this is a no-fail recipe.  I used Bisquick pancake and baking mix instead of flour because I was out and, although it rose over my 9" pie plate and ended up looking pretty messy, the end result of the taste was great.

Excellent!  When I told my husband what I had made he made a face and said “cranberry?!”  He took a small slice to try and declared this is one of the best desserts you’ve made (and I make a lot!).

Great dessert ! I have never made anything with cranberries except the cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving meal. I am glad I came cross this recipe while fresh cranberries are still in season. I made a mistake by cutting the sugar down little bit (a habit with all sweet baked goods). As a result, the pie was a tad too tart. But we still enjoyed it with a dollop of whipped cream ( would be good also with some vanilla ice cream)

Fantastic flavour and OH so easy to make -- I substituted the margarine and shortening for simple butter instead and it turned out perfect.  I buttered the bottom and sides of the pie plate  well and I was able to remove it easily.  I drizzled the top with lemon pie filling just for added flavour but it certainly did not need it.

So Yummy, we ate it right out of the pan!!  It looks great and was super easy to make. I'll definitely make this one again!
