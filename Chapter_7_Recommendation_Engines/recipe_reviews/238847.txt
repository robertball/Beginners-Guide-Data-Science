Upside-down BBQ Meatloaf Haiku: "Just put sauce on top. Didn't make diff on bottom, 'cept it swam in grease." The meatloaf itself tasted divine, but we didn't like the upside-down method w/ the barbeque sauce on the bottom; would've rather just done the normal ol' spread the condiment/glaze on top during its baking. Oh one random thing; what's w/ the ppl reviewing this 5-stars saying "sounds great,but haven't made it yet" - it's just as bothersome as poor reviews from people who haven't made a recipe yet b/c it's misleading to the average rating.

This is simply the best meatloaf I have ever had.  We followed the recipe and added BBQ sauce to the top, per other reviewers' advice.  Delicious!  Thanks, Chef John, for another great post!

Really good, flavorful meatloaf. I did not put the bbq sauce on the bottom of the meat and I used a 9 x 13 pan, instead of a loaf pan. I will definitely make this again!

Made it as written except put the barbeque sauce on the top rather than on the bottom.  The whole family loved it and I will definitely make it again!

My husband loved this meat loaf. Better than any restaurant. Did change  the recipe slightly and used  about a third ground turkey. This will be my go-to meat loaf recipe from now on.

Good enough for an inexpensive and filling meal. It was easy to make and flavorful, if not great. Definitely put the sauce on top, putting it on the bottom is weird and even the author admits it looks unappealing.

Still, this is a decent dish if you're not feeling choosy and I might try it again as a base recipe with some changes.

I don't make meat loaf that often because it's not my husband's favorite. But, tonight he said, "this is the best meatloaf you've ever made!" I used just over 2 lbs of 90% lean ground beef because that's how much was in the package. For the BBQ sauce, I used Trader Joe's Sirracha BBQ sauce  and it was amazing with this recipe.

I made it following this recipe but added a little more ketchup to hold it together better and wrapped it in bacon and just put the barbecue on top and it was delicious!

I liked the BBQ taste! I will be doing that again next time I make meatloaf. I just put it on top. The seasonings, my husband & I could have done without - especially the garlic. It overpowered the meatloaf.

To overcome the appearance I didn't invert it.  I served it like any other meatloaf I make in a roasting pan.  But I added enough sauteed  onions to spread over the top of the meatloaf about half way through the cooking time and drizzled a few lines of bbq sauce over the onions. The cooked-in bbq sauce at the bottom was a good addition to the flavor

I followed the recipe except I added provolone cheese to the middle and on top.  I usually use beef and pork when I make meatloaf and found the all beef recipe to be very dense.  The flavor was awesome and I would use this basic recipe again with a few alterations.  I did not put the bbq sauce on the bottom because I didn't want greasy sauce.

Good recipe. Use 90/10 ground sirloin or grind your own you don't need fat when you have the egg to bind it also keeps it from swimming in grease with any meat loaf

I made the meatloaf by the recipe.  Great flavor but way TOO SALTY!  If I omit 2/3 of salt and celery salt it will be much better next time.

Loved the idea, but used my own barbeque sauce recipe.  End result, very tasty and it was all gone at the end of dinner.

I have made this twice, once according to the directions, once without the cayenne and chipotle, as I was cooking for a crowd, many of whom don't like spicy food.  The second time, I also took it out of the oven after an hour, drained the fat, spread some of the BBQ sauce on top, then baked it for another 5 minutes, and did not invert it.

It's a good meatloaf either way, but it is too salty!  I likely will make it again, but I'll use about half the amount of salt listed.

As others have done, I placed the BBQ sauce on top. That way, I could drain the fat 1/2 way through the cooking time, and then at the end. I used all the spices and ingredients. However, I had 2 lbs of ground beef, so I increased oven temp to 350, and baked for 70 minutes total, then let it rest for 5 minutes prior to slicing. DELICIOUS!!! Thanks, Chef John!

This is the only meatloaf recipe we use.  The barbeque sauce soaks into the meatloaf giving a flavor boost throughout.
