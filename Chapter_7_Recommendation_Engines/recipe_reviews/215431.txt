Excellent pizza.  I crushed one large clove of garlic and mixed it in with the olive oil for a nice infusion.  Topped with sliced fresh mozzerella balls and tomato.  Added some freshly shaved parmesan, drizzled with remainder of garlic/olive oil blend, and sprinkled some salt and fresh ground pepper on top.  Topped with fresh chopped basil after removing from oven.  Heavenly.

This was a very tasty pizza. The crescent rolls give the traditional Margherita pizza a delicious taste. It's also so easy for a quick dinner.

I'm not a chef so I hesitate to rate recipes on this site...but I'm surprised that they didn't use their thin pizza dough crust as the base for this recipe...  Also it needed a  litttle bit more flavor.. I added 2 cloves of garlic finely diced to the olive oil with some Italian blend herbs and some salt.  Then I also salted the tomatoes.  I kept everything else the same except I used only mozzarella chese.   It was fabulous and I would serve this to guests.  The original recipe ....not!!!
