As always the garlic is adjustable to taste but don't overload as you don't want to lose the fragrance of the cumin and other ingredients......

I found this to be quick & simple to make. I found the lemon juice a little overpowering. Next time I'll cut it in half a see how it tastes. I added more mayo & some seasoning salt to it and it was more to my liking.

Made this exact recipe except I left out the cilantro. I used the sauce on our fish sandwiches and it was great. Thank you for sharing your recipe.
