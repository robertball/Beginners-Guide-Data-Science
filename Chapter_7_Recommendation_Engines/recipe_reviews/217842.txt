Just had this. Great flavor combo. I altered the construction in that I layered the mayo, then cheese, and lastly hot sauce (instead of ground red pepper) on top of the seasoned corn. Didn't miss the butter. Also made this flavor combo using stove top cooked corn on the cob, rolling the cob in mayo (just enough sticks) then sprinkle on the cheese and sauce.

I made this recipe for a friends Mexican pot-luck night and it was great.  I could not find Cotija cheese so I used grated Minas cheese instead and it worked perfectly.

Good corn recipe, very easy.  Only problem that I had was that the cheese melted and clumped together, so it did not lend too much flavor.  Next time I will just pass the cheese around for everyone to top their corn with, and I will cut back just a tad on the lime juice, I did use the full 2 tablespoons, next time I'll try 1 1/2 tablespoons. I added about 1 tablespoon of chopped cilantro as well because I love cilantro. I served this with grilled steaks, the liquid from the corn ran onto the steaks, and my wife loved the combination of the sauce and the steak.

This is sooooo good I made it two nights in a row! I used frozen corn (personal preference) however this recipe only served 3.  Loved the lime juice.  Will make again and again.

This is a great version but its even better with fresh grilled corn (works with steamed corn as well).  I grew up spending many summers in Mexico as a kid and this was a great treat.  I used corn on the cob, butter, mayo, parmesan cheese, bottled hot sauce (tapatio or amor), and 1/2 a lime.  try it this way, its so good!

YUM. This was so delicious. It was perfect with the cilantro lime rice I served as another side. I used a generous pinch of cayenne pepper and I could have used 2 and it would have been more to my liking. Overall a wonderful light refreshing dish and so different from the traditional Tex-mex sides I am used to. I'll definitely be fixing this again! I can't wait to try this with grilled corn next. Thanks for a wonderful dish.

This recipe is true to the real Mexican street vendor style. I grew up in Los Angeles where Mexican food is no stranger. From tamales, chicharones, and corn, these vendors are out on the daily (and sometimes nightly) basis. I strongly recommend using cotija cheese and, if you're lucky enough to have it, authentic Mexican cheese. If you can't get either, then try something like crumbled Feta cheese. It's salty enough to mimic cotija cheese. I used Feta all the time when I lived overseas and couldn't get cotija. Corn on the cob, whether grilled or boiled, tastes the best; but when there are no other options, canned or frozen corn will do.

I did not care for this recipe. I used grated parmesan instead of cotija. A different cheese wouldn't have saved this recipe.

Awesome recipe.  I used the ingredients in the recipe, but the proportions were all according to my taste.  I used 2 cans of corn, but I also cooked 4 ears of white corn to add a little extra freshness/sweetness to the dish.  The butter, mayo, lime juice, cheese, chili, and cilantro were all adjusted to my taste.  I think this is a great general guideline recipe, and everyone LOVED the dish tonight!  No leftovers!

I never would have thought of putting mayo on corn, but it's delicious.  I didn't have cotija cheese so I used parmesan instead.

I use Trader Joeâ€™s frozen grilled corn it adds that extra smokiness to the dish and tastes mor authentic. I also put chopped cilantro into the dish. Adds another flavor profile. I do not use the butter, no need with the TJ corn. Bueno!

Just tried this recipe and it was dee-lish!!! Seriously? Some people didn't care for this? Bland? Are we following the same recipe?! 
This tastes like authentic Mexican street corn. I used canned corn because that's all I had on hand, tapatio hot sauce, cotiga cheese, half of a fresh squeezed lime, mayo and butter in the same amounts that the recipe called for and a wee bit of garlic powder (as I love my garlic powder on corn.) My kids even loved it. Rich and yummy. You can't go wrong! I blackened my corn a little bit before I added all of the other ingredients. I'll be making again and again! Thanks!

So delicious and so easy! Followed the directions but made a few adjustments. First of all I agree with other reviewers that 2 cans does not equal 8 people. We did about eight cans and that fed 10 people. We also used only one tablespoon of butter for all 8 cans of corn and still tasted delicious! Used grated parmesan cheese  as it easily mixed in with the corn, we used way less lime juice only about 2 tablespoons for the entire recipe. We also added a little bit more spice with paprika and Mexican chili powder to taste. Will definitely use this again I love corn on the cob, but this is an easier appetizer to bring with you.

Just made this and LOVE it!! Even my Mexican neighbors never heard of this  cheese so I used the Mexican cheese blend from the store and a few drops of hot sauce instead of the ground red pepper (and I don't even like hot sauce).  But this was absolutely delicious and I'll share it with all my friends. And it's so quick because all you really need to do is heat the corn.  EXCELLENT!

The only way I plan to cook corn from here on out! This was a surprise addition to our holiday dinner and this gained 10â€™s across the board. That Lime taste kicks in and turns the party up in your mouth.

This was outstanding and can be served hot or cold.  I used fresh grilled corn vs. canned corn but I'm sure it's good either way.  Huge hit in our house and will definitely make again!

I used frozen corn and browned it a bit in the butter in a non stick pan. (Used more butter than recipe calls for). Added remaining ingredients except cilantro (because a family member dislikes it). 

Lots of compliments  given and second helpings taken...and a request to make it again for an upcoming potluck.

I served it as a side fish for tacos and my son added some to his taco and said it was good like that too.

I had no trouble finding the cheese. Most grocery stores have a small refrigerated unit in their Mexican foods section. I found both grated and block cotijo there.  I chose the grated...it looked like coarse parmesan.   I was generous with the amount I used in the recipe but careful not to overdo it as the original poster suggested.

Five stars and this one goes into "Favorites" in my recipe book.

This is delicious!  I made it for a Memorial Day family gathering, and everyone really liked it.  Only changes: I finely chopped about 1/4 cup cilantro and finely sliced 2 green onions, and mixed them into the corn.  Used 3 cans of corn, one of which was the fire-roasted style.  Due to more corn, I upped the cotija cheese, mayo and lime juice.  Added about 1/2 tsp red chili flakes.  Oh my so good!

5.9.18  OMG this is so simple to make with excellent results.  Hard to believe you can get this kind of flavor from a can of corn.  Wouldnâ€™t change a thing, really enjoyed this quick and easy recipe.

Outstanding. Except for adding a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and using frozen corn, followed the recipe exactly. And thanks for the introduction to cotija cheese. Had never heard of it before, but it was excellent and I plan to use again in other Mexican dishes.

I have made this recipe over and over again! My wife and I love it. Anytime we serve it to guests they are always surprised with how good it is. I have served this with both Mexican dishes and with BBQ meals. Works great for both occasions! Try it! You won't be disappointed!

I didn't have canned corn so I used 4 cups frozen. I cooked and drained it and then followed the directions. I live in Canada and can't find the cheese mentioned in the recipe so I grated feta and it was delicious. I also didn't cut back on the lime juice but then I love lime juice so it wasn't too sour for me at all.I used this as a side dish and  it was so nice to find this recipe. I was looking for something that wasn't creamed and this fit the bill. Thanks for sharing.

Had no canned corn so used 4 cups of frozen. Unfortunately I couldn't find cotija cheese so had to substitute parmesan and I mistakenly used red pepper flakes instead of ground. This is a very nice side dish, there were no leftovers and I will definitely make it again.

What a great idea!! It did taste like those corns I got in LA! I missed those so much. I still do them at home but I like them best off the grill and that's just a heap of trouble. This is a quick fix for the memory. Thank you Parizienne!!

This is fantastic and full of flavor! I like that it's very easy and can be made in minutes. I used a full bag of frozen corn and substituted shredded Mexican style cheese for the cojita (too expensive!). It tasted just how I expected it to! Thanks for the great recipe.

Followed the recipe to the letter and it is pretty bland and way too sour.  Really not good.  I'd planned to take it as a side to a dinner party.  My fault for making an untried recipe.  It's edible but not very good and certainly not something to bring to other people as an example of what I can make.  Made it because it seemed easy and the submitter was listed as "Pro".  Won't make this mistake again.

Just finished dinner with absolute raves about the corn. Cotija cheese also known as Queso Cotija or El Queso Cotija ,can be found at Winco and Raleys in my area. Delicious and oh so simple. My kids ate it up then licked the pot after! Its a perfect compliment to any Mexican dinner.

Nice and simple recipe, but don't care for the cilantro as a garnish.
