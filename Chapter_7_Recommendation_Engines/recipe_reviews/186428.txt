this recipe is ok as a twist on modern cheesecake, it uses unique ingredients yet still tastes familiar enough to be what we consider a 'cheesecake'. it's not delicious, but it's ok. it is also not what it claims to be. this recipe is a heavily altered combination of two recipes mentioned in ancient texts. the reason i am rating it so low for an ok cheesecake is because most, if not all, people looking for this recipe are going to be making it because they think it's 'authentic ancient roman', which it isnt, although the explanation claims it is. it's only real claim is that it's touted as an ancient recipe, so people will make it for things like toga parties. the cheesecake itself is mediocre at best. it is not as sweet as what we consider cheesecake to be, and the bay leaves impart a slightly odd flavor. the romans didn't have citrus fruit until the 4th century ad, and it is disputed if they had it at all. savillum and the other recipe this stems from, libum, were from texts by Cato the elder, about 500 years before that. it was probably added to this recipe to suit our tastes, as cheesecake is often made with lemon. savillum also did not use bay leaves, there was a different recipe for cheese buns (unsweetened) that were placed on bay leaves to bake before they were soaked in honey after baking.

SOO GOOD I wasn't quite expecting for the texture, I was more expecting a cheese-cakey more texture, but still very very good.

Looking for a easy, low fat dessert? This is it! The cheesecake came out of the pan easily and had a nice taste. It got 4 stars for presentation.  Watch  carefully, if you get a nice golden top, the edges may burn. The directions didn't say anything about greasing the pan, so I didn't... but probably should have. I didn't even think about it until it was too late and the cheesecake was in the oven.  I'd make this again. I probably wouldn't serve this for company until I ironed out the issues of presentation and timing. Also, the cheesecake was only 3/4" high - so doubling the recipe may give it a little more volume.

Use a smaller springform than the 10" indicated in the recipe, which might also bring the baking time up to 35 minutes.  I'd recommend a layer of parchment paper since the bay leaves easily move and if any part of the cheese cake is brown it sticks.  The taste was okay; even with half the bay leaves (mine are really strong), their flavor overwhelmed the delicate orange and honey flavors, which had made the batter taste so promising.  Far from being a disaster, but not a repeat recipe for me.

Definitely better with just 6-8 bay leaves. Not so overpowering. We've made this twice! It's a nice departure from super sweet desserts.

I was hoping for a thicker dessert like a New York Style Cheesecake, but this came out with more of an omelet-like (flat) appearance.  I don't know if it would have cooked properly if the recipe had been doubled, but that might be an option.  15 bay leaves make its presentation very interesting to the eye, but they add way too strong a flavor - overpowering in my opinion.  If pre-slicing for entertaining, cut your slices SMALL or no one will finish theirs!  It stuck like Elmer's Glue to my springform pan, but the paring knife helped and it released with some gentle scraping effort... so looks pretty good (I'll add a photo since there isn't one presently).  My daughter needed an "Ancient Roman Dessert" for a Latin Classical League (high school) party, and this is the only one that I could find on Allrecipes.com.  Sure hope the teenagers eat it ...and if they accidently eat a bay leaf, they won't get a shock because the entire dessert tastes like one anyway! :)  Can anyone upload another "Ancient Roman Dessert" to give readers more options to choose from?

Loved this. It's like a ricotta cheese custard, simple & delicious on its own, but much better with fruit. I didn't use any flour, used a scant 1/2 cup of sugar instead of honey (maybe I'll only use 1/3 cup next time), added a pinch of salt, doubled the orange zest, and omitted the bay leaves altogether. I cooked it in a 9 in pie plate that I sprayed really well, then sliced it & served from the pie plate. It needed less cooking time in my oven, more like 25 min.

First, let me say how delighted I was to find a recipe like this - perfect for a "toga night" we had recently.  I did substitute mint for the bay leaves - I have mint, and fresh bay leaves are hard to find.  No one finished their piece, but all were happy to try something "Roman".  I do think a fruit sauce - as suggested by others, would help.

I followed this recipe exactly with one exception:  I followed the advice of some other reviewers by putting all of the doubled recipe into a single 10" springform pan.  I think this may be where I went wrong, since the parts nearest the springform base were very moist and almost glue-like.  I did not grease the pan, since the recipe did not say to, but I think that may have helped at least a little.  I tried dabbing the bay leaves with honey so they would stick to the pan while I poured the batter but that did not work.  To transfer to a serving plate, I had to scrape the cake off the springform base with a knife.  That looked so bad that I picked out the bay leaves and will be serving it with the other side up.  Although I like the taste the bay leaves provide to the cake, I think I will be experimenting to get the flavor of the bay leaves without having to include the bay leaves themselves.  The TASTE of this cake is excellent, and I will definitely be doing this again.  I just think it needs a little more experimenting to get the presentation right.

This was the greatest cheesecake I have ever had. The taste brought me back to a time of simplicity and peace. I am going to continue to eat this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every single day for the rest of my life. Amazing recipe and amazing food. Thanks Namaste Mama, you live on a legend in all of our hearts forever.

We followed the recipe but took it out at 30 minutes and it was too brown. Still tasted good. My daughter made a design with the bay leaves on the parchment paper in the pan before we added the batter. She spooned the batter onto the leaves to hold them in place before adding the rest of it from the bowl and it turned out great! 

Making it a second time now and plan to take it out of the oven sooner!

Lol tasted like gluteus maximus lipid sacks . It brought me back to the time when i sat in a toga  at a nude beach and rubbed garum (fish sauce) on my belly and screamed hail ceasar.  Great times.

I made several of these for my daughter's Girl Scout troop for International Day. I think the key to this recipe is to know going in that this will not be the type of "cheesecake" most people are familiar with. The recipe itself is simple. Getting the bay leaves to stay put while you pour the batter is not. After reading other reviews I lined my pans with parchment paper which I then greased. 6-8 bay leaves is definitely enough. More would overpower the other delicate flavors. That said, the taste is great, the honey and citrus are perfect.
