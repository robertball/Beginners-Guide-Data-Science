This is by far the best recipe I've ever tried.  It's so easy and the results were amazing.  My whole family loved it and I personally could live on this soup and nothing else.  It's serious when you would rather have this soup over chocolate!  We used a ham we smoked ourselves on our wood smoker grill and I mashed up one of the four cans of beans and stuck to the rest of the recipe to the letter.  It smelled unbelievable good the whole time it was cooking and it tasted even better.  I will be making this quite often.  It's a sure winner and just plain good for you - a great comfort food.

This is my first review as a "newbie" to this website.  I registered simply because I want to RAVE about this awesome soup recipe!  I made it today, and it will be dinner tonight with some cornbread...IF it lasts that long! I didn't have 4 cups of chicken broth, so I had to add 4 oz of water, which didn't hurt a thing.  I followed the recipe, except that I mashed 1 can of beans.  I also added a clove of minced garlic to the carrots, onion and celery saute, and added 3 cups of diced Cure 81 ham to the skillet, so it would add some flavor to the veggies. I also added about 1/2 tsp smoked paprika, 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce, and 1/8 tsp Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning (green can) to the soup, and will add a cup of frozen green peas about 15 minutes before serving tonight. This is one of the tastiest soups I've ever made! The flavor is rich and complex, with many layers. My hubby tasted it at lunchtime, and thought it was fabulous. I only let him have a taste, though, since he had already had a sandwich. I have a feeling we'll be making this a LOT during the cold weather...what a perfect comfort food! After reading all the reviews, I knew I had to try it, but I'm totally in awe of how good this really is! Don't hesitate for a SECOND, ladies.  It tastes like you spent HOURS on it! It's going to be one of those prize recipes in your arsenal that will have everyone begging you to make it. If I could give it 100 stars, I definitely would.  Thanks for the most delicious soup

The recipe was delicious. I recommend using low sodium broth, because the ham can be salty.  I wanted a thicker soup, so I used in an immersion blender. Thank you for a great way to use left over ham!

This is a fantastic "good old ham & bean" soup.  It's an American basic.  I consider it great diet food.  Very high protien in this recipe.  I multiply is 8 times and in cans in Mason Jars in the pressure cooker beautifully!

This soup is so easy and quick to make!  Mine turned out a little on the salty side...but I think that was because I did not have any chicken broth on had, so I made my own by just throwing together some chicken base and water.  I think I made it a little strong.  I also mashed one can of the beans like others suggested and added a little cornstarch...we like our soups on the thicker side.  Over all good tasting soup for being so easy!

This is by far the best bean and ham recipe I have ever tried.  We used less chicken broth, as we wanted it thicker.  Also, we used 96% fat free ham, and EVOO rather than butter, just to make it a bit healthier.  This is definitely a keeper for us!

Use this recipe, you will not be disappointed. I add a bit of liquid smoke to mine. Such a FAST bean soup, and the family loves it. I allow my beans to simmer for awhile so that the soup becomes thicker.

This is so delicious.  I only used two cans of beans.  I would suggest doing at least 8 cups of broth if you are going to use 4 cans of beans.  I served it with cornbread and it was super!

Great soup -- especially because I created and submitted this recipe 2+ years ago and it was never published on allrecipes. But I see that it's on now from the "test kitchen" with the addition of the chili powder. Oh well, still plan on making it tonight, though.

This is very similar to a recipe I have  been using for years.   The only difference is I use water instead of chicken broth because it can be too salty and I don't use chili posder or bay leaf but I do add about a 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I don't usually cook my vegetables before hand I just throw everything in and slow cook for an hour or until the vegetable are tender.  Just a couple  ideas for something different for those of you who like this recipe.

Good, very easy and quick to get on the table!  The chili powder in here just helps to make the ham seem smokey-er!  Nice touch

Good base recipe. I added a splash of white wine to onions a minute before broth. I'd simmer with ham for longer, and add beans closer to the end. Extra spices I added: 1 tsp of thyme, tarragon, veggie bouillon, & a pinch of dijon mustard.

I thought this was an OK recipe.  Easy to make.  We added light sour cream to our individual bowls and thought it added better flavor.

Good, but not great.  It is definitely one I will make again because it's easy to keep these ingredients on hand.  However, I prefer the flavor of a soup you work on all day if I have the time and stuff to do it.  Also, I like my soup fairly "brothy", so I might put one less can of beans in it next time.

I know the whole purpose of this was not to spend hours in the kitchen, but I used dry cannellini beans and cook them for a couple hours with a ham bone. I then removed the ham bone and added the onion, celery, carrots and garlic until the beans were firm, and almost tender. I added the ham I had removed from the bone and added about a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce and some seasoned pepper, continuing to cook the soup until the beans were firm, but tender. My husband walked into the house and commented that something smelled really good, and he doesn't normally care that much for ham and bean soup! This is really great tasting soup!

This was an excellent recipe.  I pretty much stuck to it, except for adding a bit of liquid smoke, worcestershire sauce and cumin for a smokey flavor.  It turned out great!  Thank you!

Based on this being a quick and easy recipe, I give this soup 5 stars.  Sure - a slow cooked bean soup might be better if you have time.  For me this was a great after work recipe.  I was skeptical of adding the chili powder, but it wasn't overpowering.

Great recipe and not so difficult to prepare. In order to make it even tastier I added a few slices of jamoniberico de bellota  - aka iberico ham or patanegra- thinly cut. Because iberico has a strong and delicious flavor you do not need much, only 50 grams or 1.8 OZ for four people added once the soup is finished.  You can buy your jamoniberico at BuyJamon.com    BuyJamon.com buy jamoniberico online and have it delivered to your door.

This soup is delicious!  I used leftover frozen ham and low sodium chicken broth.  Also I added a half teaspoon of ground sage and a dash of liquid smoke.  I can't wait to make a large batch and freeze in containers for a quick lunch.

This was absolutely amazing. I used a combo of vegetable broth & beef broth (what I had on hand) & added a few drops of Worcestershire sauce. This had a wonderful flavor & tasted like it had been cooking for hours when it was so quick to make. Will be making again soon, thanks for the recipe.

I used this recipe for my first attempt at making homemade ham and bean soup.  It turned out great!  My 11yr old LOVES it and has already asked that I make it again!  Great way to get protein.  I am trying it tonight with one can of black beans for a little different flavor.  Thanks for the recipe~ EASY TO MAKE!

Do yourself a favor and make "real" ham and bean soup.  Really wanted to like this based on reviews and ease but it was at best okay.

very simple yet tastes like you worked on it all day.  I used organic canned beans and sodium-free bullion instead of the broth to cut down on the sodium content.  I also took the advice of refried beans to thicken the base and extra bay leaves

This recipe was good, but the beans were too much in my opinion.  The flavor was a bit on the bland side for our tastes, but I think it could be enhanced with some Worcestershire sauce and maybe some red pepper flakes.  Just my opinion but it was a good start for ham and bean soup!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Wow...this was delicious! Had some extra ham in the fridge and always have lots of canned beans. Had to use three cans of navy beans and one can of great northern. Did not have celery on hand, but used a can of corn for something extra and it was very good. Seemed like it needed something more by way of flavoring, but I would make again.

I tell ya...I never knew bean soup could be so easy!  I always did the whole process of soaking the dried beans, etc.  This was the first time I ever used cans of beans (I didn't even know you could get them that way, LOL)  No more planning a day ahead!  YAY!  This recipe was perfect.  If you like it thicker, you can just add more beans.  If you like it thinner, you just add more broth.  Just wonderful. I changed nothing and will make it this exact same way many more times!

This was a very good tasting soup and a good way to use leftover ham. I throw it in a slow cooker and go ride snowmachines all afternoon or cut fire wood, this is good hearty food to come home to in the winter & warm you up. Easily made. I like to mash 1/3 of the beans or run them through a food processor with a bit of the broth to achieve the rite consistency and flavor. vegi's are good so I increase the amounts of all. I have had to add a small amount of salt at times, depending on the ham......... wait till' the end for that decision.

I took a few elements from this recipe to update my usual one - My Southern raised family has always made "beans" (they don't call it soup for whatever reason)with water, bacon drippings, ham, a little sugar and salt.  I don't care for carrots and celery in mine, but I did add a whole medium sized onion and most importantly - the chicken broth! I have never been able to duplicate the "simple" beans my Mom and Grandmother make (which of course theirs tastes awesome, but not mine!) Using the chicken broth took away what I always felt was the bland taste and whatever was lacking in my attempts. Sorry for the liberties with this recipe since I didn't use most of it, but for anyone else that makes them the same way I'm accustomed to, the chicken broth makes a huge difference.  Comes out a little greasier but it tastes great. Thank You!

This soup was amazing and was just perfect for using the leftover smoked ham from Christmas. I made just a couple of tweaks to the recipe. I mashed two out of the four cans of the Northern Beans and stirred it in with the Chicken broth for a thicker, heartier soup base, and increased the garlic, adding two cloves through a garlic press. Served it with a rustic loaf of whole grain bread (thick sliced and toasted!)My family loved it!

My husband and I really liked this.  I will definitely make the soup again.  I rated this a 4* only b/c my son is so picky and didn't LOVE it.  He initially rated the recipe a 2, but changed his mind after a couple spoonfuls to a 3 1/2.   Didn't have enough northern beans, so added small white beans--which I wouldn't recommend--too mushy.  Served with a great cornbread and salad.

This is an easy and great tasting bean and ham soup. My family loved it and there wasn't any to save for later. The longest part of this recipe was cooking the carrots. :)

Would give 10 stars if I could! I had left over ham from Easter yesterday, and today is unusually cold in FL so I thought this would be a good recipe. OH WOW! It is absolutely perfect. It's not only the best soup I've ever made, but quite possibly the best I've ever had!!!

This is one of those soups that seems too "plain" to be any good.  Wrong! I used canned white beans instead, and my family gobbled it up.  Even the picky 2 yr old had 2 bowls!

Delicious! I used Navy beans and mashed a can before adding them to soup instead of using Great Northern beans.  I also added about 1-2 cups cooked rice towards the end and added about 48 oz. chicken broth. Made cornbread for a side. An easy recipe and will definitely make again.

This was very, very good.
I used dried yellow eyed peas instead of canned beans and added extra broth and water to compensate and added more garlic.  
Thank you for this great recipe.

Sooooo good!  Quick and easy, too.  Just made half a batch because that's the amt. of leftover ham I had, and hubby and I ate all of it in one meal!  Hit the spot perfectly on a cold winter evening.  A keeper for sure!

My husband works construction, so he comes home chilled to the bone.  He loves soup, so I thought this one might do the trick to warm him up from the inside out.  He loved it!  The kick of the chili powder was especially nice!  I was rather generous with all of the spices, and I didn't have enough Great Northern Beans so I added some Kidney Beans.  Great Recipe!  And very easy to make!

I absolutely love this soup!!  I have made it a few times now and I don't need to add a thing to it because the flavor is perfect!!  I did smash one of the cans of beans to make it a little thicker.  I also chopped the vegetables smaller than normal because of our 4 kids and was amazed when no one asked about what vegetables were in it (normally gets asked).  The whole family loved it!!! This is a keeper! Thanks!

This soup is better than my mom used to make.  Even my picky eater ate two bowls!  A few changes I made were using onion powder and garlic powder. I also think I used more chicken broth than the recipe called for (I didn't measure), and since we like our soups thick, I used potato flakes to thicken. That really made it wonderful. Fixed cornbread as a side and almost everything was gone!

I really liked this recipe for its ease of preparation and versatility.  I did make a few additions/substitutions of my own including adding smoked paprika to make up for the lack of smoked ham hock that is included in traditional recipes and the substitution of chicken base for cans of chicken broth.  This recipe is awesome~!

Very good soup, will definitely make again. I only added 1/2 of the beans, we like beans in my family, but not that many. Also I added in three small potatoes. Yummy

This soup was way easier than the traditional bean soup, and it showed.  My veggies were crunchy and the flavor of the soup was not well blended.  I ended up adding two TBSP of garlic to offset odd flavor and still wasn't very happy with the dish.  Three stars because it's easy, but I wouldn't make it again.

I really liked this recipe, but felt I needed to add a few things.  Overall it was really good.  One thing I ended up doing at the end was putting two cans of extra beans in the food processor to make the soup thick and hearty.  I saw a few other people done the same thing with the bean the recipe called for.  A great recipe for starting with.

This was delicious, just like I remember from growing up in Ohio.  We didn't have any celery, so we left that out.  We used turkey ham instead of pork and we cooked it for about 25 minutes instead of 15.  I mashed some of the beans with a masher to give it a thicker consistency.  I will definitely make this again!

This was quite a tasty soup.  I mashed up some of the beans to make a thicker base and then ended up re-cooking it quite a bit the next day in a slow cooker when taking it to a potluck.  I think the longer it cooks, the better, and as with many things, tastes better the second time around.

Delicious and easy. It's fine as is, but I like less beans, so I put 3 cans in. Very tasty! This is a good winter afternoon soup.

This was good enough... We all ate it, but no one was amazed with it or anything. Course, we don't really ever have any kind of ham and bean soup, so maybe that's why?

Wonderful & easy.  I too cooked my Easter Ham bone with some dry pinto beans-that's all I had, for a couple of hours.  Then removed the bone to get the rest of the meat off, and added everything else.  I did add some worcheshire and some garlic/onion grill seasoning.  Hearty and good!

This recipe is simple and very tasty.  What more do we want?  I'm passing it on to other busy cooks.
