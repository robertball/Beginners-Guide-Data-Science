This recipe is much like "Refreshing Limoncello Cake," from this site.  I loved that one,  so it's no wonder I loved this one as well.  It is indeed a cake appropriate for summer, as it is not overly sweet or rich, but it would be equally appropriate any time of year, particularly after a heavy meal.  The cake is moist and soft,  not exactly fluffy but certainly lighter than a pound cake.  The lemon flavor is subtle, so in my mind it really does need the Limoncello glaze to embolden it.  I loved it as is, but if I were to make it again I would add a little more lemon zest to really enhance the lemon flavor.

I doubled this recipe and baked it in a bundt pan. The amount was perfect for a big, rounded cake. I'm thinking of adding the lemon juice to it next time because the lemon flavor is so delicate, despite the zest of two lemons. The ingredients say "one lemon, zested", so I only used the zest. Did anyone take this to mean other than the zest? Could be that I misread the intention. Anyway, my husband does not love lemon, or cake, but he has raved about this cake and eaten it alone, with a glass of limoncello (see my photo), with ice cream, and drizzled with chocolate syrup. It's going into my permanent favorite recipe book I'm making to take along when we move to Italy.

Too bad I can only give this cake 5 stars, it deserves 10!!  First of all, I got to buy my first bottle of Limoncello, YEAH! Second, this cake is LIGHT as a feather and oh SOOO YUMMY!! Third, this makes a Perfect dessert after even the heaviest of dinners. This would be a Lovely cake for an afternoon tea. The crumb is Very tender and moist. The title is missing one word and that word is,  FABULOUS!!  I added a few teaspoons of limoncello after it came out of the oven and added some yellow food color to the glaze. LOVE LOVE this new summer time treat:::))) THANK YOU ALLIGREEKPI,  THIS ROCKSSSSS!!!

I doubled the recipe as suggested by another reviewer. It worked perfectly for the bunt cake pan I was using. I also use more limoncello and peel then the recipe called for, because I prefer a stronger lemon flavor. The limoncello used was my homemade version with a hint of lavender. As the cake cooled I had poked holes on the bottom using a wooden skewer & poured additional limoncello. Once it soaked through I had removed the cake from the pan & pour the icing onto the bottom of the bunt cake pan and poked additional holes on the top using the same method as I had on the bottom. Gently replaced cake back to the bunt pan lining the design of the pan with the cake until completely cooled. This was the best limoncello cake I've ever had!! Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This is a very nice cake.  I did add a tsp. of lemon extract after reading reviews and I will do that when I make the cake again.  That's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars (because I made an addition).  The cake reminded us of a pound cake, and I served it with blueberry sauce as another reviewer did.  I must say I thought this was a bundt cake because of the picture, and didn't discover it was an 8" cake until the day of my event.  I made it in the bundt pan anyways, and it was small of course because there wasn't enough batter, but it was still pretty, and good.  Next time I will increase the ingredients by 50% and I'm hoping it will be a normal-sized bundt cake with that change.

No company to impress with these wonderful little cakes, but I did impress my family!  Allie - these are wonderful.  I didn't have Limoncello, but I did have Orangecello, so that is what I used.  I also used 1 zested orange in place of the lemon.  I used my mini Bundt pans and the recipe made 22 delicious treats.  We ate some, gave some to friends and family and I froze 6 of them.  They thawed beautifully and were delicious months after they were made.  I plan on making them again, using the Limoncello, but the Orangecello worked great, also.

What a lovely summer cake! It's not too sweet, and the perfect canvas for a summer berry topping. I made a fresh blueberry sauce to serve with ours. I also used cream of limoncello instead of regular, as that is what I had in my freezer. I baked mine in a tube pan, and decorated around the edges with fresh blueberries and lemon slices.  So pretty! Thanks for sharing your recipe Allie!

I was really happy with this recipe! I doubled the recipe and made cupcakes, too. It was light and lemony (I added some lemon juice along with the zest just to be sure!), a nice texture, and the glaze was a perfect compliment.  I got lots of compliments on it. Frosting would have made it prettier, so I might try that some time as well, but I think the glaze was just the right amount of sweetness for me.  I saw someone mentioned making it with orange, and I may give that a try as well.  I'll definitely make this one again!

Love this cake - quick, easy, delicious.  I had a bottle of limoncello I purchased in Portofino, Italy and used that which made it extra special.  Also, I did as another reviewer stated; I made the recipe just as is and put it in a bundt pan.  It made a prettier little cake than an 8" pan.

Like others indicated, I added the juice of a full lemon which amped up the lemon flavour without being overpowering. I did 1/2 yogurt and 1/2 sour cream (only because I didn’t have enough sour cream). The cake was moist and flavourful, definitely adding to my go to cakes!

I’ve made this recipe 4 times this fall and it never fails!  I did add the juice of one lemon to the batter which gave the cake more of a zing.  Instead of using a Bundt pan, one batch can make two loaves or use the individual brownie pan.  Either way, the cake itself is delicious.  Light and a

Made it for a reunion of 11 ladies from our trip to Sorrento in May. Doubled the recipe and cooked it in an angel food pan. It took about 1 hour 15 minutes to cook, but came out perfectly! Everyone LOVED it, saying it was moist, not too sweet, and very lemony. I used Limoncello from Sorrento, so it is more lemony and not as sweet as what you can buy in Canada. Also zested a lemon on top of the glaze. YUM!

I doubled the recipe and baked it in a bundt pan for 40 minutes. I also used vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream or plain yogurt.  I used 1/3 cup of canola oil  and 1/3 cup applesauce. The result was great!  A light, refreshing cake. Will definitely make it again.

We got a bottle of Limoncello from probably the best Airbnb host ever, at the end of our stay in Rome last week. My husband and I aren't really drinkers so I looked for a recipe to do it justice. This does so in spades! The cake and glaze are delicious - not too sweet, and very refreshing. I made one for home and one to take into work tomorrow. I did follow the advice of a couple of other reviewers and added the juice of a lemon to the double batch of batter.

I just used plain yogurt and added a teaspoon of lemon extract to both the cake and the glaze - it turned out fantastic but my extract in the glaze wasn't needed it was just a tad to strong lemon taste for kids but the adults liked it.  great summer cake!
