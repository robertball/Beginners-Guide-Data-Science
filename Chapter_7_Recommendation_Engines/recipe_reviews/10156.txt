This is a wonderful tasteing cookie.  I made these for a quick pick-me up during potato digging season.  All the farm hands fell in love with them.  I ground the oats and Hershey bar in my blender and then the nuts too.  So, nothing sticks between your teeth and the shells are ground.  This made for a great texture in this cookie.

I made these jars and sold them at Christmas.  They were a huge hit.  I ended up making about 300 jars. Everyone loved them.

Well the measurements were great, but the cookies were disappointing. They were hard, didn't have enough chocolate, and were dry. NOT YUMMY:(

I have used this recipe in commercial settings and find it very versatile.  I have made 4oz cookies with it as well as multiplied it 10 fold.  The dough keps well when refridgerated.

I don't make this in a jar as a gift, but keep a container ready for last-minute surprises like when my sone tells me at 8:30 he has to bring cookies to school the next day. It's great to have on hand!
