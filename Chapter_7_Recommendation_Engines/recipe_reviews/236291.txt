Interesting combination of ingredients.  Don't know that I'd drink this on a regular basis, but it certainly would be nice for a special occasion or a special dinner/brunch.  Enjoyed this, but for my taste, it was too cinnamon-y, so I'll cut that in half in the future.  Also, if you're using milk & cream (which equates to 1/4 cup) directly from the fridge, you will not have a hot cup of coffee, so you may want to give it a quick heat in the microwave.  It was a nice break from my usual cup of "joe."

I did like this coffee. I tried it only because the picture caught my eye and am glad I did. I don't even like vanilla, orange, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. Regardless, I would drink this again. Somehow the cocoa and the orange really make it a treat that isn't too much of any one flavor. They all balance and blend nicely. As far as method is concerned though, I would warm the milk and mix all the ingredients EXCEPT the coffee in a mug then, once combined well, add the hot coffee. Otherwise your coffee will get cold. I ended up popping it in the microwave for a few seconds because I like hot coffee. Otherwise it really is a nice cup to share with a cookie. Thanks magicdress for sharing this recipe.

Good, but way too much cinnamon and too bitter, I would double the milk and half everything else minus brown sugar, I also put in 1 Table spoon white sugar. However, I do not like spices like cinnamon or nutmeg, if I did this would have been much more welcoming.

In my opinion it need a bit more sugar. I may have made my coffee too strong also, so that may have contributed to the lack of sugar, I also didn't use all the orange extract, but otherwise it was very good.
