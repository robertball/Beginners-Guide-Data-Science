Delicious! I only used 1T butter because of the cholesterol. The rest was olive oil. Didn't know if I was supposed to really use 2 'heads' of garlic, which seemed like a bit much, or 2 'cloves' so I used 5 cloves and we thought it was just right. Didn't have lemon pepper so I used 1/2 lemon and fresh ground pepper. Used Turkey breast strips. It was eaten up so quickly I'm surprised someone didn't get a fork in their hand! I know everyone will be wanting this again and soon. Thanks! It was so easy!

Very good, not to mention quick and easy. I didn't even bother flouring the chicken, I just cooked it in the butter, garlic and lime juice. I do recommend cutting the chicken into strips, though, so that all the chicken absorbs the flavors. I also put some of the sauce on top of steamed broccoli - excellent. My husband loved it.

This chicken recipe is wonderful!!!  The leftover juices in the pan work wonderfully over rice. And if I can make it, you know it's easy to prepare!

This was tasty. I used olive oil instead of butter and used a lot less of it. I think some lime zest in the flour would be good next time. I liked the lime flavcor a lot.

This chicken really turned out great. A nice quick meal with great flavour. I only added a few tablespoons of butter though, a cup seems like a lot. I actualy added half the lime while the chicken was cooking for a little extra flavour along with a couple splashes of tequila. Tasted great served with mashed potatoes and fried zuchinni. I omitted the lemon pepper since i don't have any and am not quite sure what that is.

This was such an easy recipe!! It was so easy my 3 year old even helped me make it. She helped shake the chicken in the bag. The lime juice really tops it off. It just needed a little more seasoning, but other than that it was great! Next time I make it I'll season it with seasoning salt, garlic powder, and lemon pepper.

The flavors of garlic and lime were a nice combination- what looked like ordinary fried chicken pieces had that little kick of lime taste.  I served it with angel hair pasta.  I also added an onion and some cilantro.

Very delicious! I did cut way back on the butter though, for health reasons--used just a little bit for taste and then butter flavored cooking spray. Only difference I could tell was that we didn't really have any "leftover" sauce.

It is like pulling teeth to get my hubby into the kitchen, but when I told him what was for dinner tonight he shockingly asked to help with me telling him step by step our 3 children were blown away with a healthy and tastey meal. Thanks so much for the new family fave!

My husband loved the flavors in this.  I subbed olive oil for quite a bit of the butter, all but 1/4 cup. I added juice of 1 lime to the butter and garlic and then cooked the chicken. After cooking the chicken, I added flour to the pan, made a roux and then added more lime juice and chicken broth to make a gravy/sauce and served over rice - very good.

Wonderful combination!!  I cut back on the butter, used alittle olive oil with the butter, sliced fresh limes and had them in the pan cooking with the chicken, and then added fresh cilantro, a nice healthy chopped bunch. This is a grand recipe!!  Thanks Cristina for sharing!!

Easy, quick and yummy! I used only a quarter cup of butter and chopped my garlic in thick slices and it was very tasty to eat along with the chicken. I also added the lemon pepper in with the flour rather than adding it at the end. It's a keeper!

everyone in the house loved this. We used less butter and more lime and it was excellent!!!
It is now the most asked for dish in the recipe box and there are never any leftovers.

Made a few modifications, but the chicken came out a little dry when cooked by the recipe.

I'm very sorry, but my husband and I didn't like this recipe. I had my doubts to begin with, but gave it a shot. I was especially suspicious about cooking the garlic for so long, but I tried it anyway. It turned brown and crispy, and we had to stop cooking the chicken to rid the dish of all the garlic. However, the flavor of the burned garlic remained and destroyed any flavor the chicken might have had. The lime and lemon pepper didn't do anything special. I probably won't try this again, but for those who want to give it a go, I'd suggest cooking the garlic separately in a bit of olive oil for 3-4 minutes on medium-low heat, removing from heat to cool, and adding it at the end with some chopped cilantro and lime juice on top of the chicken.

Delicious! This recipe is definitely a keeper. My daughter doesn't usually eat chicken but the smell encouraged her to try it.  She devoured her first serving and went back for seconds. I sliced the chicken into thin strips before coating them  and served them on a bed of angel hair pasta.  The butter and lime made a delicious sauce for the pasta.

Great recipe, only thing I'd suggest is that garlic powder works just as well as diced garlic and doesn't have the overpowering taste that the remaining chunks of garlic do when you use diced. One person I served it to said that it was a bit 'floury', but nobody else noticed and so I'm chalking that one up to personal tastes :)

This recipe gets any stars at all for having the basic ingredients and several kind people with helpful suggestions. The proportions are all wrong in my opinion. I used 1/4 of the amount of but and 2 limes. Any more fat would have ruined the chicken and made a slimy, greasy mess. With adjustments, it was quite tasty.

I didn't bother with butter. I used lemon-flavored grapeseed oil and liberal amounts of lime juice. My husband said it was one of his favorite things I've made, even considering the greatness of the steaks I make. And that is saying something for chicken! 

I thought it was delicious and I could eat it every day!

This is quick, easy, and tasty.  I think a cup of butter is a misprint.  I just use a couple of tablespoons to saute the chicken.  Sometimes instead of the flour coating, I marinate in Italian drsng. and then cook.  My four year old chows down on this.

This is delicious! We made a few changes. We added chili powder & lemon pepper to the flour, and used seasoned salt rather than plain salt. We added lime zest & some lime juice as the chicken was cooking. Then more at the end. We had Zatarain's yellow rice and some steamed zucchini with it. We will make this again!

Loved loved loved! So easy and perfect for a week night dinner. Followed everything exactly except I added a little bit more lime, but my family loves the taste of lemon's and lime. Did not take long at all. I will be using this again soon!

This was ok. Cut way back on the amount of butter (1 cup??!), and pounded the chicken flat so that the strips would cook quicker and the garlic wouldn't burn. If I were to make this again, I'd marinate the chicken in the lime juice. Thanks anyway!

This was so good and so easy. Put the sauce on rice to have with it. There was nothing left at the end of dinner in the pan. Not even any drippings.

I loved this chicken, though next time I'll probably leave off the breading.  I did zest the lime and added it to the butter to give extra flavor.  I only used 2-8 garlic cloves and that was plenty.  One thing I did that helped keep it from drying out the 2nd time I made it was after the chicken was browned on one side, I flipped it, turned down the heat, then added the lime juice.  I sprinkled with fresh chopped cilantro and put a lid on it for an extra 10 minutes and it had so much flavor!

Easy,good, and fast. For a complete meal, I served with rice and  canned French Green Beans. Leftover pan drippings were good over both the beans and the rice.

First of all i am not the type of person to write reviews for any thing. I always use this site and this is the first great thing that i have found. i am terrible in the kitchen and this one is fool proof kids.I followed the recipe all except i made a little sauce with the lime juice and lemon pepper, i also added a bit of smoked paprika and cayenne peper and threw it on one chicken was nearly done, covered it and let it steam for a minute. AMAZING ! i was so happy and proud that i could feed myself a QUICK and extra YUMMY meal!!  this one will be on for dinner again and agian! take care!

Very easy to make, you just need to remember that you can tailor this recipe to match your individual taste.  I used 1/4 cup butter, 3tsp olive oil and one garlic bulb for two large chicken breasts.  The garlic only needs a few minutes to cook so keep that in mind and saute it separately if you think the chicken will take longer to cook.  Esp if you leave the breasts whole instead of slicing.  Some adobo seasoning, black pepper, or cilantro can be added instead of lemon pepper to enhance the garlic lime theme.  Overall, we love this!

I tried this last night in our house and everyone loved it!! I was cooking for 8 people and the recipe recommended I use 4 whole heads of Garlic!! I thought this was a bit too much so I halved the amount of garlic in mine and it was perfect. I served it with a very special rice which had salt, butter, cilantro, tomatoes and a tiny bit of lime rind through it. I twas delicious - try it! I also made my own sauce as a sige for the chicken and those who opted for the sauce wanted more - it really was a hit with this dish. My sauce was made with cream, salt, black pepper, garlic powder and grated parmesan cheese. This really is a great side with this chicken. I will definitely cook this again and I think my friends will too as they couldn't wait to ask me for the recipe and it was so fast and easy.

This has to be one of the best chicken recipes I've made. After reading some reviews, i did what others said and used only half the amount of butter, it was perfect. I have the pickiest husband, and he LOVED it, as he said...this is a chicken that you savor! Great recipe:)

I made this dish tonight and after dinner I had to run to the computer to rate it! It was a huge hit with my family! (especially my picky kids) I only made two changes. I only used 1/2 cup of Margarine and I did not have bulbs of garlic on hand. I used lots of minced garlic from the jar! It turned out so good my daughter asked me if she could have the leftovers tomorrow for dinner! Ha my kids don't ever eat leftovers! This is defintely a keeper thanks!

I really like this recipe.  The flavor combination is heavenly.  I tried it with cubed tofu (2 packages, 28 oz. total), using 1 stick butter, & about 6 cloves of garlic, and it worked perfectly. I wasn't watching the garlic while cooking and almost burned it.  Half a cup of flour is plenty.  I didn't have lemon pepper, so I used a light sprinkling of Mrs. Dash table blend. I will definitely make this again, with both chicken and tofu.

Awesome!  Adjust the seasonings to fit your own tastes.  My kids did not care for the lime, and since it is added at the very end, is easy to leave some chicken plain, some with lime.  Hubby and I loved the lime flavor, it was delicious, have made it twice, and also made it for a friend.

The flavor was ok but a little bland for me. I wish I had added a little spice to it, like cayenne pepper. I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup flour, as was suggested, and served with rice.

This was soo good. I made it with the cheesy tortillas. I would suggest cutting the flour to 1/2 c. instead of 1 c. 
Way too much butter. I put about two tablespoons of olive oil and maybe 1/4c. butter...way too much!!! This was soo
tasty! We loved it

first time i have rated any of the recipes after discovering this fabulous site which is transforming my family's diet...... this is supremely simple however tastes very very good. 
(i must be new and genuine about this as i cant figure out how to award a half star to get to 4.5 and surely 5 must be too many for such simplicity?
with best wishes

This was actually very good! Much like the other reviewers, I used considerably less butter so there wasn't any "extra sauce" after it was done. I also used about 7 cloves of garlic and it seemed to be the perfect touch. I did think that a whole cup of the flour was a little too much, so next time I will use less. My boyfriend LOVED it and he's picky, so job well done. I will SURELY make this again!!

This was one of my favorite dinners.  I followed the recipe exactly (except for that I used lime juice instead of going to the store for a lime).  I made some cajun-lime shrimp to go with it.  I can't wait to make it again.

Easy to make and delicious!  Minor changes: I used just a small tab of butter and olive oil to cook the chicken.  I also added lemon pepper and a little garlic powder in the flour and doubled the Lime Juice.  It was garlic lime goodness!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

Very good, robust flavor and easy to make. I like garlic, so I doubled the amount suggested, which made it even better.

BEST chicken I have ever made!  It was so delicious, I didn't even make it to the table before I had finished it.  I cooked with half butter, half olive oil and used a whole lime....half while cooking, half after.  Definitely sprinkle with the lemon pepper afterwards, adds a nice touch.  Goes perfectly with whole grain rice...I sopped up the juices with the rice!  Will be at the front of my "family favorites" file...thank you, Cristina!

The flavor was wonderful (even without the lime juice which I did not have, but will make it with next time).  I used less butter/olive oil to try and cut down on the fat.  this is a great starter recipe which could be adapted to many different ways.

My family and I lOVED this! Only thing I did differently was I used half butter and half olive oil and I marinated the chicken in Newman's Own light lime vinaigrette first. Served it with green beans and dinner rolls. Great!

This was surprisingly great!  Only change I made was 1/2 the butter (seemed like too much) and I put the lime and lemon pepper on about 5 minutes before it was finished cooking.  INCREDIBLE!

This chicken dish was awesome!  Because I can never make a recipe without some kind of alteration here is what I did differently.  Since I love the flavor of lime I "marinated" the chicken in lime juice and garlic while starting the side dishes to my dinner. In addition I followed the suggestions and cut down the butter and substituted with olive oil.  Next time I may make it with lemon.

This recipe as written is great.  The recipe really means two heads of garlic like it says.  Cook the garlic in the butter at a low enough temperature, and the garlic wont burn.  Cut the chicken into strips, like the recipe says, and the chicken will cook through.  My family loved it, and I will cook it again.  Highly recommended.

This chicken was really good and tender. Not dry at all.  I have a 2 year old so I only used 4 cloves of garlic and I think it was just right for us.  I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 non-hydrogenated margarine. (just because butter burns so easily) I will make this again.

This was very good. I didn't use as much butter in an attempt to reduce some of the fat, cholesterol, and calories. I did slice the chicken like the recipe says. I didn't have a lime so I just used some key lime juice I had on hand. I added some chicken broth and flour to what was left in the pan after removing the chicken to make a gravy to go over the rice. My whole family enjoyed it! The strips would also be good on top of a salad

I was so surprised at how this dish tasted at the end.  Throughout the cooking process it smelled so wonderful- the taste was almost non existant- very strange.  I will not make this one again.

I'm really glad I didn't follow the instructions for this recipe, otherwise it would have been a waste of good ingredients.  I used about 1/4 cup of butter and a few Tbsp of olive oil and 5 cloves of chopped garlic.  The end result was a greasy mess of chicken which didn't taste like anything but oil.  We won't be making this again.

I don't know what happened, but I thought this would be really good. It's alright - the garlic gets too burned as the chicken cooks. If I make it again I'll use powedered garlic rather than fresh. The flour coating was a little gooey. It just alright.

Easy recipe and I used olive oil for the saute.  I didn't use enough garlic though since I used 6 big cloves.  Next time I will definitely use more.

I don't know what happened but I was not impressed with this one. I think that 1 cup of butter is way to much. I ended up throwing the left overs away. It was very greasy and it just seemed like to much work for something that didn't even taste good. I will not make this again. It would be easier to just go get some fried chicken.

I was the guy who took the picture that is currently on the site.  It turned out really well when I did it exactly as specified.  Next time I make this, I'm going to halve the butter and the oil and see how it works.  ;)  Even still, most of the butter and oil are just left in the pan after you take out the chicken.  Anyway, really good!

I enjoyed this recipe thoroughly, although I did use a lot less garlic.  I absolutely adore garlic but alas, the other half is less of a fan.  I'll have to make it again one day for lunch, just for me, so I can garlic it up :)

Loved this recipe!  I didn't have fresh garlic so used garlic paste instead, that was my only change.  Turned out beautiful.  We LOVE garlic here so had I had the fresh stuff I don't think it would have been over powering as some reviews said, it's all in your personal taste though so some who just like a hint of garlic flavor would want to cut it back.  I laughed at all the people cringing at "all that butter". You end up with a lot of it left in the pan, it's not all being ingested. Butter isn't evil. I also placed my chicken strips on a paper towel for a minute so I didn't experience that greasiness that some complained of.  Nuked my limes for 20 seconds because heating them makes it easier to get more juice out of a fresh lemon or lime.  Served with rice and garlic green beans.  Will try it with angel hair next time as another reviewer did.  Next time I will sprinkle with a touch of shaved parm once the meal is plated.

There wasn't as much flavor as I thought there was gonna be. The next time I make this I'll add a bit more spices to the mix and maybe also try without coating in flour.

The overall flavor was good but I didn't heed the warnings of 2 cups of butter and I felt like it was a bit greasy. Next time around I'm just going to use olive oil. I added some cilantro and the lemon pepper to the flour mixture. Has great potential. Thanks for the idea. Maybe cook the garlic before hand to avoid burning? Will try again

I made this tonight as a fast supper with rice and squash.  So simple and easy with so few ingredients.  Very quick and was on the table 25 min. after I got home from the market!  It was also delicious!  I cut the garlic back more than 1/2 and thought it came out just right for us.  Personal taste.  As written, it would be great for garlic lovers who can't get enough.  This is a very easy, quick weekday meal that I will definitely repeat. I would suggest that if you try it, stick to using butter and not olive or any other oil or butter substitute in order to avoid the greasiness others experienced, to help capture all the flavors, and enhance the lime.  I am rating it a 4 ONLY because of the excessive garlic amount as written.  I think those who really love garlic would tend to add more anyway.  But, GREAT MEAL!

It came out pretty good! I did substitute the butter with coconut oil and instead of flour, I used bread crumbs. Bay seasoning was added for just a little more flavor. It was fast and easy!

Came across this recipe when time and ingredients were short. My husband and I both loved it. Obviously with just the two of us we cut back all of the ingredients, but other than that we followed the recipe and ended up with flavorful, tender, savory chicken. Served them with roasted potatoes sprinkled with cumin, chili , and cayenne powders and fresh green beans. Delicious! Will be serving this again!

Recipe produces very tough, dry chicken.  It calls for an absurd amount of butter (1 cup!?) but when prepared as directed sauteing for 15 minutes, it way overdoes the chicken.  If you do it for less time, though, you don't get the nice crispy sear that is pictured.  This recipe has potential, so I gave it 2 stars.  But it needs serious work.

A simple recipe that would almost anybody would like.  But use less butter, for goodness sakes!  Unless you're really going for the deep-fry effect, half a stick of butter will do.

This was a great recipe. Followed the instructions pretty closely. Used minced garlic from a jar and lime juice from the store, but other than that kept to the original ingredients. Cooked covered to keep the chicken moist. Paired well with rice dish and fresh greens from the garden! My hubbie and I both loved it.

So good! And so easy to make. I skipped the lemon pepper (didn't have any) And it still rocked. I like to pair it w salad using the lemon dressing from Louise from Australia (from this site). Thanx!!!

Very quick and simple, yet still delicious! Lime and garlic make a great combination, and this way of preparing chicken ensures that it retains its juices and doesn't dry out, but still comes out crispy!

i made this today for lunch for something different, and if you like a little more flour wash the chicken first, the water will help coat it, and i ended up cooking until the outside was crunchy just my preference, i made enough so i thought i would have some for work... between 3 of us we ate 6 servings... nap time lol

Great!  My husband loves garlic, so he really loved this.  I did substitute some of the butter for olive oil though. Very easy and fast.  I will be making this again!

Followed the recipe exactly the first time, turned out very delicious. Was concerned with the amount of the butter though so decided to try 3TBS of butter and 1/2 cup of olive oil and kept everything else the same, turned out just as great but healthier. Thanks for the recipe since this is a keeper!

First off I did change the recipe, so I'm rating it as I made it, but kept the basic gist of it. I used about 1/2 stick of butter and some olive oil, added minced garlic and cooked a little. Threw in chicken strips. When almost done I deglazed the pan with a little white wine, then when fully done, I added some lemon and herb seasoning and it was very good. I just didn't feel that adding the flour would do anything to this recipe, and it made it a little healthier. Very good, thanks for the recipe. Also I never added the lime, I didn't have any.

I used olive oil instead of butter and much less. I used a little bit to saute the chicken. Next time I will save the calories and just bake it or saute it quickly and then add some chicken stock to continue cooking the chicken instead of adding more oil. Nice flavor and very soft.

My husband really likes this recipe. It has a lot of flavor. My only advise is to serve it with something a little more bland (i.e. rice). I also used chicken tenders and it turned out great.

I'm not sure if it was something that I did wrong, but the garlic burned and gave a bitter taste to the chicken, and the lime flavor wasn't strong enough for my liking.  I really wanted this dish to work out, so I will try it again with a few changes; I will remove the garlic from the oil after it is "toasted" and I will add lime zest with the lemon pepper at the end.

Excellent recipe, my family loved it and wished there were leftovers. I'll be making this again and again. The only thing I changed was I used Olive Oil to fry the chiken in and I didn't have the lemon pepper so I used lime pepper and it was terrific. Thank you for the recipe.

My family enjoyed this, but I wasn't thrilled about all that butter and it did cook up a little gummy.  I do plan to try this again, but I'll either switch to olive oil or a combination of butter and olive oil like another reviewer suggested.  Also, I used half white flour and half whole wheat flour which I try to do as often as possible.  The flavor was good, I just couldn't get past all that butter.

I used 1/2 stick of butter but then had to add a few tablespoons of olive oil.  I discovered that I really, REALLY do not like lemon pepper.  It's strange.  A little bit goes a LONG way.  My husband, who is a meat and potato guy, hated this meal.  My mom and dad really liked it, and I thought it was just okay and wouldn't make it again.  I used 1/2 a lime and it was plenty.  And the recipe said it makes 4 servings...we are big eaters, but there seemed to be 1/3 left over, so in my opinion it's more like 6 servings.  I had side dishes of mashed potatoes and peas, so maybe by itself it makes 4 servings, but not with side dishes.

Taste was good and preparation was very easy.  Next time I make this I won't use the flour coating.  It didn't add any flavor, and kind of cooked up gummy.  Otherwise, this recipe was super easy and I had all the items on hand.

Awesome! The boys ate it right up, and then kept picking at the leftovers...I had to hide them so I'd have something for lunch the next day! I sauteed a bit of onion with the garlic, and used less butter than called for...spiced up the flour with some garlic powder and a little chili powder...and I used the juice of a lemon instead of a lime, cuz that's what I had in the house...it was great, and next time I'll buy a couple limes special. I served it in pita pockets with fresh greens and light cheddar cheese. Thanks all!

I had to cook the chicken for way longer than the recipe called for, but once it finally finished, it was great.  I would recommend cutting the chicken breasts into smaller pieces, so they cook faster.

I didn't have any lemon-pepper or lime.  I used about 1/2 of the butter (saving some on the side for side dish of broccoli), still turned out so tender and flavorful!  Best chicken I've ever made in a frying pan or saute' pan.  My husband went back for seconds (that's saying a lot, usually my chicken gets over-cooked and tough).

I loved this chicken dish.  I added lemon pepper to the flour, used only olive oil, added cilantro, and used lemon instead of lime only because I didn't have any lime.  It was great  this way.

I really liked this recipe. I have not had a meal like that in a long time. I had everything but the lime but it was great. I do think that the garlic amount may be a bit much and that 3/4 cup butter is a bit much too. When you try it you will see. Its Easy to adjust. I will definitly make it again.

This was very good with a little alterations as suggested by other reviewers!.. I mixed butter and olive oil in my fry pan, about 1/4 cup of each.  I waited until the last 5 minutes to add my garlic, and it still turned dark and crispy!  Next time I'll add only a few minutes before ready.  I already had breast tenders which are sliced thin.  I wish my lime had more juice, but I've been getting dry limes from our store lately!... I cooked each piece of chicken aprox. 4 min each side... Very moist and good!  I will make this again!

This recipe was amazing. My family just loved it! It must have been gone within a matter of seconds. whenever i make chicken it comes out really dry so i when i fried it i threw in a few slices of lime and it made the chicken really moist and juicy. Thanks for the recipe!

We love this recipe and our kids 5,3, and 2 years old love it too, I do add the whole lime at the end just because we like lime juice.And adding the lemon-pepper salt at the end it makes the difference.

Just wonderful! I wasnt sure about the flavors when I started, but the garlic and lime melded perfectly. I cut down on the flour and butter, but added dabs of butter as needed while the chicken was cooking. My boyfriend actually praised the dish!

I made this and it was just okay. Kind of bland. I might make it again if I had the ingredients on hand, but I wouldn't go buy ingredients just to make it.

Great! with some changes:  I used mostly olive oil (just little butter),  less garlic (used minced garlic),I pounded my chicken  and  I sautéed the garlic less time to avoid burning.  Skip the lemon pepper (didn’t have it.) Chicken was very good & tasty. I served it with the -avocado mango tomato salsa -from this site.  Thanks for the idea.

Not a bad dish.  I thought  it was lacking a little in flavor, but it smells wonderful cooking.  My husband and I sliced the strips and tossed them  in a wrap with a little thai chili sauce on his, and buffalo wing sauce on mine.  We both loved this chicken with our wraps.

This was an excellent recipe. Only thing I did wrong was not make enough. I used olive oil instead of butter. (trying to cut back on fat). and not quite 2 heads of garlic more like 1.5.

I did not care for this recipe. Maybe I didn't use enough garlic, but I found it to be too buttery and not quite worth the calories.

AMAZING!!!! Both my husband and I loved this recipe. It is one that I'll definitely make for company. I did use more garlic then called for, just because we really enjoy garlic.

This recipe was awesome!  I'm a vegitarian, but I made this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it!  I put the lime juice in with the butter and garlic instead of on top at the end.  For as simple and quick as this was to make and the rave review I got from making it, this is a definate 5 stars!

It's good and easy to make. I don't really have any suggestions on how to improve upon it.  It's not really an Oooh-ahher for me, but it's tasty and i'll make it again.

Very good!  I pounded my chicken to 1/4" and left it in pieces rather than strips.  When I was making my shopping list, I misread the recipe and thought it only called for 2 cloves of garlic rather than 2 heads of garlic.  So I used all the garlic I had--about 2/3 the recipe amount.  I omitted the lemon pepper and just used black pepper and extra lime.  Thanks for this quick, easy, and delicious recipe!

Delicious, both tangy and smooth, just as promised.  I only used 1/4 cup of  butter, and that was plenty.  Very quick and easy and good, I'll keep this one in mind.

this chicken was excellent.  I will definitely make it again.  I only had about 4 large garlic cloves and it still had plenty of flavor.  
The chicken did not make good leftovers though.

This recipe was not bad...I served it over angel hair pasta and I found it a bit on the dry side.  Hubby liked it so I will probably make it again.
