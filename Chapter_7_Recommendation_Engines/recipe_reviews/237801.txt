As written, the amounts are WAY off.  According to the recipe, this one single drink has 2 tablespoons (1 ounce) of gin to 16 ounces of tonic water. This would be so watered down that it's barely alcoholic. I highly suggest you make it using standard drink proportions - 1.5oz of gin to 3oz of tonic water...or 2oz gin to 4oz tonic.  I liked the fresh flavor from the watermelon, but it was very subtle. Next time I'll muddle some watermelon in a shaker with the gin, add ice, then strain it into a glass with more watermelon cubes. I'll be making this again as a regular summer drink.
