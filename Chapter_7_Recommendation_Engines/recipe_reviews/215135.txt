I’m so glad I tried this recipe! True to the description, the simmering jam had my kitchen smelling like Christmas. It tastes wonderful and has set up nicely after about 12 hours. Do take the time to read the instructions for “cooked jam” that come with the powdered pectin. It’s important to measure out the sugar ahead of time as it needs to be added all at once. Also, if you live above 1,000 feet  above sea level, you will need to increase the processing time by 5 minutes (I processed mine for 15 minutes because of this). Processing time increases again at 3,000 ft. Check the guidelines to be sure your jars are processed correctly. I couldn’t find 12 oz jelly jars, so I went with the 8 oz ones. I expected to get 15 jars, but only got 12. Still, this is a five-star recipe. I can’t wait to include this jam in Christmas gift baskets! Thank you for sharing your recipe!

While I'm not a fan of fresh plums (too perfume-y), I tend to like plum chutneys & after reading reviews, decided to give this a try.  I'm SO glad that I did!  I like cloves & all spice and made this EXACTLY as written.  While my 1st batch did not come out as jellied as I thought it might,  it is absolutely delicious and does indeed have holiday spice undertones.  I plan on using this on baked pork loin, hams & as a dollop in my baked scones,  however, I've already been using this for wraps.  I take smoked turkey, swiss cheese (or havarti if I have it) lettuce & use this as the condiment on a wrap.  I've also used it on wraps with Black Forest Ham.  It turns an ordinary lunch into something heavenly and EVERYONE that has tried it, RAVED about how good this is.  This is one of the easier jams I've made and truly, one of my favorite recipes here at Allrecipes.  This one is a keeper &, of course, you can adjust the spices to your taste.  It's beautiful to look at, the aroma is magnificent and the taste is sweet, spicy and reminiscent of Grandma's kitchen at Christmas.  Thank you, Rachel for a brilliant contribution.

Excellent! Just delicious on baked chicken. I want to try it on pork chops next. We don't like anything too sweet so I cut the pineapple amount in half and increased the plums to 14 to make up for it, then cut the sugar to 6 cups. I used the juice of 1 fresh orange, which was just the right amount. I plan to give jars as gifts because I think it's so good. Thanks so much.

absolutely delightful!  This jam not only smells like Christmas but it tastes like it too. I did vary a bit by using what I had on hand.  I used 2 c. canned crushed pineapple and it's juice the rest I followed as written.   Absolutely wonderful!

The Jam turned out great!  Very sweet.  I think it would go well with chicken or pork.  The taste reminds me of Spiced Tea Mix that you sometimes get at the holidays.  Overall, a good recipe worth sharing.

Too much clove for me, but otherwise I like the texture and the full fruit flavors - the plum, pineapple and orange are a nice combo.   I substituted 2 cups crushed w/juice for the fresh pineapple as suggested by another & it worked very well.  Definitely will cut the clove next time to maybe 1/4 tsp and add 1/4 tsp cinnamon.  As is, I will have to use it strictly as a glaze for maybe hams, or pork loin, or ....? I'll try it on a variety of meats & label it as a glaze. For me this yeilded 12 8 oz jars.  That's a lot of glaze ....  wish it had turned out tastier as jam.

WAY too much clove for my tastes.  I would consider making it again with only 1/2 tsp of clove.  The flavors of the fruit get lost with all the clove it calls for.

This was the first jam I ever made and I really like it.  I gave it away for Christmas gifts.  I just had some on crackers with cream cheese and it was amazing! I added sugar to taste and it still set up just fine.  I used quite a bit less than the recipe called for. Thanks!

Changed a few ingredients to what was available and in my pantry. Used black plums, no need for red food coloring. Used canned pineapple, about half cup, juice of  two oranges instead of frozen, and juice of two small lemons. Added only half teaspoon of cloves and allspice, and three cups of sugar. Love it! Tangy from the lemon juice. I like a thin jam for scones, flavor my tea in winter, or use in a cup of hot water when I've had enough caffeine for the day.

I WILL make it again. I made it with 1 tsp cloves instead of 1.5 tsp and it was STILL too much. I would also decrease the sugar to 7 cups and do 1/2 tsp cloves and 1/2 tsp allspice next time. It reminds my Peruvian husband of a drink called Chicha Morada, a drink made in Peru with purple corn and lots of allspice and clove. (and cinnamon). He loved the jam. This made two of the taller jam jars and 8 of the 1/2 pint jam jars of jam, in case you need to know.

I've made marmalade in the past, but thought I'd make a new jam for homemade Christmas gifts. This is spectacular!  Followed the recipe exactly and there is no reason to make alterations. If you cut back the sugar, it will not set properly. The spices are perfect, the color gorgeous. No need to add coloring. Thank you for sharing, I'll be making this another Christmas tradition!

Great recipe Andy flavour. The only negative is that even with half the sugar it is still very sweet, will make again but cut down even further on the sugar.

Very tasty! I puréed the fruit in a blender after it was cooked. I didn't add the red food coloring and it was still a pretty red color.  I did not peel the plums and after pureeing the fruit you can't tell there's peelings in with the jam. Our son took a reluctant taste and said "yum, this is good, can I have more?"

This recipe was amazing. I had never made jam before and it came out perfectly! I'm on a canning kick lately and I can't wait to make another batch. Question: could you substitute fresh cranberries for the pineapple? I would like to try that variation too.

Oh my, it really does smell like Christmas in my kitchen right now! Just about done with the recipe and I can already tell that it is going to thicken up nicely, even without the packet of pectin. Just kept it at a low boil until it reached 220 degrees. Can't wait to hand this out as gifts this year!

Great recipe!!! I made a few changes.  I used 4 1/2 cups of sugar cane, added 1/2 cup of lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoons of nutmeg and ground cloves, used no pectin, but cooked slow. At the end of cooking, I added 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla and almond.  It took me 7 hours to get to the desired thickness I wanted.   It was well worth the time.  My family loves it.

It isn't don't cooling yet,  and I might have blended it too well. It's not that chunky.  Spiced plum butter maybe?  LOL, it sure did taste good though!  It's already set,  smells great!

This is one of my favorites! A little more work, but well worth it. I gave it as a gift, and then received a text late that night telling me it was the best jam they had ever tasted!
