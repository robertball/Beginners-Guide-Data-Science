11-05-2105 ~I am so happy to be the first reviewer when I can go on and on about how good the recipe is.  I allowed myself one of these beautiful cookies  and was sad when it was gone.  But wait!  I forgot to finish it!  I found the rest of this delicious cookie sitting on the kitchen counter!  Bonus!  These are good....reeeeal good.  First, they bake up real pretty.  No misshapen cookies here!  And I didn't even chill the dough first as I always do - the dough was dry enough, firm enough, that I thought I'd just take my chances and bake them up right away, so Hubs wouldn't have to scrounge around another night for something to satisfy his sweet tooth.  I liked when I saw these called  for all white sugar, which indicated to me that they'd be a crispier cookie, just like I like 'em.  If you prefer them softer, by all means use half white and half brown sugar.  But not me.  The Rice Krispies certainly add interest - biting into all those little crispy bits is pure delight.  These almost taste like a sugar cookie with chocolate chips and those crispy crunchy bits.  And this is the easiest and fastest dough ever to throw together.  I wish I would have made a double batch!  (Note: I did not grease or spray the cookies sheets, nor would I recommend it. Also, I did not use margarine nor would I recommend that either.  Make a darned GOOD cookie using the best ingredients, and that would mean butter, not margarine.)

I'm writing this review while the first batch is in the oven.  I've  been teaching "Sparrow", my eight year old granddaughter (she's bigger than a pickle jar now) some cooking basics. I'm always on the lookout for easy & interesting recipes.  She's graduated to some simple baking recipes.  She loves to make rice krispies treats so this caught my eye & I'm giving it a test run.  I can't wait to eat a baked one.  I know they'll be awesome because I can't  stop eating the cookie dough!!  I always use real butter and, I used half brown sugar because I do like chewy cookies.  The crunch of the cereal is a great addition though.  Thanks Naples - You never steer us wrong!!    15 minutes later....  OH YEAH!  Chewy, gooey, with a light airy crunch.  AND,  they're almost as pretty as Naples picture.  That doesn't happen for me often (lol)

Butter is the only way to go with this recipe.  The cookies come out crispy with just the right amount of chips. Based on requests to make these again, they are definitely a five star cookie.

What a great little sleeper of a recipe this is! The only way I diverged from the recipe was to use half brown sugar. This is, as has been mentioned before, a firm dough. What I found is that this dough spreads very little during baking. The first Ã­batch resulted in high-mounded, little hemispheres. So on the second batch, I flattened the spoonfuls lightly before baking. Those looked bigger and less rounded. The first batch wanted to stick to the sheet, so on the second batch, I pried them free as soon as they came out of the oven, when they release easily. Like the dough, the baked cookies are quite sturdy, even immediately after removal from the oven. The texture is a combination of crunch from the cereal, punctuated with a nice dose of chewiness. Perfect, hearty, cookie-jar cookie.

An interesting twist on chocolate chip cookies.  The rice crispies gave it an interesting chewiness.  I wasn't sure I liked it at first,  but it grew on me.

Very good - the kris pies add crunch, but also some chewiness.

I thought the cookies were good, a nice change from the standard recipe.  My kids, however, were not crazy for the texture.

I love the crispiness s of Rice Krispies in candy bars so I knew I would like these cookies just based on the fact that they include Rice Krispies.  I used half white sugar and half brown sugar (it's not a chocolate chip cookie without brown sugar!) and I worried that the cookie would be dry because the dough wasn't as moist as other cookie recipes but it turned out very moist and delicious.  I would recommend these cookies to anyone who wants a twist on the traditional.

My new favorite.....  So easy to prepare (had my first bite in less than 30 minutes of starting the recipe), and for such a simple recipe, it pays off with big rich rewards:  jam-packed with flavor, surprisingly crisp, and yet so elegant--both kids and adults will love them.  Brilliant!!!

Adapted this recipe to use up leftover bite sized nestle crunch bars from Halloween.  They replaced the rice crispies and the chocolate chips in the recipe and were so good (looking as well as tasting)  that they are going on the holiday cookie platters!
