I made a quick BLT pasta salad for tonight and used this as seasoning for a homemade creamy dressing. The only change I made was cutting back on the salt, adding a couple pinches of sea salt. VERY good.

I made this tonight for my pasta. I didn't put in parmesan cheese (because I don't like it), I cut back the salt to 1 1/4 teaspoons, and added a pinch more pepper. After using it on my pasta, I do believe that it had a little too much garlic as I ate my dinner a couple hours ago & the garlic aftertaste is still very strong. But all the other herbs compliment eachother very well and I had all of them already in my cabinet! Thanks Misti for this great herb mix!!

I made this tonight to put on a salad and it was pretty good. It gave it a flavor blast of goodness. I also cut the salt in half and it was perfect. Thanks Misti Jackson.

Wanted quick pasta salad that was less sodium laden than packaged pasta salads but with some flavor. Found this recipe and have been using it ever since! It makes the pasta salad stand out and get noticed. Family loves it so I make a batch to keep on hand. I didn't have powdered Parmesan cheese and don't really care for it so I add the shredded Parmesan cheese to the salad, when I remember it. Good both ways! Thanks for the recipe

This is good on salad, pasta, pizza and just about anything that needs extra seasoning.
