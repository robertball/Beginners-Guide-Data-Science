I needed a sugar free barbecue sauce recipe and this worked well. I used in in pulled pork and it got excellent response from those that tried it. My husband says it is a keeper. He cannot have sugar so was pleased to have a barbecue sauce he could use.

As it stands this recipe is far to tart from all the citrus. I followed the recipe exactly as it was written. I think the author may have intended the orange juice to be prepared prior to adding 12 ounces of it. I would try it again with 12 oz of prepared oj instead of the oj concentrate but there are other recipes out there more worthy of my time.
