I've made this recipe for a few years now (we always called it tortellini primavera) and every time I make it, I make a few changes. To cut down on fat, as many people mentioned, use skim milk, and instead of fat free cream cheese (which I've found really does significantly affect the taste negatively) I use neufchatel cheese which has about a third less fat but retains the flavor. Also, I've never made it with cherry tomatoes, either just chop up some plum tomatoes, or try using a package of sundried tomatoes instead for a little more interesting flavor. Baby portabellos can be substituted for white mushrooms, etc. This recipe is one of my favorites and has room for lots of possibilities.

I'm 19, and this was the first REAL dinner I made for my non-vegetarian parents. It turned out great, almost as if I came straight from a restaurant. I took the advice from others by additionally adding a can of diced tomatoes with green chillies. This gave the dish a little "kick." I also added Italian seasoning, salt, pepper and artichoke hearts. Great dish. Simple enough for a 19 year old college student to make :)

This recipe was really good.  I added 3 cloves of minced garlic with the onions which was added some more flavor.  I also added 1 can of drained diced tomatoes with green chilies with the spinach mixtured to add some spice.  This dish was very rich and creamy.  Very filling.  Another suggestion that might be good is to add some artichoke hearts.  Highly recommended.

I liked it, but it was very heavy. I doubled the recipe (except for the spinach) and left out the mushrooms. I think next time I would put in more flavoring, like garlic or italian seasoning (like someone suggested). So it was really good but really rich!!     EDIT: I haven't made this in a long time - I wish I had! I doubled the recipe again, including the spinach, left out the mushrooms, and added some garlic powder. It got rave reviews from the family!

This was absolutely incredible - definetly restaurant quality and so simple! I added Italian seasonings, salt and pepper, and a couple tablespoons of pesto. I also substituted roma tomatoes because I didn't have cherry tomatoes- super delicious. Next time I think I will double the tomatoes. This dish is incredibly rich so I recommend serving small portions and then have plenty of green leaf salad to balance out the richness. Thanks so much for the great recipe!

This was REALLY good!  I also changed it up a bit so couldn't give it 5 stars, but with my mods, I would!

I also cut the amount of cream cheese & spinach in half (4 oz. cream cheese and 5 oz. of spinach).  I sauteed 3 minced garlic cloves with the onion and added some fresh chopped basil, 1/2 tsp of italion seasoning, and a few dashes of salt.  I didn't have any mushrooms or I would have added them and we're not big tomato eaters here so I omitted those as well.  Even with reducing the cream cheese, this recipe was still very rich.  The next time I make it I will use skim milk instead of 2% and I will add a little bit more of it.  I may even cut back on the cream cheese a bit more.  But I will definitely make it again!  My kids gobbled it up. :)

I liked this with all the adjustments other reviewers suggested.  I used 3/4 cup of milk and half a packet of Italian dressing seasoning for the blandness others were talking about.  To cut back on fat, I used neufatchel cheese and sauteed the onions with garlic.  With all the liquid from the tomatoes and spinach plus the extra milk, I found myself with too much sauce.  It was the right consistency, but I probably should've used more than 9 oz of tortellini.  Great way to prepare some extra spinach I had on hand.

I used the lowfat cream chese, 1 cup of milk, 3 cloves of garlic and 3 cups of dry tortellini.  It was easy & fast to make, creamy & it was good.

This was an amazingly easy dinner to throw together! I used spinach stuffed tortellini as it was all I had on hand, and for the sauce, I used 95% fat-free cream cheese, 1% milk and I am sure that lowered the calories a ton! Along with using a wee bit of Olive Oil for sauteeing the mushrooms, makes for a very waist-line friendly meal. You do not need all the calories of butter, regular cream cheese and cream/whole milk. It has a raelly nice flavour and the spinach/tomatoes make a nice colourful presentation! Thanks Jennifer for creating this dish! YUM!

This recipe is basically the same as http://allrecipes.com/recipe/spinach-cheese-tortellini/detail.aspx The only thing I did different was I made the sauce out of a jar of garlic alfredo sauce and 1/2 tub of "garlic cream cheese for baking", heated up in a saucepan. Added that sauce, along with spinach and sauteed mushroms to the cooked tortellini. Didn't use tomatoes or onion.  Came out tasty

I tweaked the recipe a bit, but it was very good with the ingredients listed.  I used 1.5 pounds of frozen tortellini, 4 oz. of cream cheese, 3/4 cup milk, 5 oz. of spinach, and peas instead of mushrooms because my husband does not like mushrooms.  Added a bit of salt and pepper to our liking, omitted the tomatoes.  It was a hit.

Unbelievably good!  Everybody loved it!  Also really hard to screw up!  I added 2 cloves of minced garlic with the onions and substituted diced canned tomatoes since I had them on hand.  Absolutely delicious!!  I also threw in some pre-cooked jumbo shrimp and sprinkled some pine nuts on top.  Can't wait to try this one again!

This recipe was a wonderful base. I added one clove fresh minced garlic and maybe an 1/8 to a 1/4 t of basil, sage, Italian seasoning, and some thyme in with the onion to saute.

This is a great dish.  My daughters (picky eaters) all wanted seconds.  I changed it up slightly as per some of the suggestions.  I used nuefchatel cheese and a clove of garlic.  I also used fresh spinach.  I will definitely be making this again.

Average, average.  Used neuchatel cheese and threw some garlic in, also halfed the sauce and there was still plenty.  Rather than using frozen spinach I used fresh and threw it in with the onion/garlic to cook (also threw the mushrooms in early to cook down a bit).  Put a pour of white wine in toward the end, but this really didn't do much for me.  Bland, and I think there are much better pasta recipes that are just as quick.

This is only my second review. I just wanted to say something about this recipe cause it was very,very good. The only change I made was more tortellini then 9oz. I used a 32 oz bag of it and it was fine. No other changes. Maybe next time I'll saute some garlic with the onion. Thanks Jennifervan77

This was yummy!  However, I have to agree with other reviewers, it is a very "heavy" meal.  I personally felt almost like cheese overload (perhaps next time I will look for a different filling in the tortellini).   The saving grace for my family that made them keep digging in?  The fresh tomatoes,  I would not skip them by adding canned, they added a fresh touch to it and the pop they added was delectable.  Everyone's comment was, "If we have this again... more tomatoes!"  Thanks for the recipe, this is going in my box but probably for a winter time, good and easy stick to your ribs meal!

I doubled the recipe (not spinach) used light cream cheese, 3 cloves garlic, salt, pepper, and 6 T of butter versus 8.  The recipe is good but sooooo rich.  You can only have a few bites which is probably a good thing since it's so unhealthy.  Serve on a bed of lettuce!  You won't even need salad dressing.

Loved making this! My boyfriend and his friend ate it, and then had seconds.  I only changed it by adding grilled chicken. Loved it, and adding it to my recipie book.

Delicious! My suggestion is to cut down the spinach to about 7 ounces (3/4 of the 10 oz. bag), add another 1/2 cup of milk, and another 2 TBSP of butter, and use a large onion.  It made it much creamier and saucier and less pasty, and blended the flavors better without the overpowering of the spinach.  Quick, easy, Great recipe!

This recipe is really great, but next time I am going to use less spinach, the ratio seemed a bit off to me.  Definitely a must try!

Wonderful recipe! Super quick and easy. I doubled the recipe so there would be enough sauce for the pasta. I used dry tortellini and raviolini from Sam's instead of fresh, baby portabellas for the mushrooms, regular cream cheese, freshly grated Parmesan cheese and skim milk. It didn't taste too rich for us and made a perfect main meal. It seemed like we had a lot more spinach than what was shown in the picture, but it was still wonderful. I love the addition of the cherry tomatoes. They give a nice fresh, sharp taste that cuts the creaminess of the sauce. Thanks for the keeper recipe!

Yum!  I have made this several times and everyone loves it.  I have always made it without the cream cheese and sometimes without tomatoes and it still comes out yummy!

This dish was delicious!!! I didn't have the exact ingrediants: I used canned mushrooms, instead of fresh, I chopped up a whole tomatoe instead of cherry, I used olive oil instead of butter to sautee because I think it's healthier. Over all my family loved this. It was easy to make!

I thought this was a very tasty, easy, quick and satisfying meal! Took MAYBE 30 minutes from start to finish! EXCELLENT! I followed the directions just as printed except for one small change, I substituted shredded parmesan for grated because it was all I could find on hand. I will definitely make this again!

The only reason I'm not giving this recipe 5 stars is because i didn't use the tortellini.  I was going on the cheap side and just used some penne I already had.  Delicious though!  I substituted the mushroom for marinated artichoke hearts (not much of a mushroom lover) and it turned out fantastic.  Thanks for the recipe!

I agree with other reviewers that this recipe is lacking some flavor. I had all the ingredients on hand. Which made this recipe sound appealing. I added more milk since other reviewers talked about it being to rich and creamy. I did not find that the case with adding 1/2cup skim milk and 1/2 cup half and half. I added more spinach to give it some more vegetables. Also used others advice and added tomatoes with green chillis canned. I think it would be totally bland if not for the subtle kick from the green chilli's. My husband thought it was good I thought it was just ok. Not worth all the calories for the taste to me.

This dish is very good and easy to make.  It wasn't very flavorful as is, but the cherry tomatoes really gave it some zing.  I sautee plenty of garlic in with the onion and butter to add some extra oomph.  This recipe has become a favorite dinner for my husband and me.

This recipe was very good and helped my italian craving.  I ended up overcooking the tortellini.  My refridgerated tortellini only needed to cook for 5 minutes, but since it was the first direction on the recipe, I did it first. I added some minced garlic in with the onions and sundried tomatoes in lieu of the cherry tomatoes.  It was very good.  The only thing that I noticed is that the frozen spinach was a little stringy in the pasta. It was good enough to make again though and my husband gave it an 8 out of 10.

I'm giving my recipe a 5 ;) I used this as a base, but adjusted the ingredients to be a little healthier and to our liking.  I used fresh spinach and sauteed with the butter/olive oil and onion that i'd put thru the food processor.  I added some garlic, and used canned chopped tomatoes w/ chilis.  And, instead of cream cheese, I actually used 2 packets of knorr sauces - Alfredo, and Pesto.  The only thing I'd recommend watching out for that I always goof is letting the tortellini cook too much - the heat of the sauces gives it a little extra cooking time and half the time i make this, they break.  My fault! :)

I don't drink milk so I almost never had it on hand. I replace the milk with left over bruschetta and it tasted great! Would probably work well with diced tomatoes and seasoning.

My dh loved this dish.  I thought is was good but a little thick on the sauce.  I used a 20 oz pkg of tortellini so I thought I better use the whole 8 ounce bar of cream cheese.  Wish I had only used 1/2 to 3/4. I did add 1 cup of milk and used a bag of fresh spinach.  I also used a can of diced tomatoes with zesty green chilies.  Added minced garlic when frying the onion and added some Italian seasoning per other reviews.  I guess I really changed this recipe alot after reading all the reviews.  But I am giving it a five star cause my husband rated it 9.5 out of 10.  Thanks for the recipe.

I folllowed the advice of adding a can of chopped tomatos with green pepper and using the nuefchatel cheese and it turned out great! However, I used fresh baby spinach and left it whole, ended up rather clumpy. Chopped spinach would have been a better choice.

I've had some bags of tortellini for a while and wanted a quick lunch and found this recipe. It is a keeper!! So quick and good. I did not have mushrooms but had a can of cream of mushroom that I used...awesome! Try adding it, adds great flavor and you do not need as much cheese to make it creamy. I added some garlic with the onions also some onion powder, nothing bland here. I also used fresh spinach, skim milk, low fat cheese. My husband loved it!! Thanks for this recipe.

The tortellini was good, but a little too thick.  I recommend adding a bit more milk, maybe 1/2 a cup more.  I used cheese tortellini- not the best choice.  Next time I think I'll try meat or spinach stuff tortellini.  The cheese in the tortellini only added to the thickness of the sauce and was a bit to heavy.  I also used fresh raw spinach (and used the rest of the spinach for a salad).

I would give this 3 1/2 stars if I could.  The basic recipe is decent, but bland.  First of all, to make it healthier and cut down the richness that so many other reviewers mentioned, I used Neufchatel cream cheese and 1% milk.  I also used whole-wheat tortellini and a bag of fresh spinach instead of frozen.  I included the mushrooms which I sauteed briefly with the onion.  Then, since so many other reviewers mentioned lack of flavor, I added fresh chopped garlic (about a Tbsp) and diced canned tomotoes with jalapenos instead of the fresh cherry tomatoes.  Even after all this, I ended up adding garlic salt and black pepper to make the flavor stand out more.  I will make this again, but only with my modifications.

A little bland, but great basic recipe to tweak to taste.  Halved the cream cheese and (skim) milk; used a 16 oz bag of frozen spinach - added to the onion/butter after mostly sauteed and did not pre-cook or drain the spinach to simplify things; added garlic powder and Italian seasonings.  Loved it with fresh garden tomatoes and threw in some Italian style turkey meatballs for a little more flavor.  My 12mo old ate it up!

This was delicious and easy to make. Since I had a larger bag of tortellini, I doubled the rest of the recipe. I agree with the other review that said it was perfect for a crisp fall day. The meal was very hearty and filling.

We felt the sauce was pretty heavy and just way too cream chees-y. The other flavors didn't come through for us. I scaled this to 2 servings for the sauce and used the full 9oz pasta(ravioli was all I had) and I felt there was still too much sauce. I sauteed in cooking spray and subbed chopped fresh spinach and 1 roma tomato. I was surprised that no amount is given for the tomatoes and mushrooms since they are mixed in rather than "toppings".  I like everything in this and it was quite easy but the proportions and one dimensional flavor will probably keep me from making this again. Sorry, but I can't imagine what the full amount of sauce would have been tolerable.

I seasoned it to my family's taste but did everything else per recipe. I thought this was easy enough to make and something really different to us as we don't eat tortellini often. This was a very good veggie dish and even my husband complimented it. I will be making this again.

I made this recipe due to how easy it was plus it sounded really good.  I was able to get through the first few bites but after that, I couldn't eat anymore.  I felt like all I was eating was melted cream cheese.  The taste was way too overpowering.  I couldn't even taste the cheese in the tortellinis.  Sorry I couldn't give a better review.

This is a great dish.  I used more tortellini and 1/2 the cream cheese with skim milk.  Also, added in chopped garlic with the onion and reduced fat butter.  A bit healthier version, maybe?? :)  Give it a try!

We loved it.  I think next time I will try dried tomatoes as the cherry tomatoes were a bit much but did add nice color. Excellent flavor.

Loved this...very nice.  I added some roasted red peppers as I dislike tomato, and used more milk/less cream cheese to make it lower fat (taking a plate to a friend who has had heart issues). Next time I will follow the original creamy recipe- the calories full speed ahead ;-)

I thought this dish was quite rich, and lacked a bit of flavor as written.  I'll probably make this again, but will use neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese and will add some seasoning for more flavor.

Super easy to make ~ quite delicious!  Both my husband and I enjoyed it but we  felt that it was quite filling and felt a little guilty while eating it!  Heavy on the calories!  Nice for a treat tho'.  The cherry tomatoes really added tons of flavor and color.  The highlight of this dish.  I used a whole large bag of fresh spinach instead of frozen spinach.

I'd make it again however next time I think I'd use low fat yogurt.

Mmmmm so good!  I used fresh spinach and sun dried tomato's and added fresh garlic and red pepper flakes.  I didn't have tortellini, so I used rotinni!  As per the other reviews, I used about 2/3 a block of low fat cream cheese and about 3/4 cup of milk!  We will definately be making this again soon!

This was very good; however, I should have used some modifications from the others who already reviewed this.  There is way too much cream cheese in this recipe - - next time I would use 4 oz. instead of 8 oz.  I used a bit more milk, too, to thin the sauce.  And you absolutely must add minced garlic and freshly grated nutmeg to the sauce for extra flavor.  We'll have this again, just with some changes.

I adore this recipe.  We use it basically as is with a 1/4 more milk.

I also find it a wonderful backbone recipe to use when the "cupboard is bare" last time we tossed it a couple diced portabellas and broccoli florets.

This pasta is very rich. I used Neufatchel cream cheese, which is 1/3 less fat than regular. There was a bag of fresh spinach is the fridge so I sauteed that with the onion & 3 cloves of garlic, which was suggested by another reviewer. I think that next time, I will use 1/2 the cream cheese. Cherry tomatoes are very expensive, so I chopped vine ripened ones instead. I fixed this recipes as a side dish. Maybe with less cream cheese, it could be the main course.

I thought this was pretty good. It didn't have a ton of flavor and I even added some garlic powder, salt, and pepper. I would make this again though and try to spice it up a bit more.

Somewhat bland, but still really good. Everyone kept adding salt to it at the table. I would make it again only I will add plenty of sea salt, garlic and probably use sun-dried tomatoes instead.

I really liked this recipe even though I substituted so many of the ingredients!  The sauce is what I was after and it is great!  I added chicken - cooking it first in a little bit of oil, then proceeded with the onion, etc.  I didn't have mushrooms, tomatoes, or spinach (yikes!) but I added some roasted red peppers (from the jar) and peas.  It was a big hit!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is absolutely the best dinner I have ever served!  I added some pepperoni and chicken (my husband is a big meat eater) which really livened things up.  I used alfredo sauce from this site which made the meal taste like heaven.  Will definitely be making this dish again!

Great recipe, and so many possibilities!
I will use Neufchatel cheese next time.  My husband and I loved this recipe although it was very rich.
I only had about 1/2 package of Tortellini so I bulked up other ingredients.  Used fresh spinach.
I also added:
 1 c. canned diced tomatoes with chilles, drained
 lots of mushrooms
 shrimp - 3 c. or so
 6 halved (or thirds) garlic cloves
 1/2 red pepper

This is an amazing recipe but I will reduce the neufchatel to 4 oz and low fat milk.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe a lot! I didn’t have mushrooms but it was still great without them. I used half and half because I was out of milk and it worked wonderfully. Added 4 slices of crumbled up crispy bacon which added a nice flavor and probably a lot of calories! Will definitely make this again.

This was delish! I doubled the tortellini, which I probably wouldn't do again.  I would also cut down on the spinach (and I love spinach), it was a little over-powering...IMO.  We added 2 cloves of garlic and smoked sausage.  Will make this again!

I liked this recipe a lot. After reading reviews, I made some changes to the original.
1. Exchanged neufchatel  cheese for cream cheese.
2. Exchanged cherry tomatoes for a drained can of diced tomatoes with habanero peppers (my family likes spice).
3. 9 ounces of baby bellas for the mushrooms, sliced

After that, I just followed the recipe. The habanero peppers gave it a nice spice couched in with the super creamy sauce. At just over 500 calories per serving, it's nice to eat something so creamy. It warmed up nicely too.

Good, but needed something more- garlic or bacon or some kind of seasonings. For my taste it was kind of bland.  Will probably try again with additional ingredients to make it more flavorful.

I love tortellini and I like to try new recipes so this one caught my eye. It was very tasty and my husband gave it a thumbs up. I adjusted proportions to suit our taste. I did 16 oz tortellini, 12 oz cream cheese, 1 3/4 c milk, 1 c Parmesan cheese, 1 onion, 3 garlic cloves, 2 tomatoes chopped, 1 (10 oz) package of spinach, 2 c chicken (cooked and cubed). This is a keeper!

I loved this recipe, but with some of my own ingredients added in. I used 2 packs of tortellini, 1 8ox container garden veggie cream cheese, 1 15oz container ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup milk, minced garlic, onion powder, basil, italian seasoning, and 1/2 pack of spinach.

Following the directions exactly I ended up having to add more than an additional cup of milk just to un-stick everything from the glob it formed in my pan.  Having said that, it didn't taste bad but hubby was so ambivalent about it I probably won't make it again.

Tasted good but super rich. Next time I'd use 1/4 the amount of spinage.

A few changes, bc I never just follow directions ;-)... added feta and spinach chicken sausage and garlic, eliminated the mushrooms and butter, used about 4 tbsp of low fat cream cheese and 1/2 a cup on milk. Also used fresh spinach instead of frozen. It was awesome, easy and the kids gobbled it up :-))

Very good.. I used whole wheat rotini noodles since that is what I had on hand. I also used diced tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes and I added garlic. Did everything else as the directions stated and it was very tasty. Great way to get the kids to eat their veggies!

I used this sauce with gnocchi.  i did alter it.  I sauteed the onion and garlic together and then added fresh sliced mushrooms. I removed this mixture from the pan and then sauteed the spinach and added in the sauce ingredients and eventually added the mushrooms mixture back and then added sliced cherry tomotoes.  We had this with fish and it was excellent.

This was pretty basic and tasty.  I made the sauce and just put it over regular pasta since I did not have tortellini on hand.  I made half the recipe and used garlic instead of onions and slightly less cream cheese than called for.  Fresh spinach and no tomatoes.  It had a bit of a cream cheese flavor but not overpowering.  I'd make again, I usually have these ingredients on hand.

I used tips from other reviews and I was very happy with the results. I sauted bits of chicken, onion, and four cloves of garlic in butter. Then added the parmesan cheese, chives and onion cream cheese, and mushrooms, I omitted the tomatoes, added a little salt and pepper. I had to add a ton of onion powder and garlic powder though. This one is a keeper. Next time I think I will saute the spinach as well and add more milk to create more sauce.

except I changed this a bit..... I sauteed chicken with 2 gloves of garlic in olive oil then added in the 1/2 cup of chicken broth instead of the milk and the package of spinach (which was not thawed) let that come to a simmer for a few minutes then added in half of an 8ox package of cream cheese melted that through and then added in a hand full or so of shredded Italian blend cheese let that melt then instead of cherry tomatoes I used a 2 roma italian tomatoes that I chopped and diced........YUMMMMMMMMMIO So I guess my recipe would read something like this 1 (9 ounce) package refrigerated cheese/meat tortellini 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 large gloves of fresh garlic  1-2 chicken breast chopped/diced into bite size pieces  (seasoned with italian herbs) 1 small onion, chopped 1 package of frozen spinach 1/2 cup chicken broth 4 oz of cream cheese 1/2 cup italian blend cheeses 2 diced roma tomatoes served with yummmmio garlic bread to sop up the sauce!!!

I am giving this a one only because I cannot give it a big fat 0.  Other than the waste of time, effort, money and waste of ingredients I am mostly disappointed in the reviewers who made mods and rated this so high. I did the recommended changes and still could not salvage dinner tonight. Too bad because these ingredients in severely modified measurements have the potential for something great.

Great recipe! Instead of plain cream cheese I used garlic-herb "spreadable" cheese, for additional flavor. I also added half a jar of artichoke hearts, plus pine nuts and cooked, crumbled bacon as toppings. Excellent flavors-- the leftovers will make a delicious creamy soup later this week. YUM!

I liked this recipe, but made a lot of alterations.  I cooked some chicken in olive oil and added it to the cream/veggie mixture with the tortellini.  I also used fresh spinach and sun-dried tomatoes.  I cut the cream cheese in half and used low-fat, then added extra milk to make the sauce a little thinner (I think the sauce was thicker because I used fresh spinach).  I added garlic to make up for the lost flavor.  I'll definitely make this again.

I had two servings, this recipe was so good!!! I usually don't prepare recipes that call for heavy cream but, I thought I would give this a try and the flavor was outstanding.  If only I had some French bread to soak up the sauce.  I added shrimp to this recipe which I sauteed earlier in a small amount of butter & olive oil and a dash of salt. This made it a complete meal.  Next time I will try cooked chicken breast (prepared ahead of time) Cover it with some of the sauce and accompany the chicken with the rest of the sauce and tortellini. M-M-M-M

I love this recipe! I've made it a few times and it turns out famously every time! It is a little rich so I usually have a small portion with a salad on the side. This is such an addictive dish though! I have yet to try it with a reduced fat cream cheese. That might help cut down the richness. I use a lot of onion and mushroom and garlic when I prepare it. So good!

Way too much cream cheese for us as it was overpowering.  I will try this again though with less because I think it has potential.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I used 3/4 cream cheese and skim milk and I did not think it was too rich.  I also omitted the tomatoes and mushrooms only because I don't like them.  This is a very delicious recipe and I will make again.

Very nice base recipe.  Used fresh spinach, 3/4 large onion, diced tomatoes w/ chilies, and 4oz of cream cheese after reading all the reviews.  We will definitely be adding this to the "keeper" box of recipes.  Paired nicely with a salad and bottle of sparkling wine for a quiet night in!

My husband thought this was the best dish I have ever made and requests it constantly.  For me it's a little too rich with all that cheese.

Instead of spinach we used frozen zucchini, broccoli and cauliflower. I also added a can of diced tomatoes with onions and garlic. This was truly a hearty and rich meal. We enjoyed every bite and it made great left overs!

Yum!  This recipe was easy and tasted GREAT!  Even my husband who is not really a fan of vegetarian meals had seconds!  There are no quantities listed for the tomatoes and mushrooms but I used 1 lb of each (with 1 lb of pasta) and I think those was the perfect amounts.  I also used spinach tortellini and the spinach pasta plus the spinach in the sauce was YUMMY (and not too overpowering).
Thanks so much Jen for a quick, easy and TASTY recipe!

Try it, you will love it. This give you that creamy taste you are looking for, but the fresh taste of spinach. I used fat free cream cheese and you cant tell the difference. My whole family fell in love!

I was honestly not a big fan of this recipe.  The cream cheese flavor and texture overwhelmed everything else that was going on.  I took some of the advice and added 3 cloves minced garlic and more milk.  I also added marinated artichoke hearts and didn't add spinach as I didn't have any on hand.  I'll give it 3 stars because my boyfriend liked it, but I won't be making this again.

Beware..this will make your stomach hurt! It is soo rich. I only used half a package of cream cheese too. My husband barely touched it and my stomach hurt all night. But the flavor is delicious! Probably won't make again though :(

I just made this recipe and really liked it. The only changes I made were that I did not add spinach because I didn't have any on hand. Also, based on prior reviews saying it was a little bland, I added a little garlic salt. It was good with the garlic salt but I think it would have been fine without too!

This was good, not great. The spinach took over so you couldn't taste much else.  I did add quite a bit of garlic, more milk, and extra parm. cheese. I'll probably make again but cut the spinach in half.

This was good!  I had some wonderful fresh spinach to use up and this was a great way to do it-sauteed it with the onion at the beginning.  I used a family size package of tortellini, added more milk, and only used 1/2 package of cream cheese.  It was plenty rich!  The tomatoes did cut the richness a bit.  I didn't add mushrooms-didn't have any.  We enjoyed it and it was really fast and easy!

I can't give it the full five stars because I made a couple of changes as other cooks suggested.  I omitted the tomatoes, and added two pressed fresh cloves of garlic.  I also found that I had to add quite a bit of salt.  With those changes, it is GREAT!!!  A definite five star.  Yum!!!

I made this recipe tonight and it is amazing! I added some additional ingredients as well (never hurts to experiement). Instead of cream cheese I did a 1/2 cup of sour cream, chopped up some basil and for a kick some hot italian turkey sausage (which surprisingly worked out well).

My husband and I love this recipe.  I have made it several times and it gets better each time.  We like extra spinach and onions and a little less cream cheese.  Super easy recipe with a great taste.

My husband REALLY liked this.  I thought it was good.  I did 3/4 c. milk and a little less than a full pkg of 1/3 fat cr. cheese.  I also used diced tomatoes and thought they were a yummy addition, though I'd been skeptical.  This dish REQUIRES garlic - don't forget it when you saute the onions!  I also sauted the mushrooms and some green pepper with the onions and garlic.  Very nice.

Delicious. One of my favourite recipes so far.  Used roma tomates instead of cherry tomatoes and they worked fine.  Actually the recipe would be way too creamy without the tomatoes.  They were a perfect addition to this recipe.  Thanks a lot!

Yummy! I didn't have mushrooms, so I eliminated them and instead of cherry tomatoes, I added a can of petite diced tomatoes (drained). It kind of tasted like warm spinach dip on top of pasta!

I made this with I Can's Believe It's Not Butter, skim milk, and low fat cream cheese, and I also added fresh garlic.  It was delicious! I intentionally made leftovers, but my fiance ate them all in one sitting.  I will definitely be making this again!

This is sooooooo good! The only thing I did differently was throw 2 cloves of garlic in to cook with the onion & used about 2 cups fresh spinich instead of frozen. I substituted low-fat cream cheese and only used about 2/3 of a bar. Perfecto!

I used fat free cream cheese to reduce the fat and it still tasted yummy.  To save a little on cost, I bought the dried tortellini in bulk.  Great recipe!

This recipe was a hit for my entire family, inlcuding 3 kids under four!  A great way to sneak spinach in without that "spinachy" taste.  When I sauteed the onion, I used 1T butter with 1T olive oil.  I also added 1 clove of garlic (minced) to the onions as they cooked for extra flavor.  I did find that I needed to add considerably more than 1/2c. of milk to the sauce- more like almost 3/4 c. to keep the sauce from becoming too "pasty".  Would definitely make again though!!

this was really good. i added cubed egg plant to the onions and garlic and a little italian seasoning. i didn't have any cream cheese (except strawberry!) so i substituted some sour cream and cottage cheese. this turned out really well, though it was a little runny because i forgot to drain the spinach! i omitted the mushrooms because they are yucky!

Very bland. If you decide to make it please add additional spices such as garlic salt, onion powder, italian seasoning, etc. Turned out all right but definitely not worth the calories.

This was a simple and tasty recipe to put together!  I used no-fat cream cheese, fresh spinach, and dried tortellini.  I also didn't have any cherry tomatoes so added some canned (drained) tomatoes.  I didn't think the tomato flavor went well with the rest of the recipe, though this could be because of my substitution.  The color of the finished dish was a bit off-putting; I think because I used canned tomatoes.  Everything looked kind of yellow.  It looked very bland, even with the green spinach, but it tastes delicious!  Husband and I were fighting over leftovers the next day!  Will definitely make this again!!

I happened to try this recipe one night and had unexpected company.  I was worried at first but everyone really liked it.  We put it over ravioli but I also made it with the tortellini.  I didn't use the cherry tomatos.  I used a can of diced and just drained the liquid.  I thought it came out great and so did everyone else.

I followed the recipe exactly, but found the sauce to be way too overpowering. The flavor was great, just too much sauce on too little tortellini.  I'll try it one more time, cutting the sauce recipe in half and see how that goes.

Not bad at all, followed the recipe exactly except omitted the onions because I'm not a fan of them. Simple and pretty good recipe, thanks. :)

This is very rich, thick, and heavy.  It was quite good, but more for a crisp fall dinner than a bright spring dinner.

I used 1 cup of non-fat yogurt in place of the cream cheese.  The recipe did not specify how much tomatoes to use, so I just chopped up about 1/2 cup of roma tomatoes.  I also threw in a small can of sliced olives.  I have tried this recipe with both fresh refridgerated tortellini and dried tortellini, both with great results.

I made this dinner for my husband and he Loved it!  I also added garlic, as suggested, and I substituted a 1/2 bag of fresh spinach (steamed) for the frozen. I will definately make this again.

This recipe was fabulous.  I add a little garlic to the onion mixture and more milk to thin the sauce a little.

Oh wow, this is like eating Spinach & Artichoke dip over pasta.  Not too great for the heart!  It was tasty though.  I used ravioli as we don't like tortellini.
