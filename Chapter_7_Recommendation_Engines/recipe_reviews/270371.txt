This was a huge hit!  We used real whipped cream (just whipped heavy cream until thick and creamy) instead of  the frozen whipped topping, and gluten-free chocolate sandwich cookies.  We had guests over and they had the recipe by the next morning.  Yum!

This was really delicious and my family liked it. The only change: I used full fat cream cheese in the cheesecake and full fat topping. (Could not get fat-free frozen topping)

Super yummy! I’ve made it a couple of times and I’ve used more banana, maybe double, because I mashed too much. Both times, I also  only used one box of pudding and half the milk to make up for it and everyone thought it was plenty. I also make my own whipped cream. Already a part of my favorites, thank you!!

Fantastic! I made it with a graham cracker crust instead of the Oreo cookie crust and it was amazing!

This turned out marvelous with a few adjustments I made. First, I tripled the butter in the crust. Since I only had a 10 inch springform pan, this might’ve had something to do with it.  Then, I added about 1/8 cup of corn starch when I whipped the cream cheese to give it a lighter texture. I got this from the Junior’s Cheesecake recipe from New York. I also added about a teaspoon of banana extract to the cheesecake mixture as well. Next time I make this, I’ll probably use something like vanilla wafers for the crust. The chocolate was nice. But, I think the vanilla would make it lighter and more elegant. I also froze the completed cake for the first hour after adding the topping to help is set a little faster. It’s delicious! And, it’s held up really well for a couple days after, too.

Great recipe!  I used chocolate filled Oreos for the crust and sprinkled choc shavings on top to give it some color.  My husband loved it!

This looks amazing. I haven't made it yet but I wonder if you could just use the pudding and heavy cream to make that topping instead of the milk and whipped topping. Just a thought I haven't tried it yet but I once made a macaron filling with just those two and it was amazing.

Amazing! My personal preference I think would be to cut the pudding content in the topping down by half and make it more of a whipped cream topping. But this is truly a delicious recipe and played to rave reviews in my house.

It is delicious. I think I'll add some mashed banana in the cream next time.
