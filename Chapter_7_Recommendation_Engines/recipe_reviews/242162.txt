I made this the first time exactly as instructed and found it moist but dense (butter/margarine was not creamed into sugar or mixture ).  I made it the second time creaming the sugar and butter/marg first, then adding one egg at a time and mixing well between eggs,  then adding the mango pulp with  one mashed mango and a few dashes of cinnamon (because I had a mango on hand) added to pulp to equal  1 and 3/4 cup and adding the flour ingredients (sifted well together)  last until just combined which is normally how a cake or loaf is done and found it to be far superior than the first instruction on this site.  Now it has a four star rating and with cinnamon whipped cream (ice cream or frozen yogurt) it was five stars.  I also want to try this again with a mango sauce of some sort to enhance the mango flavor and a bit of almond flavoring in batter to enhance the almonds on top.

08-03-16 A nice cake that we liked but our neighbors loved it. It is moist with a light flavor. I couldn't find canned sweetened mango pulp so I made my own. (3 mangos 2 TB powered sugar 1/4 cup milk - put all in blender until smooth). The sauce was incredible. Before serving we poured the leftover sauce over the cake. The cake did go to an all new level of taste appeal.

I made this as instructed it was quite good not fluffy but very moist as most fruit based cakes are. flavor was very good my wife really liked it... I used a fresh mango instead of the juices. added a honey glaze to top it off. I will continue to make this as my wife is a very big mango fan!!!!
