It is dry, but it's biscotti.  Dip it in coffee.  In order to increase the flavor, I roasted chopped nuts (pecans and almonds because that's what I had) and put them in instead of ground nuts.  It was very flavorful and delicious.

These cookies are supposed to be dry...they are an Italian cookie meant for dipping in coffee.  I love biscotti and am looking forward to trying this recipe.

These are actually absolutely delicious biscotti - I LOVE the addition of whole wheat flour, it gives this a really unique and very rich taste. I did use a mixture of walnuts and pecans, as I didn't have hazelnuts. Made these two times in the last 10 days already! :)

I made these with 1/2 c. whole wheat and 1 cup all purpose flour. They turned out delicious. They are very dry and flaky, just the way delicious biscotti should taste.

Not my favorite Biscotti recipe. From reading the reviews that they were bland, I added dried cranberries and pistachios. Still great with coffee or tea. I may have cut mine too big but I only got almost two dozen out of this recipe.

Followed to a T. The batter was nice and formed into logs quite easily, however, not that flavorful for a biscotti cookie, rather bland and didn't have that sweetness either.  Sorry I won't be making again.
