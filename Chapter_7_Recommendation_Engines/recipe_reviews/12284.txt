I am somewhat of a fussy pie baker and I loved this recipe! The only things I did differently were that I used 5 pints of large berries, I also brushed the bottom crust with a little beaten egg, squeezed a little lemon juice over the berries and dotted with butter before putting the top crust on. I brushed the top crust with some of the beaten egg and sprinkled sugar over it. It was delicious and I agree, serve this with a little vanilla ice-cream. I've made this pie about 5 times this summer and received rave reviews each time. One more tip ~ make sure that you combine the berries with the sugar and flour well until you no longer see any "white" coating on the berries.

I've made this recipe a total of three times in the past month (can you tell I liked it?).  Each time I tried a slightly different variation.  The recipe as stated tastes great.  However, I recommend brushing part of an egg on the bottom of the pie shell before adding the berries so that the bottom will not become soggy.  Instead of using all-purpose flour, I tried tapioca flour once.  It turned out a thicker and bit sweeter berry filling than the straight flour.  I liked it.  Another thing I did was to add a tablespoon or two of cold butter chopped up and sprinkled over the berries. If you like a buttery flavor, this is definitely the way to go.  All three times I used a butter pie crust.

If you have the option between frozen and fresh blackberries, I highly recommend the fresh.  I tried both.  The fresh were much tastier.

When it came down to it... each variation tasted great and I highly recommend this recipe. It is resilient to modifications and very tasty.

Very good. I added more berries, and it still fit well into the pie dish. Next time I would squeeze a tablespoon or so of lemon juice on top for a needed brightness. I used 1/4 cup tapioca in lieu of the flour. I did brush some beaten egg onto the bottom crust to keep it from becoming soggy.

Perfect pie!!!  We just had this after dinner tonight.  We picked the blackberries from the fence line running down the driveway.  I followed the recipe exactly (but I used store bought frozen pie crusts) and it was absolutely delicious.  First fruit pie I ever made and it was perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe that made me feel good about myself!  It's so cool to use ingredients from your yard to feed your family!  The crust was perfect thanks to the great temp/time directions!  Will use this every season!...Vanilla ice cream is the topper (literally)!

This is delicious!  I used a bag of frozen blackberries and increased the bake time to 30 minutes.  I would recommend only brushing the pie with one tablespoon of milk before sprinkling the sugar, as two made the top a little watery-still delicious though!

Wonderful pie.  My sister-in-law, THE pie maker in the family, raved and asked me for the recipe.  I used the Pie Crust recipe submitted by Brenda for the crust.  To keep the cost down, I used half fresh berries and half frozen.  The pie sliced beautifully and didn't ooze one bit.  I recommend serving it warm with a scoop of ice cream, as Michelle states.  GREAT!

I've made this as written as well as with recommendations from reviews. The additions make this a stellar dessert. I can't imagine why anyone would want 1/4 cup sugar on top of their pie and saturate it with 2 whole tablespoons of milk. One tablespoon milk is enough, and and 1-2 tsps of sugar is really all you need on top. The pie was runny with flour, so I replaced the flour with 1/4 cup of instant, granulated tapioca. Once it cooled completely, the pie didn't run at all. Squeeze half a lemon over the berries and sprinkle 2 tablespoons of chopped butter over them as well before topping off the pie with the second crust. Brushing the bottom with egg saves the pie from getting soggy on the bottom. Absolutely amazing on a hot summer day with French Vanilla ice cream!

This pie was good - I used frozen blackberries and that could be why it was not as good as I excpected.  My pie was too stiff - so next time I will use less flour or substitute tapioca.  Also I will add more sugar next time - maybe 3/4 cup instead of just 1/2.

I may also take one of the other reviewer's advice and add a little lemon juice.  Overall a good basic recipe you can work with.

So Yummy!!  I have never made a pie before and this was so good.  It held it's shape and wasn't runny.  One thing I did  wrong was didn't let it cool quite enough before cutting which made it run on the initial cut.  But after it cooled, it was perfect.  Tastes awesome with Vanilla ice cream.

After making this pie for the first time last week, my friends have been calling me and asking if I've made another (which I did :)).  I have a deep pie dish, so I added 2 cups of blueberries for a "black-n-blueberry pie."  It doesn't seem too 'oozie', and it's really delicious!

I have run two bakeries and while the recipe is pretty simplistic (needs a bit more sugar) and good, the baking time is way off.  I knew reading it, I would have to adjust it by at least 20 to 30 minutes longer to have the filling come to a boil and thicken.  Anything less and you're going to be serving warm blackberry soup.

Yum! This pie is divine. A perfect way to use up all those blackberries in the garden. I usually use blackberries that aren't sweet enough to eat plain, and increase the amount of sugar in the pie. I also find the juice of half a lemon really wakes it up, and some egg wash brushed on the bottom crust keeps it from turning soggy. Dots of butter beneath the top layer of crust don't hurt either! While frozen berries work fine, I really prefer the taste of fresh ones. This basic recipe holds up well to personal tweaks. Sometimes I like to add orange or lime zest and a squeeze of juice to the filling. Occasionally I make this pie with mixed berries (strawberries, raspberries, blueberries...) and it always turns out splendidly.

We love this pie!!! I followed one of the other reviews and used 6 cups blackberries (5 with 3/4 cup sugar and 1/2 cup flour and then one cup on top) topped berries with pats of butter.  I used an egg wash on bottom crust and top crust with sugar.  The reason I increased everything is because I used large 9 inch deep dish pie plate and it was perfect!!  Thanks

Hands down the best blackberry pie!! I've made this three times and each time I get loads of compliments. Many people have said it's the best pie they've ever had. I do make my own crust for this pie.

A great pie recipe!  If you have never made a blackberry pie before and are looking for the perfect recipe to try use this one! My husband LOVED it, he told me I had better not change a thing!  When you stir the flour and sugar with the berries make sure you stir until it is no longer white, lightly "smosh" the berries with your spoon if you have to.  I used fresh berries and just enough milk on the crust to lightly dampen it and then just sprinkled it with about 1 tablespoon of sugar.  Follow the recipe and you won't be sorry.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

This is about the 4th time I've baked this pie & it's always a hot. The 1st time I followed the exact directions and it came out good. Since then, I brush the bottom crust with an egg white wash, pat some butter on top of the berries, and do another egg white wash on the top crust. Delicious! I find that 5 containers of 6oz. blackberries works best. I also tend to have to bake it longer for the second part. I think it's because I use a metal pan underneath my pie dish and it might take longer to bake. Use a GLASS pie dish, you will be able to check the bottom of the pie to make sure it's perfectly baked! I just keep checking it until it's done and I usually have to place foil over the top so it doesn't burn. Happy Baking! :)

This was my first time making a pie and it could not have been any easier! I added fresh lemon juice before placing the top pie crust on and it added great flavor. Served with vanilla ice cream ... Yum!

Wow, wow, wow!  I'm not a huge fan of blackberries, but we have a ton of them in our back yard this year, and my son and his friends love to pick them.  I tried the blackberry IV recipe twice, with disappointing results.  I decided to try this one instead, and it's GREAT.  Not soupy, and the flavor was velvety, sweet, and just yummy.  I used Pillsbury pie crusts, and I loved the bottom crust being extra tender and juicy, and the crispy upper crust.  I did use foil around the edges of the pie so the crust didn't burn, and I mixed ALL the berries with the flour (oh, and I used 1/4 c. flour and 1/4 c.quick tapioca).  Baked as directed--one yummy pie!

Big disappointment.  This pie was NOT sweet at all!!  For a while I thought I put a wrong amount of sugar... but I didn't.  I don't like overly sweet pie but this pie wasn't even sweet enough.  I honestly think 1/2 cup of sugar (even though extra to put on the top of the crust) is not enough.  I used frozen berries but I don't think that was a reason..

This recipe is AMAZING!I followed exactly what the recipe said, and it turned out perfect, like a Marie Calander pie. I used egg wipe on the bottom (just wipe some whisked egg with a paper towel over the shell), and there was absolutely no soggy shells. This recipe is the most easy, yet versatile pie ever, very healthy, yet still sweet and tangy. This is perfect for our ripe and wild blackberries in our yard. Thanks- LucyJeane.

This pie is really good when I baked it for Thanksgiving. I made it lattice-topped and I loved the texture it had when it was cool. However, I will warn you that my lattice cracked a bit after cooling, so appearance-wise, be careful if using lattice. Plus, I read some reviews that complained about lack of flavor. I made mine with wild blackberries, and fearing that it would be slightly bitter or flavorless, I added blueberries and just a tad more sugar. The taste was spectacular. Thank you so much for your recipe.

I love blackberries and this was  fabulous.  I rinsed the berries, shook   the water off and tossed them in flour.  Used Splenda (am diabetic) and basted the  top w/SmartBalance and more Splenda.  Threw out my arm patting myself on back.  Many thanks for a wonderful recipe,  Michelle Verdiere .

Very good - I will use this again. I rated it 4 stars because it definitely needed an extra 15 minutes than the recipe stated. I'll also cut down on the flour by just a bit and add a tad more sugar next time.

I'm not a pie maker, this was my second one ever. I made my own crust and blackberries we grew that I had in the freezer. The pie was great! I used egg wash on the crust and the sugar on top. My kids liked it so much they want me to make it again for them for their birthdays. This will be my go to recipe for berry pie from now on.

Very good, basic, straight-forward pie recipe.  I used 5 1/2 cups of frozen berries, thawed.  I still wanted to increase it.  But it tasted good and was lovely.  Thanks Michelle!

I altered the recipe as another reviewer suggested. I used about 5 cups of blackberries, substituted 1/4 c. tapioca for the flour, added a Tbs. of fresh lemon juice and baked it until the filling bubbled and the crust was golden. This is the first time I have ever made blackberry pie without using canned filling. I will add this to my recipe book for sure.

I made this today, & while it wasn't exactly how I usually make blackberry pie, it came out beautifully. I added about another half cup of sugar. I know blackberries take a lot of sugar. Think it could have stood more. I posted 2 pictures also. Thanks you!

Excellent pie! Like others I upped berries to 6 cups and still fit well in pie shell. I also lightly floured both sides of the bottom crust and did egg wash on inside bottom and on top crust.

this pie is delicious, the only thing i did different was instead of milk on the crust, i used carnation vanilla creamer and just sprinkled sugar over.

Simple and delicious.  Made with a blueberry /blackberry filling.  As others suggested I brushed the bottom crust with egg to prevent any sogginess. My blackberries were a little tart, I could have used a bit more sugar, but everyone was really pleased with this pie and it disappeared quickly.

This turned out so well, everybody loved it! I took the advice in other reviews and put egg wash on the bottom and top crust, poured a small amount of lemon juice on the berries, and put a few pats of butter on the berries before putting on the top crust. Wonderful with vanilla ice cream!

This was awesome!  First fruit pie I have ever made.  My husband loves pie and is picky about it (which is one reason I never attempted one) and he says it is one of the best pies he has ever eaten.  I used fresh berries (nearly 6 cups and it wasn't a deep dish) and the generic brand of refrigerated pie crust.   The only change I made was to sprinkle some lemon juice over the berry filling.  In my opinion it was a bit tart (probably because I used more berries) and so I might add 1/4 c. more sugar next time but my husband thought the sweetness was perfect.  The consistency was perfect.  I cooked it for 28 minutes after I turned the temp down to 375.  I could have cooked it for 30 and it would have been fine.  Again, I think because of the extra berries.  DELICIOUS and so simple!  *For those who thought it was pasty--you have to mix the berries with the flour and sugar until you see no white and it is all sticking to the berries.

We have made this about three times so far and it's turned out excellent every time. My husband was a little skeptical of putting flour in it at first, but he got over that once he saw how it came out and how delicious it was. I can't wait until blackberry's are in season again so we can make this!

This pie is great I have been making it for a couple of years now, I sometimes mix raspberries in with it and have also subsituted Splenda with the sugar and it still tastes just as good.

Being from Australia, I always get my pie recipes off the internet because you Americans sure know how to make good pie.  But this one wasn't nearly as good as other berry pies I have had.  The texture was very floury and had an overwhelming 'thickened taste'.  I also used 1/4 cornflour and 1/4 cup plain flour in place of 1/2 cup plain flour which wouldn't have helped and I had to add in 1 cup cooked apple to fill my pie case - not quite as successful for my 4th of July celebrations as I would have liked.  Although served with thickened sweet fresh cream and it makes things taste a whole lot better!!

Very delicious yet simple recipe for blackberry pie. The blackberry seeds were a little crunchy; not sure what can be done about this unless the blackberries, flour, and sugar are cooked a little beforehand on the stove to soften them up some.

This pie tasted really good, however, I wish the recipe said something in it about blending in the sugar and flour until you can't see it, or perhaps smashing a few of the berries to absorb some of the flour/sugar.  My pie came out with a few spots of flour showing.  It tasted delicious though, so it wasn't a huge problem.

I am 16 and this was my first pie. It turned out great! I used frozen berries and like someone else said, increased the time to thirty minutes. I also added two teaspoons of lemon juice and a little extra sugar. It turned out wonderfully. I love this recipe.

I made this pie twice with frsh picked blackberries. I made the crust homemade from a recipe froma different site.The first time I used fresh frozen blackberries and did not use all the blackberrie liquid once they thawed.I was in the beggining good but after I found it a little gummy. Second time I used the blackberries fresh was a little runny at first but a day to set and it was perfect.Especially great with vanilla ice cream. Yum!

I got rave reviews on this one.  My only suggestions would be to use just enough milk to brush the top--2 tablespoons is too much, as well as just enough sugar to dust the top--1/4 cup is too much.  Otherwise, absolutely delicious.  I used fresh berries from our backyard (added a bit more than the recipe calls for).

Great recipe.  I did a few modifications like one of the other reviewers.  I added a little lemon juice and a few small pats of butter to the berries before top crust. Brushed bottom crust and top crust with beaten egg.  Baked up beautifully and tastes wonderful.  Very good quick recipe.

Made this recipe for the first time the other day using the Pie Crust IV recipe from this site.  It was wonderful.  The pie came out perfect.  I added a little cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg to the filling and dotted a couple tablespoons of butter over the filling before putting on the top crust, but other than that followed the recipe as written.  Thanks for a simple and delicious blackberry pie.

This pie was the best pie I have ever eaten!! I was very bored one day and I looked for blackberry pie recipes on the internet. I was immediately inspired by this recipe, which was quite easy to make. I instead of doing a plain crust did a lattice crust that made it look even more gorgeous. The crust came out very flaky and crisp which I loved, and the berries were perfect. I plan on making this recipe for Christmas dessert. The only thing I'll do differently is probably put a bit more sugar. I will hand whip whipping cream as a topping. This pie is divine and so easy! I completely recommend it!! I'm only 11 and I finished it very quickly!!

 Sincerily,
 Shannon G.

Blackberry pie is my all time favorite, and I used to rely on others to make it for me.  I tried this and now I can satisfy my craving any time I want!  I did as others suggested and sprinkled a little bit of lemon juice over the berries, dotted with butter and brushed the crust with egg white/sprinkled with sugar.  It is delicious...in fact, I think it's time to make it again!

This was such a great recipe.  I wanted to make a pie, but did not want to go to the store so I used frozen berries I had.  The pie was a mix of blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries.  It was a little "seedy" but still tasted wonderful.  I loved the consistency and everything.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Very good recipe. I took some tips from other reviewers and did 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 c tapioca and doubled the berries and added just a little extra sugar. 
Then I did the egg wash for the top crust and 2 Tbsp sugar. Came out perfect!!

This is wonderful. I had to double the berries to fill my 9" pie plate and I did use half flour and half tapioca and the consistancy was PERFECT!! Not runny at all. I did use the milk on the crust but only about 2 teaspoons not tablespoons. Sprinkled with sugar and a little cinnamon and the cinnamon was a great compliment to the berries. I just loved it.

This recipe was very simple, but too tart for my taste -- needed more sugar.

Very fast and easy.  I used two 16 oz packages of frozen berries and added 1&1/2 Tablespoons of Tapocia to thicken.  It turned out great, no running when the pie was cut.

Had a lot of fun baking this pie with my 9yr old. Recipe is very easy to follow with a delicious result! We used fresh berries that we picked at a local farm, only modification was using gluten free flour which helped to lighten the flavour and consistency of the filling. Will definitely make again!

I don't like a a lot of crust with my pies. So I made this pie and didn't put a top crust on it. The pie wasn't runny and stuck together quite well.

I did not care for this recipe. I dont know what went wrong. My berries may have been a little tart. I did follow others suggestions to brush a little beaten egg on bottom crust to keep from getting soggy, mixed the berries with the sugar and flour till completely mixed, dotted with butter, brushed little egg on top and sprinkled with sugar. The filling was thick like paste. My husband tried to eat a piece he said it had a metallic taste, I used a glass pan. A shame cause it looked beautiful. Oh and I used store bought pillsbury premade rolled dough, so I know That wasnt it.

Nice tasting pie. Paired this with "Flaky Food Processor Pie Crust" from this site and wow'ed friends at game night. Follower the recipe pretty close. I just sugared all the berries in one bowl with the flour and used an egg wash instead of the milk. I also only used about a tablespoon of sugar on top. One other thing I did, was to add a little lemon juice to the frozen berries to brighten up the flavor a bit. Nice to cut a piece of berry pie and not have all the filling run out into the pan.

Easy recipe.  I added lemon juice and lemon zest for an extra kick.  My lattice top didn't do well with the milk wash and it bubbled up over the crust too much.  But still tasted amazing!

This pie is very simple, but I am not all that impressed. I think that the ratios could be adjusted, there seems to be too much flour. I live high in the mountains so I cooked the pie for almost 35 minutes at 375, but I still ended up with lumps of uncooked, gooey flour lumps in the middle of the pie. I read the previous reviews and increased the blackberries 1/2 again, and all other ingredients as well. Also, I added a scant tablespoon of lemon juice. This addition was perfect for a 9" pie and filled it well. If I had only used the 4 cups it would have been too small. Next time I will use less flour and cook longer - maybe at 350 for 40 minutes. Or I will just try a cornstarch recipe. Oh well, it doesn't taste too bad.

This pie was AMAZING. I've been looking for a good black and blue berry pie, but couldn't find one. So, I followed all of the directions except I used equal parts frozen blueberries and blackberries.  This pie turned out perfect!!! Everyone loved it, even people who claim that they do not like black/blue berries. HIGHLY recommended!!!!

I chose this recipe based on the great reviews. I made the pie following the instructions and the end result was a pie that was way, way too tart. Next time I'll add at least another 1/2 cup of sugar.

My first pie ever, absolutely delicious!! Added an extra layer of blackberries because 4 cups didn't seem like enough, with light sugaring on top of that layer. Pie turned out wonderfully, perfect tart:sweet ratio. My only qualm was I had to bake it for a long time, and even after I took the pie out, the crust on the bottom seemed undercooked. Pie was a bit soupy; next time, I'll throw in some tapioca.

This pie came out very good.  Not at all runny as some people had suggested.  My one complaint however was that after being cooked some of the flower mixture had not completely absorbed and was still visible.  I used closer to 1/4 cup sugar than 1/2 cup sugar.  I think 1/2 cup would have made it too sweet, but I don't like my pies very sweet.

When I defrosted the berries, I strained half the juice to prevent things from getting too juicy, turns out the pie needed it! Was slightly gummy from too much flour, but I think if I do this with regular fresh berries this would be great. Everyone loved it. Used with French pie crust from this site.

This pie was delicous and perfect! i really want a pie recipe that called for flour instead of cornstarch, i dont know why, i just really dislike the taste and consistancy of cornstarch. The only thing i changed is i used half blackberries and half raspberries, i had to use frozen because where i live, there is no blackberries and a little tiny half a pint is almost $6, so i used frozen for both. I added and extra 1/4 cup of sugar because of the tartness in frozen berries and an extra 2 tablespoons of flour because of the added liquid in frozen berries, and it was perfect. I used Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust, from this website and it turned out delisious. I also egg washed the crust and sprinkled with sugar to give it a beautifull golden color. Definately a keeper!!! thanks a lot!

Awesome! I made this pie for the first time lastnight and it was the best recipe I have found by far! I did take the advice of the others and brush the egg on the bottom crust and it worked! I used fresh berries from my uncle's blackberry bushes, but I'm sure this winter I will try it with the frozen berrys we froze yesterday. I have tried 3 other recipes before and all were a disaster. They either were too sour, sweet or runny. This was PERFECT, it had good texture and was prefect on flavor not to sour or sweet. I did also add a couple small dabs of butter on top also. The pie got rav reviews from my daughter and grandmother. Coming from my grandmother was huge. If she loves it, it has to be great! I now have found the perfect recipe for my husbands favorite pie! Thanks!

Ok, I didn't use blackberries, but I did use this recipe for boysenberries and olallieberries.  I increased the berries to 5 cups (3 cups olallie and 2 cups boysenberries) because I needed to use the berries I picked that morning otherwise they'd go bad.  I kept all the other filling measurements the same.  I used store bought pie crust (I had it on hand) and brushed a beaten egg on the bottom layer as suggested by another reviewer.  Aslo, I decreased the amount of sugar on top of the crust.  It just didn't need that much.  The pie is absoltely wonderful.  The filling is nice and solid rather than running everywhere, not too sweet, and the crust came out perfect.  My husband said to keep this recipe and just try it with other berries as they come in season.  Four thumbs up from us!

My husband and I don't usually like berry pies, but my pregnancy seems to have brought on some cravings so I decided to try this recipe.  It was great!!  After reading the reviews, I decided to add 3/4 cup of sugar to the berries since there were a lot of comments about it being a bit tart, and I omitted the milk and sugar topping step due to the comments about the crust being soggy. I made this pie in mid-January so I was only able to find a small package of fresh blackberries at the gourmet grocery store, and so I used 3 cups frozen Dole brand blackberries and 1 cup fresh. (We actually found that the frozen ones cooked to a nicer texture than the fresh).  I used my own crust recipe, and tented the pie for the first 15 minutes- which I don't think I needed to do since I ended up having to bake it for about 10 minutes longer to brown it in the end.  Anyhow, it does slice beautifully-no oozing (which even the best apple pies tend to do) and we loved it with the vanilla ice cream.

This was amazing! I added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips that was in another recipe since I could not decide which one to try.  The combo of flavors was unusual & very good.  This is not a "runny" fruit pie, very dense. Actually once it had totally cooled you could cut the pie slice, then pick up & eat it like you would a bar cookie or brownie!
Thanks

Very simple and tasty.  I ended up with a lot of juice but this could be because I used frozen blackberries. Will try again when I pick some more fresh ones!

We picked berries and I made the pie that night.  It was perfect. I cut down on the sugar on top of the crust but followed the rest exactly.  It was WONDERFUL!!!

MY HUSBAND ASKED ME TO MAKE A PIE LIKE HIS MOTHER USED TO MAKE.  WITH THE OTHER REVIEWS IN MIND I USED 7 CUPS BLACKBERRIES, 1/4 CUP FLOUR AND 3 T TAPIOCA ALONG WITH THE SUGAR CALLED FOR.  IT WAS DELICIOUS!  I PASSED!!!!

I used fresh blackberries & raspberries when making this. I, like some others, added 1/4 cup tapioca, and less flour, and more sugar. The taste is heavenly. Make this with The Butter Flaky Pie Crust found on this website.

Very easy and yummy with fresh blackberries picked from grandpa's farm. Next time will cut back on flour to 1/4 cup.  I also took advice of other reviewers and cut some butter onto pie before adding top crust.  I sprinkled only a 1/4 cup of sugar onto crust, but I mixed in cinnamon with it.  Everyone loved it and it goes excellent w/vanilla ice cream.  Will make again!

This recipe was absolutely WONDERFUL!  I used the Baker's Secret pie crust recipe (which is the best pie crust i have ever tasted) and instead of the half cup of flour for the pie filling used 1/4 cup tapioca.  I also brushed the bottom crust with egg to prevent it from becoming soggy.  Instead of brushing the top crust with milk i used the left over egg and sprinkled it with sugar! It was so beautiful but even more tasty! Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great recipe!  We just moved to Orcas Island in the San Juans this summer and I wasn't sure what to do with all the blackberries my kids kept bringing home....so we ate a lot of pies!  They also went to the school bake sale and were a hit, even though people have been making Blackberry Pie forever here!  Thanks, I felt like an "Islander"!!!

Fantastic!  I followed others' advice here and applied egg to the bottom crust.  I also brushed egg on top with a sprinkle of sugar.  My friends loved this so much that we used store-bought crusts and made pies all day, when blackberries were fresh and inexpensive.

Very good! I am not usually very fond of berry pies, but I liked this. Made with berries we picked near our house. I made one, had a piece, and sent the rest of the pie to work with my husband. It got rave reviews. I liked it so much, I made another one the same day! I did reduce the amount of milk brushed on top, to about half of what the recipe called for (the first one I made was too moist on top). I used the Oil Pie Crust recipe submitted by Donna. Thanks!

This recipe needed a little more sugar, but other than that, it was excellent!  My 88-year-old grandma hadn't had a blackberry pie in years and she said it brought back wonderful memories of her mother making blackberry pies.

I loved this pie, although good black berries are key.  I made it a lattice top, which was absolutly beautiful.  I found it needed to be cooked for the full 25 min. with the lattice top.  Also, if you add razberrys (which was also yummy) increase the ammount of sugar and four so it isn't runny.

Pretty Good.   I made this pie and was a bit concerned with the amount of flour used and the lack of additional flavorings, but I did it as directed, given the flurry of positive  feedback on it (also, no one wants to be that jerk who claims the recipes sucks because they substituted avocado for flour!).

It worked, to be sure, but I felt like the amount of flour was excessive and yielded a bit of a chalky/grainy texture.  I also thought it was a tad sweet.

On the second try, I used 1/4 cup cornstarch, a tsp of nutmeg, and a tablespoon of vanilla.  I did not reduce the sugar, but did add a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice.  I covered the crust with sanding sugar to add extra crunch.  Divine, and the texture of the filling was more jam-like and ink-colored, and less grainy.

Also, I recommend baking the pie for as long as you possibly can without burning the crust.  The secret to almost any fruit pie is the baking time, and most pies die of sogginess before their time, because they are not baked long enough.

Worked perfectly. I've tried it with cinnamon and different mixing methods (gently mixing berries with the sugar and flour, or mashing it into more of a liquid). The cinnamon is a good addition, but I'd recommend gently mixing the berries and to avoid mashing them up as much as possible.

This recipe was great. I used frozen berries that I froze from my garden and thawed. I used the sugar and flour the recipe called for. Per other reviewers suggestions, I  brushed beaten egg on the bottom crust.  I also brushed the top crust with beaten egg prior to sprinkling it with sugar. I did not use the  full 1/4 cup of sugar on top. This recipe is easy and delicious.

I doubled the recipe and made a large cobbler.  My only changes were a squeezed lemon on top of the berries.  I love the fact that it held its' shape when cut.  Fruit pies that are too soupy do NOT please me. I used 2 one pound bags of frozen blackberries.

Followed suggestions of others - beaten egg on bottom, some lemon juice, dots of butter but made a crumb crust for the top- 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar & 1/4 cup butter. Rave reviews all around!

Very easy to make! I actually just used store bought premade crusts from the frozen food aisle, and it still tasted wonderful!  Make sure to top with vanilla ice cream!  But a great way to use up those berries you find in the summer!  My husband was very impressed!  :)

Great recipe!  Changes I made:  I substituted a little cornstarch for the flour.   Changes I would probably make in the future:  add a little more sugar.  The flavor was awesome.  A smidgen tart but not really.  My kids thought it would be better with a touch more sugar though.  I used fresh picked berries and drained very well so no problems with a soupy pie.  I also used egg white on the bottom crust.  Overall a good recipe to use again.  Loved it!

An awesome recipe! My husband and I loved this pie. We brushed the bottom crust with eggs as others suggested and added butter on top of the berrries and skipped the milk all together. I think next time I'll had a smidge more sugar, but other wise really great!

I've made this several times -- it ALWAYS works well!  I use fresh blackberries, and usually add an extra 1/2 - 1 cup or so to make a nice big pie.  The only "tweak" I've ever done is to squeeze some fresh lemon over it -- about 1/4 of a fresh lemon.  That's totally optional though, and this pie tastes fine regardless.  Brushing the milk and sprinkling sugar over the top makes it look beautiful; again, optional but in this case I do think it makes a difference in terms of visual appeal!  I've gotten rave reviews every time I've made this -- so simple, so easy, so YUMMY!

Delicious!  It turned out so beautiful and tasted amazing!  I tried to cook this pie at 350 with another pie, but realized it wasn't getting hot enough to thicken the juices.  I recommend cooking at 375...just like the recipe says!!

This one is a keeper.  Brought one of the pies in to work, and the guys on the team said it was the best blackberry pie they'd ever eaten.  The filling was nicely firm and sliced easily.  I did reduce the amount of sugar on the top to about 1-2 T.  This pie was delicious and surprisingly simple.

This was incredibly easy to make, I had never made Pie before today, and I even made my pastry by scratch! 
Sooo good! 
I didn't brush with milk or sprinkle with 1/4 c of sugar, I forgot. But still delicious

I love this recipe!  I have made it many times and it is always a hit!  I also use two bags of frozen blackberries.  I ran warm water over them to defrost them.  When I used fresh berries it bubbled over with to much juice.

I liked the recipe,my boyfriend requested it,but I would suggest adding a little more berries or cut down on the dry ingredients because I thought the filling came out to firm.

I modified this quite a bit but it as a hit. We had a patch producing berries so we would collect some and freeze them with a touch of honey - enough to coat. Before making this, we used half frozen and half thawed fresh. Because of the honey, used half the sugar and 1/2 cup flower and a couple tablespoons of corn starch because of the frozen berries were extra wet. Also threw in a handful of fresh blueberries from the garden.

I prebaked the crust with eggs not milk, and in a last minute twist we only had 1 pie shell so we topped with a crumble  made of 

3/4 cup flour
3/4 cup oats
3/4 cup brown sugar
1 1/2 tsp cinnamon
7 tbsp slightly softened butter

Baked the whole time at 400 instead of up and down since the top didn't need browning (crumble).

I was nervous about making a "crumble+pie" but ut was just enough sweet and just enough savory. 

The pie lasted about 5 minutes served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Def recommend this variation if you are not a "baker" type and love to go off recipe. No fail :)

I made this pie recipe with a mix of blackberries and strawberries. I used the crust recipe from joyofbaking.com and did not brush the bottom with beaten egg. The crust was still crisp after setting overnight. I also took the advice of a few reviewers and squeezed lemon juice over the fruit and added a little butter as well. The pie was delicious! I was worried that it would be too juicy when I initially took it out of the oven but when I sliced into it, everything stayed together. First time I've made a pie and I would have to say it was a great success!

Filling was very watery/runny despite extra flour. The bottom crust was basically under cooked and mush.

This was a great recipe. I used 5-6 cups of berries just to fill up my pie plate. I also added some lemon juice as other reviews had suggested. I also always use America's Test Kitchens fool proof pie crust recipe (with vodka in it). My husband finished one pie in 2 days and asked for another. Yum.

I tried the suggestion of substituting 1/4 c minute  tapioca for 1/4 c of the flour, and really did not like the result.  The berries became rather dry and gelatinous.  I also added about 1/2 c. more berries than called for, but still think that wasn't enough.  I like juicy (not runny, not gelatinous) pies, but with this pie I tasted too much crust.  Still, this is a solid recipe, and next time I'll stick to basics!

Very good filling.  I did add more sugar, 1 cup total.  I also cut up some butter and laid it on top of the filling under the crust.  Used butter instead of milk on top, too.  Blackberry pie is my husband's favorite and he loved this.

This was very good and easy.  I used a pre-made frozen pie crust and put in an extra cup of berries.  Next time, I'll add an additional 1/4 C sugar to the berry mix to make it a little sweeter.

This is the first fruit pie I made and it is outstanding! I didn't really like blackberry pie before this. I used big whole berries that turned out great. I recommend mixing berries with sugar and flour until there is no more white. I used a lattice top which was beautiful. My bottom crust was undercooked which is common with new pie bakers.

Maybe I seem a but unfair considering how everyone went on and on about this pie. It might be all okay for beginnings but the flavor is really lacking. I made it because of the reviews but I can honestly say this is the first time I ever preferred the pie crust to the filling. I even added extra sugar and it still tasted dull, and yes my berries were fresh and in season.

AMAZING! FANTASTIC! I made a crumb topping instead of pastry and it was soooo good. My family gobbled it up and already want another one. This pie will be a family favorite for sure. Try it with a crumb top (butter, sugar, brown sugar, some spices) absolutely amazing. BTW this was my first blackberry pie- blackberries are my husband's favorite so this was a REAL winner!! Thanks

This was my first time making a blackberry pie, everyone loved it. They demolished it before a famous apple pie. I did follow the recipe exactly, but when I mixed the fresh berries and sugar mixture, the mixture had a layer at the bottom, not absorbed by the berries, so I added some frozen blueberries and it was AWESOME.

This recipe was super easy and the taste was fantastic!  I had bought some fresh blackberries at the Farmers Market on Saturday and wasn't sure what to do with them.  I found this recipe and it was so easy and perfect.  I didn't change anything except that I DO NOT make my own pie crusts (thank you Pillsbury for making roll out premade crusts!).  I did not use an egg wash on the bottom crush as I like it when my crust gets some juice in it.  But the flour held the berries together perfectly and it was beautiful!  Thanks again!

This was pretty good. I used 6 cups of berries because I like a lot of fruit in my pies. I added extra sugar because blackberries are tart. The filling was still pretty tart but not bad. I did have some juice in my pie - some reviewers said it was too solid. I did add a few tiny pats of butter under the crust though. I will probably make this again but add even more sugar.

I enjoy cooking and I picked fresh black berrys thismorninr and looked on the net for a pie recipe and found this one.  this is probably the best pie I ever eat it isn't runny and not too sweet or tart.  I did have to give it a little extra time to cook but it turned out great I made three of them thanks for posting it and cheers David Eatonville, WA.

YUMMY!  Excellent recipe.  I doubled it to fit into a deep dish pan.  I also splashed a little lemon juice on it.  No other changes and it was great!

This will be the only blackberry pie recipe we use!  It's perfect just as written.  I did use turbinado sugar (unprocessed dried cane juice) and an egg wash instead of the milk.

I liked this recipe. The only problem I had with it was the part of putting milk on the crust.  I don't know if I used too much milk but I had to bake it much longer than the time called for.  I will probably make this again and use an egg white wash instead of milk and sugar.

EXCELLENT!!  I used it with the Best Ever Pie Crist on this site, and it was THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD!  I was making two pies with these two recipes, and so I got messed up and accidentally doubled the flour and sugar in this recipe for one pie, but it still turned out delicious!  I couldn't believe it...thank you for sharing!

I made this as directed except that I added extra berries in the top unsweetened layer.  That should have made the filling thinner, but it was still too firm for me.  I don't want the berries all running out the side, but I also don't want them standing up like a solid, which is what they did.  I would make this again, but with half the flour.

This is a good starting point, but I had to make several adjustments to get it right.  I only put a third of the sugar on the crust, and that was more that enough.  I wouldn't use milk on the crust EVER again.  I will listen to my gut instinct next time and just use  a wash of egg white, and only 2 Tblsp of sugar for the crust top.  I put much more berries than called for, otherwise it would've been lacking berries and I can get a pie without enough berries from any baker/restaurant.

This recipe is fantastic.  I used berries that I had picked down the street from my house and a refrigerated pie crust from Trader Joe's, and the end result was delicious and super easy to make!  The milk and sugar on the top crust made it nice and crunchy.  I'm going to make another pie in a couple of days!

I love blackberry pie but I've had better than this. The filling was really good but brushing milk on the crust made it soggy. It ruined a crust that needs no help in being delicious.

Delicious! I followed the recommendation of a reviewer and cut the flour to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup tapioca and the blackberry filling had a great consistency. Everyone raved about it and I will make this again soon!

We have wild blackberries that grow in our backyard and my son loves to pick them for me. After a few weeks of this I had an abundance of blackberries! This was the perfect recipe. So tasty. Nothing but great reviews from us!! Thanks.

This was pretty good considering that I'm not a blackberry fan. My fiance loves blackberries and said this could have used more sugar. I did use the tip of brushing egg on the bottom of the crust (which worked well) though I would recomend brushing the top with milk. Thanks Michelle

I just made and ate a piece of the pie.  It was somewhat disappointing
to me because the flour mixed with blackberry took over the natural
blackberry taste.  I regreted using all the good fresh berries I had for the pie.  I would use less flour next time and more sugar for inside.

this pie came out ALMOST perfect! i have always hated pie crusts and i now know why - it's the shortening. butter makes all of the difference in the crust. the milk and sugar on top was a great technique that made the pie look fantastic. i personally wouldn't describe the bottom crust as "soggy" so much as "soft" and my family and i liked it! crispy on top and soft on the inside. 

i would like to experiment with adding tapioca flour instead of baking flour to the berries - the filling was a touch gummy even using less flour. but still the best pie i've ever had - you can't go wrong with this simple, natural, wholesome recipe - the way it should be!

This pie recipe was wonderful for its simplicity. Nothing detracted from the blackberry flavor & it came out wonderfully. This pie also cuts very well (doesn't ooze out of the crust). Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was great; I would not change a thing.  This was the first fruit pie I have ever made and everyone loved it!  Filling was just right - not too runny and not too gelatinous.  I used some fresh and some frozen berries.  I WILL make this again.  Thanks Michelle!

Wow! I am NOT a chef, in the least. Yet I followed this recipe precisely and ended up with three scrumptious homemade blackberry pies!

This is the first year that our blackberry tree (not a bush; a tree!) in our backyard produced edible fruit! Of course, I was raised in the deep south and enjoyed blackberry-bush cobbler on many occasions.

I spent 3 hours harvesting 12 cups of ripe blackberries from the tree; they're smaller than a regular bush blackberry. Then I searched the Internet and found this recipe (I needed a simple recipe right away).

Michelle is right; this recipe will never let you down! The only thing I had trouble with was laying down the top pie crust without tearing it up; I should've left it in the refrigerator/freezer until right before I needed it, instead of letting it lay on the counter for several minutes ahead of time.

Thanks, Michelle, for that yummy recipe. And yes, the vanilla ice cream to top the warm pie with is most essential. Yum-yum!

With all ready prepared pie crusts even the littlest cook can prepare this pie with minimal supervision.

Common ingredients make the job more likely to be prepared.

Worth trying!

Awesome! Like others, I used 5 cups of berries, one cup sugar, a forth cup tapioca, a forth cup flour, a couple of tablespoons of lemon juice. I took the advice of those who suggested thoroughly mixing until no dry flour was visible. I used the Pillsbury crust, and went for the lattice top, used egg wash on bottom crust, and top, plus used course sugar on the top crust. After some 20 minutes, I covered the outer edges with a rim of foil and it was the best looking pie I ever made! Cant wait to do it again! - Mark

Went out to pick 4 cups of blackberries and followed the recipe. Easy. In the oven now as my wife is taking nap. It will be done and cooling before she even knows it. Yes I cleaned the kitchen up. Not bad for a guy who didn't take home economics . LOL. Blackberries are in abundance out here in Washington State.  Regards, Robert

Super easy, super good, and everyone loves it! Was definitely not too labor intensive and it was great. I used some freshly picked blackberries from the field next to my house, added more than just 1/2 cup more over the top, and it was gone in seconds!

Outstanding! Made as directed, however took into consideration the suggestions from several cooks; added some lemon juice, made sure all fruit was thoroughly coated, and topped with butter before adding top crust. Also brushed bottom crust with egg before adding filling. Husband raved!!

This is the best Berry Pie recipe I have ever made and the family loves it. I make it with 41/2 cups of Blackberries. I don't change a thing except bake it a little longer because we live in the Mountains. Serve it with vanilla ice cream and wow. It won't last long.

The pie was great! I followed the directions almost exactly, and the pie held up very well. As per the recommendations of other raters, I brushed the bottom and top crust with egg before placing the pie in the oven. Overall, pie was delicious.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it got RAVE reviews. I used 6 cups of berries and baked at 375 for the entire time. Also, in the video it suggests using an egg wash on the bottom crust so that it does not become soggy. I highly recommend as I didn't do that the first time I made it. Made it for the second time two days after Thanksgiving.

Really good recipe! I used beaten egg on the bottom of the crust and over the top and the crust turned out PERFECT, homemade is the way to go! Lattice top crust cooks the berries perfectly and you get LOTS of compliments ;). However, more sugar can be used, especially if you let the kids pick the blackberries. If you like your blackberry pie especially tart then 1/2 sugar is the right amount. I would go with about 1 - 1 1/2 cups of sugar according to your personal preference. Other than that, I loved the pie with some vanilla ice cream! The tartness of the pie was lessened.

I made this today and I must say I am very happy with the way it turned out. Few notes: I brushed egg on the bottom as others suggested also I added 1tsp lemon juice and 1tsp vanilla end result was out of this world sets up really well too.

I made this recipe as written and wound up with too much flour/sugar and no boilage on the filling during baking. The result was a pie with beautiful crust but the interior had clumps if sugar/flour throughout, visually unappealing, problematic when you get a bite of berry and a chunk of flour. I think it was on the right track for a good basic recipe but I found the "what to do ifs" in the comments after I made the pie, and those changed this to another recipe. Nonetheless, I was glad to try it, thank you for posting Michelle.

A wonderful pie for minimal effort!  I followed the advice of others and brushed the inner crust with egg to keep it from going soggy, used fresh berries, substituted 1/4 cup tapioca for the flour, and added the zest and juice of half a lemon, and increased the sugar slightly.  Yum!  The lemon complimented the berry flavor nicely without being obvious.  Even with the added sugar, the pie still had a nice tart flavor, and wasn't overly sweet.

Not runny, not too sweet- Big hit at Thanksgiving.  As other's suggested, I brushed bottom crust with egg wash just prior to filling and baking.  I was a little short on blackberries, so subbed some chopped Granny Smith apples to fill in. I will use this recipe, again. Thanks!

This is a great recipe! Good texture, not runny, not too thick. I had 5 cups of berries total so that's what I put in the pie and added a bit of sugar and flour to accommodate that. I threw in a tsp of lemon juice for brightness like other reviewers suggested and some cinnamon. I also did the eggwash on the bottom crust and top. I would recommend this recipe to everyone!

I like this pie. It's the first pie I've ever made. 
I did like others suggested -- beaten egg white brushed on bottom and top crust, and lemon juice -- I forgot the butter. Which I bet the salt would've added a nice flavor. I added 1/2 of a juiced lemon. And I did not put 1/4 of a cup of sugar on top...yikes. I put 1 tsp but I shouldve used 2 tsp. 
I also first mixed the sugar and flour thoroughly before mixing with the berries. When I mixed the berries in it there was still a lot of the sugar/flour mix left over. I just tried to evenly distribute it. 
The pie is very congealed (stiff/jellied) but I like that. 
Also, I enjoyed the tartness but you may want to add more sugar to the berries. 

Overall I love it. I will try the butter and more sugar next time in the pie and on top (since 1 tsp didn't cover the pie). My husband didn't like how tart it was. 
Also, I used 1/3 of each berry: blackberrys, blueberrys, and raspberrys. 
I found it fit very well into my 9inch pan. 

I'm about to go back for my 3rd slice....I will be working the calories off from this pie for the next week....hahah

I'm not a fruit pie fan myself, and neither is my husband, so I never had cause to make one even though I bake all the time. But my husband has a coworker who loves blackberry pie, but hadn't had it since he was about 10 years old (he's in his fifties now!) So I made a blackberry pie and brought it in when they were on lunch break, and he said it was just like his mother used to make. All they guys there who tried it were going crazy over it, and it was the first pie I'd ever made! I used the "Pastry for Double Pie-Crust" recipe as submitted to this web site by Taste of Home Test Kitchen.

Not enough fruit for my 9-inch deep dish pie plate. It baked down to one berry deep, even though I added an extra 3/4 cup of fruit. Worse, though the berries looked and tasted amazing before I put them in the pie, there was no juice. That meant the finished pie was a layer of berries with no set juice to bind them.  The finished pie had lumps of flour between the berries. I've made wonderful pies for almost 50 years, but this was a total disaster. It should have had cornstarch instead of so much flour, plus some lemon juice, maybe more sweetener (sugar, Splenda or honey), and some butter. The only thing good about my result was my usual beautiful crust.

OMG!  I made this for my neighbor's birthday.  It was unbelievably delicious.  Not only that it only took 4 cups of blackberries.  Everyone that was lucky enough to get a piece of this pie raved about it.  Thanks!  This is a real keeper!

I am so excited..I went to pick blackberries today and wanted to try to make a pie. Previous attempts were watery and had been years since I tried again. This recipe is so much like my moms and only thing I forgot to do was keep some berries for the top..but all in all it is fantastic..great recipe..thankyou

The last time I made a blackberry pie I was 16, This recipe is fool proof.  I used the pie crust from food network's barefoot contessa. Ina makes a crust in the food processor, yummy and very easy.  Loved the tartness of this and the ease.  Pick wild blackberries because I live in Oregon and we have a plethera of them.   Very good recipe, used about 6 cups or more of the berries as I have a deep dish pie plate. I used the egg wash and lemon juice and pats of butter.  Forgot to but the unsweetened berries befoe the top crust, not a problem... Really good recipe.

This was the best pie I've ever tasted, oops... after my grandmother's pie, of course :)
Update: Made this using tapioca flour and the filling came out very jelly-like, almost dry. I think next time I will use half tapioca half all purpose.

This pie was amazing and so simple.  I used pillsbury crusts from the refrigerator case (two per package) and the taste couldn't have been better.  I also used about six cups of berries all together to fill the crust.  Also used egg as others suggested along with a little lemon juice.  It just got better each day and my husband and I finished it off in a weekend (with vanilla bean ice cream of course)!  Looking forward to using this simple recipe for other pies.  My husband wants an apple raisin one next.  Thanks for an awesome recipe.  I will use it again and again.

I really liked this pie!  Not too runny, not too sweet (if you like sweeter pie or your local berries are a bit too tart, you might add some extra sugar).  I think if anything, I would recommend increasing the berries.  4C was just not enough to fill a 9" pie pan.  I used 6C (and increased the flour and sugar (about 3/4C each) and it was great!  I served it with Breyer's natural vanilla ice cream, and it was a real hit!  And not even a bit hard.

I like the taste of the inside of the pie, but think just a simple brushing of milk on the crust and half the amount of sugar on the top crust would be better. I only used about 1/2 of the amount of milk that was called for and it came out a little soggy and was worse the next day.  The next day the top crust was gooey.  Too much milk!  Next time I would use just a little amount.  Otherwise- very easy and tastey.  I was bummed not to have more leftovers.  The crust was just too soggy and gooey the next day.

Very good for a pie that sets quickly. You can eat it almost right out of the oven. And it is good warm. I hope it will be good cold tomorrow morning, too (pie for breakfast!). Followed recipe. You do get clumps of flour/sugar a bit (because the berries are so big?). That might be better w wild berries. If you have time overnight to let it set, make another recipe w less flour for pure berry flavour.

I used this recipe modified a little. I like the low sugar content. I pick my Blackberries very ripe so I don't need lots of sugar anyways. I subbed the flour with Tapioca and used half (1/4 cup) I also added a little lemon juice. It was great everyone said the sweetness was just right. I think others are not picking their berries ripe enough. I used 5 cups of black berries. Same amount of sugar.

It's a good BASIC recipe. the consistency is right. However, the flavor is lacking. It's very bland. I suggest adding some lemon (juice or zest) and some other spices (I actually added cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and cardamon). The taste definitely improved. BUT if you do add spices, make sure to only add a little bit, as to not over power the taste of the berries. But other than that, this is a great recipe!

This pie was very simple and delish!! Also was the only blackberry pie I've ever made that held together and didnt run all over when I cut into it. I added a bit more sugar as my berries were picked from the yard and very tart, but this recipe is definately a keeper!!

This pie is great!  I was glad to see a recipe for a berry pie that didn't use cinnamon, etc.  Pies should reflect the flavor of the berry and not added spices. You could use Ritz crackers and get the same flavor when spices overpower the fruit.-----I just hope that everyone has their own berry patch considering that a 3 oz. pkg. costs almost $4.

Delicious Pie!! Also easy to make and not to sweet or bitter. It has a distinct tart taste to it which makes it even more enjoyable. But the sad thing is that this pie hurt me!!!! Yes, it did! I had to go hand pick the black berries for this pie and got a scratch on my leg and tons of thorns on my hands!! Great Recipe!! Highly Recommended!!

A very nice pie, I used fresh blackberries picked today, but increased it to 5 cups and added about 1/2 cup of raspberries that I happened to have on hand.  I used a family recipe for the crust called "no fail crust" and it worked beautifully!!!  The only thing I would change is to decrease the amount of sugar sprinkled on the top crust, 1/8 of a cup would have been plenty!!!  I did have to bake it longer than the recipe stipulated, about 60 minutes total, until the crust was nicely browned.  Thanks, this was a keeper!!!

This pie turned out perfectly!  It was delicious and was immediately devoured by my family along with some vanilla bean ice cream.  It's so easy to make, I did as others suggested with the egg brushed on the shell.  A perfect summer desert!

My berries were wild, so I added 1/4 cup additional sugar. The taste of this pie was great; however, it was not very attractive. The berries did not juice with the sugar and flour, so the cut pie looks like blackberries in a white filling. I will make it again because the taste is great, but, I'll mash some berries before baking so that the sugar and flour are blackberry colored.

I have access to a blackberry bush but dont like blackberries. My husband does so I picked some, used this recipe and just had some. It was really impressive. So easy to use, my husband just gobbled up 3 pieces. (omg!) I made homemade whipped cream to go with it, and it was really good, I must admit. I dont like the tartness opf berries but in the pie, its really sweet and not runny at ALL. thanks! Its in my recipe box for good now.

I made this pie tonight and it was a huge hit!  I didn't have 4 cups of fresh blackberries, so I used 2 cups of fresh blackberries I purchased from the farmer's market this week and 2 cups of fresh blueberries and raspberries I already had at home.  I lovingly called it "Summer Berry Pie!"  I also followed a previous reviewer's advice and added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar, as my berries were a little on the tart side, but after the fact I believe the extra sugar was not necessary at all.  Next time I'll just use the 1/2 cup.  The pie stands up perfectly!  I made the crust using the recipe for butter crust from this month's Everyday Food magazine and the combination of the pie filling with the butter crust and a big scoop of vanilla ice cream on top was heavenly!  Loved it!  Will make it again!

Very good and EASY!  I used a frozen pie crust and made a crumble topping with oatmeal, brown sugar, and butter.  I added a little extra sugar, but I don't think I really needed to. Excellent served with ice cream and not messy at all.  Everyone loved it!

I didn't find this pie as simple to make with frozen berries as it seems to be with fresh.  I thought 3 of the 10-oz bags of blackberries would be fine - was about 4C, but ended up having to run to the store to get 2 more bags AND used a bag of wild blueberries I had in the fridge for more volume!  Baked it in a pillsbury crust I had put inside a 9" glass dish.  I mixed 1/2 C flour with about 1/2 C sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon;  put 1/3 of that in the bottom of the pan, then mixed the rest with the berries (in batches because I didn't realize I didn't have enough berries until I had already put the first batch into the crust!).  I cut out stars and put a big one in the center and lined the rim with little stars... should have been more careful because the points have broken off on quite a few!  Don't attempt unless you're feeling quite patient :)

Good recipe.  Made as written but found some of the juice very flour-y in the pie and yet still had a lot of juice that did not thicken at all (this was the juice that baked out of the berries in the oven).  Was delicious though.

This was WONDERFUL!  I added a little more sugar, but we like a slightly more sweet than tart berry pie.  Easy to put together, and it looked lovely.  Thank you.

Turned out perfect.  Made no adjustments to the recipe, except I shortened the cooking time.  the crust would have been too dark otherwise.

I've never been good at pies, but this one made me look like a pro!  It was delicious and couldn't have been easier. I didn't follow the directions on how many berries. Got a little carried away blackberry picking. So I loaded each pie (made 6 pies altogether) until it was slightly overflowing with berries. Followed the recipe exactly other than that. It was absolutely delicious and made a great gift. I'm still getting compliments.  Thanks for making me look good!!!!

This turned out wonderful.  The only thing I altered was the amount of milk and sugar I used on the top of the crust.  I thought it was perfect using about half of both of the original measurments.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and was so pleased.  I picked fresh blackberries from my blackberry bush, and used a pillsbury refrigerated crust.  It was sooo good!

Great alternative to cobbler. I also brushed bottom crust with egg and added butter pats to top. Used refrigerated pie dough and turned out great! Not too sweet, true berry taste came through. A keeper....

The best part about this was how easy it was. I made it with Marie Callendar's store bought pie crust, threw in a few blueberries to make it extra fruity and it was ready in no time. One suggetion, go easy on the milk on the top crust, the crust got weighed down a bit. Overall, very tast.

I think this recipe is pretty good. I made it the first time following the recipe to a t but added fresh rasberrys to it along with the blackberries.  That didn't taste so good, then the second time I did everything the same except i ommited the flour to the mixture (I found that it sucked up all the juices)and didn't sprinkle sugar  on top and then it came out good.  Thanks for sharing.  Will make it again.

This pie was just plain awesome! I bought 2 pillsbury deep dish crusts because I had slightly more than 4 cups of blackberries. I followed the recipe except for adding maybe a tablespoon of butter to dot the top of the fruit with. I also didn't quite use the entire 1/4 cup of sugar on the top of the pie. The consistency came out perfectly and the sweetness of the filling was just right. Now I can do something else with the abundance of fresh blackberries I have besides cobbler!

Mmmm Mmmm good. I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and brushed the bottom crust with egg before adding filling. I also squeezed a bit of lemon over the filling and dotted with butter.  On one occasion I used Splenda instead of sugar and that turned out good as well.

Delicious. I made it twice in a week with freshly picked blackberries. I used the Oil Pie Crust recipe submitted by Donna - I would suggest making perhaps 2 batches of the dough though. Such a great pie. Fabulous with vanilla icecream.

My husband is a light breakfast eater and just had two pieces of this with his coffee!  It was AWESOME.  Just the right amount of flour- it was firm and not runny.  We used fresh blackberries from our yard which usually go to waste and will make this often!

This dish was so easy, my husband made it!! He used frozen blackberries, and the pie was still delicious.  I was a little worried at first, because there seemed to be extra sugar&flour in the mix, but we poured it in anyway, and when it baked, it soaked up the extra sugar&flour. Highly Recommended recipe.

Michelle has a winner at the dessert table in my house with this pie.  A good old fashion and shamefully easy recipe. Bake it...you won't be sorry!! Thanks Michelle, from Big Mama's kitchen.

I made this pie with my father and I'm 13 years old. My father is a diabetic so we subsituited Nutra Sweet for the white sugar and it still turned out great. We thought it was a bit dry though so you might want to cut back on the flour just a bit. Overall it's very delicious and extremely easy to make!

Makes an excellent pie.  So easy to do.  
I made mine into 4 1/2" pies.  One recipe does two pies.  Just the right size for 2 people.

An absolutely fabulous pie!!!!!!! I found a mistake in the recipe's list of ingredients. This pie calls for a double pie crust, not a single pie crust.

This was my very first berry pie.  I was nervous.  Your recipe was quick, simple, and very tasty!!  Thanks for the great recipe. I liked the milk and sugar on the top crust.  It gave the pie a nice look.  Thanks again.

Turned out wonderfully! Used five 6-oz. packages of blackberries and 1/4 cup tapioca instead of the flour. Will definitely make again and again!

I made two of these pies.  #1 was just just as recipe stated.  It turned out so beautiful I didn't want the family to cut it...but they did and everyone loved LOVED it.  Now for pie #2....  I had blackberries left over but not enough to make another pie so I thought (tapping my finger on my cheek and with my eyes turned heavenward) ...   I had fresh raspberries and blue berries in fridge mixed together with the blackberries I had enough for another pie.  I also had enough crust left over so I begin to make my razzle black and blueberry pie.  It also turned out so pretty and yummy to boot.  I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars.... It is simply great and very tasty as is...and also a great starter recipe for added bits to the pie.   Let your imagination soar.  :)   Cudo's to the original poster...AWESOME recipe !!!

This is the favorite pie in our house for now on five years! Summer, winter, or fall, my wife and daughters always request this pie. Don’t skimp on the milk and sugar on the top crust—we’re all convinced that this is what makes the pie over-the-top great!

The first time I made this pie, I thought 1/2 cup of flower was too much, but it turned out way too juicy and runny.
Since then I have stuck with the recipe and I love it.
It has turned out excellent every time.

I thought it was too good to be true when the recipe said frozen berries could be used as there aren't any good fresh ones at this time of year, at least that are easy to find. It was completely totally too good to be true. Do not use frozen berries with this recipe. It tasted like...a pie crust with some sugar on it and some vaguely berry-ish goopy filling. Maybe the fresh berries make all the difference, I bake regularly but I do not bake pies often, if at all, so I can't speak with any authority on it.

Mixed in blueberries to make for a unforgettable pie that my parents can’t stop raving about. This is a definite staple at our house and something that can get lots of applause for little effort. The secret is lemon zest and love!

Hubby and I loved this.  He had picked the berries from our backyard the day before....how fresh!  I used half as much flour per other reviews, and the filling was perfect.  Not too sweet and not too runny.  This recipe is a keeper!

Really happy that I found this recipe before fruit picking season, freshly picked Olallieberries are fantastic for this one. Would recommend setting its baking time to 23 or less as 24 burned the outer crust [I removed it]

This is a great recipe! Nice thick filling! I did not put the entire 1/4 sugar on top though. That would have been way too much, a slight dusting was perfect!

This pie was delicious, made this for my daughter-in-love, for her birthday as she requested a berry pie. I used fresh blackberries and eggwashed  the bottom of the crust so it would not become soggy. also followed the advice of extra berries and a little less sugar and milk on top. Also added a little lemon and butter pats on the top prior to adding the top crust. I will definitely be making this again.

This was the first pie recipe I've ever made, so I was a bit apprehensive. However, it came out pretty good for the first try! I used the crust recipe on the Crisco can, and made this filling with fresh blackberries. After reading reviews about using tapioca flour, I figured I should use it. However, I had xantham gum on hand already so I used just under a 1/2 cup of flour, and then maybe a teaspoon of xantham gum. It was a clean slice - not runny at all! I also brushed the bottom crust with egg wash before filling. 

Not sure if I was supposed to, but when mixing the blackberries with the flour/sugar/xantham gum, I mashed them a bit to make it into a gooey filling. The directions don't specify to do that, but I think you're supposed to. 

Also I subbed coconut sugar for white sugar - next time I will increase the amount just a bit.

I made a lattice crust, just to make it pretty, so I used a touch less flour to allow for evaporation.

I made this for the family holiday dinner and it was well received!! My brother-in-laws all loved it. The only change I made was I omitted the milk and used the rest of my egg wash on the top crust, then sprinkled the sugar over that. It gave the crust a nice flaky, sugary appearance. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe reminded me of my mother’s deep dish blackberry cobbler when we had our own blackberry patch.  So I had to try it. Absolutely delicious!!!! I splashed just a little Grand Marnier over the berries before adding the top crust. This is a winner. Thank you sharing and bringing back wonderful memories.

I can't get over this pie. I bake when I'm stressed (luckily for my family) and this is the most delicious recipe yet! Blackberries are expensive, and so I only use half of the recommended amount of blackberries, and for the other half, I use blueberries, which makes the pie sweeter. I highly recommend pairing this pie with vanilla ice-cream!

Added some raspberries and blueberries to fill it out a little more; because nobody wants a skimpy pie!??I used cornstarch rather than flour.

I've made this twice and the first time I loved it and so did my friends that got to try it. The second time, I had an abundance of fresh blackberries so I thought why not?? I added 2 extra cups of blackberries, an extra 1/4 cup of flour and only a couple tbsp of extra sugar in the mix and it turned out AMAZING. The pie dish was full to the top all the way across! LOVE THIS RECIPE!!

I made this pretty much verbatim, with the exception of using gluten free flour and perhaps a bit more than 4 cups of blackberries. It was really good! I've never used an egg wash on the bottom of the pie crust before adding the filling. It really did keep the crust from becoming soggy! I usually have problems with having my pies too runny...this, if anything was a bit on the dry side to my thinking, but everyone else raved about how good it was!

The only change I made was to cut the milk and sugar in half as I thought it was too much for the pie topping. Otherwise, this recipe was perfect! Perfect amount of flour to keep the pie from running, it held its form and I got rave reviews from everyone.

I thought the recipe worked great.  Next time I will cut back on the flour based on the juice level of the berries.  I did the 1/2 cup of flour and felt that it was a bit too much.  Taste was great and crust was tender.

First time I ever made a pie.  I made it for my boyfriend's birthday. It turned out perfect. I did add beaten egg to the bottom of the crust. I also put a little flour on the bottom crust to keep from sticking to the glass pan. I dotted butter on the blackberries. Could have used more blackberries. I would recommend 5 cups. Also a little lemon juice on top(another viewer suggested). The pie was delicious just a little to tart for my taste which is why I recommend the lemon juice. Also I did change the top crust. I used about 1 1/2 tsp melted butter brushed on and sprinkled the sugar on top as directed. It was a hit and he is already asking for another pie!!!!

My pie turned out really good. It could’ve used a little more sugar. It wasn’t quite as sweet as I would’ve liked. I think I would add another 1/4 cup sugar if I make it again.  Also, it seemed like 4 cups of berries wasn’t quite enough to fill my pie plate. However, it is a deep dish plate and I didn’t take that into consideration. Great recipe and very easy to make!

I gave it four stars based on the changes I made. I used 1/4 cup of instant tapioca instead of the flour and I brushed the bottom crust with egg. My husband loved this but the next time I make it I’m going to cut back on the tapioca and add a little extra sugar. I felt like it needed more flavor.

This is my first pie attempt but I couldn't pass up fresh blackberries.   After reading reviews all I tweaked was adding cinnamon and a little lemon.   I egg washed the bottom crust.   Turned out PERFECT!

Loved it!! This was a great blackberry pie recipe, so simple but delicious. I added a cinnamon sugar crumble (1/2 cup sugar, 1/3 cup flour, 1.5 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 cup cubes butter) over the top. Turned out great! Will be making this one again!

I’ve made this pie 3 times this week because fresh blackberries are 88 cents right now! My son has celiac so I substitute the flour for tapioca flour and of course I use a pre-made gluten free crust. The first time I added more sugar to the recipe about 3/4 of a cup because my husband is from Alabama and they add extra sugar to everything. I misread the recipe on the pie I made tonight and only used 1/4 of a cup for the filling and the pie is not as good as it was the first time - but the ice cream definitely helps sweeten it a bit more. Overall this is a really easy recipe to make.

I took the advice from other reviewers and brushed egg on the bottom, added lemon and butter on the top. I didn’t use the full 1/4 cup of sugar on the top and wished I had...or added more generous lemon.
I used frozen berries and it wasn’t too juicy as feared

Excellent pie and super easy to make. I followed others suggestions - use 5 pints of fresh berries, 1/4 cup tapioca instead of flour, only 1 tablespoon of milk and just sprinkled sugar on the top instead of using 1/4 cup. Pie was not runny and just slightly tart. I will make this again... It may become my go-to pie.

This blackberry pie was so good! the only bad art about it was that the bottom was all raw, but the top was perfectly done. By the time I took this pie out of the oven, the top was a little bit more done then I would have liked it to be, but all in all, this was a super easy blackberry pie.

This pie is fantastic!  Soooooo easy, and delish!  I do a large adjustment to the berry quantity, though (like other reviewers).  Inside, I put in approx. 6 cups and then "top" with between 1 1/2 to 2 cups of whole berries.  The topping is a TBL of milk, a splash of vanilla (maybe 1/2 tsp?) and some egg white.  I agree, no need to top the pie with so much sugar; just a sprinkling of a coarse sugar is perfect.

This is my first time ever making a pie. We have lots of blackberries in our yard and surrounding area so had fresh berries so decided to give pie making a try. I used tenderflake deep dish pre-made crusts .  The only changes I made were using an egg wash (egg +water) as suggested on the bottom of pie and then on the top under the sugar dusting and added a little more sugar to the berry mixture. I think my helper was pick some not fully ripe berries.  It turned out awesome and I will for sure use this recipe again!  Recommend this to any beginner out there!

I made it as written and it turned out great! I will make it again. I may add another cup of berries and use tapioca instead of flour with the berries (because my mom always used tapioca in pie fillings). The 1/4 cup sugar on top made a great sugar crust and was a great touch.

Flavor was good but next time I'll add less flour. The berries ended up like gelatin and too dry.

Excellent!  I used half blackberries and half raspberries just to mix things up a little.  Per the recipe notes I used frozen berries and after reading the reviews of others I decided to use tapioca rather than flour.  I loved the flavor- would have been perfect with some vanilla ice cream!

I didn't have enough frozen blackberries so I also added frozen raspberries (thawed of course).  This is not a sweet pie which is fine by us.  I also brushed a beaten egg on the bottom crust to prevent the crust from getting too soggy.   Next time I will try just raspberries as I usually have loads harvested from my garden.  Good recipe.

It worked out great. I made it a Blackberry, blueberry, and strawberry pie. All were picked fresh. I used two cups of blackberries, and one and a half blueberries and one and a half strawberries.  With a homemade crust it was delicious!

I mainly used this recipe as a guide.  My husband and I are working to eliminate white refined sugar from our diets, so I did not use any sugar in my version of berry pie.  I added 2 teaspoons of honey & 1 teaspoon of lemon zest to the berry/flour mixture.  Four stars because my pie needed an addition 20+ minutes baking time, but then it came out beautifully!!  I served mine with homemade whipped cream sweetened with real maple syrup and a bit of lemon zest.

It tasted great.  I used fresh picked berries from nearby tree.  Note, i did make some changes as suggested by the reviewers.  I substituted Tapioca instead of the flour.  I brushed egg on the crust before putting in the berry filling, to help the crust from getting soggy.  I did NOT use the full amount of sugar or milk on top---  I simply brushed on a bit of milk, and topped with just  a little sprinkling of sugar.  it was plenty sweet as is.

The pie was great! Next time, however, I won't put 1/4 cup of sugar on top.  The second pie I made I just sprinkled a little on the top and it came out fine.  Great recipe, I'll make it again and again.

I made this exactly like the recipe instructed and it came out good. I can see why people are adding their own spin on it. Next time I think I'll either use less flour or use dried tapioca. Also I would use a squeeze of lemon juice over the berries.

Amazing pie recipe! I usually add a little bit of lemon over the berries in the end and coat the bottom crust with egg. Other than that it's great!

beats me how this recipe has so many good reviews despite the recipe being flat-out wrong about the baking time.  how can you rate it four stars with a caveat that the baking time needs to be doubled?  i followed the recipe exactly, and had a pie with soggy bottom, soggy top, visibly white patches of uncooked flour in the filling.  I'm not experienced with pastry so i totally fell for the inaccurate baking time.

I have such love for blackberries.  I didn't have enough fresh blackberries, but had a can of blackberry pie filling and combined the two.  It turned out wonderful! It's been years since I made a blackberry pie, but this recipe was great! I will make it again.

This pie was very good and easy to make.  I did make some adjustments in that I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, about a tsp of lemon juice, brushed the bottom with egg wash and about 1 tbsp butter on the top of the berries.  I made this for a birthday pie and she loved it.  Will make it again.

Absolutely amazing. Super easy to make , very hard to stop eating. Took other's advice and coated bottom with egg before adding the berries. Made no other adjustments. I will definitely be making this again.

Great recipe!  I used the exact amounts and ingredients except used a mix between fresh blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries.  I make my own pie crust and made sure the bottom shell was refrigerated very well before adding the filling, and using the egg whites for sealing the bottom and top pie shells.  The fillings was just the right consistency.  I will use this recipe again.

Very easy to make. I did brush some egg on the bottom crust before putting filling in. I can't tell if it helps since the bottom crust seemed a bit mushy. Flavor was good but I may want to try different thickening next time. I am not a fan of using flour as a thickening agent.

This was the first pie I ever made and it was a hit! I've made it twice now for Thanksgiving meals and this recipe was easy to follow... I only made a few variations. I let the blackberries macerate with the sugar while I got the crust ready, and added the flour later, and I think it helped bring more sweetness to the filling. Per recommendations before mine, I added a few chunks of butter on top of the filling around the pie before adding the top crust and it made the crust buttery and delicious! I also followed recommendations and used eggwash on the bottom of the crust before I added the filling and also on top of the crust. I preferred it better than the milk wash. I also decided on a lattice crust instead of a regular crust and it turned out well. I recommend putting a ring of foil over the edge of the crust so it doesn't burn. Will definitely be making again!

Good start, but recipe needs changes to work. 

Used 6 cups frozen blackberries, increased sugar to 3/4 cup, squeezed half a lemon on top, doted pie with 2 Tablespoons cold butter.  Use one beaten egg as an egg walk on bottom and top crust. Had to cook for an additional 30 minutes. Finally increased the temperature because it was taking forever. 

Next I will increase sugar to 1 cup and blind bake the crust or at least put into on a super hot cookie sheet. 

Cut well, held its shape extremely well. Great taste, just not sweet enough.

Super easy to make and delish!
Made it with fresh blackberries, raspberries and an apple (did not have enough blackberries on hand, so I used what I had at home). The rest of the ingredients I used were as written in the recipe. Rolled out the store bought pastry thinly.  Placed pie on the bottom rack in oven at 400 for 15 minutes then placed in middle at 350 for 20 - 25 minutes (until it bubbled and looked golden). I did not use the convection setting on the oven, I think this helped in not over baking the top of the pie.  Both the top and bottom crusts were nice and crisp. I will be making this again with all kinds of fruit combinations. Thanks for the great simple recipe.

This is a very simple recipe that lends itself well to customization. I upped the berries to about 6 cups and replaced almost all the sugar with Swerve artificial sweetener. You also don't need anywhere near as much milk and sprinkling sugar as listed; maybe a teaspoon or so of each. Following another reviewer's advice, I also replaced the flour in the filling with a quarter cup of tapioca. It held together well and went beautifully with vanilla ice cream.

I added 1/4 cup more sugar because my berries were froze and lost some sweetness from the time of picking them fresh.  I brushed beaten egg to the bottom crust prior to filling with berries and the top crust with beaten egg instead of milk.  I added 3/4 teaspoon lemon juice to the flour, sugar, berry mixture after it was COMPLETELY mixed and slightly soupy appearing.  I added the last 1/4 teaspoon lemon juice to just the berries on top of the sweetened mixture.  I used a deep dish pie pan (glass) and probably could have used 1 cup of berries on top of the mixture.  I also used 2 tablespoons of butter cut into small pieces on top of the berry mixture prior to the top crust.  I baked 30 minutes and let it sit in the stove for an extra 10-15 minutes with no heat before removing.  Let it set at least two hours on wire rack before cutting.  Perfection!

I loved this dish! Having never made this dish before and being 14 it was fairly easier than I thought it would be. I bought a 9" pie crust bowl from Walmart for the bottom and pillsbury rolled pie crust from Safeway to cover the top. Some tips and things that weren't very clear to me are: if you think the mixture is really watery don't be afraid to add more blackberries! One of mine (I made 2) was more watery than I liked. Also if you tast it it will tast floured down but once it cooks it will be fine (but adding a little more sugar never hurt nobody). Next, adding a layer of blackberries that weren't mixed with the flour/sugar combo on the top of the filling is SUPER IMPORTANT!!! You need to put a whole layer of blackberries covering all of the combo berries or else the juices will soak the covering dough and will not cook right! So save more than just a half cup for the top (If that made sense). Also like a other person suggested, one tablespoon of milk and sugar for the top was more than enough for my pies. I also whisked up a egg to cost the bottom because there were some cracks and it helped keep the bottom crust from getting soaked. I definitely will make this again maybe even experimenting with some lemon! And i can't imagin me trying it without ice cream because it was the best! Hope this helped you!!!

So simple! And I like that it used less sugar than others. Here are a few alterations I used: 
1) used whole wheat flour for my pie crust and in filling
2) used Truvia instead of sugar
3) used the pastry cutter to mash together the berries, sugar and flour

Turned out DELICIOUS!

I didn't care for the frozen black berries. That being said, my mother loved the pie. She said it was wonderful and she doesn't even like blackberries.

A very simple, but very good recipe. I've made it twice. The first time I followed the directions, but found the pie a little runny. The second time I added 1 1/2 T of flour to the berry, and sugar mixture.  I also did an egg wash on the bottom crust to make it less soggy.  Also for both I mixed all the berries, and sugar together, and used my own crust recipe with a simple egg wash.

I will make it again because the flavor is great. However, it is very runny.  Next time  I will try the tapioca rather than the flour as suggested by others.

It was awesome UNTIL I put it in the fridge overnight. When it cools off the blackberry flour mixture becomes very doughy and chewy and not at all pleasant. It's great as long as you eat it within an hour of removing from the oven though!

Yummy, will make this again!  Was looking for more of a pie than a cobbler, and this is it. I listened to the other reviews, added more blackberries (fresh) 6 cups, , used tapioca instead of flour, increased sugar, added chopped butter, and lemon juice. Brushed bottom pie crust with egg.  Brushed top crust with butter instead of milk.  Increased bake time by 20 minutes.
Perfect!

This needs alot more berries. I was very disappointed that it didn't come close to filling the pie dish. It was also very dry, and there was no way I was putting 1/4 cup sugar on top.

This was so incredibly easy and delicious. I used a store bought crust from Trader Joes which is amazing and the filling did not disappoint. Everyone loved it and this will be a new go to staple. Did add lemon as suggested.

Very easy to make.  I used berries that I froze during last year's berry season.  Just thaw and drain off most of the juice.  I doubled the filling for my 9.5" pie pan and it turned out beautifully!  My nephew requested a berry pie for his birthday and he said this was great (even took home a quarter of the pie!)  To keep the bottom crust from getting soggy, preheat the oven to 425 with a baking sheet inside the oven.  Put the pie on the hot baking pan then turn the oven down to the proper baking temperature.  This works every time to ensure a nice flaky bottom crust.

Taste is fine. I incorporated the suggestions of butter, lemon, tapioca in pie filling, and egg on crust. I found it inconsistent in flavor, some bites were amazing and perfect, other bites just so so. I wish it wouldn't have broken apart when I cut into it. Otherwise delicious

This is a simple pie recipe, you can mix it up right in the dish!  The milk on top of the crust is wonderful because it keeps it moist. This is also delicious with wipped cream

This recipe was the first pie I ever tried making, and remains one of my favorites.  Its also good with mulberries instead of blackberries.

This was the first blackberry pie that I've tried that didn't absolutely spill out in the middle.  My boyfriend RAVES about this pie and asks for it for his birthday every year.   It is extremely easy to make and is fabulous with a side of vanilla ice cream.

This pie was yummy!  I did only use one cup of sugar. I think with the cup and a half it might have been a little overly sweet. I also added a tablespoon of lemon juice.  I will definitely make this again.

I liked the recipe.  After browsing recipes, I chose this one. The only change I made is to sub approx. 1 T cornstarch for 1 T of the flour in the berries, and I cut back the sugar in the berries and on top of the pie.  Good flavor!

My favorite recipe! I mixed fresh blackberries and blueberries and this received rave reviews. I also brushed egg white on the bottom crust and on top, then sprinkled top with sugar. Next time I won't bake on a heavy cookie sheet...had to cook longer to ensure the bottom crust was done.  This didn't run all over my oven! !! Also added a few tbls butter and a little lemon juice on top before covering with the top crust.

This was my first attempt at a wild berry pie. It thickened up nicely and was surprisingly delicious. I picked 4 cups of black raspberries in my back yard. They might be black berries not sure...either way it was delicious!

I've never made a blackberry pie, but when a friend brought me 2 pounds of fresh blackberries from her family farm, up in Idaho, I couldn't resist. It was a bit tart but we served it with whip cream or ice cream to offset the tartness. I used my favorite pie crust, passed down from my aunt. The filling seemed a bit runny when I poured it into the pie shell, but it set nicely. I placed a cookie sheet underneath the pie while in the oven because it did spill over a bit. I baked it for about ten extra minutes than the recipe suggested, as it wasn't quite golden brown across the top. I also like to put a tin foil edging around the pie to prevent the edges from burning. I remove the foil the last 15 minutes or so.

Don't have pic though, because it was gone within minutes. ;)

Loved it!! I just picked a bunch of wild blueberries this afternoon and went home to make a pie. I was a wee worried the berries would be too sour as they are wild and some weren't perfectly ripe. I looked at recipes but most needed cornstarch. This one didn't - so I picked it. Boy I am glad I did. It was perfect. Not runny. Just right:)

I make this three times a year and it rivals my grandma's apple crumb pie as my favorite! Actually it might be my favorite since I only make grandma's once a year now :) Delicious pie, always turns out! I make it as is, but the recipe is very forgiving. If using frozen berries, thawing them first works best for me, but they can all be thrown together frozen and cook an extra 10-15 or so. Yum!!

It was great I pick my own berries and I was only able to fit the 3 1/2 cups of berries which was fine and the first time it was a little tart so I added another half cup of sugar to the filling and it made it just right.

After reading the reviews I hope I didn't over do it with the milk and sugar on top. I have never done this particular variation before. I picked the blackberries with my grandsons, as my grandmother did with me many moons ago. I have the pot she always used to pick her berries in. If you fill up the pot it will make two blackberry pies. I can't describe what it means to me to bring my grand kids with me to pick berries using the same pot she did. I don't know when this sort of thing started to mean so much to me but it really does make me happy and proud to know how to make blackberry pies the way she did.

To be perfectly honest I am no domestic goddess but this recipe was so simple and easy to follow that I made my first blackberry pie.  It was absolutely delicious and I can wait to make my next one. Was a bit suspicious about why flour was added but realised that this was to thicken the juice :) Brilliant. :)

Tried this with some blackberries we picked from our backyard last week. I used frozen pie shells, added some lemon juice to the top of the berries before I covered them with the crust and brushed some egg on top instead of milk.

My kids loved it. They might just go back and pick some more berries.

Best blackberry pie ever! I made this for my mother in laws birthday and there was also a home made banana cream pie, but it was obvious which pie was favored. I used the butter flakey pie crust recipe from this site, its def the best crust ever. I refuse to make a crust with shortening. anyway, the sugar on top of the crust really makes it amazing! I didnt use the whole quarter cup though. Seemed a little excessive. Thanks for this amazing recipe!

This was a fantastic recipe! We cut down the sugar a little bit and it still tasted great! We followed others suggestions re egg on bottom and no problem w/runniness.  On top, we used egg and no sugar.  We used frozen pie crust on bottom and Brenda's pie crust recipe on top.  We loved it.  Topping is definitely whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

Great recipe and soooo simple. If the berries are sweet you can leave out the sugar completely. I am trying with a few pads of butter to see if adds anything.

Used frozen blackberries. It was OK but not sweet enough for me. Too much excess flour but perhaps that was due to the frozen berries.

I loved it. Very easy and very simple to make. Maybe I added a bit more flour? Second time I used rhubarb and strawberries and it also turned out great.

Solid. Helps if you egg the bottom and butter the top. But the filling is just right.

Great recipe! We used fresh picked blackberries and it turned out wonderful. I would recommend a few modifications (suggested by another user named Carmen): brush the bottom crust with egg to prevent it from getting soggy, add a little lemon juice to the blackberries, and use less milk and sugar on the top crust. Overall, this was a great recipe and I will make it again!

This was a fantastic easy and crowd pleasing recipe!  There are two things though.  Eggs on top work better than milk, and prep only takes 5-10 minutes, not even close to 40.

Loved this pie! It was a bit on the tart side, but that's how I like it. If you like sweeter pie, up the sugar a bit. I used store bought berries, but if you're fortunate enough to have fresh, the recommended half cup sugar will probably be enough. I've baked this pie twice; once with flour, once with tapioca starch. The tapioca starch seems to be better. The flour version gives the filling a more gravy texture.

I don't usually like pie all that much (definitely a cake person). But it was Pi day and so I made this recipe for my fiance. I took people's recommendations about adding a 1/4 cup more sugar, eliminating the milk, dotting with butter, and brushing egg on the bottom and top layers of crust. Absolutely great advice. The pie turned out to be fantastic! The pie actually tasted even better the next day after it had plenty of time to cool and the flavors melded. I guess I have to start saying I love pie too!

This pie is very good! I used frozen berries and added a TBS of chopped cold butter before putting on the top crust and the filling was not runny at all. After brushing some milk on the crust I only sprinkled about 1 1/2 tsp. of sugar on top. I cut the recipe in half and prepared it in a small 4 serving glass pie plate and it was just right for dessert for a couple of night for hubby and I. I also prepared Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust and it was superb.

Excellent, but definitely needs to be cooked longer to thicken up. Cover with tinfoil to prevent burning crust and cook another 35mins.

We have blackberry bushes so I make this pie every year. The recipe 'ingredients' (what goes into the pie) are perfect; right amount of sweetness and consistency is spot on. The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars was 1) I have to brush the bottom of the pie crust with egg white to keep it from getting soggy and 2) the amount of sugar used on top was too much for us. I usually just sprinkle and 'eyeball' it, I'd say no more than 1 1/2T. BUT this pie (with the slight mods) gets rave reviews and is a summer favorite for our family.

Made a few adjustments based on other reviews, and it turned out GREAT!  Not runny at all and just the right amount of sweetness.  May make another — the blackberries along our woods just keep coming!  Thanks!

This was just ok.  I thought it was a little dry and someone else did too at our party.  Maybe I was expecting it to taste like cobbler, but I would have preferred it to be more juicy.  (several people suggested I make cobbler next time)  The blackberries were delicious, however.

This is my first pie baking experience, so I guess it turned out ok. It was not very sweet, even after I added a 1/4 cup of sugar. The seed thing was an issue for me. Perhaps next time I will blend the blackberries and attempt to strain out some of the seeds. I don't know, perhaps I will try frozen, maybe the seeds are softened by the freezing process? I did not use 1/4 cup of sugar on top, just a sprinkle, and replaced the milk with egg.

My family loves pie.  Apple has always been our favorite.  After trying this one, it is now our
most favorite pie.  Everyone I served it to absolutely loved it.  I made it with the recommendations
from the reviews.  I cut down on the sugar and milk on top. It was amazing.  My daughter-in-law
wants it for her birthday every year.

A wonderful recipe. I made a ladice top instead. I used raw sugar cane for the top to give it a more crunchy sugar top. As other reviewers suggested, I used egg (bottom and top) and butter (on top of blackberry mixture) in addition to the recipe.

Wonderful filling recipe! Very simple and yet it tastes great. I suggest adding a little bit of cinnamon (but that's cause my Dad makes it with cinnamon and so it tastes like home with it). Also, if you pair this recipe with the French Pastry Pie Crust recipe, that is also on all-recipes, you end up with a perfect combination!

I absolutely love Blackberry so I was eager to try making a Blackberry pie. This recipe has to be my favorite. Quick and easy. the only thing I didn't really like was that the blackberries were super-sweet instead of nice and tart. That could have just been because of the blackberries. I think next time I won't add quite as much sugar in the filling and see how that works.

My family said that this was the best Blackberry Pie that they had ever eaten. Thanks for the amazing recipe. Very easy to prepare, and absolutely delightful with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. I'm going to get some more fresh blackberries to freeze so we can enjoy this recipe this winter as well. :)

Absolutely delicious!  We're not huge pie people, and I'm an amateur baker at best, but with freshly picked blackberries and a great texture, my whole family couldn't get enough of it!
The crust here worked perfectly with it, and it was SUPER easy to make:

Fantastic! Everyone says, "Wow, that is the best blackberry pie I have ever had!". Yummy and perfect. The crust I made with real butter and flour with ice water. The sprinkle of sugar on top of the crust before baking made the crust taste like a sugar cookie on top. The only thing I would change in this recipe is the amount of sugar, next time I will add just a touch more sugar as it was a bit tart. This will be a recipe I save! Already have.

Very good recipe.  Easy to make. I used fresh picked Blackberries. Next time I will cook the berries down in Corn Syrup or Karo Syrup first.. it would have made a sweeter pie. 4 stars from me, thnx for sharing!

This recipe worked beautifully! And it tasted great. I added just a tiny bit of lemon just to kinda perk things up and balance the sweetness.

My husband made this with blackberries he picked from the neighborhood.  The quarter cup of sugar on top of the pie seemed a bit much.  Overall, a great pie!

My family is a fan of this easy and yummy pie. We also used "the best pie crust" also from all recipes as well! We decided to change it up and make mini pies for our dinner guest and it could'nt of turned out better! With a few modifications as everyone had suggested...sprinkle of lemon juice, egg wash on inside of pie crust before filling in and just a sprinkle of sugar on top of crust...we love it!

There's not a lot of pie recipes that turn out perfectly the first time I try them.  But this one is!  I made this for my husband last night and it was the perfect pie.  It is very easy to do.    My one "suggestion" is to actually prepare 3 1/2 cups with the mixture as this says, but also have at least 1 cup of plain blackberries to add (instead of the recommended 1/2 cup).

This pie is really tasty, but 4 cups really isn't enough to fill a 9 inch deep dish pie. So if you're using a bigger pie dish, make sure to have extra. I used 6 cups and it was just enough. Also, without adding the extra berries the sugar and flour didn't really work to the consistency of "pie filling." Other than that, this recipe is awesome!!

I made this the other day, and it was one of the best fruit pies I've ever made.  I even forgot to put the 1/2 cup of berries on top of the mixture, and it was still fine.  I also used frozen deep dish crusts.  Vanilla ice cream made it heavenly.  I am headed to make it again now, and won't forget the extra berries this time!  We found a patch of berries across the road, and are in blackberry heaven for the moment.  Even a total novice can do fine with this easy pie.

Wonderful pie recipe! I served this to my guests..none of whom particularly like blackberries and they raved about it! I did take the suggestions of previous posters and brushed some egg on the bottom crust. I also squeezed some lemon juice and even grated a little zest ontop of the blackberries - this made a nice difference. The one mistake I did make was to not mix the berries enough with the sugar/flour mixture and it did come out slightly pasty in the filling. This however was my fault so it did not compromise my 5 star rating. Also, I cheated and used a refrigerated prepared pie crust. This was so great -  I can't wait to try it again!

This was my first Blackberry Pie ever, and I love to bake. I tell you...it was the Bomb. I think i ate the whole pie, minus 2 or 3 small slices. I used fresh Blackberries and this is what I believe set it off. The sugar with the tart/sweet balckberries was just right, along with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Can't wait to get some more Blackberries. I will be making several more this summer.

Simple & delicious, dear hubby just made it a second time in 2 days! We just came in from picking 4 gallons of blackberries & he went right to work on the pie without looking at the recipe again. Hubby LOVES blackberry pie and found this recipe before I could even tell him to look on allrecipes.com. He made it just as the recipe stated and let it set one hour before cutting. He usually prefers vanilla ice cream on it, but he ate 1/2 of it before we got ice cream and it was just as delish! The texture was perfect and the overall appearance was lovely. It will be made - and shared - many more times.  PS - hubby is a great cook anyway, so this has been added to his gastronomic arsenal.  THANK YOU!!!

This pie held up well, was not runny at all, but it needed more sugar.  It also needed more flavor, but our wild blackberries must be the source of those faults.

Use mixed berries and the perfect pie crust. Brush the crust with milk and sprinkle with sugar. You can use frozen or frsh or both berries. Let sit for one hour or more after cooking. It comes out perfect!

I have made this pie twice now and each time the top crust (I use Pillsbury premade) cracks and breaks. Otherwise, this is a delicious pie!  It still eats just fine. :-)

Excellent recipe!!! I made this pie yesterday and it was fabulous!! I had trouble rolling out the dough for my top crust so instead of having a solid top crust I used a cookie cutter and pieced together a top crust. It turned out beautiful and very tatsy! :) Also, I used a 10 in. pie plate, added 2 extra cups of fresh blackberries, some extra sugar and 1/2 a lemon's juice. Great recipe :)

I thought this pie was amazing, and so did everyone else that I made it for...I'm actually preparing to make a few of them right now. As suggested by another user, I did the add lemon juice to mix, and 2 tbsp milk brushed on top crust...I DID NOT use egg on crust, I just think it tastes strange that way.

My children picked wild blackberries and my 9 year old daughter made this pie for me for Mother's Day!  It was REALLY good and very simple to make.

I like this recipe very much. The filling does not dry out which I've had issues with in the past.

This recipe is wonderful and simple.  If you have a great crust recipe, you are set!  My guests loved it.  Not too sweet, just right.  Yum!  A great way to use fresh picked blackberries.

I slightly modified this recipe and the pie turned out fabulous. I used fresh blackberries that I had picked the day before I made the pie and only needed to add half the amount of sugar this recipe called for because the berries were so sweet. I added a tablespoon of cornstarch to help thicken up the berry juice and brushed the pie shells with beaten egg. I also squeezed half a lemon over the berry filling and dotted it with butter before adding the top crust. YUM!

I made this pie for thanksgiving. It turned out thick which was a plus . On the downside it was very very tart. Needless to say no one ate it. I gave pieces away to take home to three of the families and told them to maybe add more sugar or either just throw pie away. Very disappointed considering all the excellent reviews.

I made this recipe with blackberries from my grandmas garden and it was delicious!! I added a little flour on the bottom of the pie crust to soak up some of the juices and a little more sugar in the berries.

This recipe was extremely easy to use and made a great fresh fruit pie.  I didn't have quite enough fresh blackberries though so I added 3 sliced peaches and reduced the sugar by about 2 tablespoons.  I also used turbinado sugar instead of white sugar because I prefer the taste.  The bigger granules of sugar made the top crust extra crunchy too, a plus in my book.

Incredibly tasty and very simple.  We added 1/4 cup sugar to the filling as suggested by other reviewers and it still had a wonderful sweet/tart balance.   Thanks Michelle!

This pie was truly simple. By itself I thought it tasted a little floury but with vanilla ice cream it was perfect!

Well, probably usually this deserves a five, but I used fresh, early season blackberries which tend to be pretty sour.  The consistency of the pie turned out great, and nothing about the blackberry flavor was removed or masked.  Some of the boys, however, thought it was too sour.  I'd definitely keep trying with this one but udjust the sugar if the blackberries are sour.

This is the second time I have used this "fabulous" recipe. My husband and son eat it all in one sitting, just like there is no time for ice cream!!! 
This pie is simply amazing! 
Thank you from Oregon!
