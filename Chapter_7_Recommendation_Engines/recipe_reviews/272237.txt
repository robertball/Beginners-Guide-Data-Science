I love cheese but as written this was way too thick in my opinion. I ended up having to add some liquid to get all of the cheese to melt, Liquid of choice was a generous splash of brine from a jar of pickled jalapenos. Overall a good recipe but plan on adding some liquid for a more dippable type consistency.
