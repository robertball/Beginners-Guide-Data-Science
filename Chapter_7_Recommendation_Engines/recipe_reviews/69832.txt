Where is the salted water?  Skip the baking soda, add another tsp or 2 of baking powder.  No need to keep kneading it..just mix it all together until soft/doughy but still holding it's shape.  I roll my smaller (hand sized) football shaped knedlick in a little flour just barely and then throw into boiling SALTED water..I don't cover it, just let it cook for 25 minutes poking with a fork and rolling about 3-4 times while cooking.  Remove and slice with knedlicky cutter from czech, or let cool and cut with bread knife into bread width pieces.  Don't complicate simple recipe...mix-boil and be done!

Well, I'm Czech too but never heard of wrapping the dough in a cloth! Basically, same ingredients but fold in the bread cubes, form into small loaves, flouring your hands. Let sit for a few minutes until water boils.  Gently lower into water, put cover on pot but leave it slightly askew to vent and gently simmer for 20 minutes. Remove, slice.

Sauerkraut: rinse can of sauerkraut; put into saucepan and add enough water to almost cover sauerkraut. Cook for 20 minutes or so. In small skillet, brown butter, add flour to make a roux and add that to the saucepan with the sauerkraut. That should do it!

I can finally make my grandmother's dumplings!  I followed another reviewer's advice, and left out the baking soda.  I also only used 2 eggs.  My grandmother always shaped her dumplings using her wet hands, so that's what I did and it worked out perfectly.  As for the sauerkraut, I did my grandmother's.  She always made hers with caraway seeds, chopped onions and brown sugar, so that's what I did.  Made a pork roast in the slow cooker with the zeli and I had a childhood dinner I begged for!  I don't have a dumpling slicer (but my grandmother is giving me hers), so I used thread to slice them.  The leftover dumplings were cubed and I made another childhood favourite....egg dumplings.  They were perfect!

This is a wonderful recipe I am 100% Czechoslovakian and it was only once a year on my birthday that I would get pork roast and dumplings for my b-day dinner. My mom would never take the time to give me the recipe. Once I found this recipe, I was in HEAVEN. In my opinion, I have perfected this recipe and I can make my dumplings in less than one hour. As far as this recipe goes, I use everything up to the breadcrumbs. As for the milk, I keep that to a minimum as well as the breadcrumbs. I do stir all of the ingredients as directed however; I use judgment with the milk as to not make it too moist of a batter. The breadcrumbs are added last. I have found that too many breadcrumbs create air pockets for water to enter when boiling. Once my dough is mixed, I will use "Wondra Gravy Flour" to roll them to their desired shape. Almost as though you would flour a cutting board for bread dough. (I just use the Wondra flour.) The dough yields enough to make two good size rolls, about what a muffin size would be. I then boil my water to a strong rolling boil. Drop in my dumplings and then boil for approximately 20 min. constantly rolling and turning.

What a treat to find this recipe!  Both of my grandmothers and my own mother passed away before I became interested in cooking and I have always regretted not learning this traditional meal.  Thank you Sonya, for the detailed instructions (it brought back so many memories).  Unfortunately, my dumplings were not quite as light and fluffy as Babicka's (grandmother's) but this does take some practice.  I'm sure it had nothing to do with the recipe and instructions.  I may have over-kneaded and possibly cooked them just a little too long but they were still very delicious.  I would like to add one valuable tip I found on another site (however, the instructions and ingredients on that site left alot to be desired)...rather than cutting with a knife which can compress the dumplings, use a long piece of dental floss to cut them into slices for serving.  It leaves them virtually in their true form and allows the steam to escape so that they don't turn out too  hard.  This is the only advice I can offer.  Sonya, dekuji mockrat (many thanks) for this recipe!!

Please be sure that the bread cubes have been dried out. They should be hard. Sauteed onions should also be added to the sauerkraut.

This is almost exactly like my grandmother used to make it, with the exception that she dropped individual "blobs" of dumpling dough into the water. This is how my family continues to make it. Then we serve it with pork roast and sauerkraut.

This was the best knedlik i have ever made (so far I was consistently failing at it to the point of giving up). I had Czech hruba and polohruba flours at home, so I have used these. i only had 2 cups of hruba, so used 2 of that and 1 cup of polohruba. I did not have any baking powder at home, so i have used an extra tsp of baking soda instead and this worked fine. I have only used 2 eggs which was enough. I have used less bread (only one bread slice, cubed (toasted it on the lightest setting and left if air dry for a while whilst cooking other things and kneading the dough). I did not bother beating the eggs beforehand, just popped them in. I used smaller amount of milk first, about a cup, then got stuck in with my hands, did not bother with a spoon. I added a little more milk as i worked it, just enough for it not to be too dry, but not too much, so that it holds firm shape. I followed the advices of 200 strokes, but instead knead it 200x times by hand, until the dough was elastic (sprung back when depressed) and did not stick to my hands anymore. Then I wored the bread cubes in and decided to divide the dough into 2 knedliky, which was a good decision as it fit in the pot better. Bear in mind the knedlik will rise as it cooks to 1.5-2 times its raw size. I did not bother cooking it in a cloth, just popped them in salty boiling water. I took them out after 20 mintutes, cutting them in half with a thread and found the center still raw, so popped them in for another 10 minutes

I thought it is too many eggs, because Knedla came out really yellow and kind of eggy. But otherwise it was very nice, and my husband loved it.
I usually make knedlily with yeasted dough, but this recipe is good and quick when I don't have time to let the dough rise. My hubbie is Slovak and the Slovak version of knedla does not have bread cubes in it but I liked this Czech version also!

I was very happy to find this recipe.  The directions are well writtten.I made it and they turned out just like my grandmother and mother made.  It was part of our regular Sunday dinner as I was growing up.  Sometimes we served it with duck and on Christmas it was with goose.

I make my Babi's (grandmothers) recipe but its with YEAST instead of baking powder. The baking powder does work, but makes for a much more dense Knedliky and its 10X faster because the yeast version you need to let it rise twice.  My Babi and I also use caraway seeded rye bread instead of white bread to give it the authentic flavor. In a pinch you do not need a dumpling cutter but can use unwaxed dental floss. There is no need for cheese cloth and my Babi probably because we use Yeast instead of baking powder always said never lift the lid on the pan while cooking. The rolling boil will roll the dough around the pan. When tiny bubbles are all around the sides of the lid, that is when they are done.  
The kraut.. I prefer mine sour  and do not like to add the white or brown sugar. I prefer just adding chopped and sauted onion and caraway to the jarred kraut .

How about a THANK YOU to the author of the recipe and trying some constructive criticism?  Anyway these came out PERFECT! I only used 2 eggs and doubled the baking power and left out the soda. Also used day old wheat bread. My bf is from Czech Republic and he has a lot of trouble getting his dumplings to stick together ( something about " hard flour" that you can't get in the US). So I did use the cheese cloth and it made them so perfect! *** PLEASE NOTE**** that these are Czech, Eastern European style dumplings. NOT the kind of dumplings we are familiar with here in the US. When my Czech native bf introduced them to me I thought they were strange and unusual but they grew on me and are quite tasty.

This was so good!  I was nervous because the bread seemed difficult in my mind- but was not, very easy and super tasty!  I made it with the Czech Roast Pork (Sonya) submitted here - and a super Czech Dinner!  Thanks for sharing :)

I was a bit intimidated as I have never made dumplings before, but I followed the directions, and my girlfriend (from Prague) was very impressed that I made this along with the pork, and Pilsner Urquell.  Looks like it may be time to set "the" date!

I only used 2 eggs as suggested. I tried to use bread cubes but they never mixed, so I remade the recipe and used bread crumbs. The bread mixed up better that way. I used the cloth because I was afraid the dough would just run everywhere, but don't tie the cloth too tightly otherwise it will spill out and not cook properly. I used salted water, covered the pot. I split the dough into two loaves as suggested also. I cooked them for 40 min, turned them over halfway, and they were overcooked. Would shoot for 30 min or less.

Made this tonight with the Czech Roast Pork for New Year's Day dinner. It was good. When trying to find the name of the pork dish, I came across that recipe PLUS this one on Epicurious. Difference was to cook the dumpling for 45 minutes and rest for 10. No wonder my dumpling was raw in the middle :(  But the outer dumpling plus pork gravy was  delicious. And the sauerkraut - yum! Homage to my Grandfather! Made with pride!!

I am Czech and find the best way to slice dumplings is with a piece of sawing cotton straight after they are cooked. That way they don't need to cool and they don't get squashed.

The fact the dumplings were inedible was probably all my fault. I dried out the bread cubes in the oven, rendering them hard as rocks. I think 4 cups is too much for the balance of batter, as well, and the whole thing was a lumpy, wet mess once done. I will try again. This time I'm drying bread slices on the counter for when I get home. I'm going to be prudent with the milk, too. We'll see what happens! I hope they turn out, because I spent the better part of a day making svickova, and you can't eat that without dumplings!

I made this recipe as directed and loved it!  I will probably add slightly less bread cubes next time.  Cooking the leftovers as you would French toast is the best way to extend the pleasure of this old world treasure.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Have been making this for years. However, I learned from my Bohemian grandmother to fry the bread cubes in a bit of the bacon grease. ( don't saturate it, only flavor it)!  I also just plop mine in boiling salted water. My kids like some melted butter and additional caraway seeds sprinkled on top. I use jarred kraut which I drain. I brown an onion with some brown sugar and then add the drained kraut. Served with a roasted pork, it makes a great Sunday dinner!

I grew up on this dish. My grandma would make it for every special occasion when I was a kid. Apparently my great great grandma made dumplings every day- what a beast of a woman. Her arms must have been the size of tree trunks. 
My family's recipe is just flour, milk, salt, stale bread, and a few eggs. You pour as much milk as you want dumplings and then add flour until the dough becomes agony to mix. Beat air into the dough until the dough is shiny and your arm has fallen off. Instead of loaves, we cut big dumplings out of the dough and let those suckers float in boiling water. (we slice them later). 
I followed a mix of this recipe and my family's and made mine lactose free and whole wheat. They came out great. I'm eating the worlds best breakfast right now. Fried dumplings and eggs. So good! You can't make dumplings and not have this the next day.

This is a very easy, very good recipe. I have tried 6 recipes for knedlik to little success but this one had all my dinner guests raving and was also liked by my partner whom is also Czech.

I followed the recipe exactly (except halved quantity and adjusted cooking time in accordance) and was horrified when it came time to serve this.  The dumpling was an ugly greyish & yellow colour.  My husband called it a hockey puck when I served this with the Roast Pork and sauerkraut. Please take my advice and find another dumpling recipe. I gave the star for the sauerkraut.
