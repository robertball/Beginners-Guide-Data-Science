I thought this chicken was just ok. I did add some bay leaves and ground oregano. Not sure what went wrong but I probably won't make this again. Sorry.

I made it exactly as the recipe said and it was good. I'm not a  that modifies the recipe the first time around and rates it low because it didn't turn out as I wanted. A few spices and additions the second and third time made it better for us. 

Quick, easy, and things normally kept on hand makes this a keeper!

Delicious!! I used homemade chipotle in adobe sauce. We like spicy, so, blazing hot was just fine with the adults, for the kids we used more tomatoes than chipotles. This freezes well too. Thank you for the recipe.
