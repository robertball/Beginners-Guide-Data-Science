I made this for my vegetarian daughter and was surprised when the whole family helped themselves, not realizing it was a meatless dish.  After eating one each we decided we would like the tortilla a little crisper and threw them under the broiler for a few minutes.  They were delicious.  I made a few minor changes due to the ingredients I had on hand - dried cilantro, medium cheddar and whole wheat wraps.  This will be in our regular rotation - finally a dish everyone likes - and it was so quick and easy too! Update:  We make this dish often, but to make it even healthier we substitute brown rice for the tater tots.

I love this recipe!  My husband didn't even notice there was no beef.  I've made this recipe with rice instead of potatoes and it's still great, especially with Ready Rice it's really easy.  FINAL TWEAKS: a few handfuls of frozen tator tots, ro-tel instead of tomatoes, 1C salsa, same cheese, sour cream & seasonings.  Combine and burrito-roll into six 10" tortillas, line in 9x13 dish, bake UNCOVERED til light brown & crispy.  Reheat in oven: 450 uncovered; reheat in microwave: cut in half, 2 minutes on high.

We love this recipe.  I have made it three times since I downloaded the recipe in october.  For some reason, and people didn't seem to mention this in other reviews, but it was very spicy--too spicy, for me the first time.  I don't know I'm a pansy or if I missed something, but it was too hot.  So I cut the picante sauce in half the second time and it was much easier to manage (and delicious).

It rocked, just ROCKED.  I just bought the potato patties from market day, so they were on hand for my "meatless" lunch.  I scaled the recipe to 1 (for my lunch today) and only used 1 patty.  I topped with enchilada sauce & sour cream.  Thanks so much DeeDee!

I've made these several times, but only last night did I follow the recipe closely enough to rate it. These are wonderful! I used a little more cilantro, some cumin, and a lot of red pepper flakes. Turned out great - thank you for the recipe!

Really good!  I didn't have tomotoes, so I used salsa.  Only change I would make next time would be to bake the tater tots first - they tasted a little too firm, which together with the firmness of the beans, was a little much.  The mix of flavors was great!

Even the non-vegetarians in my family enjoyed this! I didn't change a thing, other than substituting the frozen potato rounds for canned due to what we had on hand, and they turned out great. Will definitely be making this again.

This was so good.  I made them a little bigger, more burrito like and added more cheese to the top during the final baking.  It's just the two of us so we had leftovers and ate them three nights in a row!  Oh, I also sliced a little avocado on the side.  We love anything Mexican and this is definitely a keeper in our house.  Thanks for sharing!

I am the "tuesday" cook at my home and sometimes my efforts feed the dogs, but this is a great dish!  Even my meat& potatoes son in law even enjoyed it.  Easy to make and very tasty. My only problem was that the tortilla seemed to get a bit hard at places.  Got any more DeeDee?

i cant bring myself to eat the frozen, store version of Taquitos, so i am glad to find this recipe. i didnt know what frozen potato rounds were, but i just used the idea from this recipe. i had leftover rice that i added beans, salsa, and cheese to. (i even diced steamed carrots that i had and hid them in there, too) i rolled them up and baked them. the tortillas started to burn but the char actually tasted good :) i think anything with cheese and salsa will taste good in these crunchy wraps! this idea helped me get by using leftovers. shhh! they don't know!

I didn't have frozen potatoes on hand, so i made my own shredded potatoes using 3 small russet potatoes.  Peel them, shred them with a grater, and mix with 2T flour, seasoned salt, chili powder, and about 1/4 c melted butter.  Grease aluminum foil placed on a baking sheet.  Spread out the potatoes and cook them on 385 for about 45 min, or until crisp.  I made something similiar without the potatoes, and they tasted basically the same, just more filling this way.  I also boiled a chicken breast and shredded it.  Sometimes i add thawed spinach and corn to the mix.  I also only bake these at 350 for 30 min, this way you don't have to cover and they crisp up just fine.  Good healthy version of a chimichanga type burrito!

I made these for a party I had at my house, I used burrito sized tortillas and i cut them into pieces. They were a huge hit, everyone loved them, espically my VEG friends. I made 12 big ones, and there were none left. I will definately be making these again!!

Nothing spectacular but good.  Rather bland even though I followed other reviewer's suggestions and added more seasonings including a ton of cumin.  I had to eat them with more salsa to really enjoy them.  Don't think I'll make them again.

This recipe is okay as written...kind of bland.  However, I added a can of diced green chiles, some cumin powder, some chili powder, and some fresh chopped jalepenos.  Then, they tasted a lot better.  I also used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, since that was all I had.  Overall, it was good and I would make again with the modifications.

Made half a recipe last night and left out the potato rounds.  Instead used a whole can of beans.  Used both whole wheat and flour tortillas and the flour ones browned much better.  Served with Amy's cilantro cream sauce (excellent!).  Without the cream sauce on the side, the cigars would have been too bland for our tastes.  Great concept, but lacking a bit of flavor for our tastes.   Definitely will change seasonings the next time, but the concept and basic filling is spot on and very easy to modify for your family's tastes.

Very good, but one word of advice, don't try to make this with whole wheat tortillas. They don't fluff up like flour ones, and instead get hard and icky.

I used rotel instead of a tomato. Think next time I will try adding some corn. They were good and tasty. I had a good bit of the mixture leftover.

I needed a healthy, but super easy recipe my husband could cook, since I wasn't going to be home in time.  Even he couldn't screw this up.  These will be a regular staple in our house!  All 4 kids loved them and all 12 burritos were devoured in minutes!!  Very yummy recipe!  Thank you

These are very good.  My entire family, including my 7 year old, loved these.  I am not sure if I rolled these correctly or not, but I had quite a bit of filling leftover.  We will be eating these again.

I was skeptical at first (being used to authentic Mexican food), but these were really delicious!  We used habanero cheddar cheese to spice things up and also included 4 tablespoons of Tapatio hot sauce instead of"picante sauce".

The flavor is awesome.Very easy to make.I did cook the tots first and then kind of mashed them up so they were evenly spread in the mix.I also did not add the cayenne pepper.My picky two year old couldn't get enough of these.The only thing I didn't like was how brown and kind of crispy they got on the bottom.Next time I will do at a lower heat and try flipping them more.

My family loved this! My husband has to watch his fat intake so I cut the cheese in half used lofat sour cream. I'm sure it would be good the original way also but it didn't hurt the taste any to cut the fat down.

I didn't care for the bland flavoring of the potato rounds used in this recipe.  I would use brown rice if I ever make this again.

Exceptional -- these were gone in a flash and even my youngest, the pickiest eater in the world, ate one.  A five-star recipe for sure!

Loved this recipe! The only thing I did differently was increase the spices, but that is matter of personal taste ( I like my food very spicy).  Thanks for a unique idea, I never would have thought to use taters and black beans this way!

These were pretty good overall.  I left out the cayenne due to my kids.  Everything else I did the same.  I loved the cilantro.  It reminded me of a baked chimichanga.  I think next time I'll melt cheddar cheese over the top before serving.  Mmm.. a little grilled steak might be good too.  Good recipe.

I was a little worried that I wouldn't actually like these, but boy was I wrong.  They are absolutely delicious.  The blend of flavors is perfect.  I think the potato adds just the right amount of "meatiness" to these.  My husband didn't even mind that they were vegetarian, which is a far stretch for him.  I topped them with a little sour cream and green onions.  Perfect!  Thanks for the recipe imdd!

I had high hopes for these since I really love burritos and the recipe sounded good. Tried them on Friday nightt, and while they were decent, I was not super impressed by them. The taste was sort of blah, not sure if it was because I used fat free sour cream or because I omitted the cilantro (didn't have any on hand). I used thawed frozen hashbrowns instead of potato rounds, and I liked the texture, but still, the taste was kind of plain. I might try them again and maybe use refried beans instead of black and add some more spices.

WONDERFUL!!!!!!!! This was one of my first attempts at a veggie meal (I made it about 6 weeks ago!)and the husband and kiddo RAVED!! Although I cut the recipe by half, there was still too much for the three of us, so I opted to freeze half the filling to use later. When unexpected guests popped up today, I was able to 'WOW' them with the leftovers!! Thanks!!

This had potential, but needed something. Next time I'll try substituting pepperjack cheese, a can of rotel insted of the picante, add a pkg. of taco seasoning, and enchilada sauce on top. I also thought it would be good with more tater tots.

Made it with real potatoes instead of tater tots (not a big fan) and it was a hit.  Will make again and again.  Will try some of the other suggestions here too, just for variety.

Just found out from boyfriend, these make excellent lunches.  they held up very well, keeping both taste and moisture.

This recipe was good, not the best burrito I ever had, but I will make it again. I used rice instead of potatoes and pinto beans instead of black. I served with a great "Guacamole" recipe I found on this website.

Made a few changes: used rice instead of potatoes, and added diced chiles and cumin because didn't have any chili or cayenne pepper, had to used mozarella. I thought these were great and will be even better when I make them closer to the recipe. And, if some people like it spicier than others, you can alter the heat in each individual burrito when you fill them.

Quick, easy, healthy and good.  Love black bean burritos, and these are about as simple as they get.  I've used leftover mashed potatoes as well as brown rice in place of the potato rounds with good results (these are also good sans spuds, and healthier to boot).  I almost always add in a can of corn as well as some cumin and green chiles for some added kick.  Perfect and crispy and even makes a multi grain tortilla taste good.  Thanks!

This is pretty good.  A couple of changes I would make are: use just 1/2 can of black beans (refried beans would be good, too, I would think), and add more hot sauce, believe it or not.  I thought from the ingredients that it would be very, very spicy, but it was between mild and medium.  I personally like my food to have a little more of a kick to it.  That said, it was good as is.

An interesting twist on boring old burritos. I used low fat sour cream and added diced chilis, and toasted the tater-tots before adding, and they were perfect paired with a cup of potato corn chowder (also from this site). They microwaved surprisingly well the next day too--still crispy! Thanks for the fun recipe!

Really good and simple to make.  I used larger tortillas and stuffed them completely so it made 4 of those.  Only made 2 the first night, refrigerated the rest and made it again the next night and it's just as good.

Absolutely delicious! Followed recipe except microwaved tater tots a minute or two to prewarm
Potatoes. The tortillas crisped up really nicely. The fresh tomatoes and cilantro really added a nice brightness. Will definitely make again!

I have to say, i HATE black beans BUT I loved them in this recipe!  Soooo yummy!  I used great value seasoned black beans and followed the recipe.  It was a hit with the entire family!  I will have this again...have added it to my list for Lenten Fridays.  I liked the smoke trick, too :)

We have this every few weeks.  It's a great recipe!  We don't have potato rounds here in the UK, but I use frozen hash browns instead -- thawed and crumbled up.  Works perfectly!

We thought it was pretty good.  I used about half of a standard can of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh tomato (didn't have one on hand) and I think I may reduce the sour cream next time to 1/2-3/4 cup and increase the potato rounds a bit.  I also rough chopped the rounds instead of mashing.  I couldn't fit 12 in the pan, so I had quite a bit of filling left over.  I put it in a small pyrex dish and baked it along with the "cigars" -- it makes a wonderful dip for chips and veggies! My girls liked them and I'll make them again.  I like the idea of putting the dish under the broiler for a few minutes at the end, as well as the idea to add some corn.

Her husband is right.  She is a genius!  I make this often, and my family loves it.  The only caution is make sure you do not follow the baking instructions, or you'll burn the burritos.  I baked mine on 375 covered for 20 min.  Then I turned the oven off, uncovered them, and let them sit in the oven about 10 min.  They turned out with just enough crispiness that way.  I also leave out the chili and cayenne pepper since I don't like a lot of spice.  It's great served with guacamole.

I made this the other night but I didn't have the frozen tater tots so I substituted rice and ground beef. Everyone loved them...they are so easy to make and very addictive :)  They would be a great party food!  (I just had to try the smoke thing...it works!!!) haha

These are really good. I didn't have any potatoes and only dried cilantro once, but they were still awesome. I also made them with shredded zucchini and black beans with the rest of the toppings the same and they were still delish! This is a  great basic recipe to get creative with. I raised the oven temp to 425* for the last 10 minutes and baked them a little longer than the recipe called for. They are kid friendly and easy. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good.  Made a few changes: substituted one can Rotel diced tomatoes and chiles instead of chopped tomato and chili powder, one small yellow onion chopped, and added 1 c. whole kernel corn. Used dry beans that I soaked in hot water per pkg directions (cheaper).  Covered w/can of enchilada sauce and grated mexican blend cheese for last 10 minutes of baking.  Great meatless source of protein.

Great for a meatless dish, though not much flavor. I did forget the chili powder and cayenne, so that may be the reason for it.  Kids liked it, that's what's most important.
