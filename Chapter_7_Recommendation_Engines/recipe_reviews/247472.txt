I liked it a lot - it needed salt, but that's about it.  Details:  I used a frozen pie crust instead of doing the puff pastry thing - it seemed easier.  (I did prebake it) the filling was really good - I might add some hot sauce or something next time.  the veggies were kind of hard to slice - using a vegetable peeler was a little difficult, but it came out OK -- I used zucchini, summer squash, and carrots.  It really was very pretty!  I baked it for about 10 extra minutes.  You need to let it cool for a while before you eat it or the inside is all gooey - it won't come out in a slice.  I will make this again.

ETA:  I've made this a couple times now, experimenting each time - most recent change is to sautee some onions and stir them into the cheese mixture .  very good!

Me and a few friends really enjoyed this dish. And it's pretty so that's a bonus. Took others advice and added a fair amount of salt, pepper, cayenne, more than just a sprig of thyme, and added a bundle (4-5) green onions into the cheese mix. Served with some caramelized onions to top. I don't own a microwave so steamed my carrots and zucchini for about 4-5 minutes until rollable.

Very good.  Made for Xmas and am making again a few days later. Used gluten free frozen pie crust rather than puff pastry for base.  Wonderful!

Tip:  Steam, rather than microwave the veggies.  Much softer and easier to shape.  

Tasty, pretty and easy--perfect!

very tasty!  I also like this crustless and add a LITTLE onion and spinach.  Season with salt, blk pepper and cayenne pepper. I used thin slice blade on mandolin and microwaved 90 sec. ( I have a very powerful microwave.)

I put lemon zest in the cheese filling and I really liked that touch. I thought my veggies were sliced thin, but they we not at all. I wish the recipe would have said which setting to use on the mandoline. I couldn't roll the veggies so I had to modify by wrapping the veggies around the perimeter, working my way inward. They were still too crunchy after baking for 40 mins plus the 4 mins in the microwave, because of the thickness. Wish I could upload a picture. Next time, I will slice my veg on the thinnest setting on the mandoline. Other than that, the flavor was awesome!! I was very pleased overall with this recipe.

The tart was cute and yummy! Based on that I would make it again in a heart beat. But unfortunately the recipe was a struggle for me. How much exactly is a pinch of nutmeg, and how can a salt to taste if the recipe has eggs in it? So, until it was done baking I was just hoping the seasonings were all right.  I also had a hard time making the roses. I couldn't get my veggie strips tender enough to role tight roses. What I ended up with was still cute, but not exactly what I was hoping for. That all said, I'm a sucker or beautiful things, so I would probably make it again. I would just try a few this differently next time.

Definitely a keeper. The purple carrots bled into the ricotta, so next time might surround the purple with one layer of white carrot. I thought it was surprisingly easy and quicker to make than I thought it would be. Everyone loved it and thought it very special, even my sister who does not typically like ricotta. I think it is essential to use the puff pastry.

I found this to be pretty disappointing.  I did not care for the texture the ricotta gave this and the carrot flowers were just too time consuming.

We have a bridal shower coming up.  Tried this recipe to prepare for it. We didn't like the texture or flavor.  I tried adding the additional spices others recommended but none of us liked it.

Although this dish was very time-consuming, it turned out beautifully and was well worth the effort IMO.  I used zucchini, yellow squash and large orange carrots for the flowers.  The only significant modification was my use of a store-bought pie crust instead of the puff pastry and it was completely delicious!  I would definitely make it again.

It came out too salty (perhaps because I used fresh parmesan and added a little salt based on all the other reviews). Also I microwaved the veggies for longer than it called for but they still came out too hard. Finally, my cheese mixture was too solid and the rosettes did not sit in properly. It ended up being a ton of work for something that looked nice, but didn't taste good. I wouldn't make it again.

Very difficult to get the vegetables to curl enough, and the carrots were still hard after following the directions to the letter.

I would definitely make this again! It was pretty simple, and really good. 

The minor changes I made were that I didn't use nutmeg, and I added a little bit of garlic and fresh cracked pepper.   I also didn't use the full amount of vegetables, because I didn't realize how long it would take me to make the roses and I ran out of time.
