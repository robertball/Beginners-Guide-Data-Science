I enjoyed this recipe.  Unfortunately, my husband Frank, thought that there was too much brocoli to his liking.  The dressing was easy and very tasty.  I will use this recipe again without so much brocoli (men are such babies!)

This took a lot of time to chop up but ended up being a big hit at the potluck.  It was the only thing that was eaten up completly.  I used less dressing.  Very colorful!

This is a wonderful and simple recipe.  I made it for a family gathering on a very hot day.  I made it a half hour ahead and chilled it.  What a hit it was!!  My mom was impressed and that never happens.

This was great. I didn't have any red peppers so I omitted. Quick and easy. Used bagged veggies. Couldn't believe how quick it came together. And how good. Will make many more times.

A little bland.  I did add some coarsely chopped walnuts, which didnt hurt.

Very good salad.   I left out the mushrooms because of an allergy and used plain non-fat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream for extra nutrition and even less fat.

Made this for my work potluck day and was overwhelmed by requests. Stick to using Romaine lettuce it holds the sour cream dressing the best.

Very good! I used plain yogurt and omitted the raw onion. I only had green pepper on hand, so I used that instead of red. Thanks :)

It was good, but the sour cream overwhelms it. It has potential to become a variation on the classic Caesar. Next time I will add croutons and Parmesan cheese to give it more taste.

Refreshing!  I made this with the Meaty Spaghetti Sauce recipe from this site and was very happy with this recipe.  Very easy to make and tasted wonderful. My husband and grandchildren loved it. Nice cool salad.

I made the salad Christmas Eve.  Preparation was quick & easy since I  bought fresh vegetables all ready chopped.    
Lettuce seemed limp the bext day. But I may not of had lettuce dry enough.  I will try making the salad again but will use a salad spinner and won't add dressing till ready to eat. 
Salad made a beautiful presentation and I received many compliments.

Very easy to make. Great to serve as a light side dish. I would make again and may add pine nuts as one viewer tried.

Overall this was very colorful, nutritious, good and different.  Don't know if my onion was extra potent (and I love onions) but that sort of overwhelmed it, maybe next time will use chopped green onions and a bit of minced garlic.  : )
