I cannot resist making a comment here. Chef John did a great job presenting this recipe, however,  I have to laugh when I read reviews of folks who consider themselves "pro's" and obviously have no concept of the basic "mother sauces" and what goes into them and what they are used for.  This recipe is (except for the thyme and cayenne) a very basic Bechamel or White Sauce - I learned this way back in 8th grade home economics class many decades ago and, yes, it does and should have nutmeg in it.  You don't just make this and dump it over food and expect that to be it.  You must adjust it - add cheddar cheese for a cheese sauce a 'la Mac and Cheese.  Add Gruyere and Parmesan to make a Mornay Sauce - great over veggies and even pasta - also used in a Kentucky Hot Brown.  There are 4 other Mother or basic sauces in French Cuisine which are the basis of almost all sauces - think Hollandaise (if you've had a yummy plate of Eggs Benedict you've had Hollandaise (a mother sauce) - it's the technique used to make mayonnaise.  This is such a basic sauce and can be made thinner or thicker depending on what you want to use it for - just use equal amounts of butter and flour to milk with a dash of nutmeg which enhances the taste of the sauce.  More flour and butter equals a thicker sauce.  Easy.

I skipped the thyme in this recipe. I browned some chopped onion and fresh minced garlic in the butter before adding the flour. After the sauce was made, I added some ground mustard and a touch of hot sauce. I used the white sauce as a base for homemade macaroni and cheese. It worked out great--perfect thickness and held up well during the whole cooking process.

This is a BASIC sauce.  Add whatever spices will complement whatever you're going to use it on.  Important:  you want to cook the butter/four mix at a temp that will cook the flour without burning the butter.  Usually when I get lumps, it's because I didn't cook the flour long enough.  I like to make this with whole wheat flour, if you don't mind a brown "white" sauce with speckles. :)

For a basic, more versatile white sauce, omit the nutmeg and thyme.  (Actually, I’m not sure I’d like that combination.   For my tastes it would be either/or) For a thinner white sauce, use 1 T. each of flour and butter. For a thick sauce, 3 T. each of flour and butter.

I consider myself a pretty good cook, but I had some trouble with this sauce. It took me over half an hour to be able to come up with something good because it was very bland. I ended up adding 2 chicken bullion cubes, basil, and oregano. I also had to whisk the sauce for a good ten minutes for it to thicken up without clumps. Maybe this sauce is supposed to be a base that you modify yourself, but that should be specified. **However, after I added everything I did, this sauce came out terrific and tasted very good over baked chicken.

Thank you so much!  I had a basic recipe for white sauce and lost it and couldn't find a good one to replace it.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  I did add some chopped onion and garlic to the butter and skipped the cayenne since I don't care much for spicy hot food.  It turned out perfectly. I can't wait to experiment with other added ingredients and can see several possibilities!

This was absolutely awesome! I made a vegetarian lasagna but didn't really like the sauce that was with that recipe. So, I went looking for something with a bit more flavor. I found this!! It is really good... it made a bit more than I was expecting so the lasagna was a little overflowing but very flavorful. I don't typically measure spices, so I just dashed until it suited our taste. My husband loved it and he's not a fan of white sauce - and he's a meat-eater so it was high praise - for both the sauce and the lasagna! Thank you Chef John!!

It is a very nice white sauce. I used it as the base sauce to make it into the mac N cheese recipe that chef John made with the no-bake topping.  It was really a gourmet mac in my book.

Yummy, of course it's a basic sauce that you add your own spin to for whatever dish you're making.  With the 4th cup of milk I added 1/2-1 tsp. salt to taste, 1/4 tsp pepper, 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/8 tsp. nutmeg, 1/2 tsp. minced garlic, 1 tsp. oregeno, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, and 1/3 cup of fresh parm. cheese.   Yummy!

Thank you Chef John! Perfect sauce. I learned this at my mother's side at age 5. Growing up we had no Nutmeg but I had on hand today and am glad I added it.  Skipped Thyme and added fresh dill  instead (any excuse for Dill-I'm there!) as I was serving  fresh Atlantic Cod.  Served with colorful vegetables and fresh salad.

I remembered the "equal parts butter and flour" but couldn't remember how much milk. I halved the recipe and added chipped beef for a quick cheap supper. 
Thank you, Chef John!

Ok I didn’t like the nutmeg and thyme together much so I added a garlic herbal blend-for taste on vegan meatballs and wheat spaghetti-that’s my variation since I made everything using plant based butter as well as plant based milk-I like my added spices-maybe this probably tastes better using cows butter and milk with chicken. I was looking for a basic white sauce recipe-I like that it was simple to make!

This is a great basic white sauce. Made new peas and new potatoes, tweaked it to enhance the flavors, fresh parsley, garlic and scallion.  Yummy!

I didn't have thyme, so there was none of that.  I sauteed minced onion and chopped mushrooms, and added them when the sauce was completed, and they gave a wonderful flavor.  The nutmeg was noticeable and a definite asset to the sauce.  This basic sauce leaves itself open to many alterations.  It has become a staple of my cooking.

This is a great, basic sauce! I followed the recipe up until the cayenne pepper, thyme, and nutmeg. Instead of adding those, I replaced them with 2 cloves of fresh garlic (minced) and maybe 1/2 teaspoon or so of dried oregano (I didn't really measure it :-)). I used this recipe to top some pasta and grilled chicken marinated with a simple Italian marinade -- absolutely delicious!! Also, I have used this recipe with the chicken, pasta, and also small bits of steamed broccoli. Thanks for a great recipe, Chef John!
