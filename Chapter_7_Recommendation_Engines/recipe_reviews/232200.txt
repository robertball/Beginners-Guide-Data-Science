Flawless Roasted Vegetables' Haiku: "Stirred mine more often. Added red potatoes too. Did for 30 min." I used all same vegetables, but started out w/ just red potatoes in the oven for the first 15 min., added the others, and stirred on occasion so that I'd get some nice, even brown spots b/c brown spots taste better on everything! Great way to make a colorful side dish, and it complimented a pork tenderloin that I roasted alongside it. Oh, and I didn't use any lemon juice til leftovers the next day, where, to my surprise, the veggies tasted just as good, if not better, at room temperature (not sure the lemon jived though.)

This recipe was really good. I didn't have all of the vegetables it called for so I just used what I had (squash, zucchini, mushrooms, red and green bell pepper and asparagus). I used Italian seasoning, salt and pepper then topped it off with lemon juice. It turned out great! Thank you.

I followed the recipe more or less exactly, other than the following: 
1) I had some really fat, fresh asparagus, so I chopped them into bite sized pieces and added them.
2) I added garlic powder and dried basil to the herbs because, of course I did. 
3) I shaved parmesan cheese on half of the veggies, so I could compare it with and without. I think they were better with, but they were pretty good without too.
I think next time I'll try it as a stir fry rather than a roast, as someone else suggested.
All in all it's a good, simple way to present vegetables and herbs. I'll try experimenting with it more in the future.
Update: I made it again today 12,17,2017 with added crimini mushrooms and shaved parmesan cheese on everything before baking. It was delicious.

Not bad. I added potatoe for a little more substance. This was quick and easy. I am not a cook so I always look for healthy and easy to make side dishes.

Very delicious. This is exactly what I had in mind. Cooked at 450 along with my parmesan crusted chicken. Was worried about the heat so used avocado oil, added a little celery salt and paprika. Bomb- diggity:)

Made it twice now. First time was with the lemon & we didn’t like it. Second time, I didn’t add the lemon & it was so much more flavorful.

Really good basic roasted veggies recipe. I just used bell peppers and yellow zucchini and onions from the garden, and melted some cheese on the top when done, and this dish was all gone at the end of supper!

I make almost the same version of this and do it on my grill.  I will try the Italian seasoning.  I currently use seasoned salt, Cajun seasoning, and garlic salt, as well as others I see on my spice rack.  I love this combination.

I made the recipe as stated, but it marinated in the fridge for a couple of days due to unforeseen circumstances.  It was a quick, easy recipe and was very good.  I'll definitely make it again.

This recipe is delicious! I made it like the recipe, except I added a small amount of Parmesan Cheese (Shredded)  on top when I took it out of the oven.

I made no changes and I believe you could use some other spices if you wanted. I would make it again. I use it for lunch prep for work. It tastes great reheated

Coming from a veggie lover, I think this was a great combination.  The flavor was missing something... needed a kick of some sort.  I'm not sure what; but that didn't stop me from enjoying.

Delicious roasted veggies.  Cooking for one, I reduced the amount of veggies but didn't reduce amount of olive oil enough.  Seasonings were great. I will make this again and again. So easy!

It's very good. I've used different seasonings to spice and change it up. In addition you can add mushrooms and broccoli.

I loved this dish. I didn't have any lemon but it doesn't need it! I did add about 1/4 tsp of turmeric because I add it to most things.  We will definitely have it again.

I made this in my iron skillet with some olive oil. It was really good. The Italian seasoning was perfect. Don't over cook if you do it on the stove. I got mine almost done and then let it sit for about 5 min. Great.

The cooking method was great -- the parchment helps brown the vegetables nicely. I'm actually giving the cooking method the five stars, since I didn't quite follow the oil/herb mixture in the recipe.  I also substituted mushrooms for peppers (not a cooked pepper fan).   I added garlic, lemon juice, and lemon zest to the oil/herbs -- it's essentially the marinade for Lemony Mediterranean Chicken on this website.  It would be good without the lemon, just a different flavor and a bit bland for my taste.

I didn’t measure the oil and itilian seasoning, but otherwise nothing changed.
The vegetables were awesome and they were all gone in a flash!
Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious and so easy!  I made the vegetables according to the directions, using Italian seasoning as I didn't have any dry Italian dressing mix.  I also added some fresh minced garlic to the oil and seasoning mixture and sprinkled the veggies with a little lemon juice before roasting as suggested as an option to add more flavor.  I used the idea from another person who added couscous for more substance.  I had a package of Roasted Garlic and Olive Oil couscous, which I cooked up and added to the veggies. The roasted veggies would have been delicious by themselves, but I needed a starch to complete the meal, thus the couscous.  It was awesome, and there weren't any leftovers!  My family devoured it!  Can't wait to make it again!

I was pleased with how this worked with fresh zucchini and yellow squash from my garden.  I added potatoes as suggested by another reviewer.  Cooking the potatoes for 15 minutes and adding the rest of the veggies for another 20 minutes cooked everything nicely.  I also included slivers of garlic in with the veggies.  They were not noticeable unless eaten alone when a nice roasted garlic flavor was detected.  Next time I will see if whole cloves might work better.
