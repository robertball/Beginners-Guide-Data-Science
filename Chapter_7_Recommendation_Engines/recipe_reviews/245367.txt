I had a couple very large bone-in chicken breasts to use , near 3/4 lb. each, and I found this recipe. On this cold January day I didn't have much hope of having usable fresh herbs and thought I was going to have to improvise with dry but I was surprised that I was able to scrounge up some rosemary and thyme out of my ice and snow covered garden to give this a try.  A happy cook I was! De-boning the chicken was easy using my kitchen shears. I just followed along and cut as close to the bones/cartilage as possible, feeling my way through the thicker meat. Very easy to do and more cost effective than buying boneless in the store. I did substitute fresh lemon juice for the vinegar. I've tried vinegar in a similar recipe and didn't like the results. The lemon juice was a delicious addition. This chicken was done in no time at all and was tender, juicy and flavorful. This is a great method for a quick healthy chicken dinner.

I don't believe you have to have skin on. This worked fine with tenderloins. Do be mindful of the vinegar and butter amount used to the amount of chicken cooked. I used Basil for the seasoning. All in all, excellent alternative to the same old pan chicken I was doing for years!

As Chef John mentions in the video, boneless skin ON breast are hard to find in the market - I de-boned my own.  They were still fairly large.  Accordingly, cooking time had to be increased.  I use a thermometer, not comfortable to go by 'looks'.   The method is fine, although - I suggest using a splatter guard or it will make a mess of your stove.  As for the sauce - for us it was too acidic.  1/4 cup of vinegar is quite a bit.  Next time,  I would use white wine and some lemon juice, instead of the vinegar, cook that down and then add the butter.

Like a few others, I also gave it a try using a skinless, boneless breast as that is what I had on hand and it turned out excellent! Not dry at all, absolutely nice and plump and juicy. I seasoned with sea salt, pepper and some herbes de Provence while cooking. For my sauce, I used a good quality white wine vinegar and a bit of lemon juice which gave the sauce a nice bite but not bitter or sour at all, thanks to the butter. Served with some fluffy mashed potatoes and some steamed green beans. With butter on both, of course! :)

This will be a keeper for me because I am always looking for new ways to cook chicken breasts and I already have a few ideas in mind for different sauce combinations to try. An excellent recipe that I encourage any chicken lover to try.

This was really good! After reading some reviews I was worried about the vinegar but that was not at all an issue.  As it cooked it mellowed and gave it great flavor. Don't fear the vinegar!  No fresh herbs on hand so I used dried. It was even a hit with the kids and I will make it again!

Hands down the ABSOLUTE BEST chicken breast recipe that I've made in 25 years of cooking.  The chicken was juicy, cooked through, the sauce was simple and heavenly.  Normally I stay away from white meat because I have GERD and dry chicken breast is hard to swallow unless it's been slathered in gravy or sauce.  But I didn't have a single problem with this chicken -- and wish that there had been enough for a second helping!

Made this tonight and it was delicious! My hubby and teenage son really liked the sauce. I made it as written and used fresh thyme. I thought the apple cider vinegar and butter made a wonderfully tasty sauce. I did use a couple splashes of chicken broth to thin out the sauce. Served with halved red potatoes and baby broccoli cooked in the oven, and fresh spinach salad. Yummy!

This is a quick, easy meat to whip up and add to veggies.  I liked that it's light and doesn't have a heavy sauce.  I used apple cider vinegar and dried rosemary because I didn't have any fresh rosemary, but it still turned out good.

I tried this recipe tonight and it was delicious. I halved the recipe and used skinless, boneless breasts, and prepared exactly as written, using apple cider vinegar and dried rosemary.  The breasts were moist and tender.  I think I'll be making this recipe again and again yummmmmmm.

After looking at the reviews, many of which said it was too acidic, I decided to add a touch of sweetness to the recipe. I used about a tablespoon of honey, which balanced the acidity perfectly. The flavor of the honey also complemented the recipe.

In the video he showed a cut (of the split chicken breast)that is easily used to make chicken fingers - I had no idea!  Glad to have that tip!

This simple recipe is very deceiving. With limited ingredients, basic herbs and spices and a couple of chicken breasts, you get a fantastic chicken dish to serve to your family. It comes out so moist and flavorful it's hard to believe that it is so quick and easy to prepare. The sauce is delicious, but there isn't much of it, so like Chef John, I served the chicken over a crisp salad with a bit of sauce drizzled over the top. Wow! So, so good!!

I've made this a number of times. The reviewer that said gross please give it another chance. You said maybe you reduced vinegar too much. No you reduced it not enough. Vinegar is very strong.  I let the vinegar reduce a lot. I end up with chkn sticking again a little but then I finish with a little ckn broth to deglaze. I love the taste of Apple cider vinegar and butter as a sauce. Tonight I  chicken thighs because my husband doesn't like white meat. It was good. Just adjusted cooking times.  Ps. My go  to spice for chicken is Herbes de Provence!

I liked the method, but would use less vinegar with a blend of lemon juice.

I use bone in for the ultimate flavor,(and who doesn't love sucking the meat off those bones?), and I replace the Vinegar with Fetzer Chardonney, to mellow out the flavors.

This was great; it was even better than I expected. I used chicken breasts (cut up into 4 oz pieces) and it did well. I did need to flip them over for an additional few minutes but they still came out great. I used Herbes de Provence like another commenter and it was just what I'd hoped for. The vinegar is a nice touch. I was unsure, but it didn't leave a vinegar-y flavor at all. Just a nice hint of apple on occasion. I'll make this regularly and the chicken will be awesome on a salad.

I've made this several times, although with chicken tenders. This recipe also works with boneless, skinless chicken. Very tasty.

Super easy and full of flavor.  I didn't bother with skin on or deboning.  I just used skinless, small chicken tenders so that saved even more time.  I also think the key to having enough flavor is the amount and number of spices used.  I generously sprinkled on thyme, paprika, marjoram, parsley, basil, plus salt and pepper.  I used dry spices.  I also let the vinegar cook a bit.  The sauce was not sour at all that way and with all the spices this had great taste.  I am usually picky and don't like bland.  I was worried something this quick and easy wouldn't be good but it was great! Going into rotation.  The tenders were moist also.

This is a wonderful way to prepare chicken.  It took me a couple of times to adjust to the stainless steel pan yet when I did the chicken turned out great.  I love the flavor of the butter and apple cider vinegar. Sometimes I throw in some mushrooms and saute them at the same time.

This is the perfect chicken recipe to make when you are short on time and need to get dinner on the table quickly: not only is it fast to prepare, but it only requires ingredients that you probably already have in your pantry/fridge/freezer. We stock up on boneless skinless chicken breasts and freeze them, so I'm always looking for new ways to prepare them; after reading the reviews from others who had used boneless skinless breasts and had good results, I thought I'd give this recipe a try. I was able to go from rock hard frozen chicken breasts to having dinner on the table in less than 45 minutes (using the inactive time while the chicken was defrosting and cooking to prepare sides) - and everyone in the family liked it! I used fresh herbs (rosemary and thyme) the first time I made this recipe and dried herbs (rosemary, sage and thyme) the second time, and I don't feel like there was a huge difference in flavor, so I'll probably just use dried herbs in the future for speed and convenience. Also, I left the chicken and sauce in the skillet after it was done cooking the first time I made this recipe, and the sauce went from thick and creamy to kind of clear and thin, which I assume means it got overcooked and split. I was using a cast-iron skillet so the retained heat probably affected the sauce. It still tasted fine, but I would recommend removing the chicken and sauce to a separate dish once cooking is complete. Overall, a winner that I will definitely make again!

I love this pan sauce. I've made it using boneless chicken breast with the skin on and B/S chicken breast, both turned out great!  I usually just cook 1 or 2 chicken breasts so I cut all the ingredients in half and it's plenty.   I also used this pan sauce on a hanger steak.  The only thing I did different was remove the steak when it hit a 135 degrees, then added (finely chopped) half of a small shallot, the fresh thyme and let cook for like 1 to 2 min before adding vinegar and butter. It was fantastic. Keep em coming Chef John.

Chef John is one of the very extremely creative chef that I know of - including the famous TV chefs.  This dish is another no-fail pleaser.  I used the combination of cider vinegar and balsamic.  This is in the "make it again" list.

Instead of pan frying, I sauted about five minutes then put in 350 degree oven for ten minutes.

I made it with chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts. I did let the vinegar cook down with the thighs for two reasons. First the thighs needed more time to cook and second because I wanted the vinegar to cook a bit longer to cut down in the acidity. Very easy recipe from start to finish even taking into consideration that I had to defrost my chicken in the microwave.

Made it as directed.  Crispy skin with moist meat.  Will definitely make chicken breast utilizing this method moving forward.

Didn't add chicken broth because we didn't think we needed to thin the sauce.

Tried this for dinner and it was amazing! Who knew vinegar and butter would be so good. I served the chicken with some steam broccoli and mashed potatoes. It was scrumptious! I will be doing this again

This is an excellent recipe. It's easy, tasty and fast too. A good base recipe that can be modified to your preference. I used skinless chicken breasts and they came out pretty tender. Instead of using vinegar I substituted marsala cooking wine. The chicken was delicious and my husband felt like we were eating an entree from a fancy Italian restaurant. Thanks Chef John for this versatile, easy to follow, and very yummy recipe!

I only had boneless, skinless chicken breasts but they still turned out really good!  Not dry...very flavorful and easy!  Simple ingredients that I happened to have...salt, pepper, fresh rosemary, cajun seasoning,  and garlic salt.  Luckily I had cider vinegar, olive oil and butter for the sauce!  Yummers!

Quick, easy, and delicious! I was nervous about the apple cider vinegar, for absolutely no reason, apparently. This will definitely be a staple from here on in.

This was a delicious recipe and tasted like it was baked in the oven.  I was surprised and my husband loved it.  Would have been good with a side of stuffing.  We had a baked potato and small salad.  Must try and don't substitute ingredients or method of cooking.

I was a bit apprehensive about the vinegar but I needed a quick dinner so I went ahead with it.  My husband said it didn't smell very good when it was cooking, but once we tasted it, we decided it''s definitely going into the favourite recipes file.

This was excellent even with boneless/skinless breasts.  I think this process could work just as well with pork chops.  This is a recipe that company would love but easy enough for a weeknite dinner, which is always a plus!  Dont be afraid of the vinegar either.

I made it with skinless breasts and while the skin would have added visual appeal and extra flavor, it was still very good. I did not remove the "tenders" portion and that caused the tail to be slightly over-cooked. It was still good but did not have the rich moisture as the rest.

I used tarragon, oregano & thyme. Only had  boneless skinless breasts. After cooking the chicken and removing it to another  container, I added a  chicken bullion cube to the sauce and two tablespoons of flour and some milk  to make a gravy . Served it with instant smashed potatoes, Yum
My picky daughter didn't like it , cause it was "different"! Good, more for me
I think it may have been the tang from the vinegar. I liked the tang but next time I may try wine for my picky eaters.

Made it with boneless skinless chicken breast as that is all I had. I used lemon juice and white wine and basil. Can't wait to try it as written!

It turned out quite well I think. I used boneless skinless chicken, and followed the same instructions (had to adjust cooking times, but the temperature guide helped greatly). 

Would definitely recommend this to others.

Used lemon juice in place of vinegar. Served with roasted red potatoes and broccoli which made a beautiful plate. Started veggies first and it all finished together.

So let me tell you how NOT to make this recipe.  I have made it 6 times and it turned out DELICIOUS the first and last time.  The rest of the attempts went straight into the trash.  That probably says more about my skills than the recipe but here's what I've learned from my mistakes:  1)  DON'T use thick pieces of chicken.  Make sure they're about 2/3"-3/4" thick.  I deboned the chicken breasts then covered them with parchment paper and pounded them, trying not to knock the skin off.  2) DON'T put them in the skillet before it is hot! Make sure the skillet is Med-High hot first. 3) DON'T forget to turn down the heat when you turn them over.  Chef John says in the video to turn it down from Med-High to Medium but it's not in the written recipe.  4) DON'T overcook and DON'T undercook.  5) And in my opinion the sauce wasn't necessary. The chicken, when cooked well, is tender and tasty without any sauce.

Made with skinless chicken breasts. Taste was great. Not as tender as l expected, might have over cooked it. Will make again but reduce cooking time.

The recipe calls for apple cider vinegar, but it can be substituted for white cooking wine and it will still taste the same. We all loved it, and we've made it 4 times since discovering it.

Followed the recipe as is. But as our staple, we love hot spicy chili. Added half a sweet onion and one jalapeño. Came out pretty darn good!

Wow! Sooooooo good! I saw the video and used the measurements on the video.I followed the video exactly. However,  I only used 1 tb of apple vinegar instead of the two shown in the video. I was hesitant because of all the bad reviews on vinegar. I cooked the two skinless large breasts in 2 tb of olive oil and used 2 tb of butter. For the herbs, I used dried Rosemary and fresh thyme.  The cooking for the breasts took much longer  because the breasts were too thick. I think next time I will cut the breasts in half. My family loved it!

All I can say is WOW... I am a very picky eater and wasn’t sure about this recipe but wanted to try it anyways. I used balsamic vinaigrette and thinner pieces of chicken breast and it came out amazing. I also used fresh rosemary and Tyme.

Just okay. The "sauce" is just butter. The vinegar evaporates and you're left with chicken swimming in butter. The sauce was tasteless. Perhaps if salted butter is used it is better? The chicken was good, but next time I won't bother making the sauce.

Delicious, easy recipe to put into the rotation.

We split a boneless chicken breast and used 3 tbs butter and apple cider vinegar.  Perfect ratio, but we'll likely use a bit more next time, as it's so delicious we ran out.

I actually liked this recipe, despite not cutting down the ingredients for 2 breasts. It was a little tart and smelled really sour but the taste was good. Will make this again using the 4 breasts recommended.

This was such a quick and easy meal and everyone in the family enjoyed it. I will absolutely be making it again. I mostly followed the recipe but I decreased the apple cider vinegar by just a little and added minced garlic to the sauce. I also added powdered garlic to the chicken because we love garlic. I only had chicken breast tenderloins so that's what I used.

Very juicy and flavorful.  I used skinless breasts, so I didn't get a crispy coat, but I didn't miss it.  I used Balsamic vinegar  which gave it a little sweetness.  Very easy, will definitely make it again.

Absolutely delicious and I didn’t make it exactly right! I mistakenly added the butter too soon. I also made it without the skin. I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts and they were so yummy this is going to be my go to for a quick dinner I can make in minutes. Loved it!! I used balsamic vinegar too, by the way. It was perfect and smelled heavenly.

I made this dish following the recipe instructions exactly, except my chicken breasts didn’t have the skin on. .  It was fast and easy to make and was  absolutely yummy.  The  addition of butter and apple cider vinegar sounded odd to me, but the sauce turned out to be amazing.  Would definitely recommend it.

I was impressed with the recipe. I did make a few changes. Because I couldn't find the breasts with skin on, I went with the regular breast halves. I also substituted white wine vinegar for the apple cider vinegar. It still came out great! Thanks for sharing!

Delicious and easy. I halved the recipe and used boneless skinless chicken breasts, as that’s what I had on hand. I did find it took a lot longer to get to 150F than the recipe says, maybe 10 mins longer. Probably just my stove... The sauce is yummy, the vinegar really mellows out a bit while simmering. I think this would be good with white wine too!

Pretty much followed recipe except used a commercial chicken rub/seasoning in place of herbs. Pat chicken dry before oil and seasoning. Cooked in cast iron skillet - butter and organic cider vinegar kept it moist and tasty. Oh yeah, used skinless/boneless breasts. Served with rice and sautéed squash.

I followed the recipe almost to the letter. Used skinless, boneless breasts and seasoned the chicken with Lawry's and pepper,  but all else the same. This is the first time I've ever made chicken breasts in the pan that weren't dry and bland. They were absolutely delicious, and hubby went nuts for it! Added a fresh spinach salad with homemade dressing, and we were thrilled. Will be making them again, for sure. Thank you!

OK. Straight up, I used olive oil to fry the chicken... Big mistake! I should have followed the recipe because the end result was that the chicken skin didn't turn out crispy. Flavor was insane, and my wife loved it. Will be making this again very, very, soon!

Awesome!

This was a new cooking method for me for chicken breasts. It resulted in the most moist, tender breasts I’ve ever cooked. I made it with apple cider vinegar and balsamic and added fresh rosemary and garlic and it was fantastic, but I can imagine there are hundreds of wonderful combinations. My chicken breasts were large so they took a lot longer to cook. I ended up covering the pan to speed it along. Love the sauce...may have to make more next time.

Followed to a T. Sauce is good. Had to cook a little longer than suggested as I cook at a lower setting to keep from burning things. Wife gave it 5 stars, I made  fried cabbage with garlic as the side.

4/1/18: This was so easy to make and delicious. Love the recipe for it's simplicity and flavor. No changes needed to this simple recipe and I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts. I also used dried herbs instead of fresh...simply sprinkled over the top of each chicken breast.The chicken was moist/tender and had a perfect balance of flavor with the sauce. I didn't have to add more broth/water to thin out the sauce either. Used apple cider vinegar as that's what I had on hand and over medium heat did not have any issues with the sauce as noted in other reviews. Served with asparagus and scalloped potatoes. Thanks for sharing the recipe, Chef John! 5/12/19: I'd add some minced garlic to to this next time.

Very, very good.  I should have added more herbs.  Used parsley and rosemary to total 1 Tbs. but could have added more.  My chicken breasts were quite thick so I put the frying pan in a hot oven to finish before adding vinegar and butter.  Couldn't taste the vinegar but it added a lot to the whole flavor.  Spooned the sauce over the chicken to serve.

This recipe is DANGEROUS! I almost burnt my eyes when the vinegar started to jump on the frypan!! The author should had warned about the temperature. 
The chicken itself didn't get any especially good flavour. Besides, the chicken turns out too oily. Try something else.

This was gross.  User error?  I've never made a pan sauce with vinegar before, could I have done something wrong?  The flavor of vinegar was completely off-putting so the only thing I can think of is it reduced too much, but the quantities were correct.  I will keep to a white wine reduction with butter!

I only had skinless boneless breasts but these turned out beautiful and tasty all the same.  Wonderful flavors from the fresh rosemary, parsley & thyme from the garden! My kids have already said I will HAVE to make this again. Chef John does it again!

Just finished the chicken salad made from leftovers.  I used the boneless, skinless breasts also, but I went a little crazy with the  spices.  Turned out moist, juicy, and far from bland

Deliciously perfect!  The moistest chicken breast I've ever eaten.  Used 1/2 vinegar and 1/2 lemon juice; and 1 Tbs. of dried herbs.  Tossed the bones into a pot of cooking rice for added flavor.  Breasts were extra large, 3/4 pound each, so cooked an extra five minutes.

I made a few minor changes only because that's what I had handy. It was incredible!!! For fresh ?? herbs I actually had to use dry herbs and it still tasted fantastic, they were dill and cilantro. I also used balsamic vinegar it was great, my husband loved it! 
(I also re seared it just for an extra crunch.

Smells good! I used partially frozen chicken, make sure it is thawed fully as it dries out some when cooking this way otherwise. Will probably make again. Thanks!

I made this with boneless, skinless breasts because thats what I had on hand. I found that I needed a longer cook time then stated in the recipe. I used the recommended seasonings and found this recipe to be nice and flavorful, as well as very simple to prepare.

This was a great recipe! Chicken came out juicy and flavorful and my family loved it! I used lemon juice rather than the vinegar, however,  the next time I make this I will not use lemon juice. I will use a chicken broth, water with a tiny bit of Worcestershire sauce, or just one tablespoon ...Lemon juice makes the sauce and chicken a little too tart

This was easy to make and our four year old grandkids enjoyed it as well. Based on the vinegars he uses, I used half apple cider and half rice vinegar. It has an excellent taste and it's a nice twist on a chicken dish.

Got lots of compliments but I was surprised that there was so much liquid in the skillet . I cut the chicken into tenderloins thinking that the seasoning would more evenly be distributed but then they didn't brown. The result looked more like boiled chicken but with good flavor and moisture. I will probably cut back on the vinegar next time.

In addition to salt and pepper, I added to the skin garlic, onion and coriander powders as well as paprika (for color). Yum! The formula of 3 fatties and an acid was perfect!

This recipe is awesome! Works great really good flavor . I use fresh herbs from the garden and that I believe is the icing on the cake. Really good for a quick easy main course or great on salads.

I thought this was ok but not worth five stars. The chicken was very moist, pan sauce was a little bland even though I added more herbs. I probably won't make it again.

The chicken turned out fine, but I guess my breast were large and had to be placed in the oven.

Pan-roasted Chicken Breasts Haiku: "Too much work for me (de-bone the breast, keep the skin) but yes, it was moist." As w/ the review by Galefrances, this recipe gave me the opportunity to save a ton of $$$ by de-boning 3 monstrous split-chicken breasts (and make chicken stock for portioning and freezing from the bones), and also like her review, we weren't wowed by the recipe, and my stovetop was an utter mess (med-hi heat grease splatter from the oil, followed by the addition of the butter near the end.) I had apple cider vinegar but decided to use a honey ginger vinegar. It added a nice taste, but gosh, depending on what fresh herbs or what vinegar you use, that could change the taste of the end dish. My 3-star is for the effort, the splatter mess, and that my chicken was burnt on one side and not quite cooked thru at 6 min. per side; burney char aside, the chicken inside WAS moist.

Wow, this is the first chef john's recipe that wasn't a hit. Yes, the chicken was moist even though I overlooked it ( my thermometer was broke and I had to wing it ). I'm not sure if I liked the vinegar.  I was generous with the salt and pepper and used thyme. It was bland. I will say though that I learned how to "properly" debone a chicken breast and I will end up getting three meals because of that.

I couldn't believe how easy this delicious chicken was to make.   I'm not a fan of vinegar, so I substituted with white wine and a splash of lemon juice.  

Next time I'll double the recipe because we didn't have any leftovers.  Everyone loved it!

This was the most moist chicken breast I have ever made without braising or cooking in a heavy sauce.  Wonderful!

This is a delicious pan sauce for chicken!  It's piquant flavor enhances the fresh herbs used on the chicken.  I used bone-in, skin-on breasts.

We didn't care for this one - especially the vinegar.
