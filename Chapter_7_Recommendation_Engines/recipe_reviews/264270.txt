Followed the IP directions for cooking potatoes and eggs except I only cooked them for 3 minutes. Also, added 2 teaspoons of sugar and 1/2 white onion (diced) to dressing.

The best potato salad I've ever had by far and the easiest to make. I followed the recipe except for the mustard, I used deli style with horseradish. Thank you Fioa for an outstanding recipe.

Needed much more mustard. I boiled the potatoes and eggs the old fashioned way; I added a LOT more mustard than the recipe called for and omitted the celery. Next time, Iâ€™ll likely add sweet pickles. Good recipe overall, and much easier than I thought - first time making ANY potato salad!

I made this recipe as written. It was just ok. I wound up throwing  in some additional spices as well as green onions. What I really did like, was the cooking method. I used my pressure cooker, and it was super easy. Usually I overcook  the potatoes, but the were the perfect texture. Eggs were also done.
