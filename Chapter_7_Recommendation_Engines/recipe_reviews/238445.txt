Okay. This is the first time I've rated a recipe.  I loved this. I added garlic because I love garlic.  My roast was about 2 lbs. So when I added all the ingredients it looked like it needed a little water.  So I added about a cup of water because it was really thick. But all and all I loved it.  Very tender and taste was great according to my husband. I didn't have time to do low for 8 hours so I pumped up the heat about 3 hours on high and then low and it still came out great. Will add more water next time. Gravy thick but husband loved it

Oh My GOODNESS!! This was absolutely Yummy!.Followed directions but did not use any veggies except onions, added some burgundy cooking wine and 2 packs of brown gravy mix since I didn't have beef stew mix, a few pats of butter and a couple of bay leaves! Excellent...used a 3.5 lb roast beef, 2 hours on high and 3 on low in crock pot...AWESOME!! Thank You!

LOVED...LOVED...LOVED this recipe! I didn't change anything (except made mashed potatoes instead of placing them in the 
crock pot) , otherwise cooked it just as displayed & it did not disappoint. I used a roast just over 3lbs, fed 5 people. EVERY SINGLE bite was gone! I will definitely make this again as it will be my official roast recipe!!

I pre seasoned my roast with sea salt, Applewood rub, and onion powder. I also added chopped celery to the veggies, and put about a 1/2c of beef broth in the slow cooker.

I’ve made this several times and it comes out amazing each time! As per one reviewer said, I put carrots in at the end and everyone, who has eaten it, has complimented me on their texture. My picky husband, three and one year old are all very silent

This was outstanding! I made the recipe as written. After 8 hours, the meat was practically falling apart.

This recipe was 5+ stars!!  I used a 3.5 pound chuck roast followed the recipe and used Campbell’s Healthy Choice Cream of Mushroom rather than celery and added 2-gloves of Garlic.  Due to time, I cooked it for 3 hours on High and 3 hours on Low.  The meat was so tender it literally feel apart.  The next time I will increase the veggies.  It was a fabulous meal to celebrate Veteran’s Day ???? and my husband loved it and can’t wait for leftovers!!

The meat and gravy were so yummy! Nobody in our family cared for the potatoes. Next time, we will try leaving the potatoes out and make mashed potatoes instead.

My family really enjoyed this. I used russet potatoes since I did not have any red on hand.  Also substituted beef seasoning with Penzey's Quebec seasoning.  Would definitely make this again!

The only changes that I made was to add 2 small onions and used Baby yellow Dutch potatoes instead of the red potatoes.  It was delicious and I have enough to have another meal for the two of us.

DELICIOUS!! Did 5 1" chops and subbed chicken broth for the wine (cuz I drank it all the day before) and added a tsp of thyme to the mushroom mixture. Browned the chops really well and baked 25 minutes then added the sauce and baked for another 20-25 minutes. Made mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables and every scrap was eaten. This is my new go to! Thank u for a fabulous recipe

My family loved the deep flavors and veggies. Gravy was perfection but  I didn't have cream of celery soup so I used cream of mushroom soup, I believe the results were the same. Fork tender pot roast and veggies.

Wow! Just wow! Best roast beef ever. I followed the recipe as written except like some others, took out the potatoes and made mashed potatoes on the side instead. Just a preference. The gravy is amazing   I will definitely make this again as it will be requested again, I’m sure. Family loved it.

This gets 5 stars because my husband really liked it and kept saying what a great dinner it was. I thought it was salty, which would be hard to rectify since I did not add any, and the gravy was rather thick. I will make it again and alter it slightly to suit us both. Thanks for the recipe.

Being a bachelor, I had to cut the recipe down and I did substitute others but it came out awesome!
