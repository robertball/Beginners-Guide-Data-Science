Each part of a recipe should be delicious on it's own.  The chocolate kiss is good alone as a candy.  Unfortunately, the cookie is rather bland.  If I try this recipe again I may try adding some almond extract.  See if that helps.  I didn't have any problems with the cookies being flat as stated in an earlier review.  They are actually very pretty looking cookies.

I made these cookies for a wedding and used a heart shaped chocolate instead of a Hershey Kiss.  They were a hit!

They were easy and quick to make. While the cookie itself was a bit bland, if it were too rich it would have offset the kiss. I might add a little almond extract, though.
