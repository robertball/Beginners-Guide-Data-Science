This was excellent!  I made a few adjustments.  I used apricot preserves instead of chutney (what I had on hand), omitted the pepper since I didn't have any, and substituted cucumber for celery (don't like celery).   I also used regular salt, added more curry powder for flavor and some cayenne pepper for spice.  I also added chopped cashews because the flavors blend well (and I didn't have any pine nuts).  Definitely marinate overnight- it makes a difference and marries the flavors well.  Thanks!

My husband loved this but if I make this again I would take other reviewers advice and add less rice. The only thing I left out was the pine nuts as I couldn't get any. Thanks

Very easy and very good.  I used plain yogurt (not low-fat) instead of the sour cream, and added a little more mayo.  I used chopped red and green peppers instead of celery, and added chopped cashews instead of pine nuts.  Yum!

Great salad! I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream with good results- I may try nonfat plain yogurt next time and maybe slightly less rice as suggested.

we really liked the flavors of this dish!! the result is more of a sticky sort of rice, due to the chutney and such. a really nice change from the ordinary rice salad for a summer meal. i ended up with cranberry chutney instead of the mango as that was all that was avail, and omitted the pine nuts as i was out. all in all, worth the effort!! many compliments on the flavor.

Very good and flavorful recipe.  I used peach preserves, added cayenne pepper as someone else suggested, and omitted the pine nuts.  Otherwise, I did everything else the same.  Took it to work and had several requests for the recipe.

I've twice made this recipe for large groups of people and had nothing but good reviews.  Very easy to make and surpisingly fill with flavour.  I'm always shocked at how far a little curry goes.

This is great and makes SOOOO much. What a great way to feed alot of people with a little meat! The rice can be scaled back to half, and is still good, but don't omit it.

I added cashews instead of pine nuts and just used ready-roasted chicken from the store, and it was amazing! My book club loved it and all wanted to take home the leftovers! Also, use basmati rice not instant.

This recipe was an excellent base to my additions.
I put chili oil in with the rice while it was cooking. Substituted maramalade and a little red curry paste for chutney. Added shredded carrots and used diced chicken fingers. Great spice with a hint of sweet!

Awesome...I have been craving the flavor of curry and this was just the ticket.  My modifications to the recipe were to make it a bit healthier by adding brown rice instead of white, and light sour cream.  I also added a pinch of cayenne for a bite and cashews intead of pine nuts...allergic.  Love it, can't wait to serve it this evening after the flavors meld.

I am always looking for recipes for leftover rice and this one is so far the best! I found it a bit too creamy. Next time I will only use 1/2 cup of sour cream. I also omitted the chicken and added a bit more red pepper.

This was very good.  At first, I wasn't crazy about it - it was very thick.  I kept adding more mayo and sour cream.  After letting it sit a day and adding the cayenne pepper, it was very good.  Kept finding myself eating small bits of it when I went to the kitchen.

I thought that the finished product of this was awesome, but being a add-it-yourself type of girl I had a few of my own touches I threw in 1) cayenne as previous members had said, to give it a tad of heat 2) I added frozen green peas, really just to get rid of the rest of the bag 3) I chunked in some flax seeds for more CRUNCH 4) Tossed in some coriander seeds for that delicious flavour & 5)I switched out quinoa instead of rice for the added nutrition

Did not have celery, green onion or pepper, so I substituted celery salt for the salt and decreased both the mayo and sour cream by 1/4 c.  Substituted mandarin oranges for the chutney..Great way to use left over rice and chicken (used brown rice)...delicious!!

A good change of pace for our family.  The crunchiness of the celery was a nice contrast with the rice and chicken.  Next time, I'll add more vegetables and a bit more of the dressing ingredients, but it was still good as it was.

This is so good and you can do a lot to play around with it - I use brown rice, plain fat-free yogurt instead of the sour cream, crushed almonds instead of pine nuts, leave out the celery and add water chestnuts instead, you could do tofu rather than chicken... etc.  As long as you keep the curry and mango chutney it always tastes good!

I uses jasmine rice cooked in 1/2 coconut milk 1/2 chicken stock foran extra flavor boost. Was a huge hit...even the kids loved it! Also, I cut the mayo as suggested by others, the sour cream was enough. Toasting the nuts makes them crunchier and tastier too.

I have been wanting to make this salad for a while, and decided to make it today. I forgot to get the green onion and red pepper (duh!) but the dish was excellent even without them. I added some dried cilantro also. I discovered that I liked curry after eating at Boma, a restaurant in the Animal Kingdom Lodge at Disney World. This brought back the memory of that fantastic restaurant!

Delicious and simple. I added more curry than the recipe indicated, I like it a little more spicy.

I used brown (natural) rice instead of white. I found the dressing a tad too rich and creamy, I would use a bit less next time. Overall a very tasty and satisfying rice salad, I will definitely make it again.

A good base recipe, but for our family I needed to amp up the flavors with more mayo, more curry powder and a little hot sauce. The family gobbled it up!

If you use leftover rice it's important to mix the rice and mayo mixture a couple hours in advance to soften the rice. My old recipe used coconut mile and mayo. I appreciate others' suggestions: I used cucumber and sunflower seeds instead of celery and pine nuts. I also added some chopped tamarind for a bit more zing.

This turned out great! I didn't have the chutney so I used apricot preserves, used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and accidentally put in two tsp. of cumin instead of curry before I realized my mistake. I took out some of the cumin, went ahead with two tsp. curry, and the blended flavor in the final result was awesome! LCD

This was very tasty. I basically followed the recipe, although I did add a large handful of chopped basil just because I had it on hand, and it complemented the flavor very nicely. I substituted a half cup of blanched slivered almonds for the pine nuts. I also used a whole red pepper, chopped--this wasn't too much, but I wouldn't add more than that. It has a very creamy texture--one could perhaps cut back on the sour cream/mayo.

I made this recipe in the middle of winter and served it as a warm dish instead of cold (mixing all ingredients and adding the chicken and rice as soon as they finished cooking) and it was fantastic!. I didn't have any chutney or preserves at the time so I put some coconut on the table, as an optional addition. I must say, I've been to India and had authentic Indian curry and this has jumped to the top of my favorite curry dishes. It will be one of my permanent recipes. Thank you, thank you!

We enjoyed this very much in the run-up to Christmas. I wanted to make gravy and bought a rotisserie chicken, I chopped the meat from the bones & made broth from the bones. Then I chopped the chicken & made this salad. It was delicious - just the amount of spice my husband will accept. Next time I will double the ingredients except the rice to have a richer salad. I served it lukewarm and chilled - both good. Forgot the pine nuts - oops!

Really good! The Mango chutney works beautifully. Next time I am going to sub yogurt in for the mayo and reduce the amount. I may also try jasmine or basmatti rice. Thanks Sheryl!
