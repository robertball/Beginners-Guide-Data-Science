Really liked the simplicity of this recipe. Will definitely make it again with 1 modification of using a simple syrup instead of sugar to sweeten sorbet to avoid any gritty texture. We used regular peaches as white were not available when I made this. Added a few leaves of mint to add additional flavor (next time use a mint simple syrup?). It was smooth, creamy and flavorful.
