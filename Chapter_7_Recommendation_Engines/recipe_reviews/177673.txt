I thought these were too oniony for my liking, but if you love onions, then this is the one for you.  I will make them again but probably use only half of the package.

I thought this was pretty good but my husband didn't like it. It was a quick and easy burger though and I always have the ingredients on hand. I left the water out and toasted the buns.

I really liked this burger. It was super easy and tasted great. I made it on the George Foreman Grill and it was ready to eat in minutes. I will make again.

Used ground turkey instead of beef, added a little chopped red pepper and ground black pepper to the patty. Also used sweet onion buns, topped patty with bacon, red pepper ring, white onion ring, and usual condiments. It was one of the best burgers I have ever had!! My boyfriend couldn't believe it was homemade. I will be making these all the time! Thanks!!

Tasty, but on general principles I use anything BUT the Campbell's and Pepperidge Farm ingredients. Generics (or artisan rolls) work as well or better. Effing corporate self-serving recipes. Also, adding an egg and/or bread crumbs helps hold the patties together during cooking.
