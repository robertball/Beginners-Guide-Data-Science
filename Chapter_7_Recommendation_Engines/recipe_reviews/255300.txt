I was worried about them being too dry so I doubled the butter and they were perfect! Boyfriend loved them! Topping with chocolate cream cheese frosting next!

Excellent recipe!!!  I doubled the recipe and substituted half the butter for applesauce. Also, I added dark chocolate chunks and walnuts,  instead of chocolate chips. I  topped them with chocolate cream cheese frosting!!! Delicious!!! Super moist, not too sweet,  and yummy!!!

I followed the recipe and cooked them for exactly 20 minutes. they came out very dry. the flavors were good but overall they were disappointing
