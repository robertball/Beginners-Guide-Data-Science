It tasted like the eloquent pineapple of the Caribbean. My mouth watered as I slowly bit into the moist marinated chicken. My heart skipped a beat as the warmth encompassed my body. The succulent dish gave me a revelation of what true cooking is.

I absolutely loved this recipe. The only thing I did differently was season the chicken with garlic and herb/ seasoned salt to make it more flavorful. My husband LOVES it. Thank you!!!!

I did pretty much what the recipe called for but I used rotisserie chicken. It seemed to come out more juicy.  It was a pleasant dish. My family seemed to really enjoy it.

Great as written! I stuck to the recipe as much as possible but needed to sub about 1/3 C sour cream instead of the Neufch√¢tel. I also used fresh basil (3 Tbsp chopped) instead of dried, added just before baking. I covered the dish for the 20 min baking time then uncovered for the added cheese. Hubby needed red pepper flakes but he spices everything. It was a nice way to get him to eat spinach.

This was exceptionally good!  I made a few changes because I didn't have supplies on hand.  I used sour cream instead of cream cheese, and 4 cheese Mexican cheese instead of Mozzarella.  I also salted and peppered the chicken because I thought it needed it.  My husband and I ate the whole batch (honestly it doesn't make that much).   Great recipe!

My husband made it and used a few tweaks due to what we had on hand. Used Cream Cheese, no basil, Italian style cut tomatoes (probably had some basil in that), only had half the spinach. It was yummy! Will make again!

My wife loved it so it is automatically added to my cook book.  I did not use as much spinach but will add it all the next round.  I found it a little dry and may add a little extra sauce the next time as I like a little saucy for dipping bread.

This is a great recipe!  I am one to frequently be confused by a recipe more advanced than simply boiling water but I have made this dish 3 times and each time the result was exactly the same.  I would change nothing, just prepare and enjoy.

Sorry but we did not care for this recipe. It was bland and dry with soggy noodles (they were al dente when they went in the oven)

This was a definite hit with my entire family! I made a double batch and froze half for another meal. My kids all loved it and had at least two helpings each.

this is honestly so good, i've made it multiple times and substitute tofu for mine and it still tastes awesome! i usually also add some extra seasoning to chicken/tofu just so its more flavorful and extra sauce/tomatoes tastes good in it too
