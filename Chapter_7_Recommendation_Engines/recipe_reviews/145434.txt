Sooooo good. I've had problems keeping them together but have found that making them the day before is the solution. Thanks for the great recipe.

These were awesome burgers, I prepared the mixture the night before and didn't have any problem with the patties when cooking them the next day, full of flavor and it didn't have that ground beef taste at all, really good burger.

Great burgers, the person who said that they added less cayenne pepper was using the wrong ingredient.  2 teaspoons cayenne would definitely be too too hot.  It is too concentrated.  The recipe refers to crushed red pepper, which is the type of pepper you see in the shaker jars at pizza restaurants.  2 teaspoons of crushed red pepper is just right, but of course it should be to the taste of those who are making them.

HELPFUL TIPS IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN:  At 1 tsp of red pepper, it was still spicy tasting and nothing I imagine any small child would like ...and this is coming from someone who lives spicy and is Asian.  I'd definitely cut it out or cut down to just 1/2t.  Lastly, I'd totally listen to those who made the night before and cooked the next day.  Wow, what a difference.  I also cook this half the time covered and then take the cover off the last half and the juices just make a nice glace that come onto the burger and oh my yummy!!! This is my 5th time making these in 3 wks.  I love eating them!!!  Even better you don't have to use the grill to perfect them!

This is my standard burger recipe now.  Only thing I change is a lot less cayenne for my 2.5-year-old and I don't cook them in a pan.  If you want to grill them, make sure you refrigerate for at least a couple hours to firm them up.  And on the Foreman make sure you flip/move them or they burn and stick to the grill.  I've even made these without the honey mustard when I was out and they're still great.

I did have to add bread crumbs to the mixture to make them bind as burgers, but once cooked we loved these! They are full of flavor and the mixture would probably make a wonderful meatloaf.

did not like this at all. I followed the recipe to the letter but it came out to wet for the meat to stay together and it tasted very salty. came out more like taco meat than hambugers. won't be trying this one again.

I like a hamburger to taste like pure beef, not like meat loaf and brown sugar is added to the mixture, too?  Thanks, but no thanks.

Very good.  I mixed all the ingredients and put it in the refrigerator in the morning and formed the patties at night.  I didn't have any problem with them falling apart.  I cooked them on the Foreman grill, which could have helped with the falling apart.  The flavors were very good, not your ordinary burger.

When I use lean ground beef(90-95% lean beef) to make burgers, I always add 1/4 cup olive oil/ lb. beef. Lean is healthier but tends to be dry, so I add the heart healthy fat of olive oil to moisten things up. I followed this recipe as written, with the exception of adding the 2 T's of olive oil to the mix instead of using it for cooking. I mixed the ingredients in the AM, and had no fall-apart issues while cooking. The combination of sweetness and spiciness was a new experience in a burger, and it took me a few bites to realize I liked it! I think that next time 1t. of crushed red pepper will do it for us, but will definitely be making this again!

My husband absolutely loved the burgers.  He prefers ground turkey, so I just substituted the beef for turkey.  Will definitely save this in my arsenal of recipes.

It fell apart.  The flavor was good, but it didn't hold. I had to run out and get a pizza for the kids. Luckily, I have a resourceful teenager who suggested putting the broken burger on the pizza which turned out pretty good, or else I would have been upset at losing a pound of ground chuck.

Wow!  What an incredible burger!  When looking at the recipe I thought that all the spices would be overwhelming but it's not in the least.  It is bliss in a burger.  Spicy, sweet and sooooo delicious!  I won't ever make anything else, this recipe cannot be topped.

Excellent!  Have made several times and had no trouble with mixture holding together.  Have done both in a skillet and on the grill.  Cut back on the red pepper flakes if serving to folks who aren't into "spicy hot".   Definitely a KEEPER!!!

LOVE these burgers!  I gave it 4 stars only because I think the pepper flakes should be omitted or at the very least reduced by 1/2.  They were too spicy - my lips burned! However, I did like the sweet taste these burgers had, so I made them again without the pepper flakes. This is the only way I'll make burgers from now on - tasty! 5 starts without the pepper flakes!!

Delicious! A little spicy, so those sensitive to spice may want to add 1/2 the recommended amount or less.  My husband and friend loved them though! I used regular American slice cheese, since that's what I had on hand.  I'm going to try making them the night before next time, like another user suggested, to help them stay together when cooked.

The flavor was amazing. It was a little too spicy for me, but I imagine it would be great for everyone else since I don't like anything spicy. I'll cut down on the crushed pepper next time, but they were fantastic when following the recipe, too. I was thinking of having another one later the same day. I also let them sit for about 30 minutes and had no problem with them falling apart.

I thought this burger had a nice flavor, it was juicy. I read the other reviews about the burgers falling apart, to prevent this from happening I cut back on the honey mustard and made the burgers the night before. We grilled the burgers, I think grilling gives the best flavor.

Oh wow! Delicious! I haven't eaten the actual whole entire hamburger yet, but I've nibbled on a patty and man is it good! I followed the directions exactly but reduced the red pepper flakes (I have a 3 year old who will not eat spicy food). Nice flavors. This will be a keeper. Now to see how my hubby likes it...

The burgers turned out great! I used extra lean beef and this recipe made the meat quite tender, much less "dry". Found it spicy with the red chili pepper ... very good but not an every day burger recipe for me, more of a special occasion burger.

My family, including my four year old twins, LOVED it! I just cut down on the red pepper for the kids. It was better than a restaurant hamburger! Sweet, juicy- Full of flavor! So good!

Soooo good. My family loved this recipe. I will make it again. I used ground venison. I made larger patties for my husand and they broke apart a little. The patties I made for everyone else were perfect.

We loved this recipe!  I used ground chicken instead of ground beef and it was stilll delicious.  I also turned the mixture into small, cocktail meatballs to serve as an appetizer and  Honey mustard salad dressing as dipping sauce-

A comment for the reviewers who have trouble with these falling apart. If you chill any burger at least 1/2 hour before cooking it, you will have less trouble with crumbling.

Fantastic! The taste and consistency is much like a meatloaf with a subtle sweetness. I substituted the crushed red pepper with a 1/2 tsp of Old Bay and a little bit of black pepper. I also threw in 2 tbs of chopped onions and a 1/4 cup of cheddar cheese to the mixture. Topped it with barbecue sauce, American cheese, bacon and french fried onions. Killer burger.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it was a 5 star recipe.  The recipe itself was pretty amazing.  I however would personally give it only 4 because for me was just a tad bit too sweet and not spicy enough.  This of course can be adjusted which is one thing I like about this recipe.  I did have a little trouble with my first batch because I did not put enough bread crumbs in it, therefore they fell apart a bit, but after I added more I had no problem.  My boyfriend and our roommate loved these burgers and I will definitely make them again. Thank you for an amazing recipe Aaron, the flavors were different yet yummy!

This was a delicious cheeseburger!  I am not a huge fan of swiss cheese so I topped mine with cheddar, doubled the recipe and froze patties seperated by wax paper and wrapped in foil for next week :) Def need an ice cold carbonated beverage with these burgers!  My husband said it is the best burger he has ever had with a beer!

I'm more herbivore than carnivore but every now and then I love a good burger. I made Aaron' s burger sans half the red pepper  and substituting Ementhaler for swiss cheese. I grilled it slowly over low heat and served it between sweet onion buns. It had just the right amount of heat and the taste was superb. My new go-to for parties!

Absolutely yummy!  My only issue was the patties started to fall apart as they were cooking.  I managed to keep this from happening by removing the oil from the pan.

So, next time I will not use the olive oil and I will reduce the amount of crushed red pepper as the kids found it a little too spicy (but still ate the whole thing).

Being from MO, I really wanted to like these.  Probably mostly my fault that I am not that crazy about them.  I didnt have any trouble with the burger staying together until it was cooking.  It was pretty loose and unstable to turn.  I see now that is probably my fault, due to not a very lean burger to start with.  But I could have lived with that, but they were too sweet I thought.  And I like sweet, so I don't know.  DH liked it though.  He said he didnt notice that it was that sweet, so I dont know.  I guess I will try again some day and maybe up my rating.  But thank you though for sharing and for showing that you don't have to stick to the same ole same ole and you can add new flavors to the inside of the burger.

Good, but maybe just a little too sweet for my family. \Made patties in the morning and refrigerated, with no problem with them falling apart. Grilled instead of pan frying. Served with potato salad and fresh tomato salad from this site for a lovely hot weather meal. Thanks!

This is to DIE for. I just ate this for dinner tonight and can't wait to have it again. I absolutely couldn't keep the meat together using 93%  so will try what someone else suggested and make them the night before next time. I've never had a better hamburger.

WAY too sweet and definitely must chill to help them stay together. I tried again omitting the brown sugar (that should have tipped me off, along with other's reviews that they were too sweet) but kept the honey mustard. Still too sweet. But I will try again, omitting the mustard.

Really good burger.  Everyone loved it.  The only thing I did different was I used a little less crushed red pepper than called for.  I prepared them early and let them chill in the refrigerator for 4 hours and then cooked them on the grill.  I didn't have any problem with them falling apart.  Delicious.

This was awesome. Everyone who had one f these burgers when I made them loved them. The only thing that was a slight issue is the mixture is very wet, next time I plan to add some bread crumbs. I only had one burger break apart so it was a catastrophe but I would suggest adding bread crumbs. Over all very moist and tasted awesome. This is my new recipe for burgers.. Thank you.

Not bad. I followed the recipe for the most part, I didn't have any honey mustard so I used Spicy brown Mustard and did not put any honey in. I felt the brown sugar would be enough sweetness, and I'm happy I didn't add it. Also i didn't use olive oil, I used bacon grease instead. ( everything IS better with bacon ) I put the patties in the refridgerator for 4 hrs. and they held together just fine. Nice and spicy without being too hot. This recipe is a keeper

I think I fell in love with this burger at first bite! I really was apprehensive in making this because I thought the flavors would clash-but boy was I wrong! I don't think I will ever make burgers any other way again. I didn't have the problem of it falling apart. Mine were "wet" but that was ok. They were SOOO tasty I didn't even use any mustard or cheese!  Thank You for my new favorite burger recipe !

These are really GOOD! Add chopped onion, bell pepper, and chopped mushrooms,an egg and some cracker crumbs, and this would make an excellent meatloaf too. Two thumbs up!

Wonderful burgers, from the comments of the meat being to "wet" to stay together those cooks must have used regular ground beef not lean ground beef as suggested in the RECIPE. The regular ground beef has too much fat in it to make the burgers stay in tact during cooking. Thanks for the recipe!

Umm...Would make a good meatloaf, but not a good burger for my family.  Ended up grilling some plain hamburgers cause we could not eat.  If you're looking for a meatloaf consistency, though, guess it would work!  Sorry=(

Great flavor, but they completely fell apart. I think I might try this again and add some bread crumbs. It was just a spicy ground beef sandwich.

The "burgers" were tasty but fell apart. I had to make loose meat sandwiches instead. I followed the recipe exact even put then in the fridge for several hours.

Had 1 1/2#'s of burger, so I used that whole amount. Added entire amount of spices. Didn't have any Honey Mustard, so used plain yellow mustard. Did not fall apart for me. Had a bite to them, very good! Nice change of pace from plain burgers.

It had good flavor.  Even cutting the red pepper down to 1/2 tsp., it was still a bit spicy for my 6 year old.  A good variation to the traditional burger.  Made my patties only a few hours before grilling and I did not have trouble with them falling apart.

I really liked this receipe, I made 2 small changes, I reduced the sugar by half and used spicy brown mustard rather than honey mustard cause I did not have any honey mustard on hand. Very good burgers and they definitely need to be chilled before cooking or they will fall apart.

Is the recipe a misprint? Should I have used two pounds of hamburger? There was way too much red pepper, even though I halved it, and way too much brown sugar. I would rate this only one star.

Really good burgers. I would make these again. I didn't use the garlic powder and used cayenne pepper instead of crushed red peppers. I also did it in the oven instead of grill it.

I thought that I had some prettty good hamburger blends that were good. This one is great! For a change I followed the recipe to the letter, next time (this weekend) I will skip the onion powder and mince some onion instead. 
I did assemble the day before and stored in the fridge didn't have any problem with the burgers coming apart.
Thanks for sharing what should be a "secret" recipe. Update: Had a Memorial Day cook out. I did make these up the day prior. Subbed minced onion and garlic for the powder. Everyone said that these were the "best". Maybe because I was the host, but for my "secret" recipe, I got 3 cases of beer in advance. Thanks again for the great burger.

I was skeptical when first reading the ingredients but the rave reviews convinced me to try them.  These are my new favorite burger!  Prepared the exact recipe early in the a.m. and let the mixture sit in the refriderator 12 hours.  No olive oil, just a good spray with PAM in a cast iron skillet and the burgers cooked perfectly, no falling apart.  Great with the Swiss cheese and a King's Hawiian bun.

I dont know if you'll ever come back to this recipe, but for what its worth crushed red pepper is NOT the same as cayenne pepper. Crushed red pepper is pepper flakes, like you shake onto pizza and is far less hot than cayenne!

I was not a fan. First like other reviews the burger just fell apart once cooked.  I halved the pepper flakes n kept the rest the same. For me it was a too sweet, spicy mess. In its defense, my husband liked it but was  equally frustrated that it crumbled apart.

I made this burger with ground turkey instead of ground beef it still turned out great but was to spicy for me. I don't like spicy food though but other then that turned out great! I don't know if it was from using ground turkey but I think next time I will try it with bread crumbs the burgers didn't stay together very well.

I think I would prefer just a little less of the crushed red pepper. Other than that, delicious. I did have a problem with it overcooking at medium in my Tfal stainless steel frying pan. Still haven't got that thing figured out!

I followed the recipe exactly and was not impressed....it was just okay.  And, I'm glad I was not using an outdoor grill, because like others, mine also fell apart....

This burger is awesome.  I didn't have trouble with them falling apart like some other reviewers.  Sweet, spicy (reduce the chili if you don't like spice), juicy, so good!

Excellent burgers! They were tender, juicy, and I didn't have the problem that others had with getting them to stay together! They were a hit at my house. My husband was trying to figure out what was in them : )

I made these tonight but the hamburger patties did not stay together.  The meat crumbled apart in the pan.  We ended up just eating it like a meatloaf sort off and dipping the meat in ketchup.  My husband said he liked the flavor and I thought it was ok but not great.

The grands and I thought this was OK.  But the three other adults said it tasted like strangely flavored meatloaf.  Maybe I will freeze a few for me and the kids.

Everyone loved these burgers.  I did substitute cheddar cheese for swiss cheese. (I never have been a big fan of swiss cheese)  I'm from Missouri too!  And I know a good burger when I taste it! And this is a good burger!

These burgers were the best!  I did cut down on the crushed red pepper (daughter is not a fan of too spicy).  Used "Margaret's Honey Mustard" from this site and American cheese.  These were so good I just topped mine with red onion.

These were really good. I made them with ground turkey for my burgers and ground beef for my husband. I also just used olive oil spray in the pan to cook them and it worked well. These have really good flavor...love the spicy and sweet.

Okay so I think next time I make these I need to follow others suggestion and let the meat sit overnight before grilling. The burgers were so moist they just fell apart which was quite problematic on the grill and in the pan. But my family loved the taste of these and thought they were AWESOME. The did taste good, but were not firm enough for my taste. I will try again though.

This is a very different burger because it's so sweet.  I put my patties together and stuck them in the fridge for about 5 hours before cooking them. We actually grilled them rather than frying.  They were very moist but the sweetness just didn't work for me.  Not bad, just not something I'd make again.

I cut back on the sugar and red pepper by half and made my own honey mustard.  I froze the patties for a few hours before grilling.  These were really good.

Yummy!

I was searching for a new burger recipe that is gluten free, and I do believe this is a keeper!
I substituted ground mustard for the honey mustard and lightened up on the pepper.  Very tasty recipe!

These burgers are absolutely delicious! Easy to make and cooks in no time. I keep reading how people are having issues with them staying together, remember to not put the oil in the meat but instead in the pan. I made that mistake the first time because I wasn't paying attention haha

Also, I prefer my burgers medium so heating your pan to a medium setting and cooking the burgers on each side for 5 minutes and flipping only once works perfectly.

I didn't like this too much. It reminded me of that "sweet meat" heaped on a bed of rice we had to eat in JAIL back in the day. 

Making a burger from the written recipe is impossible.

I combined this with the Juiciest Hamburgers Ever recipe and therefore modified it. I replaced garlic powder with garlic and omitted salt, replacing it with a Cajun spice. Instead of crushed red pepper, I used a chopped Thai chili. Rather than brown sugar and honey mustard, I used 1 tbsp steak sauce (the other recipe called for Worcestershire sauce, which we didn't have, either). The other recipe called for bread crumbs, so I used whole grain bread and added 1 beaten egg. Then I toasted the buns in the oven at 350. I sliced onions instead of using onion powder and provided condiments, including mayo, mustard, and ketchup. We didn't have swiss cheese, so I topped each burger with a slice of pepper jack cheese. The timing was perfect for a well done burger, which is why I needed this recipe (instead of the other one, which called for cooking it on the grill). I flipped them only once. They turned out like gourmet burgers.

Made this recipe this afternoon for football, very good   As I rate 5 stars, made as listed. Had to make 1 change, I used spicy mustard, had no honey mustard. If a recipe needs several changes, not worth trying. The burgers did separate a bit, but a tiny piece on only 2 of them.  This is a keeper.

Absolutely perfect- you don't even need the cheese.  The meat holds the flavor really well- a great combo of sweet and hot.

These are a must have at our house when grilling burgers.  The sweet and spicy combination is perfect.  I add a couple more teaspoons of red pepper flakes because I like them hot.  Delicious!

Loved them.  Great flavor and a nice little bit of heat.  The swiss was perfect with it.  Also, had tomato slices and spinach as a substitute for lettuce.

This sounded a little odd, but it was very good. A bit sweet and a bit hot and the mustard worked well. This did not need any condiments as everything was mixed right in. I added a little bread crumbs as the meat mixture seemed way too wet and it turned out fine. Great burger. My husband would not have liked this one though as it was sweet.

These burgers were excellent. I had a little bit of trouble with them falling apart but I plan on making them the night before next time to fix this. Great recipe!

These are absolutely delicious burgers. While they are browning, I cook dehydrated shiitakes and fresh onions in Worcestershire sauce and serve them on top the patties.  Super nom!

These were great. Used a pound and a half of ground beef. Didn't have honey mustard, so I used a couple of squirts of yellow, and added a little honey. Everyone loved them. Thanks!

Amazing! I was very apprehensive about making these since i don't really favor honey mustard like that, but these were phenomenal. I read some reviews where people complained about the burgers falling apart, so what my boyfriend and I did was prepared them the night before and put them on a cookie sheet covered in plastic wrap. That pretty much took care of them. If you want to flatten the burgers with a spatula, you need to do it early in the cooking process, not when they are about to come out the pan, to avoid them falling apart on you. I do wish I owned a grill, because they would be great grilled as well. When we were mixing the meat with the ingredients, it did seem a little off putting with the mix of things being added, but it gave it a very nice and slight "twang". Let me tell you--delicious! Thank You Aaron!

Different, yes.  Sweet not our taste.  Maybe a hot cheese would counteract the super sweetness of the meat or possibly onion rolls for the buns.  Not requested again.

This was soooo good.  I'm so sick and tired of making plain burgers with just ketchup or barbecue sauce on them, and I didn't want to have them AGAIN.  So I went looking for something different....and these are terrific!  I was a bit leery of the idea of honey mustard and brown sugar in my burger, but it was great.  I didn't have onion powder, so I diced some onion and put that in there too.  Personally, I enjoyed the different texture of the diced onion in the burger and I'll probably make it that way again.  Thanks for the recipe.  This is a winner!

I've been making these burgers since I found the recipe a few years ago. Do have problem with them staying together since the mustard adds a lot of moisture that prevents packing them as tight as they need to be. But they are our favorite burger. We do only use one tsp of crushed red pepper since 2 was too hot for us. I have tried leaving them in the fridge for a while but next time will try the one day method and see if that helps keep them together.

The recipe itself was slightly bland (no offense to the inventor). I had to add quite a few things in there for it to turn out really well. and a good way to hold it together is by adding breadcrumbs and one egg.

WOW!! I followed the recipe exactly as shown, and found the burgers to be very, very good. As soon as I took my first bite, I tasted the sweet and tangy flavors from the ingredients. The surprise came a few second after that first bite. That's when the heat kicked in. If you're not used to some heat from the spices, you might want to reduce the amount of crushed red peppers (or eliminate them altogether). I agree with other reviewers that the burgers do have a tendency to fall apart if you're not careful, but mine managed to stay together. Making the burgers the night before and keeping them in the fridge until time to cook them might help keep them together better.

I modified the add-ins to prevent the ground beef being too wet to stick together, and they came out perfectly. I really didn't need the olive oil in the pan, as they came out a little too greasy, but other than that these are the best burgers I have ever made, or even eaten altogether. I don't think I'll ever make them another way.

Great burgers! Made these with ground Bison. Followed the recipe exactly except omitted the red pepper. I followed others lead and mixed the night before which I believe resulted in the flavors really absorbing into the meat. The pack of Bison I bought was 1.25 lbs. and the mix seemed like I could have cooked right away so maybe the 1 lb quantity in the recipe is why some said the burgers wouldn't hold together. Served them on Pretzel buns. Delicious! Can't wait for warmer weather so we can try them on the grill!

My kids loved these!  The only thing I would change would be to add some binding ingredients.  I use bread crumbs and eggs.  Otherwise they are great!

They were delicious! I didn't make them early, but I did add some bread crumbs which helped them stay together - everyone enjoyed them (even our picky eaters)!

These were ok. They were pretty spicy for the likes of my family. I grilled them on my George Foreman grill (which usually keeps things very juicy) but these were pretty dry. I am not sure if we will try these again but thanks...

We found it to be very hot.  Husband likes hot stuff and it was too much for him-------I only used about 1 teaspoon of the crushed red pepper.  Also, was too sweet for us. Only tasted hot and sweet. Just didn't satisfy a yearning for a good ole hamburger.  Glad the other reviewers liked it.

These were great!  I didn't you too much of the crushed red peppers, since I was cooking for non-spicy lovers, but they were really yummy with swiss cheese!

I cut about 25% of the red pepper flakes out. GREAT!!
