This is one of those recipes that you gather your family or your favorite friend around to help you make so they too can share in the laughs because afterall, it is by far one of the weirdest recipes anyone's yet to see and you just know that nothing good could come of it but it'll sure be a lot of fun concocting the mess and watching it self destruct somewhere along the way.  Well, mixing it up was a real riot--I think my husband and I near cracked a rib from laughing so hard at the mess that was in the bowl...it brought back memories of praying to the porcelain god for sure....:o)  Then we popped in in the oven--and the most amazing thing happened--it actually came out looking like a loaf and it was pretty freakin' tasty--so much so that my carnivore hubby actually took a few slices for lunch one day.  Who knew?
I followed the recipe exactly as stated--I'm not sure why there's so much oil in the recipe but one could easily use less than half of what's called for.  Once you make this loaf--you will quickly start imaginng all the things you could do to it--like swapping out the onion soup mix for something else, added veggies and other seasonings etc.  This recipe is pretty neat and a lot of fun.  I would recommend it to any skeptic.  The ONLY THING IS THAT I HAD TO BAKE IT LONGER--ABOUT AN HOUR UNTIL IT WAS FIRM IN THE MIDDLE...I checked it at 45 mins and it was still jiggly when I shook the pan so I put it back in there for awhile longer.

This recipe is wonderful. I added 1 add'l cup of corn flakes, reduced oil to 1/8 c. and used 2 eggs and 2 egg whites, as well as using lowfat cottage cheese. I baked for 60 min. and it was perfect. My toddler loved it too. Next time, I will add shredded carrots and spinach.

I love this recipe!  It looks just like a paler meatloaf and it tastes like meatloaf, too!  I've made it several times, trying all sorts of variations and I loved it every time.  I tried it with one less egg, with no oil, with no nuts, with cashews, with a half cup of walnuts, with cooked diced peppers mixed in - all of them delicious.  I always made it with at least 2 cups of corn flakes and always with 2% fat cottage cheese.  It came out great everytime - never too mushy.  I even ate it hot out of the oven and the slices held their shape.  I have no idea what could be causing everyone else's problems.  I used a glass loaf pan and cook it for an hour.  I definately recommend the two cups of corn flakes and leaving out the oil.  Three eggs works just fine and if you love nuts, don't leave them out.  They sound odd but it really works.  I loved it with yellow bell peppers mixed in.  I'm going to try green peppers, carrots, onions, and mushrooms - not all at once.  Give this recipe a shot, it's worth it.

This LOOKED just like meatloaf after it was done cooking, but it DID NOT taste just like meatloaf as some others have reviewed.  It smelled wonderful when it was cooking and looked good.  I ate one piece and decided it was too much all-around for me.  I dont care for nuts so the taste of walnuts was too overpowering.  I love cottage cheese and it was not as prominant as I thought it would be due to the name of the roast.  I decided to throw out the rest of the loaf after only one piece.  It was just not for me. I got a strange aftertaste in my mouth.   I was dissapointed, but the only way to know is to try it once, right?

This is probably the cookiest recipe I've ever tried, but man if it didn't just shock the heck out of me and the family... absolutely wonderful!  I did as other reviewers and cut the oil to 1/8 cup and used only 2 eggs.  Also I didn't use a full packet of onion soup mix, half was PLENTY.  I added mushrooms, onions, garlic, and served with mashed taters and mushroom gravy.  Truely a great meatless meal that filled and satisfied us all.  I WILL make this again!  Thanks for sharing!

Although it sounded weird and looked gross, after being prepared it tasted delicious!  The next day it tastes even better!  We added 1 extra cup of cornflakes and green onions and served it with mushroom gravy.  Some chopped mushrooms next time might be good.  Baked for 1 hour.

my mom and i are vegetarian, and she's always asking if i'll make this meatloaf for her! it's so good! i use special k cornflakes, which i grind to a fine powder in my food processor, then i put all of the other ingredients in their and blend until well combined. i've used egg substitute instead of a real egg and it worked well also. this goes great with mashed potatoes! i reccommend baking the meatloaf in two medium sized loaf pans, because having it all in one sometimes takes forever to bake all the way through. cranberry sauce is great with this! thanks!

I was intrigued by this recipe when I came across it due to the novelty factor, and decided I had to try it at least once.  I read a number of the reviews and followed some of the modifications -- extra cup of cornflakes, one less egg, a bit less walnuts, addition of garlic and onion powder, baking time of 50 minutes.  My boyfriend and I had the result for lunch tonight, and we were both amazed by how meatloaf-like and fairly tasty it was.  Next time I will try making my own onion soup mix, however, because the one I bought had a bunch of artificial ingredients and left a weird aftertaste.

This meatless loaf was amazing.  I would never have guess that cottage cheese and cornflakes could make THIS!  I loved it.  I used 2 1/2 cups of cornflakes, 1/8 cup of oil, 1/2 cup of walnuts, and added 1 cup of diced onions, green peppers, & mushrooms.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  It's wonderful.  Hardens after sitting a bit.  Can't wait to eat leftovers cold on a sandwich.

I really loved this. I was intrigued by the unusual combo of ingredients. I left out the oil completely and it was just fine. The only addition I made was to add garlic. Next time I make this, I think some chopped spinach would be yummy in the loaf. I did top this with a mixture of ketchup and tabasco sauce before baking and I did bake for one hour. I didn't eat this hot, since it was swelting here. It was very close to meatloaf, but not quite.. which was fine by me.

In case anyone else has the inclination to shape this like a meatloaf in a casserole dish, don't.  Apparently, it says "spoon" into loaf pan for a reason, otherwise it will spread out flat!  Now that that's established, on to the review.  This was yummy, and tastes very much like a meatloaf (as vegetarianly possible).  I also added, and highly recommend, chopped celery, onion, and carrot... adds texture and gives it more of a savory flavor.  I also omitted the walnut's so the added veggies made up for the crunch without blowing a hole in my wallet.  I left out the oil too (didn't and still don't see its purpose), only used 3 eggs, and threw in another handful of cornflakes.  Thanks for the vegetarian comfort food!

Okay, I never take the time to review a recipe, but I was looking for some type of a meat dish to fix for Thanksgiving dinner for my vegetarian kids, and the reveiws for this were so good I had to give it a try.  And after trying, I had to review it!  I am totally impressed, and can't wait for my kids to try it.  After reading some of the other reviews, I did alter it slightly.  First of all, I used my food processor and creamed fat free cottage cheese, b/c that's what I had.  Then I used it to chop up about 3/4 c. of almonds, b/c that's what I had.  I also used it to finely chop corn flakes, until I had 2 1/2 c.  I only added about 2 T. oil and 1/2 pkg onion soup mix.  I put it all in the food processor, added a little steak dust, some Kitchen Bouquet and a little liquid smoke and some bbq sauce and garlic pepper.  Mixed it all well, poured into 2 smaller loaf pans, baked at 350 35 min, put a little more bbq sauce on top and broiled 5 min.  Took it out, cooled it, and was WOWED with how much it tasted like meat loaf.  I was a little concerned about the almonds, but like another reviewer said, I think it gives it more that beefy texture.  Don't be afraid to try this recipe.  It can be altered a lot of ways, but it surprisingly delicious!  Next time, I may add some veggies just for more nutrition.  Thank you, Kittyann!

Despite the scores of reviews telling me so, I was still surprised when this interesting mix of ingredients turned into something impressive!  
In lieu of own 'onion soup' mix to make it a bit more natural...I used 2ts thyme, a vege boullion cube, 1/2 c diceed onion & 2tb dried onion.  Following the advice of another reviewer, I also brushed the top with ketchup/BBQ sauce in the last 10 mins of baking.  
Thanks for posting - a definite 5 stars!

We love this!  I make quite a few changes but I wanted to rate it anyway because it's a great base recipe that you can tweak to your liking!  The only thing I didn't care for the first time was the walnuts so I leave them out now and add extra veggies for texture -onions, carrots, bell pepper and mushrooms along with a few good squirts of ketchup and BBQ sauce.  I use fat-free cottage cheese (blended), about 3 c bran flakes, egg beater (whites) and omit the oil.  I top it with sliced tomatoes with a little pepper on top.  I've even added 1/2 c cooked quinoa & some chia seed with great results!  My version takes about 1 1/2 hrs to cook through and firms up as it cools.  Thanks KITTYANN for a great recipe!

This unusual meat subsitute was great!  My family loved it.  I used Total cereal and added a whole chopped onion and increased the baking time to one hour.  My husband liked the "meat" cold on a sandwich. Thanks Mary Ann.

This is certainly an interesting dish.  It was okay, and I certainly was impressed by the appearance.  My store did not sell creamed cottage cheese, so I used low fat small curd cottage cheese.  My husband said he thought it tasted like meatloaf, and my 13 year old daughter said she would not have known is was not meatloaf if I didn't tell her (after she tried it and liked it.)  I added two cups of crushed corn flakes, but followed the recipe otherwise.  I made a brown gravy to go with it.  If you would like this to taste more like your meatloaf I recommend omitting the onion soup mix and adding the seasonings that you would normally use to make your meatloaf.  I liked the onion soup mix.  You could also add ketchup or BBQ sauce to the top.  On a side note I really dislike walnuts but you do not taste the flavor in this.  I think the walnuts give it the meatloaf look.  I did chop mine very fine.  If you feel like trying something different, give it a try.

Wow, this is increDibly good for meatless meatloaf.  I subsituted the oil with a small can of tomato sauce and one time I made it I used pistachios for the nuts.  I've also added taco seasoning, you can really play with it, it's a great base.  It's a good meatloaf, my kids didn't even know it didn't have any meat in it and they were surprised when I told them after dinner.
My local grocery store marks the big containers of cottage cheese down to 79 cents on the sell by date, so now I buy them and make 2 loaves at once, eating one for dinner and saving the other for sandwiches. This makes dinner very inexpensive so THANK YOU!
I would suggest increasing the amount of cornflakes by a cup or so and let it sit for a few minutes after cooking as it will firm up more as it cools.

The lone meat-eater in the house proclaims the to be the best meatless meatloaf he's had yet.  I've even used a traditional brown sugar/ketchup glaze in the bottom of the pan once or twice to make it more authentic and it works just fine. Super quick and easy to throw together

I am always on the lookout for vegetarian dinner ideas that are protein packed. I decided to try this one even though I was weary of how it would turn out. I followed the directions exactly except I used low fat cottage cheese. It looked horrible mixed up as I put it in the loaf pan. It smelled great as it was cooking and when pulled out of the oven looked exactly like meatloaf. I did not tell my kids that this wasn't my usual meatloaf recipe. Everyone at the table ate it up and more! They raved about how great it tasted and asked what I had done differently! The meatloaf was moist and there was no one flavor that stood out to over power the overall taste. I am so excited I found this recipe, thanks for sharing KittyAnn! This will be made again and again in our house!

I have been making this recipe for years and it is fantastic!  It looks, smells and tastes just like a traditional meatloaf.  I prefer to make my own version of "onion soup mix" to limit the sodium & to incorporate fresh onions into the mixture.  During the final 10 minutes of cooking, I brush the top with ketchup and increase the oven heat to 500 degrees.  This creates a nice, caramelized topping.  Enjoy!

I am only giving this recipe 3 stars because it was way to salty for my taste.  I will definitely make this recipe again, but I will probably only use 1/2 the onion soup mix and maybe add 1/2 cup sauteed onions.

Well, my rating comes with a huge asterisk.  I omitted the oil, except about 1 Tbsp which I used to saute about 6 oz. of chopped portobello mushrooms in before combining with the other ingredients.  I only used 3 eggs, 2 Cups of cornflakes,and it was very good.  Lots of my friends who are vegetarians or have gluten allergies really liked it, too.  Recently, I was out of onion soup mix, so instead I used: 1 tsp Better than Bouillon, chicken flavor (it's like a stock concentrate), 1 Tbsp minced dried onion, 1 tsp McCormick Italian blend of seasoning (mine has Marjoram, Thyme, Rosemary, Savory, Sage, Oregano and Basil), 1 tsp Worcesteshire sauce, 1 tsp garlic salt. I liked this even better, because it wasn't as salty, but still had lots of flavor. The reviews about it looking terrible are true, but the taste really is worth it.  I first used it when I needed a vegetarian meal that could be prepared ahead and frozen to take to a friend.  It worked great.

I love making "meat" entrees, but I was really skeptical about this one. It turned out great though! I didn't have dry onion soup mixed or dried onions so I substituted a couple teaspons of garlic powder, onion powder, 21 seasoning salute and 1 onion instead. I chopped the onion in a food processor, strained it, and then baked it for a few minutes so it wouldn't add excess moisture.  Very good recipe- will definitely make again :)

Excellent and filling! You may say it's even better than meatloaf, as it lacks that unpleasant after-taste meat can have. I used 2 cups cereal (un-crunched), only 1 tbs. oil, and only 3/4 cups of chopped walnut (to cut out fat). Baked for about 60 minutes. Thank you Mary Ann!!

This definitely doesn't taste like meat, but I eat mostly vegetarian so I didn't care.  Personally, I thought this was a 3 star recipe as is, but I did make a few changes.  I used home-made onion soup mix, and I processed all of the ingredients in the food processor.  I am going to make this again, but when you google "cottage cheese roast" there are quite a few other recipes that call for special k.  Next time I'm going to only process the walnuts and try just mixing the ingredients.  While it did taste good, it kind of tasted like stuffing.  I'm definitely going to try this one again with some modifications.

I tried this and have fallen in love with it. You have to try it if you like a "meat loaf" kind of mid west, diner, comfort food. I baked it for 60 min. in a loaf pan, recipe as written. It would be great with green beans, gravy, roll, and apple pie.

This was so easy and everyone loved it.  Including my skeptical meat-eating DH.  I didn't have enough corn flakes so used plain bread crumbs with extra cottage cheese.

Excellent recipe. Great vegetarian substitute for meatloaf night.  I substitute wheaties for the cornflakes to make the recipe whole grain.  The flavor is incredible, even with 50% less sodium onion soup mix!

I love eating meat, but I realise it's not really healthy to eat it every day. So, living alone as I do, I had ruled out meatloaf out of my menus (try do it for any less than 4 portions!). I am quite glad about this recipe. The only things that leave room for improvement in it were my own fault, as my cottage cheese wasn't creamed, and I didn't really crush the walnuts as much as I should have. Also, I used some herb infused oil but won't bother next time, as I couldn't really taste the spices. But the recipe is all in all easy and tasty. Oh, by the way, following other readers advice I used a full cup of cereal for four portions. I'm really looking forward to start tinkering with this recipe. Sun dried tomatoes? Mushrooms? Pepper? Chickpeas? Another type of nuts? Olives? Mmmmmmmm...

This is a fantastic recipe. I became a vegetarian at the age of 10 in part because I hated meatloaf and decided to tell my mom I wasn't going to eat meat anymore to get out of finishing my dinner- now I have a great meatloaf alternative to enjoy! I have made this recipe on numerous occasions and finally joined allrecipes.com so I could rate it. I was wary at first because the combination of ingrediants sounds odd, but it is delicious. My meat-eating husband and toddler son love it. I have made it with the dry onion soup mix and with meatloaf seasoning and both are tasty. I also increase the baking time per other suggetions to closer to 50 minutes. The key though is making sure you let it cool sufficiently, otherwise it will be a little soft when you cut it.

This was surprisingly really good.  I used Grapenuts Flakes instead of Cornflakes.  I also cooked it for an hour. I would definitely make this again. Next time I'm going to use a meatloaf seasoning packet instead of the onion soup mix, and add onions, garlic, and chopped canned mushrooms.

I tried this three different times, which was two times too many.  Maybe I'm to used to the texture & flavor of meat.
The cook time was way longer than suggested & I ended up finishing it in the microwave because the children had been waiting for so long.

Great recipe.  Thanks for the tips: used an extra cup of cornflakes (uncrushed), topped with ketchup, and served with cranberry sauce and potatoes.  A big success!

As a fairly novice vegetarian, this recipe is great 'comfort' food.  Thanks, Mary Ann, for sharing it, and to all reviewers for the great suggestions (e.g. 1 C additional cereal, increase bake time to 1 hour, additional onions, etc.).

Loved it - all the teachers at school tried it and loved it - kids wouldn't even touch it.  (More for me!!)  Used 2.5 cups corn flakes and hubby used a shallow casserole dish instead of a loaf pan.  Fantastic!

Wow!  I have seen this recipe several times, but was always scared to make it.  Sounds really icky.  But it was great!  My husband even loved it!  It really does taste like meatloaf!  I added chopped onions and garlic, used 2 1/2 c Special K, put ketchup on the top and cooked for 65 min. This is a keeper!

This recipe sounded awful, and probably looks worse when cooked - BUT.....Its actually delicious. As a 28yr old male, there's not many veggie recipes that have been that great, but for simplicity, taste and novelty, def give this a go.

My Vegatarian husband and I love this recipe as do our meat eater friends who we made this for as well. they were amazed that this was not a traditional meat-loaf and even  asked for the recipe to make at home :) It really is amazingly 'meaty' but  its hard to believe cottage cheese and cornflake mush can produce this  untill you actually see and smell the finished product .
This has become a new staple  entree  . I add a 1/4 cup each  of finely chopped onion and bell peppers to this recipe and top it with a layer of ketchup just the way my husband likes it :) I also use more corn flakes than the original recipe called for and let it set for 15 minutes before serving .

Heaven knows what kind of alchemy is at work when you put into the oven what looks like Breakfast Gone Horribly, Horribly Wrong, and pull out something that both looks and tastes as meaty as meatloaf can.  Our family of five ate the lot with gravy and mash, and I still haven't told them it had no meat!  One weird thing, however:  even though I used a nonstick pan and greased it, the mixture still stuck.  I'll be making it again, although next time I'll be adding some of our usual meatloaf seasonings (real onion, garlic, tomato paste, etc.)

We are not vegetarians but I wanted to try this recipe out of curiosity...it was really good!  I called it meatloaf and no one questioned it.  My daughter, who would never eat cottage cheese had seconds.  I used the extra corn flakes and only half the oil.  Will make again, thanks.

Wow! What a great surprise this recipe was. My husband, who loves real meatloaf said it was so close to the real deal he could hardly tell. I added chopped onion, garlic and mushrooms. I served this with homemade mushroom gravy, roasted potatoes and steamed broccoli- what an amazing meal. The leftovers make awesome sandwiches too! Thanks so much for the recipe!

5 stars for given ingredients.  This is cheap, quick, and easy for a family supper.  Next time i will add ketchup over top like a traditional meatloaf.

This was really really good!!  I used rolled oats instead of cornflakes and reduced the oil to 2 Tbsp, used pistachios because it's what I had and it was really great.  Did cook of an hour and it turned out perfectly.  Next time I will try adding "meatloafy" seasoning like onion and garlic, steak spice and worchestershire sauce!  Very Satisfying!

Sorry! No rating!  In order to post I had to rate it-should be a minus one star.  I'm not a vegetarian but I thought I would make this as a side dish instead of potatoes. I thought it would taste like meatloaf but it didn't come close.  All I could taste was the onion mix and walnuts.

This recipe has been a favorite of mine since I found it here 8 years ago. I've served it to meat eaters and vegetarians and both seem to love it!

Love it! I Dont use any oil to cut down on fat and also use only 1/2 cup nuts to cut fat and calories. 2 cups of cereal works better for me.(I use Special K). I also added onions and peppers for more flavor. I will play with spices next time i make it. Italian seasoning with garlic salt would be great and top it with ketchup, brown sugar and worchestershire sauce.

This was great!  So much more flavor than i expected!  I put half a red onion and a red bell pepper in ours and it tasted great. I think it would be good without, and I probably won't put the red pepper in again, but everyone loved it.  Our german exchange student even asked for the recipe to take home since she's a vegetarian and this was a great new recipe.

I have been trying to make a meatless meat loaf for my husband all our married life and finally - success! He loved this recipe. I followed other reviewers suggestions and adjusted the recipe a bit (less oil, more cornflakes, no walnuts, added frozen chopped spinach, garlic powder & crushed red pepper flakes). I also had to bake it for about an hour & twenty minutes. We will make this again & again. Thank you for a great idea!

YUM. i wanted to make this as healthy as possible, so i just used a dash of oil, nonfat cottage cheese, and egg whites.  i don't like walnuts, so i replaced them by adding about half a cup of more cornflakes.  i could seriously eat this entire thing tonight.

BUT FOR A GOOD TAKE ON THE SAME RECIPE I USED CARMALIZED ONIONS  INSTEAD OF SOUP MIX, LITTLE KETCHUP  AND A  CUPCAKE TIN.. TOPPED WITH KETCHUP AND A LITTLE BROWN SUGAR AND THEY ARE TO DIE FOR..GOOD HOT OR COLD.. COOKING TIME ALOT LESS, AND BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK AT.

Because I changed it a bit. I'm only giving it 4 stars.  Wow!  Even my carniverous man couldn't believe it was meatless.  I don't use onion soup mix (way too much sodium) so I used what I put in my real meatloaf-finely chopped onion (1/2 cup), ketchup (2 Tbsps.), mustard (1 Tbsp), and worcestershire sauce (1 Tbsp.)I also used 2 1/2 cups cornflakes as another reviewer suggested and only 2 Tbsps. oil  Baked for a full hour. Let it sit for a while so it sets.  Will make over and over again, especially when I can get the reduced price cottage cheese.

This was just as all the five-star reviewers described:  Absolutely delicious and loved by every member of my family, including my meat-loving husband who didn't realize it was meatless.  Can't wait to make it again and again!

Freakin' awesome!  We're trying to live a little healthier and save a few $$ by eating one vegetarian meal a week.  My husband was revolted at first when I told him what was in it, so much so that he decided he would just skip dinner the night I made this.  However, when he saw how much the kids dug it, he tried it was shocked at how much it really tastes like meatloaf.  He even asked me if I made meatloaf and was just kidding about the cottage cheese roast.  My carnivourous buch loved it!

This was wonderful.  I used Special K cereal,5 eggs instead of 4, only 2 TLBS of oil, 4 Tlbs catsup, extra onion, green pepper and worcheschier sauce.  I ground the nuts in the food processor. I would put parchment paper in the loaf pan for easier removal.  Spread a mixture of catsup and BBQ sauce over the top 1/2 way through the baking process.

How the heck can this concoction be so darn good? My husband really liked this one. He was surprised at how much it resembled meatloaf - especially after I told him the ingredients. After reading reviews, I used 2 1/2 cups of cornflakes. I also cooked the roast for 65 minutes, then let it sit for 30 more minutes before serving. I don't think I'd change anything else, except perhaps I might chop up a little bit of veggies to go in it - like red pepper. 
Neither of us thought it was too salty. 
That onion soup flavor did stay with me throughout the evening, though. 
Oh, yeah, even my 2 year old liked this!

Okay, so this came out really mushy and salty - even after 24 hours in the fridge.  Almost like a savory bread pudding.  BUT, I just cut it thin and used it like scrammbled egg in a breakfast burrito and it was pretty good.  I wrapped it with salsa, basil and mushrooms in a wheat tortilla.  Try this if yours comes out like mine  :-)

This recipe makes a pretty convincing "meat"loaf, but doesn't really require all that oil. I found that the finished product tasted much better with some chunky salsa on top.

It's true!  This actually came out really well!  I sprinkled a little garlic powder in with the ingredients and used 2 1/2 cups of Special K.  Also, I used pecans instead of walnuts because it was easier to find them already minced.  I'll try it again!

I made this out of curiousity: I enjoy the taste of meatloaf but I am very grossed out by ground beef.

This wonder of alchemy is delicious!!  My fiance came home from work and couldn't leave it alone.

Like other reviewers, I added 2 1/2 cups of crushed cereal.

I love this recipe!  Add about an extra cup of cornflakes (I crush them first) and some fresh chopped onion and garlic....YUM!  I do have to say that I don't think it will fool red meat eaters, but its absolutely delicious in its own right!

This is an excellent tasting main dish!  I can't believe how good it is.  I've been eating vegetarian for about 6 months and this is the closest thing to meat that I've had.  My non-vegetarian family also liked it!  The only thing I might change would be the name...When I first saw "Cottage Cheese Roast", I thought yuk.  Maybe Mock Meat Loaf or something similar would be better.  I will make this on a regular basis...EXCELLENT!!!

I've also had this as a child, coming from a family with many Adventists. My only variation, is that I add a little of the Gravy Master browning seasoning to give it a more savory flavor and it comes out great!

Some of my recommendations include substituting the onion soup mix with McKay's Chicken or Beef Seasoning and switching chopped walnuts for chopped almonds.  In fact, pick your favorite nut and you won't go wrong.  If your into soy sauce, add a teaspoon to give the roast a great flavor.  It is also better if you chop fresh onion instead of the soup mix.  Cut back on the oil used.  In fact, try frying the onions for 1-2 minutes in butter.  Also, when baking, it is always best to bake the roast an hour.  If your worried about burning it, turn down the temperature to 300 degrees for the last 10-15 minutes.  Experimenting with different flavors is the best.  I tried this recipe and as good as it is, it can be improved with a little tweaking.

I make it with these variations and bake it at 350* for 1 hour & 10 minutes - let cool at least 10 minutes before slicing:
  2               cups  cottage cheese
  2               eggs 
  1                cup  walnuts -- chopped
  4               cups  Special K cereal
  3               Tbs.  margarine -- melted
     1/2       package  onion soup mix
     1/2          tsp.  sage
     1/2          tsp.  thyme
     1/8          tsp.  pepper

I've made this dozens of times and can't believe I've never reviewed it. This is one of my favorite things to make when I want comfort food. I usually make smashed potatoes and mushroom gravy to go along with it. I've made it several different ways including using low fat cottage cheese. But when I want a special treat I use the 4%. Usually use Italian style panko breads crumbs instead of corn flakes only because I never have corn flakes in the house. Sometime I use 3 eggs, sometimes 4.  Haven't really noticed much difference. Sometimes I add ketchup or tomato sauce. It doesn't taste like meat loaf but being a vegetarian I don't want it to. Makes a great cold sandwich the next day.

I made this recipe as stated the first several times, and rated it on the original recipe. I loved it.  Meatloaf is one of the foods I missed when I became a vegetarian. I was hesitant to try it the first time since the ingredients are so strange, but I am glad I did. I have made some changes with the recipe in order to cut down on the sodium level.  I use low sodium cottage cheese, and use only 1/2 envelope of onion soup mix, and then add more dried onions.  I add chopped cooked mushrooms also, mainly because I love mushrooms and used to put them in my "meat" meatloaf.   Makes great sandwiches the next day.

This was really fantastic. I added a chopped onion and a cup of chopped mushrooms. When i make this next,  I  will grind the walnuts to a powdered consistency instead of hand chopping them. Honestly, it was really just the walnuts that would have definitely tipped off someone that it was definitely not some kind of meat. I also would have added some Worcester sauce and more seasoning, as it did cook down a bit bland. But, it is moist, and has amazing potential to be customized to suit nearly any palate. A really awesome recipe!

This is a recipe that allows you to eat onion soup mix without feeling too guilty. That said, we kind of like things like onion soup mix, so we liked this recipe, which, other than sodium content (which I'm just guessing is high), seems pretty healthy and filling. It actually did feel like meatloaf, although it was not all THAT good (sorry, but I LOVE meatloaf), but I may try some adjustments with it. Certainly worth making it again. I am eager to try it in the form of a sandwich with mayo and lettuce. My husband who is German (read:  meat and potatoes!) also liked it. Our first attempt did not slice well, but I didn't tell my husband that the pile on his plate looked like cat food. It didn't taste like it, and if we can get it to slice properly: WIN. Grind the walnuts up pretty fine. I didn't mind them but noted the pieces that were larger and would have preferred the smaller pieces to add to the firmer texture of the whole loaf.

I cut this recipe in half, used chopped pecans as I didn't have any walnuts and only used a tsp. of olive oil in place of the vegetable oil. It ended up needing 50 minutes to bake.It was so amazing, I couldn't quit eating it. Next time I'm going to try it with chopped cooked spinach and carrots.

I liked the concept of this recipe.  I tried it "as is", which is only fair if you're going to write a review, IMO.    I do think it needs tweaking (seasoning, some diced fresh veggies, maybe some nutritional yeast) and will be looking over the other reviews for suggestions.  In fairness, there is considerable confusion over the amount of cornflakes.   Several reviewers said they used from 1/2 to 1 cup of additional cornflakes, and some said they used crushed or even pulverized cornflakes.   The measure of cornflakes is going to be vastly different depending on whether you are measuring them loose from the box or pulverized, which reduces them to less than half.  Also, the mention of "creamed cottage cheese" threw me (as it seems to have done with others).   I since learned that this simply means full 4% fat, or "regular" cottage cheese.  Not low-fat or dry curd.   I see no need to cut down on the eggs.  As is, it only contributes 1/2 an egg per serving.  Ditto the oil.  On a per serving basis, that's not all that much, and choosing a heart-healthy oil such as sunflower or light olive, and you needn't greatly reduce or eliminate this ingredient as many have done.   I didn't think a full envelope of onion soup mix was too salty, but be aware that there is sometimes a big difference in the salt content from brand to brand.  The generics tend to have more salt to save manufacturing cost.

I have been a vegetarian for a number of years and usually depend on the Bocca/Morning Star veggie meals.  I could not believe the ingredients and was just surprised enough to decide to try it.  I cannot thank you enough for this wonderful recipe.  I have made it several times and will now keep it on hand as I like it so well.  I have some in the freezer now.  I know you can add other ingredients, green peppers, bread crumbs, tomato sauce, etc, but it is GREAT just like it is. It deserves 10 stars. Again I thank you for sending this wonderful recipe.  Do you have any more good ones?

Surprisingly good as has been mentioned multiple times.
I made it for dinner and then I made it for dessert too by substituting the onion soup mix for some brown sugar and cocoa powder.  That was also pretty good.  I will use less nuts next time I make it.

Yep. Strangest sounding ingredient list ever, but a really simple, versatile, forgiving, and extremely tasty finished product. We loved it. We added more flakes and ground half in the food processor, added some fresh garlic, some dried veggie soup mix in addition to the onion soup mix, some pepper, less oil. I really don't like when people rate a recipe after making a million changes, but in this case, I feel like I am rating it not on the fact that I had to make changes, but on the fact that I could without losing the basic thing that I started with. What flavors to you like to incorporate into your meatloaf? What veggies might you shred into the mix? What broth or soup mix or seasoning do you feel like playing with? Do it. We loved this. Oh, and another reviewer said that it was good with cranberry sauce....we just happened to be making this as a non-meat option to go with a roast turkey. It made a GREAT meatloaf sandwich, heating with a touch of mayo and some cranberry sauce on a nice multigrain dark bread. Man.....if I wasn't so full...

UPDATE: We have made this several times now. Decided against the veggie soup mix - added an odd flavor. However, it's great with shredded carrots, other veggies of choice. One time we (by which I mean I) forgot it was in the oven and overcooked it by like a half-hour or more - WHOOPS!! Well, we only liked it more. It's so good!

This was ready in 40 minutes in a 400 degree convection oven and was nicely browned. I added chopped mushrooms and 1 extra cup cornflakes to absorb the mushroom liquid. It was very tasty, but a little salty with the onion soup. In the future, I'd consider using 1/2 the onion soup and/or other seasonings.

I love this! I left out the oil, used only 2 eggs, and half the package of onion soup mix. The walnuts add a wonderful crunch.

I am really impressed! My husband said he couldn't believe it. It was really good. I give it 5 stars for sure. I didn't put in the oil and it was fine. Didn't even miss it.

This was pretty good if you like things to taste "meaty", although being someone who doesn't use a lot of prepackaged seasoning like the dried onion soup, I thought it was a little heavy on the salt.  It was really quick and easy, though, and considerably healthier than the meat alternative!  I didn't put the oil in like other's suggested and it was just fine.  I didn't have enough walnuts to make a full cup, and I think I would have liked more, but my husband thought they were weird and didn't like them in there at all, so I probably won't put them in next time.

I didnt have any cornflakes. The closest thing I had was shredded wheat. This was very interesting. I tried to keep the seasonings to what was on the recipe, but I really wanted to add something... anything.... but I just wasnt sure what the flavor was going to be. I also used olive oil, and I had to make my own onion soup mix.  It was okay for our first meatless dish.

Oh my goodness!  This is the most amazingly delicious dish I've had in a very very long time.  I just tried the recipe for the first time a month ago, and I've made it 3 times since!  Yummy yummy yummy!

And I like to call it a Nut Loaf instead of Cttage Cheese Roast. :)

The original recipe, as far as I know, has 1/3 C chopped onion too which makes it even better. I love this recipe with that added onion and an equal amount of chopped green pepper and i\a big squirt of catsup. It is awesome when its room temp and  when its cold. It makes the best meatloaf sandwich.
I don't add any oil at all and its great!

This was delicious.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I used Lipton's onion soup mix, and it made it too salty.  Next time, I'll cut back on the soup mix.

I've been a vegetarian for years and my meat-eater hubby and I both really liked this. My husband even asked me to put this into our rotation of dinner entrees.

It is the weirdest combination of ingredients and I did use an allrecipes.com dry onion soup mix recipe to eliminate the beef bullion.

My picky vegetarian kids did not care for this, but maybe if I serve it a few more times they will.

Like so many others, it was hard to believe that this would turn out to be anything worth eating.  I cut the recipe in half (worried that it might really be yuck, even though it had good reviews) and processed the nuts and the cereal to make sure it wasn't too chunky. Because I'm a person that likes more spicy food, I added a bit of ketchup to the mix, pepper, garlic powder, celery powder. I just tasted it and oh, my goodness, folks were right, it is good!!  I'm still shaking my head in disbelief.  This is a perfect recipe for me and leftovers will be used for sandwiches. The texture, consistency and look is just like meatloaf.  I'm not sure why others had problems with the consistency, no problems for me. Now that I made it, I'll probably do some more additions next time i.e. instead of using the dry soup mix, just make up my own mix with less salt. This is a keeper!

I recently went vegetarian and it's very challenging finding something that can give you the satisfaction of meat without a horrible aftertaste. I didn't chop my walnut fine enough and it gave a weird texture but that didn't stop me from eating it. Next time I will pulse them in the food processor. This recipe is a keeper. I will be slicing some in the morning and putting it on the griddle to eat with some eggs and fried potatoes. Thanks for sharing.

Yes this does sound like a weird combo but it actually works. I left out the oil , used egg whites, and used 2% cottage cheese to make it low fat. I used regular corn flakes and no nuts. I put everything in a food processor until it was a little less chunky and put it in a casserole dish. My boyfriend thought it smelled good when cooking and I ate it the next day for dinner. Not bad, but I would only use HALF of the onion soup mix and taste it before using the whole packet. I found mine to be a bit too salty. I think it would be cool to puree some carrots in this or use spinach or even mix in brocoli to the mixture. Tasty and vegan!

THIS WAS AWESOME!  I was so skeptical.  I creamed the cottage cheese in the blender.  I also put the walnuts in the blender.  I lowered the amount of oil.  I used a recipe online for the onion mix 4 tsp. instant beef bouillon granules
8 tsp. dried onion
1 tsp. onion powder
1/4 tsp. celery seed or celery salt

Equals 1 package store bought Lipton onion soup mix.

What do I say that has not already been said. For those who gave it a bad rating guess you need to look at a recipe and first decide if the ingrediants match your taste. If you don't like walnuts then this is not the dish for you. My opinion, always look at a recipe as a guide not an absolute. Thank you Kittyann for a fun and delicious recipe.

Great recipe, but too salty for me. The consistancy was great and the combination of ingredients was wonderful, but perhaps next time I'll fry my own onions and season myself with pepper and italian blend or something. Thanks for the unique combo!

This was excellent.  We were raised vegetarians and this is very similar to our "Family recipe" for "cottage cheese burgers".  The only change I made was to add garlic and some red pepper flakes. Thanks for the recipe.

Not my favorite. I added some sliced cooked mushrooms and green onions to the mix and used chopped mixed nuts, since it's what I had on-hand. Not very meatloaf-y, but reasonably tasty.  Just not what I was expecting.

At first I was hesitant to try this dish but my husband and even my KIDS RAVED at how wonderful it turned out.  Of course, I did not tell them that the meatloaf they were eating had no MEAT in it until they commented how much they liked it.  My 10 year old wants it all the time now.

This is surprisingly good, actually.  It's obviously not as good as Mom's meatloaf, but tasty all the same.  I used low fat cottage cheese (small curd) and almonds chopped as finely as possible in place of the walnuts.  Also seasoned as I would a traditional meatloaf.  My favorite veg meatloaf is still Amy's frozen one, though.  Yum!

All I can say is wow.  We JUST ate this and although we still can't figure out what possesed us to try it, we really did like it.  I'm getting ready to pack the leftovers for my lunch tomorrow. I didn't realized it said "creamed" cottage cheese until I got home from the store w/small curd.  Dunno know if it's the same or not, but it worked.  We did the ketchup/BBQ mixture over the top.  Can't find loaf pan so used round glass casserole dish.

I made this for my parents last night, and was a litle apprehensive as my dad is an avid meat-eater and dislikes cottage cheese. At first, I didn't tell my parents what was in the roast, but once I saw they liked it, I told them the ingredients. They were both taken aback to discover something SO delicious had cottage cheese in it. I did substitute the soup mix for a chopped onion and cut the oil in half. You could not tell the difference. Delicious and EASY!

Brilliant! What a nice surprise. I agree that this is even better cold, the next day. Really tastes like meat loaf. I would definitely recommend letting this "sit" for a good 30 minutes after it comes out of the oven. I plan to experiment with substitutes for the onion soup mix, as I find it has a distinctive taste that's too salty MSG-infused for me--although that could be the brand I used. Don't want to give up the convenience of the super-fast prep, though. I will be making this regularly.

This was amazing!! I didn't have any walnuts, but it was still deliscious without them.  Next time I'll try and use less oil, not that it tasted like there was too much, but just to cut out some fat.  I am not a vegetarian, but I'd eat this as a healthy alternative to meatloaf anytime!

I followed some of the others' suggestions and added 2 more cups of corn flakes.  I also used only 2 eggs, added 1/2 of a chopped onion, and topped the loaf with ketchup.  I'll definitely be making this again.

This is definitely not for everyone!  It was good, but I don't eat a lot of meat.  I'm not sure a true meat-lover would go for this as a substitute.  I actually preferred this dish when it was served cold!

I winner with my carnivorous family!  I secretly replaced our usual meatloaf with the meatless wonder and everybody raved...only my 2yr old noticed a few cottage cheese curds which she loved.

I too added  ~1c addl cornflakes and coated it with ketchup before baking.

This was sooo easy and delicious! I halved the recipe and made it in a mini-loaf pan, because I wasn't sure my husband would like it. He was so disappointed when he was looking for seconds and there weren't any!! I will definitely make this again soon and a whole recipe this time!! :)

This was different and very good. It is amazing how much this looked and tasted like meatloaf. I will definitely use an onion mix that is low sodium.

I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor and texture of this recipe.  It gives me another vegetarian recipe to add to my list of "good tasting" meatless recipes.  My husband won't eat any other kind.

I read all the reviews before I printed this one and finally gave in to my curiosity.  I HATED IT!  I added the extra cornflakes, I baked it longer in the oven, I did all that.  Maybe it was the walnuts (which belong in cookies, brownies, etc. in my opinion) and maybe, just maybe, I will try it again with pecans...but I thought this recipe was awful, sorry.

This is SOOO good! My husband prefers this now over regular meatloaf. We like it cold in sandwiches the next day too. Ground sage or poultry seasoning really improves the flavor. I also used Special K cereal instead of cornflakes. We like a drier roast, so I just added more cereal to balance out the moistness of the cottage cheese. Yum!

Great, easy recipe - with 4 eggs it's quiche like in texture; the nuts give a meaty illusion; the onion soup mix provide a great flavor.  Pair it with mashed potatoes and a veggie and it makes a great meal ! yum !

I made a double batch as my contribution to a potluck (8 people) at which I was the only vegetarian. There was only 1/2 a slice left at the end (a chicken dish had more left over). Many compliments on it.
Like any 'meatloaf', feel free to customize and make it your own. My 3 suggestions: be sure to check the size of the onion soup mix you buy (the one I bought was double the weight); if you aren't a salt-aholic you may want to cut back on the onion soup (I found it a little too salty); allow extra time for baking.
Finally, this makes fabulous meatloaf sandwiches!

This recipe sounded so gross to me, but I was dead wrong. It definitely improved the second time I made it; I cut the oil and soup mix in half and that made the flavor much less overbearing.

Overall a really good vegetarian "meat" loaf. I'd give it a 4 except that my husband isn't a big fan. Though I suspect that's only because he's expecting meatloaf and the flavor doesn't quite match his expectations.

I use 2-2 1/2 cups cornflakes and pecans instead of walnuts. My husband is a meat eater and was laughing at me when I found this childhood favorite and made it. He changed his tune after eating it! It's good sliced and fried in a little egg if there is any left day 2!

If I could give this more stars, I would.  There's no way anyone could predict how perfect this veggie meatloaf is based on the weird ingredients and the minimal time and effort needed to put it together. My modifications were using just plain 2% lowfat cottage cheese instead of creamed cottage cheese, using 2 cups of cornflakes as others have suggested, and baking for an hour.

Well, I just had to try. After reading reviews- I cut back on oil & increased the cornflakes. We had a laugh w/ ingredients + appearance along the way. Baked for 55min. Taste /texture will fool you. Very good!

Wow! I admit, I was skeptical about this, but I've been switching my cooking over to vegetarian recently, and have grown a little tired of bean "burgers", so I figured I'd give it a shot. I cut the recipe by half for my family of two, and (per others' reviews) added an extra third cup of corn flakes, cut the nuts by half (I used pecans because that's what I had), used only about one T. oil. I put the mix into two small loaf pans (about 2X5"), and cooked them for about 25 minutes. When I turned them half way through the bake, I added the glaze I always use for meatloaf (catsup, mustard and brown sugar) on top because I figured it would make the "meat" less foreign, and I was pleasantly surprised. I'll see how well it goes over with the hubby, but I was impressed at the taste and especially the texture of this. I'm considering trying the second small loaf for use in a vegetarian lasagna, as vegetarian "beef" crumbles can be difficult to find in our small city. I'm not sure how well it would hold up in a slow cooker version, but I bet it would fare well in a baked version.

I have made this vegetarian loaf so many times. Every meat eater in my life loves it! I would recommend adding about a half cup finely chopped onion.  it's adds another layer that I think helps make this dish great!

This is delicious, just the way it is, and to me it tastes like meatloaf.  I will definitely be making this again.  I did add a glaze some have given me of 3 T ketchup, 1T balsamic vinegar and 1T maple syrup - delish!

Best non=meat loaf I have ever had.  Taste is out of this world, mouth feel is stupendous.  As a practicing vegetarian I plan to have this a couple of times a month.

I followed the recipe to a T. It had a slightly odd texture I think. Perhaps more a bit more eggs would do it better. I wonder how it would taste with special K instead of cornflakes? Well, maybe next time. Overall, I am not sure I will make it again for a long time and if I do, there will be some changes.

Loved this recipe. I added mushrooms and onions to it. These are the strangest ingredients to put together and I had my doubt about it turning into a "loaf" but it did and was awesome. Not overly "meaty" for all you vegetarians. I made another meatloaf that grossed me out because the consistency too "meaty". I also did have to bake it for an hour.

Just HAD to try this. While we are not vegetarian we don't eat a lot of meat. This was an awesome replacement for the usual meat loaf. We loved it and were simply in awe of how it turned out. I only used a couple of tablespoons of the oil (I think it needs it for browning) and I used pecans as that is what I had on hand. It was really good. Looking forward to trying it as meat loaf sandwiches with the leftovers.

It was way too salty.  I love Corn Flakes and cottage cheese, but they just didn't combine well for me in a baked loaf.  It was worth the try though......simple to make, just was not to my taste.

I made this meatloaf for my son who is a vegetarian and was so impressed with the look and taste I almost ate it all!  

My husband looked at the ingredients and wrote "Very Interesting!" on the recipe when it was hanging on the fridge.  I can't wait for him to try it!  

I did not have creamed cottage cheese so I used regular cottage cheese and it still tasted and looked great!  I liked that it browned so it looked like meatloaf.     

I also cooked mine for closer to 50 minutes to firm it up a little more.

I will be making this for the entire family from now on because it is that good!

So delicious! I also added an extra cup of corn flakes and only used two eggs.  I added 2 T flax seeds mixed with 3 T water. Reduced oil to 1/8 c and added one shredded carrot and one shredded zucchini.

With a resident vegetarian, its hard for me to find things that we both like to eat. This is an inexpensive, easy and healthy dish that my husband loves. It is unique and it doesn't taste like meat at all but still good nonetheless.

I added Kitchen Bouquet Browning & Seasoning Sauce to look more like meat. My husband thinks it's a good substitue for the high sodium corned beef hash he had to give up.

This is really good!  Husband really loved it. We didn't expect it to be like ground beef meatloaf, but it is reminiscent (probably more so for those of us who have been vegetarians for a while).  Next time I'll try it with half the oil and no nuts.  Very good with mushroom gravy and mashed potatoes!  Try it!!

Like other reviewers I don't know why I tried this but it was very good.  I followed suggestions from the others and gave it a BBQ flavor with BBQ sauce in the pan and then served extra BBQ sauce along side.

My family of picky eaters love this - except I have to leave out the walnuts or the six year old makes faces and picks them all out! Also, I just use regular large-curd cottage cheese, and it comes out just fine. A great dish!

My husband and I have been on the lookout for a meatloaf alternative for sometime now.  I'm still not sure how we found this recipe, but I'm glad we did!!!  I love it and so does my husband.  I do agree with everyone else, you have to cook it for at least an hour before it's done, but its well worth the wait!!  The only problem I have with this recipe is the sodium content.  It's a little high for us.  I've been looking for a lower sodium onion soup mix, but have yet to find one.  If anyone knows of where I can find any, or how to make some at home, please let me know!!

I loved this recipe, I added about 1/2 c shredded cheddar cheese and also sprinkled cheese and breadcrumbs on top. It came out a little nutty flavored so i think i'll reduce the amount of walnuts next time. Overall I'm satisfied and I know other veggie heads out there will like it too!

I LOVE this receipe. I have played with the recipe many times and my final combination is:  

24 oz Small curd cottage cheese, 
4 cups crushed oat/bran/corn flakes, 
4 beaten eggs, 
1 envelope of meat loaf flavoring, 
1/4 cup apple sauce or oil, 
chopped green peppers, 
chopped onions and 
a large can of tomato sauce. 

I mix everything together, saving 1/3 of the tomato sauce for the top.  Put in casserole dish and pour remaining tomato sauce on top.  I have to cook at 350 degrees for at least 70-80 minutes.  The (meatless) loaf is great immediately, but gets much firmer after refrigeration and reheating. Delicious!

I thought this recipe was really good. The reason I gave it four stars is I thought the taste of the cereal was a bit much. It could have been the type of cereal I used. My 1 1/2 year old loved it, but my meat-eater husband hated it. I thought it was even better the next day as a " meatloaf" sandwich.

Very easy to throw together, and pretty tasty. Served with some mushroom gravy, which enhanced the flavour. Baked 60 minutes, as suggested by others, and it certainly wasn't overdone. Thanks for the recipe!

Tastes like meatloaf!  Made this yesterday and it was inedible. The mods were key: 2.5 cups cornflakes, fat free cottage cheese, chopped onion instead of soup mix, put nuts through food processor.  After the mods the next day my boyfriend ate several slices with ketchup.  Better if cooked longer or if cold.

Wow!  My husband could not believe there is no meat in this loaf.  Very tasty with a nice meaty texture.  I added an extra cup of cornflakes and an extra egg, as others have described.  I baked it for an hour, and it turned out perfectly with a nicely browned crunchy crust.  Next time I will reduce the oil.  I am not sure why that was necessary.  I will also try adding other chopped veggies.  Delicious!

Wow!  I was unsure of how these ingredients would come together, but I dare say....this was GREAT!  I did as some suggested and omitted the oil entirely and increased the corn flakes to 2 1/2 cups.  I have only recently, within the last two years, become a vegetarian and I had always loved meatloaf previously.  When I saw this recipe it was too tempting to pass up and I am so glad I gave it a go.  Whether you are vegetarian or just looking for a good meatless dish during lent, this will surely please.  Oh, and leftovers, cold meatloaf sandwiches with a touch of katchup is even better!  You can't go wrong with this one.

This is very tasty, it's great for lunch on a french loaf with mustard. I could not find creamed cottage cheese so I use small curd instead and it worked just fine. I baked it the full 40 mins, then let it rest for 30 min before removing it from the pan.

I hate doing this; i was so hopeful about this recipe, but it really fell short. the onion taste is overwhelming. even with an extra cup of cereal and 1/3c. italian breadcrumbs, i thought it was way too... pudding like even after 1 hour + in the oven. just not good at all.

After reading other reviews I decided to add another egg to help it stick together and I added about another cup of cornflakes. Was very yummy and I didn't have any trouble at all. It is important to let it cool down quite a bit though before you serve it.

Great substitute for meatloaf. Tastes savory and crunchy. Added 2 1/2 cups corn flakes instead of what was suggested in the recipe.

I thought this recipe sounded very interesting and after reading all the good reviews, I had to give it a try. I was somewhat disappointed. It did not taste "just like meatloaf" as quite a few claimed. Still, it was not awful, it just wasn't that great. I did follow some of the suggestions (extra cornflakes, bake longer) but I think I may try it again and add some different ingredients that were suggested like peppers and onions. If it isn't any better, I won't give it a 3rd try.

This was a disaster for me...I did substitute tofu for the eggs, but I have made tofu quiche from this site w/no problems.This was a complete waste of ingredients...It baked for almost 2 hours and never set. Is there a trick to to having this set up?? After reading many of the reviews, I added extra cereal, even a little scoop of oats to ensure that it baked properly.

Yum yum yum yum yum!

Every time I make this it disappears in a flash.  I made it as my own little vegetarian entree at a family thanksgiving and even the carnivores were complimenting it.

Deeeelish, especially with a side of mashed potatoes and green beans!

Like many others, I too was amazed that the ingredients yielded something so meatloaf-like.  My only complaint was that it took forever to bake, so it's maybe not as good for a school night.  Can't beat the prep time though, 5 mins, then into the oven!

Thanks for submitting this recipe!!!

Hmmm....well, it tastes okay...actually it tastes better cold to me because the texture is better. It's too mushy when it's hot. I don't think we even finished the one loaf I made and I couldn't have eaten as much as I did without ketchup baked on top :(

I was also very skeptical because it sounds like such an odd mix of ingredients, but I loved it!  I used the extra cup of cornflakes, cooked it for an hour, and viola!  Delicious.  Will definitely make it again.

I tried this recipe just because it looked interesting.  It was good but didn't make my favorite list.  It really did look like meat.  My parents, who are very healthy eaters, loved it!  I'll probably make this again but not very often.

I had a quart of cottage cheese that I needed to use or lose, so decided to try this.  Read all reviews and followed suggestions, extra cereal and baked longer.  Had two loaves, so planned to give one to my sister.  Unfortunately, by the next morning ours was gone and the one intended for her family had already been dug into.  I can't say I think it tastes like real meatloaf, but it is darn good.  My only complaint is it was a little too salty for my taste; I used both onion soup and meatloaf seasoning so that might be the reason.  However, would definitely recommend it!  Will make again.

I have tried so many recipes that were given five stars, only to find them good but not great. This one really surprised me! I had the ingredients on hand, so I tried it. DELICIOUS! Like some others, I used 2 1/2 cups of cereal (I used Special K), everything else the same. DO TRY THIS! YUMMY!

Don't let the name fool you!! This is an amazing meal. I don't know HOW cottage cheese and cornflakes turn into something so good.  I did add 2 1/2 c of flakes and I baked it for 65 minutes. I gave the recipe to my friend(who has 3 kids) and my Mom and Dad.  They all LOVED it!!! GIVE it A TRY!!

Yum, Yum, Yum!!! This is THE BEST vegetarian recipe I've ever tried. The cooking time was way off - I cooked it for at least an hour - but it was well worth the wait. It tastes EXACTLY like real meat loaf. My husband, a meat lover, thought it was delicious as well. Highly recommend it.

My husband is hesitate to eat anything that's suppose to look and taste like meat but isn't meat.  However, he enjoyed this recipe, as did my grown children.

Thanks!

I ENJOYED THIS RECIPE!!  This loaf has nice onion flavor, a meaty texture and is a nice change from soy based veggie meats. I would suggest baking it for at least 1 hour (I baked mine for 65 minutes) and then letting it sit for about a half hour before eating it so that it has time to completly set.  I'm sure that it will be even tastier tomorrow!

The next time that I make it, I will add a little extra cornflakes (2 cups) and maybe a little packaged meatloaf seasoning.

I'm really pleased with this one. Thank you Mary Ann.....My suggestion to everyone....TRY IT!

We were pleasantly surprised with this one.  The flavor was very nice, and it was quite filling.  I used 2 cups of corn flakes and will probably add an extra half cup next time,as we would have like it a bit firmer.  This is definitely going into the recipe rotation here.  I call it "meatless loaf" instead of "cottage cheese roast"

Very deceiving ingredients.  I looked at them and thought yuk!  I was pleasantly surprised.  Great with mashed potatoes.  My husband loved it.  Kids did too.  I will make this one again definitely.

This tasted just like meatloaf, but better!  It took only 5 minutes to put together.  The only hard part was waiting for it to bake, I left it in for 65 minutes.

It was great... My wifes quote was "this was the closest thing I've had to meat since I've become a vegetarian"
It did however take over 1 hour to bake it solid at 350 ..
