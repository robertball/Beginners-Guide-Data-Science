CLAP CLAP CLAP
 Excellent!!!!
I agree with the description.  It is the perfect blend of Tex and Mex.  I am a Texas girl living in California land of Baha Mexican cooking.  Fish tacos are good, but I forgot how wonderful Texas tastes.
A well thought out recipe.
Excellent texture, taste and heat.
I used 10 chipolte peppers in adobe sauce from a can.  This saved the entire first step. I just used 10 not the whole can and it was perfect.  
I also added 2 extra cans of diced tomatoes.  I prefer my chili a bit soupy since most thicken later.
I only used 1 large yellow onion. I also added some red and green bell peppers
I really felt like I was building a great tasting chili right from the get go.  I loved the extra touch of carmalizing the tomato paste.  Really added a nice layer of flavor.
This is the best chili I have ever made.

I am so glad I was enticed to make this. It appeared to be time/work intensive but looked interesting - it is worth every bit of effort and fun to make as well. My chile has always been -well, chili. This is CHILI. 

I've never used dried peppers before. No problem finding them but only 5 in a bag and with cost in mind I bought only one bag. That amount was actually perfect for my family. I used the internet to define how to make the ancho paste and then winged it because recipe does not clarify for neophite dried pepper users whether to put the liquid the peppers soaked in, in the food processor along with the peppers to make the paste. I made quite a mess doing it too but that will go better next time now that I've done it once. I got 1 lb less italian sausage and when I got home from the grocery store discovered that I had picked up a pkg of hot and a pkg of mild which actually turned out to be excellent. I don't use a lot of sausage of any kind and was afraid it's flavor would overwhelm everything else, it doesn't. I agree with others that 1/4 cup of honey is perfect.

My husband said this is the best chili he's ever had. My daughter's fiance said he doesn't care for chili therefore, doesn't eat it often, but he liked this very much and says when I make it again not to change a thing. Lon, you made me into a chili artist. Thanks

Awesome flavour and texture. Hot yet sweet. I used this in a family/friend chili cook-off and walked away with first place.

GREAT recipe!  I did make a few changes based on my own tastes and at the suggestion of other reviewers.  I cut the honey down to 1/4 cup, I also substituted a cup of strong coffee and a bottle of dark beer (a porter) for the wine as I don't think wine has any business in something as earthy as chili  and as the recipe was becoming a bit too thick.  I also omitted a few veggies I didn't have handy.  Will definitely make again!

This is a great recipe!!  I used this with variations below and won our first annual church chili cookoff!  

Adaptations:
Instead of using dried ancho chilies, I took the advice of another reviewer on here and used chipoltes is adobe sauce.  I used about 5oz of a 7oz can.  But you may want to start with half a can and see how you like the heat then add more of the can.  I did still blend the chipoltes.

Instead of wine I used beer.  About 16+ oz of a dark beer was used vs only 8oz of wine.

I cut out a bit of the meat (about 3/4 lb) as it was pretty heavy meat.

I added 2 tbsp cocoa powder
I added full cup of honey vs half cup
I added some water (1/2 cup)

The recipe can be pretty hefty on thickness, so I added some liquid (beer, water, etc and added some extra diced tomatoes).

This adaptation turned out really well.  Hope this helps!  It had a nice warm sweet front taste with a dark beer warm heat on the back end.  Excellent!

I recently made this chili and served it to 20 or so guests, along with a few other chili options for those who did not eat pork or beef. Fusion Chili is well worth the effort! I was asked to print copies of the recipe for folks to take home. Make Fusion chili ahead of time, refrigerate at least overnight, then warm it up and serve (I used a Crock Pot). The blend of flavors is complex and slides from very sweet at first bite to a wonderful dry heat after a few moments. Chili doesn't get any better than this!

This chili was a huge hit at a chili cookoff.  Of the 30+ pots of chili, mine was gone first.  This recipe has taken first place in my list of favorites.

This is the best chili I have ever tasted.  One of 17 entries in my office's Annual Chili Cook-off and got voted first place.  
Don't let the term "sweet" throw you.  The sweet is very subtle and only one of the many layers of flavors.
The "serves 12" recipe makes about 6 quarts.  I made a half-recipe and added 2 (15 oz.) cans of diced tomatoes for a total of 4 quarts.
Excellent recipe.

GREAT--zesty, interesting, unusual--chili!  The reviews are so impressive that I tried to follow the recipe closely as possible, though toward the end I started taking some reviewers' suggestions.   *I hate fennel's anise-y flavor so I used a lb. of Gaspar's Hot Chourico and a lb. of the good pork breakfast sausage my butcher makes. (Five lbs. meat total; 6 lbs. is too much, IMO.) *I had only yellow onions, so used three med. ones. *I had only one sad little stalk of celery so I added a cup of froz. chopped green peppers and 6 oz. chopped canned green chiles. *Was doubtful re:carrots in chili, but grated in a scant cup. Undetectable, really, & healthy.  *I can't even remember how much additional liquid  I added; as written, the chili (even leaving out a lb. of the sausage) is more a fork-food than a stew. I added 2 cans beef broth, 2 cans chix broth, ~a cup of strong coffee (great suggestion!) *I worried about the honey, but the sweetness is subtle and interesting.  Next time, though, I might try 1/3 cup instead of 1/2. *For the hot sauce I used mostly Chipotle Tabasco, the rest reg. Tabasco.  *Same w/the chili powder; mostly Penzey's ground Chipotle, the rest chili powder. *When it was nearly done I thought it needed a little more chile flavor, so I added 2 more tsps. cumin, dash of Mex. oregano, Tbsp. of Penzey's dry Adobo seasoning.  It's an artful blend of flavors. I'm a native Texan and like my chili authentic, but this is lovely. My compliments to the chef!

I made this chili for a Halloween/football party I gave this year.  I made the full serving and it was completely gone by the end of the day- people were going back for seconds and thirds!! They really loved the big chunks of sausage and that you could taste the sweetness of the honey without it being overwhelming.  The only change that I made in the recipe was substituting yellow and red bell peppers for the carrots.  Delicious!!!

This recipe was great!  I followed the directions with the exception of cutting back on the amount of honey.  My mother didnt think that I needed to let the chili simmer for three hours, but the flavors do have a chance to blend when simmering on low heat.  I would make this recipe again.

I did not enjoy the sweet taste that the honey gave the chili. I even used half of the honey that the recipe called for, as per the suggestion of others. I also thought it took way too long to prepare. If I'm going to spend an hour and a half preparing a dish, it had better knock my socks off.

made this for 10 guests. people raved about it.  i took suggestions and went light on the honey, but i think it could have used more sweetness. I loved the ancho paste and the carrots put a different spin on it! i'm from the midwest and no one here has heard of carrots in chilli!! This also went great with macaroni...

Help!  I can't stop eating this!  OMG it's wonderful and so different.  Chili will never be the same.  I used a 3lb roast (slow cooked), 1lb hot and 1 lb sweet Ital sausage, 3 cans beans, and 2 cups of frozen corn - which added a nice color and crunch.  Left out the carrots.  I can see why others won prizes with this!  And it may make a lot, but certainly not too much based on its flavor.  I wish I had more left over to take to people.  Making it is work but fun because it's a creation, not just throwing stuff in a pot like I usually would do.

This had a nice smoky flavor.  Nothing really sets it apart, but the recipe offers a very good bowl of chili.  Shredded cheddar cheese on top perfected it.  My only change was to use beer instead of wine just because I didn't have any.

Great tasting chili this is.  Fixed it for a company get together/cook-off.  Came in second place of 19 pots.  Made a tweek so I could fix for the audience, but the whole of it was the original flavor.  Thanks a bunch.  Add this to my recipe collection for later.

I ended up quartering the recipe because I was only cooking for 2 people and still got 4-6 bowls of chili.  I used all the ingredients except for the hot sauce (The wife can't handle spice). I also added a can of 16oz tomato sauce because I like my chili a little soupier.  The result was fabulous.  I actually prefer tons of heat in my foods and this was very flavorful without of bunch of spicy ingredients.  You can notice the layers of flavor in each bite.  I think the tomato paste caramelizing process was key to the success of this recipe.  I used to use a knockoff of Wendy's Chili, but this will now be my go to chili recipe.  Thanks, LONBINDER.

This is it! Everyone loved it. I used canned chipotle peppers in adobe as suggested (whirred 10 in my bullet blender), chorizo, added an extra can of beans, and only 1/4c honey. I was worried the chipoltles would make the flavor too smokey-but after cooking a while it was perfect! This makes a lot too.  After browning meat, sauteing veggies, and carmelizing the paste I added everything to my electric roaster oven to simmer.  It didn't even make it the full 3 hours before people were dipping out their second bowl!

Delicious. My chili is still simmering. But it's definately very tastey....I cant stop tasting it. The honey adds a nice sweetness, but not too sweet. I happened to have poblano chilies, which is the non dried ancho. I roasted, pealed and blended with a few jalepenos, the parsley and honey to make the honey/chile mixture. This really wasnt too labor intensive....even having to roast the poblanos. But it's worth it if you are looking for a chili that's not as much work We're going to top it with a little sour cream, crumbled fresco queso and corn bread on the side.

This is the best chili I've ever tasted.  Just a tip--let the ancho chiles soak while you prepare all of the other ingredients and give them a stir now and then.  It took a bit of processing to get them to a paste consistency and I think further soaking would have helped me with that.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This is wonderful chili.  It has a sneaky heat to it.  I agree with it's description totally.  It is worth the effort and time it takes.  I'm entering it in a chili cook-off tomorrow.  I'm glad I chose this recipe!

Making the chili sauce is the key! The last couple of times I made chili,  I needed to keep adding chili powder to increase the chili flavor, sometimes making the final product grainy.  This sauce had GREAT chili flavor without having to add a ton of chili powder.  We loved this chili. I made it as written, except used a combination of four different dried chili peppers for the sauce, simply because I'm always buying them and rarely use all.  I will use this as my new recipe! Thanks for posting!

This is a winner! I printed this recipe in 2002 and just made it for the first time in 2009! I am so thankful that I did not throw this recipe away. I used every ingredient it called for but I added 32 ounces of beef broth and I used 12 ancho chili's instead of 10. I would not make it without the beef broth or else you have a very thick paste like chili. It was the biggest hit at my husbands company chili luncheon. Don't try any other chili recipe until you try this one!

What a DELICIOUS chili! I made this chili for my family on Superbowl Sunday and what a hit! Taste even better the second day! Make a full batch because you'll want to be eating this for dinner the rest of the week!

Our family has been hosting a Chili Cook off for quite a few years at my home.  Since I host it, I don't usually enter it.   This year, I kept my entry a secret and out of ten Chili's ~ this one won!    I agree with most that I had to add much more liquid to my taste.  I added two large cans of diced tomatoes AND a large can of tomato puree.   I used the entire amount of honey and even added a little bit more toward the end.  I used a full can of chipolte peppers and the sauce (instead of the dried) for a real sweet/hot chili.  On our table for all of the chili's  that we served, we had chopped onion, sour cream, shreaded cheese, diced chili's, and jalapeno peppers.  Next time, we might offer some rice or noodles for Cincinatti chili for those that want a full meal.

First, it was very time consuming pulling together 24 ingredients for this recipe.  I halved the recipe, cooked it in the morning, and then transferred to a slow cooker.  The canned tomatoes went in undrained, but the kidney and pinto beans went into the chili with their liquid.  The mixture was very dry, and I still added a little bit more red wine, otherwise, followed the recipe to the T.  I do agree with a comment made by some of the other reviewers.  Do yourself a favor and start by reducing the honey, as I thought it turned out pretty sweet.  You always can add more, but once it's in there, you can't take it out.  I'm giving this 4 stars, but I doubt that I'll make it again. Admittedly, I don't have a huge attention span, so I think I'll make the compromise to stick with a recipe with fewer ingredients.

Honestly, I don't know how this recipe is NOT considered within the "top 20" chili recipes on this web site. I made this for a chili cook-off with 4 or 5 of my neighbors, and it blew everyone's socks off.  My slight variations to this recipe were mixing up the types of meat (in addition to ground chuck, I used ground bison, beef tips, as well as hot and mild italian sausage) and instead of ancho chiles, I used dried chipotles and thai bird chiles (only because my local kroger didn't have the anchos).

I used habanero peppers instead of the peppers it suggested. I also put chorizo sausage instead of Italian. It was a hit. Lots of compliments. I will cut down on the honey for the next time I make it.

I just won 1st place in my chili competition with this recipe. I did it exactly to specs at it tasted excellent. I knew once I tasted it that I had already won 1st. When they announced the winner they said I won with an "overwhelming" amount of votes. I am going to make another batch soon for myself and my friends.  Thank you very much for posting this recipe. I knew it was golden.

I was amazed at how good this chili was. The ingredients lists can be intimidating and preparing the chilies was something I'd never done before, but it wasn't difficult and the result was wonderful.   The first taste is one of mild sweetness and good chili flavor, then a warm sensation settles in the mouth. The warmth was nice; it is not a heat that distracts or interferes with the taste and won't set you to downing glass after glass of water to put the fire out. This recipe could be easily adjusted to add more heat if so desired.  I will definitely be making this chili again.

This is really good if you want a change from regular chili. I used molasses instead of honey (none in the house) and didn't include the sausage (used ground chicken and sirloin). It's a bit sweet for me but all of the flavors did blend well.

I really, really liked this recipe. It is definitely a Tex-Mex Chili with a very unique layered flavor. 
I quartered the recipe because I was making it for just my husband and I and we still had enough for two meals! 
i DID use the carrots (but I've never used them in chili before) and will use them again. I didn't take a bite and think "oh, there's a carrot" but I think it added to the over all "package" of flavors.
I couldn't find spicy Italian sausage in casings but used a fully cooked hot and spicy Italian Sausage that tasted more like andouille sausage to me. It didn't have the licorice flavor that others are talking about. I really liked what I used so I'll probably stick with it. Since it was fully cooked I waited to add it when the recipe says to add the cooked ground beef back in.
I added more beans and stewed tomatoes because that's the way we like it.
I only added half the amount of honey. I like sweet and spicy but my husband doesn't like sweet chili.
I will definitely make this again and again!

I've made this chili about 4 times now in the past year.  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!  The first 2 times I made it exactly as the recipe called for and it was a bit too soupy for my liking and didn't really have the LOOK of chili, but still was delicious.  The last 2 times I've made it, I've used ground pork sausage instead of the Italian sausage and used about 2 medium sized cans of tomato sauce along with the diced tomatoes the recipe called for; it was absolutely delicious and definitely looked and tasted more like chili.  I normally serve it with sour cream and corn bread.  This is definitely my "go to" chili recipe.

honestly i would say 3 1/2 stars, but that's not an option! this is a very good meal, but it lacks the "chili" feel. it's decidley italian in flavor, except for the chilies. I thought there was too much sausage and would have liked peppers and more beans. Really enjoyed it over rice, but the flavor was more italian then anything. We made this for company, and the whole (giant) pot was gone by the time the night was over, so it was a hit though!

Love, love, loved it!  So did my husband.  I didn't change a thing, actually found dried ancho peppers, I'm thinking mine were larger than the ones that the author used because I had to double the vinegar and water, I added the puréed mixture to taste.  I couldn't believe how much it made.  Fantastic chili!  Thank you

I had some leftover ancho chills to use, so I searched high and low for a recipe in which I could incorporate them. I found this and was intrigued. I followed EVERYTHING except I omitted the celery because I had none. Instead, I threw in an extra cup of carrots. At the end, neither my husband nor I were impressed at all. He's from Mexico, so he mostly enjoys the smoky, spicy flavored recipes; however, this was a no go. It was too "smoky" for us and the spice was a bit much for me. I didn't get what everyone was saying about the sweetness. The spice was so overpowering that I could barely taste the honey. In the end, for as long as it took to make and the disappointing results, I have decided I will never make this again.

I am very picky about chili.  I needed something different for a cookoff we had at work.  It only went up against 13 other chili recipes but the judges said it was number one by a long shot.  I did replace the hot italian with regular italian sausage and instead of ground beef used steak.  Other than that it was a good base and highly adjustable for your taste.

We absolutely love this!  Easy to make and tastes great!  I make this for the family, for my husbands coworkers, for church gatherings and always get lots of complements and an empty pot.  For those who aren't into spicy chili this is easy to moderate level of hotness.  I will say that I use sweet peppers not anything hot.

wonderful recipe. I loved it the first time we cooked it, and the second, and the well you get the picture. highly recomend it to the person who likes things spicy with plenty of flavor. I have forgotten all other chili recipes and will remain faithfull due to the tex-mex inspired flavor.  THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE......

Great flavor! I roasted the chiles, removed the stems and seeds and ground them in a spice grinder which gave them a wonderful smokey flavor, also it is much easier. I also used dark beer instead of wine as wine gives an Italian taste more like a pasta sauce.  I also used habanero hot sauce which gives it a lot of zing which I enjoy but some won't.  Great recipe.

WOW! This is some AWESOME chili! I did make a few changes to it though because I couldn't fins come ingredients. Instead of ancho chilis (believe it or not I couldn't find em) I used canned chipotle peppers, I have used them in other dishes and it ads a great smokey flavor as well as heat. I also used beer to deglaze the pan instead of wine, I agree with the other user that wine has no business in chili =) I plan on making this again for football sunday but this time I am armed with the ancho chilis and am excited about how its going to turn out! Thanks AGAIN for a great recipie!!

I loved this chili - so did my daughter who does not like chili.  There are so many flavors that develop while you eat it. It is like a gourmet chili.  If I owned a restaurant this is the chili I would serve.  That being said, my husband and son only rated it a 4 - they loved the fusion but thought it was a little too sweet - they do not like their chili to have any sweetness. I will be making this again!

This chili was very good, it was sweet and hot.  I liked the meat to bean ratio (fewer beans than meat).  If you prefer a lot of beans I would double the beans.  Overall a good recipe.  My two year old loved it!

My first time making chili and it was very good.  I accidentally used Marsala wine, plus I used venision ground meat so the taste was probably slightly different.  Also, could not find the right peppers so I just used green chili's.  All in all, will make again but with less honey and more Tobasco sauce for a spicier kick.

Those ancho chilis can be a pain to track down (and prepare), but I'll be damned if this isn't some of the best chili I have ever had.  I entered it in a small little friendly cookoff a couple of my freinds were having and I won.  Good good stuff.

Word of caution, it's very unique but very delicious.  If you are looking for "classic" chili flavors this sure isn't it.  But it's incredibly delicious.

My guy loved it!  It has a very interesting taste which I believe is the honey.  This chili is a bit sweet but then pow! A second later the heat hits.  This is time consuming to make - but worth it.  I cut the recipe in half and the only change I made was to use 3 cans of tomoatoes instead of two.  If I had used 2 cans I would have had to stay close to the pot to stir to make sure the bottom didn't burn.  With the three cans I was able to stir every hour.  Thanks so much submitter!

OMG! I brought this to my sons' school annual chili cook-off and almost won!  If they had a second place, I would have gotten it.  It was a tie for the spicy category and the school principal made the deciding taste test and I only lost because the other chili was spicier (too spicey).  I omitted the red pepper sauce and maybe I should have left that in.  I made it without beans and only half the honey.  I got many compliments on this recipe.  It's a great one!

The first time I made this it was my first attempt at Chili, and everyone LOVED it.  I live in a small town with one grocery store that does not always have the exact ingrediants, so it's a little different everytime I make it but I always have people asking for more.  Personally it's my favorite recipe, and I have a lot of fun making it.  Thank you for sharing!

Guests totally loved this pot of chili!  I used some of the review suggestions:  half the honey called for especially.  I used 2 lbs. regular sausage and that was plenty!!  The left overs made great burritos the next day!!

GREAT CHILI!  This is one of the most flavorful chili's I've ever made - my family loved it! I also added several dried Chipotle peppers (prepared the same way as the Ancho) for a slight smoky flavor with a spicy kick. I also added diced green and red pepper. I only used about 1.5 lbs of hot italian sausage plus the 3# of ground beef. It is very thick so you might want to add some water or tomato sauce if you don't like it that dense. Don't leave anything out of this recipe as every ingredient adds it's own special flavor! WONDERFUL - Thank You for sharing it!

This chili is great.  I used regular Italian sausage instead of the "hot Italian" and I thought that it had just the right amount of "kick".  Thanks for a great recipe.

Best Chili Ever, However I did not add honey or beans because I am on a low carb diet. Instead of Ground Beef I used some steak that I had left over, and cut it into cubes. The perfect amount of spiceness. Will Definently make again:)

This is hands down the BEST chili I've ever had.  I've made it 3 times now and get rave reviews every time.  The honey gives it a nice sweetness that I don't think is overbearing. For the hot sauce I use Sriracha which, along with the ancho chile paste, gives it just the right amount of kick and I love the sweet/spicy combo.  I like to make it the night before and reheat it the next day, it really helps infuse the flavors and makes it taste even better.  This recipe is just perfect.

Love this recipe! I've made it several times! The prep work is a little time consuming the first time around but it's well worth it! Authentic chili! And it yields a lot of chili, good for a family or potluck get together...I used the canned ancho chili peppers ...and something I learned after the first batch I made was too spicy, you may want to remove the seeds and rinse the peppers and then chop or place in food processor..I didn't realize how potent those things were...! I used 3-4 whole ones the first time with seeds included...! Set my stomach on fire, and my  wasn't too happy either! Definitely cut down on the prep time by using the canned ancho chili 
peppers though..;) delicious! I made sure the next batch I made was mild...:)

This recipe is great.  I does take done time but not a ton of skill.  It is just great flavors that melt together to make a sweet,  savory,  and spicy dish.  I made the recipe as is, with the addition of some spicy chili paste.  I love really spicy dishes and it made it perfect for me and my family.  The nice thing about this recipe is that you can make small variation to fit the taste you prefer and stl have a great dish because it is filled with so great flavors.

I made this chili for a Superbowl party and boy was it a hit. I slow cooked it the night before. I used half of the recommended honey and it was perfect. I substituted the wine for a dark creamy ale - which gave it a very nice taste. The Ancho peppers had flavour but no heat. I added two Jalapeno peppers & a Banana pepper. Everyone (including the kids) loved it.

I fed this recipe to 12 people while camping. I cooked in it my cast iron, camp dutch oven over (and under) coals. Many in the group stated that it is the best chili they'd ever had and I have to agree. My husband would've preferred a couple thai chilies thrown in for added heat, but that's just him. There are only two things I did differently—one being that I couldn't find dried ancho chilies, so I bought fresh poblanos and added a little water and some of the white wine vinegar when pureeing them. This was to add some of the flavor you'd expect from soaking the anchos as instructed in the recipe. Second, I had to reduced the recipe by a 1/4 so it would fit in my 6 quart dutch oven, but I used the full amount of diced tomatoes. This recipe was so good that I wouldn't want to change it. I wouldn't substitute beer for the wine or use bell peppers as others have done, because then it wouldn't be Fusion Chili anymore. It would be some other recipe. This recipe has become a star in my cooking repertoire... especially when camping!

I made a vegetarian version of this chili and it was awesome!! I just substituted the meat with a package of vegetarian "beef" crumbles-- the meat-eaters couldn't tell the difference! I also couldn't find ancho chiles so I went with another reviewer's suggestion of using chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. I used a little less honey but I love the balance of sweet and spicy in this chili. This recipe's always a huge hit at get-togethers with friends and family! Even my boyfriend's mother, who doesn't like any spicy food, went back for seconds on this!

I followed the recipe closely except that I couldn't find chipotle at the grocery store down the street, so I used some Habanero peppers I still had in the freezer... It cleared out your sinuses but you couldn't stop eating it, every bite was worth it, delicious.

This chili made me an "award-winning" chef! My friends and I had a chili cook-off, and I won first place (and the $75 prize) out of 11 recipes.
I'm only giving this four stars because I modified it quite a bit. First, I only used 3 cans of tomatoes, not 4. I also used stewed and slow-cooked beef that I shredded rather than ground beef. I think that was part of what won over the crowd. I upped the chili powder and cumin spice a bit, also adding cayenne powder and using soaked and blended red pepper flakes, which are hotter than the peppers called for in this recipe.
I cooked this at night, let the flavors meld overnight then put it on the crockpot all day.
Huuuuuge recipe. Feeds way more than 12, I should say. I don't know how anyone could possibly ever fit this in a deep, wide skillet.
Anyway, I brought it to the party with a little hesitance, but I guess the results prove it!

Alot of effort for so so results, I expected spectacular flavor and was put off by the anise flavor from the spicey sausage...I didn't try but I think ground pork would be a good substitute for the sausage.

I have not made the chili and got the recipe from a co-worker who did make it for a few work functions.  There was not even 1 bean left in the pot!!! Everyone loved it! I gave the recipe to my Sister last year for a super bowl party.  She said people were loading the chili in take home containers!!! It is a big hit! I am going to try my hand at the chili this year! Hopefully I will make it a successful dish!!

When they announced the chili cook-off at our church I leaned over to my husband and confidently whispered "I'm winning that!".   When I got home I came to allrecipes and found this recipe.  It makes a biiiig pot of chili, and I didn't even do a trial run before cooking my entry. I got second place out of about 40 entries, and I think I'd have won had it not been for the novelty of venison chili....I'd have definitely won had it been a popular vote and not the opinion of one judge. 

My husband doesn't like chili much but he loves this recipe.  It's a definite keeper!!!   Thank you Lon!!!

I really liked the way you used the dried chiles, it gave it a nice smokey taste. However, we thought the italian sausage gave it a slight spaghetti twang.  I did leave out the carrots because I had ran out, but not sure I would like them in my chili.  I liked the layers of flavors and will fix again but without the sausage.  Thanks

I made as directed, omitting the carrots.  It is different and has a unique flavor.  Good overall, however I probably wouldn't make it again.  It's very time consuming and is on the sweet side.

Definetly different, but I'm not sure if it's worth the exrta prep and time involved.  I changed the recipe in that I used 4 1/2 lbs. of meat, (including chiorzo and sirloin), an extra can of tomatoes, and green peppers instead of celery.  I cannot imagine how "beefy" and thick it would be otherwise. (I could hardly stir it in the pot).  As it was everyone thought it was a "beef, no bean" recipe. And it was definitely NOT hot enough, and a little too sweet.  Still I gave it four because it did have a good, unique flavor.  Next time I'll add hotter peppers and more bean.

I was looking for a new chili recipe for our upcoming Superbowl party.  Wow!! This recipe is has an incredible flavor.  I thought that the ancho chilis would be hard to find but found them easily in the international section at Walmart.  I do not have a food processor for the chilis so I used a food chopper instead and got them small enough to "paste." Also used cumin seeds instead of ground cumin.  Otherwise, followed recipe exactly.  My husband and I loved it!!  This will now replace my old chili recipe.  Can't wait to use at the party!!  Go Panthers!!

I couldn't find any ancho chiles so I used aniheims, I deleted the sausage and used ground turkey instead of beef..I also used green pepper instead of celery. 
I really enjoyed this chili and was very pleased with the sweet/spicy combination.  I really want to make this again, but I would like to make the sauce a little thicker, I was considering pureeing some of the beans or adding more tomato paste.

Great mix of flavors.  I added a bit more chili powder and some diced tomatos with green chilis to add some heat.  Great job, just not hot enough for my own tastes to give it five stars.

Made this for chili cook off, I adjusted some ingredients, used the peppers in adobe sauce, just easier for me. Cut the honey in half and left out the carrots. I did add sine green pepper. I also added beef broth since the chili was really thick, I'd say I added about 2 cups. Be aware this makes a huge pot of chili you will need a big stock pot. Turned out great, the sweet hits you first then the hear.

This is a wonderful dish! It smells great while cooking it and tastes even better! I like my chili very spicy so I replaced the anchos with a mix of habaneros, jalapenos, and anaheims. It did not disappoint! Also I found it very hard to find dried chiles in the store so I made my own. It was super easy though it did take all day. What you can do if you want to dry your own chiles is cut them in half, take out all the seeds and the white guts, then put them on a baking sheet and throw them in the oven at 150 degrees for 8-10 hours. You can leave your oven on all day while you are at work, and when you get home, you'll have dry chiles! Also I had some dry black beans laying around so I used those instead. I think they actually worked out better than the recommended kidney beans.

This chili was good but for the amount of time it took to prep and cook this and the VERY costly price tag, I more than likely won't be making this chili again.  I like my chili with some spice but not much (I get migraines easily), so I didn't add pepper sauce and I only used 2 lbs of hot sausage instead of 3 (the 3rd lb was mild).  I also didn't feel that there was much flavor to the chili considering the amount of onion, garlic, and spices it required.  Lastly, I ended up using almost 3x the amount of honey it called for for me to like it.  Again, it was good, but I've had better and for a lot cheaper $$$.

Ok... just tried for first time 2 weeks ago... My first Chili Cookoff... WE WON!! This Chili was so different and delicious, it was all gone by the end... It makes a lot!! Can feed quite a few people! It was a little labor intensive as I have never soaked, pureed, blended, carmalized and deglazed all during one recipe! It made for a fun time in the kitchen with my husband!   Worth the effort!
TRY THIS!!!! (oh... we added 1/4c taco seasoning and 1/4c bacon bits... weird, I know, but delicious.

I usually make half (6 servings, 3 lbs of meat).  I find it's not spicy enough, so I usually double the hot sauce, add maybe half a tablespoon of cayenne pepper, and throw in 4 habanero chiles (those measurements are for the half recipe).  I also push the chili to the side and brown a couple tablespoons of flour on the bottom of the pot.  That thickens it up a bit more.  Toward the middle of the simmer, I add a bit of heavy whipping cream (or milk or half-and-half).  I love this recipe!

My friends and family have always loved my chili.  I decided to try this with a few modifications and served it to friends and family.  They said throw out the old recipe and replace it with this one.  Changes were a used chipolte chilis instead of ancho.  I added approximately 6 cups of water (the chili was unusually thick).  I decreased the beef and pork by 1 pound each, skipped the kidney beans, and added a small bag of cooked pinto beans.  This will go down as my new chili recipe. It is a perfect blend of flavors.

This recipe for chili is fantastic! This is the very first time I have gone beyond the realm of standard 'chili' recipes. I printed this off about 5 years ago, looked at it every 6 months or so, & was intimidated by the process involved. With no offense whatsoever to the original poster, I had to do some research, as a newbie to dealing with dried peppers in any way. I found a great site, which I will include here! For the 3 part process in dealing with dried peppers if you are new to this! http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/01/how-to-clean-and-prepare-dried-chilies-chili-powder-substitute.html
 I have GERD, & need to take an acid reducer med every day, but some part of me has always known there is a HUGE difference between HEAT.....and sneaky, smokey, awesome heat.! Wow, there sure is!! For those who are beginners to the intro & prep of real peppers in their food (like me)....here is how it went. I followed this recipe with exact amounts and ingredients with exception to the following:
Used 4 dried ancho peppers & 3 dried chipotle peppers....toasted in microwave for 2 15 sec intervals, made sure they were pliable & not too dried out - destemmed & deseeded, then soaked in hot beef broth for one hour, then diced & puréed in food processor with the 1 cup of beef broth I soaked them in. Added them into As recipe directed. The only other change I made to this recipe was to cut down on the meat (used 2 lbs of beef & 2 lbs of hot sausage) as opposed to 3 each, & added a great deal mor

Wow--this chili is fantastic. I've been on a 3-year quest to make the perfect chili and this was pretty close to what I had in mind.  I loved the sweet spicy combo. I made it as directed except I couldn't find the dried chilis--I even tried 2 different stores--so I used a few tablespoons of jalapeños instead, and to make up for the juice you were supposed to soak them in I sprinkled in a few dashes of red wine vinegar. I also used a chopped red pepper instead of the carrots. I will definitely be making this again--it was a huge hit with my family and was fantastic warmed up for lunch the rest of the week.

Pretty good chilli.  I only used 2lbs of each kind of meat instead of 3lbs each which seemed like way too much. I probably would double the beans from 2 cans to 4 as there's barely any beans in it. other than that it's really good. I would try beer instead of red wine too. something heartier might work better.

I had this chili first at a small Chili Cook Off and absolutely loved it and I am so NOT a chili lover per se. It ended up with the Blue ribbon!! I vowed that if I was ever faced with the opportunity to enter a Chili Cook Off I would enter THIS chili!!!! Well I did...two years in a row....and won second place the first year and a blue this year!!! All I can say is that this chili is worth the effort and expense....it has its own uniqueness!!! I make the full amount of chili paste but must admit I use only about half and it is plenty spicy for my family and friends. Fabulous recipe!!!

I did not make the recipe exactly as posted, because my family would not enjoy celery and carrots in their chili.  I used bell peppers instead of the celery and carrots.  Like many others, I used this as the "inspiration" and adjusted ingredients and amounts as needed.  This is a great recipe that allows for some "tweaking" without destroying the end product.  Thank you for posting this recipe.  I will undoubtedly continue to use your blueprint many times in the future.  :-)

Wow this is exceptional...  read through the reviews and made some tweaks myself instead of ancho chilies did up a batch of fire roasted hatch peppers and added them in chopped up.  Also added a cup of strong coffee and used a bottle of dark porter instead of the red wine.

I used to have a recipe for chili that I thought was good. I tried this one and I'll never make chili any other way. I find myself craving a bowl at least once a week! I freeze it in individual portions and it's totally awesome! Don't need crackers, cheese, anything. The only thing I have changed is using half of the honey. Love it, love it, love it!

Decided to try this recipe for a American Legion Chili Contest. Turned out great. Stuck strickly with the recipe and used a decent Cabernet Sauvignon for the wine. The Ancho peppers really give it just the right amount of heat. 5th place out of 60 entrys.
Next time I think I will try a dark beer instead of the wine to give it a different twang. Great Recipe!

Honestly this is one of the BEST chili recipes ever!!!  I didn't have any red wine to deglaze, so I used the good ol' standby- Guiness beer!  Also, I used 1 pound ground turkey, 1 pound ground meat and 2 pounds spicy sausage.  I did add about a 1/4 cup of brown sugar also- I like a sweet/spicy chili personally.  
Thank you, thank you for finally giving me a good chili recipe!!

Just the most perfect chili ever. I used about half of the amount of honey, as others have mentioned. I also dried pablano peppers, instead of using prepackaged ancho chiles and the flavor was amazing! The spice flavor is not too strong and slowly melts into a pleasant sweetness that is not overpowering.

This chili is AMAZEBALLS!  When the days start to shorten and the air starts to get a little cooler I start craving chili and this recipe hits the spot every time!  I make the recipe just about as it is written except that I only use about 1.5 pounds of hot sausage and no other meat.  This makes for a slightly soupier chili than what the recipe calls for but we like it that way.  We also like it a little spicier so I usually jack up the heat with 1/2 cup of hot sauce or so.  But the base recipe is killer.  Make this one and you won't make another chili recipe ever again!  We serve over mashed potatoes and garnish with fresh cilantro and avocado.  Makes a really filling meal full of comfort food!

Best chili recipe I've ever made! Combo of sweet and spicy was perfect. I couldn't find the dried chiles in the grocery store so I carefully added chopped serrano peppers (high on the heat side). Caution though, this makes a boat load of chili as published so unless you're having a huge party or want to freeze some adjust the portions. Great recipe - applause for the chef!

Like the comments said, this is a winner...literally.  I made it for a chili cookoff and won by a landslide.  I used 5 TBSP of ancho chili pepper powder instead of the actual peppers and it was great.

This is one of the best chili recipes I’ve ever made. I only do a total of 3.5 pounds of meat though and it’s still more then enough and has more of a soup feel then being extremely thick.

It tastes great! It just doesn’t taste like chili. It had no spicy heat, so I added some Cayenne pepper.

I made this chili for a contest, but did not win. Nonetheless, I think this is a good recipe. The carrots, onions & honey worked to balance the hotter spices. I used 1/4 C honey & think that’s enough. You could probably use less. I agree with other reviewers that it’s nice to taste the sweetness first, and then the mild heat a second later. As the chili ages, it starts to taste exactly like sloppy joe chili. And there is nothing wrong with that!

I've been making this chili for years.  It's so awesome.  I recently tried a different chili recipe just to mix it up.  But, this chili is the best.  I make it exactly as described.  Sometimes I cannot find the Ancho chiles so I skip them, and it's always perfect.    My only complaint is it doesn't fit in my largest pot or my crockpot so I either cut it in half or have to work in 2 pots.

This chili is Incredibly delicious and totally worth the time!  It has a perfect level of heat (not too freaking hot) and has a marvelous sweetness imparted by the honey. I made it exactly by the recipe to get a baseline on how it performs unenhanced on the basic level, but will experiment with other ingredients to boost performance next time, a la Lance Armstrong. 
The recipe does specify the type of hot pepper sauce, so I used Tabasco Smoked Chipotle sauce and it was life changing.  
GO MAKE THIS CHILI AND YOU’LL NEVER NEED TO USE STEROIDS AGAIN.

This chili is the absolute best!
Made it for a work chili cook off, and got 2nd out of 12 entrees.
The guy who won 1st place, just happened to be the guy who runs the cook off. Go figure.
Made it to a tee. No changes. My mom LOVED it so much, I gave her the recipe, and she won her cook off, down in Florida in her community!
Love love love it!

I augmented this recipe so much, that it barely resembles the original. (I made this without any peppers, and added a  load of mushrooms) HOWEVER, I do wish to thank you for the idea to sauté onions, garlic and tomato paste together!!!! What a stellar base!!! YUM!

Chili itself was pretty good, "BUT DRAIN THE GREASE" and add water or beer, something, anything.
 But as the receipt shows - NO WAY

ALL of these receipt need to show 'how may servings' it makes

Def a winner !  Great flavor and heat. Use good farm fresh meats and veges, makes a difference and less fatty. I used less hot peppers and 1/3 less meat but added more beans and honey. Also added 3-4 cups of chicken stock and it's still thick, like a stew.  This will be a great meal for the next few days. Thanks for a great recipe.

This Chili suited my cooking style just right. A blend of sweet and spicy with the right amount of vegetables. I did alter 2 points on the chili using a chuck roast and pork roast both dry rubbed and cooked for 3 hours then shredded down. I like the additional flavor slow cooked meat adds.

I love that this chili is still con-carne as well. Great dish, taking it to our Chili cook-off at work in a couple of weeks.

Wanted to give this recipe a try since I'm a big fan of using Ancho peppers in chili recipes, versus using that tasteless/gritty grocery store chili pepper. One thing I noticed is that this recipe seems to be a bit short in liquid as the chili was very dry (difficult to even stir). All in all, it was very good, but I did make the following modifications. First, I had to add more liquid to the Ancho peppers as there was no way they were going to puree in a blender without doing so. Second, as mentioned, the chili itself seemed very dry, so I added a bottle of lager beer. Third, as most here did, I cut the honey in half. All in all, the chili was very good tasting, although my kids thought it was bit too spicy. Maybe Ancho peppers have a range of "hotness", don't know. For the 1/4C of hot sauce, I used Tapatio hot sauce (which isn't real spicy). Perhaps I'll just eliminate the hot sauce next time...although doing so means I'll have to add another 1/4 cup of liquid to make up for that.

Won 1st place with this bad boy!  The honey was not overpowering at all!  I used Chicken broth in place of water and added one chicken bouillion as well. Other than that, same same.  Thanks for a chili-tastic recipe!
