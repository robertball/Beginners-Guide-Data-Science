Thank you for posting this recipe!  My italian grandmother used to make these every Christmas and (although I don't know the spelling) called them "sko-wheelies".
She tied them differently, however.  Take the rectangular piece of rolled out dough and make a cut down the center (leaving about an inch or more uncut at each end).  Then take one end and put it through the center cut to the other side so that it looks twisted in the middle.  She also used a pasta machine to flatten out the dough (since she made it in mass quantities!).

I followed this recipe exactly and there is simply not enough liquid.  I ended up adding an extra egg, another tablespoon of butter and the sherry before it became dough like.

My grandmother used to make these every Christmas and I miss them.  She used to decorate them with red & green round sprinkles and then drizzled them with honey.  YUMMMMM!  She called them "Honey Ribbons."

My nana always made these at Christmas, but I've never had the recipe. I haven't had them since she died suddenly 13 years ago. Thank you so much for posting this recipe. You made my Christmas!

My grandma used to do these with struffoli dough- ribbons with the slit in the center and one end pulled through. She would coat them in warmed honey and sprinkles, and serve them with the struffoli as "buttons and bows".

Like the others, my Grandmother made these every Christmas, the recipe was for a large quanity.( her 11 children and their families). She called them fringetti, not sure about the spelling.  Her recipe called for fresh orange zest. Now I dont have to reduce the ingrediants to a normal sized batch.  Thank you very much for posting. :-)

Not nearly enough liquid ingredients to make a dough (all I got was slightly less dry flour).  I added milk & doubled the butter to make a dough.  After that, the cookies came out OK.  Still looking for a better recipe for these cookies.

My friend back in grade school always had these because her mom made them and I've always remembered them. I've been looking for the recipe all over the place. Glad I found it because these are delish!!!

In my family these cookies are called "scalli" or "scallidi". My parents, grandparents, great aunts & uncles, etc. have all essentially made a very similar recipe. However, the main difference is that instead of dipping or coating with confectioners sugar, the cookies are dipped in honey and let to cool. They're amazing!
