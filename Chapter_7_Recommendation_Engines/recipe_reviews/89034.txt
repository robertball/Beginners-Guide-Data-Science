I scaled the recipe down to 3 servings, and used one orange as I didn't want that particular flavor to overwhelm the others. I marinaded the steak overnight, and it turned out great - very tender and flavorful. Thanks, Sandy!

This turned out really good. I didn't have 8 hours to marinate so I can only imagine how much better it would have been if I did. I was worried about the orange overwhelming the other flavors but it didn't. Instead of discarding the marinade, I put it in a small saucepan (minus the orange slices) and let it reduce into a sauce for dipping. Good recipe and one I would make again.
