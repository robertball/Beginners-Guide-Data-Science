This is very similar to how we usually eat papaya (with lime juice and honey). The addition of balsamic vinegar scared me a bit, so I cut that back to just a sprinkle (probably more like 1 tsp). It wasn't that noticeable, so maybe it would have been fine with the entire amount, but I was afraid it would ruin it for us. I did add some toasted coconut on top, and garnished it with fresh mint. Very pretty and refreshing. I'd gladly serve this to dinner guests.
