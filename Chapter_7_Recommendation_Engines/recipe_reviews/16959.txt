This recipe is ok, but there is another recipe on this site that I prefer. It is called "Spinach Brownies" (strange name but really good recipe!).

I love this recipe; just remember to use medium cheddar or it’s too bland...  I also make Greek spinach squares by using feta cheese instead of cheddar and adding ½ tsp of dried dill.

These turned out great for my Christmas Eve buffet of finger food. I did add some Tabasco and used less cheese (only because I don't know how to measure a pound of cheese, LOL). Nuke the spinach for a few minutes right in the box, then press it through a colander to drain the water.

I continue to get raves whenever I bring this dish to a party.  As is, the recipe is a little too greasy & fatty for my taste so I followed some of the other readers' adivice and made the following changes:
used two eggs
melted one T.butter in the baking dish
used 2c. cheddar and 1/4c. parmesean

Thanks Irene!

Very tasty and easy, thank you!  A couple of small  things: I skipped the butter entirely, and used Pam.  It worked fine and this recipe does not need more oil in it.  We served it with jalapeno ranch dressing as a dip, which was great, and I added granulated garlic and tabasco for spice.  Next time I will add even more for kick, but it went over well with the modifications noted.

I think this is a winner even though I wasn't particularly impressed with the flavor of them - everyone else was though!  I did add some garlic powder (didn't really seem to help with flavor much) and some Frank's Red Hot (I'm going to add more next time to give it a little more zing), and will probably add minced garlic instead of garlic powder next time.  I do agree with previous reviewers that it was a tad too greasy, I'd halve the butter next time.  All in all a hit!

My dh and I found this recipe quite 'blah' although a friend of ours loved it.  If I made it again, I might add a can of chopped green chiles to give it some zing.

Very nice flavor & easy to make. I have made these in small batches and large batches (multiplied the recipe by 5 for a wedding reception).  Always a favorite whenever I make them-lots of raves.

New Year's Eve dinner party success!  I used this as a side dish and got a semi-standing ovation.  Because one guest cannot tolerate onions, I omitted them.  I do have to admit to tasting a bit before the dinner by trimming around the outside - fortunately, by dint of extreme self-control, I was able to leave enough for my guests.

This is a great recipe. But I've substituted feta for the cheddar (feta is beta!) and used 1/4 c. chopped fresh red onion instead of the onion flakes. Still easy and quick -- and gets rave reviews.

This was easy to make and delicious!  I made it with fresh spinach from the garden and used vanilla almond milk because I was out of cow's milk.  It will worked perfectly!  I also used about half of the cheese the recipe calls for.  I can't imagine using the full amount.

I've been using a similar recipe for years but with **Montery Jack Cheese**, loved by many.   I've also made it with brocolli and cheddar, but the texture is a little different, I think it is harder to get the moisture out of the brocolli.

LOVE THESE! I used pepper jack cheese and half a red onion chopped.  Next time I will add either garlic or hot sauce to give it a little more kick, but we ate these for snacks and breakfast for a week. They keep very well in the fridge and warm up nicely!

These came out perfect!  Just like I remember... I took them to work and they were a huge hit.  As an improvisational chef I subbed some garlic powder for the minced onion since I didn't have it the first time I made it and it was really great too.

This recipe was a bit bland.  If I make it again, I might add some hot pepper flakes, or just salt and pepper.

This recipe brings back fond memories. It does need some tweaks. I make it with a teaspoon of salt (and without the onions), and I usually reduce the amount of cheese; I find the full pound makes them a little too greasy for my tastes! The butter is also too much; you're fine just greasing the pan or using Pam.  Anyway, these are highly recommended and will be a hit at any get-together!

These are fantastic.  I will use a spay on the pan next time to cut down on butter.  Also used some garlic powder and red pepper flakes.  Freeze very well, taste just as good re-heated.  I'm making these for a cocktail party on Friday.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were really greasy.  I didn't like the flavour at all and even adding garlic as suggested didn't help.  Might have put too much spinach or cheese(??) but not what I expected at all.  My boyfriend LOVED it though, so maybe it's just taste...

This recipe was quick and easy to make.  I made it for Thanksgiving and my family loved it and asked for the recipe. I used exactly what the recipe called for but, added a teaspoon of minced garlic. It was delicious.

This is one of my family and friends favorite recipe. However, I only use "one" 10 oz. package of frozen chopped spinach, 1 cup of 2%fat milk, 1/2 chopped onion and 1 cup of grated cheddar cheese.

Delicious!!  I made a few SMALL changes based on other reviews...I used 1/2 the cheese (and fat-free), added a little seasoned salt and cut out the butter and sprayed my pan with Pam instead.  They turned out great and are soooo easy to make!  Thanks!

For those of you who, like me, need to have instructions spelled out for you - THAW the spinach as step 1!!!  Otherwise you will be trying to mix a square block of spinach into the rest of the ingredients.

Now for the review - went over well at the party, but husband and I thought it was a little bland.  This is after adding about 8 shakes of tabasco, some garlic powder and red pepper flakes.  I sprayed the dish with cooking spray instead of butter and used a little less cheese.  Overall it was pretty good and makes a nice addition to an array of appetizers, so even if it isn't my favorite I will probably make it again.

These were not good at all.  Made them for a get-together and asked people what they thought - no one liked them.  Not enough flavor.  Sorry!

I just love these squares I could eat the whole pan. I did add 1/2 tsp. seasoned salt and a couple of dashes of hot sauce. It just adds a little more zip.

I agree with one of the previous reviewers... these were quite greasy.  I think cutting back to 1 Tblsp. of butter might be enough because of the grease in the cheese.  Also I would prefer more of a zing in flavor (maybe a dash of crushed red pepper?).... But they were easy to make ahead.  Everyone who likes spinach enjoyed them.

I made these as part of a bavkstage buffet for a concert I catered.  Doubled the recipe and baked it a 13x9 pan.  Used a mixture of cheddar and parmesan.  Let it chill overnight, then cut into small squares.  Since I had no kitchen facilities on site, these were served---and scarfed up rapidly--at room temperature!

Not quite sure what happened here. I followed the instructions exactly and I now have a 9x13 cheesy bread with some spinach sprinkled throughout. Spinach certainly doesn't take the front and center stage like it does in the picture.

Maybe next time I'll double the spinach.

Awesome recipe! I lost my mothers recipe and was lucky to find this one, it tastes exactly the same! I leave out the onion and swap the cheddar cheese for mozzarella cheese, but those are the only changes I make. Thank you for adding this!

First of all I doubled the recipe, then I added mushrooms and used a shallot instead of onion but it flopped and they were bland. Hardly anyone ate them.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but we thought this was gummy.  We tried to like it because we love spinach and cheese, but just couldn't get a taste for it.  It was bland even after I added some salt, pepper & garlic powder.  The consistency was just weird.  I also didn't understand why it should cool for 45 minutes, then it was lukewarm.  Maybe if it was hot it would be better?  I won't make this again.

I made these for Easter and we found them bland.  They need more spice--salt, onion, garlic.  Something.  
I think if I make them again, I might use one pkg. spinach and one can of artichoke hearts and increase the seasonings.

This recipe is reallly good.  I did make a few changes.  I used 3/4 cup of cheese.  The whole pound was just too much the first time.  I also used a tsp. of onion powder instead of minced onion.  Also, I added about 1/4 tsp. of fresh grated nutmeg.  I know it sounds crazy, but I thought it would give it that little oomph, it does for creamed spinach!  It is delicious.

Well received by my family.   I used only half the cheese (sharp cheddar) and used a mix of unsweetened coconut/almond/dairy milk.

This is a good basic recipe but I found it a bit bland when I followed the directions as is. When I made it the second time I used dehydrated minced onions, about 2 to 3 Tbls., added a tsp. of both onion  and garlic powder. I also used freshly graded sharp cheddar and sprinkled about a quarter cup of grated Romano/Asiago/parmesan on top before I baked it. The changes made all the difference in the world: rich, flavorful and more complex. Truly yummy as one of my appitizers before Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone said they were delicious!

This recipe is a crowd pleaser! Very easy to make, just make sure to squeeze all the water out of the spinach once it's thawed. I used a fine strainer and squeezed the water out through it. Also, I did make some tweaks to the recipe to add more flavor. I used a combo of sharp cheddar and Parmesan cheese (4:1 ratio), added powdered roasted garlic (1 teaspoon) and nutmeg (1/2 teaspoon) to the batter, and increased the amount of minced onions by 1 teaspoon. I only used a small pat of butter in the dish. If you use a brush or paper towel, it's easy to spread the smaller amount of melted butter all over the baking dish. Super tasty!

Great recipe! For added flavor, I used a whole onion, minced, and sprinkled thyme on top. I've also made this with 8 oz. chopped mushrooms (sauteed before added), and it came out great. My toddler loves this too so I freeze some of the squares and defrost for him as needed. Yum!

A friend turned me on to this recipe.  However we use 1/2 the spinach.  It's awesome!

These were very easy to make and very tastey.  My 1year old daughter who gives a fight with any veggies loved them. Thanks!

This was not for us. I know they are spinach squares, but it was just too much.

Just like my mother-in-law makes.  Delicious holiday favorite.  Good way to get little ones to each spinach.

This was very easy to make and was very tasty.  I think you could also serve this as dinner with a fruit salad. I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a superbowl party last year and it was very much enjoyed by my guest. I have been asked to prepare it again this year. I am looking forward to it. It is yummy!
