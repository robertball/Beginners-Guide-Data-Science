I've been making this recipe for several years now. My husband likes it better than a traditional pie crust quiche. The only difference in the way I prepare it is to press the thawed hash browns between sheets of paper towel pressing as much moisture out as possible. Then after putting in the pan and brushing with butter, it gets baked at 425 for 25 minutes. That makes a well browned crust instead of damp and mushy. Make the egg and milk mixture adding any combination of meats, chopped vegetables and cheese. Be sure to test the center of the quiche for doneness before removing from oven (a knife inserted in middle comes out clean). A great meal!

I have made this recipe several times with some changes.  I shred potatoes instead of using frozen.  After browning the potatoes in the oven, I layer some shredded cheese and sliced ham to keep the egg from baking through the potatoes.  I also put the cheese on top instead of mixing with the egg.

This is a great dish! I made it to take to work when we were sampling different quiche recipes and everyone loved it.  I reduced the amount of butter to 1 Tbsp. instead of 1/4 cup.  I made another one for my friends to taste and they loved it to.  Great recipe Susan!

Okay, so now I will never again use a pastry crust for quiche!!  Which is good, because I'm sensitive to wheat and this is SO much easier.  Don't worry about crisping the bottom, it probably won't happen even if you bake it longer (which I did) and it doesn't matter.  An EXCELLENT way to make the filling is with diced pepperoni and cheddar (instead of the ham and swiss) with the additions of green pepper, onion, and some tomato if you wish. If you're worried about leakage through the crust, put a few slices on Buddig meat (ham, turkey, whatever) to coat the bottom before adding filling.  This went over BIG at Christmas brunch.  I'm telling you, you've got to try the pepperoni and cheddar combo!

A very good recipe yet a little bland.  I will be making this again but adding a few extra ingredients to give it some extra kick.  I followed one of the reviewers advice and patted my thawed hash browns in paper towels and brushed with melted butter, the crust crisped up nicely.  Thanks.

I served this quiche last night when a few friends showed up for dinner unannounced.  I had baked the quiche the night before since I was planning on getting home late from work and not having time to cook dinner.  After about 2 minutes in the microwave it was ready to serve and got rave reviews from both my husband and our friends, who wanted the recipe.  Instead of using ham I substituted bacon and added chopped red pepper, green pepper, onion, and mushrooms.  I did not have any packaged frozen hash browns, so I shredded two potatoes in my food processor.  Like most of the reviewers I had trouble getting the potatoes to brown.  I think next time I will cook the hash browns in a skillet with a little bit of oil as I would any hash browns, and then transfer to the pan to top with ingredients and bake so that they have the crunch that I love in hash browns.  This is a very versatile recipe I look forward to experimenting with it.

This was excellent.  I made several changes.  I did not thaw the potato before pressing into the pie pan and I baked it at 400 degrees for roughly 20 minutes before adding the filling.  I used spinach, sauted mushrooms and onions, and grandulated garlic in place of ham and I used sharp cheddar and two slices of white american for the cheese.  I also used just 4 eggs and half and half instead of milk (that's what I had).  After baking for 20 minutes at 400 degrees the crust was brown and crispy and everyone loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.

The first quiche I've ever made and it turned out "good" in my husband's words - who is THE chef in the family.  I melted the butter first in the oven, added a chopped onion to that, pressed the thawed potatoes and baked for 25 minutes, then added the egg mixture.  Baked for 30 more minutes.  Let it cool for about 10 minutes befor cutting.  Wonderful brunch idea.  Thank you....

I loved this recipe. I did not use all the butter that it called for, actually I used the spray marg. to cut down on calories. I bought sliced swiss and layed it on the bottom of the potatoes then chopped frozen and squeezed dried spinach then poured the eggs on top and then added more cheese. I used 3 whole eggs and 2 whites and the milk was a can of evaporated skim milk. It was lower in calories but fabulous. I will make this again and in muffin tins for brunch with friends.

I used about 4-5 cups frozen shredded potato mixed with 1/4 c canola oil, salt and pepper.  Baked that in 425 oven for 20 min.  For the filling I added bacon, diced onion, corn, and peas, and decreased the cheese to 1/2 cup of mozarella.  Baked that in 375 oven for 25 min (at 20 min it wasn't done yet).  I really liked how the potato browned on the bottom of the pie plate and the edges were crunchy.  Definitely will make this again.

This is a GREAT recipe!  I made it for a meeting I was hosting at my work.  Because we have a vegetarian employee, I just used red, yellow and green peppers, onions and green chilies along with tons of cheese.  I took other peoples' advice and layered slices of (meunster) cheese on top of the cooked hash browns.  Then I used 2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar for the inside.  It was so easy!  I did it the night before and it warmed up in 4 minutes the next morning in the microwave.  I should say, I didn't get to try it because everyone else ate all of it.  But I had a few people ask me for the recipe and everyone said it was soooo good.  :)

Easy and fast for dinner.  My kids ate it without complaints, though my 4 year old picked out the ham pieces first. I didn't really get the potato crust brown until it was baking with the filling. Maybe a few minutes under the broiler before filling?  I am making again on Saturday for a sorority brunch.  I think it will be a hit.

Placed all ingredients in a rectangular dish rather than pie dish and will very please with outcome.  Wasn't too crazy with the leftovers, but nothing went wasted.

WoW! I just made and ate this quiche...ate a slice that is. I made a couple of substitutions with the cheese. I used Asiago, sharp cheddar, and parmesan. I suteed mushrooms and onions, then added freshly grated potatos. After they were browned I added the mixture to my pammed pie pan. I also substituted scrapple as I had no more bacon or ham. While browning the hashbrowns the scrapple was cooking in the oven. I aso added 2 more eggs as 5 left a very thin layer over the other ingredients. It turned out great! Absolutely delicious. Thank you for this easy and dellicious recipe.

This is tasty. I had to cook it way longer than the instructions stated (20 minutes longer) and I think it's because the potatoes were thawed but COLD from being in the fridge. It threw off the cooking time quite a bit. I omitted the butter and used Pam spray to brown the potatoes (because it's less calories and I'm lazy, too) and I omitted the milk entirely so that I wouldn't have a wet filling (we like our quiches on the omelet side of done). I think in the future I would bring my potatoes to room temp while draining them in a colander or something. Thanks for the recipe!

I enjoyed this.  Be sure to cook the potatoes until they START to brown before adding the egg mixture.  Add vegetables if you like.  It is really wonderful!

This was alright. A little too much potato for me. That's pretty much all I could taste. I was hoping the crust would've been crispier, but it was pretty mushy. I patted dry the thawed potatoes as others suggested, and baked for at least 15 minutes before adding the egg mixture. I also had to bake the egg mixture longer than the instructions stated.

I doubled this recipe because I had several people to feed.  I used a 9x13 inch casserole dish.  I used fresh potatoes and grated them into the bottom of the dish, tossed them with a little garlic salt, pepper and a couple cloves of minced garlic.  Baked according to the directions and proceeded with the rest of the recipe.  I did use bacon instead of ham, mozzarella instead of swiss, added goat cheese, chopped zucchini, chopped yellow squash and pepper flakes.  Since I used a larger container to cook it, it took longer to bake, 40 minutes later, we had a delicious dinner! Thank you! I was looking for something that used potato instead of pie crust.  This was spot on! :)

Great, easy to make recipe. I added cooked sausage to mine and used the spray butter instead of all the butter it called for. It turned out fantastic. My 2 year old daughter ate nearly 1/4 by herself! Great recipe Susan! I submitted a photo!

Very good base recipe.  Great gluten free idea for an alternative to a regular crust.  I used shredded left over baked potatoes instead of frozen hash browns and olive oil instead of butter.  Cooking time for the "crust" was 18 minutes.  The amount of milk requested seemed too much so I used 1/8 cup.  I made two of these.  One with the ingredients above and the other using fresh spinach instead of ham and adding some parmigiano reggiano cheese.  The original was a bit bland.  Maybe Swiss cheese is too mild.  Thank you for this recipe.  I will definitely use this as a base for more recipes in the future.

This is a great recipe. I find the cook time to be longer than indicated here, but otherwise it's an easy recipe to make and the results are filling and delicious.

I always made this recipe with bacon instead of the ham, and I usually modify this recipe by adding 2 cups of chopped up vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, peppers). If you add veggies you'll want to add an extra egg and some extra cheese to adequately cover the vegetables. 

A few reviewers have suggested adding chopped onion, but when I tried this I found that the onion flavor really overpowered the dish, so I never add onions anymore.

Perfect! Just perfect. I microwaved 3 russets, let them cool in the fridg overnight, then thick shredded them as the crust. I could not believe how easily and pretty the quiche sliced. This will be a lifetime brunch standby.

I made this with grated, leftover baked potatoes.  Sprayed the dish with Pam, then sprayed the grated potatoes with spray Parkay and sprinkled on some seasoning salt.  I added some broccoli and added some canned french fried onion rings to the top.  It was truly delicious.

I used sausage and it was great. I browned the hash browns in the oven Christmas Eve and browned the sausage. Christmas morning, I just threw it all together and cooked it in the oven for 20 minutes. everyone raved!

Needs a vegetable for sure.  I would try spinach.  I added onions as well, but be sure to finely mince the onions.    I added the recipe amount of ham (good quality too), but it wasn't enough flavor.  I would suggest adding bacon to it, for a crunch!.   Also, I would recommend browning the hash brown before adding the remainder of the mix.  I would probably do it to a medium-brown to add crunch in the crust, otherwise it will be the same texture as the mixture.    Other than that, I needed more salt to enhance the flavor.  Will retry with the adds to see how well this goes.  Five star for a great base recipe!

This was amazingly easy and fast!  My boyfriends 6-year old son loved it - he even had seconds which he never does.  I will definitely be making this a regulary in our household.

For some reason my potato crust did not get brown and crisp. In the finished quiche, they still were white and raw tasting. Otherwise the recipe was very good. I added canned artichokes, drained and chopped, and some sauteed sweet onion. They were good additions.

This is a wonderful quiche recipe!  The potatoes browned nicely on the outside as they should, they're not going to brown on the inside with the filling...I think if you bake the crust too long before adding the filling, it would be overdone and too crunchy.  I mixed the seasonings, hash browns, and butter together in a bowl before pressing into the pan.  I thought it was terrific and much better than the traditional pie crust.  Good job!

I love the concept of this recipe, but I also had trouble getting the crust to brown.  I even turned the oven up 25 degrees while baking it.  I will keep playing with it though because it is so good.  The nice thing about it is I can enjoy a quiche and don't have to mess with making a pie crust.

The combination of ingredients made for a good tasting quiche, but I tried this recipe for the potato crust which I found to be dissapointing.  I couldn't get it to brown nicely (even under the broiler).  I may try again, with more potatoes, and maybe some flour and egg to bind it together.  The filling leaked through the potato crust and stuck to the bottom of the pan.  I would also season the crust a bit more.  A good recipe that needs a bit of tweaking.  Thanks for sharing.

I used 3 raw potatoes and shredded them added some shredded red onio sea salt/peper and 2 T of flour to potato mixture patted on bottom of pie plate and drizzled with olive oil and baked 20 minutes at 400.  Then I put one can of artichoke hearts halved on the bottom and them 10 diced greek olives over chokes and then poured egg mixture over and placed sliced tomotoes on top with feta cheese.  Divine!  Bake another 20 minutes at 375.  I did add some garlic powder to egg mixture and 1 t. itailan seasoning.

I wasn't wild about this, though the two eating with me liked it.  Meh.  (If you're someone whose favorite part of the quiche is the crust, then no matter how much you love hash browns, this will probably be a letdown.)

tasty! We just changed a few veggies/meats around... although, the swiss cheese didn't go over that well, the family probably would have like cheddar or gouda better.

This made an easy dinner. I used a bag of refrigerated, not frozen, hash browns and I added one chopped and sauteed medium onion to the potato because I suspected it would need something more. I cooked the potato crust for 30 minutes on 450 to get it as crispy as possible before adding the egg mixture. I had sliced swiss, not shredded, and I used about 10 oz of that, diced. I think it may have been too much b/c the dish was very cheesy, but my husband loved it! I accidentally cooked it on 350, not 375, so this took more than 20 minutes fo me. And once it came out, it should have sat 5-10 minutes because it was very runny. All in all, a good recipe I might try again!

This recipe was so good that I made it for dinner two nights in a row!  I took the advice that someone had posted earlier and pressed the potatoes between paper towels to get rid of excess moisture- that makes the potatoes nice and crispy!  This is a great recipe, especially for people who don't really like pastry crust.

This recipe came out perfect for me. The quiche held up well, and wasn't too eggy like other quiches. The hasbrowns did not brown, even putting them under the broiler for a few minutes, but this did not take away from the recipe. VERY EASY and quick. Will definitely make this again.

I thought this was missing something - a lot of flavor. I switched out the ham for bacon based on what I had, but followed the rest of the recipe to the T (with the exception of shredding my own potatoes).  I did have the problem of the sogginess because I didn't pat dry the potatoes, but we weren't going to eat it the day of anyways - I was making it for breakfasts to take to work. I do think my bacon was bland and that didn't help, but I think seasonings are needed here. I wish I could have loved this more - it was easy tho a little time consuming as compared to other breakfast casseroles and I don't know that I will take the time to play with seasonings to get this right.

I gave it 5 stars just for the hash brown crust idea. Never thought of that before! I added some chopped red onion and sliced fresh mushrooms, used cheddar instead of mozzarella, and added some chopped hot peppers (Serrano, habanero, datil and thai chiles)to give it some zing. it really makes the crust like crunchy hashbrowns if you use a stoneware pie pan.

I thought this was pretty good. I loved how quick it was to throw together. I made a couple of subs, for what I had on hand. I used Simply Potatoes southwestern blend shredded potatoes. If making this, I recommend a more flavored potato. This casserole is about half potatoes. I also subbed the ham with turkey breakfast sausage I made the other day from the site. Lastly, I didn't have swiss cheese. I had a shredded cheddar blend with cream cheese. So, I went with that. I used the same proportion of everything, except the cheese I only had a little over a cup. I thought the calories seemed high, but then realized it only showed the recipe as 4 servings. A 9x9 pan can easily be cut into 8 regular servings. I baked the hash browns for 25 minutes. There was only slight browning on the edges at that point. So, maybe an additional 5 minutes would have been good for a more crisp consistency. I had this problem with similar layered hash brown casseroles calling for pre-baking them. It always takes longer than suggested to crisp up. Once I added the eggs, it took 25 more minutes for them to set up. ty

I liked this recipe- But I took some liberty with this one (Who can mess up quiche?) and I used a half package of Chorizo and cooked that up in a skillet with some white onion and added it to the potato before I added the ham and eggs.  I topped with a 1/2 cup of Manchego cheese.  It was a great Christmas morning breakfast for us.  I gave it 4 stars and really enjoyed it - but I think I will have to be more discerning with my 5 stars for future reference.  DH really liked it.

It was very good.  I used skim milk and it still turned out fluffy.  Also, My grocery store did not have shredded potatoes so I used small round hash browns and it still turned out great!

This recipe tasted great once it was finished. However I did have a hard time getting the hash browns to turn. When I finally added the rest of the ingredients the bottom tasted more like mashed potatoes than hash brown, but it was still good. I did add spinach on the top wich I thought made the dish great. This is a great recipe though, next time I will plan on more time for baking the potatoe crust! Thanks for this recipe!

Followed recipe, with exception of adding two more eggs and a little more milk (large pie dish).  Recipe was just so-so, my family and I were not impressed.  The potatoes were a nice touch but were very soft and almost invisible.  The flavor was bland - even added in some omlette seasoning and it still didn't perk up.  Quite a disappointment, despite the previous reviews.

I was really expecting to like this considering I like all of the ingredients, and most of the reviews were good. However, I didn't really care for it. I couldn't even taste the hashbrowns. They were a little crispy, because I took the previous advice and baked it for about 40 min before adding the filling. I would've given it a 2, but I DID go back for seconds.

This was very good and quite easy for a dinner in a hurry. It needed some extra seasoning though. Some zip. I'll have fun toying around with it util then. I would happily recommend it. Thanks for a great recipe!

I like the concept, however, the potato's didn't crisp on the bottom as much as I hoped it would. I will try it again.

This was very good. My husband loved it. Due to food allergies I made a few changes. I used Japanese sweet potatoes for the crust and coconut milk for the milk and goat cheese.

I had no issues with sticking or the crust not browning. I used a glass pie pan. I thawed the potatoes overnight and pressed them with paper towels to dry them some. When I baked the potatoes I had my oven in convection mode. When I baked the egg part I turned convection off. This was very good. I changed the filling ingredients to suit what I had on hand. I used cheddar cheese, bacon, green onion, sausage and fresh spinach and mild green chili’s.

I had to reduce the butter in half and bake it at 425 like others for 25-30 min. to toast the hashbrowns.  I also added 1/2 yellow onion sauteed.  After it was sauteed I added in a clove garlic and 1 cup chopped fresh spinach just to wilt.  Added that to the recipe ingredients and poured in on the crust.  Great flavor and texture.  One could even pan sear the ham a bit to get rid of some excess liquid from the finished product if you wanted.

I would make this dish again.  My husband loved it.  I added some canned green chilis, a bit of dry mustard, sauteed onion, and some sour cream.  I lowered the amount of milk because I wanted to use up some ingredients.

My husband and I really like this quiche for breakfast. I made it exactly as the recipe the first time and it was very good. Since then I have made substitutions for the ham with bacon and breakfast sausage. Also I have added onion, green chilies, increased the eggs a little and left out the milk or used canned coconut milk in its place. All changes have turned out well!  I make this weekly by doubling the recipe and baking it in an 11 x 16 Pyrex casserole dish for 30 minutes.  I cut it into 12 singles servings and package it up for breakfasts at work. We have not tired of eating this quiche for breakfast yet and we are going on week 6. Just change up the ingredients each time and it will taste different. Enjoy!

It took more time:  the crust took 20 minutes and the quiche took 30 minutes and wasn’t quite done but let it sit for ten minutes. Perfect. I found Kraft shredded Vermont cheddar,  sharp cheddar and mild cheddar in one bag. I am lactose intolerant so used sweetened almond milk. Had some asparagus so put some on top. No salt or pepper. It was outstanding!  Served with a salad and can’t wait to have

Good recipe to have for breakfast or even a meal.  I agree with other reviewer that you have to press the thawed potatoes between paper towels to remove all that water!  I also agree that it must be baked at 425 to get the crust done, as the potatoes still have a lot of water in them even after using paper towels.

Made this for dinner last night.  This is an extremely versatile recipe.  I had no trouble getting a crisp crust.  I pressed the hash browns between paper towels then put them in a ziplock bag with a few tablespoons of olive oil and a teaspoon of Morton’s Season Blend.  Shook it good to coat before pressing into pie plate.  I used Parmesan cheese, chopped bacon, fresh baby spinach and diced red pepper that I layered in pie crust before adding the egg mixture.  I thinly slices a tomato and arranged it on top.  I will definitely be making this again!

Made it twice, and I'd definitely make it again!  This works well with a variety of veggis; I also substitute a couple of flax eggs for the "real" eggs. 

Squeeze out the moisture  from the potato prior to baking if you're using fresh, and you can change up the cheese. This is a super forgiving recipe.

I used 6 egg whites (I am on a restricted diet) and Almond Milk (For the same reason) and only 2 Tablespoons of butter instead of 4. I cooked it about 40 minutes and it was PERFECT.  Delicious, light and everyone had seconds. I could not believe how easy it was. I served this with fresh red grapes, steaming hot coffee and fresh juice. Perfect quick brunch recipe.

I cooked the shredded potatoes longer than recipe said. Then I put them under broiler for 3 mins. Browned great. Came out very crispy. Very tasty quiche. Would make it again . My company loved it.

This came out really good. I had frozen diced hash browns on hand so used those, it worked. I layered hte ham on the bottom as others had suggested. Only had slices of swiss so those went on top of the ham. I sauteed a little orange bell pepper and onion, then wilted kale in the pan with the pepper & onion. Let it cool then added to the eggs & milk and poured on top. Both the potato crust & quiche took a little longer to cook but came out great! Served with fruit & yogurt. Great breakfast.

Loved the taste. To adapt to my taste, would try a small helping of pineapple, or ,spinach, corn and broccoli. 
Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious change to my crustless quiche. Added chopped cooked broccoli and used spiralized, riced potatoes for the crust. Will definitely make again.

Very good! I used Bob Evans sausage instead of ham, and half and half instead of milk. Also added some sautéed onions.  Liked the potato crust.

Loved this recipe! Took the advice of another review and dried out potatoes and baked at pre baked at 425 for 25 minutes. Used sausage and onions for meat. Great for breakfast!

I been making quiche for years now using dehydrated hash browns, I buy Golden Grill Russet Hash Browns by the case from AMZ, the individual cartons make about 3 cups of hydrated potatoes, I use about 1/2 to 3/4 c. of hot water to hydrate for about 10 minutes, after hydrating, I add 1/4 cup of melted butter and a teaspoon of powdered onion, sometimes a dash of paprika to the potatoes. The rest of the recipe I make the same using ham or sausage and sometimes topping it with a handful of French Fried  onions out of the can. I always use 5 eggs and a 1/3 cup of cream and whatever type cheese I happen to have on hand.  I never do use cheddar only white cheeses like Swiss, Gruyere, Comte, etc., the white dryer cheeses keep their consistency a little better if you have a slice or two left over and want to have it later in the day.

I'm going to try making this with the carton of hash browns they sell at Costco because I have a gluten free guest.  But the recipe forgot to mention the 1c.vegetables as an ingredient.  Good thing I read the description.  It looks like spinach was used in the image but no mention of spinach or vegetables in the recipe.

This is a fabulous recipe but here are some tips for making it better.  I purchase dehydrated potatoes from Costco (come in a 6 pack).  They come in small cartons and called "Idaho Spuds, golden Grill Hashbrown potatoes."  After hydrating, make sure you press/drain the water out of them through a colander.  Then .  . . butter your pie plate (helps potatoes brown on the bottom) then spray or brush with butter.  When the crust starts getting brown, turn off the oven and let crust remain in there for about 10-15 minutes.  This will dry out the crust and make it more crisp.  You can freeze the baked crust also and it turns out great!  

Also, make sure your crust is pressed in thinly . . . I made it thicker one time and there was just too much potato.  Don[t worry if the edges start to brown darker . . . just cover them with a little foil.  This is one of my favorite recipes.  You can substitute ham for bacon, add green chilies and cumin and a little chili powder.  Serve with sour cream and fresh salsa and people will rave!

Ok recipe. I would have added more meat - like bacon. It lacked flavor (for me). The consistency was good and potatoes cooked nicely. I did add more butter to potatoes which helped to cook the bottom of the "crust". I would make it again - but add green chilies or veggies or something to add flavor. I should have read the reviews! They are always helpful!

I really enjoyed this recipe. 4 stars because cook time is off. I cooked the potatoes for 25 minutes and didn't get a crunch texture but that was ok in this recipe. I also used potatoes o'brian(shredded) personal preference. 25 minutes at 250 didn't cook middle had to stick it in at 425 another 10. I think 425 for 25 may have worked. I loved the idea and taste of this will definitely make again.

My son gets sick with regular quiche because of the cream my husband hates onions. This recipe turned out perfect the boys loved it.   The only thing I changed was I didn't have frozen hash browns so the night before I baked extra potatoes and just peeled and shredded the baked potatoes in the morning. Turned out amazing my son ate 2 huge servings alone. Amazing recipe!!!

I agreed with chellebelle about the potatoes.  I did the same thing,  taking her advice to press them between paper towels and baking them for 25 minutes at 425. I used boxed dehydrated potatoes that i cook with often following the regular hydrating ands draining directions before doing between towels and baking.  We don't like frozen hash.  My husband won't eat eggs really.  He had 3 slices the first time i made it and then took it to work for his breakfast!  This is awesome!

Very tasty!  I used reduced fat cheddar instead of swiss, and I melted the butter in the dish while the oven was preheating and stirred the shredded potatoes into the butter, but I accidentally put in a whole stick of butter instead of a half.  It was delicious!  I'll try it again with the proper amount of butter, but if it doesn't stack up, I'm going back to a whole stick because it was really fabulous :)

Made this for breakfast today.  I used leftover hash browns, so there was no issue with them getting brown as others had.  Diced some leftover ham, added a bit of  onion and a small red pepper.  Put about half the cheese in with the egg mixture and the other half on top.  Turned out wonderful with a small piece leftover for lunch tomorrow.  Could easily make this for dinner with a mixed green salad.  Thanks for posting, Susan Spickelmier.

Very good use of our leftover Easter ham! I used more hash browns, patted them into a larger pan, used 2 cups of cheddar cheese instead of swiss, and doubled everything else except the butter. I prefer casseroles such as this with bread, because even with the extra browning step, the potatoes don't get crisp enough for me. We still enjoyed it--thanks Susan!

Very nice for a Sunday morning brunch. I cooked the heck out the potatoes, as suggested by other reviewers, but they still ended up tasting more like mashed potatoes on the bottom. It didn't matter though, because everyone agreed that the flavor was lovely. I used some shredded smoked gouda and scallions in this quiche as well.

This was so good!  I loved the hashbrown crust!  My daughter said it tasted like cheesy french fries.  I used cheddar cheese and bacon, instead of swiss and ham.  This is a keeper!

Also very good with chorizo and monterey jack cheese.  I also had trouble getting the crust to brown, but liked the way the egg filled in the gaps in the potatoes.
