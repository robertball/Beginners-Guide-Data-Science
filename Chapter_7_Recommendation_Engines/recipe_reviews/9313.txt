This recipe can actually be one of the best shortbread cookie recipes.  The only error is that there shouldn't be 1 cup of butter, only 3/4 cup butter.

I quadrupled this recipe for a large group.  the previous reviewer is right, only use 3/4 cup butter..  Also make sure your cherries are thawed out or fresh.  I might even replace some of the powdered sugar with granulated sugar, and add some vanilla for flavor.  I love shortbread, but this needed a little something!

I was very disappointed with the recipe. I made it twice and tried adding extra flour the second time since the cookies ran all over my baking sheet the first time. Sorry, but I would not recommend this one.

In this recipe, the short bread came out softer than i would have expected. I ended up tapping the uncooked dough with my finger rather than using the floured fork. I was pleasantly surprised when i ended up with purple cookies. I used frozen cherries, and some of the juice ended up in the batter. But in the future, i plan to  just make shortbread thumbprints and use cherry preserves. The cookies were more bland than i had hoped. But, put a plate full in front of me and i'll still devour them.

EASY TO MAKE. WE LOVED THESE COOKIES. IMADE THEM STRICTLY FOLLOWING THE RECIPE THE FIRST TIME. THEY WERE GREAT. THE SECOND TIME I ADDED VANILLA AND COCONUT. THEY STILL TURNED OUT GREAT.

Is there a certain technique I'm missing out on regarding shortbread cookies?  As another reviewer states back in 2000 these ran all over my baking sheet as well.  They're flatter than a pancake and I'm disappointed.  I don't recommend using this recipe if you're not sure what you're doing.  Try a recipe with more in depth instructions.

I had some fresh cherries we had just picked, and was looking for some different ways to use them.  This were great. Very rich and yummy.

Loved them! I used pitted sour cherries and put chocolate chips on top before baking. I did increase the baking time to 14 mins. to get them more of a golden brown.

This shortbread is VERY soft, the adjustments I made to it are as follows, I used 3/4 cup butter, and 1/4 Maraschino cherry juice, and 1/2 cup chopped drained maraschino cherries.  They come out very pretty, and then you can either drizzle them with some white chocolate or cookie icing.  They look lovely on your Xmas Cookie tray and are always a hit!

I did not enjoy these - to me they just ended up tasting like cornstarch.  I added vanilla and decreased the butter to 3/4 c as recommended by other reviewers.  I will not be making these again.

Soooooo delicious and light!  I used the full 1 cup of butter and these cookies came out great!  I do recommend using 3/4 cup of cherries, though.

I thought this were incredible! I actually did not have corn starch so I thought I was doomed for the beginning but was wrong! They ended up in being great!!! My husband loved them, and our two friends. I recommend making them without the corn starch and going for it!

I can't say I've made too many shortbread cookies but these were melt in your mouth amazing. Thank you for the tip to only use 3/4 cup butter, I dare say that you might be able to get away with only 1/2 cup butter.

Sorry, I had high hopes.  Very little flavour and apart from freezing them, they constantly broke apart.  Too much butter, too little sugar.

I made these using marichino cherries, and thought they were sort of bland.  Maybe if you used a fresh cherry, they would have more flavor.  Also, they do fall apart using one cup of butter, but they also melt in your mouth!!  Will not make again, but they are a really pretty little cookie!

With the changes I made it is a 5 star review - Use 3/4 cup of butter (not a full cup) and chill the dough for an hour before baking.
Without these changes I would rate this recipe a 2.

I used 3/4 cup butter per reviews.  Also used canned water packed cherries, drained well on paper towel, saved juice, added a little powdered sugar to make glaze for cookie...my husband hasn't even tried these yet but I know he will love them, I should have doubled the batch!

Taste is great, reduced butter to 3/4 cup. Texture is a bit cornstarch-y, might try reducing the amount next time. Bake for 15 min at least.

I will probably make these again, but OMIT the cornstarch--that was the after-taste they left, and that kind of spoiled them.  I'll be substituting ARROWROOT powder the next time I try these,  If I'm still not satisfied, I'll try cake flour...we shall see.

Not impressed.  Mine were flat so I feel like there is something missing in one of the steps.  I've read other reviews that stated they had the same issue.  As far as the flavour, I think it could use vanilla or almond extract.    I'm not so sure I can recommend this recipe but some of the chefs here wrote reviews that said they were quite happy.

The taste of these cookies was actually not bad, I added a little vanilla and some of the cherry juice. The problem is how flat they bake, I didn't even fork them and they still flattened right out. Then they just fell apart trying to move them from the cookie sheet, and anywhere else. I added a little flour for the last ones I baked and they stayed thicker, but then tasted too blandI won't make them again.

The cookies were super flat and spread out a lot. When I tried to move them off the cookie tray they all crumbled. I didn't want to waste the rest of the batter but didn't want to spend time on cookies that were going to be a waste, so I spread the rest of the batter in a glass baking dish (I think a 9x9) and cooked it for about 25 minutes.  It seems to have worked better to make squares instead of cookies. I let it cool completely and just now cut a small square, it didn't crumble to pieces and it was thicker than the cookies were. I may try this again, it tastes pretty good when done, but I don't know.

Little flavor and break too easily.
