HORRIBLE - the only word I can use to describe this recipe.   I followed the recipe exactly and it was not good.  Too much of a garlic taste, too thick. Maybe I did something wrong.  Definately will remove this from my recipe box.

This was good but not great! I had to add salt and pepper because it was a little bland. I think next time a may have to try a different recipe.

This is such a simple soup to make, and it goes a long way on flavor.  And I had everything in my pantry to make it.  I would just add celery to make this more like my Nonna made it.  Don't skip on the grated parm!  Deliziosa e riempimento!

Very tasty and easy to prepare!  I added a few more spices and used cannellini beans instead of cranberry beans (only because thats what I had on hand) but I didnt change the recipe much and it was great!

I know there are different variations to recipes, but why mess with the mail ingredients. First I had problems trying to find "cranberry beans"....no one knew what I was talking about.  After it was done, it didn't even look like the Pasta Fagioli that I am used to eating. I usually don't give a bad review.....  Sorry....
