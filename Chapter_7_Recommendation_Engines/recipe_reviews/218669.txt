This is the first recipe I've used to make my own protein bars. I used 1 package (35g) of vanilla and 1 package of chocolate protein by Vega Sport, Naturally More Peanut Butter which is great as it already contains flax seed, honey and egg white, added some chopped walnuts, dried cranberries and other fruit and nuts from trailmix. I also added a bit more honey and heated it a bit with peanut butter to make it more liquid and easier to mix with dry ingredients. The bars turned out great (chewy!), I can't wait to take them on my next hike!

Very easy recipe and these protein bars turned out very good.  
I added 1T of vanilla and 1T of cocoa powder also to bump up some flavour since my protein powder is flavourless.
Mine didn't turn out crumbly but they are crunchy.  I may add some applesauce next time and see if I get a chewier bar.
Overall, very good recipe for protein bars.

I made this recipe as written and doubled the honey as suggested by the author for a sweeter bar.  They turned out great... moist, not too crumbly, and very tasty!

Loved these bars and I make them every two weeks now. I work out a lot and hate eating food I have to unwrap, so these are perfect. I add 1/3 cup of wheat germ, 1/3 cup of ground flax seed, ram it full of chopped almonds, two eggs, vanilla and double the honey. I add apples sauce if I have it but not required, these taste great. Once cut up, I freeze the entire batch in a large freezer bag and pick one out a day, they don't last long in the house because the kids love them also. Thanks for the recipe!!

Just made these and they are very good. I added 2 tblspn Cinnamon and instead of flax seed, I grounded some almonds, soy nuts, pumpkin kernels and dried cranberries from a trail mix. Next time I will ground the oatmeal as well to try a different texture. Thanks for the recipe

My picky teenage boys even liked these.  They were a little dry so next time I will probably add some apple sauce to the mix.  I added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Good stuff, thanks!

Made these with my daughter today...The kids loved them but they were very crumbly. I will add more honey next time. (I wasn't watching when she put in the oats so she may have added too much too.)  The kids (Ages 12, 10 and 7) Loved them and asked for seconds. They thought it would be really good in milk too. You can really taste the peanut butter, honey and the bananas too. YUM!

the batter was really crumbly so I had to add about 1/2 cup more honey and some applesauce to it. I also added some cinnamon for taste. I think these bars have some potential... i'm gonna play around with the flavors a bit as I still found them on the bland side even after adding all that honey...

My family really liked these. They're not sweet, but thats obviously not the intent of this healthy snack.  If you prefer a sweet bar, I'd suggest adding some raisins or dried fruit; cheeries, or cranberries would be tasty! Mine were nice & soft w/ perfect texture.  Perhaps the other rater who indicated hers were crumbly spread them too thin? Thanx "So NumberNine!"

These are very tasty and easy to make. Also, they are really filling. They are a little dry, so I added 1/2 cup of apple sauce, and a little sugar free maple syrup. Cinnamon would be good as well.

This was just what I was looking for! I had chocolate protein powder, so I used that, plus about 1T. cocoa powder to boost the flavor. I also added about 1/2 c. craisins. Because so many reviewers commented on the dryness, I added a few (2) more previously frozen bananas, to add moisture. I convected them at 350 degrees for about 8-9 min. Next time I will use crunchy peanut butter.
Delicious!

Every two weeks I make this recipe as is but add 3x the flax seed.  It's never been crumbly while mixing or after baking, it's between chewy and crisp.  Always very filling and satisfying.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These are awesome! We make them every Sunday for snacks during the week. I substitute the wheat flour with almond flour.

I could not find the original recipe I used on here so I used this as a baseline.  My son is into muscle building so wanted a homemade protein bar.  I hate it when people make lots of changes so I rated it 5 stars and then included what I remembered from the other recipe and then my own touch.  I used 3 cups oatmeal, 3 bananas, no wheat flour, 1/4 cup wheat germ, 1/4 cup flax seed, 1/4 cup raw sunflower seeds and 1/4 cup raw pumpkins seeds. I also used natural peanut butter. I did not have problems with it being dry and I think the extra banana is why.  Thanks for the starting point.

I noticed a lot of reviewers said it was a little dry and I like my protein bars chewy so I added a small container of applesauce and baked it a little longer.  I also added some cinnamon, two packets of the Stevia sweetners, and some Oat Bran to thicken it up as the applesauce made a little runny.  They turned out GREAT! :) Next time I'll try using crunchy peanut butter for a little more texture.

This is the first time I've made my own protein bar.  The recipe was quick and easy.  The batter was a little dry, so I added a half cup of applesauce.  I actually baked them in a parchment paper-lined, 13x9 inch pan for 22 min. at 350.  They turned out great!  Easy to cut too. The next time I may try adding a very thin layer of peanut butter confectioners icing and serve as a dessert bar. :)

I've never made my own protein bars before and was excited to try this out. I added a 1/2 T of wheat bran and used maybe 1 t bit of pure maple syrup (although I think I will add more of it next time, half honey half maple maybe). I used a vanilla protein powder, as I am not a huge fan of the fact that you can hardly ever find protein bars in stores without chocolate. The batter was very sticky, so I recommend dusting your hands with flour when pressing it into a pan. But, the flavor was great, especially since I'm not a huge fan of sweets. I'm thinking of adding some chopped nuts, dried fruit, applesauce, egg whites or maybe even a strawberry protein powder (peanut butter and jelly, anyone?) next time. I also have a multigrain hot cereal that would be great in place of the oats, especially since oats are already in the mix. I'll definitely have fun experimenting with this recipe!

These were really good. My husband and I really enjoyed them.  I may take some of the other reviewers advice and add some cranberries or other dried fruit next time.  Thanks.

I made these with 1 cup of chia seeds instead of protein powder (cheaper and more delicious!) and they turned out excellent!

These bars are excellent if you add the following:

1 cup Almonds
1 cup Pumpkin Seeds
1 tsp Cinnamon
2 tsp Cayenne Pepper
Increase honey to 3/4 cup

They fill you up and taste delicious with chocolate protein powder. Cayenne Pepper is a metabolic booster and gives the bars a nice hot spice to them (if you like that).

I have 1 everyday for a mid-morning snack or if I'm travelling. They are perfect with the changes above.

I absolutely love these bars.Each time I make them I do something different. My changes are as follows,I use 1 cup of quinoa flakes to replace one of the cups of oats. I also replace the wheat flour with quinoa flour. I usually replace the flaxseed with both hemp and chia seeds. I use  a quarter cup of honey and a quarter cup of maple syrup,a teaspoon of vanilla extract,a quarter cup of organic cacao powder,a half cup of cacao nibs,a third cup of organic raisins,a quarter cup of applesauce,about 3 bananas,and a mixture of peanut butter and almond butter.I even added some cherries to my last batch and they were amazing!And a pinch of salt.

These are good but a little too dry. They also have that typical protein bar taste from time to time while eating.

This recipe was delicious! I added about 3 extra tablespoons of honey, a handful of sliced almonds, and I took out around 1/4 cup of the oat protein mixture. These are very dense and dry when you follow the exact recipe so I would suggest tweaking it to your own personal taste

I've been making this recipe for about a year now and still love it! I make preformed bars each bar is 1/3 cup. It meets my desired over 20 grams of protein requirement as a before or after workout meal replacement. Thank you!

These were really good. My husband is a runner so I was looking for healthy treats to make for him. We used vanilla protein powder and sprinkled a little cinnamon over the top for extra flavor. Turned out really well,  soft and moist. Honestly I wouldn't know that they don't have sugar. Will definitely make these again and experiment with different additions like sliced almonds, dried cherries, and dried cranberries.

So, so good! I followed the recipe almost exactly, with one tiny addition. Some reviewers mentioned that the bars were a bit crumbly, and I happened to have THREE very ripe bananas, so I threw in one extra smashed banana. It sweetened them up bit, and the texture is perfect! I also used chocolate protein powder and, did I already mention these bars are DELICIOUS

nutrish' AND delish'!
these are some seriously delicious and nutritious snack bars that are convenient to take on the go.
also a great way to use some very ripe bananas that nobody else wants to grab from the kitchen fruit basket.

Pretty good for a quick breakfast that is filling. I only used 2 bananas and next time I will try it with only 1 to reduce the banana taste. I added a little extra peanut butter and next time I think I will try to add more!

I made this. Turned out fantastic! Exactly what I was looking for. 

For me, I was looking for a high protein, Protein Bar... not a candy bar. I can see how certain non diet/fitness folks might think this is bland... but compared with many commercial Protein Bars this is honestly so much nicer.

I should note that I used "natural" Peanut Butter, the kind where they don't add sugar, and it's just peanuts. Seemed to work out well.

 Recommend!

I followed the instructions exactly and I did not like the texture or flavor at all. They turned out kind of rubbery.

I'm giving this 4 stars because I thought it was a little bit dry,  However, I did add about a tablespoon of applesauce and will add more next time.  They had good flavor and I will experiment by adding dried fruit next time.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

The bomb. If you wanted to make them thin and crispy like the picture, put them in a larger pan and bake for less time. I made them as instructed and they came out thicker and delicious. I spread a thin layer of PB on top and they are even better. (I used oat bran instead of wheat as I didn't have any.)

I was looking for an easy protein bar and this fits the bill! Very easy to make and very easy to add more goodies to suit your taste. I made it gluten free by using gluten free baking mix instead of flour. I added flaked coconut, walnuts and extra flax seed. I also added @1/4 coconut milk to make the dough less crumbly. Looking forward to different add ins and see what I can come up with.
Thanks for a great easy healthy treat!

I was looking for a quick and easy recipe and this was just that! Really easy, super fast, and really good! I actually cut mine into 30 servings for lower calorie bars. I didn't have any flaxseed on hand so I made them without, and they are still good! I think I might put a pinch of salt just to pop the flavor a little, but they are good as is! Love the use of great ingredients without the junk!

For those of us who gave up on bland store bought protein bars, these are really great, quick and easy!  I made them but doubled the honey as suggested by reviewers.  They were delicious but way too messy to spread.  Try the original recipe before tweaking and THEN add more honey if necessary.  Also whole flax is just fine--no need to pulverize it.

These are great, I did double the honey as recommended...turned out perfectly. Made a second batch a put in Karob Chips turned out just as good.  Moist and not crumbly.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's my new go to for protein bars!

Love it!  I added 1 tbsp of cinnamon, 1 tbsp of unsweetened cocoa and used chocolate protein powder instead of vanilla...scrumptious!!  I had gastric bypass surgery and needed to get more protein in when I started back to work, these are great to eat during my commute!

This is great!! I followed the recipe and doubled the honey for a sweeter bar. I also added a handful on mini semi sweet chocolate chips...I am who I am!! Does anyone know how long these keep in the fridge for? I'm thinking about freezing some of the bars.
