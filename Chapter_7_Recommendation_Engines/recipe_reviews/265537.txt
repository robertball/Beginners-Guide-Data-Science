6.15.18  I had one zucchini in the fridge, and I had to twist my husband’s arm to give this a try (not a fan of green smoothies), so I scaled to two servings.  You get a lot of the OJ flavor, just a hint of the banana, and the zucchini contributes its green  color, but no flavor.  This actually was pretty good, but I think in the future, I’ll add more banana to bring that flavor up to share more equally with the orange juice.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This turned out really well. It wasn't very sweet, even with a really ripe banana, but that was fine with me. Honey or a packet of Splenda would definitely help if I was having a sweet tooth. I really like the ice added to this. I thought the smoothie was filling, yet refreshing. Thanks!

I  like it. But I added yogurt to it and one scoop of oats to it. it tastes like oranges.
