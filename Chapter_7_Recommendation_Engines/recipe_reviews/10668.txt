These are amazing sugar cookies, especially if you are looking for a traditional, buttery sweet cookie with  no frills.  This recipe makes old-fashioned, delicious, soft cookies.  One tip in making these come out great:  rather than drop them onto your baking sheet using spoons or a scoop as you would with chocolate chip cookies, roll them into 1 1/2 inch balls, then roll through a small bowl of white sugar, then place on the baking sheet.  This makes them perfect!

I used 2 tsp orange extract instead of the lemon extract, and these were absolutely great!!!!  And so easy to cook!!!  They are soft and chewy, and have a nice orange flavor

A good old-fashioned sugar cookie with just the right amount of “chew.”  I did like the orange and lemon extracts for a change, but in the future I’ll stick to just the vanilla.  I added sprinkles to the dough just for fun and a little pizzazz.

This is a super-easy version of the sugar cookie recipe that my great-great grandmother brought over from Germany at the turn of the century.  Her recipe used lemon and orange zest - this is much easier, and just as tasty!

These are officially my favorite cookie!  Quick and amazingly perfect, soft, melt-in-your mouth cookies.  I wanted super lemony flavor so I omitted the orange and upped the lemon flavor to a tablespoon.  Add a quick smear of powdered sugar icing (use a mixer to combine 1/3 c. melted butter, 4 tbsp milk, 3 c. powdered sugar, 1 tbsp lemon extract, and yellow food coloring) and OMG, you can't stay out of them!

These cookies were rather good.  Not the best I've ever tasted but still not that bad.

These came out very well.  I used 2 teaspoons of orange extract instead of adding lemon extract.  It was subtly orange flavored.  If you're looking for an extreme, I would suggest adding a bit more extract.

These weren't mind-blowing, but they really were very simple and had a lovely, light, yummy flavor.  The dough was easy to handle, and because they're so easy to make, I gave them 4 stars.

This cookies are really good. Instead of using lemon and orange extract, I substituted them with almond extract which made them extra delicious. I also used pink and white icing since I made them for Valentine's Day.

We have to use butter flavored shortening due to food allergies, but these were delicious! Used homemade extracts and it turned out great!

This is a great, basic sugar cookie with a minimum of fuss.  I borrowed naples34102 idea of adding multicolored jimmies to the dough and Muffinmom's suggestion to roll the dough into 1-1/2 inch balls.  I decided to omit the citrus extracts, adding the vanilla only.  End result was a buttery,  lightly sweet and chewy sugar cookie with a little extra bling from the added sprinkles.  Everyone loved them.  :)

Love this simple recipe!! I halved it (just wanted a quick batch to satisfy a sweet tooth) and only used the 2 tsp of vanilla extract. Turned out beautiful. I topped some with a cinnamon sugar topping, some with powdered sugar. Will definitely be making again :-)

I make these cookies every year at Christmas.  I'm always tempted to make something else for a change, but inevitably someone tells me they're excited to have these again!  I use 2 tsp orange extract instead of half orange half lemon.  If you want to make them fancy, roll a ball of dough in your hands then coat all the way around with colored sugar.  Put the balls on the cookie sheet and bake as directed.  They look pretty and the sugar gives a nice crunch while the inside is nice and soft!

We liked this. Were not too sweet. Texture was not too soft or hard. We did not have orange extract so used twice the lemon extract. Added an m&m in the center of each. Dipped some in powdered sugar and left some without.

Taste wise, these are very good. I followed the recipe exactly(as I always do, to be fair to the rating), and mine came out very thin. I wish they were a little thicker, but they taste awesome.

My children and I loved this recipe.  My son usually does  not like sugar cookies but he enjoyed these. The cookies are very soft and almost melt in your mouth.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will definately be baking these again.
