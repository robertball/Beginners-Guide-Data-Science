I love this recipe, and I make it all the time for pack lunches. I add halved grape tomatoes and roasted garlic. Also, I'm not sure if this is part of the original recipe, but I re-heat it before serving because I like the mozzarella to be a little melted. It's so yummy! Thank you!

This dish looks great but really had very little flavor.  My family was not impressed.
