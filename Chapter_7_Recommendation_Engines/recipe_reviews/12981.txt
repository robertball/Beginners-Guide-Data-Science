This was really good. You really could not tell that it was so quick. I added a few more potatoes but you didnt have too. I just like lots. I did put bacon in mine. I also added clam juice. I would recommend this to all of you .

I agree that this recipe is so easy but so delicious!  I made it last night along with grilled cheese.  I cook a lot and usually dishes much more complicated than this; however I enjoy a little break from time to time.  This chowder tastes like much more than opening cans!  My husband thought it should be thicker but I myself liked the thinner consistancy.  Our son wouldn't even try it but our daughter loved it and asked for seconds!  I used equal amounts of whole milk and half and half and that worked well.  I would definitely make this again!

This clam chowder is sooo easy and so delicious! It's our new family favorite! I add partially boiled and cubed potatoes to this recipe for a heartier chowder.

This was so easy and tasted like I'd worked for hours!  I added potatoes (small cubes par boiled)but other then that everything was by the book.  I doubled this recipe and froze half for another meal, made a huge pot of soup.  My family went back for 2nds, 3rds and 4ths!

I have used a very similarrecipe in the past and instead of high calorie 1/2 and 1/2 I use lo-fat condensed milk and add more potatoes.  Family loves it including the 5 year old granddaughter.I serve with my own croutons and bacon pieces.  Thanks for reminding me about it.  I always need something fast for the busy lifestyle

My husband adores this chowder and it is so-o-o-o-o easy to make.  We let it cook a little longer since thickness is the key in my household and I also add another can of clams, after all, it is clam chowder.  This is one recipe I highly recommend!

This soup is wonderful and so easy to make. The flavors are just right. I used a small size frozen shrimp that I thawed out and took out the excess water from the shrimp. I also put in some extra shrimp.  It is now my favorite soup.

I was in a really big hurry.  I had my son open all the cans, omitted the margarine and celery, used dehydrated onions and fat-free half and half.  It was still delicious.  I could have passed it off as "I've been cooking over the hot stove all day..."

I typically like to make my soups from scratch; however, I do have a few soups like this that actually use condensed soups and and other soups as part of the base that I love because they are usually so much faster to make.  This did not disappoint!  It was super quick.  My husband and I loved it, but I added Old Bay Seasoning as suggested by other reviewers.  I think that made a huge difference...it was a fantastic compliment!  I also added an extra jar of clams and the juice of one of the cans of clams.  I would highly recommend this soup.  Next time will make some other adjustments like adding some diced potates and diced bacon, just to make it a bit thicker since we like our soup quite thick and chunky!  Overall it was very delicious and not all that expensive to make!

This was excellent.  As good as my favorite (Progresso).  I added an extra can lo clams( next time 3 cans) I used fat free half and half and butter instead of margarin.  I added a parboiled cubed potato. I drained the clams and only added about 1/8 cup of the broth.  I also added 2 tablespoons of cornstartch to the last half cup of half & half to thicken it.

Absolutely delicious!  I had friends over, it was a huge hit.. Only change I made was a tad bit more butter I added at the end. I also added 2 cloves fresh chopped garlic with the celery and onion at the beginning.

Fantastic!  I also added the bacon per others recommendations.  For me the Red Wine Vinegar made this soup!  I could believe the difference in taste from before I added it to after.

I absolutely love this recipe! I like to chop up the onions into large pieces, along with the celery. I'll throw the celery and the onion into a microwavable tupperware with a little bit of water and the lid slightly open and steam them so that they soften quickly. I also chop some red potatoes into large pieces as well, and parboil them before adding them to the chowder. My husband goes crazy for it, and I always make more than needed so that I can pack leftovers to take for lunch.

I'm really picky about clam chowder, but this was delicious! My other go-to recipe for homemade clam chowder takes all day, so this is a great backup! I use 98% fat free soups and 3 cups of fat free milk to make it a little healthier.

very easy to make and add extra fillers.  Instead of condensed clam chowder i subbed progresso's healthier version and added low fat half and half accordingly until desired consistency

This is awesome for quick clam chowder. I did find it a little runny, so I just looked up how to make a roux and I've never gotten so many compliments! I also add crispy/chopped bacon and extra potatoes that I boiled previously. I suggest using the big can of clams plus the juice that you can buy from Costco. I like a ton of clams and it can get pricey at the grocery store. To spice it up I also added a little old bay seasoning. Never had anyone not like it!!

Me and my husband LOVE this soup.It is one of the best I've had.I made a few changes.One was I added bacon and I also added some leftover mashed potatoes and one can of the potato soup, seeing that I doubled the recipe.I also thickened it alittle bit with some cornstarch and water mixed because it was alittle to thin for us.I also put an extra can of the clams in.Thank you so much for this recipe.It is for sure a keeper.

Yummmy! I wanted a quick clam chowder recipe for a cold winter night and this was it!!  Next time I want to put it in a toasted bread bowl.  Super easy, you can't mess this up.  The calorie content is a little scarey, but for a once in a while treat, I think this is great!

This was the best! It was sooo easy to prepare. I used two cans of clams and think next time I'll add boiled pared potatoes also for a little thicker consistency. This was definitely a hit. I think it will become our Christmas Eve tradition. Thanks        for sharing this great recipe!!!

I found this a very nice and easy way to spruce up canned clam chowder. I omitted the cream of celery soup, and it was fine.

Absolutely wonderful recipe! I took another reviewer's advice and added a diced potato, which forced me to cook it longer, but I think that just made it thicker and more delicious! Definitely putting this into the rotation.

I liked this recipe, but I went ahead and fried potatoes in a strip of bacon and a clove of garlic before adding them with twice the clam and leaving only half the clam juice in. I only added half and half until it reached a pleasant consistancy for my taste. Overall a good base recip and very, very easy.

This is the GREATEST clam chowder ever! It is so easy, and no one will ever guess how little work you put into it. Make sure the celery is well cooked and soft, so it isn't crunch in the chowder. Oddly enough, I love clam chowder but hate clams, so I omitted the can of minced clams (though they were still in the canned chowder) and added a double amount of smoked salmon, which was just perfect. I also added a tbs of finely chopped rosemary. It was fabulous, and so filling that the large pot lasted for several meals.

It was a very good soup but I only gave it three stars because I'm not sure how to cut down on the salt.  Otherwise it was yummy.

I was looking for a good easy clam chowder for Christmas eve and this is it.  I did add an extra potato, but otherwise I followed the directions exactly.  My family loved it.
