Excellent!  After cutting the monkfish into chunks I pounded it to make it a uniform size and to make it tender; monkfish can be a bit chewy, like lobster.  Donâ€™t be tempted to substitute light coconut milk for regular.  The fat in the coconut is a healthy fat and the flavor and creaminess of regular coconut milk cannot be beat.  I squeezed a little more lime over each individual serving and it was delicious served over cauliflower rice with fresh asparagus on the side.  I will definitely make this quick, easy, and healthy fish dish again.

This dish was fantastic i am not a huge fishlover and had not had monkfish before but this was lovely.  I found the monkfish to be meaty and mild in flavour the sauce was wonderfully fragrant with the coconut, lime and heat hitting every taste bud.  I made the dish exactly to the recipe, there was a lot of sauce but this was delicious over rice.

Fantastic!!! Totally authentic, restaurant quality Thai Red Curry Sauce. This was so simple, but so delicious. I made it with sea bass instead of monkfish, because I had some fresh. The following week I tried it with shrimp. Amazing! I'm sure it would be great with chicken as well. This one is definitely a keeper.

So simple, and such an impressive, delicious result.  Definitely try this recipe!  I was surprised at how much the last 3 ingredients really enhanced the flavors of the dish.  My first attempt at Thai cooking was a success!  Thanks!

I've never seen monkfish at the store so I made this with cod plus a few shrimp. As written, it was so bland. I ended up adding more red paste, more fish sauce and a splash of soy sauce. Also threw in a can of straw mushrooms. Turned out ok but definitely needed some tweaking. Thanks.

This was really really good and simple to make.  We used fresh halibut and substituted Thai green curry paste and green peppers because that was what we had on hand. We served it over long-grain brown rice and it really was a delicious meal!

I added 3 cloves of garlic with the onion, used lite coconut milk, and increased the heat to 1/4 c. curry paste.  I served over Jasmine rice, with a dollop of Greek plain yogurt, and a wedge of fresh lime.  Not bad.

So I thought this was great but my guests were blown away by it.  They kept asking me if I really made this.... Not sure how I feel about that but it gives this recipe 5 stars.

It was lacking extra zing. I think it could have used some freshly squeezed lemon juice to add some tang.

Great recipe. Easy to follow.  I have used it with the monkfish but also substituted for other fish (vietnamese rive cobbler).  Always gets the thumbs up from friends and family when I make it!

It's surprising that there are so few reviews  for this.  Maybe "monkfish" in the recipe title scares folks off.  Made this twice so far.  Used monkfish the first time and it was really quite good.  Used a pound of shrimp the second time and added a bunch of green beans and it was awesome!  Served with basmati or jasmine rice.
My point being, this is an excellent and simple base curry recipe  that can be tweaked and added to depending on your tastes.  The fish sauce, lime juice and cilantro at the end is key and shouldn't be omitted.  This will be a staple in our house, changing it up with different meats or seafood and veggies.   It does not get boring.

This was a fantastic curry- the flavours were intense but not overpowering. The fish stayed chunky in the sauce and it had just the right amount of spice. I served this with green beans over white rice.

Decent flavor, but I bumped it up a notch with homemade fish sauce (which I added another 2 Tbsp at the end after tasting) and then some fragrant fresh basil at the end. If you like heat, add some thai chillies. Serve with rice. Monkfish is a controversial fish due to overfishing, so you could also use sustainably sourced shrimp, halibut or scallops.

Extremely easy to make and tasty dish.  Be careful with the amount of curry paste you use, begin with a smaller amount and add more to taste. :)
We upped the amount of monkfish a bit to serve 4 but kept the rest of the ingredients the same.  There was still lots of sauce to go around.
Served with steamed white rice and steamed baby green asparagus tips.

I made this tonight. It was easy to prepare.
I used Coconut Milk Lite (by KAME) and Thai Kitchen Red curry paste. It was delicious. I will make this again and again.
Can anyone suggest another fish to use in this recipe? The monkfish is hard to find.

had to do a bit of improvising with this, but do not think it strayed off the recipes' path too much.  i didn't have peanut oil, so i used veggie oil and 1 tsp chunky peanut butter. cut back on the red curry past to 1 1/2 tsp.  for personal preference.  i don't think we could have eaten it with 3 TBS.  used lite coconut milk to save on calories, but i'm afraid that might be where the umph might lay.  the dish, while spicy, was bland.  if i make this again, i'll use regular coconut milk.  served over rice. thanks for the post meg76.

I loved this dish! I used Tilapia instead of monkfish and it turned out great. So quick and easy! Thank you for sharing.

This recipe was easy to follow. (The soup base is so yummy  you could make this a veggie coconut soup.)  I added mushrooms and garlic, but nothing else. Family loved it with a white fish I had on hand. Skip the Thai restaurant, and make this at home as an appetizer or main dish.

This was pretty delicious as written, but next time I might add some lime zest as well, to add a bit of that citrus note that is present in real Thai cuisine because of the lemongrass.  Otherwise very good.

This recipe is fabulous.  I confess to tweaking EVERY recipe I try, but this one I barely altered.  Added sliced cremini mushrooms, 2T white wine when adding green curry paste... and that's it.  Delicious -- would give 6 stars if possible.  THanks for submitting.

Delicious, with a delicate and balanced flavor.  Instead of using monkfish, I added frozen edamame beans and some vegetarian "chicken," and it was still wonderful and filling.  My only regret is that I had to use dried cilantro in place of fresh, which I added with the curry paste.  Using fresh cilantro as indicated would've made this a perfect five out of five.

Used fresh-caught sheepshead and it turned out great (even using lite coconut milk). I also added chili paste (2-3 tablespoons' worth) to the final product because I felt that it lacked enough heat. Served over cauliflower rice and spinach, which tasted absolutely fantastic. A great way to incorporate more veggies into the recipe.

My favourite! Substituted hoisin sauce for fish sauce, and tilapia for monkfish.  Used garlic, onions and peppers and mushrooms, and my family (even my 20month old granddaughter) loved it! I'm making it tonight with shrimp and putting it over basmati rice. Can't wait!

Very easy recipe to follow! The only ingredient I didn't use is peanut oil and lime juice. Instead I used corn oil, artificial lime juice and frozen pacakged fish. It still came out great!!
