Should be in the Top 10, in my opinion ! As promised, delicious, rich and moist.  Willingly accepts another 1/2 cup zucchini when the garden is bountiful !
I use a Bundt pan, and substitute an icing sugar/milk mixture to drizzle over the top when almost cool.
A chocolate lover's fantasy come true. Starting to salivate just thinking about it !

Excellent recipe.  I don't measure the zucchini though.... i just choose 2 large zucchini's and grate them and voila... the moistest cake ever.  If you want a really smooth taste to the cake you can subsitute a cup of the white sugar with icing sugar (can be done with most recipes) and it really gives it that "melt in your mouth" taste.  I love this recipe and it goes really well with cream cheese icing OR with a dollop of whipping cream / cool-whip on top.  I'm using this recipe to make cup-cakes for my child's 1st birthday next week.  At least she will get a bit of veggies in the sweet too!  Happy Baking!

This cake tasted fine but I have had moister zucchini cakes.  I also almost forgot to add the cocoa because it was in the list of ingredients but not in the instructions.

This was just what I was looking for-- a moist cake that wasn't fudgy. I increased the vegetable oil to 1/2 c. and baked this in a Bundt pan. I let it cool and gave it a dusting with powdered sugar and now it's just right for ice cream or whipped cream. Great summer cake!

Good flavor, but dry. I doubled the zucchini and chocolate and added walnuts.

While this is good, it's not the best I've ever had.  It didn't seem as moist as I was hoping for, it has more of a very thick brownie consistency to it.  The amount of chocolate is good and with zucchini in it I can tell myself it's good for me, too!  I topped it with Perfect Cream Cheese Icing by Crystal R. and that put it at a 5-star rating!  Definitely worth making and I will make it again, maybe just adding a tad more oil to the mixture, or maybe a little more milk.

I added a pinch of cardamon and substituted the vegetable oil for coconut oil as I was out of the former. I like that this recipe takes 2 or more cups of zucchini. This is such a tender and moist cake.  Love the photo submitted.  The next time I'll add some semi-sweet chocolate chips for added chocolate flavor. This recipe rocks, big time!!!!!

This cake was flavorful, but very dry. I don't think it really needs that much flour.

Overall the taste is good, but I'm VERY glad I decided to check the cake after 50 minutes. I wish I'd checked it at 40. After 50 minutes it was completely done and even a little dry. If I make this again, I will definitely decrease the baking time.

This is the lightest, yet moist and richest tasting chocolate cake--the perfect way to hide zucchini.  Everyone at work raved about this one, which I pairedd with "Mom's Buttercream" frosting (also available on Allrecipes.  I only changed it by adding slightly more zucchini (2-1/2 to 3 cups), in order to use up what zucchini I had.  It may have contributed to the moistness and did not detract in any way from the flavor.  Also, with the buttercream frosting (incredibly light and delicious), I added cocoa powder (3 Tbsp) to give it a hint of chocolatey flavor.
This is HEAVENLY, and a nice way to get in your vegetables!

Moist and delicious, I didn't exactly measure the zucchini, I put in more than two cups.  I also added chocolate chips and dusted the top with icing sugar.

To cut the fat but retain moisture, I cut the butter down to half a stick, added half cup of applesauce and an extra half cup of zuke.  I also added a cup of nestle semi sweet choc chips-half in the batter and half sprinkled on top before baking. I intend to try it with peanut butter chips. Family loved it.  I cooked it in two loaf pans and was careful to not overcook. I poured a glaze of vanilla, powdered sugar, and little milk on one of them. This doesn't need icing, little powdered sugar for decoration when serving is all.

Great recipe.  I added 1/4 c of chopped walnuts and 2/3c of semi sweet chips.  Instead of vegetable oil I used chia seeds. Made into cupcakes and cooked for 20minutes.  I live at 6200 feet so I reduced baking powder and soda by 10%. I will definitely make this again :)  For anyone counting carbs this recipe in roughly 20 carbs a cupcake.  Makes 2 dozen.

This cake came out so well!  The only change that I made was to add 2 Tbs. of Espresso powder.  The coffee flavor enhances the richness of the chocolate. I frosted it with a dark chocolate espresso ganache- Decadent!

This recipe has just the right amount of chocolate. One would never know there was zucchini in it. Mine turned out a bit drier than I would like, but I had to bake it a bit longer to get it done in the center since I used a bundt pan. I may have just baked it 5 minutes too long.  Overall, great cake.

These were so good! I did make some changes to make them healthier - subbed the butter for equal amount of fat free plain greek yogurt and used white whole wheat flour. I used half the batter to make cupcakes which I baked for 20 mins, and the rest in a 8x8 pan for cake and baked about 35 minutes. came out very rich and chocolatey, and I topped with an avocado chocolate frosting also from this site. With my healthy substitutions, these are definitely healthy enough for breakfast muffins ;-) thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe when I lost my cook book. It was PERFECT!  I added 1/4 tsp. Ground cloves, 1/4 tsp. Allspice' and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I like to have a little more spice to my cake.  I used a whipped cream cheese frosting to top off my healthish dessert. ( 1-8oz pkg. of Greek cream cheese whipped, 1tsp vanilla, and 2cups of real whipped cream or whipped topping folded into the whipped cream cheese) Delicious!!

I have yet to taste this cake because I just took it out of the oven. I followed the recipe exactly. I have a gas oven that tends to cook things slightly faster than allotted recipe times so I set my timer for 50 minutes. I am disappointed to say that when I opened the oven door when the timer went off I saw the entire cake had sunk in. It looks like I took it out of the oven too early & it sank in. It is completely done as I tested it with a toothpick. I hope it will taste better than it looks.

I made this recipe last night and brought it into work this morning along with a pan of the Chocolate zucchini cake III recipe as I was trying to figure out which recipe would be better (it was my first time making both and I figured by the third and fourth version, they had to have gotten them just about right). I topped both with a homemade cream cheese icing. This one had relatively good reviews from co-workers but was the least favourite of the two with a few comments that it was too dry. I had even added an extra half cup of zucchini and an extra 1/4 cup of oil and it didn't seem to help. It was good but I think I'll stick with Chocolate Zucchini Cake III!

My family,and in-laws loved it, i thought it could have been a bit moister.But i think i know what i did wrong there,i didnt compensate for the elevation,plus i like adding a bit more fluid,when im using cocoa powder.The taste was there.

The flavor was good.  I thought it was too dry.
