I followed the recipe exactly and these just did not turn out. They were way too dense and dry/crumbly tasting while also oily. The PB flavor was not as pronounced as I was hoping, either. I make muffins every week for my kids to pack as school snacks. These were the first ones that I had to just throw out because nobody would eat them.
