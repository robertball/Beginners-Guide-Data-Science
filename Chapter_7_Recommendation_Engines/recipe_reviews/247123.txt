We didn't have garlic scapes available, so we used 2 garlic cloves instead. next time we will try using green onion stalks instead of the scapes.

We added the zest of 1 medium sized lemon. Also the juice of half of the lemon from above.

Instant family favorite!

I went the nut free route and this turned out great! Garlic scapes were not available so I used 2 cloves of garlic the submitter mentioned in the notes. This was super fresh tasting and worked great on my sandwich. Be sure your cup of basil is a packed cup. Thanks for sharing!
