To get really crisp cookies, just cut the amount of brown sugar in half, and increase the white sugar by 2 tbsp. Then bake for 15 mins~ voila! Crisp cookies that you CAN'T get from using equal amounts of brown and white sugar.

I've always used the recipe on the oatmeal box but this is superior to it. The only adjustments I make are to grind 1/2 of the oatmeal in my food processor, added 1/2 cup each of raisins & pecans, and I did not use the choc. chips or coconut. I also treated them as a "drop" cookie since my dough was a little moist. I use this recipe as a base for peanut butter cookies (add 1/2 cup peanut butter & leave out nuts & raisins and grind all the oatmeal) and chocolate chip cookies because they are the perfect combination of crispy outside & chewy inside.

This is the best cookie recipe that I've tried in years.  I didn't have quite enough shortening so I put about a tablespoon of butter in with it, no problem.  I lost control of the vanilla bottle when measuring and put probably twice as much in as I was supposed to, no problem.  Didn't have quite enough white sugar so I topped it off with brown sugar, no problem.  And best of all, I always forget the last batch that I put in the oven and end up ruining them, but these, even though they were pretty brown, they were still great!  Unbelievable!  I put chocolate chips in them, yummy.  I can't wait to try some of the other suggested variations.  You won't be disappointed with this recipe.

These cookies are DANGEROUS. As close to a perfect recipe as any I've found, wonderfully crisp along the edges, with a satisfying chewy middle thanks to the coconut. The second time I made them I increased the oatmeal to a full cup. To avoid saturated fat and trans fat I substituted Canola Harvest 0 Trans Fat margarine for shortening [Crisco 0 Tans Fat PER SERVING Shortening actually has a lot of trans fats...they get around it by increasing the claimed serving size, sqeaking by the FDA rule], and for an increased burst of flavor when the cookie first touches your tongue, I greased the cookie sheet with butter. This adds just a minimal amount of saturated fat/cholesterol, but a lot of flavor.
I have also made this recipe adding walnuts and cranberries...delicious, but still full of healthful stuff to "offset" the cookie's decadence.

This is an elegant cookie.  It is European in style.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used butter rather than shortening (more cholesterol, but no trans-fats).  I used the cocoanut but not the chocolate chips.  They are very crisp and buttery....very nice with a cup of espresso!

These cookies are fabulous!
I have made them several times now and they are always perfect.. soft and yummy on the inside, crunchy and well formed on the outside. I've made them with toasted almonds, raisins, dried apples, chocolate chips.. you name it and I have tossed it in, and this recipe never has let me down. Go for it.. You'll be a superstar!

These are absolutely wonderful!!! I also recomend using 1/4c shortening 1/4c butter instead of all shortening, for it improves the flavor. These are great with both white and dark chocolate since the texture of the chocolate compliments the texture of the cookie. I have found a duel use for this recipe. By complete accident I once forgot to add the 1/2c of white sugar. This actually turned out almost as good as the crisp cookies in a completely different way! There were nice and chewy. I easily give both cookies 5 stars.

Easy recipe and very tasty. I made two batches - one rolled into balls and one with the drop method. The ball cookies turned out perfectly. The dropped cookies spread so thin that they burned and were inedible. I will be turning to this recipe again the next time I want a light and crisp cookie.

Very good cookies, but still not my favourite!  I really liked the crispness, as compared to most oatmeal cookies which are very chewy.  I added white chocolate chunks and semi-sweet chocolate chips to mine, as well as some cinnamon, and they were quite good.  I only got 2 dozen though, so next time I'll double the recipe.  I thought they could use a few more oats (they weren't distinctly "oatmeal", if I didn't know I may not even have noticed the oats!).  I enjoyed them though and I know they must have been good because there were 1.5 dozen left when I went to bed at night and only 2 cookies left when I woke up early the next morning!

These were the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made. I did not add raisins, coconut or chips and they were still perfect. My only suggestion would be if you do not use coconut, add another 1/2 cup oatmeal. I did that the second time I made them and they were even better. I also added 1 Tbsp. Cinnamon as I do with all my cookies.

The texture of these were awsome, crispy on the ourside and chewy on the inside. They were, however a little lacking in flavour and a little too sweet for my taste. Chopped dates are also great in this!

5 stars for the way I made them. I used butter. I also removed the brown sugar because brown sugar makes things chewy so if you want crispy cookies, use all white sugar. I used just the 1/2 cup of white and I liked the sweetness of the cookies. I left out the coconut and chips because I wanted simple plain oatmeal cookies. I baked mine for 11 minutes and that wasn't enough to make them crispy all the way through. They aren't chewy at all, just slightly soft. Will bake longer next time. Delicious!

This is the best crispy oatmeal cookie recipe I have found  - all others turn out too chewy. Crisp on the outside & slightly chewy on the inside. I used 1/2 butter & 1/2 shortening  and left out the coconut as suggested by others. I also cooked them for 18 mins. at 355 deg. F.

Excellent cookie, though I would be hesitant to call them 'oatmeal' cookie  since the oatmeal is pretty sparse.  I don't know what I would call them other than delicious.  I used all butter since I never seem to have shortening and they were not bland at all.  I made once without chocolate and coconut and once with both. I can't believe I'm saying this as a serious chocolate lover,  but they were better plain.  I also baked them an extra three minutes to give them that great 'browned butter' flavor and make them extra crispy.  They're also good with a 1/2 t. of cinnamon.

I have very little experience making cookies.  Tried these as I like warm yet crisp oatmeal cookies.  AWESOME!  Didn't have coconut and only used choc chips but I'll try the coconut sometime too. AWESOME.  Don't eat too many!

I don't know what I did wrong. I followed the recipe exactly but they came out nothing like the picture. They were just a ball of hard oats. Mine didn't spread at all. They were crumbly, dry and bland.

This are pretty good!  I used butter instead of shortening and used all brown sugar (I like my cookies softer rather than crisper.) I used chopped dark chocolate instead of mini chocolate chips.  They are a bit on the sweet side. The next time I made them I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and added dried cranberries, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds and both ground and whole flax seed along with the chocolate and coconut to make trail mix cookies.

This recipe was perfect! We love cripy cookies and these were. I added peanut butter chips and walnuts but chocolate chips I am sure would be delicious as well. I left out the coconut and baked a little longer. Will use this again.

Sometimes you just don't want a chewy gooey oatmeal cookie, and this is a great one for those times.  It's still not my long-lost, back-of-the-Albertson's-oatmeal-box recipe, but still yummy.  I followed to the letter except I was out of coconut, and did bake the first pan before adding the chocolate chips (just to try the basic cookie).  They're not overly sweet or robust, and have almost a delicate texture but are not dry or crumbly at all.  A little hard to mix in the chips, though -- you end up kneading the portions around in your hands as you form the balls.  I think other reviewers' suggestions about dried fruit mix-ins sound great for it too, and I might toss in some cinnamon.

I LOVE this cookie... and so did my family. I used butter in place of shortening, and we enjoyed them without coconut or chocolate. We couldn't stay out of them! Perfect combination of crisp and chewy.

I've been experimenting with using coconut oil as a substitute for butter or other oils in baking and cooking, and decided to give it a try with this yummy-sounding recipe, especially since it contains coconut also.  YUM!!!!  THE most fantastic chocoloate chip cookie ever!  Perfectly chewy, not "doughy" at all.  This recipe has moved to the top of my extensive list of cookie recipes!  Thank you!

I just made this recipe. I used unsalted butter instead of shortening, and raisins instead of coconut or almonds.  The texture of the final product was crisp, and had good initial taste of caramelized sugar; however, the final taste was too salty. Also, there were not enough oats in the cookies for my taste.   I would recommend reducing the salt to 1/4 tsp, and increasing the oats to 1 1/4 cups or 1 1/2 cups.  Also, I increased the baking time on the second sheet I baked to 14 minutes, as the dough was not finished baking at 12 minutes on the first batch.

They have a lot of potential. As is, they were too thin, without much body. I added about 1 1/2 cups more oatmeal, and that seemed to do the trick. I love the addition of coconut, and will continue to use this in my oatmeal cookies. I also added chocolate chips and experimented with rice crispies cereal. I'll def use this as a base; I think the addition of baking powder is great for the texture. Thanks so much!

These are the bomb!!  I wrote down the recipe on a note pad, ended up skipping the baking powder...but, those cookies are the bomb.  My father would have loved them (He was a cookie expert).  Definately going to use this recipe around the Holidays.

I swapped out coconut and chocolate chips for 1 cup of raisins. Also added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice (cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice) for more flavor since I didn't have vanilla extract. Yum!

I bake a lot, and this is by far, the best oatmeal cookie recipe ever! I made it with choc  chips and raisins, and used a small scoop to form the cookies. They came out perfectly browned and crisp in the prescribed time. The size is just right for a few bites of sweetness with tea, coffe, or milk. Also, itntakes no time at all to assemble and bake these little wonders.

Great cookie recipe.  I used butter flavor crisco as I do in all cookies and they turned out AMAZING.  With the butter flavor crisco, you don't need as much salt - reduce to 1/4 tsp or eliminate all together.  I did 1/4 batch with regular sized white choc chips and rolled about 5 chips in each cookie and the 2nd batch with regular sized milk chocolate chips.  The recipe does not yield 4 dozen cookies.  I made medium sized cookies and it made 30 cookies.  I will definitely make these again!

I put the oats and coconut in the processor and added small chocolae chips - and these cookies are by far my favorite ! I love that crispyness. I was craving dad's brand cookies and these are the closest match I've found!

OMG!!!  This is the best cookie I've ever tasted!  I used butter, added raisins, lined pan w/parchment (instead of greasing) and baked 15-16 minutes.  I let them sit on the pan a few minutes before moving to cooling rack. Fabulous texture--perfection.

Oatmeal Cookies are the James Bond of cookies.

They play themselves off as chocolate chip on the plate, and when you bite into them you realize the espionage that has occurred.

Regardless, these are some of the best James Bond cookies I've tried.

These are divine!!  I didn't add the coconut or the chocolate chips since I didn't have any one hand.  I used butter instead of shortening, egg beaters instead of egg, and Splenda instead of white sugar to reduce calories, fat, and sugar.  I also added a little bit of cinnamon.  They came out amazing!  Everyone loves them.

I loved these cookies.  I added "craisins" and chocolate chips.  They were fantastic!  I did not bake them until they were golden brown, I took them out after exactly 12 mins. They were a little gooey in the middle, but by the time they cooled they were perfect. Yummy!!!

I followed this recipe to a T.  Great cookies.  Added the optional coconut but not the choc chips.  These cookies don`t it, the taste stands on its own.
Coincidentally, I took these cookies to a meeting and another member brought the same cookies!

Love the cookie & its crispiness.  Did what another reviewer suggested to get it: halve the brown sugar required & add additional 2 tbs of white sugar.  Very yummy.

Wonderful recipe.  My daughter has a band performance in 2 hrs. and asked if I was "in the mood for making cookies" to take for all the kids.   We found this recipe and it is wonderful.  I used butter and upped temp to 375.  Perfection

These crispy but chewy cookies are absolutely wonderful.  Used a mini ice cream scoop to put on cookie sheet and they baked nicely. A must try.

I also used butter instead of shortning.  I recommend doubling the recipe as it does not make enough.  Another tip is to use the Reynold nonstick aluminum foil, line your pans instead of greasing them - much easier to remove the cookies and less clean up.  Next time I'm going to use butterscotch chips like my grandmother used to do with her oatmeal recipe.  Simple, easy and fabulous.

I figured this many people couldn't be wrong.  Oh WOW these were great!  I just got the last batch out of the oven. Like other suggested I used butter instead of shortening. In case I'm not the only stupid cook out there....quick oats (1 minute) can be measured equally for regular oats.  I never buy the original..just thought I would throw that in here.  GREAT cookie, this is going in the Christmas recipe book!!!

my first batch I botched by using butter that was too soft.  It was still amazing, but it was basically a really big flat cookie crisp thing!  The second batch I used cold butter in, this recipe is GREAT!!

I have tried and tested many choc chip cookie recipes and this is the best! Cookies turned out scrummy and trust me, it did not last long.  My kids and husband wiped them out in one sitting!  
I made a cookie-mix with the dried ingredients and packed it into a pretty jar.  Gave them away as Christmas prezzies and it was a hit!

I used butter and left out the coconut.  Added some chopped hazelnut and some of my friends thought I bot them from a gourmet pastry shop!  A winner and keeper.

This is my standard cookie base for many different kinds of cookies BUT, I used real butter instead of shortening and I think that makes all the difference in the world.  I am FAMOUS for these cookies.  Ok, not famous, but my family and friends always ask for them. I have literally made this recipe HUNDREDS of times. I make this recipe at least twice a week, and have been doing so for the past 10 years or so. I know it by heart. I don't like to buy premade junk food, so I make these whenever we want a treat. I can go from "Mom, can you make cookies?" to eating them in 30 minutes or less. Sometimes I use whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, or a mixture of the two. Sometimes I use all white sugar, sometimes all brown, sometimes I use succanat or turbinado sugar or a combo of any/all of the above. Sometimes I use part coconut oil in place of some of the butter. As long as I keep the ratios of fat to sugar to flour, they are always amazing. I have made this recipe dozens of times and it is always awesome!  (Although they are always slightly different depending on what sugar and flour I use).   Not too oatmeal-y.   My kids don't like oatmeal cookies, but they don't notice it in these.  Sometimes I use chocolate or peanut butter chips in these, with or without nuts.  Sometimes I use coconut. Sometimes I leave out the chips all together and add some cinnamon.  The cookie dough is so good, my family won't keep their hands out of the bowl!

The best oatmeal cookies I've made on this site.  I used all brown sugar and added 1/2 cup extra oats (total 1 1/4 cups oats).  The cookies were perfectly chewy and crunchy.

These are great oatmeal cookies.  I made them for a neighborhood bake sale, and they flew off the table.  I used all butter instead of shortening, because of the trans fats, and added the coconut.  Everyone is requesting these, so I think I'll try them soon with both coconut and chocolate chips.  Yum.

I am both happy and relieved that these were so good!  I doubled the recipe with the converter feature.  In the meantime I took some butter out for another recipe.  Not thinking I creamed the shortening and the butter together.  I then noticed that this was the recipe that did not call for ANY butter!  But with the 1 cup shortening (doubled) and 1 cup of butter that can no longer be separated I doubled the recipe AGAIN! It needed about 1/2 cup more oats too. So now I have a great mountain of cookies for tonight's party and for tomorrow and the next day, etc.  But they sure are good.  The other recipe I planned to make was tossed because these were so good and I now had so many.  Next time I will double it correctly and 1/2 will be shortening and 1/2 butter...I like the combo from this time. Also, I did not use chocolate chips or coconut...still good!

Great basic recipe, my 17 y/o daughter and her friends liked these cookies alot.  For a low fat alternative use 1/4 cup applesauce & 1/4 cup butter.  Add chocolate chips if desired.

Awesome recipe! I made some changes - doubled the recipe, used butter rather than shortening, doubled the amount of oats, and added the following....cinnamon, choc chips, craisins, mini-m&ms, and pecan pieces; basically everything but the kitchen sink!!!  I did omit the coconut, only because I had none. The cookies were a huge success and now my favorite and most sought-after recipe!  Perfectly crispy on the outside and just-right gooey inside.

Holy cow these are realllly good. I added 1/2 cup raisins instead of the optional ingredients and they were wonderful. I also made a batch with no optional ingredients but added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and a little bit of nutmeg and they were like oatmeal snickerdoodles. Reallly good. They do get a little hard the next day, but if you store them with bread it keeps them soft.

They were great! I had to cook them a little longer than 12 minutes to get them nice and crisp. I did get about 4 1/2 dozen. I made the balls about the size of small walnuts. I used cranberries instead of what is suggested and also added a little cinnamon. Super!

Increased the oats to 1 1/2 C. Also toasted the oats prior to adding to the mix. Used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter and for a different little crunch, added toffee bits.  Yummm!

A great recipe.  I used butter instead of shortening.  I added cinnamon.  I didn't have any baking soda so I left it out: they still turned out great.

I gave it four because I subbed shortening with butter. Didn't work for me. Greasy and too sweat. Probably better w/ shortening. I just hate to use shortening because of trans fat. Maybe less butter, 1/5 stick and no white sugar?

I loved these!  I used 1/4 cup shortening (the stick kind) and 1/4 cup.  My brown sugar was a hard & left some clumps, but it didn't affect the cookies at all.  The dough is easy to work with too and the oats, coconut and mini chips integrated nicely.  Thank you S. Hynek!

So much better than the recipe on the oatmeal box! My kids and husband are eating them faster than I can pull them out of the oven. While warm, they're crispy *and* chewy. Heavenly.

I made these gluten free and vegan.  I used coconut oil and maple sugar, egg replacer, 1/2 sorghum flour, 1/2 sticky rice flour and bob's red mill gluten free oats.  I put dried cherries and shredded coconut in them too.  They are a bit crumbly, I should have put some xantham gum as a binder.  The taste is delicious though!!!

I borrowed baking powder from my upstairs neighbors and repaid them with these cookies.  Their words, "You're amazing."  Which means, the cookies are amazing.  Cripsy on the outside, chewy on the inside.

I didn't include coconut, because one of my housemates is allergic.  I substituted butter for the shortening, and used semi-sweet mini morsels.  I added some chopped walnuts, and increased the vanilla extract to 1 tsp, like I always do.

Yummy yummy cookies!  I'll make them again whenever I need to butter someone up.

I used 1 C. butter instead of Crisco; I included the shredded coconut, chocolate chips, rains & chopped walnuts; I cooked these at 350 degrees.  They FELL after the last minute in the oven and they look like flat pancakes!!  BUT, they taste great.  PLEASE TELL ME WHY THEY FELL IN THE OVEN!!!  I have cooked for probably 50-some-odd years (am 78) and have not had a problem with baking!!!  I even lowered the oven temp to 325 & put the rolled cookie balls in the frig to cool them prior to baking!!  Nancy T.

this is the BEST cookie recipe I've tried.  My kids, husband, and friends absolutely love it.  I changed only 2 things....I use 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening instead of all shortening.  I have found that some coconut is sweeter than others, so I dont put as much as it is called for.

I've had this both with and without the chocolate chips.  I prefer without but had other family members like it with them.  I do a double batch and that way we are both happy.  This cookies are great but taste even better fresh out of the oven.

The cookies were good, but a little sweet for my taste. I'd cut the white sugar down to 1/3 of a cup next time. Also, when the author says small balls, they mean it: no bigger than what you'd get out of a melon baller, because the cookies spread a good bit. Tasty, though!

Okay....I had originally given this recipe a four star rating, since I altered it dramatically, but I just made them again following the recipe for the most part, and they came out fantastic!!! In my opinion, these are the best oatmeal cookies ever. The only changes that I made was that I added 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice, upped the vanilla to 1 teaspoon, omitted the coconut, and added about 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts. They were gooooooooooood!!

I liked the crispiness & chewiness of this cookie and even though I didn't use the coconut they still had a nice taste that was curiously similar to coconut. I made the recipe using Crisco all vegetable shortening. These are a very attractive cookie, which is good since I'm taking them to a pot luck dinner. I will definitely make these again.

Great starter recipe to adjust as desired.  I am experimenting with some healthier cookie recipes and replaced half the shortening (I used butter) with 3/4 ground flaxseed meal.  I also cut back on the sugar and added a little maple syrup.  Still turned out great.  Thanks.

These are very good!  I'm so confused though as to where 4 dozen comes in because mine only made about 1.5 dozen and I used a regular cookie scoop.  Next time I may try making them with butter instead of the shortening but that's a personal preference.  I also baked for 11 min. and they came out perfect.

This is a delicious cookie, and crisper than most. I added both coconut and mini chocolate chips, and, upon tasting the raw dough, decided to add about 1/4 tsp. china cassia cinnamon.  Delicious!!  The recipe made about 2 and 1/2 dozen medium sized cookies.

Wow, these cookies are nice and crispy; didn't add chips or coconut but I did add raisins.  I think walnuts would have been really nice too, but I didn't have any!  Thanks for the recipe!

They're crispy and light! Delicious as is. I also tried them with 0.5 tsp cinnamon. Also good. Helps to press them flat with a wet fork before baking. I’ve also made these with butter. Honestly, these are delicious either way!

NOTE: I made these cookies without the coconut or the chocolate chips.

I love these! Exactly what I was looking for. Crispy, chewy and not too thin. I doubled the recipe and added 1 cup of reconstituted raisins and 1 tsp cinnamon. A double batch made 4 dozens cookies using a small cookie scoop.

Instead of 1/2 cup shortening, I substituted 1/4 cup butter and slightly less than 1/4 cup olive oil. Made it super moist!I also reduced the sugar. All my friends loved them. I've made them 3 times already.

Great recipe as is! Have also made it by subbing dried cranberries and slivered almonds for the coconut and chocolate chips and swapped the vanilla extract for 1/4 tsp maple extract. Either way yuuuummmyyy!

I used coconut oil instead of shortning (I NEVER use shortning or vegetable oil, always butter, lard or coconut oil). They turned out okay but they are so flat. There's absolutely no body to them. Maybe the dough needs to be refrigerated? Maybe they need more oats? More flour? Thankfully my husband loves flat, overcooked crisp cookies. ;)

I've tried many recipes and this is by far the best. I shape each cookie by hand and make them flat to make them crispy instead of just dropping them by the spoon. 
I also add 1/2 cup of chopped pecans or walnuts. Thanks for the delicious recipe. Hubby loves it and he's a picky one.

I did love this cookie. It disappoints in the oatmeal area because that does not dominate its flavor but its a wonderful cookie! You could add anything to the basic recipe for a variety of cookies. Just grind up your oatmeal.

First, these cookies taste fabulous!    I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because it's not truly an oatmeal cookie.  It's more of a choc chip cookie w oatmeal as an ingredient.  Plus, this is a small batch - I did not get 4 dz.  I only got 2+ and I made them SMALL.  I can't imagine making them any smaller to get 4 dz - it would be more of just a bite than a cookie.      That said, the cookies really do taste great - 12 min in my oven made them a little browner than I prefer, but my husband likes them that way.  I took the suggestion and used 1/4 butter + 1/4 crisco.  I also added in some walnuts.

Not enough wet ingredients! This batter was so difficult to mix, and later roll. The end product tastes awfully sugary, and there are very little oats in the cookie. I'll be finding a different recipe for this.

These cookies are just fabulous. I wanted to try them first with no tweaks. I didn't have any coconut on hand, but that would have only added to how good they already are. I would suggest trying the recipe as is, first, because you can't realistically give it a grade if half the ingredients are changed.

This is a great recipe.  I added oats and toasted shredded coconut.  After rolling into balls, I used the bottom of a glass to flatten. Last, I pressed a sugar coated fork on top of each flattened cookie.  They are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

I was drawn to this recipe by the word "crispy" in the title. There are many recipes for soft and chewy oatmeal cookies and few for crispy, which is what I was looking for. Since I wanted a crispy oatmeal raisin cookie that spread out nicely, I omitted the coconut and used raisins instead of chocolate chips. I used butter instead of shortening. To ensure crispness, I used 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 brown instead of 1/2 and 1/2, but I think they would've still been fine if I'd stuck to the original proportions. They were nice and crisp and just a tad chewy in the very center. For the desired flavor, I added 1/4 tsp. each of cinnamon and nutmeg. I didn't want them overly brown and crisp on the bottom, so in lieu of greasing the cookie sheet I used parchment paper. Next time I will go half and half on the sugars as per the original recipe, since they got almost too crispy when completely cooled, but I will keep my other tweaks. These cookies taste great! BTW, 12 min. at 350  worked for me. They were a perfect golden brown and the picture they show doesn't do the cookies justice. Almost forgot, added an extra 1/4 cup oats, too, and got about three dozen. You'd have to roll these mighty small to get four.

These cookies are AMAZING but, I'm not a fan of super sweet cookies.  True to form, I reduced the sugar in half. So 1/4 cup of each sugar.  I increased the oatmeal to 1(1/4) cups.

Didn't have any chocolate chips or coconuts on hand (so put a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon instead) otherwise followed the recipe exactly and they were gone within minutes!!! We have made these cookies almost every night this week (which is why we're currently out of butter now) but Definitely a keeper and am looking forward to trying it with chocolate chips and coconuts next time!

I tried this recipe without using the coconut and instead of chocolate chips I used dried cherries. Came out great! So much so that I've had several people ask for the recipe.

I need to try this again.  I used dried cherries and roasted and salted sunflower seeds as my additions.  I think the sunflower seeds need to be raw, or make another choice.  The cookie was good, though.

Very good recipe.  I used a bit less white sugar and brown sugar, and they were still " plenty " sweet.  Nice and crisp and flavorful!  The best crisp oatmeal cookie I have found so far.  They are " not dry "...which is excellent.  This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe is fantastic. The cookies are so nice and crispy. I did not grease the cookie sheet because if I did, I knew they would burn in my old oven, and I did not roll the dough into balls. This recipe is a keeper!

These cookies are great!!
The only subs that I made were splenda for the white sugar, and egg substitute for the egg. Instead of the 1/2 cup of choc. chips I used 1/4 cup semi-sweet choc. chips and 1/4 cup butterscotch chips.....very yummy! Will definately make again.

These were great.  I used half shortening and half butter.  They turned out great.  The consistency is great like the other reviews say.  For my taste, the amount of oats was perfect.  If there were any more, I think it would be too much.  Next time I may cut back on the chocolate chips, a little too much for my taste.  I will definitely be making these again.

This was a great recipe, but I altered slightly. I used butter instead of margarine and added extra vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. With these changes, the cookies are delicious! Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

These were delicious! Only made about 27 cookies though so would double recipe next time. I added the choc but not the coconut..next time would also divide batter and make 1/2 without chocolate chips...seemed overpowering to the oatmeal taste.

Wow!  Best oatmeal cookies in a long time.  I doubled the recipe and used half butter flavored shortening and half butter.  Next time I will use all butter.  I add raisins and coconut.  Fabulous.

These were freakin' fantastic. Since everyone else wanted to be different, I just followed the recipe. (Well, I left out the chocolate chips because I didn't have any.) This will be my new oatmeal cookie recipe.

Very good but mine were not chewy in the middle-crispy all the way through. And very crumbly. I follwed the recipe except I didn't use the coconut and used raisens instead of c. chips. I'll make these again.

this was a great recipe! i used all brown sugar like others suggested and bumped teh oatmeal up to 1 cup.  I added some dried cranberries and added an entire teaspoon of vanilla.I also used butter instead of shortening because i didnt have any, but they turned out fine.  they turned out wonderful--i think next time i'll add some cinnamon. it was a great thing to bake because i wasn't well stocked in suppplies--it was simple, quick, and delicious.

This recipe is a keeper! Makes a wonderful, crispy cookie.  Instead of adding the chocolate chips and coconut, I substituted butterscotch chips.  The recipe only makes about 2 dozen, so I plan to make another batch, since my husband keeps going back for more!

These cookies were wonderful right out of the oven. I just added coconut, as I did not have any chocolate chips. The texture was great--very chewy. I only wish they would store a little better--they get too hard when they cool.

REEAALLYY GOOD COOKIES!  I only added the coconut thinking that the chocolate-chips would have made them too sweet.  But they weren't too sweet at all! They were wonderful!!!  I think I will try adding the chips next time just to see, not that it is necessary, just want to see the difference!  Anyway, super tastey cookies and great texture too!  

(Recipe only made a little over 2 dozen for me.  Maybe I made the cookies larger than expected.)

I've made these cookies a few times now, trying different variations of adding white chocolate chips, raisins, nuts... and each time they've been perfect. I was looking for a recipe that produced a cookie with enough texture, but not too brittle or too soft. This is it! Great cookie.

These were certainly crispy!  I had exactly 1C of flour left in my kitchen and wanted something sweet, so I tried these.  They were good, but seemed to be missing the richness of a cookie that's made with butter.  I had never made a cookie with shortening before & I don't know if that had something to do with it.  These made about 3 1/2 dz for me and I made them VERY small.  I may try butter next time in place of the shortening and see if that helps.  Overall, a good cookie.  I added chocolate chips and will add nuts next time as well.

Thank you! This is the  recipe that I have been looking for for the past 24 years. My original was lost when we moved.I have NEVER found another recipe that compared.   The only thing I did differently was to omit the coconut and chocolate chips and added raisins. Thank you again.

Yummy yummy. To get extra crispy cookies, I do 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup coconut oil. Also, took the advice of another reviewer and lessened the brown sugar while increasing the cane sugar by 2 tablespoons. I had dried cherries so I added that with coconut ant pecans. Always a crowd pleaser!

nice and crisp.  i read the reviews which i find most helpful and halved the brown sugar and added 2 T more of white.  used 1 1/4 c. oats rather than 3/4 c. (as one reviewer said not enough oats in them).  i omitted the coconut and choc. chips (they were optional) as i was looking for just a crispy oatmeal cookie.  i will definitely make these again.

Followed the recipe ingredients to a T. Cooked on air un-greased sheets, convection @ 325. Rack-cooled. Came out crunchy and delicious! Will double next time.

Not the kind of crispy I was looking for.  Mine came out crumbly.  Too Sweet.  I did not need to grease the sheets.  I had to bake longer...like 18 minutes.

These turned out really great. I will probably put in a few more oats. I added raisins and chocolate chips...they didn't seem to be optional as I love both...lol. I also reduced the brown sugar to about 1/3  cup and 2/3 cup white sugar. It seems to make the cookie crispier. Nutmeg and cinnamon were also added at just a pinch each.

These were super easy and delicious.  I did not have coconut or chocolate chips.  I did add oatmeal flour in place of the coconut and added a 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  Nice and crispy on the outside.  Very nice taste.  Will definitely make again, hopefully next time with the coconut and chocolate chips.

Great crunchy cookie!! I read the reviews and cut the butter in half and the sugar in half and they were delicious!! Also added all white and no brown sugar to make them even crunchier! Also used white whole wheat for the flour.  For a cookie, not bad.  Pretty healthy.  Thanks

Love these! I'm a low supply nursing mom and had enough of buying expensive lactation cookies online. My first batch using 1 of those highly raved lactation cookies recipe tasted terrible. I was looking for a recipe for crispy oats cookies & decided to give this a try. I cut the brown sugar by half, added 2 more tablespoon of white sugar as suggested and i added 2 tablespoon of brewers yeast (soaked in 2 tablespoon of water for 5 mins before adding to the mixture), quarter cup of steel cut oats, quarter cup of cut-up dried cranberries, quarter cup of almond nuts, moderate amount of choco chips. Baking time was 20 mins for me though. And i must say the cookies tasted real good! crunchy but not too hard, a little chew due to the cranberries. i love them and am prepared to bake another batch this weekend. ill be cutting down the sugar level, use white chocolate instead of choc chips and bump up on the oats.

I didn’t like these, they came sweet and gritty. I wouldn’t call them crisp. I added a half cup of raisins. No nuts. Not much of an oatmeal flavor, just too sweet for my taste.

These are the best and not because i changed it .  I subbed margarine for shortening with an extra dollop because of the adde oats.   followed other comments about 1/2 the brown sugar and additional 2 tbls of white sugar, went with the 1 1/4 cup of oats  did the pumpkin pie spice .  my time was 16min .
OMG they are crisp almost through which is what i was looking for . thank you I get nothing but A+'s from anyone who tries them.

This recipe is a keeper !  Exactly what i was looking for.  I frequently make small changes in recipes when i feel like it and this was no exception.  i ALWAYS reduce the sugar.  Omitted the white sugar and increased brown to 3/4 C . . . plenty sweet for us.  I changed the 1C flour to 1/2 C and added 1/2 C oat flour by putting rolled oats in a Braun coffee grinder and pulsing a few times.  That was it!  The 12 minutes was perfect for my oven.

great cookie.  I made them with Gluten-free flour, omitted coconut & chocolate chips.   I wanted OATMEAL cookies.  The results were great, so good they didn't last more than a few days.

These are really great cookies. I love crunchy as well as soft oatmeal cookies and these hit the crunchy spot. The only thing i changed was using butter in place of shortening since i dont use it and added dried cranberries. Then i rolled the dough into a log in some cling film and chilled it till i was ready to use. I made 30 decent sized cookies off the log,could have been more if it stretched the roll out more.

I LOVED these cookies!! I used unsalted butter instead of shortening and a sprinkle of cinnamon! I added butterscotch chips and dark chocolate chunks instead of chocolate chips!! I made large cookies with an ice cream scoop and baked them at 360 degrees for a couple minutes extra! crispy perfect on outside and soft and chewy inside!  some of them I iced with a powdered sugar glaze...some perfectly plain! my new favorite oatmeal cookie!!! I cant wait to try with rum soaked raisins!!!

This recipe was perfection! I didn't have shortening or enough butter so I actually made it with 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 coconut oil and I used egg whites instead of an egg... I also did half and half dark chocolate chips and butterscotch chips and the cookies tasted almost like candy! They had a perfect dense-ness to them.  I used a tablespoon to scoop out my balls and dropped them on the pan. This will be my go to recipe moving forward!

Made for the first time and we love it!  I added chopped almonds- don't think the recipe called for. Also, toasted our coconut..super yummy! Added 2 minutes to cook time- the first batch was a bit  undercooked at suggested time.

These were good crumbly cookies.  I did increase the oatmeal to a full cup.  I don't know how others got more spread on theirs, mine were dome like...the way things normally go with shortening recipes.

Excellent recipe, I left out the coconut and chocolate chips and replaced them with 1/2 cup each of chopped walnuts and butterscotch chips.  My new favorite cookie.

It seems silly to add another wonderful review, but this is a really nice cookie. The person I baked them for is going to love them because they are crispy (dunk-able) and sweet. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 coconut oil. I did not have the flaked coconut. I am sure I will make these again!

The dough seemed really dry. I think my biggest complaint is that the recipe said it would make 4 dozen. I would have had to have made them about 1/4 of the size(of a walnut) that the recipe called for. Also, they didn't flatten out. Just stayed in a dry ball. I followed the recipe to a T. Will not make again.

The ingredients in this cookie didn't seem to mix together. When the cookie was done, I could still taste all the separate ingredients. 

I would also suggest using parchment paper. The batch I made on my cookie sheet didn't hold together at all.

My family and I loved these cookies!  I added about a tsp or so of cinnamon to the second batch I baked and they were amazing!  I did omit the coconut simply because I didn't have any on had.

I have looked for years for a crispy oatmeal cookie recipe, my husband's favorite. Thank you so much! He loves these cookies. I did replace 1/4 cup of regular flour with oat flour & added raisins & chopped walnuts. Next time I make them, I'll add the chocolate chips & they just might be my favorite cookie!

I used margarine, no coconut or chocolate, for 1/2 batch, raisins for second half.  A little sweet for me but great for my daughters  snack. Quite easy.Addicttive crunch, found it hard to put them away, even though sweeter than i would like

This is the BEST recipe I have ever come across, with some cinnamon and nutmeg it reminds me of the cookies in the St. Louis Arch. DIVINE 
I didn't have vanilla so i substituted it with pear extract instead. I also didn't put coconut or chocolate chips and I baked  it at 390, because at 350 my cookies were no where near ready

Exactly what I was looking for in a plain oatmeal cookie. It was quick and very easy to make.  I did not add the coconut nor the chips.

This is a great recipe! I didn't add coconut or chocolate chips, but I did add some chopped pecans, and used all brown sugar. Next time I will try it with butter instead of shortening for more flavor, but it is good just as is for those who don't care to experiment.  Definitely a keeper!!

These were really good. I rate these a 4.5 so I rounded up! I doubled the recipe and changed the oatmeal to a total of 2 cups of oatmeal. I used 1 cup of craisins and did not use coconut or chocolate chips. I used butter instead of shortening. These were crispy and chewy at the same time, interesting texture. Thanks for the post.

WOW! These became my favorite cookie recipe the very first time I made them! They are equally delicious warm and chewy from the oven or cooled and crisp. I used butter instead of shortening and the recipe is short and sweet and easy to follow. Warning: They are very addicting!!!

These are really good cookies!  I added the recommended cinnamon and rolled the balls in the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  Two points to note:  they aren't really crispy and the recipe only makes about 2 dozen...so I ended up having to make two batches to get the number I needed.  Next time I will double everything.

This is an okay recipe but I didn't think it was particularly spectacular or unusual. Did not come out as crisp as I had hoped and was a bit crumbly. I'm wondering if an additional egg would be useful. Some cinnamon might be nice as well.

I've baked these several times.  I've used coconut, but not chocolate chips.  I love the texture and my picky husband eats them up.  They're delicious!

I accidently doubled up on the baking powder and forgot the baking soda and so they were flat cookies but they were amazing.  I bake for my class and these were everyone's favorites.  I would recommend doing it my way even though it is wrong b/c they have an interesting texture and are different.  But only bake for 6 to 7 minutes if you do it this way.

These were very good.  I did not add the coconut or chips.  I followed others advice and added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. I shaped them into balls and rolled them in a sugar/cinnamon mix before baking. I got about 20 medium size cookies. They were easy to make and came out looking nice.

These are by far the best cookies I have ever made. My husband asked if they were homemade since I usually resort to "break & bakes". I did not use the coconut or choco chips and did bake them for 10 minutes. YUMMY!!!!

omg, these cookies are simply incredible!! the only change i made was to make the balls a tad bit bigger (yielding 3 dozen cookies) & bake them an additional 2 minutes. definitely add the mini chocolate chips & coconut! the outside texture is crisp with a slightly chewy center....de-licious!! thank you s. hynek, we also enjoy making your "peanut butter oatmeat cookies" from this website!

Amazing! I just made these and they are REALLY GREAT! I didn't use the chocolate chips because I was afraid they'd be just too sweet, but I did use the coconut and that really made them taste awesome!
The only thing I'd recommend is that you make a double batch at least! They disappeared so fast I could hardly believe it!

I am surprised at how tasty this cookie is given its simple ingredients.  I used dark brown sugar, and the cookies turned out delicately crispy.  The oatmeal adds a nice nuttiness.  Unlike any other oatmeal cookie I've ever had!

Awesome cookies.  My kids and I whipped up a batch and we ate quite a few before they ever made it into a Tupperware!  I added the coconut (adds great flavour) and the chocolate chips.  Next time I think I'll add coconut again as well as dried cranberries.

I used my cookie scoop and only got three dozen out of the recipe.  I upped the vanilla to a full teaspoon, added a teaspoon of cinnamon, and threw in a cup of chopped pecans instead of the chocolate chips and coconut.  I think next time I'm going to use Heath bar bits also and maybe increase the salt a bit.  They have a great texture, the flavor just needs to be tweaked a little bit.  I've never made good oatmeal cookies before--this one goes in my recipe box!

These are so light and crispy they hardly
seem like an oatmeal cookie.  I added coconut but not the chocolate chips.It was wonderful, next time I may try adding butterscoth morsels as I think they would go well with this cookie.

I made "cookie cakes" with these, putting the round balls in mini muffin pans instead.  They came out with a hole in the middle so I made cinnamon icing and topped each with a raisin (but I just put enough icing to fill the centre).  Great outcome and taste, though since they're oatmeal cookies, I would add more next time.  Also, I didn't use the coconut and chocolate chips, but that's only because I am a wuss!  Super recipe.  Gotta love the juiciness.

These are the BEST oatmeal cookie I have ever made.  My family loves oatmeal cookies but any recipe I have ever tried I've never really been happy with them.  You don't really notice the coconut flavor a lot, but the combination is heavenly! Everyone that tried them wanted the recipe.  I didn't care for the choc chips, but raisins or wht choc chips and macadamias are awsome in them!

These were good, but more soft than crispy.  My mixture was also too moist to role into balls so I ended up making them as drop cookies.  I think I went wrong with using Blue Bonnet tub margarine with no trans fats.

These cookies were good.  I also got about 4 dozen-small ones.  I think they were best the day they were made-seemed to get harder/crispier each day after.  I did not add the chips and still great.  Would make again but going to try some other recipes first.

These were such crispy cookies! I tried them with the chocolate chips but I think they would have been wonderful without them. I went to work and when I got home my boyfriend had finished all but 2 of them! Definitely a big hit!

I used only a 1/4 cup of nuts. A combination of sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds and coconut (all raw). I used raisins instead of choc. chips. I also added a 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon. They turned out really nummy!

OH, and btw...I screwed up with the measurements of the nuts.  I MEANT to add the full 1/2 cup...but for whatever reason I only ended up with a 1/4 cup.  Whatever...still good.  But in the future I'd use more nuts/seeds.  I think this would also be good with sunflower seeds.

Great cookies. I added the coconut and wow! Next time I will add both the coconut and the chocolate. It's worth it to add the extras. The dough is dry so you will have to roll them into balls like the recipe says but that is also why the cookies have the PERFECT crunch.

I liked this oatmeal cookie recipe, but for some reason I needed to add an extra egg to the dough because it was too crumbly.  I also sprinkled the tops of the cookies with cinnamon and sugar before baking. Picky hubby thought they were "okay" -- not sure if I would make again, but would definetly recommend the recipe.

YUM!!  I whipped up a batch of these easy to make cookies last night before our guests showed up.  They were a huge hit!  I'm not quite sure however, how the recipe makes 4 dozen cookies--I only ended up with about 2 1/2 dozen.  Regardless, this is a recipe that is  definitely a keeper.

My husband loves crispy cookies.   These turned out so good.    I made one batch with dried cranberries and one with chocolate chips and coconut!
Thank you for the great recipe!

I didn't add the chips, but I loved this cookie, crisp with a slight coconut taste.  I am always looking for an oatmeal recipe without raisins, this was great, a keeper.  Thanks
