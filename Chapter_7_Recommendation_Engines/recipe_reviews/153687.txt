This was not a good recipe for my family. I thought they would like it because they love apples and cheese and apples and peanut butter.  The pie crust was doughy in some spots and could not wrap around the stuffing.  My children took one bite and did not like them.  My husband and I ate them but I will not be making this recipe again. It didn't taste good at all.
