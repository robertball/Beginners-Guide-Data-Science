I used oven baked turkey instead of ham and ranch dressing mix instead of italian.  Mixed cream cheese and dressing mix (needed only half the dressing mix), spread cream cheese on tortilla and put spinach on top, then layered sliced turkey.  Roll tightly and refrigerated--excellent!!!  I made 9 large tortillas...and there were only 4 pieces left over at the end of the night....

This was a very easy, and still very good recipe. If I could make one recommendation it would be to lather on the cream cheese pretty thick, otherwise you might not hardly be able to taste it. It was great though...quick and easy!

This is what I LOVE about Allcipes.com, reviewer suggestions to "improve" a recipe!  Prior reviewer suggested minced dill pickles or carrots.  After seeing what the original recipe looked like put together, I decided to try both suggestions!  I scaled the recipe back to 2 servings (needed to try out myself before giving to the kids)!!  I could hardly wait for the 1 hour to be up!  These are VERY GOOD!

Tasty, very easy to make. Kind of plain though, next time I will add vegetables. Shredded carrots, lettuce or even pickles. Works best if made the night before, sliced rolls stay rolled up.

These were good if eaten right away.  I wrapped them up and put in the refrigerator and they became soggy.

This recipe is so AWESOME!!!  I made these as a finger food for a baby shower and they were gone almost instantly.  I also recommend making them with Ranch and Turkey instead of Italian and Ham.  Either way you can't go wrong!

We served these at our Christmas party last night, and they were the first thing to go. Several people commented on how great they were. I made ham with the italian and turkey with the ranch. I love that they are quick and easy to make, yet are a definite crowd pleaser. I will be making these often!

This is a really good, versatile recipe! When I made it, I didn't have any italian dressing mix on hand so I used french onion soup mix instead and it turned out really tasty. Of course, with cream cheese being the main component in the recipe, ho can it NOT be good! LOL!

This is a great recipe - and has been in my family for years as "Polish Roses". We usually use a packet of dry hidden valley ranch dressing and a 1/3 cup of miracle whip mixed in with the cream cheese. We also dice up black olives and green onions to mix in, before rolling everything up. Yum!

I was looking for something quick, easy and tasty to fix for a Christmas eve appetizer. This recipe fits the bill. Even with only 4 ingredients it packs a lot of taste. My sister-in-law even asked for the recipe. I was happy to share!

My husband loved these!  They are very easy and would be very flexible to add or change things.  I like these better than the typical mexican rollups!  I looked for a while before I found these but I'm sure glad I kept looking.  The dressing adds great flavor!

Made these for my hubby's potluck party at work -they were a hit! I am a "noncook" and these were easy to make. The only thing I wished I would have done differently is layered more ham as I did each tortilla. I used it pretty sparingly because I thought I might run out and I had a lot leftover in the end.

Great base for this recipe.  I mixed in mayo in the cream chez (about 2 spoonfuls) and used dry ranch dressing mix (not the whole packet). Also spread diced veg. like green and red peppers. You should use THIN sliced ham, turkey or salami......everyone will rave!!!!   Also, wrap and stick them in the frig overnight, they will be easier to cut.

These were good however I cant really rate them because I changed the recipe completley which I hate to do.  I used ranch instead of italian and turkey instead of ham and added fresh spinach.  I personally thought they were very strong tasting.  Next time I would only use 1/2 packet of the ranch mix and put more turkey and spinach in them.

I used ranch and turkey. I doubled the recipe for a party and spread the cream cheese on pretty thick. It was delicious. I made the tortillas the night before and rolled them tightly in plastic wrap. I cut them in the morning and they were not soggy at all.

This was fast, easy, and had a nice flavor. Maybe I spread this too thin, but I scaled this down to 1 serving which called for 1 oz of cream cheese and I still got 2 tortilla roll ups from it with 1 oz of ham on each ending up with 2 servings after all. Thanks Judith for a great recipe, this was really good.

These are good written the way the recipe is, but they are great if you add a little texture and color.  I added a little fresh baby spinach leaves and chopped roasted red peppers.  Then it became a 5 star recipe.

SOOOOO easy, quick, and delicious! Ideal for serving at a casual gathering or bringing to a potluck, etc. I brought them to a friend's party and there wasn't a single one left. Plus they're cheap to make, and they're much tastier than the store bought ones. Next time I will probably use about 1/2 of the italian dressing, as it was a bit rich. Also can't wait to try ranch and turkey as well. Thanks for this recipe, I'll be using it many, many times.

This was very good. I did a variation using turkey, swiss and ranch dressing mix, and that version was more popular. I did receive feedback that people liked these better than other pinwheel sandwiches they've tried - better flavor that I would attribute to the dressing seasonings added. Definitely refrigerate 8 hours - overnight to make them stay together better.

I tried this with dry onion soup, a layer of shredded Mexican cheese(4 cheeses),  and turkey.  Next time I am skipping the turkey because it was lost in the taste.  I am making these for a wedding next week and plan to use the spinach tortilla's. Great recipe

I made these for a buffet lunch I was catering - what a hit! People couldn't stop taking "just one more" =)

Always a hit at every potluck or gathering. Have made them different ways using the suggestions of other raters. We like them made with ranch dip mix best.

Easy and delicious!  I didn't use the entire envelope of Italian dressing.

Very easy!!  I also added diced red pepper and grated cheese.  If you are going to make them for a summer aoutdoor party try mix the filling with 2-3 unflavored gelatin to keep them firm.

Made this for a faculty meeting, and they loved it! After gleaning some ideas from the comments, I added celery, orange bell pepper, and chopped olives (do not buy pre-chopped...too soggy and sort of tasteless...buy whole and chop yourself). I also used turkey instead of ham and ranch dressing instead of Italian. I agree with the others on the powered dressing though: a little goes a long way. I ended up 1 packet of HV ranch on DOUBLE this recipe and the flavor was just perfect. I can't imagine how it would have tasted if followed to the letter. My mouth is puckering at the thought as I type this. Not a single rollup left take home and several requests for the recipe. The recipe serves as a good base, but I don't think I would have been satisifed with the result if not for the comments warning me about the dressing ratio and helpful vegetable extras to give it texture...so one star removed.
