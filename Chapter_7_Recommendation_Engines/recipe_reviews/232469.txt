This was a great marinade!  I was looking for a quick chicken marinade and this really fit the bill.  As we're preparing to move, I didn't have honey so substituted the same amount of brown sugar.  I also didn't have chili powder but used a pinch of red pepper flakes.  We are gluten free so I used gluten free soy sauce.  Everyone loved it!

This was delicious, and I'm not a big fan of chicken.  This marinade imparted a lot of flavor into the meat.  Mr. LTH did have some grilling issues (it ended up a bit "blackened", I assume because of the honey), but he managed to pull it out.  I made the marinade in the morning before work and the BLSL breasts marinated about 11 hours before we grilled them.  THANKS for the recipe!

I would make it again but cut down on the oil.  I used bone-in/skinless chicken thighs.  Flavor was great, just too much unnecessary oil.

Excellent quick and flavourful marinade.  Followed recipe minus veg oil.   Marinaded boneless, skinless chicken thighs for 15min,  then baked in one pan with chopped potatoes and asparagus (both tossed in olive oil, S&P) at 400• for 30min.   So yummy!

Quick Chicken Marinade Haiku: "Didn't have the chives. Four hours, chicken, oh yum! Have now made it twice." Great marinade w/ easy ingredients one typically has around; made it as directed except omitting the chives due to not having them. Delicious, intense flavor w/ nice color, and perfectly moist chicken within.

Made it just as is. Got a little black on the grill with the honey, but so tasty! Marinading for 4 hours was perfect.

I have several 5 star chicken marinades marked on here that I rotate thru each week. I just tried this Quick Chicken Marinade and it might topple my previous favorite, Pretty Chicken. I made minimal adjustments (used a tablespoon fresh minced garlic because I love it and had it on hand, and a teaspoon of chili powder because a 1/4 tsp didn’t seem like very much) but everything else was as written. Everyone in the house said it was awesome. It was not as sweet as I was expecting with 3 tablespoons of honey, but that was a good thing. I seem to burn everything with sugar on the grill so tried putting down foil sprayed with Pam. It looked beautiful and turned out great! I will definitely use foil from now on.

This was one of the hits when I searched AllRecipes for a chicken marinade. Couldn't just do it as published, so I substituted scallions for the chives I never have on hand, used some sesame oil in place of some of the vegetable oil, toasted some sesame seeds and tossed them in, used apple cider vinegar rather than plain white, dried minced garlic in place of the powder, and opted out of the black pepper and chili pepper, since my wife wanted it a bit bland. So I guess it was more of a bulgogi marinade than originally intended. At any rate, the chicken came off the grill nice and creamy and smooth delicious with basmati rice and peas.

We were very happy with this and did a quick rice side dish using the leftover marinade. 

I just used jasmine quick rice (microwave in a pouch kind), cooked that, then boiled the leftover marinade for a few minutes to kill any chicken bacteria. Then stirred in 1/2 a can of black beans. It was great and so was the chicken.

Made as directed, but used just 1/4 cup of each oil. Loved the flavor. No trouble grilling; wasn’t too sticky. The charred pieces were the best!

This had a very pleasant flavor but was too mild, even with a fairly long marinade time (5 hours). I liked the combination of flavors, slightly sweet and salty and layered.  It might have been nicer with a bit more honey and/or something to give it a kick. I used fresh garlic and had to substitute a smaller amount of scallions for the chives, but I don’t think those changes were significant.  Do consider using foil. I didn’t and my skinless boneless chicken breasts stuck badly to the oiled grill.

I didn't add the chives or the chili powder because of the people I was cooking for. I marinated chicken breasts and I brushed it on the sausages also. Delicious!

The first time I made this I made it using all of the ingredients. It was a big hit. I just made this again using chipotle olive oil in place of regular olive oil and left out the ginger, once again it was a hit.

Very Good! After reading other reviews I did omit the veg oil and added a couple shakes of red pepper flakes, otherwise exact. I cut up the chicken for kabobs and only marinaded for 2 hours.

It was excellent even though I had to substitute dried minced onion flakes for chopped chives and King syrup for honey. It worked just fine.

Didn't have 4 hours to marinade but no biggie. I marinated for 2 hours and it turned out wonderful.  I will use this recipe again and again.
