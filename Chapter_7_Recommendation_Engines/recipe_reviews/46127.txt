OMG this is AMAZING!!! And easy. Didn't have celery (and don't like it) so used a little celery seed which added just enough for flavor. Added 1 1/2 teaspoons old bay into stuffing mix. Used imitation crab and chopped up that and some large shrimp rather than using the canned products, added water to right consistency since I didn't have the "juices". Used about half as much butter. Used flounder fillets. Put a large handful of stuffing on one side and folded the other half over. Basted with butter and sprinkled liberally with old bay and cajun seasoning. Looked awesome. Added a sauce of 1/2 C mayo, 1 T lemon juice, 1 t milk, 1 t Old Bay. Made a pool around the fish and drizzled over. For a fairly simple meal, it looked and tasted out of this world.

This recipe was very easy, and it had an awesome flavor.  I did make some adjustments.  I used fillets instead of the whole flounder. I also left out the onion, simply because I do not like onions.  I also made a cheese sauce to go on this, it was really good.  My husband had some with and without the sauce, and we both agree the sauce made what was delicious even better.  I would recommend trying this recipe.

Very good, a little salty.  Seems fancy but is actually very easy.  If using frozen flounder filets, place one on the bottom, spread stuffing on top and cover with a second filet.

WOW!  I loved this recipe!  I used talapia instead of flounder (we live in Texas where flounder isn't readily available).  I also minimized the butter.
I used just one talapia filet and topped it with the stuffing.

Dredge talapia filet in bread crumbs (I used Italian Seasoned bread crumbs)

Lay filets down in a buttered (greased) 13 x 9 pan (I had a glass pan)

Spoon the stuffing on top and flatten with the spoon (to make room for MORE stuffing!)

Bake at 350 for 25 minutes.

As for the stuffing, I sauted (sp?) the celery and onion in a bit of olive oil -- again, to minimize the butter.

That mixture, plus the juices from the canned shrimp and crab was plenty to soak the stuffing mix.

All in all, this recipe was GREAT!  Hubby loved it!

The stuffing was amazing -- the best part!

I made this tonight and my husband usually doesn't comment on what's for dinner. When he ate this, I was shocked when he turned to me and said "wow, this is really good!" Everyone loved it and it's a definate keeper! I followed the recipe exact, only substituting flounder fillets for the whole flounder. I did have a lot of stuffing left over...next time I'll half the recipe. Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

Looks very impressive with an entire flounder-- although better instructions on deboning and prep would be appreciated.  We ended up cutting off the head and butterflying it but leaving the bones in and eating with caution. I didn't have celery, and I wish I'd gone to get it at the store before cooking-- the stuffing definitely needs the crunch of the celery.  Also added chopped parsley after baking for color and presentation.  Go easy on the seasonings- the stuffing can get pretty salty with all of the spices in the stuffing and canned shrimp and crab.  Keeps great in the fridge for a few days.

This recipe is EXCELLENT!! I made this last nite for 'Lent', because my family is "Fire-hall 'Fish sandwiched' Out", and this was not only easy to make, but VERY delicious!!! Instead of the 'whole flounder', I used Cod fillets, and rolled the stuffing into them!! Wonderful!! It Definitely will be a 'regular' here during Lent!! Thanks Brian!!!

This recipe was great!  I loved it.  Used a flounder fillet instead of a whole flounder and rolled it up with the stuffing in the middle.  I halved the recipe for 1 fillet and had a lot left over, so I made it again with Tilapia the next night and I didn't like the Tilapia as much.  Definitley recommend the flounder though!

-1 canned crab, -1 canned shrimp, -1 too much butter, also should have added a bit of oil into the butter to raise the burning point of the butter when frying the fish, something like olive oil, or vegetable oil. So two tablespoons of butter, and two tablespoons of oil.

This was very good.  I used flounder fillets and folded them in half.  Drizzled olive oil on the outside so fish would not dry out.  Will make again.

YUM!  I used frozen filets and no butter in this dish. I sprayed the pan with PAM and sprayed the top of the fish so it wouldn't dry out.  I sauteed the onions and celery and added them to the stuffing along with some onion and garlic powder.  I also used the Old Bay, Cajun Seasoning and some cayenne on the fish.  Really, really good!  Thanks!

Excellent!  Used fresh fish fillets from Mexico (similar to flounder but the fish guy didn't know the English name for it).  Used herb flavored stuffing since my daughter is pescatarian (fish eating vegetarian).  We loved it and will definitely make it again!

BEST!!! 18 years of marriage....FIRST time my husband has ever raved over something I made. He was IN-LOVE!! I didn't have celery so I chopped up mushroom to put in it. We butterflied our fillets and stuffed them. I added the cajun and old bay spice to the stuffing and also to the top of the fish. YUMMY!!!!

Remarkable! I followed the recipe except I didn't have celery on hand nor shrimp or the seasonings (ie. old bay, cajun). I used a small amount of chicken broth in my chicken flavored cornbread stuffing since I didn't have the canned shrimp. I used flounder fillets spread the stuffing on top and rolled them and pinned them with a toothpick. Removed the toothpick before serving (they stayed together). Served with lots of fresh squeezed lime juice on top and a side of steamed Asparagus. Delicious! Thanks Brian for a great recipe. It felt like we were dining at an expensive restaurant, but only paid $12 for the entire meal!

This recipe was easy to make and it was good, but the flavored stuffing mix overpowered the flavor of the crab meat (even though I added 3 more oz of crab meat to the stuffing).  I'll be  using plain bread crumbs in the future, or perhaps just look for another recipe.  Also, this recipe made much more stuffing than I could use for five large flounder fillets (2 lbs).

I really liked the idea of it... however the stuffing was not very good. I will def. make it again I will just use more crab meat with stuffing mix and maybe some cream cheese and chedder. The stuffing was just too dry.

This was delicious! I used the suggestions of  others and used talapia. The first time I used two small fillets and put the stuffing between. The second time I did a "semi-stuffed fish", I put two scoops of stuffing directly on the buttered pan and laid one filet on the top of it and followed the rest of the directions. It still was scrumptious!!!!

For someone who really doesn't like fish at all I thought this was pretty good. My husband who likes fish thought it was great. I didn't use the shrimp juice though as i didn't want it to taste anymore "fishy" than it had too. The stuffing was the best part but also went well with the fish .

Awesome! I made this recipe with only crab, as I was doing stuffed shrimp. It was a huge hit in my house! I will say, though, that if you use regular stuffing, as opposed to reduced-sodium stuffing, you should definitely also use unsalted butter. I used regular stuffing and salted butter, and while the flavor was amazing, it was a saltier than I would have preferred. I think that next time that I make this (which is probably going to be tonight, once I get home from work, because I polished off the remaining stuffing this morning), at least one of the two sticks of butter I use will be unsalted. At some point, I will also add scallops to the mix.

I used all crab and no shrimp; crab from the seafood section of the grocery store that is in a plastic container as the canned taste like the can to me.  We enjoyed this very much but next time will add some cayenne and Blackening seasoning to the butter, celery, and onions along with a couple tablespoons of white wine before mixing into the stuffing.  Also, did not have whole fish rather had tilapia so just put the stuffing between two nice size pieces of the tilapia.  Will certainly make again but will add my kick to it.

Awesome recipe. I love the celery crunch in this recipe!I made it and put it on top of tilapia instead of flounder (because tilapia is thin and it was hard to stuff) I had a lot left over so I made small cakes out of them, and put them in the oven for about 10 minutes at 350 and presto- instant seafood cakes!

I leave out the shrimp because my fiance hates shrimp and added some Worcestershire because I like it... Tasted amazing. Pretty easy to make too but I ended up with way too much stuffing. Maybe my fish was too small.

Excellent recipe.  I did omit most of the butter.  I did use 2 TBS for cooking the onion and celery, and used equal parts of chicken broth and reserved liquid to moisten the broth. The Old Bay seasoning was just the right flavor to finish this wonderful dish.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

This is an excellent recipe.  Although I used tilapia instead of flounder I love the way the stuffing turned out.  I added just a little fresh grated parmesan to the stuffing but overall the taste was delicious!  I will definitely make this recipe again and probably use the stuffing for stuffed mushrooms as well.

The family loved it. I added diced shrimp and scallops to stuffing. I also made a hollandaise sauce with a bit of lemon and dill weed. The sauce was nice as I think it would be a bit dry without it. A side of asparagus and a perfect dinner.

I loved this! My wife and I had it with some fresh flounder we bought at Wholly's in Pittsburgh...spectacular. I made the recipe as written. A few dyas later, I tried it with tilapia because it was all we had, and there was left over stuffing. The tilapia is not quite as good a match for the dish, a little too firm I thought. Use  the flounder, make the dish!

My teenager helped me make this for dinner. I wrapped each piece of fish in foil.  It looked like a dinner by the campfire it was delicious and the stuffing I used 2 6oz cans of crab meat added 1/4 cup of various peppers and used a fresh herbs and garlic seasoning.

Delish! Def restaurant quality meal. Used the fresh flounder filets we caught.  I only used half the amount of butter though to save calories. Used stove top chicken stuffing mix and added the cajun seasoning . Will be making again!

Didn't have a whole flounder, just filets, so I'd planned on just stuffing and rolling them, but my filets weren't having it. So I just laid them out flat on the cookie sheet, piled the stuffing on top, drizzled with butter (only used 1/4c for this, a full stick seemed unnecessary), seasoned and baked. Delicious and super-easy.

Everyone enjoyed it.Moist & flavorful.  Easy to make. Changes I made: I used flounder fillets,  1/2 cup of butter & 1/2 cup of chicken broth (instead of 1 cup of butter) & added some red peppers for flavor and color. Went well w/ a side of fresh baked asparagus spears. Will make again.

I keep this at the house and use it frequently.  We fish right on the intercoastal canal and the gulf, so we bring home flounder pretty often.  Sometimes we clean it so that it comes out like a "sock" and can be literally stuffed, sometimes we clean it in filets. If you can stuff it, its' better!  Make sure your stuffing is hot before you put it in the fish, or the fish will cook ahead of the stuffing.  All in all a great recipe, and I daresay that just about all of us make modifications to recipes that we think look good!  good job Brian!

I went floundering for the first time and had to figure out what to do with my beautiful fish. I used fresh crab meat instead of the canned crab and shrimp. This was just kinda bland. Not impressed.
