Very quick and easy to make because of how the sour cream adds the fat and you don't have to cut in butter/shortening.  They are very light and airy.  I added sharp cheddar and herbs to make them a little different.

This is a good lower fat version since there is no butter or lard in it but naturally it doesnt have as much flavor.  (I used low fat sour cream.)  Also, mine needed more liquid so I doubled the water (but I used milk).  Everyone loved these biscuits and they were even good leftover for breakfast the next morning, but I surely didnt get a dozen out of the recipe.  I had to half it again to even get 6!  I guess we like big biscuits....

I have been trying all sorts of biscuit recipes and most are bland.  This recipe was very tasty.  I took the advice of another review and added a little cheddar cheese. I will be making this again.

The dough is very sticky; it's important to flour your hands (and the counter and the biscuit cutter, etc.) well!  These biscuits are great, though, especially if you are bored with the plain tasting biscuit  - these have a slight tartness to them.  It's a soft biscuit, not crumbly as biscuits can sometimes get.  They taste great, too.

LOVVVVVVVVVED these biscuits!! I made them for breakfast this morning, and the first thing my husband said was to rave about how moist and chewy they were! We agreed by far these were some of the best we've ever had!! it was perfect because I ran out of sugar & milk- so the recipe was exactly what I needed!  Also: after I put the biscuits on the cookie sheet to bake, I spread some melted "Smart Balance" butter on the tops of them with a pastry brush, and they turned out really goldeny brown- and had a rich outer flavor!! 
&& just like everyone said, they ARE very sticky when you shape them, so use lots of flour on your hands!!  BUt again, fabulous recipe!!!

I had a craving for strawberry shortcake so I made these biscuts as part of my sweet treat- I thought they were great! I tried one with "Smart Balance" first, and on its own it was really tasty. It is a very easy recipe - and I did use low fat sour cream. I used a bit extra sour cream and then added just a few drops of water. I'll definately make these again! Thanks!

Very simple and I like the fact that they are virtually fat-free (I used fat-free sour cream).  However, they were a big chewy.  The flavor and consistency certainly don't match what you find in high-fat biscuits, but the saved calories does make them worth it.

great recipe I am a Kentuckian of 58 years. Biscuits are a way  of life. The things I added ( not changed) were I added 1 tbs of sugar to combat the baking taste. I use 1/4 cup 0f buttermilk instead of the water. Also baked on a grid. Brushed tops of bicuits with butter before baking. Baking time will need to be increased by about 4 to 5 minutes. Will use instead of my yeast biscuit recipe that I have used for many years.

I've made this many times (they are so easy to whip up), both with and without herbs (depends on what I have on hand) and it always comes out light and fluffy.  You don't tate the sour cream at all but it makes the texture extremely soft and airy.  My only complaint is that it seems to have a slight baking soda taste.

PERFECT!  I can finally quit looking for THE biscuit recipe.  The effect of the sour cream leaves them perfectly moist, yet allows them to be fluffy.  Because of what I was serving them with, I added a touch of herbs and cheese, but I can tell they will stand on their own just fine.  My youngest (aka Mr. Finicky) LOVES them! THAT's saying a lot!

Not too bad at all! I'd never made biscuits before, so this was a great easy recipe to start with. Personally I'm not a real fan of biscuits, but my family loves them. So I would say they're pretty good, but they would say they're great! The only thing is, like others have said, is the amount of wet ingredients. I had to add a few more tablespoons of water, and I think if I make them again, I will increase the sour cream to 1 cup. Still good though.

These were quick and easy. I substituted a non-dairy version of sour cream, Tofutti Sour Supreme, which worked well.

Just like the other reviews I needed to add more water.  I cut the recipe in half to just make 6 biscuits and I still needed to add 3 tablespoons of water.  The flavor and texture were nice and I did add in about a table spoon of dried chives since wheh I think sour cream I always think chives too.  Might even be nice to add a little shredded cheddar.  I just made drop biscuits, not rolled out and cut.  I will use this again, but will make a couple modifications.

These were really quite good, and easy to make with ingredients you have on hand.  Honestly, though...I couldn't tell the difference between these and bisquick baking powder biscuits.

First of all these measurements are way off, I had to add a considerable amount more sour cream and water too. I think I added several T more of sour cream and doubled the water. Once I got enough liquid in, this dough turned out very sticky and difficult to work with.  I settled for what turned out but it wasn't my best result for sure. Flavor was not all that good and they just weren't to my liking although they did turn out very fluffy.

I made these this morning because I had sour cream but no milk. I like them for this versatility, and they have a nice flavor, but this recipe is too inaccurate for a four-star review. I needed four times the water called for in the recipe, which probably made them chewier than they should have been - I kept adding in water and stirring, so I'm sure I overworked them. Also, I managed to get almost 12 biscuits out of them only by using a 1 1/2 in. cutter. This makes a biscuit much too small to be considered  a serving - each person would easily eat at least two. I'll probably make these again, since I often have sour cream and no milk, but I'll treat the sour cream like butter (i.e., cut it in), then start with at least 1/4 c, maybe 1/3 c of water.

I really like this recipe.  They are so moist and tasty.  Usually I need to add just a little bit more water to make the dough a better consistency.  Very easy and the family loves them.

I loved these biscuits, they were light and fluffy and not to mention delicious.  It's such a nice alternative to using shortening.  I used light sour cream and added some cheddar cheese.  The first time I made them I used milk instead of water as another reviewer had mentioned and they turned out some what dry.  The next time I used water and they were perfect! Although I did have to use almost a 1/4 cup of water to get the dough to the right consistency.  Thanks for the quick and easy recipe!

Dense little suckers, they were, but as I'm not an experienced biscuit maker, that might be my technique more than the recipe. They managed to stay moist enough to be palatable, so I will try them a few more times to see if I can get it right.

Super easy to make, excellent results and great flavor.  I did substitute beer for the little splash of water needed to stick the dough together, and I let them stand for 15 minutes after cutting.  Puffed up just like ma's.  Not "gummy" like other bp biscuits I've tried.  A definite keeper!  Thanx for sharing

These were very good!  I had my parents over for an impromptu lunch, and realized I had no rolls or anything decent - and ran out of bisquick.  I searched the web for a fast biscuit recipe - easy - with minimal ingredients and came upon this.   I had chicken in the oven due to come out in 20 minutes, and I mixed the biscuits and had them ready to put in 5 minutes before the chicken came out (FAST!).  One confession, I had low fat sour cream and was worried they might be bland - so I added about 3 tablespoons of butter and mixed it in with the sour cream as well.  I had NO trouble with the dough being sticky.. LOL!!!  not low fat - but they came out GREAT.  We topped them with some home-made garlic butter I had made for Christmas Eve (We had some left over) and they were very tasty :)   Thank you!!

These biscuits are light and fluffy and just amazing - they went great with the lentil soup tonight. The only changes I made was I found the dough needed a little extra water and I also added a handful of grated sharp cheddar and some garlic powder. I brushed the biscuits with melted butter and garlic powder with some oregano a few minutes before they were done with added some nice flavor and nice golden tops.

This was my first time making biscuits and these were super easy!  Maybe 5 min of prep time, and I just patted the dough into a biscuit shape and put them on my silpat.  I like that this recipe is virtually non-fat (I used non fat sour cream and my silpat instead of a buttered cookie sheet).  They are pretty bland, though.  They don't benefit from the flavor that butter adds.  Next time I'll add some cheese and hot sauce in the dough, or maybe a little sugar and spice, depending on how I'm using them.  Bland, but super easy, fluffy, moist in the middle, and quick!  Thanks!

They turned out well but I made a few changes.  I used half whole wheat flour and had to add some sour milk because it was too dry. Simple and great recipe.

Very good, very easy recipie.  Moist and crumbly.  The biscuits would also taste good with a little melted butter applied to the top before cooking with a brush.  Also, I kept adding water to try to get the ingredients to stick and finally just used my hands to make a ball.

These were pretty good, but I think I prefer the Mayonnaise Biscuits from this site. I added about five more tablespoons of water to get it to drop biscuit consistancy. This worked well with Dad's Hamburger Gravy.

Disappointing. Needed a lot more water. Not as light/airy as described. Been making biscuits for years, with better results from standard shortening/milk recipes.  Flavour was ok. Reviews were mixed, & thought I'd try it.  Not again.

I used Fat Free French Onion dip instead of plain sour cream.  Takes care of the bland taste in a hurry.

I was out of butter but had some sour cream in the fridge.  These biscuits were great with my big pot of chicken soup! Really moist, slightly tangy, with a little chew to them. They rose really well. They were super easy and fast.  The recipe needs more water though. I think I just about doubled it though I did not measure. I just went for a good, slightly  sticky dough, being careful not to over work it which makes them tough. I found my hands to be best.  Only got eight normal sized biscuits, not 12.  I think if you made small ones you might get 12, but then you would not need to cook them for so long. Perhaps between that and the water is why some had bad results with this recipe.  I say give it another try.  I will most definitely make these again!

These were so easy and really good.  I only had light sour cream on hand, so added a little melted butter to "fatten" them up.  Also added some dried herbs for flavor.

These were light, fluffy and oh so simple to make.  The dough WAS really sticky and I did need to add more water than what was stated, but all in all, these will work great whenever in a pinch.  Like some of the other reviewers, I did choose to add a little something to these and threw in about a tablespoon of Italian Seasoning. Thanks!

I had no problems making these and they turned out yummy.  I added a foccacia spice I had which was pre mixed and I only had my oven at 375 and the baked just right in 12 minutes.  Was very tasty with my butternut acorn squash soup I made from this site Yummy!

Pretty good substitute for a biscuit even when 1/2 whole wheat flour used.  Baking in a toaster oven at 450 degrees results in burned tops!

Delicious!  I added a little sugar, about 1 Tablespoon.  Also I used milk instead of water.  When they were done baking I topped each with a little bit of butter it bought out a nice golden color to the biscuits.  I served these with country ham and it was quite yummy!

Wonderful recipe!!! I needed a quick biscuit or roll to go with dinner tonight and found this one.  Including prep and cooking it took under twenty minutes!  I did add water as the recipe suggested and as long as my hands were floured handling was a cinch!  They were light fluffy and had a good flavor an all around great recipe for a quick biscuit!

It's alright.  This was the first time i made biscuits and I had a hard time getting them to stick together properly.  I used 2 extra tbs. milk to keep it together but it still turned out floury.  But, they did rise up quite well and the biscuits on the bottom rack rose even higher. Delicious when fresh, but I can't say the same for tomorrow.

Well...these biscuits did not in any way turn out for me! I don't know what happened, but the dough was really sticky, then when I put them in the oven they immediately began to turn black-burned on the top. I checked on them and they were rising, but when I went to get them out, all that was there was a flat mess of burned dough. I have no idea what happened since I followed the recipe. I'll probably give them another go though.

I was looking for a recipe that used oil instead of butter or shortening.  I found this one and it was good.  I failed to read the other reviews, and I wish I had added more liquid.  They were dry and bland, but tasty with margarine and maple syrup or honey.  I can see why one reader said they went well with strawberries.  I enjoyed this recipe but I will add more water to the dough next time, otherwise it is more of a scone.

Nice & simple! I  used half & half with a capful of lemon juice (I keep forgetting to get buttermilk) instead of water.  I used the same amount as the person from Kentucky did (the one in the review, I believe it was about 1/2 c, more or less. I thought they were delicious and a pretty golden color. I let them stay in for a few minutes more since I added more liquid.

Really loved these biscuits. That said, I had to add about 1/2 cup milk to get the dough to come together. 

Super easy. Next time will try with cheddar.

It turned out better than I expected/feared, considering there seems to be something wrong with the recipe. When I added the wet ingredients, it still more resembled a pile of flour than dough. Definitely not enough liquids. I added all the rest of the sour cream I had, and probably triple the water, and it still didn't fully incorporate. Got tired of fiddling with it and just forced it into balls; threw out a sizable number of crumbs. They were okay, a little chewy, not much to them in terms of flavor.

I’ve been making these for years, however I have made an adjustment that will help with flavor.  When you mix all the dry ingredients together, do it in your food processor. Then instead of water, drizzle 2 Tbsp of EVOO through the top as it’s on.  It’ll be like sand, or crumbly.  Then add your sour cream and give it another whirl til the sour cream is blended.

I had to add about another half cup sour cream and 3 tablespoons of water to make them even manageable. I have always used the allrecipe site but this is the first time I did not like the end results.

Super-easy and delicious. Will definitely make these again! They needed more water (almost twice as much) than the recipe indicated to come together.

These were delicious! I baked them today, and ate one of them with maple syrup and a little butter. I used soft whole wheat flour, but I added less than 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour  to round up to 2 cups of flour for the recipe. I did use a full cup of sour cream like one reviewer advised. In addition, I used 2 Tablespoons of water. I then mixed the dough in my bread machine.

 After putting some melted butter on top of the biscuits, and baking for the recommended time, I turned my broiler on for about 3 minutes to brown the top. 

They were good. I will be using this recipe again.

Thanks!

To admit, I was dubious when I saw sour cream biscuits on this site. But honestly, they taste just as good as regular biscuits, and they're super fluffy! If you put on butter right when they come out of the oven, it is simply divine! Easy to make and delicious!

I definitely made these too thin, whoops! But they still have that great sour cream biscuit flavor. Using full fat sour cream makes a big flavor difference, I think they're better than buttermilk biscuits. Super fast and easy.

I followed this recipe to the letter.  A basic light, fluffy biscuit. I think it could stand for experiments with flavorings or herbs to give it a boost.

I added garlic powder and used 2 % milk.  Also use regular sour cream, not low fat. When you cut with a circled sharp cutter do not turn the cutter only press down and lift up. Use a knife to carefully lift the circle onto a pan. Your biscuits will rise better this way. Very good flavor!!

I had already cut my butter into the flour prior to realizing I was out of milk.  I used self rising flour.  Then I thought about the sour cream.  I mixed in some and sprinkled in some water until it looked like the right consistency.  ( I generally don't measure when making biscuits)  I did have to increase the flour due to the stickiness.  However, these were wonderful, light and airy and delicious.  (not fat free for sure!)  I would make them again.

These were delicious & I'll definitely make the again.  They're light & fluffy just as they were supposed to be.  I think the reason some reviewers called them dense or chewy is either because they mixed them too long or more likely because they used low fat or no fat sour cream.  Biscuits need fat in order to have a fluffy consistency.  The dough is sticky but  according to the directions it should be formed, not rolled out.  The only thing I changed was to mix the sour cream & water together before adding it to the dry ingredients so it could be mixed in easier.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Light, fluffy, and holds together well so you can spread jam or whatever.  I like to brush melted butter and sprinkle a few sesame seeds on top.

First time I tried it I didn't put in enough water. The dough has to be tacky. Second time they came out fine. Not the best I've had but good. Strawberry jam and cream cheese went great with them. I'll do this again.

I made these biscuits exactly as written.  The recipe is so easy and quick. 
The biscuits  turned out perfectly, lightly crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy inside.  My dough was a little sticky and it took well floured hands to shape the biscuits;  with a little practice I might even get all of them about the same size.   This  is a keeper.   Thank you for the quick easy recipe.

Wow!  I  made these last night to go with some hearty chili.  My husband and I both loved them.  I halved the recipe as there are only two of us and added a sprinkle of dried parsley and a swish of butter after coming out of the oven.  Very moist light.  I will definitely  be making these again and again.

I don't know what happened, but these weren't sticky at all.  I needed to add milk as none were mentioned in the recipe.  I added  a good 1/2 cup milk, mixed, shaped biscuits and  baked.  They came out ok, but would not make them again.

Very good with a couple of changes. I added a TBLS of sugar, a heaping cup of sour cream and 3 TBLS of water to dry ingredients and then mixed with a pastry mixer. This made it much easier and far less messy. I also did drop biscuits for even less mess. Turned out great.

I make this quite often. I never use fat free dairy products (yuck! why bother at all?) but this recipe is exactly my standard recipe for scones! 
Yep, they are very good!

i give it a 5 on ease and speed, but have a couple of concerns...first, i ASSUME that every biscuit recipe given should make a dozen biscuits, or why bother?...am i wrong?...does this make me a bad person?...with this recipe i got 8 1/2 and a couple of those were thinner than i would normally roll out...i thought the dough ball looked a little skimpy for a dozen when i got it made, and sure enough...secondly, they didn't rise as much as i would have liked...they taste great and were a snap to make, but i would LIKE to, ideally, wind up with 12 plump units...

Not bad in a pinch! I prefer a flakier biscuit, these were quite dough-ey and chewy, but I'd ran out of  milk and only had sour cream on hand. They did the job. Thanks!

I had to add alot more water to them then it called for .  Atleast  1/4 cup water . I also added an individual  pack of stevia to them .

I have to say I tried them again later and they turned out much better . Don't know what the difference was maybe my flour was fresher ???

Really good recipe. The biscuits came out nice and perfect. The only thing I changed was I add a dash of parsley ,dried jalapeño peppers and the sharp cheddar ( the cheese part I saw from other reviewers). Will make again.

I had yet to find a biscuit recipe where the biscuits really rise. These biscuits did! Some modifications for a very low fat version: skim milk instead of water, fat free sour cream, and 1/2 tbsp of butter give the recipe about .5grams of fat per biscuit (recipe yielded 12). These were quick and easy. I will be making them ahain!

These were great! I used milk as suggested in other reviews. I also added only enough liquid to hold everything together (because others mentioned it was very sticky and hard to work with) it seemed a little stiff while I rolled it out, but they fluffed up perfectly while baking. I doubled the recipe since I like bigger biscuits and my family loved them.

I've never made homemade biscuits before and this was a wonderful recipe to start with. I use plain nonfat yogurt instead of sour cream and they still turned out perfectly. The only reason I have them four stars instead of five was because I had to double the amount of water. This recipe also only made 6 biscuits for me. Other than those minor problems, this was a lovely recipe and I will make it again!

Followed the recipe and my dough never really came together.  Added about another 1/8 to 1/4 cup of the sour cream and all was good.  Kinda dry but were tasty, and I would probably add some melted butter to them out of the oven to soften (and flavor) them up a bit.  Family liked them so would likely make them again.

I was vey disappointed.  I added 2T butter and the dough was still very dry. Ended up adding at least twice as much water to get the dough an acceptable consistency. The taste was very bland even covered in sausage gravy. I won't be making these again.

I tried this tonight with sausage gravy...they were moist and fluffy. I have tried many biscuit recipes, and this is one of the best! I did add a couple tablespoons of butter and used milk (instead of water) to moisyen the dough and cooked them on a pampered chef baking stone.

I made these last night and we just couldnt eat them. First of all, the dough was so thick that I had to keep adding water just to be able to work with it. After they were done, we tried putting butter on them, honey too. Nothing made them taste good. Wont be making these again.

So easy! And though one would assume the sour cream adds the fat, I used light sour cream and they came out great! I've also made these adding grated cheddar cheese and they tasted exactly like the ones at Red Lobster..delicious!

My sis made these for breakfast and they were delicious with the super (chicken) sausage gravy recipe from this site. We used fat free mayo instead of sour cream because we realized we didn't have any after half of the ingredients were together. The hubster said they tasted a lot better than they looked =) Simple, quick & healthy.

Yum! I'm very excited about this recipe because it is so easy and very good. I've made it twice already. The first time was as it was written, but the second time I replaced the sour cream with plain yogurt and added 1 tablespoon of white sugar. I also found that a 10 minute cooking time was just enough. The yogurt didn't make a huge difference, but my fiance and I liked them more. Thanks for the recipe!

I had to add more water and even then they weren't as good as my usual biscuits. I only made them to use some leftover sour cream but won't make them again.

These are very quick and easy.  I didn't have the stickiness problem that some others did.  Probably won't use them for a "special" sunday breakfast, but they are wonderful to put in my husbands lunch box for his breakfast at work.  When they are reheated they taste exactly the same as when they are fresh.  They don't get soggy like other biscuits can.

Very good and easy! The biscuits were  incredibly light and fluffy although I used whole wheat pastry flour. I think next time I'll use low fat sour cream to make them even healthier. They were just a little on the salty side though, so that's why I'm only giving this 4 stars. I think I'll cut down on the salt next time I make these. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I had to add a lot more water than what was called for to make a dough.  They came out tasty, but small and not as fluffy as I would have liked.  Still, they held up well to being used for sausage sandwiches.

As noted by other reviewers, I also needed to add additional water, other than that recipe is good as written. I added some green onions to mine and next time I think I'll add some cheese. Nice fast recipe!

Very good for a healthy biscuit.  I had a cup of fat free sour cream that had ranch seasoning mixed in that I needed to use up and it gave a lot of flavor to the biscuits.  I also added some shredded cheddar cheese.  They went well with the Potato Soup X recipe on this website.  My husband loved them!

I really don't like to give any recipe a bum rap but I never had a rubber biscuit before until I made and tried to eat these.  I've been making biscuits for years and have never had any problems but this recipe simply does not work.  Sorry.

Very easy, simple, and good.  My 6 year old son helped make these. 
I will keep this recipe.

This recipe was ok...not what I was expecting.  I am still searching for the perfect biscuit recipe!  The biscuits were good though, with sausage gravy on them!
