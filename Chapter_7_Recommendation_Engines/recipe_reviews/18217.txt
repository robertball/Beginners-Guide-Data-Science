This is VERY close to a recipe I used to make and have been searching for-- with the following changes:  1) instead of cooking fresh onion, dried chopped onion can be substituted (the liquids in the dish will reconstitue it,)  2) instead of cream of mush, use cream of celery soup, 3) lose all that salt and just use a little garlic powder, plus a dash or two of worcestershire instead of the lemon juice, and, 4) top with crushed cheez-its instead of Ritz-- the extra cheddar crunch gives the entire dish a great zing  (go crazy-- tabasco cheez-its are expecially good.)  No need to top with butter, the topping will brown nicely enough.  You can adjust the fat content by eliminating the butter and using low-fat soup.  I also use the canola Hellman's with no cholesterol.  Ditching the salt brings the sodium content down to next-to-nothing, even with the modicum of worcestershire. When all is said and done, what you're really making here is a custard-- that's why you mix the soup, eggs, and mayo together and then fold in the broccoli and the cheese.  It should never be runny.  The entire casserole can be assembled the day before and refrigerated, then the topping added right before cooking. Enjoy!

We loved this casserole.  I used two cups of fresh broccoli instead of frozen and added an 8 oz package of mushrooms that I needed to get rid of.  I used half light mayo and half low fat sour cream and Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom soup.  I also used light cheese to lower the fat.  

The casserole was wonderful and my fiance ended up eating seconds.  I even got my four year old to try it although she decided she still doesn't like broccoli.  I will make again for sure as we really enjoyed this.

This turned out just like I wanted.  I did make a few changes, but don't we all!  I used the 98% fat free cream of chicken instead of mushroom due to personal preference, but other things I did made this side dish 13g of fat/serving instead of the 40g that the recipe results in.  I used 3/4 c. light mayo (if you only make one change, make it this one!), 3/4 c. 2% milk Cheddar cheese, reduced fat crackers, 1 T olive oil for the onions, and sprayed the top of the casserole with Pam instead of using butter.  Came out tasting just like my grandmother's, and I know she doesn't use low-fat anything!

This is my all time favorite comfort food! The only changes I made, were to use Egg Beaters, reduced fat cheddar cheese, reduced fat or fat free mayo, reduced fat Ritz and fat free cream of mushroom soup.  Since this is such a flavorful recipe, you really cannot tell the difference at all.  We did a side by side taste comparison – no difference.  Too much time on our hands I guess, but we saved a bunch of fat and calories!

Sorry, but this was just awful. Followed the recipe exactly and used decent brands (Campbells soup, Hellman's mayo, Ritz crackers etc) but the topping was horribly soggy and the casserole tasted really artificial. Won't be making again.

This is a favorite at my house.  I made it one time for a family get-together and then received a special request to make it again at Thanksgiving.

Sorry, but this was really yucky.  Way too much mayo.  I ended up throwing it all out.  I will never make this again.

I didn't like this too much. When I think of broccoli casserole, I assume it will have a cheese flavor to it. This had way too much mayonaise for me and i love mayonaise. Everyone said it was pretty good, but I won't make it again. It did look nice.

This has become a family favorite - something I am requested to make at every event/holiday.  Modificaitons: reduce mayo to 1/2 c (light mayo) & add 1/2 c light sour cream, cream of celery soup, 1/4t celery salt, garlic powder to taste. I use almost 2 cups of mixed sharp & mild cheddar cheeses. I also add 10 oz frozen chopped spinach (defrosted). Essentially, this dish can handle 20-36oz of any veggies you've got if your casserole dish is big enough. Top with any flavor CheeseNips (made with real cheese & butter topping not needed ) OR crushed stuffing mix (top with butter)  I find it takes closer to an hour to bake, cover with foil for the first 30-40 min & the topping does better.  Enjoy!

This was yummy!  It has a very rich flavor and the crackers on top are the perfect touch.  I put all the ingredients together the night before, refrigerated, and then popped in the oven the next day and it was perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very tasty! I used fresh broccoli, skipped the salt and used garlic and onion powders, (soup has enough salt on its' own) and to add a little crunch I topped the casserole with canned fried onions. Seven out of the nine kids who were here absolutely loved this dish. Thanks Laura!

I have tried a very similar recipe and it is a family favorite! I leave out the seasoning salt and use Pepperidge farms herb seasoned stuffing mix for the topping. Mix 2 cups of stuffing mix with 1/2 stick melted butter and sprinkle on top. I also don't mix in the cheese but I sprinkle it on top of the unbaked casserole before putting the stuffing mix on top. I use fresh broccoli cooked until crisp tender instead of frozen broccoli. This dish is absolutely amazing!

I was disappointed with the recipe... I guess it depends on one's taste but If you are not a big fan of mayo flavor in hot food this is definitely not a recipe for you. I wasn't sure when I saw the recipe called for a cup of mayonnaise but I still used it! I should have followed my gut! It all tasted like mayo! You couldn't even tell there was any cream of mushroom, garlic or onions.... even the cheese flavor didn't compete with the mayo. Hubby did not like it either. I might make it again and use sour cream and more mushroom cream or something else instead of mayo.

I used fresh broccoli and cauliflower, decreased the amount of mayo to 1/2 cup, added 1/3 cup sour cream, bacon bits and shredded rotisserie chicken. Great recipe.

*and then followed the recipe*

Well, my search for a broccoli casserole I love goes on. This was okay but, too me, not as creamy as I would like. I did like the combination of seasonings though.

The only thing I've ever missed about my ex-husband  is his broccoli casserole recipe -- and I think this is the same one! The only things I changed that were in his original recipe are: 1) chopped steamed fresh broccoli instead of frozen, 2) cream of celery rather than cream of mushroom soup, and 3) only 2 heaping tablespoons of Hellmann's Light mayo. I probably used closer to 2 cups of shredded cheddar, though I only guessed the amount, and I omitted the garlic salt. Back in the day I used to take broccoli casserole to every potluck and got rave reviews; now this recipe is every bit as good.

Very good the whole thing was eaten. Used 1/2 cup of mayo like others suggested. And French fried onion did not top the onions with butter. This is a keeper for sure.

I made this to take to Easter dinner at a friend's.  I'd been working like crazy, so I used what I had in the house so I didn't have to go shopping.  I used fresh broccoli instead of the frozen; shredded colby jack cheese instead of the cheddar, eliminated the canned soup and threw in some sour cream.  Plus I forgot the eggs altogether!  But it came out sooooo yummy!  There was hardly any left to take home!

Made this recipe with a few variations, and my family loved it. My variations: I used a 1/2 cup of mayo instead of a full cup, nearly doubled the amount of cheese, and used two cups of fresh broccoli instead of frozen. I also cubed and cooked a skinless chicken breast beforehand and added it. It was filling and delicious!

I've been making this for years.  It is a Heildleburg, Germany Officers' Club recipe.  The only thing different which is very good is add with the mayo one heaping tablespoon of pure horseradish.  You'll love it.  Making it tonight with Prime Rib.  Yummy  One more thing my family prefers french onion rings on top instead of crackers.   This casserole is make many times a year, always with a special meal.  My kids live away now but always ask for the brocolli casserole when they come hom.

Yummy, just like Mom used to make. I didn't have any lemons on hand but it tasted great without it. The only other change is that I melted the butter & mixed it with the ritz crumbs and sprinkled over the casserole. Otherwise, made exactly as written and my family loved it.

I made this recipe as directed except I used two 14 oz. pkgs. of frozen baby broccoli florets.  It was super good and I couldn't help but keep going back for more!  I can't wait to make it for my granddaughter who seems to love the veggie casseroles that I make.  A definite keeper!  Thanks for sharing, Laura!

This got good reviews by my guests, but I would change a couple things next time around.  I would use lots less mayo and add more cracker topping.

I used fat free sour cream instead of mayo, I used garli powder instead of garlic salt, and I used reduced sodium soup.  This recipe turned out very creamy and delicous.  I will definitely make again.

The first compliment I've gotten from my picky bro in law. He couldn't stop raving. This is the best recipe I've found on this site to date. Hellmans mayo is the only mayo that seems to really thicken it up. I've tried others and they just don't work as well. Unbelievable taste.

This was great! I never follow recipes exactly, it's just not in me to do so :-) sometimes I regret it!!
My bags of broccoli were 16 oz rather than the 10 oz pkgs in the recipe, so I adjusted it for that. I used 2 cups of mozarella, with one half of that on the top, I also added 2 cups mayo and an 8 oz block of cream cheese. I omitted the garlic salt and added about 4Tb of chopped garlic, 2 T of onion powder for the onion,  and about a quarter Tb of Cavender's. 
My WHOLE family loved it. Delicious and low carb to boot! Thanks Laura!

I made this for Easter dinner and it was very close to a family recipe that I was looking for.  I will use low sodium cream of mushroom soup and may eliminate the garlic salt.  My kids loved it, but I thought it was a tad too salty.

Fantastic recipe!  My entire family loved it, hubby went back for 2nds.  The only change I made was used 2/3 mayo instead of the full amount.  Thanks so much for the recipe, I will make this again and again.

Excellent Recipe!  I don't like to use canned soup very often and usually substitute with a roux but for this recipe I substituted 8 oz. sour cream and 1/4 cup milk for the canned soup.  It turned out wonderfully.

I thought this was good, but very similar to a lot of other recipes I've tried.  I made a 1/2 recipe and used fresh broccoli instead of frozen.

I did not brown the onion in butter  -just cut it up real fine, and did not use buttery crackers and butter on top. Otherwise I Made exactly as recipe stated but used Fresh Broccoli not frozen - This was terrible !! Way Way to salty - seasoned salt - garlic salt - plus salt in the soup. YUCK !!!! If anyone is trying this recipe I would strongly suggest not adding any the salt called for in the recipe. I will NOT be making this again and would NOT recomend it to anybody.

I chose this recipe because it uses sharp cheddar--my husband hates processed cheese. I used low fat cream of mushroom soup, reduced fat mayonnaise, and omitted the seasoning salt. It was delicious and was just salty enough.

This is a great alternative to green bean casserole (as much as I love it, I do get tired of it).

This was a very yummy casserole!  I used fresh broccoli and added it to the mixture raw.  After it cooked the alotted time, the broccoli was very crisp and had a lot of flavor!  I think with all the other heavy ingredients, something fresh is a welcome thing!  The only thing that I didn't like was the saltiness that comes mainly from the concentrated soup.  Other than that, I have no problems making this again and again!

This was tasty.   I used fresh steamed broccoli instead of frozen, substituted worchestershire for the lemon juice and put Italian seasoned panko bread crumps on top because those are what I had in the pantry.  A great side for any night.  I'm sure the addition of chicken would make this a filling main dish also.

Exactly the flavors I was looking for. Very cheesy and delicious! I did follow the recipe with changes suggested by reviewers, namely, using cream of celery soup instead of mushroom, and i used worcestershire sauce, cutting the seasoned salt and lemon juice.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner.  Its absolutely a go-to recipe for me now.  Its SUPER easy and very delicious. Everyone loved it!  The only thing I did differently was leave out the garlic salt.  Some of family aren't big garlic lovers and can spot it a mile away, so for their sake I left it out.   Will add next time.  Also, this recipe is very easy to eyeball and add ingredients according to taste.  My *ONLY* complaint is that it was just a bit eggy, like a quiche.  I HATE eggs any other way but boiled, so it bothered me a little, but I quickly got over it.  Great recipe!

Of course I tweaked the recipe, adding 1 cup cream instead of mayo, 2 fresh broccoli heads (well-chopped) and 2/3 cup uncooked rice, 3 dashes of cayenne pepper in the mix with Pepper Jack Cheezits crushed on top. Cooked it at 350 for closer to an hour (Make sure to chop your broccoli finer than I did the first time!). Tasted similar to Cheddars broccoli rice casserole!

I had unexpected guests this Easter so I prepared this with 4 boxes of frozen broccoli and 2 cups of cheese.  Even though these were the only two changes I made , the dominant flavor of this dish was still the mayo.  I'm looking forward to making this again with less mayonnaise or perhaps a mayonnaise and sour cream blend.  Also, I felt that preparing this with only two 10oz. packages of broccoli the casserole would have been way too saucy/soupy.  Thank you for sharing and I will try again with less mayo.

I made this for Thanksgiving, but I totally goofed! I didn't realize until I was serving it that I forgot to add the cream of mushroom soup!! BUT, honestly, it was still soooo yummy. Without the soup the texture and flavor of the dish was different than intended, but it was so good I'm not sure that I would even use the soup the next time. Maybe just some more cheese.

Made this for Christmas.  I used fresh broccoli crowns and steamed them until just tender.  I used Mircle Whip because that it what I use.  I also added Worcestershire sauce instead of the lemon juice as someone suggested.  I also used a sleeve of the ritz crackers as 12 didn't seem to cover the top.  I LOVE this casserole.  Even my mom took home a few servings for leftovers!

This is a great recipe.  I made it for Christmas for a family dinner I hosted and everyone loved it.  I use Lipton Onion soup mix instead of onions (then I leave out the salt from the recipe).  I used Pepperidge farm stuffing mix instead of crackers and everyone loves it.  It's now a special request for our Mother's Day dinner and fairly easy to make.

I used fresh garlic and sea salt in place of the garlic salt. I also added some silvered almonds for a little crunch.  Turned out great.

My husband wanted me to make a broccoli casserole like his mother used to make, but I had never made one without rice. This recipe was very tasty. I didnt have grated SHARP chedder so I used mild. I also used Light butter and reduced-fat ritz crackers. Will prepare again and again for sure.

This was an incredible recipe.  I didn't use the onions as my hubby despises them, but I bet they would have been a good addition.  The only thing that I did differently was to use 2 cups of Sharp Cheddar mixed in.  I also added about 1/4 cup milk or a little less to the mixture and used half brocolli and half cauliflower.  It was excellent.  It took 45 minutes in the oven to be perfect!  I couldn't stop eating it.  My hubby, myself and my 2 year old ate half of the casserole.  Delicious!!

Healthier edits to this meal: cut down on the butter, use just enough to saute the onion to avoid burning it.  Also added some fresh garlic to the onions to saute.  Use half the amount of mayo (use light), maybe a tbsp of sour cream.  I love mushrooms so I added a cup of that and less broccoli.  Someone gave the idea of adding chicken to make it a full meal which was genius in my opinion.  Use reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup and cut out the seasoned salt completely. Garlic salt should be enough to get you by.

This is an old favorite (one of hubby's most requested!).  I do make it a little differently using low fat subs for the soup, mayo, & cheese.  I omit the eggs entirely and use 1 can broccoli soup and 1 can mushroom.  I add cooked rice to the mix (thus the extra can of soup) and usually some cooked, cut up chicken to make it a meal. But it is really forgiving, and changing the soups, cheese, even the veggies, changes the flavors.  It is easy, can be made ahead & frozen, and like someone else said, "comfort food".

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner because I hate that green bean casserole recipe.....this was way better than expected, delicious....even my 6 mo. old g.grandson loved it...(he just got 2 teeth). I will certainly make this again. The only change I made was lower fat soup, and I used Panko crumbs on top (only because time was running out and wanted to get it in the oven faster.)

This casserole turned out great. I used all organic ingredients, skipped the chopped onion and used about a tablespoon of dry onion soup mix for extra flavor.   I made this dish a second time and used cheddar broccoli soup instead...delicious as well!

This casserole was the best thing ever!  I don't like cooked broccoli, but I could not get enough of this stuff.  My husband hates mayonnaise and will not eat anything with it if he knows it is in a dish.  He couldn't get enough of this dish either---he thought it was great.  My father-in-law came over to eat with us and wanted the recipe, too!  (I told him he couldn't tell my husband the ingredients if I gave it to him --haha!)  He said that it was divine!  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.  Although, I did not have seasoning salt or galic salt, but I had garlic pepper and substituted it for both!

I really wanted to like this but it was just too mayonaise-y.  I will probably give this another go but with half the mayo the recipe calls for.

To lower the fat, I used 2 tbsp of low fat mayo & low fat cream of mushroom soup. Sauteed red onion in olive oil instead of butter. Used fresh broccoli & threw in 2 stalks of chopped celery. Absolutely delicious! Very very tasty. Thanks for sharing this recipe

My family really liked this recipe; very creamy and buttery flavor.  I recommend decreasing the amount of garlic salt and seasoned salt to 1/4 tsp (instead of 1/2 tsp) since it was a bit salty for our taste.  Also cooking time was closer to 50-55 minutes.  Overall we really liked this and plan on making it as a Thanksgiving side.

here's what i did: i used 10 oz frozen spinach, 16 oz frozen cauliflower, small can mushrooms (it's what i had on hand).  i took the advice here and did not add any salt.  I used garlic from the jar and some garlic powder.  about 2 c. Cheese.  Every one said the original recipe called for too much mayo, so i altered that by using 1/2 c. mayo mixed with 1/2 c. yogurt.  I used crushed goldfish crackers.  I added the chopped onion without sautaying it. 
Here's what i think of what i did: Definitely good advice to cut the salt.  Don't used canned mushrooms. The cauliflower is okay, the spinach is good.  Definitely go with the broccoli.  Adding the onions without frying in butter is good.  The mayo/yogurt works very well!  Cheese is good amount.  I could have added more goldfish crackers, don't skimp on those; about ½ a bag is good.  Mine came out not soggy, fairly firm, with alot of veggies, which is what i like.  Not bad!  Next time i will definitely use broccoli.

It sounded like the broccoli casserole that I've had in the past that I just love, but I would cut back the mayo by at least half.  I thought it over-powered all the other ingredients.  I'll defnately make agan, but I will start off with only 1/4 cup of mayo.  i aso used crused potatoe chips on top instead of crackers.

Outrageous! As other reviewers suggested, use 1/2 the mayo (consider using light).  Also, use fresh broccoli if possible.

This was sooo spectacular, a huge hit at dinner! I will make this easy dish all the time.

My husband and I really enjoyed this side dish.  My changes: I reduced the mayo to 1/2 c (calories!), I used 1 package of frozen chopped broccoli and 1 package of broccoli florets, and again due to calories, I left off the cracker & butter topping. To be honest, if I was serving this for company I would probably use the cracker topping I missed that. But I would still keep the mayo at a 1/2 cup, you did not even notice the reduction.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is just soooo good I cant wait to make it again.  I ran out of majonaise and had to improvise: an egg yoke, oil and a splash of vinigar.  Yummy!!!  I also add about 20% more cheese than advised.  So good:)

This casserole is awesome. I used broccoli cheese soup instead of the cream of mushroom and added additional cheese on top instead of the crumbs. I will indeed make this again.

Absolutely fantastic recipe!  Like some readers suggested, I cut the mayo to 3/4 cup, and because we can't get enough cheese, added a little extra (shredded velveeta).  For the topping, I used buttered Cheez-It cracker crumbs for ever more cheese flavor.  Thanks for this one!

This was excellent!  I made for Thanksgiving and took to work and it was devoured!  I followed the recipe except I used low fat cream of mushroom soup and no fat mayo.  Still tasted great.

Great recipe!  I changed it a little. I scaled it down to serve 4 and instead of 1/2 cup of mayo, I used the whole can of cream of mushroom soup and 2 heaping Tbsp of mayo, plus a cup of shredded cheddar cheese instead of 1/2 cup and I used petitte broccoli florets instead of the chopped broccoli (a whole 16 ounce package, thawed). I also used more crackers than called for (12 instead of 6)Yummy!

This is a good, creamy, kid-friendly recipe.  I only wanted to make half the recipe, so insted of being left with 1/2 a can of cream of mushroom soup, I used that in place of the mayo. I also used bread crumbs with butter becasue I did not have the crackers.  It turned out just great.  Thanks!

This recipe is delicious!! I omitted the lemon juice because I didn't have any. I also did not have any buttery round crackers so I crushed up some fat-free caesar crouton , I'm sure any of them would've been fine. the recipe came out great even with my substitutions. Oh and I added a little more cheese ...just because I love it! This one's a keeper thank you so much!

I used less butter and used light mayonanise, which worked just as well.  We love this recipe!  I took it to a dinner party, and wow was it a success.  I wasn't even able to bring any leftovers home!

Used this recipe many times,  very IMPORTANT, don't leave out the onion or the lemon juice. Makes a world of difference.  People say they don't like broccoli or ask what is it, but there are never any leftovers.

This recipe is a winner. I make it at least once a month and is always a request from family and friends. I make it as is, no changes needed, although I do use a very good extra sharp cheddar cheese! Yummy!

I made two for Easter dinner. One with half the mayo and half sour cream as suggested and one just exactly like the recipe. I used fresh grated real white cheddar. They both were almost identical and no one could tell the difference in the two.

Truly Amazing! Made a few adjustments. I used half a cup of mayo, sautéed mushroom with the onions, used fresh broccoli, and only had block parmesan cheese and white cheddar. I also used cream of chicken/mushroom soup. I also sprayed the top with olive oil and used club crackers and grated parmesan for the topping.

My Aunt made this for every Thanksgiving growing up. I made some changes because I wanted this to be more of a main dish. I used half the broccoli and added 2 cooked and diced chicken breast. I cut the mayo in half and used(light mayo). I added half a cup of low fat sour cream. Husband hates cream of mushroom so I substituted cream of broccoli. I skipped the salt and used regular garlic powder . For the topping I crushed some left over seasoned croutons and they browned beautifully and added flavor. I also added some about half a cup of instant rice. I will probably play around with the proportions on it some more. It was a hit my husband and family loved it. It was very easy to make into a family favorite main course.

This was absolutely HORRIBLE.

I like mayonnaise as much as the next person, but this was just too much! It tasted like just eating spoonfuls of mayonnaise; blech.

I would reduce it to a quarter cup or less of mayonnaise.

This rendition of broccoli casserole is what I have been searching for.  I tried others, but the addition of the egg gave it the consistency I wanted - not runny!  Instead of dotting with butter over the topping, I sprayed a little olive oil.  The hubby gave it good reviews, and he doesn't like cooked broccoli!  Vegetarianism can be difficult, but with recipes like this we stay very happy :)!

The taste was a little off with the cream of mushroom soup. Next time I will try the cream of celery like other users suggested.

Did not use any butter, only used half cup of mayo, and eliminated one egg.  Also used less of the salts and subbed panko for crackers.  Still turned out really good.  Tasted like a similar broccoli, rice, cheese casserole that is made with cheese whiz but I think this is better.  Seems healthier also, especially after making the above changes.

Really good casserole, the sauce is plenty salty so don't add any or you will have too much.

I have made this now 2 times since I saved the recipe...it's delicious!  I made it for Thanksgiving dinner, and it was then requested again for Christmas dinner!  It was a hit both times!  It's definitely a great new spin on broccoli and cheese!

This was wonderful, I was skeptical using mayo, but I was pleasantly suprised.  My husband (who hates broccoli) tried it to humor me.  He had a large second helping, go figure.

We loved this casserole! I made it in place of the traditional green bean casserole, which was getting old quick. I think the key factor that makes this extra yummy is the sauteed onions in the beginning.

it was good.  Broccoli didnt get tender and the sauce was a bit too thick for me. 2 eggs prolly made it thick.  Maybe ill take away an egg.  It definitly needed more cheese. next time ill add  alittle milk to make it saucy and add more cheese.  Chicken also sounds good with this one.

Used only about a half cup mayonnaise and added a few extra crackers to the topping other than that is was followed to the tee. We loved it. Family members who typically do not eat broccoli really liked this.

This dish is quite yummy!! Prepared as is, it's a great side dish.  We prepare this as a meal by adding 1C cooked white rice & 1-1/2C finely diced ham.  All my kids love it and there's never any leftovers.

Delicious! I used fresh broccoli, minced garlic instead of garlic salt, ½ cup of mayonnaise instead of 1 cup, and skipped the seasoning salt and topping. As other reviewers mentioned, use lowfat cheese, mayo, and soup to reduce the fat. Great cheesy taste.  Even my 9 year old grandson had seconds. Will be making this again. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This is a decent recipe, but I tweaked it a bit. First use fresh broccoli, instead of frozen. I added about a cup of baby portobello mushrooms for added flavor and texture. Skip the lemon juice and instead add a 1/2-1 tbs of fresh sage. I also used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  A tip: I try and use organic everything, but organic cream of mushroom soup in this is horrible idea. It came out runny and disgusting, the good old campbell's soup is the way to go.

I wish I could give this 3 1/2 stars, It wasn't too bad I did cut back on the butter a little and used fresh broccoli.  But all in all a pretty good way to serve broccoli.   I think next time I would mix the crumbs in with melted butter before putting it on top of the dish so that it would have a little more crunch.

This may not be the most appealing to the eye but it was definitely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly with no problems at all. Oh wait, i did use fresh broccoli instead of frozen which i highly recommend. The broccoli was perfectly cooked.Will make this again.

Wonderful dish!!!  Very versatile. I had a bunch of leftover broccoli, as well as brussel sprouts and zuccini and I was looking to use them all up before they went bad.  Only had cream of chicken so I added a can of mushrooms to it.  Added more crackers on top.  Delish!  My family loved it but I didn't have too much because of the fat content.  In the future I will try using all lower fat ingredients.  As someone else tried.. I will see how it is with nonfat sour cream.  Thanks for the recipe Laura!!

I'm a big fan of green bean casserole so I was hoping this would be a broccoli version. Not so much. This was kind of "gloopy".  Too much soup and mayo.  I don't think I'll make this again...sorry. :(

Pretty good recipe.  I used cream of mushroom, cream of celery and condensed cheddar soup...made enough for 20 people.  I also added cooked rice and sprinkled the top with bread crumbs.

I made this recipe for an office holiday dinner and it was REALLY good!  The only change I made was that I used broccoli florets instead of chopped broccoli.  I also used more cheese than the recipe called for! (I always use more cheese than recipes call for!)  Also I up scaled the size to serve 20!  The dish came out perfectly- not too dry but bot runny!  The only other change I will make next time is to NOT saute the onions prior to adding.  I think it needed a little more onion flavor (but I LOVE onion) and maybe a little crunch!  Might even dice some water chestnuts in it next time!

OMG!!! This is amazing. I absolutely loved this recipe. The only adjustment that I made was to use 1/2 the amount of mayo. But this was absolutely stunning.

My family has made this type of casserole for years. There is no need to add any of the extra salts because there is quite a bit in the cheese and mushroom soup. We use fresh broccoli and cauliflower and steam it just a bit. We also use croutons instead of crackers, which gives the top a crunchier texture.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. The only thing I did different was the cracker topping, mostly in response to another review saying their turnout was soggy. To prevent that I used almost one whole Ritz cracker tube, crushed, over the top. The dish turned out excellent, I will definitely do this again.

Yes!  This is what I've been looking for.  I use fresh broccoli instead of frozen and I omit all the butter.  I do not like it when the broccoli "swims" in sauce, so I use plenty of broccoli to avoid this situation.  I like this recipe better than others because the cream of mushroom flavor is not so strong and you don't have to mix the soup, cheese, etc. in a separate sauce pan, just throw it in the casserole dish.

This is an awesome 'base' recipe; I made some changes out of necessity and some out of personal preference.  Before even starting, I wasn't sure about the garlic salt (fresh garlic,minced, instead) or the seasoned salt (sounded kind of salty & ick, so I omitted).  I didn't have lemon juice.  I had cream of chicken on hand and I had a can of sliced mushrooms on hand, so I used those instead of crm of mushroom soup.  I used double the amount of cheese (we like a little broccoli with our cheese :).  With all that said and done, this was SO GOOD.  My 10 year old loved it.  I'm gonna use left over ham (cubed) and make again. BTW//I HATE mayo, but you cannot taste mayo in this.

Cheesy and delicious! This was just as good as I remeber it being as a kid. I added an extra sprinkle of cheese and it came out perfectly, my two picky toddlers even enjoyed it. Next time I might add a cup of rice to the mix, I think it also would taste good topped with fried onions instead of the crackers.  I will be making this again!

I modified it a bit- I used 1/2 broccoli and 1/2 cauliflower, and this was an excellent modification.  I also added about 1/3 tsp of curry powder, and it gave a really nice flavour.

Wow was this a hit yesterday at Thanksgiving.  I made a few changes.
1. I used fat free cream of chicken soup.
2. Used light mayo
3. I used unsalted butter and added about 1-1 1/2 teaspoons of fresh minced garlic to the onion when sauteing.
4. I used about 50% more broccoli.
5. I used half the garlic salt.
6. I mixed in 3/4 of the cheese to the mixture and sprinkled 1/4 on top.
7. I sprayed the crackers with butter flavored non-stick spray instead of using butter.

Kept it pretty much the same while decreasing the fat and increasing the garlic flavor.  It was the only thing totally gone at dinner!

I tried this recipe on my Grandma, but since she has trouble chewing broccoli, I had to cook the broccoli a little longer which made the casserole soft and mushy. But in a good way! It has a surprising flavor and is very good! I also improvised and used saltine crackers on top which work just as well.

I make this for every holiday! You can skip the butter to cut back. I also use the Classic Melts shredded cheese from Kraft(4 types of cheeses). Also you can make with 1 tablespoon of Nature Seasoning if you are too lazy like me to measure the salt and so forth. EASY and always a hit!

I followed the instructions and found this recipe to be on the bland side and the texture was worse. The mayo never really blended in and left a chunky texture.

When I asked my husband if he liked this he dodged me twice, saying something random about the day, so I cornered him by asking "Do you want me to make this again?" and he said, "Oh Lord no,please never again!"  I asked if it was the taste or the texture and he said, both.  When I asked my son (he is four) he looked as if he didn't want to hurt my feelings, but still said "no".  To be fair I don't normally cook this way, I tried this recipe on a whim.  In my opinion this is something you might see and avoid at a potluck.  Sorry, that is just my opinion.

A winner! My family loved it. I split up the recipe and omitted the crackers and froze half of it. I just defrosted it and added the cracker crumbs, and baked at 350 for the required time, and it was equally as wonderful as if i had just put it together!

This recipe was pretty good, but I tweaked it a bit.  First, I make the recipe for 4 servings, so I used a whole can of cream of mushroom soup instead of the mayo.  Second, I added about twice as many crackers on top as it asked for.  That way, you can get a good thin layer of crunchiness on top.  Next time I will dice my onions much smaller, because I don't like the texture of them in this casserole.

I made this for a teacher appreciation luncheon and had everyone rave about it and want the recipe!
I did not even get to taste it! lol 
So, Iam making it again for Thanksgiving. I added the whole pack of cheddar cheese(2 cups), and sprinkled about 1/2-1 cup of crushed stuffing bread crumbs on top, and left out the onion just in case someone didnt care for them. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is awesome! Although, the second time around I used bread crumbs instead of crackers, and 1 egg is just plenty. Also I left out the lemon juice. Delicious! I make this every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas as a side item! Yummmmm! I often serve it w/ slow cooked corned beef, which compliments it very well.

This recipe is really good. The only things I've changed were I omitted onions (my husband doesn't like them), used fresh broccoli instead of frozen, used more cheese (2 cups) and added cooked pasta to make it a main dish instead of a side. Amazing! Next time I will try it with cream of celery soup - cream of mushroom is not my favorite.

This is my family's all time favorite side dish during the holidays. it just isn't christmas dinner without the broccoli casserole. I use velveeta cheese instead of regular cheddar cheese because it melts so much better.

After making this dish by the recipe I began adding ham or chicken to use as a one dish meal for dinner.  I just brown the chicken before adding and the family loves it.  I have changed it to half sour cream and half mayo at times because the mayo flavor is very strong to me.

this recipe is so yummy! my whole family loves it! I like to add shredded cooked chicken to this and then its the main dish! Also I don't bother to cook the onion.......I find it easier and perhaps even more flavorful. I like to use spiced breadcrumbs for the topping too!
enjoy!

I made this dish yesterday.  I added two cups of cheese, one being fat free cheddar. In addition, I added 1 1/4 cups of cooked whole grain rice. I also used fat free cream of mushroom soup. I topped the casserole off with French's Fried Onions instead of the crushed crackers. It turned out Great!

I make this casserole for freezer meals ahead of time or family functions and it is always a favorite. I am not a stickler for exact recipe amounts. I use less mayo and butter but add sour cream and more cheese and change to another type of cream soup. I have used fresh and frozen broccoli, but cook both first before combining ingredients. This basic recipe with your own personal changes will be sure this comes out perfect for your family. Thanks for posting!

Excellent recipe! I did change a few things as suggested: half mayo and half sour cream. I also had a little ricotta cheese left in the fridge, so I threw that in too. Used Amy's organic cream of mushroom soup. It was super delish!! I will for sure make this again.

This casserole is a hit. I made it exactly as written and found no problem with it. Nay-sayers probably need to learn how to handle food and go back to basics and stay off the vino.

I really had to cut the mayo way down! 1/3 cup light mayo is enough, truly! 
I had only 13 oz fresh, blanched broccoli and stems, so I added a 15 oz can of sliced green beans, drained.
I used garlic powder and about 1/3 tsp seasoned salt as there was enough sodium as it was.
Next time, I will also reduce the butter in the topping. 
I apologize for making all these changes, but it was necessary. Thank you for such a nice recipe that we can play with a little!

I made this exactly as the recipe states for Thanksgiving dinner.  We loved it.  The leftovers are already gone.  It was a great side dish to replace boring green bean casserole.

This is the broccoli casserole I ate as a youth, and maybe this is why I find this to be the best recipe ever for it!  Many others use cheese spread or a variation of cheeses, but cheddar is best...preferably sharp.  The only thing I feel could be left out without compromising the taste is the lemon juice...I've never noticed it with or without.  Growing up in the South, this was a staple at not just Sunday dinner or holiday meals, but as an every night side dish.  I have also tried different toppings other than Ritz crackers to see if it made a difference in taste.  It does, Ritz is by far the cracker of choice to top off the casserole.  This is even better the next day!

I loved this recipe. I adjusted the amount because there are only 2 of us, but it was really good. I used more butter for the cracker topping because it seemed too dry. I think it was because I adjusted the amount. I have passed this recipe on to my sister. I think this is a new favorite.

This dish is an absolute must-have for the holidays!!

I have been making this dish for about 6 years now for Thanksgiving and Christmas, and all members of my family (young and old) continue to request it.  

One delightful addition to note: I add cheddar onions and a little more shredded cheese to the topping.

Enjoying a few rounds of Wii Fit with the family before or after dinner helps to justify indulging in this one. ;o)

This was so-so, probably something I won't end up making again. I did substitute 1/2 cup of the mayo for sour cream, as I know a full cup of mayonnaise would have been too much for my taste. The sauteed onions gave it a nice flavor, I sauteed them in olive oil not butter. I topped with my own Italian-style bread crumbs. The texture of the casserole itself was not what I was hoping for or what I'm used to, it wasn't firm enough; though it wasn't runny either. It had the perfect amount of broccoli though I added 1/2 cup peas to the mixture. I'll have to think on this one before trying again.

This is always a crowd pleaser!  I used to make this years ago but misplaced the recipe.  How happy I was to find it again!   THANK YOU!  Occassionally I will add 1 cup cooked rice and about a cup diced chicken to this casserole for a complete dinner. My family just loves it!

This is a GREAT way to make broccoli.  I did make a couple changes, but very small ones.  I used cream of mushroom/chicken soup, 1 tsp of garlic powder (not salt) and omitted the season salt.  It was plenty salty, and I LOVE salt!  Also, I used fresh broccoli.  I didn't steam it ahead of time, so it was a bit crunchy.  I would recommend steaming it a bit if you don't like crunchy broccoli.  ENJOY!!

This recipe was "ok", loved the concept, just didn't give me that "WOW" feeling.  I think I will use 1/2 cup of Mayo and 1/2 cup more cheese next time.  Seemed to me that the mayo taste was very over powering in this recipe.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Pretty much halved recipe.  Used about 2-3 good bunches of fresh broccoli.  Put crushed potato chips on top.  May need some milk added if it gets too dry.

this was easy enough but came out mushy and with not the best taste.  Kind of pasty.  followed directions carefully.  Might try again and change a bit.  thanks though.

Yum!!  I had some left over italian sausage to use up so I chopped that and threw that into the casserole.  This really came out great, I used fresh broccoli and only half cup of mayo, which seemed like a good amount.

This was excellent. I made it for Easter supper and everybody loved it and wanted to have the recipe.I split the broccoli with cauliflower for something different. I also used fresh vegetables, instead of frozen, and reduced the egg to just one instead of two. I would make it over and over again. Really yummy.

I made this dish according to the recipe.  I did not omit or add any ingredient.  It would have been good but it was rather salty. The soup is salty and then there are additional salts plus the crackers which also have salt. I will make again but I'd omit one of the salts.

This was good!  I did everything exact but had to add some garlic, because I would drink garlic if I could. :) the only thing I would have done differently was add more cheese, because, again, I would drink cheese if I could. Thanks!

Very good recipe...great for a side dish at a potluck.  I used 26 oz of frozen broccoli (still frozen), no butter (only olive oil), 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 cup light mayo, and reduced fat cheese.  I have to lighten recipes whenever I can.  I brought it to a 4th of July potluck dinner and everyone loved it.  Thanks for the easy potluck recipe.

P5rett6y good, but I cut it i9n half and used cheezit crackers not ritz crackers.  I added all the soup instead of half a can because it looked so small.  I should not have - made it too salty.  I also used half an onion (becaase I cut t he recipein half) but my onions are huge, so I should have used a little less.  Will make again.  Becuase the soup is so salty, I may use garlic powder and not garlic salt next time.

Sorry, as much as my husband liked it (it was something he grew up with) I had never had it before and didn't enjoy the texture, it was quite salty also and I followed teh directions to a tee.  Sorry, not a keeper.

Very GOOD!!  I did put just a little extra cheese.  I don't think I will use as much onion next time.  Maybe only half of one instead of a whole one.  We really liked it.  Easy recipe!

This was just perfect!  It was a nice blend of flavors and the perfect side dish to our meal.  I didn't have any frozen chopped broccoli so I used a combo of cooked fresh broccoli and cauliflower instead.  Came out wonderful!  I wouldn't change the crackers out for bread crumbs as you won't get quite the same buttery, crunchy taste.  5 stars!

This recipe is terrific.  I took it to a church potluck today, and there was none left at the end!  Everyone loved it.  The only thing I changed was to add more cheese on top, leave out the onions, and put french fried onions on top.

This was quite easy and delicious. Even my husband who is not a broccoli (or vegetable!) fan liked this. My sons who love broccoli really liked it. I did follow some of the other suggestions and decreased the mayo by 1/2 cup, only used one egg, and used 2 cups of cheese. Will use this for family gatherings and holiday meals.

My husband raves about this, and he is a staunch no veggie person!  Even my 3 picky kids finished all of it!  Wonderful and easy to make, I excluded the onions and used fresh broccoli.  Tasted great.

Thank you, Laura, for this easy and delicious recipe.  I cook for groups, and I tested this on one of our groups, and it got an A-1 rating.  The only thing I don't like about this recipe is the canned soup, so I went to the store, got the general ingredients for cream of mushroom soup and made it from scratch.  It turned out beautifully.  I followed some of the suggestions by others, one was to wait until the end to put on the cheese.  I am glad I did this.  May I recommend you create a vegan (no cheese) recipe for this one?  Also, I added Gimme Lean pretend sausage meat, and that made it extra special.  Yummm! One more thing:  When I  multiplied it for 28, I did have a little more than was needed, so this recipe is very generous, serving-wise, as our people have very hearty appetites.

DELICIOUS!  My 15 year old son devoured this dish during the thanksgiving holiday.  I was able to sneak in 2 bags of frozen veggie medley w/carrots & cauliflower. (I upped the amount per serving.)  Fantastic dish!  This dish will be able to go through many transactions without a glitch.  A must try by all.  Thank you so much for sharing.

I was given the job of making the Broccoli Casserole, since the one that makes it every year had to go to another house for Thanksgiving. I remember her telling me a little of what was in it, but could not find the recipe. I found this one and it was it! I actually liked this more because it has some seasoning! Great THanks!

My husband really wanted to make this for our Christmas dinner, but I couldn't find my grandmother's recipe that she had given me. Luckily I remembered most of the ingredients and found this recipe, which is exactly like hers.  He doubled it and used two cans of cream of mushroom soup, which made it a little soupier than Grandma's, but it was still really good!!  Just like I remember!  He also didn't use butter and substituted regular mayo for ff (calories calories!)  Thanks for a great recipe! I'm keeping ahold of this one for future special dinners.

This was very good.  I added cheddar on top of the crackers during the last 20 minutes of baking.  Mine needed to bake for a whole hour to get the middle to set.  Very good, simple, easy recipe.  Thank you.

I made this for a dinner party and it was very easy and delicious.  I used almost twice as much broccoli as the recipie called for because there seemed to be so much sauce.

This was abig hit at a recent dinnner party I had.  I think that after thawing the broccoli it should be drained a bit before combining with the other ingredients.

This recipe is delicious!  I have been looking for the "ultimate" broccoli casserole.  My husband and I both agree that this one is it!  I used 1/4 cup of chopped pecans and 3/4 cup of mayonnaise as someone else had suggested.  That just seemed to really complete the recipe.  I will definitely be making this over and over again.

One addition I have made to this inasmuch as I live in the South where pecans are plentiful, is to add a little less mayo and 1/4 cup broken pecans (the pecans have oil in them) and it adds a crunchiness to this casserole and part of the mayo can be eliminated, but it is really GREAT!!!

It was ok...too much mayonnaise & the egg felt scrambled inside...not a good thing texture wise. I will try it again but mix everything in a separate bowl, use less mayonnaise & salt, & maybe use fresh broccoli.

This app should be able to let you add to your original post. After recipe cooled, agree with every other post..TOO SALTY. Will make again, but remove the season salt.

Fabulous and I like that it is a lower carb version without the rice, like most broccoli casseroles.  Makes a nice base for a good tuna casserole too.

After a few changes this is one I will keep as a favorite. Instead of garlic salt I sautéed chopped garlic with the onion. Also I added chopped mushrooms to the mix.  Then once the mix was in the pan I covered it with crushed Annie’s Organic Cheddar crackers.

Followed recipe exactly, and while it was ok, there was no WOW factor. Very bland, which was surprising given the number of ingredients in the casserole.

I made this recipe and found that all I could taste was the mayo. None of the three of us could finish more than a few bites. And yes, we do all like mayonnaise... just not this much. I don’t think I would try it again, even with substituting the mayo out for something else.

I made several modifications but overall pretty tasty. I used 20 oz of fresh broccoli (steamed), 1/2 cup of mayo instead of a cup, a little chicken broth, added 2lbs of browned ground turkey, about 2 cups of sharp cheddar and crumbled up some potato chips on top (skipped the butter)

This was quick and easy and got rave reviews at a family gathering. I followed the recipe exactly as written except I didn’t have any shredded cheese. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and parm instead and it was amazing! My family said for me to log this recipe in my cookbook and bring it to all future family gatherings.

Tastes fine. Wish it hadn’t separated. I had to use gluten free crackers on top, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I’m not a fan of the way the creamy part separated and was clumpy. Overall taste was fine.

I used 1/2 chopped onion.
I measured out the same amount of fresh broccoli.

This was a very simple recipe and very good.  My substitution of fresh broccoli did add a bit of time and work to the recipe, so don't do that if you are looking for quick and easy.  It was a little too salty for me, but perfect for my wife, so if you prefer lower saltiness in your food, then start with unsalted butter and reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup as a first time starting point and adjust from there.  I'm going to start experimenting with this one to make it my own, but the family greatly loved it as is.  Even my 15 mo old son loved it!

I don't usually like mushroom soup in this type of casserole, but with the other additions to the sauce, you couldn't even taste the mushroom soup.  I used fresh broccoli (parboiled) and had matchstick carrots I needed to use, so I sauteed them with the onions.  It added great taste, texture, and color.  The crumb topping was nice and crunchy.  It reminds me of a casserole my sister used to make called Muzzie Casserole.   Delicious!

Didn't have cream of mushroom but my bf loved it (which is petty unexpected) I just added all kinds of dairy products we have, like sour cream, sliced cheddar cheese, some of my JP cheeses, and some whipped cream because we don't have regular cream. Good way to get him to eat veggies!

Great recipe -  However, I agree with the other reviews that salt should be reduced in any way possible such as replacing garlic salt with garlic powder and using reduced sodium cream of mushroom. You can also reduce the amount of mayo but I don't think that the amount in the recipe is overwhelming. 

Definitely making this again - low sodium style :)

First time I made it, I followed the directions exactly except I increased the cheese to 2 cups. Delish! Next time I made it, in addition to the increased cheese, I used frozen mixed veggies (corn, carrots, green beans, peas) instead of broccoli. I like the later version better. I take it to a lot of potluck dinners and it is always a hit.

I will definitely make this again.  Though I did do some small changes (I micro'd fresh broccoli and cauliflower instead of frozen and added cooked mushrooms), this recipe is a good one.

This was OK, but wouldn't make it again. It was super rich, tasted like 'too much mayo'.

Made this for our Thursday night dinner along with the slow cooker Salisbury steak. My wife flipped over both! Now I have to talk her out of me having to make every week! Followed the recipe to a T, other than all I had was medium cheddar. This is a definite keeper though!

When I served this casserole for the first time, my family raved about it. I followed the recipe except I used cracker crumbs tossed with melted butter.  It's super easy to make and is a great side dish. I will definitely serve this again.

As an old lady,  I tried this recipe in an effort to cut carbs and calories ( ie. pasta) and it tasted great.  I used only half the butter called for to fry the onions, 1/2 cup of mayo, and a bit more cheese, and plain saltine crumbs blended with a tablespoon of butter.  It was still outstanding, iMHO.

Our family really liked this.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I probably won't make this very often because I didn't think it was a very healthy dinner option, but it was delicious!!

This wasn't what I was hoping for. It was decent, but wouldn't make again. I was hoping for something cheesier, saucier and without such a curry flavor. Thanks for the recipe try!

I liked this recipe. Naturally I made revisions to suit me such as not adding the egg. I also did not add lemon because I didn't have it though I can tell it would work well and hope to use it next time. I also cut back on everything except the cheese and added sour cream. I never measure anything and just go by looks . This is the broccoli casserole base recipe for me!

My family loves this recipe! We have made it at least 20 times and it's delicious! We use limes instead of lemons since that's usually what we have on hand. I always add more cheese and more crackers than the recipe calls for as well.. It's so great! We save it for holidays and special occasions. Everyone looks forward to it. I have to make doubles so we can have left overs the next day!!

I made this and it turned out great. I didn't use mayonnaise or cream of mushroom, instead i used 1.5 - 2 cups of heavy cream instead. I also substituted the Ritz crackers with Cheezits as one other person had suggested, and covered with foil the entire cooking time. It's so easy I will make this again.

Made some questionable changes based on what I had on hand - American cheese and crushed Triscuits tossed in melted butter.  It was delicious and very well received by our dinner guests.  I am sure it will be fabulous with cheddar cheese and buttery crackers.  Will definitely serve this again.

This recipe is great. I've made it a few times, even when I was missing a few things (like mayonnaise) and it's always tasty.  I also never have frozen broccoli, so the fresh stuff works just fine. A great alternative to boring, boiled broccoli for sure. Thanks for sharing!

I haven't tried this recipe, but much like many who LOVE broccoli casserole, my recipe is similar - minus the lemon juice and I don't put the Ritz on. Other than that? It's a delicious recipe - great for getting kids to eat their broccoli!

This was awesome. My 9 yo old son that claims he hates broccoli, had two servings. 

I've been trying to duplicate my mom's version and this is really close. My only changes were I eliminated the lemon and used a few dashes of Tastefully Simple's Garlic Garlic instead of garlic salt.

Delish!

I wanted to like this recipe. All the right ingredients were there for some superior comfort food but somehow, sadly, it didn't add up. I did take the advice of previous posters and used half as much mayo. At first bite it had a somewhat fluffy texture that was pleasing, but that gave way to the actual flavor which was not all that great. Prolly won't make it again.

We made some changes.  We used two 16 oz bags of broccoli-one bag was just broccoli florets and one bag was chopped broccoli.  We used one 8 oz. package sharp cheddar, grated.  We added one can of sliced water chestnuts, drained.  For the top, we sprinkled with some of the grated cheddar and a package of fried onions.  We didn't use the lemon juice or the seasoning salt.  It was absolutely delicious.

My very favorite broccoli recipe! 
The change I made was using frozen broccoli florettes for more bulk instead of chopped broccoli & added 1/2 cup of dry white rice (cooked so did not measure quantity after cooking). Actually I doubled the recipe for church function which generously filled  an aluminum take-out pan (approximately 10x7x3).
Note:  For in-home use, I always add extra onion; we simply like onions!

I would have given 5 stars had it not been for the mayonnaise. We like mayonnaise and even though I used a reduced fat mayo it seemed to make it a little too rich. I will make it again but not include the mayo. I made a change in that I used the Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup with Roasted Garlic. In light of the roasted garlic I did not add garlic salt, just a very light sprinkling of regular salt. It's a tasty recipe and worked well with some grilled chicken breasts.

This dish was a holiday staple of my childhood, and I make it it for my family now, too. I do cut down on the mayo, and substitute florets for one of the boxes of chopped broccoli. I also use crushed Cheez-its for the crumb topping. It's the only recipe exempt from my "no recipes with condensed soup" rule.

This was truly awesome!  Creamy and delicious!  I usually don't make any major modifications, trusting that the cook knows what they were doing, but in this case I did make a small one.  I used 1/2 cup mayo instead of 1 cup (that just sounds like too much) and added a cup more of the shredded cheddar (making it 2 cups).  I also took another reader's suggestion and used cheez it's instead of butter crackers, but that was just because I forget to buy the crackers!  SUPER YUMMY!

Made this over the weekend for Thanksgiving and it was very good.  I did use fresh broccoli and some fresh cauliflower (only b/c it didn't seem like enough broc) that I steamed a bit before assembling the casserole.  Sauteed onion in spray oil, and based on some reviews, used half cup each light mayo and sour cream and also added a splash of wors.  Did not add the salt as I didn't feel it was necessary, but did add the pepper and some granulated garlic, yummy!  Also used my own fresh breadcrumbs for lack of having any proper crackers around!

Eh, ths was jsut so-so...  I didn'd add the cracker crumb topping, and I cut the mayo to 3/4 cup, after readig some of the reviews sayng there was too much mayo..  Oh, and during about the last 15 mnues of baking I added some american cheese slices and some bacon cits b/c i could tell it was really bland.
This is a good way to serve broccoli, but it is not outsatndig by any means. I don't think I will make again., Thanks for the recipe, though.

I have tried soooo many broccoli casserole recipes and this is such a keeper. I try to stay away from processed cheese so this looked like a good one to try. I did 1/2 fat free sour cream and 1/2 low fat mayo and it was wonderful!

Loved it!  Just like Grandma used to make.  I did use a touch more broccoli because my family likes a strong broccoli taste.  I also used light mayo, 98% fat free soup, light butter, light cheese and reduced fat crackers.  Still very yummy.

I was disappointed by this, which was suprising considering all the good reviews.  I made it exactly as is, and the mayo was way over powering, and the flavor wasn't that good.  Won't be trying it again.

Nothing special.  I thought it tasted greasy, and not enough flavour.  Prehaps next time I could cut out the mayo and add fresh lemon zest.

I was really impressed - after getting the casserole prepped, I stuck it in the oven and ran an errand.  When I came back home, I discovered the oven had not heated up properly, and was only at 100 degrees.  I tried again, at a higher temp, and even though it didn't end up pretty, it was tasty enough that everyone, from my toddler to my in-laws, cleaned their plates.  That almost never happens.  What will it be like if I get the recipe right, I wonder?  I'll test it out soon, that's for sure!

Loved it! I made this at Thanksgiving for the in-laws and they loved it. EVERYONE was having seconds even those who said they done like broccolli. I would definately recommend to others. I use more cheese than what was said, but that's just because I love cheese! I also did not use garlic salt; it's to much salt in my opinion. I saved the garlic taste for the mashed potatoes!

I made this today to take to my in-laws for lunch.  It was very yummy and I got rave reviews from everyone.  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly except I sprinkled a little more cheddar cheese on top before I put on the cracker crumbs.  Excellent!

My husband and I loved this casserole. It really hit the spot...
My children, however, wouldn't touch it...apparently they only eat plain broccoli...go figure!

I might have missed something but the consistency was way too runny for my like.  Maybe mixing some other veggies in there to fill in the sauce might have helped, but it was a little too messy for me.

yum!  even the kids gobbled up their broccoli.  I left out the sour cream in the interest of making this a little more healthy.  I substituted a white sauce for the soup (no salt for me), used balsamic vinegar instead of the lemon juice, and omitted the cracker crumbs because they seemed too old-fashioned to me.  came out great -- thanks!

I used a bunch of mixed vegetables rather than just broccoli.  It came out tasting okay, but wasn't what I was expecting.  The eggs came out cooked and so the dish had a quiche like consistency.  I thought the casserole would be creamier I guess.

A bit too rich, and that was after cutting the mayonnaise by half. More of a side dish than a main.

Made this for Easter dinner as I needed something with a bit of color on the plate.  Boyfriend really didn't care a lot for this, but he's not a big broccoli fan. I thought it was very good though not something I'm make often.  I used minced garlic in place of the garlic salt (there's salt in the cheese, seasoned salt, and the crackers already. For those who might not care for the strong flavor of broccoli, perhaps this would be a good choice as some of the flavor is lost to the other ingredients.

Initially I felt that this was a bit bland, but then I reread the recipe and realized that I forgot to add the seasoned salt, oops. Other than my mistake I liked the texture and the flavor of this. I didn't use any of the butter and I used reduced fat reduced sodium soup. I sauteed the onions with sliced mushrooms and minced garlic in olive oil. I'll definitely make this again, I'll just be sure to add the seasoned salt.

I modified this a bit. But it was still delicious. I omitted: onions, lemon juice & crackers. I added-low sodium cream of mushroom soup, frozen green beans & bread crumbs. I actually loved the green beans in this casserole but did NOT like the broccoli. I'm not sure why!

I will make again but try to reduce the fat & calories. I didn't realize how much there was per serving. I may try using lower-fat cheese and miracle whip. 

I loved the recipe though! I will make again, with modifications and ONLY green beans this time. Funny, I was searching for a good green bean casserole that wouldn't have any onions in it. I found it in this broccoli casserole!!

Excellent!  I made this for my fiances birthday party, along with  my first turkey!  He loved it even though he's more of a processed cheese broccoli casserole kinda guy (which I can't do.) It was super easy.  I used fresh broccoli and forgot I was halving the recipe by the time I got to the garlic salt, but it was perfect.  A group of mid-late 20 somethings ate the whole thing!

Personally, I loved it.  We used swiss instead of cheddar and I thought it was amazing & delicious.  Not everyone agreed however - most of the comments said I should have used cheddar though, so I'm still giving this recipe 5 stars.  I'll make it as written next time - I've learned my lesson.  :)

Hm. I almost don't know what to think of this recipe. Neither I nor the boyfriend liked it too much last night, but now that we've had it as leftovers, we like it much more. I think next time I'll use regular cheddar instead of extra sharp (it was all I had), no egg, and maybe a little exra onion. I also used Publix cheese crackers instead of buttery crackers, and am glad I did. If I make this again, I'll probably double the proportion of broccoli suggested in this recipe.

When I first tasted this I thought it would be better with fresh broccoli (I made it to use up some frozen in the freezer), but after a day in the fridge this was really good.

Thanks for this great recipe.  Next time, I would add more onion only because I love onion, but very good flavor overall.

Mushy and bland, all that creamy mush, even the cheese didn't redeem it, we ate it, we all love broccoli but we won't be trying this recipe again. I halved it and we still had leftovers, this from the family who can demolish 4 pounds of fresh steamed broccoli in one meal.

WOW!!!!  This was awesome.  I am not usually a big fan of broccoli casserole but my husband had been bugging me to make one so I did and now I can say that I am a fan.  The only change that I made was that I used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom, just because I can not stand mushrooms.  But it still tasted great.  Even my two year old liked it and she doesn't hardly like anything.

This was really good.  As several reviews have also mentioned, this has turned my non-broccoli loving husband into a believer!  Next time I may add a can of tuna to make it more hearty.

Made it for my mom's birthday dinner, everyone loved it...my husband even liked it and he doesn't eat veggies. For a long list of ingredients (I like 4-5 not 13) it was easy to make and turned out great.

I've made this for the past two Thanksgiving's and I really like it. My sister in law requests it. I gave it 4 stars only because each year we have a lot left over and it doesn't seem to be something everyone else is really into. But again I really like the recipe.

This was delicious!  I used frozen broccolli and artichoke quarters.  I happen to have a lot of bread crumbs from my bread maker that doesn't work the way I want it to and so I used those for the topping.  Best ever!!  Today I'm making it with SW Pepper Jack cheese soup instead of the Mushroom soup.  Spicy but just as good.

Very good, but better the next day. I used a 16oz package of frozen broccoli and omitted the eggs but kept the other ingredients the same and it was wonderful. It wasn't *soupy* at all This was very good indeed. Thank you.

I substituted as many ingredients to Light as I could, such as light mayo, 98% Fat free cream of mushroom soup, reduced fat shredded cheese, I used one egg and one egg white and I used fresh broccoli rather than frozen.  It was very good but for some reason I enjoyed it more reheated the next day than when I made it that night.
