It's not unusual for me to eat Chinese out two or three times per week, so I have a LOT of experience in eating Chinese food.  I've been to 90% of the Chinese restaurants in the metro area I live in.  And hey--this stuff passes the test.  It's the first time I've tried cooking Chinese and I can't believe how easy it was.  Further, it turned out fabulously.  It's as good or better than most Chinese restaurants.  Here's what I did:  1) used champagne instead of white wine; it's what I had available, 2) absolutely double, triple or quad the recipe; if you don't eat it now, you will eat it later ... the recipe doesn't make very much unless you eat like a bird, 3) for my family, the hot level was perfect ... it was certainly hot, but not too hot, 4) the sauce WAS a little thick--I will try decreasing the cornstarch next time ... as it was, adding water worked for me too, 5) if you can't find chile paste at your local grocery store, check out almost any Asian grocery store--they will likely have many choices.

I think this is my all time favorite recipe.  I have made it dozens of times and all my friends and family say it's the best thing I make!  I do make a few alterations though, which I find absolutely crucial:  Double the marinade and the sauce, add lots and lots of water as the mixture cooks - otherwise it gets really pasty.  I would say throughout the cooking process I end up adding at least a cup of water.  You want to make sure there's enough sauce to cover the noodles.  I also add several cups of chopped up veggies; usually red and green peppers, mushrooms and broccoli.  Thanks so much for this recipe!!

Yummy.  Restaurant quality.  Had to alter quite a bit.  Took the orginal recipe for marinade: used rice wine,1 clove of garlic and reduced the sesame oil to 1 tsp. Did not add cornstarch to marinade.  5X the recipe of soy sauce, rice wine, vinegar, brown sugar, and 1 clove of garlic, 2 tsp. of chile paste, and 1 tbsp of cornstarch with 2 tbsp of water.  Stir fried the chicken first and set aside. Then stir fried brocolli, mushrooms, carrots and green onions together.  Added sauce and then chicken. Couldn't add peanuts due to allergy.  Rave reviews from Dad and 2 kids. *****

This was a terrific dish and perfect for my spicey food loving family. I couldn't find chile paste in the grocery store, so I subbed with a spicey szechuan sauce. I tripled the marinade and quadrupled the sauce even though I only used four chicken cutlets. Didn't have any peanuts, so I used peanut butter, which I often do in asian dishes. I added broccoli and baby corn to make a complete meal. Thanks Arlena, it was great!

I followed this exactly as written (saw many favorable reviews that had made many changes). I love spicy food, but this did not have a good flavor hot and there was not enough sauce.

Ok ya'll I have made this recipe so many times now, I kind of know what goes in it without looking at the recipe. This is a great base recipe, without a doubt and if you don't like spice at all, I would still to this recipe exactly. 

Now for all you REAL kung pao chicken lovers that want the SPICE. You have to add A LOT more sambal or chile paste to make this even remotely close to something you've tasted before. I think I used almost a fourth of my HUGE jar of sambal to make this work. I would also marinade the chicken in it as well so you just an extra layer of spicy. I think it's the vinegar, but it completely mellows out the spice of it, so you definitely have to over compensate. 

Also, you don't really have to measure. Most of these things are one to one or two to one, so it's actually pretty easy to figure out. I have done these plenty of times without measuring it out exactly and plenty of times with measuring it out and it turns out virtually the same. 

Finally, you need to double the sauce part of this recipe. The original recipe actually needs a little more sauce then is written. The only things I wouldn't double are the peanuts and the water chestnuts. In the original recipe there are far too many of those things that the chicken kind of gets lost. 

Hope this is helpful to you from someone who has had this a bunch! :)

I didn't have chile paste, so I threw in some red pepper. I tripled the sauce recipe because I added baby corn, green bell pepper, and thinly sliced carrots and it wouldn't have been enough once I added the chicken. The sauce got really thick though & had to add some water to thin it down a bit. You may have to adjust this one to your own taste. It's good, but I needed to play around with it.

I lived in China for two years, and this recipe (with some important but minor changes) comes very close to the Kung Pao chicken that can be found in Beijing restaurants. 

With regard to ingredients, I agree with other reviewers: cut the cornstarch in both the marinade and the sauce. (I used 1 teaspoon in the marinade and 2 teaspoons in the sauce.) A few extra notes: Use Chinese rice wine, like Shaoxing, and light (as opposed to dark) soy sauce, if you can find them. I also agree with some other reviewers that chili paste is probably better than chili sauce. Lastly, skip the water chestnuts and add a carrot, like they do in Beijing. The carrot provides a wonderful crunchiness and sweetness that balances nicely with the spice.

To solve the issue of there being too little sauce, don't cook the chicken separately; after the sauce has been warmed, throw the chicken and marinade in and stir constantly until it's cooked through.  

To make sure you've got enough food, try a few simple (and cheap!) Chinese sides like potatoes and green peppers (????? cù liu tu dòu si), eggs and tomatoes (?????? xi hóng shì chao ji dàn), eggs and wood ear mushrooms (????? mù er chao ji dàn), eggs and cucumber (????? huáng gua chao ji dàn)  egg drop soup, sweet corn soup, and broccoli with garlic (????? suàn róng xi lán hua). 

If you want to finish off the meal like they do in Beijing, serve fresh fruit: Fuji apples, pineapple and kiwi.

Very delicious,my dish was not quite PF Changs but great anyway. I found only hot chili sauce in the Asian Market so I  used that, the apartment smelled wonderful. Problems I encountered were: The cornstarch in the chicken marinade started to burn and stick when I browned it, and the cornstarch in the marinade itself was too much so instead of a sauce I got a thick paste, to which I kept adding water(suggestion: use a little less cornstarch). Finally the sugar was not enough for my liking so next time I will use a bit more...otherwise really really tasty. My husband and I ate every scrap. Thanks.

WOW!  I was afraid to try this recipe as I've never had success with an Asian recipe.  But, this blew me and my family away!  It is so tasty!!  The only thing I did different was to double the sauce (though not the waterchestnuts; 1 can is enough for us).  I will make this many times over.  It is fantastic.  Thanks!!!

This was very, very yummy.  I did a few things differently.  I decreased the amount of sesame oil.  I added mushrooms and broccoli to the sauce and sauteed the chicken in flavored wok oil.  I didn't want the sauce to be too strong for my hubby and four-year-old so I doubled the sauce recipe and added about a cup of chicken broth and an extra bit of cornstarch.  I omitted the chili paste but added red pepper flakes to my plate to heat it up.  I didn't have any peanuts so I had to shell some from the African Gray's stash so they were unsalted.  I can't wait to make it again.  By the way, the bird thought it was top notch too.  Thanks

Great marinade! Chicken is made quite tender...I only used 1/2T oil, and 1 T chile paste, and added a t of sugar to balance out the flavors. :) Thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe exactly except I forgot to buy a can of water chestnuts! Great recipe, and VERY spicy. For those who wonder, an ounce is 2 tbsp, so it's 2 tbsp chili paste and 1/2 cup peanuts.

Yum to the max!  A very simple, yet aromatically and taste-buds pleasing recipe!  The only differences I'd suggest is to perhaps double the sauce, and add some veggies like julienned red peppers, and even snow peas.  Sure that can detract from its authenticity, but it's a great way to add some veggies - because the flavor of the sauce is so good!  Served it up with brown rice.  Decently low-calorie (we left out the sesame oil and sugar.. which are heavy on calories). :)

I've made this twice now and loved it after I made several changes. In order to get that crsipy yet tender chicken, omit the marinade completely. Instead toss the chicken with a bit of cornstarch so that its coated and stir fry it in a skillet with olive oil and dried red peppers. Stir fry until chicken is browned and crispy and cooked through. Then toss the sauce with the chicken until well coated. For the sauce, definately double or triple it but do not increase the cornstarch. A little goes a long way. You only need about 1 tbsp even if you increase everything else. Also I cut the sesame oil in half and substitute hot chili oil for the rest of the sesame. Super spicy but delicious!

This was the absolute BEST!  Truly restaurant flavor. I made very few changes which is unusual for me.   I tripled the marinade and the sauce, but only used one tablespoon of sesame oil and two tablespoons of olive oil (tripling would have called for six tablespoons of sesame oil).  I cut back on the sesame oil because it can become overpowering and six tablespoons of sesame oil would definitely have been overpowering.  I also didn't have peanuts so I used about a tablespoon (maybe a little more) of chunky peanut butter and it worked out great!  I didn't triple the water chestnuts and just used the one 8 oz can.  I also replaced the water with chicken stock and thinned the sauce as needed at the end with chicken stock rather than water.  I didn't know what one ounce of chili paste looked like so I used about a tablespoon (keeping in mind that I tripled the sauce).  It was spicy, but we liked it that way.  I would recommend going easy on the chili paste because you can always add more when it's cooking if you want it hotter.  It does intensify as it cooks.  Absolutely fantastic!  I served it with Chinese Chicken Fried Rice (by LISA TOURVILLE) from this site but left out the chicken in the rice.   Oh yeah, I made the sauce about three hours before and refrigerated it in a covered bowl and also marinated the chicken for the three hours too because I had an appointment I had to go to, so this is something you can prepare in advance and cook later.

Okay, the taste of this - is 5 stars. It is really good! But I am only  giving it 3 stars because how the recipe is written - is poor. I **tripled** this recipe, and it still was not enough for 5 people!!! (me, my b/f, and 3 kids) I didn't have enough to give to my 2 youngest without giving up my own portion, so since they aren't the biggest fans of Asian dishes, I had to make them an entirely different (quick) meal. if you are cooking this for 3 or more adults, x4 or even x5 the recipe. Sounds crazy, but the recipe as written is for 2 portions, not 4.

DELICIOUS!!! Entered the ingredients I had on hand and this recipe came up - my husband and I couldn't stop eating this.  Did not have chili paste so used about 1/4 cup of Sriracha.  Also added 1 tbsp of red pepper flakes to both the marinade and the sauce.  Really hot and VERY tasty.  So good I'm tripling the recipe and having all the kids over tonite to have it!  Had it over rice last night and tonite we'll try it with sesame noodles.  GREAT RECIPE!  Thanks!

I know I'm in the minority here, but we didn't care for this too much.  If I were to ever make this again, I would not double or triple the sauce as many suggested - it made it too thick, more like a stew or a gravy.  We don't like tons of sauce.  However, that is not the author of the recipe's fault - that was me taking the most popular suggestions.  
We also live near an award winning Chinese restaurant in the Philadelphia area.  Their kung pao is out of this world, so we are probably a little spoiled. This recipe was also a lot of work so I think I'll stick to ordering out.

Finally made this after fiance' asked many times. He is allergic to peanuts so I skipped it. A very good recipe that is very close to restaurant quality. I used dark toasted sesame oil because it was what I had. I think it will be better to use a light-colored sesame oil which I will do the next time.

This recipe is da bomb! Spicy, sweet, tangy, this recipe has it all. Just like the ones I'll see in the restaurants at my home. I actually omitted the water chestnuts because I've never seen it in kung pao chicken. Also I wasn't sure what hot chile paste is or how much 1 ounce is so I used a tablespoon of sriracha and lee kum kee chile garlic sauce. I am from Monterey Park which is also called the real Chinatown by purists so I know my kung pao chicken! Thanks for sharing =)

This was a pretty good recipe, and it definitely has the benefit of not tasting like every other chinese chicken dish that you find so frequently.  My only two thoughts would be to marinate the chicken over night to give it more flavor (because it tasted 5 times better the next day after it sat in its goop all night!) and add some more sugar.  Otherwise, I thought it was great, nice heat level.

This is pretty good however the trick to authentic Chinese cooking is always use fresh chopped garlic & chopped fresh ginger while marinating the chicken, use Chinese wine or dry sherry & regular oil to stir fry the chicken & use the marinade (please no brown sugar) to cook the chicken thighs (not breasts) until tender, adding chicken stock as needed. Traditional Kung Pao chicken doesn't have any veggies except green onions, garlic, ginger & perhaps a green bell pepper along with small red dried chilies (add them when stir frying chicken) or chili pepper flakes. After chicken is tender add bell pepper, if using & some more soy sauce, stock, chili paste to taste, cook until crisp tender & add chop green onions, peanuts & sesame oil...if you want more sauce, simply combine cornstarch & stock until blended & add to the cooked Kung Pao mixture, high heat, stiring to cook & thicken the sauce...serve over steamed jasmine rice, pass the chop sticks & enjoy! I am from San Francisco so I know Chinese style cooking & Kung Pao chicken (or shrimp or beef) is one of my favorite dishes to order or make at home. Adding veggies such as brocolli, carrots, celery & mushrooms is spicy stir fry NOT Kung Pao chicken. This recipe is very nice but not authentic...Chinese cooks use thighs not expensive chicken breasts fyi, lol. Adding sesame oil at the end of cooking adds flavor as a finishing oil (like extra virgin oil in other non Asian recipes is a flavor enhancer). Also if you do not have fresh

First I wanna say that I love Kung pao chicken! but wasn't sure about this one. I was OK as chicken and veggies but not sure if it was even close to the kung pao chicken at Panda Express!! sorry didn't really fell in love with this recipe. Maybe I did something wrong who knows, I am not trying to be mean, if it worked for you, good for you.

I can't believe how good this came out!  And it was not that difficult at all. I was skeptical but thought I'd give it a try and I just happen to have most of the ingredients on hand. I also added some chopped green bell pepper and a julienned carrot.  I didn't have peanuts but as another reviewer suggested, I added some peanut butter. The family loved it, including my very picky teenage daughter!  Great recipe and something different for a change. Thx!

This recipe was way too much work marking out the recipe and then figuring out the ratios. Not exactly what a busy lady was looking to do on a busy weeknight. Because of the poor formatting and the ratios being so far off I only rated this as 3 stars it was a simple idea that should have been simple to execute. I now have a great recipe "my own" and it tastes just like I get it at the restaurant. 
The crucial things to make this dish excellent adjust the ratios for everything especially the sugar not much but enough. Don’t use anything but red pepper paste you want to at least use 2 1/2 xs more then what the original poster used to give it that same hotness you would expect at a restaurant. Chili sauce is not the same thing. Use seasoned rice vinegar found in Asian markets this will elevate this dish to restaurant worthy. Use sweet mirin wine, use a wok leave the peanuts whole fry them first for at least 25 seconds with the garlic to start off the dish being careful not to burn the garlic or peanuts. Use the leftover marinade to thin the sauce when it starts to get to thick don't use water to thin the sauce. Anything from the raw chicken being in the marinade will be cooked away from the heat. End with adding the onions at the last 25 seconds they will be perfect. Use one pan preferably a wok it will save time.

I've made this recipe a few times, and really like it. I tripled the sauce recipe so we'd have some extra to put on the rice that we like with it. I never had to add any water (which some other people recommended), but I didn't think the sauce was too thick without it at all. The marinade didn't seem to add all that much to the chicken the first time, so I stopped marinating it after that and just cook it in a little oil. Also, it was a little too spicy the first time, so I cut back on the chili paste after that as well. I used cashews instead of peanuts just because we like them better. I've also used the sauce with tofu, which is great.

This was probably the worst chicken dish I've ever made. It was probably my fault though because I made too many changes to the recipe. Don't make the same mistake I did. I made a lot of extra sauce like other reviewers suggested and used peanut butter in place of peanuts. Also I didn't have any cornstarch so I used flour instead. The sauce turned out really thick and goopy. My boyfriend was really turned off by the smell. The sesame oil was a little overpowering. I definitely won't be making this again.

I doubled the sauce and next time I will triple it.  I used cashews instead of peanuts, and I used an 8 oz can of water chestnuts and an 8 oz can of bamboo shoots.  I doubled the chili paste along with the rest of the sauce ingredients but I think next time I'll still only double the chili paste rather than tripling it - it is very spicy!

It's good with broccoli and carrots, too - I added them to the sauce and cooked it all together before adding the cooked chicken.  The veggies came out not crunchy, not mushy - perfect!

The recipe didn't say whether to use salted or unsalted nuts; I was lucky enough to find "lightly salted" nuts and I used these with "light" (low sodium) soy sauce.  Mmmm!  This is one of my very favorite recipes now - definitely a good one for company.

I didn't find this dish that flavorful - DH and I really wanted a nice, spicy hot Kung Pao - this was totally NOT spicy at all.  In fact, it was so not spicy that the kids had no problem eating it.  Since it had nuts, my daughter thought it was Peanut chicken, which she loved, so every scrap disappeared.  But, to DH and I, it was not very flavorful, nor spicy, and so not what we were looking for.  I followed the directions exactly, but tripled the marinade and sauce - and used chopped up pork loin instead of chicken.

To avoid the problem with the sauce in the dish being too pasty or thick while cooking, save the corn starch and add at the end when dish is done cooking.  Use just 1 tbsp cornstarch dissolved in 1.5 tbsp water, let simmer a few seconds to thicken.

I'm a beginner cook and I was able to make this recipe with virtually no problems!! It was rather flavorful and not at all difficult to make.  My only problem was that the sauce thickened a bit too quickly so I added some extra soy sauce and white wine and it still tasted great! I also reduced the amount of chili paste since I didn't want it to be too spicy. I substituted Peanut oil for Sesame Oil and used Roasted Red Chile Paste. Overall, I recommend this, it wasn't a lot of work and it was very flavorful.

I didn't have a lot of the ingrediants, so I substituted some of them for other things, but it still came out great!!  I used peanut butter instead of peanuts, so that gave it a very different taste.  It was still very good, and very easy!

I did not care for this recipe. 
First, I tripled the marinade & sauce. There was way too much sesame oil flavor; also way too much cornstarch. If you use the amount it calls for (like I did), it ends up way too pasty.

I wasn't sure whether to drain the water chestnuts or not. I really didn't want that liquid in my dish so I opted to drain and then loosen the sauce with another liquid. Anyway, we thoroughly enjoyed it and adding some cayenne strips (deseeded) was a real flavor booster too.

I rarely ever give a 5 stars, but this deserves 10. I am always trying to make chinese food and always fail, this was amazing. I tripled the marinade and quadrupled the sauce. I also cooked the chicken first and then when that had a nice brown to it I added the sauce until it became the consistency I preferred. I also in another pan cooked snow peas, garlic and water chestnuts with some of the sauce and then added the chicken to it because my hubby hates any veggies. I would make this again again and again, definitely was proud of myself for not screwing it up!!

This recipe is fantastic!  Better than most Chinese dishes I've tried in a lot of restaurants.  The recipe is extremely easy.  The sauce thickens up nicely with the chicken.  I did cut back on the peanuts, it was too "peanuty" for me otherwise. I served it with noodles and it was a huge hit with the gang.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

This is a pretty authentic recipe. I've made this couple of times. First, with Shaoshing wine and the last with white wine. Believe it or not, the white wine tasted much more authentic in this recipe. I used the siracha chile paste and it was perfect. I used thighs instead of breast since it's less dry in stir-fry. Didn't use peanuts since kids are not fans. Added a green and red pepper with fresh water chestnuts and tripled the recipe, except for the heat and corn starch.

Awesome! Just what I was looking for. I doubled the sauce and it was perfect.  I substituted 2 tablespoons of chili & garlic sauce for chili paste and it was very hot -but we like it that way!  I also recommend green pepper in this and enourage the use of cashews instead of peanuts.

My family found the sauce very tasty, although my boyriend and my mother found it way too HOT; I think next time, I'll only add half of the chile paste it calls for... I doubled the sauce, as suggested by other reviewers, but it still didn't give me all much... I substituted the green onions for fresh chives from my mom's garden. This recipe was really easy (I'm a beginner cook)... I served the chicken on a bed of whole grain rice... Excellent!

I had two nice sized chicken breast, so doubled the marinade after reading the reviews. I cooked some stir fry veggies separately and added in with the chicken. I think next time I won't chop the nuts, they sort of got lost in the mix. Mine didn't turn out a gorgeous red color like the picture, but I noticed most photos didn't either, I wonder how they got such a deep gorgeous color? Anyhow it was very good tender and just spicy enough for us, I used Sambel Oelek chili paste, I find it at the World Market.

Deeeeeelish !!! First time I ever used hot chile paste. Doesn't have the same fire as chile garlic sauce. Had to triple the amount before we could start to feel the heat. Great recipe.  Shared with a neighbor who said this was the best food she ever put in her mouth:)

This was so good.  I followed the other posts and made extra sauce.  I added red bell peppers and dried chili peppers for an extra kick.  I will be making it again

Followed recipe exactly and this was not very good. Chicken definitely needs to be browned.

YUM, but like others, I did change some things...Only put 1 teapoon of cornstarch in w/ the chicken marinade, which I dissolved in the soy sauce rather than the water. Also, I quadrupled the sauce ingredient (not adding in any cornstarch), except for the sesame oil, which I used 2 tablespoons of. I cooked the chicken, using the marinade as well, until done. Then I added in the sauce, water chesnuts and peanuts. I allowed that to simmer a few minutes and then thickened it to where I wanted it with the cornstarch/water slurry. This had wonderful flavor and was very simple to prepare. I will def be making this again w/ my changes! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was great! I couldn't find hot chile paste so we used chili sauce and forgot to add something for kick, but will do that the next time. If you don't have sesame oil, get some! It really added a great flavor. I used 5 oz. of water chestnuts and some carrots, celery and onions. The dish was wonderful at first sitting, but didn't heat up well the next day. We'll have this again soon - thanks for the recipe!

My entire family loved it.  Didn't realize that I hadn't put the chile past in until later that evening.  It still had a little kick to it but not spicy - probably from the soy or vinegar.  Def double the ingredients for the sauce EXCEPT the cornstarch.  I'd reduce that significanly.  Next time I'll probably get the sauce going and add the water/cornstartch as needed to thicken it instead of trying to thin it out.  Yum yum!

I believe the people who liked this recipe changed it pretty dramatically, as I did.  We did enjoy my adaptation and would make it again.  From reading the reviews I learned that the amount of cornstarch, sesame oil and hot chile paste are excessive and the recipe produces far too little sauce.  Here is what I did.  First I marinated the chicken as directed but without the cornstarch/water mixture.  I didn’t have water chestnuts, so I sweated a mix of colored peppers in a little vegetable oil and removed them from the pan.  I mixed up a triple batch of sauce, again omitting the cornstarch/water and significantly reducing the hot chile sauce and sesame oil to taste.  I added a little more oil to the same pan, drained the marinade from the chicken, and quickly sautéed it until it was golden brown and cooked through and removed it from the pan.  Then I deglazed the pan with the sauce.  CAUTION: I’m not sure why, but even using a large 4-qt. pan, my sauce bubbled up extremely high.  So much so, I had to remove it from the heat so it wouldn’t boil over.  I mixed a rounded teaspoon of cornstarch with water and added it to the sauce until I reached the consistency I was after.  I added the chicken back to heat through, but did not add the peppers because there was still not enough sauce, even after tripling it.  Instead I microwaved the peppers to reheat and served them on the side.  For those wanting to make this, read the reviews, both good and bad before proceeding!

I've been trying to make kung pao from scratch for years, and I've never *quite* got it.. but this recipe made a fantastic base! I used chicken thighs which give it that rich flavor and eliminate the need for cornstarch :P. I didn't use white wine, and I substituted stevia for sugar which worked just fine :). I separately quick fried my bell peppers, onions and celery in some coconut oil and added it to the chicken. I also quick fried some cabbage in coconut oil to put the chicken on top of. It was very good :)

I gave this a 5 because it tasted good...even with my error! I accidentally put the chicken in the pan without browning first, and just cooked right in the sauce. I also added baby corn, some green pepper chunks and water chestnuts. Ate with the coconut rice from this site. I made according to the recipe other than my error (even the chile paste). Was just the right spice. Yum!

Good for a weeknight meal.  Doesn't produce enough sauce for my liking. Consider doubling the sauce for next time to serve over the rice.

Good recipe...as close to the real thing as one can get w/o going out for Chinese!  I did make a few minor adjustments based on what I had on hand.  Once I saw how much the sauce made, I decided to triple it...it's not enough for the meat or rice if you choose to serve over rice.  I used sherry in place of the wine, shrimp in place of chicken, peanuts in place of the cashews, and Wondra gravy mix in place of the cornstarch (it blends better than cornstarch or flour, so it's all I use).  OUTSTANDING!  This recipe is truly a keeper and I urge all to try it as is or with my minor changes.

Excellent flavors, even though I only had chili sauce, not paste.  I know it will be even better next time with chili paste.

As everyone else said, the quantities for the sauce are unrealistic.  5X is the right amount to be served over rice.

I made this along with brown rice and broccoli lo mein and busted my gut.

Very good - but I don't think it's the atypical Kung Pao. It's a great stir fry with a little kick. Maybe I'd add the whole dried chili peppers like the restaurants do. Hubby and I ate it up though.

Awesome.  I follow the recipe almost exactly except for a hungry family of four (and that includes two teenage boys with hollow legs), I have to really increase the recipe probably x6 and I substitute seasoned rice vinegar for regular vinegar.  Oh, and you really don't have to marinate the chicken at all.  I never do and it turns out beautiful.  Almost never any leftovers and if there are, they go quick the next day for lunch.

We thoroughly enjoyed your recipe (thank you!).  Halved main recipe, but kept sauce as written - sauce did thicken up a little too much, but nothing a little water couldn't fix.  We added baby corn (spectacular) and some sliced Napa cabbage.  Next time, will need to remember to cut meat quite small (I left too large), and perhaps add a sliver or two of ginger.  I think some small red peppers would be a nice addition as well (we didn't find recipe spicy at all and ended up adding some hot chili sauce to compensate). UPDATE:  had to come back and upgrade to a 5 (grin) - this stuff is just good!

So yummy!!! Double the sauce for sure. I used 1/2 a can of water chestnuts and chopped them up, otherwise it would have been too much for my liking.  As others have mentions you will need to add some water.  Add enough water to get your desired thickness. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

Wonderful! I left out the water chestnuts and peanuts, doubled the garlic, nixed the chile paste (didn't have any). The sauce turned out a bit thicker than I like, but I just thinned it with 1/4 cup of H2O and it was perfect. Nomz!

This was very good!  I wavered between 4 and 5 stars, actually, but decided on 4 because I made a few little changes which improved it.  Because we are a bit sensitive to spiciness, I cut the chili paste in about half.  I also doubled the brown sugar and added extra water to the finished dish, which made more sauce.  This recipe had excellent flavor and I will certainly be making it again!

I couldn't give this 5 stars although my end result was a 5; as is I felt it had no sauce!  NOt sure why no one else mentioned but after I put the "sauce" in the pan and begun to heat it turned into some kind of paste so I ended up adding about 1/4 cup water.   Over all the dish was tasty but I think you need to double or triple your sauce.  I only had chili sauce so I added a dash of cayenne!  My guys all liked this very much!

I truly love this recipe and am about to make it for the fifth or sixth time. All the listed variations are helpful, but it stands on its own as listed. My favorite addition is fresh, crisp, green beans. Put them in late to avoid over-cooking. Bell peppers, chopped yellow onion, and most other vegetables work well. Great for cleaning out the fridge at the end of the week.   Sambal Oelek is one of the more common (and cheap) chili pastes. They have it in most groceries. There's a rooster on the gold label. Its sits perfectly with this recipe.

I made this last night and although it is tasty it is missing something.  I can't really figure out exactly what though.  I will try it again. .... OK...laughing at myself, I made this again, forgot that I had made it before and was going to say the same thing!  I have decided that the marinade for the chicken is what is lacking.  I will report back!

I would give this 10+ stars if I could!!  AMAZING.  I followed the recipe to the tee except I used 1/2 lbs cut up chicken tender meat, no onions or water chestnuts (ew) and I left the peanuts whole. WOW, this was fantastic. THANKS!

Good recipe on the first try. I did double the sauce as suggested, but do not recommend doubling the corn starch, as it isnt necessary. I also did a few things to enrich the flavors: use half dark, half light soy sauce in the sauce, add some chipotle powder to the marinade and a little fresh ginger and extra minced garlic to the sauce as well. Great recipe.

Finally!  Having tried to crack the code on making decent Chinese food at home for years, this was as close as I've come so far.  Even winging it - substituted sherry for the wine, didn't have the green onions or peanuts...the sauce was awesome and very restaurant like, although I needed to add some liquid toward the end to thin it a bit (would have used wine if I'd had it so I used water) this was 'The Bomb'.  Next time I'll have all the ingredients and definitely add some hot chilis.

Nice, easy, yummy recipe!  I made very few modifications. Just doubled the amount of the marinade and tripled the sauce.  I used less cornstarch than called for and still had to add more water.  Nothing wrong with that.  I'm just happy that the kids enjoyed it and that we didn't have to pay restaurant prices for a meal with an Asian flair.

This was a nice change for dinner.  Served with steamed white rice and carrots.  I subbed chili garlic sauce for the chili paste.  It adds good flavor but not too much heat.  We just aren't big on spicy foods here but do love Kung Pao Chicken.

Excellent dish.  Better than most restaurants!  I followed the recipe to the letter, and in my opinion, it doesn't need changing at all (except for doubling the sauce, as others have recommended).  This one's definitely a keeper!

This recipe was fantastic. Double the marinade and triple the sauce (careful tripling the chili paste, the GF and I LOVE spicy food and 3 ounces was too much for her. I would recommend 1.5 - 2 when tripling.). I brought a pot of water to boil (for pasta) and started to cook the chicken, marinade and all, and then shortly after started cooking the sauce. As other reviewers noted, when doubling the marinade and tripling the sauce, DO NOT double or triple the amounts of cornstarch. I only added 1 tbsp cornstarch dissolved into 1 tbsp of water into the sauce and it got thick very quickly. I would recommend keeping about a cup of water next to the stove because that's about how much I ended up adding. As soon as the chicken was done I added it to the sauce and threw in my pasta (highly recommend using "thick" spaghetti). Once my pasta was done, I strained, put it back into the pot, and dumped the sauce / chicken over it and mixed it in. It tastes JUST like California Pizza Kitchen's Kung Pao Spaghetti, SO SO good.

10 stars, really! As others mentioned, definitely add the water to the sauce. About 1 cup, worked for me. I used cashews instead of peanuts. Made several times now, and each time has been a success! So easy and delicious. Leftovers make an excellent lunch!!

It is more of a spicy schezuan chicken than the kung pao that is served in the Chinese restaurants we have here, but still very tasty, and the leftovers were still excellent! I tripled the sauceas suggested by other reviewers. I used chili oil instead of sesame oil in the marinade and sauce to kick up the spicyness. I threw the chicken in the wok a minute and dumped the marinade and sauce in all together. Stirred vigorously and let it simmer for about 15 mins on medium heat. Only needed to add 1/4 cup of water in the process. The peanuts, water chestnuts and green onions were added towards the end (closer to when it was ready to serve.) Turned out with lots of sauce. Very delicious, very spicy! Thank you for the recipe! Will be making it again.

This recipe was fantastic! My husband and I are trying to eat healthier so I changed a few things.  I only used 1TBLSP of Sesame Seed oil for the whole recipe.  I omitted the water chestnuts and peanuts and put in 1/2 tsp of reduced fat peanut butter.  I didn't have chile paste so I used 1TBLSP Red Pepper Sauce and 1/2TBLSP of crushed red pepper flakes. We served it over brown rice.  This turned out absolutely incredible.  My husband loves Chinese food and said he thought it was the best Kung Pao Chicken he has ever had. This will be a staple at my house.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was an okay recipe that did in fact taste decent, but seemed to be missing something. I had some anxiety while making it because the aroma was so pungent that I wasn't sure how it would end up tasting - whether it would even be edible. Adding lots of water is probably the key here. I had taken some reviewers' advice and didn't use the cornstarch, but probably would use at least a little bit if I made this again, since it was a little too watery without it. I served it with egg-fried rice and spring rolls. Thanks.

This was so flavorful and great!  I did double the marinade and sauce and was glad I did (also added about 1/4 cup of water to sauce).  I also followed others and added red pepper thinly sliced.  I mistakenly added 1 can of bean sprouts and my husband and I really liked the added flavor.  I wasn't sure about the chile paste because I'd never used it before and found a red pepper chile paste that seemed to work okay.  I added about 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes and the dish had the perfect bite.  I served this over steamed jasmine rice and it tasted perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe that will be used frequently in my home.

Excellent flavor but very spicy! Next time I will scale back on the amount of chili paste. I omitted the water chestnuts because I dislike them, and added thinly sliced carrots, onions and red bell pepper. I will definitely make this again.

Oh, yummy!!! A little spicy for my Anoose, but with less chili paste it is mad tasty.  Oh yeah, oh yeah. I doubled the marinade and tripled the sauce.  Pudgy hubby liked it too. Oh, and one more thing (oh yeah, oh yeah): don't add cornstarch mixture, don't add cornstarch mixture.  Oh yeah, no need, oh yeah, oh yeah.

Very good, will make again.  Doubled the marinade and tripled the sauce.  Sauce ended up a bit thick so next time I'll triple everything except cornstarch/water mixture.  Couldn't find chili paste so used Sesame Oil w/Chili.  Came out spicy, but not too spicy for us.

Wow!  This was very hot but so good.  I substituted tofu for chicken and added carrots, brocolli and bamboo shoots.  Definitely double (or triple the recipe).  Exact measurements aren't required either - I added more soy sauce for a saltier taste.

I have  made this well over a hundred times over the last 5 years, and love the recipe. It isn't the same as I get in restaurants, but it is still nice. A few recommendations, double the sauce, there is no where near enough for the original recipe, next up would be to either add more chili paste, or add something like chili flakes, the original recipe isn't very spicy.

I also would suggest maybe halving the peanuts, or doubling the sauce but keeping the peanut measurement the same, there are way too many in the original recipe. I can't make a suggestion for water chestnuts, I stopped using them ages ago. 

Overall though, the original recipe is good, aside from the lack of spice to it, and that the sauce should be doubled.

Ok, I give this a 5 star.  In looking at other folks reviews it became apparent that the recipe needed to be tripled so as to allow for enough sauce and not come out pasty...so I followed this advice and was not disappointed.

I started out with 3lbs of chicken, got some football players with big appetites.  So I followed the recipe x9...thats right.  Recipe was for 1lb of chicken, and the reviews were saying to triple, so with 3lbs of chicken I did it x9.

I was concerned as first adjusting the recipe this much, but it was outstanding.  My first concern was the about of Red Chili Paste to use, I used the whole jar which was 4oz...the heat is hard to judge as it really opens up when your cooking.  But it came out just fine, I would have preferred more heat but the younger kids wouldn't have, so it was a good balance.  I did add some fresh diced carrots, and used 2 8oz cans of diced water chestnuts, drained.

I did end up adding about 1/2 of water to the sauce as well as the marinade.  I think the only thing I will adjust in the future is eliminating the corn starch or a least trying a bit less, and trying rice wine and rice vinegar...seems in the reviews a lot of folks really like this.  The last thing I would adjust is the amount of  sesame oil.  Some of the reviews said the same thing and I agree, although it came out great, I felt that dialing down the sesame oil would bring out some of the other flavors a bit more as the sesame oil flavor was a little strong.

This was a

Only changes were to double the sauce, drastically reduce the cornstarch (I used 1 tsp total), increase the chili paste and marinade the chicken for about 4 hours.  It was delicious.  Better than restaurant quality.

LOVED it.  Tweaked it a little for more spice, and since I don't like thick, sticky sauce I reduced the cornstarch like others suggested.  Forgot to get peanuts at the store so used some almonds I had and it was fantastic!  I threw in a bag of stir fry veggies.  Made some fried rice with the Kikkoman flavor packet for a side.   Empty plates!

I used 3 chix breast And doubled the sauce ingredients except chile power and sesame oil. That yielded plenty of sauce.. Added red and some green bell peppers and a sparse amount of whole chile dried peppers chopped and seeded. Just for fun added a little chile powder and brown sugar to my peanuts before frying.  I in the past have always bought my Kung pao sauce and it can be pricey .. My husband liked this as much as store bought.... Thanks allrecipes

We've been making this exact recipe for a few years now, it's no fail and so yummy. tastes so much like the GOOD Chinese restaurant kung pao. While I usually hate when people review even though they've changed every ingredient and cooking method and still think they can review the same recipe, I will just say the ONLY change we make in this recipe is using cashews instead of peanuts and sometimes I'll add a green pepper, chopped. Whether you make those small changes or follow this recipe to a T, this is a keeper for sure! And it's worth investing in the good sesame oil and chili paste--they will last you making this dish several times over.

I would probably give this recipe 4.5 stars.  The entire family really liked it.  My wife added carrots, mushrooms and peppers to the base recipe and it was delicious.  Will definitely make again.

a dish enjoyed by the entire family but in need of some tweaks....the first thing i noted was that the sauce needed to be doubled or tripled. i also found that its better to use brown sugar instead of white because it shows up better in the flavor. and finally (this is just my opinion on what is correct) i would advise anyone who makes this dish to add in the sauce AFTER the chicken and vegetables have cooked through so that the sauce does not burn. serve with white or fried rice :D

This came out so delicious and flavoursome, but I will definitely double the sauce next time. I used 1 tablespoon sambal oelek for the chilli paste, omitted the water chestnuts, replaced the peanuts with cashews and added in some sliced white onion and 1 teaspoon grated ginger. I also made this all in one skillet - first I stir-fried the chicken until it was 70% cooked, removed it and started stir frying the garlic, onion and ginger until fragrant. Finally I stirred in the sauce with the chicken pieces for a final cook/thickening.

The description is right in stating "you can't go wrong."  The flavor of this is excellent.  I attempted to increase the sauce by doubling all the sauce ingredients.  So... I didn't actually "go wrong", but the end result was much too thick.  Adding the water/starch mix should probably be done a Tbsp at a time.  I'll be playing with this recipe.

...it was just okay, and really nothing to get excited about.  Take a look at the ingredients, and really, what you see is what you get.  There are considerably better kung pao recipes than this with a greater depth of flavor with a lot less work.

I just made this for a Chinese New Year celebration we are hosting.  We "love" this recipe, but I could only give it 4 stars because it needed some changes to get it right.  First off, do NOT use as much cornstarch as it calls for in the sauce. I had to add chicken broth to it because it was like paste rather than a nice thick sauce.  Otherwise the ingredient ratio was perfect.  I actually baked my chicken in the oven, just for ease and it's a little healthier.  I just cut it into pieces, threw them on a cookie sheet and in the oven at 350 for 15 minutes.  Perfect! I sauteed some diced green pepper, chopped carrot, diced onion and celery in my wok and then added the sauce mixture and cooked until the sauce thickened.  I added the veggies because anytime I order this at a restaurant some or all of those veggies are in the dish.  I put 3/4 of the peanuts in the sauce.  I put the baked chicken into a serving dish, poured the sauce and veggie mixture over top, gave it a good stir and used the remaining peanuts (I crushed them) sprinkled over the top to garnish, along with the scallions.  Overall this was a great recipe and I will definitely make it again.  Even my kids loved it.

The sesame oil is way too much. It leaves an aftertaste in your mouth for hours. Cut it in half.

Great recipe, very tasty. Doesn't taste like anything you get at a Chinese restaurant because Lord knows what unhealthy things they load up in their food!
I highly recommend tripling or quadrupling the sauce measurements. I doubled it and it certainly was not enough. 
Delicious served over a bed of steamed rice, I also added broccoli and onions, I recommend adding veggies.

I agree with cutting back on the Chili paste.  I actually could not find chili past so I used Sambal Oelek which says it is fresh ground chili paste.  I used about 3/4 of the chili paste and wish I had cut it back by at least 1/2.  I like hot food...this was tolerable but the heat overpowered the great taste.  My suggestion is to cut back maybe to 1/3 of the chili paste because you can always add more.  I did not use green onions as we like chunks of onion.  I added brocolli and I used cashews.  I incresased the sauce x  5 and it was just right.  O, and I decreased the corn starch by 1/3 and still added a bit of water.  Next time I'll decrease it by 1/2 and add more cornstarch mixed in water if I need too.  The only reason it got 4 vs. 5 stars from me was due to the extreme heat.  I will definately make it again!

I septupled this sauce (or something like that) and went with the more water (or less cornstarch!) suggestion, but kept the same amount of water chestnuts and it was delicious!

This recipe was fantastic. I have literally never tried my hand at asian cuisine before, so I was hopeful, but honestly the end result was just like what you'd get at a restaurant. Here are the modifications I made:

1) Marinated the chicken overnight with double the marinade recipe (I kept the sesame oil in a single portion, though)
2) Doubled the sauce recipe using vegetable oil instead of sesame oil and rice wine instead of white wine, but no cornstarch
3) Only added 1T chile paste (I was afraid of the heat!), but I'd definitely add 2-3T next time to get a kick
4) Used green beans, green onions, garlic, and cashews; none of the water chestnuts, which I don't care for
5) Removed the chicken from the marinade to brown it first, and poured the rest of the marinade into the sauce pan

Seriously - ridiculously delicious. My boyfriend is lucky I gave him so much leftover! And if you make it with only 1T chile paste like I did this time, it's enough for flavor but there's really no kick at all, so you could probably feed it to kids without a problem.

This was delicious, but I accidentally added too much chile sauce and it was too spicy. When doubling the sauce, I would recommend not doubling the chile sauce. I also didn't use cornstarch in the marinade, and omitted the peanuts altoghether. Overall, a great recipe.

We loved this for dinner last night.  Only reason I did not rate it a 5 star is because the sauce was a little too thick for what we like.  Next time I just put a little less cornstarch in it.  This was so good!  Tasted just like what I order in the Chinese restaurants without the nasty little red peppers that you have to pick out!!

I was leaning more towards 3, but I didn't have wine and couldn't find chile paste so I used chile sauce. It turned out ok. I added a lot of mushrooms and some green peppers. Might make again with wine and search harder for chile paste.

This is excellent, even better as leftovers!  I would have given it five stars, but I had to alter a bit.  I doubled the ingredients (except hot chile paste).  I added more veggies (baby corn, brocolli, cauliflour, and carrots).  Next time I will triple the soy sauce as it was missing just a little something and I think that was the key.  Other than that, this was SO good!

It was REALLY tasty but the recipe, as written, does not produce anywhere near enough sauce. I would suggest triple all ingredients if you want to stay with the recipe as written.

I cooked this for my father and husband.  They thought it was wonderful and my dad doesn't usually like rice dishes.  It seems a little thick so I added soy sauce and that was a mistake because it made it a little too salty.  I would prefer a little more sauce.

The sauce had a great flavor. I love spicy food, but I thought the chili paste amount was too much. Possibly it was the brand I used (Sambal Oelek Ground Fresh Chili Paste). I made a vegetarian version with tofu, mushrooms, broccoli, water chestnuts, & green onions.

Very good and I am terribly picky when it comes to Chinese. The only criticism I have is this is not very hot. I will most definitely make this again but with more spice!!

I made this for dinner tonight and me, my husband, and our 9 month old all loved it! Baby skipped the peanuts of course, but this was mild enough to give to him. Next time I might add a bit more spice. It could be because I didn't use chili paste (I had none) and substituted with chili sauce.

I used to always use a packet (filled with salt and msg) to make kung pao, but now that I have this recipe I never have to do that again. Thanks!

My first attempt at Kung Pao Chicken and it was good! I followed the recipe as it, however, the heat factor was not there for us, so I added some red curry paste and that added that missing heat element. Next time I try this I'll add some cut up dried hot peppers and maybe some Szechuan black peppercorns. Upon completion everyone LOVED it!!

Very good, I followed previous reviewers advice and made extra sauce. My husband and I prefer it a bit more saucy and less pasty, but it would taste excellent either way!

This recipe is fantastic! I never thought we could pull off Chinese restaurant-style food before, but this is just as good if not better. We like to do cashews instead of peanuts, and we also add chunky-chopped green bell pepper. Easy to make and absolutely delicious! We have been making it regularly ever since we discovered this great recipe.

This is really good! Really easy to make and I usually have most of the ingredients on hand. I add in stir-fry vegetables to the chicken before I add the sauce though. I also use red pepper flakes since I don't keep chili paste which works fine. Finally, I really recommend at least doubling if not tripling the sauce. Doesn't make that much as is.

I made this recipe exactlly as it was written.  I didn't care for it so much.  It was hot and that was about it.  It was just okay not great.  I will be looking for something else.  It was fun to try, but I rather have take out Kunk Pao.

Really delicious! We've made it a couple of times here and have decided it's better than the local restaurants Kung Pao Chicken. I add quite a bit more vinegar than the recipe requires, I add about 2 tablespoons, but it's mainly because I love vinegar. I would definitely recommend this recipe. Also, one small alteration that I would recommend, I had been cooking stir fry with chicken breast for a while and had always been a little disappointed with how my dishes came out, I always thought that the chicken tasted a little dry and wasn't as flavorful as stir fry from a restaurant. I've discovered (my own personal opinion) that I much much prefer using chicken thighs rather than breasts because they wind up being moister and more flavorful. I know they have more fat and seem to take me longer to cut, but I won't use anything else in my stir fry now!

Loved the recipe but doubled the marinade and tripled the sauce. I added sliced red bell peppers, sliced celery and sliced baby bok choy when sauteing the chicken. Served with toasted coconut rice and salad with asian dressing. YUMMY!

This dish is absolutely amazing - so simple, soooo delicious, and atrociously forgiving. That being said, the number one note to take here is: make six times the sauce! Seriously! Any less is a crime. I've found a way to make this MUCH easier. I saute the chicken in sesame oil or ginger and garlic, and add 1/3 cup each of sesame oil, vinegar, light soy sauce, chile paste, brown sugar, and water/cornstarch mixture; [marinating is so unecessary] and then add at least half a cup of crushed peanuts, a can of sliced water chestnuts, and top it off at the end with a palmful of chopped cilantro. I leave out the white wine and green onions. It takes less then fifteen minutes [not counting the time spent cutting the chicken!] and turns out perfect and scrumptious EVERY time. [It helps to have a little less soy, vinegar, and hot sauce, and little extra sugar]

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  It tasted nothing like kung pao chicken...not really a deal breaker if the taste is good, but in this case, the flavor was just off.  I think it might have been the huge amount of chili paste...a single flavor source really doesn't equate to much depth of flavor.  The sauce was also way to thick, it reminded me of a spicy ketchup.  I might try making this again with less corn starch, a single teaspoon of chili paste and red chili peppers, but as it stands, I did not enjoy this at all.  Sorry.

I didn't have any chili paste, so i used red pepper flake instead....  Came out a little too spicy that way.  Next time I think I'll double or triple the sauce and marinate the chicken longer.

I really made this fast and toddler friendly too without peanuts. I skipped the marinating step because it's totally unnecessary. I tripled the sauce recipe. I put the cut up chicken into the bowl of sauce for about five minutes while I sauteed half a large regular sweet onion instead of green onion because I didn't have any green onions on hand. I tossed the chicken into the saute pan after the onion was soft and cooked the chicken until it was no longer pink. Then I poured the marinade over the chicken and simmered about ten minutes before adding a tablespoon of peanut butter and a touch more brown sugar. The peanut butter took away the need for corn starch because it thickened it nicely. This came out really nice with a peanut flavor minus the crunchy peanuts which made it toddler friendly for my two year-old. Served it over brown rice with broccoli. Nice inspiration recipe. Thanks for posting it.

This was really delicious! I thought that is did not make enough sauce, so I kept adding white wine & soy sauce to increase the amount. I also wanted the color to be a little more brown so I added kitchen bouquet. It really is an easy dinner to make.

Awesome!  I added bok choy and left out water chestnuts because that's what I had in the house.  The sauce was a bit thick, but easily thinned out with a little water.  I also used boneless chicken thighs, as I like the texture in a stir-fry type dish.  Thanks for a keeper!

We loved it!  I didn't measure a thing and I floured and fried the chicken to make it crispy and so that the sauce would sink in and stick!  I added broccoli and left out the water chestnuts.  It was wonderful!  Really, really great!

I've never previously rated a recipe as I've never thought I had much to add to the many previous stellar ratings.  However, this recipe has forced me to interject an opinion.  A while back, I made this dish, tripling the sauce as suggested.  It was so bad, everyone began talking about the large lunch they'd just enjoyed.  Subsequently, we went to a restaurant and when one member of the group, who'd been present for this meal, ordered the same, several suggested rethinking based upon the prior experience.  It was terrible, sorry

I have to disagree with everyone saying it's restaurant quality. I just didn't care for it. I had 2lbs of chicken so I quadrupled the sauce recipe. I cut down on the cornstarch like suggested and added a little more chili paste. Where's the bell peppers and chili peppers? Even with 1/4 of the cornstarch the sauce was too gelatinous. I will keep looking for a good kung pao recipe.

just got up from the table with this as our dinner. we thought it was way too spicy. we even cut the paste to 1 table spoon and doubled the rest for extra sauce.  other than too spicy it was good.  next time we will try it with no paste.  sry only 3 stars

I can't agree more with the description, I used all of the ingredients but really didn't measure anything out (except the cornstarch/water) and it came out wonderfully when using chicken thighs.  I am eating it now as leftover lunch from last night's dinner and it was great then, and great now, seems spicier today, yum!!

Loved it. Pretty much doubled the recipe.  Do not cut up green onions too small.  Be sure to double the water chestnuts.  Already made it twice and it gets better each time.  Awesome.

Very good sauce with what I'd say is a medium level of spice; it doesn't strike you as particularly spicy on first bite, but you begin to notice the heat more as you eat, much like spicy Thai peanut sauce. It was more of a sticky glaze than a liquid-y sauce. My only complaint is that I doubled the sauce and still wished I'd made even more!  I had to make a few substitutions: wok oil for sesame oil, rice vinegar for white vinegar, and chopped red onion and yellow bell pepper instead of green onion and bamboo shoots.  It all blended well though and was very satisfying over white rice flavored with soy sauce, and my husband liked it so much that we had no leftovers.  I'll make it again, but more of it... thanks for the recipe!

I was a little skeptical, but I ended up loving this dish.  I am not a huge Chinese food fan, but this was tasty and just enough heat.  My husband loved it.  I would definitely make it again.

This is my husbands favorite dish when we go out, so I wanted to try it at home. This was Very good. I'd double or triple the sauce. I also added veggies...red pepper, zucchini and celery. Cooked the 5 marinated chicken breast halves, then cooked the veggies (all at high heat), then added the chicken breasts pieces back and poured the sauce over the top. Served over rice. Yum!

Good recipe but I tripled the sauce, cut the chicken in small cubes, added cubed bell pepper, onion and carrot.  Next time I will and some pineapple and make a lot more sauce.  I used regular chili paste and it was plenty hot.  Making the chicken and veggies the same size is how they serve in resataurants.

The dish was good, I didn't have any chili paste so I had to make some as best I could and the dish might have been better if I had some real chili paste and I didn't use peanuts so if I make it again, I'll try to get real chili paste.

really nice recipe!  I have tried to make many thai/asian dishes recently,  with not-so good results....this one provides a good base for a very popular dish,  but i would suggest using about three times the wet ingredients for the sauce, as the delicate vegetables can scortch easily (i used sake instead of white wine) and make sure that you have chicken stock on hand when combining the chicken with the sauce and veggies and finishing the dish, to make sure that the sauce stays loose, as this is traditionally a very saucy dish, with plenty of gravy to spoon over the rice.  Yummy!

We love this at my house. I was unable to find any hot chile paste so I had to settle for some hot chile sauce. I wouldn't say it tastes like kung pao chicken but it is VERY good. I actually like it better than kung pao chicken. We double the sauce and serve over rice. I didn't have any peanuts so I used some extra crunchy peanut butter and it was awesome. Thank you Arlena for the wonderful recipe!

I made this as a side dish to go with my lettace wraps.  I did not add any meat to it. The sauce ended up WAY too thick.  Next time I will not put so much corn starch to it.  I did double the sauce because I was serving over pasta...I should have tripled the sauce. It had good flavor....i will try again on this one with my changes...

I made it as written.  Not enough sauce, so I would suggest doubling it.  Also I'm used to kung pao chicken having cabbage in it. Regardless, overall this was pretty good for home Chinese food.

Delicious! I was out of several things so I used some chopped up almonds and a little bit of peanutbutter, I was also out of chili sauce so I used a little bit of cayenne pepper and some red pepper flakes.  I also quadrupled the sauce and used green peppers and onions in this recipe.  Thanks!

this is really great!! i changed a few things though. first i used chicken thighs instead of using the chicken breast. and then i marinated the chicken all day in the fridge. i cooked the thighs in a little a oil, and then removed from pan, and wiped out the excess oil, then made the sauce in the same pan(so i would have less dishes to do). and the suace was way too thick, so i added about `1/4 cup extra white wine, and some water. i used red pepper flakes instead, and i used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. i also didn't add the water chestnuts, because i didn't have any. i also used white sugar instaed of brown, and rice vinager. it was wonderful!! my family wants me to make this all the time for them now!! i served it over fresh white rice. i highly recomend this recipe, it is easy and tastes fabulous!!

I have made this recipe 2 times.  I did add green and red pepper.  The first time the chili paste was too hot (and we like hot food) so I added just a small spoon full the next time.  I also 3 times the sauce.  I love this recipe, definitely a keeper

I made this recipe last night for 4 people and it was to die for!!!!! I have to agree with many reviewers that you need to triple the sauce. I tripled the marinade too but probably could have just doubled that. And I only used 1 TBSP cornstarch to 1 TBSP water for both the sauce and marinade. I think this prevented me from having to add that cup of water other reviewers said they needed. (As it was I still did add about ¼ cup water as the sauce cooked) If you triple the water/cornstarch for the marinade it would be way to pasty. Next time I will cut down on the amount of chicken a little. It seemed even after tripling the sauce and marinade, the ratio of chicken to sauce was 4 to 1. And all the Kung Pao dishes we've eaten at restaurants are more like equal parts chicken to sauce/veggies. I also suggest cutting the chicken pieces into small pieces. I did what the recipe said and my chunks were a little too big. I also added one small yellow pepper, one small red pepper and one can of bamboo shoots. Next time I'll add some celery. We love the crunch this added and the veggie soaked up the sauce nicely!
We served over white Jasmine rice. This dish was to die for!!!!! I just wish there was a way to cut down on the calories. I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions?? If you do, please help. I did cut down on the peanuts I used. But I know tripling the sesame oil can't be good for you calorie-wise.  I just don’t have any idea how it would effect the overall taste if you didn’t t

This was AWESOME!! It tastes like my favorite Kung Pao Chicken dish from a local restaurant that no longer exists. The key is the chili paste, which I found at a local international grocery store. I didn't measure the ingredients very well at all and it still turned out great. I was trying to ensure that I had enough sauce because of some of the reviews I read. I had plenty. Try this recipe. I forgot to add when I first wrote this that I add some red & green bell peppers, which is what my favorite restaurant did.

I loved this recipe.  I use Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce instead of the hot chili paste.  I could have cut the amount of chili sauce in half. This chili sauce is very hot.  I did double the sauce recipe and I used plenty of extra water as this sauce was let to simmer for about 45 minutes and thicken in a separate sauce pan.  After cooking the chicken just before serving I tossed the simmered sauce over the chicken. This was very good.

Wow. As others suggessted I tripled the marinate and quadrupled the sauce. Instead of water chestnuts I used onions and chopped baby carrots. I didn't have peanuts, so I sauted the onions, chili paste, carrots and garlic in oil and 1T of peanut butter. I served over steamed Jasmine rice, really, really good.

We found this somewhat lacking in flavour & too sweet. I needed to add quite a bit of spices to liven in up. Too much cornstarch in the sauce too, made it almost jelly like.

Delicious and easy!  I 5x the sauce (only 2x sesame oil and kept cornstarch as written) and that was the perfect "sauciness" to serve over jasmine rice.  In addition, I added baby corn  and white onion, but you could add any of your favorite veggies.  As for the heat, just mix all the ingredients for your sauce and add chili paste to taste.  I added the cold sauce directly to the pan once chicken was almost done.  Also, definitely have a cup or so of water, wine or broth to thin the sauce as it heats.  Will definitely be making again!

I love Chinese food, and I have been searching for years for just one recipe that I can make at home that tastes good.  This is the one!  I did triple the marinade and the sauce (except for the oil and peanuts).  I also added an extra can of water chestnuts and I added a can of baby corn.  It was great, and I will make it often. YUM!

This was great! The only thing I changed was using vegetable broth instead of white wine because I didn't have any wine around. I don't think it suffered. I would definitely make this again.

This was really good, had a nice heat to it as I expected. I thought I really messed up, because the sauce thickend too quickly and got gloppy, but I added the chicken pieces right in along with the marinade and a little water as needed and it turned out great anyway. I am impressed! I'll make this again and again. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Very good recipe.  My only changes were to use rice wine vinegar instead of distilled and to use a little corn starch to thicken the sauce.  I also omitted the water chestnuts and added more green onion.  Will make again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is a great recipe!  I did double the sauce because it's more flavorful over rice and I left out the nuts because we just don't like nuts in our food.  I used chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts because they're more juicy.  I'm going to try adding mushrooms and possibly other veggies next time.

Very good, though definitely lacks the kick the dish has at Chinese
restaurants.  I've cooked this multiple times, and plan to continue in the
future. I agree with the other reviewers about preferring to 1.5x or 2x
the sauce mixture (but don't change the cornstarch).  It does need more
sauce and to be more liquidy.  I do increase the chile paste somewhat.
(Another review suggested not increasing the chile paste when increasing
the sauce or doubling the recipe.  I disagree because if you leave it out
it becomes more bland.  But this may have to do with the particular chile
paste you have; I use Thai Kitchen Roasted Red Chile Pepper Paste.) 
Also, while the recipe suggests heating the sauce then cooking the chicken then
mixing the two, I simply cook the chicken then add the sauce and heat it
together.  This saves pans.

this recipe was tasty, but not for kung pao chicken.  i followed the recipe exactly, and the sauce was all wrong...way too thick and pasty.  next time, i will use red pepper flakes instead of the hot chili paste, and way less cornstarch.

I honestly could not WAIT to rate this recipe. This was FANTASTIC! I LOVE Chinese food, however my husband does not care for it. He will be a sport and eat it if I have to have it and I have been craving it so bad lately. We have two kids and dont always have the money to eat out so I made this last night and we both ate and ate until I had to go lay down, I was so full!! HE ATE MORE THEN I DID! He said it was the "best" he ever had and I could make this anytime. I doubled the sauce recipe and had to add 1/2 cup of water to thin it out a little, it got to thick with the cornstarch and I only added one tablespoon to my double batch of sauce. I also could not find Chile Paste at my local Walmart (go figure) ;) so I substituted one tbsp of red pepper flakes and it couldve use a little more then that. Wonderful flavor and so quick and easy to make!! I could make this any day of the week. Fantastic recipe and thanks so much for sharing! I served this with the Crab Rangoons III on this site - Cant wait to make this for company! Thanks!!!

As a starter recipe this is great. But the real fun and taste comes from the extra stuff you can add. For the sauce I mixed one can of Chicken Broth with two tablespoons of Cornstarch (as suggested by another reviewer)...this was awesome! I also added in Broccoli, Cauliflower, and Carrots to the chicken when it was done cooking....then added on top of that the sauce. I also used black and red pepper seasoning as my spice, to taste, and it was great! Have fun with this one...its a good recipe.

This recipe had great flavor but it needed some serious alterations. I followed the recipe and the sauce came out pasty and goopy. So after adding water and a lot more of the sauce ingredients (except cornstarch) it was really good. Also, I couldn't find the hot chile paste so I used crushed red pepper, which worked just fine.

The flavor was god, but the sauce was to thick it turned almost like a paste. I have to add a lot more of soyce sauce and it was OK. I did not add the chili paste, instead some dry chili and was ok.The marinade is messy beacuse when I cook it the starch from a paste. There is just to much starch to me, maybe she was meaning teaspoons instead of tablespoons? Definally this recipe is a good starting point, but you have to do many changes to really make it work!

This is an excellent recipe. Very flavorful! I doubled the whole recipe,(with the exception of the water chestnuts),but only tripled the sauce recipe. Next time, I will make more sauce. I also subtituted chili & garlic sauce, and added red peppers. I didn't have any green onions on hand, so I just used a regular yellow onion. I also used the "lightly salted" peanuts and reduced sodium soy sauce as recommended in an earlier review. Thanks for an excellent and easy recipe.

This recipe is VERY hot.  I can usually eat this in restaurants, but this recipe is 10 times hotter and I even halved the chili paste like suggested.  This is the first recipe I've made that was to hot for even my husband.  I will not make this again.  I don't think this was meant for human consumption!

Great recipe.  Very flavorful.  I added carrots and bell pepper to give it a broader range of flavors and textures.  It costs more to make than it would to buy it at any of a dozen Chinese restaurants near my home, but I'm sure it's a lot lower in fat when I make it myself.

Does anyone know if you're supposed to drain the water chestnuts before using them in the recipe?  I didn't feel like my sauce was nearly thick enough when I made it.

I made this recipe with cashews instead of peanuts and serve it with rice noodles, it was delicious!  Even my brother, who doesn't like spicy food, loved it!!

Make this recipe; you will not be disappointed! As with other reviews, I made sure to add water to the sauce as it cooked. I also added some broccoli to the chicken. It’s so delicious, I want to make it again and again!

This is a good recipe and I would make it again.  The only thing I would suggest is to make more sauce, and not add the scallions until right at the end of cooking.  They were kind of soggy and didn't keep their crisp texture.

Very tasty, but really needed way more sauce.  I added a thinly sliced onion when the chicken was nearly finished sautéing.

I added more peanuts than it asked for and also used peanut oil instead of sesame oil because I couldn't fine it in my local grocery store. Either way it was super delicious over a bed of white rice!!!

I gave it a 4 star rating only because I feel the measurements are  off. I used all the ingredients listed but used measurements to my liking. 

Like others I tripled the marinade and quadrupled the sauce and didn't add corn starch to the sauce. I also thought it needed way more spice. Kung pao is supposed to be spicy. I also added more sugar. 

Thank you for sharing the recipe with us. 

With my changes even my picky  eater husband liked it.

We are vegetarian, so I used tofu, red pepper, mushrooms, onion, water chestnuts, peapods and quadrupled the sauce. That sauce rocked. Definitely restaurant quality or better. Thank you!  I’ll make this often. My daughter loved it too.

I like my Kung Pao with Veggies in it -- so I chopped up a Zucchini and Yellow Squash (from our Garden) and TRIPLED the Sauce (Hubby likes lots of Sauce). I added a TBSP of Oyster Sauce and a Tbsp of Crushed Red Pepper Flakes for added flavor. We both enjoyed it and I have a dish leftover for Lunch next week!!

This is one of my favorite Asian dishes to make. It is very easy to put together and always ends up tasting fantastic. The only modification I make is I add 4oz of chili paste because I like it extra spicy.

The recipe didn't specify how many servings it included but I had to quadruple it to get enough for my 5 member family.  Whenever you multiply a recipe by four, you lose some of the intended flavor.  Not everything should get multiplied, like the chili paste for instance.  It is a keeper in my house, however, and I will make it again and fine tune which ingredients to quadruple and which to only double, etc.   I will add some ginger next time for a little extra punch.  Also wondering how necessary the marinade process is.  But my family gave it two thumbs up.

Very good.

After the sauce was made I added a bit more chili paste since I like more heat.  But other than that, the recipe was good as is.

Lovely video. Suggestions: don't chop the peanuts. Restaurants don't. Buy raw peanuts, or cocktail peanuts or unsalted dry roasted peanuts. (In contrast, regular & lightly salted dry roasted peanuts have added flavorings that would be inappropriate here.) Slice the scallions on a steep bias. Use plain, unseasoned rice vinegar instead of distilled white vinegar. (Seasoned rice vinegar just adds sweeteners & too much salt.) If you don't want to buy a bottle of perishable wine just to get two tablespoons for the recipe, use shelf-stable Mirin or sherry instead, which can then be saved for future use. Omit the brown sugar. And use skinless/boneless chicken thighs (or, more tediously, a pound & a half of regular thighs with skin and bones, to yield about a pound of cubes & chunks). BTW, the member photo of the version with the baby corn added looks delicious.

Overall an excellent recipe and just as good as any I have had in restaurants. There are several changes that I made which really improved the overall recipe. I added 1 onion chopped and half a broccoli stir fried them first with water chestnuts and also switched the chicken for pork tenderloin. I also found that the sauce recipe should be doubled. I also agree with other reviews that you should be careful with the amount of sesame seed oil used especially in the sauce.

This was pretty good!  Both my husband and I enjoyed it.  I wouldn't say it's exactly like what we get in restaurants, but definitely worth making at home.  Like other's suggested, I tripled the sauce, probably could have gotten away with just doubling it.  I didn't have time to marinate the chicken in the sauce, so just cooked up in the pan with the marinade, and added to the sauce.  Beware of your sesame oil, the one we purchased had a very strong smoky flavor, or maybe they all have this, but I will try a different brand next time.  I recommend and will make again.

I thought this was pretty close to my favorite Chinese restaraunt. I have made it twice and both times my husband ate it. He's not a fan of any Asian cuisine. 
The recipe was easy to follow and requires few ingredients. When I search for recipes I look for recipes that do not require 20 ingredients that I'll never use again. This was perfect. The only thing I had to get that I don't usually have is the chile paste, but I will definitely keep it on hand now. The flavor and spice were perfectly balanced. The sauce was thick and I did add water and let simmer before serving.

Absolutely delicious. I had to add about a cup of chicken broth to the mixture in the skillet in order to have a sauce. Mine was much too thick. I have not been able to locate hot chili paste, so substituted a healthy squirt of sriracha instead. I mistakenly put in 1 tablespoon (not teaspoon) of the vinegar (I used roasted garlic rice vinegar), so increased the brown sugar to a scant tablespoon. For the wine I used cooking sherry, which I had on hand.
This was absolutely delicious. We ate it over orzo, though of course brown rice would be a healthier choice. This went straight to the top of our favorites.

Very good dish.  From other reviewers' comments I doubled the marinate and sauce.  In fact, with the sauce, it was doubled and then I added extra water so there would be plenty and it was perfect.  I didn't have hot chili paste so I made my own: I finely chopped 4 serrano chilies and sautéed in 1 tbsp. olive oil for 5 min. and added 1 minced garlic clove and simmered for 10 more min., stirring often on low heat.  Remove from heat and add 1/2 tsp. vinegar.  This makes enough for several batches of Kung Pao Chicken as I used just 2 tsp. of this for the sauce and labeled and froze the rest.  My son, who is a captain in the Marines and loves spicy Asian food,  was home for Christmas, and loved it.  Thanks Arlena

This tasted nothing like Kung Pao Chicken from a restaurant, but it's a pretty tasty dish in its own right. I doubled the amount of sauce and reduced the chile paste by 25%. Even with the reduction in chile paste, it still came out very spicy, so be careful if you don't like your food to be really spicy!

Decent enough flavours. Curious as to why all of the ingredient measurements are in tsp or tbsp and the chili sauce is in ounces. That threw me off in the middle of my prep. I included a heaping tsp of sambal oelek only in fear of it being too hot. I could have added 3 or 4 tsp I think. We had it over paleo cauliflower rice from this site. Great combo. Thanks Arlena

Awesome recipe. Maybe read some of the reviews for some simple changes like quadrupling the ingredients ??, but other than that, this was and has been a favourite of my family since the first time I made it. Very flavourful. Enjoy!!

Really enjoyed the flavour of this recipe. I only gave it a 4 because I didn't think there was enough sauce and a litte heavy on the garlic. I tripled the sauce and found it enough.  I made it with rice and stir fried some veggies separately. This is a keeper. Thanks for the great recipe.

Would not make this again.
Tastes too much of soy sauce and peanuts.
A bit disappointed with the results, but certainly edible and ok as written.

I purchased all of the ingredients for this dish and followed other reviewers advise of doubling the recipe for the marinade and the sauce.  The only changes I made were to add yellow pepper and broccoli as others had done. Hated it. The only flavor was spice and I LOVE a spicy dish, Kung Pao being one of my favorites, but this had no other flavor at all. It definitely needed more salt or say sauce, I added salt because it was so tasteless. I gave it two stars because the chicken was ok.

Me & picky kids loved this!  I consider myself a "beginner" cook and found this an easy dish to make with a lot of good flavor!  I had to make a few substitutions because I didnt have it all on hand.  Instead of green onions, I used onion flakes.  Instead of fresh garlic I used granulated garlic.  Did not have water chestnuts so had to omit.  Sauce does get thick and I added water a few times, but still came out yummy!  Served over brown rice.

Nice marinade and sauce.  I made a few additions by increasing all sauce quantities by ~50%, and sauteing some chopped celery and cabbage in the same manner as the chicken and throwing that into the pan with everything else.

Tastes great! I had a thanksgiving party and everyone loved it. I used cooking wine as white wine, chilli with black beans as hot chille paste, and Chinese vinegar as white vinegar. In recipes, cooking doesn't need oil, but I added anyway. I didn't discard the marinade.

Without a doubt, this is a fantastic dish. The flavor is delectable and the ease is appealing. My wife put it in our "make again" box with a double star which denotes "at least every other month." We'll see about that as there are many more dishes I plan to attempt and conquer. Great Recipe!

Agree with other reviews, add water or it will be to thick. Flavor is spot on amazing! I sometimes cheat and use popcorn chicken that I deep fried and then put into the sauce. Just as yummy and it has nice texture. Will make again and again... :)

So happy to finally find a simple and delicious Kung Pao recipe.  I've tried dozens of recipes over the years and was always disappointed.  I follow this recipe exactly and it's great every time.  The hot chile paste takes all those complicated and harder to find items typical to Kung Pao, and brings them together into one simple ingredient.

this recipe has ruined us for every chinese take out of Kung Pao. We always get Kung Pao when eating at a chinese restaurant (shrimp, chicken, tofu) and even in the high end, sit down, hot towel, type of restaurants it has NEVER compared to the perfection of this recipe I just made at home. OMG. 
I doubled the marinade, and the sauce (per other reviewers suggestions). I used chicken thighs (had it in the freezer). I also sauteed some celery and broccoli in some hot chili oil before adding the marinated chicken to saute. I also used whole peanuts instead of crushed (my favorite). 
I think next time I may back down a tad on the chili paste because it was pretty spicy - but I served it with a Virginia semi-sweet Rose wine and it was perfection. 
The hubby told me he had never had a better Kung Pao period. Can't wait to try it with Tofu or Shrimp next.

Wow!  I did not expect this recipe to be so wonderful--it seemed too easy.  I have made many versions of Kung Pao Chicken over the years.  Usually the spice comes from dried red peppers.  In this recipe, the red chili paste (I used a Thai red chili paste) gives the dish more depth.  Based on other reviews, I did double the amount of sauce which I really liked but it was more of a personal preference. Best Kung Pao I have ever had or made!

It's delicious! Loved this!!  Only one suggestion.  Add a little white vinegar a small pinch more of brown sugar for that restaurant taste and some color from red or green bell peppers ; it'll give it that addictive  kick.

I started with a little more than a pound of chicken. I made the marinade as described but halved the oil, and let it marinate for a couple of days. I added two sliced zucchini and half a pound of sliced mushrooms when I made the sauce. I doubled the amount of sauce because I had added so many veggies, but halved the oil there, too. To go along with the doubled sauce and added veg, I also doubled the green onions and added 50% peanuts. I used a total of 1 tablespoon Huy Fong chili garlic paste (I didn't weigh it to see if it was an ounce). It turned out really well.

Really yummy :) I doubled the sauce and used apple juice instead of white wine as I didn't have any and it turned out great. I also added a bit more sugar but that's only my preference. Recipe is great as it is :)

I have made this recipe several times. It is authentic & awesome! My vegetarian daughter substitutes Soy chicken with the same excellent results. I have served it over rice noodles & brown rice-both are great.Will be combining this dish with some spring rolls & salad for dinner party soon. Also, Naan bread goes well with it for bread lovers. I used CHICKEN THIGHS instead of breasts as more flavor!
Thank-you Arlena!

Our family loves this dish.  We also agree that you should triple the sauce.  We back off on the hot sauce and the heat still comes through.  Would definitely recommend thist to those who don't like a lot of vegetables in your Kung Pao.

The peanuts should have been pre-toasted prior to their addition to the sauce. This dish did not live up to my expectations and we certainly will look for an alternative recipe!

Probably not fair to rate this recipe, as I did change it some.  However, I stayed faithful to the marinade minus the corn starch and I added a dash of chili oil - but I used shrimp instead of chicken.  Same thing with the sauce, I left out the starch and added a little chili oil, and since I didn't have chili paste I subbed thai chili sauce.  I left out the starch because of the complaints that the sauce was too thick.  I also doubled the sauce.  Added more veggies, hot peppers, and red pepper flakes (we like things REALLY hot around here).  Loved it and will make it again.

We love chinese food and have takeaways quite often ,we had a lovely kung po chicken once in a restuarant and since then no matter how may places we have tried we have never had one as good.....until tonight.I cooked this recipe for tea ,I couldnt follow the recipe word for word as I had no brown sugar or distilled white vinegar so I used white sugar and rice vinegar.We are not keen on waterc hestnuts so added mushroom and red pepper instead.
It was so tasty I wont be bothering with a takeaway again xx

I used 8oz can of water chestnuts in liquid and added all to sauce which helped it from getting too thick. I added 2tbsp of hot pepper paste to sauce, doubled marinade and wish I had doubled sauce, cook with 2 chicken breasts,  served with fried rice. Bought hot pepper paste online bc I live in the sticks!

This is a keeper! I doubled the marinade & the sauce. only using 1 ounce of chili paste for the entire sauce portion, I cant imagine doubling the chili paste as well, It was the perfect spicy heat. Added broccoli, & red peppers slices. Served  over brown rice.

My husband's new favorite recipe - he said 'at the Chinese restaurants you never know what you're getting and each restaurant is different, but since we made this at home, I know exactly what went in it, and it's awesome'.  Used a 5 ounce can of water chestnuts because that's the size they seem to come in (and to double was too much), hot sesame oil for a little heat with a few shakes of crushed red pepper and doubled the liquid portions of the sauce.  I also threw the peanuts in at the very last second because I like them crunchy and not mushy.  Served with brown rice.

I agree with most other reviews: double the marinade and sauce. At least. I left out the cornstarch in the marinade. I did not get this part of the recipe as the cornstarch I have will not work without heat, so why would you put it in the marinade? I used 5 chicken breasts and added some brocolli to it. I left out the water chestnuts. I replaced the peanuts with cashews which have a richer flavor in my opinion. Be careful not to add to much water, it will not taste good. The sauce is supposed to be quite thick. It tasted delicious and everyone love it.

I don't know. I thought it was OK. Not bad or anything, not great, and not even close to some of the best Kung Pao I have made. I willl keep looking. It's a one time recipe for me.

This is better than takeout and is one of our favorite dishes to make!  Like other reviewers, I double the sauce, however, do not double the chili paste.  I made this mistake the first time I made the dish and it was almost unedible (and my husband and I love spicy food).  I also omit the cornstarch/water mixture. The sauce thickens nicely on its own and this step is just extra work.  I use low-sodium soy sauce and lightly salted peanuts.  This helps to lower the sodium, although Kung Pao Chicken at a typical Chinese restaurant is very salty.

Wow watch how much chili paste you use otherwise it's very burn your mouth hot. i also would advise doubling the sauce because there wasn't much to go over the chicken. it was very good though. Loved the flavor.

Have made this several times with only a few minor modifications because we like it HOT! Boneless skinless thighs instead of dry breasts.
Instead of chile paste, I use dried crushed red Thai peppers about a teaspoon. Instead of white vinegar, I use rice vinegar. Cane sugar instead of brown, cashews instead of peanuts (cause I don't like'em). I also add thinly sliced carrots & celery... it takes it to a whole nuther' level. 
YUMMM!

Very good---but EXTREMELY PASTY!!!  I had to add a lot of water to the sauce (almost a cup)  From doing that, it definitely took away some flavor.  Had to add more chili paste.  Next time I make this, definitely will not use so much cornstarch.  And will add more peanuts :)  But overall....yum!!!!!!

This was delicious. I used chicken stock instead of the wine, and only 1 tablespoon cornstarch (in the sauce, not the marinade. I cut the recipe in half, but kept the marinade and sauce ingredients the same. Used a bit of crunchy peanut butter instead of the peanuts, since I didn't have any on hand. Added some broccoli...this was just what I was craving for Asian food tonight!

Definitely double the sauce! I also used some leftover chicken stock to thin the sauce when it got too thick cooking.

Very good - I did not have any wine, so I used a bit of chicken stock instead.  I also used only one pan - sauteed the chicken then added the sauce.

This is excellent.  We stayed pretty true to the recipe, just used chicken broth for wine, rice vinegar for white, and made 5x the sauce like many have suggested.  Also added mushrooms, broccoli and red bell peppers.  Thanks so much for sharing.

Delicious and simple.  I prefer to add some veggies (last night made it with zucchini, celery, and red bell peppers).  It's easy to sub in beer or broth instead of the wine, and you can use other vinegars (seasoned rice vinegar, yum!)

Fabulous! Some people dinged this recipe for not having sufficient sauce but I think that's unfair. The proportions of sauce ingredients are just right and easy to multiply for a larger quantity of sauce. I could see right away that there wouldn't be enough so I tripled it. The only things I did differently ingredients-wise was to add cayenne (we like it HOT) and when I put the sauce on the stove, the consistency was too thick for our liking so I added about half a cup of water. The flavor was excellent and this is a pretty healthy recipe, so I give it a thumbs-up!

Meh.  Other than "spicy" this dish really lacks depth of flavor.  Possibly because I had to add so much water to combat the thickening from all of the cornstarch.  I may add a dollop of peanut butter to the leftovers in hopes of making this a little more interesting.

Made this and it was wonderful. Better than the restaurants I have been to. I doubled the sauce as I like my dishes more on the saucy side. I also added red pepper flakes for more heat and instead of white vinegar, I added rice vinegar. DELICIOUS! Will determinately make this again.

This was pretty good...kids didn't love it but hubby did.  I added about one cup of water, per another reviewer and think next time I will not add quite so much.  I think I may have watered down the taste too much.  Good flavor even though!  Will make again

One of the few recipes that have lived up to the hype of the reviews!  I will need to fine tune the spice level to our desired taste as it was too hot when made 5x as recommended by other reviewers.

This is very good!  I didn't have water chestnuts, so added brocolli instead.  I also cooked the chicken in the marinade.  Very tasty.  The whole family liked it.  Will make this again!

Very good. Don't see the need to multiply the sauce recipe. I used boneless thigh pieces - (they are cheaper and have more flavour). Tip the leftover marinade into the sauce and put the lid on and the quantity will be good. Easily enough for 2 adults and 2 children when served with veggies and rice.

My husband loved this and said it was the best thing I have ever made. That inspired me to write a review. It was also the spiciest thing I have ever made. I followed reviewers' advice and made more - about triple the recipe. Also I started with cooked (rotisserie) chicken. It was good but next time I won't triple the chile paste - I'd like the other flavors to come through more. I added carrots and red peppers at the beginning, ginger and mushrooms with the cooked chicken and some broccoli at the end (let it steam on top for the last 3 minutes).

So delicious! I omitted all the corn starch & water, doubled the marinade and used 5x all ingredients for the sauce as previously suggested. Used some of the chicken to whip up a quick fried rice for the kids. Everyone is happy! Thank you for the recipe! :)

I thought this recipe was excellent! I tripled the sauce and added broccoli, but otherwise followed it exactly, and both my husband and I loved it. We both preferred this as a fresh alternative to the greasy takeout version. The chicken was tender and juicy and the sauce very flavorful. Definitely give this one a try.

This was delicious! I doubled the marinade and sauce recipes and had to use chili garlic sauce instead of the chili paste (none available in my area) and it was PERFECT! Just the right spice level:) Amber likes her chicken spicy (haha, Seinfeld anyone?)

This is as close to the REAL DEAL as you can get! I couldn't find water chestnuts and used the "Rooster Brand" chili sauce instead. I think because of these 2 changes I made, the dish was a little too salty for my taste. Next time I make it, I will use less soy sauce as the Rooster brand chili sauce is salted already.... should have thought about that before I made the marinade and the sauce... but still very good recipe and really easy to prepare.

This was seriously HOT. Next time I'll use 1/4 of the chili paste and go from there. We like hot food but this was too spicy to eat. Needs veggies: carrots, snap peas, etc.

This recipe has been my favorite so far. I really don't waiver from the original but I usually double it up for some leftovers! The one thing I do different is add a 16oz bag of stir fry towards the end of cooking the chicken.

This is good.  I tripled the sauce without increasing the sesame oil like everyone said.  I made it too spicy for my taste.  I made it again and liked it so much better fried.  I put an egg over the chicken and mixed it in.  Then rolled it in a 1/2 cup cornstarch & 1/4 cup flour mix.  I fried it in 2-3 cups of oil in a wok for about 2 mins. I served it with Jasmine Rice. Yummy!!

It is as good as it is spicy and it was REALLY spicy!  I didn't have the paste so I just used hot sauce...wow, not a great idea.  The consistency and the rest of the flavors were perfect though!  Will definitely make again.

This is a pretty good recipe at face value. As far as accuracy is concerned compared with local Chinese places, I can't shake the feeling that it's missing something in terms of flavor. It's just not as strong as I'd hoped it would be. Perhaps it needs Hoisin or oyster sauce? I'm not sure, I'll try that in the future. I also added red and green peppers as I thought they were essential for the Kung Pao experience. The consistency of the sauce is perfect. But once you combine the chicken and the sauce, for some reason it loses that stir-fry quality to it because you're basically just adding chicken to a simmering broth. Next time I'll put everything in the wok at the same time. All in all, still a great recipe, thanks!

Served this at a dinner party.  Was a real hit!  No leftovers.  I sub'd chicken thighs & cashews.  Was  a little on the warm side, but was great!

Oh yummy. Loved this very much.  Doubled the marinade and tripled the sauce.  Ran out of of soy sauce so added a little teriyaki, and it was good!  After making sauce and adding to the chicken, I used the sauce pan to cook some broccoli with butter and garlic and added to dish.  My extremely picky 5 year old actually loved the cooked chicken with NO sauce (just the marinade).  Definitely restaurant quality.

I'm just learning to cook, so I decided to make it in my slow cooker instead of sautéing. I just stirred all the liquids/spices into the crock pot & put the chicken on top; I didn’t even cut it up first. I used thighs because that's what I had in the fridge. Also, I used half the can of water chestnuts & added half a can of bean sprouts (which I added to the pot in the last 30 minutes of cooking). It was great over rice, and also over whole wheat spaghetti noodles! It was still just as good for leftovers. 30 minutes = 2 hours on high, or 4 hours on low.

This really should be 4 stars, but im giving it 5 because my mother went crazy over it. I thought it was just okay. Reminded me of peanut-butter chicken. I doubled everything (except water chestnuts) after reading other reviews. It was good, but nothing special. A bit too sweet too.

This recipe had good flavor, but I didn't have green onion at home, so I omitted, but feel it would have given the recipe a better flavor.  Definitely needed salt when done.  I couldn't find the chile paste, so I substituted ketchup with cayenne pepper which still gave it nice heat.

Pretty tasty BUT next time i will make a few tweaks! My boyfriend and I made it as the recipe states, however we did triple the sauce and used a little less cornstarch to avoid the thickening problem others have mentioned. The end result was good, the consistency turned out wonderfully but the flavor was off. It seemed kinda sour or maybe too sweet. So for next time I plan to use a little less vinegar than called for and a bit less sugar! Also, careful on the chili paste it was very very spicy (luckily we like it that way!).

We've made LOTS of kung pao in our day and I loved this recipe.  next time, out of personal prefernce though, I'll make more of the sauce because we like it "saucier".  Great recipe! Thanks!

Good sauce, but I tripled it, and there still wasn't any extra to pour over the rice.  Also, I just used some left over rotisserie chicken and didn't bother marinating it, and it was still very good and much faster!

Awesome, loved it! I didn't have any wine, because i drank it all. So I subbed rice wine vinegar. Didn't put any nuts because I wasn't in the mood for that texture. Really loved it. Definately a keeper.

Very good. My husband developed a love for this dish from Pf changs. We no longer live near one and he hasn't be able to find an acceptable substitute with any of the local restaurants.  I made this for him and he likes it much better than any take out.

Really Good Chicken.  I did a few things different.  I couldn't find chile paste, so I just used a few teaspoons of sweet chili sauce and that worked well.  I omitted both the peanuts and the water chestnuts just because of personal preference.  I, like others, tripled mostly everything, but I only doubled the corn starch to avoid the sauce getting too thick. Also, I misread the recipe, and I didn't see that the chicken needed sauteed before adding to the sauce.  I just warmed the sauce and dumped the marinated chicken in it and let it all cook at the same time.  It tasted great and saved a pan.  We served this with pork fried rice and it made a fantastic meal.

Fantastic recipe!  I made this tonight for dinner to rave reviews from my husband - no more expensive take out for us!  I had to make a couple of changes, though, due to lack of ingredients, so here's what I did.  I had some already cooked chicken and cubed that up, so I couldn't marinate the chicken.  So, I took all the ingredients for the marinade and the sauce and mixed them together.  I substituted water for the wine, apple cider vinegar for the white vinegar and garlic powder for the fresh garlic.  I also left out the cornstarch completely as I wanted a sauce that would soak into the rice I served.  I used a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables, added the cooked chicken to heat through after the veggies were done, then poured the sauce over all.  A great recipe and a definite keeper at our house!  Thank you so much!!

Not good. The cornstarch slurry turned it into a thick mess and no matter how much water I added it did not thin. I won't make again.

This recipe requires quite a bit of ingredients but it was all stuff I had in the pantry.  The sauce is rich, spicy, and with a sweet peanutty flavor. This was good. I added extra pepper and less peanuts to ours. My family loved this .

Was alright but not great. 1 oz of chili paste was way way too hot even for my husband who likes spicy food. I tripled the sauce but NOT the chili paste to be sure we had plenty for the rice. Will try this recipe again with some alterations.

Really, really good.  I marinated the chicken overnight.  Made about 2ce as much sauce, encorporated 1/4 c ea of thinly sliced baby carrots, china peas and chunks of green pepper into the stir fry stage.  I added 2T of red pepper pod chunks toward the end of frying before the sauce.  My husband is a huge fan of restaurant Thanks for sharing it.

This really is like restaurant quality all around.  I would suggest however to bump up the servings as it does seem a little unproportioned?  Great served over rice, cause rice is nioce!

This was really, really, really, good! My entire family all had wonderful things to say. The only thing I did differently was cut back on the chilli paste. Our family likes food that is pretty spicy. However, and ounce of this seemed like a bit too much. My children have requested that I make this dish again. Hopefully as my four year old get a bit older we can make this with all of the spice intended.

This was a really good recipe! My bf was craving some Chinese takeout but we're trying to save some money.  I pulled this recipe up and had just about everything I needed to make it (minus the chile paste and water chestnuts).  The prep was very easy and it didn't take long to cook.  The only thing I did differently was add sliced carrots to the chicken while it marinated and cooked them with the chicken as well. I served this over brown rice.  Thanks for a great recipe!

this was great! we just ate it by itself with a fruit salad. plenty spicy for me, maybe a bit too much for my husband, but he's wimpy when it comes to spice ;) next time i plan on putting lo mein or fried rice in a bowl and topping with this, just like our favorite chinese chain and their panda bowls!

I made this last night for dinner and it was great!  I substituted the regular vinegar with rice vinegar and used rice wine instead of white wine in the marinade.  I also used Sri Racha's chili-garlic paste that gave it a really nice kick!  Just be careful with the cornstarch since I had to add a little more water while cooking so it wouldn't become too gooey.  As a guide, I've always used two tablespoon water to one tablespoon cornstarch since it tends to thicken quite a bit.  It's still a great recipe and will make it again!

This was delicious!  I would tone down the heat a bit next time; I bought an Asian hot chili paste that was super hot, and we would have enjoyed the flavors better if I had used a bit less.  It was a lot of prep time (longer than the 30 minutes listed here).

My first attempt at making this was a pure success.  After reading other reviews and the changes... I went with tripling the recipe (I'm feeding 3 boys) and only made sure to have a couple cups of water next to the saute pan while simmering the sauce because it does thicken easily due to the corn starch.  DELISH.  Plus being able to drink the remainder of the wine was a perk too.  ;-)

Yum!  This is a fabulous recipe!  You can "tweak" it as you please.  I added broccoli & onions & of course doubled the sauce.  So easy!

This was good, it was just too spicy for me.  Usually I add more spice...so I am not sure what was wrong.  I think the 1 oz of chili sauce caught me off guard.  1 tblspoon would be enough.  I also doubled the sauce.    Don't get me wrong, it was good....just overpowering with the spice.

This was really good.  Both my husband and I enjoyed it. My daughter who loves chips and hot sauce found this a little too hot for her (go figure). I did use hot chili sauce instead of the paste because it was all i had on hand and flour instead of corn starch.

Personally, I liked the result...my wife was a bit 'meh' on it.  The coloring of the final dish is a bit offsetting for some reason...and the taste wasn't phenomenal...but it was good and was a quick dish to prepare.

This is delicious!  Sadly, we have a sesame allergy in our home so can't use that oil but the rest is terrific.  Sesame oil really adds SO much to dishes!  Love Kung Pao--thanks for sharing this!

This was good but nothing great!  I love chinese food and I was really looking forward to this but there wasn't a heat factor that I normally find in kung pao dishes.

I am in love with this dish.  I made this for about 10 people (served with white rice) and got rave reviews, truly amazing dish.  I had some picky eaters and they loved it.  I used Mirin instead of wine, used rice vinegar and added bamboo shoots along with chopped chestnuts.  Like most, I did double the marinate & sauce but left out cornstarch in the marinate. So good…

Very good basic recipe. I made a few adjustments which i feel made the dish much better (to my taste). I doubled the sauce. I dont carry wine so i used apple cider vinegar (diluted). I also used a little less sesame oil b/c of the overwhelming taste and smell of sesame oil. Added mushrooms, sweet snow peas, and green and red bell peppers. I didn't have chili paste so i used chili garlic sauce which i had on hand. Fresh vegetables really give the sauce and over all dish a tasty kick. Adjust oils and vinegars to your liking and this recipe is actually pretty good!

I doubled the sauce as I added lots of snowpeas. I used 1 tbsp of arrowroot powder instead of cornstarch as a thickener and the sauce had a nice consistency. The flavour was okay. I think it needed something else..I am not sure what. If I make it again, I will sautee the garlic, scallions and dried chilli peppers in a hot wok with the sesame oil before adding the liquid ingredients. While it was not like any kung pao I have ever had, it was a quick and nutritious weekday meal.

I am sorry to say we were disappointed with this meal.  I followed the recipe and it just tasted horrible to me and my husband.  I think the sesame oil did it, but all in all it just didn't taste like kung pao.  We ended up tossing the majority down the sink and ate my son's corn dogs instead.

I've enjoyed cooking Asian recipes at home before, but this one didn't quite make the grade for us. I'm thinking it might have been the wine, but perhaps too much sesame oil. Not enough sugar? I made as specified but multiplied by about 5, I know tastes differ but I can't believe as written would be enough sauce for anyone. I may go back and follow some of the alterations in other reviews but will probably try another variation, thanks for sharing though we always enjoy trying new recipes :)

I never tried to cook Chinese at home because it just seemed like too much work and I knew it wouldn't turn out as good as our favorite restaurant's version... BUT, this is wonderful!!! I like to make this when we have guests over, and it's a hit every time!  But; Don't combine to many servings when you cook - it will make the recipe a little gummy.  Just cook a couple smaller portions (doubling it works fine) separately and you still have an amazing dish!

The amount of sauce that you actually get from what this recipe calls for isn't enough to cover the rice.  I always double the amount of sauce.  This has become a regular on our menu!

To say this is a popular dish in our household would be an understatement. My husband requests it all the time. However, I always add fresh ginger and hot pepper flakes. I also use President's Choice faux chicken breasts, and then make some extra sauce to accomodate the additional veggies I stirfry and toss into the mix. Instead of rice, we add some chowmein noodles to the stirfry as well. (I don't know if that's weird, but it's something my husband has always done?) Anyhow, the end result is A.MAZ.ING! :)

I LOVE this recipe!! But I do make a ton of changes. First, I'm using tofu instead of chicken. I don't bother to marinade the tofu. I start by stir frying the tofu with olive oil, a splash of sesame oil, black pepper, and garlic. Then I add veggies--I especially like to add broccoli, pea pods, white onion, and red bell pepper. Once everything is stir-fried, I add the sauce in. To make the sauce, I usually quadruple the amount, except the chili paste. I love hot, but even one ounce of the chili paste is a lot! Last, I throw on the green onion and peanuts. So delicious!

I thought this was pretty good. However, the BF did not like it. I left out the onion, water chestnuts and peanuts. I added about a tablespoon of peanut butter while the sauce was simmering. Definitely triple the sauce. Mine got a little thick so I thined it out with more wine. I served over rice with red and yellow peppers.

I am giving this a three rating because the original recipe calls for way too much corn starch. You should just use half the amount required, or less. Otherwise, the taste of the recipe was great. I tripled the ingredients because I like more sauce.

I have made this recipe many times and each time I do it a little differently.  Usually only adding or subtracting the amount of dried hot red peppers (instead of the paste).  I always add diced zucchini to the veggies and they seem to complement this dish quite nicely, but you have to make sure that you use smaller zucchinis as the larger ones don't taste as good and they are too full of seeds.  I add extra sesame seed oil, and replace the white wine with equal parts vinegar, soy sauce, and sesame seed oil.  I like this recipe because it is so customizeable, it's nice to not have to dirty up my measuring cups and spoons and this recipe allows me to do that.

I made this today for my moms birthday along with a few other Chinese recipes from this site and I must say it was very spicy.  I figured it would be, but WOW!  I couldn't find regular hot chili paste, but found a garlic chili paste.  I think it needed a little more flavor as far as salt or something like that.  But overall it turned out nice and smelled so good.

Great dish.  I did this one by scaling down the meats and veggies to 1/3 the recipe to make 1 bigger serving, but kept the amount of marinade and sauce the same.  Works really well, will try it with beef and shrimp too.

This recipe was really simple and tasty. Go shy on the chili paste if you're sensitive to heat - this was right at my threshold - but my husband was piling more on his plate! It's easier to add more heat at the end if you want to bump it up even more.

I made this recipe with a few changes and it tasted kind of funny to me. The only thing I changes with doubling the recipe except for the cornstarch and it still had a pasty taste to it.  My boyfriend however loved it so I'm rating it a 4.

This had lots of flavor and we ate it all up. To add color and crunch, I added julienned carrots and red bell pepper, and chopped in some thai basil, and I substituted cashews for the peanuts. My only qualm was that there wasn't enough sauce to really soak into the rice. But it tasted great.

This was easy and very good! I omitted the peanuts (only because I didn't have any)  and substituted the chili paste with chili sauce.  Served over whole wheat spaghetti noodles.  It was awesome!!

This is an awesome recipe! We loved it! I only wish I had made more.  The only thing I changed was I use red wine instead of white (it's what I had on hand) and I doubled all the ingredients for the sauce, except cornstarch & chile paste, due to what some other reviewers has said.  It was very, very good!  This has become an instant family favorite.

I loved this recipe!!!  It was better and spicier (which is how I like it) than what I get at my local Chinese take-out.  For the sauce, I kept the cornstarch/water mixture the same, added some more peanuts, and doubled the rest of the ingredients.  I also added a bag of thawed broccoli stir-fry veggies to the chicken when that was almost done.

i'm going to give this recipe 5 stars even tho there are a few changes that need to be made.. contrary to what other reviewers have said, the amount of marinade is fine and does not have to be changed.. the sauce does need to be doubled however.. adding water to the sauce while heating is important to give it the right consistency however i would be careful not to add too much (about 1/2 cup) as it WILL dilute the flavor.. otherwise its a great recipe with great flavor..

We enjoyed this.  My husband was nervous because of the Kung Pao Seinfeld episode (George likes his chicken SPICY!!) so I cut down the chili paste to 1 tbsp instead of 1 oz.  I also thinned it with some chicken broth because there wasn't enough sauce as written to make it good served over rice.

Very good - close to authentic.  I often use chunks of boneless, skinless chicken thighs, which have more flavor and are juicier than breasts.  I only use 1/2 tsp sugar because I really, really dislike any hint of sweetness in a meat dish.  A touch or cilantro (fresh or good-quality dried) and dry sherry finish off this dish nicely.

I must have marinated the chicken too long as it was mushy.  I also didn't use as much of the chili paste as it calls for and it was still plenty spicy.  I will definitley try again without marinating so long.

I couldn't find chili paste so instead I used 2 tsps of chili powder and replaced the paste with a sweet chili sauce. Wasn't spicy enough but was very tasty none the less.

This recipe was quite good. Glad I followed others and quadrupled the sauce, it still needed a bit more if your going to serve it with rice and broccoli as I did. I agree 2oz of chili paste is more than enough when quadrupling, might go with 1 1/2 next time.

This was simply delicious. The only thing I could think to improve to simplify things is to use frozen oriental vegetables. At my local grocery store, you can buy frozen vegetables that contain broccoli, red peppers, onions, mushrooms, and peas. I also added some seasame seeds, garlic powder, and extra soy sauce. I guess I didn't really find it necessary to add a lot of water like the other reviewers. I did double the quantity of the sauce, but I found that the corn starch gave my chicken a nice coating, like you'd find at an Asian restaurant. This is very delicious and my boyfriend and I loved it. Just be creative and add spices you love and if you want extra flavor, add a Kung-Po Chicken seasoning packet like I did in addition to the sauce. Also, I'm a vegetarian and the Morning Star faux 'chickin' strips' were perfect here.

Amazingly good! I think the chili paste was the key to this delicious sauce! I  used about 3 small chicken breast and did not have to double the sauce.But like others suggested, definitely double if your adding veggies.next time i will definitely try adding veggies.Cant wait to make this again!

This is the best Kung Pao Chicken I've ever had. You should definitely double or triple the sauce.  I couldn't find chile paste at the store, so I used asian chile sauce.  It worked well.  The dish was quite hot, but oh so delicious.  I also doubled the peanuts and ground them coarsley. I served it over brown rice. I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow.

DELICIOUS! I made this recipe for a school project for my friends, they are doing a report on the history of Asian Cuisine and I needed a quick and simple dish to whip up. I followed the recipe exactly, but I doubled all the portions because it was for a bigger group. Everything turned out excellent! I didn't change a thing but at the end I added some Low Mein pasta that I had prepared earlier, and served it with some stir friend green, red, and yellow peppers, mushrooms, and onions. EXCELLENT RECIPE! I will defanitley make anytime I have a craving for some chinese.

This fits the bill when you want Chinese but don't want to pick it up. It's fast and easy but it's not quite the same. I tripled the sauce (essential), added carrots and broccoli and served it over white rice. I like spicy food and it wasn't too hot for me or my husband.

I was excited to make this recipe until I started reading all the reviews.  I decided just to adjust everything to my taste and it turned out fantastic.  The ingredients are the key and they are great.  Adjust to YOUR taste.  It was delicious, better then most I get at restaurants.

Followed the advice of others and doubled the marinate and tripled the sauce, was perfect amount.  Used chicken broth in place of wine because I didn't have any.  Next time I might need to cut back on the chili paste, it's very spicy!  Overall, excellent dish though, very tasty!

Very good recipe. I double the sauce like some other people said to do and next time I'll probably add some more spice and less peanuts.

excellent. My hubby and son loved it. Son told me I could make it every week. doubled the sauce and marinade as suggested. They both can't get things hot enough so I added extra chili paste and they thought it was just right.

Wow! I absolutely love Asian food and I am always looking for the best recipes to make at home to save a couple of bucks by not ordering in. This is the most authentic Chinese recipe I have ever tried. It is wonderful...I changed nothing. I am actually going to cook it with pork instead of chicken tonight. YUM...try this, you won't regret it!

Yummy! As I write this review I still have the sting of the sauce around my mouth! As the other reviewers advised, I doubled both the sauce mix and the marinade. I added chopped green and red bell pepper as well, and after the chicken cooked, I added the mixture to the sauce and some yakisoba noodles. --For the chili paste, I used Kikkoman Thai Chili Sauce. It was great, I will definitely make this one again!

We loved this meal! I listened to other's advice and added 1 c. water & made extra sauce. I loved the taste of the sauce simmering in the pan, but it lost so much of the flavor impact because I added a bag of fresh stir-fry veggies to the chicken. Next time, I will make them on the side. Other than that, I can't wait to make it again!

This is probably the best Kung Pao I have tried. I added diced carrots, celery & chopped green and red bell peppers. I figured it need some veggies-as my husband and I love veggie additions to dishes. As a request from some reviewers, I doubled the sauce, actually I tripled the sauce - which I will definitely do again (especially with adding veggies). As another tip from a reviewer, I added water as it was cooking, because it can get VERY thick if you don't. All in all, this was awesome.  Kung Pao is my hubby's favorite meal - and he was impressed with the home made version!  Recipe is a keeper; thank you!

This was great! It was not that spicy, but I think it was because of the chili sauce I used. Next time I'll add a bit more, or find a better chili sauce (which is gonna be tough since I live on a small island). I had mine with rice, while my husband prefers noodles. The leftovers were great the next day!

I made this recipe two nights in a row, once with chicken and once with strips of steak.  Both times I doubled the sauce as recommended.  The first time I accidentally used 2T of vinegar, so of course it turned out way too sour.  The second time I used the correct amount, but still found it too sour for my taste.  The problem could be that the brand of chili paste I'm using (Sambal Oelek) has more vinegar than others.  Perhaps in the future I'll try again without any additional vinegar, but for now I'm burnt out on sour meat.

This is the best Kung Pao recipe I've ever tried. I like my food spicy and some comments said it was a little bland, so I added about an 1/8th teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the marinade. I used rice wine and Sesme oil. My husband said it was the best he's ever had.

I have always wanted to make a chinese dish at home and although this wasn't exactly like a restaurant it was excellent.  I didn't use the chile paste since I didn't have any and it turned out sweet but very good.  I also doubled the marinade and sauce (except for the corn starch) to make sure I had enough sauce to coate the chicken.  My husband doesn't like chinese food but he liked this.

Yep, this was really good. Easy to make. Needed to be a bit more spicey for us, so we will throw in a jalapeno or two next time. I doubled the marinade, but took half out before adding the chicken to the rest of the ingredients so it didn't turn out too soggy/pasty.

There was not a flavor in this dish at all. The meat seemed mushy with all of the oil and sauces and overall this was not at all what I would hope for in Kung Pao chicken.

Wonderful! Our family doesn't handle spicy too well, so I left out the paste, and cut back on the red pepper flakes, then I added peanut butter like another reviewer said, and it was amazing! I also substituted vinegar for the white wine.

Not very good, bland.  I used less sesame oil.  The recipe didn't specify, but I assume the author meant light sesame oil, because two tablespoons of dark would be so  aaaaawful! I think I will tweak this a bit using some chicken broth, rice wine vinegar, shoyu and sesame oil to try and get the taste we love.

Very tasty and easy to make!! I omit the chile paste (too hot for the kiddos) and water chesnuts (hubby's not a fan) but it's still great! I only use 1 T. cornstarch or the sauce gets too thick for my taste. Thanks for the easy family meal :)

An excellent recipe.  The marinade didn't make quite enough in my opinion and I added a bit more white wine and soy sauce.  Watch the amount of chile paste you put in, I thought it was pretty hot!  But hubby loved it!  An easy-to-make recipe and great with white rice.

Oh. My. Gosh.  Awesome recipe, soooo good and very easy.  Husband loved it and it will definitely be a regular in the house.  I agree with other reviewers, it's best to double the sauce (watch the chile paste, though, it can be spicy!).  I served over steamed rice and veggies - excellent.  Thanks for sharing!

This was very close to my favorite asian takeout kung pao. I used Sriracha HOT chili sauce (in the Asian section at WalMart) and I only used 1 Tablespoon instead of 3. It was slightly milder than takeout but very very good. I also used cocktail peanuts (no skins) and left them whole. It was GREAT!

I made this last weekend.  I did every proportion exactly except for the White Wine.  I didn't put any White Win in it, which took away a bit more mild of a taste to the sauce I presume.  I still thought the recipe was delicious, especially for a poor college student like myself.

It was quite easy to make, and proved to fill myself and my roomates up afterwards.

Note:  The recipe is rather spicy.  It was more spicy than I actually had anticipated, and I really like spicy food.

Tried this out on a whim - excellent! I took out the water chestnuts and added 1 green and red bell pepper each, and one white onion, cooked mostly, removed and cooked the chicken - when the chicken was almost ready, I tossed back in the vegetables for a minute then transferred to the sauce. 
This is even better reheated and served with rice on a tortilla the next day!

Very good recipe.  I don't think it had a lot of spice to it like I was expecting, but that can be adjusted next time, and there will be a next time.  There was not near enough sauce!  I ended up adding about 1 cup of chicken broth after combining chicken and sauce, this helped but may have taken out some of the flavor.  Next time I will eliminate the water chestnuts (personal preference) and kick up the spice a bit. Thanks for a good recipe!

Yes, please add more water or else the sauce in the pan will look like brown Elmer's school glue. Not too sure that I'll make this again, the taste reminded me more of the Beef 'n Brocholli sauce than Kung Pao. Something seemed to be missing to the flavor.

GREAT MEAL!  I too doubled the sauce, my only change was that I tossed the chicken in some cornstarch and and lightly fried them.  Then I reduced the sauce on the stove, and then mixed them together.  White rice and spring rolls went well with.

This was awesome. Thnx a million for this recipie.
Needed to double up on the sauce as everyone advised and made 2 adjustments. Used Cider Vinegar instead of distilled and as we had no white wine in I had to use vermouth instead of that.

It's difficult to find recipes that can stand up to those you can order at a chinese restaurant, but this is one.  I used flank steak sliced very thin (easy to do when partially frozen), doubled the sauce, and added green and red bell peppers and snow peas.  My husband went back for thirds!

SO tasty! I also doubled the marinade and sauce, and added water to the sauce while it was cooking. I also added a little peanut butter. Served over white rice = big hit. Thank you!

Wow!  I loved this!!  I will definitely be making it again and again.  I doubled the recipe and also doubled the sauce and marinade.  I didn't have sesame oil, so I used olive oil, and I didn't have the chili paste, so I used chili sauce.  I have since gone to the asian market and have the proper ingredients so I can't wait to try it again!

Really enjoyed this. I made a few changes; I wasn't able to find hot chile paste so substituted it with hot chile sauce and used apple juice instead of the white wine. If I had read the reviews prior to making this, I would have also doubled the sauce. Thanks.

Good recipe for people who are familiar with do-it-yourself oriental. Notes of caution for people that like to increase the sauce proportions: don't increase the cornstarch and water, and chile paste evenly. In a quadrupled recipe, I kept the chile paste at 1 oz. and it was just the right amount of spicy for us. Also, I proportionately increased the cornstarch/water and the sauce was a little pasty. Other than that, this was delicious.

I love this recipe!  It's easier than it looks and it comes out great every time.  It's so good, that when I go out to Chinese restaurants, I compare my recipe to their's and I win every time! ;)

We really enjoyed this recipe.  We wanted to have extra sauce for pasta, so we tripled the sauce.  We used chili sauce and red pepper instead of the chili paste.  We also doubled the marinade.  Excellent!

Four stars simply because of all the mods it needs, but end result was delicious, once tampered with. I multiplied the marinade and sauce ingredients by 5, which was enough for 3 large chicken breasts and 4 big servings. Cornstarch was 10tsp to 10T. Added 1 red bell pepper, one coarsely chopped onion, and 3tsp. red pepper flakes. Used Siracha hot chili sauce in place of paste. Was SO GOOD! Great and worth the time!

I made this for the family yesterday.  I didn't have chili paste so I used "Taste of Thai" garlic chili sauce.  I agree that the sauce gets pretty thick.  I used water to thin it down some.  Next time I will use chicken broth.  You need at least 1/2 cup or more.  I stir fried brocolli, califlower, onion and mushrooms into the mix.  Delicious!

This was one great recipe! simply too! I used Sriracha hot chilli sauce, only 1 heaping teaspoon of it. There was a kick to it, but not too spicy. The second time i also added dried red chilli, 2 or 3 of them. You could also add brocolli after the chicken is cooked , then add the sauce. Very yummy recipe!

Very delicious.  When I stir fried the chicken I also put in the garlic (plus 3-4 cloves more) and red pepper flakes.  Also stir fried some carrot slices and bell pepper.  Mixed cornstarch with chicken broth - 2 Tblsp. to one 14 oz. can, and added more soy sauce.  I used 3 whole, dried red chilies instead of the chili paste. I make this very often now.

I love this recipe!  I've made it 3 times now, and with each successive time I've decreased the amount of chili paste I used.  For me, who can't handle spicy foods so well, I tripled the sauce but used only about 1.5 teaspoons of chili paste.  I will definitely make this in the future.

Not bad, not bad. Not particularly spicy, but it had some nice flavors involved. When I make this again, I'll make certain to add more chili paste and to double the sauce. I think that'll fix it right up.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I doubled the sauce as recommended in earlier reviews and
found it just right.  It  was a little on the spicy side but even my  year old liked it!  I will definately
make this again.

I hate to rain on everyones parade but either I did something wrong  or this recipe is really gross. Based on the other reviews I must have done something wrong. The sauce definately needs to be doubled and an 8oz can of chestnuts is too much. I'll give it another try later.

This was a very good recipe; it's so easy and very tastey.  I make it often and sometimes instead of serving it over rice, I put it in a tortilla for a wrap.  Also, whenever I am short on time, I skip the marinade part and it still tastes yummy.

Perfect amount of "spiceyness". I serve it over white rice.  I cook the rice in my rice cooker while I prepare the chicken and it takes me 30 minutes.

We made this dish tonight and it was delicious! Here’s the only things I did different: 1. Salt and pepper the chicken before putting in marinade 2. Double the sauce at you will need it,it cooks down fast with the corn starch 3. My husband accidentally bought diced water chestnuts, but they turned out perfect in this dish! Enjoy it’s a keeper....our picky eater had seconds!

This was a hit with my family! I combined the marinade and sauce (as written, minus the cornstarch), then doubled that and added a 1/4 tsp of ginger.  Marinaded the chicken for 3 hours.  Stir fried carrots, green pepper and green onions, but left out water chestnuts.  Sauteed the chicken without the sauce, then mixed with the vegetables, added the marinade/sauce and 1TBL cornstarch mixed with 1/2 c water.  Served with sticky rice.

I incorporated others' suggestions to increase the sauce amount (by 5 times!!) and reduce the oil and corn starch. I also used hot sesame oil and sambal olek chili paste. Delicious!

Amazing  !!! Easy and authentic !!  Definitely double the marinade and double or triple the sauce.  Use shaoxing cooking wine, rice vinegar and sambal chili paste. All easily found in the asian aisle and absolutely adds to the authenticity.  Low sodium/lite soy also recommended so salt isn't overpowering.  Apart from those minor suggestions prepare per recipe. They will be fighting for leftovers !!

My wife loved this when I made it....the only thing I added was salt a Szechuan pepper. She wants me to make it again real soon.

As written, this is a good Kung Pao. To make it 5 stars, I use the sauce (minus the cornstarch) as marinade and "soak" for 24 hours, giving it a good shake every once in a while. You can still use the sauce (make sure to add the cornstarch here), just make sure during the heating process, you reach a boiling point and you will probably want to boil for 5 minutes (keep stirring so it doesn't burn). Or, you can make new sauce. I have used the marinade as the sauce several times with no problem.

I added 4 cloves garlic, 3 spears celery, 1.5 zucchini’s and stir fried. For the sauce used Sirachi  as I didn’t have chili paste, and just used vegetable oil as no sesame oil. Also doubled the sauce ingredients and baked the chicken separately and added on the side without marinade.Everyone liked...oh and added red pepper flakes for more pow.

This is a family favorite, with the change of doubling the sauce in the recipe...yet using only the two tbs. cornstarch.  Broccoli, a shredded carrot, and mushrooms can be cooked separately as a side dish or added to the sauce toward the end of the cooking time.  It is delicious and is incredibly close in flavor to the one that we get at one of our favorite local Chinese restaurants!

Having cooked for over 50 years and not having eaten it yet, I would say this is a tasty recipe.  There are actually 4 T. of liquids in the sauce, counting the oil. Later on, you can see that at least another quarter cup of water was added, so the result is not dry. It's a total of a half-cup of liquid.   If the chicken itself turns out dry, you've over-cooked it. Chicken in small pieces takes only a few minutes to cook.

This recipe was a big hit with my teenage daughter! I made it as only one serving for just her. I used 1 boneless skinless chicken breast (about 1/2 lb). I made the sauce and marinade with same proportions as the recipe calls for except I completely left out the chile paste (instead a minute sprinkling of red pepper flakes) and left out the water chestnuts. I substituted cashews & probably only used 2.5 - 3 oz. rather than the 4 oz that the recipe calls for.  I marinated the chicken for probably close to 90 minutes. Served with jasmine rice and sautéed green beans. A GREAT meal! The amount of marinade and sauce that the recipe calls for was perfect for the 1/2 lb. of chicken.

This turned out very good! It was easy to make and taste was very close to restaurants version. I did make a few changes, I used carrots in place of water chestnuts which gave it a crunchy sweet taste to off set the spice. I used 1 tsp of corn starch in the marinade and 2 tsp in the sauce. I also used more garlic, about 4-5 tablespoons all together. We will be having this again!

easy to make and quite tasty.  will try with cashews next time.  might increase the sauce by half for the cooking portion.  Delicious.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a solid recipe for amazing Kung Pao Chicken.  Instead of white vinegar I typically use Chinese dark vinegar for a richer flavor.  I also like to throw in diced onion and bell pepper.

I'm a kung pao fan but can't handle spicy food.  I omitted the chili spice  and it was really really good. I'm making this again!   I bought a can of water chestnuts but forgot to add them. Didn't miss them though. 

The change I did was to sous vide the chicken chunks in the marinade.  149 degrees for 90 minutes.  The chicken was sooo tender and able to cut it with a fork!   I used the marinade  from the sous vide bag and added brown sugar and vinegar to it in a separate skillet with the onion, garlic, and peanuts.  The two sauces tasted pretty much the same but the one from the sous vide had a light brown color while the other one was dark reddish.  I 4x the sauce ingredients and didn't need the extra sous vide sauce.

I didn't hate it, but something was missing, and I'm not sure what it was. This was my first attempt at making any kung pao chicken. It was by far the best kung pao I've had since moving back to Idaho (my efforts to find good Chinese here is dismal). At first I thought more  chili paste, but it had a decent hot kick to it. Maybe it was the reduced sodium soy sauce or maybe next time I will try more brown sugar (my daughter thought it lacked a slight sweetness). Either way there will be another try at this recipe. Thanks!

I’ve made this twice- this time I skipped marinade and doubled all sauce ingredients except garlic and chili paste and it was delicious and fast. I didn’t miss the marinade. Still plenty garlicky and spicy hot. I will say the smell is more amazing than the taste - but still good. I only used chicken because my kids are picky- may need even more sauce if there’s veggies in there.

ThIs was quite  delicious. My husband enjoyed it and we eat at a lot of Chinese restaurants in California. I cant wait to make it for my son when he is home.  i did have to add quite a bit more water to get it to the consistency I desired but that was fine.  Definitely a keeper.

This was so tasty.  I cooked some green bell and a jalapeno and sliced carrots prior to adding the sauce into the pan (I had to triple the sauce recipe due to veg. addition).  I used chicken breast that I had baked and stored in the refrigerator...was so fast and easy.  I skipped the peanuts.  Love it!

Simply outstanding. The family wants this added to the rotation after dinner tonight.

Luckily I read the reviews and quadrupled the sauce. This is a must. Next time I'm cutting the starch from the marinade because that's just silly. And if you have a hungry family of four, you'd better double the recipe.

But this is seriously one of the best recipes I've ever found.

Like other reviewers, I tripled the sauce.  I didn’t reduce the sesame oil but made my own chili paste, which really ratchets up the heat.

Double, if not triple the sauce. Also I followed previous reviews and used rice wine. It’s a good base sauce and marinade that you can play with.

Really good!  A few small changes that did not affect the overall recipe-just preference. I only added half the chili paste as we do not like our food that hot. I also used half the cornstarch which was plenty. I used more chicken so doubled the marinade and I stir fried red peppers, onion and pea pods and mixed with the sauce(quadrupled the sauce) and served on the side to add or not. My son gave it an A+. He does not hand those out very often!

I loved the flavor of this recipe.  Although I had to add water and chicken broth 'like the other reviewers, to thin out the sauce, the results were so good that I gave it 5 stars!!!!

This was fantastic.  The only change was the addition of a 2 carrots cut up matchstick size.  I cooked them with the chicken.

I followed  the  recipe as written but used chicken thighs instead of breasts. I also used Korean chili paste which has a little "sweet" to it.  Next time I will cook the recipe in different order. I would add a little peanut or veg oil to the pan and cook the chicken on high heat until cooked as I learned when I lived in Japan.

I like the inclusion of the water chestnuts in this recipe. I think my local restaurants in my hometown when I was growing up never used it, but it really compliments this dish very well.

Tasted great! I would probably double the marinade and sauce next time, but overall good flavor. Might add more spice to because I like my Kung Pao spicy!

It's good, but you need to double everything in the marinade and sauce except for the green onions and water chestnuts and peanuts. Yes that includes the chili paste.

A super tasty dinner the kids gobbled up completely! 
I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the marinade and tripled the sauce. (I also halved the chili paste since my two younger kids aren’t huge fans of spicy. It was still deliciously warm and tingly without being too much for them.) 
We will certainly make this again.

This is a really good recipe!  I tripled all of the ingredients (except the corn starch which I left the same and used 3 ounces of chopped cashews instead of peanuts) and it came out great.  I added a can of bamboo shoots and one large red bell pepper (chopped).   Served over white rice.  I will be making this again!

Rated it 4 stars because the sauce needed to be doubled (which I did). I used Sriracha sauce in place of the hot chili paste, and used plain chicken tenders, which cooked quickly and were, well, tender!  Served it with BirdsEye Chicken flavored rice with broccoli and carrots, microwaved, and oh so easy! I didn't know if both water chestnuts and peanuts were necessary, but they are! Husband said it was my best Chinese dish and he went back for second helping! Great recipe, thanks Arlene!

Love this.. and so did my teenage kids.   Doubled the sauce based on the reviews, was a great choice as it had the perfect amount.  I used boneless skinless chicken thigh/leg that I'm always looking for recipes for and this was perfect.

This Kung Pao Chicken was very good. I will definitely make it again. My only issue was that there didn’t seem to be enough sauce. Not sure if it’s me who used too much chicken or if the recipe produced less sauce than I would have liked. I will play around with this recipe to get it perfect for my family.

This was very easy to make. At first i was a little confused by some of the directions, but after reading a few reviews, i got it. i took a suggestion by one reviewer who said not to cook the chicken separately, by adding it after the sauce was warmed through. this made things so much easier! i didn't have any white wine, so i used Rice Wine Vinegar and left out the vinegar in the recipe. i also added some fresh grated ginger. This was delicious!

I made it according to the recipe but maybe I didn't have the right kind of chili paste? I found it inedible - nearly flavorless despite the fact that my paste was hot. Not sweet, not spicy, just bland. My husband said it was ok (not great) but I couldn't eat more than 2 bites.

Underwhelming. Bland mixture that needs a significant boost of salt. Recipe needs a texture boost as well green peppers and whole dried chilies would do wonders. Double the sauce or you end up with paste. Meh. Look elsewhere...

I  put some cayenne pepper and a squirt of Sriracha Chili Sauce. Instead of Peanuts I had Cashews on hand so used them . Liked it a lot .  Sure it didn't taste as if you ordered it at a Chinese restaurant . But you can make it as Spicy or Mild you want . Plus it's probably healthier ..

This is now a go to recipe for me when having guests at the cottage. It's surprisingly simple to make but is packed full of flavour.  I have made it with rice, lo mein noodles and even vermicelli noodles depending on what I have on hand and it all tastes great

Great recipe. Can be as sloppy as you like with measurements and tweek it to taste. Have served it over zucchini noodles for a great spin on a lo-mein. This is a go to recipe if I have a craving for Chinese food.

I have to say, this is the first recipe I've made on here that we just really didn't like.  I followed the directions to a tee, but it came out super spicy (this is coming from a couple that LOVES spicy)... to the point where it wasn't enjoyable, and it was also kind of tasteless.  Definitely not going to repeat this recipe. Sorry!

This recipe is pretty good, but I recommend doubling the sauce and adding water as it cooks or the sauce gets too thick.

I followed the basic recipe, but had to adjust it, as I was cooking dinner for 8.  I did not add the cornstartch mixture into the marinade, as it is unnecessary.  Definitely the original recipe is short on "sauce" as other posters commented.  So I multiplied the recipe until I got an acceptable amount.  I did not multiply the chili paste with everything else.  I have young kids and they wouldn't have been able to eat it.  But I did make 8 times the sauce and added in 4 Tbsp of chili paste, and the recipe still had some kick to it.  You do have to add a lot less cornstarch if you don't want it too thick.  I only added 2 Tbsp of cornstarch to my entire batch of sauce, and it worked out perfectly.

I didn't have any red chili peppers so I substituted a Thai green chili paste I have on hand.  It's a more intense spice level but just as tasty.  I will definitely keep this recipe handy.

Spicy Asian food can be difficult to pair with wine.  But the same characteristics that make wine pairings difficult, make mead pairings sing.  Try this with a sweet traditional (honey-only) mead such as from Sky River Meadery in Washington State, or with a lush fruit mead such as the mango mead from Superstition Meadery in Arizona!

Really...very bland, boring, and unexciting. The large number of folks who approve of this recipe kinda surprises me.

For one thing, not the fault of the recipe, it isn't 'saucy' enough. Overall...quite disappointing.

This recipe is simply delicious.  Kung Pao chicken is my favorite Chinese dish and this one is a definite keeper.  The second time I made it I doubled the recipe for the sauce (and used a lot more chili paste as I love the heat!).  Serve with steamed rice and homemade egg rolls and you have a great dinner!

4.5 stars.  Made essentially as written, it had good flavor.  However, I agree with another reviewer, it's not spicy.  Even though I added spices, hot sauce and cayenne pepper.  The next time, I will add even more spice and my husband and I will be happy!

Marinating the chicken in the sauce with corn starch tenderizes the meat really nicely so it tastes like restaurant quality. I added 3 TBS of oyster sauce to the marinade (and doubled the sauce), which made it more flavorful. I would make this again but probably add minced ginger for a little more spice, and add more veggies like mushrooms and bok choy; otherwise, this was a great starter recipe!

I made it as written, but halved the chicken and the peanuts, as there is only 2 of us, so basically doubled the sauce, and added about 1/2 cup water to thin it out. definitely double the sauce. I subbed jicama for water chestnuts and added some broccoli. I was confused about the "1 oz chili paste", I added 1 heaping tsp chili garlic sauce and it was very spicy, DH loved it, it was good, but a little too spicy for me. served it over cauliflower rice

Very Good! This recipe would work in Hunan! I have had Gung Pao Ji Ding in Wuhan and this recipe compares favorably. However in Chengdu, it would be drier and would include Szechuan peppercorns (hua jiao). But I was very happy with it. To make it more Chinese, cut down on the amount of chicken.

First time doing this recipe and not the last one. I read other comments and I also doubled the amounts for  the marinade and sauce and instead of peanuts I used peanut butter.
Delicious and very easy to make.

My husband, who believes no meal can be too spicy, LOVED this! He ate it three meals in a row, and can't wait for more! It is so flavorful and tasty. Next time I make it I will probably double the sauce.

I followed the recipe as much as I could and the outcome was quite tasty but I had to add a lot of water to the sauce... I also added some tofu, vegetables and sesame seeds because we don't like water chestnuts and just the chicken seemed a little boring. All in all, this is a good recipe but something about the sauce's consistency without the extra water was  just not quite right.

Double the sauce, but cut the cornstarch to just 1 Tbs., the sugar to 1 tsp. and stick with 2 Tbs of the chile. I added up the veggie count with four cremini mushrooms, 1/2 cup red bell pepper, and one small zucchini. Too spicy for kids, but about a 5 on an adult scale of hot (BTW 1 ounce of chilie = 2 Tbs)

I made a few changes listed in other reviews. My additional  change was using Roasted Sesame Oil which gave the sauce a richer flavor. My family loved it! I will definitely make this again.

I liked it, but I made some changes. I cooked my chicken first and then I mixed all of the ingredients intended for marinating and the sauce together and added that mixture after the chicken was cooked. I think there were way too many peanuts, and that is saying something because I love peanuts. I also added more red pepper flakes because I wanted it spicier. I would definitely make this again - easy and quick!

I love kung pao chicken and eat it at Chinese restaurants often. I made these changes - I used the  marinade as listed for the chicken and changed the sauce since I had some leftover home made chinese bar-b-que sauce  (1/2 c ketchup, 1/4 c. vinegar, 2oz honey and 1-2 oz brown sugar). I also added Szechuan pepper corns about a teaspoon and a dried red pepper instead of hot chilli paste. I liked my version a lot. Oh I also  deep fried the chicken ;-p.  The dish turned out sooo delicious. I would say it was restaurant quality with these adjustments.

This is delicious but I was expecting a little more heat. Next time I might use more chili paste or a dash of red pepper flakes as I like things very spicy.

I really didn't follow measurements but just did what I thought would work. I didn't add the vinegar and it wasn't needed in my opinion. I made mine with peppers, jalepenos, onions, baby corn and green beans and it looks just like take out! It's so good!

I LOVED THIS RECIPE!  Added an extra tablespoon of chili and BAM!   I also added about half a cup of low-sodium chicken broth because it gets way too thick.   love love and the husband was amazed that I cooked Chinese for the first time:)

Reviewer Holly.... I just wanted to thank you for the advice on the double marinade and double sauce, as well as the additional water throughout the simmer process... 

I had  a lady over who I've been secretly stalking for the last 3 years, and this was the first time I made her dinner. So OBVIOUSLY it had to be spectacular!!!

It indeed was, she's still here, and I don't think it can be considered stalking anymore because of your expert advice!

HEART YOU,
Steve

I'm Chinese and this recipe was fantastic. The taste was spot on. The only thing I would do differently would be to skip the cornstarch mixture because I found that it made it too gooey. Also, tweak the chilli paste to suit your taste buds accordingly.

This was so easy to make. I love kung pao chicken and so does everyone in my family.  I doubled the recipe. The adults loved it including my 80 year old mom.  The teens agreed that it was definitely a "make it again" recipe. Next time, I'll use shrimp. I agree with the other post in that you will want to  make more sauce. I tripled it for the amount of chicken i made. As far as the corn starch, the video tells you to add water if its too pasty. It came out fine.

We love this recipe!  Often my husband substitutes fried extra firm tofu for the chicken.  He also uses less water chestnuts and doubles the amount of sauce. We enjoy this recipe almost twice a month.

This meal turned out delicious, and the chicken was very tender.  I changed a few things, based on other reviews and ingredient availability:
I switched out the white wine for Japanese mirin, omitted the sugar, changed the green onion for regular yellow onion, switched in cashews for peanuts, and added chopped peppers (green and red), mushrooms, and baby corn.  I also doubled the sauce and marinade, and added the chili sauce only 10 minutes before serving. 
I suppose this sounds pretty different from the original, but the essentials of the marinade and sauce were very good with any added ingredients, and the recipe was very accommodating.

Great recipe. I increased the sauce about 50% per the advice of other reviewers, which was perfect. If I had to do it again, I would do the following:

More chili paste/spice;
Add veggies: Mushrooms, baby corn, etc;
Sliiightly fewer peanuts.

Be prepared to add a lot of water while the sauce is simmering (like, 2 cups).  I tripled the sauce, added steamed broccoli and sauteed peppers.  Very good!

Made this without garlic used about 1 tablesp. sweet chilli sauce.  Quadrupled the sauce and even then there wasn't enough.  Did marinade the chicken for a couple of hours.  Stir fried veggies at the very end.  Everyone enjoyed it.  Could make everything ahead of time and just add stir fried veggies at the end.

So good!
Made it twice, and my family and I love it (including my one-and-a-half-year-old).
The only thing I changed was that I added 1 Tbsp of Hot Sauce and about 1/2-1 Tbsp Spicy Paprika because I don't have Chili Paste.
Absolutely delicious :)

I made as per recipe and the dish turned out great.  But like the other reviewers, you can easily double or triple the sauce.

This dish was awesome!  I didn't have any chili paste so I added 1 red Thai chili and 2 red habanero's.  It was very spicy, but awesome!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was very good. I doubled the sauce but did everything else as written.  I couldn't find hot chili paste so it wasn't spicy (I used chili paste but it didn't say "hot"). It would definitely be a five with more spice, so I gave it a five star rating. Hopefully next time I can find the Hot chili paste....

I didn't alter the ingredients other than I left out the chili paste because my kids don't like spicy. I doubled the chicken and marinade (I like to get two meals out of a dish) but did not double the corn starch as others suggested.
I used a wok over the stove because we have one, but a skillet would work. Cooked the chicken in the wok with a little bit of chicken stock to avoid dryness that others commented on. When the chicken was cooked through I removed it and added veggies (mushrooms, broccoli, peapods, small corn, carrots, anything would work).
Made the sauce in a pot and multiplied all of the liquid ingredients by 5 (next time would do 6 because it probably could have used a little more sauce). The non-liquid ingredients I just increased until it looked okay. Multiplying the peanuts and onions by 5 would have been too much.
When the veggies and sauce are done, add the chicken and sauce to the veggies and warm through. I served in over lo mein noodles (the soft kind) but you could use rice, linguine or just by itself. Really yummy!

My family loved this recipe!  They are super picky too. I doubled the marinade and sauce like the reviews recommended. Used 1/2 of the chili paste so it would not be too spicy and served with sriracha for everyone to spice as they pleased. Used cashews instead of peanuts. Served with Jasmine rice and steamed broccoli. Very good.

I had to double but could have tripled the sauce.  Flavor was outstanding.  Made one batch of sauce without heat or peanuts for the kids and one with.  Lived by all.  Used chicken thigh meat.  This is key for great  oriental chicken dishes.

Great Kung Pao chicken recipe. I add extra vegetables to mine (increase sauce to cover the extra ingredients) as well as use chicken thigh instead of chicken breast. I've made this for guests multiple times and everyone loves it. Super authentic!

I like a lot of sauce, so i doubled both the marinade and gravy.  
Very good.  I like it spicier... probably need to add more chili paste.

Thought it was delicious. Would have given 4 stars, but it was a little too spicy for the whole family and I used 1/2 the hot sauce. I would also suggest a little more sauce.

I've tried a few different kung pao chicken recipes and this is the only one my picky family liked.   I used 1 T sambal oelek in place of the chili paste and vinegar,  half the amount of peanuts (to save a few calories) and added half  a chopped red pepper along with the chicken.   Next time I'll try cashews and/or bamboo shoots.  Definitely a keeper.

I love Chinese food, and I love this especially. We (me and my family) added chicken broth to make it more saucy, and we quartered the number of peanuts to make it less of a peanut chicken and more of a chicken and sauce. Besides the fact that it took forever to make on the first try, I loved the results. I would suggest formal serving to make a meal that took 2 hours and otherwise would be gone in 20 minutes into a multi-course, 45 minute meal.

I little too much sesame oil for my taste-tended to overpower the other ingredients.  Otherwise, nice and spicy and easy to make.  I served over pho noodles.  Next time will serve with rice and reduce sesame oil.

I made this as written (without the chili to make it kid friendly) and thought it was okay. There wasn't enough sauce and the chicken stuck to the pan when cooking. Next time I'll try some of the changes posted by other reviewers and use less corn starch, double the sauce, and add veggies.

Recipe was pretty bland. The peanut to sauce ratio was way too low, should have doubled the sauce. But even with the right amount of sauce I'm afraid the flavor would still be lacking. Won't be making this again....

Very tasty but I did make a few modifications. As several reviews suggested, I doubled the sauce except for the green onions, peanuts and water chestnuts. I used the Splenda brown sugar (requires 1/2 the amount) Before I sautéed the chicken I sautéed eight dried red red chili peppers with most of the seeds removed. I wanted it a little spicy so I left some seeds. Finally, I added chopped zucchini just so I could call it healthy. It was delicious and my husband liked it as well. I will try it with shrimp next time.

I liked how it turned out. I had only added a bit of chilli Thai pepper sauce to the final dish. Stand alone, I would recommend it for simplicity sake. I added some extra veggies to bulk it up. 3.8/10 Would cook again to stretch a dollar.

This was so good! I made this last night and made a few adjustments based on others feedback. I used rice vinegar instead of wine, trippled the measurements for the sauce, and use teaspoons for the corn starch measurements instead of table spoons. I also added dried chilies. It was spicy and sweet and just yummy. Most Kung Pao dishes I have had are more savory than sweet but this one was more sweet which I liked. I will definitely be making this again.

Followed directions exactly except I doubled the sauce recipe.  It was far too salty and spicy.  The sauce was way too thick as well.

I followed this recipe to the T and although it turned out okay, it was still missing something, I'm not quite sure what. I used chili garlic paste made by the same company that makes Sriracha hot sauce, WOW! Fella's that is all that needs to be said. The 4 oz of peanuts was a little overkill.

Tried this recipe one night when we had thawed chicken breasts and wanted to be a little more creative than just grilling them. Didn't have sesame oil so we used olive oil. Didn't have green onions so we used regular onions and we skipped the peanuts. Overall it was a good recipe and we enjoyed it served over a bed of rice. It seemed a bit bland and perhaps next time we'll look at spicing it up a bit. It's certainly a keeper though and we'll try it again.

This was awesome!!! Made it just like the recipe, although I followed other reviewers advice and tripled marinade and sauce recipe. I did have more chicken than recipe called for. It was a bit warm for some family members but they loved the flavor. If anyone knows how I can keep the flavor and turn the heat down let me know.

Loved it - didn't have any chili paste on hand so used 1 TB Sriracha instead. Had a nice bite but I think I may add a bit more next time.

This is a great recipie. I followed some of the suggestions for making more sauce and it was great. Coated the chicken with double the recipe amount as well to accommodate my large family. It was a hit. Even the kids loved it.

It turned out SO salty! I'm not sure if it was the soy sauce, garlic, or corn starch, but it was definitely overpowering. I added a few more generous pinches of brown sugar to balance it out, which helped, but I'm not sure if I would make this again. The sauce was nice and thick, and the recipe was very easy to follow, but it didn't blow me away. We used the leftover chicken on salads the next day and that was pretty good. All in all, a decent recipe for last minute ideas. Tip: add less cornstarch and garlic!

We LOVED this recipe!  We used 1.25lbs of chicken so As the other reviewers suggested, I doubled the marinade. For the sauce, I tripled the wine, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and chopped 6 green onions. Kept the peanuts, water chestnuts, corn starch mix and garlic as the recipe recommends, used 3 tblspoons of the hot chili paste, and had to sub peanut oil for the sesame oil. Also, I sautéed the chicken and set aside, and then sautéed about 6 oz of sliced baby Bella mushrooms and then added the sauce to the pan. Once aromatic, I added the chicken back in and let simmer for 5 min or so and served it over white rice. An A+ recipe for sure!!

I made this the first time as written and I did not like the result. There is too much cornstarch, too much sesame oil, and not enough sauce overall. I made it a second time and I reduced the cornstarch by 1/2, reduced the sesame oil to 1 teaspoon in the sauce only (none in the marinade) and I doubled the sauce and also dissolved the cornstarch in 1/2 cup chicken broth instead of 2 tablespoons of water. It was much better the second time around but still not even remotely like PF Chang's.

Very good dish, I didn't have white wine so I used Sake that I had on hand. I had chicken I pulled out of the freezer yesterday and didn't have any special use for it. I was thinking BBQ, but after browsing the site and searching for recipes I thought I'd give this a shot. Over all it was a nice dish, and easy to put together. I saved this recipe and know I will make this again. I also found a recipe here for asian style mustard greens, and as a side to this Kung Pao chicken and rice I may never have to go out for Chinese again. This dish is worth trying if your wondering if it will be any good, it is!

Loved it! Only problem though was that there was definitely not enough sauce. I would probable either double the recipe's marinade and add water to fix that though. Also Instead of using white wine I used mirin that I had and it was a great substitute.

Delicious! I love Kung pao chicken! This recipe was excellent. I added an assortment of veggies  that I needed to use that were already in the fridge. Mushrooms, cabbage and bell peppers. This is an easy staple that my husband loves for me to make often.

Very delicious following exact directions. The only change I will make is using 1/2 the cornstarch as the sauce is a bit to thick. A favorite easy chinese dish!

Pretty good. I read through some of the reviews before making and decided to only use 1 Tbsp cornstarch (added it to the chicken marinade, without water, and didn't use anymore). I used rice wine (sake) instead of white wine. I also added some minced fresh ginger. I used peanut oil to brown the meat. I didn't have any green onions - but I did slice up a medium white onion and added that in after I had browned the chicken. I don't know how much an ounce of chili paste is - I used a Tablespoon of it. I marinated the chicken for about 30 mins, cooked my white rice, mixed my sauce ingredients and heated the peanut oil over medium high heat. Browned the chicken for about 5 mins in the peanut oil, then added the sliced onion and cooked that until soft. Added the sauce (without the other Tablespoon of cornstarch) and cooked for a minute, then added about a 1/3 c of peanuts and cooked for another 30 seconds. Served over white rice. Thanks for a great base - we will have this again as it was so simple.

I tripled the recipe and added a bunch of stir-fry veggies.  Tripled and served over rice, the recipe feeds 3-4 adults a good sized portion.

I used arrowroot instead of cornstarch.  Braggs instead of soy sauce.  I also only had a little bit of sesame oil, so I added some sunflower oil to make up the difference.  Extra peanuts!

I followed the recipe exactly as described. I even went out of my way to get those water chestnuts. It was disappointing. The chicken was bland, should keep it longer in the marinade. Also, the ratio of liquid to solids is way off. There is TOO much nuts rolling around and very LITTLE sauce to actually serve this with something like white rice.

Must alter amounts in ingredients to make it worth making. The first five or so folks that evaluated gave better amounts for the cornstarch and sauce.  Supposed to use 1 tbsp cornstarch for a whole cup of liquid.... That alone should help you see that the numbers are off. Did something get missed from the original poster??  Sorry, but as written, a bomb. As made with the adjustments from the top 5 reviews -- gotta to make it even edible.

My family really liked it.  Our Chinese student said it didn't taste authentic, but still thought it was very good.  I took the advice of many reviewers and doubled the sauce.  I also subbed carrots and celery for  water chestnuts, and added some ginger. Yum!

I made the dish exactly as is (except for the omission of sesame oil and peanuts bc of son's food allergies) and put it on a bed of sautéed green beans and mushrooms and it was perfect!  This way I don't need to add extra water or chicken broth which would mess up the consistency of the sauce. This tastes like it came from a restaurant.

I can only rate the sauce, which was delicious.  I made 4 times the sauce.  I made Kung pao shrimp.  Used raw, tail on shrimp marinated as per recipe.  First I stir fried sliced red onions, red bell pepper, carrots, celery.  Set on a plate.  Next I stir fried some unsalted peanuts.  Placed them next to veggies.  Then stir fried shrimp.  When pink I added the sauce.  Let it thicken, then added veggies and peanuts.  Heated and served. I only used tablespoon hot chili paste in the entire sauce.  I figured I could always add more, but didn't have to.

I made this into a vegan recipe, using TVP.  Chicken chunks,  I tripled  the sauce recipe , if you use the measurements given tree won't be much sauce,  also. I too think there is too much cornstarch.  The gravy was way to thick so I added water to thin.   It really tastes great.   I also. Replaced the white  wine with rice vinegar

Really good recipe. We like heat, so I added some cayenne peppers ( also recommend thai chili peppers) and served with fried rice. This felt a lot healthier than the greasy chinese restaurant option of this recipe. If you really like sauce, you may want to double the liquid ingredients for the sauce piece.

Had this for dinner tonight and it was absolutely delicious!! I did have to add one cup of water to the sauce and let that thicken up a bit before adding the chicken, but other than that the recipe was perfect. So full of flavour and great consistency, we'll be making this a lot at our house from now on. Also, for those who can't find chilli paste, we substituted 5 red chillis which we ground up with the mortar and pestle, along with a tablespoon of hot chilli sauce.

Love this recipe. Did what others suggested and doubled the sauce. I used shrimp instead of chicken and added onions, mushrooms and bok choy. Served over rice. This one will definitely be made again and again.

Since I didn't have and never used Hot Chili Paste I substituted Hoisin Sauce with is more like a paste away. Some of the other Kung Pao recipes I found online used also called for Hoisin. I also added 1/2 tsp Sriracha Sauce (a type of chili/hot sauce). Next time I'll add more because it was still very mild. Both Housin and Sriricha sauce are used in most my Chinese dishes so I knew I couldn't go wrong. This dish turned out great. Will definitely fix it again.

Delicious and easy to make--so much better than the take-out restaurant's version!  You can vary the chili paste to your liking, and I left off the peanuts because I didn't have any.  But I bet they'd add a nice crunch to this dish.

Quadrupled recipe and used chunky peanut butter instead of peanuts as that's what we had on hand.  Won't do that again.  I think I'll just lightly chop the peanuts for more crunch next time, larger size than what's in the crunchy peanut butter because they just got lost, but that was my fault.  Might go a bit lighter on the cornstarch and brown sugar when making it for 4 people.  GREAT FLAVOR!

Adding this to my favorite recipes.  The only things I did different were to use red pepper flakes in the sauce instead of chili paste, double the sauce because I also threw in a package of chopped mushrooms (mushrooms were cut into quarters, not sliced) and cooked the mushrooms at the same time as the chicken.  Delicious!!

I agree with others triple the sauce. I thought the flavor was good I made it just like it was written , I will make again with some changes. I will make more sauce,season the chicken , use boneless skinless chicken tights instead of breast.

This is really good.  I quadrupled the sauce and I think tripled the marinade.  I added peanut butter to the sauce as well.  Served with stir fried veggies.

Tried it a few days back..

Made a few changes to the actual recipe:Substituted the white wine with white vinegar and the chilli paste, with crushed red pepper and chilli flakes...Doubled the sauce as per reviews and used 1 tbs sesame oil.....Oh and also skipped on the chestnuts since I dont get those around here..
Since I'm a begining cook, my freinds thought I had ordered it in,it was that gud! :D
 Suffice to say this is going to the top of my menu planner..

Double or triple the sauce.  I only use 2T sesame oil total though and go a bit light on the constarch too.  I also add red pepper and quite a bit of chili sauce since I usually don't have chili paste on hand.  Finally, I use chicken broth instead of water and add about 1/3 cup to the sauce when simmering.

Meh. This was allright. Since I've never had Kung Pao chicken before, I'm relying solely on my husband's opinion regarding the authenticity of this dish. Although tasty, he felt that this was very one-dimensional and therefore not anything like true Kung Pao. We both agreed that the chile flavor was so prominent, it drowned out everything else. The heat level was perfect for us (we can tolerate a LOT of heat), but it was the ONLY distinguishable characteristic of this dish. As many others have done, I too made a few tweaks to suit our tastes. I added a coarsley chopped red bell pepper, a can of (drained, cut-up) baby corn,  cashews in lieu of peanuts (hubby's request) and rice  vinegar instead of distilled white vinegar. I doubled the sauce (because I added a considerable amount of extra veggies) and served this over cooked chow mein noodles. NOTE: I didn't have a single issue with my sauce being too thick as others have experienced. I had a cup of water at the ready, but never needed it. :) Egg rolls, steamed broccoli and green tea paired perfectly with our Asian meal. Thanks anyways, Arlena.

This was great! I didn't have white wine so I used chicken broth and also used hot chile sauce. I doubled the sauce after reading reviews, it turned out really good. It was five stars after that little adjustment.

My boyfriend and I eat asian food all over the city, and his favorite is kung pow chicken. Im not much of a cook, but I decided to attempt it. He loved it! Im a vegetarian so i made mine with tofu and it was absolutely to die for. Just as good as any restaurant dish! In fact he prefers it now.

Absolutely the best Chinese food I've ever cooked! I doubled the marinade and sauce recipe and it turned out nice and spicy. I'd cut a little back on the corn starch/water mixture for the sauce next time (since I doubled it it was a little too thick).

this was good if you just wanted a spicy sweet chicken instead of Kung Pao, at least what the restaurants here make.  I pretty much doubled all the ingredients for the sauce because it wasn't much of a sauce and I was making rice with it.  I also used tofu with the chicken.  I used Shaoxing vinegar instead of the white wine because I thought that might impart a bit more Asian taste.  I will make it again when I want something different with my chicken but will be looking for a true Kung Pao chicken recipe.

Everyone thought that this was just ok.  I cut back half of the chile paste for my son and it was still fairly hot.  The sauce had an odd flavor.

I followed it exactly. I hoped I would like it but that was not to be. I didn't think it was anything special.

What a great flavor!  I didn't have any white wine so I used a few extra splashes of red wine vinegar and it was DELICIOUS!.

WOW, we love this recipe.  We did increase the liquids by 3x and the solids by 2x for the recipe so we would have leftovers.  I had to use some other chili paste related item from the store because it's all I could find, but worked like a gem.  Have made it multiple times, LOVE IT!!!

All three kids and husband loved this and said I have make it again soon.  I doubled the sauce and next time might even triple it.  I didn't use as much chile paste as it calls for just because I didn't want it to be too hot.

We are a split vote on this one.  I really didn't care for it - it's not at all like restaraunt quality and the sauce was way too thin (glaze-like) for me and I'm a saucey girl.  But my husband raved over it and is excited to eat the leftovers for breakfast and dinner tomorrow.  My 15 year old liked it but thought it was a little too spicy.  Good but not great.

I thought that this was a good version of do-it-yourself Kung Pao. I loved it, my husband on the other hand thought that it was too spicy. The only thing I will do next time is decrease the amount of peanuts and add some more veggies.

wow this is spicy! But good!!!!! My husband said I have finally got it hot enough for him. You could easily use less chili paste to lessen the burn for those that can't take it that hot. I used sambal oelek chili paste ( the one with the roaster on the label.  The recipe is nice because you don't marinade the chicken in the chili paste only in the non-spicy marinade, so I took the kids portion of meat out before adding the spice.We will have again soon!!!! I served it with jasmine rice

The whole family loved this! I tripled the sauce recipe except for the chili paste as recommended by others and omitted the vinegar. The dish was just spicy enough, not too hot or too mild. I served it with jasmine rice. This dish is definitely a keeper.

Good- not great. Not similar to ones you can find in a restaurant. Add chili sauce only to the amount you can withstand- the amount in the recipe makes it quite spicy.

This was very easy and good. The directions were kind of funky, but I figured it out! I made exactly as stated, however I think I had a little more than a pound of chicken. I thought it could have used more sauce, and will probably triple next time, except I would keep chili paste the same!

I would give this a 3.5/5.  It was good, but didnt taste much like kungpao chicken, more like salty stir fry.  I followed the recipe exactly except left out the chili paste since my dad is recovering from a bleeding ulcer. I also doubled the recipe, tripled the sauce, and added one onion, 1 yellow bell pepper, and 2 red bell peppers.  Served over rice with a side of stir fried garlic green beans.  Was good, but was a lot of prep work and not really worth it. I don't think I will make again.

This was very flavorful.  I love hot chili paste and I was skeptical about the amount of chili paste hoping it would not be too hot.  It wasn't.  We do love hot food in this house however. If you like a lot of sauce I would recommend doubling the liquids, just not the chili paste.

Used a half jar of red curry paste instead of the chili paste, and the outcome with the rest of the ingredients was fantastic!  I also added a 1/2 cup white wine to add more liquid to the sauce.  Then, I added some red pepper chili flakes for a little more heat.  Definitely one I will make again!

This came out really good! It was my first time making something Chinese and I thought it came out pretty tasty.  I would, however, leave out the vinegar next time. It didn't need the tartness. One thing I must note, it didn't really taste like Kung Pao Chicken. There was a strong sesame flavor. Still good though!

I loved this, it was very tasty.  We would like more peanuts and I think next time I am going to at least double the sauce and add some more green veggies like snow peas.  I think I would also add about half again more chili paste as it was not quite spicy enough.  I felt way better about eating this than take out.

This is the best dish I've ever made.  I've made it several times now.  It's so easy and I can use whatever ingredients I have on hand.  I love the peanuts in this dish, but I had to replace them with almonds last time because we were out and it didn't really make a difference.  It was still great.

This is really good.  I try to rate a recipe after making it as written, but I couldn't find hot chili paste.  I substituted a hot chili garlic sauce - but I think I used too much.  Aside from the extra POW in my Kung Pao Chicken, as written, this recipe is yummy.  The chicken is perfectly cooked and the flavors are great.  I will definitely make this again with a few small changes:  I served this over white rice, so next time I will double the sauce.  The amount in the recipe is just enough to coat the chicken without any extra to cover rice.  I like the extra garlic flavor from the hot chili garlic sauce, but will use less than 2oz., as it was very spicy.  Overall, this recipe is a winner and fairly easy to prepare.

This recipe was good. I never cooked chinese food before so at first i thought it was gonna be a little difficult to get this done and it was not gonna be good, but I was wrong cause it was easy and it came out really  good.

The one thing I change when making it wa doubling the sauce (except the cornstarch)and it was still too thick.   I think it could have used more sauce  even after doubling it.   I will make more sauce today to go with the leftovers and add some veggies.   Will make again.

This turned out really good.  I feel it need red chile peppers in order to get the 5 star rating.  In future I will try it with peppers, they are often used in Kung Pao Chicken.

This was good, but it could have used some more flavour in my opinion. I made as written other than doubling the sauce, which I strongly recommend.

I guess 3 stars = "good".  Not great, not excellent.  I see no point in reviewing a recipe after making adjustments, so I made this as written.  Tasty, although I wouldn't call it kung pao.  Just a spicy Asian stir-fry.  Authentic kung pao should not be swimming in sauce, so I think the amount of sauce was right, if not the consitency.  It would be better with less cornstarch, and if you like more sauce you could always make some extra on the side.  No dried hot peppers?  No ginger?  I should have known better...  It's a good basic recipe on its own, though, could be used as a starter for other things.

Easy to make and tasted like a restaurant. I didn't add the chili sauce because we were feeding a young child and figured people could add it at their plate if they like. I added some veggies.

Oh my goodness that was spicy. I tripled the sauce, but put in two ounces of chili paste in instead of three and still super spicy. But all in all still fantastic.

We really enjoyed this dish. As suggested I doubled the recipe, but not the cornstarch. I added some sliced carrots and brocoli. I recommend to rinse the peanuts to reduce the amount of sodium.

Wow...I made this recipe last night and followed it to the T. I trippled the sauce though (Im a sauce girl) it was honestly better than any Kung Pao I have ever had. My husband and I argued over who was going to get the leftovers for lunch! ....I won :) Thanks for sharing it!!

Great with any vegetables, chicken or any meat for that matter.  Easy to scale and easy to increase heat level for those who love it. And as others have said in their reviews this is restaurant quality.  I have made it 6 or 7 times in the last month and I'm addicted.

It was DELICIOUS, but I did make a *lot* of adjustments. First, my chili sauce was more tomato than pepper so I added a few dashes of Frank's hot sauce. I also added a sprinkling (1/8 tsp maybe) of chili powder, and I added about 1/4tsp of red pepper flakes. Instead of chicken, I used half of block of extra firm tofu cut up fairly small, half of a red pepper, and half of a yellow pepper, but sauted them with veggie oil until they were all browned. It was kinda thick, I ended up adding 1/4c water to the sauce, but that's my fault - I accidentally did 2 TB cornstarch/water mix instead of 1 TB in the sauce, my bad. Oh, also, I didn't have the hot chilis, but still great. Thank you for showing me how easy it is to cook up something super spicy!

Great tasting dish. I added sliced green & red bell pepper & more garlic to mine. I also subsistuted mirin for the wine. The sweet spicy sauce was satisfying & the peanuts & chestnuts gave a great texture. I will try this one again.

Wow, I was surprised how good this turned out.  This recipe written alone is 4 but with some adjustments given by other reviews, easily 5 stars!  I doubled all the ingredients in the sauce except for the cornstarch and I still thought it was pretty thick.  I added celery, red pepper, and substituted cashews for peanuts.  My boyfriend and I loved it!  Enjoy!

this was a pretty good dish. I found it to be really spicy though, it had much more heat then restaurants do and that isn't necessarily a bad thing. I love spice food but this was so spicy that it actually kind of ruined the flavor of the dish. If you are going to make this dish i suggest either adding only 1/2 ounce chili paste or perhaps using a whole other ingredient instead. I also had to add a bit more cornstarch to thicken it up to my liking.

The sauce is GREAT! I make it with vegetarian satan (fake chicken), so I don't make the marinade. Instead I add a little more 1 tablespoon more of sugar and soy sauce to the sauce (and maybe a tablespoon of water if the veggies are taking a while to cook). I swap around vegetables too. My favorite is water chestnuts, zucchini, green onion, garlic, broccoli, and asparagus.

This was good, hubby loved it!  I quadrupled the sauce and added peppers and some green veggies and served over rice noodles.  I was a little annoyed...  I read to many reviewers suggestions.  I added water, but dont think I should have.  I'll make this again.

We really didn't care for this at all. It sounded so good - we were really disappointed. It was surprisingly uninteresting and tasted like nothing more than chicken sautéed in soy sauce to us. Sorry!

Oh man, this was fantastic! Doubled marinade and sauce. Then added veggies! It was a way to spicy for my husband but I could handle the heat!

This was my first time trying to make Kung Pao chicken. It turned out pretty good. It can be too spicy for people that dont like spicy food. My suggestion is use less chilli paste. I made steamed rice on the side with this dish. Give this recipe a try. You wont be dissapointed.

This was wonderful!!  I did not have chili paste, so I used chile sauce. I am not sure what the difference is yet. I am assuming the paste is hot.  I would like to use some chicken broth next time to make more sauce. There definitly wasn't enough....as we served it over rice.  My husband had two bowls full!! And wants me to make it again and again..

Delicious! I served this last night over a bed of brown rice and it was fantastic! I used siracha sauce because I couldn't find chile paste and chile sauce is just as spicy. I'm not sure what an ounce is tbsp wise but i used 1 tbsp and it had some kick, next time I'll be putting 2 in since we like our food spicy. I also don't keep wine of any kind on hand so I substituted that with some chicken broth and used rice vinegar instead of the plain distilled.

This was fun and easy to make, the only thing I didn't have and couldn't find was the chili paste. My family and I didn't really care for it. Didn't really have taste to it was like chewing on plain chicken, maybe the chili paste makes it taste better. I might try it again but still not sure. I didn't double or triple anything made it as it said and the sauce was fine, the only thing I would suggest is if you want to put it on rice and have the sauce on the rice then double/triple the sauce.

Way too much chili paste!  I like hot food, but I felt this was not the right ingredient to add heat.  Maybe fresh chili peppers would have worked better.  I also felt like something was missing, but I'm not sure what.  I think next time, I'll try using chili peppers and cooking the sauce for a few minutes without the cornstarch.  Then I'll add a little cornstarch slurry until I get the right consistency, because the way it's written here, it forms a thick paste really quickly.

I thought this recipe was fantastic with some changes that I made. I doubled the marinade and left it for 2 hours in the refrigerator and it was perfect. I also used about half of the marinade when cooking the chicken. I added broccoli, celery and matchstick carrots to this dish, therefore, I tripled the sauce for it, which turned out perfectly. I used 1T. roasted red chili paste and 2T. of sriracha sauce, which is a chili garlic sauce found in most Asian food aisles. **Just a warning** This sauce thickens up A LOT, which once added to the chicken and the vegetables covers very nicely, so don't worry. I made this with the Fried Rice Restaurant Style from this site and it was a super meal. Great recipe with some changes and additions, thanks!

This was really good and easy. I followed some of the other reviews and tripled the sauce so that I could add broccoli. It still was not enough. The sauce is good so make a lot of it...do not triple the amount of cornstarch, it will be too thick.

I added some bamboo shoots cause I like them, but I wish I had more veggies, like broccoli and/or snow peas. It needed something green. Sauce was a little gooey, but I did double it, so it might have been that I messed something up.The fresh chopped peanuts are essential.

I cooked this recipe for a company pot-luck and it was received very well.  I'm a complete novice in the kitchen so, of course, I follow the recipe to the letter, and the results were tasty.  I will be making this again.  Only complaint I received is that some found it a little spicy.  If you prefer less of that, cutting back on the chili paste should do the trick.

Delicious!!  So so good.  We doubled the marinade and tripled the sauce so we'd have plenty to serve over the rice.  Only added 2 1/2 T. chile paste and it was definitely spicy enough.  Tasted like it was from a restaurant.  A definite keeper.  Thankyou so much!

Delicious recipe...only additions were some brocolli and celery and then served over steamed rice.  Did add a bit extra chili paste as we like things extra spicy in our house!  Very authentic restaurant flavor...enjoyed it!

Just like the chinese restaurant's! I used Morning Star Vegetarian Chik'n Strips instead of chicken breast since some of my family s vegetarian. It was great I did add about 2 tsp of red pepper sauce to give it a little more kick as we like really spicy foods. A definite keeper! Thanks for sharing

Tripling the sauce requires 6 TBL brown sugar - too much for a diabetic.  I tried substituting 6 packets of splenda, but the recipe had a funny taste.

My boyfriend had fallen in love with Kung Pao Chicken at a fancy place in Beverly Hills.  I am sooo happy I tried this dish myself!  I added in extra peanuts and about 2 large tablespoons of the chili paste.  Yummy- but know that your kitchen will smell like sesame oil!

So good!  I tripled the sauce and added celery, carrot and zuchinni like my favorite take out place in VA beach added and it was just like theirs...which I miss living in Italy where you just can't get good Chinese food.  I eliminated the pepper to make it very mild for my family but added chili oil to my plate for spice.  Yum!

Just like carry-out!  This was my first attempt at Chinese food, and this was so easy.  Really good, too.  I doubled the recipe and tripled the sauce so I'd have enough for leftovers.  I used a Hot Chili Sauce instead of Paste because I couldn't find the paste: of course, it's possible that these are the same thing, I have no idea.  But, the results were great.  Served the chicken over fried rice.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is the best Kung Pao Chicken I have made - better than PF Chang's!  I quadrupled the sauce and added diced onion and red pepper along with a chili pepper for extra heat.

I've already shared the recipe!  A single batch is not usually enough. I also double the sauce and serve with rice.

This was really good but I also took others advice and doubled the marinade and sauce. I used a garlic chile sauce instead of paste and that worked great. We are not fans of water chesnuts so I used cashews instead. Good recipe, thank you!

I changed this a little bit. Omitted the water chestnuts, vinegar & wine, added ginger & fresh veges and doubled the sauce. A very tasty & quick stir fry!!!

I've made this recipe numerous times and it is delicious, better than any kung pao I've had in restaurants!!  Like the other reviewers, I triple the sauce (except for the cornstarch/water combo) to accommodate the veggies I add.  I substitute siracha chili sauce for the chili paste (a total of 3 TB for my spicy triple version). I also add a bit of water while cooking to reduce thickness. Very easy to make and will definitely impress your guests!

Very good. My hubby LOVES kung pao and is somewhat of an aficionado.  He said this is really good, but needs to be a tad sweeter for his liking. We like it a bit more saucy, not so thick, so next time I will cut the cornstarch called for in half and add an extra tsp of brown sugar. Great flavor!  I did stray from recipe only in my frying of the chicken. I dredged it in Panko breadcrumbs and fried it in 1/2 inch of canola before I added it to the sauce. Will add this one to my permanant file! Thanks.

I made this for dinner last night, and it was pretty darn good; I changed a few things though.  I didn't want to open an entire bottle of wine for just a few tablespoons, so in the marinade, I used 2Tbsp of water and a packet of chicken bouillon.  For the sauce, I just used water.  I doubled the amount of sauce and only used about 13 oz of chicken; I still ended up adding about 1/2 cup of water.  The only other change I made was that I didn't have any hot chili paste, so I used spicy Asian chili sauce instead.  The end result was really good, but it had no heat, so next time I will try using the chili paste.

I have found it to be an excellent dish for your leftover broccoli stems. To make it more healthy, I add little pieces of broccoli stems and frozen mixed vegetable in it and that's a complete meal in one wok!

This recipe turned out awesome!! I made a couple adjustments, such as 2x the marinade even though I only used 2 chicken breasts and I 4x the sauce - BUT, I only added 1.5 tablespoons chili sauce and 1 tablespoon of cornstarch/water.  It still turned out with a great consistency, although I added maybe 1/4 water just for my liking.  Since I only used 2 chicken breasts, I added fresh broccoli, 1/2 can of bean sprouts and a green bell pepper.  This turned out really well and I would recommend it although you should at least double the sauce!

I found this to be very bland.  I didn't have chili paste so used a chili sauce and possibly didn't use enough?  But even so, there was not a lot of flavor to this dish, certainly not like kung pao's that i've had in restaurants.

very flavorful and easy to make. I have one suggestion subsitute some soy sauce with some dark soy sauce for the same taste but a better color. Also there is this chinese hot sauce with an asian woman on the cover that is great. it's sorta like a chile oil.

This was really good.  I marinated the chicken, then cooked it in skillet for a few minutes, dumped marinade & sauce in with chicken (did not cook sauce separately).  I added some broccoli that I had on hand & did not have water chestnuts.  It turned out really good & was really easy.  The sauce cooked up quickly & so I made extra sauce & added it to the pan.  Very good.  I'd give 4.5 stars if I could, but didn't give 5 b/c needed extra sauce.

i'm sorry, but it is actually not the right recipe of Kung Pao Chicken.In fact, as a Chinese, i have to point out that the original recipe is completely different  from the one you gave, except for chicken and peanuts.
I rated the recipe as 4-star because i think it could give a new flavor, and it may taste good.
thank you.

I've never made a Kung Pao dish at home before but this was both easy and good. Be careful if you don't like it spicy!

One of our family favorites!  It's one of those that long after I'm full I'm still picking pieces out of the pan to eat purely because I love the taste!  I've changed the recipe for our own tastes - left out the white wine, used rice vinegar instead of white, add a little curry powder, some cayenne pepper and some tabasco sauce for added kick.  We love spicy!  I also sometimes add green pepper (when hubby's not around) and always add a can of baby corn.  I love this recipe!  I'm drooling just thinking about it! :)

Outstanding recipe!  My husband and I have been craving good kung pao since we left the west coast, and this was a great find.  A bit labour intensive but totally worth it.

I would imagine that reviewers who say this is not like any kung pao chicken they've ever had have never had authentic kung pao chicken.  I have a recipe from China that is quite simillar to this and it's amazing, I order kung pao every chinese restaurant I go it and ALWAYS think it's disgusting.  I have not made this recipe, but if you're looking for authentic, not american, this is close.

Totally agree with the other raters, sauce thinkens soo quickley, almost gelatin like, not that pleaseing to see. Also I didn't have sesame seed oil, so I didn't add it, but still think it needed much more flavor. I'll keep looking for another recipe, thanks though!

Great! Loved it.  I went ahead and doubled marinade and sauce and added about 1/2 cup water to sauce.  It was great.  and spicy to spicy for my 2 and 4 year olds.  But the adults LOVED it.

Wow!  I always wanted to make this like the restaurant.  First off, I punded out the chicken before slicing off real small chunks.  Also, I made a bit more sauce, and used more garlic and green onion.  OOPS!  I spilled some of the cornstarch water, and yes, just as other reviewers said, the sauce needed a bit of water - just a bit.  YUMM!  Served with jasmine rice.

This was hot as you know what and the garlic was a bit strong (could have been my fault though) but it had a pretty good flavor probably will make it again. Thanx for something different

Yummy!!! Yummy!!! YUMMY!!!  I used only half of the called for chille paste and it was fine for my husband and I but still a little too spicey for my 3 year old. I also  used cashews instead of peanuts.   I serverd it with white rice.  AWESOME!!!

After reading all of the reviews I choose to modify the recipe.  Glad I did!  Had to triple the sauce.  That worked out good.  Definately needed to do that.  Disolved 2 tbsp of corn starch in one 8 oz of chicken broth.  Started off with 2 tsp of the chili paste and added more according to our taste.  Also added vegies. Because I didn't follow the directions this might have turned out alot different.  But not sure how.  The family really liked the meal but so many modifications were needed I can only give it a 3 star.  Good luck!  Deleting this from my recipe box and will look for an all-star recipe that doesn't need all of the mods.

This recipe actually tasted like Kung Pao Chicken from a Chinese restaurant.  Yum!  I will be making this again soon. That being said, I will definitely do a few things differently.  1) I will double the chicken and quadruple the sauce. 2)I will halve the amount of chile paste.  This dish had me in tears it was so spicey.

I really liked this. Most of our family can't handle any spiciness, so I only used half of the amount of chile paste and it was perfect. Definitely plan to make this again soon.

This recipe was tedious and required too many mods.  In the end, I don't think the end result was what it was supposed to be.  It wasn't bad at all, it was just too much work for a mediocre result.  I had to make the sauce twice because the first time it turned out way too spicy.  I ended up using red pepper flakes instead of chilie paste and I added baby corn with the chicken.

I am giving this a 3 because of the sauce.  It was way too thick.  Had to really play around to get the right consistency.  Would probably not make again.  Sorry

I am constantly craving Chinese food, but can't always afford to go out to a restaurant.  This meal I could actually make myself with easy to find ingredients and it tastes closer to restaurant food than anything I've attempted yet.  The main modification I made was to add the water from the can of water chestnuts.  That made the sauce runny enough for me.

Very tasty. I made a couple of minor changes: Used a little less chili paste, added some vegetable stock to thin the sauce a bit and added sliced zucchini. I served this over brown rice and it was a very tasty filling meal. I'll make it again.

So very easy and so very tasty.  I added extra spice and garlic - but then again - I do that to almost every recipe.  Great for this dish - not so great for Chocolate Cake.....

I doubled the sauce and it was still not enough.  My husband liked the nuts with the chicken.  He mentioned that it's a great low-carb dish.  We thought it wasn't bad, but not great.  If I make it again, I will use less corn starch.

This is a wonderful dish, I love it!  I've made it quite a few times and even with substituting ingredients it always turns out perfect!

My husband and I made this one evening and really liked it.  We didn't have all the ingredients, so we did some substituting, and it turned out great!  Tasted just like when we go out to get it!  Only better for us.
