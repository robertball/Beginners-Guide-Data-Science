This was so good and will definitely be added to our regular dinner rotation.  I did make a few changes based on personal preferences and what I had available.  I added some oregano, basil and garlic powder to the cheese mixture because that's what I do when I make my lasagna filling.  I made a few substitutions: penne instead of ziti; mixed grated Italian blend cheese for the mozzarella and used jar spaghetti sauce instead of plain tomato sauce.  Lastly I sprinked a combo of freshly grated parmesan, asiago and romano cheese on top instead of just parmesan.

Next time I going to bake in a 9x13" baking dish because it was just a bit much for a 2.5 quart and it took about 10 minutes longer to bake but I think a larger baking dish would eliminate the extra baking time.

Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I made this exactly how it stated. It was ok. It was bland, could have used some good seasonings. I think with some garlic, onion powder, a little more salt, and Italian herbs, this could be really good. I would have also added more cheese (it's a little dry). My kids and hubby thought it was pretty bland compared to other Italian dishes.

This was a good base but I tweaked things. I added salt pepper garlic powder oregano and basil to the tomato sauce and ziti mixture. It was tasty but came out "watery". I also used part skim ricotta cheese.

I think this is a great base recipe that leaves a lot of room for your own twists and preferences. I used Rao's jarred marinara sauce, Sargentos 6 cheese blend instead of mozzarella and a tsp of my own Italian seasoning blend...along with a pinch of red pepper for a bit of heat. I found it very helpful to slightly undercook the pasta a bit, because it will continue to cook in the oven and I didn't want it to turn to mush. I added both the cheese blend and Parmesan cheese on top, as we like a lot of cheese in our baked pasta dishes. I didn't bother to measure the cheese on top - I just kept adding until it was covered to my liking. I baked it until the dish was bubbly and the top slightly browned (we like a good crust). 
. Everyone in my family loved it, and my sons actually went back for thirds! I will definitely be making this again...easy, fun and delicious!! Thanks for a great recipe. :)

Love this easy ziti recipe.
Made some changes , added some extra Ricotta,  used our own sauce, added no egg-salt-or pepper, (already in our sauce).
Baked at  350 for 30 min in a 3 gt  dish.
Fantastic.  Almost forgot, used an extra couple ounces Ziti.

This is great recipe! Easy and delicious. My 3 year old loved it and he's generally a pretty picky eater so it made me very happy to see I'm enjoying it so much and asking for seconds!

This was very good, however, it was very dry.  I used Jarred spaghetti sauce instead of just plain tomato sauce.  Much better in my opinion.  Next time, I would double the sauce.  Otherwise, it was delicious!

I took everyone’s suggestions and added more seasoning, sauce , and cheese.   I used Krafts new extra creamy mozzarella cheese that has a hint of cream cheese and it was delicious.   I’d make it again

It’s pretty good but needs modifications.  1/2 the ricotta, 1/2 cup additional marinara, bake for 40 instead of 30.

I have used this receipe for many dinners where I have cooked for 250 people.  I use store bought spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce in it.  Always well received. Love it!

Made a more flavorful pasta sauce. you know, sauteed onion, garlic, carrot, added dried basil, oregano and thyme, maybe 1/2 tsp sugar to some high quality organic canned crushed tomatoes. Then followed the recipe. very good and satisfying

As others suggested, I added Italian seasoning and garlic powder to the tomato sauce. I also swapped marinara sauce for the 2 1/2 cup portion. I doubled the mozzarella in the ricotta mixture, and sprinkled more on the top before the Parmesan. We love this dish and how quickly it comes together.

Way too much ricotta. The noodles were great but we didn’t like the consistency — too mushy.

Very good, even my pickiest children gobbled it up! I mixed 1lb of seasoned, browned ground beef into the sauce, and added fresh chopped parsley to the ricotta mixture.

I made this with just a couple of changes. (I know, I know.)

I used a jar of Emeril Garlic pasta sauce and 1 8 oz can of tomato sauce, 1.5 pounds of ground beef, and a can of mushrooms. I left everything else the same. Recipe was easy and got rave reviews from my bible study group. Will make again!

I added more mozzarella on top over the Parmesan cheese. Baked for 30 minutes but could have gone to 35, probably because of the extra cheese on top. Easy to make. I would make again. Classic hit!

This is super quick and easy to make.  As "tomato sauce," I used bottled spaghetti sauce (Francesco Rinaldi) seasoned with garlic and onions.  My picky son ate it up!

This is my favorite baked ziti and stood out amongst many other baked ziti dishes at an event. I use Rao's sauce and it makes a world of difference. Totally perfect.

Liked it. Would use much less mozzarella in the cheese mixture and save it for on the top. Mine needed more sauce in the pan.
