Simple and delicious! This was great for an easy meal on the grill. My husband loves bratwurt, but we never thought of adding bbq sauce to it before - what a great flavor it added! Very good on crusty French rolls.

A friend brought some grilled brats over the other night covered with BBQ sauce instead of injecting. The flavor was tremendous. I never would have thought to combine barbecue sauce and bratwurst.

Had this last night for dinner, and got rave reviews. In this house we love brats, and this is just another great way to prepare them.

This was good. We fixed these yesterday at work on our Foreman grill at our "Wiener Palooza 2". Fun! Thanks :-)

This was ok and better than regular bratwurst because I like the taste of barbeque sauce more than the taste of bratwurst but I didn't find it worth worth the effort. However, if you love bratwurst, I think it would be worth it. I don't eat it myself or serve it enough to warrant adding it to my collection as there are so many other recipes out there that I would prefer to eat and serve to guests.
