I haven't made this recipe (I'm just giving it 3 stars so I can make this comment).

To the commenter who doesn't like hard cookies, recipes like this are generally *supposed* to produce hard cookies. I make one very similar to this, based on my grandmother's recipe.

I'd suggest though that if you don't want the cookies hard, just don't refrigerate the dough, and they'll come out softer. And if you want them less flat, put in an extra teaspoon of baking powder.

This made a very good, slightly crispy and chewy cookie. My seventeen month old and husband loved them. The first batch I made I put twelve cookies on the baking sheet (standard size) and they spread into each other. The next batches I put just six cookies to a sheet and they came out great. They were not the texture/taste I had hoped for (wanting to find a recipe *just* like my moms)  but they were still excellent. I rolled and cut out the cookies rather than rolling the dough into a log and then slicing it. I plan on making some glaze for these next time. The taste is very buttery and very good.

My Husband, Mom, my dog, and I loved these cookies.  This recipe creates a good cookie base that lends itself to additions like nuts, chocolate chips, cocoa, liquor....it reminds me of a cookie mix my Mom used to find at Sams Club in the 1990s.  I mixed by hand and then used a cookie scooper instead of creating logs, chill, and slice.  They were very good cookies and plan to use them soon for Christmas!

Been using this same recipe since I was a teen. Easy and very useful recipe which makes a basic sugar cookie with loads of potential.

Excellent as written! Thanks for sharing. I used a variation because I wanted lemon sugar cookies and added the juice of 1/2 lemon + zest to egg/sugar mixture before adding flour mix. Wonderful!

Super easy!!  I didn't have enough stick butter, only had 1 1/2 sticks, so I used 1/4 c of shortening.  I didn't refrigerate the dough either.  I scooped out about 1 in ball size and placed it on the sheet.  Baked for 10 min and they were perfect!!  Chewy but crispy on the edges.  WOnderful!!!!

Very nice.  Not too sweet, not to crispy or chewy.  Perfect amounts of all of the above.

This recipe was really good, but I did adapt it to use very soft butter and baking powder and half the baking soda. I used this to roll cookies and cut, it worked beautifully.

Tastes just like a sugar cookie should.  The only little thing I would mention is to use medium or large eggs because I had small eggs and it the batter wouldn't stick together so I had to use 3 eggs and it was perfect.

These were very similar to the cookies my mom made while I was growing up.  Not as hard as I remembered them being.  It's been 2 days since I made them and they are still quite soft from how I remember icebox cookies being.  I did change the sugar, though.  I used Splenda, and only 1 cup at that..  I kept everything else the same and they were finished in my oven in 7 minutes.  Nice and golden brown.  I'd give them 4.5 stars if I could... the flavor is excellent, but I wish they would have hardened up a little more so they'd be better for dunking into a hot cup of tea.  Maybe refrigerating longer would help?  If I recall correctly, my mom always chilled hers overnight, not an hour...

These are amazing sugar cookies! I rolled them with a pin instead of slicing and didn't sprinkle with sugar, since I frosted them. I brought leftovers to my grandfather in the hospital (he's totally fine now) and all the nurses were asking for the recipe!

I love this recipe!!! I have been using it for over a year now and use it as my main sugar cookie recipe. The only thing I change is that I double the amount of vanilla too add more taste.

This was my first time ever making cookies of any sort. But what I found was a very simple and versatile cookie recipe. My 1 yr. old daughter loved them and I don't usually give her sweets of any kind. But she and I both fell in love with the light, almost airy taste of this cookie. It had a nice crunch to it, too. A really good combination. I added lemon extract to the last batch and that turned out wonderfully.

Difficult to roll out, but if you just slice them off the roll they're fantastic. Don't really even need to be iced!

This recipe is delicious!!!  Easy to make too.

I made the dough then refrigerated it in a long roll wrapped in wax paper.  Then after it was cold, sliced cookies out one by one and cooked.  Simple!

I baked these cookies for the first time...I was in the mood for some real sugar cookies, and that is what I got, not some store bought junk. I was very pleased with the results! They were ever so crunchy on the edges and chewy inside. i only wanted a couple for my craving, so I half the recipe and made 12 cookies. I added rainbow sprinkles on top to make them look more appealing instead of regular sugar.

I am a great cook, but up until now have been a supreme failure at sugar cookies.  These are so easy and everyone that tried them said they were the best sugar cookies ever!  Absolutely perfect and they store really well!

Good soft cookie.  Because of the ingredients I had available I used 1 cup of light brown sugar and 1 cup of Splenda.  I normally like VERY sweet cookies. These weren't too sweet, but that just means that I can eat more of them!  Fiance liked them also (and he's SUPER picky)!

Perfect!  I left them in the fridge overnight and made them the next day.  I rolled them out and cut them into circles.  Sprinkled some sprinkles and nuts on them and baked for 8 minutes.  Perfect!  I've never had luck with sugar cookies, but this one was just like the store bought dough.  Will use again because the kids LOVE them!

I love a simple sugar cookies recipe like this, becuase you can choose to use the fridge or you can just make the cookies without firming them. And you can add all sorts of things to a simple recipe like this, like putting sugar in the raw on the tops of the cookies before they bake, or little chocolate bits. Or you can add food coloring to the dough and make this marbled looking affect.

Was not impressed with this recipe. The cookies came out extremely flat and hard. Even when I lessend the time in the oven they where still pretty hard. Was not very flavorful as well.

These cookies are so buttery and delicious! I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and also was able to freeze two of the three rolls and thaw and bake them later with still a great taste. I followed the recipe exactly, just letting the rolls thaw overnight if frozen.

These cookies turn out very soft and chewy on the inside and crisp on the outside. I've had five people ask me for the recipe after taking them to one party so I'm not the only one who liked this recipe.

As written, I think this is an okay recipe (my biggest complaint was the flatness of the cookie). However, I wanted softer cookies so I didn't refrigerate the dough. I also found the dough recipe unusually sticky and, after the first batch fell extremely flat, added another 1/2 C flour to it. *MUCH* better.

Easy recipe and works great for cookie cutters. I also sprinkled decorative colored granulated sugar before baking the cookies.

These cookies were easy to make, and when you scale down the recipe to make 24, it's just right for a small group of people. If you don't refrigerate the dough, the cookies come out much softer. Overall, good taste :)

This would have been easier if I had a rolling pin, but they still turned out great!

Well my only problem was that the dough was way to crumbly. I like a softer cookie so  i used shortning and buttert half and half. Family loved them. the second time i tryed making them i added cinamon sugar to the tops befor baking! Yummy. The third time i added 1/2 cup of peanut butter to the dough and made delicious peantubutter cookies! Love the Recipie. Very simple and delicious!

I baked these cookies without the whole fridge and stuff, which probably defeated the whole purpose, but I baked them like regular sugar cookies, and they were pretty good!

This recipe for sugar cookies tasted great but was just really a mess. It blobbed everywhere once in the oven, and within 1 minute too long or too short in the oven they would be completely goo or completely burnt.

It's a little rude to rate an item lower if you haven't made or tried them. These cookies are delicious. They are simple and turned out better than my Mother-in-law's...and that's what's REALLY important isn't it ;)

Great flavor!  The only reason I didn't give this recipe five stars is b/c I rolled it flat to use with cookie cutters, and it's very, very, sticky.

Excellent! I did what the other person said...didn't freeze it, and added 1 tsp of baking powder and they were GREAT! Nice and fluffy, not too chewy, and golden brown around the edges.

I love this recipe because it uses less butter than most! For my cookies, I squeezed a nearly-ripe orange into the creamed mixture before added the dry ingredients. It made the cookies taste light and delicious! Lovely recipe, I highly recommend it! -Miss Joy

I made these for church and was requested to make them again. Tons of compliments on them.  I cut the sugar by 1/2 cup because i decorated them with frosting, sprinkles, etc. and didn't want them to be overly sweet.
