Oh, how my family enjoyed this homemade "Almond Joy".  This is a keeper that is frequently requested and very simple to make.

The taste is very nice, the almonds add a great texture but the bars/squares didn't stay together. The icing stuck to the coconut mixture, but the coconut mixture did not adhere to the chocolate base at all. It was really messy to cut. Perhaps with another can of Condensed Milk to make the coconut and almond mixture more gooey it would stick. Not sure I'll give this another go. I'm very sorry :(

Soooo yummy! (and easy to make!) I was searching for a recipe just like this with few ingredients...because I didn't want to go to the store.  I substituted walnuts for almonds. I used a nonstick pan (un-greased) and subtracted 5 minutes from each cooking time.  I did not find it messy at all like another reviewer did.  I suggest using the nonstick pan - even the caramelized condensed milk scraped right off.  I found an icing recipe on All Recipes and used that. I think this is a wonderful recipe and my bf (picky, picky) wants me to make it all the time.  Thank you, this was perfect!

2.2.20  Yes, this really does taste similar to an “Almond Joy,” but better.  Fudgy, rich, gooey, and chewy.  Be sure to let this totally cool down before frosting because it will firm up and then frosting it will be very easy.  Looks like this recipe has been around since 2002 with few reviews, and I’m glad I found it, even though it’s now 2020.
