I made this recipe as a side dish with My Fillet Mignon Bruscany recipe. I found it to be a perfect match with my steak. The saltiness of the feta was tantalizing to the pallet against mild flavor of the steak. I highly recommend this as a great side dish for steak.

I tried this recipe yesterday, and it was a HUGE success. My whole family are picky eaters, so it's usually super hard to find a recipe everyone can enjoy. When I made this, there wasn't a single complaint. Highly recommend. Love it!

I am only rating this one the breading/frying method of the mushrooms, as this was a last minute decision and I did not have the feta for the sauce...The mushrooms turned out great! I've never made breaded/fried mushrooms at home and was looking for an easy way to do it, this was it! These were perfectly cooked...the breading stayed on nicely and the mushrooms themselves were tender and juicy. It's not even dinner yet, and they are pretty much gone, lol. I will def be using this method from now on, and I can't wait to try the sauce next time too! Thanks for sharing. :)

The mushrooms on their own are very bland and are in need of some salt.  I even used Italian bread crumbs!  Now the dipping sauce helps out tremendously.  When you let the sauce sit it looks like a normal sauce, but when you stir it up and start dipping, it's like cottage cheese looking.  It taste fantastic though, but the feta just does not get a smooth texture to it.  Would definitely make again...just season up the breadcrumbs more :)
