This is one of those recipes that has my friends thinking I'm a gourmet chef.  I made the following modifications:
On the advice of my fishmonger I treated the salmon fillets to a bath of lukewarm, lightly salted water and the juice of one large lemon for about 20 minutes.  This makes for a more delicate and nuanced taste.  
I substituted boxed chicken broth for the water/bouillon.
I used an English (burpless) cucumber for the sauce.  
Speaking of, the sauce is a perfectly light, delicate accompaniment to the salmon.  I can think of quite a few other uses for that sauce as well.  Excellent recipe!

I made this recipe for my parents, who are following the South Beach diet. I have never made poached salmon before and the recipe was surprisingly easy (after tracking down the ingredients, which took some time). I could not find vegetable bouillon and I don't eat meat (except for fish) so I substituted Veg-it seasoning for the chicken bouillon the recipe actually calls for. The salmon was perfectly tender and delicious, and the sauce was an interesting accompaniment. I am sure this salmon has much less fat than my traditional method of broiling it in an olive oil/chili powder rub, but it was not nearly as tasty as that method either, so I can only give it three stars. I was still hungry after dinner.

Everything about this recipe worked perfectly and it was good. I don't usually care for chilled salmon/fish, but this was really tasty and makes for a good leftover snack. I will be making this again.

I cooked this on a cold winter's day, so it was served warm.  While I still preferred my own recipies for grilled and smoked salmon, this is a very tasty alternative to the old standards.

This was okay, but not very flavorful. I was expecting more.
