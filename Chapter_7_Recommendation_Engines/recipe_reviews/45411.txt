I searched out this recipe because my new sis in law wanted to bring a new tradition to the family. she put me in charge of the "flaming figgy pudding" on christams eve and I decided it needed real figs. We bake in in a bundt pan and put a metal dish in the hole, fill it with lemon extract and light it on fire while we sing "we wish you a merry christmas" It's pretty dramatic. This recipe as I recall tastes pretty much like bread pudding with figs instead of raisins. the lemon sauce was the best part, and that's a different recipe completely. If it wasn't for christams and we made everyone eat it, it probably wouldn't get eaten. After writing all these thought down, I'm not even sure I'll use this recipe this christmas.
