Excellent recipe! Not too thick at all, as mentioned in other review. I thought the proportions were perfect. What I like even more is that this soup has a thick, creamy consistency, without using fatty creams like most other butternut squash soup recipes.  Bonus! The squash can be a bit of a pain to peel and prepare, but the end result is totally worth it. An option would be to half the squash, scoop out the seeds, then cook it for a few minutes in the microwave to soften slightly. This would make peeling much easier.  I used my immersion blender to whip everything up right in the pot.  A minor detail, but step #2 and #3 should be reversed. You can cook the quinoa (step #3) while the squash is simmering so that everything is done at once.   One slightly deviation I made was to only use 1 3/4 cup water to cook the quinoa (after rinsing it well to remove any bitterness!). In my experience, I prefer a slightly firmer texture to the quinoa, and when I use a full 2 cups it is slightly mushy.  A tasty and healthy recipe overall, one that I'll be making again!

I made this with the traditional mire poix of onions, celery, carrots and few garlic cloves and the ginger and used a roasted garlic broth and nutmeg roasted butternut squash, cooked everything together and puréed it all in my blender. I did not use the cumin in the seasoning or quinoa in this soup, I dipped fresh French bread instead. Absolutely scrumptious.

Cumin and squash were not a good combo in our opinion.

Topped with about 1/2 tsp of smoked paprika.  Awesome and you can eat all you want and not worry.

Tried it but too thick needs less quinoa 
definitely takes much longer than 10 minutes to prepare.
 Probably 1/2 an hour getting squash ready

This recipe was excellent! I made it as stated, except I did not have fresh ginger, so I used 1 teaspoon of ground organic ginger. I'm a vegetarian, so I used vegetable broth instead of chicken stock. I had previously roasted and mashed butternut squash and froze it, along with a double batch of quinoa that was also frozen. I sauteed the onions as directed in oil, then added the stock and the frozen butternut squash. It cooked up beautifully, I then used my immersion blender and then added in the frozen quinoa, which quickly defrosted in the soup. After adjustments of salt and pepper seasoning, the soup turned out fantastic. This will be my go-to butternut squash recipe from now on, it is so basic yet delicious and there is room to add more spices as you like.

I served 5 family with a variety of reactions. My DH had nothing good to say, my DS said that half a bowl would have been fine, my DD says there are other soups she enjoys more and my SIL ate all without comment. I liked it but the cumin is strong.

Dynamite!  Made it 3 times in 3 weeks. 
Made the following tweaks based on reviews. 
Less cumin
1 & 3/4 water to cook quinoa and cooked it while soup was cooking so both finished at the same time and were both hot. 
Veg broth instead of chicken. (Think I’ll try chicken to see how it tastes)

I was skeptical about this because first, I have never tried quinoa, and second, the ingredients looked bland. But wow! What a tasty soup, and not too hard to make. I did use veg broth in lieu of chicken, and I doubled the cumin and ginger. Husband liked it, too!

Cooked my butternut squash in the crock pot and it made scooping the seeds and meat simple! Then I just puréed everything in my blender and put it in a pot. Didn't have fresh ginger, so I used a small amount of candied ginger. It actually was quite good that way. Excellent recipe and one we will be using again! Yummm!

Good - but I feel too much cumin.  Next time I'm going to put only 1/2 tsp - it overpowered the taste of the squash.

Very easy to make and super tasty, the quinoa makes it very filling.  Will make this one again for sure.  I did add a bit of light cream to give it a nice colour and taste of course.

Made this recipe 3 times...still a favorite of my wife and daughter. Instead of quinoa, I add one large potato ( or 2 small ) with the squash, and blended everything. I also put a bit of medium curry to give it a bit of oomph!

I made this soup with vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and I used vegetable oil instead of butter.  I also pre-cooked the squash and added turmeric in this soup for health benefits.

The only change I made was the addition of 1 tsp of tumeric, and that was only for health reasons. My husband loved this soup, it has great color, aroma and texture. I loved it because the ingredient list was short and simple. On a chilly fall day, this could be the answer to "what's for lunch?'.
