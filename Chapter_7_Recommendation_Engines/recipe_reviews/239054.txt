Any veggies would work with this, I added sliced mushrooms and used red peppers. I think 1/4 cup of olive oil is too much - I used just enough to barely coat the bottom of the skillet.  I didn't want to add the black beans and have them muddle the colors of the other food so those I added at the end, next time I would probably just skip them altogether.

We really enjoyed this as presented.  Next time I might try adding 2 or 3 tbs' of chopped green chili.

We were looking for something different for breakfast today. Seen this and decided to give it a try. We followed this recipe to the T. It was amazing. My 10 year old son is not a big fan of eggs. He had a couple bites and ended up eating a plate full. We will definitely be making this again. If you like breakfast burritos, this will work great with that. My husband and son both made a burrito with these eggs.  You can use any veggies and you can also spice it up. They added tobasco sauce to the burrito. Next time I plan on putting spinach in this. Very easy to make!!!
