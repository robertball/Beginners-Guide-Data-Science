Wow you gotta try this Salmon recipe it is really really good. Make sure you buy two cans of frenchs fried onions because you will eat the other one.  The crispy coating is full of lemony flavor while keeping the moisture in the Salmon. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves lemon and fish together.

Thought this was really tasty. My husband liked it so much I taught him how to make it. Simple, add a green salad some rice, and you have a great dinner. (We made it with a defrosted frozen salmon fillet and was fine...)

Quick, easy, and suprisingly delicious! I have never used the French Fried Onions, but they balanced the whole dish perfectly.  I love dill so I doubled the amount! The family ate it up!

We liked this but the salmon tasted a little fishy.  Next time I will buy fresh instead of frozen.

This is so easy and delicious. I splurged and used fresh copper river salmon. I will try it again with Atlantic salmon, I'm sure it's just as good. Followed the recipe exactly. Thank you for submitting!

Really  good.  I only had 1 cup of the onions, and it was plenty.  Made with some 4 Cheese Couscous and the combo was delicious!!

I made it as the recipe calls and although it wasn't bad i thought the flavors were much too stong together. I think with some mellowing this could be much better.

My family really like this.  I used a fresh fillet and followed the recipe directions.  However,  it took a little longer because of the thicker portion.  Also, after removing from the oven, I topped with shredded parmesan cheese.
