Having lived in Buffalo for the past four years, I can authoritatively state that any wing sauce containing Italian dressing is hardly "authentic."  Stick to a mixture of Frank's Red Hot and butter if you're aiming for a true Buffalo taste!

All I can say is DELICIOUS!
I have tried different recipes but this one is the best.  Even better then the restaurants I have been to.  I made fresh wings and breaded them in flour with paprika.  I also made chicken strips and used this sauce.  My husband couldn't get enough of them.

I fried chicken legs and soaked them in this sauce (prepared exactly as described using tobasco as red pepper sauce) and it was extremely hot. Not spicy but hotter than anything I've ever eaten before. Somehow it was hotter than pure tobasco sauce. I think it was the soaking. What I did was make sauce, then fry chicken, then I soaked the chicken in the sauce in the oven at 170 deg F. until I was done frying the chicken. It was so hot it hurt to use the bathroom afterwards. 5 stars for authentic taste, but don't recommend soaking chicken in it. Use it sparingly or don't use as much tobasco sauce.

I can say that I was a little "weirded" out by the Italian dressing part, BUT it really adds something to the sauce!! I think the Italian dressing MAKES it!! (That & I always use Franks Hot Sauce!!)     Anyhow, I have been using this recipe for over a year now & just looked it up to use for dinner tonight. I had to leave a review since I noticed others were asking why Italian dressing was being used!! I hope this helps!! Try it - you'll like it!!

The hit of our Super Bowl!  I was so proud my chicken tenders came out just like a restaurant's with this sauce.  Didn't change or add a thing.  I will use this often!

Though I haven't ever tried this sauce I feel the need to off set the person who gave it zero stars and hadn't even tasted the recipe.  Italian dressing is very versatile and I have faith that when I do try it, it'll be awesome.

I loved this recipe. I like how the italian dressing gives it a wang vs. just hot sauce. You get flavor instead of just heat. I've made this for my husband and for a crowd and never had anything but compliments. Lots of times I've been asked for the recipe. Great recipe thanks!

We tossed baked Tyson breaded chicken nuggets in this!  I thought it tasted like the spicy garlic sauce at our local wing restaurant -- my husband wished it was spicier.  We'll try this next time with Frank's extra hot, like a previous reviewer recommended.

This is a great recipe as it is!  The Italian dressing brings in the Vinegar, Garlic and Pepper Seasonings...I only had Blasamic Italian and I used that and it was awesome.  I wanted a little more "spice" so I spooned in some cocktail sauce, and some jalepeno sauce.  That did the trick for me!!  We used it on popcorn chix...it was yummy!  Thanks!

This was amazing.  I was skeptical to add Italian dressing to a buffalo sauce but it made it so thick and creamy.  I used Frank's red pepper sauce and it came out great!

Is it a creamy or clear Italian dressing? If you can't get Frank's (I live in the UK), will Tabasco do ok?

If you like a salty sauce this will work, however it was a little too much saltiness over powering the 'hot' in what is expected with Buffalo sauce. What I did was also add a little olive oil to soften the salt taste, then some ground chipolte pepper seasoning - the chipolte peppers got the sauce level of heat to a nice balance from saltiness of the Italian dressing. I used a commercial brand dressing, but think the home made Italian dressing mix on this site is what I'll try next time.

Yum.  Different, but good.  Be careful of the dressing mix separating from the butter.  This is a new twist on "Buffalo" wings that we really enjoyed.   I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.

Whew well that was a really good Buffalo Sauce. I'm still trying to tweak it all and figure out how Hooter's wing sauce tastes. But very good.

Very good sauce.  The italian dressing added a nice flavor to it.  I didn't add as much hot sauce as called for, but the dressing gave it a nice kick to make up for the missing heat.

I made this sauce with 1/2 cup butter as written but only added 3/4 cup of Crystal hot sauce because that's all I had, and so added just 3/4 cup of Italian dressing. Really delicious. Will be making this sauce again and again. I buy several pounds of boneless chicken breasts, trim, pound, rinse and portion them out into several quart-size freezer bags. I add to the bags inexpensive Italian dressing to marinate and leave bags in fridge for a couple of days--turning them a few times before putting into freezer. Using this chicken defrosted, drained, but not rinsed, coated in seasoned flour and left to dry on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Pan fried in 1/2" of vegetable oil at medium high heat in *skillet for just a couple of minutes per side until browned and then on a separate, clean wire rack baked for 18 minutes. Cooled for a few minutes then using tongs dunked them in this sauce. *I recommend using cast iron skillets for frying in oil cuz they can handle the heat. I made the mistake once using a thin-ish metal pan to fry chicken wings and it turned dangerous very quickly. Cast iron skillets cost around $15 to $18.

Though it wasn't bad, it tasted nothing like store-bought buffalo chicken wing sauce.

Yummy & spicy. Mixed sauce in with frozen chicken "nuggets". Broiled on low. Oh yeah baby they were hot! Forgive the pun

Definately has a kick to it! Used it with grilled chicken sandwiches; it was really easy. Will make again.
