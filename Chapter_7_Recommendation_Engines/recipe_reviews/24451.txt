Really good recipe. It's a very soft gingerbread kinda cookie.  The taste may come of strong to others so what you can do is reduce amount of ginger or cut down on the molasses (maybe 3/4 cup?). If you decide to go on with the orginal recipe, make sure you put a thick layer of marshmallow frosting so that the sweetness of the marshmallow cuts through the gingery taste of the cookie. Really good cookie!! Very soft and that marshmallow frosting is a nice touch!

We used to buy these when I was a kid. They came in a package that was red, covered with clear plastic. The absolute best with a glass of cold milk. This is comfort food!! I have made 4 batches of them, and they are just like what we used to get. But, they are better as they are fresh, not off the grocery store shelf. I have not been able to find them in a store for years.

I was really disappointed.  They were not a spicy ginger at all.  Next time will add a LOT more ginger, but they were soft and good.  Just not what I thought they would be.

These cookies were excellent!! The frosting recipe made too much, at least for the amount we used per cookie so I might reduce to half next time. In order for the frosting to harden, let them sit at room temperature for several  hours.
Oh, and unlike most cookie recipes where the total is referring to tiny 1.5" cookies, this recipe actually does make 72 LARGE cookies.

This recipe is only for the cookie, not the icing since I didn't make it along with the cookies.  Nice cookies, although I don't think a half hour is enough to chill this dough.  I made the dough around 5:30 am and went to bake the cookies around 8 or 8:30 am and it was difficult to work with as cutouts, so I ended up doing only a pan of cutouts and the rest as drop cookies which I smooshed with some sugar and the bottom of a glass. I then had hubs try to see if he felt they needed the frosting and he didn't think they needed it.  I agree; they are sweet enough and if you like gingerbread cookies, you will love these.  They make a ton and my mixer was straining a bit with this mix.  Thanks for the recipe!

My sister remembers my grandmother always having these when she came to visit... She loved them then, and still loves them, thanks for the recipe.  The recipe does make a lot of frosting, but that's okay, be generous with the frosting, the cookie itself is not sweet at all.  As the frosting sets up over the next day, it does seams to condense a little too.  They are a bit of work, but well worth the effort!

These is a cookie that my dad remembers as a boy, so I make them just for him.  They are wonderful, but I do double up on the spices as that's how my dad likes them.   Traditionally they are cut out with a spam can, but since I won't buy spam (too processed) my dad has to settle for regular cookie cutter shapes.  But that doesn't stop him from nibbling on them every time he walks by them.  Awesome recipe!

I made these last year for Christmas and just made up he dough again last night. I agree with pomplemousse that the dough needs to chill a lot longer. I forgot about that experience last night when I went to cut them out. Goopy mess. Hopefully chilling overnight will do the trick. They are delicious!

Really good recipe. I made these at Christmas. The frosting is really good but it makes A LOT. I froze the left over frosting and used it at Valentine's Day.  The cookies were as great as I remember them from childhood. I didn't have a Spam can but cut them into rectangles by hand. I also used cookie cutters for these. Overall, a nice cookie.

I made these for hubby, he remembers from childhood and can't find anymore. Dough is very tender and must be handled gently. roll with PLENTY of flour on top and bottom before rolling. I found that insulated cookie sheet worked best for them rising a little. I uses butter instead of shortening, cutting back milk to 3/4 cup. (I sour the milk with T vinegar since I don't normally have sour milk)

I wouldn't recommend this recipe. I had a really tough time and I feel I am a seasoned cook.I tried to roll out the dough to no avail. It turned out more like cake so I put it in a jelly roll pan instead. Also this is double size what most cookie recipes are! It came out ok as cake but too salty.
