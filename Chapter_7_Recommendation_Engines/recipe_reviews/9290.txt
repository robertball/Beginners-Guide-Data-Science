My husband and kids loved this bread!  I substituted applesauce for the butter and egg beaters for the eggs, it was just delicious!  I also cooked it in two loaf pans, so I'd be able to share!

We weren't sure to use dark or light brown sugar. We chose light and it turned out great! We put a bit of whipping cream on when we served it.

Spactacular recipe!  I didn't change anything except for not adding the almonds.  This tastes excellent just the way it is.  I took it to my son's preschool for a special snack and it was loved!  I am making it again for Christmas right now.  Only note I have to leave is that I used loaf pans and it definitely makes more than two!  It overflowed all over, so now I am making it into four loaves, two cups of batter each.  We'll see how it turns out!

This is delicous! Beware that the batter makes very big loaves; I split it into two pans.

My kids could not get enough!!! Thank you for sharing. Don't open the door (or in my case don't let the kids roam the kitchen) of the oven before it's done, otherwise it goes down just like a cake.

I followed this recipe completely, except no orange liqueur available to use.  Prepped the pan, but the cake baked unevenly (dry on outside, still uncooked inside), and it fell apart when I tried to remove it from the pan. Flavor just okay.  The raisins and nuts did not help the flavor.  What did I do wrong???

This turned out very good - and that's saying something because I am not a great cook. I made it exactly as instructed - minus the almonds (none on hand).  It is very moist, and made the whole house smell wonderful. I made it in the mini-loaf pans to give in Christmas baskets - baked for 35 minutes, turned out perfect.  As a side note - my boyfriend said it was good but thought the orange flavor was too strong and took away from the traditional gingerbread flavor he was expecting.

We made this recipe two times this christmas.  My daughter and her friend made one together that my daughter's friend took home and then we made one just for the house.  It makes a lot of dough so a large house can be made with many features around it.  My daughter and her friend made a thick house so it needed additional internal support.  The second one we rolled thinner and it turned out very well and no supports were needed.

I don't know if I screwed this up or not, but it did not look like the picture and did not taste good.  It was too many flavors and not sweet at all.

Loved it. Moist and flavorful. I made a few substitutions based on what I had in my cupboard; loquat liquor instead of orange, buttermilk instead of sour cream, and dried cranberries instead of raisins. Yum!

Simple and easy batter to make. I am not a baker and found this extremely easy to recreate. i even replacing the orange liqueur with red wine and turned out fantastic. Total time to prepare and bake less than 2 hours. Got me girlfriend in a good mood when she was experiencing a terrible day

Really lovely recipe and worth cooking just for the wonderful smell that filled the house!!  As per other reviewers I upped the spices a little and mine was cooked in 65 minutes.  Definitely a keeper!
