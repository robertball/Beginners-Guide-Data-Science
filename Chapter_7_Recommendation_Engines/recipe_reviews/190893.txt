We have an enormous fig tree in our yard and this recipe gives me a great way to use its fruit and all the frozen bananas we accumulate. So simple and the figs really make the smoothie creamy. My husband even loved it and he's not a fig fan. I'm going to try to freeze some of our figs so we can make this smoothie all year.

Loved this!  I had an abundance of figs this summer and froze them in zip lock bags.  I was looking for a recipe that would utilize them and this is it!  I used frozen figs and a fresh banana and non fat milk.  I also made it again and added a serving of fat free greek vanilla yogurt, it was yummy and made it thicker, more like a shake. Thanks, this is a great way to use up my figs a few at a time and help me in my pre-holiday dieting!

Actually I give 3,5 stars. I don`t know maybe it were my figs or orange juice, but this smoothie was very very sweet. This is the reason we didn`t enjoyed it so much. Great idea and figs go great with orange, but the sweeteness really overwhelmed here.

This is a great recipe!  Based on previous reviews, ingredients I had at home, and the fact that my figs weren't particularly sweet, I used 1 frozen banana instead of 2 (I don't like smoothies with too much banana flavor), 6 figs, 3/4 cup almond milk, 3/4 cup orange juice, 1/4 cup vanilla yogurt, and 1/4 cup of ice cubes (to add an extra frozen element, because I didn't use the 2 frozen bananas).  It was great!  It makes a great summer morning treat, and was a hit with my kids, who didn't like fresh figs before this.

Surprisingly delicious, considering I do not like to eat raw figs. This smoothie tastes like it has berries in it. I really like it, and highly recommend it. Thanks Sam!

Fabulous!  I used some very ripe bananas, unsweetened soy milk and high pulp orange juice,  and it came out wonderfully thick and had just the right level of sweetness.

This smoothie gets points for being quick, easy, nutritious, and delicious! My family really enjoyed it. I made it dairy-free by using almond milk (son has a sensitivity).

This was actually REALLY good!  My ONLY complaint is not enough fig.  I did 8 decent sized figs and still did not get much flavor from them.  still tasted super good though (mainly of banana).  Thanks!

This was very good - I cut it down to one serving using two figs.  I didn't have orange juice on hand, but it would be perfect with this, so I did have to add a bit of honey for sweetness.  I also added about 1/4 cup of non fat yogurt.  Very tasty! Thanks, Sam!

The recipe is very similar to what we get at Tokyo Garden, a local Japanese restaurant. The restaurant serves this sprinkled with baby shrimp and garnished with a lemon wedge. I sometimes go easy on the ginger when I make this so that it is not too spicy for my son.

Delicious smoothie! I'm not a big fan of figs on their own  but had and abundance in my freezer (from my mom's tree)so I've looking for recipes to use them up, I realized at the last min. that my milk was rotten so I had to use half cup of fat free vanilla yogurt and 1/4 cup of fat free half and half still it came delicious! Thanks for sharing your recipe! Elvira Silva. Oh, I forgot to mention I used two extra figs.

The only thing I would review is the frozen banana part. It makes it cold but that's hard to unpeel and it wasn't necessary for me and my mom to cut it.

Love this!!  I have a huge bag of figs from last fall in the freezer, so I searched for a smoothie calling for frozen figs. This is the closest I found. Changed it up a bit to improve the nutrition and lower the calories. Mine is only 275 calories for all this:  Â½ banana, 4 frozen figs, 1 small orange, 1 cup of coconut-almond milk, a little cinnamon and ground cardamom, and 1 tsp of maca powder. Yumm!!!!

It was fantastic! My kids had two servings each. I added 6 teaspoons of wheat germ to make it healthy. I used fresh bananas, figs, and the rest was the same as the original recipe. No sugar added was a huge bonus! I also added yogurt to make it creamier. Thank you. Will be making this again and again.

This is a good idea, but I just didn't care for it.  I think I would prefer it more without the orange juice, and maybe with vanilla yogurt instead.  I would also recommend adding more figs per serving; it's easy to "lose" the fig flavor, which I find nice.

Easy to make and very smooth.  It has a fairly thick consistency.  I was surprised by the lack of sweetness, especially given my figs were pretty ripe.  Next time I'll add a tablespoon of sugar.

Good way to use up frozen figs from summer.  I added flax seed to bump up the nutrition.  I've also used hemp powder and put some plain yogurt in in with a bit of honey.

Tastes like bubble gum! I've never had figs before, but my mother-in-law brought these fresh figs over and I had no idea what to do with them. This is a well-balanced smoothie, and if I ever come across figs again, I'll be making it again. If I liked figs more, it would be 5 stars.
