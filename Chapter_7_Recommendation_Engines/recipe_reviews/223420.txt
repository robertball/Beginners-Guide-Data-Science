I made this as a quick dinner for the kids. I used garlic dills instead of sweet, a red pepper instead of green and Hellman's mayonnaise instead of Miracle Whip--that's really just a personal family preferance, not a reflection on the recipe. Though I did not try this myself, the kids LOVED this salad. They thought that using american cheese and bologna in a cold salad was the best idea ever. My son said it's like eating the best parts of the bologna salad mixed up with pasta. Winner, winner.........pasta dinner!

A new guilty pleasure to crave! I used ditalini pasta, green onions instead of red, dill pickles instead of sweet, and mayo instead of Miracle Whip. All of this was based on what I had on hand, and/or family preferences. Also, I tripled the celery for extra crunch. It was the PERFECT amount of creamy deliciousness, and one could serve this as a one-dish lunch, or even a summertime dinner. I never would have thought to put these ingredients in a creamy pasta salad, but it totally works!

This recipe has been in my recipe box for a long time.  Decided to give it a try.  The guys liked it better than I did.  It is definitely a much heartier macaroni salad than most.  It was creamy the first night I made it, but as with most pasta, it soaked up a lot of the dressing and I had to add a little more the following day.  All-in-all a good recipe that would go over well at a get together.

My husband really loves this salad.  If he's going to a potluck, no matter what time of year, this is his preferred dish to take.

I thought this salad was excellent and I received many compliments. It is important to make this a day before you are going to serve this salad, as the flavors meld together. Fantastic.
I did use garlic dill pickles instead of sweet pickles.
