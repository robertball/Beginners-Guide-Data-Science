Love this recipe, but I made a few adjustments. I pre-seasoned the chicken with fresh green seasoning adding a bit of salt to taste. Now, I didn't have the Neufchatel cheese, so I used the Philadelphia cream cheese with chive and onion. But while making the sauce, I also added a dash of basil. It tasted so delicious,that I'm on my second plate...... Oh and this is the very first time trying this recipe.

Husband went nuts over this.  I do think come summer time the chicken would be better grilled and then sliced and served over noodles - but it was fine when made as directed.  I did give the chicken a good rub of Cajun seasoning before cooking; I also added a sprinkling of dried red peppers, some parsley, and used 1 cup stock and 1/4 cup half & half as it was getting ready to expire.  I was worried the sauce was too thin, but it thickened up nicely after sitting a bit.  Thanks so much for recipe :)

If  you don't have heavy cream on hand but cream cheese this is excellent substitute for alfredo sauce. I seasoned chicken with Cajun seasoning and cooked in 2 Tbs of butter with large clove of garlic  minced.  When browned remove chicken and add 2 Tbs of butter and 2 Tbs of flour cook a couple of minutes till smooth (you may want to use wisk to incorporate  we'll. Then add broth cook till smooth and  bubbly. Then add cream cheese till smooth add pepper and salt to taste. Great recipe!

The basic recipe was a good start. I added a splash of white wine and some parsley. I also used minced fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  I was also surprised to see the recipe didn't call for any salt.  Salt brings the flavors out in foods, so I added about 1/2 tsp., which helped with the blandness. It was very easy to make and after the tweaking, my family raved about it. I will definitely make it again with the additions.

I've now made this twice, love it and have added to my regular rotation. The beauty of this dish is that it tastes far better with this sauce than anything I've poured out of a jar, and yet it is still super easy to prepare with little mess to clean up afterwards. I will be cooking this again soon!!

This stuff was great!  Just like Olive Garden without the price tag.  The only thing I would change is perhaps reducing the chicken broth to 1 cup.  Took longer to thicken than the recipe said.  Other than that pretty perfect!

This is a restaurant quality recipe. Made it just last night and there were no leftovers. Its quick to make I used what was called for instead of regular Philly cream cheese. Quick tip on cooking the chicken, was that I cooked the chicken on medium-low till cooked through only. Then I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper. Then because there will be a lot of liquid in the pan I turned up the stove to high and cooked the chicken until there was just enough caramelization on the chicken and by then the liquid was all cooked out. Caramelization doesn't mean burned. I cut the cooked chicken into bite-sized cubes and reserved it to the side. Then I made my sauce. This is an excellent recipe.

I almost forgot. I made a GLF using Bob Red Mill's GLF flour 1:1 then I tossed in 3 tsp of cornstarch to use as a thickener. You can't even tell the difference. The cornstarch will make the sauce thicker than using just regular flour. So when making you rue put in tsp one at a time to thoroughly mix it up. Then add some more chicken stalk a tablespoon at a time to liquify if it's too thick to even it out.

Our 12 year old grandson requested chicken fettuccine  and I liked that this recipe didn’t use heavy cream, so I thought I would give it a try.  Not only was it easy to make it was very tasty as well.   We all declared, “It’s a keeper!”

My family loved it, especially my 5 year old.  I love the fact there's no heavy cream involved.  I sautéed some garlic and added chicken.  Opted to cook the sauce with the chicken instead of removing chicken.  It's flexible for adding your prefered seasoning.

So I give a three but not because there is anything wrong with the recipe per se it's the ingredients that I'm having trouble with. For example you use Kraft and Philadelphia cheeses but you're making the sauce from scratch. Wouldn't it make more sense to use some good dairy cheese in that case? If your going to cook from scratch I believe in going all the way otherwise you're not really cooking from scratch you're just doing things the hard way and still getting those processed cheeses that are no different than the stuff found in a can of Ragu or Classico. So what I would do is revise your recipe into two versions. One version would be with real cheeses and creams and the other with just a really good Jar sauce like classico. I would highly recommend going to a deli or a butcher for real fresh cheese, or If your feeling adventurous go to an actual farmer! That simple change of ingredients from store bought "scratch" cooking to actually DIY cuisine can easily spice up your recipe into a 5 star meal because this recipe IS good. My compliments especially on the part where you cream the cheese into your alfredo, again "good cheese" is better but you are actually doing something very professional here even using your supermarket ingredients you are cooking your alfredo sauce the real way where as most people just slather boiled noodles in cheese and call it alfredo you are actually using your creams and infusing the two items together to create a genuine sauce, so that's what ma

Made it as the recipe stated only doubled the sauce.  Took a while to thicken but my husband and son liked it.  Not sure if my parmesan was just really mild but I think I'd like to give it a bit more cheesiness next time.  The sauce was very creamy but  mild.

Next time I'll try this: Pre-soften the cream cheese, and stir it  until it's creamy. Add a little of the liquid fom the recipe to it, and mix it until smooth before adding the cheese mixture to the sauce.

Man, I didn’t like this at all. Super bland to me. I’d rather eat something else. Probably won’t make again. 2 stars because it was easy.

This was amazing!  We added some wilted spinach to the mixture at the end, it fit well with the flavors. The sauce wasn't too heavy like most restaurant versions, it was just right. )

This was an amazing base for fantastic fettuccini. I fried the chicken with Italian seasoning. I also steam fried some broccoli,  thinly sliced bell pepper and minced onion (with a pinch of salt, pepper, & a smidgen of cayenne) to add to the mix. when I stirred the chicken back into the alfredo sauce, I added the veggies and fresh spinach & continued cooking until the spinach was wilted.  It was dang good.

Like many others, I tend to read reviews before making a recipe to see what many believe made it that much better. Other than swapping out the Philadelphia neufchatel cheese for Philadelphia cream cheese with chive and onion and added fresh basil on the finished product , I follwed the recipe and it was amazing. My boyfriend and sister loved it as well.

I made this with my boyfriend he added is own zest to it and we used basil from our garden for the sauce. I added some Lemmon and rosemary to the chicken and it turned out lovely!

Good and easy meal, however I found it needs salt and lacks a little butterish flavor that I prefer. These small changes, along with some Italian seasoning will ensure a an excellent dish in my opinion. Thanks for the recipe!

This was AMAZING! I followed the recipe but thankfully others shared there own secrets.I added the Philadelphia Cream Cheese with Clove and Onion and I didn't use reduced fat broth and I sauteed my chicken smothered in Italian Seasoning..IT was yummy!

Great tasting recipe. I was looking for an Alfredo that didn't use cream because I didn't want to drive to the store. This is a keeper. I wanted to use up some bacon so, I did make a rue with the drippings and only used 2Tblspn of flour. I also added frozen green peas along with crumbled bacon. It was excellent!

Instead of neufchatel, I used about 2 ounces of cream cheese and some leftover ricotta. My chicken was leftover also, so it was pre-cooked - I just added it to the sauce along with some broccoli.

I have made this recipe several times. It is so easy, but definitely needs added seasoning. I seasoned the chicken with Italian seasoning and garlic salt to taste before cooking. I used the cream cheese with chives and onions as someone else suggested and I added frozen peas and carrots into the mixture.  I still added the garlic powder and pepper as in the recipe. Love this recipe and will always use it for a quick and easy meal that the whole family loves!

I made this with some lemon pepper rotini instead of fettuccini. made for an absolutely amazing dish. I do wish it made a little more alfredo sauce with the current measurements, however.

Easy to make and taste so very good. I added whole garlic instead of garlic powder and it was excellent. Will be making this again very soon. Taste so much better than jar sauce.

Love the homemade sauce/cream! Kids loved the sauce/cream better than the canned sauce I used to buy. It didnt' take long to make it and it was easy. :)
