This is an easy recipe to do. My whole family loves it, though, my husband likes them fried. This is a good after school snack or appetizer at a cook out.
Thanks,
Denise & Family

I tried following the recipe exactly how it was written and baked the roll-ups like it said but they turned out tasting bad.  I might have done something wrong, but I think that they would be better if they were fried.

These are just okay.  They are good when you want something sweet and you don't want to eat junk food. My daughter thought they were good, but she likes almost everything.

I made it exactly as the recipe read, except I coated exterior  top with butter to ensure good browning. Don’t know if this was necessary, but the end result was fantastic.

Don’t be thinking of McDonald’s apple pies when you eat these...these are half the calories, twice the size, and the filling does not resemble apple pie filling. The egg roll wrapper is barely there, taste wise.  If you think of them as something completely new, it’s cinnamon apple delight. If pie crust is your favorite part of apple pie, then this recipe may not be for you.

I was looking for something to make using the egg roll wrappers without frying, and decided to try this.  They were pretty flavorless, unless it was a bit of the apples, which did cook well.  I don't think I will make these again, but if I did, I would fry them and sprinkle them with cinnamon sugar.

Good, but too chewy and hard to bite when made in the oven. Definitely don't reheat well either.

As written we didn't care for these.  Filled with cooked apple slices and fried are great but baked with chopped apples just didn't do it.  Sorry - I wanted to like them.
