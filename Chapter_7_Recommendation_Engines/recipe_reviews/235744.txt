This recipe has it almost right.. I put my potatoes boiling in a small pot. After cooking the bacon in the big pot I removed it and added my chopped veggies(not potatoes) and butter to the meat drippings. May have added some of the clam juice to help. Softened those then added not quite a cup of flour and cooked a min or two stirring the whole time. Then The rest of the clam juice plus another bottle while stirring and bring to a simmer til thickened. Added the milk and creams, seasonings, bacon and potatoes and let sit a bit. Then at last the clams and a pinch of sugar! Was pretty good but a day or 2 later reheated it was amazing! I would highly recommend making it the day before for a make ahead meal! I did not use spinach and would also add more clams next time.

I do not understand all the reviews from ppl who said there were no clams.. it is listed in the ingredient list AND added to soup in step number four. "STIR IN MINCED CLAMS...". THTIS IS A MARVELOUS RECIPE, tho I did not add the spinach.

Awesome recipe.  Had to add more milk to keep it from being too thick but other than that I give it 100%.

Yes, this was an easy recipe and yummy, too.   I didn't have whole milk (used 2%), clam juice, nor half and half.  The other changes I made were using 2 cups whipping cream, doubled all the spices and the vegetables, added 1 t garlic powder and decreased flour to  1/2 cup.  Wow, it was a good recipe!

This does look like a good recipe but personally I would not go through all the work and not add the clam. With that said, if someone didn't like the clams then this would be a good recipe, although I have not made this particular recipe it is very simular to one I have made several times.

PS: To "Ron the Cook", yes, you add the bacon at the end with the drippings, keeps the bacon from melting into the chowder.
