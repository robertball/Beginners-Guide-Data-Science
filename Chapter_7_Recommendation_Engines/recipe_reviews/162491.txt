Thanks for the *push* I needed to step out of my childhood grilled cheese w/White American and yellow mustard standby.  I didn't have any cheddar, so I did use provolone and white American and I also added ham for some protein, but it would have been fantastic w/out the ham (and w/whatever cheese you prefer) as well!  I liked this so much, I may just have one for lunch today, too...

I used regular yellow onion, sauteed a little bit first, and very thin slices of cheddar and mozzarella. I also just used cooking spray instead of butter and this sandwich was excellent. What a good idea.

This was sooooo good! I had white cheddar and american, so I just combined both. Also, I used white bread. This was really tasty and we all enjoyed the combination of flavors. I will be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Wow, this was great! Admittedly, I made a few changes to combine it with my other favorite grilled cheese sandwich. I used American cheese instead of Cheddar because I had it in the house...I also spread a little whipped cream cheese on one side and sprinkled the insides with italian seasoning. So good...I would never have thought of this combo, but it was delicious!

I used swiss cheese and zesty sandwich stackers with the Vidalia onion. I also
used a light spreading of mayo on both
sides of the sandwich. 

Quick sandwich for a mom on the go!

My Vegetarian wife and son love this vaiation of the (plain, old) grilled cheese sandwich! Thanks for the recipe, Lainey!!! I had a jar of carmelized onions from our last canning season that I used for these. Made for a delicious "swwt and sour" effect!

This was surprisingly good. I used processed Swiss sliced and a red onion; I sliced my pickle length-wise. I think I will saute the onion a little before adding it to the sandwich so it has a little less bite. I used to make something similar (when I was a child) in the microwave with canned tuna, processed American cheese slices and pickles; I would layer it all on a sandwich and nuke it for a minute or two. I may try chopping up the onion and pickles into some canned tuna layered between the slices of cheese, and grill it. YUM!

This recipe sounds delicious. On my pickle sandwiches, all i do is spread a little miracle whip onto my bread, put on a couple of pickles and toast the sandwich. It's so delicious!!!

I tried this because of the vidalia onions.  I always have pickles on my grilled cheese, but the onions were a nice addition.  It made for a nice quick lunch, just what I was looking for.  Thanks Lainey for sharing your version of a grilled cheese.

Interesting sandwich.  The first bite was a bit odd to me but after that it was pretty good!  Made exactly as directed.  Thanks for the recipe.  This is definitely something I would not have thought of.   I might make this again for my husband to try as he LOVES pickles.

This is the grown up version of grilled cheese! I love it :)  This has given me so many ideas - sundried tomatoes, black olives and mozarella?  I will be experimenting!

I couldn't quite decide whether I liked this or not. Some bites were good and others were too sour.

just made this with marbled cheddar. kosher dill and yellow onion. i covered the bottom bread with sliced onions, topped with pickles that i sliced, then the cheese and placed it on the George Foreman grill. i was pleasantly surprised at how good it tasted, maybe because i didnt expect i would like it. it has crunch, a little sourness from the pickle and a little sweetness from the onions. i suggest you try it.

Holy mother of delicious. I omitted the onion, and added a swipe of cream cheese on one side as a previous reviewer suggested. I also used bead and butter pickles and used sharp cheddar. My boyfriend couldn't get enough!
