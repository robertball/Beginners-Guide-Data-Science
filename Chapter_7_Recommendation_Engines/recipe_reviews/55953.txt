Delicious! If you read the other reviews that said this didn't "set" then they probably made one or both of these mistakes: The blender you use to make the mayonnaise must be COMPLETELY UTTERLY DRY. Only make this recipe if you haven't used your blender for at least a day and it's totally air-dried. Also you must add the oil to the blender at a very very slow drizzle to get the mayonnaise to set up properly. Do these two things and your mayonnaise will come out perfect every time!

I like it a LOT! I put a shallow metal bowl on a dish cloth draped over a larger bowl. Much easier to whisk. The bowl was DRY and the yolk room temperature. The dijon mustard lemon juice salt & 1/4 t paprika was whisked first then the SLOW (this is absolutely essential--I probably whisked very quickly for 6 minutes or so) process of whisking the oil in which worked great! At the end I put in 1 t horseradish for more bite paprika and 4 cloves of garlic crushed minced and pounded. Tomorrow I will adjust seasonings and strain. mmm! I'm surprised I haven't seen this dip with yam 'fries' which is one of my favourites to order at a restaurant. I dunno what they put in it but I think I'm getting closer! ps if your mayo 'separates' (tastes like yucky oil and is lumpy) don't throw it away! Get a new bowl a new yolk with some seasoning and whisk it. Now pour in (VERY SLOWLY!!!) your ruined mayo very patiently and wha-la!! your mayo comes together beautifully ';-)

My friend in Valencia Spain taught me to make this wonderful aioli. I make it on Thanksgiving to serve over halved scored oven baked potatoes sprinkled with olive oil and paprika. Add this sauce and the potatoes are delightful. My entire family waits anxiously for aioli & potatoes on Thanksgiving...and all are hoping there's some they can take home. I now make each family a container of aioli. I wasn't taught to use the mustard but was taught the egg yolk must be room temperature and to use several cloves garlic...for a "zip" in the taste. I was also taught to use a submersive mixer...or whatever that gadget is called...that comes with it's own mixing cup. When made as Puri taught me...this recipe deserves 5 stars. Grandma Pam

My husband went nuts over this recipe it was incredible with crab cakes. We ate it ALL at dinner with just us two! I read all the reviews and suggestions...egg yolk at room temperature add paprika increased raw garlic to 4 cloves. I would add that I would run the garlic thru a press for the most garlic flavor. Also this tastes very different alone as opposed to with food. Don't discount it until you accompany it with shrimp salmon croquettes or crabcakes. Next time I will add chives fresh basil and some herbies too lazy to wander to the garden today: November 1 and 90 degrees in Tucson AZ! Thanks to all for suggestions and LIANNEF for a great recipe! UPDATE: I just made my Salmon Cakes and for the sauce here I doubled this recipe with 2 egg yolks 2 teaspoons of dijon mustard and then added 4 giant cloves of fresh garlic but STILL only put in 1 cup of EVOO. Lemon juice ended up at 1 Tablespoon; I added the 1/2 teaspoon of Giant Kosher Salt Flakes while whipping the Aioli. At the end added Freshly Ground Black Pepper on top to taste a splash of olive oil and toasted pine nuts. YUMMY! No paprika. Enjoy it we keep it in the frig for other seafood for up to 2 weeks.

Tweaked by less oil (about half) double the dijon and garlic used lime juice and seasoned with salt cracked pepper and a couple of pinches of sugar just to balance the taste. Fabulous consistency even hand whisked. Everyone loved it used as a dip and a salad dressing.

I found this recipe easy to make in my blender the first time. The second time I used a different blender and tried two batches--to no avail. So...I took about 1 cup of canola mayonnaise whipped in about 1/4 c. or less of olive oil added two minced garlic cloves a splash of lemon and some pepper. Not as fabulous as the homemade on my first try but a fine substitute.

I used this recipe and added some fresh Tarragon. I then used it as a dipping sauce for fresh deepfried Artichoke hearts.

Excellent alternative to plain store-bought mayonnaise! Although I think the recipe calls for a bit too much oil the first time I tried the recipe it seemed to be setting until the last little bit of oil I added... BUT i took MJJK's advice and started over with another egg yolk and it turned out perfectly! (thanks MJJK!) One thing though is I find the aioli has a litte bit of a bitter after-taste is that just me? It is delicious none-the-less! (and quick!)

I had a hard time getting this to set but I have a feeling that was my problem not the recipes. I was finally able to get the correct consistency by adding the "ruined" oil to another egg yolk and pouring the oil in so slow it couldn't even be considered a trickle. That did the trick however and the final product was quite good. I served it with grilled artichokes.

I think I made it right I drizzled the olive oil in SLOWLY while I furiously whisked but I didn't like the end result. I don't really like mayo so go figure. I thought it would taste different fresh but I still don't care for it. I'm sure mayo lovers would like this simple little dipping sauce but I do not!

I was expecting a mayo consistency but all I got when this was done was an oily mess. Perhaps I didn't whisk fast enough (but I did eventually use a blender). Maybe I'm not a pro chef but if you aren't either I'd think twice aboout trying this recipe.

It came out perfect. Although I added a little more oil it was so thick.and also added extra garlic.

Dimensions don't seem right on this recipe; perhaps they meant to say one tablespoon of oil or something... I used 2 egg yolks 2 tsp dijon 1/4cup grapeseed oil 2 cloves garlic juice from about half a lemon and salt& pepper to taste. The consistency with these measurements was perfect. Chopped some basil to add at the end magnifique!

I read all the reviews was careful to have a very dry blender room temp egg yolk etc and it still turned out super runny and unusable. Would not make again.

All I could taste was the oil and I even cut it back. Tried adding more seasonings (lemon garlic cayenne and even sugar) to salvage it but nothing worked. It set just fine but tastes awful.

I can't rate this recipe although I love aioli and I will try it soon..I have a question however....Husband and I dined at a new restaurant and ordered "fried olives" (believe it or not! They were terrific!) served with aioli. Our server told me that the aioli was made with egg white.. anyone ever heard of this? if so please submit your recipe..thanks Lala

This recipe required a bit more lemon juice and salt than I expected but it's SO worth the testing. Served it over crab cakes and it was outstanding.

It did not set up despite following recommendations of other posters. I instead threw it over my salmon and used it as a baking marinade. The flavor of the salmon was tasty with it.
