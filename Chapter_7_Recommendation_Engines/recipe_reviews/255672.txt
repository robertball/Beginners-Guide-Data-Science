I followed this recipe but the amount of Almond Milk is 2 cups when it should be 1 cup.  I wound up with a very thin, soupy filling and twice as much as I needed to fill a 9” pie pan.  The taste is pretty good.  Instead of sugar I used 1 tablespoon of honey and that was sweet enough for my taste.  I’ll probably try it again with 1 cup of Almond Milk instead of 2.

Really love this dairy free recipe! My roommate eats dairy free and she couldn't get enough. However,  1 cup of almond milk is PLENTY for the filling. If you add 2 cups, it will turn out runny  in the middle. I also added 2 tablespoons of flour to help the mixture set better.  Will definitely keep this recipe for later.

Pumpkin pie is my favorite and every thanksgiving I make 4 for my family’s gathering! This was the most flavorful pie I’ve ever made! I tweaked 2 things:
1. I didn’t add the extra egg yolk
2. how I baked it - I used the traditional instructions of 15 mins at 425 degrees, then 40 mins at 350. 
It  didn’t come out as firm/set as usual, but it held together. 2 cups of almond milk was fine.

Followed insights from other reviewers and only used 1 cup of almond milk. Took 90 minutes to fully set and bottom crust was a bit soggy. Probably should bake at a higher temp initially (425?) to set the crust then reduce to the recommended temp, which would also probably reduce the baking time. Also a bit sweet for me. Could probably reduce the sugar a bit. Overall though a great option for the lactose intolerant among us!

I should have read the other comments first. 2 cups of Almond milk is too much. I should have used 1 cup. I had to pour some pie filling in a separate no crust mini pie pan. The taste is there. I had to bake it for 60 to 65 minutes.
