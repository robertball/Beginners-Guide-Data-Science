Great taste and low in calories. Just add a clove of garlic to the olive oil before cooking onions zucchini and mushrooms. Use seasonings without measurements, taste the sauce until you like it. And don’t skip on the fresh parmesan it gives the pasta a lot of flavor.

This went a long way in helping me use up ingredients that were either opened or about to go bad.  At first, I thought this called for way too much seasoning. I read through the reviews and saw where some had stated this was bland, so  I decided to stick to the recipe.  Much to my surprise,  it was bland!  But, the only thing it needed was a little salt to perk it up.

I made this for dinner last night and everyone liked it. I did change it a little. I added some lean ground turkey that I sauteed in 1 Tbsp. 
of olive oil. We eat extremely low fat for my daughter. I then cut the Italian seasoning to 1/2 tsp. and the pepper to about 1/4 tsp. I added 
1/2 tsp. of basil and cut the sugar to about 1/2 Tbsp.
Then I had a brain fart and instead of 6 oz of spaghetti I cooked 16 oz. It was still very good. Then tonight, since I had so much left over :) I heated it up and added about 1 lb of steamed, crispy asparagus that I cut up and mixed in. Oh YUM. It was as good if not better tonight. I got lots of positive comments.

I added fresh garlic, used lean ground turkey and whole wheat pasta as suggested and added some crushed chili flakes for an extra kick

This is okay for a healthy option, but I would change a few things like using fresh garlic instead of garlic powder and I would use fresh tomatoes rather than canned.  I did use spaghetti squash instead of pasta and you couldn't really taste the difference.   I posted a pic with the spaghetti squash.  Other than that it wasn't a bad recipe.  Will most likely make again.

I almost threw the veggies in with the sauce, but cooked them the way the recipe directed. It made a huge difference in their freshness. Instead of sugar in the sauce I put in a couple glugs of good red wine, and some fresh herbs from the garden instead of dry. Pretty versatile to use what fresh veggies you have on hand, black olives were a nice addition. What a great tasting dish this was, we topped with fresh Parmesan cheese.

This a great recipe for gluten free eaters too!!!  I do make some modifications though.  I do all the cooking except the pasta and put all in a crockpot at night, cook pasta in the morning or right before a party, then I add chicken.  Everyone raves.  I also use gluten free corn based pasta.  Excellent

The recipe is great as is. Just for kicks I also added 1/4cup of white wine and some broccoli. Adding the broccoli gave me way too many veggies, so I added only the veggies I wanted to the sauce. I'll find other uses for the  leftover sautéed veggies.

I thought this was a great dish. I added crushed garlic to the diced tomatoes and let the veg cook for about 10 minutes before adding the tomato sauce. Overall very happy!

Good light meal. I used Italian style tomato sauce. Added a little more punch. Would be good also with chicken added.

Didn't find diced tomatoes so I used 5 cans if tomato sauce to substitue--worked fine for me, personally. Other than that, I kept everything the same but the mushrooms, and it turned out delicious. Extremely versatile dish every person should keep around for future meals.

Finally, my search is over. This recipe is full of flavor. I made a batch without the veggies but put in about 1-1/2 tsp. olive oil to make up for what the veggies would have contributed.  For subsequent meals I had the option to add either the veggies and/or meat. This sauce doesn't lose it's punch when reheated. I did add my mom's secret ingredient: 2-4 drops of bitters to cut some of the sweetness. Absolutely fabulous sauce!

I made this recipe for a vegan meal and it was wonderful. I used whole wheat pasta and used 2 small cans of diced tomatoes, one low-sodium and one garlic and herb. I will definitely be making this one again.
