Excellent recipe.  I used RoTel canned tomatoes with cilantro, lime and chilis.  Also added some white wine, simmered to reduce liquid, poured over the fish and baked.  Topped with Mexican cheese at the end of baking time.  Delicious!

I live in Mexico, so I consider myself semi-knowledgeable when it comes to Mexican tastes.  The recipe did not taste very authentic....I've been to Veracruz many times...and the ingredients were there, but the taste was lacking.  Also, the cinnamon was wrong!  Too much and wrong flavor.

Was not impressed with this recipe. I'm not big on a lot of ingredients smothering my fish, however, I thought my family would enjoy it. They didn't care for it either.

I will start this by saying that I love snapper veracruz and order it often out.  Unfortunately I thought the flavor of this was average.  It wasn't bad, but I didn't rave either.  I personally thought the teaspoon of cinnamon was over powering and the most prodominent thing I tasted in the sauce.  If I made this again I would cut way back on the cinnamon.  I may make this again with some changes as it was easy to make.  Thanks Helena.

This is an easy, light and interesting dish - my husband loves it, and even my one-year old enjoyed a little taste.  The sauce is incredible, I could almost eat that by itself!

I actually visited Veracruz a couple of years ago and can confidently say that this tastes like something from that region. It is very good. The olives and capers give it wonderful zing. I reduced the cinnamon to just over half a teaspoon, used diced canned tomatoes, lemon, and yellow bell pepper. Served with a big scoop of white rice and my family ate it up.

I was extremely hesitant about putting in the cinnamon, but I did it anyway. BAD IDEA!  I'll make it again without the cinnamon and re-review.  Please, please, please don't ruin your fish with this recipe.  No cinnamon!  Look at other Veracruz recipes first.  This one is a good basic recipe minus the cinnamon. No cinnamon!  Okay, I think I've gotten my point across.  If you use the cinnamon you can't say you  weren't warned!

Made it with what's on-hand: frozen cod pan fried instead of snapper baked. Oregano instead of cinnamon, based on other reviewers' comments. Added some pickled jalapenos for extra spice. Nice easy dish with rice or roasted potatoes.

I've visited Veracruz and think this recipe is a great start, but definitely cut the cinnamon in half. Also, add a couple tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley, a teaspoon of dried oregano, and a couple of bay leaves. Lastly, make sure to wrap the fish and sauce in a foil tent before cooking in the oven. In Veracruz, they serve it in the foil!

Love this!  My husband doesn't eat cinnamon or onions so I added extra garlic and yellow and red peppers.  Great dinner and really pretty with the multi-colored peppers.  I'm going to try it with chicken, too.
I served it with jasmine rice.
Thanks, Helene for sharing!

Thanks for this recipe. I really enjoyed it. (I'd give it 4.5 if I could) I've never had anything quite like it. I think I'll prepare it often. Although I can be quite happy with not too much done to a fish, this was a tasty change. And easy too!

I really loved this recipe.  I read the reviews and didn't put any cinnamon in it.  After tasting it, I am glad I didn't put it in.  I also used cod, I didn't have access to red snapper.  I had leftover capers from another dish so I did put them in.  It is not a necessary ingredient in that the brininess of the olives was plenty.  Easy dish and I will be making it again.  I saw some reviewers put cheese on, I liked it the way it was, I loved the lightness of it and cheese would have made it a heavier dish.  Serve this with company, they will love it.

Good recipe, however I only used a pinch of cinammon. I have also tried with Rotel and chicken. Works well too.

This was great, my wife loved it and it was very easy to make.  I left out the capers and added some spicy peppers.   We also had some canned "fire-roasted tomatoes with garlic" and that was a nice flavor, roasting anaheim peppers might be good too.  The basic recipe is pretty flexible, so you can adjust the seasonings to your taste.

There are too many flavors in competition here. I would omit nearly half the ingredients and make a simpler dish ... sweet red & green peppers, onions, tomatoes, capers, garlic, Italian parsley; I think that will enhance the flavor of the fish and not bury it.

Love it.  Full of flavour, so healthy, so quick and easy to prepare.  Excellent weeknight meal with some healthful brown rice.  I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned tomatoes, and fresh jalapeno peppers instead of bottled chili peppers.  Does not make it as saucy, but it is still quite juicy and full of fresh flavour from the combination of capers, olives, lime juice and spicy jalapenos.  It is now on my rotating repetoire of evening meals.

Tastes great and is healthy, too! Also great for the South Beach Diet, which I'm on. Made this for my husband, brother and sister-in-law as part of a Mexican dinner. Everyone loved it. The cinnamon is a nice touch.
