I saw many have stated that their "cakes" fell apart during cooking or were difficult to keep together. To correct this, crack an egg in your mixture and mix well before forming into cakes and frying. This will keep them together and will also assure even browning. This is a simple and dish with a wonderful taste. Thank you for posting it.

I thought that this recipe was terrific and needed not too much time to prepare.  I did, however; dip the cakes into egg and roll into bread crumbs.  This helped the cakes stay together because they have a tendency to fall apart when frying.  I served this with a mixture of 1 tb. dijon mustard, 3 tb. mayonaisse. My six year old daughter came back for seconds. Great with a tossed salad.

I liked this much better than the homemade corned beef hash I made recently.  Liked them even better when I made a few additions--a good shake of Cajun seasoning, a couple of cloves of garlic (minced, thrown in toward the end of the onion cooking) and about 2/3 cup corn. With a nice salad, it was a quick and delicious meal.

Good hash, but it needs a little more flavor. I like corned beef hash and I like the idea of making it fresh I also like the idea of making it into cakes. It won't fry into a hard, fast-food hash brown because the mashed potatoes have too much water. Next time I'll use more corned beef, maybe more onion, and maybe some bread crumbs to absorb a little moisture. But still, its a good base.

BE PATIENT!!!!  Go by the recipe, refrigerate for at least half an hour before cooking and don't turn too many times while cooking and these will be perfect.  Enjoy :o)!

I am not sure where to start with this one....the flavor was so ON it's not funny (and I think that has everything to do with how the corned beef is prepared), but these cakes don't stay together.  I added an egg, and would add another next time.  I also added about a teaspoon and a half of dijon mustard and a small palmful of dried chives.  Formed the patties and let them rest for a good hour and they still crumbled in the pan.  Ultimately, I just added liquid and made a hash out of them.  It was delicious, but this recipe needs to call for at least 2 eggs and perhaps something more in order to bind the mixture.  Thanks!

I just made these Corned Beef Hash Cakes with my leftovers from St Paddy's day.  They were great!  I added an egg to the mixture. My husband loved them and I will add them to my recipe box.

These hashcakes are just like the ones my mom used to make! I used leftover corned beef and boiled potatoes from St. Patricks, mashed the potatoes, and followed the recipe. You have to use an egg as a sticking agent, I don't see how it would hold together without. My family ate them all in less than 15 minutes! Great use for leftovers.

O.K. I tried these this morning, and yes they did want to fall apart, however, letting the batch sit for about an hour, and they firm up.There really isn't much flavor to them, added onion powder, and garlic powder, but still kind of tasteless. Put the rest of the batch in the freezer.

My grandmother made an almost identical recipe and formed the mixture into walnut sized balls as opposed to patties. She served them at parties and gatherings along with her homemade cocktail sauce and dips.

This was really tasty, made from tinned corned beef. Did add an egg to the mixture and put in fridge for 30 mins and covered in flour before frying, as mentioned in comments.Will def be making again very soon. Also made too much this time, so half went in freezer.

awesome recipe, just like my mom used to make!
Had a really hard time getting them flipped in the pan even with the added egg, so my genius husband came up with the great idea of using our pannini maker. Worked amazing!! will be making this again for sure.

It will help keep them together if you make them smaller & med-high heat with little oil. Let them get nice & crispy on one side & you should have no problem flipping;) Had these this morning & the hubby loved 'em. Have fun chefin' it up, I did!

My mother made this for years....yes, you need to add an egg as binder; but, there is also three other things to do to keep the ingredients from falling apart...1.  make stiff potatoes, 2. refigerate mixture until thoroughly cold and then 3. lightly flower patty before frying.  Also, mom always made this recipe using canned corned beef.

I made Colcannon and Guinness Corned Beef for St. Pat's day so I made mine with the Colcannon and the Guinness Corned Beef left overs, AMAZING. I did put the patties into flour before frying, it helped then be less sticky.  The dinner was fabulous and the breakfast was just as good!  We may have this more than once a year!

This is a dish we make a lot in Bermuda and we add 1 egg, parsley, thyme, garlic powder. Also dip in flour before frying. Make sure you don't fry the onions in too much oil as it will stop the mixture from keeping together.

What a great way to use up a little corned beef.  I did add an egg as suggested and had no problem with the cakes falling apart.  Otherwise I folled the recipe exactly except I didn't use any salt because I used potatoes cooked in the corned beef broth which was plenty salty.  Will make these again.  TFTR

I make something like this which my family really loves. I use 1 can of corned beef. Instead of mashed potatoes, I bake a couple of potatoes in the microwave and mash it into the corned beef. I add a couple of eggs, green onions, mix well. Form the patties and fry in oil. This recipe does not have the problem of falling apart.

This was ok, I used canned hash instead of the mashed potatoes. Was a little bland. Used mainly the cooking method and the suggestion to add an egg. My FIL has nostalgia for these---his mom used to make them. He wanted me to make some for the super bowl appies. I attempted them! Added a slice of cheese to melt on the top.

This was a great base recipe. After reading some of the reviews and the problems about them falling apart, I added an egg and some panko and for flavor some Lawry's seasoned salt. Also gave the mixture a few pulses in the food processor which helped with the binding, I think. Fried them up in olive oil and my kids wolfed them down. Yum!!

Have been making for years. Mom made these when I was a little kid. We use left over beef roast instead of corned beef. Today I used left over venison roast. I really don't measure since we have been making for years. The difference is that we grind the meat with a meat grinder and we use a egg. It is easier to shred, but I feel you get a more even texture and taste by grinding. If you don't want to mess your hands up by patting, use a measuring cup, put in fry pan and squash with a spatula. I prefer to use olive oil. If you want to freeze, spray a pan with cooking spray, make the patties by using the measuring cup, spatula method. When froze put into freeze bags. It also is a must with me that I use ketchup on top of the patty. I also put ketchup on top of corned beef hash and fried potatoes.

I had the total opposite problem of most reviewers - my mixture was FAR too wet to make patties out of!  I did add the egg AND use instant mashed potatoes and that must be the difference... I wonder how dry other people's potatoes must be that the cakes a) can be formed at all and b) crumble upon cooking.  I added some frozen shredded hash browns to give mine some more bulk, then just glopped it on the griddle like really thick pancake batter.  The egg helped them crisp up on the outside so they still flipped nicely... went over well at my office's weekly team breakfast!

I followed the advise of so many of you. I put and egg to bind. I coated with panko. I place in refrigerator x 1 hour. I did not flip more than once. and for my own spin, I place a sunny side up egg on top. delish!

the common complaint with them holding together was true:  these were too soft to turn. when I make regular potato pancakes from mashed taters I make mine with an egg and  2 TB of flour mixed into the taters to get them to hold together....so treated this the same way....add a little flour and 1 beaten egg to the mix. Personally I also added 1/8 tsp garlic for added flavor...so I liked the basic idea of the hasbbrown CAKE and then doctored it up a little more.

I made this recipe with regular roast beef and it was excellent. Made a double batch and baked the extra for 20 minutes (warmed through). It was very good both ways!!

Cakes fell apart a bit, even using an egg, but still delicious. Used the mayo/mustard combo that another reviewer suggested as a dipping sauce - *very* tasty.

My mom made these too!  She'd sometimes add peas, if they were left over from Sunday dinner.  She didn't try to make them into patties though.  It was simply fried up in one piece in a heavy frying pan. Our serving was the size of the egg-turner.  She'd also sometimes make an indentation to 'fry' an egg on top.

I made these for an Irish potluck and they tasted all right, but not like the corned beef hash that I am used to.  Also, they fell apart so I dipped them in egg and breaded them which helped.  Not my favorite and won't make them again.

I left out the onions.  These cakes are REALLY good.  The smell when they are frying up is amazing, and then when you finally eat it....with these around we didn't need bacon with breakfast.  We did have problems keeping the cakes together, maybe because we fried it in oil and that was not specified in the recipe, but I dont think that was it.  I even tried adding about 2 tbsp of flour to the mixture, but it didn't help out.  But I do recommend adding that flour, because it gives the cake a density that was nice.  I will have to try the suggestion by TheKissingCook next time.  The lady at the deli counter was nice enough to shave the corned beef for us, so that was easy, and we used the entire half pound, hoping to make the cakes stick together more.  We also used butter and herb instant mashed potatoes (took 3 minutes to make in the microwave) - might try cheddar or roasted garlic flavored, next time.  I also like the idea of corn, so I may try that also, next time.  We served this with feta scrambled eggs, and it went very well together.  WE LOVED THESE CAKES!!

Sorry, hit done before I was.... egg binder is wise. The recipe is also easily adaptable for any who want a little more flavor. I use a single average size fresh mushroom and dice it up into small bits and, if available even quite thin strip off a yellow sweet pepper also finely chopped to stir in mixture. Plus a pinch of garlic. It can be served nicely with a bit of chow on the side.

I make my corned beef with golden potatoes.  I diced leftover potatoes and added them instead of mashed. I sauted my onions in olive oil and added Adobo and an egg to the mixture.  My Irishman loved them.

I made corned beef rissoles using 'dry' mashed potato, no milk or butter added, corned beef, sping onion, mixed herbs, garlic, and mild red chilli. I whisked an egg and put half into the mixture to bind it. Then shaped cakes using flour on my hands and a board. Then Refrigderate for an hour to firm the cakes. Then heat a little oil in a hot heavy bottomed pan. Cook for at least 6 mins until very very slightly burnt then turn and cook other side for 6 minutes. I serve the cakes with coconut rice and beans (gungo). Delicious. Leftover cakes are really tasty in a sandwich. Corned beef rissoles/ cakes are one of my favourite comfort dishes too.

unsure what happened here, they fell apart, and we're too loose. I may try the panini press, as suggested, as the flavor was fine, other than they were soaked in grease. Maybe my grease wasn't hot enough to make sure yours is.

I have tried making corned beef hash several and was never satisfied. I just couldn't seem to get enough flavor. I think using mashed potatoes helps the flavor to permeate throughout. To save time, I used instant mashed potatoes and made them a little dry. I only made two small patties just to try them, and I didn't have too much trouble holding them together. I put the rest of the mixture in the refrigerator to have for breakfast, and I think I will try adding an egg. I believe leaving them overnight will enhance the flavor. Can't wait to try them in the morning with a fried egg on top !

This was FANTASTIC and just what I was looking for. I actually did not want cakes, but wanted corned beef hash. My husband loves the canned hash for breakfast with his eggs. Too me it smells worse than can dog food. I gave this a whirl this morning with my left over corned beef. He went to work a happy man.
