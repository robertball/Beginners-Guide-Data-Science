This was a wonderful recipe.  I was looking for  one using kale as I know how healthful it is, but was afraid to cook with it.  I used hot turkey sausage and really enjoyed it.  And...I felt good after eating it!

I used more linguica (Portuguese sausage)than called for (about a pound)and about 12 ounces linguine. Linguica is uncooked sausage (kielbasa is usually already cooked) and I think you need to cook it longer than 2-3 minutes. I also found that kale takes a little longer than 1-2 minutes to wilt.This was very good- my family rated it a keeper.
