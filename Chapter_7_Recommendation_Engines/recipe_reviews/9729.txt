Maybe I left it in the fridge too long but I could not get this dough to roll out into a rope. It would break and crumble. I let the dough sit out for a few hours and tried again and same thing. I did leave it in the fridge overnight but I have never had a problem with doing that with other similar recipes. I ended up throwing the dough away because I couldn't do anything with half green/half regular dough that wouldn't roll out.
