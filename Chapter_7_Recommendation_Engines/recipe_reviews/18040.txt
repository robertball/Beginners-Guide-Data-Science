I added two tablespoons of sugar, otherwise they were great. Since I had the oil already hot, I made apple fritters with the same mixture and replacing the corn and adding the tablespoons of sugar.

These were great! I let the batter sit for a half hour on the counter. Fritters came out perfect. I followed the 1/4 cup sugar and honey topping recommendations. Deep fried in small batches. A throwback to my youth. YUM! Many thanks!!!

This recipe is really good with crab meat and parmesan instead of corn.  Just like fritters at a cajun joint I like to hang at.

I had something called "corn dippers" once at Burger King and really, really loved it.  Unfortunately it was a special promotional offer and was soon discontinued.  For years I dreamt of these corn dipper things and even contemplated writing to Burger King to ask for the recipe.  Well finally I found this recipe for corn fritters and tried it.  I was a bit nervous as I had never deep-fried before (but I just filled a small frying pan with about 1 cm of oil and did it that way).  Both my boyfriend and I agree that these corn fritters are better than the ones we had at Burger King.  I'm so, so happy that I found this recipe.  Thanks, Joan!

Very good served with real maple syrup.  I think next time I will cut back a little on the amount of corn, but that is just my personal preferance.

Mine did not come out very well. I was expecting them to be sweeter.  Next time I will probably use less corn and more sweeteners or go in the opposite direction and add spices and jalepeno peppers.

Delicious and very easy. I always serve with fried fish, great side for that. I sometimes don't have any eggs, and a few times I used an easy replacement (2 Tbsp. water + 1 Tbsp. oil + 2 tsp. baking powder) and the fritters came out exactly the same as they do when I use an egg.

Did everything except the can of corn... instead I added 4 oz cooked chopped broccoli, 1/4 cup diced onion, 1/4 cup crumbled cooked bacon, 1/4 cup shredded cheddar and 1 tsp garlic powder, voila broccoli fritter. Yummmy.

I tried these twice.  First time as is, they were good.  Four stars.  Second time round, I added some bells and whistles.  I added a quarter cup of corn meal, half a cup of crabmeat, 2 tbsp. sugar and  seasoning salt.  Other alterations include using two-thirds cup buttermilk and fresh corn kernels.  OMG..those were the bee's knees.  With the changes, they're a 5.

These were great!  I came across this recipe looking for a way to use up my fresh corn for a light supper.  I think the 1/4 tespoon sugar may be a typo.  I used 1/4 cup sugar and subbed fresh corn cut from two ears.  Pan fried in a little oil and topped with a little butter and honey.  Paired this with sliced tomatoes with fresh mozz and basil.  Perfect!

This recipe is exactly the same as an old recipe my great grandmother had.  We have been eating these since I was a just little.  We always use left over corn cut off the cob, it gives the fritters a great taste and we dip them in warm syrup...mm delish.  Our recipe calls for 1/4 c sugar, 2 eggs and no milk.  We sprinkle with a little powdered sugar also.  Makes a great dessert with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

These were GREAT!! They were not as sweet as one expects corn fritters to be, but I paired them with a sweet sauce over some pork chops and they were exactly right. Will make again and again!!

I love this recipe. I usually double it though and instead of adding the shortening I use melted butter and 1 14 oz can of creamed corn instead of the regular corn. Instead of doubling the amount of milk i used what the recipe called for and added about 1/4 cup more so total i used 3/4 cup of milk. I also add 1 tsp of vanilla extract.

This recipe is great. The first time we followed it exact and they were good although you have to eat them as soon as they are done or they are soggy later on... This time we didn't use an egg and we used cream corn and they were REALLY good. Sweet the inside was so moist a creamy just like in the restaurant!

This past weekend was maple weekend here in NY!  Made me in the mood for fritters....these were even better than the samples we had at the maple farms!  The only thing I did differently was to use a 12 oz. bag of corn you steam in the microwave.  I also added a splash of vanilla and a 1/4 cup of sugar to the batter.  Great served with warm syrup!

I really loved this recipe.  I made two batches for my birthday barbecue yesterday.  One batch I just doubled the sugar as others suggested, and used chopped apples that I canned two years ago.  The apple fritters went over a hit!

My second batch I wanted to best of both worlds - hush puppies and corn fritters - so I used a 50/50 blend of cornmeal and flour.  I used slightly less than half a cup of cornmeal to half cup of flour, because my research says that 3/4cup of cornmeal substitutes for one cup of flour in recipes, so I eyeballed it.  I just used frozen corn, thawed and drained, and the results were a huge success.  

Can't wait to try a variation with cornmeal, parm, and crab meat!

Good basic recipe!  I added my own seasonings to make them a little more flavorful.  It was very easy to experiment since I made them in small batches.  They were awesome by the end!  I added some more sugar, garlic and onion powder and jalepenos.  The jalepenos really made the difference!

Oh my!  Baked these in a pancake puff pan on the stove and served with real maple syrup.  As they bake, add a bit more butter when they get dry.  Don't want to lose this recipe!  We use it every time the kids come in as they love corn cakes. UPDATE: Works just as well in my new brownie maker. Takes less time and attention to bake, and also less fat. I just use about 1/4 teaspoon butter per hole, and put that in while the maker is preheating. This time, I tried adding about a tablespoon of real maple syrup to the batter instead of the sugar, and I liked that better. Done this way, it makes a nice side dish for ham or pork.

Very good recipe - be careful to watch both the size of your spoonfuls and the temp of your oil or you will get raw dough in the middle.  Could've used a little more salt in the dough though.  Tried it sprinkled with powdered sugar and also with a little garlic salt and both were very good.

Reminds me of a recipe my mom makes except better.  For the Vegetarians, I made as it but added finely chopped jalapenos.  For the meat people, I added the finely chopped jalapenos and chopped cooked applewood smoked bacon.  I served them hot with a chipotle BBQ cream sauce.  I quadrupled the recipe for a dinner party appetizer for 15 people.  We did not have many leftovers.

My mom passed away in March.  My dad has been bugging me to make corn fritters, but I told him that mom kept the recipe in her head.  We loved them & missed them.  I decided to try Allrecipes & found the greatest fritters ever.  Sorry, Mom, but they are just a little bit better than yours.  Thanks, Joan

These are great and so versatile! A little syrup or powdered sugar makes a nice breakfast or you can jazz it up if you want with cheese or spices for a great side dish. Yum!

made just as recipe stated. and brought them to a chili cook off as a side dish.Can I say they were gone in just minutes.... they were loved by all, and many said it brought back memories of when their moms used to make them when they were a child.I doubled the batch and that still was not enough.

As I'm from the UK I've never tasted these little beauties before. 
I'd watched a cookery programme,where an American lady spoke highly of these, so I thought I'd give them a go.
Anyway, the recipe was very easy to follow & the only thing I did was to add less salt & sugar (in the UK we try & use salt as little as possible in recipes)
I fried them in Crisp & Dry & they turned out wonderful.
My husband & daughter were a little apprehensive to try them but my daughter dived in with a BBQ dip & said they'd grow on her, my husband said he'd like some peppers mixed in with the corn.
So, these get a thumbs up from the UK & we'll probably have them again maybe with some chicken?
Could you please tell me what I should serve these with?

I thought these were pretty good. Mine came out nice and fluffy and light. My only issue is that they're kinda bland. Neither particularly sweet or savory. Easy enough to tweak, though. Thanks. :o)

I tried half the batter with corn and half with apples.  I dipped the apple ones in powdered sugar.  They were both so good! I'm going to try blueberry next...

GREAT stuff! So fast to prepare and cook. Froze fresh corn this past summer,  had a craving for it, pulled a zip lock bag of it and whipped up these fritters! Going to make them tonight, but with apple (apple fritters). Cooked in canola oil in a 10-inch pan, did not need to deep fry it for them to be golden and fluffy and DELICIOUS! Yummo!
Update: The apple fritters made with substituting the corn with apple are our my husbands favorite, making them large allows one to eat a nice sized snack all at once rather than having to keep running back into the kitchen. They are a favorite once in awhile treat when you want something different and yummy as can be :-)

My husband grew up eating corn fritters with syrup for breakfast.  So I made these and he really liked them.  I did half, just as the recipe said, and half with cheese.  I really liked the cheese, but I think it is better without if you want to eat them with syrup.  The recipe was very easy.  These aren't great as left overs, so only make what you need.  Also, make sure to leave them in the oil long enough.  I had a few that were not quite cooked in the middle.
I will definitely be using this recipe again! Thanks Joan!

3.5 STARS.
I've been looking for a decent recipe for this for a lil bit; all the rest looked sketchy and seemed like a waste, then I came across this one. Mine didn't come all looking like the picture though; as little nuggets, mine came out more like patties which I figured they would anyway. I have been using allrecipes.com for a couple yrs now for recipes and they seem to be a trustworthy site so I decided to give these a go. 
I went with the recipe and at first only added 1/4 of a tsp of sugar which IS WAYY TOO LITTLE, at least for me anyway. I'm glad I took my own advice tried the first batch and realized how bitter they were with only the 1/4 tsp of the sugar and used my judgment and added about 3 tbsps which honestly did these justice! Not too sweet but made them taste more edible & like how they would if you bought them from a restaurant! I also used creamed corn for that added umfph !
Overall not bad.

This was a really good base recipe.  I made one batch with with extra sugar and cinnamon and the other with red pepper flakes and a bit more salt.  As other suggested, we dipped them in maple syrup.

My husband LOVED these! He said they tasted just like fritters from Brown's Chicken in Naperville, IL. I dusted them with powered sugar after pulling them out of the fryer. Very Good :)

Yummy.  Only thing I did differently is added 1 TBS sugar.  Although can't have these frequently for health reasons but it sure was delicious.

Quick, easy and the family loved it! I made it gluten free with 1 tsp xantham gum, 1/2 cup GF baking mix and 1/2 cup corn flour.  I omitted the melted shortening and increased the sugar to two tablespoons.  Delicious!

So good and so easy.  Just make sure you cook them all the way through, without over-cooking the outside.  I have made then with soups, salads and chowder (adding some parmesan cheese for great flavor) or for breakfast with syrup for dipping.

I made two batches one sweet and one savory. My FIL ate more of the sweet, but I prefered the savory. For the sweet i followed others advice and used 1/4 cup sugar and served with honey. For savory i added garlic and onion powder and some dried jalopeno from our garden. VERY IMPORTANT is the temp of the oil. What is listed in the recipe did not work for me. I ended up needing a lower temp or mine overcooked in seconds. I would do one at a time until you get the temp right otherwise you could easily ruin a whole batch.

These were great and easy. I think that frozen corn made it easier to hold together to fry.  Adding 2-4 TBSP of sugar helped make them sweeter. I also took butter and mixed it with honey and served it with them as a dipping sauce.

I was able to make these from scratch to finish in only 20 minutes...they cooked really fast...maybe my oil was too hot?  I cut corn off the cob that was leftover from grilling out tonight...about 3 cobs...and the fritters were delicious. Great way to use up corn!  I did add 2 Tblsp butter due to no shortening and 2T of honey due to no sugar.

Quick, Easy, Great! I made the recipe and realized I had no corn.  I used a can of diced tomatoes that were already flavored with oregano, cilantro, and garlic. They were AWESOME. I will be making them next time with spaghetti instead of garlic bread. Great accidental discovery. FYI: I don't have a deep-fryer and had no idea what temp the oil was. I use gas and it was at about 80% flame, if that helps.

I thought these were pretty good.  Used leftover sauteed frozen corn so it had a bit more seasoning than the recipe called for.  Added quite a bit more sugar, as I was looking for a sweeter fritter and the corn I have is not so sweet.  Ended up adding 1 T of sugar to the batter.  My husband didn't care for these, but he doesn't like most things with corn.  Better served while they're hot, as they feel greasy at room temp.

Something was missing from this recipe. It was very good but something is off. I used butter in place of the shortening and sprinkled seasoned salt on them after frying. Will try again...

My only change would be to add more sugar to the dry mix. I'd prefer it a bit sweeter. Would also consider dusting it with confectioner's.

Great recipe, I make this often for my hubby and son but i made a few small changes. I use 1/4 cup corn meal and 3/4 cup flour. If I'm in a sweet mood i use 2 tablespoons sugar. or savory, i stick with the regular amount of sugar and add cooked chopped bacon.

Oh My Gosh. These are fantastic. I used self rising flour and skipped the salt and baking powder. I used a package of corn I had frozen last fall. The package contained precooked corn, hot and sweet peppers and onions chopped fine. I thawed the corn in the microwave and drained in a sieve. I made them smallish and got 28. Calculated to be 57 calories each.

I expected this recipe to be fantastic but I was a little dissapointed.  It definantly needs more flavor, it was to bland for me.  It tasted better when I dipped them into sour cream, and I did add cheddar to the batter.  Next time I will add more cheese and spices.

I made these with And without the corn. I added a little extra sugar to the without corn ones. You can also sprinkle them with a little sugar for a sweeter treat. These are light and tasty and just hit the spot. I will be making them often.

My experiment FAILED :( I would imagine it is because I did not use milk---my weekly supply ran out...

That being said, they tasted pretty ok'ish---I ate them all.

So yummy!!! The words of my children.  I would have given them 5 stars however, I read through the comments and took some of the advice to use 1/4 cup of stugar and a little more salt than it stated.  This made them perfect!  If I had stuck to the original amounts I know we wouldn't have like them as well.  I did use frozen corn because that's all I had.  I didn't warm it and drain it any just stuck in frozen, mixed, added a touch more flour and then started frying.  They were perfect. Fluffy and tender on the inside while being golden and crunchy on the outside. Next time I think I will lower the temp on the oil they did get a little too brown.  This basic recipe I think could be so versatile from spices and veggies you add to make it savory, to adding fruit and more sugar for a delicious fried sweet.

made just a couple changes based on what I had.  Increased the sugar to a teaspoon as suggested.  used creamed corn plus a couple left over cooked ears of corn (cut off the corn) omitted the milk and oil due to cream in corn.

The 1/4 teaspoon of sugar called for by this recipe must be a typo!  Surely it's supposed to be 1/4 cup sugar, since corn fritters are usually kind of sweet.  I will probably try this recipe but will definitely use 1/4 cup sugar, as another reviewer suggested.

These were very good and easy!  I used my own frozen corn instead of canned so I had to guess how much to add to the flour mixture.  It must have been close because I ended up with 13 fritters.  I also used my cookie scoop to measure the dough and add it to the oil.  My own personal preference would be for them to be sweeter but that is just me.  I'm glad I tried this!

These are excellent! I've been using this recipe for quite some time now as a base, replacing the corn with apples, asparagus, YOU NAME IT!

The best variation I used peanut butter reese's puff cereal in the batter instead of corn. After frying, I rolled them in powdered sugar. Then glazed them in melted chocolate chips/butter icing, and then squeezed a dollop of peanut butter on top of that. YUM.

These are delicious! I used sweet frozen corn instead of canned and they turned out great. I also added about a teaspoon of cinnamon and extra corn for more sweetness. I followed one of the reviews and also added 2 tablespoons of sugar. Overall, these are great and worth a try! I gave some batter to a friend of mine who loved them. Thanks for the recipe!

I was craving corn fritters that were served in a restaurant in Alaska.  So I decided to make some myself, along with a side of honey butter to dip them into.  They were excellent.  I think next time I'll add more sugar to the fritter dough just because I would like the fritters themselves sweeter, but they were excellent just as the recipe calls for.

These were FANTASTIC!  I like my corn fritters a little on the sweeter side, so based on other reviews I added one tablespoon extra to the batter.  Thanks for posting such a great recipie!

The only reason I didn't give this one 5 is because like other reviewers, I added extra sugar.  I made a test fritter as the recipe was written and it was just a little bland for me.  But the addition of a couple extra tablespoons of sugar remedied that.  I like how it is a really good starter batter, I could sub almost anything for the corn: Squash, zucchini, even add some cinnamon and apples for a good dessert!  It's different from the ones I've had at restaurants in that it's flour based rather than corn bread based and I like that.

I've never made or even seen a corn fritter so I had no idea what to expect. These don't have much flavor by themselves(& I had upped the sugar to 1 tsp), however, dip them in maple syrup & HOLY COW!! Soooo delicious! My youngest ate 4 of them!!

Delicious. Everyone loved these. We ate some plain and put powdered sugar on the rest. I only did one thing different. After I cooked FROZEN corn I processed it in the blender for a few minutes to make it almost a puree with a few kernels. Perfect.

What a great recipe! I had never made these before nor eaten one either so really didn't know what to expect. This was a nice light fried biscuit with corn throughout. Much like a hush puppy but not as heavy and not with corn flour or cornmeal. I thought it was going to be like a corn nugget but this was more bready and far far better. I used frozen corn, unthawed, instead of canned, and it worked out great! Thanks, these were a great side with our southern fried meal.

Really great basic recipe. I molded it to fit my needs - had a bunch of leftover homemade creamed corn with roasted red peppers and used this instead of the can of corn and just reduced the milk. They came out great! Nice and fluffy, not too dense and with plenty of corn!

A wonderful topping...canned cherry pie filling. I know you're thinking "ugh" but it's very delicious. I also use creamed corn for 1/2 of the corn.

I doubled the amount of sugar since everyone was saying these weren't sweet enough. The taste of these turned out SO good...but alot of them were cooked on the outside but still doughy in the middle and we had to throw them away. We ended up making 3 batches of these, trying to get them to turn out right all of the time. I also tried frying these like you would a pancake...I tried frying some in oil and some in margarine...we didn't like the taste when they were pan fried...they weren't as sweet for some reason. I feel like I overall I didn't have much luck with this recipe, sorry.

Great!!! I just made them for the kids for an after school snack and we all loved them.  Even one of my sons that does not like corn enjoyed them,they said it taste like funnel cakes.  My husband loved them also. 
Thank you so much I will definately be making these again and again.
Only thing I did different was use 1/4 cup of sugar.

This is very similar to a recipe my mom made when I was young. The only difference was instead of 1/2 cup of milk and kernel corn she used 1 can of cream corn.

As other reviewers noted, I increased the salt to 1 tsp and increased the sugar to 4 tbsp, and probably put in a lot more corn than 12 ozs..I see the batter as simply a delivery system for that good sweet corn.  And I didn't deep fry them, I pan fried them in about 1/8" oil in a ten inch cast iron skillet, flattened them out and flipping them over...makes an easy recipe even easier!  They were still wonderful! The only thing is I did warm the corn up before I put them in the batter...I left the corn frozen last time I did this recipe (also pan-fried them) and they were a little underdone in the middle.   These are not messy to make, and pan fying them is especially good for cast iron.  Just one bowl and a few utensile to wash, and just wipe out the skillet...done!

These were great.  If you want desert, do like others and put a bunch of sugar in them on them and around them, but if you want a delicious side dish for some good southern cooking, these are the bomb.  For breakfast, add more flour and baking powder, sugar and vanilla.  Make flat patties and fry them in a pan.  Syrup 'em up and enjoy.

Excellent.  Had these down south at a chain restraunt and was looking for a recipe to be able to have them again.  They taste pretty much the same with the use of 1/4 cup sugar added like other reviewers did.  Thanks for this!  It's been a few years since I've been able to enjoy these and now I can make them myself.  Thanks again!

My family has already made this recipe 3 times and we love it! The first time I followed it exactly. Second time added more corn and 2T sugar. Third time I added 15oz can of corn and accidentally thought it was 1/4 cup of sugar and I remembered from last time add a little more...whoops but it was actually really good with a little over 1/4cup of sugar...oh and I didn't have any milk so I used a little less then 1/2 cup of milk and it was still great! We use chipotle ranch salad dressing as a dipping sauce.

They're so..... DRY! The ones I've had in a restaurant had some sort of.... liquid inside of them but it was good. Maybe don't drain the corn? I'm tasting no flavor at all, somewhat styrofoam sensation if you get what I mean, ahah.

Very good recipe. 
Like many others, I have my own preferences, but the changes I made were few: I used Bisquick, only because it's my go-to for pancakes, drop biscuits and things like fritters and potato pancakes. I also doubled the amount (2 c rather than 1). I added 2 tsp sugar, 2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/8 tsp garlic powder and I minced half a red jalapeno into it. Cooked til golden brown and served with ranch dressing. I think next time I'll give something like sweet chili sauce a try for a dip, and increase the jalapeno.

A fantastic restaurant in my hometown makes these and they are just as delicious! However, you MUST increase the sugar (or Truvia), I doubled it and will quadruple next time. I rolled them in a bit of Truvia right after taking them out of the oil. I used canola oil with DHA added and butter instead of shortening. The 12 fritters as stated are too big they won't cook all the way through. Try making 24 smaller ones.

These were so good!  Served with a chicken vegetable chowder.

Fried in Canola oil, with the windows open on an early fall day, and my house smelled like a state fair!  I did increase the sugar to 1/4 c, and the salt  as well.  I used frozen corn, so that may account for needing more salt.  I also added 1/4 c corn meal because I was craving something hush-puppy ish, so that required a little more milk to get the right consistency.  Next time I would like to try these with some cayenne pepeper or jalapeno peppers in the mix.  A big hit with our family!

Tasted like carnival food to me.  Yum!  They were light and fluffy.  I was surprised how they puff up once in the oil.  I did them in a deep skillet.  I did add more sugar, I think about 3 T.  It was perfect.  I tried them sprinkled with a little sugar once done and they were even more tasty.  Will make again I'm sure.

while the texture was ok, not special, my only problem was how bland they were. Think I will either add more sugar or some maple extract..something anyway. Entire family felt the same. The powder sugar helped make them edible but just not all that yummy. This is my very first ever negative comment so was surprised. I follow recipes relgiously first time I use them, but I did think amount of sugar was small when I read it but didnt change it.

These corn fritters were sooo good, I made them for 3rd night of Hanukkah. I used 1 tsp. of sugar instead of 1/4 tsp, this only change I made and they were great! I served them with some Plain Greek Yogurt and a drizzle of honey on top with a nice mound o applesauce on the side-DELISH!

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. The only changes I made were to increase the sugar to 1 Tablespoon, and the can of corn I had was only 7 ounce, but we felt that was enough. 
Delicious plain, or dipped in warmed honey. Yum!

This was a very simple throw together recipe. Great for a last minute appetizer or side. I will say that it does need some flavor. Next time I might add more sugar or some spices. My kids even liked them though.

Very easy to throw together. I thought they were a little bland; they just needed "something." Maybe I'll add more salt or seasoning next time. I'll try them again - just modify the recipe a little.

i did two batches of these today i used VERY fresh corn from the cob the first batch i made as is which turned out so tasty and the next batch i made i added cheddar cheese, more salt and some Cayenne pepper and WOW we really liked it alot. I could see this as being a breakfast or sweet item but i wanted to try to make it a little more savory to serve as a side dish or appetizer

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I also let the batter sit for a half an hour before frying.  I substituted the egg for 1/4 cup applesauce *I have a couple of children allergic to eggs* and also added 2 TBL of sugar instead.  They tasted amazing and were a great hit!

was okay, not as good as I had expected. I like things with a little more flavor. Also, you must be careful not to accidentally drop any corn kernals into the pan, or else once the hot oil will make them pop up at you like pop corn. They didn't taste bad, and the batter held up very well, but I would like to see them mixed with some other ingredients, maybe onions or cheese or something for some pisazz

Very good.  Mine turned out crispy and done all the way through.  No doughy center like some said, maybe because I made them small and cooked them really well done.  I cooked them in my little fry daddy and they turned out just great.  But one batch makes an awful lot of little fritters.

Loved these b/c they are not too sweet like the ones you buy in the grocery.  My son does not like the super sweet ones.  
I will however, ADD MORE CORN next time... there just wasn't enough in each fritter.  
This was wonderful!! My family loved these!!! Thank you, Joan!

Perfect!
If you haven't tried making these, 
I suggest you run (don't walk) to your kitchen
and get started.
This recipe is absolutely perfect as is,
don't change a thing!
(Try em' with ketchup!)

A traditional PA Dutch recipe that I, being a Miller decendant grew up on.  Served hot with butter and maple syrup with a side of sausage or scrapple and they're the perfect breakfast, brunch or supper.  If you're eating them with syrup you can omit the sugar in the recipe.  Enjoy!

I have been looking for a good corn fritter recipe for years. I have always been horribly disappointed...until now! I loved this recipe, and plan to make it again very soon. For the most part, I followed the recipe. The only change I made was using frozen corn instead of canned, and a little less than the recipe calls for. I agree with other reviewers who said to cut back a little on the amount of corn in it and to add more sugar if you've got a sweet tooth. I think this recipe would work well with any fruit or veggie I decide to add. Very happy with this and I look forward to having it again!

Made these for a party yesterday, I tripled the recipe.  I added the 2 tbsp of sugar and used butter instead of shortening.  They turned out great!  Every single one got eaten and I got rave reviews from the party goers.

These were fantastic.  I did not change one thing.  They were perfect just by following the recipe.  My grown children like me to make them for them when they come to visit.  I always have all the ingredients on hand.  Sometimes I make them just for snacking. 
Thank you for sharing.  It is one of our favorites.

This is a great recipe.  I used 3/4 cup sifted flour and 1/4 cup corn meal and added onion and garlic powder, a little extra sugar.  I used the salt as they were coming out of the oil. Yum!

Great recipe!  I used frozen corn from my garden and it was excellent.  I did not fry in oil though, I used  bit of cooking spray and cooked them like a pancake. A bit healthier.  I also used egg substitute and skim milk to cut back the cholesterol.  It is a snowy day here as we had 36 inches of snow so we spent the day cooking.

I was hoping for more of a hushpuppy flavor, which is probably why I was disappointed. These aren't bad, but they have no sweetness to them. Maybe creamed corn would have tasted better.

This is a really good corn fritter recipe. I did make two small changes. When I made the first batch, I followed the recipe exactly. They turned out pretty good. To the second batch, I added two Tbsp. of Splenda (I don't use sugar) and I doubled the salt. They turned out really good. Just make sure to take them out of the oil when they turn golden brown. If you don't, they taste like burnt flour and grease. Thanks!

Delicious! I made some tonight with corn I canned a few months ago and had with chili, they were great! I chose to pan fry instead of deep frying just because I didn't want to use all my oil. Also added some garlic powder to give it some extra flavor. We ended up putting some homemade green salsa and sour cream on top and couldn't get enough of them! Also very delicious by themselves, great basic recipe that you can use to put your own touches, next time I may try adding some cumin and cayenne since I enjoy things more savory than sweet. Also used 1 tbsp of honey in place of sugar, my personal taste.

Very good.  These complimented the Chicken Hurry recipe (from allrecipes.com) quite nicely.  I didn't think they were at all labor intensive.  The cook pretty quickly.  I'll make these again...was considering splitting the flour and use half cornmeal and half flour...I'll try that one of these days when I'm looking a kitchen adventure..lol  I'd also like to try it with cinnamon and shredded apples...very good easy recipe, will make it again!

I just made these with my 10 year old daughter and we love them!  Very simple, yet very tasty!  I can't wait to try them with diced apples in them.  I will probably add a bit of cinnamon when I do apples.

We had these tonight for dinner along with freshly picked Jersey tomatoes from our garden and pork chops cooked on the grill. I used butter for the shortening followed the directions to a "T".  They were insanely delicious. Thanks for sharing Joan.

These were really good.  There is a popular seafood restaurant here in Orland that gives you corn fritters as an appetizer, these are very close in flavor.  The restaurant sprinkles powdered sugar on theirs...as soon as I did that this recipe just about perfect.  I followed everything exact except my can of corn was 15 oz. it seemed to work fine though.  Thanks!

I loved these, but surprisingly the kids didn't really take to them. Too unfamiliar I suppose. I'd assumed they'd devour them. I took some to my neighbors to try and they devoured them, asked for the recipe right away and made a batch for themselves that very night. I used about 1 1/2 T of sugar and since I can only buy corn in 15 oz cans, I just used that whole amount. Also, I don't have shortening, so just used margarine and it worked out great. Dusted them with powdered sugar afterwards. I kept trying in vain to get them to be rounder. Tips anyone?

I get recipes from here to make for dinner with my children (there's three of them and myself), so we're always trying to find something yummy yet fun and different than our usual meals. I've never made corn fritters before - these were SO fun for my daughter and I to make and they turned out wonderful! All crispy on the outside and soft inside, not greasy at all, with a lovely sweetness - not too much yet it was there. We used the 1/4 cup sugar another person suggested, thinking the extra bit of sweetness would go over well around here lol. We served them on a big plate for all the kids with bacon slices, fruit with a choice of honey, syrup or ketchup to dip and they looked like they were racing each other to see who could gobble up the most! Thanks so much for such a fun and delicious recipe! We'll definitely be making these often :)

Yummy! The whole household loved these - a minor alteration I made was to use half flour and half corn meal for more of a "hush puppy" result. We dipped them in a sweet & spicy, asian-style, store bought sauce. Next time I plan on throwing in some chopped jalapenos!

This recipe was wonderful. My daughter came home from her friends and I ask her to come and try one and she took one bite and than she said is that all you made..Than she said great job on the fritters. I used smart balance and not shorting and a tablespoon of sugar.

These definitely were popular! However, they could have done without the sugar. And I tweaked it a little bit using half cream corn and half kernel corn. Nonetheless, they turned out pretty good.

Made these for my sisters birthday and they were a big hit. I filled my skillet with around 3/4 of an inch of oil to pan fry them so they were flat disks, but this didn't bother anyone at all. Make sure you add 1/4 cup of sugar and serve with maple syrup.

I've never had the pleasure of eating these before. My first thought was that they tasted like Krispy Kreme's   dipped in maple syrup. I did increase the sugar to 1/4 cup as so many other reviewers  recommended. My husband absolutely went crazy over these, though... and proceeded to try dipping them into everything from Bill's Seasoned Ketchup to Worcertershire sauce.I will be making these again for hi... as I recall, the recipe only yielded about 10 ~ 11 for us. Not enough for me to steal but 2 of them!
I think I will also try them with a bit more corn next time, as the flavor kind of got lost somewhere in the mix. Thanks for the post!

Defintely needed at least 1/4 cup of sugar. I will add more next time as I like my corn fritters sweeter. These are extra yummy drizzled with honey!

The fritters fried up nice and crispy.  While they were good plain, we thought some pancake syrup enhanced them.  We used leftover corn that we'd cut off the cob and sauteed with butter, salt and pepper the night before.

Not bad overall. It did remind me of funnel cake with corn in it. It would make a nice base for little fried doughnuts it you leave out the corn. I followed other reviewers advice and used 1/4 cup sugar.

They were great.  We didn't have an egg so we added a little extra milk and they still turned out wonderful.  They were so good that we had to make seconds.

This is a quick recipe which everyone liked, but since you have to deep fry them, they are not very kid friendly at all.

I made it for the first time today, two batches, both times using 2 Tbsp of sugar and roasted corn kernels that I froze from when corn was selling 6/$1. Brought it to a party and everybody loved them! Looking forward to making them again. Thank you for this recipe.

This recipe was so easy quick and made delicious fritters. Brings me back to my childhood. I read a comment where they added a tablespoon of sugar. I did the same. Didn’t make them too sweet but the original recipe would have been perfect as well. I added honey for dipping. I preferred no honey ( thought it was too sweet with the honey) . Some of my kids preferred them with the honey. Thanks for sharing this fun delicious recipe.

Delicious!  Made a double batch, and they're getting gobbled up before I put the next bunch in the fryer I used Trader Joe's gluten free all purpose flour and butter (because I had no shortening).  Sprinkled powdered sugar, yum!  We are definitely making these again!

Every Sunday we have breakfast for dinner. My oldest daughter, who is usually the one to make pancakes, wanted to try something different. I found this recipe and, remembering corn fritters from my childhood, knew it would be a hit. I was not wrong! For my family of seven, I doubled the recipe and added vanilla. My husband and I are off sugar, so instead I used Stevia and a touch of maple syrup, which made the batter a bit runny, so I  added cornmeal until it looked right. I will certainly be making this again... Probably next Sunday!

I shallow fry these like pancakes and they work fine that way. Really good!  I really don't change the recipe at all except to add some garlic (I put garlic in everything). I love making these!

My family and I absolutely loved them!!! I altered the recipe a tiny bit by multiplying it by 4 to make a big batch. I also used an extra tablespoon of baking powder to make them nice n fluffy inside. Very easy to make 20 mins. Prep time and 30 mins cooking time. I will definitely be making these again in the near future.

It was delicious. I added jalapeño cream cheese, lime, parsley and green pepper hot sauce then baked it in a cast iron pan on  400° . It came out really flavorful and we loved it. Also, I used ritz crackers instead of flour.

Just like my mom used to make, not too sweet and served hot with maple syrup-perfect. My only suggestion, drop by teaspoon, not tablespoon. They come out too big and I had trouble getting them cooked all the way through. Otherwise wouldn't change a ting.

These didn't turn out as good as I was hoping but not bad either. My biggest complaint is the grease. These came out VERY greasy. Some of it may have been my fault because I used cream style corn. I'll give these another try with regular corn.

Made as directed in the recipe. Family liked them. Not as sweet as expected/desired. Will be adding more sugar next time. Would do well with a dusting of confectioner's sugar.

Followed the recipe exactly and it worked out perfectly.  The key is to have the oil nice and hot so that the fritters don't absorb to much oil. If you crowd too many in the pan you will also lower the heat of the oil and end up with more oil being absorbed.

I've been making this recipe for 2 years now and they turn out perfectly every time!  I had tried increasing the sugar but they just turned out too brown, and there's no reason to increase the sugar if you're rolling them in powdered sugar. I've also used corn from cobs instead of canned, works fine.  A hit every time!

These were so delicious!  I had some leftover corn from last night's dinner, and hated to throw it away.  So I went on this site and found this recipe.  The only change I made was adding a little extra sugar as per another reviewer's suggestion.  I can't wait to try these using apples and cinnamon.  Thanks for a great recipe!

For dinner last night, served two people.  Came out just like the picture. Nice with maple syrup.  There were just two left, and I lightly buttered them.  Very nice. When I make corn fritters again, I'll increase the sugar to at least 2 teaspoons.  But if I make clam fritters, I'll make as the recipe calls for.

Definitely needs a lot more sugar, 1/4 or 1/3 cup even. I used creamed corn because that's what I had, and it worked out well.

Worked great. I recommend melting the shortening with the milk then tempering in the egg before adding to the dry. Mixture was perfect and held its form nicely. I would have preferred a sweeter fritter. Next time I will add a couple tsp. of sugar.

These were really good, however IF you like your fritters to be sweet, 1/4 teaspoon sugar is NOT hardly enough. I used 2 TBS of sugar and they were perfect for my taste preference. A helpful hint. If you would like your fritters more like a ball shape, chill the batter in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before cooking.  ONE REVIEWER SAID THEY ARE MESSY TO MAKE, I DISAGREE. NOT MESSY TO MAKE AT ALL. These are simple and tasty. best of all most have all that is needed on hand (THESE ARE GREAT WITH POWDERED SUGAR SPRINKLED ON TOP ).

I serve these as an appetiser at a North American-style Thanksgiving dinner which I prepare for my Chilean relatives every Christmas. They had never encountered corn fritters before and they are always a HUGE success.

Made enough for a family of 6 with dinner. Everyone liked them. I didnt really measure but I put in about a tablespoon of sugar and made half the batter as listed and then added jalepeno peppers to the second half.

I tried it using fresh corn cut off the cob (it had been sitting in the fridge way too long).  Seemed to work fine!  I did add a bit more sugar to try to get the picky kid to eat it - and I used King Arthur "White Whole Wheat" flour.  The biggest problem I had is that I don't have a deep fryer and I seem to have lost my instant read thermometer.  The oil tasted just slightly off - so I suspect it was a bit old - but  they still tasted good! :-)

Great recipe that gives lots of room for you to make it your own. I use cream style corn to add more flavour (and cut down the milk slightly to make up for the added liquid).

These tasted ok, but I was expecting them to be sweeter. I've never had corn fritters that weren't sweet. My husband liked them though, and they were easy to make. Next time I'll add sugar to the batter.

Kind of bland. Better directions would have been helpful since the smallest of my fritters were better than the biggest, and I didn't cook any of them long enough so they were all a tad doughy in the middle although they were quite golden brown in color.  Also too much corn.  I like them with a dusting of powdered sugar too which is not in this recipe.

I had never made corn fritters before (I KNOW, Whodda Thunk!) The timing was such that I could easily incorporate it into my chicken dinner meal.  The ingredients were simple.  The only thing I changed is I added 1/2 tsp onion powder.

I am a Jailhouse cook and I tried the corn fritters, today. Every Sheriff and every Inmate could not get enough of them. IT WAS GREAT! The Senior Sheriff's kept saying, I have not had these since I was a kid, as they were munching away. Others have never had corn fritters before and loved them! Everyone absolutely loved them! I did not change any of the ingredients though I may have put a little more sugar/salt in the recipe. I would recommend this recipe to anyone who loved a 'sweet bread/corn' recipe. Down home cooking!

I should have read the reviews b4 I tempted this, they turned out ok but me and my kids felt that there was NOT enough corn in the fritters.  We had more dough than anything. Next time I will add 1 1/2 cans or maybe even 2 cans of corn. Also, I didn't realize that they are suppose to be sweet.  Me and my kids love sweet corn when I make it regularly and I did add more sugar when I made this but apparently not enough, next time I will add more sugar.

These are great and this is a wonderful base recipe, I have made a few times and depending on mood I have modified.  Feeling “Sweet” added a teaspoon of sugar and served with maple syrup. Feeling “Sassy” added 2 tablespoon of fresh chopped basil and served with a red chili dipping sauce. Both varieties were super.

These turned out very well, very crispy.    I dumped a 15 1/2 ounce of corn into the batter before realizing it was too much.  Added a little bit more flour, shortening, salt & sugar to make up for the added corn.  I believe if you follow the recipe exactly, you will get great results.  Also sprinkled in a tablespoon of red pepper flakes.  Would have added jalapeno if had them.  You can use this as a basic recipe for any deep friend food.

pretty good, though next time i think i would add a little more sugar and a little less shortening. since we don't use maple syrup we like our fritters a little bit sweeter.

Definitely needs more sugar. I added an extra teaspoon or so. Also added paprika, cayenne pepper and ground mustard. Topped with honey. YUM. With the changes, it's a 5.

We did not particular care for these because we are used to the (processed) sweet corn fritters/nuggets.  I doubled the sugar, too, but it just tasted like fried dough.

These were delicious!  I added some cheddar cheese.  My husband and I ate the whole batch in one sitting, by ourselves.  The only thing this needs is more salt.

These were excellent.  They had great flavor and were fluffy and delicious.

The only change I would make is to add a little bit more corn but the recipe was fantastic as was.

I used fresh corn shaved off the cob and added a bit more than the recipe called for. Added a bit extra sugar also (1 Tbsp). They were very good but everyone agreed they should be sweeter. This recipe makes a lot of fritters so I saved 1/2 the batter and added another Tbsp of sugar and very lightly dusted with powdered sugar before serving. Much better with the extra sugar - and we are not a heavy sweets family.

We enjoyed these (we ate them with maple butter), but they were so filling!  Make them on the smaler side.  Our first few were too big and still doughy in the middle.  Once we made them smaller, they fried perfectly.

These were a fun snack! I realized that you could add pretty much anything to them, hot dog, peas, chopped jalapeno... it was fun to get creative

Pretty good....I used olive oil instead of the shortening in the batter and I also used fresh corn off the cob that was leftover.....I may also  up the sugar next time for a sweeter fritter....all in all...very tasty. Thanks!

I didn't like this recipe too much.  I guess I was looking for something more like E&O Trading as an appetizer not breakfast.  These corn fritters taste too much like pancakes for me.

Very good, as is.  Mix as directed, but cover and chill 20-30 minutes before frying, it really ups the ante on these treats. I didn't add more sugar as some suggested because I usually either dust with confectioner's sugar or serve with warmed maple syrup.

I, too, increased sugar to 2T. This recipe is exactly as my mother's corn fritters were in my childhood. Some people might think that corn fritters should be sweet, but that is not the case. These are not a pastry or donut type of fritter. They are a savory fritter. If you want 'sweet', use a honey butter with them. It's perfect.

VERY GOOD! I added extra sugar, used melted butter instead of shortening and cut back on the corn slightly, and  they were delicious! We made these the first time for a school project. The batter was easy enough for a 10 year old to make. I did the frying of course, however next time I will make them in a shallow skillit with oil instead of using a deep fryer. I think the batter will stay together better that way.

these were really good!  i had some corn and sauteed leeks left over from Christmas dinner, so used them along with half white flour/half whole wheat flour----they came out terrific!
Seven years later and I just made these again---this time I used a can of Mexicorn and all white flour.  They were light as air and delicious.  Had them with a Jamaican jerk vegetable stew.  So so good!

Came out exactly as it looks on the photograph. Tastes light and fliffy. i added chopped onions for the extra sweetness, Maybe i can saute the onions before adding to make it sweeter.

These were easy to make,not to many are left but I will say that this makes more than a dozen,at least for me but advice! try making them small,the larger they are the longer they take to cook and you wind up burning the outside before you get inside. I forgot to sift so I imagine they would have been even better.

These were delish!  They are supposed to be sweet not salty.  I did go with butter vs. shortening and 1 t. of sugar with powdered sugar dusted on top after they drained on the paper towel.  If anyone has ever had the corn fritters at White Fence Farm these are as close as you can get!  Very easy too!

These were good and we enjoyed them -- although as the others mentioned they were a little plain even with added sugar.  I think we'll try this again using creamed corn.

These fritters are DELICIOUS!  I just made 2 minor adjustments - used a 16 oz can of corn this time to increase the corn ratio, and used about 1/4 c of sugar instead because I like them sweet.

These were yummy I added a little more sugar like others stated and some diced jalepenos (drain) for a little kick.  I served them along with my fried red snapper and cole slaw.

Ok, I just made this recipe...I used 3/4 cup of flour and 1/4 cup of white corn meal, and doubled the sugar...and I have to say they were awesome...golden brown on the outside and light on inside just bursting with with corn flavor.

These were excellent! Tasted like the corn fritters you can get at mom-and-pop country restaurants. Connecticut-born hubby had never had these, and he loved them. Thanks for submitting some good old fashioned Southern cuisine.

I'm a beginning cooker, and made these for a church potluck.  even though I quadrupled the recipe, they disappeared in minutes!
Easy to do, and very tasty- my friends have been begging me to make these again ever since.

As a Canadian, whose never had hush puppies or fritters, it was an interesting recipe. I wanted to dip them in something for more flavour. Loved all the corn though! I'm looking fwd to travelling south and tasting the real thing.

I've been looking a long time for a good corn fritter recipe that was "just like Mom used to make" and this one is pretty darn close!  We all loved these. I made them last night and between me, my husband, and mother in law...they are all gone. I reheated the last few for lunch today and they were even good leftover! I think this recipe would make some great apple fritters or fried doughnuts with some added sugar; I'm going to experiment! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I grew up on these.  We serve them with butter and syrup.  You can also used canned peaches or apples sauted in a little cinnamon and brown sugar.  Try them.  You will be hooked.

These were not what I expected at all.  They had no flavor, no salt, no sweetness, nothing.  They just tasted like a ball of cooked flour.   My husband who is also a professional chef said that I used too much flour and they didn't have enough flavor. Also I did have the uncooked centers as well, then flattened them out more in the pan to solve the problem.  I like corn fritters but wouldn't use this recipe again.

Wow these were great!!
I made these instead of hushpuppies to go along with the crispy fish recipe....and they were terrific, but I did use 2Tbs. of sugar ( wished I had used a little more) and I also added 1 Tbs. of Dried minced onion. And it really made a diff. It was a cross between a hushpuppy and a corn fritter. 
Thank you for the recipe!!
Everyone loved it!!!!!

Had some leftover corn from corn on the cob & decided to try this.  Used the 1/4 cup sugar as others suggested and threw in some paprika to give it a kick.  I also added extra milk since my corn was fresh.  Everyone loved it.  My picky kids and husband who usually complain!

Yummy - we really enjoyed these!  The only change I would make next time I make them is to use cream-style corn instead of whole kernal corn.

I made these fritters as a side dish for dinner.  My husband LOVED them!  I did add the extra sugar.  I didnt deep fry them but just put a little olive oil in the pan and they came out nice and crispy.  I have already cut out the recipe and added it to my box.

These turned out great.  I used canned corn and made them with the fish recipe from this website "Classic Fish and Chips."  Dinner was a big hit.  These are great with honey dribbled over them.

My 5 year old neice and I tried these following the recipe as written.  I went back and added more sugar to it, they tasted better, but she wasnt overly impressed.  My mother, however did enjoy them. Hmmmmmmm, I will keep the recipe, but I probably will not make them too often. (sorry)

Yum!  I added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar and 1/4 tsp salt, and fried them in olive oil Pam mixed w/ a dash of olive oil (for flavor) in order to make the recipe lower in fat.  Ate them w/ strawberry jam, and they were great!

I lost my tried-and-tested recipe for corn fritters, so I though I'd try this one. Although the ingedients were pretty much the same, these were ok but not as good as the ones I have made before.

As for the taste of them...they were ok. I made several batches of them...without the corn and none of them cooked all the way through. I followed the recipe exactly so I am not quite sure what went wrong. I told my little one that I was making him a little surprise for breakfast but....just did not happen.

The only corn fritters I've ever eaten were at a particular restaurant, and these weren't quite like that.  Those were sweeter, without needing anything put on them to make them so.  I did whip up some honey butter to dip these in and they were quite good that way.  I think I'll make these again and spice them up a little with cheese or something, and try a different recipe when I'm in the mood for something sweet.

This recipe is very easy and good. I found that it is nice to spice up a bit with the addition of monterey jack cheese and some salsa.

I read reviews before making and I wish I hadn't. I backed off the amount of corn and if anything I would add more. The batter puffs up nice and big and so I felt there was definitely room for more corn. If you like it sweeter an extra tsp or so of sugar would add a nice touch too. These turned out to be more like hushpuppies with a touch of corn.

This was a really good recipe except I changed mine up a bit i substituted buttermilk from milk. I also added a half cup of shredded cheddar cheese and 2 tablespoons of chopped jalapenos. These were so bomb you can use any hearty vegetable in this recipe as well.

I doubled the recipe because I could see from the quantity of ingredients that 1 cup of flour and 1/2 cup of milk was NOT going to make the quantity that I expected to make.  Therefore, I doubled all the ingredients and added approx a tsp of vanilla extract.  I also used 1 10 oz bag of Birds-eye frozen whole kernel corn (thawed).  It produced approximately 20 fritters that were light, fluffy, flavorful, full of fresh tasting corn and not greasy at all. Highly recommended!

So easy to make. Requires ingredients always in stock in my pantry.  My kids request these often. I like them with just a tad extra sugar but that's just my personal preference. Tastes great just as the recipe instructs. Thanks for a great recipe

not bad...a little more doughy-breadlike than I prefer...but um....I ate like 5 of them anyway, lol.  Maybe a mixture of cornmeal and flour might give it the texture I was looking for?

Was ALMOST like Moms (God rest her soul). 

The only thing I did different (which my Mom did) was to add a TON more sugar (half a cup) and a tablespoon or two of Vanilla extract. Sprinkle on a bit with either cinnamon and nutmeg (or both) will "spice" things up, even more.

With theses added things; this turned out GREAT!!! (just like Mom made [100%]). 

I purchased some "premium" Maple Syrup (from Vermont), via Amazon, and it really made my head (and tongue) spin!! - LOL :-) 

The trick is always to get the batter to form into the proper "ball" form (solution: Make sure your cooking oil is REALLY HOT!!). Use either tongs, or chopsticks, to rotate balls, while cooking (otherwise, one side will get too well done).

So overall, dee...lish [5 star, for taste] --  try it out (you will NOT be disappointed!!)

We have been making this recipe for years, but with a slight variation; we reserve 1//2 cup of the corn liquid for use in the recipe and omit the milk. The difference is minimal, a slightly lighter fritter and still YUM!

i love this recipe. It's easy to make. I made it as is and it works with sweet glazes. I have also added some vanilla rolled them in a cinnamon sugar mixture and that was divine.  I will definitely try again.

The best. I added 1/2 cup of crab meat and 1/4 cup corn meal as suggested by a couple other reviewers. I substituted 1 1/2 cups of frozen corn because I think it's better than canned corn, used self-rising flour rather than all-purpose flour and baking powder, buttermilk rather than regular milk, butter rather than shortening, and topped with maple syrup. Ummmy!

I made these as instructed and was VERY disappointed. The fritters were way too doughy - I was expecting to bite into corn. Instead I ate what I can only describe as a fried corn muffin. Next time I will be freezing my corn in a mini muffin tin before dunking them in the batter to achieve the result I was looking for.

Used 3 ears fresh corn. Next time use LESS. Added 1/4 sugar to batter and sprinkled with sugar after frying. Consider cutting recipe in half. They are best fresh and family each only ate one.

These are great my family always sprinkled with powdered sugar after being removed from the oil and sat on a plate with paper towels to soak the excess for a minute and that's what I did for these and they were delicious. So for those complaining about it not being sweet enough just sift some powdered sugar on top and you'll get the sweetness your looking for.

I needed to make this gluten free so used a blend of gluten free flours and added 1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum. The texture was great!
Only other changes - I used 2 tablespoons sugar instead of what was in the recipe and only about 8 oz. corn. Was a real treat!

Use a little less corn next time (used a 341ml can), and also used just a tad less than 1/4 cup of sugar. Came out delicious and will make again for sure! Served with maple syrup, raspberry jam, and ketchup.

I made these and to me they were more like deep fried corn biscuits not fritters.  I sprinkled powdered sugar on them and honey.  I'm going to look for another recipe.

Simple and quick.  Kids and everyone loved it!  I agree that fresh corn is best and creates crispy texture inside, but I used half the amount of corn and sprinkled with powdered sugar at end.

Took  advice from others and used 1/4 cup sugar and doubled the baking powder. Fried in lard rather than oil, and they had a lovely crispness to them.

Great base, but a corn fritter should carry more corn flavor by substituting 1/4 of the flour with corn flour or meal, and adding the corn liquid from the can if using canned, instead of milk, or using enough milk to get the 1/2 c. liquid this recipe calls for.  I also used 1 1/2 teas. sugar.  NOW they taste like perfect corn fritters!  :)

This is a new family favorite!  
I used coconut oil in lue of shortening, and used about 1 Tbsp of sugar, so it brings out the sweetness of the corn, but isn't really a dessert food.  
Next time I may add chili powder and a bit of Cheyenne pepper.  Yum!

Growing up my mother would buy Mrs Paul's Corn Fritters.  For over 30 years since they stopped making them I have been trying to duplicate them. This recipe with some changed worked and is now my favorite.  
Added 1/3 cup of 10x sugar
Added total of 16oz of fresh corn
Used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk
I am the chef in a B&B that has a corn field and there is too much corn to freeze so we have added corn to the breakfast menu daily!  
I served this with Hot Pepper jelly - Huge hit!

As is, the recipe tasted flat. It's only good when heavily modified. Needed more corn flavor. 

Melted shortening seizes up immediately when added to the cold batter so pour it in a swirl while stirring.

I added some finely chopped onion which helped a bit. Next time, I'll blend up some of the corn, add more sugar, and fry it in corn oil.

Five stars!!! My new comfort food. Easy to make and delish. I didn't deep fry them, just sautéed in a pan. Thank you SO much for sharing.

I pan-fry these instead of deep frying them, so I made them into patties instead of traditional prayers. The kids weren't sold on them. I used two tablespoons of sugar and 1 1/2 c. corn off the cob, frozen from last year. They were good but didn't taste as good as my mom's.

Excellent, easy, fast. Nice when you have uneaten corn on the cob. Added a little more sugar, but that's a matter of taste. Will definitely make again.

I like them very much, however I like things a little spicier, so I will add more "stuff" the next time.
the cooking temp seemed a little off.. they cooked on the outside too quickly without cooking on the inside, so I turned the temp down.  make sure you drop small amounts so they aren't too big.. better for cooking inside.   good basic recipe

Great recipe, very simple and delicious. I am a whole grain nut, so I used all Whole Wheat flour and it still turned out primo. It took me a batch or two to get the size of the drop right: about a tablespoon. The first few were too big and a bit doughy. I cut them in half and popped 'em back in. Still great. Kid approved!

I loved this recipe! the batter was perfectly fluffy and not heavy our doughy. I did make one addition of my own to this recipe, however, I added one cup of finely chopped young dandelion greens and petals. It was a another great way to incorporate dandelion into our menu.

I did not make any changes to this recipe and everyone loved it! The batter ended up sitting about 15 minutes before I used it. The consistency was perfect even after sitting a few minutes. Very easy to make.

They are great warm but not as good when it gets cold. I have also used this recipe to make funnel cakes out of and it worked great and tasted great! I used someone else recommendation and added a little more sugar than the recipe called for.

Needs more salt, and I added scallions and a bit of onion powder to give a little more flavor. Could add any green herb to enhance flavor more. Even add a bit more sugar unless you will use maple syrup.

Made Vegan and was 5 stars!!.  Used Flax in place of egg, soy in place of dairy milk and vegan butter and they were perfect!!  ......oh, and frozen corn (thawed and drained) because I didn't have canned.   You'd never guess they weren't the real deal.   These reheated in the the toaster oven and tasted amazing...for BREAKFAST and served with maple syrup.   My four year old just requested them again for breakfast!!  Update:  Overtime I make this the batter is too thick........I add a little water (2T wish) and it makes the dough super light when cooked.  Also, made this with 2 small apples, a 1/2t cinnamon, dash nutmeg and they were incredible.  Did those vegan as well (egg allergies-boo) and they were incredible!

These turned out great, they were light, flavorful and did not absorb the oil so were not greasy.  I will make them again.  I did add one small chopped zucchini because I was a bit shy on the amount of corn and I have used another recipe that uses corn meal which I like the added flavor so I added a tablespoon of cornmeal.  Overall this is an excellent base recipe and would be very good without my additions also.  I would like to try the base recipe with okra.

Crispy and satisfying, but still fluffy.  Exactly what I was looking for!  I used 1.5 cups of frozen corn, and melted butter rather than shortening simply because that is what I had on hand.  I will definitely make these again!

They turned out great and the directions are easy to follow.  The only suggestion I would make, as others have made before me, is to add more sugar.

I grew up eating these. Only I drain the corn juice and add enough milk to equal 1/2 cup, and use no sugar or salt. Then serve with a side of confectioner sugar to dunk them in. So good

Exactly what I was looking for. This recipe, as written, is for a savory version of corn fritters, similar to those served at The Cheesecake Factory. I followed the recipe as written with just a few revisions. I used two teaspoons of sugar, one teaspoon of salt and 12 ounces of frozen corn because we don't used canned. I prefer round, slightly larger than golf ball sized fritters, so I lowered the heat to allow the middle to cook through. They were perfect.

These are absolutely scrumptious! I did not use the amount of oil it called for so I fried one side then the other as opposed to deep frying. I drained on paper towels, added a little butter and then syrup! Omg!

I made these fritters with a little bit of a twist and they were delicious !!!!!! 
Replaced the shortening with coconut oil 
Tripled the sugar
Replaced the corn with ripe mini plums from our tree which I de-pitted and roughly chopped skin left on approximately 1.5 cups worth but I'm not super picky on measurements

I made these last night and followed the recipe exactly.  I've made many other versions of these fritters including with creamed corn, and these were by far the best.  I think it's the sifting of the dry ingredients.  My husband, who is not shy about critiquing my cooking agrees with me.

my son loves this!  I already had the ingredients lying around and I can't believe how easy it was to make!  I added some more sugar because I don't like anything on top of it but my son loves it with honey!  I will definitely be making this again!

I made these for the first time today and I was skeptical due to the mixed reviews, but I have to say they turned out great and the whole family loved them!!! I did increase the flour by 1/2 a cup per other reviewers, and added black pepper, paprika and cajun seasoning! Other than that I stuck to the recipe and they were sooooo good!! Will definately be making these again! Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Thought it was great and easy.  I did add the extra sugar like some suggested because we like it sweet.  Can't wait to try with some apples as some suggested. YUMMY!

I thought these were great.  They came out just like the picture showed.  I was just wondering if hamburger meat (cooked) could be added into the receipe--just for an added flavor?

I just made these. They were ok. Not what I remember a corn fritter to taste like. No matter how I cooked them they weren't crispy enough on the outside. Not at all sweet and they were a little doughy. Good just not what I was hoping for.

My family loved these.   Easy to make, great taste.  I had two ears of fresh corn that were not cooked.  I husked them, wrapped them in a wet paper towel and microwaved them for 5 mintues.   Then cut corn off and proceeded with recipe.  Worked great.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and added extra sugar.  I used 1 tablespoon.   While they were delicious, I would add 1.5 to 2 tablespoons next time.    Very good!

My mom made these for my dad, throughout my childhood. This treat reminds me of funnel cakes, hushpuppy style, and w/corn.  Our fritters are much like this one, but using bisquick in place of flour. Our fritters are also rolled, or shaken w/ powdered sugar. WOW. This treat has always been a 'summer thing' due to using fresh corn.

I made 1/2 of this recipe and it was plenty for the two of us to replace our potatoes.  I dropped by the tablespoon cooking two at a time for about 3 minutes turning to brown.  I left the sugar the same as some reviewers suggested it needed more sugar.  Next time I will reduce the sugar as well.  Plenty sweet enough for us.

I was looking for a recipe similar to corn fritters I had tasted years ago at White Fence Farms in Denver, and after some searching made these (in lieu of cornbread) for Thanksgiving this year.  They were a HUGE hit!  Not one left, and a whole basket of my Nana's famous home-made dinner rolls sitting there all lonely and uneaten!  I followed the suggestion of adding 2 Tbsp of sugar to the mix, and also dusted them lightly with powdered sugar just before serving.  All members at my dinner table, young and old, loved them!

These are easy to make, and they come out nice.  I added more sugar than called for.  Also good served w/ maple syrup (warm the syrup once fritters have cooled).  I've tried a lot of fritter recipies, & this one's a keeper

This was an okay recipe. I thought it needed more corn and I would have liked it to be sweeter as well. I followed recipe exactly this time but will change it up a bit next time and follow some other reviews. It was just like eating fried bread to me.

Made these corn fritters lastnight for supper and all i can say is YUMMO!!!  I doubled the recipe and used a little more flour and sugar.  Also had fresh corn that we put up in freezer, used 2 bags.  Everyone including grandson Oliver who is 19 months devoured them.  I told my daughter put maple syrup on them...she like "What"  ewwwww..she then tried it and was hooked.  Will definitely make these again...easy to put together..batter is better in fridge for a few hours before frying.

These are so easy! I did make a couple as stated and they needed more salt. I also added some ground red pepper and a little bit of Tony's and a tiny bit of garlic powder for somemore spice.

Excellent recipe! We fell in love with these. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I think I added a little bit more sugar in the batter and then topped with powdered sugar after they were cooked. We felt like we were at the state fair!

I made these for dinner tonight and they were great, I am always afraid to serve something new to my family, they are picky, but they loved them. Next time I am going to chop some onion into this and flavor it up a bit.. don't tell my family if they know there's onion they won't eat it. I had mine with Bleu Cheese dressing and they had maple syrup to dip them in. They were good without too! Thanks

Good, but came out kind of greasy.  Not sure if I did something wrong or what.  Next time I make these, I'll add more corn.  These didn't seem to have enough.  It was more dough than anything.

Very quick and very easy.  I didn't find it time intensive at all.  I have a Fry Daddy at home, so it was really easy to keep the oil hot.  It made a good amount of fritters.  I followed the suggestion of adding 2 tsp of sugar and served with syrup.  Very good!!!

I thought this was very good. But it did lack a little flavor. Had some leftover so I made 1/2 the amount and added a dash of nutmeg,cayenne pepper,cumin,onion powder,garlic powder, and diced onion to the leftovers. This made it much better for my pallet. Will keep this one around. It just needed a little more heat for me.

I usually like to make a recipe as its written, but I didn't have any flour. I followed the recipe exactly, but I used a cup of corn muffin mix instead of the flour. It was very tasty. I cooked it on the stove in some oil instead of the deep fryer(only cause I didn't want to clean it..lol). They were very good. Next time I will try it with the flour, but the corn muffin mix gave it a nice crunch and nice taste.

Not bad as written, but a little bland.  I upped the sugar and added chili powder.  I will make again with slight adjustments.  Thanks for the basic recipe JenInCali!

Definetely more sugar.  Too much lard for our liking. Others suggested a mixture of cream corn and whole kernal corn, but that did not work out so well for us, but the Mexicorn is great to try for those who like a little bit of Latin flavor.

change it to 1/4 cup of sugar and these are FABULOUS! I served them with Christmas dinner and they were such a hit! An easy side dish for any dinner!

These were not exactly what I expected, not as sweet. The battter reminded me more of sweet and sour chicken coating than the more bread like dough fritters I was hoping for. I would use this for other deep frying in the future.

I made this a couple of months ago as is and I thought it tasted pretty bland. We have this restaurant by us that makes the most amazing corn fritters ever so I was looking for something similar but unfortunately this was not it. I think if you increased the sugar alittle it would taste better.

Quick and easy! I omitted the sugar, and used as a potato substitute. Delishouse drenched in roast gravy! Was huge hit.

The first time I made this it didn't have enough corn flavor for us so the next time I substituted 1/4 of the flour for cornmeal and replaced half the whole kernal corn with creamstyle corn. I used 1 tablespoon of sugar. We served this with butter and honey. They were devoured within minutes at a potluck!

I was craving corn fritters one night, so went out and bought a deep fryer. I came across this recipe and was not disappointed. I have to say it wasn't exactly what I was looking for, but they were delicious.

good but bland. Even when I added some garlic salt they were bland.  I wanted something else to give them something extra.  Maybe some cheese in the mix next time?  My husband said they were better once you put butter on them but I didn't want the extra fat!  Will play with the recipe & make again I think though...

I cooked up a few of these, tasted them and decided they should be sweeter.  I added a lot of sugar, (not sure how much) and they were sweeter, but not something I would make again.  They kind of reminded me of hush puppies with corn in them.  I also feel compelled to share this **WARNING** with others... I have never had this happen, but the first batch I put in the fry daddy, when I was turning them over in the grease, one exploded and HOT grease burned my finger and got all over my cabinets!  Not sure if any one else has experienced this, but be careful!!!!

I used these as a side dish. I served them topped with sour cream and chives.I cooked them in a pan so they came out a little bit flat so that i could top them.They were a good side with grilled pork and a salad.thank you for this recipe it was great.

These are perfect!  The only little change I made was adding 1/2 tsp of sugar instead of the 1/4 tsp.  I did that mostly because I was too lazy to search my drawer for the 1/4 tsp spoon. :)

Light and fluffy! My whole family loved these. I added extra sugar, as suggested by other reviews. I also put the corn in my mini-food processor, and chopped it up a little, as I thought they would be better like that, than with whole kernels -- they turned out GREAT this way!

I followed the suggestion by others and increased the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup.  I didn't have enough oil, so I just pan fried the fritters in about an inch of oil.  They ended up being thick, small pancake like fritters.  Everyone enjoyed them.  They were excellent.  I served with honey butter.  Wonderful!!!

I've been searching for a good corn fritter recipe for a long time. I've found it here.  I do not like the texture of the whipped white recipes.  I think that the baking powder could be omitted if using self rising flour so they are not quite so puffy.  I made the mistake of using 1/4 CUP. white sugar instead of 1/4 T but they turned out very good.  I actually added some left over ham cubed into small pcs. and Mmmm Mmmm Good!  Thanks for this recipe

Made these for my parents and family.  They disappeared rather fast! I also sprinkled with confectioners sugar for a little extra sweet. They even used them to soak up green bean juice on their plates!

I didn't even know about these until my coworker Melissa mentioned them one day. I cut all the ingredients by half but I did increase the sugar to 1/8 of a cup (1/4 cup for the original recipe) and it definitely needed it. I sprinkled confectioner's sugar on top and voila!! Another one of those "turn-a-healthy-thing-into-a-heart-attack-but-you'll-die-happy" thing.

This was pretty good, although I think there should've been some kind of dipping sauce to go with it, maybe sweet and sour! They did turn out very fluffy though.

These were good.  I added about a 1/4 cup cornmeal hoping for a real crisp outside.  Texture was more like a donut, but still got good reviews from the tasters.  Served with Soup.

Pretty tasty.  It does seem to be missing something. I'll have to experiment. Maybe a little more sugar. But will make again!

My daughter and mother -in-law really liked these.  However I thought they were a little bland, needed more sugar and unfortunately I didn't have time to read the reviews or I would have made adjustments.  They were not bad.  They just need a little tweaking.

Yes, definitely 1/4 cup of sugar.  I did use butter instead of shortening.  I had the same problem with the first two I fried for testing with the middle not being done so I spooned the batter into a ziploc bag, cut the corner just big enough to squeeze out 'finger' shapes straight in to the oil.  This worked really well, they were perfectly cooked and was so good with our chili.

I don't know what went wrong with this recipe! It was still doughy and not sweet enough.

Quick and easy.  Great texture.  Instead of melted shortening, I just used vegetable oil and they came out fine.  Ate them with jalapeno jelly and they were very good.  Next time I'll add more spice and some crab meat.

I used to have corn fritters when I was a child and they were slightly sweet so I added a 1/4 cup of sugar to this recipe and they came out just as I remembered. They were awesome and everyone who tasted them loved them. I highly recommend them.
