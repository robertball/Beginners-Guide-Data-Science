Thanks SunKissed 31, these are great burgers.  I did change a few things, just because my husband and five year old daughter might not have liked the pineapple rings.  I added an 8 oz. can of crushed pineapple that I drained the juice from, I added a 1/4 C. of shredded cheese, and I reduced the ketchup & brown sugar to 1/8 C and the mustard to 1/4 to 1/2 tsp.  I mixed it all together and heated in a saucepan and then I added it to the ground beef, pineapple, and cheese.  Then I used my hamburger press to pat out the burgers, and they were GREAT, moist and not the least bit messy with a five year old.  Thanks again, I will make these burgers again, and again, and again.  My whole family loved them.

Everyone has a favorite hamburger recipe. My experience has been that the recipes don't often provide enough of a twist to make investing in the new ingredients and process worthwhile.  Not true with "Surprise Burgers." This is a truly interesting, awesome embellishment to the classic burger.  Though simple, the sauce is exceptional and compliments the sweet pineapple in a most appropriate and compelling way.  The only addition I made was my ubiquitous onion. I used two pounds of ground chuck and used a small, drained can of pineapple, which other reviewers have recommended.  Thanks for those recommendations! The crushed pineapple provided a taste of pineapple in nearly every bite!  Though I was working with a low-fat version of ground beef, the pineapple kept it moist.

Simply delicious.  I used fresh pineapple cut into chunks.  My only recommendation is to cut up the pineapple into very small pieces or to used crushed pineapple, since the big hunks undermine the moistness and texture of the hamburger.  I love the sauce- I might just use it on my hamburgers and skip the pineapple if I'm in a hurry.

This was really great! My boyfriend and I ended up mixing the brown sugar sauce (same quantity as prepared in the recipe), and some leftover crushed pineapple (about 2cups) into two pounds of hamburger because he accidently thawed out both pounds :D. They tasted wonderful, sweet and tangy with pineapple in every bite. The moisture was just right and even with the sauce mixed into the meat the burgers stayed together very well. Served with some grilled pineapple, red bell pepper, rice and teriyaki sauce on the side this made for a recipe we're sure to make again. Thanks!

WONDERFUL!!!  My husband and I grilled these burgers the other night.  The pineapple helps to keep the lean meat very moist.  The sauce is like icing on a cake.  This is one of the best recipes I have tried from this site, and I have tried many.

Awesome burgers. I used crushed pineapples also. Added some diced jalapeno too. For the sauce I added a few tbs of the pineapple juice and left out the mustard. Very good. will make again!

SunKissed, you have made my day! I used 1-1/2 pounds of ground beef because, well, I like beef and that's the quantity I have mine packaged! Besides, it may be a little tougher to get four double-layer burgers out of just a pound! Anyway, I served them with a side of potato salad and the folks here in the canyon just loved them - and I did, too! This one goes into my file for dinners when company is here, but it will no doubt be used much more often than that!

Ummm...  Way too sweet!  And the sauce makes far, far too much.  I used about half of it on the grilling burgers, and offered the rest to the family at the table.  I used 2 lbs. of hamburger instead of 1 lb., and made 6 burgers.  (Didn't double the sauce recipe, but it was still too much, too sweet.)  In fact, I halved the brown sugar.  Well, what can I say.  It's just waaay too sweet!  My husband's comment was, "needs some seasonings or something to cut the sweet taste."  There you have it.

The flavor of this is unbelievable - the burgers were incredibly moist due to the pineapple, and the simple sauce is out of this world.  I put a little of the sauce on the burgers as they were cooking and they were excellent.  The only thing I might change next time is to use crushed pineapple in the center instead of a pineapple ring.  The pineapple rings weren't very easy to bite into and I made quite a mess eating them.  This is my new burger receipe - thank you!

My new favorite recipe that got made again and again all summer long! Not all people will find this appealing but with a little creativity you can adjust it and make it your own. 
   I love the sauce too it has become my new bbq sauce. It's great for kids because it is so sweet. I add this sauce to anything my kid won't eat and he gobbles it right up.
   I like adding pepperjack cheese chunks to the burgers to give it a spicy sweetness. So tasty!

Fast, easy and yummy!  I added 1 small can of drained crushed pineapple to 1 lb of ground beef. Made for nice moist burgers. The sauce is so simple but so tasty!  Served with baked potato.  This will be a favorite in our family from now on.

These burgers are out of this world awesome!!! What really makes them great is the sweet sauce. For just the two of us I made two 1/2 lb. burgers. I can't imagine getting a whole pineapple ring in 1/4 lb. of beef. Next time I may try adding crushed pineapple and will add not quite 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  My husband bit into his burger and was very shocked by the pineapple inside. I yelled "Surprise" then told him they were called surprise burgers. LOL
I highly recommend this recipe. It is a very delicious alternative to a boring hamburger.

These burgers were so simple and delicious - my husband was "surprised" when he first bit into the burger - and then quickly adapted to the sweet taste in the burger - I highly recommend!!!

These are fantastic! However, the burger crumbled in three of my burgers, exposing my secret! I might add an egg in the future to hold it together. Also, I had way more sauce than I needed.

Loved it and my non-hamburger lovers did too!  Used crushed pineapple and seasoned meat as suggested.  Everyone loved it!! Used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce because I had some that needed to be used up.  Will definitely make again!

Well, it was a HIT with my family! I did the exact recipe only scaled it up for our 7-member family! I put them on the charcoal grill, my husband said they're better than Back Yard Burgers restaurant!!!! I would give more than 5 stars if possible.  Now every time I grill burgers, the children only want Surprise Burgers, not cheese burgers, not ranch burgers!  I've printing this one for my kitchen recipe box.

Theses were delicious. I especially loved the sauce. But next time I will coat the hamburger in egg and milk to keep it sticking together. Delicious.

Meat would not hold together around the pineapple. Tasted okay, but pineapple flavor was a little weak. Easier to just grill the pineapple rings & place them on top of the burger.

First, let me say that I only give a 5 star to foods that are "Thank God for this food".  The adults gave it a 4 star but the teens gave it a 2 1/2 to 3 star.  We too reduced the brown sugar and ketchup 50% and it was a pleasant mix of sweetness and tanginess.

A pleasant change of burger.

Was looking for a new burger; my boyfriend approved of the whole-heartedly, saying they're "about as good as burgers get"   He really loved the sauce, thought it tied the whole thing together.
Definately a keeper recipe...

These were a bit messy but ... YUM! Everyone loved them. I cooked them in the broiler and served on some nice bakery buns with a thin slice of red onion. So quick and easy. Will make again for sure!

Excellent!  There were a big hit at our cook out.  Also used ground turkey and it tasted great, whether beef or turkey burger.  Used pineapple chunks, not rings, though would work fine either way, I'm sure.  This recipe is a winner!

These were pretty good. I replaced the ground beef with ground pork (I don't eat red meat) and I added teriyaki glaze in the meat mix and then again on top.  The pineapple was really good in it (you can taste it through most of the burger), but I was wishing there was more.  I'm not sure how I'll do that.  Or maybe some fresh pineapple?  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good. I made it for friends and everyone liked it.  It took a little longer to barbecue, but other than some salt and pepper, I followed the recipe exactly.

A very simple and fun recipe for our elderly residents at the senior living facility I work at for our Hawaiian-style lunch menu. My boss asked me for a copy of the recipe so she can make it at home.

I used pineapple rings the first time I made this recipe. It was delicious, but difficult to work with and to eat. It is very good with crushed or chunked pineapple and helps keep turkey moist  if you are using turkey instead of beef.

Finally, a cheeseburger without cheese in our family!!  I used a 20 oz. can of crushed pineapple (actually didnt use the whole can) with 2 lbs. of venison.  It was awesome with the sauce.  I loved the sauce AND the burger.  thanks!

I used crushed pineapple right in the meat mixture along with the onion soup mix... I used 2lbs of ground beef...and made them into 8 patties...topped with that sauce and baked for 1 hour at 350 degrees! My husband said they are the BEST burgers/meatloaf EVER!!! =)

I was a little nervous to try this recipe because my family are very big into traditional burgers but I like to try new things so I gave this a shot. Like so many others I opted to use crushed pineapple but kept everything else the same. My family loved them and so did I. Definately using this recipe again, thank you!

YUM YUM YUMMMM!!!! Hubby went wild over these burgers- he took his first bite and said "Mmm, I love you.... I'm not sure if I said that to you, or to this burger." Super delicious and super easy. I put a little red onion and tomato on my bun and I was in heaven. Thank you so much!

Wonderful flavor!  I did not have any pineapple, so I added grape jelly instead.  I mixed the sauce in with the meat and added diced jalapenos (because we like some "heat").  Topped with pepper jack cheese.  Thanks SUNKISSED!  We will make these a lot!

I added a pinch of salt, an egg and half a packet of original shake and bake (crispy kind) to the ground beef before grilling. I was concerned about the pineapple, I've never had that with a burger before but it was surprisingly delicious! My 5 year old picky eater wanted seconds, and my husband really enjoyed it!! You can pull this off with 1lb of ground beef, but it's a bit difficult if you're using the pineapple rings, I'll use a bit more next time. Fantastic recipe idea!

The burger was good, however, the sauce was way to sweet for me.  I probably will not make these again, but for those of you who like sweet sauces, this is a keeper.

Made some Surprise pineapple burgers at a BBQ but didn't make enough.  I Used crushed drained pineapple and it worked out well.  Should have made more, had to cut burgers in half after cooking so there would be enough for all to taste. The sauce is really good.

This recipe has been in our family ever since I can remember growing up. I always looked forward to summer bbq as a kid, now as an adult I make it more offten. Although it's not for everyone if you don't like sweet then don't even bother! The only diffrance in the recipe from ours is that the sauce uses the left over pinapple juice from the can an a little less brown sugar.

This recipe didn't turn out good at all!The burgers were falling apart when I was trying to grill them and were actually mushy when they were done.  I never thought a hamburger could be mushy!  What I salvaged, we sat down to eat and my fiance' couldn't even eat it...yes, they were that bad.

Wonderful recipe! We loved the burgers and with 85% lean meat, the pinapple made them moist, but not messy. I cut down on the amount of sauce, but it was a great addition.

These burgers were delicious. I made half with ground turkey and half with ground sirloin and they both tasted great. I also diced jalapeno and mixed in with the ground meat first, because I like things a little spicy. Oh, and I used teryaki sauce from trader joes (the soy vey), i love the way it tastes.

My new favorite burgers.  So yummy, sweet, tangy, and juicy.  We cooked ours on the stovetop.  A bit messy, but so worth it.  Thanks for the tasty burger recipe!

When I read this recipe I wasn't too sure how they would turn out but we really enjoyed them. Something different to do with ground beef and very tasty....

Meh. It was okay, but not as great as I thought it would be given the ratings. We probably won't make it again. Kind of bland.

I was pleasantly surprised by these! (So, great title!) This recipe is incomparable to using pineapple as a topper on a burger.  Burger was incredibly juicy and flavorful.  Only problem I had was that I needed a lot of meat to completely cover the pineapple ring and it was more meat than I like for a burger.  Note:  Using crushed pineapple or tidbits will NOT give you the intended effect of this great burger!

This recipe was very easy and very tasty!  The whole family enjoyed and what a fun way to encourage the kids to eat supper.  The only thing I may try different next time is taking some of the sauce aside for the kids and maybe adding a little jalepeno in the rest.  Thanks Sunkissed31 for the recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great.  The second time I made it I followed what another reviewer suggested and used crushed pineapple and mixed it into the meat along with the glaze and that was even better

Don't get me wrong, the flavor is great, I just think it's a lot easier to slap the pineapple on top of the cooked burger.

Very lean meat; moist with pureed pineapple  & some sauce mixed in -->Not too filling, for a change! Nice change - sweet taste to burger.

I like pineapple on my burgers but these were mushy and they fell apart as I was cooking them! I think maybe using bread crumbs might keep them from falling apart and they also still need seasonings such as salt and pepper. A few changes in the recipe will make them so much better!!

These are my favorite burgers to make becuase they are so unique and tasty!  It is easier to get a well done burger with the crushed pinapple, but you're not really doing the burger justice.  Use the pinnaple rings.  I usually half the brown sugar just becuase I don't need it that sweet.

i think the brown sugar was'nt really special...but the idea of eating pineapple with burger was nice

is good to try it!

These were good, but nothing special.  They took only a few minutes to make.  I did them in the broiler and ate them without a bun.

Well, this is a pretty kick butt burger.  Having the pineapple in it really adds moisture to the patty that can be lost if you have the tendency of overcooking.  Like most, my mom and I used crushed pineapples after we used the rings.  I prefer the crushed just cause the rings have the tendency of having a tougher outer part due to the cooking?  

We have used the sauce but I found it to be exceptionally sweet (and this is coming from a person with a sweet tooth).  My mom was even creative enough to make a gravy and put pineapples in that, which was surprisingly good and very different.  Give it a shot--could be an interesting alternative to those who might find the initial sauce too rich.

Excellent. I just put pineapple in the sauce and used frozen patties. This would also be excellent as a meatloaf!

For me, the biggest surprise here is all the 5 stars this recipe has received.  I thought these were way too sweet and very soggy.  Almost inedible.  We ended up eating cereal for dinner.
