Surprisingly tasty - made for a summer potluck and heard many compliments. Make sure the melon pieces are small enough to eat the whole pick in one bite because itâ€™s the combination of flavors that makes this good. I got 1/2 pound of salami, sliced thin, and used a little more than half a medium-sized honeydew to make about 60 picks. Skewering the arugula was the slowest part but it still only took about 35 minutes to assemble them all.
