Flavor is very good I found when filling tart shells that the raisins were not eveny shared in tart, so putting raisins in shells before filling is a better way. I also plumped the raisins in a little brandy for special treat.

The flavor of these butter tarts is quite nice.  Next time I make them, I will cut the baking time back because my husband prefers his butter tarts quite a bit softer.

These are the best using 1/4 c butter and 1/3c corn syrup or maple syrup.  Recipe made 12 large butter tarts, I cook them 8 min at 400 then 5 min at 350. I like mine gooey.

HA!  I've been looking for this recipe for years!  This is great!!  I followed the other reviewers' advice and put the raisins in the bottom and then poured the filling over that. They plumped up really nicely.  Also, I used muffin tins and just lined those with pastry.   Awesome!!

These are so yummy and so very easy as i used premade tart shells. The cook time is waayyyy to high I did mine for 10 mins at 400 and then about 10-15 mins on 350. I tripled the recipe and it made 60 medium sized tarts!

I was looking for a recipe that replicated my mothers.  This one was the closest, except hers is a stove top cooked recipe.

Excellent!  I added the raisins to the shells, and then poured the mix over.  I also used home made pastry as opposed to the premade...My husband and kids LOVED them!  Definately a keeper here!

I used chopped pecans instead of walnuts and only put them in some of the tarts not all. Everything else I did the same. I used the Best Ever Pie crust from this site (awsome crust!) and they tasted nice... not to sweet, just how I like them. My tarts did overflow a bit... think I filled them a bit too full!

Great but I doubt the need to grease the tins as there is enough fat in most pastry.

Loved these! Just like my Aunt Marg used to make! Definitely keep the raisins and divide them into the shells before filling so as not to have clumps of raisins in some and not in others...

Solid recipe but I found the baking time needed to be reduced by at least 10 minutes, otherwise the tarts would have been much too dark. Otherwise a very good recipe.

My family super enjoyed these.  I made them in an extra-small muffin tin. Two bites of heavenly goodness. Added 2 raisins to the tarts prior to pouring the gooey goodness.  Also,skipped the walnuts and added one whole pecan on the top after filling the tarts. Only because my husband prefers pecans over walnuts.  Finally cooked in a preheated 200F oven for 15 minutes, then without removing the butter tarts, turn the oven up to 350F, for an additional 15 minutes.  Soooooo yummy.

I've tried with nuts alone as my step-daughter won't eat raisins. Next batch exactly as above 5/5. 3rd batch did raisins and almonds cut down brown sugar by a 1/3 rd of a cup and replaced with maple syrup. Outstanding!
