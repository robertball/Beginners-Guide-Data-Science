6.4.19  Mixed up the marinade in the morning, added the chicken cubes, and marinated all day for an easy evening dinner.  I live in Florida, so we pretty much can grill out all year.  But when it gets as hot as it is now, it’s no fun standing out by a grill, so I really liked that this was done in the oven (used my toaster oven)  in 20 minutes.  Honestly, grilling may have been better and that may be an option when it cools down, but for now, the oven worked great.  This chicken was absolutely delicious, tender, moist, good selection of herbs, bright flavor from the lemon juice, simply wouldn’t change a thing!  Thanks for sharing your recipe, we thoroughly enjoyed it

Very easy recipe to follow. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars was that I tend to eyeball my ingredients. The lemon was a little strong, but it was still very good! Cooked with rice and steamed veggies. Will make again!
