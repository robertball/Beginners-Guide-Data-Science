I decided to follow the original instructions and thought it was fantastic. The suggestions seemed to be for anyone who was looking for less heat. For me the hotter the better. I'll make this again. Next time I plan to double the sauce and add peppers or mushrooms to it. It'll be excellent over rice.

It s kind of sweet tasting and barbequey if you like that kind of stuff. But it s good other than that. Restaurant is still better but maybe I ll find a recipe I like more

Based on Dick's original description of this recipe along with the extreme amount of chipotle peppers in adobo I just knew this was going to be a bit hot for us though we do like very spicy food. So I cut way back and only used 2 chipotles in adobo (maybe 1/4 of the 7 oz can) 10 or 12 jalapeno slices from a jar instead of 2 whole fresh ones 1 clove of garlic instead of 2 and no salt (high blood pressure ya know). I also added a stalk of celery sliced along with the onions just because. Well it turned out very spicy even with the huge reduction in spices. We did enjoy it but any spicier and it would not have been edible for us. As is it would have been a 1-star recipe but the changes made it palatable and it was easy to make so I gave it 3. Also I recommend serving recipes like this on a bed of lettuce and/or adding sour cream to cool them off if they come out too spicy for you.

I added red and green bell peppers. I kept the jalapeno seeds and wooooo!!! Bam! Hot hot but so good. My husband and I love extra spicy food. I did not make the rice just threw it in a bowl with a little sour cream on top. Low carb perfection! My husband ate it with tortillas.

I did not add jalapeno's (tossed in a sliced green pepper instead) and only used 3-4 of the chipotle peppers which was more than enough heat. Too much heat and you can't taste the shrimp! Overall really great flavor but might cut back one more pepper next time as it was on the edge heat wise

I'm a little sorry that I didn't use all of the recommendations listed here. My husband and I love heat. The flavor in this dish was amazing and the heat was out of this world. I used two large jalapeños and I will definitely use only one next time. I added a dollop of sour cream which helped to cool the heat a bit and still maintained the smokey flavors. Also I used cooked shrimp and added them In the last ten minutes. This is a solid recipe.

I've been wanting to make this recipe for a long while now and finally decided to make it for SUPER BOWL SUNDAY.. and I must say IT WAS VERY VERY SPICY!! I omitted it just a little and took the advice of other reviewers and added red and green bell peppers with the onions and jalapeño peppers. And instead of brown rice I used white. I must say reason why I gave it a 4 star is because it was too too spicy for the next time I make this (because I will be making it again) I will not add the jalapeño peppers I think with the adobe chipolte chiles is more than enough heat for this dish. if you do enjoy a very spicy heat out your ears dish then add them but if not you can exclude them.

Loved this recipe!! I did add one sliced red & green bell pepper when cooking the onion but followed all other directions! It is a spicy dish - heat & smokey flavor. So yummy we will make again.

I added extra butter and garlic and olive oil some garlic powder and tobasco. Turned out great. We used 3cups white jasmine rice with 3 chicken cubes. Turned out great:))
