If you like the traditional corned beef dinner with potatoes, carrots, and cabbage then you should really give this a try. You get the flavor with added freshness. Bonus is that any leftover filling makes great breakfast burritos. Made as written and these were great! I did soften the cabbage in the microwave as the recipe submitter suggested. I don't mind the taste of raw cabbage but it just seemed to make them easier to fold up and eat. Don't skip the carrot salsa. It really brings everything together perfectly. Good job bd.weld!

This is a jazzed up version of corned beef and cabbage. I used the tender, inner leaves of baby cabbage stuffing them with the hot filling and this made the leaves warm but still fresh and slightly crispy. The carrot salsa is amazing!! Excellent recipe, thank you for sharing it with us.

It was okay, I thought it was really attractive on the plate. I could hardly taste the corned beef. However, my husband absolutely loved it. The carrot salsa was unusual. It didn’t provide enough bang for the buck for me. I would probably add some more tomato. I’m giving it a 4 as the average between my husband’s 5 and my 3 star.

We enjoyed this  I only gave four stars because we used leftover corned beef and not canned.

Yummy!  I used corned beef and potatoes (and a couple carrots) diced fairly fine, leftover from St. Patrick's  dinner, in place of canned hash. Other than that...made exactly as stated.  I'm really looking forward to this for lunch again tomorrow.  This is a healthy, yummy way to use some leftovers.  I did microwave the cabbage leaves a bit to soften.  Thank you so much for the great recipe!
