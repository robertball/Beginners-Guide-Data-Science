Four stars as written but five stars with my changes.  I used a red onion and about 8 seeded Campari tomatoes.  I also added a 4 oz package of crumbled basil & tomato feta cheese and a tablespoon of red wine vinegar.  I served this in whole-wheat pita bread with romaine lettuce.  Delicious!

Sooooo good! I did change some things: I used purple onion and cilantro instead of parsley (just because I like the flavor better). I added a little salt and pepper to taste and an extra lemon. I could eat this everyday! Love it!

This is a very good basic recipe, with a few addition it's a great salad. It really needs feta cheese, I also added a cucumber and a little of red vinegar. Very light but satisfying salad!

I made significant changes to this to give it some pizazz - hence the 3 stars.  I added a diced cumcumber, 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar, 1 tsp dried oregano, and doubled most everything else.  It's definitely a good base to start with and then play with your own extras.

Great salad to toss together, though I recommend doing it at least 8 hours before so all the flavors can blend.  I used a whole slicing tomato and whole bell pepper, and cilantro instead of the parsley.  I also added a tablespoon red wine vineager, added oregeno and cumin for flavor, as well as a salt, pepper, and garlic salt to taste.  Next time I think I'll use a red onion, but it was good with a regular Vidalia!

Great dish and so healthy.  I would recommend using a red onion for additional flavor and letting the salad marinate overnight.  It was great as a side dish.

Not bad at all for a last minute salad in a pinch with all ingredients almost always at hand. Not a big fan of the chopped onion, I'd rather see it very thinly sliced. I welcomed this recipe for its lighter dressing rather than one drowning in vinegar, and the chopped fresh parsley livens this up.  The recipe assumes, of course that you'll "salt and pepper to taste."

Brought this to a party and it was a hit!  Used grape tomato's instead of romas and added feta cheese (sun dried tomato and basil).  The olive oil and fresh lemon juice make an excellent dressing.  Fresh and good for you.  A+

Great!  I used sundried tomatoes instead of fresh and decreased the oil accordingly.  Thanks for a great salad!

Great idea!! We did make lots of modifications though (which would make it a 4 or 4.5 star dish).  I added an extra roma tomato. I sauted my garlic, onion, and green pepper in the 2 Tbsp of oil for a milder flavor (I dont care much for raw onion). We added sliced black olives and crumbled feta cheese too...so good! We swapped out the parlsey for cilantro, which I think is tastier and was cheaper anyway at the store.  If I had thought about it, I would have purchased artichoke hearts or hearts of palm to add, too.  We ate it over romaine lettuce for our main dish and it totally hit the spot!!

I sorry to say that this did not live up to my expectations at all.  Thought it would be wonderful and although it is not bad - the flavours never seem to meld (overnight).  I doubt I would make this again without serious changes.  I really don't know what is missing.  Perhaps it is texture, might try adding some black olives or perhaps some small bits of a mild feta cheese.

This was a refreshing use of chick peas and so easy!  I used what I had - chopped red bell pepper, no tomato, cilantro, parsley, basil, green onion, feta chunks - it was all good!

This is a great base recipe with personal tweakings.  Started with 3 cans chickpeas.  I used red vinegar and evoo for the "dressing" and added cilantro instread of parsley (has more flavor).  Used red onion instead of the bland green onion.  Seasoned with coarse ground black pepper and just a pinch of Cajun seasoning.  Put in one small chopped cucumber and 1-1/2 seeded Roma tomatoes and had a can of artichoke hearts (drained and cut into bite size pieces) which had in cupboard.  Let all sit in refrigerator overnight and put crumbled feta cheese upon serving each individual so they could decide if they wanted.  Such an easy and good recipe that you can tweak to your family's taste buds !  Try it - you'll like it !

I would recommend only using half an onion - this turned out to have too much for my taste. Otherwise it was great!

On it's own, it isn't anything to write home about. I did forget the parsley but I don't think that would have made a difference for me. But when I ate it on my plate with the turkey/quinoa meatloaf, and my romaine salad w/Ken's lite sweet vidalia onion dressing, it was quite good. The sweet vidalia onion dressing just makes anything taste better

So simple and delicious!!  Have been making this for years and the only thing I do differently is add sea salt and fresh ground pepper to taste, and a lot more parsley, usually 1/4 cup or more.  My husband requests this often and I'm happy to make it because it's so quick and easy.  A perfect summer time side dish!

I followed the recipe exactly and the taste was great. I was surprised that it didn't need salt (something I am trying to cut out). Next time, I would replace the green pepper with red pepper, and add cucumber as suggested by others. I would make this again.  Tasty.

i make this all the time; however, i also add sliced cucumber and kalamata olives (& some olive brine), 1/4 red onion, feta, oregano, and a jalapeno or serrano pepper, if i have any on hand.  i add cilantro to the parsley.  it also needs some cracked pepper (well, more than some) and kosher salt. occasionally, i use jalapeno- or lemon-infused EVOO, as well.  it's currently my fave meal of the day.  it's also pretty much the only way i'll eat green bell peppers.

I used green onions out of my garden, also added fresh mint, and instead of vinegar I used 4 small key limes. Only had a yellow pepper. I like garlic so added more. Turned out great

I altered this a fair bit, and really liked it! 3 times the tomato, 1/2 the olive oil, no onion or parsley, added some cucumbers, fresh chives and onion powder. I used lemon juice from a bottle instead of freshly squeezed.

Great salad! With the lettuce and spinach scare, I've been looking for salad options, and this is perfect. I added a touch of wine vinegar to this recipe and would use a red onion next time, but it is a big hit with the family.

Made this exactly to the recipe early in the morning so as to let the  flavours come together. Tasted it at 5pm as I had company coming it was so bland,  so I added red wine vinegar and oregano it was better but not great will not be making again. There was a lot left after my company left so it didn’t go down well.

Nice basic recipe. I added red bell pepper, English cucumber, feta cheese (goat or sheep milk, no cow milk-based "feta"), cilantro instead of parsley, 3 tomatoes, oregano, cumin and salt/pepper to taste. I agree that a splash of red wine vinegar improves the taste. With these modifications, I would give it 5 stars.

Could tell by the photo and list of ingredients  this would be amazing and it was!  Definitely will become a favorite and usually always have the ingredients on hand.

Minor changes: did not have fresh parsley, so added dried, and added one or two more  Roma tomatoes.  May try  adding fresh basil when available.  

May be fun to experiment with other herbs too, but the main ingredients as listed make a great salad..

Pretty bland as is. Needs more acid, salt and pepper maybe a little heat....like jalapeño. I'll make this recipe again but with more ingredients...update: followed recipe but added 3 tbsp red wine vinegar and 1 extra lemon it became a 4 star

We loved this with a few changes. I substituted cucumbers for the bell pepper since I didn't have any, and added a clove of garlic, some feta cheese and a tablespoon of red wine vinegar. Yum!

I normally make the Goya Mediterranean salad from the site. I thought I would try a different one for a change, but I really had to tweak this after tasting it as is. Only change I had made was just using a 1/4 of an onion, but the raw onion and green pepper was just so over powering. I ended up having to double all of the ingredients but those two, to balance the flavors. I was able to save it by doing that and adding some seasonings. However, the next day it still had that raw onion and pepper crunch and pronounced flavor. Will more likely toss this one unfortunately.

This recipe is "flat".  There needs to be a seasoning taste - whether you add salt and pepper, feta cheese, blue crumbled cheese, balsamic vinegar...These are the suggestions also in the reviews.  If you don't have "confidence" around flavors, then  "trust" these suggestions.  Add cukes, carrots etc...Great side dish!

I loved this.  It was exactly what I used to buy at the health food store for much more of course.  If you don't love "healthy" food, it isn't something that will change your mind.  My husband loves chickpeas but wouldn't eat this.  His loss!

Love it!  Did make some adjustments based on taste (I love onions, but don't think it needs a whole one), and availability - couldn't find any type of parsley in Okinawa, so I used a Tablespoon of Goya's Recaito, "Cilantro Cooking Base."  Great lunch, thanks!!

I didn’t have a green bell pepper so I used a seeded jalapeño to give it some zip. The salad was way too oniony and gave me agita. I sautéed the leftovers the next day and it was quite good after the onions caramelized and the flavors blended.

I thought it needed sweetening so I used some finely sliced Vidalia onion instead of chopped . Feta cheese crumbles added a bit of tartness.

I would make it again, but with a little less lemon. I put cilantro instead of parsley.

Fantastic with a savory dish especially. Next time I would cut the lemon to half. Otherwise, felt healthy and tasted great.

Very good and very simple!
I used red pepper instead of green, and I also added salt and pepper to taste, a touch of curry powder and a pinch of cayenne to give a bit of a kick. Great as a side or just as a snack. :)

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used a regular onion instead of a red one. I didn't like it as much as all of my guests did, but all of my guests thought it was the best dish of the night. I found it a bit bland and thought that perhaps a splash of balsamic would help, but all that aside, thanks :)

Love this recipe - can be made in just a few minutes and tastes great! Added more lemon for more tangy flavour.

As suggested by a previous reviewer I also added feta cheese and about a tablespoon of red wine vinegar.  The dressing was great!

This recipie is delicious! I added basalmic vinager to it, but I think a red wine vinager would also be good.  You can throw in any extra produce you have in your kitchen.  We used different peppers, mushrooms, red onion, and even some apple.  You don't have to marinate it over night but if you do I recommend using larger pieces of vegetables because they soften as they marinate.

This is a great summer salad. I made some changes per the reviews & my taste: balsamic vinegar, cilantro (instead of parsley), feta cheese, red onion, black olives. Marinating overnight is a good ide but not totally necessary. I like it over a bed of spinach or just plain. Thanks for the healthy, tasty salad!
