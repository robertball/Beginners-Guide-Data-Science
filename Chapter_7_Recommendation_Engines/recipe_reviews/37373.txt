Classic maybe, however not much flavor. Seasonings go a long way including some cajun spices.

This is very good and crunchy! I did add a dash or two of Emerils Essence. Make sure your catfish is dry before you coat it, and have the pan sizzling to insure a quick sear, and crusty outside.

Considering I'm just getting started in the kitchen.  I'm amazed at the results.  My husband and I barely made it to the table with the food after sampling it as we cooked!! We love catfish and this was some of the best we've EVER had (and we've had ALOT!!!)

Very tasty and easy for a basic fried catfish recipe - as good, if not better, than any we've had at a restaurant! Will definitely make this again when I don't feel like spending lots of time in the kitchen...

This was the best fried catfish I ever tried.  I actually signed up as a member today because I wanted to express how much I enjoyed this meal!  We even used the excess dry mix plus eggs and corn to make fried hush puppies to go with the catfish.  It turned out great!

Hubby & I have a restaurant. We tried this as a special tonite and it was quite a 'hit'. I had it for my supper and just loved it.  Just a little bite to it from the red pepper.  We had alot of compliments on it. Thanks so much for sharing it.

This recipe turned out great.   Most of the time these types of recipes don't have much flavor or are too floury.   But this was just right.   My other half said "This is a keeper".

This is alright, a nice change from bread crumbs and\or saltines.  It needed more flavor maybe add some paprika?  I'll pass this to my Dad...the fisherman, he will get it right.  Thanks-

We love catfish but this was my first attempt at frying it.  We were very pleased with the results and will make this a regular at our house.  We were lucky to get very fresh catfish that was prepared as thick fillets.  I cut the fish into fingers and it was perfect...thick enough to be meaty but not so big that the coating and seasonings weren't still a significant part of the overall flavor.  A big hit!

Very good! The breading has a slight "bite" from the cayenne pepper that blends wonderfully with the flavor of the fish.

This was just perfect. The fish was moist and tender, and the coating was crispy and flavorful. A perfect success! I served this with "Praline Sweet Potatoes" from this site for an awesome Southern-style meal.

Very good recipe.  Husband commented: You out did yourself honey.  I did make a few changes to fit our needs however.  I used Paprika in replacment of dried red pepper (paprika is just that) I also salted and peppered the fish prior to putting it into the cornmeal mix.  It also took about 15 minutes to fry each batch as I was making catfish chunks.  This will be my recipe of choice now for frying fish.

We don't deep fry, so this was a splurge for us.  Came out just as crispy as anytime I have had in a restaurant. I tried with Tilapia instead;tasted great!  I followed the recipe's breading exactly for half of the fish, and then for the remaining half, added some more seasonings(Chef Paul's Red Fish Seasoning). I liked the filets with the added seasoning much better. Tilapia is a very mild fish , however, so it probably needed more flavor than catfish would have. Next time I make a homemade "fish fry" I WILL use this recipe, just with some added spice.

It's the "no-frills" part of this recipe that I have a problem with. I don't really like the flavor of fish as-is, so the coating definitely needs more spice. Garlic powder and cayenne just don't do it for me. Either that, or a beer batter, or even a crust of panko instead of cornmeal.

This was well received at the cookout, but I did change a few things.  Added more garlic powder to the cornmeal mixture and some cayenne.  Dipped in the cornmeal, then in egg wash, back in cornmeal for a thicker batter.

I decided after reading the other reviews that this recipe would probably need some extra seasonings. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper and 1 1/2 teaspoons of parmesan cheese. My 93 year old Grandfather really seemed to enjoy it and said it was wonderful. Everyone else but 1 person thought it needed some more spices. I think I'd definately make it again, maybe just try a different combination of spices and seasonings.

eh, this was ok, I'm going to look for another recipe though. It wasn't as breaded as I thought it should have been. Maybe next time I'll dip the fish in egg first to make the crumbs stick...

Being a Southerner, we love farm-raised IQF catfish and this recipe is by far the very best ever! My only change was to fry in Crisco butter-flavored oil..great! Southern Living[tm]actually had more helpful hints which were:"Remove excess moisture from fish before dredging. Don't overcrowd the skillet;fry, in batches, two fillets @ a time. Bring remaining oil back to the proper temperature before frying the next batch. To keep warm, place fried fish on a wire rack with an aluminum foil-lined pan underneath;place in a 250 degree over. For a crisp testure, do not cover." Too, for those who like heat, some believe the #1 condiment is hot sauce!

I'll admit that I dunked the fish filets in beaten egg prior to dredging them in the cornmeal mixture, then frying. They turned out very tasty and crispy on the outside.

I seasoned the fish with the pepper, garlic powder and some paprika and cayenne before breading in the flour/cornmeal mixture to keep the pepper and paprika from burning.  The fish had great color, flavor and texture - yum!

I fried a couple of fish up exactly as the recipe stated and the fish were only lightly coated and not very flavourful.  I instead added an extra step after the first coating...I dipped the fish in beaten egg and then in the batter again.  I also added an extra teaspoon of Tony Chachere Creole seasoning to the batter. Between the two extra steps, that did the trick.  My girls, 10 & 8, and my husband then enjoyed the fish.  However, in my opinion, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend the original recipe.  It just did not *wow* my family or I.

One of our favorites for fish.  We add some crushed red pepper to spice it up, but otherwise follow the recipe exactly and have been very pleased.

This breading is so light.  My Dad dislikes cornmeal breading for fish, but he loved this one.

To be honest, I had never tried catfish before, and we really, really enjoyed this recipe. Would do it again!

A great and simple recipe.  The cornmeal is a must.  I add a dash of tabasco but it is not needed.

We're big catfish rans at our house, so I really was excited to try this one.  The only thing I did different was change the seasonings.  I had my hubby bring home some cajun spices from his restaurant (he's a Chef) and used them. I think most of us southerners would agree this is a good, standard catfish recipe.  Good for first-timers.

We didn't care for this.  I'd never had catfish before and wanted to try it.  I don't think it's any fault of the recipe, because it was easy and seemed like it should be good.  I just don't think that this "yankee" household cares for catfish.  Oh well....

I made this for my husband as a special birthday treat, for a small get together we were having, we don''t eat much fried stuff, he absolutely loved it! As did all of my guests!  It was a huge hit.  I accidentally fried the first batch in corn oil...it made the crust gummy, the final batches were done in the reccommended oil and they were da bomb!  I will be serving this again and again and again! Thanks

Good and super easy! I have made this a couple of times, and it is better than any catfish we get in restaurants.
