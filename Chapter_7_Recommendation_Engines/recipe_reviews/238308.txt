I made this for the weekend but made some minor changes. I used 4 ears of fresh white corn & added some cumin to the dressing! It was delicious and gone!  I'm sure the original recipe was yummy as well!  Thanks for the recipe!

Made as written and this turned out perfect for me. The onions were pretty dominant which is something I like but you may want to cut back on them if raw onions are not your thing. Same with the cilantro. This dish was simple and quick to whip up and it is a side that is universal enough to go with many different main dishes or just simply used as a dip. All of the different colors are also appealing to the eyes.
