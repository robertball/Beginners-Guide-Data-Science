Hi everyone this is my recipe! Thanks for all the great reviews however they have made a misprint in the submission.  It should read 3 large cans of whole tomatoes, crushed by hand NOT 3 tomatoes, that would make this very spicy as well as very thick.  I don't remember if I wrote this part as well, but I usually drain the 2 cans of beans, and I leave the liquid of the rem. cans. Luckily not many have been effected by the mistake.  thanks again.

Excellent chili. 

Just a note to cooks who are worried about sodium intake. In response to previous posters, the liquid beans are canned in is very high in sodium. Canned beans should always be drained and rinsed for a healthier meal.

I understand that this says "spicy" in the description, but I think that's an understatement. I found this to be WAY too spicy. I think that the spiciness overshadowed the other flavors. I served this to my family and no one was able to make it past 1/5 of the bowl, including myself, because it was just too spicy. It would be good if you cut out 90% of the chili powder & used 1 or less Jalapeno.

I LOVED this recipe!  I did find however that I had to almost double the amount of chili powder and cumin.  Just kind of taste and add till you get it where you really love it.  I used Original Boca Burgers that I broke up into little pieces, and like so many other reviewers, no one could tell it wasn't meat! It is, however, very important to break the Boca Burgers up into tiny pieces, otherwise, if you leave big chunks I think you can taste a little difference.  This does make a huge amount.  I think it would easily feed 10 or 12....especially if you were to put it over rice and serve with maybe some grated cheddar, sour cream and chopped avacados.....chopped onions would be good too!!

This is a great recipe. I added 1 zuchini, 1 red bell pepper, 1 can pinto beans, 1 bag of frozen corn (we like it better than canned), and 1 can tomato paste (I drained my beans and added water; plus I like a tomato based chili). I also added a few splashes of tobasco sauce, I think my chili powder must have been milder than others because we did not have enough spice. I reccommend using the whole stewed tomatoes because they have a thicker consistency. You can use your kitchen scissors and cut them up while they are still in the can. I think I will add a can of white beans next time. There really is a lot of the veggie meat and I like a fair amount of beans. I froze the chili in individual containers and made corn bread muffins and froze those too. We were able to have several chili/muffin lunches.
Thanks for the great recipe Cal :)

I was a little confused - ground oregano or leaf? (I ended up using the latter, because I had more of it.) Couldn't much drain the chile peppers, and I wondered whether to drain the beans (don't). 

Turned out very well, beautiful, though I might use a little less chili powder next time (and I used a skimpy 1/4 cup). Also used only 1 jalepeno - it was plenty spicy tonight, and will be spicier tomorrow. I used about a teaspoon of salt instead of a tablespoon and it was enough.

Modifying review to add my experience cooking it in a slow cooker... I prepared the veggies (onion, garlic, green pepper, celery) as instructed, and then transferred them to the slow cooker before throwing in the rest of the ingredients except for the corn. I cooked on high for a couple hours and added the corn about an hour before the end and turned my cooker down to low at the same time (about 3 hours in the slow cooker in all). It turned out brilliantly. I was worried the veggie crumbles might get rubbery, but they did not, and the spices were mellower but still very tasty. Huge hit at the office, even though they are all meateaters.

This recipe tempts me to never buy canned chili again! My whole family enjoyed this one and the leftovers have proved tastier than the first bowl.  I did make a few adjustments.  I used only one jalapeno and added salt to taste rather than the entire tablespoon all at once.  I'd guess I used about half a tablespoon.  I used canned crushed tomatoes in place of the fresh ones (a 28 oz can I think) and added an extra can of beans since I had some on hand.  I cheated and used ground turkey in place of the veggie crumbles and I let the whole thing sit on the burner over low heat for about two hours instead of the 45 mins.  The result was amazing!  This is awesome chili, I can't wait to make it again...thanks!

What great chili for a snowy day in Wisconsin!  Loved this a lot. Made as is except drained and rinsed all the beans to make them less salty and then added a bit of water. Thanks for sharing this yummy, healthy recipe.

I really liked it, I use Gardenburger brand hamburger crumbles and make some changes.  I omit the onion & jalapeno, and add mushrooms and 4 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce - minced. I always rinse beans, the liquid from the cans is nasty to me, I'd rather use water.  This is definitely the best Chili I've ever had.  We ate it with sour cream and Frito's. MMMMM.

I made this tonight when non-vegetarian friends came over. (I've been a vegetarian for 17 years). We all enjoyed it very much!!! 

I took the seeds out of the jalapeno because my friends don't like things too hot. It was nice like that - not too hot but not too mild either. However, if you like it hot by all means keep the seeds in. :)

Also, this is amazing coupled with the Cornbread Muffins 1 recipe. The cornbread is on the sweet side which is just yummy paired with the spiciness of this chili.

Finally, since I've tried a lot of imitation meat over the years, keep in mind that the comments over this being too salty might be because of the brand of "meat" they are using. Some are saltier than others. I used Boca and felt it was not too salty, but Boca tends to be a bit blander than Morning Star Farms in my opinion.

To sum it all up, this is filling, delicious, and enjoyable to vegetarians and meat eaters alike!

*********UPDATE***************
I made this again with Morningstar Farms Crumbles and my chili came out SUPER salty! If you use these crumbles **do not** add the additional salt!!! I did everything else the same, and it really is the different brands of crumbles that make this perfect or too salty.

Awesome chili!! I added lots of red Quinoa instead of burger crumbles for a complete protein. San Marzano imported tomatoes as well!

We made this last night pretty much as written and it really was amazing! My local grocer was out of jalapeno peppers but I found some preserved in jars and used those. I only made one true change and that was to add a couple of tablespoons of dark organic ground coco to tie the spices and the "heat" together. A friend of mine showed me this trick and I loved it so much I add it almost every time I cook chili. 

A word of advice for those who are concerned with the heat of this dish: it is really important to let it simmer for the full 45 minutes or maybe even a bit more. I always find that slow cooking ties in the flavours and takes the edge off the heat.

This recipe is definitely a KEEPER! I made this today for my office Halloween potluck, made it in the slow cooker too. I did make just a couple of tweaks to the recipe (additions really), I added 2 cups of chopped baby carrots, cut the salt back to 1 tsp (definitely does not need anymore than that), drained, rinsed and drained again the garbanzos, kidney and black beans thoroughly (waaaay too much sodium listed on the cans), used 1 red pepper and 1 green pepper, added another stalk of celery and used some pickled jalapeno peppers as that was all I had on hand. After adding the 3 cans of tomatoes, and stirring everything together, it was a bit too thick so I added about 8 ounces of vegetable broth. I left out the TVP as with all the other vegetables in it - it doesn't need it. It is simmering now in the crockpot, will add the corn just before serving.  On my initial taste tests... it is definitely OUTSTANDING! Thanks for the recipe calead910! awesome stuff!

We absolutely love this recipe.  I always change or add a few things in most recipes I follow.  For example, in this one I use red, orange and green bell peppers(I love colorful meals). I also add chopped fresh mushrooms for added super nutrients and texture.  I exchange all ingredients possible for fresh rather than canned. I also elimiante the veggie burger crumbles as American soy does not agree with my digestive system.  But I add 1/2 cup of quinoa for added protien and texture in its place.  My kids love this recipe more than turkey or traditional chilis.  Even my carnivoris husband loves it.  We have shared it with other families and they have been shocked after enjoying some that there is no meat in it.  Its definately NOT too spicy for all my kids who started enjoying it at ages ranging from 2 - 9, one of whom does not like ANYTHING very spicy.  My husband adds tobasco to his for some added kick.  This is a GREAT healthy recipe thats a CROWD PLEASER for herbivors, onmivores and carnivors alike! I always double this recipe so we can enjoy the leftovers. WE LOVE IT!  Thank you calead910 for sharing it!

I don't usually write reviews when I alter a recipe considerably.  I'm doing it for this one because the ingredients I used were mostly the same, I just used dried beans instead.  I did add a few extras and subbed the crumbles with brown rice due to what I had on hand.  I made 8 qts. for freezing and upped the heat level due to preference.

I used 1c each of (dried) black beans, garbanzo, pinto, and northern beans.  I did a fast soak. While the beans were soaking, I made a veggie stock from the ends of onions, celery, and carrots that I freeze from other meals, along with 6 red chiles.  Strain the stock when it's ready.  

When the beans were done soaking I strained and rinsed them, and added them to the stock.  I added the bay leaves and 2 dried, whole Ancho peppers (remove these with the bay leaves at end).  I sauteed the onions, celery, bell peppers (only had colored bells), and garlic before I added it in.  Then I sauteed the jalapenos quickly with about a half cup of finely chopped cilantro.  I added the other seasonings to the jalapenos to wake them up for about 30 secs, then added to chili.  I doubled all seasonings, and added 1tsp of smoked paprika.  Brought to a boil, then simmered for an 1hr 30 mins.

I subbed 2c dried brown rice, and let it simmer 30 mins more. 

All other ingredients were the same, it's super yummy.   If you try this add salt as you go since the beans aren't canned.  Hope my changes help someone who wants to try it with dried beans.

Great base recipe. I usually grill & freeze a bunch of jalapenos, garlic, and tomatoes, and keep them in ziplock bags. This was the perfect time to use some.  So, I had that substitution plus 2 carrots and a tsp of cinnamon to give it a slight sweetness.  I did use fresh soaked beans instead of canned, and I simmered the chili for 2 1/2 hours---adding the corn in the last 15 minutes.  Didn't have crumbles, but it was delicious with shredded cheese sprinkled on top and served with sweet corn bread muffins. NOTE: If you use dried beans and cook in a slow-cooker, be sure to soak them and make sure they are cooked through before adding the sauce; otherwise, tomatoes and the acidity of the sauce will harden the beans.

Spicy!  Overall, this is a good chili recipe that allows the cook a lot of flexibility to add different vegetables or leave them out, depending on what's on hand in the kitchen.  I agreed with other users in that it makes a LOT of chili, which can be frozen and reheated for lunches and dinners yet to come.

Do pay attention to the ingredient list, however, when it specifies to "drain" a can.  Not all of the cans of beans and vegetables are supposed to be drained, you won't have enough liquid in the chili if you do drain them.  If you drain them to get rid of the sodium, replace the drained fluid with water.

For a meat-eater like myself, I tend to steer clear of chilis without beef or sausage, but this beautiful & hearty chili turned out to be really delicious! Decided to try this recipe for the Hubster's office potluck and we were very happy with the results. We used only 1 package of veggie crumbles but it was still plenty. Followed step 1 in the directions, then put everything in the slow cooker on low for 6 hours overnight. We could only fit four (14.5 oz) cans of diced tomatoes after everything was in the crockpot, so that's the amount we used. There was JUST barely enough space to add the corn in the morning & the end result was a perfect chili consistency. I always "salt-to-taste" near the end of cooking when using canned items, so I recommend that. I ended up using about 1 1/2 tsp salt. This makes a ton of chili! Thanks for the great recipe! :)

I would have to agree with the title of this recipe! It truly is the best.  I made a few tweaks based on my lack of time, and sautéed onions, green peppers, and garlic. Then, I put everything in the slow cooker and set it on low for 4 hours.  I also added zucchini, and frozen okra. It was perfect!  Thank you for a fabulous recipe!

I used this recipe as a base for a chili competition and it TIED for first place! Here are my suggestions:

I doubled the extra virgin olive oil, cumin, celery stalks, and chili powder. 

I added a yellow bell pepper, 1 1/2 teaspoon coriander, about 3 Tablespoons brown sugar (to taste), 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes.

I only used 1 jalapeno pepper.

I didn't use garbanzo beans or black beans, salt, or ground black pepper.

I altered the tomatoes. I used 4 (14.5 oz) cans of Hunts Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes (2 original, 2 garlic). For the corn and beans- I bought cans that said "no salt added".

Don't forget to taste test throughout and to remove the bay leaves- which may be confusing for someone who has never cooked with them before.

You'll love this recipe!

This is the best vegetarian chili ever!  If you are trying to decide which veg. chili on here to make, I highly suggest this one.  I can't even believe that it got any bad reviews!  A dollop of sour cream, some cheddar cheese, and some hearty tortilla chips is the perfect addition and also would help for those who thought the heat was too much.  My family loves this recipe!

I don't understand why people complain that this recipe is too spicy.  Obviously with 2 cans of green chilies, 2 jalapenos, and 1/4 c of chili powder it's going to be rather spicy.  Just think before you add ingredients folks.  I don't like super spicy food so I always omit the cans of chilies when I make this and it's just fine.  I give the recipe 4 stars because I never have exactly followed it, but it really does give you a good starting point for a fine veggie chili.

My goodness this is delicious. I prefer it over the other chili recipes I've tried on this site. My tip is don't worry about crumbling the veggie burgers. Just chop them up into pieces with knife. They get broken apart by the heat and it's a lot quicker to use a knife.

I would definitely make this regularly. My omni hubby and mother-in-law could not get enough of it! When making the chili, I only had one bag of veggie crumbles (TVP), so I used half a link of Melissa's brand Soyrizo  ( sold in the produce department next to tofus and soy cheeses). I simply sauteed it for a little while in a seperate skillet and then added it in while the chili was simmering. For those you who claim it was too spicy: When prepping the jalapeno's remove all seeds and remove as much of the whitish 'ribs' (or membrane) surrounding the seeds as you wish. It will have that mildly spicy but pepper-y flavor without all the heat. All of the cans of beans were rinsed and drained before dumping into the pot. I don't care for the thick, starchy liquid that coats them. It has most of the preservatives and sodium. Not to mention, it gives the beans a funky taste and odor. The beans taste cleaner and fresher after being rinsed IMO. I thought there were more than enough beans so I also decided to save the black beans for tostadas or tacos. Oh, and another thing- go easy on the salt. I wished I hadn't added the entire tablespoon as I was taste-testing it. You can always add to your taste, but you can't take it out. I heard adding starchy root veggies like potato, carrot or parsnip will help absorb some of the salt, but I didn't bother. 4 stars =)

Way too hot.  Can't taste anything except "heat."  Unless you like your nose and throat burned with the smell of peppers, don't bother.  What a waste of expensive ingredients.

I cut this down a bit and we will still get 2 meals out of it (for 2 people). Used 1 pkg burger crumbles, 2 cans tomatoes, and only 1 each of jalapenos and can of green chiles. Also cut down the chili powder to 2 tbsp, and it was still nearly too hot for me (but just right for teen who likes hot foods). I also added diced zucchini, which worked very well with the other flavors. My total cost including a loaf of French bread was $18.50 since I already had the spices. Excellent food, good value for 2 meals. Thanks for posting this! .

I found this recipe to be average fare with a deceiving name. I enjoyed it well enough but thought it was nothing to write home about. When considering the long list of ingredients and prep time I will look for another recipe next time I want some good veggie chilli. I was surprised so many people complained about the heat and would like to remind anyone attempting this recipe to remove the seeds from the jalepenos when using and you'll be fine. I agree with many others that it could use more cumin.

This recipe truly lives up to it's title. I've made a zillion vegetarian chilis (it seems) and none were quite right until this one. The only modification I made was to add two cans of tomatoe soup (no water) and leave out one jalapeno pepper. I got rave reviews. This is one to save

This chili is delicious! I de-seeded the jalapenos to cut down the spice factor, which seemed to work really well for a mild to medium heat. I drained all of the beans and corn and used 28 oz cans of crushed tomatoes since I didn't see the original cook's note on here about hand-crushing the whole peeled tomatoes. It turned out to be a thick, hearty chili that you can eat by the spoonful or wrap up in a tortilla. Yum!

This recipe is perfect!  Not a single thing needs to be changed.  It always gets rave reviews when I make it and I have shared it a number of times.  It fits just right in my big pot and the left overs freeze beautifully so it can be enjoyed again later.  I highly recommend!

only used one jalepeno pepper and still very spicy, but very good!  substituted peas for corn, and turkey instead of soy meat because of diet restrictions and was, seriously, the best chili ever.

definatly a keeper.  i cooked in the crock pot as well (3 hours on low then 1 hour on high w/ half can of water).  the only thing i changed was a can of diced tomatoes for 3 fresh ones, and only 1 jalepeno pepper instead of 2.  it was GREAT!  will be making again next week.  thanks for this recipe!

A co-worker asked me to enter a Meatless Monday chili cook-off because I'm vegan so she knew I would have no reservations about making a meatless recipe. I found this recipe and changed it in the following ways:
3 T olive oil; 
4 cloves garlic; 
1.5 T chili pepper; 
frozen corn instead of canned; 
Additional ingredients:
1/2 T chipotle chili powder; 
1/2 T cayenne pepper

...and I won the whole contest! There were 15 entries, and I won 1st place from the 6 official judges AND people's choice as voted by the attendees (over 50 people). Try this recipe-- especially with the changes noted above-- and you will not be disappointed!!

Tried it and made three substitutions.  Poblano peppers for the jalapeno peppers; Longhots (fried/jarred cayenne peppers (by Mancini) for the canned chili peppers and pinto for kidney beans.  Used organic vegetables and veggie crumbles.  This receipe is actually vegan.  Topped with vegan jack "cheese".  Won first place for "Best Non-Traditional Style" chili and 1st Place "Best Chili Overall" in the church Chili Cookoff today (November 17th).  It really is good stuff.  The two chili substitutions result in a smooth heat that everyone seemed to enjoy.  Judges were unanimous.  Great receipe!  No picture - it's all gone - every last bit.

This is amazing chili! My boyfriend claims it is the best chili he has ever eaten. I only gave it four stars based on the spiciness... although I left out the jalepenos completely, only used one can of green chile peppers, and reduced the chili powder to about seventy five percent of a 1/4 cup, my mouth was still on fire. I know its because I am sensitive to heat, but I cannot even imagine the full spiciness of this recipe. Other than that, it is a great vegetarian option, and I even left out the burger crumbles (adding another can of beans in its place)- turned out great!

I was concerned my family wouldn't like the heat, so I reduced the chili powder and Jalapeno by half.  It came out mildly spicy and not too hot. The chili was on the watery side even though I drained the cans as directed.  I also drained the canned tomatoes, even though the directions didn't say to do so. I should have drained the excess water that came out of the tomatoes when I crushed them. After cooking I drained the watery part of the chili, thickened it up with some corn starch and added approximately one tablespoon of sugar.  The sugar seems to cut down on the acidity of the tomatoes.  This helped the flavor a great deal in my opinion.  In the end my family and I were very happy with the dish.  The flavor seemed even better the second night.  I will likely make it again, perhaps using the slow cooker instead.

I wouldn't say it's the most amazing chili I've ever had, but it is definitely a keeper.  It's packed with a ton of stuff to make it a really healthy meal.  I added an extra tablespoon chili powder, but that was the only change to the recipe that I made.

I thought this was a great recipe too. It was very flavorful with a kick. I did not use any salt and you did not need it. I also rinsed the beans and corn to reduce sodium as well. You could not notice any difference.  I would make it w/o the salt!

This recipe needs major adjustments to be the "best in the world," but it has potential.   The author is on the right track with the ingredients (the mix of vegetables and the types of spices etc.), but the amount of chili it makes is more like 10 to 12 servings (too much for the average person's needs unless you're cooking for a large group) and the amounts of the spices were excessive (1 tablespoon salt and 1/4 cup chili powder are way too much in my opinion, so I cut those significantly--I used 1/2 teaspoon for the salt and 1 tablespoon chili powder).  I made adjustments for my needs by cutting the ingredients for the chili in half (as I was only cooking for 2), omitted the jalapenos (if I do add them in the future, I will only add 1 and omit the canned green chilies and will make sure to seed it as with the seeds the chili would be too spicy for me or my household), and I washed and drained the beans (to reduce the sodium content).  I sprinkled the chili with grated cheddar cheese and served it with the Homesteader Cornbread on this site and it made a great meal for a cold, rainy evening!  This recipe is a good place to start and I will use this as a base in the future!

What I found that worked for me for that harder texture chunk feel (to replace meat) was hominy.  I make some milder for the Grand daughter, and then fire up the rest for the rest of us!

This is a really great veggie chili! My boyfriend and I  both loved it and he's raved to others about it. I've made it a couple times now. Great to store in the freezer too.

OMG, this is THE best veggie/vegetarian chili in the world.  I made some adjustments, I only used pinto, white kidney and light red kidney beans, not a fan of black bean in chili.  I added a turnip, 2 carrots and used fresh tomatoes and half of a small can tomatoe sauce.  I also only used 1 bag of the veggie crumble.  After the simmer, which for me was only 20 instead of 40mns, I added 2 chopped chives(green onions) and fresh parsley.....It is amazing.  I am eating it, as I write, with basmati white rice on the side and avocado....oh and a glass of sauvignon blanc......Thank you so much for this recipe

SO disappointed!  I followed this recipe to the letter and at the moment I held the tablespoon of salt over the pot I thought "this can't be right!"  So I checked again.  1 Tablespoon Salt.  The dish was inedible.  I even drained off all the liquid and added more tomatoes hoping to dilute the saltiness.  No luck.  Bummer.

I love this recipe. I've made it several times and even meat eaters fall in love with it. If it's too hot cut down on the jalepeno not the chili powder. I omit the "beef" crumbles and add portobello mushrooms. They add such a meaty texture and flavor. Sooooo good!

WOW! This was awesome! I love chili and I love veggies but most veggie chili recipes lack the heartiness and substance of the meat varieties ...this recipe was definitely an exception!!! Easy, delicious and very satisfying!!

I freaking LOVE this recipe! I've made it about six times now, and there are a few things I tweak. I use mushrooms, more tomatoes, and fewer cans of beans. I also add another bay leaf in there. Amazing with extra sharp cheddar and avocado slices on top. Ugh.

I was looking for something to have during our fasting period at church and I came across this recipe.  All I can say is WOW!!! This was a hearty, meaty and bold favor chili without the meat.  I would put this chili up against those with meat.  The veggies and the crumbles really set this chili off. Highly recommend making this if you wanna by pass the meat. I will be making this again and soon!

I would not make this again.  I'm shocked so many reviewers find this spicy.  I was adding cayenne pepper to up the spice level.  I used mild green chiles, jalapeno, and regular chili powder, maybe that's why?  Chili powder is not spicy, cayenne is. I didn't find this chili flavorful enough, spicy or not.  I feel like I should have doubled the spices.  Also, not a fan of adding fake/processed meat when there's already plenty of protein in here.

This was fantastic!  I've made it twice, w/ a few substitutions the second time and both times it got rave reviews!  The second batch I left out the jalapenos and it still had plenty of heat.  I also only used half the salt and only one 28oz can of tomatoes; I added a spoonful of sugar and a tiny spoonful of cinnamon and cooked it in the crockpot on low for about 6 hours.  This is now the only chili recipe in my recipe box!

Awesome chili -- relatively easy to prepare, tons of leftovers that you can freeze and thaw (which taste just as good as the first time), and common ingredients.  Due to indigestion issues within my family, I had to adapt the recipe for a little milder taste.  I used just one jalapeno, and one can of green chiles.  It tastes great but without the strong kick afterwards.  Still a chili to clear the sinuses!  YUM!  Thanks Calead910 for sharing!  (P.S. I've noticed that some people are having a hard time finding garbanzo beans... They're also known as chick-peas.)

One of the most delicious vegetarian chili recipes I've tried.  I did, however, use garlic powder because I did not have fresh on hand.  I used one green pepper and half the amount of veggie protein and added a little fresh cilantro.  We cut the chili powder in half as well, and it lent the perfect amount of spice. I topped this with veggie cheese shreds and sliced green onions. Very flavorful and hearty chili.

I really enjoyed this chili as did my family. I had to omit the chili peppers and the jalepenos, but the black pepper and the chili powder did a great job giving it some kick. I will definitely make this again.

Yes, I have made this recipe several times for my wife's marathon & half marathon running program and get rave reviews and requests for more! I do tinker with it, as I cut back on some items (especially the "hots" as many do not like it too spicy), and add something else in lieu. Do not use as much of the crumbles, too expensive for 75-100 servings.

Really very good.  I liked it because it tasted complete, not just "regular" chili with the meat missing.  The play of different textures and flavors was nice.  I topped it with avocado cream.  I also modified it  by using tempeh instead of fake meat (a good choice!) and only two cans of tomatoes- which I pureed first to make a smoother base- and a bit of vegetable broth.  Missing star because it wasn't very spicy, and I think 3 cans of tomatoes would make it way to acidic.  Next time I will add more jalepenos- at least 4- and some liquid smoke. Also probably will leave out the celery or dice it super small- kind of didn't fit with the dish.  But overall this was a very pleasing vegan dinner.  Which is good because we have enough left overs to last for a whole week!

Made this for the second time. Didn't rate it the first time b/c I accidentally purchased crushed tomatoes with basil and it completely ruined an entire pot of chili. This time, it was delicious! Made just a few changes. Omitted the 2nd green pepper, the meatless crumbles, the can of corn and the cumin. Used one can of regular chili peppers and one can of hot chili peppers. This was pretty spicy. I had to add a big dollop of sour cream to my bowl to tone it down a notch. Husband loves spicy so he thought it was perfect. I didn't make it on the stove but put it in the crock pot on LOW for 6 hours. It was probably up there with the best chili ever. Don't think the meat crumbles are necessary at all. It's still very hearty and filling without them.

Great  Flavor combination!  If making for people who don't like it too hot.  Used 1/2 anaheim chili, 1 T chili powder, 1 can diced chilies. Used 2 28 oz and 1 14 oz cans tomatoes. Added 2 zuchinni squash, 2 yellow crook neck squash.  Would be great over wild/brown rice!
Made above changes, otherwise would be a little spicy for some in my extended family.
I eliminated the beef crumbles, as I prefer just the vegies.  I think the squash made up for the volume.  Made a huge pot.

Whole family loved it, enough for leftovers.  Made with less Jalapeno's but spicy enough for our family.  Hopefully will freeze well.  Will update.
Froze great, nothing was mushy - have made again!

Outstanding base chili recipe.  Substitute cans of "Crushed" tomatoes instead of the "Whole Peeled" that it calls for if you like a more brunswick stew consistency or have kids that don't like "Chunks" of tomatoes.  Also substituted white northern beans for the kidney beans and left out the garbanzo beans.  Left out a little of the chili powder (probably between and 1/8 and 1/4 of cup) to reduce the spicyness and it was perfect, still spicy but not too powerful.  Loved it and will make many times in future.

Both my husband and I LOVE this recipe it's the best chili we've had (meatless or veggie) and the only thing we added were some mushrooms the second time around.  Nice and spicy!  We left the juice of the tomatoes but drained and rinsed the beans.

This sounds yummy.  I have a recipe that is very similar, and we make it regularly...I'll definitely put this into my recipe box and make it soon!  Thanks for adding more vegetarian recipes (vegetarian as in no chicken stock or fish or whatever that came from meat!).

I made this on Christmas Day.  It was fantastic.  The family couldn't tell that it was vegetarian until they saw me eating it.  Such a hit, my husband asked me to make it again tonight.  I added an extra pepper.  Very good....

I omited the cumin, celery and onions. I used tomatoes stewed in green peppers, onions, and celery for more flavor. I only used 1 jalapeno pepper and added some dried basil. I drained and rinsed the beans and corn. Turned out pretty good.

I made this chili today and it was awesome.  We ate ours out dogs and shredded cheese in the bowl.  Did I say delicious.  This is the recipe I will continue to use.  The only changes I made were i only used 1 jalapeno pepper and one red pepper instead of 2 green peppers, and no vegetable crumbles. I also used 3 cans of diced chili style tomatoes and 3 cans of whole peeled tomatoes just to mix it up.

Awesome recipe! I put this all in a crockpot on low for 6hrs and won a chili cook-off! Thanks for the great recipe!!!   Tip: Always Always drain the cans of beans to reduce sodium, add water if you need to!

Holly  ! If you want to play a bad joke on someone, cook them this intense Chili recipe ! My girlfriend and i were surfing the net for a vegetarian chili recipe and found this one. My girlfriend was doing her exercise while this recipe was on the stove so i thought i'd cheat and taste it immediately just to see...and POW ! my tongue was on fire ! AAaaaAAAAaaAAAaaaaaaaAaa help me GOD ! WATER I NEED WATER !! My girlfriend came out of her room and tasted it herself and same reaction: AAAaaaaaAAAAAAAA !!! WATTTTTERRRR !!!

So this recipe is worth 5-star for the spice but a 1-star because you can't really eat this. There's no way anybody can eat this, even if you like spice !

My husband had 5 men from India come over, of which 2 are vegetarians. Found this recipe and thought I'd give it a try since they love cumin, chile and jalapeno peppers. They have had a hard time finding food here they like. I made this and their eyes lit up. They loved it! I asked what they would change and they said, Nothing it's perfect. One said he will take the recipe back to his wife. It's spicy hot but so flavorful. I had to add a little more olive oil at the beginning. I was confused at first because it starts out like a paste when cooking. If you don't like very spicy food you will want to cut down the chile and jalapeno peppers in half. You could also cut down on the chili powder.

Outstanding recipe, for sure.  Here are some of the amendments I would make: I added two sliced carrots to give it a bit more thickness and consistency.  I agree with others who say that a full 1/4 cup of chili powder is not necessary.  And 2 jalepenos would make this super spicy -- 1 was sufficient for me.  I also used 1 red and 1 green pepper.  Finally, unless you like your chili watery, I would drain the beans before throwing them in.  

I just made it again tonight and used a sprinkle of cinnamon to give it the flavor some nuance.

Otherwise, a great recipe!!

phenomenal!! My boyfriend and i decided to go vegetarian for a month to see how we liked it, and this recipe is by far the best one I have made so far in our experiment. Better even than anything I have had with real meat!! I made only small adjustments: I halfed the recipe based on other user reviews saying how MUCH this made but still used a full can of all the beans. I also useed a red bell pepper, an orange one and a green one. It gives it an appealing color and I love bell peppers in general. I lined the bottom of our bowls with tortilla strips and topped it with a dollop of sour cream and some sharp cheddar with a sprig of cilantro. Thanks for the fabulous recipe, we will be enjoying this one for a long time!!

This recipe is absolutely sensational! Easy Easy Easy (which happens to be extremely important given my aversion to cooking and minimal expertise). One thing we do to make this terrific chili as pleasing to the eye as it is to the palate is to use an assortment of peppers (one in every color). Do yourself a favor...Make this...Enjoy it. It will be in permanent heavy rotation...

OK, so I have made this chili twice in the last two weeks and it is by far the best veggie chili I have ever come across. The heat is just right and is working on many levels (bright heat up front from the jalapenos, slow burn from the abundance of chili powder).

I am a dedicated meat-i-vore, but now I have a chili that both me and my veggie friends can share. Thank you!

I had reservations about this recipe after my first atttempt.  I never follow recipes exactly and made the first batch using more beans and italian recipe stewed tomatoes and less chili powder and jalepeno so that my kids might eat it.  It was decent and was finished within a few days, but nothing spectacular.  I made the next batch in a crock pot in the same manner and it came out just a bit better.  The third time I made it with a large jalepeno and the full amount of chili powder called for and brought it to a barbeque.  I tasted it prior to going and it was WAY BETTER than the first two tries.  It never draws raves, but it always gets eaten, and the barbeque was no exception.  We only stayed a short time and the entire batch was eaten in that time.  Adding the full amount of spices is very important and doesn't really increase the heat that much, just intensifies the flavor.  My vegetable hating father-in-law askes us to bring him this dish all the time.

My changes to the recipe are here:

1/2 the recipe, but add full cans of corn and beans instead of half cans, stewed italian recipe toms instead of diced, and stir in a large handful of crushed corn tortilla chips when serving for really good flavor and texture.  I cook the vegetables as directed, then dump it all into a crock pot and forget about it until dinner time.  We eat this at least 3 times a month, usually more.

I am really surprised this received such high ratings. It did not have that "chili" taste that I was expecting and it was way too spicy for the average joe (I did not add all of the chili powder, but I did add all of the jalepenos). I served it with cheese, sour cream and fritos. With plenty of that is was okay, but I was really disappointed. Won't be making this again.

This is very tasty, hearty recipe for New England's winter days!! We do not eat TVP, so I added couple of boiled and mashed potatoes instead. I skipped Jalapeneo for the sake of kids, and added some chilli sauce in our bowls. This will be a staple healthy winter dinner at our home. Thanks for sharing.

I LOVE this!!! It was too thick and not hot enough for me. I added a can of spicy hot V8, one red pepper, used hot chili seasoning, hot chili beans, extra jalapinos, and cayenne pepper. Kept everything else as listed. Its the best chili I ever had

So good! I like spicy food alot but was worried about the spiciness of this dish with everything but it was smooth, as someone else said. I made all 8 servings because I forgot to change the servings but more for later! I also only used one bag of vegi crumbles (which by it's self was really enough) then added smoked tofu per the boyfriends request and fresh corn instead of canned. SOOO GOOD!

I made this chili for Thanksgiving in lieu of turkey, and it went over really well.  I followed other posters' advice to use only 1 jalapeno.  I also skipped the canned jalapenos.  I also used pinto beans instead of garbanzo.  I used the liquid from 2 of the cans of beans, and drained away the other cans' liquid.  It was easy to make, turned out beautifully, and everyone raved over it.

This recipe is great because it is fast, nutricious and you can mix up the ingredients.  I used 1 can of small diced tomatoes and a small can of tomato sauce.  Pinto instead of kidney beans.  Frozen corn kernels work great in this.

Very yummy - I ended up using ground turkey instead of the veggie crumbles.  It was a bit salty, I wish I had waited to add the tbsp of salt first.  But the spice level was very pleasant.  I would definitely make it again!

I made this last Thursday and ate it again as leftovers on Friday. WOW this is AMAZING!! It's really great, so very easy and even tastes better the second day as the spices permeate the chili. If you don't like it too spicy, just leave out the jalapenos. I personally really loved how spicy it was. I served it with French bread and butter. I will certainly make this again! My husband didn't even miss the meat!

This is amazing! I think you could make it with meat, but I think the Boca makes it better because it is also preseasoned. This was even better a day later when it had time to sit and marinate. I was suspicious of the garbonzo beans (because I hate them) but keep them in....YUMMMM. Maybe add a bit more corn, if you like corn. It added to the consistancy and gave it an unexpected yummy crunch! This recipe ROCKS!

We all LOVED this chili.  It's the best veggie chili I've ever had, and as a vegetarian, I've tried a whole lot of them.  I like spicy hot foods (but also enjoy more flavorful foods that are less hot), my husband likes mild-medium, and our neighbor likes mild.  We were all three happy with this recipe.  I used the two fresh jalapenos, but made sure to use only mild diced chiles in the cans.

This recipe is amazing. In fact it tasted better than my husband's family recipe.  No one knew it was vegan with the soy burger crumbles.  Wow!  I cut back the heat from 2 jalapeños to 1/2 jalapeño.  Cooking it a little longer dispersed the heat throughout the chili as well.  Served with homemade whole wheat garlic knots.  Thanks for this keeper!!!

Modified this a little. Only used 2 large cans of crushed tomatoes & one jalapeño. And also substituted one can of kidney beans, one can of pinto beans & one can of black beans. Left out the corn as I can't eat it, but this chili rocks! Spicy, hearty & delicious.

This is the best chili ever!  It also is the best vegan recipe we've ever encountered.  I stacked-up veggie patties ad cut them into 1/4-inch squares.  Everyone thought they were hamburg.  My 17-year old daughter took this to high school for lunch today and said it was great cold.  Her friend, who often brings his dad's chili for lunch, said this was better.  We will eat this again and again.

I could eat this everyday!  Great for a crowd and the non-vegges don't even know it is meatless unless you tell them.  I add lots of extra vegitables to bulk it up - zuchnni, carrots, peppers, etc.

Delish. :) Can't even tell it has no meat. I didn't have bay leaves nor cumin. I also didn't use green chile peppers or the vegetarian burger crumbles. It turned out super yummy. & MY toddler's loved it!

This is the best...  I left out the celery and bell pepper and not even my son could tell it was vegetarian.  It was also great on top of baked potatoes with melted cheese and diced avocados.  Yummy!!!

HUGE hit! Brought to potluck, great amount. Only thoughts are that whole tomatoes are a little unwieldy, so I think I'll use diced in the future, and the other thing was pinto beans worked fine. Also, I had a sundried tomato-vegetarian-sausage that I added which was delicious!

This is a great veggie chili. 

I did a few things differently, and haven't served it yet, but it's already worth writing-up.

While I was sauteeing the veggies, I started heating tomatoes and beans in a slow cooker. I added the veg to the slow cooker, and it's been cooking on Low overnight.

I used Muir Glen fire-roasted tomatoes, instead of plain.

I added 4 oz. of Chipotle Chiles in Adobo Sauce (Embasa brand, which is less vinegary than others), and 4 tsp of Brown Sugar.

I also used only 1 Orange Bell Pepper (instead of 2 green), and only Black Beans instead of 3 Bean. (I dislike kidney beans, and find that green peppers quickly add a sour note that I don't like.)

Lastly, I replace the two jalapenos with 1 Serrano pepper and 3 Habanero (Scotch Bonnet) peppers, for a little extra kick.

Also, I haven't put in the veggie burger crumbles just yet, and hesitate to try, it's already so rich and well-balanced.

I expect to finish it with some Grafton Smoked Cheddar on the top, and sour cream or creme fraiche on the side.

To my palate, a fine, rich, full-bodied, smoky spin on a great, basic veggie chili.

It was good...but WAY too spicy. I was craving chili and couldn't wait to dive into a bowl of this and when I finally did, rather than my tastes buds being overwhelmed with joy they were immediately overwhelmed with heat. It was too much. At the end of my bowl I was sweating and my nose was running. Next time I will ONLY use 1/2 a jalapeño and that is it!

Pretty good, I would NOT say it is very spicy, but then again, I love habaneros.... and I ended up putting in about 5 of them to make it the heat level I enjoy. I left out the burger crumbles.

Made this today for a dinner with friends. So good! I would recommend cutting down to one jalapeno and one can of green chilis as I did that and it was still too spicy for some. Although the perfect amount of heat for spicy food lovers. Also I added chickpeas instead of corn, delicious!

I absolutely loved this. It was fantastic! I actually used ground turkey instead because I just loved all the beans and veggies in it. I like mine really spicy, so I added some cayenne pepper and hot sauce. So yummy! Thanks a million. I am making this for my second time tonight and the only thing I'm changing is I will use crushed tomatoes instead of whole. Delish!!

Great recipe! I've made this 3 times, pretty much following the recipe, and have received lots of compliments on it and requests for the recipe.It's just as good w/o the crumbles. I add a rounded tsp. of cinnamon or so which adds an additional depth of flavor.

My first attempt at chili and this recipe is a delicious one! I halved the recipe. Changes I made: added one red pepper, 1/2 onion, 2 stalks celery, some frozen okra, and increased all the seasonings. Used 2 cans goya dark kidney beans and 8 oz Boca meatless ground burger. Simmered my chili for around 1.5 hours. So delicious with shredded cheddar on top and a side of jalapeño corn bread! The name says it all  and this chili will please vegetarians and meat eaters alike.

This is a delicious, healthy meal. My husband is a chili fanatic - and he loves this. He adds extra hots, but this is just right for me the way it is. I replaced the garbanzo beans with navy beans as a personal preference. Then I crossed out the word "Vegetarian" and added ground turkey breast in place of the veggie crumbles, as we are carnivores in this house! Everyone who tries this wants the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I think this makes a lot more than 8 servings.  I made (and will in the future make) the following changes, but it's a really flexible recipe - it is chili, after all!:

Use a whole onion.  Nix celery and bay leaves.  Use chipotle peppers instead of jalapenos.  Nix green chili peppers.  Add chipotle chili pepper, cayenne pepper, cumin, and hot chili flakes.  Only really need 1 package of burger crumbles, 2 cans of beans.  Use frozen corn instead of canned (tastes fresher).  Use 1 28oz container of crushed tomatoes and 1 can of tomato sauce instead of whole tomatoes.

Just a tip, i couldn't find any black or garbanzo beans anywhere, so I used more kidney beans and some black eye beans.

By far the best recipe for vegetarian chili I've come across. It's become a regular for me, and I've made it several times. I like to make a big batch of the chili and then freeze individual portions - it freezes very well - and then I have several quick, homeade, delicious lunchs. I typically will just toss everything into my crockpot and let it simmer all day, that has worked well for me. The only changes I make are that don't used chickpeas, instead I just double either the black beans or kidney beans, or whatever other beans I have on hand, and then I also like to add about 12 ounces of tomato paste, simply because I like a tomato based chili. I can't say enough about how much I love this recipe!

I have been a vegan for about 12 years and thought this was a great recipe. I cooked my own beans without any seasonings and they took on the flavor of the chili beautifully.  I used a combination of black and kidney beans, 6 cups cooked. I also crumbled 4 boca burgers for the "meat", because that was all I had.  It is high in fiber, nutrients, and a good protein boost.  Thank you!

I made this chili tonight and I thought it was just as amazing as the other reviewers said.  It truely is the best vegeterian chili i have ever had, and I've had plenty!!  I also substituted a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes for the fresh tomatoes and did not use the can of green chile peppers.  I also used the liquid from all three cans of beans! This recipe was definatly a hit at my house and I cant wait to make it again!!

This turned out fantastic! I'm a "most of the time" vegan, and I made this while staying with my very un-vegan family. Everyone loved it, and loved the little bit of kick the spices provided. No one even missed the meat! I actually left out the veggie burger crumbles and used canned crushed tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes. I served it with vegan sour cream and corn chips. Yummy!I will make this again.

This recipe is fantastic. I have tried many vegetarian chilis, and they tend to end up too soupy or too bean-y--but not this one!  The only alterations I made were a) I used a whole onion instead of half and b) substituted diced tomatoes for one of the cans of crushed; otherwise I followed the recipe to a tee!  I fed this to my meat-a-saurus family, and they swore up and down it was made with ground turkey! My only "complaint" is that it definitely serves more than 8! I would guess it makes closer to about 20 servings!

So great and super healthy!  I used low sodium fire roasted tomatoes and also added spicy tomato juice for liquid and flavor. Adding carrots and zucchini made this a summer favorite at our house!

It turned out great! I followed everything exactly except I didn't have any black beans and I added frozen corn and mushrooms. Be careful when you bring it to a boil, I put it on med-high heat and it exploded a little because of its thickness. I added about a cup of water to thin it out a bit. Also when removing the membrane and seeds from a jalapeño, thoroughly wash your hands - it starts to burn a little.

Loved it! Great if you love spice. It makes a lot so we froze it and ate it a few times. Each time was just as great as the first!

LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED IT. To keep it from being to spicy cut the seeds out of the jalapeno peppers and throw them away or use them for something else. What ever you do don't put them in the chili. The only other tip is use all organic ingredients. Even with the stuff in cans go organic. You'll find that organic canned food has a much better flavor and even seems to be more filling. I'm changing the name to "The Best Vegetarian Chili in the Freak'n Universe".

I made this for our housewarming party and it was a huge success!  I was impressed how many people went out of their way to tell me how delicious it tasted.  I had to make enough for about 30 servings, instead of 8, and everything calculated out perfectly.  It was so easy to prep and was super yummy.  I highly recommend this recipe!  I will be making it as a side to our nacho bar this weekend for Super Bowl this weekend... GO HAWKS!!!

Great recipe!  Did not use the spicy ingredients but spiced it up with one red pepper and replaced 1 can of the peeled tomatoes with diced fire tomatoes with garlic 15 oz.

This is now my recipe for chili.  I am trying  to reduce my cholesterol and I think  this vegetarian recipe is a tasty way to do it. But more importantly, it is delicious!  I saw several comments about the spiciness of the recipe.  Chili powder can vary a great deal depending on freshness and brand.   I used 1/4 cup as the recipe called for and it was about right.  I used a little less salt and frozen corn instead of canned. Other than that, I made the recipe as described. This recipe makes  a lot and freezes well. You'll love it!

I'm a meat eater, but my girl friend is Vegan and I made this for us one night she came over for dinner. It's so good, I was impressed at the spice level and couldn't tell it wasn't real meat.  I highly recommend this chili for anybody - meateater, vegitarian or vegan.  Very good.  I'll be making this again.

Absolutely wonderful.  As with anything you can adjust to meet your own personal preferences.  I omitted the bay leaf, and the crumbles.  I am vegan, and gluten free, so it's hard and expensive to find the crumbles.  I also used a can of fire-roasted tomatoes in place of the can of crushed tomatoes.  It made it superb, IMO.  Luv me some garlic, and used double the amount ... I made the recipe for "4" and have enough for "8" and only used kidney and black beans.

This guy in my office who ONLY eats meat and potatoes said it looked delish. That says something!  Also, I was skeptical there was no broth. I promise, it turns out fine.

The first time I made this I backed off on the spices too much. The amount of chiles in the recipe gives nice heat, as I found out the next time. Unfortunately, 3 flavors overpowered the chili: salt, acidity (tomatoes) and chili powder. I saw a lot of potential with this recipe though. Second time around, I used one less can of tomatoes, used 19 oz cans of beans & corn to offset the tomatoes, and used less than 1 tsp of salt. Also, reduced the chili powder to 3 tbsp. Wow. Best chili that's ever come out of my kitchen. I think this is a great recipe to customize to your needs and taste.

First time I've worked with veggie crumbles - I was pleasantly surprised.  Might work with them more.  Pretty spicy for my taste -- but the husband will like it.  Mostly -- this is NOT 8 servings.  I had to switch pots -- used a 1/3 cup soup scoop 20 times -- and dumped another 2 cups into a bigger pot -- all BEFORE I put in the beans and corn.  If I make this again - I'm cutting it in half for my 2 person household.  Will kick out a can of beans and use one can tomato crushed along with one can whole.    Still - great recipe - it's a keeper.

Amazing chili!!! I made this for my boyfriends birthday dinner with his friends (who all eat meat) and everyone loved it, especially our 1 year old. I did make some changes since I didn't have some stuff, I used 2 extra cans of beans instead of fake meat, and I added a can of diced tomatoes, carrots, and used a 1/2 cup of chili powder instead of 1/4. Served with cornbread and Fritos. Love this chili!!!

Delish! Four stars because we left out some ingredients (cumin, bay leaves, veggie crumbles and about half the chili powder) and didn't have the entire recipe experience. Husband and I are on a Daniel Fast and this chili HIT THE SPOT. Made it last weekend and will be making it again, thanks!

I made this recipe as-is (but drained and rinsed all beans and drained the corn), and I must say that this recipe is the perfect vegetarian chili recipe! It's super fast to prepare and yields quite a bit of chili! I'm enjoying it right now, just after cooking, but I'm sure it will be even better tomorrow. This recipe is a keeper!

Really good.  Used one jalapeno and one can of mild green chilis to make a mild chili with a little kick. I used half the amount of soy crumbles and it was plenty.  I omitted the bay leaves as I didn't have any and also added more salt & a bit more cumin.  I might just use kidney and black beans next time as they are my favorites.

Wonderful! We made this chili over a campfire while camping out one fall and it turned out amazing. So easy to make, even over uneven heat. I did make a few changes to suit our tastes. Used ground turkey instead of veggie crumbles. I didn't have any bay leaves, only used one jalapeno, and only one can of beans as we actually ran out of room in the pot we took to cook in! It was pretty spicy but not too spicy for us. If you are sensitive I would recommend decreasing the amount of chili powder. Great recipe! As I am writing this I am planning on whipping up another batch of this for dinner tomorrow. Edit: I have made this several more times now and we still love it. I usually add more veggies like summer and zucchini squash instead of a couple cans of beans. Can't go wrong with the original recipe though so it gets five stars.

Wowza!  This is awesome chili.  I used vegetarian soy chorizo from Trader Joes in place of the burger crumbles.  One warning, I fried the japalenos in with the green pepper and ended up chocking everyone in the house.  Better to add with the tomatoes.  Used a can of hominy rather than regular corn.  It makes a huge batch!

Added pinto beans, and used my favorite veggie hamburgers made by Trader Joe's, which are spicy indian marsala. Pretty bomb, even for meat eaters.

This IS such a YUMMY recipe! We had it over baked potatoes topped off with a creamy chipotle sauce and avocados. This is going into the "will make again" category!!

Also It makes A LOT!! we froze the left overs for later!

Great recipe. My only suggestion is to deglaze the pan before you add the vegetables. I did not do this and the whole bottom of the pain burnt!

This is hands down the best chili recipe! I have made this repeatedly, and often I will add some extras like hominy instead of kidney beans (as those are my least favorite), a can of spicy pinto chili beans, chopped zucchini, bagged spinach, carrots, and extra onion. I also like without the burger crumbles, but when making for others, use ground turkey instead- which is fabulous. I add extra chili powder, a bit of cayenne for kick, and extra pepper. I serve along with homemade green chili corn bread- one of the best dishes for a cool, chilly night or a snowy one (we get a lot of those in Denver!).

I am a big meat eater that is trying to slowly convert to a vegetarian. I was looking for a few meals to make the transition easier. This chili was the answer to help me transition...it's awesome! I followed the recipe almost exactly except took a few others advice to drain/rinse the beans, instead of garbanzo used cannellini beans, reduced the jalepeno to 1, added 1 can tomato paste and omitted the bay leaves (I just don't care for taste of bay leaves). Excellent!

Made the chili for Good Friday and this recipe is a keeper! You can adjust to your liking, if you don't want it spicy leave out the chili and peppers. You can add what ever beans you like or leave out the corns if you don't like it. I also made the buttery corn bread that is on this site to go with the chili. Yummy.

I make this recipe all the time and LOVE it, but I am looking for how the calories and nutritional information was calculated.  How many ounces or cups is in one Serving of the 8 for the total original recipe?

I recently moved back in with my parents and wanted to show my appreciation by making them dinners on the days I have off of work.  They're die-hard meat eaters and I'm a vegetarian so I try really hard to find recipes that won't violate my ethics or their taste buds.  This one was an absolute hit!  The only modifications I made were adding a package of angel hair pasta like my Grandma Ruth used to do with her famous chili (cook separate and combine just before serving) and used fresh green chiles instead of canned.  

Thank you soooo much for this recipe!!!

I made this for dinner, and my family loved it.  My son is vegetarian, so I am always looking for good recipes.  Makes a lot so there is left overs..yeah!!  I did however leave out the 2 jalapeno peppers ( I forgot to buy them), but otherwise did follow the directions.  When serving, added cheese and sour cream as a topping.

Yummm!!!!! I still have to cook the chili for 10 more minutes but I just taste-tasted it and it is delicious!!! For me, it is the perfect amount of spiciness. I left out the bay leaves and cans of chopped green chile peppers (forgot to buy them) and it tastes just fine. Other than that, I followed the recipe as-is I used Boca meatless crumbles and would recommend them.

Really a great chili with a good kick to it - but beware that it makes a TON! I omitted the kidney beans but next time I will omit the garbanzos.  I also left out the corn and used only 1 bag of the crumbles - still is great and will be a keeper!

I have been making a similar version for years but I like to saute the onions, toss in some fresh garlic and then saute the burger crumbles. Be careful with the Boca Crumbles as they need to be thoroughly cooked before eating.

Made this tonight and it DELICIOUS. I was hesitant to put 1/4 cup chili powder in, but sure enough it was the perfect amount of spice! My only complaint which has nothing to do with the actual recipe itself, is that it says it serves 8. But with the amount of food i came up with, it serves more like 12-16 people! Other than that awesome!

Made this for dinner last night with home-made corn bread and it was excellent. I don't like the crushed tomatoes consistency/texture so next time I will probably just use diced, peeled tomatoes in juice. Also it should say "The Best SPICY Vegetarian Chili in the World"! Fortunately, we love spicy.

I am sorry but this was not very good. I've eaten worse food but this is definately on the "Never Again" list. I made according to the recipe and I thought it was bad. I have to add more cumin and garlic to give it some palatable flavor, but I cannot over come the excessive spice. It was much too hot. I added some sugar to counteract the acid-like heat, and it helped a little but I cant say that it was good. Really disappointed since it was quite time consuming.

Way good.. I did find it just a tad too salty, but I did modify the ingredients a little, so that could be why. I used half the soy crumbles, pintos instead of black beans, only 1 jalapeno, and added two fire roasted bell peppers.

I followed recipe but used "Mexican style extra spicy chili powder" and I added a cubed zuchini.  I used four crumbled Portobello/garlic burgers.  This chili tied for second in a chili-cook off entered yesterday and the competition included the meat chilis.  I am so happy to have some left over to enjoy myself!

I would have given this chili 5 stars, but the first time I made it, I found it to be way too spicy and way too salty. The second time I made it, I cut the salt down to 1 teaspoon, and omitted the black pepper altogether, then realized why the submitter made it so spicy and salty: to cover up the bitterness from the 2 tablespoons of dried oregano! So I cut the bitterness by adding a teaspoon of sugar, a teaspoon of seasoning salt, and a teaspoon of buffalo wing sauce. Next time I make it, I think I'll decrease the dried oregano to 1 tablespoon, then salt & spice it to taste

Thanks for the recipe. I will make again. I left out the vegetarian burger crumbles, because I prefer unprocessed ingredients. My 9 & 22 year old sons didn't even notice that it didn't have meat in it, Never tried garbanzo beans in a recipe and liked them. I also left out the corn and used only two big 28 oz cans of whole peeled tomatoes which I pureed. I did find the recipe to be a little salty, but it could have been the type of canned tomatoes I chose. Next time I will salt as needed. One last thing I did different was shred a little bit of carrots and add Turmeric because someone told me that it prevents Alzheimers and I felt this was a good recipe where the spice wouldn't stand out.

Best Chili ever!!  Everyone gobbled this up...even my 14 year old picky son.  I doubled the amount of cumin and chili powder and it was perfect.  I never added in the can of green chopped chili peppers (couldn't find it)  and it was just perfect.  Not too spicy at all.  I was very worried it would be with 2 jalapenos...but not even my whiny teenager complained.  I drained and rinsed all the cans of beans and added 2 fresh tomatoes (just had them laying around)  I will be making this recipe forever!!  Thanks!

This was great, I do not like garbanzo beans so next time I won't add them and one other thing I added a tablespoon of dark brown sugar I double this and it was a lot but the sugar was so needed. It was gone as fast as I could set it out with nothing left, I could have just put the pot back in the cabinet. thats how clean the pot was when they finished. a keeper thanks

I made chili first time in my life.  Here is my story...    I found this recipe yesterday, got ingredients in the evening, cooked it last night and won 3rd place in office chili cook-off. Everyone who tried it, loved it!    I used more garlic, more cumin powder, more black pepper, more jalapenos than recipe called for.  I used one big onion.  I used 2 cans of tomatoes and 1 bag of soy protien crumble based on other reviews. I did not use gerbanzo beans and replaced 1 can of corn with 1 can of kidney beans.       I plan to make this AGAIN during holidays and I am buying crock-pot with the prize money.      Thank you for the recipe.

Great chili recipe.  I made it without the crumbles and subbed cans of tomatoes with green chiles instead of using separate cans of each.  I also added one can of crushed tomatoes since I prefer my chili thicker.  Everyone loved it.  Will definitely be making this often.

Very good Chili!!  I pretty much followed the recipe word for word except  I used Tastefully Simples's "Wahoo Chili" instead of chili powder since I was out of the later.  I used 2 large seeded Jalapeños and it had plenty of kick.  my fire eating Hubbie usually douses his chili with Franks Redhot but he didn't have to with this.  It is a really nice sized recipe which, for me, made plenty for leftovers and 2 batches to go in the freezer for later.  I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty chili.  I just used three 28oz cans of crushed tomatoes,instead of whole tomatoes crushed by hand like the recipe suggests.  The chili comes out thicker that way (the way I like it).  I thought the veggie burger crumbles were overpriced at my grocery store (6 dollars for a 12oz package) so I just bought boca burgers and chopped them up.  I seeded the jalapenos before adding them because I used a really hot chili powder, and didn't want to kill myself haha. I served it with elbow macaroni but it goes great with rice as well!  MAKES A TON

My daughter turned me on to this recipe and I just love it.  I love old fashioned chili with meat...but this vegetarian chili has stepped up to being my favorite.  The only thing I do different is I only use one jalapeno pepper.  But, that's just a personal choice.  Our whole family enjoys this recipe.  Thanks for sharing it.

I just won second place in a chili cook-off at work with this chili!  There were 12 entries and no one could believe mine was vegetarian!  I read a lot of reviews and made just a few changes:  Used only two 28 oz cans of tomatoes, added about 4 chipotle peppers, minced (the ones in adobo sauce), used only one jalapeno and one green pepper, only 1 tsp of salt and omitted the corn.  Some people said it was kind of spicy, and some said it wasn't spicy at all.  I think it was just the right amount.  Chili is one of those foods that people like a certain way, and you can't please everyone.  However, I do have to say that if this chili beat 10 other "meat chilis" in a contest...it must be good!  I also wanted to mention that the consistency was perfect with two cans of tomatoes- not too runny and not dry.  Good stuff!

This recipe is delicious! I appreciate the recipe creator adding information about the canned tomatoes, but I used fresh roma tomatoes instead of canned. I also cut back on the chili powder and omitted salt and olive oil (instead combining all ingredients in one pot rather than sautéeing them in oil first), but since I like things very spicy added a fresh habañero pepper to the jalapeño. I also added fresh cilantro. I have lots of leftovers but will be making this again soon!

Yes, it is quite possibly the best in the world... I am a wimp when it comes to spicy food, so I only put in one jalapeno and cut the chili powder and black pepper in half. It totally doesn't need extra salt either! yum! thanks!

I’m impressed. It really is tough to find a good veg chili recipe and this one definitely tops it. I made a few changes to MY recipe- halved it because I was unsure if I was gonna like it or not. Instead of the veg crumbles I added I package tempeh (which I happen to ADORE) which I marinated in 2 TBS soy sauce, 3 TBS water and 1 clove of garlic minced. I then crumbed it and added to the recipe when it called for the crumbles following the beginning of the recipe pretty exactly except I didn’t use the canned diced chilies. In the crock-pot I put a (28oz) can and a half of crushed tomatoes, the chili powder, frozen corn and black and kidney beans (no garbanzos) and a lot more cumin. I read another reviewers suggestion and added a bit of cinnamon. I then put everything into the crock-pot and simmered overnight (accident actually I forgot to turn it off before I went to bed) on low. Brought it with me for lunch and I was in chili heaven. I erred on the side of mild chili just in case someone else wanted some in my house (fam and boyfriend don’t like hot like I do) but it def could use more heat, next time I’ll add the jalapeño seeds and ribs. Great addition to my recipes thanks!

My first time making chili and I'm hooked! This recipe is so delicious.  I made a few alterations as I was following the recipe, mostly because I could not find a few of the ingredients.  I left out the fake-meat product because I don't care it. I also left out the chopped chili pepper because I couldn't find one.  I added extra veggies (I used 2 zuccini's, 1 yellow squash, 2 green peppers, 2 red peppers, and some carrots). I steamed the carrots first so that they would cook through.  Also, I let it cook for 2.5 hours instead of just 45 minutes.  After 45 minutes it just didn't seem to be even close to ready, probably because I added so many extra veggies.  

The result... Amazing!  This is so delicious.  It has kick to it for sure, which I like.  Next time I make it, I will add an extra can of beans because I added so many vegetables that the beans got lost. 

A fantastic cold-weather food.  So good for you too - so there is no guilt in having another bowl full as a snack. Also a great bring-to-work lunch.

Thank for your this recipe! I'm in love with it.

We loved this chili.  I did make a few substitutions to suit our tastes: I left out the celery since we don't like it, and I halved the amount of peppers because I thought it was going to be much too spicy for us.  I used one green bell pepper, one jalapeno, and one can of green chiles, but kept the full amounts of everything else.  I'm glad I did that, because it turned out comfortably spicy.  The full amount of peppers would have been too much for us.  I also used canned diced tomatoes because that's what I had on hand.

We made this recipe for my sister's 40th birthday camp out and it was a HUGE hit. She is the only vegetarian, but everyone there, including my 6 year old nephew LOVED the recipe and went back for more.

Changes to the recipe - I did not add Bell Peppers and my husband and I are allergic, but it did not diminish from the amazing flavor. Secondly, I used 2 cans of crushed tomatoes and only one can of whole as it makes for a less lumpy chili. We had tortilla chips, shredded cheese and sour cream for toppers.  Everyone loved the chili so much they were eating it for breakfast the next morning. A true winner!

I am so pleased with this recipe, I recently went vegetarian and with recipes like this, I don't miss the meat!  For the first time I made no changed to a recipe, exactly as is but cut it in hal, this made about 8 servings cut in half, it looks like.  I love the spices used and the kick from the jalapeno.  I'm not a fan of meat substitutes but this worked well, I used Morningstar meal starter crumbles and it doesn't taste funny at all.  Thanks so much!

So good! Like many other reviewers, I did trick meat-eating relatives into enjoying it. I'm sure I will be making this recipe many more times, and experimenting with different spice levels. I only used one can of green chiles and a little less than a quarter cup of chili powder, and thought in the end I could have used a tiny bit more spice. Was great with sour cream and cheddar. Will probably follow the recipe exactly next time. Thanks for the great recipe!

I loved this recipe. I made a few adjustments: I added 1 additional can of corn, I used 2 packets of the Ortega Chili Seasoning instead of straight Chili Powder (Because This is what I had in the house) & I omitted the Green Chilis, because I could not find them at the store. 

This was a hir with my family & my co-workers.. I would make this recipe over & over again

Thanks. This chili is very easy to make. I followed it exactly, and it tastes great. I included seeds in the jalapeno pepper, which is the perfect amount of heat for me. I drained the beans but I put all of the crushed tomatoes including the juice from the cans. I add leftover rice and let the chili reheat it.

this was a really tasty and filling meal. i loved the variety of the beans, the use of veggie crumbles and the subtle cumin flavor. i halved the recipe, but still used the full cans of beans/corn. i also left out the spicy ingredients because my boyfriend's not a fan. overall we were satisfied and plan on making it again. thanks for the recipe!!

This is a great chili recipe, which doesn't even taste vegetarian. I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, and only one big chili pepper--and it was plenty spicy. Also substituted cayenne pepper for chili powder. I halved the recipe but still had a heaping pot which lasted me two weeks. This chili freezes well, and gets better with age.

Wow, this is really good.  I'm just trying to go vegetarian and this chili could have fooled my family who are all carnivores.  Everyone agreed that this is a keeper recipe and having food that tastes this good makes it easier to cut meat out of our diet.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

WOW! This was a hit at our Super Bowl party. I made this and a meat chili. Everyone including my die hard carnivore husband went for this. I goofed on the shopping list and bought only 1 package of vegetarian burger crumbles (I used Boca brand) but it was fine. I used 2 cans of tomatoes rather than 3. I also added some red hot pepper flakes for some kick. Very Weight Watcher friendly too. Awesome!!! I will be making this again!

I have been searching for a long time for a chili that I would use above all others, and this is it.  There is so much versitility that it is virtually fool-proof.  It would be very easy to substitute or add to the recipe.

yum, so good! I added a can of tomato sauce and subbed zucchini for the bell pepper. Next time I'll just used crushed tomatoes (crushing 2 lg cans of whole by hand is messy). Regarding all the spicy debate- you're using 3 different kinds of chiles and heat varies widely- just add or adjust according to preference.

I left out the veggie burger crumbles and subbed pinto beans for garbanzos.  I brought this to a potluck where many of my middle eastern students are vegetarian.  Everyone, even the meat-eaters, loved this recipe.  There weren't very many leftovers.

Best in the World is no brag.  It's great and one of the tastiest uses of soy protein I have found.  Everyone thought it had lean ground beef in it.  This recipe freezes well too....

Great taste, and full body. I used the (2) 12 oz packages of soy ground beef that was called for, and it could have gotten away with one, it was pretty "meaty", but good, and just enough spiciness, great job!

This chili is fantastic.  It was VERY spicy, but enjoyable. I added a piece of zucchini and used fresh beans instead of canned, and it turned out fine.  I would definitely make it again!

So good! But too watery..next time I will drain ALL of the beans, not just 2 of the cans like the recipe says. Then it will be a 5.

This chili is AWESOME! I did end up using a little bit more chili powder but otherwise, perfect. I didn't think it was too spicy, though. Migh add another jalepeno next time. Delicious!

Very tasty.  I did leave out the chili peppers and found it still very spicy (just right).  I will be making this again (often).

I doubled this recipe for a 15-person dinner party and it was a hit.  I cut back the cans of tomatoes by one third as I thought it was getting too watery. I did not use the canned green chiles because I couldn't get any on short notice.  Instead I added some fresh serrano chiles.  For the meat crumbles, I used the Quorn brand.  The finished product was very flavorful, slightly spicy, nice for a range of tastes. I will definitely make this again.

This chili is the best combination of veggies ever! I use this same recipe but add diced butternut, zucchini, crook neck squashes. I also use dried chili pods to make my broth and then add one can of tomato paste to finish it off.

Very tasty, simple one-pot meal.   I'm the only semi-vegetarian in the family, but everyone ate and enjoyed this.  Really good in the summer served cold, topped with some diced avocado.

I omitted the veggie crumbles and canned peppers and added some zucchini, yellow bell peppers and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  It adds a tiny, unplaceable note of complexity to th dish.

Two meat-eaters and a vegan all loved this recipe.  It has great flavor and texture.  I made it pretty much exactly as it's written, and will definitely make it again when I want a change from my regular chili.

Just ok.  I like spicy, but I thought this was way too spicy.  I only used 1/8 C of chili powder.  Next time I will only use 1 small jalapeno.  I think I will cut down on the black pepper as well.

I can't really rate this recipe because i used it as a base. i really enjoyed what i ended up with though, so why not add another positive review? my changes: 1 green bell pepper, more celery, 1.5 times as many kidney beans, 19 oz chick peas (those are the same as garbanzo beans, right?), no jalapenos so i put in crushed red pepper (1/2 tsp.) and ground cayenne (1 tsp.) and left out the chili pepper, no veggie burger crumbles and i think that's it. it turned out really really spicy, but that's how i love it! the spice combination already listed was delicious. thank you so much for a magnificent base!

Good, but I used real hamburger. I saw that the only liquid seemed to come from the cans of beans, and that didn't seem right, so I drained all the beans and corn with the exception of the black beans. I added a 29 oz. can of tomato sauce. I also used a 14.5 oz can of petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh ones. The end result was very tasty.

I have made this a number of times....it is sooooo good. Don't hesitate to try it !! Even my "carnivore" family members love it. Also, if you have a vacuum sealer, it freezes really well. I love to go into the freezer two weeks after I have made it and surprise myself with a chili lunch.

This recipe was great!  My husband and I are vegetarian and have been searching for a good chili recipe--this is the one!  I threw everything, along with a little water, into the crock pot for about 4 hours and it turned out perfect.

Very easy to prepare and tasty. It is also adaptable. I used 2 fresh green chiles and less than 1/4 cup chile pepper, it was still very hot. Next time I'll use even less.

Very good, with 3 adjustments:
1. Used dried beans, soaked them overnight, then cooked them for 60 to 75 minutes.  Much better and less salt.
2. used skinned tomatoes, quartered. Before adding the beans & corn, used a potato masher to mush up the the tomatoes & mix.
3. Used dried lentils to adjust consistency (depends on type of tomato).

AMAZING! This chili turned out so delicious! Highly recommended. I made a couple of modifications. I didn't drain the black or garbanzo beans. Up until that point, the chili really didn't have a base. So, emptying the beans in there along with their liquid made for a nice base in the chili. I halved the amount of pepper. You have to add more salt than it calls for. The trick is tasting the chili after every step to see when you need to add salt. I also baked some cornbread and served the chili over cornbread. Yum! The kids even liked it. It has some kick to it, but not much. If you don't like any kick, use only one jalapeno.

This is great! My husband and daughter loved this. I did make some adjustments-I halved the recipe (it makes a ton), left out the jalapenos (it is still pretty spicy), added a little can of tomato paste and a little veggie broth to make it the right consistency. Thank you for this recipe!

Omg this recipe is amazing! It was my first time making chili and it was so good my non-vegetable loving boyfriend gobbled it right up and boy was it tasty. I added chicken stock in the cans of beans after I rinsed them and also added 1 chopped zucchini squash and fresh Italian parsley. It was beautiful and full of colors and tastiness. I did add some garlic salt for that extra bit of flavor, and it was great. Would definitely recommend this recipe to everyone!

This is delicious! I left out the jalapenos becuase I have young ones who don't like things super spicey - that left it spicy, but just a little. Kids ate it and loved it. And it is super nutritious!

I love chili and I am not a vegetarian.  However, I made this for my vegetarian friends, expecting to be disappointed.  It was the wonderful and I honestly don't think I could tell the difference!  It was spicy and complex. Served it with sour cream and green onions as toppings.  It was a hit! I will make this again and may do the vegetarian as my go to chili recipe. YUM!  Sharon

I don't make very many vegetarian dishes, but I wanted to cook for my office and the doctor I work for is a vegetarian.  Thank goodness for this recipe! It was a huge hit and everyone loved it.  The doc even asked if it really was vegetarian...lol.  My wife and I are the only ones who like heat, so I left out the jalapenos.  Other than that,  the only changes I made were the addition of three small zucchinis and swapping one of the green bell peppers with a red pepper.  Calead910, thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Love it, with some changing around- I add in a med- large eggplant, package of mushrooms, and an small-med extra jalapeño. Also, I add Cayanne pepper to the 1/4 c chili powder (both totaling the 1/4 c.) Lastly, I leave out the vegetarian burger crumbles. Let it simmer for 45-60 min. Make a box of elbow macaroni and add that to my bowl. Great with a little sour cream and/or shredded cheddar cheese. I LOVE spicy food and like that I can adjust this to taste.  This recipe will last my husband and I about a week. Its also GREAT for freezing.

Awesome recipe! We omitted the burger crumbles, but the flavor was just right. Next time, I will put 1 less can of tomato and 1 more can of beans, however. The recipe also made a lot more than we anticipated (3 meals total). Great recipe, DEFINITELY making this again!

This recipe is great!! Everyone, even the meat eaters I know, love this chili. My sister is a huge meat eater and refused to try this the first couple times I made it wanting the meat but one bite changed her mind. I did change the recipe up slightly to suit my taste.  I eliminate the vegetarian crumbles and instead add a can of lentils. I add an extra can of beans (usually white beans) and 1/4 cup brown sugar (which I used at the advice of other reviewers). If I'm making it for kids or anyone who doesn't like too much spice I eliminate the jalapenos, it still has a little zip but nothing overpowering. Again, wonderful recipe!!

Made this last night for the first time.  I'm 90% vegetarian and thought this would be a good hearty meal and was quite happy with it.  I was afraid that the meatless part would be textured in a weird way but it was fine (I used Trader Joe's Meatless Meatballs).  It was nice and thick and filling.  The only thing I did was up the heat with red chili sauce and added some elbow macaroni.  I have enough for the week!

I thought this chili was excellent! Mine came out a bit watery for my taste, so I added a can of tomato paste. I also didn't use as much salt as it called for. Seemed like quite a bit. Everyone is different with their salt taste preference as well, so I think it's better to start with a bit less. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Yes, this is the best chili in the world!!  However, I exclude the garbanzo beans and veggie burger crumbles (just not a fan in general).  I double up on the black & kidney beans and add chili beans - so I put in about 5 cans of beans total.  Also, I exclude the tomatoes and add tomato sauce & ketchup to give it the tomato-y taste.  I make this batch for myself, then make another batch for my husband and just had turkey or hamburger.  Perfect for a nice chilly (no pun intended) evening!

This chili is so good, probably the best chili I've had. I made homemade "ground beef" using a cauliflower based recipe, and you would have never known it didn't have real meat in it.

This chili is the bomb.com!!!! It is to die for!! My entire family loves veggie chili night and Everyone agrees that it is WAY better than the normal chili that we had been making forever. We aren't real vegetarians, we were just looking for healthier options. Glad we decided to try it!!!

Delicious, and a huge hit even for my meat-eating room mates! I did make some changes to the recipe though, as I was working with what was already in stock. I didn't have fresh bell peppers or canned corn, so I used the frozen versions (which I sauteed separately before adding in), and I relied on red beans instead of black beans. I also incorporated fresh oregano rather than dried. Finally, I skipped the burger crumbles, and punched up the flavor with a few chipotles in adobo sauce. I'll follow the ingredients more closely in the future, but I am very happy with the result.

To those who have yet to make this recipe: Go ahead, do it! It's easy to customize to your own preference. There's also little prep time involved; most of it is actual cooking time, so it's easy to make on a weekday evening.

This recipe is awesome! Not too spicy at all. Maybe the detractors used cayenne instead of chili mix, or maybe they just have super bland taste buds? I used the Fiesta brand of chili mix with one jalapeno pepper, and it was just the perfect level of spiciness.

This is THE BEST chili (and healthiest) I've ever had. My husband loves it and we are Texan carnivores. I've made it plenty of times and discovered that the flavors are much better when I use "petite diced tomatoes" instead of crushed. I'm not sure why it makes such a difference, but it really does. It's also great with real beef.

This was by far the best chili I have ever had.  But it was way too spicy!!!!  I only used 1 and a half jalapenos too.  Next time I will only use one and de-seed it to boot!  But regardless of the spice, it was still amazing!

I loved this recipe I didn't have some of the ingredients so I decided to use this one and the Flatlander's Chili recipe which is my other favorite recipe.  I just used Red kidney beans alone and I add tomato juice to the chili to add liquid to my chili :) so tasty don't even need toppings.. which I usually love to do.. ah.. chili I

Amazing chili! I adjusted the recipe and used 1 jalapeño instead of 2, a little more than 1/8 cup of chili powder rather than 1/4 cup (still fairly spicy), and 1 can of petite diced tomatoes in place of 1 of the crushed cans. Everyone loved it. Very successful and easy.

This chili is fantastic!! I added mushrooms, zucchini, exchanged one green pepper for a red pepper, I also used frozen corn. I drained and rinsed all the beans. I skipped the celery(not a fan). I also downsized on the spice by eliminating the jalapenos and added a little more chili powder. Yummy, it's one of my favorite Meatless Monday meals. You can serve it with some sour cream and shredded cheese also, but you really don't need any extras.

We have been making this chili since my freshman year of college in 2008. Perfect chili for every occasion, especially football games. No one that has ever tried it knew it wasn't beef chili until I told them! Thanks so much, great recipe! To mix it up, I like to put sour cream and cilantro as a garnish (sometimes fritos and grated cheddar or colby jack cheese).

I followed this receipe today - OMG! I added the Jalapeno peppers, the green chili pepper and when I saw 1/4 cup of chili powder I questioned it.  So I only put in 1 1/2 tablespoon - Well, even that was too much. Now I have this huge batch of EXTREMELY, OVER THE TOP HOT Chili.  So, not all is lost, I'm making some Whole Wheat Pasta and made a quick tomatoe marinara sauce and added 2 cups of my very hot chili to it, with lots of oregano and basil and garlic, now I have a nice spegetti sauce.  I'll freeze this chili and use it for future sauces...  WOW!

I followed this recipe but made a few modifications:
I only used 1 jalapeno pepper (plenty spicy for me). I used the whole onion. 
Instead of the 3 28 oz cans of tomatoes, I used 1 large can of crushed tomatoes and 1 can of tomato paste.
I added a cup or so of water. 
Instead of veggie crumbles, I used quinoa.
I also added one zucchini (delicious addition).
I drained and rinsed everything but the green chile peppers. 
I seasoned everything to taste, and I prefer lots of chili powder. 
For step 1, I coated the entire bottom of the pot with olive oil, so the vegetables would cook better. 

If I had to make any changes for next time, I would only use one can of green chile peppers and add a couple more celery stalks. The watery texture of the celery breaks up the spiciness quite well. I would also add another can of kidney beans, just because I love them. 

I wasn't going to add the corn, but I'm glad I did, because the texture of the corn also aided in breaking up the spices. 

This chili is delicious and gets better the more it sits and marinates. I made it today and ate it for every meal. I am betting it will be even better tomorrow. The combination of spices is absolutely perfect. 

This recipe is a great blueprint for solid, vegan chili.Of course everyone is going to have a different tolerance for spice, and you have to customize it to your needs.

I think that, if you are wanting to feed your kids this chili....it would be way too spicy with so much chili powder. I only put about 1 TBS of chili powder, and omitted the jalapenos altogether.It still had some kick without being too spicy for my kids. Flavor and texture was wonderful.  I also just threw all of the ingredients into my slow cooker on low, all day.

The title doesn't lie! My wife and I cooked up a pot of this because we had a vegetarian friend coming over, and I honestly enjoyed it more than any chili I've ever had! It was incredibly tasty. We did make one small change- we like the heat, so we used 4 serranos instead of 2 jalepenos. Even with this change, it was *not* particularly spicy, despite some other reviews. Might add a little heat next time, but otherwise this recipe is perfect.

Best veggie chili I've ever had.
I added portabello mushrooms and habanero peppers, other than that stuck to the recipe.
I also made it for 16 servings and will now have left overs for 2 weeks.  Fantastic dish.

I have made this recipe before and am about to make it for my third time! I make this recipe as is, only I skip the veggie burger crumbles, as I am personally not a fan of faux mean. I also drain and rinse the beans as others have recommended. One of the great things about this recipe is that you can use many other veggies that are left over in the fridge or cupboard (carrots, green beans, red peppers, canned chipotle peppers…). Definitely a fave!

This is really good, not spicy enough for us though. I would make it again and add cayenne or maybe it was because I seeded my jalapenos. I left out the celery since I don't like celery and used pinto beans instead of the chick peas.

Awesome!!! I served it to family and friends for a week and nobody knows it's vegetarian lmao. Next time I'll omit the garbanzo beans, but that's just a personal preference.Other than that I followed the recipe completely. The only difference is that i sauteed the ground meat patties with mushrooms and dried herbs in order to pump up the flavor.

I think the flavor and spice is great. I love spicy food, but thought it was too spicy, however I did not use the burger crumbles. I added 6 small cans of tomato sauce and one large can of tomato paste. Added one additional can of black beans. I would only use 1 jalapeño pepper and one can of chopped jalapeno. Like I said, nice flavor, but too spicy. I did have the jalapenos in fridge for awhile, so they were more ripe, which could add to the hotness.

I can't count the number of times I have made this recipe or variations of it since I found it 3 or 4 years ago. It is DELICIOUS. I have made it exactly as written, with beef or turkey when cooking for omnivores, with substitutions or omissions when I forget an ingredient, and with cocoa powder for a chocolate chili - all of these have turned out wonderful. No matter what variations I do or do not make, this chili always meets rave reviews. This is my go-to base recipe and I love that I can feel confident that it will still turn out great even if I forget something (example: I am making it now and forgot to get celery). Great recipe! Thanks so much for sharing!

This really is the best vegetarian chili ever!  I added a few jalapeno seeds to the pot for a little more spice and left out the vegetarian burger crumbles.  We had enough leftover to put in a container and throw into the freezer for the following week's dinner.  This chili definitely tastes better after a day or two as well.

I make a few changes. First, I buy crushed tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes. I think it makes a better texture and crushing by hand is too hard.
Second, I just throw everything into a big pot except the olive oil and let it simmer until the veggies are soft.
Great recipe, though! Very spicy but that's the way we like our chili. :)

Wonderful chili recipe.  It does make a lot--my large pot was bubbling over by the time everything was added.  Could use a little more spice in my opinion--will try again adding a bit more chili powder to the mix.

This is actually my favorite chili of all time, meat-full or meat-free!  I have served this along with a meat chili before, and this one got eaten to the dregs before the other one was finished.  As always, it is easy enough to suit to your tastes by adding or deleting ingredients.

This was really delicious!   I realized that our supply of chili powder was OUT when I was in the middle of the recipe.  I substituted 2 chipotles in adobo for the chili powder.  I also used my mini food processor to chop all the veggies, left out the black beans and only used 2-28 oz cans of tomatoes.  Delicious and great heat from the chipotles.

After trying numerous vegetarian chili recipes, I was about to give up and return to chili made with beef, but this recipe has made a believer out of me. It was delicious, healthy and filling. I didn't change a thing.

Hearty and delicious! This could easily become a St. Patrick's Day tradition. I increased the carrot a bit for color and added a little chopped celery. I also left most of the skin on the potatoes for a rustic colcannon. Excellent.

Awesome!  Used ground turkey instead of veggie crumbles, pinto instead of garbanzo beans.  Took another reviewer's advice and doubled the cumin and chili powder.  Only used 1 TSP of salt, 1 TBSP seems a little overkill especially when using canned beans.  I rinsed the heck out of the beans before adding them.  OH YEAH…be careful when you add this to your "Shopping List".  I had about 3 different recipes on it and it measured out the canned tomatoes weird and I had to rush back to the store when I noticed how much the recipe actually called for.  It makes A LOT so have your freezer containers ready!  It tastes AWESOME!

I made this chili for a dinner guest that is on a very strict diet. Normally, we love to cook and eat any kind of protein. I decided to make this and not tell my family that it was vegetarian...well at least til their bowls were empty. Everyone loved it!! Tips??? Definitely rinse the beans well. I used diced canned tomatoes instead of whole. I also added chopped baby portabella mushrooms. Delish! Thanks for sharing. :-)

Seems much more like a hamburger-vegetable soup than chili to me, but very good. I made a half batch, but the full amount of jalapenos, garlic, and chilis. Substituted 1/4 cup of Sriracha chili sauce for the chili powder, which left it almost spicy enough. I'll be adding some more when I heat it up again. If you like really hot chili, double or triple the amount of hot stuff, it's pretty tame as is.

very good - I didn't have black beans so I subbed pinto, think it would be better with black.  Made a lot - I halved the recipe and it still made about 8 servings.

Great chili recipe. I use it as a base then add some meat and special ingredients. I add ground beef, hot italian sausage (sqeezed out of tubes and cooked like ground beef), a few unsweetened chocolate cubes, a few squirts of liquid smoke, some coffee, mushrooms, corn, and a dash of cayenne pepper. Been working on this recipe for a while.

i had never tried meatless crumbles and was curious about a vegetarian chili so i decided to try this recipe because of the great reviews. it was okay, but i don't think i'll make it again. it did make a HUGE amount and i ended up throwing away about 2/3 of it since it's just my husband and i. i think one of my mistakes was using tomato puree instead of crushing up the whole peeled tomatoes myself. i figured i would save some time, but it was way too much tomato sauce. my dutch oven overflowed. also, the meatless crumbles grossed me out a bit. i'm sure it's just mental! the celery was way too crunchy, meaning i didn't cook it long enough. anyway, thank you for sharing!

I made this recipe for our local AARP meeting of 40 + members. This was an absolute crowd pleaser... delicious, spicy, and healthy.  I changed a few things:  multiplied the recipe x 5,  left out the burger crumbles, and added 3 cups of sliced carrots added with the green peppers and 4 zucchini sliced added with the corn. Needed a really huge pot. Simmer time a little longer... This smelled so wonderful on the stove.  Super!

The lack of any sweetness in this chile bothered me enough that I added honey to the finished product. Also I used fresh corn, and fried prime grillers in olive oil for the vegetarian burger crumbles and then added a dash of cattlemens smokehouse bbq sauce to the burger mixtures. I also did not like the heat source in this chile. I would much rather do a reduction of a fruit jam (usually apricot) with habenero peppers and then remove the habenero and then add just one jalapeno pepper. I hated the black pepper and canned green chile and overall like a more tropical flavored chile with much more sweetness and a little cilantro and lime. It was edible though and didn't have a bad flavor just not the flavor I was hoping for.

This really was an amazing vegetable chili.  I omitted the burger crumbles, the chiles, and the jalapenos and added additional vegetables (1 cup chopped baby carrots, 1 chopped red bell pepper, a 16 oz bag of frozen broccoli and cauliflower, a chopped head of broccoli, and an additional can of kidney beans), then let everything simmer for nearly two hours.  Like others, I drained and rinsed all the beans before adding them.

The flavor was terrific, and there was still enough spice and heat from the cumin and the chili powder.  

Made for a ton of leftovers as well.  Great recipe.

I cut everything in half and still had more than 8 servings! I left out the jalapeno and it still had a good kick to it. I also used low sodium beans. Very good.

There's a lot of veggies in here, highlighting the fact that this isn't regular meat chili.  (Also means a lot of prep time chopping!  But not necessarily contributing that much to flavor.)  I thought it was ok, but it felt too "healthy" for my meat-itarian boy friend.

A wonderful chili; very hearty.  I made a few changes.  I omitted the corn and added another 15 oz. can of black beans.  I used 1 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and 4 15 oz. cans diced tomatoes.  Increased the chili powder to 1/2 cup.  And used Mexican style crumbles.  Be sure to use canned tomatoes without sugar or corn syrup - otherwise this will be sweet - that is why I omitted the corn.  I do believe I will double the onion, celery and green pepper next time.  We all loved this; it probably made 12 servings - a nice big pot full.  Everyone loved it.

I added more spice (cayenne pepper) because I like it hot.  I could take or leave the corn part.  Next time I will cut back on the salt.  I used white northern beans instead of garbanzos.  At the end I added approx 1/2 c. creamy peanut butter because that gives veggie chili a nice taste.  This was good and tastes like "real" chili.  I will make it again.  I liked it with shredded cheddar on top.  I think it would be good over rice as well.

I love the simplicity of this recipe. As a vegetarian on a strict Candida cleanse, I was unable to use Veggie Ground Round. I omitted the carrots but loaded up on every type/color of pepper...be careful not to go too heavy with Cumin on this recipe. I also added diced fresh tomatoes and veggie stock for the beans to slightly simmer in. I have made this dish 2 times in the past 2 weeks because it is that good and that easy. If you forget to use a Jalapeno pepper, just add a tsp or red chili flakes which give it a nice zip.    This recipe is easy, hearty and freezes great! Thank you!

Loved it! Made a few modifications based on other reviewers' suggestions. Instead of 2 green bell peppers, used 1 green, 1 red. Only used about 1/2 of a jalapeno (my 82 yr old Gram was eating w/us & didnt want to shock her) & its a good thing b/c it was still VERY spicy. Also, used a whole medium onion, only 1 pkg veggie crumbles, only 2 cans crushed tomatoes & added 1 can diced tomatoes & 1 small can tomato sauce, and replaced garbanzos with can of white beans. This recipe makes a HUGE amount of food! Definitely more than 8 servings. Served with cornbread.

This is the only chili I will be making from now on and I'm not even vegetarian! It is nice and thick with a full-bodied flavor. I used just one pack of the crumbles as I was a little uncertain not having used anything like that before. No more ground beef in chili for me, crumbles it is. One jalapeno pepper gave a nice, but not too hot temperature. I might put both in next time and kick it up a notch. You can always serve it with a dollop of sour cream to cut the heat a little and add a nice flavor and creamy texture. Did I mention I LOVE this chili? You have to try it.

this was a delicious chili.  I didn't add the fake meat and only a lil bit of corn cause I'm not a big fan. But this was really good, very spicy so I had to put a lil plain yogurt in the bowl which was sooo good with it.  Also as a side note if you used diced instead of crushed tomatos you'll need to add broth to it or it'll be a bit too thick. :) Thanks for this recipe!! Seriously wonderful.

My hubby declared this to be "outstanding" (and he's a meat lover).   It is better the next day.  Based upon some previous reviews, I made the following adjustments:  added about 1/2 cup of fresh cilantro and 2 shredded parsnips, used red peppers instead of green, increased the cumin to 2 tsp., omitted the jalapeno, increased the garlic to 4 cloves, added 1 T. brown sugar, reduced the chili powder by half and only used 1 tsp. of salt.  I also used diced tomatoes instead of crushed and rinsed the beans.  Added 2 zucchinis cut into fairly large chunks and omitted the vegetarian crumbles.  Even without the jalapenos it was still quite spicy.  Be sure to slice the celery thinly, otherwise they will be crunchy. Remember to stir the chili occasionally so it won't stick to the bottom of the pot.  Might add shredded carrots and sliced mushrooms next time.

I almost gave this four stars because I halved the recipe, except the jalapenos, and I didn't think it was that spicy. But it was still really really good. I strained and rinsed all the beans and added a little vegetable broth and some okra. My meat-eating boyfriend loved it.

This recipe is AMAZING! I had to improvise a little bit given what I had around, so I threw in zucchini, mushrooms and excluded black beans. I also had no bay leaves so I substituted parsley, but overall, the same. I also don't like spicy food so I omitted the jalapenos and chile peppers. Overall, amazing recipe though! Draining and rinsing the beans is a must if you're trying to maintain the healthiness of the recipe - it's a sodium-intense recipe as is, it doesn't need the bean's sodium too! One small thing I added of my own accord was curry powder; I felt it added just a little flavour that I personally like in almost everything. Thanks so much for this!

I had to make 2 chili recipes so I made the Darn Good Chili recipe for us meat eaters and this one for the Vegan and Vegetarian in the family. They loved how spicey it was and I loved how easy it was. Even some of the meat eaters loved it!

This is my favorite chili recipe and I make it all the time.  The seasoning is perfect for my taste, but some might find it on the spicy side.  I sometimes sweeten it with some sugar, honey, or chocolate.  You can be somewhat flexible with the veggies--sometimes I leave out the celery or I add in zucchini, yellow squash, or carrots.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Absolutely scrumptiolicious!  I followed recipe except for using 1 pkg Boca Burgers (instead of crumbles), red bell peppers instead of green, and omitted the celery altogether, due to personal preference.  I accidentally burned the chili while simmering it, so I would be sure to stir it occasionally, although my roommate seemed to prefer the slightly burnt taste!  Served it with plain yogurt (healthy sour cream substitution), shredded sharp cheddar, and avocado slices.  Super delicioso, I'd recommend it to ANYONE.

This has become one of my favorite standby recipes.It has been quite the hit at office chili days.   I omit the bay leaves, double the cumin, halve the veggie crumbles and run the tomatoes through the blender.

Loved it. Omitted the chili peppers (I'm kind of a wuss), but kept the jalapenos. Was between mild and medium. Also, I use canned crushed tomatoes instead of whole peeled. I just wasn't doing the whole crush-by-hand thing successfully.

This was the best chili I have ever made!  The whole family loved it.  I did use ground turkey instead of veggie burgers because that's all I had.  Oh and I didn't have any jalapenos.

It was delicious!  I didn't have garbanzo beans so i didn't add that and I added a little bit of white wine and cilantro.  Great recipe!

DELICIOUS!!! Thanks so much for this recipe. My family and I recently started eating vegetarian due to me having fibromyalgia and my husband has high cholesterol. Chili is one of our favorite dishes in the cold weather and I am so glad to have found your recipe. Even the kids loved it!

Best Chili in the World as far as I'm concerned. I had already soaked a pound of red kidneys so used them rather than canned mix, but next time will mix 'em up. We've never met a bean we didn't like.

This IS the absolutely best chili - vegetarian or otherwise - in the world!!! I'm not a huge fan of chili in the first place, but this recipe is a MUST try! My whole family love it - got requests for the recipe, etc. I omited the jalapeno peppers and cut the chili poweder amount in 1/2 because my kids don't like anything too spicy and it was delicious. I can NOT wait to make it again. You would never know it was vegetarian. I'm not vegetarian and I loved it. Served it with cheddar cheese and whole whar tortilla chips - excellent!!! UPDATE - I am making this again and I am using cans of crushed tomatoes and it is not as good as the 1st time I meade it in which I used cans of peeled whole tomatoes that I sliced with a knife while they were still in the can. So, just a thought...maybe the cans of whole peeled tomatoes that are sliced yourself are better than the cans of crushed tomatoes. The cans of crushed tomatoes make the chili MUCH thicker and less tomatoe-y. Your call on how you like it best.

Used 1 package of veggie burger crumbles and 2 cans of tomatoes instead of 3.  Very yummy.

The four stars was because of the meat substitute, since I'm not a big fan... I should have known better and just left it out. Otherwise, nice flavor, and yes,I used the garbanzo beans!

With the title and all the positive reviews, I was worried this recipe was over-hyped. But after having made a big pot, I can say that this TRULY is The Best Vegetarian Chili in the World. I'm not a fan of meat substitute, so I omitted it and added an extra can of beans - 2 cans of pintos and 2 cans of black beans. Don't get me wrong, I love garbanzo beans...but it seemed sacrilegious to put them in chili. This is Texas, after all. Beyond that, I did everything else as written and it was heavenly - the same perfect flavor I remember from my meat-eating days. It's not a super hot chili, but it does have a building spice. I probably won't seed the jalapenos next time. Maybe I'll even sub one for a serrano pepper. Oh, and seriously, the meat substitute was totally unnecessary. In fact, my husband was surprised that the recipe even called for it.

I've recently stopped eating red meat, and have been trying to cut down on meat in general. So I'm always trying to find good vegetarian recipes. This chili is as good as it gets! So spicy and yummy and filling. Even my meat-loving boyfriend loved it!

This is tasty and easy!  I used a 10 oz package of TVP (textured vegetable protein) instead of burger crumbles, which made it necessary to double the salt and go a little heavier on the spices.  This yields an enormous pot of chili---I'd say closer to 12 servings.  It was extra good after the flavors had a chance to meld in the fridge overnight.

Great!  We made it for Friday night dinner.  Everyone loved it.  Then on superbowl sunday used left overs for chili dogs, another big winner with whole family.  Later on in week used final leftovers to top spaghetti and then sprinkled cheddar cheese on top.  My whole family cant stop talking about the "chili" mom made!

Wow!!  No one knew it was Veggie!  I wanted a real meat looking chili so I left out the garbanzo beans and corn and added 1 can of chili beans instead to keep the color dark.  Also, only used 1 stalk of celery.  Made it with cornbread and honey butter, perfect!!  To cook I sauteed the onions and spices on the cook top then threw everything into the crock pot for 3-4 hours on high, stirring every hour.  This recipe makes a LOT, enough for 6 with left overs for everyone.

I just put everything in a pot and let it cook for a few hours. Great! Spicy! These were just a matter of preference or what I had on hand, but it turned out wonderful anyhow! I omitted can of garbanzo beans and the can of peppers.  I only used 2 28oz cans of crushed tomatoes (I like it thicker, though another 14oz I think would be fine but 28 seems too much) therefore I only did 1 green bell pepper. And 1 jalapeno pepper, but i think maybe i should have done 2. Instead I added a hot red pepper (not sure what kind, long and skinny)

Hold the fake meat/any meat at all.  Add an extra can of Kidney Beans, 8oz can of mushrooms. Double the onion.  

Very spicy but very delicious, and healthy!!  LOTS of veggies.  Added shredded sharp cheddar (and sour cream) on top.   

Maybe next time double the garbanzo beans.  Perhaps a little less spicy.  Maybe add a little more corn.  

Great to make a bunch and freeze.

This was my first time making homemade chili for a party of 10 and it came out excellent!!! I cooked it the night before for an extended period of time (this way all of the flavors emeshed nicely with one another). The day of the party, I simmered the chili for another 45 minutes while adding the corn.  I juiced up the recipe with the addition of zucchine, carrots and cinammon! Yummy!!!

Very good.  I wish I had all the ingredients on hand, but despite this, the chili came out great.  What I was missing:  green pepper, fresh jalapeno, chili powder and veg. meat.

First, after reading many reviews, I halved the recipe.  Still a lot of food for 4 people.  Changes:  I cut up 13 Little Smokies, and three pieces of bacon and sauteed that with the 1/4 of an onion and 3 small celery stalks. I added the spices along with paprika, parsley and chives.  Then I added a small can of mushrooms. Then I added the entire can of green chili's (no draining). Con't to saute. Then I added an entire can of garbanzo beans (I do not care for kidney beans), 1/4 can of red kidney and 1/2 can of black beans.  Made my own chili spice, (can look up on the web) and added jalapeno flakes (very few) and some red pepper too.  Also added 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 small can of tomato sauce, 1/2 cup of water and a couple tbs of red wine.

Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

I haven't enough experience with chili in general and the vegetarian variety in particular to say that it's the best or even close. Sure does taste good though.
My variations:
2 onions
1 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce instead of 2 jalapenos
only one can of green chillies
no black pepper (oops)
some quartered button mushrooms
caled910 must have some hungry folks sitting down to her table. I got 16 cups so I'd expect to be able to serve 12.
I liked the heat level though No. 1 opined that it was too hot and needed more liquid.
This will be added to my small but growing list of vegan dishes

This chili was really yummy!! I loved how colorful it was and it had just the right amount of spice. I used beef instead of vegetarian meat and I added a can of pinto beans. This recipe made so much chili, my husband and I have been eating it for days...but we're still not tired of it!! ***special note of suggestion: use rubber gloves to cut up the canned chili peppers!! After cutting them my hands felt like they were on FIRE for hours...

Delicious!  I wasn't sure about adding garbanzo beans but it was fantastic.  I skipped the corn and cut way down on the chili powder (I buy chili powder from an Indian grocery...it's much hotter than mainstream brands), adding a jalapeno and hot Rotel for spice.  Served with a dollup of sour cream and this is now a new family favorite.

This is a great recipe!  I made this for a vegan event and it was a huge hit.  Just spicy enough! Edit:  Made this again and it was even better. Of course, this time I used 2 lbs of ground beef.  Fantastic recipe, great for bean lovers. Both times, I've used a crock pot and gotten great results.

The title over-promises a bit, but the chili is definitely very good and I will be making it again.

I used two large cans of crushed tomatoes, and left the liquid from all of the beans in the recipe.  The consistency turned out just right: thick, but not too thick.  Substantive. :)

I did not find this recipe spicy whatsoever, so the spice factor is definitely going to be different for everyone.  I threw in 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, and I still wouldn't call the result anything close to spicy.  It is flavorful, and good, though!

Thanks for the great new chili recipe!

This recipe is awesome!
I tried it for the first time and won third place at a chili cook-off. I still bump into people who tell me how much they loved it. I have already shared this recipe with so many others.
Thanks for sharing.

My search for vegetarian chili is over!  I made a mistake on one of the main ingredients, so my finished dish may be a little different, but the ingredients and especially the methods will surely yield a flavorful chili.  Also, wanted to use TVP instead of crumbles, and wanted to re-hydrate the TVP with a flavorful liquid, not just water.  (More on that later.)  So here is what I used, different from the recipe:  one onion; no salt; no celery (didn’t have any); six cloves garlic; no pepper.  For the canned vegetables, I’m old-fashioned about chili and just couldn’t see garbanzo beans and corn, so used two cans chili beans (not drained); one can black beans (well drained/rinsed); one large can whole tomatoes, hand-crushed.  So here’s my mistake:  I used 84 oz (3 x 28) crushed tomatoes instead of 3 - 28 oz cans whole tomatoes, crushed.  So I had a LOT more tomatoes than I was supposed to have!  And on the TVP:  I mixed 3C crushed tomatoes with the chili powder, brought to a boil, and used that to re-hydrate 1.5C TVP.  Followed the recipe's methods.  Anyway, I ended up with a full-to-the-brim six-quart pot of chili.  I really like it; just the right amount of heat for me, altho I may have diluted the spices with my abundance of tomatoes.  (The institution-sized crushed tomatoes are about $3 at Sam’s and don’t have any added sugar… that’s how I ended up 84 oz tomatoes; probably why I mis-read the recipe!)

This was easily one of the best vegetarian chili recipes I've ever tasted, and I've tasted quite a few. One warning -- it is spicy. I only used one jalapeno pepper (instead of two), and slightly less chili powder than the recipe called for. But it was still too spicy for my wife (who is somewhat sensitive to spicy food, but still loved it). I am a HUGE fan of the addition of the veggie burger crumbles -- it added a texture to the dish that you rarely find in vegetarian chili recipes. In short, I will be definitely be adding this one to the rotation.

Due to the amount of oregano, this tastes a little less like chili and a little more like spaghetti sauce.  Next time I'll reverse the quantities so there's more chili powder and less oregano.  That being said, this is a flavorful tasty dish.  Will make again. Thanks for sharing it.

This is hands down the most phenomenal chili I've ever had.  I did tweak it a bit in the following ways:

1) I left out the jalapenos

2) instead of the chopped chilis, I used canned chilis in adobo sauce.  It comes in a 4oz can but I just chopped up two of them and poured a bit of the sauce into the pot.  It adds an amazing smoky flavor.

3) I added two chopped carrots.

4) I cooked it for at least three hours.

5)  I served it with a teaspoon of peanut butter on the side (can't explain it but trust me, it works).

This recipe is solid.  It will for sure become one of those standard, once-a-month, recipes in my kitchen.  If you are looking for a chili recipe, look no further (right? because there are a billion chili recipes out there), this is the one.

Great recipe, although I do agree with other posters who say that it's too spicy as written. I alter the recipe by leaving out the jalepenos, and it's still quite spicy for the first day or so -- the fire tends to cool down after the chili sits in the fridge for a while. But it's still a great way to get tons of low-fat protein and a great mix of veggies. To reduce sodium, I wash off all of the canned stuff (except the tomatoes) before adding it.

WOW. Really  delicious. It's pretty spicy in original form; we haven't even put in jalepeños yet and only put in just under a 1/4 cup of chili powder. This makes a mild chili- but still awesomely flavorful. Last time we made this we forgot to add the garbanzo beans; a mistake we'll probably repeat. To be honest, it doesn't need garbanzo beans. Serve it with grated cheese and onion shavings!

I’m always looking for vegetarian recipes and this one goes to the top of my list as the best.
And now for the sub’s, I don’t care for kidney beans so I used a can of pinto beans.
I also used Bulker Wheat in place of the Vegetarian Burger.
(1-1/2 cups added to 1-1/2 cups boiling water, shut off stir and let sit 15 min.
Thank You so much Anichka

Yum! Served this at a family get-together and it was a hit! I made a few subtle changes - I don't care for green peppers and my hubbie doesn't like corn, so those were omitted. I used one can crushed, 1 can stewed, and 1 can diced tomatoes as that is what I had on hand. I also used garlic powder instead of cloves as I was short on time. Turned out just as good as my usual meaty chili! And I should add that it was super easy to make.

I am not a fan of vegetarian chili.  It's usually too soupy for me and it usually lacks good chili flavor.  I made this last night and it is by far the best chili I've ever had, vegetarian or not.  Excellent recipe.  My husband also loved it!

I made this the other day for my vegetarian boyfriend. He loves it so much that he ate it for lunch, dinner and breakfast! It was so thick and tasty.  I didn't miss the meat at all being an unabashed carnivore myself!   I did slightly modify the recipe. I added a tablespoon of sugar to lessen the acidity of the tomatoes, used canned tomatoes with Basil no salt added, added another jalapeño pepper, and threw in 24 pieces of tortilla chips to deepen the flavor.  I am surprised how much chili this recipe makes.  I told my boyfriend to share it with his friends, but he refused and said it was all for him!  Thank you for this delicious recipe!  :)

Absolutely wonderful!!! The only changes I made was I used an extra can of black beans instead of the kidney beans (I don't like kidney beans), used turkey meat instead of the vegetarian crumbles (I would like try the veggie crumbles, but didn't have them), and fresh corn for the canned. Other than that all else was exactly as written. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!!!

I made this for a chili cook-off with my husband. It was the first chili gone! All those meat eaters loved it! This is by far the best chili I have had. I love the fresh taste it has with the variety of ingredients...it for sure looks the best..chili doesn't look to great most of the time. My husband doesn't like the canned taste of the tomatoes, so he wants me to try fresh ones next time. This really is the best!

This was the first vegetarian chili recipe I tried and it's the only chili I'll ever make.  It definitely lives up to the title on the recipe.  Even my meat loving family members enjoyed it very much.  It is great as is, but I also like to add some worcestershire sauce.  It also tastes good with cheddar cheese.

This IS the best Veggie Chili in the World! I always cut the recipe in half because it is so large. However, the last time I made this I did not cut the beans or corn in half. I used the full cans. Gave it more substance!

I love this recipe!  I made it for a non-vegetarian and she couldn't believe there was no meat.  We were so busy talking that I neglected to add chili powder and it still tasted great!  Of course, we garnished it w/the powder when I realized what happened.  I will definitely be making this again!

A great alternative to meaty chili.  My vegetarian cousin loved it. For personal taste, I omitted the jalapeno & chili peppers & celery, & used one package of vegetarian burger crumbles. Excellent when topped with cheese & sour cream.

This chili is fantastic.  I made it twice in the last week - once for a potluck with ground turkey and once at home with ground beef.  I would never have thought to put garbanzos in a chili, but it's fantastic.  The chili powder seemed like a lot, but the end result was a very mild chili - one my six-year-old son was able to eat without complaint.  Thank you - this is my "from now on" chili recipe!

I served this at a dinner party and thought it was quite tasty - but definitely TOO spicy...and I left out the chiles! I would recommend decreasing the chili powder to only 1 or 2 tablespoons so the spice doesn't overwhelm the dish. Other than that it was a fabulous and versatile recipe. You can add extra veggies - I threw in some choppped zucchini and mushrooms - and use whatever beans suit your taste...I used pinto, kidney, garbanzo and great northern beans. Great with cornbread! And if you're looking for an appetizer, loaded nachos seems to be a great compliment!

Absolutely fabulous!  I really enjoyed this, even as a usual meat eater.  I used canned tomatoes and less chili powder for a bit tamer flavor. So good that it will probably replace my usual meat one.

I made this for my mother in law who is a vegetarian.  It was much better than I expected and I would even make it again if she wasn't coming for dinner.  Great flavor.  I did cut the chili powder back to 3 tablespoons.

This chili is SO good. I'm not even a chili type person, I almost never eat it and I've never made it before this. This is DEFINATELY worth making and trying. Kind of hard to screw up and you don't need the exact amount of each ingredient to have it taste good.

I used real meat and no spicy peppers, and only 1 can of tomatoes. Also instead of chick peas I used another can of black beans.

This really is the best vegetarian chili I've ever had and I'm pretty picky. It was pretty simple to make as well. I accidentally made it without chili powder and it still came out pretty spicy and good.

This is a great chili and was a hit with all of my friends, vegetarian and non-veggie alike.  I added a lot more cumin than recommended but otherwise followed the recipes exactly.

I changed this up a little. I started out with the base of this chili, but   I used 1 can of organic kidney beans and 1 of navy. My family isn't big on black beans or chick peas. I omitted the jalepenos and used 1 can of the chiles. (Family likes it hot, I like it spicy, but able to be eaten)   
They also like a red chili. I added one large can of diced fire roasted organic tomatos, and one can organic tomato paste, to it I added 2 1/2 cups water.  Used the spices called for.  This had just enough "warmth" from the peppers, and a very good taste..I'll be making it again.   
Thanks for the great base!

Very tasty, made it for the first time yesterday.  I changed the recipe, and used 2 diced can tomatoes with juice. at the same time I added the hamburger crumbles.  Used only one hot pepper, eliminated the green chilies.  Added some water and one cup of soup stock to boil and simmer.

I just made and ate this.  It was very tasty.  It was fun to make because it smelled so good at the start while softening the onions and adding the spices.  I only used about half the salt.  For the tomatoes, I used two 15 oz. cans of crushed tomatoes.  I rinsed all the beans to cut down on salt.  I probably added about 4 cups of water during the simmering to soup it up a little.  When serving, I topped it with shredded Mexican cheese.  I served it with hard, crusty bread.  This is a great veggie chili--hardy and healthy!

oh yum! my whole family really enjoyed this chili.  i'll definitely be making it again.  i used chili powder from a local indian grocery store, and i think that might've made it too spicy.  next time, i'll try using chili powder from the neighborhood grocery store.  but besides that, it was perfect!  thank u for the recipe. :)

Turned out fantastic! I added one additional can of kidney beans as this recipe makes a ton of chili and the additional can just added to the heartiness of the dish.

I loved this recipe. Was going to double it so started out with twice the spices, onion, and green pepper before I realized I didn’t have a pot big enough to fit the double recipe. So good, even with the double spices. Will keep this one forever.

This is a very good recipe. I did make a couple changes...Remove veggie crumbles to make it vegan. Use a can of whole peeled tomatoes and crush by hand to give it a meaty texture.

This was a flavourful chilli, but it was too spicy.  We left out the cans of chilli and it was still so spicy I couldn’t finish it because I ran out of crackers, cheese and sour cream to cut the heat.  And it’s not that I don’t like spicy food.  I’m from Louisiana.  We eat spicy a lot, but this I couldn’t do.

This was delicious! I altered a couple of things.  I did one green pepper and one red pepper .  I only used one jalapeno because I had a 4oz jar of mixed peppers and chilies that I canned last year so I threw that in.  The amount of oregano seemed high to me so I only used one tablespoon.  Glad I did that because I can taste it.  I like spicy but this was just a little spicier than I like so next time I would cut back just a tad on the chili powder and cumin.  This recipe is definitely a keeper

this chili is amazing! I used one pound of beyond beef and used a dry pea, bean and lentil mix I picked up from costco (just over 2 cups dry, which I let soak for about 8 hours then cooked according to directions). there is just enough salt, and the pepper/chili powder add enough spice without the jalapeno. i love spice, but my kids are a little more sensitive, and it's easy enough to throw some jalapenos on top afterward. I will be adding this recipe to my favorites!

This was awesome! Did not miss the meat at all! I will make this again for sure. A few changes I made for what I had on hand: I did not have or use the burger crumbles, I forgot to add the garlic and added it after the tomatoes, but that worked. I used fresh corn off the cob and put it in at the very end to simmer about 8-10 minutes. You didn't even need cornbread, the fresh corn was excellent! I used only 2 10 oz cans of tomato with green chili and 1 can of Don Pepino sauce because it's what I had on hand. I used 1 can each of red pinto, black and white cannellini beans which gave it a great appearance . I added some shredded colby jack cheese and green onion to serve. My son even had 2 helpings! Love this!!

Great to take to super bowl party. Like others have said, it is plenty hot with one jalapeno and one can chili peppers. I also used one teaspoon salt (was 1 Tablespoon a typo?), 1 package crumbles, a whole onion, and an extra celery stalk. I substituted an orange pepper for one of the green peppers, and added a zucchini. Yummy!

This recipe is Awesome! My husband and I do have some health issues so I used half of the salt and less than half of the chili powder because we can only tolerate a mild spicy flavor, but it still has a full bodied flavor and spicy enough for us. I’m very impressed! Thank you for sharing!

Fantastic recipe. Didn't add the jalapeños but used chili flakes instead and it turned out great. Let is simmer for about 3 hours also so flavors would mix.

This is one delicious recipe! I wait till the end to add the groundless beef, split the pot and make half vegetarian and half with beef to satisfy everyone in our family. Both are equally successful.  I also freeze leftovers in small containers and defrost as needed. It tastes just as good even after a couple of weeks!

I minced Portabella Mushrooms and sautéed them with the onions instead of the vegetarian burger. I also used fresh green chili’s instead of canned and only half as much. I also cooked it in  my slow cooker for about 4 hours.  It came out really well Even my pickiest of eaters came back for seconds.

Excellent recipe!  I followed it with the following adjustments based on feedback: I did not add any salt and I rinsed all of the canned beans and corn to reduce the salt.  I removed the seeds from the fresh jalapeños to avoid it being too spicy. And finally I added a small handful of chocolate chips, as one of the other reviewers commented, it ties together and smooths out the flavors.

I don't usually leave reviews, but the most helpful one I read while making  this chili came from a reviewer who also "never leaves reviews", and since it is a good amount of work and ingredients, but definitely worth it with  some small clarifications/modifications, I decided to pay it forward ;)

The 1/4 cup chili powder is what sparked my deep dive into the comments. Reviewers (thank you!) noted it was wayyy to spicy, and recommend using chili powder to taste (start with 1/2 teaspoon and work your way up if needed - I ended there); they also recommended using 1 jalepeno vs 2 (I removed about 50% of the seeds and left some for the jalepeno punch), and I opted for 1 can of (rinsed!) green chiles vs. 2 cans.  Now that I had the spice issue under control, I worked on the salt. 1 tbsp of salt is a lot of salt, so I just started with a few turns on the grinder and it was just enough. I also used the no salt added version of whole peeled tomatoes (2 cans vs 3), and fully rinsed all canned beans (and chilis...and the corn at the end). For the tomatoes, the recipe owner made an update I'm glad I stumbled on - remove the whole tomatoes from the can, crush them by hand, and add back to can. Pour all contents of cans into pot. This is important because you need the liquid. For the "meat crumbles" Gardein makes 12oz bags of meatballs, I started with 2 bags (24 meatballs) but only ended up using about 15, cut into 8ths. Lastly another reviewer recommended using 8 oz of vegetable stock t

I thought it was very good however I like chili a bit thicker so added an extra can of beans and a little bit of corn meal. Also, did not add the burger crumbles, just all veggies. I thought it had a good amount of kick/heat, but not too much. I will be making this again!

I made this for an office chili cook off. Every work event lacks a vegetarian option, so I brought my own. It was one of the most popular of the line up. I followed the recipe, but after tasting, decided to add two squares of dark chocolate with Hatch chili. That gave it the extra kick I was looking for for. And a hint of sweetness.

It is good, easy to make and reasonably wholesome. Regarding the critical reviews - too spicy, too bland, too salty - this is because canned ingredients vary. Some of us used salted tomatoes, other unsalted. Some canned green chilies are pretty mild, others are as hot as jalapenos. Some canned beans are really really salty, too. So, using canned ingredients one might, perhaps, mix all the cans in then taste it and see before dumping in a tablespoon of salt or a quarter cup of chili powder - which varies from brand to brand, too.

We love this recipe.  We make it in a crock pot and eat it for 3 days!  We make it once a week now.  I like it a little hotter then my wife so I add a little siracha once in a while.  The first time you make it, don't change a thing!

Long time Allrecipes user, first review.  This was sooo good!  Added okra and some quinoa because I was short on the vegetarian crumbles, also doubled the chili powder and cumin per other reviewers' recommendations.  Can't wait for leftovers tonight.  My husband, who makes great chili, and is a meat eater, was impressed by this too.  Thank you!

Oh my goodness this is spicey. I saw this coming and followed the recipie and cut down almost all the spice to about a quarter of the amount but beware it is still extremely spicey. As far as flavours for the chilli go I found it lacking quite a bit it was just spicey and saltey.  Will not be remaking it.

Unbelievably good!
  Every spoonful had me saying "Oh my gosh, this may be the best chile I've ever had".
I used two cans diced and one can crushed tomatoes. 
I also had a medley of garden fresh peppers in the olive oil with the onion -orange and red bell, green and red Thai,  green and red cayenne, and half an orange habanero. And I threw in some whole cloves of black garlic that didn't pack much punch to begin with. I didn't have celery so I used carrots. 
I joined this site just so I could review this chile. Thank you for the recipe!

I started making this a few years ago and have been making it ever since! I never put the celery in it and double up on jalapeños. Sometimes add pinto beans. Have made with or without meatless crumbles and have made it with ground deer meat. Such a great recipe!!!!

This is definitely a keeper. I skipped the celery, because I personally don't like it, and added a zucchini because I had it. Drained all beans and rinsed well. I will use dry beans next time, but I didn't plan well enough in advance this time around. Topped with grated cheddar and a dollop of sour cream.  None of us (family with 2 teens) thought it was too spicy and I may even add a bit next time. I think, as other reviewers have said, it's best to taste test, particularly as you add the chili powder. Oh, and I used Morning Star veggie scrambles, which we all prefer to other brands.

This chili was absolutely amazing.  My mom made it so that I would have something quick to pull out of the freezer when I'm visiting my parents' house.  She did make a few changes to the recipe which in my opinion were good changes.  She left out the meat replacement crumble as I am not a fan of processed foods and meat replacements, left out the tablespoon of salt (really who needs that much salt?), she also left out the jalapeno peppers so that it wasn't too spicy for my brother's children - at dinner time I just added a ton of red pepper flakes to my bowl because I love spicy food.  She used 1 can whole crushed tomatoes and 3 cans of diced tomatoes instead of what the recipe called for, rinsed the beans VERY well and also added mushrooms and 3 more tbsp of chili powder.

The chili ended up delicious and thick and was well loved by everyone, even the meat eaters in the family!  Don't be fooled by the "8 servings" listed on the recipe, unless you want to eat a serving that would fill a mixing bowl - this definitely ended up being more like 20 servings.  And there's nothing wrong with that because now there will always be chili in the freezer!

On the sodium note: with the changes my mom made it brought the sodium per serving down to ~450 which is much better than 1600-2500!!  You could cut the sodium down even more by using cans of beans and tomatoes labeled with "no added sodium."

Great recipe! Makes a huge amount. I made a double batch of step 1(onions, seasoning, veggies) and froze them in smaller packs. I just add 1 large 28 oz can of tomatoes and 2 cans of beans and let it cook for 45 minutes. Turns out great. I had to add extra chili to it though, thought it wasnt spicy enough. Also, i increased the amount of cumin.

I've made this a couple times now. I love eating it with fresh avocado as a garnish because I make it so spicy that it needs something to tame the heat. I put extra jalapeños and use habanero chili powder, with all different colors of bell peppers instead of celery. I also add a can of white beans and serve with cilantro sprinkled over the top. (If its for a party I serve with fresh chopped white onion, fritos, cheese, cilantro, and sour cream. When I served this at a camping party, alongside an award winning chili with meat, this vegetarian actually won the taste test !!

I LOVE this recipe and have made it for my office mates many times. One thing I did change was adding eggplant instead of the veggie burger.  It has the same consistency as meat, almost, and adds an extra texture. I also substituted pinto beans for the garbanzo's, just because. I garnish with Cotijo Cheese and serve with Mexican corn bread.

New to vegetarian life, and made this. Very flavorful! I noted many reviews that mentioned it was too spicy, so I only used one jalapeño. I also did not use the burger crumbles as I couldn't find them. Overall quite good, and my son liked it too. Will make again. Thank you for the recipe!

Excellent recipe, thanks! I was surprised by the amount of oregano: not a spice I generally like but really works here as a dominant spice. Like others, I upped the cumin a bit. I left out the crumbled vege-burgers and it worked fine... we find that kind of super-processed soy "meat" stuff hard to digest, and not economical anyway. 

I pressure-cook my own beans which was tricky because they had to be pre-cooked separately, since chick-peas take way longer than black beans, and kidney beans in-between. 

I also skipped the canned green chile's and opted for ground mulato peppers, (they're not hot)  which also absorb more liquid and add a richer dark hue.

This recipe lives up to it's name! I've made this so many times, and every time it doesn't disappoint. I've served it to meat-eaters and they loved it, some not even realizing the "meat" wasn't real meat! I've put it before picky children, and they too, loved it! Definite crowd-pleaser and my go-to chili recipe.

Way too much tomato in this chilli. I was very skeptical when the recipe called for three large cans of crushed tomato but I decided to trust the recipe and just went against my instincts. Major disappointment!

I love how good it is and its hard to find a good vegetarian chili. I find the spice just a bit shy and so we added four jalapenos and seeds to it and it was prefect. If your family likes spicy than go for it :)

This recipe has WON my workplace's annual chili cook off two years in a row - and my coworkers are mostly meat-eaters! I've never met anyone who doesn't love this chili. It is quite literally the *best* in the world! I've shared the recipe multiple times because I don't believe in "secret" recipes... especially when I get them off the internet. LOL Thanks to whoever originally posted it!!

So good.  Even my carnivorous husband loves this!  To make it even healthier (and equally delicious), I double up the kidney and black beans and skip the garbanzo beans and corn and add lots of cookable greens (e.g., spinach, kale).  I cut back on the crushed tomatoes and add veggie broth because I find it a bit thick.  I double up the garlic (because garlic) and add cayenne pepper to make it extra spicy.  Also I cook it in a pot and then dump it in a slow cooker.  Even better after all the flavors soak together for a few hours.

This recipe makes ALOT.  In fact, I had to leave out one of the packages of crumbles in order for it to fit it into my pot.  I found this recipe to be very spicy, and I even omitted the jalapeño peppers. But my daughter-in-law, who 
Iikes spicy things, added red pepper and hot sauce to hers. So for someone like her the jalapeño peppers would have been fine. The only other thing I changed was to use diced tomatoes instead of whole.  I think this is a good recipe, but if I make it again I will reduce the cumin and chili powder. This is just personal preference.

Best chili recipe I've ever made.  I halfed the recipe which was easy. I may have accidentally added more chili powder than called for (halfed remember?) & used real hamburger, which I don't think mattered one bit.  I wanted to eat 5 bowls in one sitting, which was not appropriate, but it's that good!

This has been my go-to crowd pleaser for years.  I follow the recipe as is and ALWAYS receive a ton of compliments.  Thank you!  Once I swapped the boca crumbles with 2 packages of ground turkey.  It worked perfectly!  For a crowd I like to put out little bowls of sour cream, chives, shredded cheddar, and cornbread.  YUM

I prepare this recipe every two weeks freezing half upon completion so it can last.
My variation is this, mix your favorite chili powders to archive 1/4 cup... I do an 1/8 regular and 1/8 chipotle.
Lastly, but most importantly, I recommend 1 tsp of black pepper instead, you can work your way up from there.
Enjoy!

I made this for my daughter, who decided she'd like to try to eat without eating meat for a while....it was DELICIOUS for all of us!! We never missed the meat & thoroughly enjoyed the medley of beans with a bit of spice!  It's cheaper than canned, & much more heartier!  Give it a try! You won't be disapointed!

Really enjoyed this recipe. My first time to eat veggie crumbles- loved them. I do not like my food very spicy so this first time I started with half a jalapeño, I may try one whole next time. I added frozen corn, and fresh carrots. Perfect!

Great recipe.  I made only 3 changes.  I substituted one can with regular crushed tomatoes (i had them in pantry), cut chili powder in half because of other review (but added back some cayenne pepper later), and used 24 oz of drained lean hamburger, because I was afraid of fake burger stuff.  So instead of being Vegan, it's now Megan. A little cheddar, raw onions and dollop of sour cream.

This was a hit with my vegetarian boyfriend and his daughter.  I really liked it too.  I left out the jalapeño and chile pepper because of the little one being sensitive to spicy food.  I added about a teaspoon of sugar to take out some of the bitterness from the tomatoes.

I make this chili a couple times annually.  I don't include garbanzo beans. I substituted them for crowder peas. I did not include the corn this time and I usually use one jalapeño pepper instead of two.

First time I've ever made chili and decided for vegetarian.  I am so happy I did.  This recipe was a hit even with the meat eaters at our football party.  (they had no idea)  Very flavorful, the right amount of spice (I only had one jalapeno pepper and could not buy the roaster green chiles) I will recommend this recipe to all my friends and family.  Thank you for sharing!!!

Indeed the best vegetarian chili in the world! There's alot of room to customize, so here's what I did:  Used 2 cans (28 oz) crushed tomatoes and 1 can fire roasted diced tomatoes; used all spices as listed and added chipotle Tabasco sauce to taste; only used 1/2 bag crumbles as that's all I had on hand.  FAB-U-LOUS!!!  Better each day is sat in the frig! Had portioned some out to freeze as it makes a TON of chili, but it all got eaten before any made it to the freezer! My vegetarian daughter ate it for lunch and dinner during her school break for 4 days in a row. Will definitely make again!

Phenomenal--THE best chili you will ever put in your mouth. EVER! My husband devoured it. I also made sweet cornbread from scratch and the two went together perfectly! Try it. You won't be disappointed!!!

I also add matchstick carrots, cilantro, & flat parsley. I also use morning star breakfast sausage patties, rather than the crumbles the recipe calls for. I add a good amount of bourbon & some red wine - even the meat eaters in my house prefer this chili over regular chili!

I don't use processed soy so I subbed mushrooms, and I added a chipotle pepper and all of the adobo sauce in the can. Delicious!  I know the original way would have been too, but I had that partial can of chipotles in adobo in my fridge .... waste not, want not lol. Looking forward to dinner!Thanks!

I just made this chili and my husband loves it!  I am going to enter it into a chili cook off at our church later this month and made a batch to try it.  I used two extra large jalapeño peppers, hot fire-roasted green chile peppers, Boca Crumbles, Tajin Clasico Seasoning for the chili powder and small red beans for the kidney beans.  Evidently the chili cook off entries last year "needed more heat".  I think this will be a fun entry.  Thank you!

This was amazing. Instead of veggie crumbles, I smooshed up a block of tofu and dry-fried it for a while to get it really ready to absorb the spices. Added a great texture. I didn't have enough chili powder but I'll be better prepared next time! Also, two fresh pasilla peppers in addition to the two fresh jalapenos, and I used 3 or 4 fresh bay leaves because I didn't have any dried ones. Fresh ones are less effective.  Used frozen corn like others who commented.

Seriously the best!!! Just the right amount of spice level for me. I didn't find it too hot at all, but definitely spicy. The only mistake I made is not reading the opening line about needing a big soup pot! You want the biggest pot you got. YUM!

I wanted to try this recipe but didn't have all - but most - ingredients on hand. I also wanted to start by making a half batch since it makes so much. I'm happy to say that it turned out delicious! I omitted the veggie burger crumbs (didn't have and never use), corn, kidney beans, and oregano (don't like oregano). I used canned chopped jalapeno peppers and the remaining open can of chopped green chilies used to make a salsa. I served the chili over brown rice (rice + beans = complete protein) topped with a fresh quick homemade salsa(fresh chopped tomatoes, chopped onion, canned green chilies, salt & pepper to taste) and a fresh green salad on the side tossed with a balsamic vinegar dressing. Great meal! Thanks for the recipe! (Like most chili recipes, the ingredients do not have to be exact and can be tweaked to your preference.)  NOTE: I made chili early in the day and put in the crock pot.

I've been making a modified version of this chile since 2007. I had to modified it mostly because my chile powder (Tones) already included oregano so 2 Tbs was too much. I use 2 tsp each of cumin, oregano, salt. Since I love onion & garlic I use a whole onion and 4 large garlic cloves. For the green chiles I like to buy about 1 lb fresh & blacken myself under the broiler, put in a glass bowl with plastic on top, wrap in a towel for at least 15 min. then remove peel, seeds and stem and chop up. Never needed to add jalapeño because the other chiles had enough heat. I felt 2 cans of tomatoes was plenty. Before becoming a vegetarian I would add 2 lbs of ground turkey and this was a killer recipe but I turned vegetarian this year and so today I will attempt the recipe without turkey or crumbles, just beans ...maybe I'll try adding some quinoa!!!

This is my go to chili recipe. The flavor is amazing! I add barley to my version and I also do not add any jalapeños. Without the jalapeños the spice is decreased. If you add the barley be sure to boil it in a separate pot and add after it is soft. Otherwise, it will suck up all the liquid in the chili. :) Happy cooking!

Brought this chili it to a pot luck, received a lot of compliments. Gave 4 stars as I altered it so much: left out jalapenos and added I can of tomato paste and left out two cans of tomatoes and green peppers.  The basic spices are what I believe makes this chili so popular, I wanted mine thicker, less spicy-hot and more tomatoey. I also added 4 veggie burgers as opposed to two which helped make this a thick chili. We did not need bowls to serve it, it was a side dish that didn't run all over the rest of the meal. A low fat, very healthy alternative to traditional chili that I plan to make again and again.  As I'm not a huge fan of corn in my chili I'll omit it in the future. A great and easy recipe. throw ingredients in a crock pot and go!

This was so good! I have made this twice. The first time I made it true to the recipe. It is five star! Now the second time I didn't add any veggie burgers. I added cauliflower ( shredded ) and zucchini. I turned the burner really low and let it go a couple of hours. I used half the spice as my hubby likes a more mild chili. OMG! Still a five star!

I added half teaspoon of chili powder and it was spicy enough for us. I also ommited 2 cans of green chili peppers and used only 1 jalapeno pepper (all seeds scraped). 
Chili turned out really good. I made it three times already and everybody loved it. Some people did not even notice it was a vegetarian dish. They thouhgt i was using ground beef.

We loved this recipe!!! The flavor and spice was amazing. However, instead of the celery and burger crumbles, we just did Black, Kidney and Great Northern beans and the result was AMAZING! I just remade it for my grandparents (who can't handle spice at all) and only did 1/2 of a jalapeno and took out 1 tbsp on chili powder and 1/4 tsp of the cumin. We all loved it!!!

Sadly, I'm a not-so-good cook :( I made this chili today (with half the amount of jalapeño for my 8 year old) and it came out beautifully! Fresh and delicious ~ even my meat eating husband who prefers peanut butter and jelly to my cooking, loved it! Thanks so much for this "anyone can do it" recipe!!!

Excellent recipe. I'm pretty much the farthest thing from a vegetarian but this recipe is great! I did have to cut down on the heat to suit my tastes.

Absolute perfection! My sister shared some of this chilli with me a month ago, I tried not to hold back a laugh when she said it was vegitarian. I politely agreed to try a bowl , and WOW, perfect heat, perfect ratio of veggies to beans, perfect. That was the beginning of my search into vegan lifestyle . I thought that if I can eat food this good then I could see myself as vegan , thanks for this great recipe! It was the start of a healthier lifestyle for me :)

We loved this Chili, even the Carnivores in my house.  However, just as another review noted,  I too believe the original recipe has too many hot peppers.  The first batch I needed to temper with sugar and serve with sour cream.  Next batch I only added 1 jalapeño and 1 can of diced chilies...much better.

I love cooking in my crockpot, so that's exactly what I did with this recipe. I'm not a vegetarian, but also not a huge meat eater so this was perfect. My husband is a steak and potatoes kind of guy and had no idea the "meatless meat" wasn't ground beef. I browned the meat substitute before adding to crockpot, but otherwise, threw it all in and cooked on low for 7-8 hrs. I came home from work and my husband was polishing off his second bowl. LOVED this!

I have a pot of this chili on the stovetop right now. First real vegetarian dinner I have ever made.  I halved the recipe and swapped the black beans and garbonzo beans for pinto and great northern white beans (my favorites). I think a good recipe allows for adjustments based on personal preference and this recipe does that - if you don't like it hot, omit the jalepeno and add a little bit of the chili peppers then taste it. Taste test was awesome. I did not use the jalepeno and used only 1/2 of the green chiles (after halving the recipe). I think I am going to try to get my DH to eat this without telling him there is no beef in it. We both need to cut choleterol; this is a great recipe to help with that.

We'll make this one again w modifications. I used extra lean ground beef instead of the veggie crumbles and used a whole onion - all tasting great. Chili powder was a bit overpowering for our taste, so I might up the cumin/oregano a bit and cut chili powder down a couple tablespoons. It had great color and a nice depth of flavor.

I like this recipe but it was WAY TOO SPICY.  I'm not an adventurous cook and follow recipes exactly.  I've never used jalepeno peppers before and was told afterward that I should have taken the seeds out of the jalepenos and then it wouldn't have been so spicy.  The recipe needs to state "seeded" for beginners like me.

I have made this several times. I make a couple of minor changes. I use pinto beans in place of the garbonzos. They just seem more chili appropriate to me. And I only use one package of the veggie crumbles and add a second can of corn. I've made this for potlucks at school and people ALWAYS ask me for the recipe. Even meat-eaters can't get enough. The only thing I would say is that it makes a lot more than 8 servings. I usually have some leftover to freeze because we can't finish it all! We LOVE IT!! So yummy :)And to the people complaining that it's too spicy, just omit the jalapenos and maybe cut the chili powder down a little. But I like it hot.

I've made this several times.  It is delicious and even great as a dip for tortilla chips.  I like adding some cheese to the top and recommend being careful with the jalapeno peppers.  Sometimes the peppers we pick up are not that spicy and other times they are very spicy.  We test them before putting them in and only use one if they are very spicy :)

I love this recipe!  I made it at least 5 times this winter and it was a hit each time.  The first time I made it, I did it exactly as written (minus the jalapeno - we have a little one.) The green peppers were a little hard, and I thought it was a little spicy with 2 cans of green chile peppers.  The subsequent times, I put the green peppers and celery in with the onions at the beginning to saute and just used 1 can of green chiles.  I also don't think it's necessary to add the corn at the end - adding it with everything else works fine too!

Fantastic recipe! I made a few changes, no cans of green peppers, and I added a sliced up squash to mine. Very spicy and very delicious. I will definitely make it again.

UPDATE:
Since my first review I have updated a few things when it comes to making this chili... First of all, the rice is a must!  I usually make brown rice on the side and then when everything is done I mix the two.  I cut out the kidney beans and add an extra can of garbanzo beans (but that is just personal preference).  Also, in my first review, I stated that the sodium content was alarming.  I have since noticed that most of the canned goods used in this recipe come in a "low sodium" version, which I have started to use.  I love this chili.  It is delicious.  You should definitely make it!


ATTENTION! This recipe makes A TON of chili... much more than 8 servings, in my opinion. I used my biggest pot and it was almost overflowing! Next time I will definiely only make half as much, considering it is just my boyfriend and I. I stuck exactly to the recipe and I will say it is pretty spicy. I like spicy, but it was almost too much for me to handle. I plan on having this for dinner tonight, again, but will probably pure it over some rice. I liked this chili a lot, but the sodium content is a little alarming, so i don't know how often i will make it...

Delicious! Used only one jalapeno and the heat level was just right, but needed a bit more cumin and chili powder. Flavour develops as simmers and easy to adjust seasoning to taste. Made a separate pan of fried ground beef for our meat-eating boys to add in. Served with a dollop of sour cream on top and everyone was happy! Easy, delicious recipe.

Pretty spicy stuff although it is mighty tasty.. I served with corn tortilla rounds (I saw this presentation at a nyc restaurant).. I also shredded cheddar on top. The chips and cheese help calm the spicyness..

OH MY GOSH. I'm usually not a fan of veggie chili, but this was really easy and REALLY tasty.  It tastes like it has meat in it. Very flavorful and makes a lot more than 8 servings! We made this for a soup style kitchen..got rave reviews. Served it with some cornbread (with added creamed corn to the mix). Delish! Thanks for sharing :)

first chili i ever made--some modifications..

1. sub'd jar of pre-diced green chiles supposedly for indian dish.. 
2. sub'd chopped dried chipotle peppers instead of chili powder
3. 1 jalepeno instead of 2
4. did not use meat/meat substitute because gf doesn't believe in them?
5. was stewing sauce/veggies and cooking beans* separately.. 

i had bought dry beans--did not anticipate the soaking/etc required for them.. had to do quick pre-soak, 10 min boil, and bake them in covered dutch oven @ 325 deg, for 2 hrs... then added to stewing sauce. supposedly smelled lovely to girlfriend. threw in frozen corn kernels and stirred. just fantastic. submitting to work chili contest tomorrow--hope i win! thanks for this recipe!!

This was absolutely amazing!

Not only is it vegetarian, but if you use Boca Crumbles, it can actually be vegan. With that said, it is absolutely a recipe that vegans, vegetarians, and meat lovers alike will adore. It's hearty and filling, fairly quick and easy to cook, and makes a ton of servings.

I brought a crockpot full of this to a potluck and still had some left for myself at home. I served with Italian bread and shredded Mexican cheese on the side. 

Just a note, based on my own taste and what I had in the kitchen, I made these changes: no bay leaves, no celery, no chile peppers; instead of garlic cloves I used a few tbsp of store-bought minced garlic, instead of garbanzo beans I used pinto, frozen corn instead of canned; and I used Boca brand crumbles. not a big deal, just thought I'd note, it's definitely an easy recipe to alter based on your own taste!

I thought recipe was near perfect, but my biggest suggestion is to increase the beans by at least 1.5 if not double. Also, I added about 1/2 cup of half-boiled multigrain macaroni for a more filling dish, but that's completely optional. It was fantastic with seasoned french bread and a little sharp chedder on top. Thanks for the recipe!

I have been making a veggie chili identical to this for a few years. It is fabulous. I have read reviews from those that find it too spicey, and I wonder if they are putting the seeds from the jalapenos in the pot. I actually use Sereno peppers, which are much more intense but taste wonderful. The great thing about this recipe is that it is hard to screw up. I use 3 different beans (black, kidney, & garbonzo), one can each, and fresh basil (fabulous!) The cans of green chilis are a must. If you don't like it hot, just buy the mild. But do put them in. I also dash in some green salsa. Put the bell peppers in at the end or they get mushy. Also, I have thrown in broccoli, mushrooms, and/or zucchini.

This was delicious! Makes a large amount...I had to put it in my slow cooker because I didnt have a big enough pot. I just cooked it on high, it took a little longer to cook but turned out fine. Very spicy so if you dont like a lot of spice maybe just half the jalapeno and chili powder. Overall excellent, will make again!

Wow! Taking the extra time to sweat the vegetables with the spices brings out their flavors and makes a wonderful blend. I used only 1/4 TEASPOON chili powder, not 1/4 CUP as stated in the recipe.. I suspect this is an error, because my chili was plenty spicy!

Tastes even better the next day!  I won the People's Choice Award in my office's Chili Cook-off with this recipe.  I think the veggie burgers really give this chili a unique flavor and a lot of body.  I put in about 1/2 the salt and about 1/4 of the cumin.  I'm not a huge cumin fan because it tends to overwhelm a dish.  We'll definitely make this one again.  YUMMY!!

Really delicious.  We used a can of rotel instead of tomatoes.  3 cans of black beans, one of chilli beans instead of other beans,  we adjusted the spices a little and used taco filling ( from the box) instead of crumbles.. I like the texture better.  Delicious!

This chili is awesome IF you leave out the rubber band-like veggie crumbles.  Without them, it's near perfect, and retains a nice red color instead of looking brownish.  Have made this at least once for each of the past four years...I mean football seasons.

I am not the greatest cook, but I've made this about 3 times in the past month have gotten rave reviews from my entire family.
My husband is a pro-level hobby chef and he thinks its one of the best dishes I've made in 30 years of marriage.
I added a chopped poblano pepper to the veggie mix, and also let the spices cook a little more to get some " smoke" in them.
This is just a great recipe.  I'd like to try it with ground turkey or chicken as well.

I've cooked this recipe a few times and even won a chili cooking contest competing against non-vegetarian chilis!  I think 3 - 28 ounce cans of tomoatoes makes it too sweet, so I only use 2.  I also left out the bell peppers because I don't really like them and added some other veggies + some pasta.

Delicious! Here are my notes:

-Some people have said this is too spicy. It really isn't! Be sure you are cutting the white vein and seeds out of the jalapenos - that's where the heat is.

-Drain the cans of corn, green chiles, and garbanzo beans. Keep the liquid from the tomatoes, kidney beans, and black beans.

-Start with half the amount of salt in the recipe and add according to taste after the recipe is complete.

-Stir often! Veggie crumbles stick to bottom of pot. If they do get stuck, lower heat and they should soften and come up.

-To save on fat and calories, I used a half cup of water at beginning to cook onions instead of oil.

Great. Changed it slightly...just used crushed red pepper  powder instead of all the other peppers. Also made basmati rice for it, mixed it with the rice. Shredded cheddar on top.

18 month old toddler loved it!

This came out amazing! I typically do not like the taste of fake meat, so I took that out and substituted sweet potatoes, mushrooms, cabbage, and carrots to make it a little thicker. To offset the sweet and starch I added lemon juice, extra spices and jalapeno paste made in the food processor. I also used fresh tomatoes. I will definitely make this again!

This chili is so very good!  I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I only had one green pepper so I used a yellow pepper also. I was afraid the recipe would be too spicy so I only put in one can of green chilis and one jalapeno, will definitely put in the 2 jalapenos next time. 4 cloves of garlic instead of 3, because we love garlic, could even use more in my opinion.  Didn't have the Garbanzo beans so I sub another can of kidney beans, and used lots of frozen corn instead of canned.  This recipe tasted so good last night, I can wait to try the left overs at lunch!Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us!!!!!

Delicious! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! As someone trying to eat more veggies I tend to be pretty skeptical of veggie versions of classic meat dishes but this is good enough to rival most other chili dishes I've had.

This recipe was delicious! I added 2 medium sweet potatoes and made it even better! Just add peeled,chopped sweet potato with celery and follow the rest of the recipe! I also added more onion,green pepper and spices than it asked for! And only added one package of Boca Crumbles. Even all my meat-eater friends LOVED IT!

I honestly expected more. It was good in theory but NOT spicy by my standards (despite those who claim it is "too spicy"..I can't imagine what they consider bland...and I even added extra heat. It was sort of bland and I thought it tasted too much like oregano and bay leaves..I have been vegetarian for 10 years too, so it isn't a dislike of vegetables.

It was my first time making chilli. The recipe is super easy to follow. Instead of adding canned beans I used fresh beans (soaked them over night). I also added ground oregano.

Just not my taste. We aren't ready to venture into the world of vegetarian burger crumbles, so I left those out. I also had to tone down the spice to accommodate the kids. I will try other recipes before I try to adapt this one.

Excellent!  The only thing I did differently was to "toast" the chili powder with the veggies before adding the tomatoes.  Really, really good!

This is incredible! I didn't have 3 large cans of crushed tomatoes (only one), so I used a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes and 14 oz can of tomato sauce plus a little bit of sofrito (about 2-3 Tbsp).  I added a little red wine, red chili powder (for extra spice!), a little white sugar and some unsweetended cocoa powder.  It was amazing! Try it with Absolute Mexican Corn Bread from this site.

This is great! Yes, it's spicy but you can cut back on the chili powder to taste. I suggest half as much until you see how it suits you. I made it just as the recipe called and it's HOT. I like it HOT!!!! Serves more than 8, more like 12. This recipe will be repeated in my home.

Great chili! First time ever making it and it came out fantastic! A little too slaty for me, may cut it back next time. Love how healthy and filling this is. Will be making this again and again. Thanks!

Made this tonight, and the husband loved it - said it was not only the best vegetarian chili, but the best chili there is :) 

The only changes I made to the recipe is that I took out one can of beans and one can of tomatoes since my husband doesn't like beans that much, and I wanted a pretty thick chili.  I did not find this too spicy for my tastes, but I did de-seed the jalapenos.

This was great chili especially with cheese and crackers! It is hearty and filling. Everyone who tried it loved it. I did cut back on the peppers and chili powder as suggested by another reviewer. You can tweak to your preference. Definitely a keeper!

We've been making this chili for several years now and it NEVER disapoints!  I use about 2/3s tomato sauce instead of canned tomatoes and usually don't need the full 3 cans. We serve w/ shredded cheese and plain greek yogurt...so good!

I love this chili and so did my family.  Of course we made a few modifications. We used a little extra garlic and made our own chili powder. We also didn't used the can of green chilies.  We used an extra jalapeño and added 1 chopped habenero (we like spicy food). The flavor was amazing and interestingly not extremely spicy. It was delicious.

Brought this in for an office chilli cook-off, and although I did not win, I got several compliments on the flavor and the heat from this dish. Only modification (which honestly was not missed), I did not use add the veggie burger crumbles into the dish.

I just made this for myself and the kids. I altered it a bit to fit what I had on hand so I wouldn't have to go to the store. I used more cumin and chili powder than the recipe called for and I didn't use all the spicy peppers because my kids don't like the spicy as much. I added olives and used chili beans, one can of diced toms, black beans, corn, kidney beans, onion, garlic, celery and all the other seasonings. Very yummy! Perfect for a cold day!

This recipe is perfect as is, can't think of any way I would change. I like it, family likes, and is definitely not too spicy. My wife and daughter both hate spicy food and they ate it right up. Good work!

YUM!:)  So hearty and tasty (and healthy)..I only made a few adjustments (based on ingredients on hand) - I used Dole mexican recipe diced tomatoes (already has green chili/jalapeno in it) and threw in a few pinches of cayenne for an extra kick.  I probably doubled the garlic as well. I also only used Kidney and black beans.  Served with fat free shredded cheddar cheese and fat free sour cream = delicious!!  Will definitely make again and again...

This is great chili! I did add a few extra things. Because my husband is a big meat eater I add 2 packages of slice mushrooms. I also added 4-5 dashes of worsheshire sauce. Because it wasnt spicey enough for us we added 2 more jalepenos. This chili is yummy and even better the next day!

This was a great starting point for me since I've never tried to make vegetarian chili. I added half a can of beer, some worcestershire, and chipotle chili powder to the mix.  It was awesome!

This was so yummy!  It's my new favorite chili - no one in my family knew it didn't have meat in it!  Forgot the celery, and the corn and used pinto beans instead of the garbonzo beans and had to add about 1 cup of water.  But it was really so good.  Served it w/ Trader Joe's corn chips.  Will be a regular meal for us!!  Thanks!

Changed a few things....cut the salt out, added one green and one red bell pepper, omitted jalapenos, added a stalk of celery, used 5-14.5 cans of diced zesty chili style tomatoes, used pinto beans instead of garbanzo and added chopped zucchini.  This is the BEST chili recipe, vegetarian or regular!!!  All my family loved it and no one could tell it was vegetarian until I told them.  This will definitely be a fall/winter staple!  :o)

I served this for my vegetarian house guests, and even my carnivorous family loved it!  No one really cared for garbanzos, so we swapped those with pinto beans, and we took someone elses suggestion of swapping the jalapeno with chipoltle.   This is now my standard "go to" recipe for chili!   I took a shortcut and used diced, frozen veggies- and it whipped up in no time!

A pretty good recipe, except we didn't care for the garlic (just didn't seem right in chili). I omitted the jalapenos to meet the needs of a finicky kid, but the chili powder still gave a decent kick. I took one reviewer's suggestion and crumbled up veggie burgers (Morningstar's grillers prime) instead of using the packaged crumbles. Brilliant idea -- finally succeeded in putting one over on my carnivore husband! I'll use this recipe as a base to customize to my family's quirks.

I liked this chili except for the fact that is was on the salty side. I would drain all the beans and add water next time and use about half the salt. I am also a little sensitive to heat and this was a bit on the spicy side, but my fiance didn't even notice the heat level. All in all it's a good chili, but definitely reduce the salt next time.

This chili was perfect, though I made a few mods: one bottle of High Life and a jigger of Jack Daniels. Had friends over for football season kickoff and they loved it.

This was very good! Made a few changes - 1 Tbsp oregano instead of 2, and 1 Tsp of salt, not 1 Tbsp (and it could do with even a little less), no jalapenos, used golden hominy instead of reg corn, and used 1 pkg sausage crumbles and 1 regular crumbles.  My kids loved it! I'm sure the recipe "as is" is great too - just not all that salt!

This recipe lives up to its title, this is the best vegetarian chili I have ever had! I will definitely be making this recipe again, it was delicious, and my non-vegan family loved it as well.

My daughter and I made this chili last night and the whole family loved it! I was out of oregano so we used Menudo Mix (oregano, onion flakes, coriander seed, cumin & chili flakes) we also added about 4 Tlbs of brown sugar. The sugar helps cut the spice and gave it a wonderful zest! We used only 2 Tlbs chili powder and 2 Tlbs. taco mix. 12 yrs - 45 yrs. we all loved it! Teen friends came over and loved it also. It feed 7 of us and we still have leftovers.  Can’t wait to make this for our next pot luck!

Very tasty and good if you mix in cooked rice to cut the spicy hot. This chili was way too hot. It would help if there was a measurement for the jalapeno chilies and the temperature of the powdered chili. eg: hot, med. or mild.

Be warned- this is very hot chili. And I love spicy food! I had to add some sour cream to the top the first night we made it to take the heat down a couple of notches. This does get better overnight though and the heat somehow seemed to dissipate. I think the next time I make this, I'll cook the night before I plan to serve it.

Really surprising! I left all the peppers out, the kidney beans, the black beans  and the garbanzos for my husband... So, What did I put instead?? I baked my own pinto beans first in water with spices and added a can of white beans. It cooked for two hours...oups! But was so good,  The 3 kids, my husband and I  ate almost the whole pan with cornbread. REALLY good! Thank you

This is delicious - my husband is not vegetarian and he enjoys this recipe as much as I do! It is *very* spicy though, so you may need to adjust this to suit your tastes. My husband likes it extra-spicy and leaves the jalapeño seeds in.

Excellent basic recipe. We like food spicy, so I added a cup of chopped jalapeno and it was great. Only needed one package of the crumbles. Seems to be a very forgiving basic recipe that's easily customized.

This was really good, but I think there was just TOO much going on in it for me. I would definitely omit at least the garbanzo beans if I made this again, they didn't really fit in my opinion.  It's a lot of work for sure, but the flavor overall was really good.

WOW.  Just fixed this up with only very minor adjustments: added fresh chopped cilantro and couldn't find a can of green chilies at the store so I grabbed a can of diced tomatoes WITH green chilies.  This is so delicious, I'm excited to share this recipe with friends!

I LOVE this recipe!  it's always such a hit!    I, also, make just a couple alterations (mostly the same ones other people recommended, but instead of 3 cans of whole peeled tomatoes crushed, I only did 2 and then used 2 small cans of tomato paste.  Doesn't make a huge difference, it's just something my mom's always done to make it a little thicker

It's amazing!! I want to dig in now and it's not even done cooking. I put mine in the crockpot. Before I added the second bag of crumbles I was hesitant. It looked so perfect and vibrant just as it was so I gave it a nibble. DELICIOUS. I gave in, whatever this recipe says must be truth. I can't wait till it's finished.

This is the best veg chili I've ever had.  The recipe is simple to follow.  I left out the burger crumbles, but the results were still awesome!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This chili is FANTASTIC! We aren't vegetarians so we do add meat, but I add ground turkey and ground chicken. I used to use the lMcCormick chili packets but I hated not really knowing what we were eating. THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER!!! Since we aren't that big on spice I cut it down to one jalapeño, 1/8 cup chili powder and I omit the canned chilies.  Simply perfect! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!!

Awesome! I only used dried black beans, and added some homemade salsa, so I skipped the jalapeno. I also added baby bellas to the mix...  had with corn chips and basmati rice. yuuum!

Who says vegetarian has to be boring?! This was delicious! My celery was still a bit crunchy, but that's because I didn't chop it small enough. Added a little extra chili pepper and a touch of crushed red pepper. Husband had one bowl as is and added Tabasco to another - loved it both ways!  Recipe says it makes 8 servings; but we halved it, had two bowls apiece, and STILL have some left over. Definitely a good value! We'll be eating this again this week, happily. I've already shared it with a vegan friend who is always looking for options. Highly recommend!

This is better than any chili I ate so far. My husband and I don't like our food very very spicy, so I only used 1 jalapeno and I did not use the chopped green chili peppers at all. Having only one jalapeno, black pepper and chili powder was perfect. It ended up spicy, and still eatable. I also replaced the vegetarian crumbles with smoked turkey drumsticks. Really tasty...

Very good, and I was able to make it just fine in a dutch oven, but I was a bit puzzled by the yield.  This seemed to make much more than 8 normal-sized servings.  Since we were camping I had to throw away a lot of leftover chili, and that was after six grown, hungry adults had eaten two bowls each.

This is a great recipe, but I tried it with fresh ingredients (they're easy to come by where I live) and it turned out much better. For instance: canned green chilis have lots of vinegar (and vinegar doesn't go well with it).

Way too much chili powder.  I appeciate a chili with a bit of a bite, but this much chili powder robbed from the taste of the chili.

I made this a while ago for a charity chili cook - off for my work and it was tasty! Even though it didn't win, many people voted for this chili.  Most couldn't even tell the meat was missing! Thanks!

Delish!! My only change was I skipped the jalapenos altogether and it was still spicy and flavorful. It made about 10 2-cup servings.  Serve this to your meat loving friends and see if they can tell the difference. I bet they can't!

Delicious! This was my first time making any sort of chili and it turned out great!... I didn't put any jalapeno peppers or chile peppers, but it was still a little bit too spicy for my taste. I would suggest using a LITTLE bit less of the chili powder (maybe 1/2 the amount) and none of the hot peppers, but it was still absolutely delicious! Nothing a little oyster crackers couldn't solve. ;)

This recipe is a hit!  My husband gave up meat for lent and we found this recipe and are making it for the second time this week.  We will double it this time.  A note for those that don't like hot/spicy foods - add less jalapeno.

This is a good recipe. I hate celery, but I love zucchini so I decided to cube it and replace the celery in the recipe. Turned out great! I also added a little bit of brown sugar. You should definitely try this recipe.

Absolutely awesome recipe - very versatile and easy to manipulate.  Freezes well too.  The only change I suggest is to NOT add the faux meat until you're ready to eat it and do it in batches.  We like to double this recipe and freeze at least half of it.  It's not a difficult recipe but requires A LOT of can opening and chopping.  Might as well do a double batch and avoid the work on a busy weeknight.

I am not a huge chili fan, but this was very good. I do think it needs a bit more seasoning than the recipe calls for. It makes a ton of chili! I used pinto beans instead of garbanzo beans.

This chili recipe definitely lives up to its name.  I love heat so I added cayenne; two tablespoons and I got that sock in the mouth that I love about chili.  I would not recommend as much if you have a sensitive palate.  Start small and add more to taste.  But all in all, a very good recipe.

really great! It WAS a bit watery because I added a bit more pepper - I would reccommend grilling the peppers first to add roasty notes and take out a bit of the water! It was MUCH better the second day too!

This is an exceptional vegetarian chili that improves in flavor with each passing day. I hardly made any changes. I couldn't find vegetarian burger crumbles, so used Morningstar Farms veggie burgers, chopped up. Also, you really need to cook chili powder rather than throwing it in later -- so I sauteed it along with the other seasonings. Since I used 100% New Mexico chili powder, I augmented it with an extra tsp each of cumin and oregano (which are included in commercial chili powder). I didn't use jalapeno peppers and I cut the salt from a tablespoon to 2 tsps. I used frozen corn, too, and drained and rinsed all of the beans. This is a keeper. Thanks!

This was delicious!! I served it over rice and only used one jalapeno. I also used two large cans of crushed organic tomatoes vs. 3 cans whole tomatoes. Very healthy dish & pretty quick to make- I did not add any crumbles.. plenty of protein from the beans!!

very good! i used orange bell instead of green and added some extra cumin and chili power to my taste. i'm not sure why some people think it's so spicy, but i am guessing that they chopped the jalapenos whole with the seeds and all. they need to be sliced down the middle, and the seeds scooped out.  without the seeds, not too spicy at all.

Beautiful to eat - beautiful to smell as it's cooking - and it even looks beautiful from the vegies and bean assortment.  Never tried fake meat before - it's pretty good, especially in this chili.  I prepared the beans from dry state and glad I did - it made this dish taste even more wholesome.  Beautiful!  Thanks for posting

This was really good, but took a really long time to make with all of the different chopping that had to be done.  It was also a bit too spicy for me and I like spicy.  My 3-year old could hardly eat it, but my husband loved it!  I doubled the recipe like some had suggested, but ended up with WAY too much!  We ate it all week long and it definitely got boring although it reheats and keeps really well.

Tastes so good my husband(a big meat eater) caqn hardly tell the difference. I changed a few things and omitted most of the"hot" but didn't comprimise the quality. I used Yves mexican veggie crumbles and hardly needed to add any spice. I has become a favorite in our house.

Absolutely yummy for vegetarians and carnivors alike! We recently started a "vegetarian, healthy day" at work inwhich one of the participants brings in lunch for the rest of the group.  Oh man this kicked butt! First everyone commented on how great it smelled (I had prepared it the night before and brought it in room temp the next day).  Then our token hardcore meat man was told it was vegetarian...but he just couldn't help himself.  I have to admit it came out both beautiful and delicious.  I did sub one of the green peppers for a red pepper and also added a bit of sugar at the end to tone down the heat (I still left a bit of a kick!) so that it would feed the masses comfortably, and it did.  I served it with quinoa.  Perfection!

Made this for a house warming party. Everyone loved it! I mashed a can of garbanzo beans instead of putting them in whole and it really added to the texture of the chili. I will absolutly make this again.

What can I say?  Perfect!  You cannot go wrong with this recipe.  You don't have to tell anyone it's veggie b/c they will never miss the meat.  I used veggie crumbles.  I made this the night before on purpose because it's so much better the next day!  I added shredded cabbage and carrot mix (cole slaw mix) and a package of taco seasoning.  I used an extra couple teaspoons of chili powder and some extra oregano.  I used chicken broth to keep it thinner.  Also just a little cayenne pepper (maybe 4 or 5 pinches).  My boyfriend thinks I am the best cook in the world!

I think it's funny how some people consider this chili spicy and others don't at all.  I barely tasted any spice in this chili and I had to drench it in hot sauce just to eat it because it was frankly quite bland.  But then again, I don't consider Tabasco sauce to be spicy.  I made it in the slow cooker, I subbed green onions for onions and increased chili powder, garlic, and cumin.  It makes a ton.  I won't be making this again--I'm still looking for the perfect vegetarian chili recipe...

I've made this twice now and my family absolutely loves it.  My husband (a huge carnivore) couldn't even tell that the veggie crumbles were not ground beef.

I followed the recipe exactly except for skipping the jalapenos.  I served it in individual, hollowed out sour dough boules that I had brushed with butter and heated up in the oven, then sprinkled the top of the chili with shredded cheddar.   A delicious main course that I will make many, many times.  Thank you, calead910!

Pretty good chili.  Average.  I like the vegetables and the peppers.  I am not sure that it is spicy enough.  All these other reviewers just couldn't handle it...Sissies.  Ha ha.  The only complaint I have is that it is a little salty.

Perfect on a chilly december day.  We left out the faux meat crumbles (replaced them with a can of pinto beans) and added quite a bit more cumin and some cayenne.  It was so delicious, I'm looking forward to the leftovers.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This chili is AMAZING, and after a few tries, I think I have it down. Spice wuss beware- leave out the jalepenos all together and it will have just a little kick. I also cut the veggie crumbles in half. The chilli is also good without any meat substitute or ground turkey. Thank you calead910!

This chili is amazing!   I do leave out the veggie burger crumbles and add an extra can of beans. I serve with sour cream and tortilla chips! Even the non-veg's love it.

Delicious chili.  I added 1/2 cup of Cabernet to the sauce and replaced the veggie crumbles with Gimmee Lean meatless sausage.  Saute the Gimmee Lean first to brown it, if you decide to make that substitution.  Really tasty recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe! I made it exactly as it's written for the first time. I didn't know how hot it would be, so I took the seeds and white part out of the jalapenos. It turned out mild, but with great chili flavor.  I have two picky teens, they both thought I was nuts to do a vegetarian chili. My daughter was delighted to find out she couldn't taste the "fake meat"!   Now that I know what to expect heat wise, I'll make it HOT next time.  I took a bowl to a friend, he said he'd pay me to make a double batch, so he'd have extra to freeze. He didn't believe me when I told him about the "fake meat".  hahaha... "fake meat". I'm still laughing about that one...

AWESOME RECIPE...I have made this recipe for several occasions now.  Everyone loves it.  I substitute the vegetarian burger crumbles for ground turkey. I am Portuguese and love spicy food, Instead of the canned chili peppers, I add some slightly hot chopped pickled red peppers for extra zing.  I also add red and yellow peppers to the recipe and because of being weight concious, I serve this with fat free Greek Chobani Yogurt which tastes exactly like sour cream.  DELICIOUS...

Used one jalepeno and still too spicy fo rthe 5 yr old.  But for me it was perfect.  My husband probably would have been happy with the 2 jalepenos.  Flavor was great.

I really liked this chile.  Used New Mexico Green that I froze last summer and ground Chimayo red chile. This recipe is what we, in New Mexico, call gringo chile, but it is quite delicious when cooked with good New Mexico chile.

So good!  The one key is to make sure you are using a REALLY big pot (and wear gloves when you cut the jalapenos - oops).  My husband's father was always the king when it comes to making chili.  When this recipe went head to head with his white chicken chili at my sister-in-law's party, even the staunchest meat eater agreed that the king had been dethroned and the vegetarian was better!!!

This recipe makes SO MUCH! I used my big pot, and it wasn't even big enough! I threw in some extra beans, added zucchini and a can of diced tomatoes with jalapeños. i also only used one can of crushed tomatoes. this was awesome topper to pasta cheese and onions or cornbread! Will make again!

I made a few changes.. I add 5 zucchini, use a whole onion instead of a half, omit the salt but double all spices except for oregano, use one jalapeno, double the garlic, and substitute 3 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce for the chili powder.  I've found that it makes a heartier, healthier, more flavorful chili, but this recipe is still wonderful as is!  Using fire-roasted tomatoes is a nice touch as well.  I could eat this every day for a week!  Also, make sure to drain and rinse the beans very well, or you'll end up with an extremely salty chili.

I am giving this four stars because I had to change the recipe because of poor grocery shopping.  I used three chili's in Ancho sauce instead of the jalapenos, equal parts cumin and cayenne pepper instead of chili powder and the juice of one lime.  I found that my additions made it too spice so I added the lime.  The chili was excellent the night I made it, but the next day the lime did even more work at making the spices more melodious.

Updated: So delicious! My go-to chili recipe. Instead of veggie crumbles, I added 20 oz of ground turkey at the same step and cooked.  I used 2 can of crushed tomatoes and it was phenomenal.  (One time I also added in  a can of Rotel tomatoes with green chilies once, and that was great too). I added a bit of garlic powder and 1 tsp of sugar and 1 tsp of brown sugar to get rid of the bitterness. I used 2 jalapeños (1 seeded and one whole). No corn.  Used 1 can of each: kidney beans, black beans, garbanzo beans, and cannellini beans.  Even better the next day!

Very good and easy to make.  My family and I loved this recipe, but I knew it would be too hot for us, so I made some changes.  I cut the jalapeno to one, used one heaping T of red chili powder (Chimayo)and 1T cracked black pepper.  I also used Morningstar sausage for one pound of the "meat".  It is slightly spicy this way.  I could have taken more heat, but my kids don't like it too hot and I can always add Tabasco or something to up the heat.  It's good enough for me to freeze and take to a Super Bowl party next weekend.  I serve it with sour cream, cheddar and guacamole, plus corn bread and/or tortilla chips/fritos.

I've eaten a lot of veggie chili in my time, but this is by far the best.  Thank you!  I used crushed tomato instead of whole peeled, as my daughter doesn't like "chunks" of tomato.  It was still just wonderful!

This is an incredibly good chili recipe and great for vegetarians.  I have made it several times, and it is always good.  If I am going to freeze it, i omit the carrot as it tastes a bit old after freezing.  Highly recommended

Everyone I make this for says it's amazing, although I've modified it a bit. I can't believe anyone would say it was too spicy! I halve the recipe, kind of, using 1 can of beans each and 2 cans tomatoes, but ALL of the spices so that it has that nice full flavor. It makes an entire large pot so I can't imagine having more of it. I LOVE it! Make it at least once a month, eat the leftovers for days, and give a box to all of my friends!!

This was too liquidy and bland. I added more tomato paste and chili powder to try and help, but it only did so much.

This was waaayyy too spicy and I even cut down the jalapeno, chilis and chili powder!! Also, I thought the tomato taste was overwhelming as if there wasn't enough other seasoning...plenty of heat just not flavor.  I kept out the crumbles and added portobello mushrooms which was pretty good but they don't add flavor.  This recipe makes a ton so be prepared to freeze some.  The day after, I put some of the chili in a tortilla w/ avocado and it tasted really good and it cut down the spice.   From now on, I think I'll use the recipe for my husbands chili and omit the meat.  That recipe has a much better base..I think it's called "Flatlander Chili" on this site.

Fourth review today.  Funny. I did not have chilis or jalepenos on hand so I substituted 4-14 oz cans of tomatoes with chilis and included the juice and it was plenty spicy.  It was a little too tangy for my taste.  I think that comes from the canned tomatoes.  I added a spoonful of sugar and another of baking powder and it helped.  I have enough to freeze for the rest of the winter!!

This is one of those recipes I've made enough that i almost know by heart.  I always omit the veggie crumbles, the kidney beans offer an awesome "meaty" taste!

This recipe is absolutely fantastic! Even my meat-loving boyfriend loved it! The corn is a great addition. I didnt use the celery or peppers (didnt have any on hand) and it turned out AWESOME! Its nice and spicy, just how I like it. Ive made it twice now and will make it many more times. Thanks :]

Our family thought this chili was really good!  Some people mentioned it was too spicy, however we thought it was just right.  Makes A LOT, so it's great for leftovers.

Great chili recipe!  The only thing I ever change is the amount of oregano - only 1 tbs. - and chili powder - I think it tastes terrible with 1/4 c. 1/8 is plenty.  1 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and 56 oz. of diced works, too.  But these are minor changes.  Overall, the flavor is excellent.

This is an awesome recipe!
My only qualm is that it makes SUCH a large batch...Great for a family, but not so much for an individual; I was eating chili for a week and a half. The actual chili however, is fabulous. Will half it next time.

I have kept a pot of this chili on hand since finding the recipe.  For family members that don't like it so spicy, I omitted the two cans of green chili peppers and they loved it.  Great over brown rice.  This really is the best veggie chili I have ever had.

Absolutely wonderful!  I added cashews to mine and it tasted fantastic. I will be using this recipe from now on.  

I only used one package of crumbles and that was plenty. This recipe can feed an ARMY!  And nobody would ever guess it's vegetarian. If I didn't know any better I'd swear on my life it has ground beef in it. 

As for the people who said this was so spicy it was inedible... are you sure you measured your spices correctly?  Did you use a different type of pepper???  Because I didn't find it terribly spicy at all... In fact I added a lot of Cayenne pepper to mine while I was eating it.

Anyhow, thank you for the fantabulous recipe!

This was my first time making chili and I must say this recipe was really great! I will never go back to canned chili again! It was a little spicy the first time around so I'll probably use a little less spice the next time, but altogether it was a great recipe, thanks!

A great recipe to use as a base.  I usually tinker with the ingredients according to taste and what I have on hand, including using fresh veges instead of canned/frozen.

This chili is great!  It's hearty, not soupy.  It has just enough kick to it to make it flavorful.  It's not too hot to enjoy.  I used just one package of the veggie meat crumbles.  That was plenty.  This recipe is a keeper.

This chili was really, really good!  My only problem was that it wasn't soupy enough for me.  So, instead of draining the beans, I added the beans with their juice.  It worked alright.  In the future, I'd add a bit more water to the pot.  Other than that, it was excellent!

I've been looking for a chili recipe for a long time, and could never get the right spice combo. But now I've found it! This is bubbling on my stove right now and I've already snuck a taste. It's spicy and fantastic. I used jalapeno peppers, as it's hard to find every variety here in Berlin and I couldn't find the canned chili peppers either, but it's still fantastic (I'm sure it would be even better with). Also, I only had two cans of tomatoes, so I substituted some extra water and tomato paste and I think it's fine. Also, I used dried soy crumbles, as that's the closest to Boca-style crumbles they have here. I think you could also use bulgur for a similar texture. Fantastic, even with all the substitutions!

I made this for the family tonight and unfortunately as the recipe is, it's just not edible with 1 tablespoon of pepper. I only used half what was called for and it was still way too spicy and I like spicy. I ended up having to add tomato paste to mask the pepper, should have just left it out altogether.

I made this with one can chili's some chili powder, chili beans and black beans. No kidney beans, white beans or corn. Used boca crumbles .  Very good! Nice thing about chili add more of what you like less of what you don't.

I love this recipe! I make it every few weeks, especially in the fall and winter. I've made many variations, including substituting ground turkey for the vegetarian burger crumbles (my husband thinks all meals need meat), using dark and light kidney beans and black beans (no garbonzo beans) and adding other types of bell peppers. I also like to go a little heavy on the jalepenos. You can't mess this recipe up! And, it's great to freeze and reheat if you can't finish the whole pot!

There are so many vegetarian chili recipes out there that I had a hard time believing that this could be the best. But guess what - it is! My husband and I love it, and don't mind eating it for every meal for a couple of days in a row. Delicious!

I started out with good intentions of just following the recipe as directed but it just didn't seem to be quiet right.

It was very thick with the three cans of crushed tomatos. I had to add two cups of water to get the consistency right. 

The vegetable proportions were way off in my opinion. With the amounts the recipe calls for you could hardly tell there was any in the chili. I ended up adding an additional 1/2 onion. It still didn't seem to matter. If I make this again, I would add an additional medium size onion and an additional green pepper. 

I did make a few alterations to the recipe a, which I did not take into consideration when rating this recipe. Just a few personal touches I thought of along the way. I added four stalks of celery and a bottle of Samuel Adams beer. I also added extra chili powder and some cayenne pepper for an extra kick!

This is very good... no EXCELLENT.  I don't eat processed soy products so I omitted the meat substitute for carrots, zucchini, eggplant & cilantro.  I didn't have the produce suggested in the recipe but it still came out so good with what I added  I will make this again.

Ok wow - I had to register just to comment on this.  This chili blew me away.  I'm not even a vegetarian and it tasted so fantastic I nearly exploded.  It does have a good amount of kick so if you don't like it so hot, go easy on the spicy stuff.  I will make this recipe again and again until the end of time and space.  Thank you for sharing this.

Good, but too salty. Here's what I learned: use less salt. Next time will use less. Added 2 tsps black-strap molasses and hickory smoke, as I usually do. One thing I changed was that I used white canneloni beans and lentils, along with the kidney beans, instead of garbonzos. Also, I would have typically added a little ketchup in the final stage, I didn't do this time because I thought might add too much salt.

This is so good! I have made it twice and this is what I add- I used 6 15 oz. cans of diced tomatoes (MUCH easier than cutting up whole tomatoes), 2 cans of corn, 1 jalapeno, doubled the kidney beans, added pinto beans. It is so delicious!! We eat it with whole grain flat bread. Best if you chop the peppers and onions very small. Great recipe!

Really good! I make a double batch and freeze the leftovers. You can throw anything into the pot, by the way - any beans, leave out crumbles if you want, throw in some rice, a handful of lentils... very versatile and forgiving. Great on lettuce for a chili salad or on Fritos with cheese or cornbread.

I made this for a causual dinner party and it was fantastic. I added carrots, zucchini, and some chopped fresh grape tomatoes from the farmers market as well as the listed ingredients. It was really fantastic. I also don't measure spices for chili, I eyeball it and taste test. In any case, this was fantastic chili!

Excellent! I used one package of meat crumbles, nixed the celery and cooked on low for 2.5 hours. I omitted the garbanzo beans and doubled the black beans. I used fresh corn on the cob. It was rather spicy but I enjoy my food like that. Made 10+ servings.

Oh man!  

Ok... first, my changes.  I used TVP because we can't really afford the crumbles.  I also reduced the heat slightly by leaving out 1 can of green chilies, the jalepeno seeds and some of the chili powder.

Keep in mind that I am a new vegetarian (only a few weeks), so I still have a taste for meat even though I have chosen to no longer consume it.  AND, also my fiance is NOT a vegetarian, but eats many vegetarian meals with me.

With that being said.  We LOVED this recipe!  I had many non-vegetarians try it and they all loved it.  It's hearty, WAY filling, and wonderfully satisfying!!  

The best part?  Two days in the fridge made it even better!  

Loved it, thanks for the recipe!

Awesome recipe. I usually tweak recipes to my own sensibilities, but I saw no reason to change anything here, so I didn't. It made a HUGE pot of very good chili; I put half in the freezer, and ate the other half over the next week or so with tortilla chips, cheese, and diced onion. The frozen portion kept very well. Aside from the sodium (unavoidable with canned goods), it seems like a very healthy dish, too. Highly recommended!

Yum, yum, yum!! I made this for Superbowl Sunday, and got rave reviews. Two of my guests deemed it "the best chili they'd ever had"! There is a fair amount of prep time, but it's worth it. It makes a huge batch, so I freeze some and have an instant meal down the line when I'm rushed. It really is a complete meal in itself, though you can add a salad or ready-bake biscuits to round it out. Absolutely delicious, and completely healthy.

We made this for a chili contest and everyone loved it. We made a few changes from the suggestions of other reviews. Less salt, using 3 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and added portobello mushrooms and a little tomato paste. It was fantastic. I might use a tad less burger crumbles, but it was amazing. Thanks!

As a new vegetarian, I was soooo pleased! You will not miss the meat! It had fantastic flavor. I left out 1 of the cans of green chiles(too hot for my taste) and traded garbanzo beans for pinto beans!!! I will probably trade 1 can of diced tomatoes for crushed next time. I will also try this in my slow cooker. Although I can't imagine it getting much better than this!! Enjoy!

Delicious chili.  My husband who is a strict carnivore has eaten this two days in a row for lunch, so I'd say it's a keeper.  I will probably replace the crumbles with ground turkey sometime, since we are not actually vegetarians and do enjoy meat; but the flavor is great and i will make this again.

I thought the taste of this was great, with one big note- it was WAY too salty... I can't believe others aren't making the same comment.  I like things a little salty in general, but I had to double the vegetables in this just to balance out the salt a little bit, and still thought it was a little too salty after all that.  I love the other tastes but next time I'll start with maybe 1/2 teaspoon of salt and add it to taste at the end.  Otherwise though, great chili!

This is great and so healthy! Used 3 cans already crushed tomatoes, pre-minced garlic, drained all the veggies and rinsed the kidney and black beans, used jalapeno juice from the jarred/refrigerated jalapenos we had onhand and added 3 crumbled turkey burgers b/c we need to use them up. Great option (w/out the turkey : ) for "meat-free Fridays" during Lent for us Catholics!

This is a great recipe that my whole family loves.  I have used a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes instead of the 3 tomatoes and it works out fine.  I do not drain the cans of beans to provide enough liquid.  I noticed that the author just posted a note saying that there was an error on the tomatoes and it should have been 3 cans of tomatoes not 3 fresh.  I suspect that is why I need to keep the beans undrained.  I'm sure the extra tomatoes will expand the flavor but I do like it as is.  Like others I use 1 tsp. salt instead of 1 Tbsp.  I also cheat and use any leftover meat I have (beef, pork or chicken) instead of vegetarian burger crumbs--just chop the meat up.

I actually made this with about 1.5 lb of ground lean turkey breast and sans chick peas, and it was excellent.  I've made it twice now, and eaten the whole pot myself, both times.  It's a little spicy for my wife and kids.

It is delicious!!!  I prefer this to the top-rated meat chilis on this site.  Don't skimp on the seasoning or leave stuff out.  That initial smell of cumin and veggies and oregano etc., is superb.  This is one of the few recipes on this site that I make without modifications.  Thanks so much!

I was specifically looking for a vegetarian chili that was easy to make and a little different from my normal chili. I couldn't have found anything better (even my husband really liked it)! I did modify it slightly because i am not a big fan of whole tomatoes or chunks of tomatoes in chile and I noticed it also called for 2 cans of chopped green chili peppers. Instead of the tomatoes and chili peppers, I just substituted 2 cans of Rotel which is basically just tomatoes and chili peppers diced (that substitute worked out wonderfully, although the chili did turn out a bit thick but t can be thinned by adding tomato juice). I also only used 1 jalapeno pepper because with that and the cumin, black pepper, and chili pepper this is a very spicy chili. I think the corn really made a difference with the texture and it was a nice change. We ate it for two days and it was better every time.

I make this recipe at least once a month with Turkey instead of veggie crumbles. It's so easy and I like chili with a lot of vegetables. We throw it all in the crockpot but brown the turkey and onions first. Use the nacho jalapeno peppers just b/c it's easier. We usually pack in tupperware and bring to work for lunch-- serves 8- 4 husband size, 4 wife size. Tonight we will serve for a friend with baked potato, broccoli, sour cream and grated cheddar.

Delicious!  I omitted the meatless-meat crumbles (we're not a big fan), used 19oz cans of vegetables (instead of 15oz), and cut the spices back to about 80% of what the recipes stated.  Still had a significant kick, but didn't overpower more spice-sensitive palates.  One important omission in the recipe: you need to drain the tomatoes before crushing them, or you will have very liquidy chili!

i used chipotle chili pepper instead of chili powder. and used italian seasoning instead of oregano.  It made about 16 servings, not 8.  :)  but it was the BEST chili I have ever had in my life!  I will definitely be making this for everyone I know.

This was my first homemade chili and it came out great!! I can't believe it!! The only changes I made were: pinto beans instead of garbonzo beans, I drained liquid from only one of the bean cans, I used half the amount of chili powder, and added chili flakes because I couldn't find chili peppers in a jar.  I also added a pinch of cinnamon as another reviewer suggested.  If you don't like hot food then I would suggest using one jalepeno instead of two.  Thank you so much for the recipe!!!

This recipe ROCKS!!!  I pan-cooked the veggies first, then used 28 ounces of *stewed* tomatoes, and just piled everything into a crock pot on low for 10 hours.  It was just amazing.  It mixed well and was ready to eat.  I didn't use the corn as I don't like corn mixed in my food, but otherwise no change to the recipe.  Also be forewarned:  my kids *did* like it, but required sour cream to cut back on the "hotness" for them.  It's a warmness on your mouth more than it's spicy, but it was still a little much (going as the recipe dictates with the chili powder) for the children (6,4,and 2).

I dont know if it's the best in the world but it is  good!  

A healthy dish sure to please most people.  I use the Yves brand of fake ground beef.  I have prepared this for meat eaters and they had no idea that it was faux ground beef until I told them at the end.  

Highly recommended!

The store I went to seemed to have every meat substitue in the world but veggie crumbles, so I ended up buying spicy black bean veggie burgers, microwaving them for a minute or so and then crumbling them up. I also used only one seeded and chopped jalepeno pepper and left out the canned green chiles. In the end it was spicy enough without being overwhelming. It was a very thick fulfilling chili that was excellent with a sweet corn bread.

I used this recipe for beef chili not vegetarian, Slight change!  Had to find a chili recipe so I went for the "best" and it was delicious.  Used real ground beef for the veggie burger crumbles &  & omitted the corn. The spices & seasonings were a great blend. Everyone enjoyed it!

This really is great!  I used 2 28oz cans of tomoatoes, and that was plenty. I also ommited the veggie burger crumbles because I wasn't sure how well this taste would blend, and there was plenty of texture with the beans and corn.  This will be in the frequent rotation, and worked great in the Corck Pot.

Good recipe, very hearty, I go easy on the chillies and put them in a separate dish so people can have the chili as hot as they like. My son and his carnivore friends didn't guess this was vegetarian and they ate the whole pot!

Good, but I must be missing something.  It was way too dry to "simmer".  After adding the tomatos, it was still too dry to "boil".

Love this recipe! I'm no chef, and this was really easy to make and tastes great! I'm not too big on overly spicy food so I left out the jalepenos and chili peppers and instead used a little hot sauce that was brought back for me from Mexico, it added the perfect kicker. I also couldn't find Garbanzo beans so I used 1 can kidney beans, 1 can black beans and 1 can of a 6 bean medley. Worked out GREAT! Will make this again and again!

Loved this! I did without the jalapeno peppers per others' advice--good thing since my kids wouldn't have cared for it otherwise. I also added a can of tomato paste. Am so glad this makes a large pot so we can have leftovers for a couple of nights! Thanks for sharing.

This chili was AMAZING! My picky husband who doesn't even like to hear the word "vegetarian" just loved this chili. He actually ate the entire pot except for one bowl (I ate that one) in about a week. Full of healthy, fiery ingredients and packed with flavor!

This made a huge pot of the best tasting chili I have made yet.  I added an extra jalapeno and used tomato puree in place of one of the cans of whole tomatoes.  I also added a bit more chili powder, but did not measure how much more I used.  My husband didn't realize that it was meatless.

Wonderful flavor!  I didn't add vegetarian meat.  Although, it was still great!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I misread the can of whole peeled tomatoes, crushed, I used fresh peeled tomatoes, crushed.  I had to add about 1 cup of water after I added the tomatoes into the pot with beans.  But it turned out good!  Next time, I'll remember to used cans of whole peeled tomatoes, crushed.

This was really, really good. I had to make a few substitutions because of personal preferences (I left out the jalapeno peppers and used kidney beans in place of the garbanzo and black beans), but the chili was still delicious. I'm a new vegetarian, and this recipe made me not miss meat!

This recipe is awesome.  I just made for my husband and brother-in-law while they were watching football and it was a hit.  I added cubed chicken in the beginning with the onion because "vegetarian" was not going to fly with them, and it was soo good.  This one is definetly a keeper!

My husband is a meat-lover and doesn't usually like chili, but he loved this recipe! The only thing I changed was adding more spices. I seeded the jalepeno, so maybe that was my problem. I added more chili powder and cumin, and sprinkled some cayenne in as well. Delicious!

My highest rating for this amazing recipe! I only used one jalepeno and cut back just a bit on the chili powder. I also added two extra cans of beans since I didn't use the hamburger crumble. I also used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of fresh. Also, yes, use the liquid from the beans. It is so flavorful and delicious! Highly recommended.

Combine this recipe with the Chili Seasoning Mix II and you got a winner.  So easy to make and REALLY tasty.  I omitted all the pepper ingrediants and added zuccini, mushrooms, peas & carrots to the mix.  Pefection!

This chili is AWESOME.  I am not a vegetarian, but my sister is, so I'm always looking for good recipes.  I made this for meat-eaters, so I added ground turkey instead of the vegetarian burger crumbles.  I omitted the jalapenos, and with the chili powder this chili still had a kick!  I also added 2 cans of kidney beans (one light and one dark) instead of 1 b/c I didn't have garbanzos.  Turned out great!  This seems like a recipe that would be friendly to any modifying you'd like to do.

Delicious. Made it for friends for a dinner party and everyone asked for the recipe. I didn’t have jalapeños or green chili’s, but I used Rotel tomatoes that have green chili’s in them.

Used 1 large can of crushed peeled tomatoes and one package of Beyond ground beef because I don’t have an army to feed. I added one can of chopped tomatoes. I forgot the green chilis, but I will try to remember them next time. I used half the salt and half the chili power, but otherwise I kept the recipe basically the same. My husband can’t stop raving. It is amazing.

Substituted 2 roasted poblanos for one green pepper. Toasted the corn before adding. Strained the juice from the tomatoes and only added half in and added half a can of stout. Next time I might try crushed tomatoes, the chunks from the hand crushed whole canned tomatoes were a little to big for my preference.

I didn't put the jalapena peppers in it because I don't like spicy food.  I also toned down the chili powder ( probably too much).  Minus having no kick at all since I took all that out, it was delicious!!!  I will definitely make it again and put a bit more chili powder in it this time.

Easy to make and nice flavors. I added smoked paprika for a bit of a "smoky" flavor, and some Cayenne pepper for heat.

This is exceptional, and I wanted to want any Weight Watchers members know that it is a great chili for you!  I made a few changes: used only 2 tsp olive oil, less salt, red peppers instead of green (my husband doesn't do well with green), no jalapeno peppers, added more garlic, ground turkey breast instead of the vegetarian burger crumbles, substituted two 14 ounce cans of fire roasted diced tomatoes for 1 of the 28 oz cans of crushed tomatoes, 3 Tbsp of chili powder instead of 1/4 cup, and white beans instead of the garbonzo.  I also didn't use the corn.  This was delicious, but I found it to be way too thick, so I added four cups of vegetable broth.  With my calculations, this turned out to be six Smart Points for the entire recipe!  And it makes a huge pot.  Very filling and delicious.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I made it but only used 2 cans of beans and tomatoes. Also only used 1.5 packages of meatless ground round. I forgot the bay leaves. Added chili pepper flakes and it tasted great! Served to meat eaters and all loved it but when I said it was vegan one whinned like a baby because I tricked him! Lol. But it went over well. Would definitely make it again!

It’s delicious and beautiful to look at with all the colors! I’d recommend using diced tomatoes instead of whole. Loved the advice to drain beans and add a little water!

I add fire roasted red pepper instead of green pepper and Penzey's Arizona spice instead of chili powder because we like a little less heat. Great recipe!

I found this recipe for the  first time back in 2015  for a chili cook off if Texas of all places. I heard every comment possible about the chili not having meat. But by the times the cook off was over the pot was empty and I won. I have been winning with this recipe for years. Here’s the kicker I don’t even eat chili but everyone else around me loves this recipe. Great job and thank you for sharing.

Spectacular with a surprisingly complex and layered flavor profile.  This chili, among the many items from our Winter party menu scored highest as the favorite dish of our guests.  We will make this again and again. Oh, best of all: brain dead simple to prepare.  We started on the stovetop and then transferred the browned veggies to the crockpot for final cooking.

Maybe the best chili I’ve ever made! So incredibly delicious! My Trader Joe’s didn’t have canned green chilis so I spiced it up with extra raw jalapeños served on top. I used frozen  roasted corn, which added a delicious flavor. Served with avocado slices over baked potatoes and it was fantastic!

I love this recipe!!!!! I've made it at least 2 dozen times in a last few years and everyone (including carnivores) have loved it!
Best advice: don't use a tablespoon of salt!! And if you're like me, veggie chopping takes a bit, expect this recipe to take double the time in total.

My alterations:
1 whole yellow onion instead of half
No bay leaves
1 tablespoon instead of 1 teaspoon of cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt  instead of 1 tablespoon
3 stalks of celery and some of the leaves from the inside of the bunch instead of only 2 stalks
ADD 3 little shakes celery seed(1/8 tsp)
2 heaping tablespoons CANNED jalepeños instead of fresh
1/2  tsp garlic powder instead of fresh
1 can great northern beans instead of garbanzo beans
NO corn.

So easy and delicious. I added extra cumin and chili powder (about 50% more of each). Also added about 12 shakes of Cholula, cooked for an hour longer (on lowest heat, lid on) and then let it sit for another hour before serving.  So. Freaking. Good. Had some as left overs 2 days in a row now - it gets better every time. For burger crumbles, I recommend the Trader Joe’s veggie crumbles.  I crushed my tomatoes with a wire whisk so it would be chunky rather than completely pulp.

This chili can stand up to any meat chili.  The recipe won 3rd place in a chili cookoff of 20 entries.  It was the only vegetarian chili!  I added quite a bit more spice for more kick.   I did prepare it a day in advance and let it simmer several hours before serving.  

Variations: I only used 1 bag of vegetarian crumbles (13.5 oz); added only two cans of beans (two 15 oz cans of drained mixed chili beans); only two cans of tomatoes; used yellow and orange peppers instead for color and did not add corn.

You get more than a whole day's worth of sodium in a single serving ... why is this listed under Healthy?  Omit the added salt and drain (and rinse) the canned veggies or better yet use fresh if practical.  Let the eater decide whether or not to shake the salt into their bowl.

Loved it! Made a few changes. I only used 4 14-oz cans of whole tomatoes, which I then crushed in the pot using a potato masher, which worked quite well! Also didn't use the green chili peppers and only added 2 Tbsp of chili powder, to make it a little milder. It still had a kick! Left it on low for about 3 hours and the extra time only enhanced the flavor. Tastes great with some cheese grated on top and cornbread as a side!

I would have given this one 5 stars easily for ingredients and flavor, but . a few things; there is no way this recipe is 8 Servings!  It filled my pot  (10 Quart capacity) to the brim.  So that will be approximately 40 servings of 8 oz. each.  Or enough for a small army!  So a word to the wiser, scale it down unless you will be feeding the entire club...

This really is the best vegetarian chili recipe. You can definitely ditch the chili peppers and still have it turning out great. If you plan on reheating this dish a lot, don't worry about cooking it for 45 minutes as reheating will dry it out.

This was a delicious veggie chili and kids and adults loved- I used pinto and white chili beans instead of black beans and kidney and topped with mexican cheese, tortilla bits and avocado. I also did not add jalapeños to chili but had as garnish for those who wanted more of a kick.

This is very good. VERY spicy. Next time I probably won’t do the whole pealed tomato’s. Ill just replace those with regular canned tomatoes, and Ill cut down on the chili pepper and  hot peppers.

It was delicious.  I doubled the jalapenos in this recipe, because I prefer more heat.  It's a good base recipe, so I will make it again with minor variations.

Very good. I subbed the veggie burger crumbles for ground turkey, and cooked the turkey with the olive oil and garlic at the very beginning. Took out the turkey, then followed the rest of the recipe as is, only putting the turkey back in when it said to put the crumbles in. I added some more spices too, like garlic salt, onion powder and cinnamon. We also let it sit on low for about 2 hours before eating. Serve over cornbread.

Super spicy! I would go down to 1 can of chiles instead of 2 and maybe go to 1.5 jalapeños seeded. I would also increase the chili powder maybe an extra Tbsp or 1t cumin extra for more chili flavor. I cooked my own beans from dry in the Instant Pot because it’s super easy. This recipe is good tho and will definitely make again!

I enjoyed this recipe so much that this is my 2nd time making it in just a month. I never use the can child peppers. But everything else in it is AMAZING!!!! I'm actually vegan, but this recipe does it for me.

Delicious! I left out the jalapeño peppers because I didn’t want it to be too spicy. This was the first time I ever prepared a specifically vegetarian dish and everyone loved it.

I added a can of RoTel diced tomatoes and green chilies, and a small can of regular diced tomatoes.  The recipe made a large pot of chili that could feed at least 8 people.
The chili was great!  I made it to take to friends who are vegetarians. My husband and I didn’t even miss the meat! I will be making this again..

I’ve been a hardcore meat eater my whole life but have been looking for alternatives to live a healthier lifestyle. This recipe absolutely lived up to its name. It’s incredible. The only thing I will do next time around is not include the black pepper. It’s definitely got enough heat without it. And the faux meat tasted just like the real thing. I’m ready to enter a chili cook off now. Haha.

Excellent recipe! Makes a BIG batch. It seemed a little heavy on the chili powder and salt so I added extra corn (juice and all), to mellow it down from being a touch bitter from that. Will make it again!

Truly the World’s best.  Easy to make and left overs go in the freezer for next weekend.  

I do not use the meet substitute, instead I just add another can of kidney or garbanzo beans.

This was really good chili!  I amended it a little by using half the amount of green chiles and only one jalepeno because I was making it for a big group which included kids.  It was still fairly spicy so, I think that was a good move.  I also used sautéed crumbled tofu instead of the veggie burger & it worked out well.

I never thought I would like let alone love vegetarian chili.  This is a fabulous & delicious recipe. I made it for my Bookgroup because we had one person who is a vegetarian and everyone loved it.  Many requested the recipe ! You won’t go wrong. I used Beyond Meat Crumbles.

First time I’ve posted on this site. This is an awesome recipe! I did very little different except reduced the fire/hotness. My fire reduction: used 1 jalapeño pepper not 2; used 1/2 can of green chiles not 2 cans; and used about 1 tsp of chili powder vs 1/4 cup. Other tips: used Muir organic whole peeled tomatoes: I first put tomatoes in large deep bowl and crushed by hand, removing the tough core-ends when I could. (Wear old shirt or apron as these squirt a bit during this process) I wasn’t sure if the final product would be too liquidy, so I reserved about 3/4 cup of the tomato juice and I did add about half of that before the final 45 min of cooking. (The chili is still cooking right now..and it looks as though there is enough liquid) Being a meat-eater, I never bought the crumbles product in my life... it is amazing. Meeting friends today for a pre-Halloween gather-around-the-fire pit and watch scary movies outdoors. Several are vegetarians so I wanted to make something everyone could enjoy. So happy I found this recipe!

This is an excellent base recipe.  I think it gets good reviews because the recipe tolerates modifications well.  I'm not vegetarian, so I add a pound of ground beef.  In addition, the chili improves from being frozen.  I make a pot and freeze most of it into single-serving plastic containers, and it makes a week or two of lunches.  I suggest waiting until the end of the cooking process before salting and sugaring to taste.

Very good! I omitted the jalapenos and celery and subbed orange bell peppers for green bell peppers. I also doubled the black beans and left the garbanzo beans undrained. I used Beyond Beef crumbles and they ended up a little dry so next time I'm going to saute them separately just until cooked through and add them at the end. Topped with vegan cheese (I use Daiya mozzarella). Plenty of spice and flavor!

LOVED this for myself. I put 1 bag of meatless instead of 2, no green pepper or jalapeño. Added 40 ounces of tomato juice and one less can of diced tomatoes. Let it simmer for an hour. Threw some cheese over it and oyster crackers. So good!!! Thanks for sharing your recipe. This is gonna be a staple protein packed meal for me. :)

I used a little less chili powder and more veggies also continuing  to stir helps so the sauce dose not burn the bottom of the pot. Made for some of my friends that are not vegan and the loved the “meat”.

I've made this many times over the years and it's always delicious. I usually leave out the jalapenos and celery since I don't like either of those. I would say this recipe is a serving for 10 if you eat it with rice. It freezes up well for future dinners.

I did not use the meat crumbles at all. I substituted one of the crushed tomatoes with 2 14oz cans fire roasted tomatoes. I did not seed the jalapeno peppers. Otherwise, followed the recipe. It was delish!!!

LOVE this recipe, though I do make a minor substitution with the chili powder. I use Aleppo pepper instead, it has a smoother taste than the chili powder, and does not leave a "powdery" taste in the mouth.

I follow this recipe, but also added in 1lb of cubed butternut squash. It’s always the first thing to go when I bring it to a party.  Sometimes I’ll sauté ground turkey breast instead of the crumbles. Obviously not vegetarian that way but it sure is good!

This is the best vegetarian chili I have ever made, hands down. Here are a few things I like to change/add to the recipe:

- I lower the amount of veggie burger and add about half a container of baby bella mushrooms. 
- I substitute baby red and yellow peppers for one of the green peppers for color/flavor.
- I like to buy the italian seasoned tomatoes. Sometimes, I cut back to just 2 28 oz cans, depending on what else I add.
- I like SPICE so I prefer the HOT green chilis with added hot sauce. Gochujang is DELICIOUS in this recipe.
- I triple the amount of cumin!
- I serve this over quinoa with green onions and avocado.

I've made the recipe countless times and it just keeps getting better and better.

I've been making this for years and my go to comfort food, freezes well, everyone loves it.  The only modifications I have made is I use 1 1/2 jalepeno unless they are very small peppers as I like it a little less spicy.  I also don't add the corn.  Otherwise I make exact and it is delicious, nutritious and so satisfying every time!  I usually serve over brown rice and put a little cheddar cheese on top!  LOVE THIS CHILI

This was delicious! When I saw the quantity of the ingredients in this recipe, I immediately knew I had to cut it down in half. I omitted  the Jalapeños and cans of green Chile’s because I did not want it too spicy for the kids. I used 1 28oz can of whole tomatoes with the juice and 1 10oz can of Rottele diced tomatoes with chiles.  I left the seasoning quantity the same except for the salt, pepper and chili power which I also cut down to half. I used 2 cans of beans ( 1 can kidney and 1 can black) drained,  instead of the 3 cans, omitting the garbanzos.  This made the perfect quantity.  I served it over white rice and it was delicious!

This is an awesome chili I've made multiple times for Meatless Monday when I cook big for my vegetarian friends.  I add chopped carrots and zucchini to amp up the veggies.  Also decreased the "beef" soy crumbles to 1 1/2 bags.  I throw everything into my slow cooker and let it rock on high for about 6 hours.  Served with rice or cornbread, it is a winner in Western NY!

Really, the best chili I've ever had. I love this recipe. 
It's pretty perfect as is, but is easy to adjust for personal taste. I half the chili powder and only use one bag of crumbles, sometimes i use a whole onion, sometimes i only use one jalapeño or bell pepper. I tend to always have the canned stuff on hand, so the fresh stuff i adjust as needed.
Works well with both Morningstar and gardein crumbles 
I always have trouble getting the tomatoes to mash. I recommend putting them in, boiling a few minutes, then using a potato masher to squish them up before putting the rest of the chunky stuff in.
Also, make sure you have a really big pot, my largest pot isn't big enough and i have to divide it up into two pots to finish cooking ??

I found this recipe a while back and have made it many times since - it is always a hit! Very good recipe!

The first time I made this, it came out great and I followed the recipe to the letter. I have since made a few modifications just to suite my own tastes, but this is still certainly a 5 star veggie chili recipe! Highly recommended to vegetarians as is and can easily be made vegan just by changing up the brand of "meat crumbles" you use.

I love it.  I added chinese five-color hot peppers to make it spicier.  Brown sugar and/or liquid smoke are additions worth considering.  Some might even consider vegetarian bacon bits (made from soy).

There is no way this recipe should call for 1/4 cup of Chilli Powder! Maybe try 1/4 teaspoon as I did and it was perfect. Remember, you can always add spice but never take away.

Delicious! I made this exactly as directed with a couple of small adjustments to the chilli and jalapenos. For me, I prefer mid-spicy - gives you a runny nose, but doesn't leave you begging for milk. Here are some rough spice guidelines: 

Mild: Use 1 tsp chilli (or none of you're really sensitive) and remove seeds from jalapenos.
Mid-Mild: 2-3 tsp chilli.
Medium: 5 tsp chilli.
Mid-Spicy: 2 heaped tbsp chilli. (Heaped 1/8 cup)
Spicy: 3 heaped tbsp chilli.
Extra Spicy: 4 heaped tbsp chilli. (1/4 cup)

I didn't have fresh jalapenos, so I tossed in about a dozen pickled jalapeno slices.

I simmered this for about an hour on medium heat. Low heat wasn't enough to keep the simmer going for me. It's a forgiving recipe, so cooking times don't need to be exact and since there's no meat, there's nothing to worry about if you don't hit a specific temperature.

Last tip: this recipe calls for a large pot... this recipe makes so much food you'll need a large STOCK POT. If you don't own one, I recommend halving the recipe. You'll probably still have leftovers.

Enjoy. Hope this helps someone.

This chili turned out so delicious! When it was finished I took off the lid to taste test and was blown away by how perfect it was. My friends downed almost the whole crockpot. =) I mostly followed the recipe with a few additions; I added an anaheim pepper, double the jalapeño’s, a red pepper, and my favorite no-salt seasoning to replace the oregano I was out of.

Good base recipe & first time no asked me if it was vegetarian!  I left out garbanzo beans & used a poblano instead of green, also didn’t use green Chile’s or green pepper, added red bell pepper though, also left out corn.

This is a very good recipe and easy to customize to your liking.  I followed the basic directions. 
I sauteed the onion with bay leaf with seasonings then added garlic and veggies and a jalepeno pepper. I used low sodium black beans and no salt kidney beans to cut down on salt.  And i added the corn with the beans so it can all cook together. And for chili seasoning i used a tex mex blend which added a nice flavor. I didnt add salt because i'm trying to watch salt intake. But the seasonings plus the chili packet was perfect.

I LOVE this recipe!!! I am always trying to guess how much of each spice I need to add in my chili. This recipe has taken all the guess work out. I will always use it now! Here are my (minor) modifications. I don't use the meat substitute and just use whatever bell peppers I have on hand. I also throw in a can of tomato paste. I also cover all the ingredients with water and cook in my crock pot until done. It's a family favorite.

This is one of two vegetarian recipes I used for my chili. I used the idea of sauteing crumbled Tofu with minced garlic, 1/4 cup chili powder, and onions in a little oil, eventually adding the rest of the ingredients into the pot. Since I like my chili hot and spicy, I also added red pepper flakes, Tobasco, and oregano. With buttery, honey cornbread on the side, it was a real hit on a 'chilly' night.

This is AMAZING!!!  I used 2 (14 ounce cans of diced tomatoes) + 2 cans diced tomatoes with green Chile’s and omitted the jalepenos and other diced chiles.  It was still spicy, but not too hot.  Poured it over a baked potato.  Was really good!

AMAZING! I made this for my graduation party and people loved it. I wanted to have everything be meat free. I had multiple people who LOVE meat tell me that this was the best chili they ever had.  Score one for vegetarians everywhere!!!

This was good, but lacked... something. i might try adding mushrooms next time for a more hearty, meat-like flavor. I pan fried the onions, celery, bell peppers, jalapeno, and garlic, then dumped that along with the remaining ingredients in a slow-cooker. I subbed 1/3 of the cans of "whole peeled tomatoes, crushed" with stewed tomatoes as someone suggested and used only 1 jalapeno pepper which turned out fine. I think in terms of spice, the key is to smell your chili powder and jalapeno pepper (sliced open) to see how spicy/flavorful they seem, then add accordingly to taste. I also suggest not cooking the chili for too long as the burger crumbles completely fell apart. This amount makes an entire crock-pot full of chili to the point where I ran out of room for corn and 3 of the veggie burger patties. Chili for days!

Very good, excellent recipe!  Unfortunately I am on a salt free diet so I was unable to salt it, but it was very good for all our guests.

Absolutely the BEST chili that I had ever had!  My family of 7 loved it, and the two families that we had over for dinner loved it!  To die for!

I love this Chili. I make 4 servings and it’s about 3 days of meals for one. I make it a “chilicado” and top it with Mexican cheese, sour cream and avocado. I also add mushrooms, Bloody Mary mix and a dash of steak sauce (check the label to make sure its vegetarian).

Amazing!!!! I only had one can of whole tomatoes, so I subbed a box of Pomi chopped tomatoes, a can of tomato paste, and 2 cans of rotel. I used only one can of green peppers and added a small zucchini. A crowd pleaser for everyone! I also used a whole onion and about 6 cloves of garlic, and used pinto beans instead of garbanzo beans. I changed some of the ingredients, I know, but the base of this recipe is a wonderful formula to make awesome chili. I really appreciate it ??

I made this for two of us several times.  I made it yesterday for a football play off party and it was a big hit.   Several people want the recipe.   Nice change from the beef and bean chili.  Used the recipe exactly as written.   It didn't help the Eagle's game but it made halftime pretty good.

It is fantastic! I needed to add some sort of sweetener to cut a bit of the acid. It has a little kick to it so omit the jalapeño and some of the chili powder if you want to.

My daughter is vegan and I made this for the whole family to eat.  I followed the instructions with the exception I did not add jalapeños and used gardin vegan crumbles instead of the one suggested (not vegan) It was super easy to make and deliscious!  Just the perfect amount of kick to it.  It’s hardy and the best part is that no one else in the family noticed it was vegan!  A keeper for sure

Made this last night and my family absolutely loved it. I personally didn't think it was 100% delicious, but that was my own fault. I did not have enough canned tomatoes, so I substituted with tomato sauce, which made it a bit tangy. Added brown sugar which helped a lot. Would definitely make again and follow receive 100%

I do not like garbanzo beans so I just left them out.  It was a little more liquidy than we like our chili so we had to cook it down longer, but the flavor profile was nice.

Great recipe. This was still really flavourful even though I omitted the jalapenos and the black pepper and only added one can of the green chile peppers (one of the people this was made for is a 90 year old woman - didn't want to make it too spicy). Also, added the beans with their liquid and omitted the added tablespoon of salt. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe!

We have a lot of veggie friends and I have made this a couple of times. It's super hearty and very tasty. I grill the jalapenos before putting them in (fire-roast). That adds some nice flavor.  Not too spicy. Lots of good flavor!

Turned out really well without any changes. I topped the servings with avocado and chopped red onion with tortilla chips on the side. Next time will probably add some extra kidney beans and maybe less crumble.

This turned out great! I was worried it would be too spicy so I used one jalapeño and a little less chili powder. It was less Spicy than I like, but my guests all appreciated that it wasn’t too spicy. It fed over 10 people as part of a Christmas Eve buffet and I still had left overs for myself the next day!

Very delicious! Made a meat and a veg version. Did not put the veggie crumbles in until right before serving. I find they get chewy if they soak up too much liquid.

Yes! My pickiest vegan family members loved it as well as our meat eaters! Said it was the best chilli ever. I must agree!

My 10 y.o. son and I made this together. In addition to draining the two cans of beans per the recipe, we also drained the corn and green chile liquids. We're a family of three kids 10 and under, so only used 1 can of green chiles, no bell peppers, and no jalapeno peppers...no other revisions! It's still simmering on the stove, but it tastes terrific already! Thank you for sharing the recipe!

This recipe depends upon the ingredients of the bean burger that you used.  For example, mine are spiced with chipolte seasoning and are already a bit spicy.  I decided to try have a recipe.  My store only had the patties so I had to thaw them and break them up.  I used fire roasted tomatoes instead of plain ones to go along with the smoky flavor of the chipolte.  I used New Mexico chili powder which is a bit milder.  I exclusively used kidney beans (2 cans) because the burgers were already black bean. I added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  I also added some frozen corn, not a lot since the frozen burgers already had that ingredient.  It seems to be missing something in the spice category but I am going to let it sit in the refrigerator for a day before I adjust it.

We love things spicy so I used hot green chilis, med-hot chili powder and added extra hot habanero sauce to taste.  Also subbed a large can of rotel tomatoes for the crushed, red peppers for the green and only used 1 tsp of salt, two tsp of cumin.  Was very flavorful and spicy!

This chile is delicious - you won't miss the meat at all. In fact, I don't think my kids even noticed that it was vegetarian. Using the spices in the beginning made a world of difference. I did use a package of chile seasoning instead of regular chile powder. Wonderful- have made it many times!

I loved the "meaty" texture that the veggie burgers provide- genius!  The 1/4 cup of chili powder was way too much for my taste; reducing that was the only thing I changed.

This chili is DELICIOUS!! I made minor adjustments. I used a whole onion, extra garlic, and 2 cans of fire roasted tomatoes with green chilis instead of the crushed tomatoes because that's what I had on hand. I also added a little vegetable broth. Topped with sour cream, cheese, and some Trader Joe's fritos. Obsessed! This will be my chili recipe for life.

I realized I didn't have enough tomatoes so I dumped in some salsa to make up for it. Still delicious, filling and kept me coming back for more! Try it the midwestern way with cheese, sour cream, and crushed Fritos.

Exceptionally good! I ended up substituting the chili powder with a 1/4th cup paprika, 1 tablespoon dried oregano, 1 tablespoon garlic powder, and 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper. Turned out to be a nice spicy chili!

Great chili!  Followed the recipe to a T and didn't feel it lacked anything to experience a great bowl of chili.  Sprinkle some grated cheese over the top, add a dollop of sour cream,  serve it with corn bread,  and you'll be in chili heaven.

Super yummi!  I didn't have the can of green chilis so I used 2 fresh ones, heat was perfect for my son and he can eat it fairly hot  - it wasn't overwhelming.  Good balance of spices.  Toss it in the crock pot in the morning and let it simmer in it's glory all day long.  Topped with chedder cheese, cilantro, green onion, avocado and sour cream.

Didn’t make any changes except only used one jalapeño and it was excellent. Made a ton of chili, definitely more than 8 servings. I had to switch pots in the middle of cooking. Everyone loved it, even the meat eaters! Great with a dollop of sour cream and sprinkle of cheddar cheese. Paired it with the buttermilk cornbread from this website. Healthy & delicious!! Definitely making it again.

First time I’ve felt sufficiently motivated to write a review. This was an excellent pot of chilli - which isn’t a “fine dining” meal but the kind of food most of us put on the table seven nights a week. I am not vegetarian so a pound of ground beef went in. I used one whole jalapeño and one can of chilies as I was taking a couple of bowls to a friend. This mix had a little kick; I really enjoy spicy food though so I will follow the recipe exactly next time.  I also added chopped carrots and zucchini just because I like them. Even though I made changes I feel I can recommend this recipe because it’s really the spice mix that makes a chili.

this made WAY more than 8 servings, but I ain't complaining! as a carnivore, this was delicious, and I'm glad to have plenty of leftovers! I omitted the jalapenos for my wife (she can barely eat bell peppers without tearing up), but i feel like it didn't affect the recipe much if at all. just add hot sauce if you want it to be TRULY spicy ?????????

This was delicious!  My family likes things very mild, so I changed the following:  used 1 whole onion, cut the jalapenos and black pepper out entirely, used only 1 can of green chilis, used approximately 1/2 of the chili power to taste.  I also cut the crumbles back a couple of ounces just because we like beans more than vege meat overall.  Served with chips, cheese and sour cream and everyone loved it!

I was shocked by how spicy it was.  I'm not averse to a little heat but I only used 1/2 of a seeded jalapeno, and it was a bit uncomfortable to eat.   I know, I sound like a wimp but perhaps my pepper was unusually strong.  Consider leaving out the pepper and add heat to taste after completed with some cayenne.  I used only one bag of crumbles which was plenty.  The texture was good, and I would recommend the recipe less the heat.

I enjoyed the spiciness of this recipe however it was very thick from the beginning and only got thicker. Next time I would add some tomato juice in as well. Personally I don't like so many beans in my chili so I blended some with some of the smashed tomatoes to make them a bit less noticeable.

Great recipe, the proportions were perfect to creating a massive quantity of thick hearty chili. A bit timid on the spices, I ended up throwing additional can of hatch green chili, pickled jalapenos and a can of vegan enchilada sauce in for good measure. Drained and washed all the beans and I didn't need to add any salt. Brought to boil then on low heat to simmer for two hours.
Made the mistake of buying crushed canned tomatoes (basically tomato paste) instead of whole tomatoes in a can and then crushing them. It still turned out great!
Just so you know, this feeds a LOT of people, and when they say you need a large pot, you need a LARGE POT! After throwing all the ingredients into my oversized dutch oven, I only had about a centimeter of clearance until it boiled down a bit.

This is my go-to chili! I only use 2 cans of whole tomatoes and one 6oz can of tomato paste. Also, I leave out the burger crumbles - it doesn’t need them.  I just dump it all in a slow cooker for 8 hrs on low. The last hour I leave it partially uncovered to let it thicken up.

Recipe is perfect as is. I have a friend's who can't have corn or black beans, so I heated them separately and served on the side! Loved it. made a double batch and froze leftovers for later.

Excellent and packed full of veggies. I like to add carrots, and I do as the author suggested in the comments, but otherwise follow the recipe to the letter, and it always turns out great.

Great chili, I omitted the corn and added an extra can of black beans. Also used crushed tomatoes instead of whole peeled, great chili!

I made this for a chili potluck at our school.  There were some leftovers and my whole family loved it too!  I did cut down the chili powder to 1 heaping tsp. (we don't like things spicey) and then just put the jar of chili powder near the chili  for those who like things with more kick!

It's really spicy, so I would probably either leave out the the jalepeno peppers or add some cinnamon. Also, 1/4 cup of chili powder is a lot. I definitely didn't use that much and it was fine. 
Also wish the recipe had told me how much it was going to make! At least I won't be going hungry for a while!!

This was soooooo good!  Instead of canned tomaotes, I used about 8 cups of Roma and heirloom tomatoes from my garden, blanched them to remove the skins, and crushed them with my hands.  I also used a second can of kidney beans instead of garbanzos since that's all I had on hand.  Delicious!

This was excellent.  I didn't have any vegetarian crumbles and don't really care for meat substitutes anyway, so I added an extra can of beans.  This was fantastic.  Adding the corn at the end adds great texture.  I used only one can of green chilis and the spice was good for me but could certainly be spicier if that's what you like.

The base is great, hits all the staples. However I used couscous instead of veggie burgers since I'm not a fan, and it was good. I did have to double the spices. I think perhaps if you left some jalepeno seeds that wouldn't be a problem. You can pretty much add any vegetable you'd want into it and it would work.

Made this tonight and it was fantastic!! Truly an old chili replacement!!! For those that said it’s too spicy they clearly live in the bland part of the world or can’t cook! Always test your jalenpenos before adding them, that’s a given . Our family isn’t a fan of chick peas so I substituted Kuners chili beans:) so delicious . Living in a heart healthy house I would never add 1T of salt to anything it was just fine with 3/4 tsp. Totally making this again

I liked trying to cook chili for 45 minutes on the stove vs. a crock pot. However this was very, very spicy!! I had to each a ton of saltines to bare how hot it was. I also didn't prefer the whole tomatoes. I'll try this recipe again, however with diced tomatoes and only 1 jalapeno.

My husband has a very, exquisite palate, I’m gonna say, and he liked it. Dominican man liked it should say a lot. I did however add a Mexican twist that enhanced it. Loved it. Fresh cheese, fresh tomatoes, a poblano pepper and fresh beans.

I love this chili and make it monthly. The only things I changed was, no onions because me and my boyfriend hateeee them but that’s why we make the chili ourselves and I also only use one bag of Gardein meatless crumbles. Two was just too much for us personally. Otherwise this recipe is perfection!

I doubled this recipe. I didn’t have any bay leaves and not enough chili powder. I had just under half of what I needed, so I used Dimply’s Rub & Grill Authentic Memphis Pork Dry Rub Seasoning & Marinade to fill in the rest of what I needed to double the recipe. I put in the tomatoes with the juice. I let it simmer for 2 hours, then added 2.5 pounds of plain cooked hamburger meat. From there I simmered the chili for another hour. Topped with sour cream and shredded cheese and served with plain biscuits. The 3 grown men in my family loved it. Only 1 had seconds, but he can a eat a horses’ worth of food and Lord knows where he puts it! All in all this was well worth the time and effort and filled the vast emptiness of the bellies in my family very well.

We liked this chili. The only change I made was to reduce the chili powder from 1/4 cup to 2 tablespoons. It was still spicy enough for us, with the 2 jalapeno peppers.

Everything blended really well together but I wish there was an easy way to half the recipe- using just half of the cans of beans would have been a waste at our house- we had so much left over. I really liked putting a spoonful of Greek yogurt in mine.

Fabulous!  Made half with veggie “meat” for my vegetarian daughter in law and added ground beef to the other half for my carnivore son!  Delish!

This would be five stars, but it was WAY too spicy.  I'll try again without the jalapenos and half of the chili powder.

Excellent! Easy, very adaptable, based on what beans or veggies you have handy. I used dried kidney, black beans & pintos. I used all measurements as written & my only modification was I added a jar of salsa ( I always add a jar of salsa about 30 minutes before I serve it) and it is now my”go to” chili recipe!

I'm not the biggest fan of vegetarian chili, but I just ate three bowls of this one! After reading the reviews,  I thought it would be best if I made  just a half a batch - and I'm glad I did.  Its just me and my hubby in the house so even a half batch was MORE THAN PLENTY.  I figured I could freeze some if needed. I don't like spicy food so I left out the jalapeno entirely but did include the green chili peppers. I didn't have any cumin so that got left out as well. It worked out fine for me! And, for some reason, I thought the recipe called for too much chili powder so I didn't put much in. Next time I make it, I will put in the listed amount of chili powder. Still, we both really liked this recipe. I did use vegie-burger crumbles. I might  substitute the crumbles for ground turkey the next time I make it but really, this was very good as it was. The corn (canned) added a little bit of crunch in there. Its all about what you like...my hubby said he'd like more celery next time and the right amount of chili powder. I did rinse the beans before adding. I love cheese so I grated some cheddar on it. I can see making this for a potluck. YUMMY!

Definitely very good.  The primary tastes are tomato and spice. I removed the seeds and membranes from the jalapenos and added in a tablespoon of smoked paprika. Not being a vegetarian myself, I missed the flavor of beef, but even so I will make this again.  Take note, this recipe would not fit in my 6-quart pot.

It was tasty, however it was way too hot! Cut back on the Jalapeño peppers and the chili powder. 
Next time I’ll use I/4 to 1/2 of the recommended amounts.

Instead of the vegetarian crumble I used mushrooms. Input them in the food processor and cooked them down first with some salt. I added some Braggs liquid aminos to the mushrooms once they were almost done cooking. 

I put the mushrooms to the side, and added them to the chili in the same time as the crumble was suppose to be added.

My entire family loves this chili. Even those who are not vegan. However when my vegan eater is not at home, my husband insists on using real hamburger. Easy enough. One pound of ground beef cooked and drained. Add to chili at the Same time as "burger crumbles". I feel it's not necessary to simmer for 5 minutes because I believe that is needed when using the frozen crumbles. Only then do you need to simmer 5 minutes. So if your ground beef is pre cooked and frozen, then I would definitely simmer for 5.  So, yes this is now afsmily favorite. It makes a fairly large batch and lasts in my house for about a week. A late night favorite for my husband!

When I read another person state that this was way too spicy hot for them, I knew it would be right for us!  The only changes I made were that I only put one bag of TVP (13.7 oz) in, and I used one can of chilies and one can of jalapeños (as well as the fresh jalapeños).  When I make this again, which I will definitely do, I will use diced tomatoes rather than whole.  Even breaking them up, we found the whole tomatoes to be a little too big for us.  If you find the recipe too spicy hot, put shredded cheese on it and be sure to deseed the jalapeños.  This is a great chili!!!

Very tasty with few modifications. The flavor and texture are wonderful. I'm not a strict vegan and still enjoy meat, but this chili was every bit as good as any I've had. Try it cincinatti style over spaghetti - super!

I made this recipe in the slow cooker.  Sautéed the onions first, with all the spices before throwing everything else in.  I couldn’t find canned chili in the stores so I chopped up 1 Serreno chili, 1 Anaheim chili, 2 small white chili, and 3 jalapeños!  On top of that I threw I added additional Cayenne peppers... we like spicy foods here... it’s only too spicy if my skull perspires to the point I look like I just came out of the shower, other wise it’s good.

Amazing Chili, I made it almost to the exact directions, I did drain and rinse the beans without adding any water which was fine. I had never heard of ‘vegetarian burger crumbles’ ( live in Ontario, Canada) but found something similar and it worked. My hubby is borderline meat-aholic but loved this Chili. Thank you for this recipe.

I've been making this for years now. I had a vegan friend coming for Super Bowl party, so it was mainly for her. Turned out that everyone LOVED it. I made as written the first time, over the years I have altered it. One thing I do now is to make it meatless (I never added the vegan burger) I split the recipe in 1/2, then add cooked ground beef to one 1/2. Never a disappointment !

before I became a vegetarian, my turkey chili was the best, taking second place at my wife's work cooking competition, however, I must say, this chili is by far, tastier, and with health benefits.

I followed the recipe exactly (rinsed the beans though, as others suggested) but I didn't add the jalapeno or canned chili peppers to the chili. Instead, I sauted one jalapeno and one can of green chili peppers together and put them in a small bowl so that people could add more heat if they wanted to. It was a big hit.

I thought this recipe was delicious as is. I did not change a thing. I was surprised at the amount it made. I even shared it with friends and they loved it. Every ingredient in this recipe is healthy. You would not know it was not made out of  ground beef. I would definitely make this again.

I reduced all the spices, except the cumin and it was still a bit spicy. However, overall it was the best chili I've ever had! This made about 12 servings!

Delicious, delicious recipe! Best chili I ever made. Made a turkey chili recipe a couple weeks ago and this is much better even without meat. This recipe has a more tasty, complex flavor.

For everyone who is sodium conscious and (extra) health conscious like I am... I used dried garbanzo, kidney and black beans rather than canned. I added as much low sodium organic vegetable stock as I saw fit (almost an entire small box) to ensure the beans would soften. I also added about 3 tbs of pure organic cane sugar and this chili is some of the best I've made yet!

I added all parts to a crock pot and let it sit overnight (about 10 hours) on low and the beans are all cooked just perfectly.

I've been looking for a new vegan chili recipe. This one was delicious. I did make some changes, not because I thought the original recipe needed it, but because my kids won't eat certain things.
I replaced the 3 cans of whole tomatoes with 2 cans of crushed tomatoes (kids not a fan of chunky tomatoes), I reduced all the spicy ingredients by 1/2 (i.e. jalapeño peppers, chili powder, green chilies, and black pepper), and I only used 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt (for my hubby). Still had a bit of kick to it, but not so much that the kids wouldn't eat it. All 3 kids gave the recipe their stamp of approval and my husband gave it 4 stars. Thank you so much for the recipe.

I think that this recipe could get away with using only one 12 ounce package of vegetarian meat crumbles and the brand is very important. I purchased a brand called Beyond Meat and it was not pleasant at all. Next time I will use MorningStar burger patties and crumble them up.  Overall I think the recipe is sound and the few reviews that I’ve read saying why add the meat substitute it all is actually a great question. I don’t think this recipe even needs a meat substitute.

This recipe is amazing! My husband and I have been doing the Daniel Fast and this was a perfect recipe for what we are able to eat. The only thing I left out was the jalapeños because I don’t like things to spicy. Everything else was followed to the t. It was absolutely delicious. I will be making it again in the future.

This has got to be THE best chili my husband or I have ever had, whether vegetarian or otherwise.  The only thing I may do differently next time is not keep quite so much of the liquid from the 3 cans of tomatoes.  It was a bit "soupier" than I prefer, but nevertheless, this is now our favorite go-to chili recipe!

FIND ANOTHER RECIPE!!!

Waste of time and money!!!  Wayyyyyyy tooo much seasoning!!!  The front taste tasted like all tomato and the flavor on the back end was all powdered seasoning.
Called for 1/4 chili powder and 1 Tb black pepper!! 
Flavor is hardly bearable. I will have to stomach through as much of the largesssst batch of chili ever and throw the rest away. 
As I spent a bunch of money and time on this, I am pretty unhappy that I still have nothing to eat.

Absolutely delicious, and you'd never know it was vegetarian. Only edit I would make is to reduce the meat substitute by 50%. What the recipe calls for is, for us, too thick.

LOVE IT!!!! This is amazing and I’m not a chili lover!! So easy! I put everything in the crockpot and cooked on low for 8 hrs. I didn’t have a jalapeño or diced green chilies so I just omitted them and it still had tons of flavor! I cut the recipe in half and it still made tons with leftovers from a family of 4! Thanks for this awesome find!

This was very yummy! I substituted chipotle peppers in adobo  for jalapeños, gave the dish a nice smokey flavor. I only used half the salt. Thawed  and crumbled southwest veggie burgers in place of veggie crumbles.    I let is simmer for about 3 hours.   The flavor was delicious.

So good! I cut down by about 1/2 on the black pepper and chili powder. I only used one can of black beans and 1 jar of home canned october beans. Used one can of rotel tomatoes with jalapenos with one can of home canned tomatoes. Used about 1 tsp of  jarred jalapenos because I didn't have any on hand.

I accidentally cooked the corn in with everything else, but it still turned out delicious!  I also used half the vegetarian crumbles.  Great with rice and delightfully spicy but not TOO hot for our tastes-- everyone who tried it loved it!

I am new to cooking and am new to vegetarian food.  I made this and it was sooooo good.  I waited till after people were complimenting me on it before telling them it was vegatarian.  Thank you.  Also, my son wanted a quesadilla and so i just scooped out some chili, spread it on a tortilla shell, added some cheddar cheese and heated it up on a frying pan, flipped it over and cut it up like a pizza and he absolutely loved it.

Chili was really good, I would add one less can of tomatoes in the future or maybe a little sugar to cut some of the acidity. Nonetheless I made it for my carnivorous coworkers and they loved it. Paired with Jalapeño Cheddar biscuits it was amazing.

I put my tomatoes in a blender and pulsed a couple of times to break them down as my husband isn't crazy about tomato chunks.  Loved the spices.  I'll be making it again!

Excellent vegetarian chili! I get all bloated and gassy when I eat fake meat so I omitted the veggie ground and added about 500g of finely chopped mushrooms. I added them with the onions at the beginning. The only consequence of this is I believe the chili turned out a little thinner due to the moisture from the mushrooms.  But! This was still super tasty and next time I'll just add a can or 2 of tomato paste... plus, my wife will be happier with me without the farts.

I will definitely make this again. Based on other reviewer comments about spiciness, I used only 1 jalapeño and 1 can of green chiles, because I wanted children to eat it. I used a roll of veggie sausage in place of one of the crumbles packs, to add flavors. Then all of my canned beans were no salt added since the veggie meats have so much sodium. The recipe makes SO much!! 3 adults and 1 child had our fill, and I have 6-8 servings still for leftovers.

Used one jalapeno and reduced the chili powder a bit. Also added a zucchini.  Threw it in the crock pot after prepping the beginning ingredients on the stove.  And used ground turkey. Really tasty and hearty.

Great basic recipe. I personally needed a little more spice (some dried ghost pepper) and a little sugar, if I had fresh corn that would have been great. I needed just a bit of acid so a bit of vinegar did the trick. Will definitely make again, thank you for the recipe!

Honestly, this is the best chilli I’ve ever tasted, let alone made! Highly recommended to anyone looking for a new chilli recipe or, like myself, anyone wanting to try vegetarian dishes for health reasons. 5 Stars for sure!

My spouse and I both agreed that this was the best chili we'd ever had, vegetarian or otherwise (although we've both been vegetarian for 30 years).  I made this almost exactly as directed, except that I was nervous about the spiciness after reading the comments, so I cut back a bit on the chili powder and used a very small jalapeño as the second pepper, as well as the mild version of the canned chiles.  I am extremely sensitive to "hot", but this was well within my tolerance so I'll likely not reduce the spicy stuff next time.   This is absolutely going to be one of our regulars from now on!

Okay, so I am not a vegetarian. I made this for football Sunday yesterday. “OMG” this was amazing. Thank you so much for the recipe. Now I am stuck making it for my Veggie friends all the time now, with pleasure. I couldn’t believe the flavor that came out of it.

Absolutely the BEST veggie chili and THE only one I'll make! The only small change I made was that I used only 1 jalapeño and decreased the salt by half.  Great as is or certainly adaptable based on what I've got on hand.  I've omitted corn and garbanzo beans before or added an extra  pepper (green, yellow or red)  or added zucchini or mushroom...the veggie options are customizable and easy to adapt.  I like Gardein brand veggie crumbles best! I freeze in individual servings and take to work.  Very Good

Made it!  I added a 2 poblano peppers (I roasted them) because the store was out of jalapeno.  It was delicious!  Thank you!  I also used 1 or 2 peppers of roasted jalapeno in adobo sauce.  I made a double batch.  I also reconstituted a batch of kidney beans.  I also used some of the beans suggested.  The meat crumbles I used were gluten free, "Beyond Meat."  I picked these up at Target.   Okay, I'm making it again.  Thanks for sharing!

I'm basing my 5-star rating on the version I made.
I didn't use the garbanzo beans, but used instead my pinto beans  made from dry beans plus I didn't add vegetarian "meat" substitute. 
The flavor comes from from the herbs mostly. The corn adds nice sweetness and wholesomeness.
Definitely a "make-again" recipe. BTW, I am not a vegetarian but loved this recipe. I don't miss the meat at all.

I made this chili last night and my husband and I loved it. I took some to my parents  and they loved it too!  I made a few changes. I didn’t use oil and I only used 2 - 28 oz  cans of tomatoes and I didn’t use the green chili’s and only one fresh jalapeño and it was almost to hot for me, but not the men in the family!!

I made this for a family dinner and it was a huge hit! I only used 2 cans of tomato and then added a 24 ounce can of beer giving the whole chili a beer base, which is how we like ours. I did half the pepper portion in half just in case and it wasn't spicy. We are making this recipe again less than a week later. Yum!

Made this for a family dinner,  everyone loved it. I made a double batch and after cooking all the vegetables. I split it in two pots, then added the meatless crumbles for the vegetarians and the other pot I added browned ground beef/ground turkey combo. Both were a hit. The Vegans said that it probably didn't even need the meatless crumbles was nice and filling with the Veggies and beans.  The only thing I did different was I used crushed tomatoes in place of the whole tomatoes.

Simple loved this dish!  I didn't have jalapeño so I used a 1/2 can of smoked chipotle peppers and one tablespoon of black pepper instead of 2. I had a bunch of tomatoes from the garden and chopped those up in the blender. It still had a good amount of heat without the chili spice. Kids were ecstatic there were leftovers for lunch the next day. We definitely make again. Thanks

This recipe is magical! Such a great variety of flavors working together. Instead of green chiles, I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles. And since the mixture seemed thick, I did not add Boca crumbles, but we didn't miss it one bit. Everyone raved about this chili, even the meat eaters. I will definitely make this one again and again.

This is a fabulous recipe - and I used only one jalapeno pepper and it was a still really spicy.  I recommend you top each serving with shredded Mexican cheese and lots of sour cream  to cut the spiciness a bit.  I'll definitely make again, and possibly cut out the jalapeno pepper - or put in a half of one

Came out delicious! As a meat eater, I couldn't even tell it was vegetarian. It makes a heck of a lot though, I will half the recipe in the future. It did freeze and reheat well though.

I roasted 2 poblano pepper on my gas range top instead of canned green chili's (needed more mild for kids).  also substituted beans cooked from dry instead of canned.  used fresh corn and a combination of fresh tomatoes with canned tomatoes.  I also added a pound of grass fed ground beef.  family agrees...declicous!

I'm really shocked this got as many good reviews as it has. I am a pretty good cook and followed the recipe exactly. The recipe was very tomatoey and didn't have a lot of flavor. For my next vegan chili I'm just going to use my beachbody chili and replace the turkey with crumble since that recipe is so simple and flavorful.

I cut it in half and went without the corn. Just had it for dinner and ate way more than I should have ... really good! Perfect for me; too spicy for my wife. The video showed sauteeing the garlic first which seemed weird and I did not do.

Amazing! My meat-loving husband ate like 3 or 4 bowls. I actually cut back on the spices quite a bit and it was still spicy, but that's okay - still good.

Outstanding chili! The only think I left out was the salt.  I added a red bell pepper and mushrooms just because I love them. Prior to eating I added fresh chopped green onion.

I've made some variation of this chili 8 times now.  It's what caused be to signup and write the review.  It can be spicy for those who are not accustom to it.  But you can add carrots to cut the spice (I don't) add less spicy peppers.  I've made for all spicy pallets.  If it's my in-laws and although they like spicy it's not in their best interest, I don't want to make to batches.  I roast a varietal of chiles separately and add it to the individual bowl.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!

I cut way down on the chili powder, left out the fake meat, added other veggies. But all the other spices in proportion are just right for a terrific chili stew, Served it with cornbread for a family favorite.

Meh, it's good not great. Nothin to write home about but descent. With tweets it could be unique. It's pretty standard chilli with a little kick. Makes a BOAT LOAD so be prepared to share or eat chilli for weeks. Use a big ole stock pot, not your typical large pot or it might overflow. Mine was right on the brim which made it hard to stir.

Will definitely make it again! Instead of the green bell peppers, I used one each of red, yellow and orange bell pepper. A little sweeter flavor which we preferred. Also made the dish more colorful!

This was delicious, even with my adaptations. I did not use any jalapeños or other chilis. I also didn't have kidney or garbanzo beans on hand or zucchini. So I used frozen French cut green beans, black beans, frozen sweet white corn, and pre-cooked black eyed peas. I added some fresh tarragon and an extra 1/2 tablespoon of dried Mexican oregano.  I also used 6 fresh tomatoes, 1 red pepper, and 1 yellow pepper. It was really tasty, but I had to give it to my neighbor ( who loved it) since the tomatoes and peppers don't agree with me. I made this to use up those items which another neighbor had generously given me. Now I need to figure out adaptations that don't include tomatoes and peppers!

This recipe is my go-to Vegan recipe for chili since the first time I made it in 2013. It's flavors enhance chili exponentially, and the jalapeños are superb for just the right amount of 'kick'. It's definitely a vegan option, because not one iota of animal product is used to create this delicious chili, and that's A-OK with me! I use vegan sour cream or homemade cashew cream to top it off and Daiya 'Cheddar Cheese' on top to make it the BEST VEGAN CHILI in the world! Great recipe!

I made this chili for our volunteers at St. Vincent de Paullsst Friday. Several people thought I had put hamburger in the chili by mistake. The hamburger crumbles make the fish.

This is a great recipe.  De-seeding hot peppers will seriously turn down the heat.  Chili is rich and flavorful.  Years ago, I learned at a folk festival how delicious veggie chili is when served over baked sweet potatoes - try it!

This was delicious! Thank you reviewers who mentioned how much it made and how spicy it was! I made half a recipe worth and it filled my 3 quart pot to the top. I like spicy but not too much so I left out the jalapenos and used 1 -28 ounce can of tomatoes and 1 can of Rotel which made it perfect for me.

This chili is amazing. I served it to a house-full of meat eating Italian family members (with vegan veggie-crumbles instead of garden burger) and no one realized it was vegetarian. That said, I skip the jalapenos (for the kids) and alternate the veggie-meat source depending on what we have around. You can't go wrong with this recipe. Thanks!!!

I will return and review the finished product after we eat it, but I want to keep my notes in the meantime.  Changes I made were based entirely on what I had on hand that I wanted to use up and don't deviate so much that it's new recipe.  I used 2 T canned hot chopped jalapeno; 7 oz can green chilies; mix of green, red, and orange peppers; 2 28 oz cans crushed tomatoes; 1 14.5 oz can diced tomatoes; 1 14.5 oz can mild just-for-chili diced tomatoes; and another can drained black beans instead of garbanzos.  I used Boca brand veggie crumbles.  I also left out the corn.  I added ~2.5 cups water too, because this is really thick!

I read several reviews and took some advice.  But first let me say how really, really, good this is.  Neither my husband nor I are vegetarian anything, but we both enjoyed this chili very much.
I did make a few changes:  I used only one bag of the veggie crumbles and it was plenty; I used 2 large cans of the whole tomatoes instead of 3 with the juice and it was plenty; I did drain and rinse everything--beans and corn; and I used only 1 jalapeno since we are not hot and spicy freaks; I was careful with the salt as people suggested; I only had a red and a yellow pepper which was fine.   It turned out very well and made quite a lot!   Will make again.  Thanks for the recipe and the tips!

This chili was the best I've ever made.  It was spicy and delicious.  The only thing I did different was use 2 cans of crushed tomatoes and 1 can of whole peeled tomatoes.

This was delicious. I used a whole onion, twice as many cloves of garlic, and frozen instead of canned corn. It was very spicy for my preference so I would probably cut down on that next time. Amount was huge, so I made half on stove and half in slow cooker. I hand-crushed the tomatoes but also used kitchen scissors to make the tomato chunks even smaller. Will definitely make this again. Great recipe!

This is a great recipe! Just the right amount of spice. I added a can of pinto beans and a bag of frozen corn since I omitted the soy crumbles and carrots. Let it simmer for an hour and a half, leftovers were just as good if not better.

Definitely going to make this chili regularly. Loved everything about it. I would definitely recommend using a food processor on the tomatoes. I don't have one so I crushed them by hand, which took forever and I made a bit of a mess. It does give the chili a more authentic tomato taste though.

Excellent! I have used ground chuck (only because I left the turkey out overnight so I had to sub) and ground turkey.. I'm not generally a huge fan of chili or leftover, but I actually ate it all week for lunch and was actually sad when it was gone! Also I only used one jalapeño, when I eat it I add sour cream, cheese and oyster crackers.

I'm a vegetarian, so I made this recipe for myself. I even made enough to freeze and use the next week. my husband,  a meat eater,  tasted it after raving about how good it smelled. Now my batch of chili is all gone.... even the extra I made for freezing. Haha! It's delicious! It is definitely my new favorite chili recipe.

I only used 1 can of green chili's (because that's all I had on hand).  I also used "American" chili powder and the heat was relatively mild (what I was going for with this particular time).  The other substitution I did was to keep the vegi crumbles on the side so that it could be added on top for those that wanted it (we have a soy and gluten allergy in our family). Today we're planning on having the leftovers on top of baked sweet potatoes.  Will definitely make this one again!

This recipe is perfect as is. I made it without veggie beef crumbles and beans with no added salt to avoid extra sodium. I also used fire roasted tomatoes (2 cans diced, 1 crushed) for added flavor. The spiciness is perfect; if it's too spicy obviously don't use as much chili powder. However, I'm used to spicy food so I made sure to keep the seeds of both jalapeños. That's another area you can adjust if it's too spicy for you. Overall, a perfect chili recipe for winter or sporting events.

It was quite spicy made according to the recipe!
My changes:
So, the next time I made it - I added a little less chili powder.   And I added one can of  peeled tomatoes vs. 2 - and substituted 3 cans of Rotel in place of the other.  I left out the TVP meat replacement & added an extra can of kidney beans instead.
Turned out wonderfully & got rave reviews from my vegetarian friend & my meat eater family!

I made it exactly as listed.  The ingredients call for whole peeled tomatoes crushed, which was a bit confusing.   I bought whole and crushed myself, which gave it a chunky quality that I loved.

I used this recipe to enter a chili cook-off at work. I work for a big agency with a strong meat-eating culture, so my goal was to have people try it and not even realize it was vegetarian. Mission accomplished! I won 3rd prize in the contest, and people were shocked when I said there was no meat in it. I was a bit more liberal with the spices than the recipe calls for, and I added mushrooms to it. It had just the right amount of kick for me personally, but I don't like things too spicy. To make this chili more spicy, leaving the veins in one of the jalapeno peppers could help.  Definitely glad I tried it!

My husband and I have decided to follow a vegetarian diet due to health and religious reasons and we were concerned that we would not find any recipes. Luckily we ran into this  one the first week and decided to try it. Well I am glad we his was the best chili I have ever tried. I have to say I made it a second time with meatless ground that I purchased at HEB and it was just as good. I would recommend everyone try this recipe.

This is amazing! I used banana peppers from my garden instead of the canned green chilis but otherwise followed the recipe. Cooked it in my cast iron dutch oven. perfect amout of heat since I don't care for super spicy. Served over nachos and it was a hit with husband, 4yo, and 2yo.

Quick, easy and delicious!  I added two carrots, a small can of tomato sauce, and teaspoon of both cinnamon and sugar.  I did not use the faux meat.  A do-over recipe.

I loved this recipe, but as a meat eater trying to eat more vegetarian, I still crave savory flavors to I dressed this up a lot! These are my changes.

I swapped the veggie burger crumbles for chopped baby portabella mushrooms.  I recommend cooking the mushrooms with the celery and onions on low heat for a long time at the start and really sweat them for up to 30 minutes on low to muddle the flavors before proceeding.

Then I seasoned it WAY more than they said to.  I added tons more of every seasoning they said to, plus additional garlic, onion, cayenne, Dijon mustard and Worcestershire sauce, (not vegetarian,) hot sauce, and a little sage, and turmeric.

I recommend topping with shredded cheese and eating it with something nice and starchy like crackers, rolls, or chips.

So spicy and so delicious! I make this all the time with some modifications. I do drain and rinse all of the beans and I omit the meatless crumbles so I use an extra can of beans to bulk it up a bit. I also use a 16 oz bag of frozen corn instead of canned as I always have a bag in my freezer. It turns out perfect every time!

I absolutely love this recipe and I've made it two times so far. I am not vegetarian, but I absolutely adore this chili. Yes, it does have a kick to it so be warned. 

I've made it with both fresh jalapenos and canned. They both worked fine with barely a difference. I usually can not find the canned green chilies so I omit them without a problem!

The family loved the recipe!  My wife thought it was a little too spicy for her taste, so next time I may add just a little less of the green chiles.  The spiciness settled down the next day, after it had a chance to cool in the fridge, but it was great both days.

Very good; makes a lot. I like spice, but not too spicy. I used the chili powder in the amount listed and thought it was too much. I didn't use the jalapeños. I think next time, I would just modify the chili powder & use a little jalapeño for flavor.

It was great!  I put it with a homemade vegan cashew  sour cream, vegan cheese, and vegan cornbread and it was an awesome, healthy meal. Per the instructions, I was able to serve 14 large adults and only had maybe two or 3 tablespoons left over.

I wouldn't go as far as 'Worlds Greatest' - this was tasty and I would recommend adding additional cumin, mushrooms of choice - shiitake.   Garnished with oyster crackers and sour cream.

Apt title! Just be careful with the chili powder; I used a new kind that was too spicy and made the whole pot of chili inedible. 
I've made this many times and was thrilled to find the recipe on AllRecipes.

I partially cooked 1\2 bag of dry red kidney beans, pinto beans, and small red beans, then added one can of organic garbanzo beans, one can of salt free black beans, one can of sliced green chili peppers.  I spiced it up with a little more cumin and chilli powder. Great taste!

Excellent vegan recipe! I didn't use a bay leaves and I used diced tomatoes instead of whole. It is a delicious recipe, very hardy, tasty, versatile. It stands alone but it's also great if you are feeding non vegans, you can put the meat in the bottom of the individual serving bowl, pile on the chili, and top with cheese and sour cream for them if you like, or not!

I made this chili for me, and perhaps a few others, at a large party of meat eaters.  I  made  enough to serve 12 people and came home with nothing left in my pot!!! It was such a hit that I've since then shared the recipe with 6 people from the party! I must admit, I added a bit more garlic and cayenne pepper. I'll definitely make it again!

I think this recipe was delicious and nutritious. I highly recommend that you do add a can of whole corn because it gives the chili a nice sweet touch when indulging into it. You can also just make this chili without the meat altrive you don't even notice that their is no meat!

Love this recipe, make it all the time! Only changes I make is adding a little splash of liquid smoke and a can of beer. My vegetarian and non vegetarian friends love this chili, also really good with some fresh cilantro and cheese on top.

I've made this recipe numerous times -- it's definitely my go to for vegetarian chili! Really enjoyed it as written the first time, then went through some of the reviewers' suggestions and have landed on adding a medium zucchini, a handful of sliced carrots, and the slightest shake of cinnamon. Those extra additions put it over the top for me & the fam. 

As an extra note: The first time I made it, I didn't know if I should add the extra tomato juice from the canned tomatoes...so I did, and it was REALLY acidic and the tomato taste overpowered everything. I added a half teaspoon of baking soda, and that saved my batch. Just a suggestion if anyone makes the same mistake (or take it as a warning to not add the extras from the tomato can!) ;) 

Thank you for this recipe and to those who shared their extra tips!

Just made it because of vegetarians coming to our house this weekend.  It’s better than any other “meat” chili I’ve ever made.  I highly recommend it for everyone!!  Thanks for posting this recipe.

I've made this half a dozen times. It really is delicious! There are a lot of ingredients, but there's very little prep. Totally worth making. I add a teaspoon of cayenne to add a little more spice. This chili is pretty mild as is.

This is a awesome chilli recipe! I only used one jalapeno pepper because I thought two would be too spicy. I omit the veggie crumbs, red kidney beans and canned green chile peppers because I didn't have them at home and still got many praises by my gourmet chef hubby. He is a food snob and usually makes dinner at home. He couldn't stop telling me how good the chilli was. I would cut down on the chilli powder (it was a bit too much heat even for us spice lovers) and add some brown sugar to add sweetness to it. I will definitely make it again!

This chili was so spicy hot that I did not enjoy it at all, and I had cut the chili powder and pepper by 2/3.
I  prefer to taste the flavors of all the delicious vegetables with hints of flavors from the spices.

Excellent recipe! Made a few alterations: only added about a tsp of salt, replaced the jalapenos with 4 chipotle peppers with adobe sauce for a smokey flavor, only added 1 can of green  chile peppers, and added a can of white beans. It was still too spicy in my opinion so next time I'll probably 1/2 the chili powder. Made it with the Homesteader Cornbread recipe and put a dollop of sour cream and diced green onion as garnish - delicious!

Love this chili! I cook for meat eaters and vegetarians and both love this recipe. I cook it in a crock pot rather than on the stove. I skip the bay leaves,  and celery (not a fan of it in my chili), and add only one jalapeno, then just add all ingredients except the corn into the pot in the morning (no cooking the onion etc on the stove first), and add the corn an hour before eating!

Simply delicious. I take the jalapeno seeds out and it is just the prefect amount of spice for me. The beans and the corn bring texture to it. I serve it with some lemon juice, a pinch of grated cheese and a few slices of avocado.

I substituted 2/3 cups of lentils and 1/3 cup of quinoa for the vegetarian burger crumbles.  I also substituted roasted Hatch chilies for the canned green chillies.  I also increased the heat a bit.  We really liked the result.

It was great! I cut back a little on the fresh jalapeno since I was serving to guests. Also, recipe does not say it but BAY LEAVES SHOULD BE REMOVED BEFORE SERVING. Years ago I almost choked to death on a bay leaf.

Looks and tastes amazing!  I decided to add turkey burger meat, so it wasn't truly vegetarian. However, even without the turkey meat I know it would be just as amazing.

I made this a few weeks ago.  As I am not vegetarian I used ground turkey instead.  Plus I forgot to buy corn so I used frozen Lima beans.  Also, only 1 TB of oregano.

4 large fresh tomatoes peeled 
Added a small can tomato sauce 
 used only 1/2 jalapeno not whole. 
added cheese after plated
HEAVEN
and it freezes very well. Also left out the canned chile peppers.

I've made this chili MANY times. It's my go to recipe. I always use reduced sodium canned beans (thank you Bush's!) and no salt added tomatoes. This year I'm trying to reduce salt even more so I didn't add the tablespoon of salt (added no salt).  I added a bit more cumin, oregano & garlic.  
To me, this chili is just as tasty without the salt!

I would have given 5 stars except that it was a little to spicy for me.  Next time I will use 1 Jalapeno pepper and see if that helps.

I make this all the time. I personally use the mexican flavour of ground veggie meat by ives and its amazing in this. I also don't use chickpeas as I personally don't love them. I add double the chilli powder but half of it using a mild version. I also add double the cumin and bay leaves. I use 4 large diced tomatoes cans as i like a slightly less thick chilli. Great recipe even with no changes! Well done!

Excellent layers of flavor! I switched out the celery for carrots, since I don't particularly care for cooked celery, and appreciate the texture and sweetness of the fresh carrots. I used 2 different chile powders, and split the amounts, so I avoided the bitterness of regular dry chili powder.  I served it with "scratch-made" cornbread. Absolutely delicious!

This won its name of the Best Vegetarian Chili in the World. Had a cook-off for my work, and this one took first place! I called it "I can't believe it's NOT meaty chili." I added one full carrot, a can of chili beans, and substituted canned jalepeno peppers for the fresh. Came out delicious!

We love this chili recipe. I don't use the crumbles - we are meat eaters and don't miss the meat at all. I mix up the peppers to use whatever variety I have on hand. This is a very flexible recipe - enjoy!

I made this recipe for a work chili cook out event.  I added chili powder as every so often I stirred the chili to mix the spice in. With a dollop of sour cream on top, this recipe is very good & it was a hit with vegetarians at work.  The crumbles might be good marinated in something before cooking.  They are a unique taste if you aren't used to them.

My husband, a carnivore, always orders vegetarian chili for lunch when we go to a nearby mall; I wanted to learn to make it and was thrilled with this recipe.  I read all the others on line first and settled on this one, and it is superb!   I didn't put the green chiles in because I had one very hot jalapeño pepper.   The meatless crumbles add wonderful texture; it's easy to believe it's a regular chili for those who don't eat vegetarian dishes.

Very nice, and soooo easy . . . great for a mom of a toddler.  I made this for a work event to say goodbye to a staff member. He's vegan, so I was struggling to figure out what to bring.  When I found this recipe, I figured it would work for him as well as the rest of the office.  This makes a ton; it completely filled my large crockpot with no room to spare.  I could not find vegetarian crumbles so ended up purchasing two packs of plain veggie burgers, frying them up in a skillet then cutting them up.  I also used canned jalapeno peppers and only about half of a little can.  I left out the salt completely, figuring I could add it later if it needed it but it did not need it at all.  All but two bowls of this chili were eaten at his goodbye; the last two I put out the second day for lunch and they were gone in an instant.  Quite the hit.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe - only changes I made were to only use 1 jalapeño and I added about 1/2 pound of mushrooms. Would be tempted to tone down the salt a bit next time. Would recommend doing salt to taste and also chili powder to taste.

I loved this recipe! I added about two teaspoons of Cajun spice because I didn't want there to be any chance of this not being spicy enough. I love the flavor profile otherwise. I did not add the imitation meat crumbles. My family does not care for that. 
This one is a keeper in my recipe box. Thank you.

This is our go-to, and by far the best chilli recipe in the world! Just add meat, if that's your preference. The green chillies take it over the top. (We usually roast the veg for a fuller flavour, and tone down the chili powde.)

I've made this recipe several times just as it is given (with the exception of the fake meat crumble, I leave that out) and its wonderful! I've also made it several times and added in whatever veggies happen to be fresh/in season and used fresh herbs and it's wonderful that way too.

Couldn't find the the vegetarian burger crumbs, so we substituted it with minced beef which we cooked with a bit of olive oil separately then put in the pot with the rest.. It was really good, but it was a MASSIVELY portion. It was one of 2 main courses between 7 people, but we couldn't even finish half of it.

This was absolutely delish! The spice was perfect as stated, even my meat loving husband loved it and said he would eat the leftovers every day this week. We served topped with a shredded sharp cheddar, sour cream, and a nice glass of red wine.

I almost never leave reviews for food recipes but this was amazing!  Even my family who loves meat raved over this. It was a tad on the spicy side so serve with vegan sour cream just incase! Yummy

Great chili! I just made a few tweaks: added 2 carrots for color, omitted the meat and added 1 cup of amaranth instead (for more protein), and substituted hominy for the corn.  I will definitely be making this again!

Delicious chilli. These are the changes I made I used only one can of green chilli and only one 16 oz package of veggie burgers. I also cut out the jalepenos and used white kidney beans. Turned out amazing. Thanks for the recipe

Rinsed beans thoroughly due to sodium content.  Used tomato sauce and diced tomatoes to add texture.  Also added half the meatless crumble and instead used raw cauliflower that had been processed to be crumbled meat consistency.  Substituted 1 can kidney beans for chick peas, and zucchini for peppers.  Entire family loved it!  It will be a go-to for this half vegetarian, half not family!!

This is the real deal. Excellent recipe. I left out the celery, added another can of tomatoes, and had seconds. Save veggie burger crumbles until almost ready to serve; it will stay in more hamburger size bites.

I doubled this recipe and improvised a little.  I left out some of the canned things and substituted with fresh things. Main additions/substitutions: fresh corn, fresh red bell pepper, fresh cauliflower. I'd make it again!!

This was a great recipe, I use it every time that I make chili now. However, I exclude the vegetarian beef crumbles, as it is hearty enough without it. Also, it was a bit spicy for me, so I opted for a heaping tablespoon of chili powder instead of 1/4 cup. Great recipe!

I am not a vegetarian, I like meat. However I made this at work because one of the guys is a vegetarian. It was full of flavor and was very good. I used creamed beans, and got lots of compliments from my coworkers.

I loved this recipe and so did my friends! There were some things I changed, but they were very minor. I use dried beans, not canned, so that reduced the sodium content greatly. I also added a little bit of spice with some extra chili powder and a little Frank's Red Hot. I ended up doubling the recipe to accommodate the large group of friends I was hosting and there was still plenty left over. This chili is very filling, so I didn't need to serve anything on the side. I will definitely be using this recipe again in the near future.

When I make this, these are the  3 alterations I have to make: 
1) Cut down on the salt! You can salt later. 1 tablespoon is way too much.  
2) 1/4 cup of chili powder is insane. I like spice, but c'mon.  
3) Finally, I love veggies, so I double the onion, add broccoli (

I made this, and my family and I love it!  I will definitely make it again.  I used a whole onion instead of a half, and I used spicy black beans because that's what I had on hand.  It turned out great!  I did not find it too spicy at all.  It has a low level of heat.  If you are used to sweet Midwestern chili you may think it's hot.  I served it  over rice, garnished with chopped cilantro and a lime wedge, and optional reduced fat sour cream and shredded sharp cheddar on the table.  Everyone went back for seconds!  The only other thing I served was sweet cornbread.  This recipe makes a lot of chili, so you may want to cut the recipe in half if you have a small family.  We decided to freeze some for later.  This would be a great vegan option for carry in dinners or vegan house guests.

I made a few changes taking out some of the spice since I do not like spicy food at all but the boyfriend does. We've so far pre-tried the sauce and it's delicious! I cannot wait to eat the full product I know it will be delicious - I love the meat crumbles too and did one fiesta style and one original of Beyond Meat. All organic fresh veggies too!

We love this chili, thank you for sharing! The first time I didn't have chili powder and used chickpeas instead of garbonzo beans. I used 3 large cans of diced tomatoes, only 1 tsp of salt and doubled the cumin. We still found it pretty spicy even without the chili powder, but still delicious. The second time I did the same  but used 1.5 T of chili powder, not 1/4 cup as called for, and no jalapeno. I also mashed the diced tomatoes a bit before adding them, and added 2 T of cocoa powder to the pot before simmering. Yum!! Still spicy for my daughter  so if you don't like spicy, you might want to cut back to one can of  canned chilies and/or 1 T. chili powder. Delicious flavours, thank you again!

I don't like chili peppers so I omitted those. I added mushrooms and vegetable broth with the onions and spices. I only used one can of tomatoes and I added some ketchup for some pizazz :)

Besides that I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out really well!

Next time I'll either use one jalapeño or drain the canned chilies as its right on the line of being too spices without cheese or sour cream. Otherwise it's excellent and impressed my meat eating friends.

I made a bunch of changes in this recipe. First of all, cut the salt from 1 tablespoon to 1 teaspoon, then taste and add if needed later. Omitted the bay leaves. Used ONE jalapeno and ONE 4 oz can of green chiles. Omitted the garbanzo beans and instead used 1 can each of pinto, kidney, and black beans. I think it would be way too spicy if done exactly as the recipe directs.

Love this chili, I make it several times a year. I love it in a baked potato but last night I had sweet potatoes laying around and decided to give it a try. I LOVE this chili over sweet potatoes, it's wonderful. This chili does get better over night. The only things I do differently: I add way more cumin and I only use 2 cans of tomatoes instead of 3. This already makes a huge pot of chili, so an extra 28oz of tomatoes just seems over kill to me.

Honestly...this would have been really delicious were it not so darned spicy!  It just didn't meet my expectations for flavor, because the spice overshadowed all of the other flavors - and there were a lot of really good and flavorful ingredients that could have shined through. I will make this again with maybe 1/4 the amount of chili powder and half of the salt, pepper, and cumin.

It was my first ever veggie chili. Being a meat eater, I really didn't know what to expect. I was blown away by how hearty it turned out to be! I upped my spices and herbs, and added mushrooms in the end to soak up how much access water there was caused by the tomatoes. Loved it! I have a delicious and healthy meal for a week.

Added seitan instead of the crumbles.  Consistency/texture was perfect and the flavor absorbed very well.  Nice little kick to it.

It was a good vegetable soup with an unusual flavor that i think mainly derives from the paprika--I used smoked paprika and not quite as much as the recipe calls for (although I tend to increase the other spices as i like stronger flavors generally).  You can use any and every vegetable...I added mushrooms, red pepper, cauliflower, etc...  As a vegetarian, this is a good recipe because it is just a little different than many vegetable soups that can all start to taste alike after awhile!

Very nice vegetarian chili - made an entire crock pot full.  Made a few changes (if not mentioned below, I did exactly as the recipe stated):  Oh, and drain and rinse ALL the beans, do not use that gross liquid in the can full of chemicals in your chili.  And drain your green chili's in the can as well.

1 whole onion,
1 teaspoon of himalayan salt,
5 stalks celery,
2 green bell peppers & 1 red bell pepper,
5 cloves garlic,
1 bag of vegetarian burger crumbles (Morning star),
1 cup carrots added (5 skinny long ones).

Anyways, ended up using more olive oil due to more vegetables, roughly 4-5 tablespoons.  Put all the ingredients in the pan on stove to sautee - everything except the beans and tomato products (which I already threw in the crock pot).  Then put the pan items into the crockpot with the tomato/beans, mix.  Put on high for 5 hours in crock pot.  Flavor was perfect, not too spicy, just very flavorful.  Will have a ton of leftovers!

Great recipe, I make it all the time.  Its great just the way it is.  I do make a couple of change to make it a little chunkier.  I buy a package of vegi-burgers and break them up into piece about 1/2 inch in size. I then  substitute them for one of the crumble packages.  I also substitute in one can of diced tomatos for one of the three cans of crushed tomatos.

Really delicious! I didn't add the jalapeños or green chilies and only added 3 tablespoons of chili powder because I was scared it was going to be too spicy and it came out absolutely incredible and still had a really good kick to it. Definitely adding to my list of favorites.

Made this tonight, didn't have green chillis so opted for a handful of thai red chillis instead. Also like others have mentioned, be sure to DRAIN AND RINSE YOUR BEANS. The extra water from the cans is unnecessary- also gross. Stewed for a few hours, most of the heat cooked off so don't be afraid to add spice.

I have made this recipe multiple times now, and I'm always so pleased! The flavor and consistency are absolutely perfect. It is a little bit spicy, but it is not overpowering. One time I decided to add pickled jalapeños which made it almost inedible because it was so hot, but if you follow the recipe as is then it is guaranteed to be delicious.

This chili is outstanding. I did opt for less "spice". I was afraid to put two whole jalapenos and 1/4 cup of chili powder so I cut the amounts down significantly. The flavor is great! This is not doubt the best chili recipe I have ever found.

Made it without the chili / jalapeno and it still had a kick. Serves 10-12 so I did end up freezing some for a latter date. Plan on using left overs to make some enchiladas. Suggest adding the salt at the end based on your preference as the beans if from a can have some already.

Fantastic chili! I used all organic ingredients and followed the recipe as described. Absolute best chili I've had! Easy to tweak to make a hotter or more mild batch. Everyone should give this chili a try, well worth it.

I really liked this recipe! I used Kidney Beans, White Kidney Beans, and Black Beans as well as a cup of chopped carrots instead of veggie crumbles. I cooked mine in the slow cooker after reading someone else review, which was pretty easy if you make this in the am and let it cook all day. Just be sure to add the corn at the end. I used frozen corn instead of canned. I also left out the jalepano peppers because the chili powder is plenty (and I didn't even use the full amount). I'm not sure if I have a smaller than normal crock pot or not but I could not fit all of the tomato into the pot. So I just fit what I could which ended up being two 12 oz cans of diced tomatoes, 1 12 oz can of crushed tomatoes. And then occasionally I added a crushed whole peeled tomatoes toward the end if it looked dry (which it probably won't). Also I recommend using a full onion because it's so good! : ). Serve with oyster crackers and tobasco sauce!

This is the first time I made chili from scratch. I am trying to abstain from meet for 3 weeks. Today is just day 4 and I've missed meat in every dish except this one because it is super flavorful. I added a teaspoon of paprika. Otherwise I followed the direction to a T and it turned out great! I will never use packaged chili seasoning again. Thanks!

Here are the modifications I made: one can of spicy green chilies and one can of mild green chilies (as opposed to both mild), used Morning Star Vegetarian Sausage patties instead of burger patties, and only used one jalapeño. 

I think if I made it again, I'd use two mild cans of green chilies, replace a can of tomatoes with veggie broth, and try it with some other veggie patties. The "sausage" wasn't bad, but something else might be better.

I want to try cooking this in my new slow cooker. It has a chili setting but should I cook up the veggies on the stove and then transfer it over to add the rest or just start and finish in the crock pot?

This was a very tasty chili. I brought it to my work and it was all gobbled up and received rave reviews.  I made a few changes based on preference, what I had, and others' suggestions.  I added quinoa (maybe 1/4 to 1/3 of a cup) and chopped carrots.  I used white kidney beans instead of red.  I used Amy's burgers crumbled up and only one tin of peppers and one jalapeno.  It was very mild.  If I were to make it again, I'd add in the other tin and jalapeno to get more spice.  That being said, others liked it the way it was (and it was good for my kids this way). A great cold weather dish!

Loved this!  It was nice and thick which made one forget that there's no meat.  I was attempting to clean out the cupboards so I made few substitutions.  I used "small white beans" from Goya instead of garbanzos, Pomi chopped tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes, frozen corn instead of canned, and 4 veggie burgers that have been in the freezer forever.  I ground them up in the mixer and it worked fine.  The only change I would make next time is the jalapenos. I used one instead of two this time and it was still too hot.  So I'll just eliminate the jalapenos next time.

We made a few changes based on the recommendations from others. My husband loves it spicy but my stomach is a bit sensitive so we compromised. We used 1 green pepper, 1 jalapeño pepper, reduced the salt and the chili powder by half. We used 1 package of Boca crumbles. We did use the entire onion. We rinsed and drained the beans. 
It was delicious! We took it to an oyster roast and everybody really enjoyed it. We will definitely make it again.

I put in half the spicy stuff,  and it was still too spicy for my crew.  Very tasty but spicy. We managed to eat it by crumbling our cornbread into it which helped. I will make it again but without the jalapeno and green chilies and 2 TBSP of chili powder.

My family and I love this chili. As soon as the weather turns, everyone is asking me for it. I've served it to my non-vegetarian friends and they were none the wiser, and loved it! 
I have made a few of my own little tweets to fit my taste. I love kidney beans so I add an additional can of them. I drain all cans of beans and always buy organic. I add an additional stalk of celery because I love the crunchy texture and different spice it adds. Finally, I add an additional can of corn because why not. 
This is truly the best  vegetarian chili!!!

Holy spicy! Added a little water to lessen the burn, but otherwise made it as directed. The title is correct, I believe this is the best in the world. Hope you like it hot!

Very flavorful with just the right amount of heat. Even my son, who doesn't particularly like chili of any kind, found this recipe to be very good. I did omit the burger crumbles, but added some shredded chicken breast, negating the 'vegetarian' title. This is definitely a keeper!

I made the Chili and couldn't stop eating it.  I told my husband how good it was and he told me he had eaten late that afternoon and probably wouldn't be able to finish it.  He did.  What a great recipe, thanks for sharing :D

I love this recipe.  I like to add matchstick carrots, chicken bouillon (I'm not vegetarian) and hominy, as well as changing out the beans.  For those who find it too hot, serve over rice.  It's a really hearty chili.

Great vegetarian chili! I like this receipt because you can modify it and add or subtract vegetables. Instead of 3 28oz cans of whole tomatoes, I added differently types of can tomatoes like, fire roasted garlic tomatoes and garlic and oregano tomatoes. I did only add one can of green chilies and left out a table spoon of chili powder because my wife doesn't like hot and spicy food (I do.. Lol) But all in all great recipe, thank you!

Tastes and smells wonderful.  Makes very large pot, about 20 cup size servings.  My wife cut the japoleno and her hands were on fire for 2 days.  I would use rubber gloves to cut the japolenos, garlic,  and onions.

This is a good recipe.  While I love spicy food, 2 jalapenos (with seeds) was a bit too much heat.  Added cooked, cubed sweet potato and some tomato sauce to reduce the heat.  I also only used one pack of crumbles.

added a lot less salt and tvp soaked in veggie broth. drained and rinsed the beans added extra veggie broth to make up liquid. The spicy-ness is on the level I expect from a chili nice and HOT.  Very good I will be making this again!

More like vegetable soup. I used 1 Tbl.  chili powder and it was perfect.  Also, I drained the beans (cause lots of sodium in the liquid), omitted the jalapenos and used two cans of corn.  Im loving this recipe and will make again skipping the fake meat all together.

It REALLY IS the best vegetarian chili ever made. I prefer this recipe over REGULAR chili! I can eat this every day, no problem! It's just perfect. Sometimes I cut out a jalapeño, or add fresh okra. As long as you keep the seasoning consistent, tomatoes, and beans you'll be very pleased with the end result. Wish I had some of this right now!!

Unless you're a hardcore lover of spicy food, a quarter cup of chili powder is WAY too much!  But if you make the rest of the recipe first and then just add enough chili powder at the end to get the heat you want, it's delicious!

I just made this for a dinner for international students.  I followed the recipe exactly and it is absolutely delicious!   I'll be making chili with meat also with my own recipe which is very good.  I have a feeling the vegetarian chili is going to be the star of the show though.  Really excellent recipe.

This recipe was awesome!  My cousin tried it and ended up eating 3 bowls and taking another home.  I didn't use the jalapeños because I am the only one who likes spicy things in my house, but I also could have just not added the seeds.  I also only used one bag of the fake round beef crumbles and instead added some zucchini, yellow squash and fresh tomatoes that needed to be used.  It is super delicious and for anyone that doesn't like the crumbles, I would suggest just add more veggies :)

This is my favorite chili!  My husband loves it and asks for it frequently.  I get so many compliments and almost everyone asks for the recipe.  I do cut back on the jalapeño by adding just one since we don't like it quite as hot.  I've also substituted a red bell pepper for one of the peppers to add color.  Great flavors!!

This was so delicious, a big success !  I  added more cumin as I like a stronger flavor.
I left out the jalapeño peppers as I am not a fan of hot !  It does make a huge amount, but I boxed it and it kept wonderfully in the fridge, you could also freeze it , I found  the flavor improved with age.
Definitely added to my favorite recipes, this would be fantastic now that fall is finally on it's way.

First time to have vegetarian burger crumbles and I couldn't tell the difference. This chilli is packed with flavors. I only used 1-12 ounce package of the burger crumbles, so I used 1 less can of crushed tomatoes.  Had a baked potatoe today filled with this chilli and it was awesome!  I can't wait to serve it tonight for dinner topped with chopped avocado and cheese.   Thanks for a great recipe.

I love this recipe but my family does not like spicy food so I leave out the jalapeño peppers and the chili peppers and we love it!

I was kind of disappointed with this recipe, especially given the reviews.  I made it for 10 people, used less tomato than it suggested and added an extra can of beans, and found that it was way too tomato-y.  It definitely overpowered other flavors that you would look for in: the oregano, the bay leaf, the green chili. It honestly kind of tasted like a semi-spicy ketchup.  

If I were to do it again, I'd definitely add less tomato, put in some lime, and potentially some other veggies (zuke, yam, etc).

My favorite chili recipe!  Great for gatherings... I start with two pots, split the ingredients in half, and make one vegetarian batch and one with ground beef.  Fritos on the bottom, cheddar and sour cream on top and it is perfect.  Everyone is happy.

The ingredient list isn't clear and doesn't state how many crushed tomato to whole peeled tomato ratio. It just names both kinds and doesn't go beyond. This worked out to be more like a sauce than a chili and there are by far more superior recipes out there. 

At best, I was able to use this as a sauce over brown rice. It mellowed out the heat and gave it a less "sauce" feel. My suggestion, use two (28 oz) cans of whole tomatoes and 1 (20 oz) can of crushed and you'll have more of a chili. Rather than canned chilies, used the one's in adobo. It will give it a more controlled heat and you can a better depth of flavor.

We have made this several times and loved it.  This is a great meal to take to a friend. If you like it really spicy, make it as is. We have children who don't like it too spicy, so we cut the chili powder down to just less than 1/8 cup, omitted the jalapenos, reduced black pepper to just less than 1 T, and got "mild" canned green chiles.  For meat eaters, you will also LOVE this.  Just brown a package (usually 20 oz) of ground turkey and then proceed with the rest of the recipe. This chili is pretty thick, so you can add veggie broth or chicken broth if you want to thin it it a bit (we drain and rinse our beans to avoid added sodium, so I guess if you don't do that it's not as thick).

Very very good!  Made as directed but only used half of the meatless crumbles (package said sodium was 14% of daily value in 1 serving and there were 4 servings in the package I bought - Boca brand). I didn't salt at all to start with in case it was the crumbles that were causing the over saltiness that some people described, but it was VERY bland without.  I ended up adding 1Tbsp salt.  As far as the 'heat' goes, the chili powder is probably NOT to blame unless the pkg denotes it is hot or spicy.  Typical red chili powder is not hot at all.  Canned green chiles should not be to blame either - here in Arizona, our little 4 ouncers always say 'mild' which makes me laugh because I've never even SEEN medium or hot (and I've looked).  So the 'heat' wildcard is the jalapeño - it's really hard to tell if you've got a hot one or not.  Keeping seeds in will make a difference and size varies greatly.  Ive seen them 1" to 3" long and depending on the crop/weather conditions makes a big difference in heat.  I'm wondering if the folks who got blazed by the heat just got REALLY hot jalapeños or maybe used red pepper instead of red chili?   Adding sour cream will cool it off some if needed, but mine came out perfect!  Excellent recipe - never used bay leaf before and it seemed like a lot of oregano as i was putting it in but turned out great!  Only obstacle was 'crushing' the whole tomatoes myself.  I'll buy crushed next time!

This is a wonderful, easy recipe.  I love beans, so I added an extra can of garbanzo beans and an extra can of black beans.  Also I used chipotle chili which smells fabulous.  And just one jalapeño (I have small-ish kids to feed).  I'll serve it tonight with my all time favorite cornbread (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/grandmothers-buttermilk-cornbread/).

BUT I used a product called Litelife Smart Ground (vege protein crumbles) which is nasty!!  I've added extra tomato paste and some worcester sauce to help disguise the taste.  Not too bad, but next time I'll use something different!!  Maybe turkey...

I LOVE this recipe & share it often, I have a pot simmering on the stove right now. First time a friend made this for us my vegetarian daughter was convinced there was meat in it. Im not big on meatless crumbles but I use Boca GMO free crumbles in this recipe, they absorb all the spices & deliciousness, meat eaters will have no idea its not meat!

Excellent chili! I made it in the slow cooker. I prepared everything the night before and refrigerated it overnight. I turned it on in the morning and let it go on low for 8 hours. Other than that, I followed the recipe. My roommate made the Camp Corn Bread (from this site) to go with it.

Good recipe - made for a hearty chili, perfect for a winter night. I am not a fan of celery, so used carrots instead. I served it sprinkled with chopped green onions, which was great.

The only thing I would say is that the recipe calls for too much spice. The combination of jalapenos + chili peppers + chili powder + black pepper was a little too hot, at least for me. So, I adjusted it accordingly. That's the only thing I would change in the recipe - use chili powder to taste.

Since finding this recipe in December, I've made it three times. I find the quantities outlined here is way too much so I always half some of the items, including the jalapenos. Too spicy.  Overall, my family loves it and I've got one son who doesn't eat meat and another that doesn't really prefer veggies and somehow this works. Finally!

I have made this chili at least a dozen times for various functions.  It has always been a major hit.  And many an unsuspecting person has eaten it never knowing it was meatless.  I do believe chili is intended to be spicy so I find the ingredients to be perfect.  The only change I make is to drain and rinse all the beans and add vegetable stock.  As others have mentioned it makes a lot of food which has been a good thing because my guests have never turned down take home portions.  Thank you for sharing a definite keeper.

Very yummy.  I did only put one jalapeño pepper in after reading reviews.  First time I ever used the vegetarian crumbles, I could not tell they were not meat.  Definitely worth making.

Even my non vegetarian male buddies liked this :)  I added a can 2 cups of diced butternut squash to the onion and celery mix at the beginning.  The orange from the squash was a nice pop of color.

We made this chili with and without the "crumbles".  Hands down we preferred it without the crumbles.  Delicious chili... highly recommended.  We did spice it up a little more with some jalapeno peppers.

yum this was so so so good!!! we love chili and i recently became a vegetarian and have been looking for a great recipe. i used zero meat and no meat substitutes, we had all veggies so i added a zucchini, a red bell pepper, an extra can of kidney beans and used only one jalapeno pepper. it was not too spicey at all, in fact i wish i had added more spice to it!!! the heat kind of increased as i ate more. loved it.

I have made this probably about half a dozen times, it is amazing!  I love the heat and I also love that this recipe makes so much chili!  Plenty for my own family and enough to give away to bless other people as well!  It makes a lot so if you have a small family be prepared to freeze some or give some away!

Loved this recipe!! This fed a family of 6 (including 3 teenage boys) with leftovers to spare. All agreed they wanted me to make it again regularly. It was pulled out again later to make chili dogs. Still have plenty for another meal.  I only used 2 table spoons of the chili powder and 1/2 4 oz can of jalapinos. Heat tolerance varies widely in my house so this change made it mild enough for all tastes. I put on the table additional chopped jalapinos, chipotle powder and sriracha so everyone could customize their dish. I'll make this every couple weeks all winter....home run!

I didn't put the TVP in, and I only put one jalapeno in.  It tasted like a tomato stew.  I tried it cold, and it's like a good bean salsa.  Regardless, it's was worth trying.  Thank you for the recipe, it is difficult to find a vegan chili.

I made this chili twice.  The first time I followed instructions as written except I only used one can of chili peppers.  The result was almost inedible due to how spicy it was.  I assume there must be a lot of variation in the spice level of different chili powders and canned products.  The second time I omitted the canned chili peppers altogether, and reduced the chili powder to approximately 2-3 tbsp.  It was perfectly spicy and delicious.

I can't believe how much this tastes like beef chili! Last month I made a turkey chili since my husband and have been trying to cut back on beef and we thought it was a good subsitute but this recipe is much better. The only thing I changed was I replaced the garbanzo beans with pinto beans and it was great. Thanks!

I followed the recipe and the result was awesome! I included the jalapeno's seeds which made the chili very spicy. I recommend to exclude them (or halve it) if you are not sure whether your guests are ok with very spicy food or not. Also I was able to make the whole thing in a 6-quart pot (I don't think any pot smaller than that would work).

This recipe is delicious and the colors are beautiful. Thank you for sharing! I used 2 packets "soy chorizo" instead of burger crumbles. Also, for large groups I use HALF the amount of jalepeno, green chiles, and chili powder.

I make this every month for a lot of leftovers and I dice the veggies to add more to the flavor. It usually makes about 10 servings for me instead of 8.

This recipe was great. I followed most of it to the T, my father doesnt like spicy things so I only added one jalapeño and watched how much chili powder I put in it. If I were to make it myself I would put in the recommended 1/4 cup of chili powder because I love spicy food. Thanks for the great and healthy recipe!

This is an excellent vegetarian chili recipe. I've been making this for years and it's always a hit. For all the donkeys complaining this chili is too spicy.... seriously??  Its chili!!  Make some cream of something if you don't want spicy. I swear some people aren't happy unless they're complaining. Chili? Spicy? Who would have thought.

I was looking for a vegan chili and this was great. When I make it again, I'll leave out the veggie burgers, because I think it gives it a soy meat like taste, which I'm not a fan. I think the straight veggies taste good enough. I also added a cashew based queso on top of corn chips and it was yummy!

Loved this recipe, I have been missing a good chili since we turned vegetarian!  I used two packages of vegetarian ground round instead of breaking up burgers and added the last few minutes before serving (as package recommends), nobody could tell it was even vegetarian!

Delicious and filling.  Made a few changes: halved the black pepper, jalapeno pepper, canned chilis, and chili powder(still nicely spicy); used two large cans crushed tomatoes and 1 large can petite diced tomatoes; used 1 package veggie crumbles instead of 2, and used frozen corn.  Makes a huge portion; this could easily serve 8-10 people. Next time will try with diced zucchini also as others have suggested.

This chili is delicious!  I omitted the corn and added some carrots, broccoli stems, and zucchini.  I think the spiciness others are mentioning depends on the jalapeno itself, as peppers are hotter in August and the fall, and milder the rest of the year. So use your judgment as to how much jalapeno to add, you can always add more later! This is a yummy and healthy recipe, everyone really loved it. Thanks!

I have made this recipe many times.  Each time it has been a HUGE hit.  My favorite occasion was when I made a double batch for a post-triathlon party.  Prior to the party, folks were skeptical due to the "vegetarian" moniker.  Once the party started, it was the first food item to go.  I eat meat, but prefer this recipe over all others.  If you do want meat, I've made it with ground turkey breast as well.

I made this and took it to work and everyone loved it.  I substituted fresh Chilies for canned fresh Hatch green chili powder for a bottle from the store and imitation steak chunks for ground beef chunks.  It is fabulous!
Except the guys told me I had to bring ice cream along with it if I ever bring it again.  Great flavor not just a fire hot dish.

I've made this chili several times and last time decided to skip the vegetarian crumbles, jalpenos, and corn. Instead, I added more 3 more cans of beans for more protien, an extra cup of diced celery and a tiny bit more cumin. I also used almost all organic ingredients and let them stew overnight on low heat in a crock pot to make sure it was still flavorful. I definitely like this chili even more now - it tastes heartier and it's totally vegan without the vegetarian crumbles :)

This is my most used recipe on this site.  It is amazing!  Every time I make it for someone they say it's the best chili they've ever had, and most of them are not vegetarians. 

A few notes:
 - Follow the directions and use whole tomatoes you crush yourself.  Using crushed tomatoes doesn't allow for enough liquid.
 - If you like your chili spicy, use 3 jalapenos and McCormick Hot Mexican Style Chili Powder.  It's worth it to go find it if it's not in your usual grocery store.
 - Serve with fresh grated cheddar cheese and sour cream.  Obviously this strays from the healthy vegetarian goal, but boy is it delicious!

My new favorite chili recipe!  So good!  One change I made was that I only put in 1.5 jalapenos instead of 2.  Probably didn't make much of a difference, but my family was getting scared that it might be too spicy.  It was not too spicy.  I'm not real big on spicy foods, but I thought this was just right.

I really like this recipe! However, like everyone else I had to make some modifications. I took away the celery and bell pepper.. not a big fan of those two in my chili. I also simmered it for a lot longer (about 2 hours)because after 45 minutes it still looked like soup. I changed was the amount of chili powder the recipe calls for since 1/4 cup seemed like WAY too much for my taste. I also added a little bit adobo sauce to make it a little smokey since I felt the tomato was made the chili a tad sweet. Worked out great! My boyfriend and I are going to be eating this for lunch and dinner the rest of this week!

Love! We loved this chili! We didn't miss the meat and the finished chili was thick, hearty, incredibly flavorful and just the right kind of spicy thanks to all that flavor. I will be using this recipe and wowing the family again and again. Deliciously filling!

Very good. Modified based in what I had. Cooked chopped onion (1/2 of a large white onion) in the olive oil in a skillet until soft then added a large red pepper, celery, and garlic, about 4 gloves. Put all in slow cooker and added 1 can of each- black beans, garbanzo, pinto, and red kidney. Added 1 28 oz can diced tomatoes.cooked on low for about 3 hrs then added 1 can crn and kept on low for about 2 more hrs For spices I used 1/4 cup chili powder as called for, oregano as called for, salt and pepper to taste and about 2 tsp cumin. I did not have the chile peppers or jalapeño peppers that the recipe called for or the veg burger crumbles but I thought it was really good   with the ingredients I used. Lots of flavor!!

This is amazing. I have made it several times over the last two years and I do not change any of the spices or content. Actually, I cut the recipe in half and (from 8 to 4 servings) and still use the whole can of the beans and corn. It makes way more than the four servings even cut in half like that. It freezes well, too. 

A great addition is making some cornbread with this. I make cornbread waffles in the waffle maker. With butter and honey and this amazing chili it is a great winter weather comfort food. Also, I made mini cornbread muffins with a bit of jalepeno in them. Rave reviews.

This recipe is super easy to make, healthy and suprisingly tasty. My meat- and potato-eating relatives tried this stew and asked me for the recipe! It's that good. I only use one package of veggie crumbles, 1 bell pepper, skip the jalepenos and use less chili powder for a more mild chili.

this is awesome!!!!  My husband asked me to add some ground turkey (cooked of course) and I did...so if you want to add some protein, this doesn't change it much.  It is really tasty!  I used some chipolte pepper for seasong...so good!

This is indeed the best vegetarian chili ever. I used to buy tons of cans of Trader Joe's chili (best canned veggie chili out there in my opinion), but this beats eating that by 10 fold. It took some time to make sure I had all the ingredients, but it's super simple once you get everything together. This recipe makes a pretty huge batch, but it freezes/reheats really well! Got tons of compliments and people asking for the recipe. Wouldn't change anything about it!

We are trying to eat more vegetarian and this recipe is exactly what we were looking for. I skipped the meat substitute, and the chile peppers and jalapenos (just served on the side). We used frozen corn. Instead of chili powder and canned tomatoes I just used the canned tomatoes with chili seasoning already in them. It turned out perfectly mild but with plenty of flavor. We have a 3 year old and so this is exactly what I was hoping for. Adults added the heat they wanted. We served with sour cream, cheddar cheese, and avocado. My father in law went back for seconds! The next day, when I told him it was vegetarian, he was surprised and impressed. Thank you, this is a perfect family recipe that we will return to time and time again.

Okay, here it is....This is the BEST vegan chili out there!!! I have tried sooooo many vegan chili recipes and this trumps the ALL. My mother ( she eats meat) still loved this chili more than chili with meat. She pleaded for this recipe, and I shared it. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe and proving that vegan food can be amazing.

I followed the recipe to the T except I put it all in a 7qt stockpot after step 1 (it barely fit!) for a few hours on low. The result was great. My vegetarian sister in law and the rest of the family (non-vegetarian) loved it. My husband said he couldn't tell it wasn't meat and the spice level was perfect. Those who wanted it spicier just added habanero sauce and jalapenos. (Oh yeah, I had omitted the jalapenos from the recipe when cooking it along with the bay leaves since I was out). I am taking off one star not because the recipe isn't great but only because even tho I liked it, the "meat" crumbles tasted like plastic to me and I didn't want more than one serving. Still, great recipe, thanks!!

I've made this recipe about 6 times now, no kidding. It's the best vegetarian chili recipe I've found, and it's so easy. I've only made it with the veggie crumbles once, but decided not to use them again - I just think they're too expensive and they don't add much to the flavor of the chili. No one in my family are actual vegetarians (my husband is one of those "meat and potatoes" guys), but we love this chili. Someone gave this a low rating because it was too spicy - I have to admit, I add an EXTRA jalapeno and a little extra cumin and chili powder every single time I make it. Obviously, my husband and I like the heat - but I think this recipe, in it's original form, would only be too spicy for the most tender-tounged people.

Yummm!  The 8 serving recipe makes a lot!  Enough for 12 possibly?  I left out the jalapenos and used less chili powder.  It still had a nice kick to it.

I cooked this for my wife who been vegetarian 20 years and she said best chili ever!  I used red peppers instead of green and only on can of chilis.   Was magnificent!

Fantastic! I used bulgur wheat instead of veggie meat crumbles just because I prefer the texture. Love it with brown rice.

Really is the best chili.  We've made it many times and have found that the Smart brand meat crumbles provide the best consistency.  Other brands were always too chewy and lumpy.

Made this today and it was awesome! I used one package of veggie crumbles and didn't have a second, so I threw in a package of Quorn Chick'n Tenders instead and it was fabulous. This chili has so much flavor that you don't have to dress it up with any toppings like cheese, sour cream, or cilantro. And the carnivores in your life won't find anything missing. Great recipe! I'll use this one again and again...

This veggie chili lived up to its name.  The whole party was raving!  I stuck to the original recipe and had zero issues.  A couple guests (let's call them babies) whined a bit about the spiciness.  We had a 100% satisfaction rate though (once we kicked those whiners out).  My one secret is on the 28 oz cans of whole peeled potatoes.  In order to "crush" them, just drain the liquid and then using the lid of the can press down hard.  Have fun!

My husband and I loved this chili. I forgot to add a 2nd pack of veggie burger crumbles, but the flavor was still delicious! I also substituted white beans for kidney beans, and left out the corn. It was so yummy and we have plenty left over for colder days.

Very good recipe.  Could not find green chilis, I left them out, and used less chili powder.  Was very tasty.  Loved all the beans in it.  Will definitely make this again

WAY too much chili powder! It was tasting good until I added that, but now the whole thing just tastes like chili powder. I would also add some more tomatoes and more onion. I'd use less salt, too.

Made this yesterday and found it to be very tasty and filling. Not as hot as some reviewers have mentioned but it is spicy, which I like. Added some hot sauce to the two bowls I ate last night. Just reheated and ate two more bowls for lunch. Even better the next day! Looking forward to making it again. My hat is off to the creator of this recipe.

We used all New Mexican chile products: Hatch green chile, jalapeno from the farmers' market, and Chimayo red chile. Very hot, but very popular with our non-veg friends.

The name of this recipe left me a bit skeptical.  Best in the world?  It was my first time using a vegetarian "meat" product (veggie ground round) - it was delicious and simple to prepare.  Freezes well too.  I gave some to my mother and she also loved it.  The only changes I made were subbing one red pepper for a green one; using white kidney beans instead of the traditional red ones; and I forgot to add the corn.

Quick and easy as well as tasty and nutritious.  I like to use bulgur wheat instead of the meat substitute.  Adds texture and fiber.

Who needs meat when you've got an awesome veggie chili like this! No need for using the veggie burger crumbles, it's great w/o it. I also added a hot hot pepper (seeds and all). Came out super hot. To combat the heat, I added about 3/4 cup brown sugar. It's still hot, but the sweetness makes it bearable. I ate a whole bowl yesterday! For me, that heat is a lot! Next time I'll ease up on the hot peppers and maybe a little less pepper.

We LOVE this vegetarian chili!  I do add only one jalapeno pepper due to the spiciness of this dish.  I also hate bell peppers and never add them and the chili is still delic!  This is definitely a family favorite and a nice substitute for a meatless meal.

This recipe is amazing, so much so that we are making a double batch today. A few modifications to suit our likes are - no canned chili's (they are slimey) we add an extra jalapeno, no vegetarian crumbles (don't like them) and one extra can of corn (we love corn). It gets better and better days after being made. We serve with corn chips and a dallop of sour cream. Mmmmm.........

The flavor of this chili was actually the best I have ever had, with the except of the heat! I only put 1 can of the green chiles in because we don't like spice. I read some reviews saying it was too salty, on the contrary, the salt was perfect for all those tomatoes. And the chili powder I buy is just plain ol' store chili powder, it's extremely mild, and that flavor was awesome. I think it was the jalapeno that threw it off. Next time, 1 jalapeno, 1 can of chiles like I did and it'd be fantastic!

This is THE BEST vegetarian chili in the world, for sure!  I love spicy stuff so I always add a splash of Tabasco to my individual bowl (so I don't kill everyone else).  I double the black beans and kidney beans and omit the veggie crumbles (cause it's not my thing) and this is quite simply the best bean chili I've ever tasted. :)  I half the recipe all the time for myself and I eat it until it's gone!

Excellent! The best chili I have ever made.  I did not add corn, but that's just my preference.

Great chili!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fantastic.  However, because we have to watch our sodium intake in our house I bought organic tomatoes and beans which contain far less salt then these items that you would purchase from your local supermarket.  It's a bit more expensive but it's worth it because it's so much healthier for you.  I have made 4 batches so far and what my husband and I don't use I freeze.

this was the best chili i have ever had. It was easy and quick to make nut i did make some changes. I used gteat northern beans, pinto beans, and kindey beans instead. And i added 2 tablespoons of garlic powder. I also used cream corn instead of whole. Other than that the recipe was delicious. Ive made it 3 times.

I love this recipe - as do our 'meat eating' friends. I did change it a little - I add 2 cans of black beans, 1 can of chick peas and no kidney beans (and I rinse the beans WELL). I rarely remember to put in the corn. I omit the salt and add  red bell pepper, mushroom and a zucchini instead of the green pepper and celery (just can't make myself eat celery). I also use the Quorn burger crumbles. This always turns out fantastic!

This is the second time i have made this!    I really enjoyed it and so did most of the people at home.  I didn't add ground round... And i only added one Jalpeno... and i didn't add all of the chili powder that it asked for... I added one can of diced tomatoes and the rest wholt tomatoes..maybe a can of tomatoe paste next time!     I did find i could use a bit more flavour... So i did add more salt... and rinsing off the beans was a good idea... i have alot let over but yes it does freeze really well!     I will be making this again and again! great thing for lunches! very healthy!

This chili was fabulous!!  I only modified it slightly-I took other user recommendations and only added one bag of the veggie burger crumbles and used frozen corn instead of canned.  I also added 3 diced carrots and replaced the garbanzo beans with cannelini beans.  I could bring this dish to a party nobody would know it's vegetarian!!

I like a thick meat chili so I used this as a base and added ground sirloin and sirloin chunks. I also used the canned crushed tomatoes with jalapenos. Yummy!

This was very yummy and filling.  My family doesn't like a whole lot of 'heat', so I only used 1 jalapeno pepper, omitted the green chile peppers and only used a fraction of the chili pepper.  For the tomatoes, I used 2 cans of whole peeled tomatoes, not crushed and 1 can of diced tomatoes. I also didn't use the full amount of 'burger' crumbles, probably half.  As a result, the chili was a little bit runny, but still very good! It made a HUGE batch of chili, way more than what my family could eat in one meal.  It does freeze well, so there are plenty of leftovers for another time. I will definitely make this again!

I cut this in half because I only cook for two people. Also, I left out the chili peppers and the japanpeno. Because neither of us like spicy foods. ...And it was still a little too spicy for us. . Almost unbearable (maybe the "zesty diced tomatoes" I used?)So i added sugar to bring it down a little bit, it helped but still a little spicy, so I put a bunch of cheese on top of it and its great.  I'm not sure if I'll make again, though. I loved the taste but it's way to spicy. If I can find a way to have it less spicy without drowning it in cheese (even though its really good with cheese) then I will make it again.

This is my go to veggie chili recipe. The first time I made it, I bought all organic ingredients and it came out fabulous, no tweaking needed, other than cayenne for extra spiciness. The second time I made it, I got cheap and bought cans of safeway stewed tomatoes and noticed the sauce came out super sour and acidic. I tried to adjust the flavor with some brown sugar and honey, which still wasn't cutting the acid enough. I threw in some dried basil and TONS of siracha, and the heat finally seemed to cut the sour taste. I was so relieved it was salvageable. Took the pot to a superbowl party and even some self proclaimed chili snobs declared it was one of the best chili they've tasted, some even said the best vegetarian chili by far. They even asked for the recipe, which I happily said was just off allrecipes. Love this chili!

I made this chili along with a pot of regular chili for a large family gathering.  The vegetarian one disappeared in no time at all.  I didn't tell anyone that the second one was meat free and no one guessed.  It was absolutely delicious.  This is my new favorite recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing.

Delicious! I made this chili for a few friends, all with different tastes and everyone loved it. The first time I made it I omitted the onions for a picky eater who hates them but otherwise did everything the same. The next time I followed the recipe except for swapping the veggie crumbles for ground turkey meat (as I am not a vegetarian myself, just a fan of healthy food). Both time were a hit (for me and everyone who tried it!). This is my new go-to chili recipe.  NOTE: I doubt it makes any difference at all, but I used all dry beans bought in bulk and just cooked them all up first, no canned beans.

This was a really good recipe.  I followed the directions almost exactly and all my friends loved it.  I used diced tomatos instead of crushed because that's what I had.  It's hearty and flavorful.

Love this!  Even my picky daughter ate it.  I cut some Boca burgers into small cubes (about 1/2 inch or less) and I used pinto beans instead of garbanzo beans.  I also took out the jalapenos.  Otherwise, this is a great chili!  I didn't miss the meat and neither did my carnivore husband  :)

i followed all of the comments about a few of the substitutions and then served it to a lot of meat-eaters.... They all LOVED it! It ended up probably a little spicier than I should have done so, but it was amazing that day and excellent as leftovers too!  I completely and whole-heartedly recommend!

I took other suggestions and only added 1 bag of veggie crumbles (because they are sooo expensive). Cut the salt in half too. I added more heat by added some chipotles in adobe sauce. This is delicious and I've had it 4 times since I've made this 3 days ago. Such a lovely recipe....soooooo yummy!

amazing... I've tried tons of veggie chili recipes and this is by far the best.  Super hearty and best paired with corn muffins for an extremely satisfying meal.  I added more chili powder in the beginning and used more ro-tel style diced tomatoes and green chiles instead of one of the cans of the crushed tomatoes.

Had this at a company potluck and it was fantastic!  I rarely taste chili than I like as well or better than my own, but this is it!  The veggie burger crumbles are a great fake out, and you really cannot tell the difference.  Very nice spice and flavor, can't wait to make it at home.

I used more onion. only black beans, but w/ jalapenos already added. instead of adding chili powder and salt, I added a packet of McCormick mild chili seasoning and red pepper flakes to taste. Delicious!

This really is the best vegy chili in the world.  Used this recipe for a chili cook-off and won third place!  I added two Serrano peppers for a little more heat and used 3 Tb of jarred minced garlic.  Definitely a "keeper".

I have to agree with the name of this recipe - it is the BEST.  I used a pre-cut, chili ready mix of red/yellow peppers, onions & jalapeno and just sauteed everything together.  I did not use garbonzo beans but used 2 cans of kidney beans. I put it all in the crock pot, added 1 zucchini about 2 hours before dinner and a 15 oz bag of frozen corn 1 hour before.  Not everyone in the group was vegitarian so I browned a pound of hamburger and mixed it with a can of chili beans for those who wanted meat.  I WILL make this again since winter in Minnesota is just starting :-).

We loved this recipe. I did alter a few things, since my four year old and one year old were going to eat it. I put no jalapenos in it. It was still flavorful. And I agree with a lot of the other review it makes a lot. Thanks for the recipe. My four year old loved it and plans on eating it every week.

This recipe is amazing! Even the meat eaters in my household devoured this. Does make a TON of chili, it's probably closer tom around 12 servings but it freezes great. I followed it exactly except substituted diced gardenburger griller veggie patties for the crumbles because my grocery was out. Next time I will definitely use the crumbles because the texture is much closer to ground beef.

This is a GREAT recipe - I have made it several times and it is always delicious. I do, though, substitute the "vegetarian burger crumbles" with TVP (textured vegetable protein) I like the texture and the taste much better than the soy! Enjoy!

You are right!  This is absolutely delicious, in fact, probably the best chili I've ever had.  Either tell, or don't tell, that it's vegetarian.

I made this recipe exactly as it states, and it was great! The next time, I did modify it a bit:  I didn't use jalapenos, used 1/2 the amount of veggie crumbles and an extra can of beans.  Either way it was fabulous, but many people cannot stand the extra heat!

This is a terrific recipe that can fool most taste buds.  I rated it a 5 because the overall recipe has so much depth and flavor. I add multiple peppers and simmer for much longer.  This is not my favorite chili style, however so not one I frequently make.

This recipe is excellent.  My gf and I are not huge fans of garbanzo beans, so we substituted an extra 1/2 can of corn and then instead of using a third can of crushed tomatoes used a can of diced tomatoes to make it a little chunkier.  I like a little spice, so we used 1/2 hot chili powder and 1/2 mild chili powder, and then followed the rest of directions from original poster.   Absolutely incredible!  It is also great reheated if you are going to be busy and want to make extra for the week to heat up later.  Thanks to the original poster.  Great recipe!

I love this recipe!  I alter it a little bit each time -- I never put in the veggie crumbles but always put in some chopped swiss chard at the end (when it says to add the corn).  If I have them, I use fresh peeled tomatoes and whatever else is fresh in the garden.  Its always a big hit!

I made this for lunch yesterday, and it was SO good. The only things we did differently was draining AND rinsing the beans, and instead of using 3 cans of crushed tomatoes, we used two cans of crushed tomatoes, and one can(same size) of diced tomatoes. This chili IS really spicy, but it is still really good. Next time we will probably only use one jalapeno.  To make this pot less spicy, we just added another can of tomatoes once there was enough room in the pot! I ate two bowls for lunch and then another bowl for dinner! Yummmm!!!

I just made this x5 for a large group. Not being a cooked garbanzo bean fan, I used dark and light kidney beans and black beans. I also used only 3 jalapenos (instead of the 5 it called for for that quantity) because there are a lot of kids in the group. I love it!

I have 2 vegetarian teens and one vegan teen.  My husband and I eat meat.  I made this yesterday and it please everyone! Yahoo! I used one can of crushed  tomatoes, one can diced and one can whole.  It makes a nice variety in size of the pieces. I also cut back on the hot hot spice to half.  This will become a regular dish in our kitchen!

ok, I have to admit, I've been claiming this recipe as my own, and I feel awful. About once a month, my son asks me,"mom, can you please make some of 'your' chili?" and I aim to please. This is definitely the best chili I've ever eaten and I'm not even a vegetarian! I put mushrooms into the mix after cooking all the other veggies. It gives it a meatier texture and it is fabulous! Thank you calead910....thank you!!

This was amazing! I made this for my family and everyone enjoyed, a lot! I didn't add the jalapenos but everyone was satisfied with the spice of the chili powder! Great recipe!

Just made this chili today. I followed the recipe almost completely except I only used one jalapeno and drained every can except the tomatoes. I loved it so much that i made an extra batch to freeze. Great recipe!

Absolutely amazing!  I would not change a thing about it, but if you're not into spicy, scale down the spice some.  I love all the veggies, but am not vegetarian so I add ground turkey to the mix.  Such a wonderful and hearty chili that's really good for you!

Wow this chili is good.    I followed the recipe exactly, except I used some frozen New Mexican green chile(buenofoods.com) rather than canned.  I added it in after 20 minutes of the simmering time as to not distroy the texture.  I didn't know veggie chili could taste so good.

A GREAT addition to our usual meaty Super Bowl!  Everyone loved it, and guests asked for the recipe!  It's a pretty HOT recipe, so you may prefer to tone it down.  But it's awesome as is if you don't mind a little heat!!!  Enjoy!

Delicious as is, a bit spicy, so if you dont like spicy, I do, reduce the hotter spices. It serves great with the sunny cornbread muffins from this site, my only note, dont buy crushed tomatoes. I always find they have a different taste, but either whole canned tomatoes, or diced canned tomatoes and throw them in cuisinart to resemble crushed tomatoes

When done right, this chili evokes a bright, balanced, savory set of flavors; the peppers do make their presence known (if you don't like that, you just don't like peppers), and, with that classic chili texture and all the warm smells from the cumin, even the most rabid of meat-eaters don't miss a thing.  I've made this for my wife and I, for six of my friends on a fishing trip, and for more than a dozen people at a party, and, more than anything else I cook, it is universally loved.  I like to add mushrooms, if they're around, and sometimes I throw the whole vegetarian thing out the window and toss in a few pounds of ground turkey.

this is a excellent mild chili, I used it for our annual fund raiser for our Lions Club and all 12 quarts went fast.I added low sodium v8 juice to add nutrients and used a frozen mix of onion,celery and green pepper which sure saved time.  I also used frozen corn. If it sits for awhile in a roaster etc it really thickens up so the v8 juice worked well to keep it from being too thick.

For a recipe containing the veggie burger crumbles, this is one of the best!  I like it a bit more tomato-y so I added a large can of tomato juice in the beginning.  I also added a red pepper to it, and used frozen petite white corn instead of canned.  This is fantastic with cheese and sour cream, and cornbread muffins go great with it too!  YUMMY!

fantastic recipe. for those of you who can't handle the spice -- cut the jalapenos, reduce the black pepper, and/or add some rice to the mix. my wife and I added rice and didn't do jalapenos and that kept it just where we like it -- spicy but not sweat-inducing.

We made this for the Super Bowl on Sunday and it was fantastic!  Really, really flavorful and easy to make.  I just followed the directions exactly and it turned out perfect - no adjustments necessary (except for leaving out the corn - thought I had some, was wrong, didn't want to go back to the grocery store).  Definitely glad it came out so well because there was a ton of it.  Makes great leftovers for lunch at work.

Wow! I've tried several versions of veggie chili since going vegetarian, but this is by far the best! My meat eating friends and husband all loved it - this will definitely be my new go-to chili recipe. It's incredibly hearty and flavorful.  My only modifications were: 1 28-oz can of crushed tomatoes (as other reviewers suggested), only 1 jalapeno since I only like a bit of spice, and no canned green peppers as I could not find them in my local store. I added a few drops of Frank's Red Hot to taste. Also, just one pack of Mexican-flavored veggie ground round was plenty. Still had a very thick chili in the end!  Served with cornbread, this was the perfect Super Bowl/cold weather meal and there's plenty of extra to enjoy all week.

I loved it. I suggest adding some chopped carrots and substituting some of the whole tomatores for cans of diced. I also put in 2 finely chopped Boca vegetarian Italian sausages. IT turned out great.

This recipe was wonderful.  I found that it was best to eat it the second day, as that seemed to give all the flavors a chance to meld together.  Yummy! It's going to be one of my staples.

This was WAY too salty.  I can't believe none of the reviewers said so.  I am boiling the chili with a potato as I write this review.  Next time I will cut the salt in half, if not more.  I made this with my kids in mind so I didn't add any of the spices and used mild chili powder.  I wonder if the lack of spice is what made me notice the salt.  Overall, however, I thought this was solid and versatile recipe and I will make it again with said modifications.

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I also added more Thai chili powder and also some leftovers chickpeas.  The result? - VERY YUMMY!  It was also very filling.  I didn't find the recipe spicy at all, despise the fact that most reviewers here don't agree. But then again, I'm a native Thai person and I eat a lot of spicy food.  In fact, I also added a considerable amount of very spicy Thai chili powder in as well and it gave a wonderful heat to it.

I LOVE THIS CHILI. So incredibly easy, and if you don't have all of the ingredients it is not a big deal at all. I always make sure to have the basics on hand in case I want to put this in the crock pot to have it waiting for me when I get home from work. I add some extra chili powder and cumin powder because I like my chili to be pretty spicy.

UPDATE: 1/27/09 Made this again, this time with TVP (tex veg protein) def more of a meaty texture. only used one pepper and more onion. Added chipotle chilis and some adobo sauce and it made it smoky. I love it both ways I've made it. Making it again for superbowl tomorrow! We both loved this. Used the "jimmy dean sausauge" looking soy protein to make the crumbles. Going to try TVP next. He liked it so much he just asked me to make it again. Delicious. added more chili powder and only one jap. going to look for chipotle chilis to add too.

This is awesome chili! I didn't add jalapeno peppers since I didn't have any, and I thought it still had a good kick to it. I also didn't add vegetarian burger crumbles, but threw in a can of pinto beans instead. This will be great to make and freeze in containers for lunches during the week.

This was fabulous! I have never tried my hand at making chili (or much else!) and so was very nervous about taking this on, but it worked out great! I followed some of the review advice and reduced the salt to 1tsp and only added one jalapeno and it turned out wonderful. I served it at our huge New Years Eve celebration and everyone kept coming up to me to rave about it. A few people who were very sensitive to heat (almost everyone agreed it had the perfect kick) said that they added some extra sour cream and it was perfect.  Thanks so much for this! I felt like a real chef! :)

My old standby veggie chili has definitely been replaced by this tasty, filling recipe!  I loved it!  I did make a few tweaks based on personal preference: omitted the vegetable protein (fake meat) and increased the beans to compensate, added some carrots, reduced the oregano by half, increased the cumin (almost doubled), and added a dash of cayenne pepper.

Loved it!

Awesome!  I left out the hot peppers and just added red pepper power until it was at the desired hotness.  Added some ground beef and processed it all in a pressure canner according to the time table at the USDA site for chili con carne.  Delicious, and in cans it lasts forever.  Great over spaghetti or for a camping trip.

Really good stuff. A few things to note:
You need a really big pot - or two pots, because this makes a lot of chili. Secondly, it's somewhat time consuming to chop everything up, so do it ahead of time.
Also... I don't like things too spicy. I didn't use any hot peppers or green chili peppers. i just used a few splashes of chili seasoning. 
I used 1 can of stewed tomatoes in place of 1 can of whole peeled tomatoes.
I added 2 zucchini's and replaced a green pepper with a red pepper.

Served with corn bread, sour cream, avocado, and grated cheddar. 
SO GOOD!

I'm not a vegetarian my gf is, but i absolutely love this chili.  I make this almost once a month and the only change ive made to the recipe is adding mushrooms.  Everyone who has tried it liked it and most dont realize its not actually ground beef.

We made a pot of it this week and it was good.  I used my largest pot and it was filled to the brim and was gone in 13 servings.  I followed the recipe exactly, and did not think it was incredible, but it was definitely good.  Only 1 of our 8 is a vegetarian, but it was definitely enjoyed by all.    One thing to note: crushing those tomatoes by hand was messy! but it made for a good texture.  will try roughly chopping them next time!  Thanks!

I didnt use the chickpeas or near as much chili powder. I also simmered it for 2 1/2 hours. Other than that I followed the recipe. Very good. Will make again but plan on making some tweaks. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent!  Everyone on exec liked it.  Definitely spicy; didn't add green chilies and it still had real kick. Only used 12oz of fake meat, but couldn't tell it wasn't real.  Had leftovers!

Followed recipe exactly.  It was edible but was bland.  Used the vegan boca burger crumbles which were dry and rubbery so I don't reccomend them.  Also, there seemed to be too much pepper in this.

This is by far the best chili recipe ever!  I usually make a pot and put it in the fridge so I have lunch throughout the week.  I agree that it is very spicy, so I eliminated the green chilis.

This is the best chili I've ever had!

I put in pinto beans as well as the beans suggested and also added zucchini and summer squash to the recipe. I also used frozen corn rather than canned, and for the canned tomatoes, I bought the fire roasted variety. Original recipe calls for 2 green peppers, I put in 1 green, 1 red, 1 orange and 1 yellow. WONDERFUL!!!! For a protein I used Quorn grounds sauteed in Worcester sauce.  

Fed it to my co-workers and they raved about it for ages! Will definitely make again!

This chili is amazing! I have never made chili and this was easy to follow and make. I fooled all the meat eaters that ate it. The only thing I changed was the amount of jalpeno peppers. I use one whole one and a very small one. It had just enough of a kick.

I have always loved this recipe. I'm used to cooking in a slow cooker, but tonight I tried it on the stove top. Also, I was able to follow the recipe's guidelines for making it spicy. When my children eat it, we have to cut down the spices or else they'll claim we are making them eat fire. It turned out delicious and filled my apartment with the wonderful smell I have come to expect from this recipe. However, it wasn't as spicy as I hoped it would be. I will have to add more next time; I love to eat lava!

I would not recommend leaving out the burger crumbles without replacing them with meat, not more beans. I also left out the jalapenos. Something in it – one of the beans, I think - smelled awful enough simmering that I had a hard time eating it, but it certainly was the best vegetarian chili I’ve ever had, regardless. It was great on toast, with a little butter or sour cream to soften the flavor, and it was much better as leftovers.

I'm not a big fan of vegetarian anything, but I've been trying to eat more nutritiously lately and this recipe makes it easy. I made this for dinner yesterday and it even went over well with someone who doesn't usually eat chili! I used only one can of chilli pepers, eliminated the jalepenos, and the black pepper and used my favorite super hot sauce instead. I also used diced tomatoes and tomato puree until the consistency was as I preferred.
Oh, and because I'm a southern cook, I added sugar (to tatse)to take some of the tang out of the tomatoes. This was great and I expect the leftovers to be even more delicious today.

I loved everything except for how spicy it was. I'm no whimp when it comes to spices, but this was too hot even for me. Next time I'll omit the jalepenos and half the chili powder and black pepper.

WOWeeeee! I have enough to last me all week!
I can't do hot hot foods but I do enjoy a spicy feeling on my lips so I cut the chili peppers and jalapenos. Everything else I left exactly the same. Thanks!

Being a vegetarian in the making I am looking for new recipes to try and was pleasantly suprised in this one and it taste better the second day. Four of my five children also approved, so that's saying a lot! Will put this in our regular rotation.

The name says it all! The only difference I made was I used a little less bell pepper only because my family is not big on it and I exchanged jalapeños for Serrano peppers. My family loved it!

This is great, I followed the recipe for the most part, I added ground turkey instead of the crumbels and I left out the garbanza beans. It had just the right spice and this will be a keeper, but beware it makes a lot!

It's a good thing I tasted this after I was finished making it, because when I served if at a BBQ this afternoon, it disappeared fast and to rave reviews. My husband was mad because there wasn't any left over! This will definitely be added to my repertoire.

Very good chili.  Call me what you will, though, because the general consensus at the dinner we served this at was, ", that's hot!"  We only used 1/8 cup of chili powder (half of what this recipe called for) because I ran out of chili powder.  Running out turned out to be a good thing, though, because any more and we would have been unable to eat it.  Note:  we also doubled the salt that the recipe called for.

Very yummy!  I only added one bag of "beef" crumbles.  I think I'll omit it next time and just add extra veggies.  No one missed the meat at all!  Definitely a keeper!  Thank you!

Great base recipe! Drained and rinsed the beans. Not spicy enough for our tastes so I doubled the chili powder, garlic and cumin. Added two adobo chilies, finely minced, 2 T brown sugar, 1 T cocoa powder, 1/2 t cinnamon, 2 finely chopped carrots.

This is sooo good. Make sure you add both jalepnos AND the seeds...I didn't and mine wasn't spicy at all, but still excellent.

I made some minor changes to the recipe because I didn't have everything in my pantry.  I cut out the oregano because I don't like it, and cut back a little on the hot spices, but it turned out plenty spicy for my company.  I did let it simmer for 2 hours and it improved even more with the extra time on the stove.  It turned out chunky, hearty, and perfect for a Cleveland winter day!

This is a good basic vegetarian chili. I used all the ingredients called for, I just adjusted the amounts on some. I used one jalapeno, but could have used two. I cut the amount of chili powder down to 1 1/2 tsp. I do not like real spicy food, so I cut back. However, next time I will add more. It made such a big pot, that it could have used a little more. I used 2 28 ounce cans of crushed tomatoes and 2 14 ounce cans of petite diced tomatoes. I think I may add even more tomatoes next time. This chili is DEFINITELY better the second day. Tastes great served with cheddar cheese and sour cream. Very Yummy!!!!

This is really yummy, but REALLY spicy. I like spicy, but some people in my family don't. If you add sour cream and cheese when you serve it, its not too bad. I followed the recipe exactly.

Awesome chili!  I tried it twice - once with the corn and once without.  I personally preferred it without the corn (added too much crunch and detracted from the beans and vegan beef crumbles).  This recipe works really well for leftovers!

This recipe lives up to it's claim.  To make it very similar to an award-winning chili recipe from a BBQ competition that I love, I added 1 tsp. cocoa powder and 1 tsp. cinnamon, not usual chili ingredients, but they give a unique taste.  Will make often.

This recipe is DELICIOUS! Being the only Vegetarian in a family of Carnivores. This was a hit even at my house. We made some Chili Frys and Chili (veggie) Hot dogs and everybody raved about it. Makes great left overs. I agree with some of the others that the 1/4 cup of Chili powder may be much for a lot of people. Esp. With all the other chilis and spices in this recipe. But if you like it HOT this is the way to go! :) Yummie!

We had a chili cook-off at work and this recipe tied for the win -- up against recipes chock full of meat...  

I substituted Gimme Lean sausage for the veggie hamburger crumbles.

It was the first time I ever made chili, but I have to say it won't be the last.  It was easy and delicious.

I have made this twice already in two weeks. Great for cold and weather wet like it is now (it's winter here in Australia). I left out black beans because they don't carry it here and used 1/2 package of taco seasoning plus cayenne pepper because of no chili powder. I'm loving this chili! Also, I served it with a little rice cause that's how my momma used to make meat chili.

As a vegetarian, sometimes a hearty chili is the best comfort food! Protein packed and loved by all types of vegans, vegetarians, and meat-a-tarians!!  My changes include: adding scotch-bonnet peppers, sliced portabello mushrooms, and I only added 2 of the crushed tomato cans.

I almost doubled the cumin before I got the approval of my coworkers. I also used ground beef and added frozen corn. After all that I remain impartial to this chili, but would like to try it again.
