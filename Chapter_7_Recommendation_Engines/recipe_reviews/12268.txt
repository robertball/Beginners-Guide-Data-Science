This was wonderful. My dad craves Sour Cream Raisin pie and I found this recipe and he just went crazy. So, now I am making him one for his birthday.

Good recipe. Had to bake for about twice as long as recommended. Will make again.

Goes together so easily, it's beautiful. I used a sifter for the Nutmeg topping and sprinkled it on top that way (like you would with Powdered Sugar) then swirled it with a knife before baking! There's not a lot of sugar in the recipe so I was skeptical, but the Maple Syrup was JUST enough! 
  Classic Old Time Sour Cream Raisin PIe!  And better than some other recipes where you had to stove top everything first and then cool and then bake and then cool....so much simpler!
