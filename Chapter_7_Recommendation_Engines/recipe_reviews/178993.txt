I love tater tot casserole, this recipe is much the same as mine, but I don't add ketchup.  I also add a drained can of corn and a drained can of green beans for extra nutrition, and a 1/2 cup of milk mixed in to loosen it up and stretch the soup.  MMMM MMMM Good!

My wife whipped up a batch of this stuff on a busy weeknight, and after a few bites we both agreed that this is a little casserole that fires on all cylinders. Maybe it's the charming simplicity of the preparation, or the childhood memories brought up by the tater-tots, but we found this concoction to be surprisingly scrumptious; it's got plenty of flavor, and a nice variation in textures.  I suppose it should be noted that we used ground turkey breast instead of ground beef, and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce instead of ketchup.

This is such a great dish!  I did make a few changes and wouldn't change a thing: I didn't add any ketchup.  I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup so it wouldn't be too dry, I added a can of drained french style green beans, sauteed mushrooms and then before putting on the tater tots, I layered the top of the meat mixture with Velveeta slices and topped that with french fried onions and then put the tator tots on top.  Yummy!

This was great, except I kind of changed a lot of stuff. I left out the worcestershire altogether, and I only added ketchup at the end- for dipping. I  also added a package of frozen chopped broccoli- so that we could get our vegetables in. It was good. The broccoli really lended itself to the dish.

Always a staple in our house when I was growing up!  The only thing I do differently is add cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom soup, a small container of cream cheese and a small container of sour cream.  I also bake the tots while the hamburger and onion are cooking because we like to have them a little crunchy, which may help cut down on some of the mushiness that other reviewers are mentioning.  Overall though, great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

I didn't use the ketchup, but I found the Worchestshire sauce to be a delicious addition to this. It really added to the flavor. My entire family gobbled it up. We always have leftovers, but not with this one. It was actually requested that I make a BIGGER pan of it next time. lol thank you!!

This recipe is good if you're looking for something quick and very easy.  It probably doesn't need all the onion but it does have good flavor.  I think next time I'd coat the entire top with tator tots...it kind of helps even out the mushiness.  I'll probably make it again if I get in a crunch for time and ingredients.

This dish was delicious and comforting, super easy to make. I did add granulated garlic to the ground beef for extra flavor. I used homemade condensed cream of chicken soup (super easy and fast), and added corn kernels, cheddar cheese and topped the casserole with tons of tater tots. My family loved it.

This wasn't bad for a quick and easy meal.  I put the hashbrowns over the entire top.  I have a family of 5 and I think next time I will make 2 pans.  The kids really liked it.

I loved this. It's easy, tastey, filling, and not expensive to make. Reheats well, and the tater tot topping is just plain fun! :) I added about 2 c frozen mixed (diced) veggies and it worked nicely. This is in my official rotation.

This was really good and very easy! I was looking for something beyond just the regular tater tot casserole I had in my cookbook and the Worcestershire sauce and ketchup helped to add some needed flavor. The only thing I did different was put a layer of tater tots on the bottom, then the meat mixture, and then more tots on top. My 5 yr old had two helpings!

I have made tator tot casserole a few times but something was missing . . . however, I made this recipe using the ketchup and worcestershire and thought thats what was missing! I also added the can of green beans and corn and put shredded cheddar on it. I think its good. I was leary with the corn as I thought the texture wouldn't be good, but I was pleasantly surprised as I just usually make it with the green beans. Anyway, I would add the ketchup for those that are saying they haven't, I do think it adds to the flavor.

Good quick dinner.  I used the ingredients as stated, adjusting the amounts for the meal that I was making.  I did add cheese only for personal preference.  The family enjoyed the flavor that the ketchup and worcestershire sauce added to this homey dish.

Really good!  I only switched the soup to cream of chicken because my hubby really isn't a fan of onions so the amount already called for was enough for him to take.  My girls both asked for more after finishing their first serving in about 5 min (usually takes them 30-45 min to eat supper) so I would say kid friendly as well.

We did add cheddar cheese on the top and didn't really think that it added anything.  I will probably double the worcestershire and ketchup mixture and maybe add green onions.  

Really good recipe and easy on the budget.

My great grandmother used to make this and has passed on the recipe to me. I now make it with ground turkey and cream of chicken and cream of celery soups. I have never put ketchup in it or worcestershire sauce either. I do however put 2 cans of drained green beans. I use part of the green bean juice to dilute the soup enough to pour over the meat and beans, then I arrange the tater tots on top so it is all totally covered.
My mother-in-law has also passed on this recipe, but she uses a can of tomato soup and then my husband likes to put ketchup on it after it is served. Both ways are yummy, but I prefer the cream soup version. It is a true comfort food to me!!!

I seem to be in the minority on this one but this was just ok.  I wanted to love it but it was lacking something, not sure what.  Made it for friends and their 4 boys and no one was real impressed.  It's a "stick to your ribs" kind of meal that would be best on a cool fall/winter day and is very simple to prepare, but I probably won't be making again.

I never would have thought a tablespoon of ketchup and a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce would make that big of an impact. I was wrong. I'm not a fan of Cream of Mushroom soup alone in a recipe. I'll use it but usually mixed with Cream of Celery. This time, I made the recipe exactly as written, with a little shredded cheese just because my family likes cheese. (And actually, it was more for show than for taste, that's how little I used.) The addition of ketchup and Worcestershire sauce altered the mushroom soup flavor perfectly. It added just a hint of zip. For my family, I tripled the ingredients and baked it in two 9x13 dishes. I used enough tater tots to completely cover the top of each of the casseroles so that was a bit more than what the recipe called for. My family loved it. Can't believe I haven't made this dish before now.

I thought this was horrible.  I ended up taking the tater tots out and eating them without the sauce, so at least I didn't have to throw the whole dish out, but the tater tots still had a little of the sauce on them, so they still weren't as good as if I had just made plain old regular tater tots.

My 6 year old kept asking for this...it's his favorite school lunch.  I used onion powder (since my kids turn their noses up at onions), and soy sauce instead of worcestershire sauce (because that is all I had) and it turned out good.  The kids loved it which is what I was going for  but it was missing something for my husband & I.

Had good flavor, but it needed either to have tater tots on the entire surface or served over bread to take away some of the heaviness of the meal.  Will be making again though.

I used BBQ sauce instead of catsup, and added grated cheese at the beginning of the baking, not at the end.  So, after 25 minutes, it was hot and bubbly around the tater tots.  Also, I used the 'extra crispy' tots, so they were still crispy at the end of the baking.  Delicious!  So easy, and the kids love it!

My husband was sort of eh about this but the kids ate it right up. I had to use less beef and less tater tots and I added a shake of all purpose seasoning and added a half bag of green beans into the hamburger mixture. I preferred it with ketchup on top of it. Easy dinner with a salad and biscuits. This wont make my weekly rotation but I will make it at least once a month.  Thanks!

I had 4 people to feed, 3 of them being men and boys with big appetites. I prepared as described but it sure didn't look like very much so I added another can of mushroom soup and some mixed vegetables. I took one of the reviewers advice and covered the top with tater tots. Good thing I did because every bit was gone and they were wanting more. Next time I'll double it and probably add two cans of soup and more veggies. Quick and easy!

I didn't really care for this.  It was edible, but the ground beef mixture was really lacking.

I forgot to defrost my roast, and needed something in a pinch. Everyone wanted my default spaghetti. But I was sick of it and wanted something new. So I made this and just like that, a new staple! I only changed a few small things after reading reviews: I used ground turkey & seasoned it well (my family's preference), added can of corn, can of mushrooms, and 4 heaping tbs. of ricotta cheese. I also topped with french fried onions before adding a whole bag of tots, and about 10 minutes before completion I sprinkled with a shredded 3 cheese blend (again we love cheese). Ok...looking back I guess this is a whole different recipe, but boy was it yummy! Thanks for the inspiration :)

Great comfort food for picky eaters.  I tried grated sharp cheddar on top (below the tater tots), all of the kids ate it!  Thank you!

Excellent base recipe, but made some changes,1-lb ground Turkey, 1- med onion,chopped, 2 Tablespoons minced garlic, 1/2 cup green peppers,chopped 1 can (5oz forgot to look) chili peppers drained, 1/2 bag frozen mixed veggies, 1 can cream of chicken soup,3-Tbls Worcestershire sauce, 3- Tbls BBQ sauce (sweet rays) 1-tsp liquid smoke, 2TBLs- 21 Salute spice (trader Joe's), 2-tsp smoked paprika,1-2 tsp cracked black pepper, 1/4- 1/3 cup chicken broth, 1/3 cup milk, 2 TBls corn starch, 1- cup shredded cheddar cheese, 36 oz bag of tater tots.

Cook ground turkey a bit then add onions, garlic, green peppers, can of chili peppers, I add the Spices 21 salute, smoked Paprika, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, BBQ sauce, liquid smoke continue cooking, add 1/2 bag of mixed veggies,chicken broth cook for about 15 mins the add corn starch to the milk, mix and add to meat and veggie mixture let thicken about 5-10 mins, pour into greased 11x9 pan top with shredded cheddar cheese. Take tots and mince in food processor not to small...then top the mixture with chopped tots, put in oven cook 20 mins then broil to crisp the top......came out added more cheese to top but very little didn't want tots to get mushy, came out awesome thick and filling my guys (hubby son 17,son 22) loved it so much they ate the whole pan. Looks like a lot of work but it took me about 30 mins.

You've got to cover the entire casserole with tater tots, that's the kids favorite part! I let it cook 10 extra minutes, for a nice, crunchy topping. I also added green beans, for some extra veggies.

I can honestly say I have never been a fan of Tater Tot Casseroles, but my 3 guys have.  After trying this one, we'll be having it more often!!  I did change a few things up;  I added a cup of corn and then, topped it with a cup of cheddar cheese and a cup of cornflakes.  We loved the added flavor!

This is O.K. I went back to my classic Tater Tot casserole. It calls for Campbells Golden Mushroom soup and skips the ketchup and worcestershire sauce. The flavor is richer than the cream of mushroom version

There's so many recipes for Tater Tot casserole out there.  I thought this one had the best base, but I did make some changes.  I like my casseroles saucy, so I doubled the soup, ketchup and Worcestershire sauce.  I also added 3/4 cup of milk or gravy or whatever I have on hand to loosen it up a bit.  Don't bother measuring 3 cups of Tater Tots, just use the full 32 oz bag.  I also added a couple cloves of garlic.  I decided the one thing this recipe was missing was cheese.  I layered on an entire 8 oz bag of sharp cheddar before the Tater Tots and it sort of disappeared into the casserole.  Believe it or not, slicing up 16 oz of Velveeta worked better... I guess if you're going to go processed, you might as well go all the way!  I tried adding sauteed mushrooms, but didn't think it added enough to make it worth the effort.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!!! I browned the tots in oven while I was cooking the meat. I used 2 lbs of meat. 1 can mushroom soup and 2 table spoons of ketchup and Worcestershire sauce.  I also added some heavy cream in the mixture.  Baked for 15 minutes and then added 1 cup Monterey Jack cheese and baked another 10 minutes.  The flavor is outstanding!  Also added a can of drained green beans.  Well worth making..

Tried it as is and I think it's okay.  Next I added spices to the meat, a little extra Worcestshire, french green beans and cheese.  I personally like it better that way.

Really good! It didn't blow me away or anything, but it's a nice quick meal that doesn't have really strong flavors so most people won't be picky about it. I used bbq sauce instead of ketchup and cheddar cheese on the top (during the last five minutes) as per another reviewer. I also added italian seasoning, garlic salt, and chopped garlic to the meat and onions while cooking. I used a 9x13 pan and it only had to cook for 15 minutes total in the oven.

This is so quick and easy.  I did take the advice of others and did not add the ketchup.  It really isn't necessary.  I also add shredded cheddar cheese to the top.  And put the tater tots all over.  My family really loves it and it's just as good heated up the next day.

I used BBQ sauce in place of the ketchup and put a half cup of cheese on top of the meat mixture, then layered the tater tots on top and then put another half cup of cheese over that (during the last five minutes of cooking).  Next time, I would add a can of green beans and/or whole kernel corn.  It was still good though!

I have been making a similar version to this for many years. I wanted to try something a little different and I LOVED this. I did add a bag of cheddar cheese onto the top but other than that everything was exactly as the recipe stated. It had so much flavor to it!

This recipe is very flavorful, was a favorite of mine as a child. There is clearly peas in the photo but not listed in the ingredients, I add peas and top the tater tots with cheese. I do not add the ketchup and add 1/4 of the onions, they are not necessary.

I made this last night for my picky boyfriend and we loved it! My suggestions: I added frozen mixed veggies (will not use the kind with green beans again. They were too strong.) and shredded cheddar cheese to the mix. I used a package of onion soup mix instead of plain onion. I layered shredded cheddar on top of the tots and allowed the tots to get nice and crispy, which took closer to 35 minutes, and I used ground turkey instead of beef. I served it with salad and ciabatta bread. Amazing for kids or adults or anyone who likes comfort food!

I had forgotten all about this classic dish. My children used to love having this for dinner when they were rather young. As they got older I had completely forgotten this comfort food. I have prepared this recipe many times as written and it was a great success, reminding me of childhood, comfort food at its best and great on a cold night.

I was looking for a way to use leftover taco meat, pouring over recipes for tamale pie etc. I stumbled across Tater tot casserole and thought, why not? I didn't have to cook any hamburger so I used dried onion instead of fresh. I mixed the soup, ketchup, onion, Worcestershire sauce,and precooked meat, all in a large bowl. I then spooned it all into a greased dish, arranged the Tater tots, and sprinkled with cheese. I prepared the casserole during my lunch break and it is sitting in the fridge wrapped in foil, waiting for me to pop it in the oven when I get home from work tonight.

I have made this dish also using the BBQ sauce that others have mentioned, and also adding a bit of sour cream if I have too much hamburger.

This is a good framework, but it needs improvement.  I brown the ground beef by itself (be sure to salt & pepper after drained)and then sauté the onions in the grease left in the pan after draining the beef.  Toss the beef back in, mix in all the other ingredients.  My husband likes veggies in but I don't, so my compromise is adding in 1/2 bag of heated sweet corn.  I don't feel this is moist enough as written so I add a second can of soup.  Put everything in a greased casserole dish then top with four rows of ten tater tots.  Bake for 30 minutes and let set for ten to set up.  My family inhaled this.

Tasty enough solid comfort food. My husband thought it was on the boring side, though, so it could use a little something else. I loved how few pans I needed to use! I also added grated cheese, which helped some. We liked it with ketchup and mustard on the side.

I have been looking for a GOOD Tater Tot Casserole recipe for years now. I finally found one! Everyone in my family loved it. We made it without vegetables (because of my husband and daughter) so I just added a nice scoop of a veggie mix to it and I was good to go! Thank you! You saved me from many more horrible Tater Tot Casserole recipes!

my 5 yr old son loved it, my husband said it would be better with out onions. I left out Worcestershire and ketchup, and sprinkled Velveeta cheese on top before the tater tots and sprinkled some cheddar on top of the tots. It was really good, but too oniony.. next time will use 1/4 onion!

This was pretty good.  Nothing sensational, but its a tater tot casserole, so you can't expect that anyway!  Its very easy to make - perfect for busy nights & easily a kid favorite.  I precooked the tater tots to avoid them turning out mushy, added minced garlic & extra worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture, & sprinkled shredded pepperjack cheese on top.

We loved this but we did make a few additions.  We added 2 cups of frozen mixed vegetables and a package of broccoli and rice with the amount of liquid that it called for.  We had to bake it for an hour to make sure that frozen vegetables and rice were done.

My family loved it! We had never tried a tator tot casserole before. I did add in a couple of thinks just to give it a little more flavor.  I added about 3 or 4 oz. cream cheese cubed and stired in ground beef and soup mixture until completely melted and a few dashes of seasoning salt.  It was very YUMMY!

This was a great, simple recipe. I have a family of 6 plus a full daycare so pleasing the kids is a must. I tripled the recipe & added tots over the whole top plus cheese right before taking out of the oven  there were no leftovers. I will definitely make this again!

I have a house full of picky eaters and this was a hit. As did strain 1 can of corn, 1 can of green beans, and added 1/2 c. Of milk to the soup mixture. This was just to add nutrition and volume to the meal. Makes just enough for a dinner with 5 BUUUT we will double next time for leftovers :-) super good!

I used this recipe as more of a guideline as I rarely follow them exact. I sauted 3\4 of a yellow onion, minced four garlic, and browned 1lb leaned ground turkey meat because I don't eat beef. I drained the onion, garlic and meat mixture added a package of frozen vegetables medley, Worcestershire,  melted about a handful of shredded kraft  Mexican cheese with a hint of Philadelphia, and two cans of cream of mushroom soup so it wasnt so dry. I poured the mixture in a glass pan and spring a light layer of Mexican cheese on top and put gator tots over the entire thing! Then I seasoned that with Season All and pepper, baked for about 30 minutes and served with Texas toast. Yum yum! I'll make it again!

We make this all the time, it is my son's favorite.  The only changes that I make are, I add milk to the soup to thin a little, a can of drained green beans, and instead of ketchup we use bbq sauce.   I cover the casserole with shredded cheese.   It is a staple in our house

I dont care for any tater tot casserole at all, but my husband loves it. I dont use ketchup or Worcestershire but I do add some onion soup mix to the beef after browning with just a touch of water and let it cook off - like when using taco seasoning. I also add shredded cheddar the last few minutes of baking.

I was searching for a kid-friendly recipe as I have four picky yet adventurous kids. I made this exactly to a T. It turned out "soupy" and it just spread out across the plate. You know kids are very visual eaters, so the appearance didn't go well. They tried it and only one liked it. They said it had a weird flavor, I know it was the Worcestershire and ketchup combo.  My husband and I didn't mind it, if I make this again, I would omit-add, a few of the ingredients.

Easy prep.  Family (3 boys/men) liked enough for seconds and leftovers.  Two simple modifications I made by personal preference:  Swapped out ketchup for  A-1.  That was a hit.  Sprinkled a little lawry's season salt over the top of assembled dish to flavor the tator tots.  I also added a can of corn to save myself time cleaning a second dish, not necessarily to spruce up the recipe.

This dish is super yummy, even my 18month old ate it up. I did make some changes, though. First I boiled some yellow and green zucchini, red and green bell pepper, carrots, corn, potatoes and green beans for about 20 minutes, drained. I also used ground pork instead of beef and sautaed some onions with the pork. I did not use the worstersire sauce or catsup. I used a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of chicken with about 2 tablespoons of milk. I seasoned with Mrs. Dash, fresh ground organic pepper medley and paprika and mixed about a cup of shredded Colby jack cheese. I also baked the tator tots alone for 10 minutes to give it a little extra crispiness. Delicious!!!

Wow. I grew up on this casserole! The only thing we do different is add a can of mixed vegetables to the ground beef mixture. We bake it for an hour at 350. This is such a great comfort food and I agree with the other reviewers about it having such a great variety of textures and flavor.

Absolutely love this - using ketchup (for just a tad of extra zing), Worcestershire, and all. The only thing I did differently was used Healthy Request soup, 1/2 cup of shredded cheese mixed in with the beef/soup mixture, and put a can of green beans (drained) at bottom of the round casserole dish.  I will definitely make this again.

Fast, easy, tasty, kids and family enjoyed it and asked for it again! I like the addition of the ketchup and particularly the Worcestershire sauce: it takes it to a more 'adult' level that everyone enjoys. Less soupy, more tasty!
Please, if you make it the first time, prepare it as is! Without those additions, it's just meat and soup!

This was great -both easy and satisfying.  Because we were out of Cream of anything soup, substituted a can of Campbell's Beef gravy, and I think we will always cook this with the gravy in place of the soup.  I did sprinkle a little freshly grated medium sharp cheddar on before covering the entire dish with tater tots.  Used a 9x9 pan.

I've been making a variation of this for a few years now, we use a can of cream of celery soup along with the mushroom soup and mix about half a cup of shredded cheese in with it, sprinkling more cheese on top of the tater tots. Yummy comfort food!!

Read the reviews. We like things light and lower fat so here's my  changes:  used ground turkey. First sautéed onions and green bell pepper diced, reduced with a splash of white wine and broth, reduced for 3 mins. I had already browned the turkey, so added it to this mixture. Added cream of chicken soup, and half can of Hormel Turkey Chili ( for flavor), added a few jar jalapeño's chopped and season to taste. Sprayed oval casserole dish, put meat mixture then a light layer of Cheddar, topped with a bag of frozen mixed veggies. Top it with thawed Tater Tots. Baked at 350 for 50 mins, then broiled last 5 mins. Served shredded cheese at the table ( this saves calories)Tators were crunchy and the meat had good flavor. Hubby was surprised and had seconds! Will make this easy comfort recipe again! Thanks!

Tasty, warm comfort food...very similar to shepherd's pie but with a mushroom, cream gravy, instead of a beef gravy. Fast to make and easy to reheat leftovers. I like my food very flavorful so I used all the seasonings in original recipe plus some garlic powder, extra ketchup, a second can of cream chicken soup (next time I will try cream of celery), shredded carrots, frozen peas, chopped one stalk of celery and pepper to taste. Covered with layer of shredded cheese and covered the entire casserole with tots. If you are watching sodium intake, don't add salt to the recipe and maybe try no salt cream soup. Will make again.

I was surprised because I really like each of the ingredients alone and it got so many good reviews. Maybe it would be okay without the Worcestshire. The tang of that with the mushroom soup was an unpleasant combination.

This is a simple and delicious staple in every American home! It was delicious! I have read some reviews and think that it is fun to 'tweak' the recipe a bit, adding veggies or cheese to the top, using Sweet Baby Rays instead of ketchup, or switching the hamburger for turkey! I am happy to have come across this recipe and will remember this and the adjustments to try again next time! It was a hit with my husband and kids!

Love this recipe. The only thing I changed was instead of ketchup and worcestershire I use 1 to 2 tbls of bbq sauce. Also instead of Cream of Mushroom soup (husband hates mushrooms) I use cream of celery soup.

Hard to go wrong with meat and potatos. Taste great, quick and easy. Followed as instructed, except seasoned ground beef and added few tblsp of sriracha sauce to soup mixture, topped with cheddar. 

Used leftovers and mixed with scrambled eggs. Made a nice quick breakfast!

The tater tot casserole I grew up with is just like this, minus the ketchup/worcestershire sauce, but plus corn/green beans and cheese on top.  I think this version is much tastier, but I still added veggies and cheese.  Delicious!

This was good but not great. I altered a few things as a few ppl suggested: I used sweet baby rays BBQ sauce instead of ketchup and did add cheddar cheese on top then tater tots on top of cheese. It was super easy and I will probably make again when I am looking for something quick. Also, I didnt have worcestershire sauce, so next time i will include it and  try following the recipe better but still add the cheese. (hope this helps!)

This was ok.  Nothing too great for us.  I added some shredded cheddar cheese to the mix and it made the dish better.  Probably won't be making this again though, just wasn't something we liked very much.

My husband absolutely loved this. I wasn't thrilled with the health factor but it was very tasty. My only complaint is that it needed double or maybe even triple the hashbrowns.

I've never done a tater tot casserole and was pleasantly surprised at how this turned out.  I added some minced garlic while cooking the ground beef and onions.  I left out the ketchup but added frozen chopped broccoli for the beef, soup and worcestershire mixture and also added a layer of velveeta before covering completely with tater tots.  Perfect fit for a full 9x9 square.  Will be making again.  Thanks!

I had to improvise a bit with this recipe.  I didn't have tater tots so I used a can of diced potatoes and I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I also threw in a bag of mixed veggies.  I used both the ketchup and worcestershire sauce.  I used about 1/2 tsp onion powder instead of real onion and I added 1 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp seasoned salt. Topped with cheddar cheese and baked for about 20 minutes.  Turned out great.

I followed the advice of a lot of people on here and put the tater tots over the whole thing and added cheese.    It's also yummy to serve it with ketchup and mustard and pickle slices.

Knowing my family I doubled the beef, soups, and sauces and used a 32 oz bag tater tots . I also added 1 12 oz bag steam fresh corn (drained) and 1 12 oz bag steam fresh peas (drained). I mixed all the ingrediants together for the casserole as opposed to just the edges for the tots. I used 1 vidalia onion. I baked for 25 minuites then added shredded cheddar cheese on top for 5 more minuites. It turned out awesome and the entire family gobbled it up!

i can't say this is the healthiest of meals.... but it is easy and satisfying.  i didn't use worchestshire sauce.... thought i had some, but didn't.  i used lowfat soup and added a small bag of peas and carrots to get some veg in there.  i also added an extra squirt of ketchup and garlic powder.  with the peas and carrots, it reminded me of a shepherd's pie with the tater tots replacing mashed potatoes.  would definitely make again.  great when you need something fast and tasty:).

The recipe will rate 10 starts just by substituting cheese soup  for the cream of mushroom.  With 3 teenagers in the house, I always make a double batch and  use 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can cream of cheese.  Much better with the tater tots.  Also stretch the recipe by adding 2 cans of Veg-All vegetables.

I seasoned the ground beef with black pepper and garlic. I also added a half cup of milk to the soup. I topped the layer of ground beef in the baking pan with shredded cheddar cheese.  I then layered the entire dish with extra crispy tater tots before baking for 25 minutes. My husband was pleasantly surprised with the flavor of this casserole as was I. I will definitely make this again and again. Thanks for the recipe!

I use ground beef, no onions and cream of chicken soup. I don't add ketchup or worcestershire sauce. I do a layer of tots on the bottom then a layer of the soup and ground beef mixed together. Then cheddar cheese, then more tots then ground beef and soup and then cheddar cheese and then tots, then top it off with more cheddar cheese. I finish it by topping it off with criss cross bacon strips. It's not for dieting or every week, I see this more as a birthday or holiday treat.

I used my own homemade ketchup and I did add about 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I added in with all the other ingredients and put all in bottom of 9x13 greased dish. Put 1/2 cup of shredded cheese (your choice) then added my tater tots all over the  top.  Baked and last 5 mins put another 1/2 cup of shredded cheese. Baked until melted.  Loved it!

I made it twice as is and thought it was great. However I am also big at adding my own flare to a recipe. I add frozen mixed veggies and double the Worcestershire sauce. Also add seasoning salt, pepper, and garlic powder to meat. Lastly top off with cheese the last 5 minutes of baking..This is a highly requested meal in my house..

k, so I have made this several times and is is really good each time. I use ground turkey, no ketchup or Worcestershire sauce, a tsp of liquid smoke, 8 oz bag of mixed frozen vegetables, and some about 1/3 cup of almond milk to loosen up the soup. Added 1/3 tsp of celery seed seasoning, black pepper to taste and sprinkled cheddar cheese on top prior to going in the oven.I know this seems like a lot of alterations but you have to modify according to you and others that are eating it.Thanks for the recipe my picky 13 year old likes this.

My family enjoyed this recipe. I had everything, except the mushroom soup, so I used Cream of Celery. It was yummy. Sprinkled a little cheddar cheese on top. Will make again.

Its okay. Its not something I would go out of my way to tell everyone about or rush to make for company. Its more of something you would make when you have random ingredients around that you need to use up.

I added a layer of cheese just before the tater tots and used canned corn instead of peas. I'm sure you could use just about any veggie in there, too. Loved it!!!

I make this for my dad and brother all of the time, they devour it! I add cheese on top about halfway through cooking it so it doesn't dry out and harden. I also add extra ketchup and use cream of celery soup instead of mushroom. I love the other comments because they always help me make the recipe even better :D

Pretty Comfort food casserole. I really liked this as a basic recipe that you can add a lot of your own flare to. I read other people's reviews and added a can of green beans to the casserole. I also realized at the last minute that I didn't have cream of mushroom soup, but I did have Campbell's condensed Cheddar Cheese soup. So I used that and added a small can of mushrooms to ad a bit of savory to it. I also added a tiny bit of chicken broth to spread the sauce a bit. I think the original recipe would also be amazing, but my "mistakes" also turned out well! Next time I'll make it with the correct soup and see which I prefer. This is a great fast meal though and very hearty.

This was a pretty good meal with several tweaks. I used a can of cream of mushroom and a can cream of chicken. I felt it needed more than one can and I was right. I added a bag if frozen mixed vegetables to the pot with the meat mixture. I also omitted the ketchup. I baked for 25 minutes added about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese to the top and baked for another 5 minutes.

I gave 5 only because I used it as a "base recipe" instead ground beef I tore apart 4 5 oz cube steaks and seasoned with garlic salt,onion salt,chicken boulon (sp?),pink sea salt ,pepper and cavender's greek seasoning cooked that up and drained. While cooking preheated oven to 350 instead of 425 . I did two cans of cream of mushroom full flavor not reduced sodium or fat free. Added about 8 oz of whole milk. 2 cans of corn mixed well then added the cooked. Then added about half a bag of tots mixed well and topped with the rest of the bag of tots. Covered with the glass top for my casserole dish. Baked for 55 mins and removed the top for the last 5 minutes. It turned out amazing lots of flavor the tots were fully cooked and nice and browned on the top. It was much better than other recipes I had tried where the flavor was bland and the tots never seemed fully cooked.

I actually dice up bell pepper, celery, & onion with a tiny bit of minced garlic. I like a lot of flavor in my food. I have never added the Worcestershire sauce or ketchup, but I may add it this time.

Good!  I used Nature's Promise ground turkey in place of the beef.  Added frozen corn to the pan & heated a couple minutes before putting in baking dish.  Baked the allotted time then added 2 cups Nacho Cheese on the tater tots.  Kids loved it!

OK -- always thought this was a rather gross recipe but hubby grew up on it so I caved.
I did half a can of corn, a quarter of a can of each: cheddar cheese soup, cream of mushroom and cream of chicken.
Took the BBQ sauce tip and used instead of ketchup and added about a tablespoon of fresh basil just because.
Baked and sprinkled with shredded parmesan because that's what I had.
It was really good! I baked it in the toaster oven because it is July in MS and I think I don't have to explain---but yes, it was good. Now off to the treadmill!

I followed the recipe to a T, except that I used French Fries instead of the tater tots (due to a picky eater) and it turned out good. Could've used some cheese or maybe even the French fried onions like someone suggested. It is different than the normal tater tot casserole, if that's what you're looking for. There was only a little left in the pan between three people and two babies; had to taste somewhat good!! :)

This is a great basic recipe,
just omitted the ketchup, and
used soy sauce instead of 
worcestershire sauce. Oh,
and I added Chedder Cheese soup.

This was easy and quick to make. I used ground turkey instead of beef, added a can of cream of chicken and mushroom, 1/2 cup of milk and a drained can of corn. I also swapped sweet baby rays bbq for the ketchup. Delish!

Delicious! The only thing that I changed was I used picante sauce instead of ketchup because I didn't have any on hand.

Very good!!!! I added 1/3 of chipotle sauce and seasoned the meat with cumin, paprika and garlic powder. After cooking was done I added cheese to the tots. No ketchup. Hmmmm

I have made this several times now and everybody absolutely loves it! I did add some minced garlic and green bell pepper but that is it everything else I left the same. Wonderful recipe.

Total comfort food. My family loved it. I used lean ground turkey and reduced sodium mushroom soup. To make it a bit more convenient, I used already frozen diced onions. Was a bit healthier, super fast to whip up and delicious.

Good basic comfort food recipe that you can prepare as-is, or dress up however you see fit.  I have added different spice and/or seasoning blends while cooking the beef and onions (taco seasoning is a nice change of pace, so is Penzeys Tsardust Memories/Russian blend). I also fill in the whole top with tater tots, and generally sprinkle the top with shreds of whatever cheese I have on hand. Adding various vegetables could be interesting...thus far, I've only ever added extra mushrooms. It's a good starting point for taking a comfort food classic  some fun places, but it's great as written, too!

Today was my fist time making this casserole.  It was requested by one of my nephews for Thanksgiving dinner, so I decided to try it out.  The recipe was so easy and everyone loved it.  I made a double batch and they still ate all of it.  This is definitely going into my staple dishes.  The taste buds of my whole family thank you.  :)

I make the basic recipe for Tater Tot Hot dish, but I do doctor it up with whatever I have in the fridge to bulk it up and give it a twist.  Today I browned 1# of ground turkey with about five pieces of chopped bacon.  I added the onion but also included 1/2 of a chopped green pepper.  I seasoned the mixture with salt and pepper(today was peppercorn from the grinder).  I poured the mixture in a casserole dish, covered the top(orderly manner)with onion tatter tops and baked it for approx. 1/2 hour to 45 minutes at 425 degrees.  At the end, take the lid off of the dish and let it browned and crispiness desire.  With the hot dish, I love to make a pan of brown gravy with garlic bread and a side of vegetables.

This is a good, simple weekday recipe.  4 stars because if I hadn't added water to the meat mix it would have been dry.  I also added some French's french fried onions on top for the last few mins of baking and they added lots of great flavour.

Great base recipe and easy to change to personal preferences.  I left out ketchup, added dry onion soup mix to hamburger and added green beans.  Also used the entire bag of tots.

Very easy and very good! Add some cottage cheese and shredded cheddar on top, I subbed Worthington vegetarian burger for the hamburger, and used roasted garlic cream of mushroom. It tasted great for something so simple and so easy!

Have made 4 times (including right now) in the past 3 months. This time a double batch! The family loves this and gobbles it up fast! I make extra as we love the leftovers! They will even eat it for breakfast. The recipe is perfect "as is" but we do add veggies (frozen corn, peas, green beans etc) for a complete meal. With cheese added at the end or not, it's so comforting! I always use almost the whole bag of tater tots to cover the entire top. I could make this once a week and the kiddos wouldn't tire of it! Thanks for a great recipe that makes everyone happy!

Beef with onion as written is okay, but we did not like the ketchup or Worcestershire Sauce. 
Redo, easier and quicker,Campbell's Cr. of Ckn (our preference),1 cup milk, 3 cups grated cheddar,and hamburger browned with onion and garlic.  I have also made this with breakfast sausage, 2 tbsp flour added after browned, cook another minute, add 1 1/2 c milk, stir thoroughly, add cr. of Chicken, stir thoroughly, put into pan, with 2 cups mozza and then 1 c cheddar layered on top.  Cooked the tater tots off in separate pan for 15 minutes and then put them onto the casserole (less soggy preference for my kids). No additional seasonings added and the sausage makes a fine "gravy" to have with the tater tots!! Easy to change this up many different ways and even triples well. Add in corn, or other veggies, or other cheeses, or other sausage flavors, or taco seasoning on hamburger, or green chilies added.... Very flexible.

Was a pinch to make and the family gobbled it all up.  I had to fight off the kids so my husband and I could have some.  I had everything on hand and was quick and easy.  Will be a weekday go-to recipe from now on!

This was great! Brought back memories of my mom's home cookin'. I did a coule of tweaks. I added 1/2 cup of peas, and 1/2 cup of sour cream to the meat mixture.  I also sprnkled some cheddar cheese on top of the meat mixture before topping it with the tater tots.  It was really good!

This recipe is good. I don't cook my burger just flatten it out on the bottom of the pan. I would add a little milk or sour cream to the soup. Also add a layer of shredded chesse before the tots or fries. This isn't diet food.

5 stars because this is the easiest tater tot casserole I've ever made, it's ridiculously quick, and it was good as is with no modifications. I also like the Duggars' tater tot casserole recipe, but it's too heavy on the potatoes. This recipe was better balanced. Cheers!

I made this last night. The great thing about this dish is like shepherd's pie, there are infinite ways to make it your own. I made some changes. I did use the ketchup and worcestershire sauce (in fact I can't imagine how bland it would be without it!). I only had a family-size can of cream of mushroom soup and I used about 3/4 of it. I used dehydrated onion because my husband doesn't like to bit into pieces of onion. While cooking meat and onion I added in some black pepper and garlic salt. I added 3/4 can whole kernel corn and 3/4 can french cut green beans. I topped the beef/veggie mixture with shredded cheddar and topped it with wall-to-wall tater tots. I baked it for 35-40 minutes so the tater tots would get crispy. It was good but still "missing something" and a tad bland. My 5 year old and I topped it with some ketchup before eating and that was pretty good. I thought reheating would be bad because the tater tots wouldn't be crunchy but it was actually better! The flavors had time to get stronger and mix. I still had to top it with ketchup though. Next time I will double up on the ketchup and worcestershire sauce and maybe add some more spices. Also, my husband suggested a "man's" tater tot casserole with crisp, crumbled bacon and BBQ sauce instead of ketchup and maybe the SLIGHTEST drop of liquid smoke. Hmmmmm...he may be on to something!

This was sooooo good!  I precooked the onion in a bit of olive oil, added garlic powder and peas to the beef mixture, and put a layer of cheese under the tator tots (so they still got crispy).  Next time I will make a double batch!

This is my go-to recipe when I want something quick and satisfying! When I make this casserole, I use ground turkey, add another can of cream of mushroom (or cream of chicken) soup and add a layer of sharp cheddar cheese before I put on the tater tots. Yum!!

OMG! This was awesome! Made it so my picky 3yr old would eat it and I ended up eating All of it!  So good!  Followed recipe exactly except for no ketchup, and cheese on top before the tots.  Will DEFINITELY make again.  Thanks!

The sauce was weird. My kids wouldn't touch it. I don't know what I think about adding the ketchup and a whole tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce.

My family loves when I put this on the table for dinner, and I love the versatility of it!  I have made it exactly as stated and it was devoured.  I have also used cheddar cheese soup and salsa and mixed vegetables or barbecue sauce and it has been eaten just as quickly.  The only thing that limits this recipe's adaptability is your own personal tastes.  Enjoy!!

Only giving it 3 stars because I made a few alterations: added bag of mixed veggies, topped with cheddar cheese and breadcrumbs. Came out very well and everyone in my family enjoyed it!

I really enjoyed the taste that the ketchup and Worcestershire sauce provided!

I like this; but after I put meat mixture in bottom, I layer mashed potatoes, corn, & shredded cheddar, I then arrange the tator tots over the entire top in rows.

I have made this recipe for years. In face, when one of our grown sons comes home to visit, he requests this dish more than anything! One thing I have always done differently is bake the tater tots separately. This way, they are super-crispy - not mushy. I add them to the dish right before serving. I also add veggies - whatever I have on hand.

Very good!!  I doubled the recipe and added garlic with the ground beef and onion.  It was a little bland so I added a little more worcestershire and some seasoning salt.  OH, and I threw in a bag of frozen mixed veggies which made it a complete meal!

this has become a regular in our home. i also add a few spoons of cream cheese to make it a little creamier and add french fried onions (sometimes the cheese ones) mixed with shredded cheese on top. i add some frozen mixed veggies to get some extra nutrients as well. rarely any left overs left behind. thanks for the great staple.

My family loved the recipe!! I covered the meat with tater tots, so it evened out perfectly. It's definitely a recipe that I use quite often.

The ketchup really gives this a good flavor. I added 2 cups shredded cheddar and used two cans of soup, came out fantastic! I might add some garlic next time an maybe 1 1/2 cup cheddar, the tots kept sliding off due to all the melted cheese. I did try using French's fried onions the first time, big mistake, it tasted good but FAR too salty. Second time I used an onion and it was much better. Gotta love comfort food in the cold winter months. Everyone really liked this casserole, thanks for the recipe!

Good starting point - Used a can of mixed veggies (drained) and mixed a packet of stroganoff mix and a bit of water when I browned the burger. I skipped the ketchup, added a lot of tots on top and cooked ~ 40 minutes then topped with some shredded cheese and melted for a few minutes - my family liked it and so did I!

I added mixed peas and carrots to the beef mixture and topped with shredded cheddar cheese the last few minutes. I used a whole large bag of tater tots and cooked about 40 minutes so they could get crispy. Great recipe.

I consider myself a pretty good cook and this just wasn't a good recipe.  After I put all of the ingredients together, I could tell this wouldn't be a hit.  I have 3 boys ages 7-10 and they didn't like it either.

this was last nights dinner and the 4 of us ate the whole thing!!  i made some changes but i think the basic idea of the recipe is excellent and it's easy to tweak to taste.  for our preferences, i subbed cheddar cheese soup with a half can of milk, and added peas and corn.  soooo good comfort food that isn't really all that bad for you (comparitively speaking!!)

4 Stars as is, 5 stars with changes.  I added a 16 oz bag of frozen mixed vegetables.  We prefer ground turkey and it substituted great.  Yum!  Oh, and make sure you have plenty of tater tots, it's the best part!

Couldn't decide if I wanted to put ketchup, or BBQ sauce in...so I put both, and threw some chedder/jack cheese on top (gotta have cheese). After my husband took his 4th helping, I asked if he wanted me to make it again..."yeah, it's pretty good, tastes like hamburger helper with tater tots on it". And there you have it

Great flavor, loved by the whole family. Keeping the tater tots on top during cooking keeps them from getting mushy; I've tried it both ways and keeping them on top is my preferred method.

I'm from MN-the land of hotdish casseroles. This is exactly how I remember the church lady's Tater Tot Casserole..this recipe is now a keeper at our house. Last time I added corn to get some veggies in there for the kiddo and used the smaller tater tot "bites" or something like that which made the tater tot part a lot crispier.

Not great.  The only part I enjoyed were the potatoes.  Too much beef and it had a weird texture.  Also, it was pretty bland.  It need much more seasoning.

I was skeptical that the kids would like it, since they don't like anything.  But my oldest really liked it.  I am very pleased with the way this turned out.  I too omitted the ketchup and added shredded cheese to the top.

My husband said "I thought this was going to suck, but it is good", I add some seasining and extra worcestershire sauce because I used ground venison instead of beef. I also added lots of cheese. We will eat this again.

This is a great basic recipe, but what I did is use a pie plate and cover the bottom with the tater tots, add meat mixture to the top, cook. Top with cheddar cheese then bake a few more min to melt the cheese. Yum!

Flavors are wonderful, however we all agreed that proportion of meat to tater tots was a little high.  I think another time I will use half the meat and add some veggies in place of it.  Reminds me of a creamy shepherd's pie.

Mom made a variation of this when growing up!  Just sprikled a little shredded cheese on top and added a little more Worcestershire sauce for a kick.  Also, added chopped olives to the beef while cooking.

This was good but I like spice it was too bland for my taste.  The kids loved it.  I think next time I might cook my tater tots a bit before putting them on top, mine ended up soggy.

I followed this recipe almost exact except when cooking the hamburger i seasoned it with pepper and garlic salt for some more flavor. also i added a can of corn and shredded cheese to the bottom ingredients, i also covered the whole dish with tator tots and added shredded cheese to the top of them.  i cooked it for 12 mins at 425 then added the cheese for another 5-7 mins. it was great. me and my boyfriend loved it and will make it again.

It was pretty good, I added peas to the hambuger.  I added some shredded cheese on top of the hamburger mixture and put a full layer of tatter tots on top.  My hubby loved it.  I thought it was "ok".  I'll make it again because he liked it.  My five year old said it was really good except for the gross stuff on the bottom (the hamburger and peas).  LOL She's picky though.

*Much* better version of Tater Tot Casserole. Count on Campbells kitchens to tweak it in the right direction. Only addition was a light sprinkling of cheddar on the top of the tots and a little milk to make it a tad easier to mix.

This is such a great dish! I did make a few changes and wouldn't change a thing: I didn't add any ketchup. I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup so it wouldn't be too dry, I added a can of drained french style green beans, sauteed mushrooms and then before putting on the tater tots, I layered the top of the meat mixture with Velveeta slices and topped that with french fried onions and then put the tator tots on top. Yummy!

In the mood for comfort food I made this. I did not like the flavor of the ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. That’s a matter of taste, next time will cook hamburger with more vegetables and add cheese and milk to the sauce. I also like to add red pepper flake to things like this which seems to perk up the flavor but forgot to. It is a good recipe, you just have to make it the way you’ll like it:)

I added two slices of cheddar and two slices of pepper jack cheese under the tater tots. Before adding the cheese, I did add about a 1/2 cup of milk.

What a great and simple recipe.  I added half a can of sweet whole kernel corn and a little cayenne pepper.  It was awesome.  My daughter loved it.  I’m making it again soon.

I add another 1-2 lbs of hamburger, a bunch of cheese (I don't measure...just add what I'm in the mood for) and melt that with the hamburger once it's browned, and I add a bag of frozen cut green beans that I mix in right before putting in a 9x13 baking dish, then layer the tater tots on top. The green beans turn out nice and crisp and have that fresh out of the garden crunch to them instead of turning to mush. Even my 10 year old son loves this and asks for it as his birthday lunch and supper every year.

I would make this again, it was a crowd please. But I made a handful of changes.  I baked the tater tots separately until they were fully cooked and crispy. There's nothing worse than a soggy tater tots.  School lunch, anyone? I also added more ketchup and Worstershire. I didn't measure it. Just tasted it until I liked it. Assembled and then also topped with a bunch of shredded cheddar. Baked until cheese was melted.

It seems weird that I have four adult kids and have never made this. I followed advice from others and crisped up the tots in the oven while the meat was cooking and added some onion to the ground beef and everyone loved it. I will definitely make this easy dish more often.

I felt I needed to add more meat. So, the next time I used 2lbs. of hamburger. We love to use tater tots to in meals instead of real potatoes of some other starch.

There were 2 changes I made.  One  was to use a different product(instead of the Cream of mushroom soup) that was gluten & lactose free. Our daughter-in-law has health issues with dariy & gluten and this adjustment was just the trick!  The other was to add a can of yellow & white corn, a can of green beans & a can of peas & carrots for vegtable content in the hot dish.  It was a huge hit! This recipe is a keeper with these adjustments!

I used sausage instead of beef. I also put shredded cheese on top (pre-cooked tots on bottom) and let it brown.  Sour cream is really good on top! Leftovers are great for breakfast with some scrambled eggs!

Very easy to make and my husband loved it.  I doubled the recipe and added minced garlic and a can of drained peas.  I also had to cook it for about 40 minutes and I broiled it for a couple of minutes before serving to brown the tater tots.

This was great! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I changed a couple of things: I added fresh sliced mushrooms, and also mixed in some cheddar cheese as well as put some on top of the tater tots. I also covered the entire casserole with the tots rather than just around the outside.  I will be 100 percents making this again!

This is a really good base for tater tot casserole I just added my own seasonings (salt, pepper, parsley) to a mixture of sauteed onion  and garlic, and beef. I then added the ketchup and Worcestershire sauce, stirred, added the soup (cream of mushroom with garlic), cooked it another minute, spread in pan and layered with the tater tots, cooked 25 min in preheated 425 degree oven, added shredded cheddar, returned to oven and cooked for min to melt cheese, hit broil- 3 more minutes. I had to use a 9x13 pan so it was a little flat but tasted amazing! Very filling, fast, easy, adjust the servings and feed a crowd. If you need a lot of flavor to your food I don't suggest leaving out or cutting down on any of the ingredients or seasonings (except garlic if you're not a big fan). I'm a garlic lover so this was just how I liked it.

I added garlic, onion, and green pepper to the meat. 1/4c milk to sauce mix! Combined all with a partially thawed bag of mixed veggies and bag of sharp cheddar cheese! Added season salt, pepper, and no salt steak seasonings! Sprinkled season salt on top of tots and baked till golden bubbly and brown!

Was really really good with strong flavor. Never had a casserole without cheese though. A little cheddar on top may be a nice addition.

I added a tablespoon (+/-) or so of milk as other reviewers mentioned, which I deff recommend... and I also didn’t use ketchup, and added onion powder since I didnt have an onion on hand. The only other thing I changed is I put tarot tots lining the entire top (1 layer) & topped with cheese 1-2 min before pulling from the oven

After reading what others wrote, I decided that I needed to make some changes to spice up this recipe to my liking. I only used 1/2 of a red onion and cooked it with a little garlic, salt & pepper. I decided to omit the Worteshire sauce and ketchup altogether. I did use the can of cream of mushroom soup, and I added a can of creamed corn and a small can of diced green chilies.  It still tasted bland to me so I decided to spice it up even more with black pepper, celery salt, paprika and red pepper flakes- to taste. To finish,  I melted a  little chedder cheese on top at the last minute of cooking.

My fiance loved it! He said he could eat the whole pan. I think it was very easy to make, delicious and super filling! A great weeknight meal.

I make this for myself because it freezes and reheats well. I use barbecue sauce (Stubb's Original) instead of ketchup and Campbell's Roasted Garlic Cream of Mushroom soup. I add salt, pepper, and oregano (because it's my favorite spice.) Also, I use Alexia seasoned potato "puffs". I used the whole bag, covering the entire top of the casserole (9x13 pan.)

Made it last night for dinner. Everyone ate it up, no leftovers!! I doubled the recipe and added extra tater tots on top so it wasn’t all mushy. I also added dried chives to the casserole, and seasoned the meat with garlic and season salt. Used about half

Added some chopped bell pepper to ground beef while it browned along with a couple sprinkles of garlic powder. Covered entire bottom of 9x13 with tots, then meat mixture and topped off with thin slices of Velveeta.
Absolutely delicious!

I make this for the grandkids.  They like to help make this.   We've made this several times and like it as the recipe states but recently we tried a taco seasoning in the meat and used a cream of poblano soup that I get at my local HEB store.   Very good.  I will do the same again and maybe add a few hatch green chiles next time too.

Classic recipe, comfort food at it's finest! I altered it a bit and added some mushrooms and garlic when browning the hamburger and onions. Next time, thinking of maybe adding a little soy sauce.

I made this for the first time ever today, and it was a hit with my kids. Even my youngest, who had three helpings. And he's one of the pickiest eaters I have encountered. 

I modified the recipe a bit, and added shredded cheddar cheese (in between the meat & tots layer), a mini can of drained peas, some crumbled cooked bacon (I had some leftover, so I figured why not), and I used two cans of cream of mushroom soup instead of one. It seemed a bit dry with only one after mixing it all, so I added another one. 

I did use about 1.25lbs of ground beef instead of 1lb, and I baked it in a 13x9 pan for about 40 or so minutes, until the tater tots were crisp enough on the outside.

I will definitely be making this again. It's tasty, easy to make, and inexpensive.

Loved this!  I cheated a bit...  I had some frozen precooked taco meat. Made it very quick & easy. Didn’t add any spices since it was already “taco spiced”. I also used some cheddar cubes since I had it on hand already. Worked well. Also put it under the broiler for a short time to make sure the tots were browned. Yum!!!

So I used this recipe but wanted to share my own alternative method as we have an allergy to onion in our house.  So I use all the same indoors ingredients but the onion and the mushroom soup as most canned soup has onion in it I have had to learn to make a lot of things from scratch. So what I do is dice mushrooms and cook the mushroom in 4 tbs of butter on the stove. Add a beef bullion cube. Then Brown the hamburger in the same pot. After the meat is brown i use 3tbs of flour and cook it into the meat for about 3 minutes to cook starch out and then add 2 cups of mlk slowly and bring to a boil once thickened I add frozen mixed veggies,  worchshire and ketchup.  Then put together the casserole my boyfriend basically eats the whole pan to himself over the course of a couple of days

We love this. We usually triple the recipe and make in a 11x14 glass pan. We also don't add ketchup.We also add 3 cans of soup when tripling the recipe,plus 1/4 c milk and 2 T of Worcestershire sauce to the soup mixture and 8 oz of sour cream then mix together. We add 1/4 c dried minced onion and 2t of garlic powder to the hamburger when it is cooking. We then mix the soup and hamburger add a thin layer of cheese ( 1/2 c) then add  about 1 1/2 lbs of frozen tater tots and add a layer of shredded cheese  (1 c) to the top and bake at 425  degrees for 30-45 minutes.

Very good recipe. My husband loved it. I made a few additions. I added 1/2 cup sauteed mushrooms, 1/4 c each of sour cream and cream cheese, 2 garlic cloves, grated and sprinkled the top with grated cheese 10 min. before it was done. I also used tater rounds that I browned partially, before covering the top of the casserole .

I don’t see how it could be bad. I added a veggie mix of peas and chopped carrots. The sprinkled cheddar cheese on top. Had a turkey and dumpling soup I made yesterday in the crockpot on the side. Great idea.

I rarely ever write reviews anymore, but I had to for this one because you really need to make changes in order for it to have any semblance of taste, sorry to say.... but with the changes others have mentioned, it is actually quite good! I used Cream of Chicken soup because that is what I had on hand, added a can of drained french cut green beans, and a can of drained corn, and then followed the recipe up until adding the ketchup and worcestchire sauce... I added both according to the recipe, tasted it, and then realized I needed to double it because the taste was so bland. Then I realized it needed something more, so I followed another reviewer and added 4 oz of cream cheese (cut up & melted into the ground beef) and a small container of sour cream (thank goodness I had both on hand!!), some salt and pepper, and then BOOM! It tasted so much better. I sprinkled an 8 oz bag of shredded cheddar cheese underneath the tots, and then covered the top full of tots... I baked for 35 mins to get the tots nice & crunchy, and then added green onions after taking out of the oven. I brought it to a New Year's Eve get-together, and the guests wanted to take all the leftovers home with them!! So with changes, this is a very nice recipe, very simple to do, and very filling as well.

Great comfort food!  I added some garlic powder, green beans and Velveeta slices to mine. Will make again when I want something fast and easy.

This is just like the tater tot casserole my mom made for us kids growing up.  After I made it, I asked her if she made it the same way and she said it's the same except for the ketchup.  I couldn't really taste the ketchup, but it was a delight to eat so it wasn't a bad thing adding the ketchup.

I followed the recipe as written, except I topped the casserole with shredded sharp cheddar cheese, five minutes before finally removing from the oven.

I will definitely make this again.  My husband enjoyed it, too.  I don't have any kids, but I know from experience that kids also like this!  It brought back good memories.

Thanks for the recipe.

I had never had Tater Tot Casserole the first time made this. I. Am. Hooked. I added frozen veggies to it and I double the recipe because I’m feeding 5 and one is a teenaged boy. I halved the ketchup because my husband can’t stand the taste. It’s still amazing. Thank you for posting!!

Next time I’ll use more than a pound of beef.  Probably 1.5 pounds with canned veggies and cheese.  That will make it more hearty.  All in all it’s good, but not great.

Made this twice.  The first time I put cheddar cheese on the top per ALL the other reviews.  EWE!  I'm from Wisconsin and add cheese to many dishes, but in this case the cheese does absolutely nothing expect add calories.   Even my kids said the cheese and creamy sauce do not go together.  I threw the leftovers away.  My husband wondered if others were using american or velveeta cheese instead.  IDK, but we didn't like it at all.  But that's not the recipes fault, it was my own for following reviews!
The 2nd time I used venison, added a big bag of frozen mixed vegetables, added a second can of mushroom soup, threw in some leftover mushrooms and used enough tots to cover the top.  Then after it cooked through I put it under the broiler to make sure the tots were crispy.  Ever bit was eaten up.  Again not exactly the recipe, but I think the additional ingredients in the sauce make this recipe stand out.

Omitted the Worcestershire only because I was out. Added broccoli. Family really liked it. I thought it was just okay. But since they liked it, I will add it to our 'Family Favorites' folder!

This is a great recipe, my family loves it. I do add a little garlic to mine, some onion and milk and butter. I do not add the ketchup but my family likes me to melt some cheddar cheese over the top.

Endlessly customizable!  Change soups, add vegetable, change meats--this can be different every time you make it!  We have a mushroom hater in the house, so we use everything but, and it's still delicious every time.  
Make it healthier by using ground turkey and adding quinoa, make it with cheese soup for the two legged mice in your house (I have several of them).  The possibilities are endless.

Definitely not gourmet but good comfort food on a cold night. I put the meat mixture on the bottom, then layered the cheese so it didn’t burn, then put the tater tots on top so they could get crispy.

Great recipe for something that transported me back to childhood.  I added a can of corn, because we love corn.  And I made the whole thing, from stovetop to oven, in a 12" cast iron skillet.

I made similar changes as other reviewers.  The base of the recipe is excellent and makes for a quick and easy dinner.  If you have extra time why not make subtle changes.  I added a bacon and green onion topping along with a small amount of cheddar and some corn in the hamburger mix.

Very easy to make and great for when you are pressed for time.     I added a pinch of garlic to the ground beef and onion mixture while cooking.   
Also added a bag of frozen veggies and a dash of cheddar cheese.  Will  definitely make again.

My son loved it,  I learned a lot from just this first time.  Add veggis,and more tots to give it some better textures.  I used turkey burger, but would try other meats, thought it was a little bland and salty,  but the core recipe is a winner!  Fast easy, usually have all the ingredients on hand! !  thanks, Linda

I made the recipe as written and thought it was good. The fact it's also a quick, easy and cheap weeknight meal definitely bumps it up another star. My 10-year-old loved it. Will certainly make again.

I made it and it turned out awesome and so yummy. I'll be making it again sooner than later in the near future.  But I did add little garlic and I added just a little bit of catsup. Plus, I added shredded cheese on the very top.  So all I know is that my hubby is wanting me to make it my way again.

I made this last night and my kids actually cleaned their plates - they rarely do that with a 'new' dish and my 7 year old asked me to make it again tonight! haha The only change was I added some veggies and sprinkled cheese over the top about 10 minutes before it was done.

Added 1 can cream of chicken soup, in place of mushroom as it  was on hand, and a can of corn.  It was good but maybe a bit bland for me so added1/3 cup mayo, 1/4 tsp celery salt, & a 2nd tsp Worcestershire . Definately good comfort food!

We are vegetarian and like our food spicy and I have made this dish several times.  The only changes that I made were to add chopped celery, a jalapeno, and chopped colored peppers to the onion/ground vegetarian hamburger mix.   I then added a cup of shredded cheddar cheese to the mixture and sprinkled some paprika on top before cooking.  I broil the dish for a few minutes after it is done cooking to brown up the tater tots.  Delicious and great after freezing to take camping too!

Good hearty recipe for a quick  easy dinner very popular here in the Northwoods  make mine with 1  1/2 lb of ground meat  and good sprinkle of garlic powder along with salt & pepper to taste, also add 1/2 can milk to my mushroom soup to  keep casserole from being dry &  add a good 1/2 cup  or more  frozen mixed veggies (microwave a few  minutes in oven first to soften) or a small can drained  mixed vegetable's before topping with the potatoes I sprinkle top with shredded cheese  when hot & bubbly then slip back in oven to melt cheese

Easy to make but wasn't very good. If I make something like this again I would leave out the Worcestershire and ketchup as that's the part that was off to me.

This is always popular, especially with kids. Easy to make, and inexpensive. For the picky kids that don't eat potatoes (they exist, believe me) I call it "cheeseburger casserole."

Like I do with most recipes, I used this as a template and added some things to make it my own. First, I added orange bell pepper and minced garlic with the onions for extra flavor and texture. I also used golden mushroom soup instead of cream of mushroom and added a dollop of sour cream. It made it more like a sweet and sour rather than creamy. I also seasoned the beef with garlic salt and pepper because that's just what I do no matter the recipe.  I smothered it in grated cheddar after it was finished and left it in for a couple minutes to melt. My kid devoured it. That's the best part. It was really really easy and really really good.

Delicious!!  made a few slight changes based on other reviews and personal preference that just enhanced it, not really changed it. Used cream of chicken soup, doubled ketchup and worcestershire, sprinkled about a cup of shredded cheddar on top of meat and covered top with tots---YUM!! whole family gobbled up

I made it and yes it is quick and easy, but it wasn't a big hit here at the house. To simple I think.  I did of course add salt/pepper to the beef for some seasoning and even did add some shredded cheese on top of meat but under the tots which I scattered all over.  First time I ever made a Tater Tot Casserole, if I do again, I'll try another recipe.

Made a double batch and the platter was empty at the end of dinner (we were feeding 5). I did not have worcestershire sauce and it was good without it but will definitely add next time. Added about 1/4 cup of milk to the soup to make it creamier. Adding this to our meal list!

I did like this recipe a lot.  But I added a layer of cheese on top.  I do not have Worcestershire sauce in my household pantry, so I just skipped it.  I didn't add any seasoning  or onions because my kids will not eat them.  It turned out good and made the crowd happy.

I did sub the cream of mushroom with cream of chicken, I will never do that again. I have made this in the past and we loved it. I also add a layer of shredded cheddar cheese on top of the soup mixture. And omit the onions and use seasoned tater tots for more flavor.

Pretty good. Used a shallot instead of Onion, because we like shallot's better. Sweeter. And used less. Also, used a gluten free, celery free cream of mushroom.

I will definitely make this again! Followed the directions mostly, except I added approximately half a bag of frozen peas and carrots to the beef and onion mixture and used coin-shaped tater tots instead. I also baked for an additional 5 min to make the tater tots extra crispy. I sprinkled some sharp cheddar on top. Finally, I used McCormick pub burger seasoning to season the ground beef. So good! Will need to double recipe next time though!

I made this exactly as written, with the exception that I almost exclusively cook with ground turkey. My kids love it. I've made it several times, and now I don't measure the ketchup and Worcestershire, so it usually ends up being more than a tablespoon of each. I cover the entire top with tater tots. I have added cheese, as some reviewers have suggested, and it is yummy that way too, but I usually forget.

My mom made this when we were kids and I always remembered loving it.  My husband is such a picky eater and I was running out of ideas for dinner.  So I thought I would try this as an adult.  He absolutely loved it, and requests it once a week.  And Its so easy to make.  I add a can corn to the meat mixture and top it will about a cup of cheese about 10 minutes left of cooking.   Made it without cheese too and its still good, but we love cheese our house so we prefer it with some! without the add ons I give it 4 stars, but 5 with the add ons!!

Great base recipe.  As I read some if the reviews, specifically those critical of it, i am forced to wonder if some of these peiple have any ability to read a recipe and make adjustments to their own tastes.  Here are soe of my variations:  use 1/2 of the onion called for and replace the reminder with green onions just before the beef is completely browned.  Another variation:  use a small can of mushroom soup and a small can of cheese soup.  3rd variation: the addition of a bag of frozen mixed veggies is great!  ALSO, adding shredded cheese to the casserole in the last 5 minutes is a no brainer!  ENJOY!

Omg this was so yummy, the whole family loved it!! I doubled the recipe added chopped garlic to the onion,  thawed green beans and corn to the meat, and topped the tater tots with tons of mixed cheese.  So so good, my boys cant wait to eat the left overs tomorrow.

My children loved it!  However I wasn't a big fan over the taste. It tasted like lunch lady food that's probably why my kids love it. I did add an extra can of cream of mushroom soup as others had suggested and shredded cheese. Overall I will add this to my recipe rotation.

Love this but for a change up I only added 1 can of crm of mushroom soup, but along with adding 1 can of French cut green beans, I added a drained can of diced tomatoes, peppers and onions for a little more "kick" as my family tends to like things on the spicy side. Turned out great!

Made this the other evening, added some garlic powder before browning the meat, while the meat was browning I added peas and carrots for more flavor and added shredded cheese before baking. Best meal I've had since leaving the Navy.

This is one of those recipes that's good in a pinch because we often have these ingredients or substitutes on hand!  We don't eat meat so I used Beyond Meat (an excellent choice) and Cream of Asparagus (our favorite) and I also added some frozen corn. I think you can add any veggie. Corn just happened to be what I needed to finish from the freezer. Ketchup didn't sound good with this cream soup so I omitted it. No Worcestershire in our pantry, but Bragg's liquid aminos and some liquid smoke made the meat/soup/veggie mixture taste delicious!  The casserole baked at 425 for 20 minutes and then I added shredded cheddar and baked for 10 more minutes. Absolutely ideal. The cheesed up tater tots were crunchy and the mixture beneath still creamy. A good, easy stick to your ribs dinner.

It's good base, but needs some help.  I add garlic, bell pepper, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper.  I also add 1 pound of frozen mixed veggies that I microwave a few minutes to thaw and start the cooking.  I don't like the sweetness ketchup adds, so I use a can of diced tomatoes.  I brown the meat and mix everything in my cast iron skillet (or any oven safe pot) for an easy clean-up, one pot meal!

Made this the other night. It was great. I added cream of celery soup and some peas, corn and green beans to bulk it up a bit. Also put some french fried onions on top. Finished off with cheddar cheese for the last five minutes. Mmm mmmm good! We will be making this again.

We tried this tonight and LOVED it. My son doesn't like cheese so just my husband and I sprinkled cheddar cheese on it and we would rate it a six! It is easy and super good! I went heavy on the ground beef and tater tots to make it bulkier.

It was alright, easy to make and such. I prefer the Tater tot casserole II recipe which seems to have a little more "jazz" to it. Still not too bad though.

This is pretty good- My husband and I both liked it and would eat it again. I did add a can of corn and cheddar cheese, and I had to cook it longer than the directions called for. Not something I'd make for guests, but definitely a good 1lb of ground beef sort of dinner!

My first time having a tater tot casserole and I am a fan.  I did add a can of cream corn and a touch of milk to make it more creamy.  And some grated zucchini just to use it up.  I added some more tots on top to add some crunch like other reviews said.  It's a simple recipe, so making little changes to make it your own is easy.

The kids loved it.  We used more than 3 c. of tater tots -- we wanted to cover the entire top.

The ketchup and Worcestershire sauce make this a GREAT recipe.  For a long time I have been looking for a recipe that adds more to my normal tator tot casserole recipe. I added some water to the cream of mushroom so it isn't so thick. I also added salt and pepper. My very picky 11 year old liked it and that does not happen often.

Just made this tonight and it was yummy. My pickest eater had three helpings! The only thing I change was to mix the tater tots in with the meat mixture before baking. Thanks!

MMMmmm brought back memories from my youth. SOO simple and yet SOO delicious! I use corn in mine also, adds a touch of "sweet" and a little more texture. Mom always adds beans to hers also, so its all up to your taste. But recipe as written is fabulous!

Yum!  This recipe is a fantastic, quick dinner that can be modified in dozens of ways.  I followed the advice of previous reviewers and swapped hot sauce for ketchup, then because I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce, I used between 1/4 and 1/2 cup of cooking sherry.  I also added a few handfuls of peas, and shredded cheese over the top.  I'll definitely make this again, and will continue to experiment.  Great recipe!

The traditional favorite! I had to make sure to chop the onions finely.  I also just used as many tater tots as needed to cover the other ingredients.

I gave it 4 stars as I like to jazz things up and this seemed a little too simple. I added shredded cheese to the mixture as well as some garlic and onion powder which are staples. I mixed in the hasbrowns and used left over ones to line the edge. I also added crushed triscuit crackers on top for some crunch. Yum! A great basic recipe that's easy to add things too!
