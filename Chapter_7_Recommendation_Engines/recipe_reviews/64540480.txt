I asked on the Allstars forum on FB what to use with some crab stuffed ravioli that I bought at Sam's Club.  I made this with just a few substitutions.  I didn't add the crab and I used real cream and real cream cheese.   I didn't have fresh herbs, so I just used some dry.  This needed quite a bit of salt so the directions to add as needed were perfect.  I would make this again, for sure.  It made enough that I can freeze half for another meal and that was just perfect for us.  Thanks so much for posting your personal recipe.  And thanks to who recommended it on Facebook.  Cindy
