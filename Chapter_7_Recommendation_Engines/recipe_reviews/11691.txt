This is probably one of my favorite recipes from this site! I have made it more times than I can count. You really want to use quality ingredients for this. Use fresh, red, ripe tomatoes, as the flavor is just something you can't get out of a can. Use a good olive oil. Fresh garlic. I always use dried basil but I'm sure fresh basil would be great too. I also sometimes splash in just a little bit of sweet balsamic vinegar (about 1/2 - 3/4 tablespoon). It really gives this dish a unique flavor. I absolutely love this one. It is so light and delicious. Thanks so much. :)

I'm not sure why the tomatoes are boiled in the first stage.  If it is to peel them - cut a cross on the bottoms and place in a bowl of boiled water and leave for 1/2 a minute or so.  Pick up with a fork and peel the skins off easily. Otherwise it is a reasonably tasty spaghetti - needs a little more flavour though.

I just made this and had to rate it right away.  This is fantastic!  I didn't have any parm on hand so i omitted it.  i was concerned that w/o the cheese it would be lacking in flavor, but it is not at all.  I was looking for a recipe to duplicate something that i had at a restaurant and this matches it exactly.  (of course at the restaurant it cost $18 rather than the $3 to make it myself!)

This is a great recipe, especially if you have fantastic tomatoes and plenty of fresh basil. If you are lacking in the produce department, add some mushrooms for more flavor. Here's what I did: I sauteed 8 oz of quartered crimini mushrooms with the garlic until they released their juices, 2 to 3 minutes. Then, I added a 1/4 cup of dry white wine and cooked over medium-high heat until all the liquid had been absorbed. I followed the recipe from there, adding the tomatoes and pasta. It turned out great and the mushrooms really made up for my less than perfect tomatoes.

This was delicious!  I think that I had a definite advantage using garden fresh tomatoes - they have SO much more flavor than the store bought tomatoes!  I also doubled the garlic and laid off of the olive oil - it really doesn't need so much.  I tossed it with garlic and parsley fettuccini and it made for a very healthy, easy and delicious dinner.

This is a nicely flavoured, quick and easy recipe to make.  In the winter, the tomato paste is a good idea as fresh tomatoes tend to be tasteless. However, in the summer, I would definitely omit the paste, as it would interfere with the fresh taste.  Fresh (not dried) basil is a must.  My store didn't have it but the the frozen type worked well.  I added a splash of white wine to the recipe when I added the tomatoes.  Half the olive oil could also be substitued with butter, which gives a beautiful rich flavour.

I've been putting off making this recipe until I could get decent tasting tomatoes from the store. I added a little more garlic, and I also cooked the pasta using the 'Enhanced Spagetti' method from this site. It turned out absolutely perfect! I can't wait to make it again with fresh homegrown tomatoes. Thanks!

Yum, this was good. It has all the components I look for in a dinner type recipe: It is cheap to make, quick to put together, healthy, and taste pretty descent. The changes I made was using 1 Tblsp of olive oil to saute the garlic in. I misread it should be more. I also used, 2 15oz cans of petite diced tomatoes for the 2lbs of prepared tomatoes. That saved so much time and dishes! Since canned tomatoes have salt I didn't add any and I don't care for black pepper, so I didn't add any of that either. I don't have fresh basil, so I just added a pinch of dried. I find it to be really strong. The ingredients list doesn't mention it, but the recipe says to add 2 Tblsp of olive oil to the cooked drained noodles. I think it was neccessary for added flavor and so they didn't bunch up, but blend in with the sauce. The angel hair pasta was the perfect type. It made 4 generous servings. ty

This is delicious, easy to make, and I feel so healthy when I have it! I always use whole wheat angel hair pasta and add a dash of balsamic to the sauce per another reviewer's suggestion. Wonderful!

This is a great recipe. Use only fresh tomatoes, score bottom of tomato with X and place in very hot water and then in ice water, this will make it easy to peel. Increased recipe 4lbs tomato, 6 cloves garlic, 3 tbsp of basil, 3tbsp fresh parsley, 8 oz can of italian herb tomato sauce, 2 tbsp tomato, paste, 1/4 cup of white wine, 1 pkg of red peppers(we like spicey). Can add shrimp. The use of all the fresh ingredients makes this recipe great! I made this for a family dinner and had to cook more pasta because the first batch was all gone.

I make something very similar to this all the time. I don't use tomato paste, and I use whatever pasta I have hanging around. Thanks for posting an official recipe of it. I love this stuff on a busy night.

I was tempted to give this a 3 star rating but I think I am possibly at fault for some of the results I had.  I made this a week ago and am just getting around to rating so my  memory isn't serving me too well when it comes to the proportions I used.  I think I may have used too much pasta because I think this came out way to dry for my tastes.  I was disappointed because I love the flavor of these ingredients so I thought I would be much happier with the results than I was.  Maybe will try again.

Truly amazing!! However, I used whole-wheat spaghetti (12 oz package), minced garlic (in a jar), dried basil, and a bit extra tomato paste. It turned out great and my brother (who doesn't particularly like spaghetti) said it was really good. I used fresh tomatoes, too, and it was GREAT!

This "alla checha" recipe is excellent and a favorite. I especially like this recipe because of the technique described in Step 4. Do it this way. It really makes a difference. I usually add more fresh basil and, if it tastes a little sharp because of the paste, I add a bit of sugar. Like someone else said, use good olive oil, good tomatoes and fresh basil. I usually use thin spaghetti instead of angel hair because it is a bit easier to handle and hold up better. This recipe is excellent.

AMAZING!!! It tasted better than at the restaurant I oredered it from the week before. Perfect to make in the summer when the tomatoes are so sweet. I did not add the tomato paste because I felt the tomatoes were sweet enough to stand on their own. I'm so glad I didn't use it, however, in the winter I may because the tomatoes aren't as good. My entire family ate it up and the kids were begging for seconds, and thirds! I also added an extra clove of garlic because we love it. Very good, so fresh! This recipe is a keeper.

I just made this recipe for dinner and my family loved it.  I added sauteed mushroom and hot sausage to the sauce.  I used store bought vine tomatoes.  Delicious!

This was a good dish, it just wasn't as flavorful as I was hoping for. Even with all the spices, it seemed to be lacking. Still good, though.

We really like this recipe. It's a nice light pasta. It's definitely worth it to use fresh tomatoes.

Made this to take to a picnic and the vegetarians really liked it. I didn't use as many tomatoes as called for and should have. Will do so next time. I'm actually think of making it again tomorrow, this time tossing in chunks of pan-seared zucchini. :)

This was very easy and delicious.  I think roma tomatoes give the sauce the best flavor and texture.  I doubled the garlic, because we love garlic.  To save on dishes, carefully lift your tomatoes out of the boiling water and toss your pasta in to cook.  We used whole wheat spaghetti, because that's what we had on hand, and it turned out really well.

Let me start by saying that my husband is Italian and is the designated sauce maker in this house.  That said, occasionally, I venture into his territory as I did with this recipe and it is FABULOUS.  I first found this when I was planning my New Year's Eve dinner party and wanted a pasta course that was simple and delicious - amazing.  Since then, I've made it many times (and it's only March!) and I'm giving it 5 stars even though I haven't even been able to make it with fresh tomatoes yet. The only additions I made were about a teaspoon of dried basil and dried oregano into the oil when the garlic is cooking (the smell is AMAZING.) Considering it is winter, the tomatoes here look pretty paltry and I'm getting rave reviews even with high quality canned (San Marzano work well.) I can't wait to try it with fresh.  Anyway, if you are looking for a simple and delicious pasta, where the freshness of the ingredients can shine through, you've found the only recipe you will ever need.

Fantastic recipe!! Absolutely love this one. We were blown away by just how good this tasted - and it's so light and summer-y! We only made one change - added about 100g of chicken breast for added protein (didn't want to use anymore chicken as it would overpower the tomato flavour).

This was so good! I added half a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar, a couple of dashes of garlic salt, seven garlic cloves, and one and a half tablespoons of tomato paste. I accidently put a pound of spaghetti in (WOOPS!) but it was still soooo good that everyone had seconds and even thirds!

This was great. I used a fork and roasted the tomatoes over an open flame for about 20 seconds each. Much quicker way of peeling a tomato, just make sure you warm the entire tomato.
My wife and 7 year old son loved it. We are going to use the left over sauce to make personal pizzas.

Even though this recipe seems very time-consuming by peeling and dicing 2 pounds of tomatoes I bookmarked it anyway, figuring somehow I'd get around it.  I did.  I used 2 cans of Del Monte diced tomatoes already seasoned with basil, oregano and garlic and drained them before adding to the skillet.  I also used 1/2 tbsp of dried basil instead of 1 tbsp of fresh.  The meal wasn't bad, but I didn't think it was great.  My husband liked it more than I did.  I will admit that my shortcut methods probably made it less delicious.  Still, it was quick and easy to make.  I may make it again (still using my shortcuts) if I'm in a hurry for dinner.

This is delicious and SO SIMPLE. I always think that the more ingredients something has, the better it is...so I was reluctant to try this. But, I decided to give it a go based on the great reviews it received. YUM!! I must say, it's absolutely delicious. I used about 5 cloves of garlic and less olive oil as others recommended. Try it, it's so simple but SO GOOD.

I've made this several times now. And they always came beautiful and delicioso! I've tried to add some zucchini, jalapeños and they were gorgeous! I used baby roma tomatoes and didn't bother to peel them, plus i didn't add tomato paste and still it was awesome!

Awesome recipe! Not every dish has to be bursting with complex flavors. Sometimes light and simple is the most satisfying and tasty! This is such a lovely dish as written, but just as easy to tweak to your liking. Add grilled chicken, shrimp, or veggies of your choice. Sautéed mushrooms are a nice addition as well. Just a great, delicious, versatile dish! Oh, one thing I do not do is add olive oil to my pasta. I find the other ingredients slip right off of the noodles if I add it. I just drain the pasta and add the other ingredients and they "stick" to the pasta much better this way.

This is a great quick dish. I make it all summer with tomatoes and basil from the garden. Sometimes I add zucchini or peppers if I have them on hand. 
My whole family loves this dish!

This is absolutely fabulous. The only change I made was to add some chopped onion to the garlic (personal preference). Otherwise, it is perfect as written. Will make this over and over again. Everyone loved it!!! It sounds really simple, but the secret is in using all fresh ingredients.

Quick and easy dish. Tasted better the night I cooked it than as leftovers. I used Feta, which added a different twist to the traditional parm and was quite good.

I used canned tomatoes since I didn't have any fresh on hand.  I also added fresh basil and rosemary right before serving it, and it was delicious.  Great concept to play with if you have other fresh herbs to use up as well.

This was so delicious!  Since I didn't have any tomato paste on hand, I used a lot of Prego spaghetti sauce instead.  The garlic was perfect... it made the pasta taste better than some dishes I've had at restaurants!

There's nothing tastier this time of year than fresh tomato sauce and this one is one of the easiest I've come across.  It's loaded with flavor!

This was a wonderfully fresh, quick, and easy meal. Great garlic flavor and the fresh basil really makes it.

Unfortunately, my tomatoes were not as sweet/ripe as I hoped. But, I followed the advice of another reviewer and put sweet balsamic glaze (not to be confused with balsamic vinegar) on top and it was awesome. The parmesan and balsamic glaze really took this dish to the next level.

I made several improvements to this good recipe.
1. Boil water in a medium skillet. With a knife, cut a cross in each tomato, dump into boiling water : it takes 1 min. for the peel to come off. A great time saving over  the current recipe;
2. Do not crush garlic and saute it : cut instead every clove in two and get rid of the green or white germ, which is what makes garlic less digestible. Hash garlic and keep aside (covered by plastic film to preserve its aroma). No need to saute it, as it quickly takes a less pleasant odor and taste.

This was fantastic! You really DO need to use fresh tomatoes in this recipe. It makes a big difference! It would be great, too, if you added some shrimp!

I love this recipe and have been making it for years with varying amounts of olive oil and butter. I totally agree that fresh garden tomatoes make this dish "to die for".  I like the idea of adding tomato paste since winter tomatoes don't have much flavor. Very light and tasty dish.

Made this recipe many times and it's always a perfect pasta dish, exactly as served in Italy.  Quality ingredients treated simply.  There is nothing to add to this recipe to make it better.

This is the simplest and best place to start when it comes to making fresh pasta toppings. Variations include: 
Adding some nice peppers. Fresh or fried, Hot or sweet.
add some sun dried tomatoes
Toss the pasta on a bed of spinach
Top with some gorgonzola 

Well you get the idea

This was clean out the cabinets and refrigerator week I had all the ingredients.I added a splash of balsamic as someone recommended,it woke up the flavors a bit.I also added extra garlic.This was served in pasta bowls,with a green salad and garlic bread making it a standout meal but not too complicated.

I do not cook much at all and this was super easy to make. I love that everything is fresh and its good as is or would be great with grilled chicken. That's what I plan to add the next time I make it.

This is such a delicious dish! My husband said it was a keeper. So I made it again this week! It's so much more flavorful than any other marinara sauce that I've ever made! I think this is going to be a "traveling" recipe for my family! Thank you!

Just made this for dinner.  My family of five ate it but no one said it was good and my husband asked for the salt which he never usually does (indicating the lack of flavor).I used all fresh, ripe ingredients. Sorry but I won't be making this recipe again.

Great; light with plenty of authentic flavor. I substituted puree for the paste; I've found that the paste has a harsh flavor that you must overcome; not so with puree. You have to use four times as much, but you will be rewarded. The less you simmer the sauce, the fresher it will taste. still the simmering thicken the sauce - you pick it - what you smell is the flavor leaving the sauce. (Options: a small amount of well shopped onions will sweet the sauce as will pureed carrots).

Really good- I'm a garlic junky so I put at least 15 whole cloves in it which gave it extra flavor.  I also added a bit of oregano.  My whole family enjoyed this dish!  I had some veggie thin spaghetti from Publix that my kids didn't even detect, so a yummy, healthy dinner for all.  :)

Loved this!  I did not cook the fresh tomatoes - just cut and put right in at the end.  I used 1 1/2 lbs pasta and only used two large tomatoes and that was plenty for my taste. I will be making this again!

Light and refreshing.  I followed the directions exactly and blanched the tomatoes, but for me it’s totally unnecessary.  If you don’t mind eating the tomato skin, just chop ‘em up and toss ‘em directly into the skillet.   You’ll save yourself a lot of time.

So simple and has a nice flavor. The whole family enjoyed this. A nice, very basic pasta recipe when you are in a time crunch. I off course added and increased herbs and spices to make it more to my liking. But if you like a more simple sauce then stick exactly to the recipe as is.

This was great. I only gave 4 stars because I used canned diced tomato's and added some extra spices. I cannot wait to try with fresh garden tomato's. Thanks for sharing!

I loved it, my husband thought it was pretty good (he said it was missing something). I added some crushed red pepper flakes because we like it spicy. We used linguine pasta (it's what we had) and fresh tomatoes (I'm sure it's much better than canned tomatoes this way). Mmmmm! Delicious and tastes, to me, like restaurant pasta. I'll definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

I always add a bunch of extra tomato paste to thicken up the sauce and a good handful of parmesan cheese. So fast and delicious!

This recipe made for a very delicious meal, and preparing it - although a rather lengthy process - was fun too! I only wish I had garden fresh tomatoes instead of store bought, and I kind of wish I had used more garlic. We added zucchini to the tomatoes which was a great addition. I'm usually not a huge fan of tomato sauce on pasta but I'll definitely make this again.

Changed up the recipe just a touch. Added another tblsp of paste, and a few red pepper flakes and a vetetable seasoning a splash of balsamic vinegar. Only used olive oil to cook the tomatoes in. Recipe is a great base. Family loved it.

I thought this was a little bland, but I realized I left out the basil, no wonder!  Oh well, it was still good and just the way I like it!

Eh, this was just so-so. I think it could have used a few more spices... maybe some more fresh basil, oregano, red pepper seeds. Overall, very easy recipe. I might make again and add a few more things. Served with the easy pepperoni bread for a great dinner!

This is great.. I've made it three times in as many weeks. I do use extra garlic (about 6-8 cloves) and extra basil (because I use dried). I also use a lot less olive oil and parm cheese because it just isn't necessary to use so much. I've also made it with grilled chicken and crushed red pepper and that is wonderful too.

This was wonderful & easy to make.  I only had 
2-big tomatoes so I used a can of stewed tomatoes also.  Next time I will use more garlic & less
olive oil.

LOVE this. I know it seems simple/plain but it's seriously so delicious and quick. I use on the vine organic ripe tomatoes, boil the tomatoes until the skins rip, scoop them out into a bowl and add gluten free spaghetti to the water with salt. I usually add the basil in right after I add the tomatoes to the sauce and use extra basil with extra garlic.  Then drain the noodles, put the noodles back in the pot, add the sauce to the pot and dump 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese and stir. YUM! Thank you!

Loved this dish. It was light and fresh tasting somehow, but still filling...it’s pasta! Will keep it saved and use it again and again. My kids like a saucier pasta..but this was great for me.

This is my absolute favorite pasta dish!! It's so light,  fresh and flavorful and super easy to make. The recipe as is, is amazing but I like to add chopped zucchini and cook it in the olive oil for a few minutes to soften before I start the garlic. It make it a bit more hearty adds an almost meaty flavor. Definitely worth trying!

This was delicious..made a few changes.  I prepared the tomatoes about 3 hours before and put some salt and pepper and chile flakes along with some italian seasoning.  I left it  to marinate.  I also prepared some shrimp with garlic butter anf when they were almost done I put themin the sauce.  The whole meal was delicious.

Loved this quick simple delicious recipe.  Ok I did not have fresh tomatoes so I used Chef John's go to tomato for making sauces. San Marzano peeled canned tomatoes, I keep a stock pile of them. Other than that change I did it exactly like the recipe said. This is a keeper and I do recommend the SAN MARZANO's perfect fit.

SOOOOOOO good! To be honest, I did not prepare the tomatoes as the recipe says. I just chopped the tomatoes up and threw them in a frying pan. I also added some frozen haddock on top of the dish to add some more protein. Loved this recipe, will definitely make it again.

I dont normally like to rate a recipe unless I make it exactly as written. I did not have good fresh tomatoes so I used canned diced with basil and oregano. So I did not add basil. I also doubled the garlic. And added just a few red pepper flakes.  Very good.

We love this dish. I do adjust the recipe a bit. I add fresh parsley, fresh basil, fresh oregano and red pepper flakes when browning the garlic. I also use 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and sprinkle in a hint of sugar to reduce the acidity of the tomatoes. Adding fresh shaved Parmesan cheese and fresh basil when plated really completes the dish.

I just made the sauce. It has a really strong, straight tomato flavor to it, and that was after I added more seasoning to it. I even added sugar to it to try and make it taste like something other than tomato soup! It tasted better as a 'salsa' to dunk chips in than as a pasta sauce. Freezes well.

Husband and I both loved this.  Threw some shrimp in it but would have enjoyed it just as much without it.  Perfect meal for a summer eve.

I made this exactly by the recipe. I thought if I needed to make changes it would be the next go round! But no need, this was a
very delicious meal! I have never made spaghetti sauce from real tomatoes before, I've always used jar sauce for speed, I don't think I'll ever do that again! At first I thought it needed more seasoning, however, after letting it stand for a while waiting for the garlic bread to finish, the flavor soaked in. I will be making this a lot!

I have had this recipe saved forever, but just made it last night. One word....fabulous!  I really like garlic, so I added a bit more, but other than that the only thing I changed was to a whole wheat pasta. It will now become a family favorite when fresh tomatoes are available

As a few people said, it was a little bland, but for kids the taste was perfect. I think this would be best as a side dish to complement parmesan chicken. I'll most definitely make it again - I do suggest using Roma tomatoes as they're full of flavor.

Used a can a tomato paste and diced tomatoes to make this more of a spaghetti sauce - my kids prefer putting the sauce on spaghetti rather than having it mixed.

Quarter 8 oz crimini mushrooms and sauté 2 or 3 mins., just until liquid is released, before adding the garlic. 1/4 c Sherry or white wine and Italian seasoning required. To Skin a Tomato: cut a cross on the bottom, place in a pot of boiled water for 1/2 min. or so. Stab with a fork and peel.

This is a good recipe, but I must admit that I used canned tomatoes (1 crushed, 1 diced) and added onion and a jar of roasted red peppers (drained) to give it the flavor I prefer. I also included parmesan in the sauce and simmered for about an hour. Thank you!

Delicious!  I added some mushrooms to the garlic, added the peeled tomatoes and let it cook down.  Didn't need tomato paste as liquid released by mushrooms/tomatoes and some of the cooking water from the pasta plus the cheese made a nice light sauce.  Gave a good sprinkle of cayenne pepper - such a great dinner.

I made several mistakes (garlic brown & didn´t realize I bought pasta with no gluten)... still it tasted good to my opinion.

My husband didn´t like that much garlic, but probably is because of it becoming brown instead of opaque... will take care of that later time I try it!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was a big hit at my house. My daughter who is a picky eater went back for seconds. It was so easy to make I didn't change anything on the recipe I will definitely be making this again.

Love it! Sometimes I add bell pepper, onion, & cooked crisp crumbled bacon, as I love bacon! Good either way!

Tried this today. Tasteless. Sadly this recipe  does not work with standard " fresh" tomatoes (packed in plastic and chilled) available  in a supermarket in spring.

Being an amateur in the kitchen, this recipe is perfect for me. Very easy to make and tastes amazing. I made this last night and followed the instructions as listed but made a few ingredient modifications for what I had on hand:

-substituted the angel hair pasta with penne 

-added some mushrooms, bell peppers, onion and spinach

-omitted the Parmesan
