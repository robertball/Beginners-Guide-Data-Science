Very good and very simple!  Everyone loved it.  It looked like a little too much mayo as I was doing it so I cut back to about 2/3 cups.  Also mix the cream cheese and the mayo before everything else, really helps you to eliminate the lumps of cream cheese throughout.

Even though the cream cheese was soft, there were still globs - better to mix the cream cheese with the mayo first and then add the tomatoes and corn.  I reduced the mayo to 2/3 cup.  I also added sliced black olives.  Everyone loved it!

Made today for a party that I thought was my b-day party, it was.  Used 8oz cream cheese, 1/2-3/4c miracle whip.  Put in microwave for about 15 seconds and mashed with a fork to remove lumps and clumps.  Added 10oz can RoTel, 11ozs green giant mexicorn and 2 green peppers sliced.  Topped with 1/4c. shredded cheddar cheese.  It's really not too ugly but it sure is great!  Will definately make again and again!!!  Served with Fritos Scoops and all I brought home was the emply bowl.  My brother didn't even know it had corn in it (haha).

Made for my poker gals last month and was told if I didn't bring it this month I could not play.  LOL!  I used Rotel and sprinkled a little shredded cheese and green onion ontop to make it less "ugly".  :)

This dip is a keeper!  I made it according to the recipe...and it was wonderful.  Then, I added a few extra ingredients - sliced black olives and diced jalapenos.  I served it with corn chips (a.k.a. Fritos Scoops).  Easy to make and great to serve at a party.  Thanks for sharing!

The recipe wasn't as ugly as I thought it really to be...but however....it wasn't the best thing I ever tasted either. Matter of fact, it's not the worst, but I wasn't really pleased at all with this recipe after I threw the simple ingredients and followed the steps. All I could taste was soupy mayo with chunks. No kick of spice from the can diced tomatoes w/green chile peppers(Rotel), I couldn't even taste not one bit of cream cheese flavor. I'm sorry to say, that as written. It was not impressive or flavorful, it was bland as bland could get. However, if I had to make again...I'd cut the mayo in half and not drain the diced tomatoes. But I even took a suggestion from another friend to try and spice it up by adding chili powder and some taco seasonings to it. I sorry for giving this highly rate recipe a very poor rating. It just didn't have umph or flavor.

This tasted pretty good but the name says it all, it is pretty darn ugly!  Since it really doesn't look very appetizing not a lot of people tried it at my party so I had a ton left over.  With all of the wonderful dips out there I would skip this one and make a dip that tastes AND looks delicious!

I made this for my sons birthday party and the guests ate every last bit! If you warm up the cream cheese in the microwave for a bit, it mixed up very nicely.

This dip is amazing. It is definitely ugly and a little messy. It has become a "must have" at all family gatherings.

Yep, it's ugly but oh so yummy !  I almost didn't make it because I thought the combination was kinda strange.  It was a big hit at work so give it a try - you won't be disappointed !!

love this dip. better if you let set in fridge over night.  I also added a little sour cream and some mexican shredded cheese.  A few black beans would be good. I will try that next time.

I took this along with 3 other dips to a party this weekend. Everyone loved it. I creamed the cream chesses and mayo before adding the other ingredients and it wasn't ugly. I did have to prompt people to try it but they LOVED it!

I made this dip for a party last summer and had several requests for the recipe, even though I didn't mix the cream cheese and mayo very well (it really did look ugly). Tip: when you serve a cream cheese dish with chunks of cream cheese left in it, just call them "flavor bits" and make it special! ;-) Great flavored dip; looks great when you blend the cheese and mayo first, and super easy. A keeper!

I didn't think it was UGLY at all! (Actually relieved that it wasn't!) And very tasty.  I took it to a gathering and everyone snarfed it down. This is a good time to use the PRETTY and FANCY dishes to set the bland looking dip apart!

I used light mayo & reduced fat cream cheese and it was fantastic! My husband who distrusts anything that is presented as a "lightened" version raved about it!  It's true what Emma said:  People can't stop eating it!

This might not sound appealing, but with a corn chip, it's simply AWESOME! My sister in law made it and we couldn't stop eating it. I'm making for a summer party this weekend, we'll see what everyone says!

I recently made this for a party.  Several asked for the recipe.  It was very good and not ugly.  I did add black beans, sour cream and some jalapeno peppers.  Next time I will add more peppers because I like spicy!

Just made this for Sunday football and have to say that I'm surprised by the great reviews. This dip doesn't have much flavor and it does call for way too much mayo. I will have to try it with ro tel as others suggested.

I love this easy dip recipe.  I added a few other ingredients:  1/2 cup sour cream with a Tbsp of taco seasoning and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, can of black beans, sliced black olives and green chiles.  It made it a little more like a taco dip.  I think even shredded cheese would be good.   I served it with Frito's Scoops.

Not bad. Just make sure to soften the cream cheese before adding or it will be clumpy and won't mix in well.

My family literally scraped the bowl clean! I used half a cup of mayo and half a cup of sour cream along with the cream cheese, used 1 can of rotel and added 1 1/2 tablespoons of diced jalapeños. I also added a packet of taco seasoning and it was to die for!!!

I found this recipe several years ago and have made it many times.  Everyone always loves it and asks for the recipe. My alterations:  I always use 2 packages of cream cheese, and only add 3 or 4 spoonfuls of mayo, otherwise the mayo is too overbearing for our liking.  I also add a chopped jalapeno for an extra kick.  I have added the green jalapeno pepper tabasco sauce in the past also, and we enjoyed that as well. I think it tastes best when chilled a couple hours. Also, make sure the cream cheese is totally softened, and mix the mayo & cream cheese together before adding the other ingredients.

Love this recipe.  If you mix the mayo and cream cheese with a hand mixer it will have not lumps. I also put 2 cans of drained tiny shrimp in it.

This was a great, tasty dip!  I changed it a bit (as most people should or would) and used 1/3 lite, 1/3 fat free, 1/3 regular mayo.  Also, as someone else here did, and I tried it, too:  I added sliced olives.  I made my own mexican corn (didn't have any already made...) with regular corn and added (thawed) frozen peppers and corn.  I think I added some cumin, too.  Anyway, guests said it was a light and 'refreshing' dip.  I am making it again this weekend for our pool party guests!  :)
(Added thawed frozen peppers and onions, rather...)
