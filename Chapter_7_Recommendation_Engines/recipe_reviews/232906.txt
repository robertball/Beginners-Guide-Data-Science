This was exactly what we were looking for. This is a very simple recipe, with a surprising amount of flavor and just the right amount of spice. It was light and tasty. Used lemon juice rather than lemon wedges and was still delicious.

This recipe is easy and the spice combo is tasty! I used olive oil to make it dairy free.

I may have dusted the fish with too much of the mix, but in our house the cayenne pepper ruined the meal.  If you have to use it, I would suggest a small cayenne dusting, rather than adding to the mixture.  It's hard to ruin broiled haddock, but I did!

The spices really appeal to me in this recipe….I was looking to jazz up the haddock filets I had and this fit the bill.  For my own tastes I added a bit extra cayenne pepper and used half the butter.  Under the broiler my filets were done in 8 minutes with a nice slightly crispy edge… I look forward to making this healthy dish again.

Made this for dinner last night. Was the best fish I've had in years. My girlfriend doesn't usually like fish and she loved it. Said she would like to have at least once a week. Boom! I killed it as she said.

I would definitely do it again. I added a little celery salt. Unless you like it really hot I would cut it back to 1/8 tsp of the cayenne pepper but its definitely a keeper.

Everyone complained when I told them we were having fish for dinner . . . but I didn't hear a peep out of anyone and their plates were clean when I served them this! Delicious and a "do again" in our house.

This recipe was really good and quick to make. It is full of flavor, the next time I make it I will use less cayenne pepper and more salt because mine came out spicier than I would have liked. I will deff make this again it's a great simple recipe.

Made as written and it was perfect. Served with a side of roasted asparagus with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar which was a nice complement.

Really good.  Used the spices stated plus added Montreal steak spice to give the haddock a bit of crunch.  Do not overcook!

very simple and very delish.  A great easy way to make fish on a weeknight.  Had .79 lb. haddock but didn't alter the spice content.  tossed in celery salt as another reviewer mentioned.  my oven heats evenly and is true to temperature but the broiler (electric) never seems as hot as some others - took a smaller piece out at 9 mins and a larger at 12. Thanks Nicole! UPDATE: I really love this dish - lately have been serving it with Tzatziki - a perfect foil to the spicy haddock.  btw this same recipe did not work nearly as well with Halibut - not sure why but likely multiple reasons - texture being the main one.

Very easy to prepare this entrée. The taste was delicous and my whole family loved it. I already had haddock on hand and also all the spices so it was a quick and delicious meal to make. I paired it with pasta saute'ed with mushrooms, onions and grapeseed oil with a touch of butter.

I rinsed the fish with water before placing it in the pan.  I lined the broiler pan with foil and used oil vs. cooking spray.  I did not have cayenne pepper and omitted it.  I chose to use a heaping 1/2 tsp. of lemon pepper spice.  .  I used 2 Tbsp. of butter instead of 1.  We all loved it.

I had really thick pieces of haddock so I had to cook mine an extra 4 minutes for it to be cooked through.  The seasoning was great!  I loved it!  The rest of my family thought it was on the spicy side so next time I would either season it more lightly or cut back on the paprika.

I didn't follow the recipe all.that closely.  I'm cooking for my elderly mother and she can no longer handle spicy foods.  I omitted the cayenne and butter.  But we both still thought it was a good recipe.  I'm sure it would have been yummier with the butter, but  our purpose in eating fish is an attempt at a healthier diet.

Essay recipe and we like it very much, however, when I make it again I will reduce the amount of cayenne pepper it was just a little too much for our tastes.

Great way to liven up some plain haddock fillets. I used frozen fillets so followed the cooking instructions on the packet and added the seasoning etc half way through. I was extra careful to keep to just under 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne and it was the perfect amount of kick. Lemon juice worked great as a substitute. Quick and easy!

Super easy and super yummy. My 10 yr old even loved it. Spicy but not too spicy and full of flavor. I don't love fish but I do like it. Went back for seconds. Will make again.

Got quite a bit of a kick to it! I would make it a bit different and not  so much paprika! Other than that it was really easy to make served with a side of broiled broccoli and noodles

Simple, fast and flavourful. The only substitution I made was lemon juice due to lack of fresh lemons. Otherwise I made exactly as directed. I will definitely use this recipe again.

The title says it all. Extremely simple to make. The only tweak I made was smoked paprika, and added a minute to the cook time. Excellent!

Delicious! Easy to make. I omitted the cayenne because I was afraid it might be too hot for my taste. I’ll try it next time.

Good, but needs more spice! I didn't measure (never do), but it definitely needed more cayenne!  Also, I added a tad bit of basil (yum). Then I fried it up for 5 minutes on a side over medium heat. I guess it was more blackened than baked, but it was fantastic. Love Haddock! Wish we could get more of it down here.

This was REALLY good but way too spicy for my personal liking so I'll just halve the paprika and cayenne and pepper and should be fine! I also added 1/2 teaspoon of flour ( gf) just to get an extra crunch. Will probably never favor another way!

We really liked this simple but tasty recipe.  The only thing I'd change is the amount of cayenne pepper.  It was too hot.  Other than that, I'll make it again for sure.

Quick, easy, and zesty! Made it twice, once without cayenne and once with, and both were great! All depends on how spicy you want it.

I omitted the paprika and cayenne pepper.  I also didn't have a fresh whole lemon to cut in wedges. This was a last minute no time to run to the store night. The fish came out delicious! My 14 year old who "hates fish" said that this was the best fish he ever had! Will make it again.

Just delicious! Hubby loved this dish as well! Probably a bit too spicy for little children, Howe if you cut the cayenne pepper out, I’m sure it would be just fine. I’ll definitely save this one to my favourites!

I made this on salmon the first time, and haddock the second for fish tacos and baked the fish at 375 C for 20 mins and 350 C for the haddock for 20 mins and both times the fish came out wonderfully. Think I found a keeper. Even my meatatarian husband gobbled them up.

Made it a couple times this is a nice seasoning , use it sparingly cause I find it strong which could mask your wonderful fish.

First, let me state I am not a fish person. I have never liked fish that much and if it tastes fishy I absolutely can't eat it.  

Having said that and trying to adopt a healthier lifestyle I confess I've made this three times in the past few weeks and again making it tonight. To me, Haddock is a very mild tasting fish. I followed the directions exactly with the exception of using olive oil on the aluminum foil. I did cut back the cayenne pepper by approximately half since I don't have much tolerance for spice with heat.

I absolutely love this recipe. I can have dinner on the table within 30 minutes which includes making rice with steamed asparagus. The flavors are clean and I find this absolutely delicious. 

I'm so looking forward to my broiled haddock tonight.  I cannot believe I'd ever say that about fish!  I'm a convert now, I simply can't believe it.

Quick, easy, and delicious. Cooked it 8 minutes. Didn't have any lemons so I used a little lemon juice sprinkled randomly over the fish.

I like things hot and found the cayenne pepper to be okay for me, but I believe it would be too hot for the average person.

Simple, healthy and delicious  !
The only change I.made was to up the spices little to have enough to sprinkle on both sides of the fish. My fillets were big, they were done exactly in 8 minutes.

I made this exactly as written and it turned out fantastic! Nice mix of flavor with the onion and garlic powder with  a bit of heat from the black and cayenne pepper and a touch of smoke from the paprika. I'll make this again. I think  I'll try this spice mix on pork chops, I think it would work perfect for that protein too.

Nice recipe. Definitely quick and easy. I removed stars due to the amount of cayenne pepper.  White fish are known to exhibit very delicate flavors and in my opinion, the heat from the cayenne is slightly overpowering. I'd also skip the butter until the fish cooked 4-5 minutes then I'd brush on melted butter and return to the broiler for 2 minutes or so. It would allow the spices to cook into the fish and the butter won't have enough time to burn.  It's hard to give exact times to cook as everyone's oven is different as is their freshness and type of spice. Experiment!

Great combination of spices that really jazzed up the flavor of a sometimes bland tasting fish. Even my hubby loved it.

This dish is FANTASTIC!!! So easy to make and it was a total hit in our house. I cut way back on the cayenne pepper as recommended by others, but the flavour is fabulous and the fish was super tender. Will definitely do again.

This is one of my favorite recipes. The broiling technique is so quick and the fish cooks beautifully. I make this often and I use various seasonings depending on what I'm in the mood for. The seasonings in the recipe are great but it's nice to be able to just sprinkle some lemon and thyme or Old Bay. Makes it even easier! I'm sure any seasoning you like will work.

I prefer to grill on the BarBQ rather than oven broiler, so I followed the recipe with most of these spices (that I had) with a light vegetable oil before the spices, on both sides.

I followed the recipe exactly other than sprinkling both sides of the fish with the seasoning.  I wouldn't change anything. Cook to the lesser side the Haddock will be dry if your not careful.

used season salt & mccormick's garlic pepper instead of the spices- OMG it was the best.  I usually do the baked haddock recipe & love that- but was looking for something a little different.  I'm not a big fish eater- but was looking for more.

I liked this a lot, but the Y-chromosome types deemed it "meh". Compromise rating is a 3 (I'd have given 4). Good pairing with Lyonnaise potatoes and sautéed Brussels sprouts. Unfortunately, at $14 a pound, "meh" isn't the reaction I can accept.

I LOVED this dish, and only changed adding less pepper (and no cayenne pepper), as other reviewers have suggested.  Even my picky non-fish loving hubby liked it.  I've been afraid to cook Haddock, because I've heard it can dry out and be terrible, but the timing was bang on on this.  Thanks!

Fresh and flavourful. I loved this because it was so quick and easy to make! I had all the ingredients on hand and it turned out delicious! Will be a go-to healthy lunch recipe from now on.

Turned out great though I thought it was slightly too peppery. I added 1/2 teaspoon of dill weed to the mix and a teaspoon of Old Bay instead of the salt, and next time I'll swap out the black pepper for lemon pepper which is a bit softer.

Very quick, easy and flavorful! I've never eaten haddock before and was pleasantly surprised at how lite and tasty this dish was. Followed the recipe exactly and will definitely make this again.

I made this for dinner this evening, and quite enjoyed it. I used fresh garlic and omitted the onion power, because I don't stock onion or garlic powder. I found the spice rub to be very suitable for the fish, we did end up using twice the recommendation. The broiler was the perfect way to prepare the haddock- it was flaky, moist and very tasty. The spices did not overpower the fish, which is really important when we are dealing with such a delicate flavor. It was quick and easy to prepare, and we will be doing it again!

It was well received at the guest table. I would use low broil in the future rather than Hi. Going to try it again a week to perfect it. Taste was very good and easy to do. Try it and you will like it.

Loved it. I often find haddock bland, but this spice mix added great flavor.  I followed others' suggestions and added 1/2 teaspoon of celery salt and cut the cayenne to 1/8 teaspoon. I took out the thinner parts of the haddock at 6 minutes and the rest at 8 minutes and it was perfect - very moist.

The flavor of this fish was very good. I used salted Amish butter, but very sparingly, and replaced the cayenne with a hot paprika. The only problem I had was that the fish was slightly overcooked. The close broiling took the fish from 110 to 175 in about 4 mins, which was my mistake for not monitoring more closely. For my taste, this resulted in a drier, overdone fish.

I followed this recipe but forgot to serve with the lemon wedges.  It did not matter.  This is the best fish I have ever eaten.  I am not a fish eater at all.  This was so good even I wish I had made more.  This is a game changer for eating fish for me.  Can't wait to make this again!

Quick and easy. A little too much heat for our taste, but I wonder how it would be if I used smoked paprika sans the cayenne?  So far the best recipe I've found that my husband liked too.

I am not a fish person but this broiled haddock was GREAT! I did cut back on the cayenne pepper like some suggested. I only used a pinch...literally, a pinch. I also used olive oil to coat the fish instead a cooking spray. Please give it a try you won't be disappointed.

This was great. Surprised me because I am an amateur professional home cook. Simple to make yet satisfied the pickiest of eaters. One that always has something negative to say no matter how hard you try.  This, not a word was said but, that was good. WOW, thanks.

The spices are great. I just pan fried the seasoned haddock in butter and my husband really liked it. I also used the same spices on salmon patties. They were great with salmon, too.

I will make this again but next time I will use less cayenne pepper.  It was too tangy of my nine-year-old ,who generally likes flavorful food.   Quick and easy preparation though, so I will give this four  stars!

I was looking for something simple, low calorie,  that wasn't my typical (boring) baked haddock that this busy mom could whip together on the fly. This is it! Loved the heat in the seasoning blend! Loved the crust on the fish from broiler. Loved loved.
My comments: 
Swapped butter for Healthy Balance Spread.
Only broiled for 6 minutes and fish was just overcooked. I'll  check fish at 4 or 5 mins next time to avoid overcooking. 

Thanks for this  fun twist on traditional seasoning!

Good stuff! I added some parsley and substituted garlic salt for garlic powder and salt.

Needed a bit more seasoning for my tastes, but outside of that this recipe worked very well.  I love fish, and haddock is one of my favorites. Broiling is a nice and quick way to cook it, as long as you're careful not to overcook.

Great basic recipe.  I made just as written and would make it again.  My very picky husband thought it was just okay, but the rest of the family loved it.  Can't be beat for ease of preparation and cooking time.

This recipe was just what I needed, I love Haddock but found it too bland, the spices in this recipe were perfect  for my lo-carb diet, really enjoyed this, Thank-You!
