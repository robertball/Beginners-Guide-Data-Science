I made these for a party and there was an empty plate by the end.  Everyone loved these and I wish I had doubled the recipe.  Unbelievable easy to make and delicous and they freeze very well.  The only change I would make would be to add a little more filling to each rugelach.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.....and I passed it along to all those who were at the party.

I was afraid these were going to be too sweet, but they were perfect!!  I make the recipe exactly as written but without the orange marmalade.  These are more like a pastry than a cookie.  My daughter who normally doesn't like nuts or raisins loved them!!  She suggested I try making them using chocolate chips...This might work with chocolate chips, coconut and walnuts...hummm???  Thank you for a great recipe, Sandy!!

I can not say if these are the best since I've never had them before but I truly liked these.  Since I didn't have apricot jam I used strawberry preserves and black berry preserves.  They were delicious!!! Don't try making them bigger... they unfold! Oops.

I found this recipe some time ago and sound good so tried it today but wish I had read the reviews first. Flavor was good but next time I will put them close together so that the syrup doesn't burn. I made them just as recipe suggested.  Glad to hear they freeze well as can't eat them all when fresh to many for just the 2 of us

These were tasty, but much of the filling leaked out and burnt onto my cookie sheet.  After breaking off the burnt filling and arranging them attractively on a plate, my husband and his family devoured them.  They haven't had them since they sold their condo in Florida where they would eat them frozen and fight over who at who's piece(s).  For the record, I tried them frozen and thought it was decent, but weird.  I'd much rather eat them at room temperature, but to each his own, right?

I thought the recipe was fairly good, but definitely warn that you want to be sure to *fully* cool them before packaging. I also agree that the filling might have been a bit much - it definitely spilled over a lot!

A great recipe! I did not use the marmalade, only the filling. I made the dough the night before and woke up the next day, rolled them up and baked them. I did not use the marmalade, only the filling. The dough was very easy to roll out too! The crispy texture was perfect! Thanks for the recipe! Iâ€™ll be adding it into our yearly cookie baking line up!

Thank you for sharing this recipe. It's really good, crust is fluffy and not that sweet.
