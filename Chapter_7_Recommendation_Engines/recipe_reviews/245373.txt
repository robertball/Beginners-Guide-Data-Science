I made no changes and it was good. I think next time I will cut back a bit on the honey and it will be perfect for me.

Delicious and so easy to make! I made it exactly as written and the flavors were perfect. I did have to add a bit more milk because my blender wouldn't blend the frozen fruit, but then again, I don't have the best blender! Thanks for the tasty recipe Malanie!

I loved this recipe; this is perhaps the best smoothie I have ever had.  It truly does taste like a milkshake but all you put in it is healthy ingredients. Kids loved it.
