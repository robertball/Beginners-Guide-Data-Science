Really good! I think stirring the potatoes in the garlic-herb butter is what puts it over the top.

Great pizza though we followed the boxed pizza mix instructions instead of the recipe. We loved it, but the kids didn't find it appetizing. It does taste so much like a fully loaded baked potato!

I forgot to mix olive oil in dough, still was good. There was so much of sour cream and ranch mixture, didn't use all on crust, but decided next time to put the extra on top if potatoes to give them more flavor. Can't wait to make it again!

I use scratch dough when making pizza, my wife and I love baked potatoes and I wanted to give it a go. Outstandingly delicious, although I felt I didn't put enough ranch sauce on so we just dipped it the leftover while eating. so good

other than using bacon bits  and Walmart pizza dough, I followed the recipe.  perfect seasoning on the potatoes makes this pizza.  I make brunch for my church and it was a big hit there

We love this version of pizza!  A great change from the normal.  So good and not too much extra work if you just cook the potatoes in the microwave.

So good. We lightened the amount of onions a tad because not all of our family cares for onions. Will be making this again for sure.

Plan extra time to make it. Our potatoes took a long time to cool before the next step.

Cheated and used pizza dough from the local bakery.  Then I accidentally peeled and cut potatoes before cooking. Easy fix is to put potatoes in single layer in a shallow dish, add spices and two tablespoons of water, cover and microwave for 2 min, let stand for five.  Great as is.

I was looking for something similar to what I used to get from a place in Mpls, and I finally found it! To cut down on the prep time, I bought a pre-made pizza crust, as well as bacon crumbles and I microwaved the potatoes on high for 5 min on each side until tender. I also added broccoli and chopped tomatoes. Delicious!

Yum!  If you ever had Green Mill baked potato pizza that they no longer make, this one is very similar.  Very fun and different way to make pizza.

This was fantastic! I have been looking for a recipe for Baked Potato Pizza for years after having it at a place in uptown Minneapolis. I made my own crust and next time I will add a few more slices of bacon, just because I love it. Otherwise, this recipe needs very little tweaking. It's great!

I love this recipe. I omitted the green onions and it turned out great! I lovethe idea of tossing the potatoes with the seasoned butter. I will definitely make this again.

I LOVE THIS! If you like loaded baked potatoes, then you should like this. Just make sure the crust is cooked well. Mine could have been cooked a bit longer, but was still wonderful.
