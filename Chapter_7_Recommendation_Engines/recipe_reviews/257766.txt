Simple and straight forward and just how a burger should be. I only wanted two burgers so I halved the amount of ground beef yet used the full amount of steak seasoning  and it was perfect. So on that note, I recommend doubling the amount of steak seasoning the recipe calls for. I used to buy the Montreal steak seasoning at the store but now I just make my own to have on hand. The recipe is on this site and it is called, " Authentic Canadian Steak Spice, Eh?"
