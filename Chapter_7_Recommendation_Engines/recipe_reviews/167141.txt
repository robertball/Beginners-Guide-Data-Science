I didn't use the cake mix -- I made the cake from scratch, so I guess I'm just rating the jello and cool whip topping.
The jello made these SO moist.
We used blue jello instead and topped with red sprinkles for the 4th of July.
YUM.
light and wonderful.

I just had no luck with these cupcakes!  I love jello cake so I was so excited at the idea of jello cupcakes but it just doesn't work out very well.  The recipe does not say anything about the cupcake liners and whether to remove them or keep them on the cupcake...I wanted to use them as a birthday treat for my daughter at preschool so I thought I'd need to leave them on.  I poked many holes in the cupcakes, to the point I was afraid I was tearing up the cupcake, but my jello only soaked into the cake about 1/4 inch!  The rest of course ran down and was all over the cupcake wrapper on the outside.  I drizzled it very slowly with a spoon but it almost can't be done slowly enough to not get mess on the wrapper!  Then it makes them so moist that they fall apart so easliy.  My girls, 2 and 4, tried so hard but made such a mess with them...definetly not a good idea for my daughters preschool class!  Then of course the jello in the cupcakes left red on everything it touched...yikes.  Great, great idea but not practical once executed.  I'll stick to jello cake with the whipped topping frosting, it is wonderful.  On a side note: one way to make jello cake even easier is to use a store bought Angel Food cake.  Just break it in to chunks and put them in a 9x13 pan, prepare the jello as directed and pour evenly over the cake. Allow it to a soak in a minute or two and then put it in the fridge to set.  Frost with Cool Whip, so good!  Wish the cupcakes had worked, would have been fun!

The cupcake came out fantasic I made them for my 5yr olds birthday to take to school. The tricky part is knowing when to stop adding the jello mix. Less is more and if like me pouring with the spoon part is too tedious; poke the hole on the cakes as usual and dip the TOPS only in the jello mix and it works like a charm.  thanks for the recipe!!
