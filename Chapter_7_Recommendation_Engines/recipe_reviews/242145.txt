We loved this!  It was so simple to get together and the pesto worked perfectly with the salmon.   I do think a drizzle of fresh pesto at the end would bring out the flavor even more.   I prepared exactly as the recipe stated, but, I broiled the salmon instead of grilling since it was a drizzly day.   I will definitely be making this one again.

It was good. Just as a personal preference it wasnâ€™t my favorite taste for salmon
