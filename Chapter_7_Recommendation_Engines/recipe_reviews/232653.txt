I love the ingredients here but felt the balsamic needed jazzing up. Instead of using it alone, I mixed up a basic balsamic vinaigrette by adding some olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, and a touch of sugar. The flavor was great. This is a wonderful healthy option for grilled steak.

This was better than I thought it would be, but not as good as I had hoped.  I followed to the letter, with the exception of using a balsamic glaze instead of a straight balsamic vinegar.  Definitely needed that last bit of oomph to bring it over the top, but still, very, VERY good!

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I did add more seasoning to my steak (as I usually do) and I added a good sprinkle of salt & freshly ground pepper. It actually made for a tasty, light dinner with almost no effort.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  It took very little time together and grill, so it makes for a quick and easy weeknight meal when your short on time.  I found the addition of the balsamic vinegar added a nice sweetness to the steak, off setting the lemon-pepper seasoning slightly.  Like another reviewer mentioned, the addition of the balsamic does wilt the lettuce a bit and turns the mozz brown, but I waited until the steak was done before I dressed the baby spinach.  The heat of the steak and naan also caused the spinach to wilt, but no-one in our house minded at all.  Will definately make this again!

I didn't love this recipe. I was expecting it to be so much better. No matter how good of a brand of balsamic vinegar I have used I find it slightly tart and that the main problem is, it just turns vegetables and cheese brown in color. It appears with the topping on this it was no different. It also wilted my spinach and it sat for a very short time, while I carved the meat. The main pic for the recipe, I believe the ingredients were added in layers and not mixed together. Only change I made was using a little dry basil, as I did not have fresh. I found the basil flavor too dominant as I do fresh basil in many recipes. It just didn't come together for me and was rather time consuming for such a simple looking recipe.
