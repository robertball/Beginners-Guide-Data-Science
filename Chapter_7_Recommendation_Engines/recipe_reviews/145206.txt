These are so good!  I have made them several times and just can't get enough of them.  You can decrease the amount of oil...1/4 cup is enough - I will try less next time.  I also added more flax and chocolate chips. They are so yummy!!!

I changed quite a bit. My son is allergic to peanuts so I used almond butter instead of PB, apple cider vinegar instead of white, 2T soy margarine and 1T flax oil instead of canola. I also used 1 C oat flour and 1/8 C pastry flour in place of all purpose flour. He's allergic to corn so I used my home-made baking powder. With that said, these are the MOST AMAZING CUPCAKES I'VE EVER HAD!!!!! The smell was incredible, they are light and fluffy and just oh so delicious! They are a bit sweet, but that's perfect because I didn't ice them. Oh man, these are fantastic! Prepared as I have it's only 150 calories per cupcake. These are fantastic and will become a weekly treat around here! My poor kid, it's nice to know that I can still give him a yummy treat!! Thank you so much Caiti Ann for this superb recipe! :)

Very good, especially once cooled.  Perfect for a snack or on-the-go breakfast.  I used regular milk instead of soy, creamy peanut butter, and added mini chocolate chips.  Muffins were moist and needed no frosting.  Next time I might add some rolled oats for extra interest.

I made the recipe exactly as is, but left out the honey because it's not vegan.  I thought these were good.  They tasted healthy, but still satisfied my sweet tooth.

they were a little on the dry side, but i take total responsibility for that. I used apple sauce instead of oil and i only made a batch of two. It actually worked! I recommend this with some chocolate frosting!

I made this with crunchy almond butter and they were delicious! My toddler devoured them. Do u think I can use creamy PB??? That's all I have at the moment.

I made these cupcakes last night, and they fell apart completely when I tried to take them out of the muffin pan. They simply crumbled into delicious dust! They tasted amazing, but I believe more flour is required in the batter. I made half the batter in a 6 cup muffin tin with no success. For the second round, I added more flour and got better results, but they were so very dry. Something is off here, but I didn't know exactly how to fix it. I recommend using paper baking cups, at the very least. Don't trust a greased muffin pan on this recipe.
