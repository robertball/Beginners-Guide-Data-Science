This is a fabulous, easy and refreshing recipe.  It is perfect for a summer meal!  I did reduce the amount of mayonnaise suggested, and I found it better to let everyone add the cashews individually as they were served--that way the cashews don't get soggy IF there is any salad leftover.

As is, this recipe is barely servable. The citrus dressing is completely overpowered by all the mayonnaise. All I could taste was mayonnaise and oil.  Not a good combination. This recipe does have possibilities but definitely cut way back on those two ingredients.  Everything else is so flavorful, why add so many bland ingredients to it?

I think this would be just wonderful as written but since I use "real" mayonnaise, I cut back on both that and the olive oil by 1/2. Additionally (and rather than OJ), I quartered 4 naval oranges, cut 3-1/2 of them into pieces and squeezed the juice from the remaining half in the dressing. I used red wine vinegar, but possibly should have used balsamic.I didn't serve on lettuce leaves (no one ever seems to eat them); rather, I tore up 6 pieces of Romaine and, using my blender, incorporated them into the mayonnaise/oil dressing). I didn't see any reason for the orzo (IMO, it neither enhanced nor detracted from the salad) so next time I'll just leave it out. I didn't see any reason for the orange zest, either (rarely do) so I just left that out this time. I didn't have them so I didn't include the cashews. But since I can see how those could definitely "enhance" I'll be sure to have them on hand next time. I had the grapes and they were delightful, but (when they're not in season) I can see how raisins or prunes can be substituted). I can only imagine how adding scallion tops and/or chives could further enhance this salad.

This salad isn't bad but it needs something--don't know what.  I did cut way back on the mayo as suggested.  Since my husband liked it I'll try again with some changes.
