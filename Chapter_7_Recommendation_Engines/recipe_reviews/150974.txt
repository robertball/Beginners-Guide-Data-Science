I am cooking-challenged, but this is so easy, delicious, and beautiful even for me!  I feel so proud when I bring this to a function and everyone oohs and ahs at how pretty it is.  And then they taste it and can't believe how good it is.  The yellow star and the red garland made from bell peppers are just gorgeous on here.   

I like to stick the rolls in the freezer for a couple of minutes before I open the can and slice them.  It helps the rolls stay nice and round when they're being sliced.   

You can make the rolls into the shape of a big heart for Valentine's Day, and use red veggies like bell pepper & tomatoes, and even add some red food coloring to the cream cheese mixture to make it really Valentines-y.  And you can do the shape of a pumpkin for Halloween parties and use carrots and orange bell peppers...

I took this to a Christmas party and everyone LOVED it.  I modified the sour cream/cream cheese mixture by adding 1/2 packet of ranch dressing mix to it and leaving out the dill and garlic.  It really adds a nice flavor.

Made recipe as listed....and loved it, but...

If you love a garlic/onion taste, keep recipe as is.
If you want it a little milder, to please a more diverse crowd, I would halve the dill, and ease up on the garlic.

Also, I will definately try freezing the dough for a few minutes before, which was suggested in a previous post. The cutting was a little difficult and sloppy for a beginner..


Otherwise..no complaints!!

Always a hit!  Instead of 2 trees I sometimes make one large one.  Bake top half on one cookie sheet and bottom half on another.  Also good with herbed cream cheese.  I do not use the dill.

I made this beautiful appetizer for our Family Christmas Party.  It was a huge success, everyone was wondering about different ways to make it for other holidays.  My only tip is to start by adding finely chopped broccoli add other veggies and end with finely chopped cauliflower, it really gives the appearence of snow on a tree.

This is a very easy recipe and it looks great when presented. I have recieve many compliments. The only change that I make is omitt the dill weed and garlic powder and instead mix a packet of dry ranch dressing with the cream cheese and sour cream

A huge success at a get together!  I made a single tree, so just halved the recipe.  Also added more garlic and dried onions.  Made the dip the night before so it could season.  Delicious!

This was a big hit at a cookie exchange that I hosted.  They now sell crescent rolls sliced into spirals as called for in the recipe.  Great idea!

I made this last Christmas for my family to nibble on Christmas Day among a few other appetizers. This one was by far everyone's favorite and it was actually fun to make. I plan to make it again this year.

I took this to a work party and not only did it get great reviews for flavour but it was the only show stopper there!  I did one very large tree on a foil oven liner.  I used Philly whipped herb & garlic cream cheese and multi colored peppers, finely chooped heart of celery and green onion for decorations.  I put another large cookie sheet underneath to transport and it held up perfect for the trip!

This is such a great recipe.  Sooooo festive - going to have to make every year now.  Took someone else's idea and used a seasoning packet of Ranch dressing mix to throw in the cream cheese and also used garlic flavor crescent rolls.  Was a hit!

this was good, although i thought is was going to be bigger.  also disappointed that i "shared" from the recipe to get a coupon but never did.  i also used the dry ranch dressing, not a big fan of dill.

A hit on my holiday buffet!  A great appetizer that is both visually terrific and yummy for everyone.  It's easy to pick off anything you don't like (16 grandkids at my Christmas celebration) and comes together quickly.  A tip:  use pre-cut veggies from the supermarket salad bar to save money (buy only as much as you need!) and speed prep!  Thanks for a great idea!

For making this from a crescent roll, I thought it is a little time-consuming. Plus, the cost can go up when all of the vegetables are bought. The cream cheese spread had a nice flavor. I even used some of the leftovers on crackers and it tasted good. The only thing I changed was using 1/2 the dill. I noticed, with this recipe, it is either one that people don't really try or they can't stop eating it. Note: this recipe makes 2 Christmas trees.

Loved this recipeI  I used very small cherry tomato halves, broccoli flower tips, baby carrot circles, tiny cucumber wedges, yellow/red/green bell pepper squares and a bright yellow Cheddar cheese star at the top.  One thing is to use quite a lot of veggies for coverage that looks colorful.  If you cut your red bell pepper along the curves, the 'garland' looks very cool!  I subbed garlic flavored spreadable cream cheese only because I had it, but I sprinkled the dill weed very lightly and sort of randomly over the whole tree once I got the veggies settled where I wanted them.  There were only a few people at the party, but it was all gone, fast!

This is by faar the EASIEST appetizer I have ever made and just as big a hit as some of the more time consuming ones.  Very tasty...only thing I changed was that I used Chive and Onion flavored cream cheese and decided to forego the dill weed.

This is such a great idea!  I made it for my holiday party and it got rave reviews.  I had to convince people to eat it at first, though, because no one wanted to touch it since it was so cute!  It's really easy to make, too.  I used the cresent rolls that are pre-sliced in wheels so that makes it even easier.  I like the suggestion of other reviewers to put some ranch dressing mix in the cream cheese mixture.  The only thing I changed in the original recipe was that I halved the dill.   Thanks for a great recipe!

This was so yummy and so pretty.  Everyone loved on Christmas night.  Hardest thing about making this was the star on the top of the tree!  I added a tad bit of lawry's seasoned salt to the the cream cheese and think it added a nice element.  Give this a try...it is so easy and so impressive!  I put some of the leftover pepper slices around the trays as garnish.

What a great idea!  I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and everyone really enjoyed it.  I've often made a similar recipe but I personally liked this cream cheese mixture better and I loved having the tree shape for Christmas.  It was a hit with my family.

This is a stunning hit at a holiday gathering.  Since I ended up making six of them this year, I found that the best thing to do is press each round a little flatter before placing in the tree shape.  It gives you a bigger tree, and the crust isn't as thick.  I also use onion powder instead of garlic powder.

This is a wonderful recipe.  It was the first recipe that I learned to bake on my stoneware.  Every year I make this for Thanksgiving and Christmas potluck and there is never any leftovers.  But I never thought to do fun shapes.  Also sometime I sub fat free cream cheese and everyone still loves them. Have fun picking out you favorite fresh veggies for this dish. Anything goes.

Tasted OK, but didn't turn out as cute as the picture. I'd give higher stars if the flavor stood out a bit more.

This is a beautiful dish, very colorful.  I may have goofed by putting too much of the cream cheese mixture.  Just a little bit would be better, I think.

This was beautiful and delicious as is.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was a hit at our family Christmas party.  The dill definately makes the spread. I will try to modify this to suit other occasions! Thanks!

I also used real garlic as well and this recipe was a crowd pleaser. It is also super easy to make and very festive. I disagree with not using the dill weed because I think it is what makes the cream spread so tasty and a hint of green like a real Christmas tree. 
Now I just need to think of other shapes to make it for other holidays.

I made this two holiday parties this year.  I made a few changes to this recipe both times with great success.  I used only 1 can of crescent rolls tree and used 1/2 pkg dry ranch dressing instead of listed herbs.  I think next time I will try reduced fat cream cheese to lighten it up a little.

I made my spread with 1/2 pkg of ranch dressing and a touch of dill weed.  Was fantastic and the presentation was beautiful.

I made this for Christmas Eve and everyone loved it! I used garlic flavored crescents and changed up the veggies a little. It was very easy and the presentation was so cute!

It was very easy to make and traveled well to a family get together. I used ranch dip as some others have suggested, but wasn't too pleased with the taste- next time I will try the recipe as is. Everyone loved the way it looked though!

I love to make appetizers, but am not really gifted in the area.  This recipe is fast, fun, easy, and impressive!  I made it with my 3 year-old and we created a new holiday tradition.
