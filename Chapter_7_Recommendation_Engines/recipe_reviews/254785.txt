These eggs are a GAME CHANGER! Mine didn’t look pretty (although admittedly I didn’t try to make it look pretty) but I can assure you they tasted the exact opposite of what they looked like. OMNOMNOM. I’ve been Keto (ultra low carb) for two years and I declare this the best recipe I’ve made in at least five years. Unreal. So good! Thank you!

I've made this twice now, and it is so delicious.  Definitely a new way for me to enjoy my eggs.  The first time I made it exactly as written and I found it to be a little too soupy for my liking.  So the second time I made it I cut the cream and only used 1/3 cup, left the butter the same and used 3 eggs instead of 2.  I did cook mine a little longer than it said, only because I like my eggs a little more done.  These eggs are so good!  Thank You for giving me one more way to enjoy eggs!

All I had on hand was salt, pepper, heavy cream and eggs.  I didn't have the other spices.  But man was this tastey!  I will forever be making my eggs like this!  You will not regret trying this recipe!

Oh my! These eggs are smooth and creamy and perfect! The cooking method and times are exactly right for my taste. I didn't drink the leftover butter cream in the pan...but I wanted to.

This was easy to make and very delicious. Didn’t change a thing. I will definitely make keto bread first next time to get every drop off the plate.

I loved the eggs this way!   The flavor is amazing!  So much better than scrambled eggs I often make for breakfast. I would make it even if I weren’t limiting carbs.  I plan to make some variations but the basic recipe is a definite keeper!

These were absolutely delicious!  They were fairly soupy so I served them over toast and a slice of Canadian bacon - benedict-style- and it was perfect.  Next time I might reduce the cream as another reviewer suggested.  Will definitely become a weekend favorite!

Made these eggs just now for breakfast. I cut the recipe in half and it seems like plenty with just one egg. Delicious and decadent. Next time I might throw in some spinach, or use Cajun spice instead of the red pepper, but it’s great just as the recipe suggests. Winner!

Very very rich! Although I wouldn't put this egg dish on an ongoing breakfast routine because of the heavyness,I will definitely make this every once in awhile for a change of pace while eating  on the Ketogendic plan. I opted for ghee,( clarified Indian butter)instead of regular butter that added a slight nutty taste to this filling dish,and a sprinkling of 21 Seasoning Salute from Trader Joe's for added flavor. Next time I make this,I'll try the recipe for Keto bread,(also found on this website) to soak up the creamyness from this dish. :)

Perfect meal when you are exhausted and borderline hangry. Quick and tastes luxurious. My new favorite and a small sprinkle of chopped bacon put it over the top.

Amazing!  Haven't tried with the cheese but love this recipe.  Have even made it with Whole milk or almond milk when I didn't have the cream on hand (not even close to as good but we were desperate!  It is still better than making them any other way).  Is a game changer recipe!

Since my husband is attempting the keto diet plan I’ve been searching for recipes conducive to that plan. This is a hit! I did modify a bit by adding a couple of tablespoons of sour cream (so that it more resembles my sour cream based hollandaise sauce) and topped withTony’s Creole seasoning instead of red pepper flakes. I have already sent this recipe to my kids.Thank you!
