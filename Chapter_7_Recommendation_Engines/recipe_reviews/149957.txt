I made this exactly as the recipe said and it came out great.  We all enjoyed it.  I'll bet it would be divine on rice as well, using only about a cup of broth.

This recipe is a good "starting point" - I made this but cooked the onion & mushrooms together for a few minutes with some butter before adding chicken stock.  I also used twice as much curry powder and added in some pre-cooked coconut/ginger rice.

Love this recipe! One of my favorites!
A few minor changes: i used 2 pounds of whole baby bellas, (makes the soup more filling) and added them with the onion and curry. I used fresh basil instead of lime leaves added them right before the the chicken broth. Great over brown or jasmine rice.

This is way too sour. Use less lemons & add cayenne pepper if you're going to try this.
