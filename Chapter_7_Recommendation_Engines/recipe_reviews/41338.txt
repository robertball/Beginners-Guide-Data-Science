My second graders loved making and eating this!  I think it is a great way to get picky eaters to eat fruit. However, I did have one child tell me that he did not care for the apple it was on, but liked the dip!I think the key is to have a variety of fruit.  We only used apples. We added a little too much cinnamon for my liking but it was still very good.  Its creamy and a little bit tangy which is a nice combination.

Ditch the low fat stuff! (well, at least...I did!) This was an awesome new dip for fruit! Other than using "regular" yogurt/syrup and such, didn't change a thing and we loved dipping apples, oranges, grapes, and strawberries in this! Thanks TOH!

I used pure maple syrup instead of the fake stuff and quite a few dashes of cinnamon, and it turned out great! I've already recommended it to many friends.

My husband liked this, my son (14) hated it. I used plain yogurt and added 1/4 t. vanilla, as well as substituting 1/2 teaspoon (a bit more as it overflowed the spoon.. I know better than to measure over the dish. Ah well.) maple flavoring instead of the syrup as my husband is diabetic. I think it needs a bit more sweetener with this method though.. though my husband liked it as is. We used it with Fuji apples. It says serves 8... I wonder, 8 what?  It served three of us with one apple each. Maybe 8 if you use it as a fruit salad dressing. Otherwise, it serves 3 or 4.

Wow!! served this dip at a Christmas party & everyone wanted the recipe! Only things I did differently was #1. used real maple syrup instead of reduced calorie pancake syrup & #2. Used about 4 "dashes" of cinnamon..the cinnamon IS what makes this wonderful! mmmm verry yummy

Use real maple syrup. Loved the flavour. Goes great on any fruit. Thanks for a great recipe. Will use it on Christmas Day.

We really didn't like this one.  I even used REAL maple syrup and regular whipped topping (but low-fat vanilla yogurt).  I was hoping it would be a hit since it's not so fattening, but no go with my crowd.

I didn't bother to try to make this low-fat.  I used real maple syrup and full calorie yogurt and whipped topping.  Came out wonderfully!  Especially delicious with strawberries.

A nice change from the regular fruit dips.  I followed the advice of others and used real syrup and a little more cinnamon.

I thought this to be a nice refreshing change..........I had no vanilla yogart so I used the strawberry, banana that was on hand and no sugar added syrup.  Gave it a nice mild fruity flavor. Next time I will try it with flavored whipped topping.  Thanks!

I made this using regular ingredients (instead of the non-fat) and served with strawberries.  Everyone loved it!

Great tasting dip! Not as thick as a cream cheese dip, so it goes a long way.

Great dip with the winning combination of (1)easy ingredients that are usually on hand and (2)tasty to all ages groups! Good on pears, apples, bananas - not just berries.  Also used real syrup (the 'fake' stuff tastes...fake!) and plain yogurt with about 1/8 teas of vanilla.  Had a bit leftover and used it as sauce in fruit salad - my 2yo daughter ate her whole bowl!

I made this last night for a "girl's night in" Valentine's party.  At first I wasn't sure I liked it, but everyone raved and soon I was convinced too!  This dip was soooooo easy to make and you would never know it is so low fat.  My dieting friends were delighted and you will be too!

This was so good!  I'm glad we tried it.  No one could believe it was so healthy and my husband, who is strictly a carnivore, actually ate fruit with this dip!
