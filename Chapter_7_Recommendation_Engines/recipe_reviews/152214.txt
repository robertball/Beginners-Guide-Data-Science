Wow wow and double wow!! I can't believe how AWESOME this recipe is! I took it to a church potluck and there wasn't a crumb left and got many requests for the recipe. It is really juicy but not runny at all. Next time I think I will bump up the cinnaman since we love extra spice but most will probably find the original amount just fine. You HAVE to try this!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was sooooooo yummy! This was my first ever apple pie. My youngest son loves apple pie and requested one, so I browsed around here and found this. We like 2 crust fruit pies versus lattice topped. The only challenge was a 10" pie crust recipe. I was in a huge rush and didn't have time to search for one. I ended up using the store bought ready made (sorry to all the purists..LOL!) It was probably a little thin, but I had to make do. It actually was quite tasty.
I sliced the apples really thin as I don't care for undercooked apples in pie and they melted in your mouth. My MIL usually does T-giving and makes apple pie...burns the edges of the crust...yuck..and the apples are kinda hard, so I was happy to give it a go! (No, I don't hate my MIL, I actually love her!)
Thanks for the recipe...how 'bout a 10" pie crust recipe????

I made this recipe yesterday to have for dessert. This was a great apple pie. I did substitute instant tapioca for the potato starch and added a little bit of apple cider I bought from the orchard where I purchased the apples. I am terrible at rolling anything out (I will need more practice perfecting a dough) so I used refrigerated crust. My family loved the pie.

This is very good...I made a couple of changes though. I used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 6 granny smith apples (which was more than enough).

Wow...what an awesome Apple Pie! I was craving a little piece of America for my 32nd Birthday so I searched and searched for what I would consider the appropriate Apple Pie recipe; this is the one! I felt almost as if I was back in the States with a marching band passing in front of my on the 4th of July! I didn't change anything with the recipe and would advise that nobody attempt to do so either. It was easy to make and joyfull to eat...a keeper, for sure!

I'm an apple pie snob, so I'm super picky.  This one is a winner. Really, really good and so easy!  I didn't have potato starch so I used corn starch.  It worked just fine.  thank you!!!

This is great!  Used granny smith's, as they were on hand.  Also used 1/2 cup regular and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Did not have a baking stone, so just put foil under pie pan - but no leakage anyway.  Wonderful apple flavor!

FANTASTIC Pie recipe!  I used two granny smith, two golden delicious and 2 Fuji apples to give the pie a little more taste and texture and I was pleased with the way it came out.  Used corn starch as that's what I had on hand and it didn't seem to make any difference, still came out nice and juicy, yet not soupy.  I also added walnuts in with the sugar mixture and the husband loved it.

I liked this.  The juices in the pie tasted really good, but I didn't have potato starch and so it was a little more soupy.  I will add flour next time.  Also, I had really small apples, so I think I could have added more.  The granny smith flavor was really good and I liked adding the butter.

I made this last year for the first time at Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it and was really surprised how well a "non" cook or baker for that matter could make an apple pie that was just perfect in every way. The only thing that I changed was I added carmel sauce on top of the apples before I covered them with the 2nd crust. Absolutely wonderful!

The taste was awesome, and I loved how the juices didn't flow all over the place when the pie was cut.  I will note that I used cornstarch in lieu of potato starch...and I also used 1 1/2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar for the lemon juice. (I didn't want to go to the store for the ingredients I didn't have) One major change I will make for next time is just blending the sugar mixture in with the apples before putting the apples in the crust.  After it finished baking, there was stll a heavy layer of t atop the apples...otherwise still very delicious...and nice and gooey.

I have never made apple pie but my son have us read every night this hand me down book every night "president & mom's apple pie," so I decided to make him one even though he does not like to eat food but he loved this pie and my husband too. I just followed the exact instructions with whatever mix apples I had at home also had store bought pie crust sheets. Very simple recipe and extremely good and had ice cream on the side :)Yummy!

Excellent recipe! I MISTAKENLY added sugar (1/2cup white and 1/2 cup brown).  I wish I had followed the recipe. The extra sugar was too much. That being said the flavor was good and I am sure without the additional sweet it would be perfect.

Great recipe! Always make it whenever I need a pie, and people LOVE IT!  My only suggestion would be to cut back the amount of sugar/potato starch in the recipe, as I tend to end up with more than I need.

Delicious!  I use a mix of baking apples rather than all golden delicious and since I never have potato starch on hand, I just use corn starch.  This is the pie people ask for at every holiday!

I used 5 granny smith and 3 golden delicious apples and subbed arrowroot starch since I didn't have any potato starch. Put it in a Pillsbury gluten free pie crust, and hubby told me it was the best pie he's had since going gluten free several years ago! I'll definitely make this again!

I made the recipe as written.  It was too bland for my taste, and I prefer Granny Smith apples.  I will use the potato starch again, however.

This pie is delicious!! I did make a few substitutions though. In place of 3/4 cup white sugar, I used 1/2c white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar. I also increased the cinnamon to closer to 2tsp as we enjoy our pie with more spice. Also increased the nutmeg a wee bit. I didn’t have potato starch so used corn starch instead and it worked out just fine. The pie is not soupy when cut into, but also not dry. I will definitely make this one again!

This was a decent recipe, but I felt it needed to be a little sweeter, and a little less apples.  I will make again!

Perfect apple pie recipe! I've made this pie 3 times and every time it's a hit. Tastes much better than store bought. Like others, I used corn starch instead of potato starch and it works just fine. I always use a crust recipe from the book, The Secrets of Baking. These two recipes combined makes the perfect pie!

This pie challenged my apple stacking skills, but it was so worth it.  There is just enough sugar and spice to make any true sweet eater happy mixed with a generous amount of apples for the true apple pie fan.  In this house you get two sticky thumbs up.

I really like this recipe.  I did not have potato starch and used regular cornstarch.  It turned out great.  The nutmeg was a nice addition to the cinnamon.  I will make again!

I've made this pie twice and it's now the ONLY apple pie that my family wants!  I used fresh Cortland apples, part brown sugar, cornstarch instead of potato, and cheated by using pre-made crust and it came out fabulous.  Even better than my mother-in-law's ... and that's saying a lot!

It's a great recipe!  Never attempted a pie before and this was definitely a keeper. Wasn't difficult at all. Other than forgetting to put the vents in the top and being lousy at crimping the crust, my boyfriend's request for an apple pie were met with applause! I think this will be another holiday requested item for me to bring. Bravo to the writer of this recipe!

This recipe was delicious tasting. However, the mile high pie fell like the flatlands once cooked.  5 for flavor, 3 for presentation since apples cooked down so much, so rated it a 4 average.

Great Pie! It was really tasty and not very hard to make. I have a slicer that slices the apple which de-coring; it was quite helpful while slicing the apples.
