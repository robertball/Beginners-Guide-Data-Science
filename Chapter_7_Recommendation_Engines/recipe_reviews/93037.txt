There are 2 Cranberry Salsa recipes on here and I think I mixed the best of both   I used the Grand Marnier, and Cranberries, but added the Green Onions and Cilantro from another recipe.  It was fantastic.  I love the smell of Cilantro.  Note - Cranberries aren't always available.  Buy them up between Thanksgiving and Christmas.

We made this for Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it.  Served it over cream cheese with wheat crackers.  Enough for 3 cream cheese blocks.  Will make it again and again, great for the holidays, thanks for sharing!

I would like it with more kick, but the other 20 people at the party pronounced it wonderful, gave out the recipe to several people...
Only added 1/2 c sugar. Loved the tang of the lime and cranberry with the sweet/spicy flavor. Great with those scoop chips, holds more salsa!

Loved this! But as I was making it I tasted it and almost threw it out. I made it the day before Thanksgiving so luckily I gave it a chance and let it sit in the fridge overnight. I'm so glad I did because this was my favorite thing on Thanksgiving! I liked that it wasn't so spicy because you can use it on your turkey if you want. I made a few changes - I added 3/4 cup sugar, added green onion, used apple juice instead of orange liqueur (didn't have any), used a whole cucumber, didn't use celery, and also added some of the juice from the pickled jalapeno jar. This was really good and was a hit with all my guests.

Fantastic recipe! Like another reviewer, I made a couple of modifcations, mostly just so I could use what I already had on-hand. I substituted 1 tsp of orange extract and 2 tablespoons of cherry syrup for the Grand Marnier. I also added about 1/4 cup chopped white onion. The flavors blend so well together. This makes a nice, fresh alternative to traditional salsa. I'll be giving some away over the holidays for sure!!

We made this salsa last year for a party we had with friends the Friday after Thanksgiving.  It was SO easy to make and we did not stray from the recipe.  We used leftover turkey to make "Turkey Wontons" and the salsa was the dipping sauce.  We ran out of both and ended up going to the store to make more!  Everyone left with the recipe...  Best Friday Thanksgiving ever!

It was OK...texture didn't do it for me for some reason. I think perhaps I am used to my cranberries being cooked.

Really fun and different! I would add a touch more sugar and about twice the jalapenos next time. I also recommend refrigerating it for an hour or so before serving.

Pretty tasty.   Served with tortilla chips.  Added 1 green onion and some cilantro, per other reviewers.  Also, used St. Germaine, instead of the orange liquor.  Would be delicious on hot, sliced turkey.

This one is a keeper!  It was easy to make and everyone fought over the last bite.  I'll be serving this all year, not just for the holidays.  YUM!
