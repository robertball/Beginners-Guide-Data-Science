This was excellent! I used the bread I had on hand and also smaller shrimp but that didn't change the flavor any. The only real change I made that does change the flavor is that I used Kansas City's Gates BBQ sauce because that is our favorite and the only one we use. As with any recipe that calls for bbq sauce, I always say use your favorite. I didn't expect to be wowed by the relish because ranch flavor has never done much for me but it really complimented the grilled veggies and I enjoyed it very much. It was so good in fact that I ate the leftover by itself for lunch the next day. This a great sandwich and a much healthier alternative to the traditional fried shrimp po' boys. This one is a keeper!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I took away one of the 5 stars because I thought it was tough to make and would be very hard to time everything just right if you were making it by yourself. Husband was grilling everything outside while I didnt everything inside which helped out tons. We loved the combination of flavors - the grilled veggies with the ranch twist and bbq sauce was great. We normally fry shrimp for po boys but this grilled shrimp recipe will be our summer po boy go to recipe. We just used lettuce since we didnt have any argula and it was still good and I didnt have ranch seasonging so I used a bit of ranch dressing. Give a try if you like shrimp po boys! Oh, and we served it with some grilled pineapple to finish off the meal.
