Not sure I would call this a chutney I would say more like a cilantro pesto.  It was good though!  I served it over some Curried grilled chicken.  It was a perfect match!  The tomato sauce seemed like a strange ingredient in this but its not!  Worked right in well!  Thanks so much!

I liked this recipe, I used it on top of chicken and put 2 Tbls. in my chicken flavored rice (to kinda tie everything together) and the rice turned out being the best tasting part of the meal.

I needed a Chutney for the apple peanut spinach salad and 1/2'd this recipe.  It worked great and I'd make it again.  I find it's consistancy is more like a pesto though.

I tripled the chile and finished a grilled chicken masala with it.  Lots of heat and good flavor.  Instead of sauce use 2 tomatoes and 1/2 the ginger for a great tortilla dip.

It was very nice. Pretty much prepared it as per the recipe. Used it to top boneless baked pork strips. Worked fine as a half recipe. Thanks for the recipe. Increasing my cilantro intake with chlorella supplements to aid in heavy metals detoxification/chelation.

Good recipe, I make this every few weeks or so. A key change I make is that I add a can of coconut milk (since I can't get a small quantity of fresh coconut - it's a full coconut or nothing). It's how I recall it from my days in the old country and adds a nice taste and texture to the chutney.

I found this was missing something,  I added a pinch of salt and about a tsp of sugar,

I peeked at your recipe to use in my summertime quinoa dish--turned the same old quinoa recipe completely upside down. So delicious!
