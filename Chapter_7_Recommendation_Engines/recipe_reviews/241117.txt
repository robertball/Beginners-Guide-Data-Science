This is just the kind of fish and chip breading we love. I used wild Alaskan Cod because halibut was $20 a pound (and I was being cheap...though I prefer halibut). I did cut the filets lengthwise so we could get more of that crunchy goodness all over. Next time I would salt and pepper the filets before I dipped them but otherwise PERFECTION!!! Crispy, crunchy (NOT greasy) with flaky and tender mild fish. Sparky has already asked for a repeat SOON.  Thanks for sharing this stellar fish recipe!

Hands down the best breading I've ever made!! The only thing that I would change is the size of the chunks of fish. By the time the fish was cooked through the breading was almost too crispy. The smaller pieces were perfect. I would do 1 inch x 2 inch strips next time. I also used the same breading with Flounder instead of Halibut (for my kids.....Halibut is too expensive to buy enough for them.) It was delicious too! And took less time to cook. Overall a recipe definitely worth making!!

Simple and delicious. Put on hot dog bun with diced onion and pickle wasabi aioli and chopped lettuce with a little malt vinegar.

Something about the combination of bread and Panko crumbs creates a great crunchy crust!! It's a keeper for any type fish you fry!  We have used it on walleye too!! Yum!

Made this by pan frying, came out delicious. Used original bread crumbs, so seasoned the halibut with salt, pepper, and a little garlic powder prior to dipping in the egg mix.

I used this recipe to make Black Sea Bass. I mixed all ingredients together and added more milk to thin out. I added salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and old bay. Then fried them. They  are delicious.

I did not have bread crumbs, but it still turned out amazing. We also only cooked the  3" pieces about 2 minutes.
