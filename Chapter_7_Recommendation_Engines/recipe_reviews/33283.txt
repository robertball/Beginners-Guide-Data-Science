It looks like you're drinking a martini (if you don't use the dark creme de cacao), but it tastes so much better!

Yuck. Butterscotch schnapps and creme de cacao are mixers for a reason. This was so incredibly sweet I had to pour it out. Much, much better when you mix with Baileys.

This is a great chocolate martini. They usually have vodka instead of the butterscotch schnapps, but I love the butterscotch taste. It was a bit sweet but that didn't bother me.

I've never had a drink quite like this before.  It was on the sweet side but not in an obnoxious way.
