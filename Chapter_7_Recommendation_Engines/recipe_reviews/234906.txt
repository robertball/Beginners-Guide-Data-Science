4.23.16   This is one of those recipes where you most likely will have all ingredients in the pantry...love them!  Sometimes, you’re just looking for something that’s simple and falls into the category of comfort food, and that’s this recipe.  We eat a lot of soup and salads/sandwiches for dinner once the weather turns warm (I live in Florida, so that’s most of the time).  I had a piece of a hot chili pepper in the fridge, so I did chop that and added it to the soup pot, otherwise, followed the recipe.  This hit the spot and was exactly what I was looking for!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Family loved it.  I did not have 2 pounds of ground beef so i used one pound of ground beef and one pound of ground sweet sausage.  This turned out to be great!!
