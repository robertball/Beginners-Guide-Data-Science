Yumm! Thanks for the great recipe! This was incredibly easy to prepare, and although it was time consuming, the end result was worth it. I only used a 3 and 1/2 pound brisket, so I used one can less of both beer and beef broth. I will definitely make this again.

This was really good, all enjoyed it, it does not taste like beer and the kids appreciated that.  I pan seared the brisket and the onions and then transferred to crock pot.  Cooked 4 hours on high and 4 hours on low thereby eliminating the in and out of the oven an refrigerator.   I don not believe this changed the flavor or texture, which were terrific.

The house smelled heavenly at first, but as the aroma got stronger, I decided to uncover and check the pan.  Good thing, because every bit of the juices had evaporated and burned to the bottom of the pan along with the sliced onions and those from the soup.  I would try this again but cook it properly--at a low temperature.

I uploaded a picture just after the searing phase.  I put it in the oven and left it alone for the full cooking time.  Because I was serving it that evening, I did not chill overnight as directed.  After resting for about 15 minutes, it sliced perfectly and the sauce was heavenly.  Served with latkes and cauliflower Pollinaise.  Fantastic!

Made a very hard brisket that was tough  to cut and chew. Followed the recipe exactly. Oh well...

Pretty good!  I added garlic, and used just one can of each (soup, broth, beer) as we only had a small first cut of 2.5 lbs.

I had found a different recipe online that was really similar but it called  for sherry vs beer.  The other recipe had 3 times as much yellow onions and it had you add fresh rosemary and thyme. I did those things but added beer per this recipe. My butcher recommended using a wheat beer which I did.  I made this recipe with Blue Moon Wheat Beer.  I cooked the brisket at 350 for 1 hour per pound. I also cooked the brisket all at once and didnâ€™t remove the fat cap until it was resting at the end. It was easy, moist, tender, and remarkably tasty!
