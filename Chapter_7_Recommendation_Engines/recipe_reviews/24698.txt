As always, I made a slight modification just to make things easier: I bought tubs of the microwavable dipping chocolates that is now available in most stores to dip the cherries in.

Here is a very helpful tip: Buy the mini-muffin/cupcake/candy cups to place each cherry in after dipping. I found mine at Michael's craft store but I know they have them in grocery stores, as well.

I think it looks nice to use these when presenting them, especially if they are in a candy box.

Also, it is helpful if you dip the cherry and place it directly into the cup...because when you pick the cherry up from whatever surface, there is a spot where the chocolate doesn't cover and the juices from the filling will seep out. What happened to me the first time round with this recipe was this: I placed the dipped cherries onto wax paper to dry. Then, I moved the cherries from the wax paper into my container. The filling seeped out through the bottom part of the cherry that had touched the wax paper and there was no chocolate there. So, it helps to put them into the candy cups directly after dipping them.


Hoped this all made sense!

WOW! These are hands down the absolute best chocolate covered cherries I have ever eaten!  I have never really cared for them until now, but I wanted to make some for my husband so this recipe looked easy enough.  Boy was I surprised when I bit into one of these.  I can't stop eating them.
I had such good results that I thought I'd share what I did:
I wanted to make a big batch so I used 4 jars of Great Value (Wal-mart) maraschino cherries WITH STEMS-hint:  these are not with the canned fruit, they are on the isle with ice cream toppings.  I tripled the dough recipe and used 1 bag of dark chocolate chips mixed with 1 bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 TBSP shortening.  This was the right amount of chocolate and dough for the number of cherries. I drained and chilled the cherries, wrapped in dough then briefly chilled before dipping them in the chocolate.  I left the stems on for ease of dipping in chocolate.  I let them sit overnight then pulled the stems out the next morning.  Where the stem left a small hole I patched it with a dab of chocolate.  Once dried, I flipped them over and used a butter knife to spread an extra layer of chocolate on the bottom to cover any thin areas where they sat on the wax paper.  This took a little work but I had NO leaking and from dipping them with the stems on they had a nice even coating on the outside and looked very much like the store bought kind.  Everyone that has had one has LOVED them.  I will definitely make these again and aga

It's cold here in Illinois (everywhere?) right now so a great time for candy making.  My dad gave us Brach's dark chocolate covered cherries every year for Christmas and now they don't make them.  I was hoping this would be like them.  I didn't have the chocolate bark so I used the little dark chocolate "buttons" I buy every year at Christmas from the local candy supply store.  Also, my cherries didn't have stems but this wasn't a problem.  The key is to buy the little Wilton candy dipping packet that has 3 or 4 different kinds of dipping tools.  Also, DROP THESE ON A COLD WAX PAPER COOKIE SHEET - helps them set right away.  Only a couple needed re-dipped.  If you have a little uncovered spot on the bottom, just pick it up after setting, and re-dip just that little spot.  All that being said, these are good but WAY too sweet.    Update:  I tried this again with the milk chocolate (same buttons from candy making store) and they are way better so I'm upgrading to 5 stars.  Thanks! Another update - I tried this at Christmas with the "chocolate bark" and really hated it - yuck!  Use real milk chocolate!  If you can't find the candy "buttons", use milk chocolate chips.  It really does make all the difference.

I never would have thought that I could make candy like this--on the first try!  I used Ghiradelli Chocolate chips melted in a cereal bowl over some simmering water and added a little shortening.  Worked like a charm.  I was hoping the white center would "dissolve" into just juices and sure enough, after just a few days they have.  I'm so impressed with myself and this recipe.  Thanks!

Very easy to make....took advice of one person who left a review and I put them directly into mini paper cups for truffles...not a good idea...the chocolate takes form of the cup...instead I would just place them on a wax paper lined cookie sheet and peel them off after.  Taste excellent though!  **UPDATE  I made these 2 weeks ago and put them away to get gooey in the middle...and I tried one last night and they are not gooey AT ALL!!  It's basically a cherry, wrapped in fondant, covered in chocolate!  What happened???

These are better than store bought and suprisingly easy to make.  I was worried about using to much of the sugar dough and was probably too skimpy.  I'd be sure to use the full teaspoon next time.  After 3 or 4 days, they were already nice and creamy.  I think next time I might also try adding a bit of paraffin to the chocolate coating... they seemed to lose their lustre within the first week.

This is a very yummy and simple recipe. Chocolate covered cherries are my favorite candy and I am very picky about them. The only thing I will do next time is double dip the bottoms- they tend to spring a leak and get a bit sticky. Rave reviews!

Out of this world!! I can't wait to try these out on family and friends on the holidays. These are perfect just the way they are, but next time I'm going to try adding a few drops of mint flavoring to the dough mixture to have chocolate mint cherries,just for something a little different. Also after the first dipping of chocolate( I used Chocolate Almond Bark and it worked really well) try dipping them a second time half way,in melted Vanilla Almond Bark. I think they would look great. Thank you for sharing the recipe.I will be making these alot for special occasions.

I'm guessing the 1 gallon jar of maraschino cherries with stems is about 300 to 400 cherries. I made 3 different batches with different flavours (plain, rum, almond). Each batch wrapped 50 cherries using 1 level tsp of fondant. I put each tsp of dough in between 2 pieces of waxed paper and using the flat bottom of a glass, pressed out to about 2" disc. I wrapped the fondant around the cherry and rolled between my palms, even with the stem on, then I froze. The frozen cherry was easy to dip using the stem, then I twirled the cherry to remove excess chocolate. Only 2 stems (out of 150) broke off using this method. Even when putting the dipped cherries on waxed paper on top of a frozen plate, they still needed to be double dipped on the bottom. I'll be using candy cups from now on to shorten this process. Adding shortening to pure milk chocolate will make the chocolate super soft which was OK but the cherries cannot touch each other because they'll stick together. Whoever said the juicier the cherry the better was correct. The rum batch where the cherries sat out drying the longest have a crystally sugar consistency rather than a softer juicier center. Though if the cherry is too wet it's really hard to wrap. Great recipe Meredith. Thanks.

These were amazing and not that hard to make. HELPFUL HINT: I put a baking sheet in the freezer for about an hour before I made these, then took it out and covered it with aluminum foil. When you put the dipped cherries on them, they cool instantly and don't leave the bottom of the cherry without chocolate. PERFECT!

I have made thousands and thousands of chocolate covered cherries (with a different recipe), and I sell them by the dozen.  Just a few tips, you do not need to let them harden after wrapping them, after making thousands, I decided that was a step that was totally not necessary, I wrap them with the stem sticking out, and immediately dip in the chocolate, and put in a clear plastic mini muffin container with a paper liner, and wala, done with it.  I leave the stems on because when they are on a tray with other candy, it is very obvious of what this candy is, I think it is kind of unique, and even in the mini muffin containers, it looks nice with the stems in. The wrapping won't totally turn liquid but will get juicier with time.  I store them in the refrigerator, they can also be frozen.

Great recipe! I found that by "dusting" my hands with powdered sugar while wrapping the sugar dough around the cherries went a lot faster and was less messy. I have made these lots of times and I tweaked the recipe just a bit by adding a few drops of almond extract to the dough to give the finished candy more of a cordial flavor.

SO TIME CONSUMING, but these are very addictive. I doubled the recipe and dipped half in semi-sweet choc chips w/2 tbsp shortening and the other half in white choc. I added 2 tbsp cherry juice and 1/2 tsp almond extract to dough mixture. Was a nice addition!!!! I left the stems on, because I think they look decorative that way and they are easy for everyone to pick up! I froze cherries first, then chilled them after wrapping dough on them and then took a few out of fridge at a time and dipped in choc. Helpful hint: I rolled dime size balls of dough in palm then flattened and it wrapped nicely around cherry. Dont let dough get warm, will not wrap easily.

I doubled the recipe for the fondant, and added 2 TBSP maraschino cherry juice, and 2 tsp Almond extract which made it very extra yummy!!! I dont know if they will last long enough to even get a chance to liquify, but doesnt really matter, because they are delicious as is!!  I used shortening on my hands to keep the fondant from sticking to my hands, and it worked really well. I used the cherries without the stems and had no problems with leakage. Thanks for a great recipe!! These will be on my list of Christmas candy to make for years to come!

These are fantastic! One word of advice, I kept mine in the 'fridge for a week, and the insides did not melt. However, after storing them in an airtight container in the kitchen for 3 days, the humidity did it's trick to make them gooey.

THIS is what I have been searching for! I haven't tried it yet but I have some maraschino cherries soaking in brandy as I type awaiting for the perfect recipe ot make chocolates with! I usually just drain them, let them dry then dip them in chocloate. While they are good just like that Ive been wanting to find a nice creamy center to add to it! Unfortunately the store did not have the stemmed ones so I bought the ONLY kind they had. But I have a chocolate mold perfect for cherry type candies. I will fill the mold with the chocolate, let it harden, add some of the dough inside add the cherry and add more dough to secure the cherry nicely then cover the bottom with chocolate. This way too should take care of the leaky bottom problem!   Will post results when I make these! :)

A great recipe and I made them twice over the Christmas holiday's. Lots of work but yummy. I dipped mine in milk chocolate and then once they hardened, white chocolate. I found them at their best at 7 - 10 days but the filling started to get grainy after that (by 14 days).

I'm a Baker and have been using a recipe very similar to this for years. The only difference is that I add about 1 tsp of the Cherry Syrup to the sugar dough. I find that it adds more flavor to the final product. In my experience, You really must keep the dough refrigerated, I usually have time to make about 10 before putting it back in the fridge (for about 7-10 minutes). Also, when wrapping the cherries in the sugar, smush it in kinda roughly, and then roll it in your hands to even it out. That creates the nicest result. And when I do mine, sometimes I use cherries without stems. When doing this, you need to have wire tongs to dip it into the chocolate, but the overall result is the same. Love this recipe!

Great recipe!  However, if you want it to actually yield 60 cherries, you'll have to use about 1/2 tsp of the dough to cover each cherry instead of 1 tsp.  Also, take the other reviewers advice and put everything (the dough, the cherries, your spoon, the tray you'll put them on, everything) in the freezer for about 20 minutes before you try to wrap them and several times during the process as it all warms up again.  Also, run your hands under cold water first and then handle the dough as little as possible as you flatten it out and wrap it up over the cherry.

Very close to the recipe I used to use and lost.......my old one also had a bit of brandy in it so all I did was add a bit of brandy to the sugar filling on this one. One thing the recipe fails to emphasize is that you really do *need* to let these sit for a week or 2 for the centers to get the right consistency. I do remember that from past "cherry making"!! The title just "suggests" they are better that way.  How I make them leak proof (if you want to bother with buying candy molds): I coat the mold with a layer of chocolate, put the cherry stuff in the middle and top off with more chocolate. Cool and pop out. They come out store-bought professional looking this way for gift giving.

These cherries are delish!!! Tough to keep around the house for two weeks but worth it! THIS IS A GREAT ACTIVITY FOR KIDS! My 8 year old son and I made many for Valentine's Day this year. I froze the cherries after quickly draining the juice out. The juicier the cherry the better.  We then wrapped them and tossed them into the freezer again while we melted the chocolate. Dulci Frutta is a perfect chocolate for this recipe and for projects with kids! Last step was to drizzle a little white chocolate across the top. My son was very proud to hand these out after he had helped with every step of this recipe.
We only altered the recipe by adding a small amount of the cherry juice to the fondant and then more sugar to even out the dough.
Also, made Grand Marnier cherries for the adults by marinating the drained cherries for two days. SO YUMMY!

I made these to give as gifts to my friends for Valentine’s Day.  These were very good and pretty sweet.  I measured the dough into teaspoons and rolled into a ball before flattening with the bottom of a glass dipped in powdered sugar.  This made it a uniform thickness and was perfectly round and wrapped around the cherries nicely.  I was disappointed with the chocolate not having a shine to it. Great recipe. I will make these again.

12-15-2014 update: I've made these little gems a couple times and they are way better than store bought. The teaspoon of fondant called for is the perfect amount to wrap around the cherries, much more than that and your centers may not get as gooey as you would like. Definitely best to make these 10 days - 2 weeks before you intend to devour them. Instead of using conf coating, I melt a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips made with real cocoa butter using a glass bowl over a steaming pot of water. A good quality chocolate is key to a delicious result. I thought the semi-sweet chocolate helps to cutdown on sweetness just a tad. After dipping the cherries I put the leftover chocolate into a sandwich zip top bag, clipped the corner and drizzled the chocolate over the coated cherries to give them a prettier finished look. I do think it took more than an hour to make these. So easy and yummy.

Wow, these were awesome. They taste just like the store bought ones. I used melted milk chocolate chips for the outer coating instead of the confectioner's coating and they turned out perfect. They do take almost a week to get "juicy" inside, so it's best to wait until then to eat them.

These are amazing. I made things a lot easier on myself by buying the Wilton chocolate melting pot that is sold in the candy making section of Michaels. I also bought the real wilton melting chocolate that is also used in the chocolate fountain. They came out INSANELY good and I sold over $200 worth this Christmas season. Also, I found the jumbo cherries and used those, they are much larger, and there are not stems. I covered some in white, some in dark and the rest in regular milk. Will definitely use this recipe next christmas.

This looks very similar to the recipe I got years ago from a Southern Living magazine. I usually mix up three batches of the "filling" one I use to make the chocolate covered cherries, the next I mix in baker's coconut, and the last I mix in mint flavoring to taste. Then you have 3 different candies. Also I usually melt 1 pkg of chocolate candy coating and then stir in a 12oz pkg of semi-sweet chocolate chips. This gives it a more genuine chocolate taste while keeping the firmness that you get from using the candy coating.

This recipe was great.  It was pretty time consuming but that was expected.  Follow that advice of other reviews and put the cherries in the freezer.  Also, after rolling the cherries with the filling, place them back in the freezer.  That made them so much easier to dip.  I double-dipped mine so they would not leak.  Excellent!

Drunken Cherries: Drain the cherry juice, let the cherries dry a bit on a paper towel, then fill the jars with Vanilla Vodka. (I also used Mango Liquor, Burbon and Brandy, in different jars.) Let them marinade for a bit, then make as the recipe says. I covered each in a different chocolate, decorated the tops with different sugars so everyone could tell which was which. They are wonderful!

I just made these for the first time.  The recipe was easy to follow.  The dough was a little messy to work with, you will want to make sure that you add a little oil to your hands. This made it so much better.  I will be making these for years to come.  They are delish!

WOW!!!! I never thought I would ever be able to make something so fancy looking and soooo close to the ones you buy at the store!! Everyone was sooo impressed. I only had 43 cherries but it was no where near enough even though I followed the 1 tsp per cherry!! So I ended up making another half batch, which guess what?...Still not enough for my 43 cherries! I ended up making only 38 cherries and it was really tight. I added almond extract to half the fondant and none for the other half. Both were amazingly good. I followed others suggestions and freezed the tray which I lined with parchment paper for easy cleanup. I then froze the fondant covered cherries on that tray b4 covering with chocolate (I used dark couverture chocolate, which are the flat rounds you find at bulk stores, these are the best for melting thin enough to cover things easily). So easy and fun, they weren't even that messy since they set up quite fast this way. I served them only 3 days later and they were sooo amazing! My mom HAD to call me and tell me how addictive they were and how everyone loved them. Thank you so much for this recipe!

oh my gosh! These are decadent. I found that I can minimize leaving and "patch jobs" by putting the freshly dipped cherries onto a cookie sheet that I had put into the freezer for about half an hour. 

I also found that it was easier to make these if the stems are removed at the very beginning of the process. That seems counter-intuitive, but here's what I did. After dusting your hands with powdered sugar, get the right amount of fondant and roll it into a ball. Then press it into a disk and put a cherry in the middle, and wrap it up as well as you can. Then, roll the whole thing as if you were rolling the fondant into a ball again. This will help get even coverage. When dipping time came, I just stuck a fondue fork into the top and dipped. In hindsight, I think a skewer would have worked better, but the fork was handy. Once they were all dipped, I went over them with the semi-cooled chocolate with a pastry brush and voila. Then it was back to the freezer for 15 minutes, turned them over and went back at it with the pastry brush. 

Yes, these are a little time consuming. And yes, you have to wait a lot of time before you can even experience how wonderful they are, but for the love of all that is good in this world, they are so worth it!

Although these took a little more effort than I expected, they were VERY good.  Choc Cov Cherries are one of my husbands' favorites, and about a week after he ate some of these I didn't feel like making them again so I bought him a box.  Big mistake.  The boxed ones fall so flat against these, especially if you use good chocolate.  One thing - make sure you use a VERY THIN coating of the sugar dough, if it's too thick it won't soften enough, and I did keep mine in the fridge.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was going to make these for my mother-in-law, who loves chocolate covered cherries, and they were a disaster.  I made use of the freezer, added extra powdered sugar, and the powdered sugar coating was still a big gooey mess. To make matters worse, i tried to dip a few, and a glob of it fell off in the chocolate, and made it unusable.  I would not make these again, sorry.  The flavors were good, but not better than the store bought.

My dad loves chocolate covered cherries, and he thought these were excellent.  I made them for him and gave them to him for Christmas.  Everyone who tried them loved them.  It is best to keep the fondant fairly thin, that way they don't end up too sweet.  Also, when dipping them in the chocolate, make sure to cover the entire cherry.  If you don't, the fondant will leak out.  I also suggest that after you take the chocolate covered cherry off the wax paper, use your finger or something to spread a little chocolate on the bottom to ensure that there won't be any leaks.  Great Recipe!!

Made this for Christmas to give as gifts. Everyone loved them over coconut balls, millionaires, and peanut butter balls. Used rasberry extract for flavoring. They were juicy in a couple of days, stored in refrigerator. Family wanted more.

I was not sure of this recipe as im not a huge glace cherry fan...and i was right to be unsure. I didnt like the glace cherries so I made them again with room temperture frech cherries and dried cherries. With the fresh ones...dont let them sit for 2 weeks you wont be liking the mouldy cherry but they are fantastic served the same day with coffee after dinner and the dried cherries were fanstastic as you could let them sit for a week or 2 and they retained all the flavour of a real cherry without the mould. VERY YUM!

These are very good.  I made them last week and they have improved with age, but I'm giving them a 4 star rating because the filling is a little pasty.

I've been making these for several years now. After I drain the cherries I put them on a waxed paper lined cookie sheet in the freezer while the dough is chilling.  I pat the chilled dough out in the palm of my hand with my thumb and I've found 55 cherries is about the right number for me. Then I put them back in the freeze before I dip them. As I dip them I put them back on the same frozen sheet maybe that's why I never have a problem with the bottom not being covered in chocolate.  Also make sure to use real butter or the dough won't set up.  One time I accidentally didn't use butter and the dough was just a sticky mess.

I made these last year and they were a HUGE hit. I used the Oregon brand canned cherries and I also made a batch with blue berries. The dough is hard to work with, especially if you are impatient like I am, but in the end they are very much worth the effort. They have been requested again this year, and I cannot refuse to deliver. These are great for the holidays!

These are soooo good- but they definitely require some work!  I used very small candy cups (like tiny cupcake baking cups) and placed a cherry in each after I had coated it with the chocolate.  They came out just fine- no oozing out!!

DELICIOUS! Please note that they do get better the longer they sit. The first night I didn't think they were very good but several days later they were a hundred times better! We made them for Christmas baskets and everyone was impressed!

So i just finished making these and i tasted one and OMG these are delicious.  It was a lot of work, but well worth every second,  and man i love love love chocolate covered cherries these are as good as the box, but ill say better cuz i put in the hard work. i had more then enough of the filling to cover 60 cherries, i guess it depends on how much you are surrounding the cherry with, i even had a little left over probably enough to do 3 more cherries.  i did dip half in chocolate bark and half in white cocolate, that was the only change i made. Things i did when i kneaded it into a ball i flattened the ball out so it could chill faster.  i chilled the cherries after draining them and a half a hour before i covered the cherries , i put a cookie sheet topped with a silpat in the freezer.  As i was covering the cherries with the filling, i  would put them back in the freezer so they would be cold when it came time to dip.  When i was done i looked at every one and patched up any holes i saw stuff seeping out of, i left the steams in.  They are DELICIOUS!!!!

while the concept is interesting,will not make again. perfer to melt block chocolate and dip drained cherries right into the chocolate. I dry some of the juice off the cherries so the chocolate will adhere better.

These were much easier than I anticipated to make.  I followed the directions exactly.  I let them sit for over a week and they still didn't turn 100% to liquid.  Maybe they aren't supposed to??  The taste was good, but I still prefer the ones from the store!

DO NOT USE butter with the chocolate.  Keep hands cold and roll cherries in powdered sugar.  Pull fondant into a flat piece to wrap.  Use only fingertips.

This recipe turned out quite well, although after two weeks the filling was still not quite as gooey as I would have liked. When I made them a second time I soaked the cherries in a little bit of rum overnight. This added some extra moisture to the cherries. I also did not drain them for very long to keep more juice in the cherries. Finally I made the dough a little less stiff by adding some of the cherry juice. It made it a little harder to work with, but resulted in the inside liquifying much more readily. Maybe this was mostly a dry climate problem, but I felt like these changes made a hugh positive difference. I also used real chocolate and kept it at a fairly low temperature so it would keep its temper. This ended up putting a thicker coat on the cherries and mostly eliminated the problem of leaking out the bottom of the cherry. With the changes I just described, I would give the recipe five stars, but it was still very good as written.

These came out great!  It's only been 3 days and the fondant is liquifying.  I followed some of the directions given in the reviews.  Freeze between steps, it really does help.  They are good but still slightly off.  I'm sure it's the cherries.  The end product doesn't taste like the ones you buy at the store.  Any suggestions as to a brand or type of cherry to use?

These are absolutely delicious. everyone loves them and i always get tons of compliments on them. they r good when they sit for a few days to a week. I usually dip them in melted choc(with shortening) and put them right into little baking cups. They look pretty and really arent hard to make. Well worth the little bit of effort!!

I made these to give away for Valentines Day and everyone raved about how good they were but also commented on how sweet they were. I dipped mine in melted chocolate almond bark I'm thinking next time I might do semi sweet.

This was pretty easy to do...the only thing I found was that there just wasn't enough fondant to cover 60 cherries (I was able to cover 47).  I used one 12-oz bag of semisweet chocolate chips, which was enough to dip about 42-44 cherries--I ran out of room on my wax paper-covered cookie sheet after 42 cherries, so I ate the remaining 5 fondant-covered cherries.  Yum!  These were made as a gift for my father-in-law, so we'll see how he likes them (he loves his chocolate-covered cherries).

These are way better than the store-bought cherry cordials.  I also added cherry and almond extracts to the dough (about 3/4 tsp cherry and 1/4 tsp almond).  This recipe was way easier to make than I thought it would be.  Cherry cordials are my husband's favorite Christmas candy, so we'll definitely make this one a tradition.  Thanks!

These were wonderful - we couldn't stop eating them.  Used marchino cherries with the stems (3 10 oz. bottles).  I would not recommend using packaged chocolate that can just be zapped in the microwave (mainly for dipping fruits) as the chocolate is very inferior.  It is just as easy (and only slightly more messy) to melt chocolate chips etc. with shortening and you will definately like those results better.  Thanks for the great recipe.

These are awesome! I tried some with white chocolate almond bark which received rave reviews.  Good bye store bought cherries, this recipe is a definite keeper.  They make very nice gifts at Christmas as well.  Try the white chocolate! You'll love it.

These are awsome!. I used Bakers semi-sweet dipping chocolate on some and Dolci Frutta(a sweeter fruit dipping chocolate on the others.Next time I make them I plan on soaking the cherries in brandy or southern comfort first,sounds good doesnt it:).
Thank you for sharing this recipe.Its a hit.

I have a very similar recipe. Only difference is the addition of 1 tsp. almond extract. I make these over a 2-day period. After draining I place (upside down) on a tray in the freezer for a few hours. Then I "wrap" cherries and place back in the freezer overnight. The next day I pull approx. 10 out @ a time and place a round toothpick in the center of each for dipping. As soon as the cherry is completerly covered and I let excess drip off, I place carefully on waxed paper. I immediately "twist" the toothpick out for drying and move on to the next. When dry I place in paper cups. The next morning (left @ room temp) there is sometimes a little "drop" of liquid resting on top. I think it adds a little "character" to the cherry!

Made these CCC over the weekend.  My fondant was 3 T butter, 2 T corn syrup and 2 cups sifted flour.  Fondant made 26 covered cherries.  I made this fondant again ending with 52 covered cherries.  Froze cherries before wrapping fondant.  Then froze fondant coverd cherries before dipping.  Used 1 bag Nestles chips, 2 T shortening and 2 squares of White almond bark.  Used stemmed cherries for ease in dipping.  After dipped and set I pulled stem out, had to put on more chocolate to cover hole and then a little more chocolate on bottom (to prevent leaking).  They are curing now.  Husband tried one and said it was very good.  I am going to wait a week, hoping the center is a little liquid by  then.  Very easy to do.  Just very time consuming.  I love chocolate covered cherries and tasting the fondant and chocolate, they have to be awesome delicious.

I used this recipe on strawberries trying to duplicate chocolate covered strawberries from a candy store in Memphis.  Even though these were good, the fondant did not turn into syrup like I had hoped.  I am still looking for a recipe that will work.  Try this on strawberries, though, they do turn out good.

There is a misprint in the recipe but I think most of us can figure out what it was supposed to be. That being said, I have looked for years for this recipe. I can remember my mom sitting at the table rolling 100's of cherries to give as gifts. Thanks for posting. I'm filing this one for next Christmas

"Best after 1 or 2 weeks" Seriously? I can't imagine them getting any better nor would I have the will power to wait. These were gone in 48 hours. My filling/cherry ratio was a little off but I applied a thicker wrap around the cherries in the beginning which led to a thin/sparse amount towards the end. Will definitely make these jewels again!

These taste just like the ones from the box...except even better. The filling was just enough for me to make two dozen. I coated them with milk chocolate instead of the confectioners' coating. They taste so great the first day; It's hard to believe but they are even better as they sit several days and let the center soften.

I have been making these for a couple of years now. Make sure that the cherries are drained quickly but not dried and the fondant layer is thin if you want it to liquefy. Chilling between the fondant step and the dipping step helps stop leaking, otherwise take a knife and spread a little more on the bottom after the chocolate sets. I always do one jar regular and one jar where I replaced the juice with dark rum a week before.

Last year i spent thirty dollars to get sugar free chocolate covered cherries for my dad for a christmas present.  So this year I decided to try making these.  I changed them though to make them with less sugar.  I took 2 cup of Splenda and put it in the blender with 4 tb plus a little more of cornstarch and blended until fine and used in place of the powdered sugar.  My dad also likes brandy, so I soaked the cherries in brandy overnight.  I also found it useful to freeze the cherries after coating with the filling before dipping in chocolate.  I dipped in milk chocolate.  Not totally sugar-free, but less sugar.

I loved making these! I used the "almond bark" microwave dipping chocolate, melted it in a coffee cup and dipped the cherries with a toothpick. They came out delicious and the whole family ate most of the first batch in a day!

I love this recipe.  It is a bit labor-intensive, but seeing my the look in my father's eyes everytime I present him with the fruits of this particular labor, I know it was time well-spent because he just adores Chocolate Covered Cherries and these are so much tastier than store-bought!

I just made these last night, and they look just like the picture! It took almost no time at all. I halved the recipe, and made use of the refrigerator in-between steps. By keeping the stems on the cherry while dipping, I got an almost perfect layer of chocolate. I pulled the stems out of the chocolate covered cherries after they were in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes. Only a small hole remained, and that and any cracking I covered with a drizzle of white chocolate, which makes them look extra fancy. They look so neat, I'm so excited to give them away! Thanks so much!

I have tried several chocolate covered cherry recipes & this was  the best. The mini paper cups are a great idea to put them in. We tried these throughout the entire 2 week "wait" time:0) We think they were best after 1 week & you need to be finished eating them at 2 weeks-  2 1/2 weeks. These are excellent & I will be making them again.

Oh my goodness, these were soooo incredibly delicious!!!  These will be a part of my holiday baking from now on!  No one could stop eating these once they started!  The only thing I would emphasize is that it is very important to drop these in paper candy cups as soon as you've dipped them in the chocolate coating.  I didn't do that.  I just put them on waxed paper to harden.  When I peeled them off the waxed paper, there was a little bare spot on the bottom of each of them where the chocolate hadn't covered the filling.  As the juices from the cherries mixed with the filling in each candy, the delicious liquid leaked out.  It made for a big mess.  A yummy mess, but definitely a big yummy mess!  :)  I think dropping them into paper cups instead of onto the waxed paper would help to keep the juices contained within the chocolate shell.

I'm not a fan of these, but everyone else who tried them said they were good.  I followed reviews along with the recipe. I put each chocolate dipped cherry into a mini muffin liner before refrigerating.  I also recommend to definitely refrigerate these for at least a day before dipping.  Even then, some fell apart once it hit the melted chocolate.

these are better than the bought ones-not as sweet. I used a mixture of semi sweet/ unsweetened dark chocolate to coat them. Next time I will chop up cashews to add to the chocolate-they will taste just like the "Blossom chocolate bar" Great recipe

I use fondant sugar instead of confectioners and I think it gives the inside a more creamier texture

These were very good and easy to make. 
I found it helpful to freeze the cherries (with the dough on them)before you dip them in chocolate so the dough won't melt off.

I get rave reviews everytime I make these.  To make things easier, I wrap the cherries in the sugar paste and freeze overnight.  Then, I cover them in chocolate WHILE STILL FROZEN and they set more quickly.  Always turn out wonderful.

Turned out wonderful! I used a little less powdered sugar coating on mine, and they turned out fabulous! I also drizzled white chocolate over the tops for looks. I gave these away as Christmas gifts. Thanks so much for sharing!

Oh my these are sooo good!!!  I didn't have enough fondant to cover all of my cherries, so next time I will make about 1 and 1/3 times the amount to cover all of my cherries.  Also, it is necessary to go back the next day and patch the holes before the liquid oozes out, or you will have unpleasant looking candies.  I didn't use candy coating because I'm not sure what kind of quality chocolate taste it would give, so I melted good chocolate with a little bit of shortening and it worked perfectly.  I will be making these every year!

These took a while to make, but they were the best darn chocolate covered cherries I've ever had!  I gave them away as part of a christmas cookie plate and they were the first to go.  Grandpa got his own plate of just cherries (his favorite) and they were gone in about 2 hours!!!

These were VERY easy to make, albeit a bit time consuming.  I would probably use a mix of dark and milk chocolate to coat next time as these are almost unbearably sweet with the milk chocolate.  I found the fondant mix much easier to apply by dipping my hands in cold water periodically.  My kitchen was also quite cool - about 60 degrees.  Definitely wait at least a day or two before eating.  They just keep getting better!

Excellent!  Even though my husband could only wait a day to taste one he said they are absolutely delicious.  I had to hide the rest so he didn't eat them all.

Best choc covered cherries! Just like the ones you buy in the store, Freezing the drained cherries and then freezing the fondant wrapped cherries made dipping them sooo easy! I used the Wilton Dark Cocoa candy to dip them in, would be even better (if that is possible) dipped in premium chocolate that is properly tempered.

These are great, I haven't tried them yet but I used to just dip the cherries in chocolate and those were good.  Another member suggested putting the cherries in to tiny truffle cups, that was brilliant!  also I added parafin wax so the chocolate doesn't melt if it's out of the fridge for an extended amount of time.  Also to make this recipe easier to handle I freeze the dough before I cover the cherries, and then after I cover the cherries I put them in the freezer again so the dough wont melt off in the chocolate when you dip them.  All in all a great recipe!!!

Yum!  I have never made anything like this before.  They were not difficult at all to make and they are so good.  I doubled the fondant recipe like someone else suggested.  If your going through the trouble of making them I would deffinatly double it.  Next time I will get the mini baking papers so they don't break when I try to move them.

I made these for my grandmother for Christmas, but my husband and I couldn't stop eating them!  I wish I knew how to add wax to chocolate candies so that they don't melt so easily - that is the only thing I would change.  These are very time consuming to make.

Phenomenal recipe!  You definitely have to keep the dough and cherries cold for better handling.  I've also marinated the cherries in rum overnight (in the freezer) for a spiked chocolate covered cherry.  Potent but delicious!

good. I used milk chocolate buttons. They were easy and very good. Next time I would soad the cherries overnight in port or something like that. I think that would be good.

I made these last night to give as Christmas gifts to my father and brother.  After wrapping the cherries in the sugar dough, I put the tray of them into the fridge for about half an hour.  I melted 1 pound of dark chocolate candy melts with 1/8 pound of paraffin wax and then tempered the mixture with 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  The flavor of the coating was perfect and they set up beautifully.  I double-dipped the cherries, then after removing the stems, I re-dipped the tops because several of them cracked as I was pulling the stems out.  I don't personally care for this kind of candy, so I had my daughters each taste one to tell me if the flavor was close to what they sell in the stores.  My older daughter said they were very close and my younger daughter said "Are you SURE you didn't get these out of a box from the store?!"  I can't wait to see what my dad and brother think of them after they've ripened for two weeks!

These were fantastic!  I made two dozen for our family get-together and came home with one left.  The second time I made these I added a little vanilla and will do so from now on.  I don't get how this recipe yields 60 cherries though. I used a teaspoon and had to double the filling to get enough for my two dozen.  Maybe I used too much? Either way, these are much better than anything you can buy at the store.  So glad to have this recipe!

I never use dipping chocolate because I think it tastes "fake".  I melt semi-sweet chocolate, temper it, and dip the cherries (after letting them sit in the fridge for several hours).  Messy, but this is the candy everyone wants me to make every Christmas!  Even my mom....and that's saying something.

i have made a very similar recipe to this before. they were a hit but when i went to make them i couldn't find my recipe. i found this one and it sounded the same, so i gave them a shot. i bought 4 jars of about 32 cherries..so about 120 cherries and doubled the filling recipe. i used a pound of the chocolate coating (almond bark) and a bag of semi-sweet chips with a Tbsp of shortening for the chocolate dip. they came out beautifully, i tried a couple of them, the taste is great, we'll see how they turn out in a couple of weeks! i'm hoping for a nice liquid-y center like the last recipe i used.

I have been making chocolate covered cherries for years. Last year I tried something a little different and I soaked the cherries overnight in bourbon to give them a slight liquor flavor. I'm not a bourbon drinker but these were eaten up very quickly. Excited to let this new batch "ripen" to see if the filling is nice and soft. Recipe was very easy!

I just made these yesterday, but tried one today (even though they are supposed to set for awhile), just to see how they tasted and they are delicious! Very easy to make, though pretty time comsuming, but worth the effort. I couldn't find the cherries w/ stems, so I just used regular cherries. To dip, I poked the chilled, wrapped cherry w/ a toothpick and dipped it into the chocolate, letting the excess drip off, and placed them on waxed paper to dry. Once dried, I drizzled them w/ additional chocolate to make them look pretty. I had no problems w/ leakage or anything, which was a good thing. I can't wait to try these once they have time to get all juicy! I will be using this recipe for my cherries from now on! Thanks for sharing. :)

I am still in awe of these babies. Not being at all an over the top chocoholic I made these mainly to understand how they are made and gain some experince in working with chocolate. I wasn't at all concerned that I would eat too many. Well, was I wrong. It's going down as one of my best tasting experiences. One bite is all that was needed to have me gasping in culinary bliss!

I had a hard time finding the confectioner's coating, so I used Ghirardelli chocolate chips as suggested by another reviewer and used the dark chocolate.  However, after a week or so they lost some of their shine.  Next time, I'll use the Ghriardelli candy making & dipping chocolate (another reviewer's suggestion) instead.  I'm hoping that will be more fool-proof and still taste great. I also left the stems on the first batch like the recipe says, but didn't like how the cherry juice leaked out at the stem. I took the stems off for the next batch,  and used 2 forks to dip the cherries. Takes a bit of practice, but I was happy with the result.  I still have to give this recipe 5 stars even though I didn't follow it exactly!

This is the BEST chocolate covered cherry recipe. I chill mine until firm and if its still too sticky I work in more powdered sugar. The trick is to not touch the cherry when you are wrapping it with the dough or your fingers will get all gummy and it makes a mess. I make this every year for Christmas and give away as gifts.My boss asked me if I would put them in a separate contained from the rest of th goody box this year. I asked her why and she said she was going to hide them from her husband. LOL Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I look forward to trying the recipe.  A tip for the leaky bottoms:  before dipping the cherries, have the wax paper ready. smear a little dab of the melted chocolate to about the size of a nickel where each finished cherry will rest. This reinforces the bottom so it won't leak. At least it works with other chocolates!

This recipe is awesome!! Although it did take me 4 days to make them beccause I a a new mommy, they are the best chocolate covered cherries I have ever had. To make it easier on myself i made the filling ahead and put it in the freezer to firm. I took 1 tsp of the chilled ( make sure its very firm) and rolled it into a ball, wrapped it around the stemless cherries and chilled till firm. I melted the chocolate in a doble broiler and lined a frozen baking sheet with mini cupcake liners I put 1/2 tsp melted chocolate in each liner then chilled till firm. Then placed chilled covered cherry on top then put 1 tsp melted chocolate on cherry and chilled until set. They have been sitting for a week now and are so juicy!! YUM!!

These weren't that hard to make for me!  I used a bag of melted Hershey's semisweet minichips.  I chilled the cherries and fondant (sp?) before wrapping them, then chilled them again on a cookie sheet covered with a layer of wax paper before dipping them, and right after dipping them I put them back on the cold cookie sheet with wax paper that had been in the freezer.  It helped the chocolate set almost instantly.  I had no problems with leaking and was able to mail them to my boyfriend 1000 miles away for Valentine's Day.  He really likes them and so do I!  I woudln't make these every week because they're a bit time consuming but they're great for special occasions.

These were awesome!  I never thought I would ever be making chocolate covered cherries.  I had no idea how the liquid got around the cherry.  I made these as a Christmas gift for my parents, and it was loved by all.  I just used the Wilton chocolate wafers (you can get at Wal-Mart, Michaels, JoAnns) in the candy/craft baking area.  I melted them in a double boiler and they were terrific.  After I had dipped them, I did go back and use a knife to spread more chocolate on the bottom and laid them on their side to harden quickly.  That way I was able to avoid any leaking out the bottom.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these today and they weren't very hard to make, just a little time consuming.
My tip to prevent the insides from leaking: I dipped the cherries in the chocolate like you're supposed to and let them harden up on wax paper. After I finished all of them I picked them up off of the wax paper. With the ones that got stuck I touched up the holes with chocolate and set them on their sides so that part could harden.
Also, when wrapping the fondant keep your hands/fingers wet. It gets very sticky. It feels slimy when your working with it but it does dry back out. 

I also bought the Wal-Mart band cherries and they were just fine.
Hope this helps!

These are AWESOME!! The filling tastes like a Cadbury Creme Egg....much more delicious than the usual boxed cherries. Take the advice of others to freeze the cherries, works great! Will make many times for the holidays. Thanks so much for the recipe!

These are sooo good! I soaked the cherries in brandy for a few days before making these. I well double dip the bottoms next time also. I used dark and semi sweet chocolate with 1 T. veg shortening that made the choc thinner and looked pretty. I am making these for christmas.

I made these to give out over Christmas, and I was bombarded with complements. People loved them. I used a good-quality bittersweet chocolate to coat, which I think contrasted with the sweet center very well. Next time I think I'll make half as-is and half with the cherries soaked in some liquer (Hazelnut, orange, bourbon, brandy, etc.) for some added boozy goodness/flavor. Thanks so much for sharing, you made me a star :).

Amazingly easy and delicious.  I didn't get these made early enough to sit for a week or so before my family Christmas celebration, but noone complained.  My only suggestion would be to make sure the "dough" is chilled because it gets very sticky as it warms up.

These only made it a week in our house.  They were ok when they were fresh, but tasted much better after a week.  Next time I’ll try to hold off for two weeks so the sugar dough has more time to liquefy.  I added 1/2 tsp of almond extract to the dough and I thought it was a nice touch.  The dough was extremely easy to work with.  I froze the dough covered strawberries for about an hour before coating.  I also used Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips mixed with a Tablespoon of shortening for the coating and it worked great.    Next time, I think I’ll soak the cherries in Kirsch and use Ghiradelli bittersweet chips for a more sophisticated variation.

The chocolate covered cherries tasted great. I got a lot of compliements on them. Everyone loved them. I used melted milk chocolate chips for the coating instead of the confectionery coating. With the listed ingredients for the dough, I could only wrap 42 cherries.

This recipe works great, but NOT as is! I had to knock a star off for that and the second I saw the pics I panicked about making these, as I usually make the fondant, but I wasn't in the mood to go through the trouble so I was looking for a recipe that had the creamy center without having to cook the fondant yourself. These are more sickeningly sweet, ESPECIALLY if they haven't liquidized yet! The trick to getting them to turn to liquid in this fondant is soaking them in liquor overnight the day before you make them. They turn out so juicy and heavenly! You can also customize them by changing up the liquors! Southern Comfort, Dragonfruit Bacardi, I have mine soaking in some Red Stag Black Cherry Bourbon Whiskey right now, and I will update with a photo when I can capture that liquid center of heaven everyone is complaining is missing!

I've made several batches of the 'original recipe' and can say they are a HUGE hit with my family. I made them for Christmas, both as Christmas Eve Dessert and as a gift for my mother (who LOVES chocolate covered cherries), and everyone loved them. I followed the recipe exactly and didn't QUITE get as many out of it as the recipe calls for, but I have no complaints. The fondant is easy to make in a stand mixer, and if you don't have baker's melting chocolate, simply combine chocolate chips and shortening (2 tablespoons shortening for every 2 cups of chips, according to Ghirardelli) in a bowl and microwave until melted. Works like a charm. I'll be trying some of the "flavored" fondants next, and look forward to making these again!

Have made this the last few years and just getting around to rating it now.  Wonderful treat!  Tastes just like the kind you buy in the store.  It is time consuming but knowing it's all fresh and hand made, makes it worth the time.  Wonderful idea for gifts.  I make a bunch of the filling in advance and just keep refrigerated and take it out as I need it.

I love this recipe!  So much better than the store bought kind and they're not hard to make.  
I did as the other reviewers suggested and put mine in the mini muffin foils.  I also added a tbsp of Chambord to the sugar confection.  I plan to try some other liquers next time I make these...and I will make them again!  
This year, I've made over 200.  I chill the confection before coating the cherries, and chill them again before coating in the chocolate.  I had no problems whatsoever doing it that way.  
I chose to use the mini foils and was glad that I had done that because they would have leaked like others had said.  I may try putting a drop of chocolate on my wax paper before placing the cherries.  I'm sure that would seal the bottoms just fine.  
Thanks for an amazing recipe!!  I'll enjoy the compliments when I hand out these cherries!  It's a keeper!

I just finished makeing these.  It is quite a job.  Maybe I should have added a little more of the sugar so it wouldn't be so sticky, but I was afraid it would change the flavor.  I havn't tasted them yet, got to let them "ripen" for a couple of weeks.  I do think it is quite expensive, though, as you can buy them for $1.00 a box.  Fun to make though.

Delicious!!  After letting the cherries dry on paper towels overnight,  I soaked them for 24 hours in some bourbon.  I then dried them overnight again on paper towels and proceeded with the recipe.  I let them sit in the fridge for 2 weeks and when they were ready...  SO good

So glad I decided to finally make these this year.  My husbands aunt makes them every year and they are my favorite!   A little time consuming, but not bad either.  Very easy for the most part. Thanks for a great recipe!

I used the chocolate disks as other reviews suggested and found them at Micheal's. I placed the cherries in individual paper cups.  After about 1 1/2 weeks the cherries were ready but well worth the wait. I was asked for the recipe by my neighbor she loved them.

Excellent.  Made for Christmas and everyone raved - loved that there was no "chemical" taste like in store bought.  Make sure the sugar coating is well chilled before dipping in chocolate, but very easy to make!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were a HUGE disappointment! My family loves chocolate covered cherries so I made these for Easter. First of all, I made them a week ahead to give them time to set up. They never got gooey and the longer they sat the worse they tasted. Second, they were just a pain in the butt to make! Wrapping them and dipping them took a lot of time, plus I had to dip them twice. I will never make these again!:(

These are AWESOME!  And way easier than I ever thought Chocolate Covered Cherries would be.  I only got about 48 out if it, but I probably used a bit too much dough on the first few cherries.  I only had a few that I had trouble getting the stems out of, so I kept those for myself.  I gave about 30 of them out as gifts for Christmas, and everyone who received them was very impressed.

Ok so these were soooo GREAT. But I had some issues with the sugar. It was fine if it was REALLY cold but the second it warmed up (like from my hands) it just got all sticky and stuck more to my fingers than the cherries so I had a hard time getting it to form an even layer. Then of course sense it was so temerpature sensitive it melted in the chocolate if it took me too long to fish it out. Any suggestions as to why my sugar mix didnt work well?? Otherwise GREAT RECIPE!

I gave 5 stars on other reviews. I am soooooo ready to make these. I need to make something for a baby shower next week, so I am going to make these with pink candy coins. I will update this review after the shower. I hope they last around here a week and a half before the shower!!!

5 stars for flavor.  We made these for Christmas gifts this year and then took the leftovers to a church supper - Word got out fast and they were completely gone in no time!
 Our only problem was wrapping the cherry in the fondant.  We ended up making them like peanut butter cups in the mini muffin pan.  The shape may not be right, but nothing oozes out after they have set up and I think people liked that extra bite of goodness that they had to take!

I made this for a Christmas party and they got rave reviews.  I personally don't like chocolate covered cherries, but wanted to make something different.  They are time consuming to make, but worth it according to my guests! I will be making them again.

I was looking for gift ideas and came across this recipe.  Chocolate cherries are a family favorite, and I'm the family baker- so I thought they'd be a hit.. They were! (Didn't last till the holidays though!)

Followed some tips from other reviews and came up with a few more.

- a tsp. of the syrup from the jar of cherries in the powdered sugar added a nice color/flavor.

- keeping everything cool is essential. Froze my cherries as was suggested, wrapped them and froze them again.  I took 5 out at a time to dip. Makes them much easier to work with. 

-my chocolate was a little too thick to dunk the cherries in (milk chocolate/bittersweet mix) so I thinned it out with a little milk and it was still thick enough to coat them, but loose enough to dip and pull them out easily.   

-I found using a shotglass for the chocolate was the perfect depth to dip and roll the cherries, and the chocolate didn't harden as fast as in a bowl or dish.  I kept my pot of chocolate on low heat and just added to the shotglass every 5 cherries or so.

-I used a pan lined with parchment paper, wiped the parchment with a little cooking spray and my cherries didn't stick at all.

-I had a butterknife on hand, and immediately filled any holes and smoothed out the cherries as I dipped them while the chocolate was still hot.

Super easy recipe once all the prep work is done and my family loved them.  Much better than store bought!

These were terrific to eat even right away! I would suggest buying the Great Value cherries from Walmart as another reviewer suggested. They are just much better because they are big and very juicy. My other cherries from the local grocery store were pretty small and not that juicy. Didn't make as good of a candy as the Walmart ones.

These are the best chocolate covered cherries I've ever had- I will never buy another box again and can't wait to give them out at the holidays!!!  My mom has been disappointed lately with the store bought variety because they don't have the juicy part, its the white pasty stuff- I know its all a matter of preference, but we prefer the juice by far- she asked me for the recipe and I know she'll love it as much as I do!!!

Overall good. The dipping into the chocolate part is alittle difficult. I can't get it to look nice and neat. Also, getting only one tsp of the dough around the cherry is hard. I would recommend freezing in between each step. But good flavor. Will definitely make again.

These were great. Instead of using cherries with stems I used stemless cherries and placed them in small paper cups.

These are SO good.  I make them every year for Christmas.  One thing though-if you are going to go to all this trouble, please use a good quality chocolate.  You'll never want another chocolate covered cherry from a box.

I have always wanted to learn how to do these. The recipe is wonderful. I made them on last week, and my sister-in-law wanted to try them and i let her, she wanted to take some with her, and i told her, they had to set for atlease a week or two. So on today i let my husband take some to work and he just could not believe how good they were. I will be making these again and again. Thank you.

Wonderful! I didn't use stemmed cherries. I made some in my candy mold & the others I just dipped the candy into the chocolate using a fork to manage the candy. *Chocolate needs to be solid around the candy or as it ripens it will leak.

I made these for the holiday season, and MAN are they delicious!  My dad is a huge fan of these, so he absolutely loved them.  My sister-in-law and I had to "sample" them before we could give them out.  This one will definitely be used in the future!

I had never tasted a traditional chocolate covered cherry before, but my boss and mother in law both mentioned that these are their favorite candies sometime this past summer so I decided to go out on a limb and make these as Christmas gifts.  Lucky for me both my boss and mother in law said they were perfect!  I was unable to find cherries with stems (shame as it would have made dipping much easier!) but I did find a chocolate coating in a microwavable tray which made things a bit easier.  One batch made ~30 cherries for me so I'll be sure to make a double batch next year!

I found it much easier to freeze my cherries and chill the filling before putting them together, just take enough cherries out to do so they do not start to thaw, then I popped them back in the freezer to set up and dipped them in chocolate, very easy and they went together like a dream.

This recipe is really well loved. I wanted to point out that tempering chocolate, and using a chocolate mold that is shiny/polished with a soft cloth will help real chocolate retain its shine. Anyway it seems like these candies will go fast and that is another  way to solve a problem.

I don't know what everyone else did that i didn't, but this recipe just did not work out. I spent a good hour and half trying everything to make this work but the only thing that went right was the filling. I dipped my cherries in chocolate and after so many cherries, the chocolate went all weird and stiff and wouldn't melt back down. then when i finally had all my cherries dipped, i tried pulling the stems out, but then the whole cherry just popped out of the chocolate coating. The cherries tasted fine, but overall this was a horrible waste of time.

So easy to work with!! this fondant tastes good and is so easy.  I made it along side the top rated recipe from another site that called for margarine, sweetened condenser milk, and vanilla.  I liked the flavor of the other one slightly better, but this one was so much easier to work with.  a HUGE help came from a tip i found to FREEZE THE CHERRIES before wrapping... genius! so much easier :)

excellent recipe thank you

I made these last year as a Valentine's date, and even though we couldn't really enjoy them for two more weeks, it was really fun! We substituted honey for the corn syrup (it is a little sweeter, but we substituted 1:1 anyway), and they turned out really wonderfully!

I have never made anything like this before but this was a very easy recipe and very good.  I made a couple of modifications:  First, I added about a teaspoon of almond flavoring to the batter.    Second, I rolled the cherries in coconut after covering with the batter.  They were very good.  I think they tasted even better after sitting for about a week.  I highly recommend this recipe.

These taste exactly like what you would you buy in a candy shop! I made exactly as written and they were perfect after two weeks.

My grandma used this same recipe years ago and the cherries were wonderful. I just made a batch today and the one thing was the sugar coating not setting up. I added about one tablespoon extra of butter and cherry juice and it came together in about 3-4 minutes and actually looks like a fondant. I'm taking another reviewer's hint and put the cherries in small baking cups after dipping them.

I tried making these cherries for my dad and we loved them. I actually had to go and make more. Next time I will dip the bottom of the cherries one more time before serving but they were excellent.

Ok let me start off by saying WOW!  These little guys are amazing! The only change to the recipe I made was the chocolate. First I tried milk chocolate, then dark. The milk chocolate tasted better.  Next time, I'll try adding vanilla flavoring or another flavor to the sugar/syrup mixture. *Well worth the wait and effort!

tasty.  make sure not to leave holes when covering with chocolate.  It will spring leaks easily.  Do not leave sit for a couple weeks, as they leak.

Absolutely amazing!  Made these for my close friends & co-workers as part of a holiday gift box & everyone loved them.  Way better than what you would buy at the store.  Thanks so much for a great recipe! Will definitely become a holiday tradition.

These are pretty as a gift- but way too much effort to just make for myself. I had trouble getting the "dough" to a point where I could wrap it around the cherries. I had to add extra sugar and pop it in the freezer for a while. I then put the cherries in the freezer for several hours and took them out one at a time (because otherwise they just melted) to dip them.

Awesome recipe, and so easy!  I used 2 cans of cherries, which turned out to be about 55.  The fondant was very easy to work with.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips melted with a little shortening and put the cherries in mini foil cups.  Served them at a Valentine's party I had, everyone loved them!  They really do get better with age. I know it's hard, but try to save them at least 10 days!

Oh my God!  These are so awesome.  I cannot believe I can make these at home!  They truly are as good or better than what you get in the store.  We couldn't wait two weeks for them to ripen, ate them all in a few days and made more.  The recipe only makes 30 for me rather than 60, but just double it up.  Really fantastic - thanks so much for a great recipe that I will make over and over again.

Most people would not wait even 1 week, and they all said these are the best chocolate covered cherries, even better than Harry & Davids. Fantastic! I really used too much fondant when wrapping my cherries, and adjusted it as I went along, my kids ate the one's with too much, and adored it!

I added more icing sugar because, even though I cooled the dough, it was still too sticky.  I have made these every year,  with my Christmas chocolates, for about 7 years...I love them.

Thanks to the reviewer who mentioned 1 tsp  of fondant for each cherry. Two things I did differently, I added 1/8 tsp almond extract to the fondant dough and I used about 2 TBLS  less powdered sugar in the dough because the extract seemed to immediately stiffen the dough.  My dough came out perfectly smooth and pliable and I had no problem wrapping each cherry. I did briefly freeze the wrapped cherries and then took just a few out at a time to dip them in the chocolate because the fondant quickly begins to melt when it hits that warm chocolate. Then I immediately returned the dipped cherries to the refrigerator. I just made them today and sampled one that wasn’t perfect. Awesome amazing flavor! I am sure once the fondant becomes a liquid they’ll be even better!

Amazing recipe . A definite crowd pleaser.  I added a few pinches of Madagascar Vanilla and a dash of one other thing I will not tell lol to give it that pizzazz that makes you say wow  heck yeah to the filling to make it my own after trying it following the recipe. I passed some out to some of the customers at the shop of both and on of the customers said "wow, now that's a party in my mouth!!!" after eating a cherry from the off beat batch

Same as others, the white mixture was gooey and was not able to be kneaded.  Even after adding extra powdered sugar and chilled 24 hours.

I love chocolate covered cherries and made these to share at the office.  They turned out AMAZING on my first try! I may never buy boxed cherries again!  The tip is to keep cooling the cream when you are wrapping the cherries, and also to roll them in your hand. I used the Baker's dipping chocolate you find in the produce dept to dip strawberries in.  It's in a small bowl, and It worked awesome!

I followed the recipe exactly; it's an easy one, but time consuming. These are delicious little treats, but incredibly (like wowza!) sweet — eat a few at a time or you'll have to get into the Gravol ;).

I have made these for 12 years now and they are perfect. I skipped one year and everyone was disappointed. The only thing I do really recommend, is make them 3-4 weeks ahead of time to be certain the center is gooey and perfect. Thanks for this show stopper for Christmas goodies.

I don't know why I waited until I was 68  to make these things - they were ssssoooooo easy! Really!  The mixture that I was to roll the cherries in behaved exactly like it was supposed to. I tasted 2 of them and will have trouble waiting 1 or 2 weeks for them to mellow.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have tried about 3 other recipes and these are the best and easiest.  Have made for several years now with no issues.  Went exactly by recipe (except I didn't sift sugar) and had enough to cover a medium jar.  I always drain cherries well and put in freezer for 30 minutes or so while mixing filling.  I also use a mixer to combine this along with a teaspoon of whatever flavoring.  I have used almond, Mexican vanilla, Kahlua , and peppermint.  The mint wasn't so great, but didn't stop anybody from devouring anyway!  I used too much. After mixing, put that in the freezer for 10 minutes or so to firm up.  I used a teaspoon scoop, lightly formed a ball, and backside to dent and thin filling, put in cherry, close and roll in my hands.  Do as quickly as you can and lay on parchment paper cookie sheet and put back in freezer while melting chocolate. If it gets sticky in your hands, it's not cold enough.  Just return to freezer a few minutes to re-chill and roll on.   I used Ghirardelli melting chips in double boiler with 1 t. instant coffee, no shortening.  I use a toothpick to dip cherries with and cover hole or a fork if I do a lot at one time as it's quicker.  I use cherries without stems as you can't roll covered cherry in hand with those.  A glass of white zin with a straw is usually close to assembly line.  Lovely, fun recipe to do with friends or your favorite music.

I've been making these for years and are my most requested item.  I used to only make for Christmas but people beg for them so now I make them about 3 times a year because they are so time consuming.  This year I made my own maraschino cherries, I honestly thought that this recipe couldn't get any better until making them with homemade maraschino cherries.  
Thank you for the recipe, you've made a lot of people happy!

I expected this to be difficult and I was really wrong.  The actual making went smoothly - popped in fridge and then later in chocolate.  I used the stemmed cherries and they turned out very well, dropping them right from the chocolate into little cups.  Very pleased with the ease and the end product

Came out pretty great, i think i did 1/3 the recipe and i used milk chocolate, which maybe made them a bit too sweet. Will try again in dark. :)

I'm not a huge fan of chocolate covered cherries, but my husband is.  We've been married 20 years and I've always given him this candy at Christmas, but it has gotten nearly impossible to find the "good" kind, so I thought I would try this recipe.  WOW!  I found organic (no artificial color added) cherries but they didn't have a stem so I used a toothpick and drizzled a bit of the melted chocolate to cover the hole.  I made them three weeks in advance and the filling turned a nice liquid just like the good brands used to be.  I may become a fan of this candy yet!  Thanks so much to the cook that posted this!

These are delicious and a fantastic recipe. However, the servings are way off, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. We did it exactly as directed, using a teaspoon (maybe even less) for each cherry, and we still only made it through 30 cherries. We made an additional batch of the filling, and ended up with 59 cherries. 

Two changes/variations we have tried that I would highly recommend. In the basic recipe, add 1 teaspoon of almond extract. Or, as a different variation, soak the cherries overnight in bourbon, and add a teaspoon of bourbon to the filling. 

I make my own chocolate dip by melting 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips with 3 Tablespoons Crisco (not butter or margarine). I personally think it tastes better than some of the other dipping chocolate options out there.

The only change I made was to use milk chocolate chips (about 2 cups) with 2-3 TBSP of shortening (because that's what I had on hand) A few tips! 1) The instructions say to refrigerate the fondant if it needs stiffening up. Even after doing so, mine rapidly became so sticky it was impossible to wrap the cherries. I threw caution to the wind and simply kept putting in powdered sugar until the dough was pliable and workable...like bread dough...even at room temp. It was so, so much easier to wrap the cherries, and I could discern no difference in the taste of the fondant (I mean, it's already 99% sugar anyways!). 2) I was in a rush to get somewhere, so I stuck my just-dipped cherries in the freezer on a cookie sheet. I completely forgot about them until hours later, and I was really worried that when I took them out to thaw, they'd be covered in wet condensation. Well, they didn't...and as an added bonus, they popped right off the waxed paper/cookie sheet (when frozen) with no "holes" or leakage whatsoever on the bottom as experienced by so many reviewers. They were perfect! In short 1) keep adding powdered sugar until you can manage the fondant easily at room temp and 2) freeze the cherries after dipping to allow for easy removal after setting. FYI: If you use cherries with stems, it's a pain to try to drizzle any additional decorative chocolate on top because the stems get in the way. They actually look prettier without the drizzle if you leave the stems on, but they look pre

I have been looking for a recipe of a candy that my hubby has loved from a local candy maker that had gone out of business. This recipe seemed very close so I tried it. However the candy was a chocolate covered strawberries. So I swapped cherries with strawberries and it's perfect. A little messy but I have never made candy before. And I think with time I can get better.

Chocolate covered cherries are my all time favorite treat! I made these per this recipe, obviously with my chocolate cherry addiction I couldn't wait the whole week or two for them to mature so I have tried them a few times. (haha) well I'm happy to say at day 4 the insides are starting to juice up and get gooey like they are suppose to be!! 
Next time I will use a little less dough on the cherries but all in all I will be making these again!!

I made these for a lady at work. It's her favorite candy and we are celebrating her birthday and since you can't find these in the store this time of year, I decided to make them. They were very easy to make. I am not a big fan of chocolate covered cherries but they don't taste bad at all and that's only an hour after having made them. I am anxious to see how they taste tomorrow. As for wrapping the cherries, I let them drain while I made the dough then after kneading the dough I rolled it out on a powdered sugar covered surface. I then used a small round cookie cutter that was about 1-1/2" in diameter to cut out forms to wrap around the cherries. So easy and I think much less time consuming. Overall, a good recipe that was easy to make. I was able to get an even 4 dozen cherries with this dough recipe. Thanks Meredith.

My first attempt at making chocolate covered cherries!  Halved the recipe to yield 30 cherries. Used pkg. semi-sweet morsels with 2 tbs of shortening. Dipped half of cherry to build bottom. Put in freezer for few minutes. Then dipped entire cherry. Repeated for triple dipped! Used skewer for dipping, covered hole and drizzled more chocolate over cherries. Kept on wax paper until done dipping. Places each in mini cupcake paper. Realized afterwards mini cupcake pan would be ideal to use for a formed base instead of allowing chocolate to spread on wax paper. Put In Airtight  container in refrigerator. Will check after a week to determine if center is liquified. Great recipe. Can't wait to try one ~ but will!

We made these for Chrismas and they turned out wonderfully. Per some of the suggestions, we made some modifications: Juisy cherries make a huge difference! We just drained ours and ran them lightly over a papertowel just before dipping. The sugar won't dissolve into a gooey filling without the juice. If you prefer a more solid center, then drain well. We found rolling the sugar filling into small balls and squishing them flat between wax papers with a glass bottom made it much easier to wrap each cherry individually. We placed each wrapped cherry on a chilled cookie sheet covered in wax paper to keep them chilled. After dipping, each cherry was placed in a mini candy cup to prevent leakage. They do leak somewhat unless you take extra time and care to redip each bottom. We then froze them over night to set them and then transferred to an air tight container and left in a cool place away from wandering children and husbands. After a week, the centers had liquified and tasted decadent!

Instead of the "dough" I use almond paste. Wrap the cherry with the paste and dip into hot chocolate using stem. The longer they cure the better. Once opened up you will be surprised to see a liquid filling and the taste is out of this world!!!!I make these babies in November for Christmas gifts.

These were great and so easy!!  The only change I would make would be to use a substitute for butter.  The butter flavor was not something I wanted to taste in my chocolate covered cherries.  I also just melted chocolate chips in the microwave instead of confectioners coating because I didn't have any.

these turned out pretty good although time consuming, i followed recimmendations to leave sit 2weeks to allow syrup to form inside, some weere perfect others were still a bit dry but overall they were a big hit

I actually have not gotten to make these yet.  Do you use real butter, salted or unsalted.  Do not understand why the recipes never include this information.

My daughter and I made these yesterday.  They were gone last night!  They tasted great. They did not look as good as the picture. A little difficult to roll and dip, but the taste is really great! I will make again!

It took a few mess ups to get the hang of it, but I found that if I keep the cherries in the fridge, and pull them out one at a time to dip them in the chocolate (I used Wilton Candy Melts) they don't melt.  It is going to be torturous to wait the 2 weeks to eat these. They taste so good already.

I made these for my friends this Christmas and they loved them! I had to keep my boyfriend from eating them all! Regular-old chocolate chips and wax helps them from turning funny.
