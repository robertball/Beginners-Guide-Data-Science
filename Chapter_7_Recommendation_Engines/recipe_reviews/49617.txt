This recipe was great!  But, I did make some changes.  I decreased the amount of Brown Sugar mixed into the fruit to 3/4 Cup.  The CRISP mixture I thought was odd.  All other crisps I have ever made had sugar in that part of the recipe.  I made it as directed (melted butter and no sugar) and it was mushy, tasted horrible.  and was not crumbly as it says on the recipe.  So I threw that whole mess away and started the CRISP part over.  I used the exact same ingredients and added 1/2 Cup Brown Sugar to the CRISP mixture and DID NOT melt the butter.  The mixture then did get crumbly and when baked it was VERY CRISP.  Hope this helps.

4 stars for the apple-raspberry part, as that was very tasty.  However the crisp part was very bland, which may have been my fault because I added more flour as it was a big mushy mess.  If I try it again, I will add the sugar to the crisp part as the previous reviewer suggested.  I also used mixed berries (blue, straw & rasp) and that went great with Breyers vanilla ice cream.  Thanks for the sweets Cindi!

I made this for a family dinner and it was fantastic with vanilla ice cream. I increased the recipe by 3 and followed the suggestions of the previous review that added brown sugar to the apples and cut the butter into the topping mix instead of melting it first. It really made an excellent topping. The raspberries gave it a nice tartness to the dish too.

Correction: The butter is melted in this recipe, and is stirred into the flour and oat mixture, not cut in as previously published.

I followed the recipe and made the crisp according to the suggestions made previously to add extra brown sugar and NOT melt the butter. It came out great, nice and crumbly. Unfortunately, my only complaint is that the apple raspberry filling was tasty, but runny. I don't remember reading where any one else experienced this, so I guess that it was something I did. The dish, however, tasted wonderful.  I'll certainly try it again.  Note: I mixed a little corn starch with the excess liquid and baked an extra 5 minutes. This "thickened up" the filling a bit. It still was a real hit!

Too sweet if recipe is followed.  Use 1/2 sugar with apples, then add sugar to the crisp mix, along with chopped walnuts.  Extra raspberries work too.  I cut butter in cold to the crumble mixture.

Delicious!  I added some extra raspberries and put in fewer apples.  A little too much cinnamon in the topping.  Definitely something I'll make again.  Thanks for sharing it!

This was good, but without the crisp, it can't be great in my book.  Also, I would add a little more flour to the apple-raspberry mixture; the final product was too thin.  I agree other reviewers that the raspberries are a nice change of pace.

I made this recipe as without substitution. I knew that it wasn't going to taste like my usual crisp (in which I use more oatmeal and I put the sugar in the crisp) but I was open to trying something new. And I LOVE it. 

An open mind is the only ingredient missing from the original post. Thanks for sharing!

Made this with apples and blackberries. It was the only "crisp" recipe I've used that had the sugar in the filling and not in the "crisp". While it was OK I much prefer the sweetness in the topping.

I just used 1 cup brown sugar, but split it between the apples and the topping.  The flavor is wonderful.  I didn't have Granny's, so I used what I had on hand, which happened to be a sauce apple.  I am a lazy cook (Ok, not really, just a busy cook with a 9 month old to entertain) so I didn't even bother peeling the apples.  Everyone at our house is just happy to have dessert, so no one is complaining.  :-)

I made this recipe for dessert tonight for Father's Day and everyone loved it!  I basically followed the recipe as written, but like most have said, I added half cup of brown sugar to the fruit mixture and half cup to the topping mixture.  Only problem was, it was a bit too sweet.  I may only add a quarter cup to the fruit next time and half cup to the topping.  Also, I'd like to try fresh raspberries.  Last, I'd like to double the servings, since it was six adults and I think my brother could have probably ate the whole crisp himself. :)  Thank you for a different dessert to make.

This was a good crisp - the raspberries were a great idea.  Next time I will use less brown sugar- it was awfully sweet and syrupy.  Also, I used a full container of raspberries (I believe it was 6 oz) which is more than a cup and used an 8x8 pan instead of a 9x9, so it was pretty full of fruit - made 4 large servings.  I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour for the topping and you couldn't tell the difference (sneak in a little extra nutrition!).  I agree that the topping wasn't really crunchy either.  I'd make this one again!

This crisp tasted rich and good; I liked the brown sugar instead of white. The instructions say to cut in butter which has been melted (?) -so I did not melt it but cut it in cold. The fruit did not quite fill the pan enough, so I recommend using at least one more apple. Also, the oats were a little tough and distracted from the topping. I love apple crisp, and adding raspberries makes a nice change from the "usual". Topping does not actually get very "crispy".

This really was not for me.  I made this a month or two ago, and froze it.  I didn't taste it then in case I was going to bring it somewhere.  I am glad I didn't.  I defrosted it in the fridge for about 2 days.  It was horribly runny and extremely tart.  The crumble tasted awful with the cinnamon, I think there was too much.  The flavors did not balance at all.

The fruit in this was very good but the crisp part was not. The topping DID NOT need the salt. I added more brown sugar and less flour. Sorry, but i won't be using this recipe again.

I modified this quite a bit - used 1.5 pounds frozen mixed berries, no apples - kept the juice left from defrosting and added 1/2 cup agave nectar and 1/8 cup cornstarch. For the topping I chopped pecans and walnuts, 1/2 cup each, and combined with oats, whole wheat flour, cinnamon, salt, and substituted unsweetened applesauce for the butter. I baked it for only 25 minutes, and it was nice and thick, and the nuts were slightly toasted. Loved it! Next time when I have apples, I'll try it with apples.

I've made this 3 times now. It was ok... you "have" to add sugar to the topping mix for it to be worth while. But it was easy to make. I did find a better recipe however, so I wont ever make this one again. Sorry.

This was good - but with the changes I made. I doubled the recipe. The recipe only calls for the brown sugar to be added to the fruit and none to the crisp. I just added the tbsp. of flour to the crisp and the brown sugar - which I reduced a bit to the crisp topping. I also followed a review and kept the margarine (i used smart balance - non-heydrogenated margarine)and did not melt it - in order to ensure a crisp - crisp! (I cut down on the margarine a bit as well - incorperated it until slightly damp and crumbly.

I only used one large granny smith apple.  I also used two pints of fresh dorman red raspberries, and about 1 1/2 cupst of frozen rhubarb chunks.  Everything else I kept pretty much the same as the recipe.  I did add a bit more oats, because once you add the melted butter, it's mush, not crumble for the topping.  Adding more dry oats helped it crumble and spread over the top more evenly.

My family LOVED this.  From a 19 month old up to my 10 year old, and my dad who was visiting.  We served it warm with vanilla ice cream.  A BIG hit.  The kids asked me to make it again!!!

Really good recipe and got a request to make another one for a pot luck next week.  Was a bit runny, but didn't matter when topped with vanilla ice cream!

The apples and raspberries were fantastic. The crisp was bland.  I will add sugar into the crisp next time.  Otherwise, great recipe.

Absolutely wonderful! I used frozen raspberries in syrup, so I decreased the amount of sugar added to the apple/raspberry mixture. The syrup made the mixture a lot soupier, so it wasn't really a traditional apple crisp texture, but in my opinion it was even better.  Because of the extra liquid, I raised the oven temperature for the last 20 minutes to 400 degrees. Based on the other reviews, I ignored the crisp topping in the recipe and used another recipe for the crisp part. Will definitely make this again.

Loved this. Followed other suggestions and cut back on the sugar in the apples and added it to the oatmeal mixture. Also did not melt the butter as suggested. Top with vanilla ice cream and it was so good!

the sugar is only in the filling with none in the crisp topping.  Big mistake!  The filling is OVERLY SWEET and the topping tastes only of cinnamony flour.

It was a wonderful recipe. However, I added more oats (because I like more of course) and also sprinkled brown sugar on top before throwing it in the oven. The raspberries left a lot of liquid that I ended up pouring into a bowl for a berry syrup I made later. All around a good recipe. Just tweaked it a bit.

This was the first time I have made this receive and it turned out really well except I had quite a bit of liquid at the bottom. I am not an experienced baker so not sure why this happened. I took previous comments about the butter and the brown sugar in the crisp part... Deleicious!!

I made it as the recipe stated and it is overly sweet and the topping (crisp?) is not crisp at all. The topping is tasteless and uneatable.  Wasted all those beautiful apples.. Do NOT bother with this recipe as printed..

This was a really good recipe. The only thing I changed was I doubled up on the topping only to satisfy my personal taste.

Since posting this recipe, I see there was an error to the pan size I used to make this desert. Be sure to use an 8x8-inch baking pan. (Mine was also a Teflon coated pan.) Also, when mixing the brown sugar with the tablespoon of flour, be sure to just use a 1/2 cup of the sugar. Mix the remaining 1/2 cup of brown sugar along with the oats, the 1/2 cup of flour, the cinnamon, and salt. Continue preparing the recipe by adding in the melted butter, and stir until mixture is crumbly. After baking the desert, I let it sit to cool for (about) 1 to 1-1/2 hours. This desert can also be served with vanilla ice cream or with Cool Whip or Reddi Wip Whipped Topping. This recipe yields: 1-8x8 inch dish, or 5-6 servings. One more thing... you can substitute quick oats for the old fashioned oats, and about the apples, be sure to use 2-1/2 lbs. of Granny Smith Apples.

Doubled the recipe to make three small crisps, one to keep and two to give away. Used the ideas from previous posts to make sure crust turned out right- and it worked. Basically used Hal  the sugar and a tablespoon of flour in the berry apple mix and the other Half in the other ingredients, including cutting in cold butter, for the topping. Baked at 350 for 45 minutes and crisps were perfectly done and delicious. Would make again.

I had never seen a recipe without sugar in the crisp, so I changed it by adding 1/2 cup  to the fruit mix and the other half cup to the crisp mix.  Also decreased the butter called for to 5 tablespoons and cut it in, not melted, and it turned out fantastic.  I also subbed 1/2 cup blueberries and 1/2 cup blackberries (which is what I had in the freezer), and with the modifications it's definitely a keeper.
