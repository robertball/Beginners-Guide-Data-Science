I found this rather bland even with the Tom and Basil sauce, perhaps next time would season the meat and/or add onion.

I had no problem with this recipe as others claimed to have. I actually used less sauce than the recipe calls for and it was more than plenty. I used a whole wheat penne and I just added some chopped fresh onions, garlic, and basil leaves to the cheese mixture. I will be making this recipe again!

I found this rather dry and bland. If I made this again I would add Italian spices and more marinara sauce.

Was totally fine. Made it to use up leftovers (sauce from spaghetti, ricotta from manicotti, leftover angel hair, ground beef that we'd cooked because we had to before it was too late). Our sauce starts w/Classico Tomato/Basil then hubs adds sausage, garlic & onion, added fresh parsley, basil & a pinch of salt to the ricotta, then chopped up the angel hair a bit. We had to use a mixture of mozzarella, cheddar & jack cause we only had small amounts of each, then layered as directed, eyeballing the amount of sauce. Tasted like lasagna to us. We enjoyed it, our granddaughter "Chef Ava" loved it!

A quick, easy meal with the taste of lasagna.  Only modification was to reduce the amount of cheeses used.  As someone who grew up eating authentic Italian, this was a quick and easy weeknight meal.  Thank you for sharing.

The proportion of ricotta was way too high in relation to meat sauce, which made it very dry. Rather bland, too, as others have noted.

Discovered I was out of lasagna noodles, so I found this recipe and adapted it.  Used small shells, no meat, extra pasta and mozzarella. and flavorful tomato-based sauce.  Yum!  I like this recipe better than lasagna.  It's a real comfort food.
