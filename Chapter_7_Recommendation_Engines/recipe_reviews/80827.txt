This is one of our new fave's.  Instead of broiling it, I bake it at 375 for about 45 minutes,stirring every 15 minutes or so.  This way, you don't have to deal with smoking!  This gives you time to prepare rice or noodles and you've got a fantastic meal ready in less than an hour. Yummy!!

This is the way to cook this meal-

I made this for lunch today! I used half the butter and i baked it in the oven first for 35 min on 375 degrees turning it over half way through and then i broiled it for 5 min on each side. It turned out perfect. I would recommend before you put it in the broiler put it onto a flat baking tray on top of foil without the juices just place the chicken on it because that is what causes the smoke to fill the house.

I've never checked the recipe after I put it up...Thank you all for your ratings.  I must say, I usually broil either boneless, SKINLESS theighs or just a whole split chicken. I don't know why it ended up saying "with skin".  The theighs are much less fatty if they're skinned...but the whole split chicken is just beautiful when it's presented on a serving platter garnished with more parsley. Again, thank you & enjoy!

I made this recipe last night for my family, but with a twisit. Instead of using chicken thighs. I used chicken breasts, boneless, skinless and sliced. I only cooked them for about 10 minutes. 
They turned out wonderful!!! I served plain rice with it. We made more of the sauce to put on top of the rice. My family are hugh garlic nuts. We love ANYTHING with GARLIC!!
 TRY THIS RECIPE TONIGHT it'll be a hit with your family too!!!! :)

Very good! I used 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup butter, and rosemary instead of parsley.  Also bone-in thighs, and broiled with rack set at second from top for about 30 minutes.  This recipe got rave reviews from even my very picky son!

Very good, certainly easy and quick. The only thing I would suggest for some people is to use a light-salt soy, I found the regular soy sauce to be too salty for me.

These were good.  I am always amazed at the reviews that have not done the recipe as is given.  They are rating their own concoction - not the one submitted.

I usually bake this at about 370 degrees or so until its not pink anymore inside.

I put mushrooms on top of the chicken and put some parsley on top of the mushrooms. Looks and tastes a lot like it's from an expensive restaurant. That's what my mom said anyway.

This is a great recipe!!  My husband and child loved it.  I mixed equal parts of Worchestershire and the soy sauce.  I also baked it at 350 for abour 20 minutes and then broiled it for 10 minutes.

Top ratings for speedy prep and a tasty, juicy piece of chicken. I used boneless, skinless thighs, pounded them as others suggested, broiled them close to the heat for about 5 min. per side, and they were ready by the time the rice was done. Pounding them thin eliminated the need others mentioned to bake them part of the time. I tried to cut calories by using half the butter called for, and while the sauce was a bit thin, the flavor was still good. My husband realy liked them too. Thanks, Ava!
*Edited to add: I made this again tonight but decided to add a tablespoon of honey to the sauce recipe. Well, let me tell you that my sauce caught fire under the broiler. So if I do that again, I'll be broiling it a bit farther away!! :( no chicken tonight.

Becoming a "new" single man at 65 and not having done much cooking for quite a few years I ran across this recipe in a search for what to do with packages and packages of frozen bone in chicken thighs that my daughter picked up at Costco to make sure the dad had enough food in the house to last until her next trip home from college! Although I didn't have everything for the proper recipe I used a little sesame oil and mesquite seasoning for the thighs. I did the "bake and then broil" method at 375 for 40 min and then another 5 minutes with broil and a touch of Louisiana terriaki sauce for the crisping time. Served with wild rice and steamed broccoli I was quite surprised at just how delicious this turned out with enough left for 2 more meals. Kudos for posting this....It's quick, easy and even a klutz in the kitchen can make it without a screwup...
 Thank you!

This recipe is not fussy or complicated, seriously a monkey could make it, but it IS simple, FAST, cheap, and DELICIOUS.     Follow the instructions EXACTLY--- DO micro the sauce... do it in a pyrex pan (just one dish for it all!)... something magical happens in there... don't be afraid of the bubbling action, it is GOOD action!  And it's best with FRESH parsley (2-3x the dry amt) and fresh cracked pepper.  When broiling, get your oven nice and hot and when you put the chicken in keep oven CLOSED while on high broil (not propped open how you might sometimes on broil), and put the chicken on a middle to lower rack.     I always have these ingredients on hand and love chicken thighs so this will go down on my permanent record...  actually, it's so simple I think I have it memorized after making it a few times now!

We liked this chicken a lot. It is simple, and easy to prepare. Per another couple of reviews,  we subbed balsamic vinegar for half of the soy sauce (gf tamari in our case), and added some dried rosemary. We used a few thinly  pounded breasts and several drumsticks. It baked for 40 min at 350. This would be great with mashed potatoes or rice. I enjoyed mine with parmasean crusted zucchini fries. My husband asked me to bookmark this recipe, which is fairly unusual. Thanks for a great recipe. Oh, as for those who hate reveiws where the recipe has been altered, please  understand this: I change most everything I make just a bit to suit our needs and/or tastes. I will continue to reveiw in order to show appreciation for those who took time to share recipes, and hopefully to help others here and there.

This is very good. Super-easy and everything I always have on hand. I used bone-in chicken and baked @ 375 for about 45 minutes, then broiled for 5-10 more. The meat was very tender & juicy. When our plans changed last minute, I threw everything into a ziploc and left it to marinade overnight, which worked fine, just had to warm sauce a bit to get it back in the pan (butter had solidified again). I do think it needed just a tad more kick, so next time I will add some cajun seasoning (salt-free) or maybe red pepper.

Fantastic recipe!  I used a big pack of boneless skinless thighs (about 15), and doubled everything in the recipe but the butter. I then unravelled the thighs (too lazy to pound them thin), dipped them each in the marinade, placed them on a foil lined cookie sheet and dumped the rest of the marinade on top so I wouldn't have to bother basting.  Then I sprinkled some extra spices on top (onion powder, pepper and Mrs. Dash table blend), stuck them in the oven on the second shelf from the top, and broiled on high.  After 10 minutes I turned them (they were half cooked and still soaking up the marinade!) and threw on a can of button mushrooms for the last 10 minutes.  I had a greased baking dish ready to transfer them to for when the "smokefest" started, but I didn't have any smoke at all!  I also discovered that I didn't have any parsley but the chicken was fabulous regardless.  Easy, quick and tasy. Everyone loved it. I will definately make this again!

Five stars...the best!!  I actually messed up and grabbed the bottle of Worchestershire sauce instead of soy...didn't realize it until the end. I also used fresh crushed garlic - about six cloves - but otherwise followed the recipe on skinless, boneless chicken thighs, baked at 370 for approximately 55 minutes and it came out FANTASTIC!! Made jasmine rice cooked in chicken broth and garlic and it was delicious.

I made this for dinner tonite, and it was a huge hit! even my picky 2 year old destroyed every last bite :-), My husband could not stop raving about it, and kept telling me how delicious it was while he was eating. I followed the suggestion of several other reviewers and baked the chicken at 375 for about 25 min. turning and basting after about 12 min. Afterwards, I then switched my oven to broiler mode (hi) and broiled for another 10 min on each side.  I used boneless skinless Chicken thighs and used about 6 cloves of garlic (about 2 1/2 TBS) and it came out very delicious and very moist! When the garlic softens it adds great texture on top, and great flavor! I did not have Parsley on hand so i substituted it with Italian Seasoning instead and it came out great! The key is in the basting during the entire cooking process.  The pan drippings go well as a gravy over both chicken and white jasmine rice.  We had mixed corn and green beans along side the white rice, and it was the perfect meal.  Will make again and again! thanks for a great recipe!!!!

This was "OK" at best.  I even added a little cayenne, and could have added more. It just didn't have much flavor, maybe it would make a better marinade. Probably won't make again, hubby and kids just took the skin off so it seems to be a waste.

My family really liked this.  I used 18 bone in, skin on chicken thighs and used everything for just one recipe.  (1/2 c. butter, 3 T. minced garlic, 3 T. Light Soy sauce, etc.) I did use more pepper because we like pepper, and I threw in about 2 T. Worchestershire sauce. (only because I like it so much and I was making so many thighs.)  I baked it first at 350 or about 40 min. then broiled it for about 6 min.  The meat was moist, and they really liked the crunch from the broiling.  Now that I've tried it, the only thing I would do different is to maybe add some red pepper flakes, just to kick it up a notch.  Using so many thighs, I think, saved it from being gressy as so many other posters complained about.  My husband said to definately put this in the rotation, so this one's a winner in my book and I'm a happy camper.  Thanks for the recipe.

As suggested by other members, I baked it in the oven for 45 mins at 375 degrees, basting every 5-10 mins, and it came out great! I used 4 legs, 2 thighs and 2 wings for this recipe. My kids loved it and suggested that I should make this again another night.

Wow!  This was amazing!!  We used Olive oil in place of the butter because of milk allergies in our family.  It was delicious even with the substitution.  I took others recommendations and baked it for 40 minutes at 375* in the sauce and then placed it on a cookie sheet (without the sauce) and broiled it for 10 minutes each side.   Then I dipped it in the sauce, put it on a platter and sprinkled a little more parsley on it.  We used the sauce to mix into the rice I served with it.  So delicious!  I'm glad this is in our monthly rotation!

Very good recipe!  I used boneless, skinless breasts and cut them in half lengthwise to reduce the cooking time. I used three since I was cooking for one adult and three children. I also added four potaotes with their skin and cut each potato into 6 wedges. I broiled it all together. All of us enjoyed it. I think I might try adding fresh green beans next time and using half butter and half olive oil. But this recipe will definately be used again and again in my kitchen. Thank you!

I make this using thigh meat with bone & skin.  The first time I tried this, the chicken turned out very tender and juicy.  However, the skin was too charred and broiling for so long filled the house with smoke.  The next time I made this, I took other reviewers' advice and baked the chicken at 350 for 40 mins, basting every 15 mins, and then broiled it for about 8 mins.  It came out just right and didn't smoke up the house.  The basting sauce has a very good flavor. Plus, it's convenient and inexpensive because it's made using ingredients commonly on hand.   I will definitely make this again using the baking method.

Ummmm..YUM! So simple, yet so delicious! While I try to make the recipe exactly like the owner states, but didn't want to broil it, so took the advice of another and baked thighs (bone in) for 45 mins, basting every 15, then broiled for 5 to crisp skin (we like skin on!)...Fantastic! Added to recipe box!

This is very good and easy to make. I replaced the butter with Coconut oil so there was not a burning issue when I broiled it for 20 minutes. I will definitely be making this again but will decrease the amount of coconut oil to 1/3 cup, 
1/2 cup was to much oil for me. If you want to cut your carbs serve it over a bed of mixed greens. This is how we ate it and it was delicious.

Awesome recipe, quick and yummy!  Came home tired, just wanted a simple broiled chicken recipe "with flavor".  THIS IS IT!  Wonderful flavor, quick prep and quickly ready to eat.  Also works with "butter substitute" like "I Can't Believe Its Not Butter"..for those health concious folks.  I'd give this recipe 100 stars if I could.  It was really flavorful, tasty, just yummy! Thanks for sharing this recipe! ps...works great with any white meat fish too! We tried it with Tilapia and Barramundi! Broil 10 mins each side and its done!

Delicious! I made the sauce on the stove top and added shallots and italian seasoning. I also used chicken breast tenders and baked them at 350 for about 20 minutes, then broiled for 5. This turned out FANTASTIC.

Really, REALLY yummy!  I was concerned while making it that it would be too garlicky, and while I LOVE garlic, my husband isn't as big a fan.  However, he was the one saying throughout dinner how much he liked it!  I didn't deviate from the recipe and I didn't need to.

Yummy!  I used chicken thight quarters  bone in with no skin. I sprinkled the chicken with a bit of sea salt before cooking. I cooked for 45 min in a 375 oven.   For the basting sauce I used half butter, half olive oil, 3 times the garlic, low sodium soy sauce, and garlic chives in place of the parsley for extra flavor. Shallots would have also been nice. I cooked it on the stovetop until the butter was melted. Basted the chicken every 10 minutes.   It was very tasty and will go into my rotation.

Very easy and flavorful.  I used boneless/skinless breasts because they were all I had and they still came out fantastic.  I can't wait to try with dark meat.

Can anyone say MORE PLEASE!!!!!! I have to say that I did do a little modification but not because the recipe needed it. I followed the recipe here except that I added a tablespoon or so of fresh chopped basil just because I love it so. I want to stuff the chicken with bacon bits so I cut a pocket in them and spread some cream cheese in there and piled the bacon inside. Wrapped them up and baked them as recipe states. OHHH Man! My whole family is foaming at the mouth for more. It was soooo delicious. It reminded us of the Spaghetti Scallopini at Carino´s Italian restaurant. Next time is will serve it with plain spaghetti and thicken the sauce left in the pan to serve over it. Hmmmm....maybe tomorrow night!

Great, flavorful chicken that couldn't be easier!  I used bone-in thighs, but removed the skin.  I followed another reviewer's recommendation to bake at 375 for 35 min (turning & basting once), then broiling for 5 min on each side (basting each time).  I wasn't sure it would be so flavorful without marinating, but it was delicious!

I thought recipe called for a lot of butter because chicken thighs are quite fatty. Against my better judgment and because of all the positive reviews, I prepared this recipe anyway (followed recipe to the T) The result was a very oily dish! If you are trying to eat healthy, pass this one up. Rather bland taste and very high in fat and cholesterol.

This was a great, easy recipe.  I cooked as some others had suggested by cooking for about 20-25 minutes then broiling for the last 5.  I also seasoned the chicken with Cajun seasoning I had on hand, but if you season before adding the other ingredients you just have to watch the salt.  Overall, good and kid-friendly!

My husband said "Delicious".  Made 6 thighs and the two of us ate them all.  I removed the skin and because they were not boneless baked them for 45 minutes at 375.  I then broiled for 5 minute and almost burned them. Tasted wonderful.  Will definitely make again and again

Prepare as written, with the exception I only used about 1/3 cup butter. I was able to coat 10 chicken thighs. Roasted in the oven @ 375º for about 45 min. basting about every 15 minutes. Broiled for 2-3 minutes to get the skin crispy.

AWESOME! I made some changes b/c I didn't have enough butter (used Olive Oil), no parsley (used dried Rosemary, Taragon, & Celery Salt), and added honey to the mix. My family was RAVING about it! The kids- the picky kids- were moaning saying, "Oh! Ooohhh! This is SOOOO GOOD!" My husband told me, 'WOW, you have outdone yourself! This is one of the best meals you've ever cooked!" I was requested to make this dish again...and OFTEN.

This was very yummy! I had 6 chicken legs and was recommended this recipe. To cut the sat. fat back some I did half the sauce and did a mix of half land o lakes margarine and half butter. For some reason I ended up doing 1 1/2 Tblsp. of dried parsley for half the sauce. I also used low sodium soy sauce. I lined a baking sheet with sides well with heavy foil to save on cleaning. Instead of saving part of the garlic butter to baste, I just grouped the chicken together and poured it all on them. I had to bake 50 minutes, broiling on low, with the second rack from the top. I flipped them about every 10 minutes, helping to keep them moist. I will definitely make this again.

It was definately easy and quick.  I baked it at 375 for 15 minutes on each side and then broiled it for 5 minutes.  There was way too much butter for me so that will be cut back if I make again.  I liked the combination of butter, soy and garlic though.

I made this recipe the other night and thought it was great!  I read some of the reviews and took some of the advice.  Thanks to everyone!  Here's what I did: I lined the roasting pan with heavy duty foil and also sprayed it with Pam for super easy clean up.  I did 2 Tbsp. low sodium soy sauce and 1 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce.  I also didn't measure the garlic.  I just piled it in since I love it.  It took me about 3 minutes in the microwave instead of 2 to get everything melted and combined.  I baked the chicken for 45 minutes, turning it and basting it every 15 minutes.  At the end I turned my broiler on to High but left the chicken in the pan where it was in the oven instead of moving it closer to the broiler element.  I took the chicken out and let it rest on a platter and served it at room temperature a little later instead of as soon as I finished cooking it, and it was delicious and very tender.  I also used bone in, skin on chicken thighs because that's what I owned (and I misread the recipe!).  It worked beautifully.  I highly recommend this recipe.  My 4 1/2 year old is a seriously picky eater, and he enjoyed it.  I pulled the skin off and cut it up then put it on his plate so he couldn't tell me how yucky or gross it looked.  He ate an entire thigh and some of the rice I made which is a LOT of food for him.  It's a relatively mild recipe but definitely a keeper.  Next time I'm going to try doing half butter, half olive oil because it was a little greasier than I wo

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  The chicken came out tasting like nothing.  I put all the seasoning mentioned in the recipe...and it was EXTREMELY bland !  My husband couldn't even eat it.  I will not be making this dish again.

This was yummy. I used skinless thighless (they were not boneless) and made the sauce as stated, but I baked them at 370, turning and basting every 10 minutes for about 40 minutes, then I put them under the broiler for about 10 minutes to get them brown and crispy.

Excellent recipe for chicken!  I made a few changes, I didn't have boneless chicken thighs, so I used legs,thighs, and a split breast, and instead of Soy Sauce, I used worcestershire sauce, and it turned out GREAT!  My husband ate 3 pieces himself!  It's a keeper!

Made this with boneless skinless chicken breast and it was delicious!  I was wary about using that much minced garlic, but it turned out perfectly.  Quick and easy, juicy and flavorful.  Will definitely make again.

This was hands-down the best chicken dish I've ever made. The chicken was extremely juicy and flavorful! The butter mixture was excellent, but I was a little concerned about the amount of butter in this mixture. Can anyone think of an alternative to butter for this sauce?

I made this exactly as the recipe is written...so this review is for the actual recipe, not my variation.  It was excellent - Slightly crispy on the outside, moist and tender inside, with wonderful flavor.

This was just ok, not much flavor although I did follow the recipe.  Probably won't be making it again.

I was looking for a quick and easy recipe as I'm on mat leave w twins. I didn't have minced garlic but just used whole garlic cut into small pieces. Loved this! Delicious.

I made this for my family tonight and all of us (including myself) loved it! It is not bland at all, and is extremely tasty! The only change I made was I put it in the oven for 45 minutes at 375 degrees. Then about every 15 minutes I added some more of the batter to the top of the chicken, until it was all gone.

I had four hungry kids and a hungry husband clamoring for dinner, which was running late.  This fit the bill for a quick recipe for boneless chicken thighs.  *Everyone* raved about it, and that is rarer than a total lunar eclipse.  I am thrilled that I've found another easy meal to go into rotation, and will share this recipe with friends and family, too.  I used 12 thighs, kept the butter amount the same (1/2 c.) and doubled the garlic and soy sauce.  I dipped the breasts in the mixture, then broiled for 10 minutes on one side and 7 on the other.  I like my chicken a little on the dry side, and this was perfect for me.  I had lots of the butter mixture left over, enough to make again tomorrow night.  :-)  The pan drippings are heavenly.  I'm saving them for soup or rice.

Just made these yesterday and the whole family enjoyed them.  I did cut the butter back to 1/4 cup just to try to make it healthier.  Very easy and quick and good for a busy night.

I used 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup butter because I couldn't imagine how dark meat like thighs would do with a whole stick of butter. Added about 1/2 pound thickly-sliced mushrooms on top, basted everything with the sauce, covered with foil, baked at 375 for 30 minutes.  Then I removed some of the liquid from the baking dish and broiled a few minutes on each side until brown.  Didn't taste the parsley at all, so I will experiment with other spices such as the ones recommended by other reviewers.  Garlic was milder than I expected, which was good for my kids (and also my co-workers the next day!).  Husband suggested adding honey or teriyaki or something to sweeten it a touch. I liked it just as it was. Basic, simple, and good.

I love this chicken! I've found that broiling it for 20 minutes seems to be too long, I've set off my smoke alarm, so I cut the broiling time to 10 minutes and back at 350F for 10 minutes and it comes out great!  I also only use 1 lb of chichen rather than 6 chicken breasts.

This made a great sauce although it was a bit greasy.  Next time, I'll put the chicken on a rack, coating both sides and use alot less butter.  I made a sauce by mixing some of the seasoned butter into a jar of Heinz chicken gravy (Shh, don't tell).  It was fabulous over rice or mashed potatoes.

This recipe is awesome, however, I used boneless, skinless thighs.  Since there is no skin, broiling it makes the garlic bitter. Instead of broiling it, I bake it at 375 for about 20 minutes I also used only 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 olive oil.  Good stuff!

This was a very good and simple recipe. I did also do the bake and then broil bit. I baked the chicken things at 375 for 45 minutes and then I broiled it for 5 more minutes to get a nice crisp on the skin. Instead of melting the butter and additional ingredients in the microwave I did it on the stove. I also doubled all the ingredients. I also seasoned the chicken with lemon pepper and garlic powder before pouring the butter mixture on top. Next time I will marinade it over night and maybe add some lemon juice in it! I served it with mixed veggies and white rice with some of the juice poured over it. It was an overall success for my picky family :)

Great recipe!  I did add some Rosemary, minced onion, red pepper flakes and worchestire sauce as others suggested and it was wonderful!  I baked it at 375 for 30 minutes and then broiled it for 10 min each side to crisp them up as well.  Even though i did modify it slightly to our taste, i am sure the original recipe is just as delicious!

Our entire family loved this, and so did our guests (they had no idea they were guinea pigs!). The family asked that we make this one of our staple dishes. It is soooo easy and ultra fast to make! I'm not a huge fan of microwaves, so I melted the butter in a small sauce pan with all of the ingredients and poured it over the chicken breasts and broiled on low for about 15-20 minutes. Thanks for the great recipe!

Just did this recipe and boy was it delicious.  I used bone-in thighs and legs and used the bake-then-broil method - 40 minutes at 400, flipping halfway through, then broil 5 minutes per side.  Superb.  Delicious with fried rice!

This was WAY better than i though it would be. My husband wants this chicken again... so tonight I'm going to use half butter and half olive oil but otherwise keep the ingredients as is. Also, i followed the bake-then-broil method suggested by other reviewers and didn't have any smoke problems. True, this is a higher fat dish, but we eat low fat meals most nights so this is one of our comfort foods when we're in the mood for a juicy skin-on chicken. And don't neglect to serve the sauce over rice, oh my! It's epic. :)

This was very good and very easy. I followed other reviewers advice and baked it in the oven at 375 for about 45 minutes and then just browned it under the broiler for a few minutes. I used thighs with bones in. My whole family loved it and I'm looking forward to having the left-overs for lunch!

I never buy chicken thighs because I just never know what to do with them. I do now! WOW! Sooooooooo delicious. I used thighs with the bone in and they were so juicy and moist. The only thing I did differently was bake at 375 for 20 mins, flip and pour rest of sauce on, and bake for 5 more minutes. They were cooked perfectly (smaller sized thighs)

Definitely a great starter recipe for quick, easy, delicious chicken!  Next time I will decrease the butter if using dark meat (too greasy) and double the soy sauce (just like more of that flavor) and maybe marinate a little before cooking.  Like others, I baked it at 375 for 40 minutes (bone in thighs with skin).  My son LOVED it and he's super picky!

OMG! This is a new favorite!!! A great last minute meal that's sure to please! It's best to use the jar of minced garlic, instead of going throug the trouble. Line your baking dish with foil!!! So much better for the juices to collect & baste your chicks easily... Also easy clean up =) luv this dish!!

This turned out really great thanks to the input of several other people who recommended that we reduce the butter and bake the chicken instead. Delicious! Next time I'm going to try using less soy sauce and adding Worcestershire or Balsamic.

This was really great! I cut the butter in half to 1/4 cup and did equal parts soy sauce and worchestershire sauce. I also added some mushrooms to the pan and they were delicious after the cooked in the juices. Made the house smell yummy! Cooked at 375 for 45 mins as others suggested them broiled for about 5 minutes. Yum! Adding this to my recipe box for sure.

This was amazing! Instead of broiling, I baked it as well at 375 degrees for 45 minutes and then broiled a little to just make it a little crispy on top. This is the most tener, moist chicken!! Amazing recipe. Thanks to 'Avasewell" for sharing!!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious! I didn't make any changes, but I did caramelize a large onion and served the chicken on top of that with steamed rice. Yummy!

Just got done eating this for dinner with Cheddar mashed potatoes! The chicken was the best I've ever made! I've done so poorly with chicken in the past, only my husband cooks it now, but tonight I made this one! I did change it a little, but I still gave it 5 stars cause you just can't go wrong with the overall instructions. I HATE soy sauce, so I never have it in my house. I used Worchestire sauce...since they are both dark. Also, I always keep a huge jar of McCormick's Garlic Pepper in stock, so I just shook it in till it looked good, then added the onion and parsley. I use A LOT of garlic pepper. I followed the others and baked it. I turned it every 20 minutes or so and I basted the butter mixture on with each turn. It baked for about 1 1/2 hours cause I was busy with the potatoes, but it didn't burn or dry out! Switched to broil for the last 10 minutes. I have NO left overs!!! Fabulous!

I followed this as written except, I had a 10lb. bag of chicken hind quarters (leg/thigh. Thawed them and cut at the joint and skinned them. This gave me 20 pcs and I adjusted the recipe for that amount. I sprayed a lg metal shallow baking pan I have and arranged the chicken. I poured mixture over coating all pcs and then baked at 350 for 45 min. This chicken was to die for!! The market chicken was on special for .29 per lb!! So, the meat cost was $2.90 and I had everthing else on hand. Not only was it awesome it was extremely cost effective. The whole family wants it made again only in a much larger quantity for an upcoming family function. Thank you, it will be used here I can see many times again!!

Not a bad recipe by any means. I only used 1/4 c. butter, added a dash of ginger powder and some sesame oil to boost the flavor. Great taste, will do again.

I only had bone in chicken, so I baked instead of broiling...  I basted every 10-15 min. or so.  My whole family loved it, and everyone had seconds of the chicken!  There were no leftovers!

This was really easy to make and tasted good too!  I prepared it while I was busy making 3 other things on the stove for a party, and it was so easy to just mix the sauce and then throw it in the oven!  Just brush on, broil, turn and baste and broil a little more.  It was easy and tasted great!

I use this recipe once a week, and even passed it along to family.  I broil it longer than the recipe calls for: 45-50 min. and its still tasty!

Used boneless skinless thighs and they were so tender!!!  Marinated thighs in sauce for around an hour and baked them 350 for 35 minutes, then broiled for 5.  I made a little extra sauce and set it aside to put on some rice.  Nice dish

I followed Audra's advice and baked it for 35 minutes, turning it halfway through, then broiled it on each side for about 5 minutes. I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs and breasts.  I used some Italian seasoning with rosemary as well. Followed the rest of the recipe ingredients, but added diced pancetta on top of the chicken when baking. Add a little flavor and a little juice. It was excellent!!!

Great recipe! Only things I changed was halved the amount of butter and then split that between olive oil and butter so it wasn't so heavy. Then baked 18 minutes each side and 5 minutes each side broiled.  Oh! Also, threw in potatoes around chicken and coated with any left over mixture. Everything tasted amazing!

I tried this recipe last night for the first time. I made it exactly the way they said besides the fact that i baked it for 34 mins. and than i broiled it rotating it for like 6-8 minutes and basting in between with  the mixture. This dish was the best i have EVER tasted. When i tell you it was sooo delicious and amazing, i mean it. I used chicken thighs with the bone in it.It was so flavorful and juicy. I will definitely be making this more often. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!

Fabulous and as easy as pie - no...much easier! lol.  Made exactly as written using chicken thighs (with bone)(extra 10 minutes broiling on low) and it was a hit! My son came downstairs during the cooking and said, "wow, it smells really good!"  I said, yea, that's what a lot of reviewers said!  I added asparagus to the pan for the last 8-10 minutes of broiling and it was delicious!

Yum! I followed the ingredients exactly. Hubby walked in as I was melting the butter mixture and made a face but then thought it smelled really good. I didn't broil the chicken. Instead I baked it at 375 for an hour covered with aluminum foil and basted every few minutes. It was moist and delicious!

This was good. I used BLSL chicken breasts and I baked mine as per the #1 review, but that was just too long and my chicken dried out. 25 minutes is when to start checking it, I think. I also cut some baby potatoes in half and baked them face-down in the melted butter sauce. Very good! The herbed butter is great poured over a green veggie on the side. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

My picky teenage daughter loved this. I used Audra's recommendation to halve the fat, and substituted 1 T olive oil with 2 T butter. It was still very moist with lots of pan juices.  I followed LindaK's suggestion and avoided the broiler. I baked boneless chicken thighs in my convection oven at 375, turning them over after about 12 minutes.. Done in 20 minutes. I didn't have parsley, so I omitted it. Regardless of these minor changes, the soy garlic butter is a great concoction. This will definitely be a regular addition to fast and easy week night dinner menu.

I used the ingredients as suggested but followed the recommendations of other reviewers regarding baking first, then broiling.  It was very good.  I would have given it only four stars, but the ease of preparation makes it a five star recipe.

Delicious and simple! I only used 1 tbsp butter and a couple tbsp olive oil, reduced the soy sauce, and added 1 tbsp rosemary like a previous reviewer. only had to cook the thighs for about 10-12 minutes.

Great taste, simple and fast!  My 2 year old loved it as did I!  I didn't have parsely so I used basil.  It would be awsome with the parsley but you cant go wrong.

So great, but next time I'll do half the butter. I also baked for 40 min. At 375, but next time I'll bake for less time then broil for a few minutes to finish it off.  The flavor is delicious, though. Great job.

We enjoyed this one.  We prefer white meat vs. dark, so I made this using skinless, boneless chicken breasts.  And we grilled this rather than broiling.  It’s also quick and easy.

These were delicious! I baked mine for about and hour at 350 (I was waiting for sweet potatoes to get done baking so that is why I did it that long) I used some of the sauce to baste them after 30 minutes and then at the end of the cook time I basted them again and broiled for just a couple minutes to crisp up the skin.They had a wonderful flavor-I will definitely be making these on a regular basis!

What a great recipe.  This is a keeper – very easy and just plain delicious.   The butter mixture imparts great flavor without the extra planning of marinating the chicken.  I baked it in a 375 oven and after baking degreased the butter mixture to use as a sauce when serving the chicken.   I thought it was a fabulous recipe and will be making this often.    Loved it!

This was a good recipe. I also went by the other  review and cooked at 375 for 40 minutes in a metal baking pan lined with foil. I then transferred chicken onto a makeshift broiler rack at the last, and broiled on high for 6 minutes per side. I had no parsley, so I used thyme and rosemary (dried). I also thought this was too much butter to use, so I used 3 tablespoons of butter, and a drizzle of olive oil. After the 45 minutes of baking, there was more than enough sauce on the bottom of the pan. Nothing evaporated. It didn't have much flavor for my palate, so next time, I will add salt and more seasonings to it. I advise to try the recipe without salt first, I am a salt lover so others may think the soy sauce is more than enough salt flavor. I might even marinate chicken next time in the butter/soy sauce mixture for a few hours before baking. Delicious!

This is much better than I expected it to turn out! I added a little bit more soy sauce also.

Wonderful, easy to make!  Baked skinless thighs for 45 minutes (turning every 15 minutes) and it made the house so good!  Broil to crisp if necessary.  Thanks!

really good. I used perdue chicken thighs and broiled on low. I did modify and substitute butter for extra virgin olive oil only because i like to cook with EVOO. Everything i had already didnt require alot of prep work. Will make again, thanks for the easy recipe.

I personally like this very much, but my husband thinks the broiling resulted in a dry chicken. But that is because I had used chicken breast instead of chicken thighs...

My boys and I loved this!! I always have smoking incidents when I broil, so I just baked it for around an hour. I'll use the broiler just to crisp up the skin.
So simple to make, I didn't even measure anything, and the end result was finger lickin' good! 
Thanks so much for this recipe!

I was disappointed with this recipe.  I followed it exactly.  The chicken burned and turned out rather dry.  Also, I felt the garlic overwhelmed the taste.  I may use this recipe as a starter recipe but I wouldn't broil because I don't like burnt chicken.  Also, it was not cooked enough after the suggested time.  I truly wished it would have turned out like the other reviewers cuz it sounds wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe though.

Even though we used boned chicken, the thighs came out tender, moist, and full of flavor. I plan to make again and again. Such a delicious way to cook this cheaper piece of meat!

Teenage kids loved it and after the first bite asked me to make it again.  I cut the butter in half, and used skinless thighs, but left the rest the same.  There was a lot of butter left in the pan, so you might be able to reduce the butter and soy sauce even more to make less sauce. Next time I will add some red pepper flakes for a little zip!

This was good! Too much butter and garlic called for however, so I will use half next time.  I am a garlic fiend, so the garlic side was more on the amount I wasted. I used this with the oven method as I have a very sensitive smoke alarm and didn't want to chance it.  I served it with crescent rolls and fried rice. BF gives it a 5, I give it a 4 as I wasn't all over crazy about it, but I would make it again for him.

Added some brown sugar about a tablespoon and a half. It tasted great! Although i don't know if broiling is the best way to cook it because it burned the sauce very quickly.

I made this last night..and today its featured on the home page. Weird. This was a huge hit at my house. I did half olive oil and half butter, only because we were down to our last stick of butter. Baked (5) thighs about 40 minutes, then broiled on each side for 5 minutes. Next time I think I'll marinate them a bit and do it on the grill..and will definitely make more! It was rainy and cold here, so I served this with a cream of potato soup and roasted broccoli. Fantastic meal. Thank you!!!

This was just ok. I expected the chicken to becomed carmelized with the sauce, but didn't at all, resulting in a chicken thigh swimming in butter and garlic, with a salty twang from the soy sauce. Kinda boring and bland.

Very good recipe. Turns out just like the picture! 3 kids (ages 6, 10, and 13) and 2 adults finished cleaned their plates without a problem. I cooked thighs with bone in, so needed to add a good 20 minutes to cook time. Next time I will try it without the skin to see if I can get all that awesome garlic baste right on the meat.

I made this recipe and it was very tasty.  I followed another suggestion and baked for about 30 minutes first.  Then broiled (bone in chicken thighs) for about 7-8 minutes per side. I do recommend making a double batch of the sauce.  I had to make more when I began to broil the chicken.  The color was wonderful and even my six year old liked it - That's always a winner, will definately make again

This was fantastic. I cooked the thighs for 35 minutes at 375, saving 1/3 of the sauce to add when I turned them 15 minutes in. I then transferred the chicken to a foil covered cookie sheet and broiled them on high for 5 minutes.

This is a very good recipe.  I think maybe it needs a little more kick like maybe brown sugar, or lemon juice, or honey or something else sweet.  I will make this again, though.  I have some left in the fridge and I will see what my daughter says about it.

This one we'll have again and again! I liked the idea of splitteng the soy sauce with Worcestershire suace, and so did my wife. She isn't a big fan of soy sauce. Also, I baked the chicken for 35 minutes and then put it under the broiler for about 8 - 10 mminutes. I used 4 thighs instead of the recommended 6, and am glad I did as there would not have been enough sauce when basting 3 times. We served the chicken on light & fluffy egg noodles and the dish was wonderful!

Very easy for anyone who doesn't have too much time for prep, and want dinner ready in a half an hour. Chicken comes out tender and the smell of garlic is lovely. I serve it with steamed mixture of white and brown rice. Fresh diced tomatoes on the side makes a nice compliment. Delicious!

Absolutely Delicious!!! and now my favorite and easiest way to cook boneless thighs. I do cut back on the butter and add some ck broth or white wine for flavor. I also bake and add a bag of mixed vegetables the last 10 minutes of cooking and cover with foil so the vegetables don't dry out and look over cooked. Served with cous cous or cheesy rice and there is never much left over! yum!

Made last night and followed directions to a tee except, I used  boneless skinless chicken breasts.  GR8 flavorful sauce which melded well with the buttered garlic parmesan egg free noodles I made to serve up with the chicken.   The only disappointment is that my chicken did'nt get that deep dark coloring as shown in your photo and,  it was way too juicy for my liking so, next time I'll broil them an addtional 15 minutes ;-)  Thanks 4 Posting This Quick & Easy To Prepare Chicken Recipe!

I do love this recipe. The chicken gets a beautiful brown color on top. Very tastey. I usually cut back on some of the butter to make it a little healthier. The full amount of butter gives it a 'melt in your mouth' flair though.

I rated this one high not because the taste is phenomenal, but because it is really good and SO easy. I used boneless skinless thighs. I used the exact amount of sauce, basted on one side and flipped half way through baking and basted on the other. I baked at 350 for 45 mins then broiled on low for 5 minutes. My husband ate seconds and he is a picky eater.

Love this.  I've made it quite a few times since I've first tried it.  Sometimes I add a few other spices like oregano and basil to the mix.  It always comes out great and everyone always loves it.  Thanks!

Very Good! I used bone-in/skin-on thighs and baked at 375 degrees for 45 minutes.  Although the smell of the garlic is overpowering, the taste is mellow and really good.  Perfect for low-carb dieters like myself.

This recipe is AMAZING!  So simple and easy, yet FULL of wonderful flavors!  When I make this it takes longer than stated here for the chicken to fully cook... The first time I made it I found myself turning and basting for about an hour!  Since then I've found that, after you've broiled the chicken so that the skin is nice and crispy, turn the oven down to about 350 (F) and let it bake for about 15 minutes... once the juices run clear when cut with a knife, broil for another 5 minutes on each side for color/crispness.  I don't recomend cooking the garlic prior to making the marinade b/c when the chicken is broiling the garlic will burn if it's been pre-cooked! Overall, a wonderful recipe that has guests oohh-ing and ahh-ing every time!  =)

I loved this recipe... the flavor was amazing and it's a continued favorite in my house!  The only problem I came to was the smoking in the oven... I ended up giving up and cooking it in the oven at around 425 until the chicken was basically done, turning every few minutes to absorb that flavor at the bottom of the pan.  Once done, I placed it in the broiler for 1 minute on each side with a couple turns each... any more than a minute, the skin was burning  black that's why I turned it a couple times until it got to a great color and took it out.  Love it!

This is TO DIE FOR on the grill!!  The only change I made was to use skinless chicken (honestly, it was better without it). This has become my favorite chicken recipe, hands down!

I changed the recipe a bit. I used Worchestershire for poultry instead of soy sauce and used boneless skinless chicken breasts pounded to 1/2 inch. Cooked in much less time, and the results were obsolutely delicious!
I served it with "Oriental Green Bean Salad" from this site. The cook times are similar, and the flavors are complimentary.

The sauce component is amazing.
I made this twice. The first time the broil time was too harsh and burned the skin and dried up the sauce.
The second time I adhered to advice on here and baked and finished by broiling for appearance and crispness. This allowed for the sauce to survive and I was able to baste better.
Pretty good simple recipe.

This was amazingly tasty and simple! I had no idea what to make for dinner, had lass than an hour & not much available. Made it as written (albeit with a little less butter) on skinless boneless breasts., pounded a little Cooked at 375 for a while (maybe 20 min) & then found some spinach in the fridge. I rinsed that & popped it into the baking pan for another 2-3 min and then tossed the whole thing under the broiler for 2-3 more.

BIG BIG hit! Served it with French fries and the sauce was sooo good on the fries too!

Thanks!

This is a great simple recipe that has made it into our regular rotation. My wife is a very picky eater, as are my kids but they all like this. We've tried it on the grill, but it would burn easily so the broiler is definitely the best method.

Read this review!  Okay.... I made this recipe twice, the first batch axactly as written, then the second batch I followed others advice and used 2 Tbsp. soy sauce with 1 Tbsp. balsamic vinegar. (In my case I used a thick sweetened balsamic glaze because it was all I had).... and I marinated this batch for 6 hours. The first batch I made for lunch right away and found it very bland, runny and greasy, like many others agreed. The second batch I made for dinner, and WOW!!! AMAZING difference! Please marinate this before baking and do bake at 375 for 45 minutes and then broil for a few minutes for that yummy crust you want!  The original recipe as written gets 2 stars for the delicious ingredients, but the remake version gets 5! I could drink the juice it was THAT good!

This was very good! I used coconut aminos in place of soy sauce. I imagine regular soy sauce would make this saltier but it was perfect the way I made it. If you use soy, definitely use low sodium.

baked at 375 for 35 minutes then 2.5 minute broil was the better way to cook, got nice crispy skin this way and no smoky house. otherwise, sauce recipe stays the same.

simple and flavorful. I found the chicken needed a little more time but I opted to bake it at 475 rather than broil it. I added in a little worchestershire sauce too.

This would have been too bland for our taste (hence the 4 stars), but with these changes our guests loved it.
I added cayenne pepper for a little heat; 1 TB good quality balsamic vinegar, a good squirt of ketchup as I had no brown sugar, 2 TB  light salt soy sauce &  1 TB regular soy sauce, & left off the parsley.
I chopped approx. 4TB garlic, as we all love it.
I used boneless, no skin chicken thighs. I had 9 chicken thighs, &  put them into a 375 degree oven, for 45 minutes, turning them every 15 min., as someone else had suggested. The chicken was moist and tender.
I served it with a brown/wild rice combo and fresh thin asparagus that had a light dusting of parmesan.

Haven't tasted yet, but I have a few suggestions to avoid confusion.  Make sure baking dish is deep enough for all the liquid.  Move "until juices run clear" to end of sentence.  Basking should be done during cooking, not after juices run clear.  Can't wait to try it.

I'm sorry, but this was not what I was expecting. I love garlic, I think there was way to much butter, I thought it would make the chicken crispy but it was just floating and soaking in butter fat. Egh. I also didn't like the taste of the mixture no matter how much parsley I put in,  something just wasn't right. But a lot of people seem to like it, so maybe if you're down with a lot of butter it may be ok for you. ... Chicken was moist on the bright side and I did broil... for 16 minutes.

It was super easy and delicious!  I followed the recommendation of 375F for 25min then 5min each side on broil high.  I would highly recommend it.

I think it is so interesting  that this recipe is so many men's favorite. What I love is that not only is it their favorite, but it is so easy to make and very affordable.

For someone who doesn't cook, this recipe was very easy to make and super delicious!  If you like garlic then you'll love this recipe.

Delicious!  Very easy too.  I substituted Rosemary for Parsley when I realized I was out, and it was delicious... I broiled it for 30 min and the chicken was perfectly done!

I was so disappointed with this recipe.  I won't be making this again. It smelled wonderful, but tasted very bland and only flavorful if you get a bite with the crusted topping loaded with garlic.  I did not completely double the garlic because it seemed like so much, but maybe I probably should have... Each member of our family was trying to figure out what they could dip it in to make it taste better.

I have to say straight off the bat that I did change the recipe slightly, that being said it's baking in the oven right now at 375 instead of broiling and it smells INCREDIBLE!!!!! Holy Cow, the changes that I made obviously baking instead of broiling, and I de-boned 10 thighs instead of just 6, snuggled in pyrex baking dish, I microwaved 1 3/4 cup of butter with two whole small heads of garlic ( I put in food processor, much much quicker), 1/2 small diced onion,  I used about 5 Tablespoons of soy sauce and I used.......orange marmalade! About 3-4 heaping tablespoons worth, really to taste if you like it sweeter add more. Anywhoo smells fantastic getting nice and golden brown on the top. I'm super excited. Update, it took 1 hour in the oven. I tried it and it is fantastic. when I de-boned them I rolled the thigh back up, it will help the chicken stay nice and moist.

I had to use oregano instead of parsley and it still turned out good. I think this would be better next time if I flatten the chicken some or use an injector. The breast was thicker so the seasoning didn't get all the way in, but it was still tender and juicy.

I used chicken breast cutlets and pounded them very thinly and then marinated overnight and they came out great!  This one is a keeper for sure. My family was raving about them.

Excellent! Followed the recipe as is, the chicken was fully cooked and really juicy. I used reduced sodium soy and it was still just a bit too salty for me, so next time I will use 2 1/2 tablespoons instead.

I made this recipe with chicken breasts and adjusted the cooking time, so perhaps I would have liked this better with thighs.  The recipe was very easy, but I wish it had more flavor.

Made this tonight.  First, but definitely not the last time!  I halved the recipe, with the exception of keeping the full amount of garlic.  This was quick to prep, quick to cook, and best of all, tasted amazing!  This will definitely become a go-to recipe for dinner time in my house!  Thanks for sharing it!

The flavor of this recipe was great and the chicken was very tender. The only thing that I would change is to use chicken breast rather than chicken thighs. Thank you for sharing. :)

I forgot to flip the chicken & re-baste it because I got side-tracked, so the garlic burned on top, but it still tasted very good and moist. We used boneless, skinless chicken thighs.

My new favorite chicken dish!  LOVE IT!  I used chicken thighs with bone-in.  I took the advice of another reviewer and baked in a baking dish instead of broiling the chicken.  I prepared everything exactly as the recipe stated and baked the chicken at 375 for 40 minutes.  I basted the chicken thighs with the remaining liquid half way through.  Yum!  I will be making this often!

This is a go to recipe for a quick but yummy week night dinner. I use 3 tablespoons butter and 3 tablespoons olive oil instead of all butter. There is plenty of extra to baste with. I serve it with rice and veggies.

EXCELLENT!  Very tasty and easy!  My only change was to use 1 1/8 tsp. garlic powder as I was out of fresh garlic.  I  baked at 375 degrees until it was almost done, then broiled for the last 5 minutes.  I served them with fingerling potatoes that I cut into wedges, coated with olive oil and sprinkled with onion soup mix.  The cooking time was about the same.  (The potatoes didn't get the 5 minutes broil.)  The smell was enough to get your taste buds going!  Thank you AVASEWELL for such a tasty easy recipe!  Having a video was really nice, thank you AR!

Great taste and very moist!
I used olive oil instead of butter, 1/4c + 2 T.
Not too salty.  Baked boneless thighs for 35 min plus a few minutes of broiling for a light char.  Big hit with my 1 year-old!

OMG, so good!  Used skinless, boneless chicken thighs and baked at 375 for 40 minutes.  Otherwise followed the directions exactly.  Didn't end up using the sauce because it was too greasy, but the flavor of the chicken and the tenderness was amazing.

Absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe and used all the butter, however, I baked at 375 for about 35-40 minutes,  and then broiled for about 4 minutes.  I also kept brushing the chicken ( I used thighs) with the sauce and especially before broiling.  Very flavorful and tender.  This one's a keeper!

Very easy, very tasty. Didn't have garlic so I ended up using the equivalent in garlic powder, 2.25 teaspoons. Next time I make this, which will be often, I'll be sure to have fresh garlic on-hand.

I absolutely loved this recipe and will definitely use this often. I like a lot of flavor so I did put in a bit of chopped ginger and a 1/2 cup of orange juice. Also, I ate this over Spanish rice and it tasted wonderful! Thank you for such a great recipe.

I approve the quantity of butter in this recipe. The first time I made this recipe, I didn't have any soy sauce. I randomly had some La Choy teriyaki marinade instead. The result was fantastic and I have never made it any other way since!

This was a great and easy recipe!  I added a little mayo since I didn't have as much soy sauce...it came out great.  I have also added ginger and gave it some zip along with the mayo.  I am going to use the leftover chicken for a salad..

This meal tasted delicious; I even used some of the seasoning in the side of mashed potatoes! The only problem is it smoked up my house really badly. I'm not sure if I broiled it right though. I've never had this issue before with broiling fish, but that's my only experience with broiling.

This is just awesome. I was cooking thighs (Skin on though) and this is just a great recipe and I'm actually trying it on pork as I had 3 pkgs of chicken and have to freeze them for my lunch this week. So to make room, I brought out the pork also.

This was actually my first time cooking meat ever since I am a vegetarian. I made a half recipe for my husband and he really liked the flavor, but he did find them a little greasy. I used skinless chicken. Thanks for the great and very easy recipe!

5 Stars for flavor, 3 for the cut of chicken. We loved the preparation on chicken breast, but it was much too oily when paired with chicken thighs (even without the skin). My family was grossed out by the thighs the first time I made it and I was asked not to make it again....ever.  Convinced that the flavors should work, I tried it again (without telling them) with chicken breasts and it was lovely. The fam had no idea it was the same dish.

Delicious! I used a few of the customizations in the comments; baked instead of broiled, added mushrooms and balsamic vinegar. Another hint: put some of the juices into your rice as it cooks to add flavor. I will definitely be making this again!

Very easy and delicious and moist!  I changed just a few things because of personal taste and what I had on hand.  I used 1 T of garlic instead of 3, fresh parsley, and reduced the butter to 1/4 cup.  I used skinless and boneless chicken thighs and baked them at 350 degrees for 35-40 minutes.

I followed user audra's suggestion of using 1/2 the butter and baking then broiling and, let me tell you, there is no better chicken recipe I have found yet. I make this often, basically because my 4 sons and husband request this on a near weekly basis!! FANTASTIC!

Excellent!  Made this for my husband the other night who is VERY picky and he loved it.  Used EVOO but otherwise didn't change a thing.  Planning on making this for company next weekend with Vigo yellow rice for the sauce which was delicious.  Thanks!

We made this last night and it was awesome. We used bone in thighs and it came out great, had lots of flavor and was extremely moist. I did however bake at 375 for 45 minutes and then broiled the last 10 minutes. I will for sure be keeping this in my rotation of meals.

This was very tasty. I baked the chicken instead of broiling, and it came out just fine. I also made half of the thighs with skin on, and half with no skin, and they all turned out well. I might tweak this in the future with the addition of herbs, but haven't figured out which yet. Very good.

I let the thighs sit in the juice about 20 minutes or so before I cooked them.  I don't know if that helped but I was so impressed with how well the thighs kept the flavor of the juice.  I followed others' advice and baked the thighs first and then broiling them.  
This will definitely get made again!  Thank you for a great recipe!

This dish turned out fantastic! My husband described it as "restaurant quality" and "guest worthy"! I made the marinade exactly as described. I used skinned, boneless chicken thighs, which I placed in a casserole dish, single layer. I spooned approximately 1-2 TBLs of the marinade over each piece, then I baked them, covered, at 320 for one hour. Next, I removed the thighs from the casserole and from all the juices that had accumulated in the casserole, and I placed them on a foil-lined cookie sheet. I spooned more marinade on each, and broiled (on low) approximately 10 mins per side. I spooned more sauce over the top when ready to serve. They were beautiful and extremely flavorful. Because it was just my husband and I, I cooked only 4 thighs. If cooking more, I'd suggest doubling or tripling the sauce. Also, I used a garlic mincer rather than chopping the garlic up. I think it made the part a little faster and easier. All in all, this is really a "WOW" dish. Thanks for sharing!! And for those who haven't tried it, don't be discouraged by the negative reviews. Try the receipe! If you're a garlic lover, then you'll love this!

I thought that this chicken was quick, easy, and turned out great.  My kids loved it, and so did I.  I made it with bonesless, skinLESS chicken thighs so improved health quality - and it turned out just great.  Thanks - it's a keeper!

I've made this a few times for my family already and it tastes better each time!  Some changes I have made to make this even better for us were using: chicken breast instead of thighs, olive oil and a little of butter, fresh parsley, and, most importantly, double the marinade because it makes a great sauce with our rice/pasta!  I also baked instead of broiled the chicken per suggestions noted.  Excellent & simple recipe!

This is delicious and easy. We make it with skinless thighs (bone-in) and just bake it for approx. 45 minutes at 375 deg. So yummy and one of our new favorites!

This was so good!  I only had 1T of soy sauce so for the other 2 T I used 1 T of white basalmic an 1T of worchestersire sauce.  I also added a little salt and some rosemary leaves.  DELISH!  I will make again and again, maybe reducing butter by 1/2 next time.

Pretty tasty! I eyeballed the ingredients. The boys loved it. Great for everyday chicken. I also just baked instead of broiling.

Try this my way!  Easy, tasty and pretty healthy!  I halved the butter, only used 2 tbs low sodium soy sauce, FRESH parsley and thin boneless chicken breasts.  Flipped them over after 10 minutes and threw a large handful of cherry tomatoes on top.  Served over Spinach with tons o garlic.  Came out delicious!

Loved this recipe! This is great to make for chicken to put in salad. I used chicken breasts and didn't even use all of the sauce. I may experiment with the seasonings a little bit next time. I did choose the baking route as opposed to just broiling. I did broil at the end for about 4 minutes on low.  Thanks!

Great recipe.  Really easy, really tasty.  We baked at 350 for about 45 minutes, turning once and basting...and then broiled each side for about 3 minutes at the end.  They turned out perfectly.

This dish is to die for. My boyfriend loved it. Some people said it was too salty. Buy Chinese soy sauce brands like Lee Kum Kee or Pearl River from the Asian markets. Kikkoman, Amoy and other brands from regular supermarkets seem to have more sodium. Probably can't make it as often as I would like because of all that butter but definitely would make it again! Thanks for the recipe.

I rarely review recipes, but I had to for this spectacular dish.  I usually make the notorious teriyaki baked chicken from this site, however tonight I thought I'd give this one a try.  It was DELICIOUS and super easy.  I used 2 packs of skinless boneless thighs.  I broiled on one side for 10 min, then flipped over basted with  more sauce and broiled an additional 10 min.  This is company-worthy for sure and definitely getting a spot in my regular rotation.  Thanks so much for posting.

Fantastic recipe! I usually try to make the recipe as intended but I hadn't realized I was out of parsley until late in the game. Oregano worked great as a last minute substitute. Fantastic with roasted asparagus and buttered noodles! Hats off to you Ava for an easy, yet fancy tasting meal!

I followed the recipe and it turned out good.  Next time I will use 2 tablespoons of garlic.  I also floured the chicken prior to adding this mixture and then baked for 25 mins at 375 then broiled for 10 mins.

Flavorful chicken dish. I used fresh parsley and baked chicken at 375 until juices ran clear. I broiled for the last 5 minutes. Thanks for sharing...

This was so delicious! Even my two and four year olds liked it. I used skinned chicken thighs, Lurpak Garlic butter (which eliminated the need to mince up some garlic), light soy sauce and fresh parsley, popped it in the oven to bake for about 20 minutes, then broiled in on each side for about 5 minutes like the other posters suggested. Really tasty! Also quick and easy. Next time I will cook it with the skin to give it that extra crispy taste. Yum!

I halved the recipe, used olive oil instead of butter, and marinated 2 chicken breasts for an hour, then placed the on the George Foreman for about 7 minutes.  The best grilled chicken I've ever made!

Simple and delicious.  Per another reviewer's advice I used 1\4 cup olive oil and 1\4 cup butter.  (did not microwave the olive oil.)  Also substituted dried cilantro for dried parsley because we did not have any on hand.  Baked in oven at 450 and basted every 5-10 minutes until ready.  Highly recommended !

skipped the parsley, and used (skinless) breasts instead of thighs. 20 minutes wasn't quite enough, but I was on "lo" rather than "hi." turned out fabulous, perfect for a chicken caesar salad, and would definitely make again! I brushed on more butter and turned breasts every 5 min or so.

Very good flavor however we used legs and they were very greasy.  I followed the recipe exactly so I think I would prefer it with skinless breasts or like the author suggested as a marinade for a whole chicken instead.

I'd cut back on the butter next time, but this was delicious. I took someone's suggestion and added mushrooms before I baked it. Yummy! I'll fix this recipe again!

This is definately a once a week meal for us now.  I did make a couple of changes; used skinless, boneless chicken thighs and baked it to prevent any smoking.  Baked at 375 turning the chicken every 10 minutes for 30 mins and then broiled for 5 minutes on each side.  Made for huband's lunch and he said the only thing he would have changed is to serve with rice to soak up the juice.

Great!  I took legs and thighs with skin on, and just baked for 45 minutes, turning halfway- The flavor went through to the bone!

Excellent dish.  I had to modify it a bit due to what I had on hand, but it is very adaptable and very easy to make.  It was fairly quick too and worked well for a quick meal after putting in a long day at work.  Thank you.

Using 20 boneless thighs, I increased the soy sauce to 1/2 cup, and used 6 tablespoons of minced garlic.  I baked it at 375 for 1 hour, turning and basting at 30 minutes.   Served this with Fettucini Alfredo to my family without any left-overs. Thank You for this keeper.

So easy and delicious!  I used chicken tenders instead, but this recipe will definitely work with any cut of chicken.  Along with others, I baked instead of broiling due to my kitchen not having very good ventilation.  And, for easy clean-up, I lined my baking dish with foil.  Fast and simple with great flavor!

I did a chicken half (cut the wings off for another use) using the basting ingredients for this recipe and it was absoutely delicious. After soaking it in cold, salty water for a few hours, I put the chicken on a wire rack positioned on a cookie sheet, basted the chicken with the butter/soy sauce mixture and put it into a preheated 375° oven. I baked it for about 45 minutes, turning and basting a couple of times. Once the chicken reached 180° on a themometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, leaving the chicken on the rack, I turned on the oven's broiler and then broiled it for a couple of minutes on each side to crisp the chicken pieces. It turned out juicy, tender and very tasty. I do recommend saving the pan juices and using for dipping as they are scrumptious. The flavor of the butter and soy sauce combo mixed with the chicken juices is out of this world.

This was quick, easy and quite good. I will make again for my family, with very little tweaking. However with so many people giving it 5 stars I was a little disappointed. This is not a meal I would serve to company. The rating on this site needs to be out of 10, then recipes may get more accurate scoring. Thank you for the recipe avasewell, I did enjoy it.

This was excellent, but I made some changes. I replaced half the butter with olive oil. I added a teaspoon of garlic powder, and a tablespoon of Thai chili paste for a bit of heat. After microwaving the mix, in a bake pan that was lined with foil, I poured all the sauce on the chicken and made sure it was well coated. I had no smoke or splattering. Yummy!

Cooked it for 1 hr at 375.  Cut butter in half.  My husband (who is NOT a big chicken fan) and two year old loved it.  My hubby said it was "excellent".  That makes it a keeper in my book.  : )

This Chicken is absolutely AMAZING!!!! I followed the recipe exactly except just adding about a 1/4 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce. I baked it for about 30 minutes then broiled it for about 8 minutes after that. My husband LOVED LOVED LOVED IT!!!! I will be making this again!

We love this recipe!  I used 3 chicken legs separated into thighs and drumsticks (as that is what I had on hand) and pulled the skin off the thighs but left the skin on the drumsticks.  Used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup olive oil, but I think I can go even less next time.  Baked at 375 for an hour while basting once in a while, then broiled each side for a couple minutes at the end to crisp everything up.  Great tasting chicken -- so juicy & tender!  Smells great while cooking, too!  Drizzled some of the drippings over rice and served with sauteed carrots on the side.  Yummy!!  Thank you for the recipe and the reviews!  It's a keeper!

I made this with fresh parsley and used olive oil instead of butter... this was fantastic, even my daughter licked her fingers!!  I broiled it for about 15 minutes then let it cook a bit longer at 350 for another 20 minutes (since I used chicken on the bone).  A keeper... thanks for sharing!!

What I especially like about this recipes is it tastes great with no marinating. I always forget to defrost my meat in advance, so I never have a chance to marinate. Thanks for an easy, tasty recipe!

I was looking for a new way to prepare chicken, and this was great!  I opted to stick to a 375 oven for about 40 minutes instead of using the broiler, and the recipe was still excellent.  My husband took one bite and immediately ok'd this to be added to our normal chicken meal rotation.

Love this recipe but I substituted butter with olive oil and used less than half a cup. This was because I used chicken thigh with skin so that was fatty enough. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added some honey to the marinade, I also used garlic powder instead of minced garlic and baked the chicken on a bed of onions for 40 minutes. I then finished it off by broiling the chicken (without the onions) for 3 minutes on each side. I served it with potato salad. It was delicious and my husband loved it.

I made this for dinner this evening because I needed to cook a package of boneless, skinless thighs and do it quickly. I cut the ingredients for the butter mixture in half (I didn't want any left over)and it was exactly enough.   I pounded the thighs as recommended by another reviewer and broiled for 5 minutes per side.  They were fantastic.

My family enjoyed this chicken but I think I'll add a spoonful of minced fresh ginger and maybe a dollop of honey next time to balance the intensely salty, soy-y sauce.  Definitely recommend using UNsalted butter.  For 6 thighs I had quite a bit of sauce in the pan.  I think I could easily have done 2 to 4 more pieces to not waste so much sauce.  Thanks to those who recommended baking then broiling. I baked 35 minutes at 375 then broiled 3 to 4 minutes.  Perfect.

This is a real keeper for my crew. I've made it several times, only with split boneless skinless chicken breasts. However, I don't broil it, as I hate that kind of mess. It comes out nicely when I bake it for about 30-35 min on 375. I also make a double batch of the sauce, coat the chicken when it goes in, baste at the 10 and 20 minute mark, and then dump in the rest of the basting liquid into the pan during the last round of basting so it has time to pick up the flavors and cook through. That way, we have a sauce for the pasta or rice I usually make to accompany this dish. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used boneless, skinless breasts and adjusted the cooking time and method. I baked it for 25 minutes at 375 degrees, turning half way through cooking. I then broiled it for a few minutes on each side to crisp up a little. It had really good flavor and was very moist. Will definitely be making again!

Yum! Very tasty. Have made several times now. Only change was to cook for 45 min at 375, turning every 15. I serve it and left over sauce on rice for an Asian feel.

I thought this was very tasty, I used a whole split chicken and baked it.  With the skin on it stayed juicy and browned up nicely.  I only used half the butter called for and kept the rest of the ingredients the same...it was more than enough basting fluid.  Next time, to cut down on the fat even more, I'll use two tablespoons of butter and 1/4 cup chicken stock.

SO GOOD!   (only change was to bake at 375 for about 35 min, then remove from pan - using butter mixture for basting - and broil for about 3 min on each side)

I made this with whole chickens and baked it in the oven.  My kids couldn't get enough.  I thought it was going to be salty, but it wasn't.  Thanks for such a great recipe!  This one is a keeper!

This was awesome!!! Very good!!! I used party wings being as though that was all I had on hand. I took some other reviewers advice and baked the chicken first in the oven for 45 minutes basting and flipping the wings every 15 min. then placing in the broiler 5 min per side, and they came out great!! Thanks for the post!!

DELICIOUS!!  My boyfriend and I are huge garlic lovers, so were very excited about this EASY garlic dinner! Turned out excellent! We are not huge fans of thighs however, so we used chicken breasts (skinless & boneless), and for 2 breasts I made the entire recipe of sauce. I broiled it for about 20 min, turning and basting twice.  Even tough it splattered in my face when I took it out of the over, it still turned out amazing! (Be careful!!) The way the garlic cooks into the chicken is so delicious.  It was SO easy too! Didn't take many ingredients at all...definitely a keeper!

I deboned chicken thighs with skin.  I like the way the chicken cooks better with the skin.  Instead of broiling I took other's suggestion to cook at 375 for 45 mins.

Tasty! Could be a little over-salty, so opt for the low sodium soy sauce...and I baked first also for about 30 mins. (15 mins on each side)...Yummy!

Would be good with wingettes also!!

Now this was REALLY good and easy to make. The reason for only 4 instead of 5 stars is it's incredibly fatty from all the butter and fat from the skin, but I guess that's what makes it taste so good.

We just had these for dinner and I must say pretty good!  I did a little differently.  Same ingrediants but let marinate in the mix for awhile. The butter, however, did cool so became kind of like a paste when cooked.  I rubbed the mix all over then barbequed. With the reamining "Paste" I microwaved until melted again and brushed on as cooking. By the way if you microwave mixture for 2 minutes you will burn the butter or it will splat all over the micro!  Must be a typo. Very nice flavor which the kids even really liked so a keeper!

Great recipe I followed it exactly. It did take longer than 20 minutes to cook through (about 40). I also removed the skin so it was healthier. My daughter finally ate a WHOLE piece of chicken and both my son and mother in law had 2 as well. The only change i may make next time is to marinate it for about 12 hours before cooking. Very easy and delish!

This was awsome! Very flavorful! My family loved it (even my picky children). The only changes was I cooked the chicken in the oven covered with aluminum for 1hr and the browned it under the brolier until brown and crispy!

Mild, savory flavor. I used boneless, skinless thighs. I took other reviewers advice and baked at 375 for about 40 min, basteing every 15 or so. Then, under the broiler for about 5 or so to "crisp" up the top. My family liked it. Thanks!

Very tasty, tender and flavorful! I baked chicken thighs, and the garlic smell in the apartment was delicious. I used a combo of butter and olive oil and fresh parsley, but next time I will either use more parsley or the dried variety, as I could barely taste it in the glaze.

This recipe is awesome!! It's amazing to me that just a few ingredients mixed together can taste so good! I used about 1/2 the butter and boneless, skinless chicken because that's all I had. I cooked it at 375 for about 30 min, turning 1/2 way. I sliced it thinly and served it over white rice with some of the juice poured over. SO yummy!! Thanks for the recipe!!

This was great!  My husband said, "These are very, very, very good!"  I did make some changes like others - 1/2 butter and 1/2 extra-virgin olive oil, 1/2 soy (low sodium) and 1/2 worchestershire sauce, and pounded thin and baked them.  I had five thighs and after cooking there was a lot of sauce left, so I put four boneless breasts in the sauce and cooked those (that's what I prefer).  I served over couscous (made with chicken stock) and it was great - the extra sauce was nice for the couscous.  To the original poster of the recipe - I don't think boneless thighs *do* come with skin on - perhaps when AR figured the nutritional content the only selection was w/ skin on?  I was glad I had low-sodium soy sauce b/c it was a little salty.  I will use unsalted butter next time to help with that.

Family loved it!  Moist and tasty.  We used legs and thighs - smelled great while cooking.  Tried the 375 for about 45 minutes as suggested by others.  Used a little less butter.  Thanks for a great one!

Excellent. Made this recipe once with skinless and boneless thighs and once with whole leg quarters. Delicious both ways and the equal of a *properly* roasted chicken, but faster! I make mine on a rack in my roasting pan, positioned so that the top surface of the chicken is about 5 inches from the broiler element. Turn and baste every 7 or 8 minutes. 20 minutes for thighs, about 30 for leg quarters. Second time, I added  onion powder which seemed to enhance an already terrific recipe.

This was fantastic.  My 11-year old daughter can be very picky, especially if there is garlic involved, however she raved about this.  It was so tender, juicy and flavorful, but not over the top.

I made this with bone-in chicken quarters (thighs and legs).  I added the worch sauce as previous commenters suggested (in = ration to soy sauce).  There is no way you can avoid smoking up your house.  The result however was worth it.  I only took one star away because of the smokefest.  I opened some windows and we gobbled it down!  Yum.

This was so easy and had a wonderful flavor.  The sauce could be used when grilling chicken outdoors on the grill.  I used four chicken thighs(but could not find boneless) and one large boneless chicken breast.  I liked the breast better because I prefer white meat.  I set my broiler on high, but when the smoke detector went off, I set it down to low and it cooked perfectly for just under 18 minutes.  Will definitely bookmark this one!!

This was easy and tasty.  However, I had never broiled chicken before, and so I ended up turning the skin black.  Luckily, we could just pull it off and the meat underneath was good!  I only gave it 4 stars because it is so fatty.  I think next time I will use less butter.  It's a bit much and the fat from the chicken just adds more.

This was good, but may be better with a different cut of chicken.  Had to use garlic powder.  Had good flavor, but the chicken came out a little greasy and really needed to broil longer.  May try with split breasts next time and bake instead of broil.

It was a great success! Both my sons loved it. I followed the recipe exactly. Although I made it with skinless boneless thighs, I can see how this would be great with skin on. Will definitely be making this on a regular basis!

So so yummy and easy! I broiled the chicken in a larger flat pan, but moved to a smaller cooking dish and that seemed to decrease the smokiness. Husband said this was the best chicken he’s tasted in years - restaurants included!

I made as directed & it was great. I broiled on low, basting a few times cooking chicken legs & thighs (bone-in), what I had on hand. Family loved it. I separated a small amount of the marinade & used as a dressing over steamed French green beans.

Like others, I baked at 375 for 45 minutes instead of broiling to reduce the amount of "hands on" time from basting. Moist and delicious! Served with steamed broccoli and roasted yams and onions.

This is one of my favorites to make with chicken or pork. Great for chicken thighs to make a cheap meal. After the meat is done and removed I stir in a can of cream of mushroom into the juices. Makes a delicious gravy for the top of the meat and rice! Try it you won't be disappointed!

Loved it! I needed something new and different and this was it! My family loved it! My wife couldn't get enough of it! I dont have a broiler pan, I just use my cast iron skillet, and turn the chicken every five minutes. Worked out great and was done just right!

Very tasty. The amount of butter concerns me though. Probably only need 1/3 cup. I baked the chicken in a 9x13 Pyrex dish for ~35 minutes at 375F. That worked well. I also added sliced onions and dry rice. The rice cooked so-so. Next time I'll add more veggies to the dish and cook a pot of rice separately. But overall, very tasty and easy/quick to make.

This was very easy and quick. I will make it again.  I used 6 chicken thighs and there was a lot of the butter mixture left over so I would cut that in half.   I broiled it for about 10 min. on each side then turned the oven to 375 C. for another 20 min.

I give it 5 stars for easy prep! Flavor was good thus the 3 stars. But just good (4 stars would be very good and 5 stars I say excellent). Wish we could give 1/2 stars - I would say 3.5.  Family didn't complain but didn't comment positively either. Needed a little more flavor. I made it exactly as written. The broiling method worked great (lower rack - 10 minutes then flip and 10 more). Used boneless, skinless chicken thighs. I will make it again though - budget friendly and easy! Thanks

I followed the recipe exactly, with boneless, skinless thighs, except I baked them at 375 for 35 minutes or so and used light soy. I turned them over halfway thru and spooned the juices over.  This was tasty, and its a simple, easy recipe that you can use on chicken with stuff you probably have on hand-butter, garlic, dried parsley and soy.  Will make again.

You HAVE to try this recipe! This was delicious! The sauce was great and so easy - however,  I omitted the pepper (personal choice). I made it with bone-in thighs and legs on a foil lined baking sheet. Spooned the sauce over each piece and baked at 375 for 20 minutes. Basted again and baked another 20 minutes. Flipped them, basted and broiled for 7 minutes, then flipped, basted and broiled for another 7. They smelled amazing and tasted even better. YUM!

I made it as listed.  It was EASY, healthy, and pretty good.  I will make it again.  This is an IDEAL week night recipe.  Takes five minutes to prepare.  I would describe this as kid-friendly, as well.

The cooking time was MUCH longer than indicated.  Closer to 40 mins.  Twenty seemed a little short given my lifelong relationship with chicken.  Look, this isn't a culinary sensation, but its really quite tasty and the prep-time could only be shorter if you threw it in the oven with just salt and pepper.  Not to mention, every ingredient was in my cabinet.  Didn't have to buy a thing.

.... and I cant believe this isn't the most helpful review.

Kept it real and made little changes.  The only thing I did different was to bake it in the oven (350 for about 40 minutes - convection oven).  Both my girls (11 & 7) loved it and I agree.  Easy and good.

I would rate this recipe 5 stars for how easy it is to prepare. Unfortunately, it needs a bit of salt. I do however added a bit more garlic to flavor the chicken a bit more and also added a bit more parsley. Other  than that, the recipe is good as is. I prepared the chicken in advance the previous night to let it marinate with the seasoning ingredients and before putting it in the oven prepared the butter mixture with a bit of extra ingredients. Then, I did follow the suggestion of first baking it at 375F for 35 minutes to cook the chicken through before browning it a bit under the broiler for exactly 5 minutes per side....It was very tasty despite the bit of salt I felt was missing....I usually eat very low in salt, but I still felt it needed some more. Just a bit! 

Keeper!

I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts. We loved this recipe so much that I am making it again tonight for dinner. When I told my husband that was what will be for dinner with asparagus and rice, he cheered!

I used chicken legs, since that is what I had on hand.  Because of the skin, I chose to bake for 45 mins and then broiled 5 mins on each side.  It came out juicy and perfectly cooked.  The sauce here is very tasty, but it seem to only be tasted on the outside.  I think that it needed to be marinated some.  Maybe, if I didn't have the skin it would have been through out.

This was phenomenal!!  I baked 8 boneless, skinless thighs in this delicious garlicky, soy sauced butter for 40 minutes at 375, turning them every 10 minutes.  Crazy easy, crazy deliciousness!

This is an easy and delicious dinner to prepare after a long day of work and I'm lost with what to make.  Tastes like I spent all day on it but it was just tossed together.  I followed advice of others and bake it for the majority of the time and then broil it the last 8-10 minutes on my low broiler setting.  The whole family can't get enough and it's now a weekly staple on our dinner table.  Is particularly yummy with long grain and wild rice on the side.

This was full of flavor.  Lots of garlic.  I used 4 boneless thighs so I only used 2 cloves of garlic and 1 clove would have been fine.  I also used fresh parsley and half the butter.  I served it over a salad which didn't need any dressing because of the flavor of the chicken.

I am at High Altitude here in Big Bear CA so i baked bone-in thighs at 375 for 45 minutes as other reviewers said. I then removed the chicken to a broiler pan and  broiled, turning pieces over after 6 minutes to crisp both sides of the skin. I drained off the juices into a saucepan and added 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup white wine. My sauce "broke" when i cooked it so I used my Bullet Blender to smooth it which worked perfectly! I served it all with brown rice. My family loved it! I have leftover sauce to serve with pork another day. Yum!!!

Very easy recipe & it tasted fantastic!! I made a few adjustments; (but the sauce stayed exactly the same) I use boneless, skinless chicken breast & sliced them, then I served them on top of buttered noodles with a little Parmesan cheese.  My kids loved it & I will definitely make this again!!

I was trying to find a chickem thigh recipe that wouldnvit my low carb diet and this fit the bill.  I did not want to use all the butter,so i substituted 1/4 cup f light olive oil.  I think that  even that could have been reduced.  It was delicious!  Very tasty.  I want to try chicken breat next time!

Just made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious!  All three of my young boys devoured it - and my youngest hardly ever eats dinner!  I saved one chicken for my husband to taste, and he skipped on his diet tonight because it was so good.  I used bone in chicken thighs and it was tender and juicy, the garlic was divine - I neve knew broiling thighs for 20 minutes works - I always baked it for at least 45 minutes because it just took so long to fully cook.  Great recipe, definitely part of the rotation in this household!

LOVE this recipe and so does the rest of the family.  It has been added to the list of rotational favorites (which is pretty big, so I make it about once a month).  I did take the suggestion of one of the other reviewers though and I BAKE @ 375 for about 45 minutes.  I don't bother broiling it and it seems to come out just fine.  I also almost always use boneless skinless chicken thighs which I have found come out best when they have plenty of room in the baking dish and aren't crowded.

Loved this marinade. The sauce was pretty good on it's own, but I added a dash of worcestershire and a few spoonfuls of brown sugar to the mix which made it even better (in my opinion!). I did whole chicken legs on a rack on a cookie sheet, with the mixture in between the chicken meat and the skin. I baked them for about 40 minutes and right at the end, I turned on the broiler and basted with the leftover sauce. Love that crispy chicken skin! I also saved a bit of the mixture and added it to the green beans I cooked on the stovetop as a side. Crazy good. I think I liked the green beans even better than the chicken. I actually had to make more for dinner because I kept snacking on them while waiting for the chicken to cook. :)

I gonna give this 5 stars...simply because this recipe gave me (a begginer cook who is very TIMID in the kitchen) the courage to try something new. I got ready to make it and realized I didn't have soy sauce, but rather than give up I made a substitution and it was delicious.  Thank you Avasewell for the inspiration...can't wait to see what it tastes like when I can actually follow your recipe to the T.

WOW! this was so delicious, my kids and I had seconds. This recipe will be repeated in my home! Only thing I may do is use unsalted butter and a touch less than a whole stick. But YUMMO! it was tasty and fast. thanks for posting!

Like most, I bake at 375. This is our go-to meal over brown rice. I add mushrooms and such sometimes as well. Love it!

I made this for a family dinner and everyone loved it. I did 8 thighs, bone in/skin on. I didn't change the sauce but I think I'll cut it down by 1/3 or 1/2 next time. There was just too much of it, but some used it as a gravy for mashed potatoes. I was told it was even better as left overs.

Reviewer Audra is spot on with her recommendation on baking first, then broiling.  I baked 17 mins on each side, basting each time, then broiled each side for about 5 mins at the end.  I prefer skinless so I take the skin off 2 of the thighs for myself and then prepare the others with skin on for my family.  Both methods of preparation are delish and everyone loves this recipe!    Perfect for weeknights.

I made this according to directions, using a cut up chicken.  It was fabulous and everyone loved it!  The only thing I would do different (and only because I had chicken breasts) is to leave in the breasts for a few extra minutes.  I will definitely be making this again!

I love this recipe! My family loves it and it's super easy. I like to marinate the meat ahead and let it sit in the fridge until I'm ready to cook.

This was really good - everyone loved it!  I followed another reviewers suggestion and baked at 375 for 45 minutes.  I flipped the chicken once about half-way through.  A very simple and quick dinner to throw together, especially during those busy weeknights!  Thank you!

I absolutely love garlic, and soy sauce, but three tablespoons of each was just waaaaayyyyyyy too much. Almost too much for me to handle. The dish would've been very greasy and too buttery if I had not added white rice to the mix. On a good note, the chicken was very moist, and tasted pretty okay.

Good recipe! Did quite a bit of modifications to make it tastier. 
1) I marinaded the chicken with soy sauce, pepper and garlic for an hour in the fridge before basting it with the butter mixture and cooking it
2) I baked it at 375 for 30 minutes - flipping it over 15 minute interval
3) I broiled it for 5 minutes on each side.

ALSO - I used kikkoman low sodium soy sauce which is 10000x tastier than basic soy sauce

Love this recipe! My husbands favorite! Instead of chopping garlic, I have ready chopped garlic (or in my case: fried garlic) and put the same amount in the recipe! Delish! I found that broiled on high, 10 min on each side (flipped) does the trick. I make this at least once a week!

This dish is amazing! I did change up the way I cooked it though. I listened to a couple other reviewers and baked it at 375 degrees instead of broiling it and turned it every 15 minutes. I covered the dish with tinfoil to keep the chicken from drying out and my family had to fight for the extra piece of chicken that was left over it was SO good. Definitely will make again and again.

YUMMM!! This is a simple recipe; came home late from work one night so I just wanted to fix something quick to eat.  I made half of the portion so I reduced all the measurements by half.  I love this recipe because broiling cuts down the cook time by half vs baking.  The only thing I did differently was I broiled the chicken on LOW setting on the upper rack for 20mins, flipped the chicken over and broiled for another 3mins becuz the meat was slightly pink after the first 20mins.  I will make this again!

I made this last night using bone-in chicken thighs with skin and followed the recipe as it was written.  For me, the butter was just much too much.  The thighs ended up swimming in grease.  I made it for a first-time guest we had over and wished I had made something lighter.  It was a greasy meal.

Absolutely wonderful!  We just had this for dinner.  I followed the directions as written and it couldn't have been easier.  The chicken turned out so juicy and was delicious.  My husband is cleaning up after dinner so that I can get in here and write this review.  He seconds my opinion!  Thanks!!!

I have made this about a dozen times now and it comes out perfect every time. This is unbelievably simple and has turned my sweetheart into a chicken lover. He asked for it again tonight. The bonuses are that it's great as a a leftover and it's an inexpensive meal to make for a crowd.

Made it again last night.  I had a family size chicken thigh package (10 thighs) so I just made 7.  Husband ate 2 then came back and asked for 2 more!  Came home tonight and the rest were gone!!!  He asked me to make the last 3 for tonight. I loved this and was so easy to make.   DH loves anything with garlic so this was right on

This chicken is moist and flavorful.  I baked at 375 because I couldn't finish my sides in 20 minutes.  I look forward to broiling on hectic night and still serving a great dinner.

This was amazing. I made it exactly as the recipe suggested, except I made it for just 2.  My husband hates dark meat so I didn't mention that it was thighs. He was going on and on about how amazing it was while he was eating it. When he had eaten all of it I told him it was thighs and blew his mind. We have a new dinner staple at my table. I served it with a Caesar side salad and mashed potatoes, it was a fantastic meal.

This was great. It smelled amazing as it cooked.  I also listened to other reviewers and baked at 375 for 45 minutes.  The chicken is cooked perfectly this way.  Also, I only used half the butter and it tasted great and had less fat

I made this with chicken breast and it was okay. Cooked at 350 for 30 minutes. The chicken was juicy and tender but didn't find it had any flavour from the butter mixture. Served with rice and asparagus.

Tried it when I made another recipe using chicken thighs, and could only find a family pack of chicken at the store. Put the chicken in a zip-top freezer bag; put the glaze stuff in a bowl. Let it thaw in the fridge, then warmed the glaze and poured it over just before broiling. It was AMAZING. I wanted to lick the pan.

Definitely a new favorite!  I baked mine for 45 minutes on 375 and then broiled for about 5 or 10 minutes, long enough to make it crispy.  The thighs keep it from drying out, I have a problem with white meat being to dry.  Very flavorful!!

I had four boneless/skinless thighs but no idea what to to with them.  I wanted a quick easy meal with ingredients that I already had at home so luckily I found this recipe. It was tasty and simple to make! The next time I'll try 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup butter which seems a tad more healthy.

This chicken was amazing!!! My entire family devoured it and said this needed to become a regular dinner.  I was worried about all the butter but the chicken was not greasy, just flavorful.

Hooked on this chicken! Kids love it. Husband loved it. What more could I ask for?? It's easy, simple and full if flavor! I usually make a side of basmati rice and naan bread to soak up all the lovely sauce and juices. Must try it! Believe me. It's worth it!

1. Siiiiimple & easy and little to clean up
2. My house smelled ammmmmmmmazing
3. My husband said, "this is the best baked chicken you have ever made. It tastes like something you get at a restaurant!"

I used the bake method at 375 for 40 min. Put some juices on it about halfway through. Broiled each side for 5 min. after I baked it.

I served with jasmine rice cooked in chicken broth.

Buttery and rich :) but wooooooondetful flavor!! 
Thank you for the hit!!!

I made this last night for dinner and my husband really liked it! I made the recipe exactly as posted and it turned out fabulous. I may have put a little extra garlic ( we love garlic!). This recipe is easy, and does not take long. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and poured most the mixture over the thighs in the baking dish. I turned the peices about every 5 minutes and basted with the extra liquid. Turned out very moist with a good flavor. I served with sauteed mixed squash and rice. Thank you for posting, will make again! I gave it 4 stars bc i don't think it really needs that much butter.

I've actually never cooked chicken before (newbie cook!) but it's seriously easy to make and so flavorful. Ran out of parsley and substituted rosemary, which was great with the chicken, too. Definitely going to make this again - and again, and again!

I made the recipe as stated except I fluctuated between low and high broil so it took longer to bake.  Taste like garlic bread.  I would call it garlic bread chicken.  Will definitely make again.
Update, made again with 7 pieces of bone in chicken thighs, lots of sauce.  Still delicious.

Oh my GOSH this was so good - the whole family loved it -even my little grandson!!!

I baked mine in a 350 degree oven instead of broiling.. and as with some of the other reviewers, I used my low sodimu soy sauce.. but otherwise followed the directions...it was tender, tasty and outright scrumptious!!

We ate this tonight. It was very easy and tasty! My 8 year old son loved it and so did I. It smells great while cooking and has wonderful flavor with a few simple ingredients. I used the amounts shown for seasoning, but I did not broil it I baked at 375F. I had free range chicken thighs and breasts so they were smaller than the monster sizes you see in the other commercial brands. But, they have more flavor and are worth it. I had 5 thighs, and 3 breast in a greased 9x13. I cooked it at 375F for 45 min. and it was perfect. The thighs juices keep the breast meat moist. It does not lack in flavor as the soy replaces the salt. (I did salt and pepper the meat a tiny bit before topping with the butter/soy mixture). It was tender, flavor and worth keeping on the regular menu rotation.

This recipe was amazing! I think anyone who didn't like it before might not have made it right. The chicken was so juicy and the favors were amazing. I made mine with green beans with garlic, water chestnuts and soy sauce. Served with rice. Next time I might try a stick of actual garlic butter I get from publix and see how that goes. Also use FRESH garlic like it shows not that refrigerated . Def a must try!

Savory!  My daughter and I really loved it but my husband said it was alright.  I had baked mine then caramelized on the stovetop.

I omitted the parsley and added a little chicken broth to the buttery goodness...Used gluten free soy sauce, fresh black pepper, tons of minced garlic and some green onions, stuffed the chicken with goat cheese and the butter mixture and baked up to perfection. yum!

I made this recipe exactly how it was meant to be and it was really really good. I don't think you need to alter the recipe like others suggest. I used boneless skinless thighs and paired with brown rice and broccoli. My boyfriend went back for seconds! It was perfect for a weeknight, quick, but very nice dinner. Even looked nice on the plate! Thank you again for sharing.

insted of broiling, baked this instead. tastes like the rotisserie u buy in frys--only did not get the chance to soak up on the flavors that much. if i make this again, will try marinating it first for more flavors.

Tried this for the first time last night.  Took the suggestion of another review to bake first but takes so much longer.  The broiling browns the meat really nicely.  I also only used half of the butter and it tasted great.  I will definitely add this to my weeknight rotation of meals.

I did alter the recipe from others' suggestions.  I used Olive oil instead since I didn't have butter and I used another's suggestion for 2tbl's soy and 1 balsalmic (sp?)vinegar but next time I will try the recipe exactly as it said. I also baked, then broiled since a lot of people suggested it.  Anyway, it was really good and I hate soy and vinegar so that's saying something.

The smell of it cooking made me wish I wasn't a vegetarian.  I baked it at 375 for 33 minutes and broiled it for 5.  Came out perfect and the kids absolutely loved it.  Said it was better than the boneless chicken breasts I usually make.  Home run! The only changes were 1/4 cup smart balance and a little less than 1/4 cup of olive oil.  I also was out of parsley so used Basil.  No fighting to finish dinner tonight!

Tried the recipe as submitted, too much butter and too salty. Next go round I plan to cut the butter and soy sauce in half. Broiling worked well with the boneless/skinless chicken thighs.

Easy to cook and tasty. Had with chorzo, onion, potato and kumera pan fried cubes dressed with chopped chilli and salad.
I used 2T sunflower oil, Kikoman soy sauce and one large elephant garlic bulb with three chicken thighs. and dressed with 1 T balsamic vinegar.

My family loved this! Substitutions were used because of what I had handy. I pounded boneless skinless chicken breasts(after reading a review) and spooned the sauce on top for about 5 minutes before putting it under the broiler. We use Smart Balance instead of butter. I only had to cook 5 minutes on each side using the rest of the sauce after turning them. I cooked angel hair pasta in the meantime. When I took them out of the oven, I cut the chicken into cubes, mixed the pasta and chicken together in the sauce and then added freshly chopped equal parts parsley and basil and served in the baking dish.  There were no leftovers.

It was absolutely delish! My boyfriend loved it!! I didn't have time to go out and buy parsley so i used oregano, thyme leaves and basil leaves instead, added a nice mixture of taste, but I definitely will cook this again and will try the parsley next time.

This was just ok.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs. I used the rest of the recipe as is. It was flavourful, but the garlic flavour was a bit overbearing and I like garlic normally. My husband felt the same way. I think if the garlic was reduced and a sweetener added like honey, it would be better. We ended up dipping the chicken in Thai sweet chili sauce to salvage it.

My chicken came out beautiful.  Unfortunately not the awesome flavor I was expecting.  I've made many soy sauce based marinades and they are indeed awesome.  I think this would have been better if I had marinated the chicken for a couple hours prior to cooking.  I will try again, but next time I will marinade for a couple hours if not overnight to let the chicken absorb the flavors before cooking.

This had a good flavor; I used with skinless chicken breast halves.  Seemed like the chicken swam in a pool of butter, though, cutting down on the ability for the chicken to get a crispy outside.  So I may try again with 2-3 tablespoons butter and 3 tablespoons olive oil instead.  Will keep everything else the same!

Really easy!  I made 2 small changes due to large amount of butter.  I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup olive oil.  I baked at 375 for 25 minuted in the sauce and then basted the thighs and broiled them for 5 minutes.  DELICIOUS and EASY!!!  The garlic is not over-powering and real garlic lovers can even add more.  I had no parsley so I used rosemary as another reviewer had suggested.  I microwaved the sauce for about 2 minutes in small intervals to release the garlic and spice flavors into the butter & oil.  YUM YUM YUM

I made this for lunch today, my husband loved it!  I cooked four thighs because it's just my husband and I.  I made too much sauce, so I saved it and will serve the chicken with a pasta tomorrow using the leftover sauce. My broiler is in the bottom of the oven, so I baked the chicken.

Very tasty, even though I used only 1/2 the butter. To avoid smoking up the house, bake at 375 F (for about 30 mins), move chicken to a clean cookie sheet, & broil each side about 5 mins.

Easy and quick. I used extra 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil and 1/4 cup butter, baked at 375 deg. for 30 minutes, then at 425 deg. for an additional 15 minutes and finally broiling on high for 5 minutes to get the top crispy. Everyone loved it.

I never made chicken with these ingredients and this was awesome. The ingredients blended really well and it was delish on top of jasmine rice with veggies on the side.

My husband and I both really enjoy this recipe. I usually make it with boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Such a quick and easy chicken recipe to make any weeknight!

Very tasty, and easy to make.  I made this with chicken thighs.  Baked for 45 minutes at 375 and then put them under the broiler for a few minutes.  Will make again!

This was sooo good!  I didn't have a metal baking pan that I could use with a broiler, so I did the baking method listed previously using my glass baking pan.  The flavor was amazing and the chicken was perfectly cooked.  I can't wait to make this again.

Sooooo good!  I replaced some of the soy sauce with red wine vinegar and the parsley with some weird sun-dried tomato spice, added some cayenne and red pepper flakes.  Other than that, followed cooking instructions to the letter and this came off fabulously!  Will make this a regular rotation in my meal planning.  I'm too cheap to buy chicken breast but I usually do prefer it.  This was tastier than any chicken breast recipe I've ever had.

I really liked this.  Since I used chicken thighs with the bones in but removed the skins, I needed to broil the chicken for an extra 5 minutes on each side.

I also removed the skins for personal preference, but laid the skins on top of the chicken meat for the first 20 minutes of broiling so that the chicken wouldn't char, removing them so the chicken would still brown nicely.

I do a halved chicken, cook for 55 minutes - 65 minutes until no longer pink, and then broil for 5 minutes.

Our family loved this recipe! My husband is a big broiled chicken fan and wanted me to make a new yet good recipe! I stumbled across this recipe and decided to give it a try! Boy was it a success!!!! We all loved it (including my very picky 4 yr. old daughter!)
(one slight change I did was that I used margarine instead of butter.) I served it with garlic roasted couscous! 
Would def. make this recipe again and recommend it highly to others! Thanks for posting!

I doubled this and threw the chicken on the grill.  I didn't use foil, but probably should have to cut down on the flames.  But actually, it really charred up nice.  It had a crisp charred skin and really juicy meat!  I then took the left overs the next day, threw some bottled BBQ on it and popped it in the microwave - WOW!  the char mixed with the BBQ made it taste like it just came off the grill again!

AMAZING! One of the best chicken recipes I've ever made. This recipe is good as is, but if you'd like to make it ever so slightly healthier, use half the butter, a tablespoon less soy sauce (I used the low- sodium variety) and boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Will definitely make again!

This was a HIT. I cut the butter in half and baked it at 375 for 45 minutes. Next time I think I'll throw it under the broiler for the last 5-10 minutes. Thanks for the simple and tasty recipe!

My family loved this dish very simple but flavorful. I changed it up only because well i used what i had...boneless skinless thighs. because skinless, i chose not to broil but bake at 375 until cooked, marinated/basted multiple times while cooking.  Very juicy.  will be making again

We thought this was an easy yummy way to prepare chicken thighs.  I threw it all together in less than an hour (which is strange for me LOL!) I didn't change anything- used regular soy sauce, and thought it needed a little salt.  I put the thighs on a broiling pan - so I had no issues with smoke.  Will make again since it's so easy, and I usually have all the ingredients on hand.

Excellent recipe! Fast and easy and one the whole family loves! I did use skinless thighs. Also, If you line your oven rack with a couple pieces of foil, you will have A LOT less smoke.

This recipe was delicious! The garlic caramelized over the chicken beautifully. The aroma filled up the house and picky eaters where asking me for a plate. Will definitely make this again, but I will try chicken breast instead of thighs because the skin did and butter did make the chicken a bit greasy.

Really easy and yummy for a quick lunch! I used a boneless skinless chicken breast, pounded it thin, and broiled it on high for 5 minutes a side. I did make a fair amount of smoke that way, though.

Tried this tonight for the first time, but it definitely will not be the last!!!  WOW this Chicken was melt in your mouth amazing!  Even my picky 3 year old ate a full serving. The only thing I changed was I added a couple dashes powdered ginger &  a bit of splenda to add a little sweetness ONLY because I was in the mood for a Chinese style flavor. I plan to try it again as written. I also found that baking it at 375 for 45 minutes was all the cooking time needed. This is delicious and AFFORDABLE with rice and broccoli around $10 for a family of 4. YUMM Thanks for sharing  (=

This recipe is delicious just the way it is!  I've used different cuts of chicken and it's still great.  I've switched to using fresh parsley and so much more fresh garlic but that's my spin on it.  It's wonderful either way and I get cheers from the kids when they see the "green sauce" being made!!

Very tasty but as I should have anticipated from the ingredients it was fairly greasy/heavy due to all the butter.  Yummy though.

This was quick, easy & good! I used boneless, skinless, thighs. The variables I used are: 1 Tbsp roasted garlic + 3 Tbsp regular. I baked instead of broiling.  Next time, I will use soy/Worcestershire, or soy/balsamic. I may also use chicken breasts.  This made the rotation list.

this was so good and flavorful...I used chicken breasts, fresh parsley, and reduced sodium soy sauce. So happy with how good and simple this was. I used the broiler for about 13 min...awesome! Thanks

This is fantastic!  I used chicken breasts instead of thighs and baked them for 35 minutes at 350 degress, then turned on the broiler for a few minutes to brown both sides of the chicken.  Other than that, I didn't change the recipe at all and it came out awesome served over rice!

I am a dad and even my SUPER-picky kids were impressed with my skills.  My wife is beginning to think I am paying someone to bring in meals for us!  This is super simple to make tastes even better the next day.

Added more garlic and took the advice of baking instead of broiling to avoid the smoke.  What a great recipe!

Very easy and versatile recipe! Love it! I usually use chicken thighs, and bake @375 for about 45 mins and then broil for a couple minutes to get a nice crispy skin. I also use italian seasoning for the parsley. The chicken comes out moist and flavorful!

I used 1/2 a stick of butter instead of the whole stick. I think it was delicious I think it needed a little more soy sauce.  So the next time I cook this dish I will add another TBSP of Soy.  I enjoyed it very much :)

This is my all time favority recipe!  I agree with another reviewer about baking it on 375 for 45 minutes, or so... just enough time to make rice & sides.  I've also made this chicken recipe in egg rolls with cabbage...DELICIOUS!  So quick & easy yet tasty.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very yummy even without the parsley.  I used Earth Balance instead of butter and it turned out fine. I did have to broil a bit longer, but that is probably just my oven.  Will make it again- very simple to make and went great with rice and greens.

Family loved it!  I followed suggestions to bake first, then broiled for 5 minutes on each side.  I halved the butter, and used lower sodium soy sauce, with no skin thighs.  Will make again soon, doubleing the recipe, to serve  the leftovers on top of salad.

Delicious!  I baked for 35 mins at 350.  So tender and moist!!!  I liked someones suggestion of topping it with Sauted Mushrooms....I had some on hand, it I sauted them with a little bit of the basting sauce and it was as if they were meant to be!

This is so good! .....and quick! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and broiled them about 8 minutes on each side, basting when I flipped them. The chicken had great flavor and was nice and crisp on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. I will be using this recipe again for sure!

I'm a vegetarian so it's hard for me to rate the taste but it was so easy. I made this for my boyfriend last night. I read another review and put it in the oven at 375 for 45min.  I covered in foil wrap for the first 25min and then took off for the last 20min. It turned out amazing. I used skinless/boneless chicken breasts and didn't use all sauce. I had time for rice, sauteed snap peas for him and was able to make my dinner. So awesome!!

I, like other reviewers, baked the chicken then broiled  for 5 minutes on each side to finish it off.  The flavor was great and the smell of the sauce was fantastic.

REALLY really good! I read some of the reviews and instead of broiling the whole time, I baked them at 350 for about 20 minutes, turned them over, baked another 20 minutes, then broiled each side for about 5-10 minutes. It took a bit longer than I expected, but probably because one of the thighs was pretty large. Overall, the taste was awesome. This is a definite "go to" recipe for my family, and it was VERY easy! Thanks so much for sharing!!

This recipe is full of flavor and has such few ingredients!  This first time I made it as is . . .awesome!  The 2nd time I didn't have parsley so I substituted basil in place of parsley . . .liked even better!  The third time I used basil and grated some fresh 1 tbls. ginger and added to soy mixture after boiling. Used 1/2 the amount of butter to reduce fat content . . . YUMMY!

This is great!  The only thing I did differently was remove the skin of the chicken.  A MUST try!

Very tasty and easy. I also baked it for 20 minutes at 400 degrees then broiled it for 10-15 more minutes. I used rosemary and herbs de provence instead of the parsley and it was great. Also I used drumsticks instead of thighs. Will make it again.

Great recipe.... I did however cut out some of the butter, and another time I used half butter and half olive oil.   Used Kikkoman soya sauce which I think has better flavour.

Love love love this recipe!!! I make it all of the time for my family and when I want to impress friends that come over for supper (when I have limited time to make dinner). I make this recipe with 1/2 worchestershire and 1/2 soya as one other person mentioned in their review. I also season and brown chicken before broiling it for 10 minutes on one side and then another 10 on the other side.

I HATE eating thighs, they gross me out, but it's all i had in the fridge. Gave this recipe a try and it was delicious! My husband was amazed. I did bake then broil as previously advised, and used balsamic vinegar. Made a great gravy out of drippings to top sweet potatoes. Great base, thanks!!! Pretty sure husband will make the next time he has to cook at firehouse.

I didn't broil these, I baked them, and they turned out good.  I used breasts instead of thighs.  These recipe is nice because it tastes good and uses things most people have on hand.

So simple & tasty!  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  Broiled on high for 10 minutes on one side, flipped them over and broiled for another 10 minutes.  Very flavorful and juicy!

20 minutes on Broil left me with a very cooked outside and a raw inside. My husband and son watched hungrily as I checked the chicken several times and had to put it back in the oven several times (after changing oven to 350 degrees). The aroma from the kitchen was wonderful, but the chicken did not have the flavor I had hoped for. My husband said the skin was flavorful, but I'm not big on that part and had removed mine. Overall, I think the recipe was good, but I will definitely read the reviews and try adding more/different seasonings for the next go around... AND only use the broiler for the last few minutes of cook time.

This was an easy and tasty recipe. I baked the chicken for about 40 minutes at 350 then broiled it until nicely browned. I will make this again!

4.5 stars.  I used a whole cut up chicken, baked before broiling as others had suggested and used 6 tbsp butter.  We loved how this tasted.  The wings (normally my least favorite piece) were especially good cold the next day.  I'll definitely be making this again.

This chicken was AMAZING. So juicy and flavorful, but not overpowering. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and half olive oil/half Earth Balance in place of the butter (we're GFCF). I also baked this instead of broiling. I will definitely be making this again!

I've made this several times now because it is often requested by my husband for dinner.  I use boneless skinless chicken tighs and lite soy sauce.  I dump all the ingredients into a zip lock bag and coat chicken.  I don't even mess with basting.  It turns out nice and moist every time.

I did like some people did and baked boneless/skinless chicken breasts. I also used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup olive oil. One more thing that I did was use 1 1/2 Tbsps. soy sauce and 1 1/2 Tbsps.  worcestershire sauce. Everyone liked it

Very tender and moist! Instead of broiling it, I baked it at 375 for about 45 minutes, turning every 15 minutes. Also, we used chicken tenders. Our four year old says it's his favorite chicken!

I thought this was good.  Not bad, not great.  My whole house smelled like garlic all night, and I only used half! ha ha It was easy to prepare though, I made it with boneless, skinless breasts because that's all I had, and it was good.  My picky 4 year old ate it, so that's saying something.  :)

This is an excellent chicken recipe. I used the chicken thighs with the bones and it turned out so yummy! I cooked at 375 for 45-50 mins and kept basting with the butter mixture and it turned out to me like rotisserie chicken!!

This was so easy! I did make some changes, but I would still give it 5 stars just for the simplicity of it :) First I didn't have parsley so I sub'd it w/ rosemary, second added more garlic then called for (we really love garlic!), then I had left over bacon so I wrapped the chicken in a piece of bacon! I had left the skin on, but with the bacon I should've taken it off. 20 mins in the broiler and it was done! Even my 1 year old loved it! Will definitely be making it again.

This is a keeper.  I made it exactly as called for except for doubling the recipe for our family of 8 & and baking it at 375 for 45 minutes. This allowed me to put it in the oven and do errands and come back to a wonderful smelling house.  Even the picky eaters in the family loved it. Thanks a ton!!!

This recipe was absolutely phenomenal!  My children literally argued over who would eat the last piece of chicken the next day.  Since I am Mom, I outranked them and I was the lucky one!!! I however after reading other reviews opted not to broil the chicken, but instead baked it on a cookie sheet @ 350 till the meat thermometer read 165.  FABULOUS!!

Geeze this smelled soooo delicious while cooking! I used chicken breasts and baked at 375 for 45 minutes and broiled for 5. Used the exact ingredients and wouldn't change a thing! Husband dislikes chicken but ate every bite of his!

Okay, this tasted superb. I varied on how i cooked the chicken though. I boiled the chicken thighs for a little while to removed the fat and cook. Then i seasoned with half of the ingredient mixture and broiled one side for 4 min until browned. I flipped broiled a while and poured the other half of the ingredients i sauteed and added a little power potatoes (for thickness) over the chicken. I put in a little while longer and when it was done i put on a plate and flipped it on the other side and poured the remainder of the mixture over. It came out restaurant style!

I give this 5 stars for Taste. I used white boneless chicken breasts. pounded flat and seasoned with Slay Ya mama cajun seasoning. I baked it on 375 for 45 minutes which was too long..if you do it 35 minutes it will be perfect..probably less baking time bc I flattened them for evenness...the color was also excellent.

So good I made it twice in one week!   Hands down the best chicken I've ever made.  Recipe is perfect as is, only I used bone in leg quaters & fresh chopped garlic.  I cooked it the second time without the skin (I dont care for it anyway)and this infused the meat with much more flavor.  If I decided to cook it skin on again I'd be sure to baste under and over the skin to get that wonderful flavor more into the meat.  Be sure to turn on the vent-a-hood because the butter does produce some smoke...I broiled it on the 2nd to bottom rack for 20 min turning & basting every 5.  The second time, I took LindaK's suggestion of cooking at 375 for 45 mins, turning every 15 and it produced the same result with slightly less smoke but I still preferred the broiled method.  If you like to eat the skin, broiling makes it crisper and I liked that it browned the garlic.  The whole family loved this one, even my SUPER PICKY toddler who will not eat ANYTHING...LOVED this chicken.  He ate all of his plus some of ours.  That alone made it priceless for me

Easy and really good.  Luckily I had the lower sodium soy sauce and was able to use based on other reviews.  Will definitely make again.

Super easy and delicious.  I baked mine instead of broiled and added mushrooms on top.  Yum.

I made this lastnight, AND IT WAS A HIT! though like most i did things a little differently. I used a purdue oven stuffer and split it into quarters, so I doubled up on the recipe, instead of the broiler (being the breast/wing 1/4 sat so high) I marinated the chicken in the mixture for a 1/2 an hr, then put it on a cast iron griddle/grill, grill side up and placed it in the oven turning every 5-10 mins basting with the remaining mixture for about 1 hr 20 mins (was a big bird). this is deffinately a keeper. Next time I'm going to try it on porkloin/porkchops and turkey fillets ( i like to buy whole turkeies and debone them and make fillets and nuggets). Would also make an awsome marinade for the grill. Thanks for sharing AVASEWELL!

I was so surprised at how tasty this chicken turned out. As I told my husband, it's the best tasting chicken I've ever made. I love thighs because they seem to stay so moist, and the flavors on top of that sent me to heaven!

I used the suggestion of others to use half butter & half olive oil and to bake at 350 first and then switch to broil.  Came out nice and moist and flavorful.

Yum-meeeeeeee! I printed this recipe a long time ago and never made it because it just didn't sound like enough flavor. I was so wrong! This is so good and so easy to make! My 2 year old kept shaking his head and saying "Yummy Mama, yummy!" I used boneless skinless breast halves, but I'm sure it's just as good the way the recipes calls. Definitely a family favorite!

Made the sauce exactly as written, but with lite soy sauce.  I then used the sauce over 10 thighs.  Turned out perfectly.

I had to replace the parsley with basil but otherwise followed exactly.  Chicken was a very flavorful and juicy.  I cooked it at 350 for about an hour using bone-in thighs.

This was really delicious!  I used bone-in thighs with skin and the only thing I changed is made a little more of the sauce and added some balsamic vinegar.  I cooked the chicken for about 20 minutes at 350 and then broiled until it was completely cooked.  I basted throughout broiling process.  Served with basmati rice, stuffing and a spinach salad!

Easy and absolutely delicious!  I baked 12 thighs, 20 minutes on each side, brushing every 5 minutes with the buttery mix, then placed them on a separate sheet, brushed with sauce and broiled both sides for 5 minutes each.

Yummm! I used boneless skinless thighs and realized that I was out of parsley so I subbed fresh basil and thyme. Instead of broiling I cooked on 350 for about 30 minutes and kept turning and basting. So delish! thanks! Served with a garlic broccoli recipe on this site and whole wheat macaroni. Great dinner!

I made this last night....OMG!!!! SOOOOOO GOOD!!! The sauce is to die for! I used boneless skinless chicken thighs. I didn't broil the chicken...instead I baked it at 375 for 30 minutes. And I doubled the sauce, used one for basting and the other I mixed with the pan drippings then poured over the cooked chicken before serving. This is EXCELLENT! A definite must try recipe!

flavor was amazing.  I did add 1 1/2 teaspoon of Rosemary, but need to either increase bake time or increase heat.  375 for 45 plus 5 minutes under the broiler did not get it to 160 degrees

Great recipe!  I used bone-in thighs (all I had), so I just poured the sauce over and baked at 375 for about 45 minutes.  Turned oven off, turned pieces over and returned to oven for about 20 minutes.  Will be making this again.  Thank you.

Not having minced garlic I used about 5 smashed garlic cloves. I used my Wolfgang Puck convection oven and the chicken thighs with the skin on turned out crispy, juicy, tender, and full of flavor. After preheating the oven I cooked the thighs about 40 min.

FANTASTIC AND EASY! Everyone loved it and I should have listened and made more sauce...YUMMERS. I think I'll do less butter/add someOlive oil next time. I used fresh parsley since I had some. So awesome. Also I baked at 375 for 40 min (I had thin chicken breasts) and it was awesome. YAY

Great recipe!  A few issues that I ran into: lots of smoke during the last 10 minutes of broiling.  Also, chicken turned out a bit dry.  I will try this again but will bake rather then broil.

We really enjoyed this, however I baked the chicken rather than broil it.  I've never broiled chicken and was worried as some of the reviews said it got smokey.  All in all a very good and easy recipe.  I made smashed cauliflower to go w/ it and took some of the drippings and mixed them in.  YUM!

This was very good and I changed nothing about the recipe. I used some boneless skinless thighs and breasts. Even the kids loved it and asked for seconds. I served this with the Parmesan Noodles recipe from this site and broccoli. I'll make this again.

I thought this was pretty good, and easy!  I used 10 bone-in chicken thighs and adjusted the recipe to serve 6.  I also removed the skin because I was using so much butter--enough fat already!  I cooked for 45 minutes (15 min. @ 375 then 30 min. @ 400, flipped the chicken every 15) and then browned each side for 5 min. under the broiler.  Realy economical--I think I paid $3.50 for the chicken.  Served with roasted potatoes, green salad, jello salad, and french bread.  And we have leftovers for tomorrow!

This is a very tasty sauce, and broiling cooks it just right. But I'm not a fan of chicken thighs at all. May try this again with chicken breast, but will have to grill or pan fry instead of broil.

I baked the skinless thighs & added approx. 1/4 cup of white wine to some of the reserved sauce before serving. Excellent

I made this with olive oil instead of butter, fresh parsley instead of dried and baked it at 350 for 1 hour instead of grillled.  My kids loved it and they never eat anything.  This is going to be a staple at our house from now on.

I gave this five stars because not only is this a great "base" recipe to add ingredients to and experiment with, it's also great if you don't have much time to spend cooking.    I read through a few reviews and took the recommendation to bake instead of broil, and added some balsamic vinegar into the basting sauce.  The last 30 minutes of baking time I threw in some sliced mushrooms.  All I had was low sodium soy sauce, but would use regular next time as it needed a little more salt.   I served this with brown rice and the sauce on the rice was fantastic.

I agree with the people who said its unfair to rate a recipe when you changed alot of it. Even if you use garlic powder instead of the garlic you get a different result! I didnt try the recipe as written just because I was in a hurry and only used 3 bone in, skin on thighs. Also didnt have parsley, used 21 season mix. And I think too much garlic because it burned and there was a thick black coating on top. Another thing, had only dark soy sauce so I used less. I am sure If I followed recipe exactly it would have been perfect! Thanks alot!

You can't fail with this one!  The soy sauce makes it all salty and good, and the garlic just infuses a delicious flavor into the chicken.  Great recipe to fall back on.

3.5 stars.  I used half butter, half olive oil and mabye a little more garlic.  I mixed it all up and put in a 9x13 pan with the chicken and put it in the fridge.  After a few hours I baked it in the oven.  It was moist, but not as flavorful as I had hoped.

I used boneless skinless thighs, and 1/4c butter.  It smelled great.  The flavor was good, not great.  The butter overwhelmed the chicken.  But I would try again, reducing the butter a bit more.

I made a few little changes based on some of the other reviews, and absolutely loved the flavor. We are "white meat chicken eaters" normally, but this dish makes me love chicken thighs. One thing I did was to use garlic powder, salt & pepper directly on the chicken. And because I left the skin on the thighs I used a smaller mix of butter/olive oil. I also added a bit of worstershire and a little honey with the soy sauce, and used more minced garlic in its juices (jar)than called for. I baked at 375 for about 40 minutes turning and basting every 20. Then I broiled each side for about 5 minutes.  This was so delicious! Exactly what I was looking for. And it was great for lunch two days later. Spooning the sauce over the chicken really sealed the deal for us!

This was such a simple, quick, DELICIOUS recipe for broiling chicken.  The plan was to broil 5 chicken legs (took the skin off) and pull the chicken to put into a fettuccine dish; however, after tasting the chicken (& licking my fingers... mmm), I decided to keep 2 of the legs just to enjoy for later!  The dish was a bit skimpy on the chicken side, but it sufficed, and now I have 2 delicious chicken legs to look forward to this week :) Thanks for this!!

This was very easy to make and the chicken was extremely tender.  We took other people's suggestions and baked it for 45 minutes rather than broiling it.  I'm only giving it 3 stars b/c it lacked flavor.  All I could taste was butter.  I'll make this again but add more spice and cut down the butter.  Great starter though!

Based on others reviews I cut way back on the butter and used less soy.  I also used thin sliced chicken cutlets since ppl complained about the marinade not giving the chicken much flavor. I think this really helped, my chicken was very tasty. I baked it at 375 about 10 mins. I don't like broiled garlic it tastes really bitter to me. This was fast and easy and that's always a plus after working a 10 hour shift. Nice to have an easy go to recipe that's healthy and tastes great.

very good!  cooked it at 375 for 35 minutes, then put it in the broiler for about 2.5/3 minutes on each side to brown it.  i'd definitely make it again, and probably add more garlic!  because i love garlic and didn't really taste it that much.  oh and keep an eye on the chicken in the broiler so it doesn't burn!

Really nice flavor. PITA to remove skin, fat & bones from thighs, but once done, delish. I made several changes the 2nd & 3rd times I prepared this and think adding mushrooms, onions & cheese with a proportional increase in the garlic is an improvement. I also added onion powder, powdered rosemary & ground thyme to the basting liquid / marinade while subbing EVOO for most of the butter. Be sure to serve with some rice, noodles or pasta!

So tasty, juicy, and flavorful. Husband said when he saw the chicken, "I don't like dark meat."  He couldn't get enough! Loved it! I made a few changes based on reviews. I substituted 1 TBS soy sauce with worchestishire (sp) sauce. Eyeballed the garlic, baked skin side down for 15 minutes, flipped and basted, baked another 15 (in a 450 degree oven) then broiled for a few minutes to crisp the skin. Needed to a bit longer as it wasn't as crisp as I would have liked. VERY good and will make again.

This was so good!!! I have made it a few times and it is definitely one of the most flavorful chicken recipes I've come across. I've also made it on the grill and baked it, as well as broiling it, as called for in the recipe.  Definitely a keeper & I highly reccommend trying it.

I followed to the T & it smelled great cooking but I was a little disappointed with the lack of flavor when we ate it.  It was good but I expected more flavor.  I used fresh garlic, 2 cloves, think next time will use more.  It was very moist.  It wasn't done in 20 min.  Had to throw in microwave for 5 min.

Tasty and smelled yummy while cooking. Great for when you are pushed for time. Used skinless/boneless thighs.  Would work with any cut of chicken. Would also work with just about any side dish. Since time was of the essence I served with flavoured couscous and frozen corn.

Tasty, i had to use a thighs with the bone because that is what I had on hand.  It was good but I think there is an ingredient missing and could be a five star if I can figure out what's missing.  Maybe a gravy or something.  It was good though.  I will make it again.

This was delicious! I will definitely make this again. Even my 4 year old loved it. I baked it for 20 minutes at 350 and then broiled for 10. It was beautifully golden and fell right off of the bone. I only used 2 Tbsps of Soy and substituted 1 Tbsp of Worcestershire. It was excellent!!! The best part about this recipe is I had all of the ingredients on hand and the chicken only cost $2.01. Can't beat that...

I fixed this one for my family (including my in-laws) and it was a great success!  Everyone loved it and is asking for more.  The one change I made was to substitute Olive Oil for the Butter to make it even healthier.  Delicious!

Excellent!  I used olive oil instead of butter and only used half.  I used bone in thighs, but I'll try skinless, boneless next to be able to eat more of the seasonings.  Yum!!

Excellent flavor....will bake it next time though.  The garlic tends to burn when you broil it but this was still excellent.

Four stars because the kids loved it!  My husband and I did too.  I used chicken breasts (that's what I had) and I didn't even have the dried parsley.  I'm looking forward to making it again with the herbs.

I didn't do the basting thing I just made a little extra and poured half of it on it. Then when it was time to flip I poured the other half.  It was delish.

This was a hit!  I made one small change.  My husband is a real health nut so I used half the butter and made up for the other half with olive oil.  The flavor was great and they were soooo juicy.

Yum! My family and I loved this! As one reviewer suggested, I used 2 T soy sauce + 1T balsamic vinegar, and 1/4 c butter + 1/4 c olive oil. I only needed to cook 3 boneless chicken breasts, so I mixed the leftover marinade mixture with some cream cheese and used it on cracked pepper crackers to munch on while the chicken was cooking. Yum! This is a keeper for sure! Thank you to the author for sharing!

Ver easy.  I also baked it.  A little too much garlic for me.  But good.  Family loved it and the house smelled great.  I would probably add more soy sauce next time to cut down a little on the garlic.

Very good.  Used boneless, skinless breasts because I already had it on hand.  Marinaded chicken in sauce overnight.  Everyone loved it, very quick, easy to make!

If you substitute garlic powder in this recipe just remember that this is much stronger then real garlic.  Overall, very very good and the chicken was moist.

Instead of broiling, I baked it at 375 degrees for 45 minutes, turning it every 15 minutes.  It is awesome!

I just made this tonight for dinner.  Excellent! My family doesn't like dark meat, so I used boneless, skinless, chicken breasts, as other reviews had suggested. Since the breasts were pretty thick, I pounded them until they were all the same thickness, so they'll be done at the same time. We like garlic, but I thought three tablespoons of garlic, might be too much.  I was right.  I used about a tablespoon and a half and it was plenty.  I did add more black pepper and dried parsley. Also, as others had suggested, I used half butter and half olive oil. I baked mine for 15 mins. at 375 degrees; turned it once and re-applied baisting sauce; came out perfect.  Next time, I will reduce the amount of soy sauce, though, because it was a little over-powering.  Thanks again, for fulfulling my crtieria; fast, easy, and tasty.

Really liked the sauce for this. Next time I plan to use chicken breasts instead of thighs and use less butter. I followed some suggestions from the reviews and baked for 30 minutes on 375 and then broiled the last 10 minutes.

Although I didn't have ALL of the ingredients, I used skinless breasts, the butter, garlic, soy sauce, and pepper.  Followed the recipe except I baked in the oven as some others have at 350 for about 30 minutes.  This stuff made my whole house smell SOOOOO good! (Gotta be the gahhhlic)!  I am a barbeque fanatic, but I'm thinkin' of trying more stuff in the oven now!!!  This is definitely a keeper!

This is a fantastic easy recipe that I will make again.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, 1/2'd the butter and used olive oil to make up the difference.  I covered it with foil and baked it.

this was so SIMPLE and DELICIOUS!  We used skinless chicken breasts and they were so juicy!  My kids loved it and don't waste the sauce from the pan!  It's great over some plain white rice, in case you run out of chicken like we did!

Very moist and very good. Though soy sauce was used, it did not end up too salty, as it the case when you use lots of soy sauce in a recipe. I also sauted onions to this recipe. This was delicious!

We didn't love this. It was good, but took longer than 20 mins to broil. I'm also not a big fan of the thighs. We prefer chicken breasts. Probably won't make this one again. Sorry.

FANTASTIC!  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and broiled them for 25-30 minutes but not on the top rack (whenever I use the broil top rack it always burns) and it turned out great.  I would use less butter next time.  Another reviewer suggested olive oil...I'll try that.

This was a delicious way of preparing baked chicken.  I baked it instead of broiling and just put it under the broiler for five or ten minutes.  I served it with buttered white rice mixed with peas.  Yum!

This was absolutely fabulous.   I used the exact measurements.  I did bake it for about 30 minutes and then broiled both sides.  It was moist and had a great taste.   My boyfriend loved it.  This will be made a lot I am sure.

These were a go to option when I realized I had bought bone-in thighs instead of boneless and they worked just fine.  I prepared as written, except baked for 55 minutes instead of broiled.  They turned out moist and tender with crispy skin.  Thanks for sharing

So easy and delicious!  I baked it instead of broiled it and added mushrooms prior to baking.  It came out wonderful.  Basted it the entire cooking time.  Everyone loved it - this one's a keeper.

I found this recipe trying to find ways to cook chicken thighs.  I modified it slightly to work with what I had in my pantry.  I used equal parts butter and soy sauce (used tamari sauce for gluten free) and 1/2 part of garlic powder.  The garlic powder helped to hold the butter and soy sauce together making a nice thick sauce.  I make this once a week; it was an absolute wonderful find.  Thanks for the recipe!

We loved this!!! I did bake it so, I would not have to watch it.  I also used boneless skinless thighs.

Very easy and quick!  Per another reviewer, I baked on 350 for 20 minutes and and broiled for 5 minutes and one side and just 2 minutes on the other (since the chicken was already cooked, I just wanted to color).  Before broiling, I removed the chicken from the pan and put it on a foil-lined cookie sheet so it wouldn't smoke.  Next time I'll try replacing half of the butter with olive oil.  great recipe!

I just made this dish....and it got rave reviews.  I baked it, then broiled it at the very end.  I guess it's quite fattening with all that butter :-) But my husband and kids said it was "delicious", and I loved how garlicky it was, so I am glad I found it.

So simple to prepare and execute with basic ingredients that nearly everyone has on hand. I broiled it as specified and it was done fast and browned very nicely. I used skin-on, bone-in thighs and it took roughly 20 minutes to broil.

There has never been a more succulent and tender chicken as this. We didn't even need a knife to cut it! The basting sauce was light and airy with a perfect balance. I, too, baked 375 for 50 minutes but will totally try broiling next time.

This was great (or as my 8 year old said "WICKED AWESOME!!!")  

I made the recipe as written, then added about 1 1/2 tbsp worcestershire sauce, as well as oregano & thyme.  I made 2 batches of the sauce - 1 to marinate the chicken (about 1/2 hour) and 1 to baste over the chicken during cooking on the BBQ.

Using it for basting made an extremely flavourful crust from the BBQ (be careful to keep the flare-ups under control or it will char completely) and the chicken was great.  This will definitely be a favourite at our house from now on!!!

This is a keeper!  My husband kept moaning as he ate it.  He said it was "awwwwwwsome"!  He took the first bite and said "What did you do to this"?!  I cut back on the garlic because he doesn't like garlic.  He said it was the best chicken I have ever made and I agree.

This was a great easy recipe for chicken. The amount of garlic MADE this recipe. Because I love garlic, I added a couple more tablespoons the 2nd time I made it. I don't really know what the parsley was supposed to do because I couldn't taste it. Here are some suggestions: Like a lot of other people, I bake it at 375 for about 40-45 minutes to avoid dealing with a smokey oven. Instead of using store bought minced garlic, I use fresh garlic and I grate it. Use herbes de provence in place of the parsley. I serve them with a salsa made up of diced onion, diced tomatoes and diced navel orange mixed with chopped fresh parsley and salt to taste.

This was a great recipe. My husband made sure I saved for future use lol. I used 3 chicken quarters skinned and cut in half, I sprinkled some onion powder and adobo for taste. I also used terriyaki instead of soy (didn't have any in the house). After it was cooked (baked on 375 as suggested by other reviews) I poured the the garlic and butter mixture into a pot with a small can of tomatoe sauce to make a nice gravy for the yellow rice I made with it. It was a great dish and I will definitly make it again.

in my honest opinion, this recipe is not worh trying. i feel the flavor does not soak into the chicken enough.  
Also, it called for a 1/2 cup of butter. Thats an entire stick!!! So i used a 1/2 stick and olive oil.  Did not care for this... However, the marinade/basting sauce itself was good.  I think it would be good to marinate boneless hcicken breasts in, or even steak or pork. may try that. Thanks anyway.

My husband said he was adding this to his list of stuff he really, really likes. I might agree with the low sodium soy sauce suggestions.  Flavor was great, but a bit salty. Otherwise delish!

I love chicken don't get me wrong.  Finding new ways to cook it, is a misson for me.  I came upon this recipe and was not impressed.  Tasted other recipes.  Had nothing to do with garlic. In this house garlic is used alot.  It was mediocre..really nothing special if you more of an xpert cook.  Sent this recipe to my son in college, perefct for a student.

I made this recipe for dinner the other day, I had limited time, and no idea what to make, and this recipe was perfect. My husband and I both loved it, it tasted amazing and it was so quick, we served it with carrots and rice. The only thing we would do differently is make a bit more sauce so we can have extra on our rice.

We loved it! I did change a few things, because of what I had on hand.  I used 3 tablespoons of olive oil instead of butter and 2 teaspoons of Montreal Chicken seasoning since I didn't have dried parsley.  Also, I added one onion chopped. Baked it at 450 for 30 minutes and then broiled for the last five minutes.  My family wanted more so be sure to make a lot--it goes fast! This is a keeper! Thanks AVASEWELL!

This had a good general flavor but did not have enough salt.  I didn't have soy sauce, so I used oyster sauce(which is saltier).  Very good but will salt the chicken under the skin next time I make it.

I didn't have soy sauce so I omitted that. I also used another reviewer's suggestion and set the oven to 375-F, then baked the chicken for about 45 minutes. I had a lot of chicken cooking at once, which may be why it wasn't anywhere near done by that point. It was in the oven for another half hour or so before it was cooked to our liking. The recipe itself is extremely quick and easy, which is always nice after a long day. I had some fresh limes so I squeezed one of them over the chicken about 15 minutes before it was done. It gave it a little zing - subtle but very nice. The chicken turned out juicy and delicious; the kids liked it too, which is a big plus.

Whoah - this stuff is strong. Good, but mighty strong. Next time, I'd cut the soy sauce to 2 T. or less. I used olive oil and cut it to 1/3 cup - no more is needed. Otherwise,  this is simple and tasty.

A nice, quick way to use split chicken breasts w/simple ingrdients you usually have on hand.  Pretty salty, so I'll try w/low sodium soy sauce next time and a dash of worchester sauce as suggested by others.

Overall this recipe was very good and the chicken was very tasty. I made some changes: Added some sugar when I melted the butter to balance the flavors. I also browned the chicken thighs first then placed it in the oven for about 15 mins at 350 degrees. Then I broiled it for 5 mins. When I was basting the chicken every 5 mins I added some honey into the sauce and it tasted great! But becareful the chicken may brown/burn quickly! One more thing, I used bone-in chicken thighs so boneless might require less cooking time.

I scaled it down to two servings and used four chicken legs. After thirty minutes in the broiler, they were done perfectly. (I turned them once halfway through.) My husband and I thought that they tasted great.

I love this recipe!  It's so easy, and so flavorful.  I love boneless thighs for grilling in the summer, and had yet to find a good recipe to use in the colder months, until I found this one.  It has become a staple in our house.  Excellent, thank you!!

We loved it!  Since finding this recipe, I've made it twice and both times we've not had leftovers.  I passed this on to my cousin and even she liked it(she's not a big cooker and likes fairly simple meals)!  Will be added to our regular meals list!

I made this but combined it with another recipe. I topped it with vidalia onions cooked in brown sugar and monterey jack cheese. It was really good!!! I also grilled the chicken instead of broiling it.

The taste of this recipe was really good, but unless my broiler is MUCH hotter than normal, the cooking time is impossible to achieve without filling the house with smoke.  I ended up broiling for 10 minutes, then moving to the oven for about 10-15 minutes more.  Maybe next time I will pound the chicken first or something.  I will try again with less smoke...lol.

Ok, I did not have a broiling pan, all of mine were apparently not broil friendly, but i cooked it on 350, and it took a very long time.  Overall the taste was ok, but once I find a broiling pan, I will try it again, because the taste was good, just not great, and im sure it was because of having to cook it versus broiling it.

Okay, I am updating my previous 4 star review and giving this 5 stars with the following tweaks:  Dale's instead of soy sauce and using bone in, skinless chicken thighs in a glass pie plate, baking for about 45 minutes.  I also used a cast iron butter melting pot to mix the ingredients (used nearly a head of garlic too) - microwaves alter the properties of even water, I avoid them if at all possible.  

I turned the thighs once during cooking making sure to spoon some of the garlic chunks on top.  This was absolutely DELICIOUS!  Served with rice-a-roni chicken flavored rice (yeah, took the easy way out but I did ad slivered almonds) and spooned some of the to die for sauce over that - wow!  Unbelievable~!  Went from flavorless on the grill to can't beat it in the oven.  Do try it!

DH and I felt there was too much garlic for this chicken.  I started it under the boiler and the garlic began burning, so I turned the oven to 375 and cooked it that way.  It browned up nicely, just too garlicky for us.

This was a great find!  Probably some of the best baked chicken I've ever had.  The garlic does makes the house smell like an Italian kitchen, and the flavors were outstanding.  I also added balsamic vinegar, a little less butter, and it was a great addition.  I had leftover chicken and sauce--I skimmed off the chilled butter and the chicken was even better the next day!   A REALLY great recipe!

This is a great recipe.  Very easy to use, as well.  I substituted rosemary for the parsley and used skinless chicken thighs.  I also used the light butter by Land O' Lakes.  I didn't use all of the butter/soy sauce mixture, so I'll probably only use 1/4 cup of butter next time or maybe combine the butter with a little olive oil.  Very good, and very quick.  Perfect for a weekday night, yet can easily be dressed up for a more special occasion!  Thanks!

This is the best chicken I have ever made! I used skinless and bonesless thighs because I hate skin and added about 4 more tablespoons of soy sauce to the recipe and more parsley but did everything else the same. This is a definite keeper and can't wait to make it again over rice.

unless i didn't broil them long enough (though they were cooked through and the juices were clear) the consistency of the thighs was a little icky.  i'd like to try it on breasts or on thighs that are baked.  my husband, however, didn't like it, chicken meat or marinate taste.  my 5 year old daughter asked if i would make it EVERY night!

Recipe was excellent. My family loved it. I made it with items already in my kitchen. I broiled chicken pieces (breasts & wings) on low setting for about 30-35 each side and continued to baste throughout to ensure it didn't dry out. Great recipe for a quick, healthy and delicious meal.

I did enjoy this recipe and will continue to make it, however I feel it needs a little tweaking.  I used a split whole chicken and so it took about 50 minutes to cook the breasts.  Did everybody else broil on high or low?  Next time I will inject the breasts with the same marinade as well baste the chicken in it.

The flavor was great, but I would cut down on the Garlic (even though I love garlic) and soy sauce.  Even for a salt lover I thought it was a bit salty.  I would have given this three stars, but the fact that this was incredibly easy an took absolutly no time, as well as used ingredients that every kitchen should have anyways...it definitely earned the four.  Oh, and I also used skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs.  Tasty and a definite repeat.

We enjoyed this chicken recipe - very easy and with ingredients i always have on hand. We did find it a bit salty - would maybe cut the soy with water next time.

This was the perfect soultion to leftover chicken strips.  I used a little extra garlic and couldn't have been happier.  I'll be making this one from now on... thank you sooo much.

Came out good!  In a pinch didn’t have enough butter so used 1/4 cup of olive oil instead of butter.   Broiled in high.  Used boneless skinless chicken thighs.  Came out good.  I’m sure taste even better with skin

Excellent taste for a super-very easy recipe that yields a great result. 
Note of advice: prior to broiling, I soaked the thighs in the marinade, placed them in a Pyrex dish, then scooped up the balance of the marinade  and placed on the thighs. Served with  asparagus and potatoes that I boiled, coated with olive oil and pan seared.  Good stuff...

This was super easy and really delicious. I didn't have chicken thighs so I used 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I cut them into strips, poured the sauce over top and broiled them for 20 minutes. The whole family ate it up.

I love this recipe, but I added a sprinkling of Maple Smokehouse seasoning to each piece before putting it in the oven, and that added a delightful added flavor to the dish.

Very simple, quick, and easy. I broiled two pounds (about four thighs) in a cast iron skillet for 20 minutes. Made as written, except used 2 T soy sauce & 1T Worcestershire sauce. Made a lovely gravy from the pan scrapings. Served with mashed potatoes & mixed veg. Lovely & enjoyed by all. Will make again!

I dont think that 20 minutes in the broiler is adaquate time for cooking the thighs all the way through. I cooled them for 20 minutes and they were still a little undercooked. I would say 20 -35 minutes. 20 minutes for smaller thighs and then 30-35 minutes for thicker thighs. Flavor was off the charts fantastic. Definitely gonna do this one again :D

Perhaps this recipe could benefit from marinating? It just didn't do it for me. One person pointed out how much butter was being utilized, but honestly it was all left in the pan. Skin was phenomenal, but the actual meat lacked taste.

Very tasty!!!   Used boneless / skinless chicken breasts (just don't care for thighs).  Followed recipe directions with the following minor modifications based on reviews: Used only 1/4 lb of butter (which was more than enough);  added 1 tsp of brown sugar (will add a bit more next time), and reduced parsley to 1 heaping tsp (not my favorite).  Made sauce in a saucepan on the stove -  which IMHO is just as easy as the microwave.  Aroma was fabulous and the chicken browned beautifully.  I meant to broil 10 minutes on each side, but forgot to start the timer so estimated the first 10 minutes. The chicken was good but could have been more moist.  I'll be more careful next time!!  Can't wait to make it again.  I may try this wonderful sauce on salmon too.  Thanks so much for  the recipe and, as always, to all the reviewers.

Very delicious. The flavors were very well appointed. I will make this again. I did bake covered on 400 for 15 minutes before uncovering and broiling until internal temp read 165.

WOW! Easy and delicious recipe. I had only 4 small thighs to cook with and I used low sodium soy sauce. Following many reviewers advice, I cooked the chicken thighs in half the sauce at 375 for 30 minutes (turning over after 15 minutes), then broiled on high for 5 minutes on each side. While the thighs were broiling, I poured the rest of the sauce. There was plenty of sauce to smother the chicken with and pour over white rice. Yum! I loved the sauce so much, I'm thinking of cooking potatoes in the sauce next time for a tasty side dish...

I baked my  six skinless, bone in thighs 375 for about 40 min. in all of the sauce and basted once while cooking. I halved the sauce recipe for six thighs and used reduced sodium soy sauce. Good and plenty of sauce to serve over chicken and rice. I would make this again.

This is easy and delicious.  I like to broil boneless chicken, it sometimes becomes too dry.  This recipe keeps the chicken juicy.

I don't like Broiled Chicken. It always comes out dry- but not with this. Please note, i used 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, low sodium soy sauce, Kerry Gold Butter, and i cut back on the garlic by maybe  1/3.  I turned, basted the chicken every 10 minutes. Ended up cooking it 30 total because I wasn't using thighs. It was amazing. The sauce flavor was so simple and tasty, and the chicken was moist and delicious.  My 5 year old is in a picky eating stage and she wont touch anything that has sauce. She cleaned her plate. I can't speak to using it with thighs and skin, but the boneless chicken was truly delicious. Served with yellow rice and steamed mixed veggies. Highly Recommend.

I am a type 2 diabetic and have to watch my carbs. I made this chicken with the ingredients has indicated but baked in my air fryer at 375 and turned out awesome. The only thing would recommend is some kind of sauce with more flavor, if others be sharing the meal as well who are not on a special diet.

I made this a written the 1st time. the 2nd time  I used thyme I used liquid aminos for the soy sauce plus add 1 Tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce 2 Tablespoons of balsamic vinegar 1/2 teaspoon sugar 1/2 onion chopped small as the garlic and 4 Tablespoons of water. I still used the same amounts as the original recipe I also marinated it for 2 hours but you can do longer in the liquid aminos balsamic vinegar and Worcestershire sauce and 4 Tablespoon of water to cut the salt. I put the water in both  the sauce and the marinade. I used the sauce also as a sauce for vegetables or added to brown gravy you can also use over noodles, noodles or cauliflower rice or even rice. will make this again. you can change the flavors with many different spices.

I did it Audra’s way. I didn’t cut the butter, I added more chicken. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and the sauce accentuated the flavor of the potatoes! I’m making this one, again!

This was delicious! The only thing I did different than the recipe is to use skinless thighs because I had them already. I followed the directions exactly and they turned out perfect. The thighs were tender and juicy even without the skin. One thing I might do differently is use less garlic or use a garlic paste that will dissolve in the baste more easily. Three Tbsp of minced garlic seems excessive not because it was overpowering but there was just a lot left in the bowl I mixed the baste in.  I will definitely keep this recipe handy and use it again.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was so easy to make & my family said it was delicious. The only thing I will do differently next time is put a little seasoning on the chicken prior to placing it in the oven.

This was extremely easy and very tasty.  I didn’t have enough soy sauce.  Can’t wait to try this again with the proper amount of soy sauce.  This was still quite good with half the soy sauce

Made this tonight adding about a tablespoon of honey (to cut the saltiness of the soy sauce) and roughly a teaspoon of ground ginger.  Then baked at 375 for 45 minutes turning every 15 minutes as suggested by another reviewer.  Served it with red rice cooked with sesame oil and ground ginger and broccoli. Amazing!  This recipe is a keeper.

Easy to make, tastes great and uses ingredients I have on hand. I prepared according to the recipe, except that I baked at 375 for about 55 minutes, turning twice and basting after second turn. Tastes great and flavor goes into the meat, without marinating time.

I didn't have parsley, so omitted that  and used skinless thighs.   This chicken cooked great, it was a little crispy on top, and soy sauce was a good flavor but not too overpowering.

My family was fighting over the leftovers.  I made sure to get the liquid under the skin.  I used 8 chicken breasts (and could have done 10). I did cook it a few minutes longer, and it was fine.

Loved how easy this recipe was. We took the advice of some reviews and baked at 375 for 45 min. I would suggest to broil for the last few minutes to crisp up the skin. Thanks for the great recipe!

So, my wife was called to work suddenly for an emergency and left without telling me what she had planned for the chicken thighs that where defrosting. To further complicate matters our oven's baking function wasn't working.
I found this and thought, "let's give this a try."

I followed this as written and the chicken was superb. But, after the chicken was cooked, I removed the chicken to a serving platter. Looking at the drippings, I decided this was too good to pass up. I quartered a plantain, placed it in the baking dish covering it well with the drippings and returned it to the broiler, turning it once. Delicious! You can easily add vegetables to this recipe.

This was so good! My whole family loved it. I accidentally bought skinLESS thighs, but it still came out great. I doubled the sauce because recipes never seem to have enough sauce and I made mashed potatoes, which it tasted really good over.  I even had a bit of sauce left over, which I saved to put on steak or something similar.  This was also REALLY easy to make.

Soooo yummy!  My whole family loves it! I don’t baste them the way it says. I just pour it over the chicken and stick it in the broiler for the amount of time it calls for. Perfect!!

Super yummy, served over rice. Made just as recipe suggested except I didn't have dried oregano, so I used fresh. Faboo!

I baked 10 bone-in chicken thighs with skin in a glass 13x9 dish, and doubled the recipe. I used low-salt soy sauce and pre-minced garlic. I used freeze-dried chives along with a sprinkle of dried parsley flakes and the chives added a wonderful flavor to the dish. I baked at 350 for 45-minutes and broiled for an additional 15-minutes. The skin didn't turn out crispy like I had hoped, but the chicken was very tasty. I served with mashed potatoes, fresh green beans, and a spring mix salad with balsamic dressing. I had no leftovers, with three teenaged eating machines in the house, haha.

Everyone loved this for family dinner night.  Such a simple recipe!  Only had bone in chicken thighs, so cooked it for 45 minutes before broiling for 5 minutes.  Will make again & again!

Delicious and easy. I followed the recipe as written with one exception. the split chicken breast I had were very large so I baked them at 375 until the internal temp was 165 and then broiled until the skin was crispy, about 5 min. Will definitely be making this again.

Great! My husband is not usually a fan of thighs and he loved these! Simple, few ingredients, will do again. Used cilantro rather than parsley as that’s what I had in my garden.

Very good and very easy.  I used boneless chicken breasts and followed the recipe as written.  I broiled it on low (took 25 minutes) until the internal temperature was 170 degrees.  It was very flavorful and juicy.  Next time I think I should turn the breasts half way through.

Like what the other viewers, I've skipped the broiler and baked it, since I'm new to broiling meats. I also paired it with mashed potatoes as well. It was delicious--and will try to broiling it in the future. I've cut my chicken breast in half and have plenty fr leftovers for another meals.

This came out perfect, loved by all.  I followed the recipe ingredients as posted.  It was too cold to grill, so I baked in oven at 375 degrees for 17 min, skin side up.  I flipped over for 15 min.  I didn't turn over, basted & broiled for 5 min.  Turned over so skin side up, basted & broiled for 5 minutes.  Big hit. Enjoy!

SO good!!! This is so easy to make, and I used 2 boneless skinless breasts and 4 drumsticks (with skin).  I baked it at 400 degrees (because I was also baking something else at the same time) for 20 minutes and broiled on high for about 10 minutes.  My husband and son think this is one of the best marinades ever.

Thanks for the recipe ... The only thing I had to change was the chicken - used boneless,skinless thighs because that's all I had. I also followed one recommendation to bake first then transfer to a flat pan then roast for about 5-8 mins. The chicken had a little bit of a crunch after... Yum!!!

So delicious!  Im new to cooking as well as a single mom to a toddler and this recipe was easy for me to accomplish. After reading a couple reviews I ended up baking the thighs for 45 mins and broiling for 5 mins a side. The broiling definitely made a difference. after I was finished I read some more of the reviews and I would definitely do half the butter and maybe try the balsamic vinegar instead of the soy sauce as well as adding mushrooms. all in all great recipe.

The only thing different was I added a tablespoon of garlic powder. I baked mine in oven and finished it off under broiler for 10 to 15 minutes. Easy recipe and would do it this way again.

Awesome recipe, used Wings and added Baby Creamer Potatoes based off of other reviews! Also baked for 45 minutes and broiled 5 minutes each side. Great mid week meal with rice, "Ooops, two starches in one sitting :)" Absolutely a great meal!

Followed multiple reviewers advice by baking at 375 first then broiling 5 mins on each side on a flat baking dish with juices slightly embellishing the top. It still smoked :/  Extremely juicy and tasty!

Kids liked this dish.  I used bone-in thighs so I baked it about 20 minutes before broiling to make sure it cooked through.  Used 8 thighs and there was plenty of sauce.  Delicious but I will probably try less butter next time to cut down on the fat and see if it takes just as good.

Wow! after reading reviews I knew I had to make. Reading reviews always help....I too also decided to bake and added cubed potatoes to the chicken in same backing pan with marinade on them OH MY MARINADE made everything WONDERFUL!!!! Think next time will also zucchini and probably butternut squash. Be sure to have extra marinade.

This is fantastic, I prefer to bake it over broiling. It's my wife's favorite meal. Serving it over some jasmine rice and there's nothing resembling leftovers. I tried it in a sauce pan once, it was good, just not as good as in the oven.

This is a wonderful dish! I baked it in the oven rather than broil it. Definitely a family favorite!

Oh wow.  Butter, garlic and boneless chicken.  This was so good.  Of course I used kerrygold butter.  I served it with broccoli and rice.  Even the kids loved it.

I've made this once and my family loved it.  I even added some mushrooms in that were delicious!  Now, I'm going to try the same recipe with some butterflied center cut pork chops.  I think the flavors will transfer perfectly!

Great simple recipe! Meat was juicy and flavorful, I baked at 375 degrees for 45 minutes flipping the chicken a couple of times during that and it came out awesome. Keeping in my dinner rotation for sure

Oh my gosh this was so simple and delicious!!! My picky 10 year old daughter didn’t touch anything else on her plate until after she ate the chicken at dinner and then I caught her trying to eat leftover chicken at breakfast the next morning!!! I will be making this again and again. Simple, inexpensive and absolutely delicious recipe!!!

Very quick, easy and tasty. It lacked a "wow" factor but was tender and juicy; I think I should've served it with a livelier side than roasted broccoli. Like some others here I baked it at 375 for 45 minutes (my broiler setting is temperamental) and this was just right. My partner and I thought it might be great with some stir-fried veggies and rice or pasta, so we'll be trying that next time.

My family loves this recipe. Not only does the food taste great, but it makes the whole house smell wonderful while you're cooking it. Don't skimp on the sauce - when I make it, I often double it so we have plenty to go around.

This is my daughter's favorite dish.  I did not change anything in this recipe, the only thing I did is broiled it longer than the 20 minutes, and it came out perfect.  I Love It.  Tasted Delicious.

I followed the recipe without changes. The chicken unfortunately was undercooked in the middle. I turned it twice but should've turned it more- the top was charred black. But now I know, and think it'll be better next time now that I know what I'm doing.

This recipe is easy, flavorful, and a family favorite. I only made two minor adjustments. First, because of personal preference, I cut down on the parsley and only used about 2 teaspoons. Also, I found that 20 minutes was not sufficient time to fully cook the chicken things and had to leave them in 5-10 minutes longer. Of course, this could just be my oven or the chicken itself. Overall, I highly recommend this recipe.

We really loved this.  I would have given it 5 stars if it were healthier but then again it might not have been so yummy.  I also think it might be better with fresh parsley. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs but I think I will use breasts next time.

This is the first time I tried this recipe and I loved it! I didn't have any soy sauce so I just added salt. I baked it for 45 minutes instead of broiling it and I added some slices of lemon to make it even tastier Thanks for the recipe

I used leg and thigh quarters with the bone in and cooked it a little longer.  It was really good.  I will make it again.  I served it with Uncle Bens long grain and wild rice. Great dinner.

I did bake it in oven as suggested by another. Broiling does not always work the best. It was well liked by 2 of my sons, a girlfriend and best of all 2 grand kids, who are fussy, ages 9 and 6. Will definitely make again.!

This was ok. Very easy, but I had to add garlic salt and  probably will add rosemary if I make it again. I baked it for 20 min then turned and baked for 20 m.in

This was quick and easy and requires ingredients you'll likely have in the house.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and they melted in our mouths.  This recipe will definitely go in the "do over" pile.

My 13 year-old gobbled this up AND complimented me. So I’ll be making this again. I didn’t change anything in the ingredients or the cooking method, and it turned out great. Very easy and tasty.

This recipe is so easy and so good. I used the same recipe but I used lemon instead of so much butter , for a nice piece of salmon. I just used a little bit of butter. I just broiled the salmon it was excellent.

All the reviewers will boo me for just saying I haven't made this yet, and was just reading all the reviews or inspiration. I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed FXBIL's review! I have been cooking for years, and still a klutz - so it was so amusing to hear from a cook who looks at the stove with wonder and hope! Thank you.

Excellent. What a time saver.  I liked the recipe. The second time I just tossed the chicken in oil and vinegar dressing and that was very good. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good!  I followed the recipe pretty closely, next time will broil a little bit longer as it seemed it could have been a little more done, but was still very good.   Easy, tasty  and good!

Mmm, this chicken was finger licking good !
I had to make few changes though. I have very sensitive smoke alarms. broiling, skin on chicken would have set them off big time.. So, as another reviewer did, I baked the chicken pieces, drumsticks in this case, for 45 minutes at 375 and broiled for 5 minutes on each side at the end, but keeping the pan on the middle oven rack.
Also cut the butter in half, I just didn't see why that much of it is necessary.

This is a great recipe! The chicken thighs were flavorful and the broiler cooked them to perfection. I'm happy to have a recipe for chicken thighs since I normally sautee chicken. I ended up using teriyaki sauce because I was out of soy, but everything else was done exactly as mentioned in the recipe. This was quick and simple AND it tastes like it was straight out of a restaurant!

I used chicken breasts, mixed the sauce together as directed but added the chicken and let it marinate for 30 minutes.  Grilled the chicken, it came out  moist,  easy, and delicious.

Easy and delicious.   But if you can use a fork to poke into the chicken a bit so the sauce can get in,  I believe the taste could be even better.

I didn't broil this chicken I baked it and then I broiled it just to crisp it up. I was afraid to smoke up the kitchen. Although the chicken was good, it wasn't out of the ordinary.

Instead of putting the chicken under the broiler.  I cooked the thighs on the grill in order to keep the temp down in the house due to the extreme hot weather.  I omitted the parsley.  Will include it next time.  A quick go to recipe!

Delicious!  I was influenced by the picture aand used drumsticks.  It was SOooooo good.  For my family it worked very well.  I added more garlic which made it a little stickier, which was good.  I also left the skin on.  Yummy!

I made this today, no I made no changes to it besides serving size, to my surprise it is actually not that bad, I will make it again.
 The only thing I do not agree with is putting your rack close to the broiler of your stove, I burnt my pain, smoke everything

We really loved this!  It's perfect for a week night.  Good flavor, easy to make and doesn't take a long time.  I baked it instead of broiling it because I didn't want the house all smokey.  I think it would be great on the grill too.

I used in mixture of chicken thighs and chicken breasts for this recipe. Also I took advice and baked it at 375 for about 35 minutes. Then I put it under the broiler for about five minutes to get a crispy on both sides.  The change of ingredients is that I used half low-sodium soy sauce & half  regular soy sauce, so it wouldn't be quite as salty. It turned out perfect

Delish!  Best flavor ever...i used a jar of terriaki sauce instead of plain soy sauce.  Cooked longer on a lower temp and walla! Use plenty of garlic and parsley.  I also used olive oil and let it all marinade overnight. While basting the chicken i added salt pepper and a few dashes of hot sauce. The flavor was incredible! Pound the breasts if thick. Good luck

RESTAURANT AMAZING. I used Teryaki Marinade and Sauce since I was out of soy sauce and WHOA it was so succulent. I flipped the thighs once at 10 minutes and it gave the chicken a nice crispy outside on both sides. So garlicky-good.

Why has NO ONE tried GRILLING this??? It sounded SO good and grilling vs. broiling are so close. Plus... I just bought a new "Tru-Infrared" grill, so I just HAD to try it! It worked like a champ! I did change a few things, to adapt it though. No butter! It would burn like crazy. I used EVOO and subbed fresh basil (our plant is going nuts) for parsley. Soaked 4 thighs for about an hour. Grilled 'em for about 20 minutes. Even though the skin burnt a bit, early on, they were still AMAZING!!! DW said, "We've gotta do these again!" I'm still learning this new grill.

How can you go wrong with garlic and butter? I used boneless skinless tenders, since we don't eat skin or thighs. I also added rosemary (about 3-4 tbs. fresh). And used low sodium soy sauce, which was plenty salty. Delish! Our oven maybe runs hot, or because they were not thighs, 20 minutes was a bit too long. We ate this with rice pilaf. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I used chicken breast tenders and lemon herb spice instead of parsley. The tenders cooked faster. It only took 10 minutes in the oven broiler and I turned them over after 5 minutes.

Made as advertised.  Used about 2# of chicken drummets - tossed half in bottled wing sauce after broiling  to do a comparison.  Wonderful both ways.  As others have done, I baked for 30 minutes and finished them under the broiler, about 5 minutes each side.  I put the garlic through a garlic press which is quicker than mincing.   What's especially great about this recipe is it's easy to prepare with minimum mess (using a foil-lined baking sheet cuts down the mess even more).  I think I have a new buffalo wing recipe.

I used low sodium soy, 1/4 cup of butter, fresh pressed garlic and fresh parsley.  Baked it at 400 for 25 mins (bone in chicken pieces) and then broiled it in the toaster oven for a couple mins on each side to prevent the smoking. I saved some of the marinade for serving.  It was a hit--served with snow peas and brown basmati rice.

This is one of my husband's favorites, and a simple, go-to dish good for any time. I've made this countless times with all different chicken pieces. I've even used a whole chicken and roasted it. The only change I've made is to bake at about 375 for about 40 mins.

Very quick and easy to make. Great for a busy night!

I've made this twice. Broiling is great when you're in a hurry but I find that it's too easy to burn the chicken and you also have to worry about smoke. So like other reviewers said, I prefer to bake at 375 for about 35-40 minutes and then broil for a few minutes to get the chicken more crispy. I also add a bit a cayenne pepper flakes or some hot sauce to the mix.

We really did not like this too much. I feel like it has the potential to be good, if adjusted for ones taste. If I ever make it again I'd probably pass on the soy sauce entirely and may even cut back on some of the garlic (and I LOVE garlic). It was just was to strong and salty and overpowered the chicken, and that's even with putting vegetables in with it.

Easy and Quick
Did 2 Tablespoons of low sodium soy sauce and 2 Tablespoons of Worcestershire.
Also, I brine my chicken in a salt mixture to keep it moist.  Baked @ 375 for 35 mins, flipping and basting every 10-12 mins. Moved to baking sheet and Broiled for 5 mind each side, basting it each time I flipped it.
Approved by my picky 6 y/o with 2 th.umbs up!!!

I left out the black pepper, but the chicken thighs were easy to prepare and worked well under the broiler. Very good. My picky husband wants me to make this again.

I used less butter and baked it for 45-50 minutes instead of broiling. I also added a bit of hot pepper sauce to the butter, soya sauce and garlic.  It went down well.

Wow! I can't believe how simple and delicious this recipe is. I bagged the chicken and ingredients to mix/marinate for half an hour. The seasoned butter partially solidified which was great to sprinkle on top of the chicken when I transferred to the baking dish. I didn't have a broiler pan, so I baked 30 min each side at 350 in a 9x13 pan. This is the tastiest chicken we have ever made by far.

My husband said this was the best chicken he had ever had. 
 I mixed butter, garlic, soy sauce, black pepper and parsley right in my baking dish, microwaved that for 2 minutes, added my chicken thighs coating both sides; covered with foil, and baked, skin side up, in a preheated 450 degree oven for 25 minutes, turned thighs, recovered, baked 15 minutes longer, uncovered, turned skin side back up and broiled 5 more minutes.

It was ok. Very simple, I'd do it for a quick weekday meal, but it's very plain. It was great making it in a batch, the refrigerating the leftovers and using them throughout the week. the taste was so light that the chicken worked with everything: salad, alfredo, taco, etc...  The butter soy sauce mixture is divine, I'm going to add it to everything.

Tasted good but like others I didn't want to hang around the kitchen keeping an eye on broiling so I baked "bone in" thighs (couldn't find boneless) @ 375 for 50 minutes.  Used 2 tablespoons less sodium Soy Sauce & 1 Tablespoon regular.  1/4 cup butter was plenty, I lined a baking pan with aluminum foil & it was loaded with butter when the chicken was done.  Also lifted the skin & tucked some of the seasoned butter in.  Will keep this recipe.

Per other reviews, used 1/2 the butter and the rest as directed with boneless skinless chicken thighs. Still too buttery but good overall--will keep experimenting with it. Thanks to OP and other reviewers.

This is perfect weeknight meal for my family, and ALL five of us loved it! Because I was roasting veggies at the same time I decided to bake this at 375 for as long as my veggies took and they both came out great! This is going into the rotation!

Baked at 375 instead of broiling as others suggested but this recipe turned out really greasy. I'll make it again but cut down on the butter.

This was very easy to make and very tasteful.  I did use a combo of 1/4 butter and  1/4 olive oil as suggested by another.  Both my son and daughter really liked.  I was very surprised that my daughter liked it because she is so picky.  I got a thumbs up from her so I will be making again.

Couldn't have been easier! I followed the recipe, using boneless, skinless thighs, even stuck in a random chicken breast I had ready to cook. Everything cooked beautifully together. I broiled on high, center rack for 30 minutes, basting and turning once in between. Everyone loved it!

Tender, tasty, and really looks lovely on the plate (I will try to post a picture next time!). I reduced the garlic by about 1/2 tbsp due to family preferences, but next time I will likely make it with the full 3 tbsp.  Based on past experience I baked the thighs at 450F for 45 minutes, turning and basting every 15 minutes, and they came out perfectly.  This recipe is a keeper!

I've made this several times. My family prefers it when I use chicken breast, but I often use skinless and boneless thighs, spending a little time trimming off the fatty and chewy parts. I love that you can just bake this immediately, and don't have to wait for it to marinate. Great recipe!!! Family favorite and so easy...!!! I have also made it using 1/2 the butter, and it still turns out delicious. Thank you for this recipe!!

i broiled it for about 50 minutes and it came out very delicious.  The chicken came out juicy and moist and the sauce really made the chicken soft.

Very good. I put 2  packages frozen broccoli with pads of butter on top in a dish on the bottom rack to cook alongside the chicken. I poured the extra juices from the chicken over the cooked broccoli and added shredded cheddar cheese. We ate them together with crusty French bread.

I love garlic and this recipe is perfect for me. Very simple and also delicious. I made an additional gravy with the same ingredients to pour all over the chicken to make it juicy and more flavor. Thank you so much to share this recipe!!

This was very good. I baked it for about 40 min then did the broil for 5 min on each side. I basted every 10 min and would turn. The leftovers tasted even better the next day!!

I grew up a vegetarian, and so I generally don't eat large portions of meat. But this... this was fantastic. Very flavorful, not dry at all, simple and fast.  My whole family loved it and scarfed it all up. We didn't have leftovers.

I actually had to broil for longer Bec it was still pink inside chicken. I broiled it total 30 min and I poked a hole in each one about 15 min in.     Broiling it give is that amazing crunch and.  U can def use less butter.  The fat from chicken will melt so easily so much liquid to baste with.     Overall if u broil longer and let crip a litter. It's delicious over rice use left over juice to season the rice.

Made it with boneless skinless thighs and it was delish!  Chicken was very juicy! I did not broil it either...I baked it for about 35 min at 350.  About 10 min before I took it out of the oven, I basted the chicken with the juices from the dish.  Definitely a keeper in my house!

AMAZING.  This was so delicious and fairly simple to make.  I did cut the butter in 1/2 and used 1/4 cup olive oil for the substitution.  I served this over brown rice (Oven baked from this site) and ladled more of the juices over the chicken and rice.  It was divine.  I will definitely be adding this to our regular rotations of meals!

This was "ok" not enough flavor for me and at 1/4 cup of butter was plenty.  It is not a keeper for me.

I followed the instruction exactly and a lot of smoke filled the room, causing the fire alarm, then the oven caught fire (found early so no damage)

I think the problem here is 1) 20 min is too long for broiling 2) Too much butter. 

I will try again by using less butter or olive oil, and bake at around 370 degree to see what is going to happen.

Followed the recipe exactly and the family loved it.

Keep a close watch during broiling... 20 minutes in my oven left the chicken a little dry.

This is a great recipe, so far is my favorite in this app! My boyfriend loved it. My mom says she liked the flavor. I did however, baked it at 375F for about 30-40min i believe, then hi-broiled it towards the end for about 8min. I also added canned mushrooms! And added abit of rosemary and chili powder. Turned out so great! Very tender and flavorful. I love how the garlic really came through. Thank you so much

I used boneless, skinless thighs and the minced garlic from the jar. Just like the recipe said, 20 minutes, and I flipped them twice so they started smooth side up and ended the same. Last flip was for about 4 minutes to brown them up again. Came out a little salty, next time I might use 2 tablespoons of soy sauce or maybe the low sodium. Great roasted garlic flavor. Ill definitely do this again.

Couldn't believe how easy it was and didn't think that combination of ingredients would be that delicious, made it with boneless skinless thighs and can't wait to make it again.

Came out delicious! I didn't broil it but simply cooked it for about 45 min basting and turning every 15 minutes for maximum flavor. Covered in foil and then uncovered for like the last 10-15 min.

Good flavor. I accidentally burnt the top so I will put less mixture on top and ensure next time the rack is further away from the broiler. I also used bone-in chicken thighs and cooked for an extra 15 minutes.

I love this so much! There was one month where I ate this every day and still craved it. Instead of minced garlic, I put a minced garlic, chili and ginger mix.

Love this recipe! I did follow one reviewer's suggestion by using 1/4 cup of butter with 1/4 cup of olive oil. Let the chicken bake for 25-35 mins turning occasionally and it came out soooo yummy!

I used less garlic (3 tbsp seemed like a lot, so I only used 1). I was really surprised at how flavorful and easy this was. I will definitely be making it again!

Added a bit more garlic because me & hubby love garlic and didn't have the parsley but it wasn't missed. Used 4 skin-on thighs and baked in oven @ 350 degrees for about 45 minutes then did final basting. Cooked for another 15 minutes to really crisp up. My dear hubby just kept moaning in cuisine pleasure...every single bite! Matched this with "Moroccan-Style Stuffed Acorn Squash" by TRUCKERDOO for a wonderful meal and lunches for the next day. SUPERB!

Very good!  I used half butter/half olive oil, replaced one tablespoon of the soy sauce with Japanese black vinegar (didn't have balsamic), made 4 bone-in thighs and 2 boneless breasts.  I baked as others said - approx. 40 - 45 min. at 375 (turning and basting), then broiled for about 5 minutes.  Both S. & A. really liked and had seconds!

Very easy and pretty fast, a definite keeper!    The only things I tweaked were the chicken - I only had breasts - and  the cooking - I had to split the breasts lengthwise, so I used the broiler on high but put the pan in the middle of the oven so they wouldn't burn.  I served it over white rice.    My kids raved and would have licked the plates if they could have gotten away with it.

I chose this recipe based on a rating by ALyt, because she said it was "quick and simple" and her 11 and 14 year old loved it." She  was spot on!! I followed the recipe just as it was written, even had Land O Lakes in my refrigerator.  It was quick, easy and a great recipe, my 12 year old granddaughter not only loved it, she asked for seconds.

This tasted great. I really like it and it was easy! I changed it slightly as I used 8 chicken thighs. and used a little less butter about 3/4 of a stick of butter. I put all the sauce on the chicken from the beginning and didn't reserve any, I lifted the skin off the top of each piece of chicken  and put some sauce under the skin too. I cooked it uncovered on low broil for 20 minutes and then I cooked it at 425 degrees for another 20-30 minutes. I basted the chicken at least every 10 minutes with the sauce that was already in the dish. Came out really great!

I thought this was moist, but bland.  It needs salt and the soy sauce didn't suffice.  Next time I will add season salt also.  I used olive oil instead of butter.  I roasted red potatoes with it. I also took the advice of another posting and baked it on 375* for 45min.  Basting and turning the pieces 1/2 way through.  I broiled them for 5 minutes at the end.

This was great. The whole family enjoyed it, including my very picky son.  Simply and delicious. Thank you for the recipe. 
I did make some changes only because I didn't have the time to be near the broiler, so I baked the thighs at 375 for about 45 minutes covered with foil and then did a quick broil uncovered before serving.   The thighs were so moist and tender! There was a lot of the sauce left over so I thickened it up a bit with cornstarch. It was fantastic.

This was great, thanks for the quick and easy recipe!

I made a few adjustments as well based on the other reviews, though I think it would have been delicious as is as well.  I added olive oil, balsamic, and Worcestershire sauce to the the sauce.  I used 8 chicken legs with skin still on and baked for 20 minutes at 375 with all the sauce in there and then broiled for 10 more minutes.  Chicken came out soft and delicious, and the sauce was great.  I served it with scallion mashed potatoes and salad.  I would make this again for sure!

Tasty, garlicky, easy--all adjectives that make this recipe perfect for a busy weeknight!  I was mistaken about my chicken.  It was blsl breasts, not thighs, so it took a bit longer to prepare.  Since the recipe calls for using the broiler, I had to stay nearby.  Steamed broccoli and rice make great sides.  Thanks for the idea!

My family loved this. The sauce was so yummy! I only baked B/S breast  in the oven at 375 (which was probably too high since the chicken was a little dry) and I made Angel hair garlic butter noodles...
 "This is great! I'm stuffed but I just want to keep eating it!":) My hubby, verbatim!

This was my first time making this dish and it was so simple and easy. The chicken came out great, i know some people said they basted and stirred theirs, but i just put a lil sauce on the bottom of the pan, laid the chicken on top then spooned the rest over the chicken. Cooked @ 375 for  45min. Once it was done the top was already crisp so there was no need to even put it in broiler and it was very moist and tender.

It was so good even as leftovers. I didn't have parsley flakes on hand nor the minced garlic. I just put garlic powder. I looked this up at last minute and used just what I had. I did the butter, soy sauce, garlic powder. I baked for 30 minutes and then broiled for 10 minutes. 5 minutes each side. I used chicken breast. So good n tender

I loved it so did my husband and toddlers. BUT if you are going to make something as simple as this, then please spend a little extra on chicken you use. I bought Bell and Evans chicken- can I tell you I will never go to another brand of chicken again. I used a store brand chicken drumsticks, and even my husband said that if we had used a higher quality chicken he would of loved it more. 

As for flavor. Amazing. My picky toddlers loved this too. You seriously cant go wrong. Love it and would def make again!

I baked it for 35 minutes under aluminum foil turning over 1/2 way then broiled for 5 minutes a side without foil. Will definitely make again.

Made this tonight, exactly as the recipe is written.  I used 10 pieces of chicken thighs to feed my family of 4 (spread out) .  It was incredibly simple and cooked in 20 minutes.  I broiled the chicken on the second rack, but all the garlic that was on top of the chicken still burned a bit.  Next time, I will cook the thighs upside down and turn half way through when I spoon more sauce on top.  The chicken was very moist and flavorfull - but how could it not with all that butter.  I will make this again, but will have to find something to replace half that butter with!   My hubby and 2 kids really enjoyed this, but I just wish there was a healthier version.

I have made this a number of times.  The last time I used both thighs and boneless breasts.  I did not broil it but baked it at about 450-500 degrees.  Turning after 20 minutes and basting.  Also cut the butter in half only using 4 tablespoons.

This. Was. Awesome.  My husband and 2 girls loved it.  My only complaint is that I didn't double the recipe! I used boneless chicken thighs.  The only thing that I did differently was that I added more salt and I had some chopped onion already so added that too.  The drippings left in the pan were delicious.... I poured some over my steamed broccoli and my husband poured some over white rice.

Using skin on thighs, I obeyed the directions, except I baked them at 375 for 35, then broiled on medium 5 mins each side. It was DELICIOUS.

So easy & so good.  Trying to cut back, so did 1/4 cup of butter & 1/4 cup of olive, everything else the same.  Was excellent.  Served with long grain & wild rice.  Save some of the basting sauce to serve with the rice - Yum.

Made it, loved it, was very good.  Made a few changes such as adding tomato paste to the sauce.  I also decided to crush the garlic with scotch bonnet peppers to give it more of a kick and flavor.  Also added a couple of pinches of dried basil.  I used chicken thighs however next time i believe i will use a mix of chicken parts preferably skinless.

I didn't make this but would like to share how I always broil chicken.  Put the rack at the lowest level in the oven, leave the door ajar, and broil 40 minutes skin side down then turn for 20 minutes.  Great for 1/2 or 1/4 chicken pieces..may shorten for white meat.  Great way to cook marinated chicken.

This is one of my go-to recipes.  Everyone I've served it to loves it!  I bake the thighs at 375 for 45 minutes instead of broiling though.  Simple to make and delicious!

Delicious and easy! I just used a cast iron skillet, melted all the ingredients called for placing in the microwave, placed the chicken in the skilled and made sure to get all the pieces good and wet with the butter mixture.  Cooked under the broiler for 25 minutes and turned the chicken over half way through. That way I got a little crisp on both sides.  Rave reviews from the family and only one skillet to clean!

This was very good and easy as can be.  We didn't find it bland at all. It had a very good taste and the thighs were juicy. I kept to the recipe as written except for cooking at 375 first then broiling. I used a rack in a roasting pan so I just drained the juice before broiling so it wouldn't smoke. Delicious.

I followed others' suggestions and baked at 375 for 45 minutes, flipping the chicken once halfway through. I would highly recommend skinning the chicken pieces because the skin-on chicken thighs rendered so much fat through baking that it completely obscured the flavor of the butter and soy sauce. Another thing - If you leave the skin on, MAKE SURE TO COVER THE DISH. I didn't cover while baking and the resulting smoke was horrendous. I seriously thought I had started a fire. There was sheer chaos in my kitchen for about 10 minutes.  Next time I will make these adjustments because this dish was easy and tasty.

Easy Garlic Broiled Chicken Haiku: "I expected more, based on the 5 star reviews. It was just alright." Not as flavorful as I would've thought, and I followed the recipe as written other than using BSCB instead of thigh. Lots of reviews have some switcharoos and swapadoos, so maybe I should've read and heeded some of those. Glad we tried - the leftovers were better tossed in a Caesar salad for lunch.

This is an excellent way to make chicken. I baked a few boneless, skinless chicken thighs at 350 for about 10 minutes, then broiled it for an additional 10-15 minutes, (until the internal temp reached 165). They were juicy and extremely tasty. I'll be making this all the time. Thanks Avasewell!

This was sooo delicious!  I followed the recipe EXACTLY as written and the chicken was flavorful and super moist.  I cooked the chicken under the broiler on high on the second rack up from the bottom...no smoking.  Super great recipe!!

Simple, good, easy, fast weeknight recipe.  I had to broil until chicken was browned and then bake to finish.  Broiling was too intense even though I lowered the chicken.  Next time I will try marinating the chicken for a bit to intensify the flavor, although the thighs didn't need it, but the breasts did.  I had leftover sauce, so I boiled it for a couple of  minutes (since i was dipping the basting brush in it to and from the raw chicken) and we used it to pour over the chicken and mashed potatoes.

I used bone-in chicken thigs with skin, and braised them in a cast iron skillet followed by 35 minutes at 375 degrees in the oven. I also added some smoked paprika since I like a little kick in my food. The meat turned out wonderful, very flavorful and moist. Can definitely cut the butter in half without losing the taste. A fantastic and quick weeknight recipe.

This has become almost a weekly recipe for us or anytime chicken is on sale. My boys just love it. It has an Asian taste to it you just can't get enough of it. I use the same recipe for the sauce for stirfry as well with beef.  I'm telling you this is so good you won't want to stop eating it, forget dessert.

It turned out fairly good. I did add a little more seasoning because chicken can be very bland. The butter added a nice flavor and a golden brown color. The family liked it also.

I found this years ago, and I've been making it for years.  So, so so good!  This is a family favorite and everyone I feed it to asks for the recipe :)  I usually bake it and baste every 15mins as a previous reviewer mentioned.

Absolutely delicious! Like what was said in the introduction..very easy and you can use with any cut of chicken. I took the advice of another reviewer and baked on 375 for 45 minutes so that I could cook my side which was far farfalle (bow tie ) pasta and in the last minutes of boiling I added fresh broccoli and fresh spinach drained off water and doused it in Italian seasoning and Alfredo sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

I was laughing at my family as I tried to remember what they were saying for this review.  They are picky as can be and were all ranting and raving.  Even my "vegetarian".  The only problem was the broiling smell from my new oven.

This recipe is AMAZING! I baked the chicken instead of broiled (45 mins on 375; it is so tender and juicy)! My only suggestion would be to lightly season the chicken before adding the mixture. Other than that, GREAT RECIPE THAT I WILL BE USING AGAIN!

Quick & easy.  I baked it for 30 min and poured the juices in a saucepan before I broiled it.  5 min per side.  Skin side last.  My husband said it was delicious!  My toddler said this is the best breakfast (dinner) ever!  Will be included in our menu rotation.

Made this recipe as it's written. The only thing I changed was that I used fresh chopped garlic instead of minced and boneless skinless chicken tenders because thats what I had on hand. I baked the chicken for 20 minutes at 375 and broiled for about 5 minutes until the chicken started to brown.

What I love about this recipe:  Great flavor with only a few ingredients and it is super quick and easy to whip up. 

However, next time I think I will reduce the amount of butter, just because I felt like it was a lot.

Super tasty, but way too salty. I only used 4 chicken thighs, but I don't think that should have made a difference in the salt.

I loved this recipe. So easy and fast to prepare. I used boneless thighs that I had and substituted parsley with basil. Tasty, everyone ate it and thought it was good.  This will be on my quick and easy list.

This was the first time I used my broiler...... ever so i was a little nervous but it came out great. This is a fast and easy recipe to make. The chicken came out so juicy and tender.  I definitely will be making this again but I think next time I'll add some honey.

That was the easiest most juiciest and flavorful broiled chicken. I like never broil chicken so I cooked it 15 more mins. I also tweaked it. I only had chopped dried celery and also added dried onions. So good, will make this my go to recipie.

Made it last night.  Very good and easy to make.  I prepared the sauce as shown.  My husband brought home pretty big cuts of chicken thighs so I baked them in the oven at 375 for about 45 minutes (turning over periodically).  I then broiled them for 5 additional minutes. YUM!

My family loved this chicken and I'm very grateful for the recipe as it is very easy, fast, and flavorful!! 

My husband, who is super finicky, was thrilled this morning when he realized that there were a couple of pieces of chicken left over--which he quickly heated up for breakfast.  smh  :o)

Thank you for the awesome recipe!!

This recipe was a hit! While mixing the ingredients together I was kind of paranoid about the flavor. I seasoned the chicken beforehand with Lawry's seasoned salt lightly and followed the recipe except I baked the chicken at 375 and broiled the last 3 minutes for a slightly crispy skin. My family loved it and went back for seconds!

Super yummy and easy to make with minimal ingredients. Don't know if it's my oven or the recipe but both times, I've broiled on high and it takes closer to 40 mins. Besides that, hands down great recipe!

Mother of four loved this easy, quick, delicious recipe. Simple ingredients but taste delicious.  I used strictly drumsticks because of the kids but probably would have been great on chicken breasts. Baked mine at 375 for 15 minutes and then broiled on middle rack for 10 minutes. The finished product looks like the pictures.

This is one of my wife and my favorites. As someone noted elsewhere, instead of broiling it, we bake it in the oven at 375 for 45 minutes. We also replace all that butter with a shot of cooking sherry and let the chicken marinate in the frig for 30 minutes before putting it in the oven. It preserves the same flavor while making the recipe a lot healthier.

So I read the worst reviews first to see what I might have to adjust.  It sounded like the amount of butter was too much from most of the negative reviews.  A little bit of butter adds richness but too much can make things bland.  I reduced the butter to a couple of tablespoons and upped the soy sauce to about 1/4 cup.  I also used the lower sodium soy as one reviewer suggested.  I used the bake til done, then broil at the end method.  The sauce made the chicken a lovely dark golden color and the broiling at the end made the skin crisp and yummy.  The leftover sauce had most of the fat skimmed off (most not all I love butter!) and I put it over rice as a side.  My family LOVED it!!  The flavor was there in full force.  It had such a rich, full, sweet, garlic flavor that enhanced the chicken instead of masking it.  LOVED IT!!!

I made this recipe with boneless, skinless thighs and it was still really good.  My picky son was thrilled and my husband was happy to take the leftovers to work.

I used bone in, skin on chicken thighs, garlic powder instead of diced garlic and I baked it @ 375 for 45 minutes. Otherwise I followed the recipe. My family and I LOVED this recipe. The skin was amazing, the chicken was juicy and the flavors goes excellent together. Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe.

Totally yummy for a garlic lover. I can't believe how easy and delicious it was! I may have added more garlic than called for.

My husband and I loved this recipe! I did however add to it. I added 1tsp of onion powder, 1/2tsp of garlic powder and a 1/2tsp of lemon pepper! My mouth was watering while I was cooking it and it was very delicious!

My husband liked this dish a lot. Said it had a lot of flavor and was very moist. I agree except I don't like to eat the skin, which I removed after cooking, so my chicken had little flavor. Next time I will remove the skin first.  Easy to make and is ready quickly.

Pros
Tasty chicken and is healthier than most meats. Also a juicy and tender chicken recipe.  

Cons
Not enough flavor for me to earn 4 or 5 stars

I used a whole chicken cut up for this recipe.  I made 1 1/2 of the sauce portion, with the exception of the butter, I left it the same.  Turns out I didn't need to do this based on the way I cooked it.  I baked in a casserole for 45 minutes turning and basting every 15 minutes.  Then I removed the chicken to a broiler pain and broiled 5 minutes per side with a little sauce spooned on top.  It has amazing flavor and was very good.  I will make this again.  Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe is super easy and very flavorful.  I used bone-in, skin-on thighs.  These were the tweaks I made to suit our tastes:  Added lots of cayenne pepper, added more black pepper, added onion powder. I put some of the butter mixture under the skin, a little on the bottom and tons on the top/skin.  As another reviewer suggested I baked it at 350 for 30+ minutes, and then put under the broiler.  I wouldn't suggest using the broiler if you have the old school kind like I do.  (It's under the oven.)  I barely had it in there for a minute (as I wanted to crisp the top) and it nearly burned the topping.  I would have been so bummed.  I will skip the broiling step next time - as it doesn't even need it.  My fiance and I loved this.  He said it's a keeper!  Yum!  I will make again.  Thank you for this delicious low-sugar dish!

This chicken is nice and tender with good flavor.  My DH liked it better than I as he likes dark meat and I like the white meat.  The flavor of the ingredients really come through nicely and would work well on grilled chicken, also.  This was served with 'Guferati' 'Steamed Radishes' 'Bacon and Tomato Cups' all AR recipes.

Excellent recipe!! Like others I placed in oven for 375 degrees for about 45-60 mins.  To give it that 5 star restaurant look, I place it broiler on high for 5 minutes.   Upon cooling off, give it a little more restaurant appeal by lightly sprinkling parsley on the chicken prior to serving!  Check out my pics in the review!!!

Really Enjoyed making this as it was really easy. It is however on the greasy side.. Remember to taste you mixture before adding it to the chicken. If you find it bland it most likely needs more seasoning (Soy sauce and pepper)

I decided after reading many reviews to bake the thighs and it was still good. I think the next time I make it, I will put them under the broiler. I made a some cheesy scalloped potatoes for side dish....yummy

I used bone in chicken thighs with the skin on and baked it for 35min at 375 degrees.  The chicken was very moist but it was bland.  Used unsalted butter. Would try salted butter next time.

Made this recipe for dinner tonight, the chicken came our juicy; but I was unable to eat the skin at all because there was way too much garlic and way too much soy sauce. I followed the recipe exactly and it wasn't worth trying again. It was also extremely greasy the chicken was just floating in the butter. The flavor of the sauce was inedible at best.

I made this for my family and they absolutely loved this! The only thing I changed was that I didn't have Parsley so I used Italian blend seasoning instead and i didn't broil it, I baked it at 375F for an hour. It was absolutely delicious! Great recipe, and I will definitely be making this again.

I used two bone-in chicken breasts for this which worked out fine. I kept the skin on too. The only thing I did differently is that I used rosemary instead of parsley only because (shocker) I didn't have parsley at the time.

Great, easy, tasty way to prepare chicken.  The mix kept it moist and smelled great the whole time it was baking.  I didn't need as much as the recipe yielded, though, so I think next time I'll halve it.

Easy to make. I used some fresh garlic and minced when I was in a hurry. I spray Pam on a broiling pan and put foil on the bottom tray. I basted every  5 min and it was done in 20. I used skinless thighs and they turned out juicy ,

I made this for dinner last night, and it was a hit!!  So good and so easy.  I did follow the others that said they baked it instead of broiling it entirely.  I baked it at 375 for 45 minutes, basting it every fifteen.  Next time I make it, I will broil it for a few minutes to make the skin crispy the way I like it.  I served it with jasmine rice and green beans.  There was enough juice in the pan to put over the rice.  Perfection!

Made this with boneless skinless chicken breasts and it was delicious.  The chicken came out very moist and had tons of flavor, but you have to make sure that you remember to keep basting the chicken to make sure that the flavor locks in.

Delicious! I used light soy sauce and fresh parsley. I replaced some of the butter with olive oil.

good recipe, but I changed up the sauce a little. I agree with other users; too salty.

I had one main difficulty with this recipe, when it was almost done broiling, the pan caught on fire. Like flames and everything. I used oil to grease the pan and cooked it for the first 10 minutes at 425, then about 15 minutes on broil (because the chicken was slightly frozen). WHY DID THE PAN CATCH ON FIRE? I am quite confused

I have never been a fan of soy or garlic, but must say, this marinade was heavenly, not overbearing like some.  Simple, tasty, delicious.  I used boned skinless thighs and baked at 375 for 45 minutes.  Next time I'll half the butter and substitute the other half with olive oil.  I'll probably even use this marinade to grill my boneless breasts.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

Fantastic recipe: very easy and quick to put together and tastes great. I usually use garlic powder to make it even quicker and it works just as well as fresh.

I thought the chicken was fairly bland with very little flavor.  It smelled and looked really good when it came out of the oven, but it tasted like it needed something else.  I followed the ingredients almost exactly, but I didn't realize I was out of parsley until I started to make it.  Maybe that was what it needed.  I baked instead of broiling the chicken.  I used chicken legs instead of the skinless thighs.  When my husband came home from work and reheated some, he really enjoyed it.

Delicious! Family loved it.  I did add about 1/2 cup white wine to soften the soy sauce taste, but I think it would have been fine without it.  Use low sodium soy sauce if you have a family member with sodium restrictions like I do.

Made the recipe just like it was written and loved it.  Broiled for 5 mins each side and basted it each time I turned it.  Served it with mashed potatoes and mixed in some of the garlic sauce, was delicious.  Will use boneless chicken next time simply to make it easier to eat.

Very easy weekday meal. I used light soy sauce. I turned and basted every 5 minutes and juices ran clear @ approx. 18 min. Kids loved it, no complaints of it being spicy!

Very good & extremely easy.  I used boneless chicken tenderloins, 2 extra large fresh pressed cloves of garlic, 1/3 cup butter, and an Italian seasoning blend since I didn't have dried parsley.  The blend had pepper so I skipped the extra pepper and it had just enough kick.  Broiled 5 minutes, basted and broiled 3 more.  And yes, I did set off the smoke alarm but the chicken was perfect!

This was an easy dish to make.  I browned the chicken in olive oil, then transferred it to a bakeing dish and drizzled it with the sauce.  I then baked it in a 350 degree oven for thirty minutes, basting with the remaining sauce halfway through.  Next I broiled the chicken for five minutes to make the skin a little crispy.  Very good!

It was just ok. Besides the fact that the smoke alarm kept going off every time i opened the oven to turn the chicken, you should add some salt and pepper directly to the chicken if you want some more flavoring.

This one is a "keeper" for sure. Both my 6 yr old and 4 yr old gave it 2 thumbs up! I followed it pretty close. I did set my oven broiler at 475 and left them in there for 30 mins. I did flip them half way through. Came out perfect!

This recipe is wonderful.  It is so easy can make it quickly after work and I always have these ingredients handy, but, best of all it tastes like it took forever.  I did take the suggestions to half the amount of butter and I pounded the chicken first so it would cook more evenly.  Thanks so much for this recipe it will be made many times in my house!

I found a good deal on chicken thighs and thought I'd give this a try.  It was pretty good.  It was pretty fatty--I'd probably take off the skin next time.  I doubled the mushrooms as we love mushrooms and I strongly recommend that.

Awesome recipe. Fresh parsley in this recipe is amazing. After chicken was done, i deglazed the pan with about 1/2 cup white wine, added 1 tsp. flour and some green onion. whisked till thickened, and poured over roasted red potatoes. Best dinner yet!

This is a new household favorite.  I made it last night after an appointment ran late & I couldn't attempt the much more elaborate meal that I had planned.  Using boneless skinless thighs and dried parsley flakes, this was absolutely delicious.  The only thing I did that is not listed here is that I seasoned the meat with Original Spike seasoning.  I also baked on 425 for 35 minutes, turning the meat occasionally.  

This is going to be a very regular feature in my household, for sure!!

hands down best chicken recipe I've ever found.  I have 5 kids, and every single one of them love this recipe.  I have made it 3 weeks in a row, and they can't get enough.  Husband's favorite chicken as well!  The only changes I made were that I pierced the thighs and marinated them for about 2 hours. Yum Yum yum!!!!!

Very easy, very tasty recipe. Chicken was tender and juicy. I baked the chicken in the marinade for 45 minutes. Then i moved the chicken to a foil lined, and sprayed pan to broil 5 minutes per side and it crisped the skin right up. Will definitely make again!

The garlic burnt up in the first 5 minutes. I was worried about that. I must admit I took some other reviewers advice and used a butter oil garlic mixture instead of following the recipe to the T. I ended up covering with tinfoil but I think that made me need to cook longer. It ended up with an outer harder layer of chicken and the burnt garlic. I know this recipe has potential and could taste great if I could get the cooking time down and fix the garlic burning problem. I will try again, with the digital meat thermometer and lower the oven rack from the top more, maybe use garlic powder??

Moist and delicious. Not a lot of flavor depth,  but sometimes simple is best! Definitely only a once in a while dish with the amount of butter!

Fantastic! My boyfriend loves this dish. I added more butter than soy to decrease the saltiness of the dish and used fresh garlic. Delicious!

A little bit salty, but very tasty! Next time i'll use unsalted butter, and the reduced sodium soy sauce.

Loved this!  I don't have to much time to cook and don't do it very much.  I'm so glad I tried this dish.  It was super easy.  My husband really loved it.  Even my picky 8 and 10 yr old loved, they wanted more!

Delicious! I used 1/2 as much butter and 4 extra pieces of chicken. 
Definitely recommend that you follow the part of the recipe and cook some of the chicken separately (ie not in with the sauce). Will make this again

My extremely picky kids and hubs who does not care for chicken ALL raved for this. He said to cook it any time and maybe we should have people over when we have it next time. My family gives it two huge thumbs up!

I made this exactly as directed with the exception of using skinless thighs; it was quick, easy, and delicious!  The kids loved it and asked that I make it "tomorrow and the next day and the day after that!"  I didn't have any problems with smoking, but I laid the thighs out flat on the dish and flipped them several times during cooking, so no one spot was left undisturbed to burn. It's not the healthiest dish, but it will still be making my regular rotation.

This recipe is awesome!  I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs and dipped them in the sauce before placing them into the baking dish.  I baked them for about 35 minutes at 375 and then broiled them for about 10 minutes.  The taste was divine!

These were very good.  I used skinless chicken thighs.  The first time I made them in the oven per the directions, but the second time we put them on the grill.  Even better!  This will be our go to marinade all summer.  Thank you!

Just got done eating this for dinner and my whole family gave rave reviews. And it couldn't have been easier. For an even tastier treat, try a glaze of Tabasco pepper jelly on top. I also added red pepper flakes to the butter mixture. Excellent flavor! I will definately be making this again!

I've made this many times and love it. Like LindaK, I bake instead of broil to avoid the smoke: 375F for 45 minutes. At the end of the cooking time, I put the broiler on for a minute or two to crisp up the skin.

Amazing!~ Try it this way...I baked the chicken in a pyrex dish covered with foil on 225 for 2 hours and then broiled for 5 minutes.  It was perfect.

Chicken tasted fine.  Was a lot of working chopping all that garlic.  I did replace some of the butter with peanut oil.  Following the suggestions of others, I baked at 375 for 30 minutes in the foil lined (several layers) broiler pan bottom.  Then transferred the chicken pieces to the broiler pan top and poured the accumulated into a bowl (removed one of the layers of foil).  Put the broiler pan into the broiler pan bottom and spooned about half of the sauce onto the chicken pieces.  Broiled for 5 minutes.  Turned over, spooned on the rest of sauce and broiled for another 5 minutes.  Looked beautiful and no smoke.  I increased the meat (but no the sauce).  Had what felt about the right amount for 8 thighs and 4 small breasts.  Removed the rest of the foil and had no pan to clean!  DH and 18-yr old son liked the recipe and said they thought that the pairing of the chicken with the White and Wild Rice Pilaf (found on this site) was what the whole meal so good.  DH took the leftover chicken for lunches.

Felt that was a bitt too much butter.  Did like the flavor and was glad about the cooking adaptation comments so I didn't just have to broil.

I baked it for 45 minutes at 375 degrees as suggested by another review.  It was scarfed down by the family including picky child.  I feel like it was missing something, maybe ginger?  Overall, will make this again and recommend this recipe!

I think I will try baking next time I managed to burn the skin under the broiler so little flavor carried into the meat of the chicken.  I did taste the mix before adding the chicken and loved the combination and think it would make a fantastic chicken stir fry sauce.  A keeper for sure.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was WONDERFUL!  The only change I made was to par-boil the chicken and then cook it on the grill.  Everything else was per the directions, and we loved it!  I will definitely make this over and over for my garlic-loving family!

Very easy to make and absolutely delicious! I'm too cheap to use much butter so I used about half olive oil. It wasn't greasy at all, and the juices were so good to dip the chicken in. Usually when I make chicken breasts they turn out dry and people accuse me of trying to choke them, but this recipes made moist chicken breasts. Everyone was happy. I will be making this recipe alot! Good for sandwiches and on salads, too. Thank you for this yummy, quick and easy chicken recipe!

Yum!  EAsy, quick, and delicious. What's not to like?  Well, my arteries and butt might not appreciate all the butter. Next time I'll use a little less butter and I'm thinking it will still be quite tasty. Also, I added more garlic and used fresh parsley instead of dried.

I made this with the suggested modification of 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter and, since I was out of dried parsley, I added basil instead. I also used skinless, organic chicken breasts. My 7 year old thanked me for cooking tonight, and that is not a guaranteed thing!

Absolutely perfect.  I took advice from one of the comments to bake it on 375 for 45 minutes.  Worked out perfectly.  The chicken is to freakin' die for.

I made this dish tonight only used margarine instead of butter and, boneless skinless chicken breast it came out fabulous! Had it along w/ spinach and, brown rice also made another serving of the soy sauce margarine mix and poured a little over the rice it was great! My son and, I loved it and, it will be added to the family menu. =)

Husband was recently diagnosed with diabetes and I needed a recipe to use on split chicken breasts. I followed recipe to the tee, substituting regular butter for lite butter and using reduced sodium soy sauce.  To keep it moist when it was done, I wrapped it in foil for 10 min, unwrapped, sliced and basted some more.  So delicious!!! Served with mixed veggies and yellow rice. Will definitely make again.

So very tasty! I did 15 mins... flipped... 15 more and it was perfect! I also pulled the skin up on one end after I basted it and twisted it over so the sauce was next to the meat while still being covered with the skin. In place of the Parsley I used Penzey Spices Herbs de Provence for added flavor.

Great recipe! I used half the amount of butter and bone in thighs and drumsticks. I rubbed olive oil on the chicken and placed them inside a slow cooker I had placed aluminum foil in. I poured the sauce over the chicken and added enough water to cover the bottom. I let it cook for about hour or so. It was delicious! Other than my changes I followed the recipe exactly.

What did I miss? The garlic ended up blackened in the pan, not on the chicken (and I baked it, only broiling the last 10 min!). It was all right but I couldn't really taste the sauce. I think the sauce would make a good marinade though, I think that's the way to go, then bake.

I didn't really care for this much.  It didn't have enough garlic flavor, and it seemed a little plain!  Maybe I did something wrong, but I was disappointed.

This was very tasty and definitely not difficult. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and baked at 375 for 35-40 minutes. The chicken was very moist. I dipped bread into the garlicy leftover sauce in the pan, which wasn't healthy, but very tasty.

Great recipe.  The whole family enjoyed this!  My only change was to cook it at 375 for 45 minutes.  Then, I covered and broiled it for 10 minutes more.  Will make this one again!

My family loves this chicken!  Instead of soy, I use teriyaki sauce to give it a sweeter taste. Boneless, skinless chicken breasts cooks fast with this recipe. When cooking chicken legs, I let it bake on 375 for 20 minutes first, then proceeded with broil on Low for 20 minutes.  Then I finished up with a high broil for 5 minutes on each side.  Delicioso!!

Delicious!  My husband hates baked chicken, and for the first time ever he ate it.  He liked it so much, I only got 2 pieces.  The flavors really set in on the second day.  We ate the left-overs and we never eat left-overs.  Thanks for posting this recipe, super easy and tastes great.

Awesome. I used boneless, skinless thighs. I added chives and Rosemary with the parsley and baked for about a half and hour, basting, and the broiled for a few minutes. My kids and husband said it  was the best recipe I have gotten off the Internet. I was awesome!

Sometimes "easy" can be a bit misleading since "easy if you know what you're doing" and "easy for a clueless cook like me" are two different things. However this recipe turned out amazing! I've never used chicken thighs before, but they were free so i looked on here an found this recipe. And it really was easy. I used a baking sheet, made the amount of topping shown but only had 4 thighs so tossed some potatoes in with the butter mix first and put those right next to the chicken on the sheet. Baked for 45 minutes (i've never used the broil function on my oven so i was a little leery to try that) and it tastes FANTASTIC.

I made this with split chicken breasts, so baked it at 375* for 35 minutes, then broiled for 10 minutes. I served it with white rice and green beans. The sauce in the bottom of the pan is excellent over rice. I also used low sodium soy sauce, and think it could have used a pinch of salt when it came out of the oven. My husband, 4 year old and 3 year old all loved it! It was very easy and I plan on making it again.

This is a great recipe, thanks! I had chicken thighs (bone-in), and I was feeling lazy, so I used garlic powder (approx 1/2 t) for the garlic (and did not have parsley). Otherwise, I followed the directions, and it was great. My kids loved it--my 8-yr old ate 3 pieces!! I will make this again and again, and it would be easy to substitute whatever spices you wanted with the butter.

This dish is fantastic just the way it is! I didn't use butter - I use Earth Balance non-gmo spread instead.  Turned out awesome - I served it with jasmine rice and french style green beans.  My family loved it.  This one got added to our menu. ;-)

This was pretty good. I baked it at 375 for 45 minutes, turning it over twice during baking. I think the addition of some other flavors might be helpful as most of the flavor seems to come from the butter. Perhaps if I had broiled it (which I couldn't do because I no longer have a broiler in my oven) it would have cooked up a little different. It was definitely great for last minute cooking, but in the future I think I'll probably try to infuse some more pepper, and use unsalted butter.

Very easy.  Baked 6 boneless, skinless thighs at 350C for 30minutes.    Used 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 butter.  2 tbsp soy, 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar. Will definitely make again.

This was such an easy and tasty recipe.  I added a bit more garlic, used low sodium soy sauce, and cut it back to 6 Tbsp of butter.  Would like to try "I Can't Believe..." instead, to lower the saturated fat.  Next time!

I love this sauce on chicken. I think it makes plain chicken really stand out and this recipe is usually something that you always have on hand so it's perfect when you don't know what to do with chicken. I will always keep this!

Made this using a serving size of 6 w/boneless thighs, and really enjoyed it.  Did cut the butter by about 1/3, but could probably reduce a little more.

Very good recipe.  I followed a reviewer that said to bake at 375 for 35 minutes, turning once, and then broil 5 minutes on each side.  It was good, but I think I would like it better cooked a little slower so it was falling off the bone tender.  The sauce is delicious - I served it over rice and there was not a bit left!  Will use the sauce recipe and roast the chicken next time.

I made this using the thighs as suggested and they turned out great. I did bake them instead of broiling. Next time I will use chicken breasts and marinate them overnite to get a stronger flavor. Thanks for a good, super easy recipe!!

This was delicious and easy, I just pour some over the thighs and baked for 45 minutes at 375.  Kids loved it too.  There weren't any leftovers.

Awesome chicken!  I followed another review and baked at 375 for 45 minutes.  I made a mix of thighs and legs and had double what the recipe called for and the marinade was the perfect amount for coating.  The skin came out super crispy, so yummy.  I will definitely be making this again.

This we absolutely delicious! My husband ranted and raved about it and he doesn't usually rant about anything with chicken in it.  He even asked me to make it again the next day because he didn't get enough of it, the kids ate most of it. Thanks for sharing!!

I read through most of the reviews and decided best if I altered a few things. I did cut down on the butter, almost in 1/2. I used Liquid Aminos by Braggs, instead of soy sauce and being that most reviewers said it lacked flavor, I decided to season my chicken thighs prior to applying the butter mix. I heated the oven at 375 and baked for 30 minutes and broiled for 10 minutes. With these minor changes, the dish came out GREAT! Will make again.

Didn't broil, bakes bone-in thighs for 45 min at 375.  Turned out really well.  Even the kiddo, whose become choosy, liked it.  Garlic mellowed in the oven, don't be overwhelmed by the amount.  I did add a touch of honey.  mmmmm.... will make again!

This recipe is frequently used at my place.   As other reviewers stated, I baked the chicken instead of broiling it.  I also use olive oil instead of butter, because 1/2 cup of butter is just way too fattening for me.  I have tried it with the butter though, the very first time I made it and it was very delicious as well.

I used bone in skin on chicken quarters. I used fresh flat leaf parsley. I opted to bake as others suggested 350 for 1 hour. I did not need to put it under the broiler for color it came out beautiful and it was cooked perfectly.  I just didn't care for the flavor.  The soy sauce just made it weird for me.  I'd have given it 3 stars but my husband liked it. I doubt I'll make this again.

This was great.  Even my husband loved it.  I used skinless chicken to make this recipe a bit more heart friendly and used more garlic because I love garlic.  If you're using any substantial quantity of garlic in a recipe, fresh garlic is the way to go because its lighter tasting.  I have found that the pastes and jars of pre-minced garlic are too pungent.  Dried minced garlic doesn't do justice to this recipe. Thanks!

i thought this recipe was so easy to make. i used chicken thighs with no skin, and i marinated over night.  i used no butter.  i baked the thighs in the oven on a flat sheet with olive oil spread on it.  My husband loved it!  ps. you can also marinade the thighs and freeze in a plastic freezer bag for quick week cooking.

This chicken did stay moist, which was good, but we didn't find it overly flavorful.  I did tweak the recipe some (half butter and olive oil and chicken tenders instead of thighs) but I don't think that's enough to have really changed the flavor.  Maybe next time (if I make it again) I'd add even more garlic and less soy sauce.

Awesome! I make this at least once a week, the only change I made was baking them at 350 for 45 minutes instead of broiling them, make sure you baste them! Sooooo good, sometimes I add more garlic if in the mood.

I didn't think this recipe was that great. WAY too much butter. I used slightly less that what was called for and still ended up with pretty greasy chicken. Chicken thighs aren't dry to begin with. Why add all of that fat? The flavor was OK, but nothing spectacular. I won't be making this again.

Not bad considering the cut of chicken. If you have to eat thighs go for this recipe.

Tried this recipe for supper and it was a hit !! Had some really bad quality chicken legs and with this recipe it at least tasted good.  My 1,5 yr old wolfed down a whole leg in speeding light and my 3,5 yr old loved the chicken and the drippings from the broiling so much that it drowned the nan bread in it and before I could react - he took the bowl with the drippings and drank half of it !!!! Even my hubby liked the taste who has been extreme picky the last weeks. Actually that goes for hubby and kids.....  I used soy sauce with less salt since my kids were gonna eat it. And the first dripping from the cooking was to fatty but the dripping from the broiling was yummy !!!!

My husband thought that the chicken tasted "blah" but after sprinkling some garlic salt on it (I like salt), he said it tasted better but I loved it.  I used low sodium soy sauce because that's what I had on hand but probably if I used the regular soy sauce, I wouldn't have had to add salt to the dish.  To cut down on the fat, I broiled the chicken thighs (boneless & skinless) without the butter sauce, drained the grease from the pan and then added the sauce and let the chicken brown under the broiler for a few more minutes.

Subbed chicken breasts cut into medallions.  Broiled ~8" from heat and had no problem with smoke as others did (I have a gas stove).  The end product was chicken beautifully glazed that tasted wonderful.  Also, with all the butter in this dish, there is no need to lightly grease the pan before cooking.  Time stated for cooking was about right, though I used a meat thermometer to ensure it was cooked perfectly.

This was easy, quick and really good flavor. I used chicken breasts. I butterflied the breasts to be thinner for quick cooking. My husband really enjoyed this. We have difficulty  cooking chicken breast - they always seem un- flavorful. This is a great recipe!

Wow!   This was so easy to prepare and with only a few ingredients this is totally affordable too! Make sure you check after your first flip (about 8-10 minutes in) they darken fast so you want to pull them out quick as soon as they are done.

This was delicious! My fiance is pretty picky when it comes to trying new recipes, and he loved this! I baked this instead of broiling it. Will be one of my new go to's when making chicken.

Instead of broiling I baked (8) thighs for 3 hours at 275F. I basted once halfway through baking and drained excess fat at that time as well. This made a nice mildly flavored chicken to pull off the bone and use for soups and sandwiches. I liked it because the pulled chicken wasn't bland, but was light enough that it could be added to any soup/casserole/etc without overpowering other ingredients.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I thought it would have a lot more flavor, especially with the combo of garlic and soy sauce. This was really bland, and lacking in flavor. This was nothing special at all.

Fantastic & EASY! I used the skinless, boneless thighs & followed the recipe. I had no smoking whatsoever. After it was done, I pulled the chicken in the pain and let it soak up the yummy juice!

Amazing!!  Very versatile recipe that can be slightly changed and still very delicious!  Per other reviews, I baked skinless bone-in thighs for 35 min, basting every 10 minutes and turning them over halfway through.  I then broiled 5 min on each side.  I also used dried tarragon instead of parsley since it's my favorite herb, and the dish came out fantastic!  Chicken was soft on the inside and just the right amount of crunch on the outside.

Outstanding flavor!  Like some other reviewers, I reduced the butter to 4 tablespoons and baked the chicken, using the broiler for a few minutes at the end to crisp the skin.  My chicken thighs were bone-in and worked fine.  The family agreed: this one's a keeper.

Am surprised with all of the great reviews, I thought that this was just mediocre.  I had never made it and brought everything to my brothers to make it for the first time.  Used breasts instead of thighs but that was the only change.  Thought it was too much butter and not enough flavor.  Will not make again but search for something new.  Everyone else thought it was OK as well.

wow this did not work for me at all.  I am a very seasoned cook, but the garlic burned black on the chicken, and it was still raw in the middle.  Should have known this was going to happen when I put under the broiler.  Also when it was done, it was literally swimming in a half inch of butter and fat.  Not my idea of a good meal, sorry

I baked it @ 375 like other reviewers said. Fresh parsley is a MUST and I did reduce the amount of butter by half. I basted the chicken about 4-5 times and broiled it for the last few minutes. It turned out juicy (i think the amount of garlic could be reduced. i'd make this recipe every other week if my family doesn't get sick of this dish! =D

I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts and baked at 400 for about 30 minutes.  The chicken was juicy but it was very strong and greasy.  The house still smells and I made it last night.  Not sure I would make this again unless I followed directions to the T.

I fixed this as one recommended baking it 45 minutes instead of broiling but this was absolutely delicious, and would have been probably either way. Thank you so much for a wonderful main course, will be using this recipe regularly.

This was very good though, it needed something else. The high heat cooked the flavor out of the butter. It needed something maybe a citrus?.. to give it some depth.

We chopped up the chicken and cooked it in a pan instead of baking. It was excellent and done in like no time. It was still tender and like it came from a fancy restaurant. Also we used a little less butter and put a weency bit of oil in the pan before cooking it.

This recipe is very easy and liked by my hubby and kids. I used boneless breasts. I poured the butter mixture over the chicken and baked it all in the pan at 400. Yummy.

I usually don't keep the skin on the chicken, but this time I did and it turned out delicious!  The chicken was super moist, with tons of flavor.  The broiler made the skin super crispy, like fried chicken!  My kids and husband loved this and it was quick and easy.  I get tired of boneless, skinless chicken breasts so this was a real treat!

Made this last night with boneless skinless chicken breast.  I baked it in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes, turning half way though and then finished on the gas grill.  This is awesome.  I didn't change a thing with the ingredients.  Be sure and use fresh garlic.  It reminds me of some of the garlic chicken I had in the garlic restaurant here in Okinawa!

This is very good, and easy to make. Used skinless chicken breasts and baked instead of broiling.  Common ingredients make it a breeze to prepare.  Thanks Avasewell for sharing.

My chicken smelled delicious and came out moist but a little bland. I used boneless skinless breasts and followed the suggestion of baking at 375 for 35 minutes,then broiling 5 minutes on each side. Marinating the chicken in the sauce will probably help. I'll try this again.

Loved this! I used boneless skinless breasts since that was all I had. I cut it into strips before broiling. When it was done I served it over white rice with some steamed asparagus! Even the kids loved it! Will def. make again.

This recipe is amazing! I am not a big cook, but I was looking for something simple to marinade my chicken in and with very few ingredients and came across this! The chicken came out very juicy, not dry, and just so full of flavor! This is a VERY good recipe!

I used bone-in, skinless chicken breasts. I followed some of the suggestions and baked them in the oven for about an hour (at 350F) instead of broiling them. They turned out very moist and everyone seemed to enjoy them. I think if I make them again I will cut back on the garlic a bit, the smell in the house is a little over-whelming!

I'm giving it three stars as written. The flavor of the sauce was very good and it smelled wonderful while it was cooking. But the meat was a bit dry and not as flavorful as I hoped it would be. Next time I try it I will marinade it for awhile beforehand and then bake it instead of broiling.

I only give it 4 stars because I tweaked the recipe. Instead of all butter I used 1/4 olive oil and 1/4 cup butter. I substituted 1 1/2 tbsp worshestire sauce for the 3 tbsp soy sauce. I also added a splash (a tbsp) of white wine and topped the chicken with fresh slice mushrooms for the last 5 mins. I made sure to baste the mushrooms.

This recipe is simple and absolutely awesome. I did make a few changes just so I could avoid going to the grocery store to get all the ingredients. First I added Cutie clementine slices to the casserole dish and a few dashes of Tastefully Simple dried tomato and garlic pesto mix since I don't have any parsley on hand. I also added a pinch of cayenne pepper just for a little spice. Then I baked the dish at 375 for 45 minutes (as advised by a previous review) and turned it over every 15 minutes. The clementines really added some sweetness and tang and gave it an even more Asian appeal. Yum!!

These weren't bad at all, but I was expecting something mouthwatering per the other reviews.  I used bone in skinless thighs and they did come out very tender but the flavor was lacking (I even ended up sprinkling extra salt on them before broiling).  The bake-then-broil method gave me very tender chicken, I don't think it could have effected the flavor tho.  I will try again but with FRESH, not jarred, garlic.

I used boneless, skinless breasts. This was good but I'm not sure it was worth all of the garlic.  Definitely serve it with a plain side (we used a seasoned orzo from this site).

I cooked this for dinner tonight. i used teriaki sauce instead of soy sauce (because it turned out, we were out) and I realize that changed the recipe, but it was WONDERFUL. I will definitely make this again. I may try boneless/skinless breasts as i just found out my husband has sworn off skin, but otherwise it was great. and easy.

So wasy to prepare and tasted good as well. I used boneless skinless chicken breast that I cut up into small stip like sizes, because I was making this mainly for my kids. They both ate without complaining. I was worried the soy sauce would give it a weird taste to them, but they didn't mind it.

Easy is the key word of this recipe. In 25 minutes I had wonderful tender chicken breasts that melted in our mouths. I broiled (placing breasts on a foiled-covered roasting pan in the bottom of the oven.  I turned after 15 minutes and only broiled 10 more minutes (I actually turned off the oven after 5 minutes and kept it in there for another 5 with the oven off)...Delicious

I had some spare chicken thighs and I needed to cook them up.  Ran into this recipe, that was quick and smart.  I did have boneless thighs, but it worked great anyway!  Using a little trick I learned from Christopher Walken's youtube video of cooking, I removed the skin for the basting and replaced it with every of the chicken, which came out to 4 turns.  It was awesome, my daughter loved it and the leftovers made and incredible flavored chicken salad.

The soy sauce was too much. I'd lessen it by a tablespoon.

I followed the recipe exactly except I used boneless skinless chicken thighs. It was delicious! My husband had to stop himself from eating more than his fill, and my 2 year-old cleaned her plate! This will definitely be added to our dinner rotation!

We loved this! I doubled the sauce & I split the butter in 1/2 & the other 1/2 I used olive oil. I used boneless chicken breast. Will definitely make again!

Very tasty.  I baked at 375 for 30 mins instead of broiling.  I also used canola oil instead of butter and it turned out well.

This chicken was pretty yummy. I used 1/4 C oil instead of the butter, and 2 T garlic. I made this with a whole chicken and roasted it at 350 for about 1 1/2 hours. I think I would try the broiling method in the future with cut up chicken.  Thanks!

Very tasty! I used a combination of 3 T. olive oil and 3 T. butter. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I think a little bit of lime juice will be delicious in this recipe. I served it with rice pilaf and mixed vegetables. Loved it!

I highly enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't have a smoking problem at all.  Making the garlic butter is a great smell that gets the juices going right away.  The chicken was a tad under cooked after the 20mins.  I'm thinking of baking the chicken for some time in the oven, then finish it up in the broiler to brown the outside.  Taste great!  I will make this again!

This was amazing! It's hard to find something that really gets a reaction out of my boyfriend, but he loved it! I had to make a few adjustments on cooking time and ended up using extra sauce to prevent it from burning on the baking pan. It was so quick, easy and absolutely delicious!

i love this recipe made it for the first time lastnight,me and my boyfriend both very impressed. It's actually easy and taste good. I did the same thing as directed with the chicken thighs but with bone and skin, not too big pieces. And i also sprinkle a liltle bit of meat tenderizer on op of the pieces at the last 15 min so that the skin taste just a lil salty( i think seasoned salt should do as well), it was perfect with white rice and steamed carrots.

This was excellent! I stuffed it with herb cream cheese and wrapped each slice in bacon. The bacon was super crispy! If I had more time, I would have reserved the extra liquid and used it to make some rice. This was a big hit, no leftovers!!

This was a delicious chicken. I wanted something quick and easy to have with potato salad and fried rice and this fit the bill perfectly.  I used skinless chicken pieces because it's what I had on hand and I did pre-marinate my chicken in a herb mix before coating and baking - but changed nothing else. For some who said the garlic burnt or the chicken got too brown, etc. You need to turn and baste the chicken during cooking. I did this almost every 5 minutes and it turned out great. I am not accustomed to broiling my meat and it surprised me how well it cooked up and quickly too. Upon starting I thought it might need more time, but 20 minutes was enough. I will make again. Thanks.

I prefer to rate a recipe on the ACTUAL recipe, not what I added or substituted.  I made this recipe as stated and we loved it!  My only disgression was using slightly less garlic (2 tbs) and lite soy sauce.  I didn't add any additional spices/sauces and it was absolutely delicious!  The aroma was amazing as it cooked and the prep was so simple.  I didn't need to go out and buy anything I didn't already have in my kitchen.  I wanted something quick and easy for chicken thighs and was happy to find this recipe.  I will use it next time I make boneless breasts and serve it with plain rice as I feel the sauce we go well over the rice. Thanks!

This recipe was delicious!  I think that next time I may not use boneless chicken thighs.  I found them to be a bit fatty.  I baked the chicken for about 20 minutes at 350 degrees, and then I broiled the chicken for 10 minutes on high!  I cooked them on my stoneware, and the chicken was very tender and juicy!  Next time I think I will use boneless skinless chicken breasts, and I think that I will salt and pepper the chicken before I pour the garlic mixture over it for extra flavor.  Other than that, Fabulous!!  My kids ate it up!!

I have to give this 5 stars. It was not only delicious, but beautiful. I took other readers' advice and baked 35 min turning once, and then broiled separately 5 min each side. It was perfect. I've never been able to get that golden look until now. Thanks for a great and simple recipe.

I was very pleased with the result of this recipe.  It was definitely easy and juicy!  I did bake for an hour at 375, just to avoid the smoke from broiling.  My husband is not a huge fan of chicken and he liked this as well. Next time I will try this recipe on the grill and try a few more seasonings such as Thyme and chives!  Very good recipe AVASEWELL, Thank you.

I used this recipe with a few modifications and it has come out flawless each time.  I use skinless thighs and grill them instead of broiling:  10 minutes on over indirect heat on medium-low heat, then 10 minutes over direct heat on the same temperature, turning and basting every five minutes.

I have probably made this 20 times by now, actually I just popped it in the oven and realized I never reviewed it. We LOVE this recipe.  I use jumbo thighs and bake in the oven at 375 for 1 hour and 15 minutes, then a quick shot under the broiler to crisp up the skin. Serve over white rice, it is falling off the bone and oh so yummy

this chicken is so easy and yummy to make.  i buy the organic minced garlic from costco to make cooking easier.  i do not baste the chicken but pour as much marinade into the cooking pan as possible.  as suggested by one of the reviewers, i bake at 375 for 35-45 minutes then broil each side for 5 minutes on high.  everyone loves this recipe and begged me to make more!

I loved this recipe! It was easy to make and tasted great. 4 stars for flavor and the 5th star for simplicity.  The only thing I did differently was to grill boneless chicken breasts instead of thighs and the  broiler. Thanks AVASEWELL.
UPDATE: This recipe works great for bonless breasts in the oven also. I began to brioil them, but realized I needed more time for the rest of dinner to cook. So I turnd the oven on at 375 and baked them uncovered for 30 min. Then I let sit covered for 10 minutes. I have never made a more tender, juicy breast!

I could say it was the best chicken iv ever had. I just added a little chicken season and a dash of lime joice. 375 for 45 min and then broiled for 5 min. I like my meat well done. thank you for sharing this.

I just made this and I'm eating it right now.  Love the flavor!  Although I almost burned the house down, LOL.  I had the broiler on high and come back into the kitchen after just five minutes and there was smoke everywhere.  Broil on LOW, or don't put the pan too close.  At least I caught it when I did, and it didn't even burn.  I might try this on other cuts of chicken or even steak.  VERY GOOD!  Thanks for the recipe!

I used boneless skinless chicken breast for this recipe because it's what I had on hand. Overall, it wasn't bad but it wasn't the best chicken I've ever had. I baked it at 350 for about 25 minutes basting every 5-10 minutes. The chicken was very tender and if you put enough garlic on anything it's bound to be good right? I will probably try this again but might change it up a bit. Thanks for the recipe

Very good. I too used half butter, half olive oil and substituted fresh rosemary for the parsely. I also added a few squirts of honey and it was delicious. I baked it at 350 for about a half hour. I suggest slicing the chicken after it's cooked and then spooning the left over liquid from the baking dish over the sliced chicken. The sauce was good on the brown rice too..

UNBELIEVABLY AWESOME!!!  I had a couple chicken thighs left over so i used both thighs and B/S breasts.  Both were so tender and juicy.  One of the best recipes i've used in a long time.  Will make again, and again, and again, and again.  Thank you!

The family loved the recipe. I used the regular soy, but mixed it up with Smart Balance which took decreased some of the salt. Awesome, quick, and excellent tasting recipe.

Very good. Probably could have done without the entire stick of butter if keeping the skins on. And I only used about 1T of minced garlic.

I'm not real sure what to say about this recipe.  It wasn't good, but it wasn't bad.  It falls somewhere in between.  Nobody that ate it commented on it so I'm pretty sure I won't make this again.

I used Smart Balance instead of butter and it was really good. For bone in chicken, I broiled for 20 minutes skin side down, turned, brushed with remaining sauce, and then cooked for 20 more minutes on second shelf from the top.

Found it to be very bland, was able to save the meal with some spicy barbecue sauce.

Delicious!!!! So easy I did exactly what the recipe called for I like dark meat and I found this to be very flavorful it would work nice even on boneless skinless chicken breast. I choose to cook it at 375 for 45 minutes I think next time though alittle less the broiler always smokes the house this is why I choose to cook it this way. I served it with worcestshire brown rice from the biggest loser cookbook and a tossed salad. My son loved it. thanks for a wonderful recipe.

This was very good.  Did it in the oven at 350 instead of broil.  The whole house smelled of garlic (which is okay as we love garlic). Daughter tried a piece when she stopped by and then called me for the recipe.  THis is a keeper.

This recipes is AWESOME!  Do yourself a favor and try using boneless chicken thighs, it tastes so much better!  I made it for my nephew and he ate like 6 thighs by himself!  I cannot say enough about it, just try it!!

made it tonight with skinless thighs and cooked it 5 min. longer because mine were a little frozen still when I put them in.  I made 8 pieces with this recipe.  It was great!  My kids liked it too.  I turned them 4 times during cooking and used a high broil setting with chicken on a large foil covered baking sheet on the middle rack.  I didn't have any smoking as others did.  They were very juicy.

I used chicken leg quarters for this recipe, and followed several reviewer's advice to bake at 375 degrees for an hour (chicken was still slightly frozen) instead of broiling.  Because of the low smoke-point of the butter, I still had some smoking, but not nearly as much as the high temps. of broiling would have caused.  I love how the skin on the chicken turned a beautiful crispy golden brown:  a feast for the eyes too!  I used half the butter and garlic, and still had plenty with which to baste. I also used half Worcestershire & half low-sodium soy sauce.   Next time I may try it with boneless, skin-on thighs (really a necessity with this recipe; the basting sauce makes the skin simply scrumptious), since eating bone-in leg quarters can be rather messy :)

So delicious!  I decided to bake boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut in half, in the oven at 375 degrees.  Only takes about 15 minutes to cook that way. Comes out juicy, tasty, and an easy crowd pleaser!

This was pretty good, and pretty easy. I did find it hard to keep the ingredients in the sauce mixed. It was like I had to keep stirring it. A good idea might be to marinade the chicken in the sauce a few hours before getting started on the cooking.

Excellent!  I served this chicken  with buttered rice and a fruit cocktail/w  sliced banana dish.  I could close my eyes and believe I was in a best Hawaii restaurant....on the beach. It was so easy too.

I made this tonight for my boyfriend and my 15 yr. old son. Boy did we all eat it up! I used 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, baked at 375 for 45 minutes basting and turning every 15 min. and then poured the juice out to save as a gravy and then broiled each side for like 3-5 minutes. Served it with wild rice. A new favorite at our house!

After reading the rave reviews, I was disappointed.  The skinless thighs came out gooey and chewy, and the broiling did not produce the lovely crust in the photos.

This was very good  and tasty. We needed a bit more salt though. But I prepared it as suggested but added a little mushrooms during the bsking process. Will do this again. Thanks

This is sooo easy and soo good!!  Just a few inexpensive ingredients and it comes out looking, smelling and tasting great!!  Next time I will line the pan with foil before I broil for easier clean up.  Thanks so much for this recipe, it is a great one!!

Excellent, I followed a reviewer's suggestion to bake it instead of only broil.  I baked at 350 for 35 minutes; basted halfway through and flipped the chicken.  Broiled for 5 min on each side basting each time.  It's a keeper!

Did not care for this very much. The broiling gave the garlic a bitter taste. Could of been my fault for cooking it a little to long.

I thought this was excellent.  Like some others, I cooked it at 375 for 45 minutes.  Also, due to not reading all the directions I just put everything in the pan with the chicken (including the stick of butter).  But the chicken came out very tender and delicious.

This certainly is easy and the taste is just average for me.  I rarely use chicken with the skin on but I did use the skin-on thighs as called for.  The skin was good and crispy and had nice flavor.  I did bake this for about 20 min first then  under the broiler for about 8 min on each side.  The thighs did not dry out at all.  Doubt I will make these again but it was enjoyed.

This was so yummy!  I used this recipe in a pinch when I unexpectedly didn't have all the ingredients for another recipe.  I used breast meat chicken tenders straight from the freezer, baked them on 375 for 45 minutes, and they came out fantastic!  Served with fettuccine alfredo and peas on the side; a perfect meal.  Thank you!

This was very simple to  make and very tasty. I did follow the advice of some of the other folks and baked the chicken for 45 minutes at 350 basting every 15 minutes.  I then broiled it for 3 minutes on each side.  I also added a slight bit of parmesan cheese to the marinade. The chicken was crispy on the outside but very moist. I will make this again for sure.

WE LOVED THIS! I USED 7 CLOVES OF FRESH GARLIC AND BAKED AT 350 FOR 45 MIN. I ALSO USED BONELESS SKINLESS BREASTS. THEY WERE VERY MOIST AND REMINDED US OF OUR FAVORITE TAKE OUT WINGS. NEXT TIME WILL TRY ADDING PARMESAN CHEESE. DEFINETLY A KEEPER!

Hmmmm...on a scale of 1-10, this was a 7.5.  Except for the outside of the chicken and the sides, it was rather bland, although tender and juicy.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts but other than that, followed the directions exactly.  I may try it again and double the butter/garlic/soy/parsley/pepper mixture so I have enough for a sauce to serve with the chicken.  I will also bake (as other reviewers have done) instead of broil...definitely makes for a very smokey house!

This recipe is great and simple. I cut back the garlic to 2 tbs instead of 3 (just personal preference) and baked it for 45 min at 375 like some other ppl suggested. I turned and basted the chicken in 15 intervals. Everyone loved it, especially my kids. Thanks :)

Loved it. I used just over half of the butter after reading comments. It was plenty but the extra was nice for the rice I served with it- white jasmine rice. I too used chic breats and baked for 30 at 375 and broiled for 10 mins at the end. Simple and delicious!!

As a variation, you can also cut up skinless chicken breasts and saute in the sauce.  
Serve with either brown rice or noodles.  Yummy!

I made this last night with 4 bone-in chicken thighs.  Like a previous review, I thought it was way too much butter and just omitted it, spraying the thighs lightly with Pam.  It worked really well and was still very moist and there was lots of juice off the chicken.  I thought we'd love it but unfortunately it was just OK.  Can't say as I'd be in a hurry to make it again because of the high fat and sodium content.

I use this as a basic marinade, but I add lime or lemon juice. I add an equal part of soy, lemon and butter and add about as much garlic as mentioned.  Thanks for the reminder that this can be used as a glaze as well.

My family LOVES this chicken. Everytime I make it I have to make extra because everyone wants seconds. Instead of putting it under the broiler I cook it for appr. 55 minutes on 400F, flipping halfway through. Thanks for the great recipe :)

very good & easy, I used skinless bone in chicken thighs and baked at 375 as suggested by other reviewers - looks good and tastes better!

I thought this was really good. It was moist and beautiful. I took the skin off and baked it for 40 min at 350 then broiled it for 5 min. It smells wonderful! Thanks for the recipe.

Very easy and tasty.  Marinated for 10 min while the grill heated.  Grilled for 40 - 50 min, skin nice and crispy.  Yum!  Thank you for sharing.

Oh, this was so good!!!  I used thighs and breasts and they were both yummy.  This recipe was easy and really flavorful.  I think next time I will use oil and cut the butter. I served this with rice. Thanks for this recipe.

This recipe got a positive score from three of the four family members... which is pretty hard to do! My 3 1/2 year old didn't care for it very much, even with the skin removed, but the chicken turned out tender and juicy, and it was easy to prepare.  Thanks!

I thought this was okay.  I made it per the recipe, though used chicken breasts instead of thighs.  There was nothing wrong with it, but it just wasn't anything exciting.  The flavours were okay -- I found it fairly mild so it would probably be good for kids.  It WAS easy, but I've made dishes just as easy that I liked better.

I used boneless breasts and I think I cooked a little too long it was slightly dry. I also used worshtishire sauce, I think next time I will use soy and inject the sauce inside the chicken. Great, quick recipe.

Pretty basic and everyday. For a cheap cut of meat, this is a mediocre good. Seems like tending to this chicken every 15 minutes to avoid garlic burning is too much work for the bland taste.

This was just okay. My husband liked it, but he's a big fried chicken fan. I thought it seemed like a lot of garlic at first, but since I'm not a skin fan I didn't really think it had too much of a garlic taste. I used bone-in chicken thighs and it took about 5-7 extra minutes. It was quick and easy. May make this again, but not rushing to share the recipe with anyone.

Wonderful! Definite keeper! Served it for dinner tonight for guests and everyone loved it. I did cook it at 375 for a little less than a hour but my chicken was still a bit frozen. Everything else, followed directions and it turned out great!

It tasted fine for me. Nothing to brag about. Really you could add just about any seasoning to this recipe to make it the flavor you like. It tasted exactly like the roasted chicken you can buy hot and ready from the grocery store. Next time I would like to try putting barbeque sauce on it or maybe even lemon pepper seasoning. It's very versital.

This chicken was very good and very simple to make! I baked mine in the oven as others suggested at 375 for at least 45 minutes because my chicken was pretty frozen when I prepared the dish, therefore I knew it would take longer to cook. However, I didn't change anything else and it turned out to be great! Will definitely make again on those nights I need something good and easy to make.

Great and very easy. My husband loved it and told me to save this recipe. My 1-yr-old and 4-yr-old both liked it also. I too baked at 375 for 30 min and then broiled for 5 min. Added sauteed mushrooms when it was cooked.

Great recipe. Used only chicken drumsticks. Turned and applied the extra marinade to the chicken several times while  broiling. Had to cook about 10 minutes longer. Made for a fabulous and flavorful dinner. Will definitely make again.

I broiled mine skin-on. It had a beautiful texture and color, but it lacked flavor. It needed salt and pepper, which I added, but still it was a little bland for my taste. Because I loved the color and texture (very crisp), I will continue to tweek it until I get what I want.

Delicious! I cooked the chicken thighs for about 45 mins but very yummy for a super easy dinner! I think this will definetly become a regular in our house.

Delicious, and really simple to make. My husband loved it and so did I. We made extra sauce to drizzle over potatoes served with the chicken. A keeper!

This really is a great recipe , not only is it VERY simple to prepare , but it really does taste like something you would go out to a restaurant to get !!! I'm really not a good cook at all and my chicken came out fabulously !!!! I did use large pieces of chicken to which I baked this dish at 375 for an hour instead of broiling and I also added mushrooms .... I think next time I make this I may try the mix not only as a sauce but a marinade also !!! Thank you for a great recipe !!!!!

Great recipe.  I, too, baked the chicken instead of broiling it.  The kids loved it too!

I also tried in oven and squized some lemon juice on top of it, it tasted really good. Thank you for the recipe.

This was alright, my chicken turned out a little dry, but it still had really good flavor! Definitely easy!

Delicious, quick and easy. I used chicken thighs with bones. Would definitely be better with boneless chicken as the recipe calls for. I baked my chicken with a quick 5 minute broil at the end for extra crisp. Turn out lovely.

I loved this and will add it to our menu!!  I didn't have parsley so I just omitted it.  I followed the directions for baking another person gave, and it was just delicious!!  Even the kids and in-laws raved!!

I cut the butter down to 2 tbls and added 2 tbls of olive oil.  I also only used 1 tbls of soy sauce which I think was just right- not too salty.  I baked skinless chicken thighs (bone in) at 375 for 30 minutes and they were fantastic!  My kids didn't care for it but I thought it was very good and easy to prepare.  Definately a keepr.

I baked this chicken for 45 min. at 375 degrees and used 1 1/2 tbsp. soya sauce and 1 1/2 tbsp. worchester sauce.  It was good, but not great.  If I make this recipe again I will add way more herbs and spices and use 1/2 the butter.

This was ok.  Definitely easy but I agree with others, something was definitely missing.

This is a great recipe & super easy to prepare. I needed to broil the chicken for about 10 minutes longer than the recipe says as it was not thouroughly cooked after only 20 minues. Delicious!!
