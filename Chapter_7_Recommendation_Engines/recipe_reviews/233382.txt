This recipe is missing a few key ingredients...I have been making this recipe for years, and my mom before me and her mom before her. With these changes, you will have  five star recipe.  Along with the mushroom soup (I use Golden Mushroom),  you also need 1 can of water and another can of some kind of cream soup (I use cream of celery). Mix the canned soups, water and rice together, pour into the bottom of a casserole dish, add chicken breasts on top (I use bone in breasts to keep them moist long enough for the rice to cook), sprinkle with the dry onion soup mix, cover and bake at 350 for an hour to an hour and 15 minutes. The end result is a "fix it and forget it" meal that my whole family (along with two picky kids) really enjoys.

This is similar to the one I've made for years. I use 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 can cream of chicken soup. Mix and spread on bottom of dish. sprinkle rice (1 cup or a bit more) on top. Add chicken pieces-one cut up chicken or your choice-top w/ 1 can french onion soup. Top w/ foil and bake 45 min. take off foil for last 15 min. Plenty of liquid to cook rice. Have not tried this one and am not criticizing it. Just see that lack of liquid could be an issue as others have mentioned.

My mom made this for over 40 years, it's one of my favorite dishes. I love the rice, so I double the ingredients for the rice.  Use 2 cups white rice, 2 cans cream of mushroom soup, 2 cans French Onion soup.  Place rice in dish prepared with spray, mix soup together in a bowl and mix into rice (this is what will cook the rice and prevent it from being dry)place chicken on top, season with salt, pepper, and paprika, cover, and bake at 350 degrees for 2 hours, uncovering the last half hour.  Never fails.

DON'T DO IT!!!  They left out key steps.  I'm really upset, nothing about adding additional water or anything to help cook the rice.  I was hoping for an easy fix it and forget it, but all I got was NOTHING for dinner and frustration.  Thanks for nothing.  I WILL NOT try this again.

I've made this dish for many years but with a few key differences. I use 1 can of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom Soup, 1 can of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom S,.,
.oup WITH garlic, 2 packages (not boxes) of Lipton Onion Soup Mix and I replace the water with Chicken broth. I cook the rice as directed on the package but instead of water I use the chicken broth, both soups and 1 package of the soup mix. Once the rice is close to complete I place it in a casserole dish or baking pan and arrange the chicken on top of it. I don't like crunchy rice so this works better for me. I add the rest of the ingredients over the chicken and let it cook until the chicken AND rice are fully cooked. When I reheat the leftovers I put a little butter in it and it's wonderful!!!

This recipe IS missing key ingredients -- some kind of liquid. The rice does not cook evenly, and the soups on top are not mixed into a nice sauce. Like another reviewer, it was inedible as written, and now the family is hungry and frustrated. Follow the advice of some other reviewers and add liquid and mix it with both the soup mix and the can of soup. I don't know how much to liquid to add, so check out some of the other reviewers who have been making this correctly for years, and try it that way. DON'T try it as written.

The chicken was thawed and I had the other ingredients. It sounded like an easy meal and it was. It took over an hour in the oven and the rice was hard around the edges ov the chicken and the soup just sat on top and didn't melt around. There was something left out of this recipe and that was probably some kind of liquid. Had I added some broth, it might have been OK but not great. This was more suited to a crock pot.

Well I gave the recipe a go and after the 15 minute uncovered period the rice was still hard and dry. I've added a cup of milk now and put it back in for another 15 minutes. We'll see if that helps any.
*****
So adding a cup of milk helped. I would suggest mixing the can of soup, onion soup mix and two cups of milk together and then pour all of that over the chicken and rice.

This recipe needs liquid! If you don't add liquid you end up with crunchy rice in mushroom soup leather.  I recommend 1 cup rice to 1 cup water. I mixed the water and soup together in a separate bowl and poured it over the chicken.  The juices released from raw chicken helped too. I followed the rest of the recipe  as written. Even with the extra step, this is a very quick prep and very tasty.

I didn't actually use this exact recipe. I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom soup because no one in my family likes mushrooms. I put the soup in a bowl and then filled the empty can with water and added that to the soup. I filled it again, but only halfway, with water and added that to the soup. I whisked together the water and soup and set it aside. I put one cup of uncooked rice on the bottom of a casserole dish and then arranged the chicken, which I had cut into cubes on top of the rice. I poured my soul mixture over the rice and chicken and then sprinkled the onion soup mix (1 package) all over the top. I covered it with tinfoil and baked it at 375? for an hour.

So to be fair, I added 1 1/2 cans of water to this and cooked it an additional 15 minutes. However, some of the rice (more than just a little.... ) was still uncooked. I also added a layer of shredded cheese.  The flavors were great, but the rice ruined it for us. I will try it again, but maybe use pre-cooked rice next time.

Took advice from other reviews. 1 can golden mushroom, 1 can cream of celery w/ 1 can water together. Pour and add rice. Seared chicken breasts first to brown outside and hold in moisture. Add on top of soup & rice mix. Add fresh garlic, onion, pepper, paprika, parsley and monetary chicken seasoning ( mrs dash works too) to the top of chicken. Cover w/ foil and bake. Add veggies of your choice during last 15 min.

I also agree that it is  missing a few ingredients , the rice came out not cooked, chicken done too much and soup did not do the usual cooking and glazing over the rest of the dish, and tried it a second time adding a few things and still ended up rice to dry not tasting very good

I too realized that there was way too little liquid here to properly hydrate the rice, so I added a cup of chicken broth midway through the baking and it was still dry in the end. Also the French onion soup mix made it quite salty. I wouldn't make this again without using some of the suggestions from other reviewers.
