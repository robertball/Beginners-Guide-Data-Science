Oh my yummy goodness...  I could get into trouble with this drink.  I wouldn't change anything in this recipe.  It was delicious!  Right about now I wish I had a Vitamix.

This was good, but it needed a few tweaks for my taste. I made half a recipe first as stated, except I used 1 cup of coffee ice cubes instead of instant coffee, which worked great. I then made a second half batch and used less sugar, more Nutella and less milk. This one came out fantastic. I put whipped cream on top and sprinkled on cocoa powder.

Quite good.  It was a little too sweet for me, but that can be easily corrected by reducing the sugar.  For a thicker shake, add 2 tablespoons of instant pudding mix (I used vanilla) and wait a few minutes for it to thicken.

I make this every day. I just love it. instead of making it in a big blender I use an individual Ninja blender cup. I then cut the recipe in half and add a little bit more milk.

I've made this 6-7 times in the past 2 weeks.  The first time I made exactly as written although I thought the amount of sugar was excessive (which is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5).  I don't have a super-duper blender so there were a couple of smaller ice chunks.  It was thick and slushy.  Flavor good.  I particularly like that it uses instant coffee as my mother had stocked up on instant coffee before she died.  I don't drink instant so have been looking for recipes that use it.   The second time I used water instead of ice (according to internet research, two cups of ice melted = slightly less than 2 c. water).  It didn't have the thickness of using the ice.  I have also used frozen fruit (raspberries, strawberries) in place of the ice.  The drink is still plenty cold and tastes good (and  one gets the benefit of additional fiber and vitamins, etc.).  I have gradually decreased the sugar to zero and there doesn't seem to be any appreciable difference in the flavor.

FANTASTIC & then some.  We've had a few of these now & you can do so much more. We've drizzled carmel, you could do fudge or choc, whip cream, broken up candy bar (snickers, etc) choc chips, or ice cream.  It is just endless the possibilities.  I've given recipe to others already. The one thing I don't understand is why so much vanilla, but since I make my own (from this website I believe) it doesn't cost me much.  No more getting anything like this at the coffee shops cause we can do our own now but better.

After reading reviews, I cut back by half on the sugar (good call), and it was still plenty sweet for me. I also cut the amount of vanilla in half. I used almond milk and decaf coffee granules. The drink came out liquidy, as opposed to a thick smoothie. Icy crystals settled to the top in the glass, but after mixing, it turned out a little thicker. I enjoyed this mocha-tasting drink!

I used dark chocolate spread, thick coconut milk in place of milk  and put in the 3 teaspoons of instant coffee.  It came out too strong.  If I make it again, I will cut down to 1/2 or 1 teaspoon of instant coffee.  It's perfect as a cold summer treat.

This is an absolute hit in our house.  I made it several times with the only change of using 1tsp vanilla powder instead of the extract.  It is perfect.

Delicious! However I couldn't stand the smell or taste of Vanilla extract, so the 2nd, 3rd, 10th time I've made it, the extract was omitted. Same Chocolatey/coffee taste, no smell of alcohol! My husband who is not a coffee drinker, asks for this every other day now!!! Very delicious!!!
