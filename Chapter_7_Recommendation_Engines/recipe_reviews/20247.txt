I loved this recipe. It is a great, refreshing summer dessert. I used a little extra lemon juice (close to 4 tablespoons) and thought the pie was the perfect balance of sweet and tart. I also used reduced fat cream cheese and sweetened condensed milk, and the recipe turned out well. Note: I never make non-instant pudding and did not realize that it requires the addition of sugar and egg yolks (at least the brand I made did). I am so used to making instant pudding and just adding milk, make sure to have any necessary pudding ingredients on hand. Also, the recipe makes a lot of filling. My market offers larger graham crusts, ten servings instead of the regular eight. I would get that next time.

After reading other reviews, I used a 10 serving size pie crust and the filling amount was just perfect, added one extra tbls. of lemon juice but will add even more next time. Make sure your cream cheese is room temp. and it will mix in easily with a wire whip. This pie needs at the very least 4 hrs. to set up and even then mine wasn't real cold. I will plan ahead next time so it can chill overnight. YUMMY!!!

Being calorie conscious, I used a Keebler low fat graham crust, low fat cream cheese and low calorie condensed milk.  It was delicious and not as loaded with calories so I didn't feel guilty having more than one slice!

Whoo-hoo! First time ever making lemon pie--you guys are going to turn me into a baker, yet!  I got the 10-serving pie shell and (oops!) 2-pkgs of 2.9 oz pudding, so I used 1-1/2 pkgs. Really important to cook the pudding until it is super thick and boiling. I used about 1 tsp of zest while stirring the pudding, and 4-1/2 Tbsp of fresh lemon juice for the stir-in. Having the crm cheese at room temp was a great suggestion and I ended up using about 3/4 of the can of cond milk. Chilled overnight, this pie set up really well. It was devoured in under 5 minutes--it took me longer to serve it than it took my family to eat it! Kids loved this, too :-)Next time I will use reg whipping cream instead of cool whip, as I never defrost that stuff the right way. The pie is actually superb without any topping at all. It was a great wrap up to our Memorial Day BBQ.

I love this pie. The first time I made it as written and it was good. The amount of tartness and lemon flavor is personal, fortunately this recipe works if you add extra lemon juice.

I loved the hints from a previous reviewers: Bring the pudding to a full boil, cubing/softening the cream cheese, and mixing in some of the thawed topping. 

The second time I made an altered recipe. I used two (2.9oz) packages instead of one large (4.3oz) package. While the pudding was thickened but still boiling hot I took it completely off the stove (instead of turning the heat to low) and add the softened and cubed cream cheese mixing it in with a hand mixer. I added an extra 4 ounces (making a total of 12oz) of cream cheese which made it so  creamy delicious. I added more lemon juice for a total of 1 cup of lemon juice. After the condensed milk and lemon juice were mixed in, I added one (8oz) container of completely thawed whipped topping. I used a hand mixer to get everything completely mixed together. After pouring the filling into the graham cracker pie crusts and refrigerating, the pies were set in less than an hour. When ready to serve I topped with additional thawed whipped topping.

The additional cream cheese, lemon juice and whipped topping made enough filling for three purchased graham cracker crusts. Like the first pie, made with the original directions, these pies set up beautifully and have the perfect texture and lemony tartness I crave.

What a great summer recipe! I used a baked pastry shell, fat free condensed milk and 1/3 less fat cream cheese. I followed the directions exactly as written. It turned out perfect! Thank you "momof3" for the tip about putting it in the freezer for an hour before placing it in the refrigerator. I'll be making this a lot!!

I couldn't find the large size lemon pudding at either store I looked, so I had to wing it with 1 1/2 boxes of the small kind. I was concerned that the consistency wouldn't turn out right, but it turned out perfectly (made the necessary adjustments w/the ingred. called for to make the pudding.)A great treat in the sweltering heat!

Nothing but compliments. I was doubtful of this recipe, but tried it anyway at Thanksgiving. Everyone LOVED it...It was the surprise hit of the Dessert table. Instead of graham cracker crust,  I used a ready made flour crust...BEAUTIFUL.

I thought this pie was just ok.  Mine didn't set at all and so I wasn't able to cut it into peices. It had a decent flavor but I thought it needed more "tart" taste to it.  Would make a good pudding though.  Thanks anyway.

This is a good basic recipe but I make a variation of this pie because there are three diabetics in my family. Myself included. I use the sugar-free instant lemon pudding and pie filling......2 boxes. I make the pudding according to directions and then add about 12 ounces of softened cream cheese. I beat it until it's well mixed and pour it into a graham cracker crust which I've made with the baking Splenda. There's a lot of filling and you can put the extra in cups and serve it just like that. There is no baking or boiling involved and best of all it's a great diabetic dessert.

I thought this recipe was great on its own, however, for company, I decided to use a refrigerated pie crust that I baked before filling.  I made it the day before so the pie would have plenty of time to "set".  The next day I made raspberry sauce (from this site) and once that was cooled and thickened, I spread it on the pie and refrigerated until just before I was ready to serve it.  I made my own whipped cream using heavy cream, spread that on top and garnished with fresh raspberries and mint leaves (for color).  Oh my, the 2 flavors of lemon and raspberry blended beautifully.  Everyone raved about the dessert, including my husband who was never a fan of lemon pie.  I forgot to mention I had the smaller pudding boxes and ended up using 3, but doubling the rest of the ingredients, as I wanted extra filling to make parfaits for my gluten free family members.  Thanks for posting a wonderful recipe I will definitely make again!

This is my second time making this pie and I sure hope it comes out better than the first time. My first shot at making it was not so good because I had a hard time with getting the cream cheese to mix in well, and I found it to be a little too sweet for my liking. This time I followed another reviewer's advice and cubed and softened the cream cheese. I also cut the sugar but not too much. I also added another tablespoon of lemon juice. The mixture tasted fantastic! I'm waiting for it to set right. One thing is that I have a lot of leftover filling. I couldn't find a 4.3oz pudding package, so I used two 2.9oz packages. I'm not sure if that's the reason I have so much leftover. I refuse to let it go to waste, so now I'm about to find another way to use it!

This is a fabulous pie.  The key is to cut the cream cheese into cubes and bring to room temp before wisking into hot pudding.  THEN... add the condensed milk and lemon juice this way you don't cool off the pudding before adding the cream cheese.  I made this with a from scratch graham cracker crust for Easter and everyone raved and asked for the recipe.  It was just perfect!!!

Yummy! I did add an extra tablespoon of lemon juice and also added lemon zest in the filling for more zing. Make sure you use the pie directions and not the pudding directions on the box when preparing the pie filling or it might be too thin for your liking. To make the cream cheese blend a bit easier soften it to room temperature, cut it into 1" cubes and then stir in. This is just personal preference, but I don't like the taste of cool-whip, so I use Reddi-whip instead. But you have to add this on the pie slices as you serve them so it doesn't 'deflate' on the pie. And lastly, the second time I made it, I used a pre-cooked and cooled pie dough crust - more work of course, but super yummy too!

We loved this! It does take quite a while to set up, so I suggest making it the night before. As other reviews stated there was extra filling, so I filled the mini graham pie cups for the kids and they loved it. Great recipe, thanks!

Very good recipe.  Have made it several times but never rated it before.   Plan to make it again for Easter.  I make it the night before and never have trouble with it setting up.  I don't use Cool Whip.  I prefer a dollop of fresh whipped cream on each piece I serve.

This recipe while delicious, was not as quick & easy as the title says.  After making the pudding, you have to melt the cream cheese into the pudding which takes quite awhile.  It would probably help to soften the cream cheese in the microwave for 10 sec before adding it to the pudding.  It took a good 1/2 hr to put this pie together and then it it had to set in the refrigerator overnight to cool and set before I could put the cool whip on.  Yes, I will make it again, because I did get some really good compliments on it.  I did cut the calories by using lo-cal sweetened cond. milk.  Instead of the graham cracker crust, I used the cookie crust which I think made the pie even better!

Tastes very refreshing, but it never set up for me.  On the suggestion of other cooks, I put the pie in the freezer for some time, but when it came out the filling just ran all over the place.    Maybe the pie filling would be better chilled in parfait glasses.

Myself and my family members all loved this pie!  I made it for a BBQ over the weekend and there wasn't a crumb left!  The only thing I would suggest is using soft cream cheese instead of a block because the block doesn't melt down smoothly in the pie.  It still tasted great though and I will definitely be making this again and again!

Wonderful recipe!  Very very creamy.  The filling is pretty tart as is but next time I will "tart it up" even more by adding lemon zest.

This recipe is GREAT.  The only thing I did differently was to make my own cracker crust and to add 1 tbsp of lemon juice.  It was easy and quick and set up *perfectly*. Every piece came out cleanly, even the first!  And the lemon flavour is delicious and refreshing, nice and creamy. I'll make this again!  Thank you!

LOVED IT!!  It was so yummy and very filling and easy to make.  I let it refrigerate for about 4 hours before serving and it set up fine.  But, I did notice the next day it had set up even more.  When I make again I will let refrigerate overnight.  Even my husband who doesn't like lemon ate two slices. Thanks!

I made this for Easter dinner. It was a huge hit. Everyone really enjoyed it. I folded in about half of the Cool Whip. Then topped the pie with the rest. Let the pudding mixture cool before adding Cool Whip. I topped the pie with sliced strawberries and lemon zest. There was extra pie filling left over so I put it in dessert dishes as a parfait.

This wasn't all that quick (it does take a few minutes to cook the pudding) but it was relatively so, and definitely easy and good.  My children (ages 6, 5, and 3) loved it.

Excellent pie.  However, I did have to add more lemon juice - probably 1/3 c. in all.  Next time I'll add some lemon zest as well.  Great idea by at least one reviewer to cube the cream cheese - worked perfectly.  I used a regular flour pastry that I had made - I much prefer the crisp pastry with the creaminess of the filling.  I used whipped cream rather than Cool Whip and folded some of it into the cooled filling.  The quantity easily filled two whole pies.  I'll be making this again for sure.  All our guests loved it.

I forgot the lemon juice.  I didn't have any trouble with it setting.  I did make sure to cook the pudding for a very long time, until it was very thick and boiling.    it tastes excellent and was easy (all but for the pudding making part - that's a chore).

I loved this pie! I don't even like lemon much but I made it for my husband. I decided to try a piece and it was delicious!! It's a very creamy lemon flavor instead of a sharp sour lemon like some lemon pie tends to be. Will definitely make again!!!

My pie turned out to have the consistency of a thick soup.  I couldn't slice it without it "growing" back together after 2 hours of being in the fridge...it also tastes very corn-starchy, but I think that's from the pudding mix.

I used My T Fine pudding which added egg yolks, sugar, and water to its pudding mixture and added whole milk instead of water.  It is the best  cheesecake pudding pie.. Will make it all the time.  Serve with whip cream.

Good flavor, but the texture was really odd, and the recipe made WAY too much filling for one pie shell.

I added more lemon juice. Flavor was good, mine didn't set so well. I should have let it boil a min. or 2 longer. and  should have left it in the fridge longer. Prob. won't make this one again.

So easy and delicious!!  I followed the other reviewers' tips and added the extra Tbsp of lemon juice and used the 10" crust which fills to the brim.  My whole family dived in!  Will be making again soon.

I have no idea what I did wrong.....18 hours later it is still liquid, never set!
It has a wonderful flavor, but it is like a creamy lemon drink!  Maybe I used a little more than 1/2can cond. milk, and less sugar because I don't like things too sweet...but that shouldn't have prevented it from setting.  I even started by keeping it in the freezer for 3 hours! If anyone had a suggestion I will try again

This was great, and easy. I halved three lemons, because they were small, thinking I would need them, and they have me half a cup of juice. So I used it all, and the whole can of sweetened condensed milk. Topped with cool whip. Next time I'll try with real whipped cream. Definitely needs the bigger pie shell.

Between a pudding pie and a cream cheese pie.  Very good.   Be sure to cook pudding per pie instructions.  Add more lemon juice and zest and about half of the cool whip added gives pie a lighter texture.  A little labor intensive but well worth it
