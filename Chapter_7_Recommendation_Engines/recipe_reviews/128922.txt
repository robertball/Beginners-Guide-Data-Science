Excellent! I made it exactly as stated, except (of course) I put the bacon in at the same time I added the mushrooms and onions. It was the most popular dish at the feast, and I'll definitely put this on our Thanksgiving tradition list.

I made this for Thanksgiving. I have been looking and trying different stuffings and everybody loved it. I will probably mess around with some of the ingredients. Thank you for the recipe

This year I was in charge of the Oyster Stuffing. My mother in law usually makes it, so I was a little nervous. Let me tell you that this recipe is PHENOMENAL! I made exactly according to the instructions, but I actually used a little bit more bacon and oysters. I will definitely be making again.

It came out great ..., brought back memories of the dressing my mother made years ago.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. I'm not a stuffing fan but this was delish!! I used smoked oysters and chopped the onion instead of sliced. This is a keeper for next year!!
