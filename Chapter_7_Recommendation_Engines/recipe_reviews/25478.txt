I have done this recipe the following way:  Spray heavy duty aluminum foil with cooking spray.  Slice onions, cube new potatoes, add all or any of the following: carrot chunks, green pepper slices, broccoli, green beans, zucchini.  Sprinkle some Dry Good Seasons Italian Dressing Mix over all and add liquid Italian Dressing over all.  Wrap up and place on grill, 15 minutes each side.  Enjoy!

I have made a recipe very similar to this. I use red skin potatoes cut into small pieces. With fresh broccoli,fresh cauliflower, zucchini, sweet onions. I top with a bit of butter, and drizzle with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, garlic and sprinkle a little Italian herb seasoning(Tones). I make huge veggie packets because I want lots left over. Carrots are really good in it too. My husband flips the packets halfway through cooking so  to cook evenly on both sides. They get roasted and yummy. My favorite way to do veggies. I thought I could achieve the same thing by doing the packets in the oven but they don't come out as good. Definately grill! I bet it would be good with corn in it too, either small cut up ears of corn or kernels. Yum!

Very good!  This recipe was extremely easy to do.  Make sure you get good produce and use fresh string beans, fresh rosemary, and fresh thyme.  The sweet potatoes were delicious and I normally don't eat them!  I do have to say though, I disagree with the amount of sweet potato in the recipe, use more, trust me.  Grilling was a cinch, I even kept it on the upper rack in the grill and they cooked thoroughly no problem.  The family loved it.

Definitely needs a greater variety of veggies.  Just add whatever you like such as carrots, celery, garlic, squash and cook as directed.

I love the mixture of flavors in this recipe, i have even used the ingredients and baked them in the oven in a glass baking dish and served as a side with salmon.  It's delightful!

The potatoes came out tender and moist.  While I didn't have any green beans, I did have the rest of the ingredients and it was a success. A very easy way to have potatoes in the summertime when it too hot to bake them.

These were so good! We often make a similar recipe with just potatoes & sweet potatoes.  I love grean beans, but questioned how well they would cook and taste with the potatoes. They were my favourite part!  The fresh herbs add a wonderful subtle flavour.  Will make again and again.

We are not sweet potato fans, so I just adjusted to compensate with more new potatoes.  This was so delicious, a fine accompaniment to our grilled steak.  The fresh herbs, I think, make all the difference, as do the sweet Vidalia onions.  Next time I may add some minced garlic, although this was perfectly delicious without.

Very easy.  I didnÂ´t use sweet potatoes. Sliced the potatoes on the food processor, perfectly thin slices, it was a hit at a BBQ party.  Thans

This was delicious and easy! I used a potato, white onion, green beans, salt, pepper, thyme, and basil (I didn't come back to read the ingredients!) and it turned out lovely! I only drizzled some olive oil and tossed the ingredients together. Thank you for this easy and versatile recipe! I might add carrots next time :D

Great dish for camping if you prepare ahead. I parboiled potatoes & green beans, then added raw onion, zucchini, red pepper, and yellow squash.

My family loves this recipe. We have made it too many times to count.  It is great in the summer when you don't want to heat up the kitchen.  Also, it is easy to customize each individual packet based on each diner's likes and dislikes.  I've followed the recipe exactly and have modified it based on what I have on hand. Awesome recipe and the cooking time is usually 30 - 40 minutes on medium high heat.  It is VERY important to turn the packets over at least once because if you don't the olive oil will burn the potatoes to the bottom :)

Used a shallow casserole dish instead of foil and baked uncovered. Mixed 1/2 can (or to taste) of french fried onions with 1/2 cup finely shreaded Parmesan cheese and about half way through sprinkled on top of the veges. WOW!!!  Not the lowest in calories but the taste got rave reviews.

An okay basic recipe that is easy to adapt to you own needs. We didn't like the sweet potatoes so we picked them out and gave them to our three year old. He liked them. :o) We had no problems with sticking, and the whole thing was easy to prepare. I liked someone's idea of adding zuccini and carrots and stuff. I think next time we will do that instead of the sweet potatoes.

Made these tonight and it was a hit. The flavor was amazing. I just used regular potatoes, sweet potatoes, vidalia onion, red and yellow bell pepper. A great side with almost any main dish.

This is my new favorite way to cook veggies.  I spread EVOO on the foil and put a cup of veggies on top.  I sprinkle different herbs, such as rosemary, garlic, and thyme, and the cook on the grill.  They turn out great!

This was so good I would rate it even higher if I could!  I put everything in one big tinfoil packet and followed the recipe exactly.  It didn't seem like the amount of rosemary and thyme would be enough, but it was perfect!  I couldn't stop eating it even while I was putting away the leftovers :))

I've made this a few times and cannot believe how delicious the potatoes and veggies come out!!!  Especially the ones that get a little charred.  SO delicious!!!!  I follow exactly but also add sliced carrots and  used lemon herb seasonings.  Even my kids chowed this down!

These were easy and tasted great.  Ran out of room on grill,  so used oven set at 375...I didn't use potatoes,  but everything else was good.  Even my 2 year old ate it up!  Will make again.

The picture shows yams, sweet potatoes are white/yellow.  I used sweet potatoes like the recipe called for.  We ran out of room on the grill, so I stuck my packets in the oven at 375 right on the rack for 45 minutes.  
This recipe went great with the fresh trout foil packets we served from the grill!

Enjoyable. Very fresh dish! I only had green beans and potatoes and it was awesome. I put a dash of Worcestershire sauce in it as well. I used a ground rosemary/garlic blend I found in my grocery store. Husband liked it. That speaks volumes, he used to hide peas in his cheeks as a child because he does NOT like veggies! Will make again.

This is a very tasty side dish.  You can't go wrong!  I used Idaho's rather than red and it was quite nice on the grill.  My whole family enjoyed and I will do these again in the near future.

Made this for July 4th and everyone enjoyed it so much!  MAKE SURE you really use a lot of oil so it doesn't stick.  It's not low fat but will be much easier!

Due to grill space I cooked these in a Reynolds Foil Bag in the oven.  It might have lost some of its character because of that but it was still very good.  My husband really enjoyed them!

I made the recipe mostly as written, and it was very good. I'm excited about the different permutations of vegetables and herbs I hope to try in the future. One change I made was to use chopped thyme and rosemary instead of the sprigs, and I used about 4x as much as called for. Excellent!

As a kid, my mom did veggies in a foil wrapper over the fire, and this was a modern day version of my mom's recipe. Thanks for sharing!  I used summer veggies, Vidalias, zuchini, summer squash, and green beans. this would work for any combo. I ended up baking these packs in the oven, and they were perfect. 
8/26/11: Although the recipe calls for us to put the veggies into foil packets, I roasted the veggies on a cookie sheet for 25 minutes, stirring a couple times. This let the veggies carmelize.Really wonderful!

The only thing I omitted was the sweet potato since I didn't have any.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as is and the veggies were delicious!  Will be adding this recipe to the rotation.

I can't say enough good things about this recipe, it is absolutely delicious. Like others said, you can just add whatever veggies you have on hand to suit your taste as well as whatever fresh herbs you like. I used the veggies listed in the recipe as well as carrots and zucchini and I also added some fresh basil. This is going to be a regular for us during grilling season.

I used a bag to shake the cut veg, herbs and olive oil in before cooking, that also worked really well.  I've cooked this recipe on the grill and in the oven too when you use the oven if you have a veg with a high water content then you will have to open the packets at the end of cooking to let out some moisture just for a few minutes. I too have used a variety of veg including zucchini, mushrooms, carrots, parsnips and leeks, they all work well and taste great, thanks for a great idea.

My first try at making grilled veggies and they were divine!  Followed the recipe exactly, with the addition of half a diced red pepper. We like the crispy veggies that are closest to the foil, so we made two packets and used large pieces of foil for more surface area and spread out veggies in as few layers as possible.  The sweet potatoes were awesome!  Herbs were subtle and perfect.

What a great veggie dish for grilling! I love being able to use sweet potatoes because they are better for me than plain white. I scaled this way down for two, and obmitted the white potato which would've been too much for us anyway. Next time I'm going to add carrots and asparagus to this, and probably not use the green beans unless I get some great fresh ones.

Everyone thought this was good-especially the sweet potato. The only thing I'd change would be the rosemary and thyme. Maybe a light seasoned salt would taste better than the two herbs. I'll definitely fix this again- with zucchini or asparagus.

Extremely delicious!! It was a huge hit!! I chopped up a potato, some celery, various peppers, an onion, and some fresh broccoli. I stirred it in a large bowl with some olive oil, Italian seasoning, and garlic powder. I sprayed the foil with non-stick cooking spray and used at least three layers of foil per packet. They were perfectly done in 30 minutes (15 on each side). They slid right off of the foil when usually we have to scrape off every piece. I would definitely recommend trying this recipe!!

Followed recipe, but cut the vegetables into larger slices and left green beans longer, 1 inch seemed a bit small. Cooked in the barbecue on the rack at the top of the oven to get more heat and keep the veggies from burning. Everything turned put perfectly, not bland at all and the fresh herbs flavor infused into all items nicely. Used spray olive oil as necessary reducing the amount needed. Will definitely make again, everyone loved this recipe and commented positively on it. Thank you Marni!

Very good. We skipped on the new potatoes in favor of more sweet potatoes. We mixed all the veggies up in a large bowl then drizzled with olive oil, garlic power, salt, pepper & Italian seasoning. Served with steak. Thanks for the recipe.    Edit: Decided to liven up the leftovers for lunch today. Added a few slices of torn salami & reheated in the microwave. When it was heated through I added a handful of shredded mozzarella cheese which melted on contact. Was SUPER tasty!

These were delicious! I didn't exactly follow the measurements, but basically did all the same things as the recipe stated & used the same ingredients. I don't really like sweet potatoes, but love sweet potato chips, so I sliced the sweet potato really really thin so that they would get crispy and they turned out great. Definitely follow the recipes suggestion to put into small individual size foil packets...I made two small ones for my husband & I and then put the rest of the veggies in one large packet & the small ones came out way better. Will definitely be making these a lot in the upcoming grilling months!!

Bam these were good.  Such a great taste to go along with Barbecue.  Add carrots for an enhanced flavor.  And not too many onions.  I will definitely make this again.

We thought this was OK but didn't care for the sweet potato in the mix.  I will make again leaving out the sweet potato, add some minced garlic then when done, will sprinkle with a three cheese blend from my local deli.

I modified the vegetables and this was really good.  I ended up burning one side, it's hard when you can't see what you are doing!  I will try again.  It was a fun and tasty recipe.

I added a bunch of garlic as well, making the packet so fragrant. 
Thanks for sharing

This was easy and incredible!  We added sliced squash and carrots. Flavor was great using the fresh rosemary and thyme. Didn't need to keep on the grill for 30 minutes though, 22-25 would have done it. Thanks for this keeper!

This is a great way to use nutrient rich sweet potatoes. I used red potatoes with their skins and regular yellow onions.  Delicious!

I've made this recipe three times since I found it two weeks ago!  Just wonderful!  I recommend using fresh herbs, really makes a difference and herbs are so easy to grow!  Going to make this again this weekend and will be trying carrots in it, I bet they will be great!

Great taste and easy to make.  Watching the timing on the grill so you don't burn the veggies.  Next time I am adding baby corn.

We made this recipe over a campfire and it was a big hit.  The roasted sweet potatoes were a great alternative to regular roasted veggies.

I used the same seasonings, but different vegetables (onion, sweet peppers and potatoes).  Very, very good, easy, and I will use this time and time again!

This is my fall camping standby.  I can prep the foil packets (one for each person) and then place them all in a ziplock bag in the cooler to be taken out and put on the grill/fire when the time is right.  I usually throw in any fresh or dried herbs I have around.  This definitely makes me look like a campfire gourmet.

I used this recipe as a base.  I didn't use potatoes.  I used zucchini, onions, tomatoes, corn, garlic along with the evoo, rosemerry, thyme, s & p.  I used heavy duty foil so it didn't need 2-3 layers.  Was tastey.

This is such an amazing veggie choice for dinner.  I have made this for several people and none of them have tasted a mix like this before! We even made it for Thanksgiving last year.
