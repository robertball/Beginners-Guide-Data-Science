WOW! This shake is delicious!  I'm a big fan!  The taste is very similar to your peanut butter banana shake but better.  The ingredients in this shake all pack a punch, from the flaxseed (with good Omega 3s and fiber) to the wheat germ (which is a good source of magnesium, zinc, thiamin, folate, potassium, phosphorus, and vitamin E).  The Tahini is also one of the best sources of calcium, high in vitamin E, B B1, B2, B3, B5 and B15.

This is easily my go to breakfast shake.  I'd have it every morning if I could, and I know that it's filled with all the healthy stuff, without it tasting healthy.  A great shake!

I made this for my son and was a little hesitant about the tahini but he tried it and said "thanks for the protein shake mom"...without me telling him it was a protein shake:)
