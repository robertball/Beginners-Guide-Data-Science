Well...I can't really rate this accurately, since I only really tried the glaze. I just couldn't justify using that much pricey pomegranate juice in the brine. I ended up making a brine using two cups of kosher salt in 8 quarts of water. (I used two cups of boiling water to dissolve the salt and about a quarter of a cup of pomegranate molasses, for some sweetness; then added the remaining cold water.) I made an herb butter using the dried herbs and rubbed it under the turkey's skin and on the outside of the bird as well. I made the glaze as directed, but brushed it on the turkey a couple of times when it was nearly done roasting (at about 150 degrees). The downside of this was, the sugary drippings burned, so I didn't use the pan drippings in my gravy. The plus side was a gorgeously sticky caramelized exterior, with a sweet-tart flavor. All in all, very festive.

This is WONDERFUL!! You do have to follow the recipe exactly, but it's more than worth the extra cost and time. I seed my own poms, so it's not quite so bad. Everyone wants to know when "we" are going to do this again!!  ibabaker

very beautiful recipe. the turkey turned out perfectly moist. simple preparation that made all the difference in my turkey. the only difference was instead of doing a dry rub, i mixed the spices for the rub with butter and rubbed this under the skin, larding the turkey. 

i prepared this with the awesome cranberry, apple and sausage stuffing recipe also on this site.

I used this recipe for my turkey for Christmas dinner. I have never had such a moist turkey in my nearly fifty years of marriage. Everyone loved it. I just could not get over how wonderful it was.
