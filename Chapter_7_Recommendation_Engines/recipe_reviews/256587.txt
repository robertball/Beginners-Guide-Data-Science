I didn't have nausea or an upset stomach; I just wanted something tasty. I used the only black tea in the house. It was a blend of black tea, cinnamon, orange peel, and cloves. I let it steep in the hot ginger ale for 5 minutes, and it tasted exactly like a delicious spiced tea or Russian tea. I would never have thought to let tea steep in ginger ale. Thanks, tcasa, for this delicious tea recipe!

Always have used heated Vernors for upset tummy but adding black tea to the brew is a delightful twist. I only used 6 oz of the soda and seeped my tea longer then normal, then sat and enjoyed a quiet moment with my tea and cookies.

This is quite interesting. It does seem to calm an upset stomach. It is quite sweet, but I guess that depends on the ginger ale you use. I warmed the ginger ale on the stovetop instead of microwaving it. Thank you for the recipe.

I really liked this. I only used 1/2 can (6 ounces) of ginger ale and that was perfect for me. I think a full can would have made it too sweet for my liking. I also did not have an upset stomach so I recommend using the whole can of ginger ale if you are using it for that purpose.
