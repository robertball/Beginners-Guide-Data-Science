Super easy and delicious too!  The Unwrap & Roll Mozzarella was very easy to work with and held up nicely when rolled.  I would definitely make again- especially since this recipe works with my husband's low carb diet!

It was really good, but personally I really like my sandwiches with bread.  My mom really liked it, even without the bread since she's on a low-carb diet.  We added some mayo on them too, but they're good without as well.
