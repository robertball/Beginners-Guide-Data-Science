Excellent.  May 2017/   I used liquid ginger, fresh garlic, fresh lemon zest, and white sugar and cinnamon.  I was only making a small dinner for two, so I had one large breast and put all ingredients in a small crock after pouring the butter mixture over the veggies.  I then sliced some lemon for on top of the ingredients.  Fabulous!
 November 13, 2017: I made this again and used two chicken breasts, fresh ginger, garlic, zest and made my own butter mixture with brown sugar, cinnamon etc.  AGAIN, FABULOUS RECIPE!

My wife said "it's your turn to make dinner" . This recipe was  simple to make and the family  liked it!!   Adding this recipe to my arsenal list. I just used plain butter and ground ginger as did not have fresh. Cheers.
