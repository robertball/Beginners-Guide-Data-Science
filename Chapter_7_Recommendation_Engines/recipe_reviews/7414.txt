If I make this cake again, I will mix in the eggs, then gently stir in the cherry pie filling.  I added the cherries and eggs together which caused the cherries to break up.  Would have more flavor if the cherries were in bigger pieces.

Made this cake twice and got much better results when I sifted the cake mix to eliminate lumps, slightly beat the eggs before combining with other ingredients, and substituted cherry extract for almond extract.  Fast, easy and delicious.

KEEPER!  another reason to buy cake mixes and pie filling when on sale.  I am more of a 'from scratch' person but am finding wonderful recipes here by embellishing on mixes.  I had a can of blueberry pie filling I've been pushing out of the way forever.  Used a CLASSIC WHITE mix and BLUEBERRY filling.  used VANILLA EXTRACT instead of almond, and added 1/2 of LEMON'S ZEST to batter, as well as a handful of huge frozen blueberries. Don't be afraid of the batter.  It reminded me of a bed I made once in nursing school whereby you had to be able to bounce a quarter off it...very strange batter...spongy; bouncy..baked for 32 min in a bundt pan.  For frosting I halved the recipe and used WHITE CHOCOLATE CHIPS in lieu of the chocolate and added the remaining LEMON ZEST from the lemon....absolute perfection.  Due to less surface area, it was perfect to halve the frosting recipe for bundt.  I didn't taste the cake but the frosting is to die for...taking this to the dog groomer and she will love it coming from a little Shitzhu and Lhasa.

This recipe is very rich and moist.  The frosting was too much for the whole cake. I would make the cake again but cut the amout of frosting in half.

This cake tuned out so good.  It turns out very rich and moist.  Plus, there are different combinations of flavors that are possible.  For example, I used apple pie filling and white cake mix with some cinnamon after making the cherry one.

I used a 9-inch bundt pan, baked it for 38 minutes. Came out perfect! I made the frosting as written and it compliments the cake nicely. I do agree with alot of others that the frosting can be cut in half. I had enough to frost two cakes. Great recipe.

I've made this a couple of times with the satiny chocolate glaze as suggested in another review.  It has turned out great.  I always try to mix the pie filling in last to more of the cherries intact.  It's always very moist & the extract takes away the cake mix taste.  It makes a pretty bundt cake decorated as pictured with cherries on top.

My mom made this years ago and called it a Dump Cake.  I made mine in bundt pan and cooked for 34 min.  I made only half the icing and used white choc chips with a drop of red food coloring.  Everyone had seconds!  I carefully folded the cherries in at the end.

For the frosting: I put 1 cup of powdered sugar (not white sugar) and add 1 teaspoon almond extract to that as well... For the cake:  I always add the cherries last and fold in... this is my in-laws favorite and my husbands too... got it from a friend at work!

The easiest recipe I've ever made considering the rave reviews I got at the potluck I took it to tonight. Yum, yum! Luckly I didn't get asked for the recipe yet... I don't want to reveal how easy it was!

This cake is great!  Very moist! I was a bit skeptical b/c the batter was so thick, but it turned out nicely. 
I used dark chocoalte cake mix and dark chocolate frosting.  I didn't have almond extract so I substituted frangelica liquor.
Cooked in a bundt pan for 45 minutes and when it was cool I drizzled melted chocolate frosting over the cake.  Was quite a hit a work! Will make again!

We didn't make the frosting [we aren't huge frosting lovers here]. We ate our first servings warm from the oven -- those weren't set completely and were more like a bread pudding than a cake. The remainder was refrigerated overnight, and when we had more today, it did end up being like cake with fruit in it. I actually preferred the "pudding" version, but both were fantastic. We'll definitely be making this again, and already have another flavor pair lined up [white cake mix & peach pie filling].

This is exactly Chocolate Cherry Cake III. I took "MELLO 57" suggestion and blended the pie filling, eggs & extract in the blender first. Actually I only had 1 egg so for the other egg I used 2 Tbsp water, 1 Tbsp oil & 2 tsp baking powder and it worked great. I also added 1/2 c applesauce and 1 c flour-coated semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter. I baked it in a 9X13 pyrex dish for 35 minutes. Wow! This is the most moist cake I've ever had -and I've had a lot! I didn't make the frosting because I added the chocolate chips to the batter and I figured I'd just dust a little powdered sugar on top. At the last minute, my mom twisted my arm and said to put frosting so I cheated and warmed up 1/2 a store bought chocolate frosting in the microwave and poured it on top. If you're a chocoholic then this is paradise!

What an easy cake! Tastes delicious, too. Made it according to the recipe, no changes. The only tip I have is to mix everything except the pie filling together, then gently mix in the pie filling. The first time I made it, the cherries disappeared, though the taste was there. By being extra careful, the cherries hold together and make a better cake, IMO. Topped with Chocolate Glaze II.

I was also hesitant about the thickness of the batter, but the cakes were perfect.  I did to 9" pans for 25 minutes.  I used store bought frosting (made it too sweet) but the cake itself was delicious!  Thanks!

Use 9x13 pan, double the almond extract, & frost.  Just before serving top off with container of Cool Whip.  Looks great, tastes great.  The best.

I really loved this cake!  It was so quick and easy, too, since you use a box mix (I used Betty Crocker Devil's Food mix).  Each recipe fills a 10 X 2" round pan up to the top (after baking).  I brought this cake to work and several people told me that it was the best cake that they ever had.  I did not use the frosting recipe - I covered it in a thin layer of buttercream icing and rolled marshmallow fondant.

I'm not a big fan of cake mix recipes, and this one is not different.  It wasn't chocolaty enough or cherry-y enough.  I read the reviews before I made it though, and if you go for it, pour the cake mix in the bowl and add the eggs and extract.  Stir as well as you can.  Then I stirred in half the cherries until well combined and then I folded in the remaining half.  There were whole cherries in the cake when it was done, which some people wanted.

This is a great recipe.  Easy, quick and delicious.  I have shared this with a lot of people and everyone loves it.  I almost liked it better with vanilla flavoring, I have been told to try 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 almond.  Thanks for sharing this.

Excellent!  A better name would be chocolate-covered cherry cake because it tastes just like chocolate-covered cherries.

Wow.  Made this as a 10 inch double layer cake for a friend's graduation.  Cherry pie filling in the middle and cherry buttercream on top and sides - then covered in fondant.  HUGE hit.

I make this cake in a cookie sheet and bake accordingly.  I've also never had any luck with the frosting listed and usually just used canned.  It's a good cake tho!

This cake was to die for!!!! I made it for my dad for his birthday. There were 2 cakes there, and let me just tell you mine was gone before the other had even had a piece gone. I am not a big cake fan but I loved it !!! I will definately make it again and again.

I made this recipe in a bundt pan, and cooked it for 30-34 minutes.  It turned out great!  The icing seems to thicken as it cools, so it's better if it cools slightly before pouring it onto the bundt cake.  The cake was huge hit.

I made this yesterday for a potluck and it was all gone.  People loved it and said it was very most.  I mixed up the cake mix with a fork so it wasn't so lumpy and added just a little cherry filling to make it moist and then folded in the rest of the cherry pie filling. I didn't have almond extract, so I used vanilla.   You could see the cherries and it was delicious.

Loved this cake. So moist and yummy! Baked it in a bundt pan and followed the recipe with no changes. My frosting did turn out gritty though and I noticed a couple other reviewers had the same problem.  Not sure why. I boiled it as directed. Cake was perfect though! Will definitely make again.

I used devils food cake mix because it was all I had and vanilla extract instead of almond. I also sifted my cake mix first to break up the clumps and beat the eggs before I added them. This was a very thick batter but it baked to a really moist cake. I can't wait to try other flavor combos!

I thought the cake was a little too sweet. I didn't make the frosting that is included with the recipe. Instead, I whipped some heavy whipping cream with a few tablespoons of powdered sugar and macadamia liquor (to taste). It was a delicious cool topping. (Make sure you let the cake cool before icing) I topped mine with shaved chocolate and toasted almonds.

This cake was good and my guests liked it.  My husband (his birthday cake) didn't think there were enough cherries in it.  I used 1/2 almond and 1/2 vanilla extracts.  Put in 1/2 the cherries and mixed up, then folded in the rest.  Baked in a bundt pan for about 40 minutes, let cool in the pan for about 20 minutes.  Used the Satiny Chocolate glaze recipe from this site, which was very good.  My friend ate all the drippage from the cake plate!  Next time I think I'll put 1-1/2 cans cherry pie filling in.  Good with vanilla ice cream.

Just didn't care for this recipe. Made following directions although I ended up baking for an extra 5 minutes. The cake sank in middle which then caused the frosting to collect in the middle. Cutting and serving were a mess. Will not make this again.

I had a last minute dinner party and needed a dessert that included ingredients I had on hand. This cake was a great call! Super easy and very moist. I did cut the icing recipe in half since I made mine a bundt cake. I had to put the leftover cake in the freezer to keep from eating it. Sadly it tasted even better fresh out of the deep freeze!! :)

I was hoping for a more intense cherry flavor, but found that the cherries were sort of overpowered by the chocolate. I brought the cake to a Valentine's Day-themed dinner meeting, and most people didn't even realize it had cherries in it.

This was excellent!! I had a little trouble getting the middle to cook all the way, but otherwise it was great!Next time I'll cook it a little longer than stated. The frosting made a lot, next time (yes there will be a next time and again & again!) I will 1/2 the frosting. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

The cake is very moist, but the frosting is very rich I can't hardly stand eating a small piece. I might make this again, but definitely will cut down the sugar in the frosting.

I made this for a co-worker's birthday. Everyone came by my desk two and three times to tell me how good it was. 
don't be nervous about how thick the cake mix looks. Also, I cut up maraschino cherries and place them on the top of the cake to dress it up.

I usually bake from scratch but I thought I would give this cake a try.
Wow! The combination of flavors was great. The frosting really adds to the cake, I definetly would not omit it. I'm making my husband take this to work or else I will eat every bite of it. It was hard not to go back for a second piece!! I did cook the cake for 35 minutes. The center wasn't quite done at 30. Very moist and no dry edges. Supper simple. Don't make this cake if you're watching your weight, you might not be able to controll yourself.

OMG!!!!  This is one of the easiest and best tasting cakes I have made in a long time.  It's moist and has a great texture.  My family loved it so much they begged me to make another one within 24 hours after the first one was gone (they just couldn't get enough of it).  I used a Betty Crocker Milk Chocolate cake mix and also use a can of Betty Crocker Milk Chocolate frosting instead of the making the frosting in the recipe.

Wonderful. I didnt use the frosting and left out the almond extract, so my cake was just mix, eggs, and pie filling. You can also vary the fruit filling and cake mix flavor.(white cake mix and apple pie filling or strawberry and yellowcake mixes)

Made as written except for adding a handful of coconut. Baked in a fluted cake pan for 30 minuets. PERFECT and loved by all. Finished the glaze with a sprinkling of coconut,sliced toasted almonds & chocolate chips.

My mother-in-law made this cake and it was delicious.  Quite rich and moist with the cherries and flavorful with the almond extract.  The frosting is heavy and I may leave this off or at least cut back on the amount.  I like the idea of making it in a Bundt pan.

I used vanilla extract instead of almond.  The cake was moist, but nothing special.  It tasted like a cake mix.  I couldn't even taste the cherries. This is the third time I have made this cake, because of all the good reviews, but I am very disappointed with this cake and will not make it again. I tried it with regular cherry pie filling and black cherry pie filling and the icing with the recipe and canned icing, nothing seemed to make any difference, it's just an ordinary cake that tastes like you used a cake mix.

I made these into cup cakes instead of the regular cake or Bundt since cup cakes are so popular now. The Cup cakes were super moist and tasted like you were eating a chocolate cover cherry.  Yum!

This was delicious, and improved even more in the leftover version after being chilled for a day or two. The frosting really makes this!  I forgot to add either vanilla or almond extract but it didn't seem to make a difference.  I did add vanilla to the frosting, and could have eaten an entire pan of the frosting alone -- which was very similar to my grandmother's fudge. Took all of 10 minutes to throw together.  This is a keeper!

We thought this was wonderful!  I did tweak it a tiny bit, but still stayed pretty true to the recipe!  I used strawberry/raspberry filling instead, and mixed about a cup of thawed frozen strawberries in with the pie filling before I added it to the cake mix.  I saved a cup of the pie filling mixture and poured it on top after the ganache.  I think it's best in a 9x13 pan as suggested as its really the ganache and pie filling on top that make it gooey and yummy!

Made this in a bundt pan, and it turned out.. well, just fine, but not as crazy delicious as I expected based on the reviews here.   The icing was amazing, but the cake itself was sort of meh: not very rich or moist at all, in my opinion.  Next time, I may try making the cake from scratch, and/or adding pudding, and/or adding chopped chocolate chips to the batter to give things an extra kick.

Good cake if you're in a pinch, but I would prefer to make from scratch in the future rather than using a mix.

Was very good, but I had two correctable problems. I agree that the frosting calls for too much white sugar. I also don't think I baked it long enough as the middle was soggy. Otherwise, very tasty and simple!

I got a lot of great compliments on this recipe... I kept my cake in the refrigerator and the cake tastes great chilled. I would not use as much sugar as was called for, since the frosting was a little too sweet, but the cake was moist and had just enough cherry.

I have made this recipe for at least 20 years. I came across it in a Pillsbury cookbook and it is one of my Mother's favorite chocolate cakes.I usually make mine in a bundt pan and sprinkle chopped pecans over the glaze.

Execellent as an easy-to-make cake.  It is moist, cherries add nice flavor, and the frosting is so easy to add on.  I have made several, and they are quite popular with those I give them to.

My husband loved this- I was going to use pre-made frosting but changed my mind at the last minute and made this one in the recipe- it was super easy and made all the difference!  Great warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and this cake was so moist that it kept for several days very well.

I thought this cake was really good...very moist. The frosting was delicious. My husband didn't like the bites of cherry so next time I may mash or cut the cherries first. Good recipe!

Well, I thought this cake was great and so did everyone at my husband's office, although next time I will try it with a little more cherry filling - or raspberry!  In the interest of time, since I was baking for a party, I used a canned frosting (chocolate almond).  Actually, the flavor complimented the cherries and the almond extract nicely.  I will definitely make this again.

This cake is a hit with everyone, very moist.
if you put it in a deep dish it takes longer to bake.  and the sauce seems to go along way. My sister calls this the TIP cake, because she was I was trying to get tips by making this cake at a fishing lodge I'm cooking for :)

I'm not a real fan of any cake but my husband really liked this one.  I, however, thought the frosting was absolutely wonderful.  It tasted like chocolate fudge.

I made this cake for my sister's birthday, and everyone raved about it.  I gave up sweets for lent, so unfortunatly I wasn't able to taste it.  I can't wait to make this one again when I can try it.  My sister took what was left to work today, and she said it was gone within 30 minutes.  A great, easy recipe.  Thanks!

This cake is moist and the frosting is sweet and fudgy.  The cake isn't overly sweet and if it was, the frosting would push it over the edge.  Good flavors and really easy to put together.

this cake is awsome, you can't get enough, you can also make it lighter by useing egg beaters and light choc. chips.
