this made a great (and quick) weeknight meal. as usual i made modifications: i sauteed the peppers with a diced onion and two cloves of minced garlic, then added the wine viegar and olive oil to the pan for a minute, then tossed everything with the warm pasta and added the tomato to the bowl. i doubled the chili powder to make it spicier, and also added cooked chicken pieces to the end to make it a full meal. worked incredibly well, thanks for a great recipe!!!!

Tasty.  The chili powder and red wine vinegar combo definitely is quite a flavor contrast in my mind, but it turned out pretty good!  I doubled (at least) the chili powder, added some cumin, black pepper, and garlic salt to the dressing.  My biggest recommendation is to use very fresh, very ripe tomatoes for the best flavor.  Also, might even be better to cube the mozzarella cheese instead of shredding it.  The shreds just sort of blended in, I was hoping for a stonger cheese flavor.  Overall, great pasta salad...even better the second day!

The merging of the vinegar and the chili powder flavor made for a nice change-of-taste dressing but even though I made more than the recipe called for, I thought the salad was rather dry, especially on the second day.   I left the red pepper and tomato chunks large because I like the contrast of shapes, textures and colors and I think I'd prefer the cheese in chunks also instead of shredded, but didn't have any so left it out.

This was a very tasty salad... after I added some additional spices:) I did red, green, and orange bell peppers; diced tomatoes w/ jalapeños; extra chili powder, cayenne pepper, cajun seasoning and spicy all spice.  I used chunks of jalapeño cheddar instead of mozzarella and used the suggestion on pine nuts.  This was really delicious even the first night so I can't wait to taste it tomorrow!

I didn't like this at all, but I'm not a big tomato or pepper fan.  Everyone else who tried it thought it was good.  It needed more flavor though, than what the recipes calls for.

Good but not very spicy... the chili powder gives it a more smoky flavor rather than spicy. i marinated some shrimp in olive oil and chili powder for a few hours then sauteed them and added them to the pasta before chilling. the shrimp adds a nice touch i thought. next time i will add cayanne or some chili's maybe to give it that extra kick ( i like things spicy)

I thought this was pretty good. I used Cavatappi, or corkscrew pasta. I only had a green bell pepper, so I used about five serrano peppers, some yellow and some red, for color as well as enhanced spice. Very tasty.

Not really spicy and I added a lot more chili powder and cayenne powder and reduced the amount of tomatoes by one or two. It was just ok.

This salad was dry and was even more so the next day.  Red wine vinegar was overpowered by chili powder.

I altered the recipe for the ingredients I had on hand
Added:
2 cans of albacore tuna, drained juice of one can into water for pasta
1 can of garbanzo beans, drained juice into water for pasta
Substituted macaroni for rotelli, boiled in salted water with a tablespoon of oil to keep pasta from sticking, stir occasionally until al dente, then drained in cold water.
1 cup of green olives with pimiento, drained
1 half pepper each of red, green and orange bell peppers, chopped into small cubes
1 cup of Dukes mayonaisse, if you don't have Dukes then you need to move farther south! 
Substituted 8oz of monterey jack for the mozzarella
1 small yellow onion, diced
Just a dash of red wine vinegar, maybe a little more.
Same with the EVOO.
Added black pepper and oregano to taste.
Mixed everything and chilled.
It's probably not even the same recipe but SAL inspired me.  That is what gets 5 stars from me.

Tasty. Maybe it will be more flavourful by tomorrow when it has a chance to sit. I added a jalapeno, a can of black eyed peas and I used cubed sharp cheddar cheese. It was light and refreshing for summer. I will try it tomorrow and will probably make again.

I made this as directed, except I substituted paprika for the chili powder, because my wife doesn't like things overly spicy. To jazz it up, I added half a bottle of McCormick's Salad Supreme, a chopped onion, Another 1/4 cup each red wine vinegar & olive oil, and a sprinkle of Italian seasoning.

I made a couple modifications, I used balsamic instead of the red wine, and after reading a couple reviews I also sauted some onion and garlic and onion together. Also used roasted red peppers along with red pepper flakes since I am out of chili powder. I thought it was excellent and the original recipe is a good one for branching off of.

Looks really good. I plan to add black olives, garlic, maybe onions &/or celery.
