We couldn't agree with Stephoney's review more!  It IS decadent and tastes just like key lime pie!  Ours, too, turned out more white than clear like the picture.  We liked her idea of using 2 oz of everything.  We used fat free half and half to cut down on the calories, and it still tasted great!  We even added a tablespoon of cream of coconut that so many other recipes calls for.  It's easy and tastes delicious!!

Yum! This drink is decadent! I upped the measurements to 2 oz each. It filled my martini glass up to the rim :)  I didn't have any vanilla flavored vodka so I added a splash of vanilla extract to Sky vodka instead. It worked just fine. I didn't have any trouble with the cream separating but I also keep my martini glass and shaker in the freezer until I need it. I'm not sure if that makes a difference. My drink also turned out white in color as opposed to the clear martini pictured in the recipe. Anyhow, I would recommend this drink to anyone who enjoys key lime pie. It tastes just like it!

Perfection in a glass! As a beer drinking Wisconsin girl I was thrown off when on a first date the guy ordered a key lime pie martini. Over 7 years later I still tease my husband about it and this recipe is as close to the fine dining restaurant versions I've found! I couldn't find key lime juice so I bought the cheap green plastic lime juice for $.80 and couldn't tell a difference. Thanks for sharing!

The curdling of the cream is disconcerting, but the flavor is wonderful.  I used light cream and freshly squeezed lime juice to make this refreshing cocktail.

Excellent and completely scrumptious! Brings me back to the days I lived in South Florida and could indulge in delicious key lime pie.

Made this tonight as I made a key lime pie earlier and had the ingredients still out. Very good and refreshing! I think I'll omit the half and half all together or maybe just add half the amount. The white doesn't look that pretty. I lined the glass with sugar and I put a lime wedge on top. I think #2 will be awesome with the changes.
