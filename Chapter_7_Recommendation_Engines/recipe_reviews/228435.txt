I have done several recipes from this site but never wanted to share. This has become my go to recipe for pot lucks and the church fellowship meals.  It is fast and easy. The only thing I changed in the recipe was that I added Â¾ of a teaspoon of hot sauce.  I think that is really based on taste. The first time I made it was for a birthday party I was doing for my sister at church.  I cut out a few steps.  I bought Wal-Mart fully cooked meatballs and let them thaw the night before in the refrigerator. Sunday morning I made the sauce. It took about 10 minutes.  I put the meatballs in the crock pot and poured the sauce over it and put set it on low for an hour.  It was ready when I was ready to leave for church. I set the crock-pot on warm during church.  This was a big hit.  Not one meatball was left.  I served it with Hawaiian King rolls and salad. It made a full meal.

I liked these, but they were a bit too sweet for me. I had to add a lot more hot sauce than called for and some red pepper to offset how sweet they were. (I still didn't taste any heat.)  I then added some garlic powder and onion powder. Thank you for the recipe; it was nice to try something new. My toddler loved them, but I prefer the Heinz chili sauce and grape jelly meatballs.

This is how my mother has been making meatballs for usually Christmas since I was little (over 35 years) minus the red currant. She got the recipe from my Dad's mother. So this recipe has been around a very long time. Love it!

This is my pot luck go to. I also make this where doing the fellowship dinner at church. I serve with Hawaiian rolls and a garden salad. Easy on me and a big hit.
